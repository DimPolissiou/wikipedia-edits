Approximately 11% of undergraduates, 3,400 students, participate in one of the 60 chapters of social fraternities or sororities at the [[University of Minnesota]], Twin Cities campus.<ref name=\"OFSL2017\" /> Participation in affiliated groups associated with the Greek System such as honor, service and professional fraternities bring total Greek System affiliation figures significantly higher.  Counting past and present, more than half of the University's 200 Greek organizations remain active today, the pioneers of which have had a presence on the [[University of Minnesota]] campus for over 145 years. The university's \"Greek System\" includes [[Professional fraternities and sororities|professional fraternities]], [[Honor society|honor societies]], [[Service fraternities and sororities|service fraternities]], and religious fraternities along with the highly visible residential undergrad [[Fraternities and sororities|academic and social]] chapters.\n\nA '''[[#Academic and social fraternities and sororities|comprehensive list of chapters]]''', past and present, segmented by category, follows this brief overview of what these societies are and how they evolved. References for each group show current and former property addresses either owned or leased. Contact information is provided via the references, where available.\n\nThe terms \"Fraternity\" and \"Sorority\" are used somewhat interchangeably, with men's and co-ed groups always using Fraternity, and women's groups using either Fraternity or Sorority.<ref name=\"Sorority terminology\">There is one exception to this usage rule, where normally, men's and co-ed groups call themselves \"fraternities.\" The music sorority [[Tau Beta Sigma]] is co-educational and its male and female members are members of the sorority.</ref>  For convenience, the term \"Greek Letter Society\" is a generic substitute. The word, \"Greek,\" in this case refers to the use of [[Greek alphabet#Letters|Greek Letters]] for each society's name, and not to Greek ethnicity.\n\n==Historical sketch==\n\n[[File:Honor Societies etching, 1922 Minnesota Gopher Yearbook.jpg|thumb|left|Editors of the '''Minnesota Gopher''' Yearbook created iconic etchings to highlight fraternity and sorority pages, this example from 1922.]]The '''[[University of Minnesota]] Greek system''' is over 145 years old, having grown steadily with the rapid growth of the University. Its first men's fraternity, [[Chi Psi]], dates to 1874, and its first women's fraternity, [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], dates to 1880, long before the term 'sorority' was popularized as a term for the women's 'houses'.\n\nYet these pioneers did not themselves mark the beginnings of fraternal presence at the school. Many of Minnesota's early University presidents and department heads were fraternity men or women from'' 'back East,' ''having experienced undergraduate life in the flourishing [[College literary societies|literary societies]] and old line fraternities that in turn were born out of America's earliest institutions of higher learning.

Similarly, the age, prestige, size and breadth of the University of Minnesota have resulted in its hosting many of the nation's [[Honor societies|honor]] and [[Professional fraternities and sororities|professional]] fraternities for most disciplines.  As early as 1925, the ''Minnesota Gopher'' yearbook reported the presence of 25 national academic [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities]], 18 national academic [[Fraternities and sororities in North America#Sororities|sororities]], and 33 national professional chapters on campus.

Between 1900 and 1917, rentals gave way to properties built for the chapters, resulting in several iconic examples of Beaux Arts, Georgian and Classical styles. Finally, between 1921 and 1936, Minnesota's fraternity chapters engaged in that same popular [[North American fraternity and sorority housing|building spree]] which was sweeping across other early private and land grant colleges and universities from New York to California. The result of this last phase was the often stately homes occupied by many Greek chapters today, upgrades from boarding house-style clapboard and stucco homes, to the many ''Fraternity Row'' mansions that are visible at Minnesota along University Avenue SE, on 4th and 5th Street SE, and the 10th Avenue ''\"Sorority Row,\"'' all in Minneapolis. Similarly, the St. Paul campus is home to several stately chapter buildings, or chapterhouses, along Cleveland Avenue. It is a testament to the alumni of many of these chapters that their buildings survived, as so many were financed by the 1920s financial bubble, having endured weak membership eras during the Great Depression and then the twin turmoils of WWII and 1960s anti-establishment unrest.

In partnership with national organizations, University oversight of the Academic and Social chapters is managed on a day-to-day basis by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140717205551/http://www.fsl.umn.edu/index.html Office for Fraternity and Sorority Life], a unit of the [http://www.osa.umn.edu/ Office for Student Affairs].\n\nProfessional and Honor societies are coordinated at a lower level of administrative involvement by the various academic departments within the University and its several colleges, and of these, some operate merely cooperatively, with no involvement from the University at all.\n\nSince gaining its first chapter in 1874, Minnesota administrators have maintained an open, if not always supportive relationship with its chapters {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. An impulse to exert administrative management on these highly visible registered student organizations has at times been offset by interest in limiting liability exposure where it could be claimed that the administration ''was'' responsible but ''did not do enough'' to prevent an unsafe or illegal occurrence. Minnesota's Greek System has, on balance, avoided the frequency of harmful events, as have occurred at other large schools; this primarily as the result of self-policing.<ref name=\"OFSL2013\" /><ref name=\"Nuwer\">[http://www.hanknuwer.com/hazing-deaths/ Hank Nuwer's list of global hazing incidents] does not show Minnesota among its extensive list of 'troubled' schools, accessed 27 May 2014</ref> The original, more active relationship between the Greeks and the Administration had been marginalized somewhat after the turbulent late 1960s and during the ''lassaiz-faire'' commuter-student years of 1970\u201390. This coincided with national scrutiny and bad publicity over hazing events elsewhere in the US. With the return to a more residential campus, both the Minnesota Greek System and its relationship with the University are thriving: An estimated 2,800 Greeks on campus participate in '''58''' separate undergraduate Academic and Social chapters.<ref name=\"OFSL2013\" /> In addition, Professional and honor societies, many accepting undergraduates, number more than 80. Because of this and other factors, the University is again improving its relationship with the Greek Community:\n\n<blockquote>In March 2012, President Kaler announced the formation of a Greek Community Strategic Task Force (GCSTF) and issued a Charge to the GCSTF Steering Committee which emphasized the need to develop a \"sustainable and robust relationship between the University and the Greek community.\"<ref name=\"GCSTF12\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Criticism==\n{{further|Fraternities_and_sororities#Criticism}}\nOver the decades, Minnesota's Greek system, like others nationwide, has had its detractors.  Most notably in the late 1960s, anti-establishment agitation resulted in decreased interest and participation. This negative environment abated with the end of the [[Vietnam War]]. While membership again surged beginning in the late 1970s, the campus population was swelling even faster. While hitting ''numeric'' highs, Greeks at Minnesota thus never achieved the pre-Vietnam era participation level as a ''percentage'' of the campus.  For some, Greeks were \"too exclusive.\" Commuting students may have had little occasion to socialize with them on the largely non-residential campus. Some students chafed at overt culture differences where Prep-era Greek men would wear blazers and ties to Monday meetings. Occasional surveys of detractors would declare a perception that membership was akin to buying friends.<ref name=\"GACSurvey\">Greek Action Committee Recruitment survey, 1984, IFC archives, accessed 16 June 2014</ref>  For others, it was simply a monetary concern, with a reluctance to include fraternity or sorority dues into a tight college budget.<ref name=\"GACSurvey\"/> The hugely popular movie, \"[[Animal House]]\" also branded for a generation the image of a lethargic, disruptive and academically inferior \"frat boy\" on the national consciousness.<ref>{{IMDb title|0077975|\"Animal House\"|- Hugely popular, this movie was a National Lampoon parody of writer Chris Miller's experiences at 1960s-era Dartmouth.}}</ref>\n\n===Response to criticism===\n\n====Fixing problems====\n\nGreek organizations both nationally and locally sponsor many risk avoidance programs for the real benefits of student safety and well-being, as well as to avoid harmful bad publicity. Hence, these organizations have learned to address criticism quickly: Chapters and national bodies have adopted extensive changes to reduce incidents of hazing and other harmful behaviors. The recent announcement by Sigma Alpha Epsilon to ban \"pledging\" nationwide is only the latest of such announcements, of revised prospective member programs now adopted by many fraternities.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/11/sigma-alpha-epsilon-pledging-hazing_n_4938425.html Sigma Alpha Epsilon Bans Pledging Nationwide In Effort To Stop Hazing], as reported by the Huffington Post's Tyler Kingkade on 11 March 2014, accessed 11 June 2014</ref> While not limited to fraternities and sororities, harmful activities like underage drinking and hazing are often headlined as local news stories, with fraternity chapters as the most visible examples.<ref>Studies show that underage and binge drinking are more prevalent nationally among student athletes, Greek system members, and organization members, with the most significant grouping ''less'' affected by the problem being commuter students that live at home.

All sororities and some fraternity chapters have banned alcohol in their living facilities. National fraternities, through the [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|NIC]] and sororities through their national and local governing boards require member training each year to combat hazing, underage drinking, sexual assault and other harmful behaviors.<ref>[https://nicfraternity.org/nic-standards/ NIC Standards statement] accessed 21 Nov 2018.</ref> Hence, individual chapters are not alone in addressing these problems. Inter-chapter governing boards at Minnesota (listed below by chapter groupings) provide event monitoring services and local risk management training, culminating in the introduction in 2012 of '''Arkeo''', which serves as an inter-Greek cooperative monitoring program to help chapters avoid risk.<ref>[http://www.fsl.umn.edu/assets/pdf/comm_info/State%20of%20the%20Greek%20Sp%202013.pdf State of the Greek Community, 2013 Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040843/http://www.fsl.umn.edu/assets/pdf/comm_info/State%20of%20the%20Greek%20Sp%202013.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, accessed 11 June 2014</ref><ref name=\"DefyingCritics\">[http://www.fsl.umn.edu/parents/greek_sterotypes.html Office for Fraternity and Sorority Life risk management statement on \"Defying the Stereotypes\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714162943/http://www.fsl.umn.edu/parents/greek_sterotypes.html |date=2014-07-14 }}, accessed 12 June 2014</ref>\n\n====Response to perceptions====\n\nAs to the financial cost of participation, fraternity leaders note that the vast majority of Greek students work their way through school.<ref name=\"DefyingCritics\" /> In fact, the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life claims that the average cost burden for fraternity chapter membership adds 3% to a student budget, and may indeed be less costly on a net basis when factoring reduced summer rents and lower live-in costs versus dorms and private apartments. Finally, the Minnesota campus is markedly more residential than thirty years ago. Development of over a dozen large for-profit private dorms and many upgraded apartments has increased the average ''quality'' and ''quantity'' of near-campus housing ''and'' has increased their average expense. The result has been that fraternities and sororities, previously perceived as among the more expensive housing options now range from \"in line with\" or even lower than the average cost of dorms or apartments.<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/university-of-minnesota-sees-resurgence-of-interest-in-greek-life/223334431/ StarTrib article on resurgence of interest in Greek Life], accessed 4 Sept 2016</ref><ref name=\"2016 IFC Study\">For reference, see the 2016 Interfraternity Council recruitment book, p.8. The book examines Sept-May average costs of living in a fraternity house of $6,544 (which includes room and board, fees, meals, utilities, social expenses, etc.) to the cost for similar double-occupancy dorm living of $8,100 which includes 14 meals and utilities, but no social fees or parking. These average expenses both compare favorably to living in a private apartment with an average cost of $10,056, which does not include meals, parking or social events, and which requires a sublease if the apartment is vacated during the summer months. Sorority living expenses may be higher, with increased services. For further analysis of these costs, see University Housing Services. The analysis is more involved than can be fully treated here due to space limitations.</ref>\n\nAddressing the claim of exclusivity in recruitment materials, Greek leaders will accept that label as another way of saying they promote high standards. All fraternities are by definition self-selective.  But, they clarify, so are all friendships. Further, they state, \"U\" students all have passed a bar of exclusivity by getting into the increasingly selective University itself. With an array of student groups numbering in the thousands, and a multitude of Greek chapter personalities, fraternity and sorority proponents are confident that all students who wish to join a Greek society can find one where they can flourish.<ref name=\"DefyingCritics\" /> The matter of religious and race exclusivity appears to have passed several generations ago: While some chapters are historically black, Hispanic, or Asian-oriented, there is no race exclusivity or other discrimination exclusivity in any of Minnesota's chapters. All are integrated, and have been for some time. Minnesota was the second Big Ten school (after [[University of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]]) to see its fraternities and sororities drop all bias clauses (race, color or creed) from their bylaws and policies. Older chapters have been integrated since the 1950s and 1960s<ref name=\"HistoricalStudy2003\" /> and the multi-cultural Greek chapters since their founding in more recent years.<ref>[https://diversity.umn.edu/eoaa/ The University Department of Equal Opportunity] requires all members of University communities to adhere to this standard, but has not seen a need for intervention in Minnesota's fully integrated community of Greek chapters.

While CSHI's proposed ''Greek Village'' development for the 1700 block of University Avenue was not adopted in 2011, in March 2012, University President Kaler followed up on his promise at that time with formation of a Greek Community Strategic Task Force (GCSTF), with the Charge to the group that ''\"emphasized the need to develop a sustainable and robust relationship between the University and the Greek community.\"'' He stated, ''\"[The Greeks] get better grades, graduate sooner, and give more money to the University.\"''{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Under his direction, the UM Foundation has been collecting data on Greek participation for all students, a data point that had been only sporadically kept prior to 2012.<ref name=\"GCSTF12\" />\n\n==Academic and social fraternities and sororities==\nFor brevity, the sections below make extensive use of [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]], one of the first items in a new member's instruction program.

While most IFC chapters are based in Minneapolis, several call St. Paul their home. After a period of level membership, for various reasons, fraternity membership is increasing rapidly.  Average chapter size is 50, and several chapters exceed 100 men.\n\nFraternity buildings are generally owned by chapter alumni organizations.  Some chapters are non-residential, while a few rent or lease space.\n\nAs part of IFC or national organization self-governance, or University disciplinary action, chapters may be suspended (\"de-recognized\") or closed for a time.

According to the \u0398\u039d\u0395 website, the ''Tau'' designation was \"fancied by the chapter,\" and ''Chi'' was also considered, before ''Alpha Epsilon'' was allowed.  \u0398\u039d\u0395's Wikipedia page notes (without clear citation) possible activity at Minnesota as late as 1934, which the lack of a ''Gopher'' record shows is unlikely.</ref><ref name=\"Theta Nu Epsilon perception\">Baird's and other sources note \u0398\u039d\u0395 was an ill-favored national due to its recruitment of sophomores who were already members of other fraternities, and a policy of secrecy about the active members - those same sophomores tapped each year. It was NOT an honorary, nor a service society. (Freshmen were discluded, juniors and seniors were advisoral only.) Hence, \u0398\u039d\u0395 became a bit of a pariah, and members were pressured to quit lest they be expelled from their primary fraternities at Minnesota (see \u03a6\u03a3\u039a Rand History); in 1913 the NIC advocated ''vigorously against'' its collegians joining \u0398\u039d\u0395. Struggling for a workable path to legitimacy, several varying models developed on \u0398\u039d\u0395's campuses, where some chapters became standard fraternities, and others public inter-fraternity groups. At Alabama it even became a political machine, while other chapters took yet other forms. Later, with adoption of changes, \u0398\u039d\u0395 briefly joined the NIC in the 1930s, but ceased operations after WWII. Several chapters reformed the society as a smaller entity, some becoming co-ed in the 1970s.

The terms are synonymous, After a period of level membership representing about 3% of campus women, for various reasons, sorority membership is increasing rapidly.  Chapter size in almost all cases now exceeds 120 women.\n\nInterest and recruitment is strong enough that, in 2013, the University of Minnesota was opened to PHC expansion for the first time in 30 years, and the resulting two colonization efforts (welcoming [[Chi Omega]] and [[Phi Mu]]) occurred in 2013 and 2016, respectively.\n\nSorority properties are generally owned by a chapter's alumni club, though some chapters do not have housing, and others rent or lease space. As part of PHC or national organization self-governance, or University disciplinary action, chapters may be suspended (\"de-recognized\") or closed for a time.

They are currently not grouped with the social fraternities and sororities.<ref name=\"OFSL2017\" /> However, some also associate with social fraternities and societies. They may also use of chapter and national organizational hierarchy, and their use of Greek Letters as identification. Some of these are populated by graduate students, a few exclusively so. As a rule, the honor and professional societies focus on specific academic, professional or service missions. Historically too there has been significant crossover and cooperation between types; some professional societies have revised themselves into non-residential honor groups. In contrast, several professional organizations have gone the other direction to conference among the academic and social chapters.<ref>This crossover is apparent in many examples: [[Alpha Gamma Rho]] fraternity became an [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|NIC]] member while ''retaining'' its membership in the [[Professional Fraternity Association|PHA]]. Born as a professional fraternity, by 1917 it had begun to operate as a social and academic fraternity, requiring 'exclusivity' of its members, i.e.: they couldn't be part of another social or academic society. In 1944 [[FarmHouse]] fraternity made a similar move. Like AGR, both retain a focus on agriculture. [[Delta Chi]] fraternity began as a Law fraternity, conferencing with similar societies it its early days, while by 1911 moving exclusively into what would become the NIC camp. Minnesota's was the fourth oldest chapter of this national and was a participant in this evolution. A number of multicultural fraternities such as [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] are members of both the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|NPHC]] as well as the NIC. [[Evans Scholars Foundation|Evans Scholars]], an honorary fraternity for golf caddies whose [http://minnesota.evansscholars.org/site/c.5nJIJQPnEhKWE/b.7924611/k.BD08/Home.htm Eta chapter] (accessed 3 Dec 2017) occupies a home among the undergraduate Greeks, operates as a social and academic residential chapter and maintains a full social schedule among the NIC and NPC fraternities and sororities. City codes group all such property-owning organizations together, regulating them as similar to boarding houses. Sale or rental of properties between groups has occurred cooperatively for well over a century. To summarize, rather than exhibiting hard-and-fast lines of demarcation that separate social, professional or honor types of organizations, these societies appear to flex, cooperate and adjust over time with the demands of participants, becoming more or less vigorous (residential, social, 'programmed') in a slow but steady evolution.</ref> But most remain oriented toward senior students (including 3rd and 4th year students) and graduate students. Social/academic fraternity or sorority membership is not a requirement for these groups. Individuals who meet a group's criteria may join or be \"tapped,\" or asked to join, as may non-Greek students.  Multiple affiliations may be allowable as membership is frequently not exclusive to one group - see individual societies for details.  Activity varies; some of the professional and service groups are residential, while the honors societies may meet only quarterly or annually, if at all. The cut-off line where any campus organization falls ''within'' these headings or ''without'' is by long-established convention; those formed prior to 1990 are listed under the subheadings used by various volumes of the [[Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities]], which for more than a century has been the data source of record for such organizations.  Newer groups have been placed in categories similar to Baird's. The latest version of Baird's, 1991,  was published ''before'' the national development of some of the societies here, and therefore, position and inclusion is, in some cases, assumptive.<ref name=\"Baird's\" />\n\n[[File:Phi Beta Kappa Key.png|thumb|right|x200px|The Phi Beta Kappa Key.

Because of the age, size and research focus of the University of Minnesota, it hosts a wide variety of these organizations. Members commonly include the society on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9/CV, which may serve to bolster grad school acceptance, publishing merit, and professional opportunities.\n\nListed by date of local founding with national conference membership, these are co-ed, non-residential, achievement-based organizations which self-select members based on published criteria.\n\nAt graduation, or at times of formal academic processionals, graduates, administrators, PhD holders and post-doctoral fellows wear [[Academic regalia in the United States|academic robes]] in the colors of their degree, school and other distinction, according to a voluntary Intercollegiate Code that governs customs such as formal academic regalia. In addition, various colored devices such as [[Academic stole|stoles]], [[Academic scarf|scarfs]], [[Honor cords|cords]], [[Square academic cap#tassel|tassels]], and medallions are used to indicate membership in a student's honor society; cords and [[Square academic cap|mortarboard]] tassels are most common. '''[[Phi Beta Kappa]]''', the first honor society, locally founded at Minnesota in 1892, has used {{color box|#FFC0CB}} [[Pink]] and {{color box|#87CEEB}} [[Sky blue]] since its national founding in 1776.  Hence, students tapped for \u03a6\u0392\u039a may wear tassels or other society-approved items, in these colors. Like most schools, the University of Minnesota allows such regalia for honor society members. Stoles are less common, but they are used by a few honor societies. In academic circles, colors are well-known, and follow long-standing protocols. [http://www.achsnatl.org/honor_cord_registry.asp The ACHS website lists the colors] for their 68 member organizations, and the [[Honor society]] WP page lists others. [[File:Graduating students.JPG|thumb|left|x160px|Multi-colored tassels, cords and stoles are noticeable over black graduation robes.]]<!--This photo should be updated to a free-use photo of University of Minnesota grads, showing honors colors-->\n\nMany honor societies invite students to become members based on scholastic rank (the top x% of a class) and/or grade point, either overall, or for classes taken within the discipline for which the honor society provides recognition. In cases where academic achievement would not be an appropriate criterion for membership, other standards are required for membership (such as completion of a particular ceremony or training program). These societies recognize ''past achievement.'' Pledging is ''not'' required, and new candidates may be immediately inducted into membership after meeting predetermined academic criteria and paying a one-time membership fee. Some require graduate enrollment.  Because of their purpose of recognition, most honor societies will have much higher academic achievement requirements for membership than professional societies. It is also common for a scholastic honor society to add a criterion relating to the character of the student. Some honor societies are ''invitation only'' while others allow unsolicited applications. Finally, membership in an honor society might be considered exclusive, i.e., a member of such an organization cannot join other honor societies representing the same field. Governance requires a faculty sponsor and each society remains faculty-guided, usually with alumni input.<br>\n(ACHS) indicates members of the [[Association of College Honor Societies]].\n\n'''''Active honor and recognition societies'''''\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-break|width=34%}}\n* '''\u03a6\u0394\u03a6''' - [[Phi Delta Phi]], 1891, legal honors<ref>Note, until 2012, \u03a6\u0394\u03a6 had nationally been a ''professional'' fraternity.

Similarly, the age, prestige, size and breadth of the University of Minnesota have resulted in its hosting many of the nation's [[Honor societies|honor]] and [[Professional fraternities and sororities|professional]] fraternities for most disciplines.

Between 1900 and 1917, rentals gave way to properties built for the chapters, resulting in several iconic examples of Beaux Arts, Georgian and Classical styles. Finally, between 1921 and 1936, Minnesota's fraternity chapters engaged in that same popular [[North American fraternity and sorority housing|building spree]] which was sweeping across other early private and land grant colleges and universities from New York to California. The result of this last phase was the often stately homes occupied by many Greek chapters today, upgrades from boarding house-style clapboard and stucco homes, to the many ''Fraternity Row'' mansions that are visible at Minnesota along University Avenue SE, on 4th and 5th Street SE, and the 10th Avenue ''\"Sorority Row,\"'' all in Minneapolis. Similarly, the St. Paul campus is home to several stately chapter buildings, or chapterhouses, along Cleveland Avenue. It is a testament to the alumni of many of these chapters that their buildings survived, as so many were financed by the 1920s financial bubble, having endured weak membership eras during the Great Depression and then the twin turmoils of WWII and 1960s anti-establishment unrest.

Several recent remodeling and renovation programs have allowed significant improvement to some chapters, including recent full renovations by Chi Psi, Gamma Phi Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Phi Sigma Kappa, along with completely rebuilt houses for Alpha Gamma Rho and FarmHouse. Lack of housing for fraternity and sororities, a community now grown to 15% of the student population in 2017 according to the OFSL, remains a hurdle that new groups must overcome. This dearth is only partially remedied by the opening of the new (2013) 17th Avenue Freshman Dorm.  This particular project has allowed two ground level rental suites along University Avenue for chapters new to campus, intended to serve as a long-term incubator.<ref name=\"OFSL2013\"/>\n\nThe Minneapolis City Council approved a number of zoning changes that relaxed restrictions on Greek ownership and renovation of properties near campus in action taken on 28 April 2017.

Incorporated alumni groups own the residential chapter buildings where they exist, serving in the role of property manager. Additional local alumni oversight varies by chapter. National organizations provide organizational and operational guidance, extending to disciplinary action where warranted. In partnership with national organizations, University oversight of the Academic and Social chapters is managed on a day-to-day basis by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140717205551/http://www.fsl.umn.edu/index.html Office for Fraternity and Sorority Life], a unit of the [http://www.osa.umn.edu/ Office for Student Affairs].\n\nProfessional and Honor societies are coordinated at a lower level of administrative involvement by the various academic departments within the University and its several colleges, and of these, some operate merely cooperatively, with no involvement from the University at all.\n\nSince gaining its first chapter in 1874, Minnesota administrators have maintained an open, if not always supportive relationship with its chapters {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. An impulse to exert administrative management on these highly visible registered student organizations has at times been offset by interest in limiting liability exposure where it could be claimed that the administration ''was'' responsible but ''did not do enough'' to prevent an unsafe or illegal occurrence. Minnesota's Greek System has, on balance, avoided the frequency of harmful events, as have occurred at other large schools; this primarily as the result of self-policing.<ref name=\"OFSL2013\" /><ref name=\"Nuwer\">[http://www.hanknuwer.com/hazing-deaths/ Hank Nuwer's list of global hazing incidents] does not show Minnesota among its extensive list of 'troubled' schools, accessed 27 May 2014</ref> The original, more active relationship between the Greeks and the Administration had been marginalized somewhat after the turbulent late 1960s and during the ''lassaiz-faire'' commuter-student years of 1970\u201390. This coincided with national scrutiny and bad publicity over hazing events elsewhere in the US. With the return to a more residential campus, both the Minnesota Greek System and its relationship with the University are thriving: An estimated 2,800 Greeks on campus participate in '''58''' separate undergraduate Academic and Social chapters.<ref name=\"OFSL2013\" /> In addition, Professional and honor societies, many accepting undergraduates, number more than 80. Because of this and other factors, the University is again improving its relationship with the Greek Community:\n\n<blockquote>In March 2012, President Kaler announced the formation of a Greek Community Strategic Task Force (GCSTF) and issued a Charge to the GCSTF Steering Committee which emphasized the need to develop a \"sustainable and robust relationship between the University and the Greek community.\"<ref name=\"GCSTF12\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Criticism==\n{{further|Fraternities_and_sororities#Criticism}}\nOver the decades, Minnesota's Greek system, like others nationwide, has had its detractors.  Most notably in the late 1960s, anti-establishment agitation resulted in decreased interest and participation. This negative environment abated with the end of the [[Vietnam War]]. While membership again surged beginning in the late 1970s, the campus population was swelling even faster. While hitting ''numeric'' highs, Greeks at Minnesota thus never achieved the pre-Vietnam era participation level as a ''percentage'' of the campus.  For some, Greeks were \"too exclusive.\" Commuting students may have had little occasion to socialize with them on the largely non-residential campus. Some students chafed at overt culture differences where Prep-era Greek men would wear blazers and ties to Monday meetings. Occasional surveys of detractors would declare a perception that membership was akin to buying friends.<ref name=\"GACSurvey\">Greek Action Committee Recruitment survey, 1984, IFC archives, accessed 16 June 2014</ref>  For others, it was simply a monetary concern, with a reluctance to include fraternity or sorority dues into a tight college budget.<ref name=\"GACSurvey\"/> The hugely popular movie, \"[[Animal House]]\" also branded for a generation the image of a lethargic, disruptive and academically inferior \"frat boy\" on the national consciousness.<ref>{{IMDb title|0077975|\"Animal House\"|- Hugely popular, this movie was a National Lampoon parody of writer Chris Miller's experiences at 1960s-era Dartmouth.}}</ref>\n\n===Response to criticism===\n\n====Fixing problems====\n\nGreek organizations both nationally and locally sponsor many risk avoidance programs for the real benefits of student safety and well-being, as well as to avoid harmful bad publicity. Hence, these organizations have learned to address criticism quickly: Chapters and national bodies have adopted extensive changes to reduce incidents of hazing and other harmful behaviors. The recent announcement by Sigma Alpha Epsilon to ban \"pledging\" nationwide is only the latest of such announcements, of revised prospective member programs now adopted by many fraternities.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/11/sigma-alpha-epsilon-pledging-hazing_n_4938425.html Sigma Alpha Epsilon Bans Pledging Nationwide In Effort To Stop Hazing], as reported by the Huffington Post's Tyler Kingkade on 11 March 2014, accessed 11 June 2014</ref> While not limited to fraternities and sororities, harmful activities like underage drinking and hazing are often headlined as local news stories, with fraternity chapters as the most visible examples.<ref>Studies show that underage and binge drinking are more prevalent nationally among student athletes, Greek system members, and organization members, with the most significant grouping ''less'' affected by the problem being commuter students that live at home.

All sororities and some fraternity chapters have banned alcohol in their living facilities. National fraternities, through the [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|NIC]] and sororities through their national and local governing boards require member training each year to combat hazing, underage drinking, sexual assault and other harmful behaviors.<ref>[https://nicfraternity.org/nic-standards/ NIC Standards statement] accessed 21 Nov 2018.</ref> Hence, individual chapters are not alone in addressing these problems. Inter-chapter governing boards at Minnesota (listed below by chapter groupings) provide event monitoring services and local risk management training, culminating in the introduction in 2012 of '''Arkeo''', which serves as an inter-Greek cooperative monitoring program to help chapters avoid risk.<ref>[http://www.fsl.umn.edu/assets/pdf/comm_info/State%20of%20the%20Greek%20Sp%202013.pdf State of the Greek Community, 2013 Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040843/http://www.fsl.umn.edu/assets/pdf/comm_info/State%20of%20the%20Greek%20Sp%202013.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, accessed 11 June 2014</ref><ref name=\"DefyingCritics\">[http://www.fsl.umn.edu/parents/greek_sterotypes.html Office for Fraternity and Sorority Life risk management statement on \"Defying the Stereotypes\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714162943/http://www.fsl.umn.edu/parents/greek_sterotypes.html |date=2014-07-14 }}, accessed 12 June 2014</ref>\n\n====Response to perceptions====\n\nAs to the financial cost of participation, fraternity leaders note that the vast majority of Greek students work their way through school.<ref name=\"DefyingCritics\" /> In fact, the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life claims that the average cost burden for fraternity chapter membership adds 3% to a student budget, and may indeed be less costly on a net basis when factoring reduced summer rents and lower live-in costs versus dorms and private apartments. Finally, the Minnesota campus is markedly more residential than thirty years ago. Development of over a dozen large for-profit private dorms and many upgraded apartments has increased the average ''quality'' and ''quantity'' of near-campus housing ''and'' has increased their average expense. The result has been that fraternities and sororities, previously perceived as among the more expensive housing options now range from \"in line with\" or even lower than the average cost of dorms or apartments.<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/university-of-minnesota-sees-resurgence-of-interest-in-greek-life/223334431/ StarTrib article on resurgence of interest in Greek Life], accessed 4 Sept 2016</ref><ref name=\"2016 IFC Study\">For reference, see the 2016 Interfraternity Council recruitment book, p.8.

These average expenses both compare favorably to living in a private apartment with an average cost of $10,056, which does not include meals, parking or social events, and which requires a sublease if the apartment is vacated during the summer months. Sorority living expenses may be higher, with increased services. For further analysis of these costs, see University Housing Services. The analysis is more involved than can be fully treated here due to space limitations.</ref>\n\nAddressing the claim of exclusivity in recruitment materials, Greek leaders will accept that label as another way of saying they promote high standards. All fraternities are by definition self-selective.  But, they clarify, so are all friendships. Further, they state, \"U\" students all have passed a bar of exclusivity by getting into the increasingly selective University itself. With an array of student groups numbering in the thousands, and a multitude of Greek chapter personalities, fraternity and sorority proponents are confident that all students who wish to join a Greek society can find one where they can flourish.<ref name=\"DefyingCritics\" /> The matter of religious and race exclusivity appears to have passed several generations ago: While some chapters are historically black, Hispanic, or Asian-oriented, there is no race exclusivity or other discrimination exclusivity in any of Minnesota's chapters. All are integrated, and have been for some time. Minnesota was the second Big Ten school (after [[University of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]]) to see its fraternities and sororities drop all bias clauses (race, color or creed) from their bylaws and policies. Older chapters have been integrated since the 1950s and 1960s<ref name=\"HistoricalStudy2003\" /> and the multi-cultural Greek chapters since their founding in more recent years.<ref>[https://diversity.umn.edu/eoaa/ The University Department of Equal Opportunity] requires all members of University communities to adhere to this standard, but has not seen a need for intervention in Minnesota's fully integrated community of Greek chapters.

According to the \u0398\u039d\u0395 website, the ''Tau'' designation was \"fancied by the chapter,\" and ''Chi'' was also considered, before ''Alpha Epsilon'' was allowed.  \u0398\u039d\u0395's Wikipedia page notes (without clear citation) possible activity at Minnesota as late as 1934, which the lack of a ''Gopher'' record shows is unlikely.</ref><ref name=\"Theta Nu Epsilon perception\">Baird's and other sources note \u0398\u039d\u0395 was an ill-favored national due to its recruitment of sophomores who were already members of other fraternities, and a policy of secrecy about the active members - those same sophomores tapped each year. It was NOT an honorary, nor a service society. (Freshmen were discluded, juniors and seniors were advisoral only.) Hence, \u0398\u039d\u0395 became a bit of a pariah, and members were pressured to quit lest they be expelled from their primary fraternities at Minnesota (see \u03a6\u03a3\u039a Rand History); in 1913 the NIC advocated ''vigorously against'' its collegians joining \u0398\u039d\u0395. Struggling for a workable path to legitimacy, several varying models developed on \u0398\u039d\u0395's campuses, where some chapters became standard fraternities, and others public inter-fraternity groups. At Alabama it even became a political machine, while other chapters took yet other forms. Later, with adoption of changes, \u0398\u039d\u0395 briefly joined the NIC in the 1930s, but ceased operations after WWII. Several chapters reformed the society as a smaller entity, some becoming co-ed in the 1970s.

They are currently not grouped with the social fraternities and sororities.<ref name=\"OFSL2017\" /> However, some also associate with social fraternities and societies. They may also use of chapter and national organizational hierarchy, and their use of Greek Letters as identification. Some of these are populated by graduate students, a few exclusively so. As a rule, the honor and professional societies focus on specific academic, professional or service missions. Historically too there has been significant crossover and cooperation between types; some professional societies have revised themselves into non-residential honor groups. In contrast, several professional organizations have gone the other direction to conference among the academic and social chapters.<ref>This crossover is apparent in many examples: [[Alpha Gamma Rho]] fraternity became an [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|NIC]] member while ''retaining'' its membership in the [[Professional Fraternity Association|PHA]]. Born as a professional fraternity, by 1917 it had begun to operate as a social and academic fraternity, requiring 'exclusivity' of its members, i.e.: they couldn't be part of another social or academic society. In 1944 [[FarmHouse]] fraternity made a similar move. Like AGR, both retain a focus on agriculture. [[Delta Chi]] fraternity began as a Law fraternity, conferencing with similar societies it its early days, while by 1911 moving exclusively into what would become the NIC camp. Minnesota's was the fourth oldest chapter of this national and was a participant in this evolution. A number of multicultural fraternities such as [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] are members of both the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|NPHC]] as well as the NIC. [[Evans Scholars Foundation|Evans Scholars]], an honorary fraternity for golf caddies whose [http://minnesota.evansscholars.org/site/c.5nJIJQPnEhKWE/b.7924611/k.BD08/Home.htm Eta chapter] (accessed 3 Dec 2017) occupies a home among the undergraduate Greeks, operates as a social and academic residential chapter and maintains a full social schedule among the NIC and NPC fraternities and sororities. City codes group all such property-owning organizations together, regulating them as similar to boarding houses. Sale or rental of properties between groups has occurred cooperatively for well over a century. To summarize, rather than exhibiting hard-and-fast lines of demarcation that separate social, professional or honor types of organizations, these societies appear to flex, cooperate and adjust over time with the demands of participants, becoming more or less vigorous (residential, social, 'programmed') in a slow but steady evolution.</ref> But most remain oriented toward senior students (including 3rd and 4th year students) and graduate students. Social/academic fraternity or sorority membership is not a requirement for these groups. Individuals who meet a group's criteria may join or be \"tapped,\" or asked to join, as may non-Greek students.  Multiple affiliations may be allowable as membership is frequently not exclusive to one group - see individual societies for details.  Activity varies; some of the professional and service groups are residential, while the honors societies may meet only quarterly or annually, if at all. The cut-off line where any campus organization falls ''within'' these headings or ''without'' is by long-established convention; those formed prior to 1990 are listed under the subheadings used by various volumes of the [[Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities]], which for more than a century has been the data source of record for such organizations.  Newer groups have been placed in categories similar to Baird's. The latest version of Baird's, 1991,  was published ''before'' the national development of some of the societies here, and therefore, position and inclusion is, in some cases, assumptive.<ref name=\"Baird's\" />\n\n[[File:Phi Beta Kappa Key.png|thumb|right|x200px|The Phi Beta Kappa Key. Minnesota's chapter was formed in 1892.]]\n\n===[[Honor society|Honor and recognition societies]]===\nHonor societies recognize students who excel academically or as leaders among their peers, usually within a specific academic discipline. Because of the age, size and research focus of the University of Minnesota, it hosts a wide variety of these organizations. Members commonly include the society on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9/CV, which may serve to bolster grad school acceptance, publishing merit, and professional opportunities.\n\nListed by date of local founding with national conference membership, these are co-ed, non-residential, achievement-based organizations which self-select members based on published criteria.\n\nAt graduation, or at times of formal academic processionals, graduates, administrators, PhD holders and post-doctoral fellows wear [[Academic regalia in the United States|academic robes]] in the colors of their degree, school and other distinction, according to a voluntary Intercollegiate Code that governs customs such as formal academic regalia. In addition, various colored devices such as [[Academic stole|stoles]], [[Academic scarf|scarfs]], [[Honor cords|cords]], [[Square academic cap#tassel|tassels]], and medallions are used to indicate membership in a student's honor society; cords and [[Square academic cap|mortarboard]] tassels are most common. '''[[Phi Beta Kappa]]''', the first honor society, locally founded at Minnesota in 1892, has used {{color box|#FFC0CB}} [[Pink]] and {{color box|#87CEEB}} [[Sky blue]] since its national founding in 1776.  Hence, students tapped for \u03a6\u0392\u039a may wear tassels or other society-approved items, in these colors. Like most schools, the University of Minnesota allows such regalia for honor society members. Stoles are less common, but they are used by a few honor societies. In academic circles, colors are well-known, and follow long-standing protocols. [http://www.achsnatl.org/honor_cord_registry.asp The ACHS website lists the colors] for their 68 member organizations, and the [[Honor society]] WP page lists others. [[File:Graduating students.JPG|thumb|left|x160px|Multi-colored tassels, cords and stoles are noticeable over black graduation robes.]]<!--This photo should be updated to a free-use photo of University of Minnesota grads, showing honors colors-->\n\nMany honor societies invite students to become members based on scholastic rank (the top x% of a class) and/or grade point, either overall, or for classes taken within the discipline for which the honor society provides recognition. In cases where academic achievement would not be an appropriate criterion for membership, other standards are required for membership (such as completion of a particular ceremony or training program). These societies recognize ''past achievement.'' Pledging is ''not'' required, and new candidates may be immediately inducted into membership after meeting predetermined academic criteria and paying a one-time membership fee. Some require graduate enrollment.  Because of their purpose of recognition, most honor societies will have much higher academic achievement requirements for membership than professional societies. It is also common for a scholastic honor society to add a criterion relating to the character of the student. Some honor societies are ''invitation only'' while others allow unsolicited applications. Finally, membership in an honor society might be considered exclusive, i.e., a member of such an organization cannot join other honor societies representing the same field. Governance requires a faculty sponsor and each society remains faculty-guided, usually with alumni input.<br>\n(ACHS) indicates members of the [[Association of College Honor Societies]].\n\n'''''Active honor and recognition societies'''''\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-break|width=34%}}\n* '''\u03a6\u0394\u03a6''' - [[Phi Delta Phi]], 1891, legal honors<ref>Note, until 2012, \u03a6\u0394\u03a6 had nationally been a ''professional'' fraternity.

Some are residential in a co-operative fashion and all offer a moderate amount of social programming. Membership in a professional fraternity may be gained by the result of a pledge process, much like a social fraternity, and members are expected to remain loyal and active in the organization for life. Within their professional field of study, membership is exclusive; for example, if one joins a law society they cannot join another law society. However, these societies do initiate members who belong to social or honors fraternities. Professional Societies are known for networking and post-collegiate involvement, and membership is often included with pride on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9/CV.

He started his career at Bahman club and also played in Austrian, Emirati and Qatari clubs. He was a member of [[Iran national football team]] from 1996 to 2011, but not played many matches. In 2010, he was nominated for the [[Asian Footballer of the Year]] award which finished second in voting.\n\n==Club career==\nHaving played for [[Esteghlal F.C.|Esteghlal Tehran]] for several seasons, Majidi's performance attracted [[Rapid Vienna]] to recruit him for one season. However, the offer for a permanent transfer to Austria was not accepted by the Austrians, and they released Majidi who joined [[Al Wasl FC|Al-Wasl]] in the [[UAE]].\n\nIn the [[UAE League]] and in combination with his compatriot [[Alireza Vahedi Nikbakht]], Majidi scored a handful of goals and topped the league chart with Al Wasl. Majidi was unlucky with injuries and was out of action for quite a few matches. One of the highlights of Majidi's career was his short loan to [[Al Ain FC|Al-Ain]]. Majidi was the star of the [[2002\u201303 AFC Champions League]] semi-final game against [[Dalian Shide]]. His goal helped Al Ain to reach the [[AFC Champions League]] final match, eventually winning the trophy for the first time in the club's history.\n\nAll together in the five years Majidi played for Al Wasl FC, he scored over 100 goals.<ref name=\"goal\" /> He left Al Wasl in 2006, joining another UAE club, [[Al Nasr SC (Dubai)|Al-Nasr]].\n\nOn 10 February 2007, Majidi signed a contract until the end of the season with [[Al-Ahli (Dubai)|Al-Ahli]]. At the end of the season, Majidi signed a season-long contract with [[Esteghlal F.C.|Esteghlal tehran]]. He extended his contract with [[Esteghlal Tehran FC|Esteghlal tehran]] for two more season and he was mostly used as the attacking midfielder in [[2008\u201309 Iran Pro League|2008\u201309]] [[2008\u201309 Esteghlal F.C. season|season]] which ended up in winning the league. He had a very good season in 2009\u201310 season where he was the top scorer of the team and one of the top scorers of [[AFC Champions League|ACL]].\n\nOn 21 December 2011, Majidi left Esteghlal due to personal problems and joined the [[Qatar]]i side [[Al-Gharrafa Sports Club|Al Gharrafa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.varzesh3.com/news.do?itemid=62619&title=%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%8A_%D8%A8%D9%87_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%87_%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%B1_%D9%BE%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%AA|script-title=fa:\u0645\u062c\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0627\u0641\u0647 \u0642\u0637\u0631 \u067e\u064a\u0648\u0633\u062a|language=Persian |work=Varzesh3.com}}</ref> He played until the end of the season at Al Gharafa and his contract was expired on 1 July 2012.

Finally, Majidi retired for the second time as a football player on 29 October 2013 after Esteghlal was unable to qualified to the finals of the [[2013 AFC Champions League]].\n\n==International career==\nHe made his debut for Iran national football team in December 1996 in the [[1996 Asian Cup]] match against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]]. He was occasionally getting called up but never became a regular starter till the arrival of [[Branko Ivankovic]] where he was experiencing the top of his football. He was mostly benched by Ivankovic because of [[Ali Daei]] and [[Arash Borhani]] and decided to leave [[Team Melli]] camp in 2004 just before the [[2004 AFC Asian Cup]] where Iran lost the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification]] match against Jordan in Tehran and he was benched for the whole match. Before the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], he was called for a few friendlies but could not break it through to the tournament. Majidi was invited by [[Amir Ghalenoei]] and [[Afshin Ghotbi]] in 2006 and 2009 for the [[2007 AFC Asian Cup qualification]] and [[2011 AFC Asian Cup qualification]] for a couple of matches and was used as the substitute. He was called for few friendlies three months before [[2011 AFC Asian Cup]] but decided to announce his retirement. Majidi was again invited on 23 August 2011 by [[Carlos Queiroz]]. He was the oldest player in the Iran national team since he had been a member of the team since 1996, however Majidi does not have many international caps. Farhad Majidi and the [[Persepolis F.C.|Persepolis]] captain, [[Ali Karimi]], were considered two of the fans' favorite players during the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]]. On 27 September 2011, Majidi announced his retirement from national playing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/iran/news/1825/%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86/2011/09/27/2684880/%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%87-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D9%85%D8%AC%DB%8C%D8%AF%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%AE%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%B8%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%AA%DB%8C%D9%85-%D9%85%D9%84%DB%8C-%D9%86%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%85-%DA%A9%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D9%87|script-title=fa:\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0627\u062f \u0645\u062c\u06cc\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u062e\u062f\u0627\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u062a\u06cc\u0645 \u0645\u0644\u06cc|work=Goal.com |language=Persian}}</ref>\n\n==Career statistics==\n===Club career statistics===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Club performance\n! colspan=2 | League\n! colspan=2 | Cup\n\n! colspan=2 | Continental\n! colspan=2 | Total\n|-\n!

born 3 June 1976) is an [[Iran]]ian coach and retired [[association football|football]]er.\n\nHe mostly played as an [[attacking midfielder]] for Esteghlal when he was a football player. He started his career at Bahman club and also played in Austrian, Emirati and Qatari clubs. He was a member of [[Iran national football team]] from 1996 to 2011, but not played many matches. In 2010, he was nominated for the [[Asian Footballer of the Year]] award which finished second in voting.\n\n==Club career==\nHaving played for [[Esteghlal F.C.|Esteghlal Tehran]] for several seasons, Majidi's performance attracted [[Rapid Vienna]] to recruit him for one season. However, the offer for a permanent transfer to Austria was not accepted by the Austrians, and they released Majidi who joined [[Al Wasl FC|Al-Wasl]] in the [[UAE]].\n\nIn the [[UAE League]] and in combination with his compatriot [[Alireza Vahedi Nikbakht]], Majidi scored a handful of goals and topped the league chart with Al Wasl. Majidi was unlucky with injuries and was out of action for quite a few matches. One of the highlights of Majidi's career was his short loan to [[Al Ain FC|Al-Ain]]. Majidi was the star of the [[2002\u201303 AFC Champions League]] semi-final game against [[Dalian Shide]]. His goal helped Al Ain to reach the [[AFC Champions League]] final match, eventually winning the trophy for the first time in the club's history.\n\nAll together in the five years Majidi played for Al Wasl FC, he scored over 100 goals.<ref name=\"goal\">{{cite web | url=http://www.goal.com/iran/news/1825/%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86/2012/09/28/3409686/%DA%AF%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B4-%D9%88%DB%8C%DA%98%D9%87-%D9%86%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%81%D9%87-%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D9%85%D8%AC%DB%8C%D8%AF%DB%8C | title=\u06af\u0632\u0627\u0631\u0634 \u0648\u06cc\u0698\u0647: \u0646\u06af\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u062f\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062d\u0631\u0641\u0647 \u0627\u06cc \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0627\u062f \u0645\u062c\u06cc\u062f\u06cc | publisher=Goal.com | accessdate=31 January 2013 | date=28 September 2012}}</ref> He left Al Wasl in 2006, joining another UAE club, [[Al Nasr SC (Dubai)|Al-Nasr]].\n\nOn 10 February 2007, Majidi signed a contract until the end of the season with [[Al-Ahli (Dubai)|Al-Ahli]].

He had a very good season in 2009\u201310 season where he was the top scorer of the team and one of the top scorers of [[AFC Champions League|ACL]].\n\nOn 21 December 2011, Majidi left Esteghlal due to personal problems and joined the [[Qatar]]i side [[Al-Gharrafa Sports Club|Al Gharrafa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.varzesh3.com/news.do?itemid=62619&title=%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%8A_%D8%A8%D9%87_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%87_%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%B1_%D9%BE%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%AA|script-title=fa:\u0645\u062c\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0627\u0641\u0647 \u0642\u0637\u0631 \u067e\u064a\u0648\u0633\u062a|language=Persian |work=Varzesh3.com}}</ref> He played until the end of the season at Al Gharafa and his contract was expired on 1 July 2012.

Finally, Majidi retired for the second time as a football player on 29 October 2013 after Esteghlal was unable to qualified to the finals of the [[2013 AFC Champions League]].\n\n==International career==\nHe made his debut for Iran national football team in December 1996 in the [[1996 Asian Cup]] match against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]]. He was occasionally getting called up but never became a regular starter till the arrival of [[Branko Ivankovic]] where he was experiencing the top of his football. He was mostly benched by Ivankovic because of [[Ali Daei]] and [[Arash Borhani]] and decided to leave [[Team Melli]] camp in 2004 just before the [[2004 AFC Asian Cup]] where Iran lost the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification]] match against Jordan in Tehran and he was benched for the whole match. Before the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], he was called for a few friendlies but could not break it through to the tournament. Majidi was invited by [[Amir Ghalenoei]] and [[Afshin Ghotbi]] in 2006 and 2009 for the [[2007 AFC Asian Cup qualification]] and [[2011 AFC Asian Cup qualification]] for a couple of matches and was used as the substitute. He was called for few friendlies three months before [[2011 AFC Asian Cup]] but decided to announce his retirement. Majidi was again invited on 23 August 2011 by [[Carlos Queiroz]]. He was the oldest player in the Iran national team since he had been a member of the team since 1996, however Majidi does not have many international caps. Farhad Majidi and the [[Persepolis F.C.|Persepolis]] captain, [[Ali Karimi]], were considered two of the fans' favorite players during the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]]. On 27 September 2011, Majidi announced his retirement from national playing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/iran/news/1825/%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86/2011/09/27/2684880/%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%87-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D9%85%D8%AC%DB%8C%D8%AF%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%AE%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%B8%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%AA%DB%8C%D9%85-%D9%85%D9%84%DB%8C-%D9%86%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%85-%DA%A9%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D9%87|script-title=fa:\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0627\u062f \u0645\u062c\u06cc\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u062e\u062f\u0627\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u062a\u06cc\u0645 \u0645\u0644\u06cc|work=Goal.com |language=Persian}}</ref>\n\n==Career statistics==\n===Club career statistics===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Club performance\n! colspan=2 | League\n! colspan=2 | Cup\n\n! colspan=2 | Continental\n! colspan=2 | Total\n|-\n!

Although the country known as Italy [[Italian unification|did not unite until the 19th century]], the cuisine can claim traceable roots as far back as the 4th century BC. Food and culture were very important at that time as we can see from the cookbook ([[Apicius]]) which dates back to first century BC.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Italian Food|url=http://www.yourguidetoitaly.com/history-of-italian-food-cuisine.html|website=yourguidetoitaly.com}}</ref> Through the centuries, neighbouring regions, conquerors, high-profile chefs, political upheaval, and the discovery of the [[New World]] have influenced its development. Italian food started to form after [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|the fall]] of the [[Roman Empire]], when different cities [[Italian city-states|began to separate]] and form their own traditions. Many different types of [[bread]] and [[pasta]] were made, and there was a variation in cooking techniques and preparation. The country was split. Regional cuisine is represented by some of the major cities in Italy. For example, [[Milan]] (north of Italy) is known for its [[risotto]]s, [[Bologna]] (the central/middle of the country) is known for its [[tortellini]] and [[Naples]] (the south) is famous for its [[pizza]]s<ref>[http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/showassoc_eng.php?id=140 First pizzeria was settled in Naples]</ref> and [[spaghetti]]s.\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n{{See also|Ancient Roman cuisine|Food and dining in the Roman Empire}}\n\nThe first known Italian [[food writer]] was a [[Greek people|Greek]] [[Sicily|Sicilian]] named [[Archestratus]] from [[Province of Syracuse|Syracuse]] in the 4th century BC. He wrote a poem that spoke of using \"top quality and seasonal\" ingredients. He said that flavors should not be masked by [[spice]]s, [[herb]]s or other [[seasonings]]. He placed importance on simple preparation of [[fish]].<ref name=\"Del Conte, 11\">Del Conte, 11.</ref>\n\nSimplicity was abandoned and [[Food and dining in the Roman Empire|replaced by a culture of gastronomy as the Roman Empire developed]]. By the time ''[[De re coquinaria]]'' was published in the 1st century AD, it contained 470 recipes calling for heavy use of spices and herbs. The Romans employed Greek bakers to produce [[bread]]s and imported cheeses from Sicily as the Sicilians had a reputation as the best [[cheesemaker]]s. The Romans reared [[goat]]s for [[butcher]]ing, and grew [[artichoke]]s and [[leek]]s.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 11\" />\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n{{See also|Medieval cuisine}}\n[[File:Fortezza Verrucole Archeopark interno.jpg|thumb|left|A restored medieval kitchen inside [[Verrucole Castle]], Tuscany.]]\nWith culinary traditions from [[Rome]] and [[Athens]], a cuisine developed in [[Sicily]] that some consider the first real Italian cuisine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} [[Arab]]s invaded Sicily in the 9th century, introducing [[spinach]], [[almond]]s, and [[rice]].<ref name=\"Harmon\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/18/garden/arab-sicilian-food-tale-of-1001-years.html|title=Arab-Sicilian Food: Tale of 1,001 Years|last=Jenkins|first=Nancy Harmon|date=18 October 1989|work=The New York Times|access-date=3 May 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> During the 12th century, a [[Normans|Norman]] king surveyed Sicily and saw people making long strings made from [[flour]] and water called ''atriya'', which eventually became ''trii'', a term still used for spaghetti in southern Italy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.deliciousitaly.com/sicily-food-wine/arab-culinary-influence-in-sicilian-food|title=Arab Culinary Influence in Sicilian Food|last=Team|first=Delicious Italy|access-date=3 May 2017|language=en-gb}}</ref> [[Normans]] also introduced the [[casserole]], [[salt cod]] (baccal\u00e0), and [[stockfish]], all of which remain popular.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 12\">Del Conte, 12.</ref>\n\n[[Food preservation]] was either chemical or physical, as [[refrigeration]] did not exist. Meats and fish were [[smoking (cooking)|smoked]], dried, or kept on ice. [[Brine]] and [[salt]] were used to [[pickling|pickle]] items such as [[herring]], and to cure [[pork]]. [[Root vegetable]]s were preserved in brine after they had been [[parboiled]]. Other means of preservation included [[oil]], [[vinegar]], or immersing meat in congealed, rendered fat. For preserving fruits, [[liquor]], honey, and sugar were used.<ref>Capatti, 253\u2013254.</ref>\n\nThe northern Italian regions show a mix of [[Germany|Germanic]] and [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] while the south reflects Arab<ref name=\"Harmon\" /> influence, as much [[Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean cuisine]] was spread by Arab trade.<ref>Capatti, 2\u20134.</ref> The oldest Italian book on cuisine is the 13th century ''Liber de coquina'' written in [[Naples]]. Dishes include \"Roman-style\" [[cabbage]] (''ad usum romanorum''), ''ad usum campanie'' which were \"small leaves\" prepared in the \"Campanian manner\", a bean dish from the Marca di Trevisio, a ''torta'', ''compositum londardicum'' which are similar to dishes prepared today. Two other books from the 14th century include recipes for Roman ''pastello'', Lasagna pie, and call for the use of [[salt]] from [[Sardinia]] or [[Chioggia]].<ref>Capatti, 6.</ref>\n[[File:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saffron]] has been used in Italy for centuries]]\n\nIn the 15th century, [[Maestro Martino]] was chef to the [[Patriarch of Aquileia]] at the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. His ''Libro de arte coquinaria'' describes a more refined and elegant cuisine. His book contains a recipe for ''Maccaroni Siciliani'', made by wrapping dough around a thin iron rod to dry in the sun. The macaroni was cooked in [[capon]] stock flavored with [[saffron]], displaying [[Iran|Persian]] influences. Of particular note is Martino's avoidance of excessive spices in favor of fresh herbs.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 12\" /> The Roman recipes include ''coppiette'' (air-dried salami) and cabbage dishes. His [[Florence|Florentine]] dishes include eggs with ''Bolognese torta'', ''Sienese torta'' and [[Genoa|Genoese]] recipes such as ''piperata'' (sweets), macaroni, [[squash (plant)|squash]], [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], and [[spinach]] pie with [[onion]]s.<ref>Capatti, 9\u201310.</ref>\n\nMartino's text was included in a 1475 book by [[Bartolomeo Platina]] printed in [[Venice]] entitled ''[[De honesta voluptate et valetudine]]'' (\"On Honest Pleasure and Good Health\"). Platina puts Martino's \"Libro\" in regional context, writing about [[perch]] from [[Lake Maggiore]], [[sardine]]s from [[Lake Garda]], [[Grayling (genus)|grayling]] from [[Adda (river)|Adda]], hens from [[Padua]], [[olive]]s from [[Bologna]] and [[Picenum|Piceno]], [[turbot]] from [[Ravenna]], [[rudd]] from [[Lake Trasimeno]], [[carrot]]s from [[Viterbo]], [[bass (fish)|bass]] from the [[Tiber]], ''roviglioni'' and [[shad]] from [[Lake Albano]], [[snail]]s from [[Rieti]], [[ficus|figs]] from Tuscolo, [[grape]]s from [[Narni]], [[oil]] from [[Cassino]], [[orange (fruit)|oranges]] from [[Naples]] and [[Moray eel|eels]] from [[Campania]]. Grains from [[Lombardy]] and Campania are mentioned as is [[honey]] from Sicily and Taranto. [[Wine]] from the Ligurian coast, [[Greco (grape)|Greco]] from Tuscany and [[Centola|San Severino]], and [[Trebbiano]] from Tuscany and [[Picenum|Piceno]] are also mentioned in the book.<ref>Capatti, 10.</ref>\n\n=== Early modern era ===\nThe courts of [[Florence]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]], and [[Ferrara]] were central to the cuisine. [[Cristoforo di Messisbugo]], steward to [[Ippolito d'Este]], published ''Banchetti Composizioni di Vivande'' in 1549. Messisbugo gives recipes for pies and tarts (containing 124 recipes with various fillings). The work emphasizes the use of Eastern spices and sugar.<ref>Del Conte, 13.</ref>\n\n[[File:Scappi.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.6|[[Bartolomeo Scappi]], personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]]]]\nIn 1570, [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]], wrote his ''Opera'' in five volumes, giving a comprehensive view of Italian cooking of that period. It contains over 1,000 recipes, with information on banquets including displays and menus as well as illustrations of kitchen and table utensils. This book differs from most books written for the royal courts in its preference for domestic animals and courtyard birds rather than game.\n\nRecipes include lesser cuts of meats such as tongue, head, and shoulder.

The final volume includes pies, tarts, fritters, and a recipe for a sweet Neapolitan [[pizza]] (not the current savory version, as tomatoes had not yet been introduced to Italy).

Originally from [[Modena]], Castelvetro moved to England because he was a [[Protestant]]. The book lists Italian vegetables and fruits along with their preparation. He featured vegetables as a central part of the meal, not just as accompaniments.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\" /> Castelvetro favored simmering vegetables in salted water and serving them warm or cold with olive oil, salt, fresh ground pepper, [[lemon]] juice, [[verjus]], or [[orange juice]]. He also suggested roasting vegetables wrapped in damp paper over charcoal or embers with a drizzle of olive oil. Castelvetro's book is separated into seasons with hop shoots in the spring and [[truffles]] in the winter, detailing the use of [[pigs]] in the search for truffles.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\" />[[File:Arte di ben cucinare.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.6|''L'arte di Ben Cucinare'' published by Bartolomeo Stefani in 1662]]\n\nIn 1662, Bartolomeo Stefani, chef to the [[Duchy of Mantua]], published ''L'Arte di Ben Cucinare''. He was the first to offer a section on ''vitto ordinario'' (\"ordinary food\"). The book described a banquet given by Duke [[Charles III, Duke of Mantua|Charles]] for Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], with details of the food and table settings for each guest, including a knife, fork, spoon, glass, a plate (instead of the bowls more often used), and a napkin.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 15\">Del Conte, 15.</ref>\n\nOther books from this time, such as ''Galatheo'' by [[Giovanni della Casa]], tell how ''scalci'' (\"waiters\") should manage themselves while serving their guests. Waiters should not scratch their heads or other parts of themselves, or spit, sniff, cough or sneeze while serving diners. The book also told diners not to use their fingers while eating and not to wipe sweat with their napkin.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 15\" />\n\n=== Modern era ===\n[[File:Apicius 1709.JPG|thumb|left|upright= 0.7|''[[Apicius]]'', ''[[De re coquinaria]]'' (\"On the Subject of Cooking\"), 1709 edition.]]\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Italian culinary books began to emphasize the regionalism of Italian cuisine rather than [[French cuisine]]. Books written then were no longer addressed to professional chefs but to [[bourgeois]] housewives.<ref>De Conte, 16</ref> Periodicals in booklet form such as ''La cuoca cremonese'' (''The Cook of Cremona'') in 1794 give a sequence of ingredients according to season along with chapters on meat, fish, and vegetables.

It was believed by some that peasants ate poorly because they preferred eating poorly. However, many peasants had to eat rotten food and moldy bread because that was all they could afford.<ref>Capatti, 282\u2013284.</ref>\n\nIn 1779, Antonio Nebbia from [[Macerata]] in the [[Marche]] region, wrote ''Il Cuoco Maceratese'' (''The Cook of Macerata''). Nebbia addressed the importance of local vegetables and [[pasta]], rice, and [[gnocchi]]. For stock, he preferred vegetables and chicken over other meats.\n\nIn 1773, the Neapolitan Vincenzo Corrado's ''Il Cuoco Galante'' (''The Courteous Cook'') gave particular emphasis to v''itto pitagorico'' (vegetarian food). \"Pythagorean food consists of fresh herbs, roots, flowers, fruits, seeds and all that is produced in the earth for our nourishment. It is so called because [[Pythagoras]], as is well known, only used such produce. There is no doubt that this kind of food appears to be more natural to man, and the use of meat is noxious.\" This book was the first to give the tomato a central role with thirteen recipes.\n[[File:Tomato2 002.jpg|thumb|Tomatoes are a typical part of Italian cuisine, but only entered common usage in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Gentilcore2010\">{{cite book |last=Gentilcore |first=David |title=Pomodoro!: A History of the Tomato in Italy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZgEvOPTQLsC |accessdate=24 February 2013 |date=15 June 2010|publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-15206-8|page=x}}</ref>]]\n\n''Zuppa alli pomidoro'' in Corrado's book is a dish similar to today's Tuscan [[pappa al pomodoro]].

In 1829, ''Il Nuovo Cuoco Milanese Economico'' by Giovanni Felice Luraschi featured [[Milan]]ese dishes such as kidney with [[anchovies]] and lemon and [[gnocchi]] alla Romana. Gian Battista and Giovanni Ratto's ''La Cucina Genovese'' in 1871 addressed the cuisine of [[Liguria]]. This book contained the first recipe for [[pesto]].

In [[Tuscany]], pasta (especially [[pappardelle]]) is traditionally served with meat sauce (including game meat). In [[Southern Italy]], tomatoes&nbsp;(fresh or cooked into tomato sauce), [[Capsicum|peppers]], olives and [[olive oil]], garlic, [[artichoke]]s, oranges, [[ricotta cheese]], [[eggplants]], [[zucchini]], certain types of [[fish]] (anchovies, sardines and tuna), and capers are important components to the local cuisine.\n\nItalian cuisine is also well known (and well regarded) for its use of a diverse variety of pasta. Pasta include noodles in various lengths, widths, and shapes. Most pastas may be distinguished by the shapes for which they are named\u2014[[penne]], [[maccheroni]], [[spaghetti]], [[linguine]], [[fusilli]], [[lasagne]], and many more varieties that are filled with other ingredients like [[ravioli]] and [[tortellini]].\n\nThe word pasta is also used to refer to dishes in which pasta products are a primary ingredient. It is usually served with sauce. There are hundreds of different shapes of pasta with at least locally recognized names.\n\nExamples include [[spaghetti]] (thin rods), [[rigatoni]] (tubes or cylinders), [[fusilli]] (swirls), and [[lasagne]] (sheets). Dumplings, like [[gnocchi]] (made with potatoes or pumpkin) and noodles like [[sp\u00e4tzle]], are sometimes considered pasta. They are both traditional in parts of Italy.\n\nPasta is categorized in two basic styles: dried and fresh. Dried pasta made without eggs can be stored for up to two years under ideal conditions, while fresh pasta will keep for a couple of days in the refrigerator. Pasta is generally cooked by boiling. Under Italian law, dry pasta (pasta secca) can only be made from [[durum wheat]] flour or durum wheat [[semolina]], and is more commonly used in Southern Italy compared to their Northern counterparts, who traditionally prefer the fresh egg variety.\n\nDurum flour and durum semolina have a yellow tinge in color. Italian pasta is traditionally cooked ''al dente'' (Italian: ''firm to the bite'', meaning not too soft). Outside Italy, dry pasta is frequently made from other types of flour, but this yields a softer product. There are many types of wheat flour with varying gluten and protein levels depending on variety of grain used.\n\nParticular varieties of pasta may also use other grains and milling methods to make the flour, as specified by law. Some pasta varieties, such as [[pizzoccheri]], are made from [[buckwheat]] flour. Fresh pasta may include eggs (''pasta all'uovo'' \"egg pasta\"). Whole wheat pasta has become increasingly popular because of its supposed health benefits over pasta made from refined flour.\n\n== Regional variation ==\nEach area [[List of Italian dishes|has its own specialties]], primarily at a regional level, but also at provincial level. The differences can come from a bordering country (such as France or Austria), whether a region is close to the sea or the mountains, and economics.<ref name=HazanIntroduction>{{cite book |last1=Hazan |first1=Marcella|authorlink1=Marcella Hazan|date=27 October 1992|title=Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking |publisher=Knopf |isbn=978-0394584041 |edition=1st |url=http://knopfdoubleday.com/book/77517/essentials-of-classic-italian-cooking/ |accessdate=2 November 2015|format=Kindle and printed. |chapter=Introduction|quote=...Italian cooking?

The [[Romagna]] subregion is renowned for pasta dishes like ''[[cappelletti]]'', ''[[garganelli]]'', ''[[strozzapreti]]'', ''sfoglia lorda,'' and ''tortelli alla lastra'' as well as cheeses such as [[:it:squacquerone|squacquerone]], [[Piadina]] snacks are also a specialty of the subregion.\n\nIn the [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]] subregion, except [[Piacenza]] which is heavily influenced by the cuisines of [[Lombardy]], rice is eaten to a lesser extent. ''[[Polenta]]'', a maize-based dish, is common in both Emilia and Romagna.\n\n[[File:Tagliatelle al ragu Bolognese.jpg|thumb|''Tagliatelle'' with [[bolognese sauce|rag\u00f9]]]]\n[[Bologna]] and [[Modena]] are notable for pasta dishes like ''[[tortellini]]'', ''[[lasagne verdi|lasagne]]'', gramigna, and ''[[tagliatelle]]'' which are found also in many other parts of the region in different declinations. The celebrated [[balsamic vinegar]] is made only in the Emilian cities of [[Modena]] and [[Reggio Emilia]], following legally binding traditional procedures.<ref>Piras, 187.</ref> [[Parmigiano Reggiano]] cheese is produced in Reggio Emilia, Parma, Modena, and Bologna and is often used in cooking. [[Grana Padano]] cheese is produced in Piacenza.\n\nAlthough the Adriatic coast is a major fishing area (well known for its eels and clams), the region is more famous for its meat products, especially pork-based, that include Parma's ''[[prosciutto]]'', ''[[culatello]],'' and ''[[Felino]] salami''; Piacenza's ''[[pancetta]]'', ''[[capicola|coppa]],'' and salami; Bologna's ''[[mortadella]]'' and ''salame rosa''; Modena's ''[[zampone]]'', ''[[cotechino]],'' and ''[[:it:cappello del prete|cappello del prete]]''; and [[Ferrara]]'s ''[[:it:salama da sugo|salama da sugo]]''. Piacenza is also known for some dishes prepared with horse and donkey meat. Regional desserts include ''[[zuppa inglese]]'' (custard-based dessert made with sponge cake and [[Alchermes]] liqueur) and ''[[panpepato]]'' (Christmas cake made with pepper, chocolate, spices, and almonds).\n\n=== Friuli-Venezia Giulia ===\n[[File:Jota 02.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Istrian stew|Jota]]'' is a traditional stew in the [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Venezia Giulia]] region]]\n\n[[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] conserved, in its cuisine, the historical links with [[Austria-Hungary]]. [[Province of Udine|Udine]] and [[Province of Pordenone|Pordenone]], in the western part of Friuli, are known for their traditional [[San Daniele del Friuli]] [[ham]], [[Montasio]] cheese, and [[Frico]] cheese. Other typical dishes are ''[[pitina]]'' (meatballs made of smoked meats), game, and various types of ''[[gnocchi]]'' and ''[[polenta]]''.\n\nThe majority of the eastern regional dishes are heavily influenced by Austrian, Hungarian, Slovene and Croatian cuisines: typical dishes include [[Istrian Stew]] (soup of beans, sauerkraut, potatoes, bacon, and spare ribs), [[Vienna sausages]], ''[[goulash]]'', ''[[\u0107evapi]]'', [[apple strudel]], ''[[gugelhupf]]''. Pork can be spicy and is often prepared over an open hearth called a ''fogolar''. [[Collio Goriziano]], [[Friuli Isonzo]], [[Colli Orientali del Friuli]], and [[Ramandolo]] are well-known [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]] regional wines.\n\n=== Liguria ===\n[[File:Rosemary Focaccia.jpg|thumb|''[[Focaccia]]'' with rosemary. Focaccia is widely associated with Ligurian cuisine]]\n\n[[Liguria]] is known for herbs and vegetables (as well as seafood) in its cuisine. [[Umami|Savory]] pies are popular, mixing greens and [[artichoke]]s along with cheeses, milk curds, and eggs. [[Onion]]s and [[olive oil]] are used. Because of a lack of land suitable for wheat, the Ligurians use [[chickpea]]s in ''[[farinata]]'' and polenta-like ''[[panissa]]''. The former is served plain or topped with onions, [[artichoke]]s, sausage, cheese or young anchovies.<ref name=\"Piras, 167, 177\">Piras, 167, 177.</ref>\n\nHilly districts use [[chestnut]]s as a source of carbohydrates. Ligurian pastas include ''corzetti'' from the [[Val Polcevera|Polcevera valley]]; ''pansoti'', a triangular shaped ravioli filled with vegetables; ''piccagge'', pasta ribbons made with a small amount of egg and served with artichoke sauce or ''[[pesto]]'' sauce; ''[[trenette]]'', made from [[whole wheat flour]] cut into long strips and served with pesto; boiled beans and potatoes; and ''trofie'', a Ligurian ''[[gnocchi]]'' made from whole grain flour and boiled potatoes, made into a spiral shape and often tossed in ''pesto''.<ref name=\"Piras, 167, 177\" /> Many Ligurians emigrated to [[Argentina]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, influencing the cuisine of the country (which was otherwise dominated by meat and dairy products that the narrow Ligurian hinterland would have not allowed).\n\n=== Lazio ===\n{{Main|Roman cuisine}}\n[[File:Spaghetti carbonara.jpg|right|thumb|Spaghetti ''[[carbonara|alla carbonara]]'']]\n\nPasta dishes based on the use of ''[[guanciale]]'' (unsmoked bacon prepared with pig's jowl or cheeks) are often found in [[Lazio]], such as pasta [[carbonara|''alla carbonara'']] and pasta ''[[Sugo all'amatriciana|all'amatriciana]]''. Another pasta dish of the region is ''[[arrabbiata]]'', with spicy tomato sauce. The regional cuisine widely use offal, resulting in dishes like the entrail-based ''[[rigatoni]]'' with ''[[rigatoni con la Pajata|pajata]]'' sauce and ''[[coda alla vaccinara]]''.<ref name=\"Piras, 291\">Piras, 291.</ref>\n\nIconic of Lazio is cheese made from ewes' milk ([[Pecorino Romano]]), ''[[porchetta]]'' (savory, fatty, and moist boneless pork roast) and [[Frascati DOC|Frascati]] white wine. The influence of the ancient [[Jewish]] community can be noticed in the Roman cuisine's traditional ''[[carciofi alla giudia]]''.<ref name=\"Piras, 291\" />\n\n=== Lombardy ===\n{{Main|Lombard cuisine}}\n[[File:Risotto giallo (6954045202).jpg|upright= 0.9|left|thumb|''[[Risotto]] alla milanese'' with saffron]]\n\nThe regional cuisine of [[Lombardy]] is heavily based upon ingredients like maize, rice, beef, pork, butter, and lard. Rice dishes are very popular in this region, often found in soups as well as ''[[risotto]]''. The best-known version is ''risotto alla milanese'', flavoured with saffron and typically served with many typical Milanese main courses, such as ''[[ossobuco]] alla milanese'' (cross-cut veal shanks braised with vegetables, white wine and broth) and ''[[cotoletta]] alla milanese'' (a fried cutlet similar to [[Wiener schnitzel]], but cooked \"bone-in\").<ref name=\"Piras, 87\">Piras, 87.</ref>\n\nOther regional specialities include ''[[cassoeula]]'' (a typical winter dish prepared with cabbage and pork), [[Cremona]]'s [[Mostarda]] (rich condiment made with candied fruit and a mustard flavoured syrup), [[Valtellina]]'s [[bresaola]] (air-dried salted beef) and [[pizzoccheri]] (a flat ribbon pasta made with 80% buckwheat flour and 20% wheat flour cooked along with greens, cubed potatoes, and layered with pieces of Valtellina Casera cheese), and [[Mantua]]'s ''tortelli di zucca'' (''[[ravioli]]'' with pumpkin filling) accompanied by melted butter and followed by turkey stuffed with chicken or other stewed meats.<ref name=\"Piras, 87\" />\n\nRegional cheeses include [[Robiola]], [[Crescenza]], [[Taleggio (cheese)|Taleggio]], [[Gorgonzola cheese|Gorgonzola]], and [[Grana Padano]] (the plains of central and southern Lombardy allow intensive cattle farming). ''[[Polenta]]'' is common across the region. Regional desserts include the famous ''[[panettone]]'' Christmas cake (sweet bread with candied orange, citron, and lemon zest, as well as raisins, which are added dry and not soaked).\n\n=== Marche ===\nOn the coast of [[Marche]], fish and seafood are produced. Inland, wild and domestic pigs are used for sausages and [[ham]]s. These hams are not thinly sliced, but cut into bite-sized chunks. [[Suckling pig]], [[chicken]], and [[fish]] are often stuffed with [[rosemary]] or [[fennel]] fronds and [[garlic]] before being roasted or placed on the spit.<ref>Piras, 273</ref>\n\nAscoli, Marche's southernmost province, is well known for ''olive all'ascolana'', (stoned olives stuffed with several minced meats, egg, and Parmesan, then fried).<ref name=\"GURI\">[http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/deleghe/10061dl.htm] Provvedimento 15 febbraio 2006: Iscrizione della denominazione \u00abOliva Ascolana del Piceno\u00bb nel registro delle denominazioni di origine protette e delle indicazioni geografiche protette, ''GURI n. 46''</ref> Another well-known Marche product are the ''[[:it:Maccheroncini di Campofilone|Maccheroncini di Campofilone]]'', from little town of [[Campofilone]], a kind of hand-made pasta made only of hard grain flour and eggs, cut so thin that melts in one's mouth.\n\n=== Piedmont ===\n[[File:Agnolotti.JPG|thumb|left|Traditional Piedmontese ''[[agnolotti]]'']]\n\nBetween the Alps and the [[Po valley]], featuring a large number of different ecosystems, the Piedmont region offers the most refined and varied cuisine of the Italian peninsula. As a point of union between traditional Italian and French cuisine, [[Piedmont]] is the Italian region with the largest number of cheeses with [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|protected geographical status]] and wines under [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]]. It is also the region where both the [[Slow Food]] association and the most prestigious school of Italian cooking, the [[University of Gastronomic Sciences]], were founded.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Davide paolini,''Prodotti Tipici D'Italia'', Garzanti.</ref>\n\n[[Piedmont]] is a region where gathering nuts, [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], and [[cardoon]]s, as well as [[hunting]] and [[fishing]] are common place.

Wines from the [[Nebbiolo]] grape such as [[Barolo]] and [[Barbaresco]] are produced as well as wines from the [[Barbera]] grape, fine [[sparkling wine]]s, and the sweet, lightly sparkling, [[Moscato d'Asti]]. The region is also famous for its [[Vermouth]] and [[Ratafia]] production.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n[[Castelmagno (cheese)|Castelmagno]] is a prized cheese of the region. Piedmont is also famous for the quality of its [[Carr\u00f9]] beef (particularly ''bue grasso'', \"fat ox\"), hence the tradition of eating raw meat seasoned with garlic oil, lemon, and salt; [[carpaccio]]; Brasato al vino, wine stew made from marinated beef; and boiled beef served with various sauces.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe food most typical of the Piedmont tradition are the traditional ''[[agnolotti]]'' (pasta folded over with roast beef and vegetable stuffing), ''paniscia'' (a typical dish of [[Novara]], a kind of [[risotto]] with [[Arborio rice]] or [[Maratelli]] rice, the typical kind of [[Saluggia]] beans, onion, [[Barbera]] wine, lard, salami, season vegetables, salt and pepper), ''[[taglierini]]'' (thinner version of tagliatelle), ''[[bagna cauda]]'' (sauce of garlic, anchovies, olive oil, and butter), and ''[[bicerin]]'' (hot drink made of coffee, chocolate, and whole milk). Piedmont is one of the Italian capitals of pastry and chocolate in particular, with products like [[Nutella]], ''[[gianduiotto]]'', and ''[[marron glac\u00e9]]'' that are famous worldwide.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n=== Sardinia ===\n{{Main|Sardinian cuisine}}\n[[File:Pasta e dolci.jpg|thumb|left|top|An exhibition of typical Sardinian pasta shapes, [[cake]]s, and [[Pastry|pastries]]]]\n\nSuckling pig and wild boar are roasted on the spit or boiled in stews of beans and vegetables, thickened with bread.

Legumes, bread, cheese, vegetables, mushrooms, and fresh [[fruit]] are used. A good example of typical Tuscan food is ''[[ribollita]]'', a notable soup whose name literally means \"reboiled\". Like most Tuscan cuisine, the soup has peasant origins. ''Ribollita'' was originally made by reheating (i.e. reboiling) the leftover ''[[minestrone]]'' or vegetable soup from the previous day. There are many variations but the main ingredients always include leftover bread, cannellini beans, and inexpensive vegetables such as carrot, cabbage, beans, [[Chard|silverbeet]], ''[[cavolo nero]]'' (Tuscan kale), onion, and olive oil.\n\nA regional Tuscan pasta known as ''[[pici]]'' resembles thick, grainy-surfaced spaghetti, and is often rolled by hand. White [[truffle]]s from [[San Miniato]] appear in October and November. High-quality beef, used for the traditional [[Florentine steak]], come from the [[Chianina]] cattle breed of the [[Chiana Valley]] and the [[Maremmana]] from [[Maremma]].\n\nPork is also produced.<ref>Piras, 221\u2013239.</ref> The region is well-known also for its rich [[Game (food)|game]], especially [[wild boar]], [[European hare|hare]], [[fallow deer]], [[roe deer]], and [[pheasant]] that often are used to prepare ''[[pappardelle]]'' dishes.

Fish and seafood are added in regions closer to the coast while [[pumpkin]], [[asparagus]], [[radicchio]], and [[frog legs]] appear farther away from the [[Adriatic Sea]].\n\nMade from finely ground maize meal, [[polenta]] is a traditional, rural food typical of Veneto and most of [[Northern Italy]]. It may be included in stirred dishes and baked dishes. Polenta can be served with various cheese, stockfish, or meat dishes. Some polenta dishes include [[Boletus edulis|porcini]], [[rapini]], or other vegetables or meats, such as small [[song-bird]]s in the case of the [[Veneto|Venetian]] and [[Lombardy|Lombard]] dish ''polenta e osei'', or [[sausage]]s. In some areas of Veneto it can be also made of a particular variety of cornmeal, named ''biancoperla'', so that the color of polenta is white and not yellow (the so-called ''polenta bianca'').\n[[File:Polenta con sopressa e funghi.jpg|thumb|''[[Polenta]]'' served with ''[[sopressa]]'' and mushrooms, a traditional [[peasant food]] of Veneto]]\n\n[[Bean]]s, [[pea]]s, and other [[legume]]s are seen in these areas with ''[[pasta e fagioli]]'' (beans and pasta) and ''risi e bisi'' ([[rice and peas]]). Venice features heavy dishes using exotic spices and sauces. Ingredients such as [[stockfish]] or simple marinated [[Anchovy (food)|anchovies]] are found here as well.\n\nLess fish and more meat is eaten away from the coast. Other typical products are sausages such as [[Sopressa|Soppressa Vicentina]], garlic salami, [[Piave cheese]], and [[Asiago cheese]]. High quality vegetables are prized, such as red [[radicchio]] from [[Treviso]] and white asparagus from [[Bassano del Grappa]]. Perhaps the most popular dish of [[Venice]] is ''[[liver and onions|fegato alla veneziana]]'', thinly-sliced veal liver sauteed with onions.\n\n[[Squid]] and [[cuttlefish]] are common ingredients, as is squid ink, called ''nero di seppia''.<ref>Piras, 33.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillmanwonders.com/cuisines/venice_cuisine.htm |title=Venice Cuisine \u2013 by food author Howard Hillman |publisher=Hillmanwonders.com |date= |accessdate=4 April 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080611081454/http://www.hillmanwonders.com/cuisines/venice_cuisine.htm |archivedate = 11 June 2008}}</ref> Regional desserts include ''[[tiramisu]]'' (made of biscuits dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of [[egg yolks]] and ''[[mascarpone]]'', and flavored with liquor and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]]<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = history of tiramisu\n |url         = http://www.annamariavolpi.com/page38.html\n |accessdate  = 16 August 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20120604101928/http://www.annamariavolpi.com/page38.html\n |archivedate = 4 June 2012\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>), ''[[baicoli]]'' (biscuits made with butter and vanilla), and [[nougat]].\n\nThe most celebrated Venetian wines include [[Bardolino]], [[Prosecco]], [[Soave (wine)|Soave]], [[Amarone]], and [[Valpolicella]] [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]] wines.\n\n== Meal structure ==\n{{Main|Meal structure in Italy}}\n[[File:Cafe con leche y cruas\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|A typical Italian breakfast, consisting of ''[[cappuccino]]'' and brioche / croissant / cornetto.]]\nTraditional meals in Italy typically contained four or five courses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://toscanaslc.com/blog/guide-to-the-traditional-italian-meal-structure/|title=Guide to the Traditional Italian Meal Structure|date=22 September 2015|work=Cucina Toscana|access-date=15 May 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> Especially on weekends, meals are often seen as a time to spend with family and friends rather than simply for sustenance; thus, meals tend to be longer than in other cultures.

The ''primo'' (first course) is usually a filling dish such as risotto or pasta, with sauces made from meat, vegetables, or seafood. Whole pieces of meat such as sausages, meatballs, poultry are eaten in the secondo. Italian cuisine has some single-course meals (''piatto unico'') combining starches and proteins. Contorni of vegetables and starches are served on a separate plate and not on the plate with the meat as is done in northern European Style serving.\n[[File:Prosecco-gold-arrangement-1.jpg|thumb|upright|A bottle of sparkling [[Prosecco]], which one would have as an ''aperitivo'']]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Meal stage\n!Composition\n|-\n|Aperitivo\n|[[ap\u00e9ritif]] usually enjoyed as an appetizer before a large meal, may be: [[Campari]], [[Martini (vermouth)|Martini]], [[Cinzano]], [[Amaro Lucano|Lucano]], [[Prosecco]], [[Aperol]], [[Spritz (alcoholic beverage)|Spritz]], [[Vermouth]], [[Negroni]].\n|-\n|Antipasto\n|literally \"before (the) meal\", hot or cold, usually consist of cheese, ham, sliced sausage, marinated vegetables or fish, bruschetta and bread [[appetizer]]s.\n|-\n|Primo\n|\"first course\", usually consists of a hot dish like pasta, risotto, gnocchi, or soup with a sauce, vegetarian, meat or fish [[Spaghetti alla puttanesca|sugo]] or [[rag\u00f9]] as a sauce\n|-\n|Secondo\n|\"second course\", the main dish, usually fish or meat with potatoes.

Espresso beans are roasted medium to medium dark in the north, and darker as one moves south.\n\nA common misconception is that espresso has more caffeine than other coffee; in fact the opposite is true. The longer roasting period extracts more caffeine. The modern [[espresso machine]], invented in 1937 by Achille Gaggia, uses a pump and pressure system with water heated to {{convert|90|to|95|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and forced at high pressure through a few grams of finely ground coffee in 25\u201330 seconds, resulting in about 25 milliliters (0.85 [[Fluid ounce|fl oz]], two tablespoons) of liquid.<ref>Piras, 300.</ref>\n\nHome coffee makers are simpler but work under the same principle. [[Neapolitan flip coffee pot|''La Napoletana'']] is a four-part stove-top unit with grounds loosely placed inside a filter; the kettle portion is filled with water and once boiling, the unit is inverted to drip through the grounds. The [[Moka pot|''Moka per il caff\u00e8'']] is a three-part stove-top unit that is placed on the stovetop with loosely packed grounds in a strainer; the water rises from steam pressure and is forced through the grounds into the top portion. In both cases, the water passes through the grounds just once.<ref>Piras, 301.</ref>\n\nEspresso is usually served in a [[demitasse]] cup. [[Caff\u00e8 macchiato]] is topped with a bit of steamed milk or foam; [[ristretto]] is made with less water, and is stronger; [[cappuccino]] is mixed or topped with steamed, mostly frothy, milk. It is generally considered a morning beverage, and usually is not taken after a meal; [[caffelatte]] is equal parts espresso and steamed milk, similar to [[caf\u00e9 au lait]], and is typically served in a large cup. [[Latte macchiato]] (spotted milk) is a glass of warm milk with a bit of coffee and [[caff\u00e8 corretto]] is \"corrected\" with a few drops of an alcoholic beverage such as [[grappa]] or [[brandy]].\n\nThe [[bicerin]] is also an Italian coffee, from [[Turin]]. It is a mixture of [[cappuccino]] and traditional [[hot chocolate]], as it consists of a mix of coffee and [[drinking chocolate]], and with a small addition of milk. It is quite thick, and often whipped cream/foam with chocolate powder and sugar is added on top.\n\n=== Alcoholic beverages ===\n\n==== Wine ====\n{{Main|Italian wine}}\n[[File:\"15 - ITALY - DOCG and DOC wine mark.jpg|thumb|[[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOCG and DOC]] labels on two wine bottles]]\n[[File:Fiasco di vino rosso da tavola Monteriggioni.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.7|Tuscan Chianti in a traditional ''[[fiasco (bottle)|fiasco]]'']]\n\nItaly produces the largest amount of wine in the world and is both the largest exporter and consumer of wine. Only about a quarter of this wine is put into bottles for individual sale. Two-thirds is bulk wine used for blending in France and Germany. The wine distilled into spirits in Italy exceeds the production of wine in the entirety of the [[New World]].<ref>Koplan, 301.</ref> There are twenty separate wine regions.<ref>Koplan, 311.</ref>\n\nThose vineyards producing great wines are trying to do away with the old image of jug wines so often associated with [[Italian wine]]. To promote this, the Italian government passed the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) law in 1963 to regulate place of origin, quality, production method, and type of grape. The designation ''[[Indicazione Geografica Tipica]]'' (IGT) is a less restrictive designation to help a wine maker graduate to the DOC level. In 1980, the government created the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]] e garantita'' (DOCG), reserved for only the best wines.<ref>Koplan, 307\u2013308.</ref>\n\nIn Italy wine is commonly consumed (alongside water) in meals, which are rarely served without it, though it is extremely uncommon for meals to be served with any other drink, alcoholic, or otherwise.\n\n==== Beer ====\n{{Main|Beer in Italy}}\nItaly hosts a wide variety of different beers, which are usually [[pale lager]]. Beer is not as popular and widespread as wine (even though this is changing as beer becomes increasingly popular), and average beer consumption in Italy is less than in some other neighboring European nations, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and Austria. Among many popular brands, the most notable Italian breweries are [[Peroni Brewery|Peroni]] and [[Birra Moretti|Moretti]]. Beer in Italy is often drunk in pizzerias, and [[South Tyrol]] (German-speaking region) is the area where beer is made and consumed the most.\n\n==== Other ====\n[[File:Homemade limoncello.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.3|A bottle of homemade [[Limoncello]]]]\nThere are also several other popular alcoholic drinks in Italy. [[Limoncello]], a traditional lemon liqueur from Sicily and Southern Italy ([[Sorrento]], [[Amalfi]] and the [[Gulf of Naples]]) is the second most popular liqueur in Italy after Campari.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://magazine.luxuryretreats.com/everything-need-know-drinking-limoncello-italy/|title=Drinking Limoncello in Italy|date=8 December 2017|website=Luxury Retreats Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=30 September 2019}}</ref> Made from lemon, it is an extremely strong drink which is usually consumed in very small proportions, served chilled in small glasses or cups.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Amaro Averna|Amaro Sicilianos]] are common Sicilian digestifs, made with herbs, which are usually drunk after heavy meals. [[Mirto (liqueur)|Mirto]], an herbal distillate made from the berries (red mirto) and leaves (white mirto) of the myrtle bush, is popular in [[Sardinia]] and other regions. Another well-known digestif is [[Amaro Lucano]] from [[Basilicata]].<ref>Piras, 383.</ref>\n\n[[Grappa]] is the typical alcoholic drink of northern Italy, generally associated with the culture of the [[Alps]] and of the [[Po Valley]]. The most famous grappas are distilled in [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], [[Veneto]], [[Piedmont]], and [[Trentino]]. The three most notable and recognizable Italian aperitifs are [[Martini & Rossi|Martini]], [[Vermouth]], and [[Campari]]. A sparkling drink which is becoming internationally popular as a less expensive substitute for [[Champagne (wine)|French champagne]] is [[prosecco]], from the Veneto region.<ref name=\"Atkin\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/nov/11/foodanddrink1|title=The fizz that's the bizz|last=Atkin|first=Tim, ''The Observer'' |date=11 November 2007 |accessdate=29 December 2008|location=London|work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref name=\"Dane\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestreet.com/print/story/10272259.html|title=Pop the Cork on Prosecco|last=Dane|first=Ana, ''TheStreet.com'' |date=3 July 2006 |accessdate=29 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Desserts ==\n{{Main|List of Italian desserts}}\n{{See also|List of Italian dishes#Desserts and pastry|l1=List of Italian dishes\u2014Desserts and pastry}}\n{{See also|Sicilian cuisine#Desserts and sweets|l1=Sicilian cuisine\u2014Desserts and sweets}}\nFrom the Italian perspective, cookies and [[candy]] belong to the same category of sweets.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=Tim H. |title=Sweets: A History of Candy |publisher=Bloomsbury USA |year=2002 |isbn=1-58234-229-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sweets00timr/page/364 364\u2013365] |url=https://archive.org/details/sweets00timr/page/364 }}</ref> Traditional candies include [[candied fruit]]s, [[torrone]], and [[nut brittle]]s, all of which are still popular in the modern era.

A typical Easter Sunday breakfast in Umbria and Tuscany includes salami, [[boiled egg]]s, wine, Easter Cakes, and pizza. The common cake for Easter Day is the [[Colomba Pasquale]] (literally, Easter dove), which is often simply known as \"Italian Easter cake\" abroad. It is supposed to represent the dove, and is topped with [[almond]]s and [[pearl sugar]].\n\nOn [[Christmas Eve]] a symbolic fast is observed with the ''cena di magro'' (\"light dinner\"), a meatless meal. Typical cakes of the Christmas season are [[panettone]] and [[pandoro]].\n\n== Abroad ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Africa ===\nDue to several Italian colonies established in Africa, mainly in [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Libya]], and [[Somalia]] (except the [[British Somaliland|northern part]], which was under British rule), there is a considerable amount of Italian influence on the cuisines of these nations.\n\n==== Libya ====\nItaly's legacy from the days when Libya was invaded by Italy can be seen in the popularity of [[pasta]] on its menus, particularly Sharba, a highly spiced Libyan soup. Bazin, a local specialty, is a hard paste, made from barley, salt and water, and one of the most popular meals in the Libyan cuisine is Batata mubatana (filled potato). It consists of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered with egg and breadcrumbs.\n\n==== South Africa ====\nAll major cities and towns in South Africa have substantial populations of [[Italian South Africans|Italians]]. There are \"Italian Clubs\" in all main cities and they have had a significant influence on the cuisine of this country. Italian foods, like ham and cheeses, are imported and some also made locally, and every city has a popular Italian restaurant or two, as well as Pizzerias. Pastas are popular and is eaten more and more by South Africans. The production of good quality olive oil is on the rise in [[South Africa]], especially in the drier south-western parts where there is a more Mediterranean-type of rainfall pattern. Some oils have even won top international awards.\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n==== France ====\n\nIn France, the [[cuisine of Corsica]] has much in common with the Italian cuisine, since the island was from the [[Early Middle Ages]] until 1768 first of a [[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]] and then a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] possession. This is above all relevant by the first courses and by the ''[[charcuterie]]''.\n\n==== Great Britain ====\n\n[[Pizza]] and [[pasta]] dishes such as [[spaghetti bolognese]] and [[lasagne]] with bolognese ''[[rag\u00f9]]'' and [[B\u00e9chamel sauce]] are the most popular forms of Italian food in [[British cuisine|British]], notably, [[English cuisine|English]], cuisine.\n\n==== Slovenia ====\nItalian cuisine has had a strong influence on [[Slovenian cuisine]]. For centuries, north-eastern Italy and western Slovenia have formed part of the same cultural-historical and geographical space. Between 1918 and 1945, western Slovenia (the [[Slovenian Littoral]] and part of [[Inner Carniola]]) were part of Italy. In addition, an autochthonous [[Istrian Italians|Italian minority]] live in [[Slovenian Istria]].\n\nDishes that are shared between Slovenian cuisine and the cuisine Italian [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]] include the ''gubana'' [[nut roll]] of [[Friuli]] (known as ''guban'ca'' or ''potica'' in Slovenia) and the ''[[Istrian Stew|jota]]'' stew.\n\nDishes that come directly from Italian cuisine include [[gnocchi]] and some types of pasta; [[minestrone]] (''mine\u0161tra'' in Slovene); [[frittata]] (''[[fritaja|frtalja]]''); [[Prosciutto]] (''pr\u0161ut''); and [[polenta]].\n\n=== North and Central America ===\n\n==== Canada and the USA ====\n{{Main|Italian-American cuisine}}\n[[File:Supreme pizza.jpg|thumb|An Italian-American pizza with pepperoni (salami), mushrooms, olives and peppers]]\nMuch of Italian-American cuisine is based on that found in Campania and Sicily, heavily [[American cuisine|Americanized]] to reflect ingredients and conditions found in the United States. Most [[pizza]] eaten around the world derives ultimately from the Neapolitan style, if somewhat thicker and usually with more toppings in terms of quantity.\n\n==== Mexico ====\nThroughout the country the \"torta de milanesa\" is a common item offered at food carts and stalls. It is a sandwich made from locally baked bread and contains a [[breaded cutlet|breaded, pan-fried cutlet]] of pork or beef. \"Pescado Veracruzano\" is a dish that originates from the port city of Veracruz and features a fillet of fresh fish (usually Gulf Red Snapper) covered in a distinctly Mediterranean influenced sauce containing stewed tomatoes, garlic, green olives, and capers. Also, \"espagueti\" (spaghetti) and other pastas are popular in a variety of soups.\n\n=== South America ===\n[[File:Milanesa napolitana con papas fritas rodajas de tomate y or\u00e9gano.jpg|thumb|\"[[Milanesa]] a la napolitana\" with [[French fries]], an Italian-inspired dish based on the original ''cotoletta'' dish from Milan, common in [[South America]]. This dish is called \"parmegiana steak\" in [[Brazil]], though it is not typical from [[Parma]] region in [[Italy]] but was actually invented in [[Buenos Aires]].]]\n\n==== Argentina ====\nDue to large [[Italian Argentines|Italian immigration to Argentina]], Italian food and drink is heavily featured in [[Argentine cuisine]]. An example could be ''[[milanesa]]s'' (The name comes from the original [[cotoletta]] alla milanese from [[Milan]], Italy) or [[breaded cutlet]]s. [[Pizza]] (locally pronounced ''pisa or pitsa''), for example, has been wholly subsumed and in its Argentine form more closely resembles Italian [[calzone]]s than it does its Italian ancestor. There are several other Italian-Argentine dishes, such as ''[[Sorrentino]]s'' and Argentine gnocchi.\n\n==== Brazil ====\nItalian cuisine is popular in Brazil, due to great immigration there in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Due to the [[Italian Brazilians|huge Italian community]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] is the place where this cuisine is most appreciated. Several types of pasta and meat, including [[milanesa]] steaks, have made their way into both daily home and street kitchens and fancy restaurants. The city has also developed its particular variety of [[pizza]], different from both [[Neapolitan cuisine|Neapolitan]] and [[Italian-American cuisine|American]] varieties, and it is largely popular on weekend dinners. In [[Rio de Janeiro]] Italian cuisine is also popular, and pizza has developed as a typical [[botequim]] counter snack.\n\n==== Venezuela ====\nThere is considerable Italian influence in [[Venezuelan cuisine]]. ''Pan chabata'', or Venezuelan ciabatta, ''Pan Siciliano'', Sicilian bread, ''Cannoli siciliani'', Sicilian cannoli, and the drink [[chinotto (Venezuelan soft drink)|chinotto]] are examples of the Italian influence in Venezuelan food and beverages.\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Italy|Food}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[Il cucchiaio d'argento]]'', an Italian cookbook\n* ''[[Il talismano della felicit\u00e0]]'' by Ada Boni, an Italian cookbook\n* [[Italian food products]]\n* [[List of Italian cheeses]]\n* [[List of Italian DOP cheeses]]\n* [[List of Italian dishes]]\n** [[List of Italian soups]]\n* [[List of Italian restaurants]]\n* [[Sammarinese cuisine]]\n* [[Italian meal structure]]\n* [[Italian wine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Capatti, Alberto and Montanari, Massimo.

Although the country known as Italy [[Italian unification|did not unite until the 19th century]], the cuisine can claim traceable roots as far back as the 4th century BC. Food and culture were very important at that time as we can see from the cookbook ([[Apicius]]) which dates back to first century BC.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Italian Food|url=http://www.yourguidetoitaly.com/history-of-italian-food-cuisine.html|website=yourguidetoitaly.com}}</ref> Through the centuries, neighbouring regions, conquerors, high-profile chefs, political upheaval, and the discovery of the [[New World]] have influenced its development. Italian food started to form after [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|the fall]] of the [[Roman Empire]], when different cities [[Italian city-states|began to separate]] and form their own traditions. Many different types of [[bread]] and [[pasta]] were made, and there was a variation in cooking techniques and preparation. The country was split. Regional cuisine is represented by some of the major cities in Italy. For example, [[Milan]] (north of Italy) is known for its [[risotto]]s, [[Bologna]] (the central/middle of the country) is known for its [[tortellini]] and [[Naples]] (the south) is famous for its [[pizza]]s<ref>[http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/showassoc_eng.php?id=140 First pizzeria was settled in Naples]</ref> and [[spaghetti]]s.\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n{{See also|Ancient Roman cuisine|Food and dining in the Roman Empire}}\n\nThe first known Italian [[food writer]] was a [[Greek people|Greek]] [[Sicily|Sicilian]] named [[Archestratus]] from [[Province of Syracuse|Syracuse]] in the 4th century BC. He wrote a poem that spoke of using \"top quality and seasonal\" ingredients. He said that flavors should not be masked by [[spice]]s, [[herb]]s or other [[seasonings]]. He placed importance on simple preparation of [[fish]].<ref name=\"Del Conte, 11\">Del Conte, 11.</ref>\n\nSimplicity was abandoned and [[Food and dining in the Roman Empire|replaced by a culture of gastronomy as the Roman Empire developed]]. By the time ''[[De re coquinaria]]'' was published in the 1st century AD, it contained 470 recipes calling for heavy use of spices and herbs. The Romans employed Greek bakers to produce [[bread]]s and imported cheeses from Sicily as the Sicilians had a reputation as the best [[cheesemaker]]s. The Romans reared [[goat]]s for [[butcher]]ing, and grew [[artichoke]]s and [[leek]]s.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 11\" />\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n{{See also|Medieval cuisine}}\n[[File:Fortezza Verrucole Archeopark interno.jpg|thumb|left|A restored medieval kitchen inside [[Verrucole Castle]], Tuscany.]]\nWith culinary traditions from [[Rome]] and [[Athens]], a cuisine developed in [[Sicily]] that some consider the first real Italian cuisine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} [[Arab]]s invaded Sicily in the 9th century, introducing [[spinach]], [[almond]]s, and [[rice]].<ref name=\"Harmon\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/18/garden/arab-sicilian-food-tale-of-1001-years.html|title=Arab-Sicilian Food: Tale of 1,001 Years|last=Jenkins|first=Nancy Harmon|date=18 October 1989|work=The New York Times|access-date=3 May 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> During the 12th century, a [[Normans|Norman]] king surveyed Sicily and saw people making long strings made from [[flour]] and water called ''atriya'', which eventually became ''trii'', a term still used for spaghetti in southern Italy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.deliciousitaly.com/sicily-food-wine/arab-culinary-influence-in-sicilian-food|title=Arab Culinary Influence in Sicilian Food|last=Team|first=Delicious Italy|access-date=3 May 2017|language=en-gb}}</ref> [[Normans]] also introduced the [[casserole]], [[salt cod]] (baccal\u00e0), and [[stockfish]], all of which remain popular.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 12\">Del Conte, 12.</ref>\n\n[[Food preservation]] was either chemical or physical, as [[refrigeration]] did not exist. Meats and fish were [[smoking (cooking)|smoked]], dried, or kept on ice. [[Brine]] and [[salt]] were used to [[pickling|pickle]] items such as [[herring]], and to cure [[pork]]. [[Root vegetable]]s were preserved in brine after they had been [[parboiled]]. Other means of preservation included [[oil]], [[vinegar]], or immersing meat in congealed, rendered fat. For preserving fruits, [[liquor]], honey, and sugar were used.<ref>Capatti, 253\u2013254.</ref>\n\nThe northern Italian regions show a mix of [[Germany|Germanic]] and [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] while the south reflects Arab<ref name=\"Harmon\" /> influence, as much [[Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean cuisine]] was spread by Arab trade.<ref>Capatti, 2\u20134.</ref> The oldest Italian book on cuisine is the 13th century ''Liber de coquina'' written in [[Naples]]. Dishes include \"Roman-style\" [[cabbage]] (''ad usum romanorum''), ''ad usum campanie'' which were \"small leaves\" prepared in the \"Campanian manner\", a bean dish from the Marca di Trevisio, a ''torta'', ''compositum londardicum'' which are similar to dishes prepared today. Two other books from the 14th century include recipes for Roman ''pastello'', Lasagna pie, and call for the use of [[salt]] from [[Sardinia]] or [[Chioggia]].<ref>Capatti, 6.</ref>\n[[File:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saffron]] has been used in Italy for centuries]]\n\nIn the 15th century, [[Maestro Martino]] was chef to the [[Patriarch of Aquileia]] at the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. His ''Libro de arte coquinaria'' describes a more refined and elegant cuisine. His book contains a recipe for ''Maccaroni Siciliani'', made by wrapping dough around a thin iron rod to dry in the sun. The macaroni was cooked in [[capon]] stock flavored with [[saffron]], displaying [[Iran|Persian]] influences. Of particular note is Martino's avoidance of excessive spices in favor of fresh herbs.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 12\" /> The Roman recipes include ''coppiette'' (air-dried salami) and cabbage dishes. His [[Florence|Florentine]] dishes include eggs with ''Bolognese torta'', ''Sienese torta'' and [[Genoa|Genoese]] recipes such as ''piperata'' (sweets), macaroni, [[squash (plant)|squash]], [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], and [[spinach]] pie with [[onion]]s.<ref>Capatti, 9\u201310.</ref>\n\nMartino's text was included in a 1475 book by [[Bartolomeo Platina]] printed in [[Venice]] entitled ''[[De honesta voluptate et valetudine]]'' (\"On Honest Pleasure and Good Health\"). Platina puts Martino's \"Libro\" in regional context, writing about [[perch]] from [[Lake Maggiore]], [[sardine]]s from [[Lake Garda]], [[Grayling (genus)|grayling]] from [[Adda (river)|Adda]], hens from [[Padua]], [[olive]]s from [[Bologna]] and [[Picenum|Piceno]], [[turbot]] from [[Ravenna]], [[rudd]] from [[Lake Trasimeno]], [[carrot]]s from [[Viterbo]], [[bass (fish)|bass]] from the [[Tiber]], ''roviglioni'' and [[shad]] from [[Lake Albano]], [[snail]]s from [[Rieti]], [[ficus|figs]] from Tuscolo, [[grape]]s from [[Narni]], [[oil]] from [[Cassino]], [[orange (fruit)|oranges]] from [[Naples]] and [[Moray eel|eels]] from [[Campania]]. Grains from [[Lombardy]] and Campania are mentioned as is [[honey]] from Sicily and Taranto. [[Wine]] from the Ligurian coast, [[Greco (grape)|Greco]] from Tuscany and [[Centola|San Severino]], and [[Trebbiano]] from Tuscany and [[Picenum|Piceno]] are also mentioned in the book.<ref>Capatti, 10.</ref>\n\n=== Early modern era ===\nThe courts of [[Florence]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]], and [[Ferrara]] were central to the cuisine. [[Cristoforo di Messisbugo]], steward to [[Ippolito d'Este]], published ''Banchetti Composizioni di Vivande'' in 1549. Messisbugo gives recipes for pies and tarts (containing 124 recipes with various fillings). The work emphasizes the use of Eastern spices and sugar.<ref>Del Conte, 13.</ref>\n\n[[File:Scappi.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.6|[[Bartolomeo Scappi]], personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]]]]\nIn 1570, [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]], wrote his ''Opera'' in five volumes, giving a comprehensive view of Italian cooking of that period. It contains over 1,000 recipes, with information on banquets including displays and menus as well as illustrations of kitchen and table utensils. This book differs from most books written for the royal courts in its preference for domestic animals and courtyard birds rather than game.\n\nRecipes include lesser cuts of meats such as tongue, head, and shoulder. The third volume has recipes for fish in [[Lent]]. These fish recipes are simple, including [[poaching (cooking)|poaching]], [[broil]]ing, [[grilling]], and frying after marination.\n\nParticular attention is given to seasons and places where fish should be caught. The final volume includes pies, tarts, fritters, and a recipe for a sweet Neapolitan [[pizza]] (not the current savory version, as tomatoes had not yet been introduced to Italy). However, such items from the New World as [[maize|corn]] (maize) and [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] are included.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\">Del Conte, 14, 15.</ref>\n\nIn the first decade of the 17th century, Giangiacomo Castelvetro wrote ''Breve Racconto di Tutte le Radici di Tutte l'Herbe et di Tutti i Frutti'' (''A Brief Account of All Roots, Herbs, and Fruit''), translated into English by Gillian Riley. Originally from [[Modena]], Castelvetro moved to England because he was a [[Protestant]]. The book lists Italian vegetables and fruits along with their preparation. He featured vegetables as a central part of the meal, not just as accompaniments.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\" /> Castelvetro favored simmering vegetables in salted water and serving them warm or cold with olive oil, salt, fresh ground pepper, [[lemon]] juice, [[verjus]], or [[orange juice]]. He also suggested roasting vegetables wrapped in damp paper over charcoal or embers with a drizzle of olive oil. Castelvetro's book is separated into seasons with hop shoots in the spring and [[truffles]] in the winter, detailing the use of [[pigs]] in the search for truffles.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\" />[[File:Arte di ben cucinare.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.6|''L'arte di Ben Cucinare'' published by Bartolomeo Stefani in 1662]]\n\nIn 1662, Bartolomeo Stefani, chef to the [[Duchy of Mantua]], published ''L'Arte di Ben Cucinare''. He was the first to offer a section on ''vitto ordinario'' (\"ordinary food\"). The book described a banquet given by Duke [[Charles III, Duke of Mantua|Charles]] for Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], with details of the food and table settings for each guest, including a knife, fork, spoon, glass, a plate (instead of the bowls more often used), and a napkin.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 15\">Del Conte, 15.</ref>\n\nOther books from this time, such as ''Galatheo'' by [[Giovanni della Casa]], tell how ''scalci'' (\"waiters\") should manage themselves while serving their guests. Waiters should not scratch their heads or other parts of themselves, or spit, sniff, cough or sneeze while serving diners. The book also told diners not to use their fingers while eating and not to wipe sweat with their napkin.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 15\" />\n\n=== Modern era ===\n[[File:Apicius 1709.JPG|thumb|left|upright= 0.7|''[[Apicius]]'', ''[[De re coquinaria]]'' (\"On the Subject of Cooking\"), 1709 edition.]]\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Italian culinary books began to emphasize the regionalism of Italian cuisine rather than [[French cuisine]]. Books written then were no longer addressed to professional chefs but to [[bourgeois]] housewives.<ref>De Conte, 16</ref> Periodicals in booklet form such as ''La cuoca cremonese'' (''The Cook of Cremona'') in 1794 give a sequence of ingredients according to season along with chapters on meat, fish, and vegetables. As the century progressed these books increased in size, popularity, and frequency.<ref>Capatti, 158\u2013159.</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century, medical texts warned peasants against eating refined foods as it was believed that these were poor for their digestion and their bodies required heavy meals. It was believed by some that peasants ate poorly because they preferred eating poorly. However, many peasants had to eat rotten food and moldy bread because that was all they could afford.<ref>Capatti, 282\u2013284.</ref>\n\nIn 1779, Antonio Nebbia from [[Macerata]] in the [[Marche]] region, wrote ''Il Cuoco Maceratese'' (''The Cook of Macerata''). Nebbia addressed the importance of local vegetables and [[pasta]], rice, and [[gnocchi]]. For stock, he preferred vegetables and chicken over other meats.\n\nIn 1773, the Neapolitan Vincenzo Corrado's ''Il Cuoco Galante'' (''The Courteous Cook'') gave particular emphasis to v''itto pitagorico'' (vegetarian food). \"Pythagorean food consists of fresh herbs, roots, flowers, fruits, seeds and all that is produced in the earth for our nourishment. It is so called because [[Pythagoras]], as is well known, only used such produce. There is no doubt that this kind of food appears to be more natural to man, and the use of meat is noxious.\" This book was the first to give the tomato a central role with thirteen recipes.\n[[File:Tomato2 002.jpg|thumb|Tomatoes are a typical part of Italian cuisine, but only entered common usage in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Gentilcore2010\">{{cite book |last=Gentilcore |first=David |title=Pomodoro!: A History of the Tomato in Italy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZgEvOPTQLsC |accessdate=24 February 2013 |date=15 June 2010|publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-15206-8|page=x}}</ref>]]\n\n''Zuppa alli pomidoro'' in Corrado's book is a dish similar to today's Tuscan [[pappa al pomodoro]]. Corrado's 1798 edition introduced a \"Treatise on the Potato\" after the French [[Antoine-Augustin Parmentier]]'s successful promotion of the tuber.<ref>De Conte, 17</ref> In 1790, [[Francesco Leonardi (Chef)|Francesco Leonardi]] in his book ''L'Apicio moderno'' (\"Modern [[Apicius]]\") sketches a history of the Italian Cuisine from the Roman Age and gives as first a recipe of a tomato-based sauce.<ref>Faccioli, 753</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, Giovanni Vialardi, chef to [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel]], wrote ''A Treatise of Modern Cookery and Patisserie'' with recipes \"suitable for a modest household\". Many of his recipes are for regional dishes from Turin including twelve for potatoes such as ''Genoese Cappon Magro''. In 1829, ''Il Nuovo Cuoco Milanese Economico'' by Giovanni Felice Luraschi featured [[Milan]]ese dishes such as kidney with [[anchovies]] and lemon and [[gnocchi]] alla Romana. Gian Battista and Giovanni Ratto's ''La Cucina Genovese'' in 1871 addressed the cuisine of [[Liguria]]. This book contained the first recipe for [[pesto]]. ''La Cucina Teorico-Pratica'' written by Ippolito Cavalcanti described the first recipe for pasta with tomatoes.<ref>De Conte, 18\u201319</ref>\n\n''La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiare bene'' (''The Science of Cooking and the Art of Eating Well''), by [[Pellegrino Artusi]], first published in 1891, is widely regarded as the canon of classic modern Italian cuisine, and it is still in print. Its recipes predominantly originate from [[Romagna]] and [[Tuscany]], where he lived.\n\n== Ingredients ==\n[[File:BasilkumPesto.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pesto]], a Ligurian sauce made out of basil, olive oil and pine nuts, and which can be eaten with pasta or other dishes such as soup.]]\n\nItalian cuisine has a great variety of different ingredients which are commonly used, ranging from fruits, vegetables, sauces, meats, etc. In the North of Italy, fish (such as cod, or [[baccal\u00e0]]), potatoes, rice, corn (maize), sausages, pork, and different types of cheeses are the most common ingredients. Pasta dishes with use of tomato are spread in all Italy.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Bastianich | first1=Lidia | authorlink=Lidia Bastianich | first2= Manuali | last2=Tania | title=Lidia Cooks from the Heart of Italy: A Feast of 175 Regional Recipes | edition=1st}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1=Bastianich | first1=Lidia | authorlink=Lidia Bastianich | first2= Mariani | last2=John | title=How Italian Food Conquered the World | edition=1st}}</ref> Italians like their ingredients fresh and subtly seasoned and spiced.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/16/ten-commandments-of-italian-cooking|title=Ten commandments of Italian cooking|last=Conte|first=Anna Del|date=16 May 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=25 April 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Northern Italy]] though there are many kinds of stuffed pasta, polenta and risotto are equally popular if not more so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://italianfood.about.com/od/regionalcuisines1/ss/northeastern.htm|title=Northern Regional Cuisines|author=Kyle Phillips|work=About}}</ref> Ligurian ingredients include several types of fish and seafood dishes. Basil (found in [[pesto]]), nuts, and olive oil are very common. In Emilia-Romagna, common ingredients include ham ([[prosciutto]]), sausage ([[cotechino Modena|cotechino]]), different sorts of [[salami]], truffles, [[Grana (cheese)|grana]], [[Parmigiano-Reggiano]], and [[tomato]]es ([[Bolognese sauce]] or [[rag\u00f9]]).\n[[File:Italian olive oil 2007.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.35|[[Olive oil]] is the most commonly used vegetable fat in Italian cooking, and as the basis for sauces, often replaces animal fats of butter or lard.<ref name=\"May2005\">{{cite book|last=May|first=Tony|title=Italian Cuisine: The New Essential Reference to the Riches of the Italian Table|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tAafwz2YcQC&pg=PA7|accessdate=24 February 2013|date=1 June 2005|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-30280-1|pages=7\u2013}}</ref>]]\n\nTraditional Central Italian cuisine uses ingredients such as tomatoes, all kinds of meat, fish, and pecorino cheese. In [[Tuscany]], pasta (especially [[pappardelle]]) is traditionally served with meat sauce (including game meat). In [[Southern Italy]], tomatoes&nbsp;(fresh or cooked into tomato sauce), [[Capsicum|peppers]], olives and [[olive oil]], garlic, [[artichoke]]s, oranges, [[ricotta cheese]], [[eggplants]], [[zucchini]], certain types of [[fish]] (anchovies, sardines and tuna), and capers are important components to the local cuisine.\n\nItalian cuisine is also well known (and well regarded) for its use of a diverse variety of pasta. Pasta include noodles in various lengths, widths, and shapes. Most pastas may be distinguished by the shapes for which they are named\u2014[[penne]], [[maccheroni]], [[spaghetti]], [[linguine]], [[fusilli]], [[lasagne]], and many more varieties that are filled with other ingredients like [[ravioli]] and [[tortellini]].\n\nThe word pasta is also used to refer to dishes in which pasta products are a primary ingredient. It is usually served with sauce. There are hundreds of different shapes of pasta with at least locally recognized names.\n\nExamples include [[spaghetti]] (thin rods), [[rigatoni]] (tubes or cylinders), [[fusilli]] (swirls), and [[lasagne]] (sheets). Dumplings, like [[gnocchi]] (made with potatoes or pumpkin) and noodles like [[sp\u00e4tzle]], are sometimes considered pasta. They are both traditional in parts of Italy.\n\nPasta is categorized in two basic styles: dried and fresh. Dried pasta made without eggs can be stored for up to two years under ideal conditions, while fresh pasta will keep for a couple of days in the refrigerator. Pasta is generally cooked by boiling. Under Italian law, dry pasta (pasta secca) can only be made from [[durum wheat]] flour or durum wheat [[semolina]], and is more commonly used in Southern Italy compared to their Northern counterparts, who traditionally prefer the fresh egg variety.\n\nDurum flour and durum semolina have a yellow tinge in color. Italian pasta is traditionally cooked ''al dente'' (Italian: ''firm to the bite'', meaning not too soft). Outside Italy, dry pasta is frequently made from other types of flour, but this yields a softer product. There are many types of wheat flour with varying gluten and protein levels depending on variety of grain used.\n\nParticular varieties of pasta may also use other grains and milling methods to make the flour, as specified by law. Some pasta varieties, such as [[pizzoccheri]], are made from [[buckwheat]] flour. Fresh pasta may include eggs (''pasta all'uovo'' \"egg pasta\"). Whole wheat pasta has become increasingly popular because of its supposed health benefits over pasta made from refined flour.\n\n== Regional variation ==\nEach area [[List of Italian dishes|has its own specialties]], primarily at a regional level, but also at provincial level. The differences can come from a bordering country (such as France or Austria), whether a region is close to the sea or the mountains, and economics.<ref name=HazanIntroduction>{{cite book |last1=Hazan |first1=Marcella|authorlink1=Marcella Hazan|date=27 October 1992|title=Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking |publisher=Knopf |isbn=978-0394584041 |edition=1st |url=http://knopfdoubleday.com/book/77517/essentials-of-classic-italian-cooking/ |accessdate=2 November 2015|format=Kindle and printed. |chapter=Introduction|quote=...Italian cooking?

The [[S\u00fcdtirol]] cuisine has strong [[Alps|alpine]] regional and [[Austria]]n influence]]\nBefore the [[Council of Trent]] in the middle of the 16th century, the region was known for the simplicity of its peasant cuisine. When the prelates of the Catholic Church established there, they brought the art of fine cooking with them. Later, also influences from Venice and the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] came in.<ref name=\"Piras, 67\">Piras, 67.</ref>\n\nThe [[Trentino]] subregion produces various types of sausages, polenta, yogurt, cheese, potato cake, funnel cake, and freshwater fish. In the [[S\u00fcdtirol]] (Alto Adige) subregion, due to the German-speaking majority population, strong Austrian and Slavic influences prevail. The most renowned local product is traditional ''[[speck]]'' juniper-flavored ham which, as [[Speck Alto Adige PGI|Speck Alto Adige]], is regulated by the [[European Union]] under the [[protected geographical indication]] (PGI) status. [[Goulash]], ''[[kn\u00f6del]]'', [[apple strudel]], ''[[kaiserschmarrn]]'', ''[[krapfen]]'', ''[[r\u00f6sti]]'', ''[[sp\u00e4tzle]]'', and [[rye bread]] are regular dishes, along with potatoes, dumpling, homemade [[sauerkraut]], and lard.<ref name=\"Piras, 67\" /> The territory of [[Bolzano]] is also reputed for its [[M\u00fcller-Thurgau]] white wines.\n\n=== Tuscany ===\n[[File:Finocchiona from Tuscany.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Finocchiona]]'', a classic southern Tuscan Salami]]\n\nSimplicity is central to the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] cuisine. Legumes, bread, cheese, vegetables, mushrooms, and fresh [[fruit]] are used. A good example of typical Tuscan food is ''[[ribollita]]'', a notable soup whose name literally means \"reboiled\". Like most Tuscan cuisine, the soup has peasant origins. ''Ribollita'' was originally made by reheating (i.e. reboiling) the leftover ''[[minestrone]]'' or vegetable soup from the previous day. There are many variations but the main ingredients always include leftover bread, cannellini beans, and inexpensive vegetables such as carrot, cabbage, beans, [[Chard|silverbeet]], ''[[cavolo nero]]'' (Tuscan kale), onion, and olive oil.\n\nA regional Tuscan pasta known as ''[[pici]]'' resembles thick, grainy-surfaced spaghetti, and is often rolled by hand. White [[truffle]]s from [[San Miniato]] appear in October and November. High-quality beef, used for the traditional [[Florentine steak]], come from the [[Chianina]] cattle breed of the [[Chiana Valley]] and the [[Maremmana]] from [[Maremma]].\n\nPork is also produced.<ref>Piras, 221\u2013239.</ref> The region is well-known also for its rich [[Game (food)|game]], especially [[wild boar]], [[European hare|hare]], [[fallow deer]], [[roe deer]], and [[pheasant]] that often are used to prepare ''[[pappardelle]]'' dishes. Regional desserts include ''[[panforte]]'' (prepared with honey, fruits, and nuts), ''[[ricciarelli]]'' (biscuits made using an almond base with sugar, honey, and egg white), and ''[[cavallucci]]'' (cookies made with almonds, candied fruits, coriander, flour, and honey).

Fish and seafood are added in regions closer to the coast while [[pumpkin]], [[asparagus]], [[radicchio]], and [[frog legs]] appear farther away from the [[Adriatic Sea]].\n\nMade from finely ground maize meal, [[polenta]] is a traditional, rural food typical of Veneto and most of [[Northern Italy]]. It may be included in stirred dishes and baked dishes. Polenta can be served with various cheese, stockfish, or meat dishes. Some polenta dishes include [[Boletus edulis|porcini]], [[rapini]], or other vegetables or meats, such as small [[song-bird]]s in the case of the [[Veneto|Venetian]] and [[Lombardy|Lombard]] dish ''polenta e osei'', or [[sausage]]s. In some areas of Veneto it can be also made of a particular variety of cornmeal, named ''biancoperla'', so that the color of polenta is white and not yellow (the so-called ''polenta bianca'').\n[[File:Polenta con sopressa e funghi.jpg|thumb|''[[Polenta]]'' served with ''[[sopressa]]'' and mushrooms, a traditional [[peasant food]] of Veneto]]\n\n[[Bean]]s, [[pea]]s, and other [[legume]]s are seen in these areas with ''[[pasta e fagioli]]'' (beans and pasta) and ''risi e bisi'' ([[rice and peas]]). Venice features heavy dishes using exotic spices and sauces. Ingredients such as [[stockfish]] or simple marinated [[Anchovy (food)|anchovies]] are found here as well.\n\nLess fish and more meat is eaten away from the coast. Other typical products are sausages such as [[Sopressa|Soppressa Vicentina]], garlic salami, [[Piave cheese]], and [[Asiago cheese]]. High quality vegetables are prized, such as red [[radicchio]] from [[Treviso]] and white asparagus from [[Bassano del Grappa]]. Perhaps the most popular dish of [[Venice]] is ''[[liver and onions|fegato alla veneziana]]'', thinly-sliced veal liver sauteed with onions.\n\n[[Squid]] and [[cuttlefish]] are common ingredients, as is squid ink, called ''nero di seppia''.<ref>Piras, 33.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillmanwonders.com/cuisines/venice_cuisine.htm |title=Venice Cuisine \u2013 by food author Howard Hillman |publisher=Hillmanwonders.com |date= |accessdate=4 April 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080611081454/http://www.hillmanwonders.com/cuisines/venice_cuisine.htm |archivedate = 11 June 2008}}</ref> Regional desserts include ''[[tiramisu]]'' (made of biscuits dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of [[egg yolks]] and ''[[mascarpone]]'', and flavored with liquor and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]]<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = history of tiramisu\n |url         = http://www.annamariavolpi.com/page38.html\n |accessdate  = 16 August 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20120604101928/http://www.annamariavolpi.com/page38.html\n |archivedate = 4 June 2012\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>), ''[[baicoli]]'' (biscuits made with butter and vanilla), and [[nougat]].\n\nThe most celebrated Venetian wines include [[Bardolino]], [[Prosecco]], [[Soave (wine)|Soave]], [[Amarone]], and [[Valpolicella]] [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]] wines.\n\n== Meal structure ==\n{{Main|Meal structure in Italy}}\n[[File:Cafe con leche y cruas\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|A typical Italian breakfast, consisting of ''[[cappuccino]]'' and brioche / croissant / cornetto.]]\nTraditional meals in Italy typically contained four or five courses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://toscanaslc.com/blog/guide-to-the-traditional-italian-meal-structure/|title=Guide to the Traditional Italian Meal Structure|date=22 September 2015|work=Cucina Toscana|access-date=15 May 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> Especially on weekends, meals are often seen as a time to spend with family and friends rather than simply for sustenance; thus, meals tend to be longer than in other cultures.

The ''primo'' (first course) is usually a filling dish such as risotto or pasta, with sauces made from meat, vegetables, or seafood. Whole pieces of meat such as sausages, meatballs, poultry are eaten in the secondo. Italian cuisine has some single-course meals (''piatto unico'') combining starches and proteins. Contorni of vegetables and starches are served on a separate plate and not on the plate with the meat as is done in northern European Style serving.\n[[File:Prosecco-gold-arrangement-1.jpg|thumb|upright|A bottle of sparkling [[Prosecco]], which one would have as an ''aperitivo'']]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Meal stage\n!Composition\n|-\n|Aperitivo\n|[[ap\u00e9ritif]] usually enjoyed as an appetizer before a large meal, may be: [[Campari]], [[Martini (vermouth)|Martini]], [[Cinzano]], [[Amaro Lucano|Lucano]], [[Prosecco]], [[Aperol]], [[Spritz (alcoholic beverage)|Spritz]], [[Vermouth]], [[Negroni]].\n|-\n|Antipasto\n|literally \"before (the) meal\", hot or cold, usually consist of cheese, ham, sliced sausage, marinated vegetables or fish, bruschetta and bread [[appetizer]]s.\n|-\n|Primo\n|\"first course\", usually consists of a hot dish like pasta, risotto, gnocchi, or soup with a sauce, vegetarian, meat or fish [[Spaghetti alla puttanesca|sugo]] or [[rag\u00f9]] as a sauce\n|-\n|Secondo\n|\"second course\", the main dish, usually fish or meat with potatoes.

Espresso beans are roasted medium to medium dark in the north, and darker as one moves south.\n\nA common misconception is that espresso has more caffeine than other coffee; in fact the opposite is true. The longer roasting period extracts more caffeine. The modern [[espresso machine]], invented in 1937 by Achille Gaggia, uses a pump and pressure system with water heated to {{convert|90|to|95|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and forced at high pressure through a few grams of finely ground coffee in 25\u201330 seconds, resulting in about 25 milliliters (0.85 [[Fluid ounce|fl oz]], two tablespoons) of liquid.<ref>Piras, 300.</ref>\n\nHome coffee makers are simpler but work under the same principle. [[Neapolitan flip coffee pot|''La Napoletana'']] is a four-part stove-top unit with grounds loosely placed inside a filter; the kettle portion is filled with water and once boiling, the unit is inverted to drip through the grounds. The [[Moka pot|''Moka per il caff\u00e8'']] is a three-part stove-top unit that is placed on the stovetop with loosely packed grounds in a strainer; the water rises from steam pressure and is forced through the grounds into the top portion. In both cases, the water passes through the grounds just once.<ref>Piras, 301.</ref>\n\nEspresso is usually served in a [[demitasse]] cup. [[Caff\u00e8 macchiato]] is topped with a bit of steamed milk or foam; [[ristretto]] is made with less water, and is stronger; [[cappuccino]] is mixed or topped with steamed, mostly frothy, milk. It is generally considered a morning beverage, and usually is not taken after a meal; [[caffelatte]] is equal parts espresso and steamed milk, similar to [[caf\u00e9 au lait]], and is typically served in a large cup. [[Latte macchiato]] (spotted milk) is a glass of warm milk with a bit of coffee and [[caff\u00e8 corretto]] is \"corrected\" with a few drops of an alcoholic beverage such as [[grappa]] or [[brandy]].\n\nThe [[bicerin]] is also an Italian coffee, from [[Turin]]. It is a mixture of [[cappuccino]] and traditional [[hot chocolate]], as it consists of a mix of coffee and [[drinking chocolate]], and with a small addition of milk. It is quite thick, and often whipped cream/foam with chocolate powder and sugar is added on top.\n\n=== Alcoholic beverages ===\n\n==== Wine ====\n{{Main|Italian wine}}\n[[File:\"15 - ITALY - DOCG and DOC wine mark.jpg|thumb|[[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOCG and DOC]] labels on two wine bottles]]\n[[File:Fiasco di vino rosso da tavola Monteriggioni.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.7|Tuscan Chianti in a traditional ''[[fiasco (bottle)|fiasco]]'']]\n\nItaly produces the largest amount of wine in the world and is both the largest exporter and consumer of wine. Only about a quarter of this wine is put into bottles for individual sale. Two-thirds is bulk wine used for blending in France and Germany. The wine distilled into spirits in Italy exceeds the production of wine in the entirety of the [[New World]].<ref>Koplan, 301.</ref> There are twenty separate wine regions.<ref>Koplan, 311.</ref>\n\nThose vineyards producing great wines are trying to do away with the old image of jug wines so often associated with [[Italian wine]]. To promote this, the Italian government passed the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) law in 1963 to regulate place of origin, quality, production method, and type of grape. The designation ''[[Indicazione Geografica Tipica]]'' (IGT) is a less restrictive designation to help a wine maker graduate to the DOC level. In 1980, the government created the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]] e garantita'' (DOCG), reserved for only the best wines.<ref>Koplan, 307\u2013308.</ref>\n\nIn Italy wine is commonly consumed (alongside water) in meals, which are rarely served without it, though it is extremely uncommon for meals to be served with any other drink, alcoholic, or otherwise.\n\n==== Beer ====\n{{Main|Beer in Italy}}\nItaly hosts a wide variety of different beers, which are usually [[pale lager]]. Beer is not as popular and widespread as wine (even though this is changing as beer becomes increasingly popular), and average beer consumption in Italy is less than in some other neighboring European nations, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and Austria. Among many popular brands, the most notable Italian breweries are [[Peroni Brewery|Peroni]] and [[Birra Moretti|Moretti]]. Beer in Italy is often drunk in pizzerias, and [[South Tyrol]] (German-speaking region) is the area where beer is made and consumed the most.\n\n==== Other ====\n[[File:Homemade limoncello.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.3|A bottle of homemade [[Limoncello]]]]\nThere are also several other popular alcoholic drinks in Italy.

A typical Easter Sunday breakfast in Umbria and Tuscany includes salami, [[boiled egg]]s, wine, Easter Cakes, and pizza. The common cake for Easter Day is the [[Colomba Pasquale]] (literally, Easter dove), which is often simply known as \"Italian Easter cake\" abroad. It is supposed to represent the dove, and is topped with [[almond]]s and [[pearl sugar]].\n\nOn [[Christmas Eve]] a symbolic fast is observed with the ''cena di magro'' (\"light dinner\"), a meatless meal. Typical cakes of the Christmas season are [[panettone]] and [[pandoro]].\n\n== Abroad ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Africa ===\nDue to several Italian colonies established in Africa, mainly in [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Libya]], and [[Somalia]] (except the [[British Somaliland|northern part]], which was under British rule), there is a considerable amount of Italian influence on the cuisines of these nations.\n\n==== Libya ====\nItaly's legacy from the days when Libya was invaded by Italy can be seen in the popularity of [[pasta]] on its menus, particularly Sharba, a highly spiced Libyan soup. Bazin, a local specialty, is a hard paste, made from barley, salt and water, and one of the most popular meals in the Libyan cuisine is Batata mubatana (filled potato). It consists of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered with egg and breadcrumbs.\n\n==== South Africa ====\nAll major cities and towns in South Africa have substantial populations of [[Italian South Africans|Italians]]. There are \"Italian Clubs\" in all main cities and they have had a significant influence on the cuisine of this country. Italian foods, like ham and cheeses, are imported and some also made locally, and every city has a popular Italian restaurant or two, as well as Pizzerias. Pastas are popular and is eaten more and more by South Africans. The production of good quality olive oil is on the rise in [[South Africa]], especially in the drier south-western parts where there is a more Mediterranean-type of rainfall pattern. Some oils have even won top international awards.\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n==== France ====\n\nIn France, the [[cuisine of Corsica]] has much in common with the Italian cuisine, since the island was from the [[Early Middle Ages]] until 1768 first of a [[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]] and then a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] possession. This is above all relevant by the first courses and by the ''[[charcuterie]]''.\n\n==== Great Britain ====\n\n[[Pizza]] and [[pasta]] dishes such as [[spaghetti bolognese]] and [[lasagne]] with bolognese ''[[rag\u00f9]]'' and [[B\u00e9chamel sauce]] are the most popular forms of Italian food in [[British cuisine|British]], notably, [[English cuisine|English]], cuisine.\n\n==== Slovenia ====\nItalian cuisine has had a strong influence on [[Slovenian cuisine]]. For centuries, north-eastern Italy and western Slovenia have formed part of the same cultural-historical and geographical space. Between 1918 and 1945, western Slovenia (the [[Slovenian Littoral]] and part of [[Inner Carniola]]) were part of Italy. In addition, an autochthonous [[Istrian Italians|Italian minority]] live in [[Slovenian Istria]].\n\nDishes that are shared between Slovenian cuisine and the cuisine Italian [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]] include the ''gubana'' [[nut roll]] of [[Friuli]] (known as ''guban'ca'' or ''potica'' in Slovenia) and the ''[[Istrian Stew|jota]]'' stew.\n\nDishes that come directly from Italian cuisine include [[gnocchi]] and some types of pasta; [[minestrone]] (''mine\u0161tra'' in Slovene); [[frittata]] (''[[fritaja|frtalja]]''); [[Prosciutto]] (''pr\u0161ut''); and [[polenta]].\n\n=== North and Central America ===\n\n==== Canada and the USA ====\n{{Main|Italian-American cuisine}}\n[[File:Supreme pizza.jpg|thumb|An Italian-American pizza with pepperoni (salami), mushrooms, olives and peppers]]\nMuch of Italian-American cuisine is based on that found in Campania and Sicily, heavily [[American cuisine|Americanized]] to reflect ingredients and conditions found in the United States. Most [[pizza]] eaten around the world derives ultimately from the Neapolitan style, if somewhat thicker and usually with more toppings in terms of quantity.\n\n==== Mexico ====\nThroughout the country the \"torta de milanesa\" is a common item offered at food carts and stalls. It is a sandwich made from locally baked bread and contains a [[breaded cutlet|breaded, pan-fried cutlet]] of pork or beef. \"Pescado Veracruzano\" is a dish that originates from the port city of Veracruz and features a fillet of fresh fish (usually Gulf Red Snapper) covered in a distinctly Mediterranean influenced sauce containing stewed tomatoes, garlic, green olives, and capers. Also, \"espagueti\" (spaghetti) and other pastas are popular in a variety of soups.\n\n=== South America ===\n[[File:Milanesa napolitana con papas fritas rodajas de tomate y or\u00e9gano.jpg|thumb|\"[[Milanesa]] a la napolitana\" with [[French fries]], an Italian-inspired dish based on the original ''cotoletta'' dish from Milan, common in [[South America]]. This dish is called \"parmegiana steak\" in [[Brazil]], though it is not typical from [[Parma]] region in [[Italy]] but was actually invented in [[Buenos Aires]].]]\n\n==== Argentina ====\nDue to large [[Italian Argentines|Italian immigration to Argentina]], Italian food and drink is heavily featured in [[Argentine cuisine]]. An example could be ''[[milanesa]]s'' (The name comes from the original [[cotoletta]] alla milanese from [[Milan]], Italy) or [[breaded cutlet]]s. [[Pizza]] (locally pronounced ''pisa or pitsa''), for example, has been wholly subsumed and in its Argentine form more closely resembles Italian [[calzone]]s than it does its Italian ancestor. There are several other Italian-Argentine dishes, such as ''[[Sorrentino]]s'' and Argentine gnocchi.\n\n==== Brazil ====\nItalian cuisine is popular in Brazil, due to great immigration there in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Due to the [[Italian Brazilians|huge Italian community]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] is the place where this cuisine is most appreciated. Several types of pasta and meat, including [[milanesa]] steaks, have made their way into both daily home and street kitchens and fancy restaurants. The city has also developed its particular variety of [[pizza]], different from both [[Neapolitan cuisine|Neapolitan]] and [[Italian-American cuisine|American]] varieties, and it is largely popular on weekend dinners. In [[Rio de Janeiro]] Italian cuisine is also popular, and pizza has developed as a typical [[botequim]] counter snack.\n\n==== Venezuela ====\nThere is considerable Italian influence in [[Venezuelan cuisine]]. ''Pan chabata'', or Venezuelan ciabatta, ''Pan Siciliano'', Sicilian bread, ''Cannoli siciliani'', Sicilian cannoli, and the drink [[chinotto (Venezuelan soft drink)|chinotto]] are examples of the Italian influence in Venezuelan food and beverages.\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Italy|Food}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[Il cucchiaio d'argento]]'', an Italian cookbook\n* ''[[Il talismano della felicit\u00e0]]'' by Ada Boni, an Italian cookbook\n* [[Italian food products]]\n* [[List of Italian cheeses]]\n* [[List of Italian DOP cheeses]]\n* [[List of Italian dishes]]\n** [[List of Italian soups]]\n* [[List of Italian restaurants]]\n* [[Sammarinese cuisine]]\n* [[Italian meal structure]]\n* [[Italian wine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Capatti, Alberto and Montanari, Massimo.

For example, graphite is [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and black while diamond is highly [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]]. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the [[Greeks|Greek]] verb \"\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\" which means \"to write\"), while diamond is the [[Hardness|hardest]] naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good [[electrical conductor]] while diamond has a low [[electrical conductivity]]. Under normal conditions, diamond, [[carbon nanotube]]s, and [[graphene]] have the highest [[thermal conductivity|thermal conductivities]] of [[List of thermal conductivities|all known materials]]. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|thermodynamically stable]] form at standard temperature and pressure. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen.\n\nThe most common [[oxidation state]] of carbon in [[inorganic compound]]s is +4, while +2 is found in [[carbon monoxide]] and [[transition metal]] [[Metal carbonyl|carbonyl]] complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are [[limestone]]s, [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]]s and [[carbon dioxide]], but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of [[coal]], [[peat]], [[petroleum|oil]], and [[methane clathrate]]s. Carbon forms a vast number of [[chemical compound|compounds]], more than any other element, with almost ten million compounds described to date,<ref name=lanl>{{cite web|author=Chemistry Operations|date=December 15, 2003|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html|title=Carbon|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|accessdate=2008-10-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913063402/http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html |archivedate=2008-09-13}}</ref> and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions.

For example, graphite can be oxidised by hot concentrated [[nitric acid]] at standard conditions to [[mellitic acid]], C<sub>6</sub>(CO<sub>2</sub>H)<sub>6</sub>, which preserves the hexagonal units of graphite while breaking up the larger structure.<ref name=Greenwood289>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 289\u2013292.</ref>\n\nCarbon sublimes in a carbon arc, which has a temperature of about 5800 K (5,530&nbsp;\u00b0C or 9,980&nbsp;\u00b0F). Thus, irrespective of its allotropic form, carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than the highest-melting-point metals such as [[tungsten]] or [[rhenium]]. Although thermodynamically prone to [[Redox|oxidation]], carbon resists oxidation more effectively than elements such as [[iron]] and [[copper]], which are weaker reducing agents at room temperature.\n\nCarbon is the sixth element, with a ground-state [[electron configuration]] of 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>2</sup>, of which the four outer electrons are [[valence electron]]s. Its first four ionisation energies, 1086.5, 2352.6, 4620.5 and 6222.7&nbsp;kJ/mol, are much higher than those of the heavier group-14 elements. The electronegativity of carbon is 2.5, significantly higher than the heavier group-14 elements (1.8\u20131.9), but close to most of the nearby nonmetals, as well as some of the second- and third-row [[transition metal]]s. Carbon's [[covalent radius|covalent radii]] are normally taken as 77.2&nbsp;pm (C\u2212C), 66.7&nbsp;pm (C=C) and 60.3&nbsp;pm (C\u2261C), although these may vary depending on coordination number and what the carbon is bonded to. In general, covalent radius decreases with lower coordination number and higher bond order.<ref name=Greenwood276>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 276\u20138.</ref>\n\nCarbon compounds form the basis of all known life on [[Earth]], and the [[CNO cycle|carbon\u2013nitrogen cycle]] provides some of the energy produced by the [[Sun]] and other [[star]]s. Although it forms an extraordinary variety of compounds, most forms of carbon are comparatively unreactive under normal conditions. At standard temperature and pressure, it resists all but the strongest oxidizers. It does not react with [[sulfuric acid]], [[hydrochloric acid]], [[chlorine]] or any [[Alkali metals|alkalis]]. At elevated temperatures, carbon reacts with [[oxygen]] to form [[Oxocarbon|carbon oxides]] and will rob oxygen from metal oxides to leave the elemental metal. This [[exothermic reaction]] is used in the iron and steel industry to [[Smelting|smelt]] iron and to control the carbon content of [[steel]]:\n\n:{{chem|Fe|3|O|4}} + 4 C{{sub|(s)}} \u2192 3 Fe{{sub|(s)}} + 4 CO{{sub|(g)}}\n\nCarbon monoxide can be recycled to smelt even more iron:\n\n:{{chem|Fe|3|O|4}} + 4 CO{{sub|(g)}} \u2192 3 Fe{{sub|(s)}} + 4 {{chem|C|O|2}}{{sub|(g)}}\n\nwith [[sulfur]] to form [[carbon disulfide]] and with steam in the coal-gas reaction:\n:C{{sub|(s)}} + H{{sub|2}}O{{sub|(g)}} \u2192 CO{{sub|(g)}} + H{{sub|2(g)}}.\nCarbon combines with some metals at high temperatures to form metallic carbides, such as the iron carbide [[cementite]] in steel and [[tungsten carbide]], widely used as an [[abrasive]] and for making hard tips for cutting tools.\n\nThe system of carbon allotropes spans a range of extremes:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|Graphite is one of the softest materials known.\n|style=\"width: 50%;\"|Synthetic [[Aggregated diamond nanorod|nanocrystalline diamond]] is the hardest material known.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Irifune |first1=Tetsuo |last2=Kurio |first2=Ayako |last3=Sakamoto |first3=Shizue |last4=Inoue |first4=Toru |last5=Sumiya |first5=Hitoshi |title=Materials: Ultrahard polycrystalline diamond from graphite |journal=Nature |volume=421 |pages=599\u2013600 |date=2003 |doi=10.1038/421599b |pmid=12571587 |issue=6923 |bibcode = 2003Natur.421..599I }}</ref>\n|-\n|Graphite is a very good [[lubricant]], displaying [[superlubricity]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Superlubricity of Graphite |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.126101 |pmid=15089689 |url=http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl/sections/cm/ip/group/PDF/Phys.rev.lett/2004/92(2004)12601.pdf |date=2004 |last1=Dienwiebel |first1=Martin |last2=Verhoeven |first2=Gertjan |last3=Pradeep |first3=Namboodiri |last4=Frenken |first4=Joost |last5=Heimberg |first5=Jennifer |last6=Zandbergen |first6=Henny |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=92 |issue=12 |pages=126101 |bibcode=2004PhRvL..92l6101D |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917120623/http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl/sections/cm/ip/group/PDF/Phys.rev.lett/2004/92(2004)12601.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-17|df=}}</ref>\n|Diamond is the ultimate [[abrasive]].\n|-\n|Graphite is a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] of electricity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Deprez |first1=N. |last2=McLachan |first2=D.

For example, [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] plants draw [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere (or seawater) and build it into biomass, as in the [[Calvin cycle]], a process of [[carbon fixation]]. Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, while some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide. The carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop; for example, some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans; if bacteria do not consume it, dead plant or animal matter may become [[petroleum]] or [[coal]], which releases carbon when burned.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Science|date=2000|volume=290|issue=5490|pages=291\u2013296|doi=10.1126/science.290.5490.291|title=The Global Carbon Cycle: A Test of Our Knowledge of Earth as a System|pmid=11030643|last1=Falkowski|first1=P.|last2=Scholes|first2=R.

A hydrocarbon backbone can be substituted by other atoms, known as [[heteroatom]]s. Common heteroatoms that appear in organic compounds include oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, and the nonradioactive halogens, as well as the metals lithium and magnesium. Organic compounds containing bonds to metal are known as organometallic compounds (''see below''). Certain groupings of atoms, often including heteroatoms, recur in large numbers of organic compounds. These collections, known as [[Functional group|''functional groups'']], confer common reactivity patterns and allow for the systematic study and categorization of organic compounds. Chain length, shape and functional groups all affect the properties of organic molecules.\n\nIn most stable compounds of carbon (and nearly all stable ''organic'' compounds), carbon obeys the [[octet rule]] and is ''tetravalent'', meaning that a carbon atom forms a total of four covalent bonds (which may include double and triple bonds). Exceptions include a small number of stabilized ''carbocations'' (three bonds, positive charge), ''radicals'' (three bonds, neutral), ''carbanions'' (three bonds, negative charge) and ''carbenes'' (two bonds, neutral), although these species are much more likely to be encountered as unstable, reactive intermediates.\n\nCarbon occurs in all known [[organic material|organic]] life and is the basis of [[organic chemistry]]. When united with [[hydrogen]], it forms various hydrocarbons that are important to industry as [[refrigerant]]s, [[lubricant]]s, [[solvent]]s, as chemical feedstock for the manufacture of [[plastic]]s and [[petrochemical]]s, and as [[fossil fuel]]s.\n\nWhen combined with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including [[sugar]]s, [[lignan]]s, [[chitin]]s, [[alcohol]]s, [[fat]]s, and aromatic [[ester]]s, [[carotenoid]]s and [[terpene]]s. With [[nitrogen]] it forms [[alkaloid]]s, and with the addition of sulfur also it forms [[antibiotic]]s, [[amino acid]]s, and [[rubber]] products. With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, it forms [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], the chemical-code carriers of life, and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), the most important energy-transfer molecule in all living cells.\n\n===Inorganic compounds===\nCommonly carbon-containing compounds which are associated with minerals or which do not contain bonds to the other carbon atoms, halogens, or hydrogen, are treated separately from classical [[organic compounds]]; the definition is not rigid, and the classification of some compounds can vary from author to author (see reference articles above).

A wide range of such compounds exist; major classes include simple alkyl-metal compounds (for example, [[tetraethyllead]]), \u03b7{{sup|2}}-alkene compounds (for example, [[Zeise's salt]]), and \u03b7{{sup|3}}-allyl compounds (for example, [[allylpalladium chloride dimer]]); [[metallocene]]s containing cyclopentadienyl ligands (for example, [[ferrocene]]); and [[transition metal carbene complex]]es. Many [[metal carbonyl]]s and [[Cyanometalate|metal cyanides]] exist (for example, [[tetracarbonylnickel]] and [[potassium ferricyanide]]); some workers consider metal carbonyl and cyanide complexes without other carbon ligands to be purely inorganic, and not organometallic. However, most organometallic chemists consider metal complexes with any carbon ligand, even 'inorganic carbon' (e.g., carbonyls, cyanides, and certain types of carbides and acetylides) to be organometallic in nature. Metal complexes containing organic ligands without a carbon-metal covalent bond (e.g., metal carboxylates) are termed ''metalorganic'' compounds.\n\nWhile carbon is understood to strongly prefer formation of four covalent bonds, other exotic bonding schemes are also known. [[Carborane]]s are highly stable dodecahedral derivatives of the [B<sub>12</sub>H<sub>12</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> unit, with one BH replaced with a CH<sup>+</sup>.  Thus, the carbon is bonded to five boron atoms and one hydrogen atom. The cation [(Ph{{sub|3}}PAu){{sub|6}}C]{{sup|2+}} contains an octahedral carbon bound to six phosphine-gold fragments. This phenomenon has been attributed to the [[aurophilicity]] of the gold ligands, which provide additional stabilization of an otherwise labile species.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/anie.198815441|author=Scherbaum, Franz|journal=[[Angew.

Graphite deposits are of [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] origin, found in association with [[quartz]], [[mica]] and [[feldspar]]s in schists, [[gneiss]]es and metamorphosed [[sandstone]]s and [[limestone]] as [[lens (geology)|lenses]] or [[vein (geology)|veins]], sometimes of a metre or more in thickness. Deposits of graphite in [[Borrowdale]], [[Cumberland]], [[England]] were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, [[pencil]]s were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood. Today, smaller deposits of graphite are obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite out on water.<ref name=USGS>[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/graphite USGS Minerals Yearbook: Graphite, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916114706/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/graphite/ |date=2008-09-16 }} and Graphite: Mineral Commodity Summaries 2011</ref>\n\nThere are three types of natural graphite\u2014amorphous, flake or crystalline flake, and vein or lump. Amorphous graphite is the lowest quality and most abundant. Contrary to science, in industry \"amorphous\" refers to very small crystal size rather than complete lack of crystal structure. Amorphous is used for lower value graphite products and is the lowest priced graphite. Large amorphous graphite deposits are found in China, Europe, Mexico and the United States. Flake graphite is less common and of higher quality than amorphous; it occurs as separate plates that crystallized in metamorphic rock. Flake graphite can be four times the price of amorphous. Good quality flakes can be processed into expandable graphite for many uses, such as [[flame retardant]]s. The foremost deposits are found in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany and Madagascar. Vein or lump graphite is the rarest, most valuable, and highest quality type of natural graphite. It occurs in veins along intrusive contacts in solid lumps, and it is only commercially mined in Sri Lanka.<ref name=USGS/>\n\nAccording to the [[USGS]], world production of natural graphite was 1.1&nbsp;million tonnes in 2010, to which China contributed 800,000&nbsp;t, India 130,000 t, Brazil 76,000&nbsp;t, North Korea 30,000&nbsp;t and Canada 25,000 t. No natural graphite was reported mined in the United States, but 118,000 t of synthetic graphite with an estimated value of $998&nbsp;million was produced in 2009.<ref name=USGS/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Diamond ===\n\n{{main|Diamond}}\n[[File:Global Diamond Output in 2005.png|thumb|upright=2.0|Diamond output in 2005]]\n\nThe diamond supply chain is controlled by a limited number of powerful businesses, and is also highly concentrated in a small number of locations around the world (see figure).\n\nOnly a very small fraction of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care has to be taken in order to prevent larger diamonds from being destroyed in this process and subsequently the particles are sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of [[X-ray fluorescence]], after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of [[X-ray]]s became commonplace, the separation was done with grease belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to grease than the other minerals in the ore.<ref>{{cite book|page=223|title=The nature of diamonds|author=Harlow, G.

The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the [[fossil fuel]] [[methane]] gas and [[crude oil]] (petroleum). [[Petroleum|Crude oil]] is [[distillation|distilled]] in [[Oil refinery|refineries]] by the [[petrochemical industry]] to produce [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]], and other products. [[Cellulose]] is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of [[wood]], [[cotton]], [[linen]], and [[hemp]]. [[Cellulose]] is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include [[wool]], [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]] and [[silk]]. [[Plastics]] are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.\n\nThe uses of carbon and its compounds are extremely varied. It can form [[alloys]] with [[iron]], of which the most common is [[carbon steel]]. [[Graphite]] is combined with [[clay]]s to form the 'lead' used in [[pencil]]s used for [[writing]] and [[drawing]]. It is also used as a [[lubricant]] and a [[pigment]], as a molding material in [[glass]] manufacture, in [[electrodes]] for dry [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and in [[electroplating]] and [[electroforming]], in [[brush (electric)|brushes]] for [[electric motors]] and as a [[neutron moderator]] in [[nuclear reactors]].\n\n[[Charcoal]] is used as a drawing material in [[art]]work, barbecue [[grilling]], [[iron smelting]], and in many other applications. Wood, coal and oil are used as [[fuel]] for production of energy and [[heating]]. Gem quality [[diamond]] is used in jewelry, and [[industrial diamond]]s are used in drilling, cutting and polishing tools for machining metals and stone. Plastics are made from fossil hydrocarbons, and [[carbon fiber]], made by [[pyrolysis]] of synthetic [[polyester]] [[fiber]]s is used to reinforce plastics to form advanced, lightweight [[composite materials]].\n\n[[Carbon fiber]] is made by pyrolysis of extruded and stretched filaments of [[polyacrylonitrile]] (PAN) and other organic substances. The crystallographic structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend on the type of starting material, and on the subsequent processing. Carbon fibers made from PAN have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite, but thermal processing may re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet. The result is fibers with higher [[specific strength|specific tensile strength]] than steel.<ref name=\"cantwell\">{{cite journal|first1=W.

[[Activated charcoal]] is used as an [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]] and [[adsorbent]] in [[Filter (chemistry)|filter]] material in applications as diverse as [[gas masks]], [[water purification]], and [[kitchen]] [[extractor hood]]s, and in medicine to [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorb]] toxins, poisons, or gases from the [[Human digestive system|digestive system]]. Carbon is used in [[Redox|chemical reduction]] at high temperatures. [[Coke (fuel)|Coke]] is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). [[Case hardening]] of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. [[Carbide]]s of [[silicon carbide|silicon]], [[tungsten carbide|tungsten]], [[boron carbide|boron]] and [[titanium carbide|titanium]], are among the hardest known materials, and are used as [[abrasives]] in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make up most of the materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic [[textiles]] and [[leather]], and almost all of the interior surfaces in the [[built environment]] other than glass, stone and metal.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Diamonds===\nThe [[diamond]] industry falls into two categories: one dealing with gem-grade diamonds and the other, with industrial-grade diamonds. While a large trade in both types of diamonds exists, the two markets function dramatically differently.\n\nUnlike [[precious metal]]s such as [[gold]] or [[platinum]], gem diamonds do not trade as a [[commodity]]: there is a substantial mark-up in the sale of diamonds, and there is not a very active market for resale of diamonds.\n\nIndustrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity, with the gemological qualities of clarity and color being mostly irrelevant. About 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20&nbsp;tonnes annually) are unsuitable for use as gemstones are relegated for industrial use (known as ''[[bort]])''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Turning And Mechanical Manipulation|first=Ch.|last=Holtzapffel|publisher=Charles Holtzapffel|date=1856|url=https://archive.org/details/turningandmecha01holtgoog|df=}} [https://archive.org/details/turningmechanica02holtuoft Internet Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326085110/https://archive.org/details/turningmechanica02holtuoft |date=2016-03-26 }}</ref> [[synthetic diamond]]s, invented in the 1950s, found almost immediate industrial applications; 3&nbsp;billion carats (600&nbsp;[[tonne]]s) of synthetic diamond is produced annually.<ref name=\"usgs\">{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/diamond/|accessdate=2009-05-05|title=Industrial Diamonds Statistics and Information|publisher=United States Geological Survey|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506221551/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/diamond/|archivedate=2009-05-06|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe dominant industrial use of diamond is in cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing.

For example, graphite is [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and black while diamond is highly [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]]. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the [[Greeks|Greek]] verb \"\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\" which means \"to write\"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known.

Under normal conditions, diamond, [[carbon nanotube]]s, and [[graphene]] have the highest [[thermal conductivity|thermal conductivities]] of [[List of thermal conductivities|all known materials]].

For example, graphite can be oxidised by hot concentrated [[nitric acid]] at standard conditions to [[mellitic acid]], C<sub>6</sub>(CO<sub>2</sub>H)<sub>6</sub>, which preserves the hexagonal units of graphite while breaking up the larger structure.<ref name=Greenwood289>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 289\u2013292.</ref>\n\nCarbon sublimes in a carbon arc, which has a temperature of about 5800 K (5,530&nbsp;\u00b0C or 9,980&nbsp;\u00b0F). Thus, irrespective of its allotropic form, carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than the highest-melting-point metals such as [[tungsten]] or [[rhenium]]. Although thermodynamically prone to [[Redox|oxidation]], carbon resists oxidation more effectively than elements such as [[iron]] and [[copper]], which are weaker reducing agents at room temperature.\n\nCarbon is the sixth element, with a ground-state [[electron configuration]] of 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>2</sup>, of which the four outer electrons are [[valence electron]]s. Its first four ionisation energies, 1086.5, 2352.6, 4620.5 and 6222.7&nbsp;kJ/mol, are much higher than those of the heavier group-14 elements. The electronegativity of carbon is 2.5, significantly higher than the heavier group-14 elements (1.8\u20131.9), but close to most of the nearby nonmetals, as well as some of the second- and third-row [[transition metal]]s. Carbon's [[covalent radius|covalent radii]] are normally taken as 77.2&nbsp;pm (C\u2212C), 66.7&nbsp;pm (C=C) and 60.3&nbsp;pm (C\u2261C), although these may vary depending on coordination number and what the carbon is bonded to. In general, covalent radius decreases with lower coordination number and higher bond order.<ref name=Greenwood276>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 276\u20138.</ref>\n\nCarbon compounds form the basis of all known life on [[Earth]], and the [[CNO cycle|carbon\u2013nitrogen cycle]] provides some of the energy produced by the [[Sun]] and other [[star]]s. Although it forms an extraordinary variety of compounds, most forms of carbon are comparatively unreactive under normal conditions. At standard temperature and pressure, it resists all but the strongest oxidizers. It does not react with [[sulfuric acid]], [[hydrochloric acid]], [[chlorine]] or any [[Alkali metals|alkalis]]. At elevated temperatures, carbon reacts with [[oxygen]] to form [[Oxocarbon|carbon oxides]] and will rob oxygen from metal oxides to leave the elemental metal.

For example, [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] plants draw [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere (or seawater) and build it into biomass, as in the [[Calvin cycle]], a process of [[carbon fixation]]. Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, while some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide. The carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop; for example, some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans; if bacteria do not consume it, dead plant or animal matter may become [[petroleum]] or [[coal]], which releases carbon when burned.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Science|date=2000|volume=290|issue=5490|pages=291\u2013296|doi=10.1126/science.290.5490.291|title=The Global Carbon Cycle: A Test of Our Knowledge of Earth as a System|pmid=11030643|last1=Falkowski|first1=P.|last2=Scholes|first2=R.

A hydrocarbon backbone can be substituted by other atoms, known as [[heteroatom]]s. Common heteroatoms that appear in organic compounds include oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, and the nonradioactive halogens, as well as the metals lithium and magnesium. Organic compounds containing bonds to metal are known as organometallic compounds (''see below''). Certain groupings of atoms, often including heteroatoms, recur in large numbers of organic compounds. These collections, known as [[Functional group|''functional groups'']], confer common reactivity patterns and allow for the systematic study and categorization of organic compounds. Chain length, shape and functional groups all affect the properties of organic molecules.\n\nIn most stable compounds of carbon (and nearly all stable ''organic'' compounds), carbon obeys the [[octet rule]] and is ''tetravalent'', meaning that a carbon atom forms a total of four covalent bonds (which may include double and triple bonds). Exceptions include a small number of stabilized ''carbocations'' (three bonds, positive charge), ''radicals'' (three bonds, neutral), ''carbanions'' (three bonds, negative charge) and ''carbenes'' (two bonds, neutral), although these species are much more likely to be encountered as unstable, reactive intermediates.\n\nCarbon occurs in all known [[organic material|organic]] life and is the basis of [[organic chemistry]]. When united with [[hydrogen]], it forms various hydrocarbons that are important to industry as [[refrigerant]]s, [[lubricant]]s, [[solvent]]s, as chemical feedstock for the manufacture of [[plastic]]s and [[petrochemical]]s, and as [[fossil fuel]]s.\n\nWhen combined with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including [[sugar]]s, [[lignan]]s, [[chitin]]s, [[alcohol]]s, [[fat]]s, and aromatic [[ester]]s, [[carotenoid]]s and [[terpene]]s. With [[nitrogen]] it forms [[alkaloid]]s, and with the addition of sulfur also it forms [[antibiotic]]s, [[amino acid]]s, and [[rubber]] products. With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, it forms [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], the chemical-code carriers of life, and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), the most important energy-transfer molecule in all living cells.\n\n===Inorganic compounds===\nCommonly carbon-containing compounds which are associated with minerals or which do not contain bonds to the other carbon atoms, halogens, or hydrogen, are treated separately from classical [[organic compounds]]; the definition is not rigid, and the classification of some compounds can vary from author to author (see reference articles above).

A wide range of such compounds exist; major classes include simple alkyl-metal compounds (for example, [[tetraethyllead]]), \u03b7{{sup|2}}-alkene compounds (for example, [[Zeise's salt]]), and \u03b7{{sup|3}}-allyl compounds (for example, [[allylpalladium chloride dimer]]); [[metallocene]]s containing cyclopentadienyl ligands (for example, [[ferrocene]]); and [[transition metal carbene complex]]es. Many [[metal carbonyl]]s and [[Cyanometalate|metal cyanides]] exist (for example, [[tetracarbonylnickel]] and [[potassium ferricyanide]]); some workers consider metal carbonyl and cyanide complexes without other carbon ligands to be purely inorganic, and not organometallic. However, most organometallic chemists consider metal complexes with any carbon ligand, even 'inorganic carbon' (e.g., carbonyls, cyanides, and certain types of carbides and acetylides) to be organometallic in nature. Metal complexes containing organic ligands without a carbon-metal covalent bond (e.g., metal carboxylates) are termed ''metalorganic'' compounds.\n\nWhile carbon is understood to strongly prefer formation of four covalent bonds, other exotic bonding schemes are also known. [[Carborane]]s are highly stable dodecahedral derivatives of the [B<sub>12</sub>H<sub>12</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> unit, with one BH replaced with a CH<sup>+</sup>.  Thus, the carbon is bonded to five boron atoms and one hydrogen atom. The cation [(Ph{{sub|3}}PAu){{sub|6}}C]{{sup|2+}} contains an octahedral carbon bound to six phosphine-gold fragments. This phenomenon has been attributed to the [[aurophilicity]] of the gold ligands, which provide additional stabilization of an otherwise labile species.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/anie.198815441|author=Scherbaum, Franz|journal=[[Angew.

Graphite deposits are of [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] origin, found in association with [[quartz]], [[mica]] and [[feldspar]]s in schists, [[gneiss]]es and metamorphosed [[sandstone]]s and [[limestone]] as [[lens (geology)|lenses]] or [[vein (geology)|veins]], sometimes of a metre or more in thickness. Deposits of graphite in [[Borrowdale]], [[Cumberland]], [[England]] were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, [[pencil]]s were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood. Today, smaller deposits of graphite are obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite out on water.<ref name=USGS>[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/graphite USGS Minerals Yearbook: Graphite, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916114706/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/graphite/ |date=2008-09-16 }} and Graphite: Mineral Commodity Summaries 2011</ref>\n\nThere are three types of natural graphite\u2014amorphous, flake or crystalline flake, and vein or lump. Amorphous graphite is the lowest quality and most abundant. Contrary to science, in industry \"amorphous\" refers to very small crystal size rather than complete lack of crystal structure. Amorphous is used for lower value graphite products and is the lowest priced graphite. Large amorphous graphite deposits are found in China, Europe, Mexico and the United States. Flake graphite is less common and of higher quality than amorphous; it occurs as separate plates that crystallized in metamorphic rock. Flake graphite can be four times the price of amorphous. Good quality flakes can be processed into expandable graphite for many uses, such as [[flame retardant]]s. The foremost deposits are found in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany and Madagascar. Vein or lump graphite is the rarest, most valuable, and highest quality type of natural graphite. It occurs in veins along intrusive contacts in solid lumps, and it is only commercially mined in Sri Lanka.<ref name=USGS/>\n\nAccording to the [[USGS]], world production of natural graphite was 1.1&nbsp;million tonnes in 2010, to which China contributed 800,000&nbsp;t, India 130,000 t, Brazil 76,000&nbsp;t, North Korea 30,000&nbsp;t and Canada 25,000 t. No natural graphite was reported mined in the United States, but 118,000 t of synthetic graphite with an estimated value of $998&nbsp;million was produced in 2009.<ref name=USGS/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Diamond ===\n\n{{main|Diamond}}\n[[File:Global Diamond Output in 2005.png|thumb|upright=2.0|Diamond output in 2005]]\n\nThe diamond supply chain is controlled by a limited number of powerful businesses, and is also highly concentrated in a small number of locations around the world (see figure).\n\nOnly a very small fraction of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care has to be taken in order to prevent larger diamonds from being destroyed in this process and subsequently the particles are sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of [[X-ray fluorescence]], after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of [[X-ray]]s became commonplace, the separation was done with grease belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to grease than the other minerals in the ore.<ref>{{cite book|page=223|title=The nature of diamonds|author=Harlow, G.

The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the [[fossil fuel]] [[methane]] gas and [[crude oil]] (petroleum). [[Petroleum|Crude oil]] is [[distillation|distilled]] in [[Oil refinery|refineries]] by the [[petrochemical industry]] to produce [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]], and other products. [[Cellulose]] is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of [[wood]], [[cotton]], [[linen]], and [[hemp]]. [[Cellulose]] is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include [[wool]], [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]] and [[silk]]. [[Plastics]] are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.\n\nThe uses of carbon and its compounds are extremely varied. It can form [[alloys]] with [[iron]], of which the most common is [[carbon steel]]. [[Graphite]] is combined with [[clay]]s to form the 'lead' used in [[pencil]]s used for [[writing]] and [[drawing]]. It is also used as a [[lubricant]] and a [[pigment]], as a molding material in [[glass]] manufacture, in [[electrodes]] for dry [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and in [[electroplating]] and [[electroforming]], in [[brush (electric)|brushes]] for [[electric motors]] and as a [[neutron moderator]] in [[nuclear reactors]].\n\n[[Charcoal]] is used as a drawing material in [[art]]work, barbecue [[grilling]], [[iron smelting]], and in many other applications. Wood, coal and oil are used as [[fuel]] for production of energy and [[heating]]. Gem quality [[diamond]] is used in jewelry, and [[industrial diamond]]s are used in drilling, cutting and polishing tools for machining metals and stone. Plastics are made from fossil hydrocarbons, and [[carbon fiber]], made by [[pyrolysis]] of synthetic [[polyester]] [[fiber]]s is used to reinforce plastics to form advanced, lightweight [[composite materials]].\n\n[[Carbon fiber]] is made by pyrolysis of extruded and stretched filaments of [[polyacrylonitrile]] (PAN) and other organic substances. The crystallographic structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend on the type of starting material, and on the subsequent processing. Carbon fibers made from PAN have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite, but thermal processing may re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet. The result is fibers with higher [[specific strength|specific tensile strength]] than steel.<ref name=\"cantwell\">{{cite journal|first1=W.

[[Activated charcoal]] is used as an [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]] and [[adsorbent]] in [[Filter (chemistry)|filter]] material in applications as diverse as [[gas masks]], [[water purification]], and [[kitchen]] [[extractor hood]]s, and in medicine to [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorb]] toxins, poisons, or gases from the [[Human digestive system|digestive system]]. Carbon is used in [[Redox|chemical reduction]] at high temperatures. [[Coke (fuel)|Coke]] is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). [[Case hardening]] of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. [[Carbide]]s of [[silicon carbide|silicon]], [[tungsten carbide|tungsten]], [[boron carbide|boron]] and [[titanium carbide|titanium]], are among the hardest known materials, and are used as [[abrasives]] in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make up most of the materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic [[textiles]] and [[leather]], and almost all of the interior surfaces in the [[built environment]] other than glass, stone and metal.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Diamonds===\nThe [[diamond]] industry falls into two categories: one dealing with gem-grade diamonds and the other, with industrial-grade diamonds. While a large trade in both types of diamonds exists, the two markets function dramatically differently.\n\nUnlike [[precious metal]]s such as [[gold]] or [[platinum]], gem diamonds do not trade as a [[commodity]]: there is a substantial mark-up in the sale of diamonds, and there is not a very active market for resale of diamonds.\n\nIndustrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity, with the gemological qualities of clarity and color being mostly irrelevant. About 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20&nbsp;tonnes annually) are unsuitable for use as gemstones are relegated for industrial use (known as ''[[bort]])''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Turning And Mechanical Manipulation|first=Ch.|last=Holtzapffel|publisher=Charles Holtzapffel|date=1856|url=https://archive.org/details/turningandmecha01holtgoog|df=}} [https://archive.org/details/turningmechanica02holtuoft Internet Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326085110/https://archive.org/details/turningmechanica02holtuoft |date=2016-03-26 }}</ref> [[synthetic diamond]]s, invented in the 1950s, found almost immediate industrial applications; 3&nbsp;billion carats (600&nbsp;[[tonne]]s) of synthetic diamond is produced annually.<ref name=\"usgs\">{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/diamond/|accessdate=2009-05-05|title=Industrial Diamonds Statistics and Information|publisher=United States Geological Survey|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506221551/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/diamond/|archivedate=2009-05-06|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe dominant industrial use of diamond is in cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing.
