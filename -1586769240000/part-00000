There were six major campaigns: 1231, 1232, 1235, 1238, 1247, 1253; between 1253 and 1258, the Mongols under [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]]'s general [[Jalairtai Qorchi]] launched four devastating invasions against Korea at tremendous cost to civilian lives throughout the Korean peninsula.\n\nCivilian resistance was strong, and the Imperial Court at Ganghwa attempted to strengthen its fortress. Korea won several victories but the Korean military could not withstand the waves of invasions. The repeated Mongol invasions caused havoc, loss of human lives and famine in Korea. In 1236, Gojong ordered the recreation of the ''Tripitaka Koreana'', which was destroyed during the 1232 invasion. This collection of Buddhist scriptures took 15 years to carve on some 81,000 wooden blocks, and is preserved to this day.\n\nIn March 1258, the dictator [[Choe Ui]] was assassinated by [[Kim Jun (Goryeo)|Kim Jun]]. Thus, dictatorship by his military group was ended, and the scholars who had insisted on peace with Mongolia gained power.

He was forced to spend many years at the Yuan court, being sent there in 1341 as a virtual prisoner before becoming king. He married the Mongol princess [[Queen Noguk]]. But in the mid-14th century the Yuan was beginning to crumble, soon to be replaced by the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1368. King Gongmin began efforts to reform the Goryeo government and remove Mongolian influences.\n\nHis first act was to remove all pro-Mongol aristocrats and military officers from their positions. Mongols had annexed the northern provinces of Goryeo after the invasions and incorporated them into their empire as the [[Ssangseong]] and [[Dongnyeong Prefectures]]. The Goryeo army retook these provinces partly thanks to defection from [[Yi Jachun]], a minor Korean official in service of Mongols in Ssangseong, and his son Yi Seonggye. In addition, Generals Yi Seonggye and Ji Yongsu led a campaign into [[Liaoyang]].\n\nAfter the death of Gongmin's wife Noguk in 1365, he fell into depression. In the end, he became indifferent to politics and entrusted that great task to the Buddhist monk [[Shin Don]]. But after six years, Shin Don lost his position. In 1374, Gongmin was killed by Hong Ryun ({{korean|labels=no|\ud64d\ub95c}}), Choe Mansaeng ({{korean|labels=no|\ucd5c\ub9cc\uc0dd}}), and others.\n\nAfter his death, a high official [[Yi In-im]] assumed the helm of the government and enthroned eleven-year-old, King U, the son of King Gongmin.\n\nDuring this tumultuous period, Goryeo momentarily conquered [[Liaoyang]] in 1356, repulsed two large [[Red Turban invasions of Goryeo|invasions by the Red Turbans]] in 1359 and 1360, and defeated the final attempt by the Yuan to dominate Goryeo when General [[Choe Yeong]] defeated an invading Mongol [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]] in 1364.

The Liao invasions of Kory\u014f from 993 to 1020 were successfully repelled by the Koreans. The Chin made no serious attempts against Kory\u014f. The dynastic historians accepted nevertheless the official fiction and referred to Kory\u014f by an unrealistic terminology.{{sfn|Bielenstein|2005|p=182}}<br /><br />To repeat, Kory\u014f was not a vassal with tributary duties to the Five Dynasties, Sung, Liao, and Chin.

Like most other early Goryeo monks, he began his studies in Buddhism with the Hwaeom school. He later traveled to China, and upon his return, actively promulgated the ''[[Cheontae]]'' (\u5929\u53f0\u5b97, or ''[[Tiantai]]'' in Chinese) teachings, which became recognized as another Seon school. This period thus came to be described as \"five doctrinal and two meditational schools\" (''ogyo yangjong''). Uicheon himself, however, alienated too many Seon adherents, and he died at a relatively young age without seeing a Seon-Gyo unity accomplished.\n[[File:Goryeo Seobun.jpg|160px|thumb|Gwangyeongseopum Byeonsangdo, Goryeo buddhist painting.]]\nThe most important figure of Seon in the Goryeo was ''[[Jinul]]'' (\u77e5\u8a25; 1158\u20131210). In his time, the sangha was in a crisis of external appearance and internal issues of doctrine. Buddhism had gradually become infected by secular tendencies and involvements, such as fortune-telling and the offering of prayers and rituals for success in secular endeavors. This kind of corruption resulted in the profusion of increasingly larger numbers of monks and nuns with questionable motivations. Therefore, the correction, revival, and improvement of the quality of Buddhism were prominent issues for Buddhist leaders of the period.\n\nJinul sought to establish a new movement within Korean Seon, which he called the ''\"[[sam\u0101dhi]] and [[praj\u00f1a|praj\u00f1\u0101]] society\"'',<ref name=\"Alexander\">Alexander Wynee, \u300aBuddhism: An Introduction\u300b, I.B. Tauris, 2015. {{ISBN|1848853971}} p.236</ref> whose goal was to establish a new community of disciplined, pure-minded practitioners deep in the mountains.<ref name=\"Keel\" /> He eventually accomplished this mission with the founding of the Seonggwangsa monastery at Mt. Jogye (\u66f9\u6eaa\u5c71).<ref name=\"Keel\" /> Jinul's works are characterized by a thorough analysis and reformulation of the methodologies of Seon study and practice. One major issue that had long fermented in Chinese ''[[Zen|Seon]]'', and which received special focus from Jinul, was the relationship between \"gradual\" and \"sudden\" methods in practice and enlightenment. Drawing upon various Chinese treatments of this topic, most importantly those by '''[[Zongmi]]''' (780-841) and '''Dahui''' (\u5927\u6167; 1089\u20131163),<ref>Damien Keown, Charles S.Prebish, \u300aEncyclopedia of Buddhism\u300b, Routledge, 2013. {{ISBN|1136985883}} p.226</ref> Jinul created a  \"sudden enlightenment followed by gradual practice\" dictum, which he outlined in a few relatively concise and accessible texts.<ref>Steven Heine, \u300aLike Cats and Dogs:Contesting the Mu Koan in Zen Buddhism\u300b, OUP USA, 2013. {{ISBN|0199837309}} p.82</ref> From Dahui, Jinul also incorporated the ''gwanhwa'' (\u89c0\u8a71) method into his practice.<ref name=\"Alexander\" /> This form of meditation is the main method taught in Korean Seon today. Jinul's philosophical resolution of the Seon-Gyo conflict brought a deep and lasting effect on Korean Buddhism.\n\n[[File:Goryeo-Illustrated manuscript of the Lotus Sutra c.1340 (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright=2|Illustrated manuscript of the [[Lotus Sutra]], {{circa}} 1340]]\nThe general trend of Buddhism in the latter half of the Goryeo was a decline due to corruption, and the rise of strong anti-Buddhist political and philosophical sentiment.<ref>Sonja Vegdahl, Ben Hur, \u300aCultureShock! Korea: A Survival Guide to Customs and Etiquette\u300b, Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd, 2008. {{ISBN|9814408948}} p.9</ref> However, this period of relative decadence would nevertheless produce some of Korea's most renowned Seon masters. Three important monks of this period who figured prominently in charting the future course of Korean Seon were contemporaries and friends: '''Gyeonghan Baeg'un''' (\u666f\u9591\u767d\u96f2; 1298\u20131374), '''Taego Bou''' (\u592a\u53e4\u666e\u611a; 1301\u20131382) and '''Naong Hyegeun''' (\u61f6\u7fc1\u6167\u52e4; 1320\u20131376). All three went to [[Yuan China]] to learn the ''[[Linji school|Linji]]'' (\u81e8\u6fdf or ''[[Imje]]'' in [[Korean language|Korean]]) ''gwanhwa'' teaching that had been popularized by Jinul. All three returned, and established the sharp, confrontational methods of the Imje school in their own teaching. Each of the three was also said to have had hundreds of disciples, such that this new infusion into Korean Seon brought about considerable effect. Despite the Imje influence, which was generally considered to be anti-scholarly in nature, Gyeonghan and Naong, under the influence of Jinul and the traditional ''[[tong bulgyo]]'' tendency, showed an unusual interest in scriptural study, as well as a strong understanding of ''[[Confucianism]]'' and ''[[Taoism]]'', due to the increasing influence of Chinese philosophy as the foundation of official education. From this time, a marked tendency for Korean Buddhist monks to be \"three teachings\" exponents appeared.\n\nA significant historical event of the Goryeo period is the production of the first woodblock edition of the [[Tripitaka]], called the [[Tripitaka Koreana]]. Two editions were made, the first one completed from 1210 to 1231, and the second one from 1214 to 1259. The first edition was destroyed in a fire, during an attack by [[Mongol]] invaders in 1232, but the second edition is still in existence at [[Haeinsa]] in [[Gyeongsang]] province. This edition of the Tripitaka was of high quality, and served as the standard version of the Tripitaka in East Asia for almost 700 years.<ref name=\"Sakya2\">Madhusudan Sakya, \u3008Current Perspectives in Buddhism: Buddhism today / issues&global dimensions\u3009, Cyber Tech Publications, 2011. {{ISBN|8178847337}}. p.111</ref>\n\n====Confucianism====\n{{Main|Korean Confucianism}}\n[[Gwangjong of Goryeo|Emperor Gwangjong]] creating the [[Gwageo|national civil service examinations]].<ref name=\"Djun2\">{{harvnb|Kim|2014}}, p. 64.</ref> and [[Seongjong of Goryeo|King Seongjong]] was a key figure in establishing Confucianism.

Stoneware with underglaze slip decoration and celadon glaze. [[Celadon]] ceramics of the Goryeo dynasty (918\u20131392) are among the most celebrated works of Korean art. Their luminous green color is the result of iron in both the clay and the glaze oxidizing in a reduction kiln. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nThe ceramics of Goryeo are considered by some to be the finest small-scale works of ceramics in Korean history.\nKey-fret, foliate designs, geometric or scrolling flowerhead bands, elliptical panels, stylized fish and insects, and the use of incised designs began at this time. Glazes were usually various shades of celadon, with browned glazes to almost black glazes being used for stoneware and storage. Celadon glazes could be rendered almost transparent to show black and white inlays.\n\nWhile the forms generally seen are broad-shouldered bottles, larger low bowls or shallow smaller bowls, highly decorated celadon cosmetic boxes, and small slip-inlaid cups, the Buddhist potteries also produced melon-shaped vases, chrysanthemum cups often of spectacularly architectural design on stands with lotus motifs and lotus flower heads. In-curving rimmed alms bowls have also been discovered similar to Korean metalware. Wine cups often had a tall foot which rested on dish-shaped stands.\n\n====Lacquerware with mother of pearl inlay====\nDuring the Goryeo period, lacquerware with mother-of-pearl inlay reached a high point of technical and aesthetic achievement and was widely used by members of the aristocracy for Buddhist ritual implements and vessels, as well as horse saddles and royal carriages. Inlaid lacquers combine texture, color, and shape to produce a dazzling effect in both large and small objects. Although Korean lacquerware of the Goryeo period was highly prized throughout East Asia, fewer than fifteen examples are known to have survived, one of which is this exquisite box in the Museum's collection. This paucity of material is largely attributable to the fragility of lacquer objects and, to a certain extent, to wars and raids by foreign powers, notably those launched from Japan by Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536\u20131598) in the late sixteenth century.\n[[File:Cosmetic box, stoneware with celadon glaze, Goryeo Dynasty.jpg|thumb|upright|A Korean stoneware cosmetic box with white and black inlay and a [[celadon]] glaze, from the Goryeo Dynasty, dated c. 1150\u20131250]]\n[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/25.215.41a,b More info on Goryeo lacquerware]\n\n====Construction techniques====\nThese ceramics are of a hard porcellaneous body with porcelain stone as one of the key ingredients; however, it is not to be confused with porcelain. The body is low clay, quartz rich, high potassia and virtually identical in composition to the Chinese Yueh ceramics which scholars hypothesize occasioned the first production of celadon in Korea. The glaze is an ash glaze with iron colourant, fired in a reduction atmosphere in a modified Chinese-style 'dragon' kiln. The distinctive blue-grey-green of Korean celadon is caused by the iron content of the glaze with a minimum of titanium contaminant, which modifies the color to a greener cast, as can be seen in Chinese Yueh wares. However, the Goryeo potters took the glaze in a different direction than their Chinese forebears; instead of relying solely on underglaze incised designs, they eventually developed the ''sanggam'' technique of inlaying black (magnetite) and white (quartz) which created bold contrast with the glaze. Scholars also theorize that this developed in part to an inlay tradition in Korean metalworks and lacquer, and also to the dissatisfaction with the nearly invisible effect of incising when done under a thick celadon glaze.<ref>Wood, Nigel. \"Technological Parallels between Chinese Yue wares and Korean celadons.\" in Papers of the British Association for Korean Studies (BAKS Papers), vol 5.

Technology in Korea took a big step in Goryeo and strong relation with the [[Song dynasty]] contributed to this. In the dynasty, Korean ceramics and paper, which come down to now, started to be manufactured.\n\nDuring the late Goryeo Dynasty, Goryeo was at the cutting edge of shipboard artillery. In 1356 early experiments were carried out with gunpowder weapons that shot wood or metal projectiles. In 1373 experiments with incendiary arrows and \"fire tubes\" possibly an early form of the [[Hwacha]] were developed and placed on Korean warships. The policy of placing cannons and other gunpowder weapons continued well into the [[Joseon]] dynasty and by 1410, over 160 Joseon warships had cannons on board.

There were six major campaigns: 1231, 1232, 1235, 1238, 1247, 1253; between 1253 and 1258, the Mongols under [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]]'s general [[Jalairtai Qorchi]] launched four devastating invasions against Korea at tremendous cost to civilian lives throughout the Korean peninsula.\n\nCivilian resistance was strong, and the Imperial Court at Ganghwa attempted to strengthen its fortress. Korea won several victories but the Korean military could not withstand the waves of invasions. The repeated Mongol invasions caused havoc, loss of human lives and famine in Korea. In 1236, Gojong ordered the recreation of the ''Tripitaka Koreana'', which was destroyed during the 1232 invasion.

By 1356 Goryeo regained its lost northern territories.\n\n====Last reform====\n[[File:Goryeo-Portrait of Yeom Jesin.jpg|140px|thumb|Yeom Jesin (1304\u20131382) was the main political opponent of the monk, Shin Don, who was in power.]]\n\nWhen King Gongmin ascended to the throne, Goryeo was under the influence of the Mongol Yuan China. He was forced to spend many years at the Yuan court, being sent there in 1341 as a virtual prisoner before becoming king. He married the Mongol princess [[Queen Noguk]]. But in the mid-14th century the Yuan was beginning to crumble, soon to be replaced by the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1368. King Gongmin began efforts to reform the Goryeo government and remove Mongolian influences.\n\nHis first act was to remove all pro-Mongol aristocrats and military officers from their positions. Mongols had annexed the northern provinces of Goryeo after the invasions and incorporated them into their empire as the [[Ssangseong]] and [[Dongnyeong Prefectures]]. The Goryeo army retook these provinces partly thanks to defection from [[Yi Jachun]], a minor Korean official in service of Mongols in Ssangseong, and his son Yi Seonggye. In addition, Generals Yi Seonggye and Ji Yongsu led a campaign into [[Liaoyang]].\n\nAfter the death of Gongmin's wife Noguk in 1365, he fell into depression. In the end, he became indifferent to politics and entrusted that great task to the Buddhist monk [[Shin Don]]. But after six years, Shin Don lost his position. In 1374, Gongmin was killed by Hong Ryun ({{korean|labels=no|\ud64d\ub95c}}), Choe Mansaeng ({{korean|labels=no|\ucd5c\ub9cc\uc0dd}}), and others.\n\nAfter his death, a high official [[Yi In-im]] assumed the helm of the government and enthroned eleven-year-old, King U, the son of King Gongmin.\n\nDuring this tumultuous period, Goryeo momentarily conquered [[Liaoyang]] in 1356, repulsed two large [[Red Turban invasions of Goryeo|invasions by the Red Turbans]] in 1359 and 1360, and defeated the final attempt by the Yuan to dominate Goryeo when General [[Choe Yeong]] defeated an invading Mongol [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]] in 1364. During the 1380s, Goryeo turned its attention to the [[Wokou]] menace and used [[Naval history of Korea|naval artillery]] created by [[Choe Museon]] to annihilate hundreds of pirate ships.\n\n====Fall====\nIn 1388, [[U of Goryeo|King U]] (son of [[Gongmin of Goryeo|King Gongmin]] and a concubine) and general [[Choe Yeong]] planned a campaign to invade present-day [[Liaoning]] of China. King U put the general [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]] (later [[Taejo of Joseon|Taejo]]) in charge, but he stopped at the border and rebelled.\n\nGoryeo fell to General [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]], a son of [[Yi Ja-chun]], who put to death the last three Goryeo kings, usurped the throne and established in 1392 the [[Joseon]] dynasty.\n\n==Foreign relations==\nGoryeo affiliated itself with the successive short-lived [[Five Dynasties]] beginning with the [[Shatuo]] [[Later Tang]] dynasty in 933, and [[Taejo of Goryeo|Taejo]] was acknowledged as the legitimate successor to [[Dongmyeong of Goguryeo]].{{sfn|Em|2013|p=25}}{{sfn|Rossabi|1983|p=154}} In 962, Goryeo entered relations with the nascent [[Song dynasty]].{{sfn|Rossabi|1983|p=154}} Song did not have real suzerainty over Goryeo, and Goryeo sent \"tribute\" mainly for the sake of trade.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hsu |first1=Cho-yun |title=China: A New Cultural History |date=2012 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=9780231528184 |pages=266\u2013267 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2_GQpLPPl8C&pg=PA266#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=12 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref> Later, Goryeo entered nominal tributary relations with the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao dynasty]] then the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] while maintaining trade and unofficial relations with the Song dynasty.

The Liao invasions of Kory\u014f from 993 to 1020 were successfully repelled by the Koreans. The Chin made no serious attempts against Kory\u014f. The dynastic historians accepted nevertheless the official fiction and referred to Kory\u014f by an unrealistic terminology.{{sfn|Bielenstein|2005|p=182}}<br /><br />To repeat, Kory\u014f was not a vassal with tributary duties to the Five Dynasties, Sung, Liao, and Chin. In spite of its smaller size, it was able to stand up to Liao and Chin, and did not have to buy peace. This required clever diplomacy and a minimum of appeasement. In spite of window-dressing, rhetorics, and even a pinch of nostalgia for the good old times of Korean-Chinese friendship, Kory\u014f succeeded in keeping its autonomy until the advent of the Mongols.{{sfn|Bielenstein|2005|p=184}}|author=Hans Bielenstein|source=''Diplomacy and Trade in the Chinese World, 589-1276'' (2005)}} \n\n==Economy==\n<!--===Agriculture===\n===Coinage===\n===Manufactures===\n===Land systems===\n===Taxation===-->\n\n===Commerce===\nIn the Goryeo dynasty, trade was frequent.

Like most other early Goryeo monks, he began his studies in Buddhism with the Hwaeom school. He later traveled to China, and upon his return, actively promulgated the ''[[Cheontae]]'' (\u5929\u53f0\u5b97, or ''[[Tiantai]]'' in Chinese) teachings, which became recognized as another Seon school. This period thus came to be described as \"five doctrinal and two meditational schools\" (''ogyo yangjong''). Uicheon himself, however, alienated too many Seon adherents, and he died at a relatively young age without seeing a Seon-Gyo unity accomplished.\n[[File:Goryeo Seobun.jpg|160px|thumb|Gwangyeongseopum Byeonsangdo, Goryeo buddhist painting.]]\nThe most important figure of Seon in the Goryeo was ''[[Jinul]]'' (\u77e5\u8a25; 1158\u20131210). In his time, the sangha was in a crisis of external appearance and internal issues of doctrine. Buddhism had gradually become infected by secular tendencies and involvements, such as fortune-telling and the offering of prayers and rituals for success in secular endeavors. This kind of corruption resulted in the profusion of increasingly larger numbers of monks and nuns with questionable motivations. Therefore, the correction, revival, and improvement of the quality of Buddhism were prominent issues for Buddhist leaders of the period.\n\nJinul sought to establish a new movement within Korean Seon, which he called the ''\"[[sam\u0101dhi]] and [[praj\u00f1a|praj\u00f1\u0101]] society\"'',<ref name=\"Alexander\">Alexander Wynee, \u300aBuddhism: An Introduction\u300b, I.B. Tauris, 2015. {{ISBN|1848853971}} p.236</ref> whose goal was to establish a new community of disciplined, pure-minded practitioners deep in the mountains.<ref name=\"Keel\" /> He eventually accomplished this mission with the founding of the Seonggwangsa monastery at Mt. Jogye (\u66f9\u6eaa\u5c71).<ref name=\"Keel\" /> Jinul's works are characterized by a thorough analysis and reformulation of the methodologies of Seon study and practice. One major issue that had long fermented in Chinese ''[[Zen|Seon]]'', and which received special focus from Jinul, was the relationship between \"gradual\" and \"sudden\" methods in practice and enlightenment. Drawing upon various Chinese treatments of this topic, most importantly those by '''[[Zongmi]]''' (780-841) and '''Dahui''' (\u5927\u6167; 1089\u20131163),<ref>Damien Keown, Charles S.Prebish, \u300aEncyclopedia of Buddhism\u300b, Routledge, 2013. {{ISBN|1136985883}} p.226</ref> Jinul created a  \"sudden enlightenment followed by gradual practice\" dictum, which he outlined in a few relatively concise and accessible texts.<ref>Steven Heine, \u300aLike Cats and Dogs:Contesting the Mu Koan in Zen Buddhism\u300b, OUP USA, 2013. {{ISBN|0199837309}} p.82</ref> From Dahui, Jinul also incorporated the ''gwanhwa'' (\u89c0\u8a71) method into his practice.<ref name=\"Alexander\" /> This form of meditation is the main method taught in Korean Seon today. Jinul's philosophical resolution of the Seon-Gyo conflict brought a deep and lasting effect on Korean Buddhism.\n\n[[File:Goryeo-Illustrated manuscript of the Lotus Sutra c.1340 (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright=2|Illustrated manuscript of the [[Lotus Sutra]], {{circa}} 1340]]\nThe general trend of Buddhism in the latter half of the Goryeo was a decline due to corruption, and the rise of strong anti-Buddhist political and philosophical sentiment.<ref>Sonja Vegdahl, Ben Hur, \u300aCultureShock! Korea: A Survival Guide to Customs and Etiquette\u300b, Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd, 2008. {{ISBN|9814408948}} p.9</ref> However, this period of relative decadence would nevertheless produce some of Korea's most renowned Seon masters. Three important monks of this period who figured prominently in charting the future course of Korean Seon were contemporaries and friends: '''Gyeonghan Baeg'un''' (\u666f\u9591\u767d\u96f2; 1298\u20131374), '''Taego Bou''' (\u592a\u53e4\u666e\u611a; 1301\u20131382) and '''Naong Hyegeun''' (\u61f6\u7fc1\u6167\u52e4; 1320\u20131376). All three went to [[Yuan China]] to learn the ''[[Linji school|Linji]]'' (\u81e8\u6fdf or ''[[Imje]]'' in [[Korean language|Korean]]) ''gwanhwa'' teaching that had been popularized by Jinul. All three returned, and established the sharp, confrontational methods of the Imje school in their own teaching. Each of the three was also said to have had hundreds of disciples, such that this new infusion into Korean Seon brought about considerable effect. Despite the Imje influence, which was generally considered to be anti-scholarly in nature, Gyeonghan and Naong, under the influence of Jinul and the traditional ''[[tong bulgyo]]'' tendency, showed an unusual interest in scriptural study, as well as a strong understanding of ''[[Confucianism]]'' and ''[[Taoism]]'', due to the increasing influence of Chinese philosophy as the foundation of official education. From this time, a marked tendency for Korean Buddhist monks to be \"three teachings\" exponents appeared.\n\nA significant historical event of the Goryeo period is the production of the first woodblock edition of the [[Tripitaka]], called the [[Tripitaka Koreana]]. Two editions were made, the first one completed from 1210 to 1231, and the second one from 1214 to 1259. The first edition was destroyed in a fire, during an attack by [[Mongol]] invaders in 1232, but the second edition is still in existence at [[Haeinsa]] in [[Gyeongsang]] province. This edition of the Tripitaka was of high quality, and served as the standard version of the Tripitaka in East Asia for almost 700 years.<ref name=\"Sakya2\">Madhusudan Sakya, \u3008Current Perspectives in Buddhism: Buddhism today / issues&global dimensions\u3009, Cyber Tech Publications, 2011. {{ISBN|8178847337}}. p.111</ref>\n\n====Confucianism====\n{{Main|Korean Confucianism}}\n[[Gwangjong of Goryeo|Emperor Gwangjong]] creating the [[Gwageo|national civil service examinations]].<ref name=\"Djun2\">{{harvnb|Kim|2014}}, p. 64.</ref> and [[Seongjong of Goryeo|King Seongjong]] was a key figure in establishing Confucianism.

The second version was made in 1251 by [[Gojong of Goryeo|Gojong]] in an attempt invoke the power of Buddhism to fend off the Mongol invasion. The wooden blocks are kept clean by leaving them to dry outside every year.\n\n===Art===\n{{see also|List of Goryeo Buddhist paintings}}\n\n====Goryeo celadon====\n{{Main|Korean pottery and porcelain}}\n[[File:Korea - Seoul - National Museum - Incense Burner 0252-06a.jpg|thumb|upright|Celadon incense burner. [[National Treasures of South Korea]].]]\n[[File:Ewer with Cover, first half of the 12th century, 56.138.1a-b.jpg|thumbnail|left|Ewer with Cover, first half of the 12th century. Stoneware with underglaze slip decoration and celadon glaze. [[Celadon]] ceramics of the Goryeo dynasty (918\u20131392) are among the most celebrated works of Korean art. Their luminous green color is the result of iron in both the clay and the glaze oxidizing in a reduction kiln. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nThe ceramics of Goryeo are considered by some to be the finest small-scale works of ceramics in Korean history.\nKey-fret, foliate designs, geometric or scrolling flowerhead bands, elliptical panels, stylized fish and insects, and the use of incised designs began at this time. Glazes were usually various shades of celadon, with browned glazes to almost black glazes being used for stoneware and storage. Celadon glazes could be rendered almost transparent to show black and white inlays.\n\nWhile the forms generally seen are broad-shouldered bottles, larger low bowls or shallow smaller bowls, highly decorated celadon cosmetic boxes, and small slip-inlaid cups, the Buddhist potteries also produced melon-shaped vases, chrysanthemum cups often of spectacularly architectural design on stands with lotus motifs and lotus flower heads. In-curving rimmed alms bowls have also been discovered similar to Korean metalware. Wine cups often had a tall foot which rested on dish-shaped stands.\n\n====Lacquerware with mother of pearl inlay====\nDuring the Goryeo period, lacquerware with mother-of-pearl inlay reached a high point of technical and aesthetic achievement and was widely used by members of the aristocracy for Buddhist ritual implements and vessels, as well as horse saddles and royal carriages. Inlaid lacquers combine texture, color, and shape to produce a dazzling effect in both large and small objects. Although Korean lacquerware of the Goryeo period was highly prized throughout East Asia, fewer than fifteen examples are known to have survived, one of which is this exquisite box in the Museum's collection. This paucity of material is largely attributable to the fragility of lacquer objects and, to a certain extent, to wars and raids by foreign powers, notably those launched from Japan by Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536\u20131598) in the late sixteenth century.\n[[File:Cosmetic box, stoneware with celadon glaze, Goryeo Dynasty.jpg|thumb|upright|A Korean stoneware cosmetic box with white and black inlay and a [[celadon]] glaze, from the Goryeo Dynasty, dated c. 1150\u20131250]]\n[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/25.215.41a,b More info on Goryeo lacquerware]\n\n====Construction techniques====\nThese ceramics are of a hard porcellaneous body with porcelain stone as one of the key ingredients; however, it is not to be confused with porcelain. The body is low clay, quartz rich, high potassia and virtually identical in composition to the Chinese Yueh ceramics which scholars hypothesize occasioned the first production of celadon in Korea. The glaze is an ash glaze with iron colourant, fired in a reduction atmosphere in a modified Chinese-style 'dragon' kiln. The distinctive blue-grey-green of Korean celadon is caused by the iron content of the glaze with a minimum of titanium contaminant, which modifies the color to a greener cast, as can be seen in Chinese Yueh wares. However, the Goryeo potters took the glaze in a different direction than their Chinese forebears; instead of relying solely on underglaze incised designs, they eventually developed the ''sanggam'' technique of inlaying black (magnetite) and white (quartz) which created bold contrast with the glaze. Scholars also theorize that this developed in part to an inlay tradition in Korean metalworks and lacquer, and also to the dissatisfaction with the nearly invisible effect of incising when done under a thick celadon glaze.<ref>Wood, Nigel. \"Technological Parallels between Chinese Yue wares and Korean celadons.\" in Papers of the British Association for Korean Studies (BAKS Papers), vol 5.

Technology in Korea took a big step in Goryeo and strong relation with the [[Song dynasty]] contributed to this. In the dynasty, Korean ceramics and paper, which come down to now, started to be manufactured.\n\nDuring the late Goryeo Dynasty, Goryeo was at the cutting edge of shipboard artillery. In 1356 early experiments were carried out with gunpowder weapons that shot wood or metal projectiles. In 1373 experiments with incendiary arrows and \"fire tubes\" possibly an early form of the [[Hwacha]] were developed and placed on Korean warships. The policy of placing cannons and other gunpowder weapons continued well into the [[Joseon]] dynasty and by 1410, over 160 Joseon warships had cannons on board.

In 1964 she moved to [[Germany]] to study with Ursula Lendrot at the [[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Theater M\u00fcnchen|Hochschule f\u00fcr Music]] in [[Munich]], and in 1966 she was admitted as a national student to the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Conservatoire National Sup\u00e9rieur]] in [[Paris]] where she studied until 1968 with [[G\u00e9rard Devos]]. She was then admitted to the [[Royal Danish Academy of Music]] finalizing her studies in 1979 with Inga Graae and making Copenhagen her residency.\n\n== Career ==\nFrom 1974 Ms. Claro gives concerts regularly across [[Scandinavia]], Europe and Latin America as soloist with orchestra, in solo recitals, [[chamber music]] and in \"Duo Claro\" with Danish flutist [[Lars Graugaard]]. She performs the classical repertoire as well as contemporary music and she regularly holds [[master classes]] in connection with her concerts.

It was released on 16 January 1989 on [[Virgin Records]]. Despite including the US Adult Contemporary Chart hit \"Everything But My Pride\", it met with little commercial or critical success.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1986, Cutting Crew had had a number-one US hit \"[[(I Just) Died in Your Arms]]\", the top 10 hit \"[[I've Been in Love Before (song)|I've Been in Love Before]]\", and another Top 40 song, \"One for the Mockingbird\". All three were released to varying levels of chart success in their native UK and across much of Europe. However, their debut album, ''[[Broadcast (Cutting Crew album)|Broadcast]],'' was less successful, failing to reach the top 10 in the US and the top 40 in the UK. Executives of Virgin Records were keen on the band delivering a follow-up album that both was popular on its own and had multiple radio-friendly singles lined up.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIt was recorded mostly at Curtis Schwartz' Studio in Sussex, England, in 1988, the second-ever album ever to be recorded at the studio<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/label/368398-Curtis-Schwartz-Studio|title=Curtis Schwartz Studio|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>. It was set to be released the same year, but its release was delayed by a year due to seemingly managerial disputes, and it was finally released in early 1989.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707072650/http://cherryred.co.uk/cherrypop/product.php?display=cuttingcrew|title=Cherry Pop Records : Cutting Crew|date=2010-07-07|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Songs ==\nWhen asked during a December 2008 interview about his favorite track by Cutting Crew, vocalist [[Nick Van Eede]] spoke fondly of the album's title track, stating, \n\n\"'''The Scattering''.' I think it's one of my best lyrics, telling of how the small villages in rural communities can die out when the life blood youth move away to the big cities. We had a lot of fun recording it as we flew down from Scotland with The Whistle Binkies who were a fabulous and famous folk band. We had 5 hours to record all their parts which included Bodhran, fiddle, pipes and accordion. This is still a firm favourite when we play live, even without the folk band!\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/nick-van-eede-from-cutting-crew|title=Nick Van Eede from Cutting Crew : Songwriter Interviews|last=Songfacts|website=www.songfacts.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn a different interview, Van Eede talked about his frustrations with the continuous delaying of the album before its release, stating the song \"(Between A) Rock and a Hard Place\" had lyrics pertaining to the scenario. \n\n\u201cWe wrote one slightly veiled song having a pop at US A&R antics in our 'Between a Rock and Hard Place' from ''The Scattering'' album. I sang, 'I got a brick but I can\u2019t find a window,' as they continually blocked our albums release for months making us lose so much momentum.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unmask.us/songwriters-c-e/cutting-crew/|title=Cutting Crew Song Meanings - Interview with Nick|last=Van Eede|first=|date=|website=Unmask Us|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Critical reception ==\nMichael Sutton of [[AllMusic]] wrote of the album, \"...while ''The Scattering'' doesn't have ear candy like the band's hit singles, the music is less-blatantly commercial and more personal. It's still slick stuff -- big '80s synthesizers, glossy FM radio guitars, in-your-face drums -- but Nick Van Eede's vocals have a frosty glow that creates a mood and sustains interest.\" He ended his reviewsaying, \"''The Scattering'' will probably seem dated to anyone who isn't an '80s enthusiast, but it's tasty nostalgia for people who remember the decade fondly. Cutting Crew were obviously infatuated with the arena-sized riffs of [[U2]] and [[Big Country]], and while the group doesn't reach those bands' creative heights, hook-packed material such as 'Everything but My Pride' and 'Tip of Your Tongue' finds them walking tall.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-scattering-mw0000199452|title=The Scattering - Cutting Crew {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==Chart performance==\n''The Scattering'' peaked at number 150 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Its singles also failed to make much impact, although \"Everything But My Pride\" reached number four on the AOR charts. The late release of the album is often blamed as the primary reason for the band's stalling momentum and popularity;{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} dissuaded by the commercial under-performance of the album and its singles, bassist Colin Farley and drummer [[Frosty Beedle|Martin Beedle]] left the band.  \n\nNick Van Eede and fellow guitarist and bandmate [[Kevin MacMichael]] continued, delivering one final Cutting Crew effort in October 1992, ''Compus Mentus''.

It was released on 16 January 1989 on [[Virgin Records]]. Despite including the US Adult Contemporary Chart hit \"Everything But My Pride\", it met with little commercial or critical success.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1986, Cutting Crew had had a number-one US hit \"[[(I Just) Died in Your Arms]]\", the top 10 hit \"[[I've Been in Love Before (song)|I've Been in Love Before]]\", and another Top 40 song, \"One for the Mockingbird\". All three were released to varying levels of chart success in their native UK and across much of Europe. However, their debut album, ''[[Broadcast (Cutting Crew album)|Broadcast]],'' was less successful, failing to reach the top 10 in the US and the top 40 in the UK. Executives of Virgin Records were keen on the band delivering a follow-up album that both was popular on its own and had multiple radio-friendly singles lined up.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIt was recorded mostly at Curtis Schwartz' Studio in Sussex, England, in 1988, the second-ever album ever to be recorded at the studio<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/label/368398-Curtis-Schwartz-Studio|title=Curtis Schwartz Studio|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>. It was set to be released the same year, but its release was delayed by a year due to seemingly managerial disputes, and it was finally released in early 1989.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707072650/http://cherryred.co.uk/cherrypop/product.php?display=cuttingcrew|title=Cherry Pop Records : Cutting Crew|date=2010-07-07|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Songs ==\nWhen asked during a December 2008 interview about his favorite track by Cutting Crew, vocalist [[Nick Van Eede]] spoke fondly of the album's title track, stating, \n\n\"'''The Scattering''.' I think it's one of my best lyrics, telling of how the small villages in rural communities can die out when the life blood youth move away to the big cities. We had a lot of fun recording it as we flew down from Scotland with The Whistle Binkies who were a fabulous and famous folk band. We had 5 hours to record all their parts which included Bodhran, fiddle, pipes and accordion. This is still a firm favourite when we play live, even without the folk band!\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/nick-van-eede-from-cutting-crew|title=Nick Van Eede from Cutting Crew : Songwriter Interviews|last=Songfacts|website=www.songfacts.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn a different interview, Van Eede talked about his frustrations with the continuous delaying of the album before its release, stating the song \"(Between A) Rock and a Hard Place\" had lyrics pertaining to the scenario. \n\n\u201cWe wrote one slightly veiled song having a pop at US A&R antics in our 'Between a Rock and Hard Place' from ''The Scattering'' album. I sang, 'I got a brick but I can\u2019t find a window,' as they continually blocked our albums release for months making us lose so much momentum.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unmask.us/songwriters-c-e/cutting-crew/|title=Cutting Crew Song Meanings - Interview with Nick|last=Van Eede|first=|date=|website=Unmask Us|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Critical reception ==\nMichael Sutton of [[AllMusic]] wrote of the album, \"...while ''The Scattering'' doesn't have ear candy like the band's hit singles, the music is less-blatantly commercial and more personal. It's still slick stuff -- big '80s synthesizers, glossy FM radio guitars, in-your-face drums -- but Nick Van Eede's vocals have a frosty glow that creates a mood and sustains interest.\" He ended his reviewsaying, \"''The Scattering'' will probably seem dated to anyone who isn't an '80s enthusiast, but it's tasty nostalgia for people who remember the decade fondly. Cutting Crew were obviously infatuated with the arena-sized riffs of [[U2]] and [[Big Country]], and while the group doesn't reach those bands' creative heights, hook-packed material such as 'Everything but My Pride' and 'Tip of Your Tongue' finds them walking tall.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-scattering-mw0000199452|title=The Scattering - Cutting Crew {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==Chart performance==\n''The Scattering'' peaked at number 150 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Its singles also failed to make much impact, although \"Everything But My Pride\" reached number four on the AOR charts. The late release of the album is often blamed as the primary reason for the band's stalling momentum and popularity;{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} dissuaded by the commercial under-performance of the album and its singles, bassist Colin Farley and drummer [[Frosty Beedle|Martin Beedle]] left the band.  \n\nNick Van Eede and fellow guitarist and bandmate [[Kevin MacMichael]] continued, delivering one final Cutting Crew effort in October 1992, ''Compus Mentus''. The album failed to chart, and Cutting Crew disbanded in 1993.\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing = Nick van Eede and Kevin MacMichael, except where noted\n| title1 = Year in the Wilderness\n| writer1 = {{hlist|van Eede|MacMichael|Tony Moore}}\n| length1 = 4:44\n| title2 = The Scattering\n| length2 = 5:01\n| title3 = Big Noise\n| length3 = 4:00\n| title4 = Everything But My Pride\n| length4 = 5:10\n| title5 = Handcuffs for Houdini\n| writer5 = MacMichael\n| length5 = 3:43\n| title6 = (Between A) Rock and a Hard Place\n| length6 = 4:17\n| title7 = Tip of Your Tongue\n| writer7 = {{hlist|van Eede|MacMichael|Martin Beedle}}\n| length7 = 3:36\n| title8 = Reach for the Sky\n| writer8 = {{hlist|van Eede|MacMichael|Colin Farley}}\n| length8 = 5:04\n| title9 = The Last Thing\n| length9 = 3:57\n| title10 = Feel the Wedge\n| writer10 = Farley\n| length10 = 5:35\n| title11 = Binkies Return (Instrumental)\n| length11 = 1:31\n| title12 = Brag\n| writer12 = van Eede\n| length12 = 6:05\n| total_length = 52:00\n}}\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n=== Cutting Crew ===\n\n* [[Nick Van Eede]] - lead vocals\n* [[Kevin MacMichael|Kevin Scott MacMichael]] - lead guitar, backing vocals\n* Colin Farley - bass guitar, backing vocals\n* [[Frosty Beedle|Martin Beetle]] - drums, percussion, backing vocals\n\n==== Additional Personnel ====\n\n* Jackie Rawe - additional vocals (Tracks 4 and 10)\n* Chyna and Marcia Johnson - additional vocals (Track 3)\n* Charles Bowyer - additional vocals (Track 3)\n* The Strawberry Chorale - additional vocals (Track 5)\n* Danny Cummings - percussion (Track 8)\n* Ronnie Aspery - saxophone (Track 9)\n* Eddie McGuire - flute (Track 2)\n* Mark Hayward - fiddle (Track 2)\n* Rab Wallace - pipes (Track 2)\n* Stuart Cydmann - [[squeezebox]] (Track 2)\n* Mick Broderick - [[Bodhr\u00e1n|bodhran]] (Track 2)\n\n==== Production ====\n\n* Produced by Cutting Crew, Peter-John Vettese, and Don Gehman (Track 4)\n* Engineered by Curtis Schwartz\n* Mixed by Hugh Padgham\n\n== Charts ==\n\n=== Album===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

[[Turkey|Turkish]] [[Association football|football]] coach and former player who is currently the manager of [[\u0130stanbulspor]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Turkey===\nTekke was born in the small town of [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcba\u015f\u0131, Trabzon|K\u00f6pr\u00fcba\u015f\u0131]], in the province of [[Trabzon Province|Trabzon]]. He joined [[Trabzonspor]], the major team in the area. Tekke was still in his teens when he started to appear in the first team. In 45 matches that he played between 1994\u20131997, he scored 6 goals. At the beginning of the 1997\u20131998 season he was loaned out to [[Altay SK]] of [[\u0130zmir]], where he scored 8 goals in 24 matches. In a 4\u20135 defeat to [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]], he scored a hat-trick. However a few weeks later he broke his leg and was out of the game for six months. Upon his return to Trabzonspor, Tekke played another 38 matches and scored 6 goals before he transferred to [[Gaziantepspor]] in the summer of 2000. In this period he made his first appearance for the [[Turkish national football team|Turkish national team]].\n\nIn 2002, Tekke returned to Trabzonspor and was given the captaincy. This was the time Tekke reached the peak of his career. In the 2004\u201305 season he managed to become the league's top goal scorer with 31 goals, 7 goals ahead of the second placed player and was second for the [[Golden Foot]]. During his spell with Trabzonspor, he won two medals for winning the [[Turkish Cup]] in consecutive seasons.\n\n===Russia===\nIn July 2006, he signed for [[FC Zenit St. Petersburg|Zenit St. Petersburg]]. On 6 August 2006, Tekke scored on his debut for the club, as he came off the bench against [[FC Shinnik Yaroslavl|Shinnik Yaroslavl]] and scored the only goal of the game for his team to win 1\u20130. Tekke scored the winning goal in the [[UEFA Cup]] group stage in a 3\u20132 victory over [[Athlitiki Enosi Larissa F.C.|AE Larissa]]. He assisted the second in the [[2008 UEFA Cup Final]] win over [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. On 21 October 2008, Tekke scored in the 1\u20131 draw with [[FC BATE Borisov|BATE Borisov]] in the Champions League. On 3 February 2010, Tekke signed a 3-year contract with [[FC Rubin Kazan]]. He only played five games before he decided to return to Turkey, transferring to [[Be\u015fikta\u015f]].\n\n===Back to Turkey===\nOn 1 September 2010, Tekke signed a 2-year contract with [[Besiktas JK]]. However, he was only able to play a total of two games before he was sent to [[Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc]], in the 2010\u20132011 transfer window. In the five matches he played for Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc, he scored three goals.

R. Martin]], and its television adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.\n\nIntroduced in 1996's ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'', Sandor is the estranged younger brother of Ser [[Gregor Clegane]], from the fictional Seven Kingdoms of [[Westeros]]. Sandor serves as King [[Joffrey Baratheon]]'s personal bodyguard. He subsequently appeared in Martin's ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'' (1998), ''[[A Storm of Swords]]'' (2000), and ''[[A Feast for Crows]]'' (2005). Like his brother, Sandor is regarded as one of the fiercest and strongest fighters in the Seven Kingdoms. His face is marked by gruesome facial burns he received when his brother shoved his face into a brazier as children; ever since he has retained a crippling fear of fire. While initially appearing brutal and fatalistic, he later proves to be more sympathetic and compassionate, particularly through his relationships with [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Arya Stark]].\n\nSandor is portrayed by Scottish actor [[Rory McCann]] in the [[HBO]] television adaptation.<ref name=HBOCast>{{cite web|title=HBO: Game of Thrones: Sandor Clegane (\"The Hound\"): Bio|url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/sandor-clegane/index.html|website=HBO|accessdate=27 December 2015|ref=HBOCast}}</ref>\n\n== Character description ==\nSandor Clegane, known as The Hound, was the younger brother of [[Gregor Clegane]], and was a retainer to [[House Lannister]]. He was regarded as one of the most dangerous and skilled fighters in [[Westeros]]. His size (in the novels he is 6'8\", or 2 m and over 300&nbsp;lbs, or 140&nbsp;kg) and strength make him an imposing figure, though he is not quite as large as his brother Gregor.  His face was distinguished by gruesome burn scars, which he received as a child when his brother pushed his head into a [[brazier]].  Consequently, Clegane feared fire and hated his brother. He was also scornful of knight's vows, as his brother was a knight who nonetheless is a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadist]] indulged in rape and murder.  Clegane was described as a tormented man driven by anger and hate, aspiring only to kill his brother.\n\n== Storylines ==\n=== Novels ===\n[[File:A Song of Ice and Fire arms of House Clegane supporters.png|thumb|150px|alt=A coat of arms showing three black dogs on a field of yellow.|Coat of arms of House Clegane]]\nSandor Clegane is not a [[Narration#Third-person|point of view]] character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed mainly through the eyes of [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Arya Stark]], with some narrations from other characters such as [[Ned Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/map/special/areas-of-control/4/|title=Game of Thrones Viewer's Guide |website=HBO}}</ref>\n\n====''A Game of Thrones'' and ''A Clash of Kings''====\n{{main|A Game of Thrones|A Clash of Kings}}\nIn ''A Game of Thrones'', he acts as bodyguard and servant to [[Joffrey Baratheon|Crown Prince Joffrey Baratheon]], who calls him \"Dog\" but is somewhat attached to him, as Joffrey lacks a [[father figure]] from [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert]].  While escorting Sansa home, he reveals to her how his face was scarred and expresses much resentment of his brutish older brother and towards the concept of knighthood in general. Clegane hunts down Arya Stark's friend Mycah, and leads the Lannister attack on [[Eddard Stark]]'s men in the Tower of the Hand during the purge of the Starks.\n\nSandor is named Joffrey's Kingsguard towards the end of ''A Game of Thrones'', but always refuses to become a Knight.  Clegane is often assigned to guard Sansa, trying to protect her from Joffrey's abuse in ''A Clash of Kings'', and advises Sansa to do whatever Joffrey tells her to do as the best way of staying alive.  He becomes disillusion during the Battle of the Blackwater and abandons his duty as Joffrey's guard due to the widespread use of wildfire (a fictional incendiary substance inspired by [[Greek fire]]).  He secretly goes to see Sansa and offers to escape King's Landing with her, and gets unpredictable when she refuses. He threatens her then calms down after she sings him a song about mercy, before fleeing the capital on his own.\n\n====''A Storm of Swords''====\n{{main|A Storm of Swords}}\nIn ''A Storm of Swords'', the lordless Sandor gets drunk and is captured by the Brotherhood Without Banners, who sentences him to a [[trial by combat]] on charge of murder accused by Arya.  Sandor prevails against the Brotherhood leader [[Beric Dondarrion]] and is set free.  He later kidnaps Arya and hopes to ransom her to her brother [[Robb Stark]] at Riverrun in order to earn a place in Robb's service.  He takes her to [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#The Twins|the Twins]], where Robb is attending a wedding.  However, just as they arrive, the Red Wedding happens and [[House Frey|the Freys]] begin slaughtering [[House Stark|the Starks]].  Sandor knocks Arya unconscious to prevent her from running into the castle, and fights his out killing three Frey knights.  They later encounter three of Gregor's men \u2014 Polliver, Tickler and a pimply squire from House Sarsfield \u2014 at the Crossroad Inn.  Sandor is provoked while drunken and kills Polliver in the ensuing fight, but gets seriously injured.  He becomes critically ill when his wounds begin to fester, so Arya abandons him under a tree to await his apparent death.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tor.com/2013/10/17/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-48/ |title=A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 48 |work=Tor.com}}</ref>\n\n====''A Feast for Crows''====\n{{main|A Feast for Crows}}\nHe is mentioned a few times in ''[[A Feast for Crows]]'' (2005), where the Elder Brother mentions to Brienne of Tarth that he found Sandor, who is now \"at rest\". However, the appearance of a mute gravedigger who matches Sandor physically and the Elder Brother's refusal to confirm if Sandor is dead imply that he may still be alive.\n\n===TV adaptation===\nScottish actor [[Rory McCann]]<ref name=HBOCast/> has received acclaim for his portrayal<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/game-of-thrones-q-a-rory-mccann-on-the-hound-and-season-four-20140407|title=Sandor Clegane: 'Game of Thrones' actor talks |journal=Rolling Stone |first=Sean T. |last=Collins |date=7 April 2014}}</ref> of Sandor Clegane in the television adaptation of the series of books.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/tv/game-of-thrones-meet-the-hound-scottish-actor-rory-mccann/#/0 |title='Game of Thrones': The Hound |website=Herocomplex |date=25 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Season 1====\nClegane is first introduced in the pilot episode when he accompanies the royal court on Robert Baratheon's visit to Winterfell. On the way back to King's Landing, Joffrey falsely accuses a butcher's boy, Mycah, of having attacked him, and Clegane kills the boy, attracting the hatred of Mycah's friend Arya Stark. During the Tourney of the Hand, Sandor's sadistic elder brother Gregor tries to kill Ser Loras Tyrell after Tyrell has unhorsed him, but Sandor defends Loras from Gregor until Robert orders the men to stop fighting. When Ned Stark accuses Joffrey of being a bastard born of incest and orders his arrest, Clegane assists the Lannister soldiers in the subsequent purge of the Stark household and Sansa Stark's capture, although he later comforts Sansa when Joffrey orders her face slapped and advises how to avoid future pain. With Joffrey's ascension to the throne, Clegane is named to the Kingsguard to replace the ousted Ser Barristan Selmy.\n\n====Season 2====\nSandor Clegane continues to defend Sansa, including by covering her after Joffrey orders her stripped in front of the assembled court and rescuing her from being gang-raped during the King's Landing riots. He participates in the Battle of the Blackwater against Stannis Baratheon's forces but is visibly horrified when Tyrion Lannister uses wildfire to incinerate much of Stannis' fleet; he ultimately deserts after witnessing a man burning alive in the battle. Before he leaves King's Landing, he offers to take Sansa north to Winterfell, which she refuses. It is during this season that Sandor Clegane admits to Sansa that he loves killing, saying that there is nothing more pleasing than bringing death upon others.\n\n====Season 3====\n[[File:Game of Thrones Oslo exhibition 2014 - Arya's and the Hound's costumes.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=The costumes worn by Arya and her companion Sandor Clegane|The costumes worn by [[Arya Stark|Arya]] and her companion Sandor Clegane in the TV series Game of Thrones.]]\nIn the Riverlands, Clegane is arrested by the Brotherhood Without Banners, a group of knights and soldiers sent by Eddard Stark to kill Gregor and restore order to the Riverlands. While being transported to their stronghold, he meets other members of the Brotherhood who are traveling with Arya Stark and tells them her true identity. At the Brotherhood's hideout, their leader Lord Beric Dondarrion accuses Clegane of being a murderer; although Clegane asserts that the murders were committed in order to protect Joffrey, Arya testifies that Clegane had killed Mycah despite the boy's not having harmed Joffrey. Lord Beric sentences Clegane to a trial by combat, which Clegane wins to secure his freedom. Although Clegane slays him, Lord Beric is immediately resurrected by the Red Priest Thoros of Myr. Clegane later captures Arya, intending to ransom her to King Robb Stark at the wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey at The Twins. However, as they arrive at the Twins, the Freys turn on and attack the Starks, and Clegane and Arya barely escape the massacre.\n\n====Season 4====\nWith the rest of House Stark believed dead and the Riverlands now under the rule of House Frey, Clegane decides to ransom Arya to her aunt Lysa Arryn in the Vale. During their journey, Arya reveals to Clegane that she has not forgiven him for killing Mycah and has vowed to kill him. The duo arrive in the Vale to find that Lysa has ostensibly committed suicide. Returning from the Bloody Gate, they encounter the sworn sword to Arya's mother Catelyn, Brienne of Tarth, who had promised to take the Stark children to safety. When Arya refuses to go with Brienne, Brienne and Clegane engage in a brawl that culminates in Brienne's throwing Clegane off a cliff, gravely wounding him. Although Clegane begs Arya to kill him, she leaves him to die.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://winteriscoming.net/2014/06/23/rory-mccann-hound-brienne-fighting-dirty-teaching-arya-well |title=Rory McCann on The Hound and Brienne fighting dirty, and teaching Arya all too well |website=winteriscoming.net |date=23 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Season 6====\nIt is revealed that Clegane survived; he had been discovered by Ray, a warrior turned septon. Clegane assists Ray and his followers in building a sept, but one day, after a brief journey into nearby woods to chop wood, Clegane returns to the community to find everyone slaughtered by rogue members of the Brotherhood Without Banners. Clegane takes up an ax to hunt down those responsible and kills four of them before discovering the remaining three about to be hanged by Lord Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr, who inform him that the group were acting independently of the Brotherhood. Lord Beric allows Clegane to help hang two of the outlaws, followed by an offer to join the Brotherhood in their journey north to fight the White Walkers.\n\n====Season 7====\nDuring their journey north, the Brotherhood stops at a farm owned by a farmer Clegane had previously robbed. Inside, they find the bodies of the farmer and his daughter. Remorseful, Clegane digs them a grave with Thoros's help. Thoros has Clegane look into the flames of the Brotherhood's campfire, and in them the skeptical Clegane sees the White Walkers and their forces marching towards the Wall.\n\nThe Brotherhood attempts to cross the Wall via Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, but are intercepted by wildling scouts manning the castle and are locked in the ice cells. Soon afterward, [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]], [[Davos Seaworth]], [[Jorah Mormont]], and [[Gendry]] arrive at Eastwatch, intending to capture a wight to present to Cersei (now Queen of the Seven Kingdoms) as evidence the White Walkers exist. Clegane, Beric, and Thoros are released to accompany Jon, Jorah, Gendry, and the wilding [[Tormund Giantsbane]] beyond the Wall. The group soon captures a wight but is surrounded by the White Walkers and their army of wights, although not before Gendry flees to Eastwatch to request [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s aid. Daenerys arrives with her dragons before the group can be overrun. One dragon is killed and reanimated by the Night King, but Daenerys' group, minus Jon - who stays behind to fight back the White Walkers - is able to flee. Clegane joins Jon, Daenerys, and Davos as they sail to King's Landing.\n\nAt King's Landing, Clegane meets Brienne of Tarth. Despite their previous brutal fight, they converse on civil terms. Clegane learns that Arya is alive and with her family, prompting a rare smile. During the summit in the Dragon Pit outside King's Landing, Clegane confronts his brother and asks what they did to him then cuts off the answer and tells him he always knew who would come for him. Clegane brings out the trunk containing the wight, revealing to Cersei and Jaime Lannister the threat that lies beyond the wall. In the aftermath, Clegane sails to White Harbor with Daenerys' forces with the intention of travelling to Winterfell to aid Jon and Daenerys against the Night King.\n\n====Season 8====\nThe Hound joins Daenerys, Jon, and their retinues as they march to Winterfell, where he is reunited with Arya and Sansa. The Hound and Arya make peace with one another before the dreaded Battle of Winterfell against the White Walkers. During the battle, the Hound is triggered by the use of fire to destroy the wights and is close to giving up, but is convinced by Beric to keep fighting, indicating towards Arya who is relentlessly fighting beside them.\n\nThe Hound then travels to King's Landing to kill his brother along with Arya, who intends to kill Cersei. The two infiltrate the Red Keep amongst a crowd of civilians Cersei is using as human shields, but Daenerys begins burning the city down and the Red Keep begins to crumble.

R. Martin]], and its television adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.\n\nIntroduced in 1996's ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'', Sandor is the estranged younger brother of Ser [[Gregor Clegane]], from the fictional Seven Kingdoms of [[Westeros]]. Sandor serves as King [[Joffrey Baratheon]]'s personal bodyguard. He subsequently appeared in Martin's ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'' (1998), ''[[A Storm of Swords]]'' (2000), and ''[[A Feast for Crows]]'' (2005). Like his brother, Sandor is regarded as one of the fiercest and strongest fighters in the Seven Kingdoms. His face is marked by gruesome facial burns he received when his brother shoved his face into a brazier as children; ever since he has retained a crippling fear of fire. While initially appearing brutal and fatalistic, he later proves to be more sympathetic and compassionate, particularly through his relationships with [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Arya Stark]].\n\nSandor is portrayed by Scottish actor [[Rory McCann]] in the [[HBO]] television adaptation.<ref name=HBOCast>{{cite web|title=HBO: Game of Thrones: Sandor Clegane (\"The Hound\"): Bio|url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/sandor-clegane/index.html|website=HBO|accessdate=27 December 2015|ref=HBOCast}}</ref>\n\n== Character description ==\nSandor Clegane, known as The Hound, was the younger brother of [[Gregor Clegane]], and was a retainer to [[House Lannister]]. He was regarded as one of the most dangerous and skilled fighters in [[Westeros]]. His size (in the novels he is 6'8\", or 2 m and over 300&nbsp;lbs, or 140&nbsp;kg) and strength make him an imposing figure, though he is not quite as large as his brother Gregor.  His face was distinguished by gruesome burn scars, which he received as a child when his brother pushed his head into a [[brazier]].  Consequently, Clegane feared fire and hated his brother. He was also scornful of knight's vows, as his brother was a knight who nonetheless is a [[sadist]] indulged in rape and murder.  Clegane was described as a tormented man driven by anger and hate, aspiring only to kill his brother.\n\n== Storylines ==\n=== Novels ===\n[[File:A Song of Ice and Fire arms of House Clegane supporters.png|thumb|150px|alt=A coat of arms showing three black dogs on a field of yellow.|Coat of arms of House Clegane]]\nSandor Clegane is not a [[Narration#Third-person|point of view]] character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed mainly through the eyes of [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Arya Stark]], with some narrations from other characters such as [[Ned Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/map/special/areas-of-control/4/|title=Game of Thrones Viewer's Guide |website=HBO}}</ref>\n\n====''A Game of Thrones'' and ''A Clash of Kings''====\n{{main|A Game of Thrones|A Clash of Kings}}\nIn ''A Game of Thrones'', he acts as bodyguard and servant to [[Joffrey Baratheon|Crown Prince Joffrey Baratheon]], who calls him \"Dog\" but is somewhat attached to him, as Joffrey lacks a [[father figure]] from [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert]].  While escorting Sansa home, he reveals to her how his face was scarred and expresses much resentment of his brutish older brother and towards the concept of knighthood in general. Clegane hunts down Arya Stark's friend Mycah, and leads the Lannister attack on [[Eddard Stark]]'s men in the Tower of the Hand during the purge of the Starks.\n\nSandor is named Joffrey's Kingsguard towards the end of ''A Game of Thrones'', but always refuses to become a Knight.  Clegane is often assigned to guard Sansa, trying to protect her from Joffrey's abuse in ''A Clash of Kings'', and advises Sansa to do whatever Joffrey tells her to do as the best way of staying alive.  He becomes disillusion during the Battle of the Blackwater and abandons his duty as Joffrey's guard due to the widespread use of wildfire (a fictional incendiary substance inspired by [[Greek fire]]).  He secretly goes to see Sansa and offers to escape King's Landing with her, and gets unpredictable when she refuses. He threatens her then calms down after she sings him a song about mercy, before fleeing the capital on his own.\n\n====''A Storm of Swords''====\n{{main|A Storm of Swords}}\nIn ''A Storm of Swords'', the lordless Sandor gets drunk and is captured by the Brotherhood Without Banners, who sentences him to a [[trial by combat]] on charge of murder accused by Arya.  Sandor prevails against the Brotherhood leader [[Beric Dondarrion]] and is set free.  He later kidnaps Arya and hopes to ransom her to her brother [[Robb Stark]] at Riverrun in order to earn a place in Robb's service.  He takes her to [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#The Twins|the Twins]], where Robb is attending a wedding.  However, just as they arrive, the Red Wedding happens and [[House Frey|the Freys]] begin slaughtering [[House Stark|the Starks]].  Sandor knocks Arya unconscious to prevent her from running into the castle, and fights his out killing three Frey knights.  They later encounter three of Gregor's men \u2014 Polliver, Tickler and a pimply squire from House Sarsfield \u2014 at the Crossroad Inn.  Sandor is provoked while drunken and kills Polliver in the ensuing fight, but gets seriously injured.  He becomes critically ill when his wounds begin to fester, so Arya abandons him under a tree to await his apparent death.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tor.com/2013/10/17/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-48/ |title=A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 48 |work=Tor.com}}</ref>\n\n====''A Feast for Crows''====\n{{main|A Feast for Crows}}\nHe is mentioned a few times in ''[[A Feast for Crows]]'' (2005), where the Elder Brother mentions to Brienne of Tarth that he found Sandor, who is now \"at rest\". However, the appearance of a mute gravedigger who matches Sandor physically and the Elder Brother's refusal to confirm if Sandor is dead imply that he may still be alive.\n\n===TV adaptation===\nScottish actor [[Rory McCann]]<ref name=HBOCast/> has received acclaim for his portrayal<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/game-of-thrones-q-a-rory-mccann-on-the-hound-and-season-four-20140407|title=Sandor Clegane: 'Game of Thrones' actor talks |journal=Rolling Stone |first=Sean T. |last=Collins |date=7 April 2014}}</ref> of Sandor Clegane in the television adaptation of the series of books.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/tv/game-of-thrones-meet-the-hound-scottish-actor-rory-mccann/#/0 |title='Game of Thrones': The Hound |website=Herocomplex |date=25 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Season 1====\nClegane is first introduced in the pilot episode when he accompanies the royal court on Robert Baratheon's visit to Winterfell. On the way back to King's Landing, Joffrey falsely accuses a butcher's boy, Mycah, of having attacked him, and Clegane kills the boy, attracting the hatred of Mycah's friend Arya Stark. During the Tourney of the Hand, Sandor's sadistic elder brother Gregor tries to kill Ser Loras Tyrell after Tyrell has unhorsed him, but Sandor defends Loras from Gregor until Robert orders the men to stop fighting. When Ned Stark accuses Joffrey of being a bastard born of incest and orders his arrest, Clegane assists the Lannister soldiers in the subsequent purge of the Stark household and Sansa Stark's capture, although he later comforts Sansa when Joffrey orders her face slapped and advises how to avoid future pain. With Joffrey's ascension to the throne, Clegane is named to the Kingsguard to replace the ousted Ser Barristan Selmy.\n\n====Season 2====\nSandor Clegane continues to defend Sansa, including by covering her after Joffrey orders her stripped in front of the assembled court and rescuing her from being gang-raped during the King's Landing riots. He participates in the Battle of the Blackwater against Stannis Baratheon's forces but is visibly horrified when Tyrion Lannister uses wildfire to incinerate much of Stannis' fleet; he ultimately deserts after witnessing a man burning alive in the battle. Before he leaves King's Landing, he offers to take Sansa north to Winterfell, which she refuses. It is during this season that Sandor Clegane admits to Sansa that he loves killing, saying that there is nothing more pleasing than bringing death upon others.\n\n====Season 3====\n[[File:Game of Thrones Oslo exhibition 2014 - Arya's and the Hound's costumes.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=The costumes worn by Arya and her companion Sandor Clegane|The costumes worn by [[Arya Stark|Arya]] and her companion Sandor Clegane in the TV series Game of Thrones.]]\nIn the Riverlands, Clegane is arrested by the Brotherhood Without Banners, a group of knights and soldiers sent by Eddard Stark to kill Gregor and restore order to the Riverlands. While being transported to their stronghold, he meets other members of the Brotherhood who are traveling with Arya Stark and tells them her true identity. At the Brotherhood's hideout, their leader Lord Beric Dondarrion accuses Clegane of being a murderer; although Clegane asserts that the murders were committed in order to protect Joffrey, Arya testifies that Clegane had killed Mycah despite the boy's not having harmed Joffrey. Lord Beric sentences Clegane to a trial by combat, which Clegane wins to secure his freedom. Although Clegane slays him, Lord Beric is immediately resurrected by the Red Priest Thoros of Myr. Clegane later captures Arya, intending to ransom her to King Robb Stark at the wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey at The Twins. However, as they arrive at the Twins, the Freys turn on and attack the Starks, and Clegane and Arya barely escape the massacre.\n\n====Season 4====\nWith the rest of House Stark believed dead and the Riverlands now under the rule of House Frey, Clegane decides to ransom Arya to her aunt Lysa Arryn in the Vale. During their journey, Arya reveals to Clegane that she has not forgiven him for killing Mycah and has vowed to kill him. The duo arrive in the Vale to find that Lysa has ostensibly committed suicide. Returning from the Bloody Gate, they encounter the sworn sword to Arya's mother Catelyn, Brienne of Tarth, who had promised to take the Stark children to safety. When Arya refuses to go with Brienne, Brienne and Clegane engage in a brawl that culminates in Brienne's throwing Clegane off a cliff, gravely wounding him. Although Clegane begs Arya to kill him, she leaves him to die.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://winteriscoming.net/2014/06/23/rory-mccann-hound-brienne-fighting-dirty-teaching-arya-well |title=Rory McCann on The Hound and Brienne fighting dirty, and teaching Arya all too well |website=winteriscoming.net |date=23 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Season 6====\nIt is revealed that Clegane survived; he had been discovered by Ray, a warrior turned septon. Clegane assists Ray and his followers in building a sept, but one day, after a brief journey into nearby woods to chop wood, Clegane returns to the community to find everyone slaughtered by rogue members of the Brotherhood Without Banners. Clegane takes up an ax to hunt down those responsible and kills four of them before discovering the remaining three about to be hanged by Lord Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr, who inform him that the group were acting independently of the Brotherhood. Lord Beric allows Clegane to help hang two of the outlaws, followed by an offer to join the Brotherhood in their journey north to fight the White Walkers.\n\n====Season 7====\nDuring their journey north, the Brotherhood stops at a farm owned by a farmer Clegane had previously robbed. Inside, they find the bodies of the farmer and his daughter. Remorseful, Clegane digs them a grave with Thoros's help. Thoros has Clegane look into the flames of the Brotherhood's campfire, and in them the skeptical Clegane sees the White Walkers and their forces marching towards the Wall.\n\nThe Brotherhood attempts to cross the Wall via Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, but are intercepted by wildling scouts manning the castle and are locked in the ice cells. Soon afterward, [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]], [[Davos Seaworth]], [[Jorah Mormont]], and [[Gendry]] arrive at Eastwatch, intending to capture a wight to present to Cersei (now Queen of the Seven Kingdoms) as evidence the White Walkers exist. Clegane, Beric, and Thoros are released to accompany Jon, Jorah, Gendry, and the wilding [[Tormund Giantsbane]] beyond the Wall. The group soon captures a wight but is surrounded by the White Walkers and their army of wights, although not before Gendry flees to Eastwatch to request [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s aid. Daenerys arrives with her dragons before the group can be overrun. One dragon is killed and reanimated by the Night King, but Daenerys' group, minus Jon - who stays behind to fight back the White Walkers - is able to flee. Clegane joins Jon, Daenerys, and Davos as they sail to King's Landing.\n\nAt King's Landing, Clegane meets Brienne of Tarth. Despite their previous brutal fight, they converse on civil terms. Clegane learns that Arya is alive and with her family, prompting a rare smile. During the summit in the Dragon Pit outside King's Landing, Clegane confronts his brother and asks what they did to him then cuts off the answer and tells him he always knew who would come for him. Clegane brings out the trunk containing the wight, revealing to Cersei and Jaime Lannister the threat that lies beyond the wall. In the aftermath, Clegane sails to White Harbor with Daenerys' forces with the intention of travelling to Winterfell to aid Jon and Daenerys against the Night King.\n\n====Season 8====\nThe Hound joins Daenerys, Jon, and their retinues as they march to Winterfell, where he is reunited with Arya and Sansa. The Hound and Arya make peace with one another before the dreaded Battle of Winterfell against the White Walkers. During the battle, the Hound is triggered by the use of fire to destroy the wights and is close to giving up, but is convinced by Beric to keep fighting, indicating towards Arya who is relentlessly fighting beside them.\n\nThe Hound then travels to King's Landing to kill his brother along with Arya, who intends to kill Cersei. The two infiltrate the Red Keep amongst a crowd of civilians Cersei is using as human shields, but Daenerys begins burning the city down and the Red Keep begins to crumble. The Hound urges Arya to leave as he goes to find his brother. Arya thanks him, calling him by his true name for the first and only time, and bids him farewell. A fight ensues between the Clegane brothers, and Sandor struggles to even injure his inhuman brother. Gregor is momentarily disarmed after the Hound stabs him through the head, and the Hound tackles him off a stairway into the inferno below, resulting in both of their deaths.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{ASOIAF}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Clegane, Sandor}}\n[[Category:A Song of Ice and Fire characters]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1996]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with disfigurements]]\n[[Category:Fictional bodyguards]]\n[[Category:Fictional child killers]]\n[[Category:Fictional fratricides]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional nobility]]\n[[Category:Fictional revolutionaries]]\n[[Category:Fictional swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Fictional war veterans]]\n[[Category:Burn survivors in fiction]]\n[[Category:Male characters in literature]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional suicides]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toSadist(link changed toSadistic personality disorder) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandor_Clegane"}
