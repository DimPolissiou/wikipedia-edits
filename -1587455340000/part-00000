Brown was the youngest ever Australian Olympic sailing medalist until [[Elise Rechichi]] won gold in 2008. Brown was selected to represent Australia as a competitor in the 1980 Olympic Games for the Flying Dutchman Class.(http://www.mysailing.com.au/olympics/munich-1976-bertrand-takes-bronze-amid-tight-security). He represented Australia as a substitute competitor at the 1984 Olympic Games. He was an Olympic sailing coach at the 1988 Olympic Games for the Star and Flying Dutchman disciplines. Brown was a substitute competitor and coach at the 1992 Olympic Games. He worked with Great Britain (Glenn Charles), New Zealand (Rod Davis), Bermuda (Peter Bromby), Bahamas(Mark Holowesko) and Australian (Colin Beashel), Star Class Olympic representatives on the 1996 Olympic site just prior to Olympic racing (accreditation was with the Bermudan Olympic Sailing during the 1996 racing.) Brown was invited back to take charge of winning medals across all sailing disciplines for Sailing Australia and the National Sporting systems at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.<ref>australiansailingteam.com.au   \"Olympians\"</ref>\n\n\nAs well as his parents Brown credits Bruce Hewish of Freshwater Sails, Hugh Treharne of Blue Peter Sails, and Patrick Mayes, a notable tax law accountant, as adding defining development abilities to himself and career. The later was a financial benefactor enabling Brown to compete successfully in the Etchells class, often beating many of the best sailboat racers in the world such as Dennis Conner, Colin Beashel, David Curtis, John Bertrand, Iain Murray and Peter Gilmore.\n[[File:Ettch112.jpg|thumb|Brown, Andrew York and David Giles won two consecutive NSW Championships then second overall in the third.]]\n\n\nBrown's first title was an Australian Championship win in the Flying Ant Class in 1968 at Perth. He was 5th in interdominion Cherub class in 1969 and a Moth class world junior champion in 1970 before going on to win the World senior Moth Class Championship in 1972/3 at 18 years old. Ian designed, built and raced several \"skiff\" Moth designs. Ian's win was the first ever \"skiff\" moth to win a World Championship in the southern hemisphere, contested at Napier, New Zealand. He backed this up with a second place at Stockholm, Sweden in 1974. In 1975 he  was 2nd in the Australian OK dinghy  championships and later 3rd place in the Okinawa, Japan, Moth Worlds before beginning training in the 470 class with Ian Ruff. Early in 1976, after four months training they won both the Australian title and Olympic 470 selection regattas to secure Ian's first Olympian status. He, with crew and equipment owner Martin Burke, was 5th overall in the 1977 World 505 Class championships, La Rochelle, France. By 1980 he had won selection in the Flying Dutchman discipline for the Olympic Games, after which he began his sailmaking business. He was 4th Overall in the 1982 Flying Dutchman Class World Championships, Geelong, Australia. Later in the 1980s Ian was asked and spent a sailing season racing the 16ft skiff Buckle Toyota achieving a podium placing in the NSW championships at Yarra Bay. He, with crew John Dorling and Barry Watson, were 2nd in the 1993 Etchells Class World Championship, Brisbane, Australia. He raced many other sailboats to State and National titles wins. His most recent National Title wins are in the Farr 40 as tactician 2005, stepping in to skipper four heats with Martin Burke for Ian McCrossin and his team to win a Dragon Class Prince Philip Cup on Sydney Harbour, and two National titles in the SB20 class. By arrangement Ian bought and crewed the SB20, giving the skipper role to Nathan Outteridge. They won the 2011 Nationals, (https://www.sail-world.com/Asia/Australias-Outteridge-looks-the-goods-for-SB3-Worlds/-82529), King of Docklands and Geelong Week SB20 regattas in the year Nathan won a moth worlds. Nathan then went on to win Olympic 49er Gold and Silver medals in the following Olympiads. Interestingly Ian and Nathan put in a rushed SB20 charterboat effort with Tom Slingsby, who boasted his first attempt at being a forwardhand, during the 2011 SB20 World Championships at Torquay UK. For winning the 2013 Nationals Ian went back to skippering: \"The pre-regatta favourite, Brown and his crew of twin brothers Patrick Conway (bow & tactics) and Alex (mainsheet & tactics) and Scott Cotton (fourth hand) sailed a classy series with few errors. Their final scorecard of 19 points, a whopping 32.5 points from the nearest threat, proved an unclimbable mountain.\" (http://www.mysailing.com.au/news/ian-brown-wins-sb20-national-championship-in-melbourne#cEzGHX6BhXTPBDKS.99)\n\nIan began coaching for class association, State and the National Sailing associations in 1974. He began Olympic coaching on request from Colin Beashel for his Star Class efforts. Ian best coaching was each of three World 49er Championship wins by Chris Nicholson (two with Daniel Phillips and one with Ed Smyth). In one of these years he also coached the Star Class World Championship win by Colin Beashel and David Giles in Slovenia. A personal highlight during this time was finding a wealthy owner/crew for Colin's involvement and win, and Ian Brown's second place at the 1993 World Etchells Championships. Both were using a full set of sails from Ian's own sail loft. They worked collaboratively in training, and warming up just before each world championship race. Ian also worked for Olympic medalist, Americas Cup tactician and Round the World Race winner John Kostecki (with crew Tom Olsen) for a very close 2nd place at 1996 USA Star Class Olympic Games selection regatta. He also coached numerous Olympic classes to international regatta podium placings.\n\nOver the fourteen years of existence, the sails and his design work from Ian Brown's sail loft, One Design & Skiff Sails Pty Ltd, had world championship wins in the 505 Class, 420 Class, Moth Class, 14ft Skiff, Flying 15, and Etchell Classes. \n\n[[File:Lfetme10.jpg|thumb|Ian Brown on right, invited and made his system work well for Victor Kovalenko. Victor achieved both Mens and Womens Olympic 470 Gold Medals. Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.]]In 1997 Ian was selected as the Yachting Australia Head Coach charged to develop and implement an Australian Olympic Sailing development program that would win as many sailing Olympic Medals as possible at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games (John Boultbee reference document). Ian and his administrator reported to an independent board made up from senior sport funding executives from the Australian Olympic Committee Craig Phillips, the Australian Institute of Sport Geoff Strang, the NSW institute of Sport Michael Scott and, Chief executive of Yachting Australia Phillip Jones(Geoff Strang reference document). At a sailing funding level, the plan submitted by Ian and his administrator achieved the then, by far, biggest ever sailing based \"Special Initiatives\" Grant from the Australian Olympic Committee which allowed far greater depth of sailing coaching and equipment projects than had ever been conducted. At a home Games all Olympic Sailing disciplines are represented. His program, at that time, produced the best ever Australian medal haul for Sailing at an Olympic Games as well as in the lead up world championship regattas. It included World Championship wins and podium placings in the former most weak of Australian Olympic sailing disciplines. Two of the prior lesser performing disciplines achieved Olympic Gold medals. He was responsible for inviting and achieving both Trisha Leahy Hong Kong's sailboarding Gold Medallist's Sports psychologist and Ukrainian gold medal winning coach Victor Kovalenko (The Medal Maker) onto his team and Victor to move to Australia. Due to the increasing number of female athletes involved in Olympic sailing disciplines Ian spent considerable time discussing coaching with the females involved and with their endorsement asked Dutch born coach Erik Stibbe onto his program. Erik was coach to the Laser discipline and Michael Blackburn's Olympic Bronze medal, as well as the Europe Class and its representative(Trisha Leahy personal reference). Ian was also responsible for the first ever National Olympic Sailing Training Base at HMAS Penguin (approved by Brigadier Adrian d'Hage), and the first ever full-time Olympic sailing coaching programs across the Olympic squad. While overseas, he met with numerous country Olympic sailing program managers and formed a Danish Australian cooperative agreement, subsequently signed off between the Danish and Australian Olympic Committees. This shared some of their sailing resources when teams in Europe or in Australia. This agreement brought the potential Australian Sailing Olympians for the first time to practice dormitory living together as at the Olympic Games, and receive sport science appraisals while in Europe. His program was recongised by the Australian Institute of Sport for delivering a sports science program that was the most improved of all Australian Olympic Sports and was asked and gave a seminar to all Olympic sports head coaches or managers at Canberra on his planning and this international cooperation. As a result of the success of Ian's program, its athletes' performances and staff, Yachting Australia was awarded a position as one of the exclusive Olympic sports within the Australian Institute of Sport.\n\nQuotes:[[File:Lfetme1.jpg|thumb|2000 Olympic Sailing Program        Architect & Head Coach]]Re Strategic Plan. \" Dear Ian, Thank you for sending me the strategic Plan.

His first traditional dinghy sailing and racing regatta after 35 years was at Riva Del Garda with expert German crew Holger Jess. Most memorable moment during this tour was a renewed friendship with world famous Spanish Olympic sailing coach Paul Maes, now famously known as \"The Doreste coach\" but also a sailing coach to Spanish royalty, and being told that at the 1976 Olympic Games, when Brown achieved Bronze, Paul had coached the Spanish 470 silver medalist Antonio Gorostegui.\n\n\n\nIan has spent considerable time racing with or assisting other younger sailing competitors such as Glenn Bourke (later becoming multiple world Laser Class champion and Olympian); Malcolm Page (later becoming Australia's first ever sailing dual Olympic Gold medalist); offered his own crewing and sports boat sailing equipment to Nathan Outteridge (later became Olympic Gold and Silver Medalist plus Americas cup helmsman); offered his laser class equipment to Australian Olympic representative Sarah Blank for pre Games use in Europe. \n\n\nCurrently Ian has casual consulting/mentor, for elite sailboat racing skills and life, relationships with a number of young emerging elite sailing athletes.\n\n{{Infobox sailor\n| birth_date     = {{birth-date and age|4 April 1954}}\n<ref>470 The Great Book, Alain Corcuff and Nicolas Guichet.

Erik was coach to the Laser discipline and Michael Blackburn's Olympic Bronze medal, as well as the Europe Class and its representative(Trisha Leahy personal reference). Ian was also responsible for the first ever National Olympic Sailing Training Base at HMAS Penguin (approved by Brigadier Adrian d'Hage), and the first ever full-time Olympic sailing coaching programs across the Olympic squad. While overseas, he met with numerous country Olympic sailing program managers and formed a Danish Australian cooperative agreement, subsequently signed off between the Danish and Australian Olympic Committees. This shared some of their sailing resources when teams in Europe or in Australia. This agreement brought the potential Australian Sailing Olympians for the first time to practice dormitory living together as at the Olympic Games, and receive sport science appraisals while in Europe. His program was recongised by the Australian Institute of Sport for delivering a sports science program that was the most improved of all Australian Olympic Sports and was asked and gave a seminar to all Olympic sports head coaches or managers at Canberra on his planning and this international cooperation. As a result of the success of Ian's program, its athletes' performances and staff, Yachting Australia was awarded a position as one of the exclusive Olympic sports within the Australian Institute of Sport.\n\nQuotes:[[File:Lfetme1.jpg|thumb|2000 Olympic Sailing Program        Architect & Head Coach]]Re Strategic Plan. \" Dear Ian, Thank you for sending me the strategic Plan. I am please to see this amount of planning and the thought going into it. It makes it a lot easier to support sailing.\" John Boultbee, Director of Australian Institute of Sport.\n\nRe: Implementation. \"He also successfully initiated and implemented a unique, cohesive, strategic, and positive evaluation and review system.\"   Trisha Leahy, Senior Psychologist, Australian Institute of Sport.\n\nRe: Strategic focus. \"Ian did a remarkable job in keeping the program focussed on both long and short tern goals in the lead up to the Olympics. Our results in the sport were the best ever at Olympic Level.\"  \nDirector of Sport Management Division, Australian Institute of Sport and part of management team oversighting the funding and implementation of Ian's designed Australian Olympic Sailing program.\n\n\nPersonally Ian was awarded an International Olympic Committee Certificate of Merit for his efforts and very high level collaborations in regard of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.\n\n[[File:505BarcelMeElWells1 (5).jpg|thumb|Ian Brown, with UK naval architecture university student Elliot Wells, International 505 racing in Barcelona August 2019]]\n\n\nAfter more than a decade of medical issues including a problematic spine operation, prostate cancer and two years of frozen shoulder Ian competed in 4 International 505 regattas in Europe and Denmark during July and August 2019. His first traditional dinghy sailing and racing regatta after 35 years was at Riva Del Garda with expert German crew Holger Jess. Most memorable moment during this tour was a renewed friendship with world famous Spanish Olympic sailing coach Paul Maes, and being told that at the 1976 Olympic Games, when Brown achieved Bronze, Paul had coached the Spanish 470 silver medallist Antonio Gorostegui.\n\n\nIan has spent considerable time racing with or assisting other younger sailing competitors such as Glenn Bourke (later becoming multiple world Laser Class champion and Olympian); Malcolm Page (later becoming Australia's first ever sailing dual Olympic Gold medallist); offered his own crewing and sports boat sailing equipment to Nathan Outteridge (later became Olympic Gold and Silver Medallist plus Americas cup helmsman); offered his laser class equipment to Australian Olympic representative Sarah Blank for pre Games use in Europe. \n\n\nCurrently Ian has casual consulting/mentor, for elite sailboat racing skills and life, relationships with a number of young emerging elite sailing athletes.\n\n{{Infobox sailor\n| birth_date     = {{birth-date and age|4 April 1954}}\n<ref>470 The Great Book, Alain Corcuff and Nicolas Guichet.

{"title_page": "Technological unemployment", "text_new": "{{short description|Unemployment primarily caused by technological change}}\n[[File:Pyxis Pharmacy Robot by Nurse Station.JPG|thumb|In the 21st century, robots are beginning to perform roles not just in manufacturing, but also in the service sector{{snd}} in healthcare, for example .]]\n'''Technological unemployment''' is the loss of jobs caused by [[technological change]]. It is a key type of [[structural unemployment]].\n\nTechnological change typically includes the introduction of labour-saving \"mechanical-muscle\" machines or more efficient \"mechanical-mind\" processes ([[automation]]). Just as horses employed as prime movers were gradually made obsolete by the automobile, humans' jobs have also been affected throughout [[modern history]]. Historical examples include [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|artisan weavers]] reduced to poverty after the introduction of [[Power loom|mechanized looms]]. During [[World War II]], [[Alan Turing]]'s [[Bombe]] machine compressed and decoded thousands of man-years worth of encrypted data in a matter of hours. A contemporary example of technological unemployment is the displacement of retail cashiers by [[Self-checkout|self-service tills]].\n\nThat technological change can cause short-term job losses is widely accepted. The view that it can lead to lasting increases in unemployment has long been controversial. Participants in the technological unemployment debates can be broadly divided into optimists and pessimists. ''Optimists'' agree that innovation may be disruptive to jobs in the short term, yet hold that various compensation effects ensure there is never a long-term negative impact on jobs,  whereas ''pessimists'' contend that at least in some circumstances, new technologies can lead to a lasting decline in the total number of workers in employment. The phrase \"technological unemployment\" was popularised by [[John Maynard Keynes]] in the 1930s, who said it was a \"only a temporary phase of maladjustment\".<ref>''[https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/1930/our-grandchildren.htm The Economic Possibilities of our Grandchildren]'' (1930). E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3044448 SSRN, part 2(2)]</ref> Yet the issue of machines displacing human labour has been discussed since at least [[Aristotle]]'s time.\n\nPrior to the 18th century both the elite and [[common people]] would generally take the pessimistic view on technological unemployment, at least in cases where the issue arose. Due to generally low unemployment in much of pre-modern history, the topic was rarely a prominent concern.  In the 18th century fears over the impact of machinery on jobs intensified with the growth of mass unemployment, especially in Great Britain which was then at the forefront of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Yet some economic thinkers began to argue against these fears, claiming that overall innovation would not have negative effects on jobs. These arguments were formalised in the early 19th century by the [[classical economists]]. During the second half of the 19th century, it became increasingly apparent that technological progress was benefiting all sections of society, including the working class. Concerns over the negative impact of innovation diminished. The term \"[[Luddite]] fallacy\" was coined to describe the thinking that innovation would have lasting harmful effects on employment.\n\nThe view that technology is unlikely to lead to long term unemployment has been repeatedly challenged by a minority of economists. In the early 1800s these included [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]] himself. There were dozens of economists warning about technological unemployment during brief intensifications of the debate that spiked in the 1930s and 1960s. Especially in Europe, there were further warnings in the closing two decades of the twentieth century, as commentators noted an enduring rise in unemployment suffered by many industrialised nations since the 1970s. Yet a clear majority of both professional economists and the interested general public held the optimistic view through most of the 20th century.\n\nIn the second decade of the 21st century,  a number of studies have been released suggesting that technological unemployment may be increasing worldwide. Oxford Professors [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] and Michael Osborne, for example, have estimated that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2017-01-01|title=The future of employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerisation?|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=114|pages=254\u2013280|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2016.08.019|issn=0040-1625|last1=Frey|first1=Carl Benedikt|last2=Osborne|first2=Michael A|citeseerx=10.1.1.395.416}}</ref> However, their findings have frequently been misinterpreted, and on the PBS NewsHours they again made clear that their findings do not necessarily imply future technological unemployment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/brink-jobless-future|title=Are we on the brink of a jobless future?|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-15|date=31 August 2017}}</ref> While many economists and commentators still argue such fears are unfounded, as was widely accepted for most of the previous two centuries, concern over technological unemployment is growing once again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acting-man.com/?p=32134|title=In the Future, Will Everyone Be Unemployed?|date=4 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/15/news/economy/zero-unemployment/|title=What 0% unemployment looks like|first=Annalyn|last=Censky|website=cnn.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/|title=A World Without Work|journal=The Atlantic|first=Derek|last=Thompson|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref> A report in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' in 2017 quotes knowledgeable people such as economist [[Gene Sperling]] and management professor [[Andrew McAfee]] on the idea that handling existing and impending job loss to automation is a \"significant issue\".<ref name=\"Dreyfuss_2017-03-24\">{{Citation |last=Dreyfuss |first=Emily |date=2017-03-24 |title=Hate to break it to Steve Mnuchin, but AI's already taking jobs |journal=Wired |url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/hate-break-steve-mnuchin-ais-already-taking-jobs/ |postscript=.}}</ref> Regarding a recent claim by Treasury Secretary [[Steve Mnuchin]] that automation is not \"going to have any kind of big effect on the economy for the next 50 or 100 years\", says McAfee, \"I don't talk to anyone in the field who believes that.\"<ref name=\"Dreyfuss_2017-03-24\"/> Recent technological innovations have the potential to render humans obsolete with the professional, white-collar, low-skilled, creative fields, and other \"mental jobs\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/business/economy/a-future-without-jobs-two-views-of-the-changing-work-force.html|title=A Future Without Jobs?

And the general-purpose aspect of software technology means that even the industries and jobs that it creates are not forever.|source=Lawrence Summers<ref name=\"summers\" />|quoted=1}}\n\nAll participants in the technological employment debates agree that temporary job losses can result from technological innovation.  Similarly, there is no dispute that innovation sometimes has positive effects on workers. Disagreement focuses on whether it is possible for innovation to have a lasting negative impact on overall employment. Levels of persistent unemployment can be quantified empirically, but the causes are subject to debate. Optimists accept short term unemployment may be caused by innovation, yet claim that after a while, ''compensation effects'' will always create at least as many jobs as were originally destroyed.  While this optimistic view has been continually challenged, it was dominant among mainstream economists for most of the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref name=\"Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 77 - 90\">{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 77\u201390}}</ref><ref name = \"sympathy\"/> For example, labor economists [[Jacob Mincer]] and Stephan Danninger develop an empirical study using micro-data from the [[Panel Study of Income Dynamics]], and find that although in the short run, technological progress seems to have unclear effects on aggregate unemployment, it reduces unemployment in the long run. When they include a 5-year lag, however, the evidence supporting a short-run employment effect of technology seems to disappear as well, suggesting that technological unemployment \"appears to be a myth\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mincer|first=Jacob|last2=Danninger|first2=Stephan|date=July 2000|title=Technology, Unemployment, and Inflation|journal=National Bureau of Economic Research|volume=|pages=|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w7817.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of [[structural unemployment]], a lasting level of joblessness that does not disappear even at the high point of the [[business cycle]], became popular in the 1960s. For pessimists, technological unemployment is one of the factors driving the wider phenomena of structural unemployment. Since the 1980s, even optimistic economists have increasingly accepted that structural unemployment has indeed risen in advanced economies (ref missing), but they have tended to blame this on [[globalisation]] and [[offshoring]] rather than technological change. Others claim a chief cause of the lasting increase in unemployment has been the reluctance of governments to pursue [[Expansionary Fiscal Policy|expansionary policies]] since the [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displacement of Keynesianism]] that occurred in the 1970s and early 80s.<ref name=\"Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 77 - 90\"/><ref name=\"Effective Demand\"/><ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\"/> In the 21st century, and especially since 2013, pessimists have been arguing with increasing frequency that lasting worldwide technological unemployment is a growing threat.<ref name = \"sympathy\"/><ref name = \"replicants\"/><ref name=\"Martin\"/><ref>On the other hand, from a more positive perspective, some have argued that technological change will alter the structure of an organization in the sense that those in management roles will increasingly become more specialized to those roles as technology that assists collaboration and workflow management allows employees to manage themselves. The typical management role will, as a result, change to allow managers to concentrate on the task of supporting employees and improving their performance thus allowing them to add more, rather than less, value.</ref>\n\n===Compensation effects===\n[[File:BrownManchesterMuralJohnKay.jpg|thumb|''John Kay inventor of the Fly Shuttle AD 1753'', by [[Ford Madox Brown]], depicting the inventor [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] kissing his wife goodbye as men carry him away from his home to escape a mob angry about his labour-saving mechanical loom. Compensation effects were not widely understood at this time. ]]\nCompensation effects are labour-friendly consequences of innovation which \"compensate\" workers for job losses initially caused by new technology. In the 1820s, several compensation effects were described by [[Jean-Baptiste Say|Say]] in response to Ricardo's statement that long term technological unemployment could occur. Soon after, a whole system of effects was developed by [[John Ramsay McCulloch|Ramsey McCulloch]].  The system was labelled \"compensation theory\" by [[Karl Marx|Marx]], who proceeded to attack the ideas, arguing that none of the effects were guaranteed to operate.  Disagreement over the effectiveness of compensation effects has remained a central part of academic debates on technological unemployment ever since.<ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\"/><ref name=\"Blaug 1997 loc= p182\">{{Harvnb|Blaug|1997|loc= p182}}</ref>\n\nCompensation effects include: \n# By new machines. (The labour needed to build the new equipment that applied innovation requires.)\n# By new investments. (Enabled by the cost savings and therefore increased profits from the new technology.)\n#  By changes in wages. (In cases where unemployment does occur, this can cause a lowering of wages, thus allowing more workers to be re-employed at the now lower cost.  On the other hand, sometimes workers will enjoy wage increases as their profitability rises. This leads to increased income and therefore increased spending, which in turn encourages job creation.)\n# By lower prices.  (Which then lead to more demand, and therefore more employment.) Lower prices can also help offset wage cuts, as cheaper goods will increase workers' buying power.\n# By new products. (Where innovation directly creates new jobs.)\n\nThe \"by new machines\" effect is now rarely discussed by economists; it is often accepted that Marx successfully refuted it.<ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\"/> Even pessimists often concede that product innovation associated with the \"by new products\" effect can sometimes have a positive effect on employment. An important distinction can be drawn between 'process'  and 'product' innovations.<ref group=\"note\">Labour-displacing technologies can be classified under the headings of [[mechanization]], [[automation]], and process improvement. The first two fundamentally involve transferring tasks from humans to machines. The third often involves the elimination of tasks altogether. The common theme of all three is that tasks are removed from the workforce, decreasing employment. In practice, the categories often overlap: a process improvement can include an automating or mechanizing achievement. The line between mechanization and automation is also subjective, as sometimes mechanization can involve sufficient [[control theory|control]] to be viewed as part of automation.</ref> Evidence from Latin America seems to suggest that product innovation significantly contributes to the employment growth at the firm level, more so than process innovation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crespi|first=Gustavo|last2=Tacsir|first2=Ezequiel|date=December 2012|title=Effects of Innovation on Employment in Latin America|url=|journal=Inter-American Development Bank|volume=|pages=}}</ref> The extent to which the other effects are successful in compensating the workforce for job losses has been extensively debated throughout the history of modern economics; the issue is still not resolved.<ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://ftp.iza.org/dp6291.pdf\n|title= Innovation, Employment and Skills in Advanced and Developing Countries: A Survey of the Literature\n|publisher= [[Institute for the Study of Labor]]\n|last= Vivarelli\n|first= Marco\n|date = January 2012\n|accessdate=14 July 2015}}\n</ref><ref name = \"Vivarelli2007\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://ftp.iza.org/dp2621.pdf\n|title= Innovation and Employment: : A Survey\n|publisher= [[Institute for the Study of Labor]]\n|last= Vivarelli\n|first= Marco\n|date = February 2007\n|accessdate=14 July 2015}}\n</ref> One such effect that potentially complements the compensation effect is job [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]]. According to research developed by Enrico Moretti, with each additional skilled job created in high tech industries in a given city, more than two jobs are created in the non-tradable sector. His findings suggest that technological growth and the resulting job-creation in high-tech industries might have a more significant [[spillover effect]] than we have anticipated.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moretti|first=Enrico|date=May 2010|title=Local Multipliers|url=|journal=American Economic Review|volume=100|issue=2|pages=373\u2013377|doi=10.1257/aer.100.2.373}}</ref> Evidence from Europe also supports such a job multiplier effect, showing local high-tech jobs could create five additional low-tech jobs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goos|first=Maarten|last2=Konings|first2=Jozef|last3=Vandeweyer|first3=Marieke|date=September 2015|title=Employment Growth in Europe: The Roles of Innovation, Local Job Multipliers and Institutions.|url=|journal=Tjalling C. Koopmans Research Institute|volume=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nMany economists now pessimistic about technological unemployment accept that compensation effects did largely operate as the optimists claimed through most of the 19th and 20th century. Yet they hold that the advent of computerisation means that compensation effects are now less effective. An early example of this argument was made by [[Wassily Leontief]] in 1983. He conceded that after some disruption, the advance of [[mechanization]] during the Industrial Revolution actually increased the demand for labour as well as increasing pay due to effects that flow from increased [[productivity]]. While early machines lowered the demand for muscle power, they were unintelligent and needed large armies of human operators to remain productive. Yet since the introduction of computers into the workplace, there is now less need not just for muscle power but also for human brain power. Hence even as productivity continues to rise, the lower demand for human labour may mean less pay and employment.<ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\"/><ref name=\"Martin\"/><ref name = \"Advance\"/> However, this argument is not fully supported by more recent empirical studies. One research done by [[Erik Brynjolfsson]] and [[Lorin Hitt|Lorin M. Hitt]] in 2003 presents direct evidence that suggests a positive short-term effect of computerization on firm-level measured productivity and output growth. In addition, they find the long-term productivity contribution of computerization and technological changes might even be greater.\n\n===The Luddite fallacy===\n{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=If the Luddite fallacy were true we would all be out of work because productivity has been increasing for two centuries.|source=[[Alex Tabarrok]]<ref name=\"Tabarrok\">{{cite web |url=http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2003/12/productivity_an.html |title=Productivity and unemployment |accessdate=2007-03-11 |last=Tabarrok |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex Tabarrok |date=2003-12-31 |work=Marginal Revolution}}</ref>|quoted=1}}\nThe term \"Luddite fallacy\" is sometimes used to express the view that those concerned about long term  technological unemployment are committing a fallacy, as they fail to account for compensation effects. People who use the term typically expect that technological progress will have no long-term impact on employment levels, and eventually will raise wages for all workers, because progress helps to increase the overall wealth of society. The term is based on the early 19th century example of the [[Luddite]]s. During the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, the dominant view among economists has been that belief in long term technological unemployment was indeed a [[fallacy]]. More recently, there has been increased support for the view that the benefits of automation are not equally distributed.<ref name = \"sympathy\">\n{{cite news\n|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/opinion/krugman-sympathy-for-the-luddites.html?_r=0\n|title= Sympathy for the Luddites\n|work= New York Times\n|last= Krugman\n|first= Paul\n|date = 2013-06-12\n|accessdate=14 July 2015|author-link= Paul Krugman\n}}\n</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Ford|2009|loc= Chpt 3, 'The Luddite Fallacy'}}</ref><ref name = \"Death\">{{cite web\n  |url= http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/robert-skidelsky-revisits-the-luddites--claim-that-automation-depresses-real-wages\n  |title= Death to Machines?\n  |publisher= [[Project Syndicate]]\n  |author= Lord Skidelsky\n |date = 2013-06-12\n|accessdate=14 July 2015|author-link= Robert Skidelsky, Baron Skidelsky\n }}\n</ref>\n\nThere are two underlying premises for why long-term difficulty could develop. The one that has traditionally been deployed is that ascribed to the Luddites (whether or not it is a truly accurate summary of their thinking), which is that there is a finite amount of work available and if machines do that work, there can be no other work left for humans to do. Economists call this the [[lump of labour fallacy]], arguing that in reality no such limitation exists. However, the other premise is that it is possible for long-term difficulty to arise that has nothing to do with any lump of labour. In this view, the amount of work that can exist is infinite, but (1) machines can do most of the \"easy\" work, (2) the definition of what is \"easy\" expands as information technology progresses, and (3) the work that lies beyond \"easy\" (the work that requires more skill, talent, knowledge, and insightful connections between pieces of knowledge) may require greater cognitive faculties than most humans are able to supply, as point 2 continually advances. This latter view is the one supported by many modern advocates of the possibility of long-term, systemic technological unemployment.\n\n===Skill levels and technological unemployment===\nA common view among those discussing the effect of innovation on the labour market has been that it mainly hurts those with low skills, while often benefiting  skilled workers. According to scholars such as [[Lawrence F. Katz]], this may have been true for much of the twentieth century, yet in the 19th century, innovations in the workplace largely displaced costly skilled artisans, and generally benefited the low skilled.  While 21st century innovation has been replacing some unskilled work, other low skilled occupations remain resistant to automation, while white collar work requiring intermediate skills is increasingly being performed by autonomous computer programs.<ref name = \"relative\">{{cite book |chapter=Technical Change and the Relative Demand for Skilled Labor: The United States in Historical Perspective |first=Lawrence F. |last=Katz |first2=Robert A. |last2=Margo |title=Human Capital in History: The American Record |editor-last=Boustan |editor2-last=Frydman |editor3-last=Margo |year=2014 |doi=10.3386/w18752 }}</ref><ref name = \"polarization\">\n{{cite journal\n|author1=David H.

Most existing firm-level research has found a labor-friendly nature of technological innovations. For example, German economists Stefan Lachenmaier and Horst Rottmann find that both product and process innovation have a positive effect on employment. They also find that process innovation has a more significant job creation effect than product innovation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lachenmaier|first=Stefan|last2=Rottmann|first2=Horst|title=May 2010|url=|journal=International Journal of Industrial Organization|volume=29|issue=2|pages=210\u2013220|doi=10.1016/j.ijindorg.2010.05.004|year=2011|citeseerx=10.1.1.522.7577}}</ref> This result is supported by evidence in the United States as well, which shows that manufacturing firm innovations have a positive effect on the total number of jobs, not just limited to firm-specific behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coad|first=Alex|last2=Rao|first2=Rekha|date=May 2011|title=The firm-level employment effects of innovations in high-tech US manufacturing industries|url=|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics|volume=21|issue=2|pages=255\u2013283|doi=10.1007/s00191-010-0209-x}}</ref>\n\nAt the industry level, however, researchers have found mixed results with regard to the employment effect of technological changes. A 2017 study on manufacturing and service sectors in 11 European countries suggests that positive employment effects of technological innovations only exist in the medium- and high-tech sectors. There also seems to be a negative correlation between employment and capital formation, which suggests that technological progress could potentially be labor-saving given that process innovation is often incorporated in investment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Piva|first=Mariacristina|last2=Vivarelli|first2=Marco|date=January 2017|title=Technological Change and Employment: Were Ricardo and Marx Right?|url=|journal=Institute of Labor Economics|volume=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nLimited macroeconomic analysis has been done to study the relationship between technological shocks and unemployment. The small amount of existing research, however, suggests mixed results. Italian economist Marco Vivarelli finds that the labor-saving effect of process innovation seems to have affected the Italian economy more negatively than the United States. On the other hand, the job creating effect of product innovation could only be observed in the United States, not Italy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Economics of Technology and Employment Theory and Empirical Evidence|last=Vivarelli|first=Marco|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=1995|isbn=978-1-85898-166-6|location=Italy}}</ref> Another study in 2013 finds a more transitory, rather than permanent, unemployment effect of technological change.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feldmann|first=Horst|date=November 2013|title=Technological unemployment in industrial countries|url=|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics|volume=23|issue=5|pages=1099\u20131126|doi=10.1007/s00191-013-0308-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Measures of technological innovation ===\nThere have been four main approaches that attempt to capture and document technological innovation quantitatively. The first one, proposed by Jordi Gali in 1999 and further developed by Neville Francis and Valerie A. Ramey in 2005, is to use long-run restrictions in a Vector Autoregression (VAR) to identify technological shocks, assuming that only technology affects long-run productivity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gali|first=Jordi|date=1999|title=Technology, Employment, and the Business Cycle: Do Technology Shocks Explain Aggregate Fluctuations?|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/697e5bf9da0ea3193c2dc64460286bab36dd4b47|journal=American Economic Review|volume=89|issue=1|pages=249\u2013271|doi=10.1257/aer.89.1.249}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Francis|first=Neville|last2=Ramey|first2=Valerie|date=2005|title=Is the Technology-Driven Real Business Cycle Hypothesis Dead?

However, there are limitations with direct measures such as R&D. For example, since R&D only measures the input in innovation, the output is unlikely to be perfectly correlated with the input. In addition, R&D fails to capture the indeterminate lag between developing a new product or service, and bringing it to market.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alexopoulos|first=Michelle|last2=Cohen|first2=Jon|date=2011|title=Volumes of evidence: examining technical change in the last century through a new lens.|url=https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/public/workingPapers/tecipa-392.pdf|journal=Canadian Journal of Economics|volume=44|issue=2|pages=413\u2013450|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5982.2011.01639.x}}</ref>\n\nThe fourth approach, constructed by Michelle Alexopoulos, looks at the number of new titles published in the fields of technology and computer science to reflect technological progress, which turns out to be consistent with R&D expenditure data.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alexopoulos|first=Michelle|date=2011|title=Read All about It!!

Sometimes, these unemployed workers would starve to death or were forced into slavery themselves although in other cases they were supported by handouts.

It would assuredly bring them to ruin by depriving them of employment, thus making them beggars.\"  ]]\nIn Great Britain, the ruling elite began to take a less restrictive approach to innovation somewhat earlier than in much of continental Europe, which has been cited as a possible reason for Britain's early lead in driving the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>E.g by [[Sir John Habakkuk]] in ''American and British Technology in the Nineteenth Century'' (1962), [[Cambridge University Press]] \u2013 Habakkuk also went on to say that due to labour shortages, compared with their British counterparts there was far less resistance from U.S. workers  to the introduction of technology, leading to more update of innovation, and hence to the more efficient [[American system of manufacturing]]</ref>  Yet concern over the impact of innovation on employment remained strong through the 16th and early 17th century. A famous example of new technology being refused occurred when the inventor [[William Lee (inventor)|William Lee]] invited Queen Elizabeth I to view a labour saving knitting machine. The Queen declined to issue a patent on the grounds that the technology might cause unemployment among textile workers. After moving to France and also failing to achieve success in promoting his invention, Lee returned to England but was again refused by Elizabeth's successor [[James VI and I|James I]] for the same reason.<ref name=\"Martin\"/>\n\nEspecially after the [[Glorious Revolution]], authorities became less sympathetic to workers concerns about losing their jobs due to innovation. An increasingly influential strand of [[Mercantilism|Mercantilist]] thought held that introducing labour saving technology would actually reduce unemployment, as it would allow British firms to increase their market share against foreign competition.  From the early 18th century workers could no longer rely on support from the authorities against the perceived threat of technological unemployment. They would sometimes take [[direct action]], such as machine breaking, in attempts to protect themselves from disruptive innovation. [[Schumpeter]] notes that as the 18th century progressed, thinkers would raise the alarm about technological unemployment with increasing frequency, with [[Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi|von Justi]] being a prominent example.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schumpeter|1987|loc= Chpt 4}}</ref> Yet Schumpeter also notes that the prevailing view among the elite solidified on the position that technological unemployment would not be a long-term problem.<ref name=\"Martin\"/><ref name=\"Schumpeter 1987 loc= Chpt 6\"/>\n\n===19th century===\nIt was only in the 19th century that debates over technological unemployment became intense, especially in Great Britain where many economic thinkers of the time were concentrated. Building on the work of [[Josiah Tucker|Dean Tucker]] and [[Adam Smith]], [[Political economy|political economists]] began to create what would become the modern discipline of [[economics]].<ref group=\"note\">Smith did not directly address the problem of technological unemployment, but the Dean had, saying in 1757 that in the long term, the introduction of machinery would allow more employment than would have been possible without them.</ref> While rejecting much of mercantilism, members of the new discipline largely agreed that technological unemployment would not be an enduring problem.  In the first few decades of the 19th century, several prominent political economists did, however, argue against the optimistic view, claiming that innovation could cause long-term unemployment. These included [[Jean Charles L\u00e9onard de Sismondi|Sismondi]],<ref name=\"Sowell_2006\">{{Citation |last=Sowell |first=T. |year=2006 |title=Chapter 5: Sismondi: A Neglected Pioneer |work=On Classical Economics}}</ref> [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus]], [[John Stuart Mill|J S Mill]], and from 1821, Ricardo himself.<ref>While initially of the view that innovation benefited the whole population,  Ricardo was persuaded by Malthus that technology could both push down wages for the working class, and cause long-term unemployment. He famously expressed these views in a chapter called  \"on Machinery\",  added to the third and final (1821) edition of [[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]</ref> As arguably the most respected political economist of his age, Ricardo's view was challenging to others in the discipline. The first major economist to respond was [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], who argued that no one would introduce machinery if they were going to reduce the amount of product,<ref group=\"note\">Typically the introduction of machinery would both increase output and lower cost per unit.</ref> and that as [[Say's Law]]  states that supply creates its own demand, any displaced workers would automatically find work elsewhere once the market had had time to adjust.<ref>{{cite journal\n|url= https://www.academia.edu/3465367\n|title= Is industrial innovation destroying jobs?   \n|journal= Academia.edu (Originally Published in the Cato Journal )\n|date = 18 Jan 2014\n|accessdate= 14 July 2015\n|last1= Bartlett \n|first1= Bruce \n}}</ref>   \n[[John Ramsay McCulloch|Ramsey McCulloch]] expanded and formalised Say's optimistic views on technological unemployment, and was supported by others such as [[Charles Babbage]], [[Nassau Senior]] and many other lesser known political economists.  Towards the middle of the 19th century, [[Karl Marx]] joined the debates. Building on the work of Ricardo and Mill, Marx went much further, presenting a deeply pessimistic view of technological unemployment; his views attracted many followers and founded an enduring school of thought but mainstream economics was not dramatically changed.  By the 1870s,  at least in Great Britain, technological unemployment faded both as a popular concern and as an issue for academic debate. It had become increasingly apparent that innovation was increasing prosperity for all sections of British society, including the working class.  As the classical school of thought gave way to [[neoclassical economics]], mainstream thinking was tightened to take into account and refute the pessimistic arguments of Mill and Ricardo.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 2, 20\u201322}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:1980s computer worker, Centers for Disease Control.jpg|thumb|Critics of the view that innovation causes lasting unemployment argue that technology is used by workers and does not replace them on a large scale.]]\nFor the first two decades of the 20th century, mass unemployment was not the major problem it had been in the first half of the 19th. While the [[Marxian economics|Marxist school]] and a few other thinkers still challenged the optimistic view, technological unemployment was not a significant concern for mainstream economic thinking until the mid to late 1920s. In the 1920s mass unemployment re-emerged as a pressing issue within Europe.  At this time the U.S. was generally more prosperous, but even there urban unemployment had begun to increase from 1927. [[History of agriculture in the United States#1920s|Rural American workers had been suffering job losses]] from the start of the 1920s; many had been displaced by improved agricultural technology, such as the [[tractor]]. The centre of gravity for economic debates had by this time moved from Great Britain to the United States, and it was here that the 20th century's two great periods of debate over technological unemployment largely occurred.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 2, 8\u201312}}</ref>\n\nThe peak periods for the two debates were in the 1930s and the 1960s.  According to economic historian Gregory R Woirol, the two episodes share several similarities.<ref name=\"Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 8 - 12\">{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 8\u201312}}</ref>  In both cases academic debates were preceded by an outbreak of popular concern, sparked by recent rises in unemployment. In both cases the debates were not conclusively settled, but faded away as unemployment was reduced by an outbreak of war \u2013 World War II for the debate of the 1930s, and the [[Vietnam war]] for the 1960s episodes. In both cases, the debates were conducted within the prevailing paradigm at the time, with little reference to earlier thought. In the 1930s, optimists based their arguments largely on neo-classical beliefs in the self-correcting power of markets to automatically reduce any short-term unemployment via compensation effects. In the 1960s, faith in compensation effects was less strong, but the mainstream [[Keynesian economists]] of the time largely believed government intervention would be able to counter any persistent technological unemployment that was not cleared by market forces. Another similarity was the publication of a major Federal study towards the end of each episode, which broadly found that long-term technological unemployment was not occurring (though the studies did agree innovation was a major factor in the short term displacement of workers, and advised government action to provide assistance).<ref group=\"note\">In the 1930s, this study was \n''Unemployment and technological change''(Report no. G-70, 1940)  by Corrington Calhoun Gill  of the 'National Research Project on Reemployment Opportunities and Recent changes in Industrial Techniques'. Some earlier Federal reports took a pessimistic view of technological unemployment, e.g.  ''Memorandum on Technological Unemployment'' (1933) by Ewan Clague  Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Some authorities \u2013 e.g.   Udo Sautter in Chpt 5 of ''Three Cheers for the Unemployed: Government and Unemployment Before the New Deal'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991) \u2013 say that in the early 1930s there was near consensus among US experts that technological unemployment was a major problem.  Other's though like [[Bruce Bartlett]] in [https://www.academia.edu/3465367/Is_Industrial_Innovation_Destroying_Jobs  Is Industrial Innovation Destroying Jobs (Cato Journal 1984)] argue that most economists remained optimistic even during the 1930s.  In the 1960s episode, the major Federal study that bookmarked the end of the period of intense debate was ''Technology and the American economy'' (1966) by the 'National Commission on Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress' [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=26449  established by president Lyndon Jonhson in 1964]</ref><ref name=\"Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 8 - 12\"/>\n\nAs the [[golden age of capitalism]] came to a close in the 1970s, unemployment once again rose, and this time generally remained relatively high for the rest of the century, across most advanced economies.  Several economists once again argued that this may be due to innovation, with perhaps the most prominent being  [[Paul Samuelson]].<ref>{{cite journal \n|url= https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/scandj/v91y1989i1p47-62.html\n|title=Ricardo Was Right!\n|journal= [[The Scandinavian Journal of Economics]] \n|volume=91 \n|issue= 1 \n|pages= 47\u201362 \n|first= Paul |last=Samuelson|date=1989\n|doi=10.2307/3440162|jstor=3440162\n}}</ref> Overall, the closing decades of the 20th century saw most concern expressed over technological unemployment in Europe, though there were several examples in the U.S.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 143\u2013144}}</ref>  A number of popular works warning of technological unemployment were also published.

In his view, \"already there are more American men on disability insurance than doing production work in manufacturing. And the trends are all in the wrong direction, particularly for the less skilled, as the capacity of capital embodying artificial intelligence to replace white-collar as well as blue-collar work will increase rapidly in the years ahead.\"  Summers has also said that  \"[T]here are many reasons to think the software revolution will be even more profound than the agricultural revolution. This time around, change will come faster and affect a much larger share of the economy. [...] [T]here are more sectors losing jobs than creating jobs. And the general-purpose aspect of software technology means that even the industries and jobs that it creates are not forever.

Despite being the first person to create a formal system describing  compensation effects, Ramsey McCulloch and most other classical economists advocated government aid for those suffering from technological unemployment, as they understood that market adjustment to new technology was not instantaneous and that those displaced by labour-saving technology would not always be able to immediately obtain alternative employment through their own efforts.<ref name=\"Blaug 1997 loc= p182\"/>\n\n=====Basic income=====\n{{Main|Basic income|Guaranteed minimum income}}\nSeveral commentators have argued that traditional forms of welfare payment may be inadequate as a response to the future challenges posed by technological unemployment, and have suggested a [[basic income]] as an alternative.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004|title = Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

Another objection is that funding it sustainably is a huge challenge. While new revenue-raising ideas have been proposed such as Martin Ford's wage recapture tax, how to fund a generous basic income remains a debated question, and skeptics have dismissed it as utopian. Even from a progressive viewpoint, there are concerns that a basic income set too low may not help the economically vulnerable, especially if financed largely from cuts to other forms of welfare.<ref name=\"paypressure\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Ford|2009|loc= pp.162-168}}.</ref><ref name = \"MITRotman\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/538401/who-will-own-the-robots/\n|title= Who Will Own the Robots?\n|publisher= [[MIT]]\n|last= Rotman \n|first= David \n|date = 16 June 2015\n|accessdate=14 July 2015}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite magazine\n|url= https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/something-for-everyone-0000546-v22n1\n|title= Why the Tech Elite Is Getting Behind Universal Basic Income\n|magazine= [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]\n|last= Schneider\n|first= Nathan\n|date = January 2015\n|accessdate=14 July 2015|author-link= Nathan Schneider\n}}\n</ref>\n\nTo better address both the funding concerns and concerns about government control, one alternative model is that the cost and control would be distributed across the private sector instead of the public sector. Companies across the economy would be required to employ humans, but the job descriptions would be left to private innovation, and individuals would have to compete to be hired and retained. This would be a for-profit sector analog of basic income, that is, a market-based form of basic income. It differs from a [[job guarantee]] in that the government is not the employer (rather, companies are) and there is no aspect of having employees who \"cannot be fired\", a problem that interferes with economic dynamism. The economic salvation in this model is not that every individual is guaranteed a job, but rather just that enough jobs exist that massive unemployment is avoided and employment is no longer solely the privilege of only the very smartest or highly trained 20% of the population. Another option for a market-based form of basic income has been proposed by the [[Center for Economic and Social Justice]] (CESJ) as part of \"a Just Third Way\" (a [[Third Way]] with greater justice) through widely distributed power and liberty. Called the Capital Homestead Act,<ref name=\"Capital_Homestead_Act\">{{Citation |publisher=[[Center for Economic and Social Justice]] |title=Capital Homestead Act Summary |url=http://www.cesj.org/learn/capital-homesteading/capital-homestead-act-summary/ }}</ref> it is reminiscent of [[James S.

Summers suggested more vigorous enforcement of anti-monopoly laws; reductions in \"excessive\" protection for intellectual property; greater encouragement of profit-sharing schemes that may benefit workers and give them a stake in wealth accumulation; strengthening of collective bargaining arrangements; improvements in corporate governance; strengthening of financial regulation to eliminate subsidies to financial activity; easing of land-use restrictions that may cause estates to keep rising in value; better training for young people and retraining for displaced workers; and increased public and private investment in infrastructure development, such as energy production and transportation.<ref name=\"summers\"/><ref name=NYT-2014-12-15/><ref name=\"inequalityPuzzle\"/><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/dont-fear-the-robots-taking-your-job-blame-the-monopolies-behind-them|title=Don't Fear the Robots Taking Your Job, Fear the Monopolies Behind Them|last=Turk|first=Victoria|date=2014-06-19|magazine=Vice.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Spence]] has advised that responding to the future impact of technology will require a detailed understanding of the global forces and flows technology has set in motion. Adapting to them \"will require shifts in mindsets, policies, investments (especially in human capital), and quite possibly models of employment and distribution\".<ref group=\"note\">Spence also wrote that \"Now comes a ... powerful, wave of digital technology that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks. This process of labor substitution and [[disintermediation]] has been underway for some time in service sectors \u2013 think of ATMs, online banking, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, mobile payment systems, and much more. This revolution is spreading to the production of goods, where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor.\" In his view, the vast majority of the cost of digital technologies comes at the start, in the design of hardware (e.g. sensors) and, more important, in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks. \"Once this is achieved, the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low (and declines as scale rises), and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero. With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing, the incentives to invest [in digital technologies] are compelling.\" Spence believes that, unlike prior digital technologies, which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world, the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies \"is cost reduction via the replacement of labor.\" For example, as the cost of 3D printing technology declines, it is \"easy to imagine\" that production may become \"extremely\" local and customized. Moreover, production may occur in response to actual demand, not anticipated or forecast demand. \"Meanwhile, the impact of robotics ... is not confined to production. Though self-driving cars and drones are the most attention-getting examples, the impact on logistics is no less transformative. Computers and robotic cranes that schedule and move containers around and load ships now control the Port of Singapore, one of the most efficient in the world.\" Spence believes that labor, no matter how inexpensive, will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion, with labor-intensive, process-oriented manufacturing becoming less effective, and that re-localization will appear globally. In his view, production will not disappear, but it will be less labor-intensive, and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion.</ref><ref>Michael Spence, [http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/michael-spence-describes-an-era-in-which-developing-countries-can-no-longer-rely-on-vast-numbers-of-cheap-workers Labor\u2019s Digital Displacement] (2014-05-22), ''[[Project Syndicate]]''</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* [[Autonomous car]]\n* [[Disruptive innovation]]\n* [[Emerging technologies]]\n* [[Futures studies]]\n* ''[[Humans Need Not Apply]]''\n* [[Industrial society]]\n* ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]''\n* [[Post-work society]]\n* [[Robot tax]]\n* [[Technological revolution]]\n* [[Technological transitions]]\n* [[Technophobia]]\n* ''[[The Future of Work and Death]]''\n* [[The Triple Revolution]]\n* [[Working time]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n*{{citation |ref=harv |title=Some evidences of technological unemployment in ancient Athens and Rome |first= John Douglas |last= Forbes |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=1932 |oclc=654841233 }}\n*{{citation |ref=harv |title=American and British Technology in the Nineteenth Century: The Search for Labour Saving Inventions|first=  H.J. |last=Habakkuk| authorlink=Sir John Habakkuk|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1967 |isbn=978-0521094474 }}\n*{{citation |ref=harv |title=History of Economic Analysis (new edititon) |first=Joseph |last= Schumpeter|authorlink=Joseph Schumpeter|publisher=Routledge|year=1987 |isbn=978-0415108881 }}\n*{{citation |ref=harv |title=Studies in Ancient Technology Vol 2 |first=Robert |last=Forbes |author-link=Robert Jacobus Forbes |publisher=Brill |year=1993 |isbn=978-9004006225 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/studiesinancient0000forb }}\n* {{Noble1984}}\n* {{Citation | last = Noble | first = David F. | author-link = David F.

It is a key type of [[structural unemployment]].\n\nTechnological change typically includes the introduction of labour-saving \"mechanical-muscle\" machines or more efficient \"mechanical-mind\" processes ([[automation]]). Just as horses employed as prime movers were gradually made obsolete by the automobile, humans' jobs have also been affected throughout [[modern history]]. Historical examples include [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|artisan weavers]] reduced to poverty after the introduction of [[Power loom|mechanized looms]]. During [[World War II]], [[Alan Turing]]'s [[Bombe]] machine compressed and decoded thousands of man-years worth of encrypted data in a matter of hours. A contemporary example of technological unemployment is the displacement of retail cashiers by [[Self-checkout|self-service tills]].\n\nThat technological change can cause short-term job losses is widely accepted. The view that it can lead to lasting increases in unemployment has long been controversial. Participants in the technological unemployment debates can be broadly divided into optimists and pessimists. ''Optimists'' agree that innovation may be disruptive to jobs in the short term, yet hold that various compensation effects ensure there is never a long-term negative impact on jobs,  whereas ''pessimists'' contend that at least in some circumstances, new technologies can lead to a lasting decline in the total number of workers in employment. The phrase \"technological unemployment\" was popularised by [[John Maynard Keynes]] in the 1930s, who said it was a \"only a temporary phase of maladjustment\".<ref>''[https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/1930/our-grandchildren.htm The Economic Possibilities of our Grandchildren]'' (1930). E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3044448 SSRN, part 2(2)]</ref> Yet the issue of machines displacing human labour has been discussed since at least [[Aristotle]]'s time.\n\nPrior to the 18th century both the elite and [[common people]] would generally take the pessimistic view on technological unemployment, at least in cases where the issue arose. Due to generally low unemployment in much of pre-modern history, the topic was rarely a prominent concern.  In the 18th century fears over the impact of machinery on jobs intensified with the growth of mass unemployment, especially in Great Britain which was then at the forefront of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Yet some economic thinkers began to argue against these fears, claiming that overall innovation would not have negative effects on jobs. These arguments were formalised in the early 19th century by the [[classical economists]]. During the second half of the 19th century, it became increasingly apparent that technological progress was benefiting all sections of society, including the working class. Concerns over the negative impact of innovation diminished. The term \"[[Luddite]] fallacy\" was coined to describe the thinking that innovation would have lasting harmful effects on employment.\n\nThe view that technology is unlikely to lead to long term unemployment has been repeatedly challenged by a minority of economists. In the early 1800s these included [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]] himself. There were dozens of economists warning about technological unemployment during brief intensifications of the debate that spiked in the 1930s and 1960s. Especially in Europe, there were further warnings in the closing two decades of the twentieth century, as commentators noted an enduring rise in unemployment suffered by many industrialised nations since the 1970s. Yet a clear majority of both professional economists and the interested general public held the optimistic view through most of the 20th century.\n\nIn the second decade of the 21st century,  a number of studies have been released suggesting that technological unemployment may be increasing worldwide.

Similarly, there is no dispute that innovation sometimes has positive effects on workers. Disagreement focuses on whether it is possible for innovation to have a lasting negative impact on overall employment. Levels of persistent unemployment can be quantified empirically, but the causes are subject to debate. Optimists accept short term unemployment may be caused by innovation, yet claim that after a while, ''compensation effects'' will always create at least as many jobs as were originally destroyed.  While this optimistic view has been continually challenged, it was dominant among mainstream economists for most of the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref name=\"Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 77 - 90\">{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 77\u201390}}</ref><ref name = \"sympathy\"/> For example, labor economists [[Jacob Mincer]] and Stephan Danninger develop an empirical study using micro-data from the [[Panel Study of Income Dynamics]], and find that although in the short run, technological progress seems to have unclear effects on aggregate unemployment, it reduces unemployment in the long run. When they include a 5-year lag, however, the evidence supporting a short-run employment effect of technology seems to disappear as well, suggesting that technological unemployment \"appears to be a myth\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mincer|first=Jacob|last2=Danninger|first2=Stephan|date=July 2000|title=Technology, Unemployment, and Inflation|journal=National Bureau of Economic Research|volume=|pages=|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w7817.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of [[structural unemployment]], a lasting level of joblessness that does not disappear even at the high point of the [[business cycle]], became popular in the 1960s. For pessimists, technological unemployment is one of the factors driving the wider phenomena of structural unemployment. Since the 1980s, even optimistic economists have increasingly accepted that structural unemployment has indeed risen in advanced economies (ref missing), but they have tended to blame this on [[globalisation]] and [[offshoring]] rather than technological change. Others claim a chief cause of the lasting increase in unemployment has been the reluctance of governments to pursue [[Expansionary Fiscal Policy|expansionary policies]] since the [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displacement of Keynesianism]] that occurred in the 1970s and early 80s.<ref name=\"Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 77 - 90\"/><ref name=\"Effective Demand\"/><ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\"/> In the 21st century, and especially since 2013, pessimists have been arguing with increasing frequency that lasting worldwide technological unemployment is a growing threat.<ref name = \"sympathy\"/><ref name = \"replicants\"/><ref name=\"Martin\"/><ref>On the other hand, from a more positive perspective, some have argued that technological change will alter the structure of an organization in the sense that those in management roles will increasingly become more specialized to those roles as technology that assists collaboration and workflow management allows employees to manage themselves. The typical management role will, as a result, change to allow managers to concentrate on the task of supporting employees and improving their performance thus allowing them to add more, rather than less, value.</ref>\n\n===Compensation effects===\n[[File:BrownManchesterMuralJohnKay.jpg|thumb|''John Kay inventor of the Fly Shuttle AD 1753'', by [[Ford Madox Brown]], depicting the inventor [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] kissing his wife goodbye as men carry him away from his home to escape a mob angry about his labour-saving mechanical loom. Compensation effects were not widely understood at this time. ]]\nCompensation effects are labour-friendly consequences of innovation which \"compensate\" workers for job losses initially caused by new technology. In the 1820s, several compensation effects were described by [[Jean-Baptiste Say|Say]] in response to Ricardo's statement that long term technological unemployment could occur. Soon after, a whole system of effects was developed by [[John Ramsay McCulloch|Ramsey McCulloch]].  The system was labelled \"compensation theory\" by [[Karl Marx|Marx]], who proceeded to attack the ideas, arguing that none of the effects were guaranteed to operate.  Disagreement over the effectiveness of compensation effects has remained a central part of academic debates on technological unemployment ever since.<ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\"/><ref name=\"Blaug 1997 loc= p182\">{{Harvnb|Blaug|1997|loc= p182}}</ref>\n\nCompensation effects include: \n# By new machines. (The labour needed to build the new equipment that applied innovation requires.)\n# By new investments. (Enabled by the cost savings and therefore increased profits from the new technology.)\n#  By changes in wages. (In cases where unemployment does occur, this can cause a lowering of wages, thus allowing more workers to be re-employed at the now lower cost.  On the other hand, sometimes workers will enjoy wage increases as their profitability rises. This leads to increased income and therefore increased spending, which in turn encourages job creation.)\n# By lower prices.  (Which then lead to more demand, and therefore more employment.) Lower prices can also help offset wage cuts, as cheaper goods will increase workers' buying power.\n# By new products. (Where innovation directly creates new jobs.)\n\nThe \"by new machines\" effect is now rarely discussed by economists; it is often accepted that Marx successfully refuted it.<ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\"/> Even pessimists often concede that product innovation associated with the \"by new products\" effect can sometimes have a positive effect on employment. An important distinction can be drawn between 'process'  and 'product' innovations.<ref group=\"note\">Labour-displacing technologies can be classified under the headings of [[mechanization]], [[automation]], and process improvement. The first two fundamentally involve transferring tasks from humans to machines. The third often involves the elimination of tasks altogether. The common theme of all three is that tasks are removed from the workforce, decreasing employment. In practice, the categories often overlap: a process improvement can include an automating or mechanizing achievement. The line between mechanization and automation is also subjective, as sometimes mechanization can involve sufficient [[control theory|control]] to be viewed as part of automation.</ref> Evidence from Latin America seems to suggest that product innovation significantly contributes to the employment growth at the firm level, more so than process innovation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crespi|first=Gustavo|last2=Tacsir|first2=Ezequiel|date=December 2012|title=Effects of Innovation on Employment in Latin America|url=|journal=Inter-American Development Bank|volume=|pages=}}</ref> The extent to which the other effects are successful in compensating the workforce for job losses has been extensively debated throughout the history of modern economics; the issue is still not resolved.<ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://ftp.iza.org/dp6291.pdf\n|title= Innovation, Employment and Skills in Advanced and Developing Countries: A Survey of the Literature\n|publisher= [[Institute for the Study of Labor]]\n|last= Vivarelli\n|first= Marco\n|date = January 2012\n|accessdate=14 July 2015}}\n</ref><ref name = \"Vivarelli2007\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://ftp.iza.org/dp2621.pdf\n|title= Innovation and Employment: : A Survey\n|publisher= [[Institute for the Study of Labor]]\n|last= Vivarelli\n|first= Marco\n|date = February 2007\n|accessdate=14 July 2015}}\n</ref> One such effect that potentially complements the compensation effect is job [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]]. According to research developed by Enrico Moretti, with each additional skilled job created in high tech industries in a given city, more than two jobs are created in the non-tradable sector.

Koopmans Research Institute|volume=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nMany economists now pessimistic about technological unemployment accept that compensation effects did largely operate as the optimists claimed through most of the 19th and 20th century. Yet they hold that the advent of computerisation means that compensation effects are now less effective. An early example of this argument was made by [[Wassily Leontief]] in 1983. He conceded that after some disruption, the advance of [[mechanization]] during the Industrial Revolution actually increased the demand for labour as well as increasing pay due to effects that flow from increased [[productivity]]. While early machines lowered the demand for muscle power, they were unintelligent and needed large armies of human operators to remain productive. Yet since the introduction of computers into the workplace, there is now less need not just for muscle power but also for human brain power. Hence even as productivity continues to rise, the lower demand for human labour may mean less pay and employment.<ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\"/><ref name=\"Martin\"/><ref name = \"Advance\"/> However, this argument is not fully supported by more recent empirical studies. One research done by [[Erik Brynjolfsson]] and [[Lorin Hitt|Lorin M. Hitt]] in 2003 presents direct evidence that suggests a positive short-term effect of computerization on firm-level measured productivity and output growth. In addition, they find the long-term productivity contribution of computerization and technological changes might even be greater.\n\n===The Luddite fallacy===\n{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=If the Luddite fallacy were true we would all be out of work because productivity has been increasing for two centuries.|source=[[Alex Tabarrok]]<ref name=\"Tabarrok\">{{cite web |url=http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2003/12/productivity_an.html |title=Productivity and unemployment |accessdate=2007-03-11 |last=Tabarrok |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex Tabarrok |date=2003-12-31 |work=Marginal Revolution}}</ref>|quoted=1}}\nThe term \"Luddite fallacy\" is sometimes used to express the view that those concerned about long term  technological unemployment are committing a fallacy, as they fail to account for compensation effects. People who use the term typically expect that technological progress will have no long-term impact on employment levels, and eventually will raise wages for all workers, because progress helps to increase the overall wealth of society. The term is based on the early 19th century example of the [[Luddite]]s. During the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, the dominant view among economists has been that belief in long term technological unemployment was indeed a [[fallacy]]. More recently, there has been increased support for the view that the benefits of automation are not equally distributed.<ref name = \"sympathy\">\n{{cite news\n|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/opinion/krugman-sympathy-for-the-luddites.html?_r=0\n|title= Sympathy for the Luddites\n|work= New York Times\n|last= Krugman\n|first= Paul\n|date = 2013-06-12\n|accessdate=14 July 2015|author-link= Paul Krugman\n}}\n</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Ford|2009|loc= Chpt 3, 'The Luddite Fallacy'}}</ref><ref name = \"Death\">{{cite web\n  |url= http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/robert-skidelsky-revisits-the-luddites--claim-that-automation-depresses-real-wages\n  |title= Death to Machines?\n  |publisher= [[Project Syndicate]]\n  |author= Lord Skidelsky\n |date = 2013-06-12\n|accessdate=14 July 2015|author-link= Robert Skidelsky, Baron Skidelsky\n }}\n</ref>\n\nThere are two underlying premises for why long-term difficulty could develop. The one that has traditionally been deployed is that ascribed to the Luddites (whether or not it is a truly accurate summary of their thinking), which is that there is a finite amount of work available and if machines do that work, there can be no other work left for humans to do. Economists call this the [[lump of labour fallacy]], arguing that in reality no such limitation exists. However, the other premise is that it is possible for long-term difficulty to arise that has nothing to do with any lump of labour. In this view, the amount of work that can exist is infinite, but (1) machines can do most of the \"easy\" work, (2) the definition of what is \"easy\" expands as information technology progresses, and (3) the work that lies beyond \"easy\" (the work that requires more skill, talent, knowledge, and insightful connections between pieces of knowledge) may require greater cognitive faculties than most humans are able to supply, as point 2 continually advances. This latter view is the one supported by many modern advocates of the possibility of long-term, systemic technological unemployment.\n\n===Skill levels and technological unemployment===\nA common view among those discussing the effect of innovation on the labour market has been that it mainly hurts those with low skills, while often benefiting  skilled workers. According to scholars such as [[Lawrence F. Katz]], this may have been true for much of the twentieth century, yet in the 19th century, innovations in the workplace largely displaced costly skilled artisans, and generally benefited the low skilled.  While 21st century innovation has been replacing some unskilled work, other low skilled occupations remain resistant to automation, while white collar work requiring intermediate skills is increasingly being performed by autonomous computer programs.<ref name = \"relative\">{{cite book |chapter=Technical Change and the Relative Demand for Skilled Labor: The United States in Historical Perspective |first=Lawrence F. |last=Katz |first2=Robert A. |last2=Margo |title=Human Capital in History: The American Record |editor-last=Boustan |editor2-last=Frydman |editor3-last=Margo |year=2014 |doi=10.3386/w18752 }}</ref><ref name = \"polarization\">\n{{cite journal\n|author1=David H.

Most existing firm-level research has found a labor-friendly nature of technological innovations. For example, German economists Stefan Lachenmaier and Horst Rottmann find that both product and process innovation have a positive effect on employment. They also find that process innovation has a more significant job creation effect than product innovation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lachenmaier|first=Stefan|last2=Rottmann|first2=Horst|title=May 2010|url=|journal=International Journal of Industrial Organization|volume=29|issue=2|pages=210\u2013220|doi=10.1016/j.ijindorg.2010.05.004|year=2011|citeseerx=10.1.1.522.7577}}</ref> This result is supported by evidence in the United States as well, which shows that manufacturing firm innovations have a positive effect on the total number of jobs, not just limited to firm-specific behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coad|first=Alex|last2=Rao|first2=Rekha|date=May 2011|title=The firm-level employment effects of innovations in high-tech US manufacturing industries|url=|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics|volume=21|issue=2|pages=255\u2013283|doi=10.1007/s00191-010-0209-x}}</ref>\n\nAt the industry level, however, researchers have found mixed results with regard to the employment effect of technological changes. A 2017 study on manufacturing and service sectors in 11 European countries suggests that positive employment effects of technological innovations only exist in the medium- and high-tech sectors. There also seems to be a negative correlation between employment and capital formation, which suggests that technological progress could potentially be labor-saving given that process innovation is often incorporated in investment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Piva|first=Mariacristina|last2=Vivarelli|first2=Marco|date=January 2017|title=Technological Change and Employment: Were Ricardo and Marx Right?|url=|journal=Institute of Labor Economics|volume=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nLimited macroeconomic analysis has been done to study the relationship between technological shocks and unemployment. The small amount of existing research, however, suggests mixed results. Italian economist Marco Vivarelli finds that the labor-saving effect of process innovation seems to have affected the Italian economy more negatively than the United States. On the other hand, the job creating effect of product innovation could only be observed in the United States, not Italy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Economics of Technology and Employment Theory and Empirical Evidence|last=Vivarelli|first=Marco|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=1995|isbn=978-1-85898-166-6|location=Italy}}</ref> Another study in 2013 finds a more transitory, rather than permanent, unemployment effect of technological change.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feldmann|first=Horst|date=November 2013|title=Technological unemployment in industrial countries|url=|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics|volume=23|issue=5|pages=1099\u20131126|doi=10.1007/s00191-013-0308-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Measures of technological innovation ===\nThere have been four main approaches that attempt to capture and document technological innovation quantitatively.

Ramey in 2005, is to use long-run restrictions in a Vector Autoregression (VAR) to identify technological shocks, assuming that only technology affects long-run productivity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gali|first=Jordi|date=1999|title=Technology, Employment, and the Business Cycle: Do Technology Shocks Explain Aggregate Fluctuations?|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/697e5bf9da0ea3193c2dc64460286bab36dd4b47|journal=American Economic Review|volume=89|issue=1|pages=249\u2013271|doi=10.1257/aer.89.1.249}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Francis|first=Neville|last2=Ramey|first2=Valerie|date=2005|title=Is the Technology-Driven Real Business Cycle Hypothesis Dead?

It would assuredly bring them to ruin by depriving them of employment, thus making them beggars.\"  ]]\nIn Great Britain, the ruling elite began to take a less restrictive approach to innovation somewhat earlier than in much of continental Europe, which has been cited as a possible reason for Britain's early lead in driving the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>E.g by [[Sir John Habakkuk]] in ''American and British Technology in the Nineteenth Century'' (1962), [[Cambridge University Press]] \u2013 Habakkuk also went on to say that due to labour shortages, compared with their British counterparts there was far less resistance from U.S. workers  to the introduction of technology, leading to more update of innovation, and hence to the more efficient [[American system of manufacturing]]</ref>  Yet concern over the impact of innovation on employment remained strong through the 16th and early 17th century. A famous example of new technology being refused occurred when the inventor [[William Lee (inventor)|William Lee]] invited Queen Elizabeth I to view a labour saving knitting machine. The Queen declined to issue a patent on the grounds that the technology might cause unemployment among textile workers. After moving to France and also failing to achieve success in promoting his invention, Lee returned to England but was again refused by Elizabeth's successor [[James VI and I|James I]] for the same reason.<ref name=\"Martin\"/>\n\nEspecially after the [[Glorious Revolution]], authorities became less sympathetic to workers concerns about losing their jobs due to innovation. An increasingly influential strand of [[Mercantilism|Mercantilist]] thought held that introducing labour saving technology would actually reduce unemployment, as it would allow British firms to increase their market share against foreign competition.  From the early 18th century workers could no longer rely on support from the authorities against the perceived threat of technological unemployment. They would sometimes take [[direct action]], such as machine breaking, in attempts to protect themselves from disruptive innovation. [[Schumpeter]] notes that as the 18th century progressed, thinkers would raise the alarm about technological unemployment with increasing frequency, with [[Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi|von Justi]] being a prominent example.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schumpeter|1987|loc= Chpt 4}}</ref> Yet Schumpeter also notes that the prevailing view among the elite solidified on the position that technological unemployment would not be a long-term problem.<ref name=\"Martin\"/><ref name=\"Schumpeter 1987 loc= Chpt 6\"/>\n\n===19th century===\nIt was only in the 19th century that debates over technological unemployment became intense, especially in Great Britain where many economic thinkers of the time were concentrated. Building on the work of [[Josiah Tucker|Dean Tucker]] and [[Adam Smith]], [[Political economy|political economists]] began to create what would become the modern discipline of [[economics]].<ref group=\"note\">Smith did not directly address the problem of technological unemployment, but the Dean had, saying in 1757 that in the long term, the introduction of machinery would allow more employment than would have been possible without them.</ref> While rejecting much of mercantilism, members of the new discipline largely agreed that technological unemployment would not be an enduring problem.  In the first few decades of the 19th century, several prominent political economists did, however, argue against the optimistic view, claiming that innovation could cause long-term unemployment. These included [[Jean Charles L\u00e9onard de Sismondi|Sismondi]],<ref name=\"Sowell_2006\">{{Citation |last=Sowell |first=T. |year=2006 |title=Chapter 5: Sismondi: A Neglected Pioneer |work=On Classical Economics}}</ref> [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus]], [[John Stuart Mill|J S Mill]], and from 1821, Ricardo himself.<ref>While initially of the view that innovation benefited the whole population,  Ricardo was persuaded by Malthus that technology could both push down wages for the working class, and cause long-term unemployment. He famously expressed these views in a chapter called  \"on Machinery\",  added to the third and final (1821) edition of [[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]</ref> As arguably the most respected political economist of his age, Ricardo's view was challenging to others in the discipline. The first major economist to respond was [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], who argued that no one would introduce machinery if they were going to reduce the amount of product,<ref group=\"note\">Typically the introduction of machinery would both increase output and lower cost per unit.</ref> and that as [[Say's Law]]  states that supply creates its own demand, any displaced workers would automatically find work elsewhere once the market had had time to adjust.<ref>{{cite journal\n|url= https://www.academia.edu/3465367\n|title= Is industrial innovation destroying jobs?   \n|journal= Academia.edu (Originally Published in the Cato Journal )\n|date = 18 Jan 2014\n|accessdate= 14 July 2015\n|last1= Bartlett \n|first1= Bruce \n}}</ref>   \n[[John Ramsay McCulloch|Ramsey McCulloch]] expanded and formalised Say's optimistic views on technological unemployment, and was supported by others such as [[Charles Babbage]], [[Nassau Senior]] and many other lesser known political economists.  Towards the middle of the 19th century, [[Karl Marx]] joined the debates. Building on the work of Ricardo and Mill, Marx went much further, presenting a deeply pessimistic view of technological unemployment; his views attracted many followers and founded an enduring school of thought but mainstream economics was not dramatically changed.  By the 1870s,  at least in Great Britain, technological unemployment faded both as a popular concern and as an issue for academic debate. It had become increasingly apparent that innovation was increasing prosperity for all sections of British society, including the working class.  As the classical school of thought gave way to [[neoclassical economics]], mainstream thinking was tightened to take into account and refute the pessimistic arguments of Mill and Ricardo.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 2, 20\u201322}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:1980s computer worker, Centers for Disease Control.jpg|thumb|Critics of the view that innovation causes lasting unemployment argue that technology is used by workers and does not replace them on a large scale.]]\nFor the first two decades of the 20th century, mass unemployment was not the major problem it had been in the first half of the 19th. While the [[Marxian economics|Marxist school]] and a few other thinkers still challenged the optimistic view, technological unemployment was not a significant concern for mainstream economic thinking until the mid to late 1920s. In the 1920s mass unemployment re-emerged as a pressing issue within Europe.  At this time the U.S. was generally more prosperous, but even there urban unemployment had begun to increase from 1927. [[History of agriculture in the United States#1920s|Rural American workers had been suffering job losses]] from the start of the 1920s; many had been displaced by improved agricultural technology, such as the [[tractor]]. The centre of gravity for economic debates had by this time moved from Great Britain to the United States, and it was here that the 20th century's two great periods of debate over technological unemployment largely occurred.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 2, 8\u201312}}</ref>\n\nThe peak periods for the two debates were in the 1930s and the 1960s.  According to economic historian Gregory R Woirol, the two episodes share several similarities.<ref name=\"Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 8 - 12\">{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 8\u201312}}</ref>  In both cases academic debates were preceded by an outbreak of popular concern, sparked by recent rises in unemployment. In both cases the debates were not conclusively settled, but faded away as unemployment was reduced by an outbreak of war \u2013 World War II for the debate of the 1930s, and the [[Vietnam war]] for the 1960s episodes. In both cases, the debates were conducted within the prevailing paradigm at the time, with little reference to earlier thought. In the 1930s, optimists based their arguments largely on neo-classical beliefs in the self-correcting power of markets to automatically reduce any short-term unemployment via compensation effects. In the 1960s, faith in compensation effects was less strong, but the mainstream [[Keynesian economists]] of the time largely believed government intervention would be able to counter any persistent technological unemployment that was not cleared by market forces. Another similarity was the publication of a major Federal study towards the end of each episode, which broadly found that long-term technological unemployment was not occurring (though the studies did agree innovation was a major factor in the short term displacement of workers, and advised government action to provide assistance).<ref group=\"note\">In the 1930s, this study was \n''Unemployment and technological change''(Report no. G-70, 1940)  by Corrington Calhoun Gill  of the 'National Research Project on Reemployment Opportunities and Recent changes in Industrial Techniques'. Some earlier Federal reports took a pessimistic view of technological unemployment, e.g.  ''Memorandum on Technological Unemployment'' (1933) by Ewan Clague  Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Some authorities \u2013 e.g.   Udo Sautter in Chpt 5 of ''Three Cheers for the Unemployed: Government and Unemployment Before the New Deal'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991) \u2013 say that in the early 1930s there was near consensus among US experts that technological unemployment was a major problem.  Other's though like [[Bruce Bartlett]] in [https://www.academia.edu/3465367/Is_Industrial_Innovation_Destroying_Jobs  Is Industrial Innovation Destroying Jobs (Cato Journal 1984)] argue that most economists remained optimistic even during the 1930s.  In the 1960s episode, the major Federal study that bookmarked the end of the period of intense debate was ''Technology and the American economy'' (1966) by the 'National Commission on Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress' [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=26449  established by president Lyndon Jonhson in 1964]</ref><ref name=\"Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 8 - 12\"/>\n\nAs the [[golden age of capitalism]] came to a close in the 1970s, unemployment once again rose, and this time generally remained relatively high for the rest of the century, across most advanced economies.  Several economists once again argued that this may be due to innovation, with perhaps the most prominent being  [[Paul Samuelson]].<ref>{{cite journal \n|url= https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/scandj/v91y1989i1p47-62.html\n|title=Ricardo Was Right!\n|journal= [[The Scandinavian Journal of Economics]] \n|volume=91 \n|issue= 1 \n|pages= 47\u201362 \n|first= Paul |last=Samuelson|date=1989\n|doi=10.2307/3440162|jstor=3440162\n}}</ref> Overall, the closing decades of the 20th century saw most concern expressed over technological unemployment in Europe, though there were several examples in the U.S.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 143\u2013144}}</ref>  A number of popular works warning of technological unemployment were also published.

Often, the practical solution is to find another job, but usually workers do not have the qualifications for high-level jobs and must drop to low-level jobs.

Since the development of modern economics, however, this option has generally not even been considered as a solution, at least not for the advanced economies. Even commentators who are pessimistic about long-term technological unemployment invariably consider innovation to be an overall benefit to society, with JS Mill being perhaps the only prominent western political economist to have suggested prohibiting the use of technology as a possible solution to unemployment.<ref name=\"Blaug 1997 loc= p182\"/>\n\n[[Gandhian economics]] called for a delay in the uptake of labour saving machines until unemployment was alleviated, however this advice was largely rejected by [[Nehru]] who was to become prime minister once India achieved its independence. The policy of slowing the introduction of innovation so as to avoid technological unemployment was however implemented in the 20th century within China under  [[Mao]]'s administration.<ref>\n{{cite book \n|author = B.

Just prior to World War II working hours had fallen to about 42 per week, and the fall was similar in other advanced economies. According to [[Wassily Leontief]], this was a voluntary increase in technological unemployment. The reduction in working hours helped share out available work, and was favoured by workers who were happy to reduce hours to gain extra leisure, as innovation was at the time generally helping to increase their rates of pay.<ref name = \"Advance\">\n{{cite journal\n|last=Leontief\n|first=Wassily\n|date= September 1983\n|title=Technological Advance, Economic Growth, and the Distribution of Income \n|journal=[[Population and Development Review]]\n|jstor=1973315 \n|doi= 10.2307/1973315\n|volume= 9 |issue= 3\n|pages= 403\u2013410\n|author-link= Wassily Leontief\n}}\n</ref>\n\nFurther reductions in working hours have been proposed as a possible solution to unemployment by economists including [[John R.

Yet once working hours have reached about 40 hours per week, workers have been less enthusiastic about further reductions, both to prevent loss of income and as many value [[workmanship|engaging in work for its own sake]].

Welfare programmes have historically tended to be more durable once established, compared with other solutions to unemployment such as directly creating jobs with public works.  Despite being the first person to create a formal system describing  compensation effects, Ramsey McCulloch and most other classical economists advocated government aid for those suffering from technological unemployment, as they understood that market adjustment to new technology was not instantaneous and that those displaced by labour-saving technology would not always be able to immediately obtain alternative employment through their own efforts.<ref name=\"Blaug 1997 loc= p182\"/>\n\n=====Basic income=====\n{{Main|Basic income|Guaranteed minimum income}}\nSeveral commentators have argued that traditional forms of welfare payment may be inadequate as a response to the future challenges posed by technological unemployment, and have suggested a [[basic income]] as an alternative.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004|title = Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

For example, while the best-known proposed forms (with taxation and distribution) are usually thought of as left-leaning ideas that right-leaning people try to defend against, other forms have been proposed even by [[libertarianism|libertarians]], such as [[Friedrich Hayek|von Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman|Friedman]]. Republican president [[Nixon]]'s Family Assistance Plan (FAP) of 1969, which had much in common with basic income, passed in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] but was defeated in the [[United States Senate|Senate]].<ref name=\"Nixon1978\">{{cite book | last = Nixon | first = Richard | year = 1978 | title = RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon | publisher = Grosset & Dunlap | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-448-14374-3 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/rnmemoirsofricha00nixo }}</ref>\n\nOne objection to basic income is that it could be a [[incentivisation|disincentive to work]], but evidence from older [[Basic income pilots|pilots]] in India, Africa, and Canada indicates that this does not happen and that a basic income encourages low-level [[entrepreneurship]] and more productive, collaborative work. Another objection is that funding it sustainably is a huge challenge. While new revenue-raising ideas have been proposed such as Martin Ford's wage recapture tax, how to fund a generous basic income remains a debated question, and skeptics have dismissed it as utopian. Even from a progressive viewpoint, there are concerns that a basic income set too low may not help the economically vulnerable, especially if financed largely from cuts to other forms of welfare.<ref name=\"paypressure\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Ford|2009|loc= pp.162-168}}.</ref><ref name = \"MITRotman\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/538401/who-will-own-the-robots/\n|title= Who Will Own the Robots?\n|publisher= [[MIT]]\n|last= Rotman \n|first= David \n|date = 16 June 2015\n|accessdate=14 July 2015}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite magazine\n|url= https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/something-for-everyone-0000546-v22n1\n|title= Why the Tech Elite Is Getting Behind Universal Basic Income\n|magazine= [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]\n|last= Schneider\n|first= Nathan\n|date = January 2015\n|accessdate=14 July 2015|author-link= Nathan Schneider\n}}\n</ref>\n\nTo better address both the funding concerns and concerns about government control, one alternative model is that the cost and control would be distributed across the private sector instead of the public sector. Companies across the economy would be required to employ humans, but the job descriptions would be left to private innovation, and individuals would have to compete to be hired and retained. This would be a for-profit sector analog of basic income, that is, a market-based form of basic income. It differs from a [[job guarantee]] in that the government is not the employer (rather, companies are) and there is no aspect of having employees who \"cannot be fired\", a problem that interferes with economic dynamism. The economic salvation in this model is not that every individual is guaranteed a job, but rather just that enough jobs exist that massive unemployment is avoided and employment is no longer solely the privilege of only the very smartest or highly trained 20% of the population. Another option for a market-based form of basic income has been proposed by the [[Center for Economic and Social Justice]] (CESJ) as part of \"a Just Third Way\" (a [[Third Way]] with greater justice) through widely distributed power and liberty. Called the Capital Homestead Act,<ref name=\"Capital_Homestead_Act\">{{Citation |publisher=[[Center for Economic and Social Justice]] |title=Capital Homestead Act Summary |url=http://www.cesj.org/learn/capital-homesteading/capital-homestead-act-summary/ }}</ref> it is reminiscent of [[James S.

He advised vigorous cooperative efforts to address the \"myriad devices\" \u2013 such as tax havens, bank secrecy, money laundering, and regulatory arbitrage \u2013 which enable the holders of great wealth to avoid paying taxes, and to make it more difficult to accumulate great fortunes without requiring \"great social contributions\" in return. Summers suggested more vigorous enforcement of anti-monopoly laws; reductions in \"excessive\" protection for intellectual property; greater encouragement of profit-sharing schemes that may benefit workers and give them a stake in wealth accumulation; strengthening of collective bargaining arrangements; improvements in corporate governance; strengthening of financial regulation to eliminate subsidies to financial activity; easing of land-use restrictions that may cause estates to keep rising in value; better training for young people and retraining for displaced workers; and increased public and private investment in infrastructure development, such as energy production and transportation.<ref name=\"summers\"/><ref name=NYT-2014-12-15/><ref name=\"inequalityPuzzle\"/><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/dont-fear-the-robots-taking-your-job-blame-the-monopolies-behind-them|title=Don't Fear the Robots Taking Your Job, Fear the Monopolies Behind Them|last=Turk|first=Victoria|date=2014-06-19|magazine=Vice.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Spence]] has advised that responding to the future impact of technology will require a detailed understanding of the global forces and flows technology has set in motion. Adapting to them \"will require shifts in mindsets, policies, investments (especially in human capital), and quite possibly models of employment and distribution\".<ref group=\"note\">Spence also wrote that \"Now comes a ... powerful, wave of digital technology that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks. This process of labor substitution and [[disintermediation]] has been underway for some time in service sectors \u2013 think of ATMs, online banking, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, mobile payment systems, and much more. This revolution is spreading to the production of goods, where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor.\" In his view, the vast majority of the cost of digital technologies comes at the start, in the design of hardware (e.g. sensors) and, more important, in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks. \"Once this is achieved, the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low (and declines as scale rises), and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero. With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing, the incentives to invest [in digital technologies] are compelling.\" Spence believes that, unlike prior digital technologies, which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world, the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies \"is cost reduction via the replacement of labor.\" For example, as the cost of 3D printing technology declines, it is \"easy to imagine\" that production may become \"extremely\" local and customized. Moreover, production may occur in response to actual demand, not anticipated or forecast demand. \"Meanwhile, the impact of robotics ... is not confined to production. Though self-driving cars and drones are the most attention-getting examples, the impact on logistics is no less transformative. Computers and robotic cranes that schedule and move containers around and load ships now control the Port of Singapore, one of the most efficient in the world.\" Spence believes that labor, no matter how inexpensive, will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion, with labor-intensive, process-oriented manufacturing becoming less effective, and that re-localization will appear globally. In his view, production will not disappear, but it will be less labor-intensive, and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion.</ref><ref>Michael Spence, [http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/michael-spence-describes-an-era-in-which-developing-countries-can-no-longer-rely-on-vast-numbers-of-cheap-workers Labor\u2019s Digital Displacement] (2014-05-22), ''[[Project Syndicate]]''</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* [[Autonomous car]]\n* [[Disruptive innovation]]\n* [[Emerging technologies]]\n* [[Futures studies]]\n* ''[[Humans Need Not Apply]]''\n* [[Industrial society]]\n* ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]''\n* [[Post-work society]]\n* [[Robot tax]]\n* [[Technological revolution]]\n* [[Technological transitions]]\n* [[Technophobia]]\n* ''[[The Future of Work and Death]]''\n* [[The Triple Revolution]]\n* [[Working time]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n*{{citation |ref=harv |title=Some evidences of technological unemployment in ancient Athens and Rome |first= John Douglas |last= Forbes |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=1932 |oclc=654841233 }}\n*{{citation |ref=harv |title=American and British Technology in the Nineteenth Century: The Search for Labour Saving Inventions|first=  H.J. |last=Habakkuk| authorlink=Sir John Habakkuk|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1967 |isbn=978-0521094474 }}\n*{{citation |ref=harv |title=History of Economic Analysis (new edititon) |first=Joseph |last= Schumpeter|authorlink=Joseph Schumpeter|publisher=Routledge|year=1987 |isbn=978-0415108881 }}\n*{{citation |ref=harv |title=Studies in Ancient Technology Vol 2 |first=Robert |last=Forbes |author-link=Robert Jacobus Forbes |publisher=Brill |year=1993 |isbn=978-9004006225 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/studiesinancient0000forb }}\n* {{Noble1984}}\n* {{Citation | last = Noble | first = David F. | author-link = David F.

The song was written to poke fun at the fact that many people had a hard time understanding Nirvana singer [[Kurt Cobain]]'s lyrics in the original song. After being unable to contact Nirvana by conventional means, Yankovic called Cobain while the band was on the set of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where Cobain quickly gave permission to record the parody.\n\nRecording the song was a change for Yankovic and his band. Usually, the group were forced to record several overdubs. \"Smells Like Nirvana\", however, was relatively straightforward in its musical composition. To promote the single, Yankovic created an associated video for the song that parodied the \"Smells like Teen Spirit\" video. The parody video closely mirrored the original; Yankovic even went so far as to hire several of the same actors and use the same set.\n\n\"Smells Like Nirvana\" was met with critical praise and helped to re-energize Yankovic's career. Cobain considered the parody as a sign that they had \"made it\" as a band. The song is one of Yankovic's most successful singles and was his second top 40 hit in the United States, reaching number 35 on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and the U.S. [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]]. The song's video was nominated for a 1992 [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video]].\n\n==Background==\nPrior to writing \"Smells Like Nirvana\", Yankovic's music career had suffered from the poor financial performance of his 1989 feature film, ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' and [[UHF \u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff|the associated soundtrack]]. Yankovic called that \"the beginning of three years where it was kind of hard for me to recover\".<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> He started work on a new studio album around 1990.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> To revitalize his career, he considered creating a parody of a [[Michael Jackson]] song, which had proven successful twice before with \"[[Eat It]]\" and \"[[Fat (song)|Fat]]\". He had composed a parody of Jackson's \"[[Black or White]]\", titled \"Snack All Night\", but Jackson said he was uncomfortable with the parody, given that the original song was intended to be a political statement. Yankovic would later believe that Jackson's refusal was, in retrospect, a blessing; he felt that \"Snack All Night\" was not one of his better works.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> While he had compiled other original songs for a new album he feared the lack of a good parody song would doom the album to failure and held off from releasing anything until an idea presented itself.<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nThe band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] started to become a name in the music scene at the time, creating \"big, seismic shifts in pop culture\" according to Yankovic.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> Yankovic felt that the band's 1991 album ''[[Nevermind]]'', which featured \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", was \"really great\", but feared that at its release the band was not popular enough to warrant a parody.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> By early 1992, ''Nevermind'' had reached platinum certification and led the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]], which led Yankovic to start working on a parody.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> Yankovic noted that much of the publicity around ''Nevermind'' dealt with the inability to comprehend the songs' lyrics, both in their phrasing and the manner in which they were sung by the lead vocalist Kurt Cobain. Yankovic decided to use this as the basis for his parody. Yankovic noted, \"I try not to go the obvious route all the time, but sometimes the most obvious is actually the best.\"<ref name=\"esq interview\"/> Yankovic had initial difficulty getting permission for the parody, as his manager claimed he was unable to get through to the group numerous times.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> When Yankovic learned that Nirvana would be performing on the January 11, 1992 show of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', he called his ''UHF'' co-star, [[Victoria Jackson]], at the time a regular cast member of the show. Jackson managed to give the phone to Cobain so that Yankovic could make his request. Cobain agreed, though initially he inquired if the song would be about food, a common theme in many of Yankovic's songs.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/><ref name=\"booklet\">{{cite AV media notes| title = Permanent Record: Al in the Box| titlelink = Permanent Record: Al in the Box| others = [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]| year = 1994| first = Barret| last = Hansen| authorlink = Dr. Demento| type = liner| publisher = [[Scotti Brothers Records]]| location = [[California]], [[United States|USA]]}}</ref> Yankovic explained that the song would be about Cobain's incomprehensible lyrics, to which Cobain replied, according to Yankovic, \"Oh, sure, of course, that's funny.\"<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/>\n\n==Recording and lyrics==\n{| style=\"font-size:80%\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" color=\"black\" width=130px\n| {{Listen|filename=Smells Like Nirvana (Sample).ogg|title=\"Smells LIke Nirvana\" (sample)|description=\"Smells Like Nirvana\", from Yankovic's 1992 album ''Off the Deep End''.

All three wear clothing and long-haired wigs to imitate the look of Nirvana in \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". Yankovic's video uses many of the same props, actors and camera angles; in particular, the video was shot in the same [[Culver City, California]] sound stage as Nirvana's video, several of the cheerleaders and audience members were from the original video, and [[Tony De La Rosa]] reprises his role as the janitor.<ref name=\"chosen rejects\">St. Thomas, p. 104</ref><ref>George-Warren et al., p. 1092</ref> Levey stated that they were able to recreate much of the same setting with help of the producers of the original Nirvana video once they were aware that the song had Cobain's blessing.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> Yankovic had a brief conversation with [[Samuel Bayer]], the original director of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" in preparation for the video shoot.

For several months after Cobain's death, Yankovic would first perform a somber tribute to Cobain prior to playing the song itself. Shortly after Cobain's death, Yankovic was scheduled to play a show in [[Seattle]], where Nirvana first became famous. Due to this connection, Yankovic was hesitant to perform the spoof, as he worried about how the audience might react to the parody. However, Yankovic was urged by journalists to go through with the performance, as they said that the song would be \"cathartic\" for the area. Ultimately, the performance \"went over extremely well\".<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> Yankovic continues to play \"Smells Like Nirvana\" live, stating that \"Kurt was a fan of the song\" and \"he would have wanted it that way.\"<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nIn ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[That '90s Show]]\", set primarily in flashback to the 1990s, [[Homer Simpson]] is shown creating one of the first [[grunge]] bands while trying to cope with [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s infidelity; the band, called \"Sadgasm\", becomes highly popular. At one point, Homer writes a new song called \"Shave Me\"\u2014itself a loose parody of Nirvana's real single \"[[Rape Me]]\". Homer's song is then parodied as \"Brainfreeze\" in both song and video by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, who voices himself. Homer takes Yankovic's parody as a sign that his band has become successful, but his depressed state after breaking up with Marge leaves him unable to enjoy the song's humor; he gloomily bemoans, \"He who is tired of Weird Al, is tired of life\". The sequence of events was written to parallel much of the history of \"Smells Like Nirvana\", including Kurt Cobain's reaction to the parody. Yankovic has since started to use the clip in concert before performing \"Smells Like Nirvana\".<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/><ref name=\"tvsquad\">{{cite web|author=Keller, Richard|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/01/27/the-simpsons-that-90s-show/|title=The Simpsons: That 90's Show|accessdate=January 18, 2008|work=[[AOLTV]]|publisher=[[Huffington Post|Huffpost TV]]}}</ref>\n\n==Live performances==\n[[File:WeirdAlSmellsLikeNirvana.jpg|thumb|upright|right|\"Weird Al\" Yankovic performing \"Smells Like Nirvana\" in concert, dressed like Kurt Cobain.]]\nDuring live performances, Yankovic dons clothing similar to what Cobain wore in the video for \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\".

it was released both as a single and as part of Yankovic's ''[[Off the Deep End]]'' album in April 1992. \"Smells Like Nirvana\" was written during a three-year career low for Yankovic after the financial failure of his film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'', but captured the quickly-rising popularity of [[grunge]] and Nirvana's success. The song was written to poke fun at the fact that many people had a hard time understanding Nirvana singer [[Kurt Cobain]]'s lyrics in the original song. After being unable to contact Nirvana by conventional means, Yankovic called Cobain while the band was on the set of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where Cobain quickly gave permission to record the parody.\n\nRecording the song was a change for Yankovic and his band. Usually, the group were forced to record several overdubs. \"Smells Like Nirvana\", however, was relatively straightforward in its musical composition. To promote the single, Yankovic created an associated video for the song that parodied the \"Smells like Teen Spirit\" video. The parody video closely mirrored the original; Yankovic even went so far as to hire several of the same actors and use the same set.\n\n\"Smells Like Nirvana\" was met with critical praise and helped to re-energize Yankovic's career. Cobain considered the parody as a sign that they had \"made it\" as a band. The song is one of Yankovic's most successful singles and was his second top 40 hit in the United States, reaching number 35 on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and the U.S. [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]]. The song's video was nominated for a 1992 [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video]].\n\n==Background==\nPrior to writing \"Smells Like Nirvana\", Yankovic's music career had suffered from the poor financial performance of his 1989 feature film, ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' and [[UHF \u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff|the associated soundtrack]]. Yankovic called that \"the beginning of three years where it was kind of hard for me to recover\".<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> He started work on a new studio album around 1990.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> To revitalize his career, he considered creating a parody of a [[Michael Jackson]] song, which had proven successful twice before with \"[[Eat It]]\" and \"[[Fat (song)|Fat]]\". He had composed a parody of Jackson's \"[[Black or White]]\", titled \"Snack All Night\", but Jackson said he was uncomfortable with the parody, given that the original song was intended to be a political statement. Yankovic would later believe that Jackson's refusal was, in retrospect, a blessing; he felt that \"Snack All Night\" was not one of his better works.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> While he had compiled other original songs for a new album he feared the lack of a good parody song would doom the album to failure and held off from releasing anything until an idea presented itself.<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nThe band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] started to become a name in the music scene at the time, creating \"big, seismic shifts in pop culture\" according to Yankovic.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> Yankovic felt that the band's 1991 album ''[[Nevermind]]'', which featured \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", was \"really great\", but feared that at its release the band was not popular enough to warrant a parody.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> By early 1992, ''Nevermind'' had reached platinum certification and led the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]], which led Yankovic to start working on a parody.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> Yankovic noted that much of the publicity around ''Nevermind'' dealt with the inability to comprehend the songs' lyrics, both in their phrasing and the manner in which they were sung by the lead vocalist Kurt Cobain. Yankovic decided to use this as the basis for his parody. Yankovic noted, \"I try not to go the obvious route all the time, but sometimes the most obvious is actually the best.\"<ref name=\"esq interview\"/> Yankovic had initial difficulty getting permission for the parody, as his manager claimed he was unable to get through to the group numerous times.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> When Yankovic learned that Nirvana would be performing on the January 11, 1992 show of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', he called his ''UHF'' co-star, [[Victoria Jackson]], at the time a regular cast member of the show. Jackson managed to give the phone to Cobain so that Yankovic could make his request. Cobain agreed, though initially he inquired if the song would be about food, a common theme in many of Yankovic's songs.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/><ref name=\"booklet\">{{cite AV media notes| title = Permanent Record: Al in the Box| titlelink = Permanent Record: Al in the Box| others = [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]| year = 1994| first = Barret| last = Hansen| authorlink = Dr. Demento| type = liner| publisher = [[Scotti Brothers Records]]| location = [[California]], [[United States|USA]]}}</ref> Yankovic explained that the song would be about Cobain's incomprehensible lyrics, to which Cobain replied, according to Yankovic, \"Oh, sure, of course, that's funny.\"<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/>\n\n==Recording and lyrics==\n{| style=\"font-size:80%\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" color=\"black\" width=130px\n| {{Listen|filename=Smells Like Nirvana (Sample).ogg|title=\"Smells LIke Nirvana\" (sample)|description=\"Smells Like Nirvana\", from Yankovic's 1992 album ''Off the Deep End''.

Yankovic is present on guitar and vocals as [[Kurt Cobain]], with [[Steve Jay]] on bass as [[Krist Novoselic]], and [[Jon \"Bermuda\" Schwartz]] on drums as [[Dave Grohl]]. All three wear clothing and long-haired wigs to imitate the look of Nirvana in \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". Yankovic's video uses many of the same props, actors and camera angles; in particular, the video was shot in the same [[Culver City, California]] sound stage as Nirvana's video, several of the cheerleaders and audience members were from the original video, and [[Tony De La Rosa]] reprises his role as the janitor.<ref name=\"chosen rejects\">St. Thomas, p. 104</ref><ref>George-Warren et al., p. 1092</ref> Levey stated that they were able to recreate much of the same setting with help of the producers of the original Nirvana video once they were aware that the song had Cobain's blessing.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> Yankovic had a brief conversation with [[Samuel Bayer]], the original director of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" in preparation for the video shoot. Although Yankovic noted that \"he was certainly going along with it\", he felt that Bayer was \"the least enthused\" because \"he was a true [[wiktionary:artiste|art\u00edste]]\" and was reluctant to see his work parodied.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/>\n\nThe video includes actor [[Dick Van Patten]] in a guest role.

For several months after Cobain's death, Yankovic would first perform a somber tribute to Cobain prior to playing the song itself. Shortly after Cobain's death, Yankovic was scheduled to play a show in [[Seattle]], where Nirvana first became famous. Due to this connection, Yankovic was hesitant to perform the spoof, as he worried about how the audience might react to the parody. However, Yankovic was urged by journalists to go through with the performance, as they said that the song would be \"cathartic\" for the area. Ultimately, the performance \"went over extremely well\".<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> Yankovic continues to play \"Smells Like Nirvana\" live, stating that \"Kurt was a fan of the song\" and \"he would have wanted it that way.\"<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nIn ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[That '90s Show]]\", set primarily in flashback to the 1990s, [[Homer Simpson]] is shown creating one of the first [[grunge]] bands while trying to cope with [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s infidelity; the band, called \"Sadgasm\", becomes highly popular. At one point, Homer writes a new song called \"Shave Me\"\u2014itself a loose parody of Nirvana's real single \"[[Rape Me]]\". Homer's song is then parodied as \"Brainfreeze\" in both song and video by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, who voices himself. Homer takes Yankovic's parody as a sign that his band has become successful, but his depressed state after breaking up with Marge leaves him unable to enjoy the song's humor; he gloomily bemoans, \"He who is tired of Weird Al, is tired of life\". The sequence of events was written to parallel much of the history of \"Smells Like Nirvana\", including Kurt Cobain's reaction to the parody.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/><ref name=\"tvsquad\">{{cite web|author=Keller, Richard|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/01/27/the-simpsons-that-90s-show/|title=The Simpsons: That 90's Show|accessdate=January 18, 2008|work=[[AOLTV]]|publisher=[[Huffington Post|Huffpost TV]]}}</ref>\n\n==Live performances==\n[[File:WeirdAlSmellsLikeNirvana.jpg|thumb|upright|right|\"Weird Al\" Yankovic performing \"Smells Like Nirvana\" in concert, dressed like Kurt Cobain.]]\nDuring live performances, Yankovic dons clothing similar to what Cobain wore in the video for \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". This includes an electric left-handed guitar, a shirt similar to Cobain's, and a blonde wig. The costuming for the performance is critical; Schwartz explained that \"if anything's missing, Al won't do it\".<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> The rest of Al's band also participates.

It is located at the intersection of [[Newbury Street]] and [[Massachusetts Avenue (Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] near the western end of the [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] neighborhood of [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. The station is named for the [[Hynes Convention Center]], which is located about {{convert|700|feet}} to the east along [[Boylston Street]]. It has two [[side platform]]s serving the two tracks of the [[Boylston Street Subway]], which are used by the Green Line [[Green Line \"B\" Branch|B Branch]], [[Green Line \"C\" Branch|C Branch]], and [[Green Line \"D\" Branch|D Branch]]. The main entrance to the station from Massachusetts Avenue leads to a fare lobby under the [[360 Newbury Street]] building.\n\nConstruction of the station (originally named Massachusetts) began in December 1912; it opened in October 1914 along with the Boylston Street Subway for use by the [[Boston Elevated Railway]] (BERy). Construction on a surface-level transfer station for streetcars on Boylston Street and Massachusetts Avenue began in April 1918 and was completed the following November. These surface routes were gradually [[bustitution|replaced by buses]] from the 1930s to the 1960s. The transfer station was closed in January 1963 due to construction of the adjacent [[Massachusetts Turnpike Extension]]; it was partially demolished.\n\nThe newly-created MBTA renamed the station Auditorium in 1965, followed by Hynes Convention Center/ICA in 1990 and finally Hynes Convention Center in 2006. A pedestrian tunnel to the southbound bus shelter was opened in 1964, and the Boylston Street entrance was reopened in 1965. Both were closed in the 1980s, though the Boylston Street entrance is still used during the [[Boston Marathon]] and major events at the convention center.\n\nAveraging just under 9,000 weekday boardings in a 2013 count, Hynes is the busiest non-[[accessible]] MBTA station. A renovation to the station, planned as part of [[air rights]] development over the adjacent [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], will make the station accessible and reopen the Boylston Street entrance at all times. The project is expected to be completed in 2025 at a cost of $45.7 million. A separate development project is proposed to include restoration of the pedestrian tunnel.\n\n==Station layout==\n[[File:Hynes Convention Center station layout 2020.svg|thumb|left|Diagram of the station layout, showing platforms and tracks (green), fare lobbies (yellow), and surface corridors (orange).

It is located at the intersection of [[Newbury Street]] and [[Massachusetts Avenue (Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] near the western end of the [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] neighborhood of [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. The station is named for the [[Hynes Convention Center]], which is located about {{convert|700|feet}} to the east along [[Boylston Street]]. It has two [[side platform]]s serving the two tracks of the [[Boylston Street Subway]], which are used by the Green Line [[Green Line \"B\" Branch|B Branch]], [[Green Line \"C\" Branch|C Branch]], and [[Green Line \"D\" Branch|D Branch]]. The main entrance to the station from Massachusetts Avenue leads to a fare lobby under the [[360 Newbury Street]] building.\n\nConstruction of the station (originally named Massachusetts) began in December 1912; it opened in October 1914 along with the Boylston Street Subway for use by the [[Boston Elevated Railway]] (BERy). Construction on a surface-level transfer station for streetcars on Boylston Street and Massachusetts Avenue began in April 1918 and was completed the following November. These surface routes were gradually [[bustitution|replaced by buses]] from the 1930s to the 1960s. The transfer station was closed in January 1963 due to construction of the adjacent [[Massachusetts Turnpike Extension]]; it was partially demolished.\n\nThe newly-created MBTA renamed the station Auditorium in 1965, followed by Hynes Convention Center/ICA in 1990 and finally Hynes Convention Center in 2006. A pedestrian tunnel to the southbound bus shelter was opened in 1964, and the Boylston Street entrance was reopened in 1965. Both were closed in the 1980s, though the Boylston Street entrance is still used during the [[Boston Marathon]] and major events at the convention center.\n\nAveraging just under 9,000 weekday boardings in a 2013 count, Hynes is the busiest non-[[accessible]] MBTA station. A renovation to the station, planned as part of [[air rights]] development over the adjacent [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], will make the station accessible and reopen the Boylston Street entrance at all times. The project is expected to be completed in 2025 at a cost of $45.7 million. A separate development project is proposed to include restoration of the pedestrian tunnel.\n\n==Station layout==\n[[File:Hynes Convention Center station layout 2020.svg|thumb|left|Diagram of the station layout, showing platforms and tracks (green), fare lobbies (yellow), and surface corridors (orange).

There are one hundred and eighty-three health clinics in [[Guatemala]] that treat the effects of an induced abortion. They are mainly concentrated in the Southwest and Metropolitan regions of the country, where abortion rates are the highest.  However, the population in these areas is so dense that there are less health clinics per woman than there are in other areas of the country.

Since the stance of the Catholic Church is conservative on abortion, Guatemala has strict abortion laws.\n\n==Current legal status and punishment==\nThe law is divided into eight different articles numbered 133-140. The first article establishes Guatemala's legal definition of abortion as \"the death of the product of conception at any time of pregnancy\", while the rest address the imprisonment punishments associated with abortion.\n\nArticle 134 states that \"a woman who causes her abortion or consents to another person causing it, shall be punished with imprisonment of one to three years.  If driven for reasons linked intimately to her state that produce undoubted psychic disturbance, the penalty shall be imprisonment of six months to two years\".\n\nArticle 135 concerns the role of consent in an abortion. If the woman consents to the abortion then the imprisonment term for the woman and the person who performs the procedure is one to three years. If the abortion is carried out intentionally without the consent of the woman then imprisonment is extended to three to six years. This article also addresses the nature of the abortion, stating that if \"violence, threat, or deceit has been employed, the penalty shall be imprisonment of four to eight years\".\n\nArticle 136 addresses the punishment for the person who incurred the abortion if the woman dies. If she consented and then died the punishment is three to eight years but if she did not consent then imprisonment is four to twelve years.\n\nArticle 137 states that an abortion with the consent of the woman and with the support of another doctor is not punishable if the death of the fetus was not intentional and was solely a result of trying to save the life of the mother, given that all other means of saving her were utilized.\n\nArticle 138 addresses unintended abortion. If violence occurs and an abortion is unintentionally caused while it is obvious that the victim is pregnant then imprisonment for the person responsible for the violence is one to three years. If there are injuries incurred onto the woman that are more than just an abortion then the length of imprisonment is increased by one third.\n\nArticle 139 address negligent abortion which is punished by one to three years' imprisonment given the woman knew she was pregnant.\n\nArticle 140 addresses specific aggravation related to abortion and states that \"A doctor who, abusing his or her profession, causes the abortion or cooperates in it shall be punished with the penalties provided for in Article 135, with a fine of five hundred to three thousand quetzals, with disqualification of exercising his or her profession for two to five years\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Abortion Laws of the World|publisher=Annual Review of Population Law}}</ref>\n\n==Effects of illegalization==\n\n===Induced abortions and abortion rates===\nIn Guatemala, there are around 65,000 induced abortions performed each year, of which around 21,600 require hospitalization for complications.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The abortion rate in Guatemala is about 24 per 1,000 women ages 15\u201349. The abortion rate is slightly higher in the southwest region of Guatemala, which is less developed and consists of a mostly indigenous population, and in metropolitan regions which have a high population concentration. In these areas of the country, abortions occur at a rate of about 29-30 per 1,000 women in the same age range. Nationally, the unintended pregnancy rate is around 66 per 1,000 women, meaning that about half of all unintended pregnancies result in a woman attempting an induced abortion<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Controversy==\nOn February 24, 2017, a vessel docked in port of [[Puerto Quetzal]], run by a group called [[Women on Waves]], to provide [[abortions pill]]s in international waters.

The town was liberated from Ottoman rule in the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78]], not being a site of significant fighting.

It became a ''kaza'' centre in the 17th century and grew to become a rich and lively town in the 17th and 18th century. A new [[mosque]] was built in 1763, a [[Turkish bath]] in 1774 and a [[clock tower]] in 1826. During the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] many Bulgarians from the region fled to [[Bessarabia]] and established the community of the [[Bessarabian Bulgarians]].\n\nA [[monastery]] school was founded in 1840 on the idea of Iliya Valchev and a ''[[chitalishte]]'' (cultural centre) followed in 1872. The town was liberated from Ottoman rule in the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78]], not being a site of significant fighting.
