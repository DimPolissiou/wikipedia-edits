Patrolling aircraft restricted the ability of submarines to converge on convoys during daylight. The North Atlantic winters offered the longest periods of darkness to conceal surfaced submarine operations. The winter of 1942\u201343 saw the largest number of submarines deployed to the mid-Atlantic before comprehensive anti-submarine aircraft patrols could be extended into that area.\n\nDuring March, there was a series of fierce convoy battles which became, for the Allies, the crisis point of the whole campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/ETO/Ultra/SRH-024/SRH024-4.html#ch4-2 |title=Volume III German Naval Communications Intelligence, Chapter 4, Section 2 |last=Pitz |first=John |publisher=HyperWar Foundation publishing National Security Agency, Central Security Service  |website=ibiblio |date=9 September 2016}}</ref> One hundred merchant ships in trade convoys HX 229 and SC 122 encountered three wolfpacks of 38 submarines in a single sprawling action, which German radio reported as \"the greatest convoy battle of all time\" (''Die gr\u00f6sste Geleitzugschlacht aller Zeiten'').<ref name=\"Middlebrook276\">Middlebrook p.276</ref> A [[Royal Navy]] report later concluded \"The Germans never came so near to disrupting communications between the New World and the Old as in the first 20 days of March 1943\".<ref name=\"Roskill p367\">Roskill p367.</ref>\n\n==Convoy SC 122==\nSC 122 was a slow eastbound convoy of 60 ships, routed from [[New York Harbor#World War II|New York]] to [[Liverpool]]. (This was during the period when SC convoys were switched from [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]], [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]], to New York; this was reversed later due to congestion problems there.) It sailed on 5 March 1943, protected at first by one [[Destroyer#Inter-war .26 WW2|destroyer]] and five [[Corvette#World War II|corvettes]] of the [[Western Local Escort Force]]. On 6 March, off [[Cape Cod]], two ships put back to New York due to heavy weather, and on 8 March, another six abandoned the crossing, and put into [[City of Halifax|Halifax]].\n\nThe convoy pressed on, changing escorts on 13 March off [[Cape Race]]. The western local group left, after the [[Mid-Ocean Escort Force]] B5 [[Escort Group]] joined from [[St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John's]]. B5 Escort Group consisted of eight warships, led by Commander RC Boyle in the destroyer {{HMS|Havelock|H88|6}}, the destroyer {{USS|Upshur|DD-144|6}}, the {{sclass2-|River|frigate}} {{HMS|Swale|K217|6}}, the {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette}}s {{HMS|Buttercup|K193|2}}, {{HMS|Godetia|K226|2}}, {{HMS|Lavender|K60|2}}, {{HMS|Pimpernel|K71|2}} and {{HMS|Saxifrage|K04|2}}, and a [[Naval trawler|trawler]] as rescue vessel.\n\n==Convoy HX 229==\nHX 229 was also eastbound and sailed from New York on 8 March, with 40 ships and the local escort. A further 34 ships which should have been included were delayed due to congestion at New York; they sailed the following day as HX 229A. The first few days of the convoy were uneventful; HX 229 met its [[Mid-Ocean Escort Force]] on 14 March and the local escort departed. The ocean escort was B4 Escort Group from [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John's]], of four destroyers and a corvette. It was led on this occasion by Commander GJ Luther of {{HMS|Volunteer|D71|6}}, as its regular leader was in dock for repairs. Luther had recently joined the group and this was only his second crossing. The other ships of B4 were the destroyers [[USS Branch (DD-197)|HMS ''Beverley'']], [[USS Evans (DD-78)|''Mansfield'']] and {{HMS|Witherington|D76|2}} and the corvette {{HMS|Anemone|K48|2}}, although ''Witherington'' had to detach on 15 March, to be replaced by the corvette {{HMS|Pennywort|K111|2}} for the crossing.\n\n==Wolfpacks==\nArrayed against them were three patrol lines (rakes) of U-boats:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/ETO/Ultra/SRH-024/SRH024-4.html#ch4-4 |title=Volume III German Naval Communications Intelligence, Chapter 4, Section 4 |last=Pitz |first=John |publisher=HyperWar Foundation publishing National Security Agency, Central Security Service |website=ibiblio |access-date=20 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n* ''Raubgraf'', (\"Robber Baron\"), of eight boats was already formed, having just been involved in a battle with [[Convoy HX.228|HX 228]]; it was sent to patrol off east of [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], at the western edge of the [[Mid-Atlantic gap|Air Gap]].\n* ''St\u00fcrmer'' (\"Daredevil\"), a new group of 18 boats, was to form up in the middle of the Air Gap. It was formed from boats from patrol group ''Westmark'', which had previously engaged [[Convoy SC 121|SC 121]].\n* A further group, ''Dr\u00e4nger'' (\"Harrier\"), of eleven boats formed to the east of ''St\u00fcrmer''. Some of these boats were from ''[[Operation Neuland|Neuland]]'', which had also been in the battle with HX 228; the rest were newcomers.\n\n==The battle==\n{{main| Convoys HX 229/SC 122 order of battle}}\nThe German [[B-Dienst]] signals intelligence group, had given notice of an east-bound convoy and by 8pm on 13 March had a location for SC 122. Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], commanding the U-Boat fleet, directed ''Raubgraf'' to intercept, forming a new rake to the west. A westerly gale gave speed to SC 122, which passed through ''Raubgraf''s patrol area on the morning of 15 March just 24 hours before the patrol line was formed.\n\nThe Allied [[Ultra]] intelligence, which decrypted German messages enciphered using the [[Enigma machine]] and which had helped the Admiralty to divert convoys away from wolf packs, had been \"blinded\" on 10 March 1943 as the result of the Germans bringing in a new short weather report. This resulted in the British code breakers being starved of the cribs necessary to break \"Shark\", the cipher used by the German U-Boats. The U-Boat tracking room at the Admiralty Operational Intelligence Centre was therefore unable to divert convoys around the U-Boat packs. A message from a U-Boat gave away its position once that position had been fixed by [[Direction finding|DF]] and the convoy SC 122 was diverted around the estimated danger area.\n\nThe Allied Cipher Number 3 used by the convoy escorts [[B-Dienst#Combined Naval Cipher No. 3|had been broken by the Germans]]. This allowed them to position wolf packs in the way of HX 229, which was following a similar course. It passed through ''Raubgraf{{'}}s'' rake in the night of {{nowrap|15/16 March}} without being sighted because of bad weather. On the morning of 16 March {{GS|U-653||2}}, which had detached from ''Raubgraf'' to return to base with mechanical problems, sighted HX 229 heading east and sent a sighting report. D\u00f6nitz immediately ordered ''Raubgraf'' to pursue and intercept, while ''St\u00fcrmer'' and ''Dr\u00e4nger'' were ordered west to form a line ahead of the convoy. He saw in this an opportunity to attack an east-bound convoy, full of war materials bound for Europe, with the full width of the [[GIUK gap|Air Gap]] to cross.\n\n''Raubgraf'' caught up with HX 229 on the evening of 16 March and mounted an attack that night. Three ships were sunk and another five on the morning of 17 March, a total of eight in just 8 hours. The escort was reported to be weak, as 2 ships had dropped out to pick up survivors. The escorts chased 3 contacts during the night but with no result. During the rest of the day, boats from ''St\u00fcrmer'' began to arrive. One of these was attacked by a destroyer but again without success.\n\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 140903 King Gruffyd (ship).jpg|thumb|{{GRT|5072}} cargo steamship ''King Gruffyd'', a member of SC 122 that ''U-338'' sank on 17 March]]\nAt the north-eastern end of ''St\u00fcrmer{{'}}s'' rake, {{GS|U-338}} had sighted SC 122 heading east, about 120 miles from HX 229's position. After sending a sighting report she attacked, sinking four ships in quick succession. A fifth, ''Fort Cedar Lake'', was damaged, to be sunk later in the day. Two more ships from HX 229 were lost during the day. Two boats from ''St\u00fcrmer'' were able to penetrate the defences about midday on 17 March but the escorts were able to fend off any further attacks, assisted by brief visits from Very Long Range (VLR) aircraft flying at extreme range. SC 122 was also able to resist further attacks until evening.\n\nDuring the night of {{nowrap|17/18 March}} the attack on both convoys, now just 70 miles apart, continued. ''U-338'' sank the freighter ''Granville'', of SC 122 in the evening, surviving a fierce counter-attack by escorts, and after midnight {{GS|U-305||2}} sank two more ships (''Port Auckland'' and ''Zouave'').\n\nHX 229's escort suffered a blow as HMS ''Mansfield'' was forced to detach during the night of {{nowrap|17/18 March.}} Help was on its way in the form of the destroyer {{HMS|Highlander|H44|6}}, under Commander ECL Day. Arriving on 18 March, Day, as a senior and more experienced officer, took command of B4 Group for the rest of the engagement. Also en route from [[Hvalfjordur|Hvalfjord]], in [[Iceland]], were the destroyers {{HMS|Vimy}} and {{USS|Babbitt|DD-128|6}}, for HX 229, and the US Coast Guard cutter {{USCGC|Ingham|WHEC-35|6}} for SC 122. These were dispatched on the morning of 18 March, and arrived the following day.\n\nOn the afternoon of 18 March, {{GS|U-221||2}} succeeded in sinking two ships of HX 229 but further losses were avoided. HMS ''Highlander'' joined that afternoon, a welcome addition as B4 was by this time reduced to five ships.\n\nDuring the night of {{nowrap|18/19 March}} the two convoys were running in tandem, though sailing independently. All attacks on both convoys were repelled this night, and six firm contacts were attacked but little damage was inflicted. One ship from HX 229 was lost, a romper which broke away to proceed independently; this ship, ''Matthew Luckenbach'', ran into the mel\u00e9e around SC 122 and was torpedoed, to be sunk later on 19 March. A straggler from SC 122, ''Clarissa Radcliffe'', was also sunk with all hands by U-663.\n\nOn 19 March the escorts were reinforced by the arrival of ''Vimy'' and ''Babitt'', for HX 229, and ''Ingham'' for SC 122. HX 229 was also joined by the corvette {{HMS|Abelia|K184|6}}, detached from another convoy. Also on 19 March {{GS|U-384||2}} was attacked by air patrol to the north of SC 122 and sunk. There were no further losses to the convoys that day; faced with stiffening resistance and sensing nothing further would be achieved without disproportionate losses, D\u00f6nitz called off the assault.\n\nThe convoys continued east. Further changes to the escort occurred on 20 March as reinforcement arrived in the form of the corvette ''[[HMCS Sherbrooke]]'', while ''Upshur'' and ''Ingham'' were detached. The local escort groups met on 23 March, and HX 229, with 27 ships surviving, arrived at [[Liverpool]] on 23 March. SC 122, with 42 remaining ships, arrived later the same day.\n\n==Outcome==\nThe double battle had involved 90 merchant ships and 16 escort ships (though not all were present at the same time). 22 merchant ships were sunk (13 from HX 229 and 9 from SC 122), a loss of 146,000 tons. More than 300 merchant seaman died. In total, 38 U-boats had taken part (though throughout the battle not all had been in contact). One U-boat had been lost with all hands.\n\nThis was the largest convoy battle of the Atlantic campaign. A Royal Navy report later concluded \"It appeared possible that we should not be able to regard convoy as an effective system of defence\".<ref name=\"Roskill p367\"/>\n\n==Losses==\n\n===Allied ships===\n'''HX 229'''\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Patrolling aircraft restricted the ability of submarines to converge on convoys during daylight. The North Atlantic winters offered the longest periods of darkness to conceal surfaced submarine operations. The winter of 1942\u201343 saw the largest number of submarines deployed to the mid-Atlantic before comprehensive anti-submarine aircraft patrols could be extended into that area.\n\nDuring March, there was a series of fierce convoy battles which became, for the Allies, the crisis point of the whole campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/ETO/Ultra/SRH-024/SRH024-4.html#ch4-2 |title=Volume III German Naval Communications Intelligence, Chapter 4, Section 2 |last=Pitz |first=John |publisher=HyperWar Foundation publishing National Security Agency, Central Security Service  |website=ibiblio |date=9 September 2016}}</ref> One hundred merchant ships in trade convoys HX 229 and SC 122 encountered three wolfpacks of 38 submarines in a single sprawling action, which German radio reported as \"the greatest convoy battle of all time\" (''Die gr\u00f6sste Geleitzugschlacht aller Zeiten'').<ref name=\"Middlebrook276\">Middlebrook p.276</ref> A [[Royal Navy]] report later concluded \"The Germans never came so near to disrupting communications between the New World and the Old as in the first 20 days of March 1943\".<ref name=\"Roskill p367\">Roskill p367.</ref>\n\n==Convoy SC 122==\nSC 122 was a slow eastbound convoy of 60 ships, routed from [[New York Harbor#World War II|New York]] to [[Liverpool]]. (This was during the period when SC convoys were switched from [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]], [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]], to New York; this was reversed later due to congestion problems there.) It sailed on 5 March 1943, protected at first by one [[Destroyer#Inter-war .26 WW2|destroyer]] and five [[Corvette#World War II|corvettes]] of the [[Western Local Escort Force]]. On 6 March, off [[Cape Cod]], two ships put back to New York due to heavy weather, and on 8 March, another six abandoned the crossing, and put into [[City of Halifax|Halifax]].\n\nThe convoy pressed on, changing escorts on 13 March off [[Cape Race]]. The western local group left, after the [[Mid-Ocean Escort Force]] B5 [[Escort Group]] joined from [[St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John's]]. B5 Escort Group consisted of eight warships, led by Commander RC Boyle in the destroyer {{HMS|Havelock|H88|6}}, the destroyer {{USS|Upshur|DD-144|6}}, the {{sclass2-|River|frigate}} {{HMS|Swale|K217|6}}, the {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette}}s {{HMS|Buttercup|K193|2}}, {{HMS|Godetia|K226|2}}, {{HMS|Lavender|K60|2}}, {{HMS|Pimpernel|K71|2}} and {{HMS|Saxifrage|K04|2}}, and a [[Naval trawler|trawler]] as rescue vessel.\n\n==Convoy HX 229==\nHX 229 was also eastbound and sailed from New York on 8 March, with 40 ships and the local escort. A further 34 ships which should have been included were delayed due to congestion at New York; they sailed the following day as HX 229A. The first few days of the convoy were uneventful; HX 229 met its [[Mid-Ocean Escort Force]] on 14 March and the local escort departed. The ocean escort was B4 Escort Group from [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John's]], of four destroyers and a corvette. It was led on this occasion by Commander GJ Luther of {{HMS|Volunteer|D71|6}}, as its regular leader was in dock for repairs. Luther had recently joined the group and this was only his second crossing. The other ships of B4 were the destroyers [[USS Branch (DD-197)|HMS ''Beverley'']], [[USS Evans (DD-78)|''Mansfield'']] and {{HMS|Witherington|D76|2}} and the corvette {{HMS|Anemone|K48|2}}, although ''Witherington'' had to detach on 15 March, to be replaced by the corvette {{HMS|Pennywort|K111|2}} for the crossing.\n\n==Wolfpacks==\nArrayed against them were three patrol lines (rakes) of U-boats:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/ETO/Ultra/SRH-024/SRH024-4.html#ch4-4 |title=Volume III German Naval Communications Intelligence, Chapter 4, Section 4 |last=Pitz |first=John |publisher=HyperWar Foundation publishing National Security Agency, Central Security Service |website=ibiblio |access-date=20 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n* ''Raubgraf'', (\"Robber Baron\"), of eight boats was already formed, having just been involved in a battle with [[Convoy HX.228|HX 228]]; it was sent to patrol off east of [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], at the western edge of the [[Mid-Atlantic gap|Air Gap]].\n* ''St\u00fcrmer'' (\"Daredevil\"), a new group of 18 boats, was to form up in the middle of the Air Gap. It was formed from boats from patrol group ''Westmark'', which had previously engaged [[Convoy SC 121|SC 121]].\n* A further group, ''Dr\u00e4nger'' (\"Harrier\"), of eleven boats formed to the east of ''St\u00fcrmer''. Some of these boats were from ''[[Operation Neuland|Neuland]]'', which had also been in the battle with HX 228; the rest were newcomers.\n\n==The battle==\n{{main| Convoys HX 229/SC 122 order of battle}}\nThe German [[B-Dienst]] signals intelligence group, had given notice of an east-bound convoy and by 8pm on 13 March had a location for SC 122. Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], commanding the U-Boat fleet, directed ''Raubgraf'' to intercept, forming a new rake to the west. A westerly gale gave speed to SC 122, which passed through ''Raubgraf''s patrol area on the morning of 15 March just 24 hours before the patrol line was formed.\n\nThe Allied [[Ultra]] intelligence, which decrypted German messages enciphered using the [[Enigma machine]] and which had helped the Admiralty to divert convoys away from wolf packs, had been \"blinded\" on 10 March 1943 as the result of the Germans bringing in a new short weather report. This resulted in the British code breakers being starved of the cribs necessary to break \"Shark\", the cipher used by the German U-Boats. The U-Boat tracking room at the Admiralty Operational Intelligence Centre was therefore unable to divert convoys around the U-Boat packs. A message from a U-Boat gave away its position once that position had been fixed by [[Direction finding|DF]] and the convoy SC 122 was diverted around the estimated danger area.\n\nThe Allied Cipher Number 3 used by the convoy escorts [[B-Dienst#Combined Naval Cipher No. 3|had been broken by the Germans]]. This allowed them to position wolf packs in the way of HX 229, which was following a similar course. It passed through ''Raubgraf{{'}}s'' rake in the night of {{nowrap|15/16 March}} without being sighted because of bad weather. On the morning of 16 March {{GS|U-653||2}}, which had detached from ''Raubgraf'' to return to base with mechanical problems, sighted HX 229 heading east and sent a sighting report. D\u00f6nitz immediately ordered ''Raubgraf'' to pursue and intercept, while ''St\u00fcrmer'' and ''Dr\u00e4nger'' were ordered west to form a line ahead of the convoy. He saw in this an opportunity to attack an east-bound convoy, full of war materials bound for Europe, with the full width of the [[GIUK gap|Air Gap]] to cross.\n\n''Raubgraf'' caught up with HX 229 on the evening of 16 March and mounted an attack that night. Three ships were sunk and another five on the morning of 17 March, a total of eight in just 8 hours. The escort was reported to be weak, as 2 ships had dropped out to pick up survivors. The escorts chased 3 contacts during the night but with no result. During the rest of the day, boats from ''St\u00fcrmer'' began to arrive. One of these was attacked by a destroyer but again without success.\n\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 140903 King Gruffyd (ship).jpg|thumb|{{GRT|5072}} cargo steamship ''King Gruffyd'', a member of SC 122 that ''U-338'' sank on 17 March]]\nAt the north-eastern end of ''St\u00fcrmer{{'}}s'' rake, {{GS|U-338}} had sighted SC 122 heading east, about 120 miles from HX 229's position. After sending a sighting report she attacked, sinking four ships in quick succession. A fifth, ''Fort Cedar Lake'', was damaged, to be sunk later in the day. Two more ships from HX 229 were lost during the day. Two boats from ''St\u00fcrmer'' were able to penetrate the defences about midday on 17 March but the escorts were able to fend off any further attacks, assisted by brief visits from Very Long Range (VLR) aircraft flying at extreme range. SC 122 was also able to resist further attacks until evening.\n\nDuring the night of {{nowrap|17/18 March}} the attack on both convoys, now just 70 miles apart, continued. ''U-338'' sank the freighter ''Granville'', of SC 122 in the evening, surviving a fierce counter-attack by escorts, and after midnight {{GS|U-305||2}} sank two more ships (''Port Auckland'' and ''Zouave'').\n\nHX 229's escort suffered a blow as HMS ''Mansfield'' was forced to detach during the night of {{nowrap|17/18 March.}} Help was on its way in the form of the destroyer {{HMS|Highlander|H44|6}}, under Commander ECL Day. Arriving on 18 March, Day, as a senior and more experienced officer, took command of B4 Group for the rest of the engagement. Also en route from [[Hvalfjordur|Hvalfjord]], in [[Iceland]], were the destroyers {{HMS|Vimy}} and {{USS|Babbitt|DD-128|6}}, for HX 229, and the US Coast Guard cutter {{USCGC|Ingham|WHEC-35|6}} for SC 122. These were dispatched on the morning of 18 March, and arrived the following day.\n\nOn the afternoon of 18 March, {{GS|U-221||2}} succeeded in sinking two ships of HX 229 but further losses were avoided. HMS ''Highlander'' joined that afternoon, a welcome addition as B4 was by this time reduced to five ships.\n\nDuring the night of {{nowrap|18/19 March}} the two convoys were running in tandem, though sailing independently. All attacks on both convoys were repelled this night, and six firm contacts were attacked but little damage was inflicted. One ship from HX 229 was lost, a romper which broke away to proceed independently; this ship, ''Matthew Luckenbach'', ran into the mel\u00e9e around SC 122 and was torpedoed, to be sunk later on 19 March. A straggler from SC 122, ''Clarissa Radcliffe'', was also sunk with all hands by U-663.\n\nOn 19 March the escorts were reinforced by the arrival of ''Vimy'' and ''Babitt'', for HX 229, and ''Ingham'' for SC 122. HX 229 was also joined by the corvette {{HMS|Abelia|K184|6}}, detached from another convoy. Also on 19 March {{GS|U-384||2}} was attacked by air patrol to the north of SC 122 and sunk. There were no further losses to the convoys that day; faced with stiffening resistance and sensing nothing further would be achieved without disproportionate losses, D\u00f6nitz called off the assault.\n\nThe convoys continued east. Further changes to the escort occurred on 20 March as reinforcement arrived in the form of the corvette ''[[HMCS Sherbrooke]]'', while ''Upshur'' and ''Ingham'' were detached. The local escort groups met on 23 March, and HX 229, with 27 ships surviving, arrived at [[Liverpool]] on 23 March. SC 122, with 42 remaining ships, arrived later the same day.\n\n==Outcome==\nThe double battle had involved 90 merchant ships and 16 escort ships (though not all were present at the same time). 22 merchant ships were sunk (13 from HX 229 and 9 from SC 122), a loss of 146,000 tons. More than 300 merchant seaman died. In total, 38 U-boats had taken part (though throughout the battle not all had been in contact). One U-boat had been lost with all hands.\n\nThis was the largest convoy battle of the Atlantic campaign. A Royal Navy report later concluded \"It appeared possible that we should not be able to regard convoy as an effective system of defence\".<ref name=\"Roskill p367\"/>\n\n==Losses==\n\n===Allied ships===\n'''HX 229'''\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Suharto's acknowledgment enabled the [[Indonesian Democratic Party]] (PDI), a government-sanctioned party, to campaign on Sukarno nostalgia in the lead-up to the 1987 [[Elections in Indonesia|legislative elections]]. Up to that time, Megawati had seen herself as a housewife, but in 1987 she joined PDI and ran for a [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR) seat.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" /> The PDI accepted Megawati to boost their own image. Megawati quickly became popular, her status as Sukarno's daughter offsetting her lack of oratorical skills. Although PDI came last in the elections, Megawati was elected to the DPR.

In December 1993, the PDI held a national congress. As was always the case when [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] opposition parties held their congresses, the government actively interfered. As the Congress approached, three individuals contended for the PDI chair. The incumbent, Suryadi, had become critical of the government. The second was Budi Harjono a government-friendly figure whom the government backed. The third was Megawati.

By late January 1998 the [[Indonesian rupiah|rupiah]] fell to nearly 15,000 against the [[United States dollar|US dollar]], compared to only 4,000 in early December. Combined with increasing public anger at pervasive corruption, this culminated in May 1998 with Suharto's resignation and the assumption of the presidency by Vice President [[B. J. Habibie]]. The restrictions on Megawati were removed and she began to consolidate her political position. In October 1998, her supporters held a National Congress whereby Megawati's PDI faction would now be known as the [[Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle]] (PDI-P). Megawati was elected Chair and was nominated as PDI-P's presidential candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/Indonesian/Indonesian_Elections/Indo-pemilu99/11pdip.htm |title=KOMPAS-11: PARTAI DEMOKRASI INDONESIA PERJUANGAN (PDI PERJUANGAN) |publisher=Seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nPDI-P, together with [[Abdurrahman Wahid]]'s National Awakening Party (PKB) and [[Amien Rais]]' [[National Mandate Party]] (PAN), became the leading reform forces.

Megawati threw her support behind Matori Abdul Djalil, the Chair of PKB. He was overwhelmingly defeated by Amien, who in addition to enjoying Central Axis support was backed by Golkar.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" /> The Golkar and Central Axis coalition struck again when they secured [[Akbar Tanjung]]'s election as Head of DPR. At this stage, people became wary that Megawati, who best represented reform, was going to be obstructed by the political process and that the status quo was going to be preserved. PDI-P supporters began to gather in Jakarta.\n\nHabibie made a poorly received speech on political accountability that led him to withdraw. The presidential election held on 20 October 1999 came down to Megawati and Wahid. Megawati took an early lead, but was overtaken and lost with 313 votes compared to Wahid's 373. Megawati's loss provoked her supporters to revolt.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" /> Riots raged in Java and [[Bali]]. In the city of [[Surakarta|Solo]], PDI-P masses attacked Amien's house.\n\nThe next day, the MPR assembled to elect the vice president. PDI-P had considered nominating Megawati, but were concerned that the Central Axis and Golkar coalition would again thwart her. Instead, PKB nominated Megawati. She faced stiff competition from [[Hamzah Haz]], [[Akbar Tanjung]] and General [[Wiranto]].<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" /> Well aware of the riots, Akbar and Wiranto withdrew.

She previously served as the eighth [[Vice President of Indonesia|vice president]] from 1999 to 2001.   \n\nMegawati is Indonesia's first [[List of elected and appointed female heads of state and government|female president]] and the [[List of the first women heads of government and state in Muslim-majority countries|sixth woman]] to lead a [[Muslim world|Muslim-majority country]]. She is also the first Indonesian president and as of 2020, the only vice president to be born after [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesia proclaimed its independence]]. After serving as vice president to [[Abdurrahman Wahid]], Megawati became president when Wahid was removed from office in 2001. She ran for re-election in the [[2004 Indonesian presidential election|2004 presidential election]], but was defeated by [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]]. She ran again in the [[2009 Indonesian presidential election|2009 presidential election]], but Yudhoyono defeated her for a second time.\n\nShe is the current leader of the [[Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle]] (PDI-P), one of Indonesia's largest political parties.  She is the eldest daughter of Indonesia's first president, [[Sukarno]].   \n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Sukarno with children and Nehru.jpg|thumb|left|upright|President [[Sukarno]], with his children Megawati and Guntur, while receiving Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] along with his daughter [[Indira Gandhi]].]]\nMegawati was born in [[Yogyakarta]] to [[Sukarno]], who had declared Indonesia's independence from the [[Netherlands]] in 1945 and [[Fatmawati]], one of his nine wives. Megawati was Sukarno's second child and first daughter. She grew up in her father's [[Merdeka Palace]]. She danced for her father's guests and developed a gardening hobby. Megawati was 19 when her father relinquished power in 1966 and was succeeded by a government which eventually came to be led by President [[Suharto]].<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tokohindonesia.com/ensiklopedi/m/megawati/biografi/01.shtml|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070812115823/http://www.tokohindonesia.com/ensiklopedi/m/megawati/biografi/01.shtml|title=Megawati Soekarnoputri, Mbak Pendiam itu Emas &#124; Biografi Tokoh Indonesia|access-date=23 March 2007|archive-date=12 August 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMegawati attended [[Padjadjaran University]] in [[Bandung]] to study agriculture but dropped out in 1967 to be with her father following his fall. In 1970, the year her father died, Megawati went to the [[University of Indonesia]] to study psychology but dropped out after two years.<ref name=\"East Thomas\">{{Harvnb|East|Thomas|2003|p=233}}</ref>\n\n===Name===\n''Sukarnoputri'' (meaning 'daughter of Sukarno') is a [[patronymic|patronym]], not a [[family name]]; [[Javanese people|Javanese]] often do not have family names. She is often referred to as simply ''Megawati'' or ''Mega'', derived from Sanskrit meaning 'cloud goddess'. In a speech to the students of the Sri Sathya Sai Primary School, she mentioned that Indian politician [[Biju Patnaik]] named her at Sukarno's request.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meaindia.nic.in/speech/2002/04/03spc02.htm |title=Speech by Indian President R K Narayanan in honor of Megawati Sukarnoputri |accessdate=5 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505204433/http://meaindia.nic.in/speech/2002/04/03spc02.htm |archivedate=5 May 2009 }}</ref><ref>\"[http://www.economist.com/node/148026 Obituary: Biju Patnaik]\".

Suharto's acknowledgment enabled the [[Indonesian Democratic Party]] (PDI), a government-sanctioned party, to campaign on Sukarno nostalgia in the lead-up to the 1987 [[Elections in Indonesia|legislative elections]]. Up to that time, Megawati had seen herself as a housewife, but in 1987 she joined PDI and ran for a [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR) seat.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" /> The PDI accepted Megawati to boost their own image. Megawati quickly became popular, her status as Sukarno's daughter offsetting her lack of oratorical skills. Although PDI came last in the elections, Megawati was elected to the DPR. Like all members of the DPR she also became a member of the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (MPR).<ref>{{Citation | last = Ekl\u00f6f| first = Stefan | title = Power and Political Culture in Suharto\u2019s Indonesia: The Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) and Decline of the New Order (1986\u201398)| publisher = NIAS Press |location = Denmark|  year = 2003 | isbn = 87-91114-50-0|p=93\u201396}}</ref>\n\n===Chair of PDI===\n[[File:Megawati Sukarnoputri campaigns for parliament, ABC 1995.webm|thumb|1995 [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] news report on the political rise of Megawati Sukarnoputri]]\nMegawati was not reelected, but continued as a PDI member. In December 1993, the PDI held a national congress. As was always the case when [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] opposition parties held their congresses, the government actively interfered. As the Congress approached, three individuals contended for the PDI chair. The incumbent, Suryadi, had become critical of the government. The second was Budi Harjono a government-friendly figure whom the government backed. The third was Megawati. Her candidacy received such overwhelming support that her election at the Congress became a formality.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tokohindonesia.com/ensiklopedi/m/megawati/biografi/02.shtml|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070812115823/http://www.tokohindonesia.com/ensiklopedi/m/megawati/biografi/02.shtml|title=Megawati Soekarnoputri, Pemimpin Berkepribadian Kuat &#124; Biografi Tokoh Indonesia|access-date=23 March 2007|archive-date=12 August 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWhen the congress assembled, the government stalled and delayed attempts to hold the election.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> The congress faced a deadline when their permit to assemble would run out. As the hours ticked down to the end of the congress, troops began gathering. With only two hours remaining, Megawati called a press conference, stating that because she enjoyed the support of a majority of PDI members, she was now the de facto chair.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Despite her relative lack of political experience, she was popular in part for her status as Sukarno's daughter and because she was seen as free of corruption with admirable personal qualities. Under her leadership, PDI gained a large following among the urban poor and both urban and rural middle classes.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Ricklefs| first = M.C. | author-link = M. C.

They never acknowledged Megawati although her self-appointment was ratified in 1994. In 1996, the government convened a special national congress in [[Medan]] that reelected Suryadi as chair. Megawati and her camp refused to acknowledge the results and the PDI divided into pro-Megawati and anti-Megawati camps.<ref>{{Citation | last = Ekl\u00f6f| first = Stefan | title = Power and Political Culture in Suharto\u2019s Indonesia: The Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) and Decline of the New Order (1986\u201398)| publisher = NIAS Press |location = Denmark|  year = 2003 | isbn = 87-91114-50-0 |p=271}}</ref>\n\nSuryadi began threatening to take back PDI's Headquarters in Jakarta.

In the ensuing fight, Megawati's supporters held on to the headquarters. A riot ensued, followed by a government crackdown. The Government later blamed the riots on the [[People's Democratic Party (Indonesia)|People's Democratic Party]] (PRD), and continued to recognize Suryadi's faction as the official party.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Ricklefs| first = M.C. | author-link = M.

When the time came for the 1997 legislative election, Megawati and her supporters threw their support behind the [[United Development Party]] (PPP), the other approved opposition party.<ref>{{Citation | last = Ekl\u00f6f| first = Stefan | title = Power and Political Culture in Suharto\u2019s Indonesia: The Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) and Decline of the New Order (1986\u201398)| publisher = NIAS Press |location = Denmark|  year = 2003 | isbn = 87-91114-50-0|pp=280\u2013281}}</ref>\n\n===''Reformasi''===\nIn mid-1997, Indonesia began to be affected by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|Asian Financial Crisis]] and showed severe economic distress. By late January 1998 the [[Indonesian rupiah|rupiah]] fell to nearly 15,000 against the [[United States dollar|US dollar]], compared to only 4,000 in early December. Combined with increasing public anger at pervasive corruption, this culminated in May 1998 with Suharto's resignation and the assumption of the presidency by Vice President [[B. J. Habibie]]. The restrictions on Megawati were removed and she began to consolidate her political position. In October 1998, her supporters held a National Congress whereby Megawati's PDI faction would now be known as the [[Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle]] (PDI-P). Megawati was elected Chair and was nominated as PDI-P's presidential candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/Indonesian/Indonesian_Elections/Indo-pemilu99/11pdip.htm |title=KOMPAS-11: PARTAI DEMOKRASI INDONESIA PERJUANGAN (PDI PERJUANGAN) |publisher=Seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nPDI-P, together with [[Abdurrahman Wahid]]'s National Awakening Party (PKB) and [[Amien Rais]]' [[National Mandate Party]] (PAN), became the leading reform forces.

In May, [[Alwi Shihab]] held a press conference at his house during which Megawati, Wahid and Amien were to announce that they would work together.

As the MPR General Session approached, it seemed as if the presidential election would be contested between Megawati and Habibie, but by late June Amien had drawn the Islamic parties into a coalition called the Central Axis.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" /> The presidential election became a three-way race when Amien floated the idea of nominating Wahid for president; but Wahid did not provide a clear response to the proposal.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===1999 MPR General Session===\n{{see also|1999 Indonesian presidential election}}\nMegawati's PDI-P and PKB coalition faced its first test when the MPR assembled to choose its Chair. Megawati threw her support behind Matori Abdul Djalil, the Chair of PKB. He was overwhelmingly defeated by Amien, who in addition to enjoying Central Axis support was backed by Golkar.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" /> The Golkar and Central Axis coalition struck again when they secured [[Akbar Tanjung]]'s election as Head of DPR. At this stage, people became wary that Megawati, who best represented reform, was going to be obstructed by the political process and that the status quo was going to be preserved. PDI-P supporters began to gather in Jakarta.\n\nHabibie made a poorly received speech on political accountability that led him to withdraw. The presidential election held on 20 October 1999 came down to Megawati and Wahid. Megawati took an early lead, but was overtaken and lost with 313 votes compared to Wahid's 373. Megawati's loss provoked her supporters to revolt.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" /> Riots raged in Java and [[Bali]]. In the city of [[Surakarta|Solo]], PDI-P masses attacked Amien's house.\n\nThe next day, the MPR assembled to elect the vice president. PDI-P had considered nominating Megawati, but were concerned that the Central Axis and Golkar coalition would again thwart her. Instead, PKB nominated Megawati. She faced stiff competition from [[Hamzah Haz]], [[Akbar Tanjung]] and General [[Wiranto]].<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" /> Well aware of the riots, Akbar and Wiranto withdrew. Hamzah stayed in the race, but Megawati defeated him 396 to 284.

Eros was not allowed to participate in the Congress. Disillusioned with what he perceived to be a [[cult of personality]] developing around Megawati, Eros left PDI-P. In July 2002, he formed the [[Indonesian National Populist Fortress Party|Freedom Bull National Party]].
