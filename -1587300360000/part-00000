bill|the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill]] by the [[Hong Kong government]].<ref name=\"bbc_49317695\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190213_trojanhorse\" /> Had it been enacted, the bill would have allowed the [[extradition]] of wanted criminal suspects and criminal fugitives to territories with which [[Hong Kong]] does not currently have extradition agreements, including [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]].<ref name=\"nyt_20190610_whatis\" /> This led to concerns by some that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the jurisdiction and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|legal system of Mainland China]], thereby undermining [[One country, two systems|the region's autonomy]] and people's civil liberties,<ref name=\"reuters_20190524_eudiplomaticnote\" /><ref

As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, an investigation into [[Allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct surrounding the 2019 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of all arrested protesters, a retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Carrie Lam]]'s resignation along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] for election of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and the Chief Executive.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\" /><ref name=\"abc_66464962\" />\n\nDespite a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9&nbsp;June 2019, the government persisted with the bill.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"vox_18658650\" /> Protesters gathered outside the [[Legislative Council Complex]] to stall the bill's second reading on 12&nbsp;June,<ref name=\"scmp_3013797\" /><ref name=\"cnbc_20190610\" /><ref name=\"nyt_20190610_carriestandfast\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_20190610_pursuebill\" /> resulting in an [[612 Incident|intense standoff]] between the protesters and the police who deployed [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=\"time_20190613_battlefront\" /> An even bigger protest took place on 16 June, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters insisted on the complete withdrawal of the bill and reacted to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12&nbsp;June.<ref name=\"scmp_3014695\" /> The anniversary of the handover on 1&nbsp;July 2019 saw the [[storming of the Legislative Council Complex]],<ref name=\"hkfp_20190701_occupychamber\" /> and subsequent protests throughout the summer spread to different districts.<ref name=\"nyt_20190722_trainstation\" /> Police inaction when suspected triad members [[2019 Yuen Long attack|assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long]] on 21&nbsp;July 2019,<ref name=\"bbc_49074532\" /> the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|police storming of Prince Edward station]] on 31&nbsp;August 2019, and the large-scale demonstrations during the [[70th&nbsp;anniversary of the People's Republic of China]] on 1&nbsp;October, caused further escalation of the protests.<ref name=\"amnesty_20190901_policeprotest\" />\n\nLam eventually withdrew the bill on 4&nbsp;September 2019,<ref name=\"cnn_20190904_withdrawbill\" /><ref name=\"guardian_20190719_extraditionbill\" /><ref name=\"bbc_48917796\" /> but still refused to concede to the other four demands.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], would erode the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the Chinese Communist Party's internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping or snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted on by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representative of Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it on the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries. Of 167 countries, Hong Kong ranked&nbsp;75th while mainland China ranked&nbsp;153rd.<ref name=thestandard215668>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/215668/Hong-Kong-barely-passes-as-%27flawed-democracy%27|title=Hong Kong barely passes as 'flawed democracy'|last=Standard|first=The|website=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracyindex2019|title=Democracy Index 2019 A year of democratic setbacks and popular protest|website=[[Economist Intelligence Unit|EIU.com]]|url-access=registration|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] and the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence movement]] was marked by the campaign for the [[2016 New Territories East by-election]] by activist [[Edward Leung]].<ref name=\"scmp_3021518\" /> As fewer and fewer young people in Hong Kong identified themselves as Chinese, pollsters at the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the younger respondents were, the more distrustful they were of the Chinese government.<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /> By 2019, almost no Hong Kong youth identified themselves as Chinese.<ref name=\"economist_20190826_almostnobody\" /> The [[Moral and National Education controversy]] in 2012 severely shook young people's confidence in the systems which they believed protected their rights. With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire, along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future drove youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> It has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> because, since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> This has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting great influence, Hong Kong also suffers from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city had the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the world in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective was to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10&nbsp;years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to rise, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the police force to be disbanded.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|Police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12&nbsp;June&nbsp;2019.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March 2019 was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill. In response, the Secretary of Security [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] announced that the government would resume second reading of the bill in full council on 12&nbsp;June 2019, bypassing the Bills Committee, whose role would have been to scrutinise it.<ref name=\"scmp_3011104\" />\n\nWith the possibility of a second reading of the bill, the CHRF launched their third protest march on 9&nbsp;June.

Their claim that it was impossible to recognise a person in the video footage was widely criticised.<ref name=\"standardhk_211952\"/>\n\n===Accountability of the HKPF===\nThe [[Independent Police Complaints Council]] (IPCC) launched investigations into alleged incidents of police misconduct during the protests. Protesters demanded an independent commission of inquiry instead, as the members of the IPCC are mainly pro-establishment and it lacks the power to investigate, make definitive judgements, and hand out penalties.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190704_policewatchdog\"/><ref name=\"eji_20190822\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\"/> Carrie Lam rejected this demand and insisted that the IPCC was able to fulfill the task.<ref name=\"scmp_3025948\"/><ref name=\"diplomat_20190725_notjust\"/> On 8&nbsp; November 2019, a five-member expert panel headed by Sir [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]] and appointed by Lam in September 2019 to advise the IPCC, concluded that the police watchdog lacked the \"powers, capacity and independent investigative capability necessary\" to fulfill its role as a police watchdog group and suggested the formation of an independent commission of inquiry given the current protest situation.<ref name=\"hkstandard_136821\"/> Members of the panel quit after negotiations to increase the IPCC's powers fell through. The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while its chair [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel had exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nPolice modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1&nbsp;October 2019 confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any disciplinary measures to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer had been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/> The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequences.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on the economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales had declined and consumers' appetite for spending had decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancel bookings, and certain banks and shops were forced to close their doors. Supplies of goods were also halted or obstructed because of the protests. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Because of lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed shop openings.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Stock of protest supplies such as gas masks ran low in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. The desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions dropped by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce selling prices.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9&nbsp;June 2019 to late August 2019. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012; two large IPOs were shelved in June and July 2019. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to a year earlier,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13&nbsp;August 2019, the Airport Authority cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting. Many mainland tourists avoided travelling to Hong Kong due to safety concerns.

The establishment waited for demonstrators' aggression to increase so they could justify greater militarisation of the police and dismiss the protesters as \"insurgents\" and also their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts formed within the government with Lennon Walls being set up in government offices and civil servants organising rallies.<ref name=\"scmp_3020206\"/>\n\n[[File:P1120823 (49001440122).jpg|thumb|left|A riot police officer holds a blue flag warning the protesters to disperse at an unapproved march.]]\nThe reputation of the police took a serious drubbing following the heavy-handed treatment of protesters.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190625_policeconfusion\"/><ref name=\"standardhk_132961\"/> In October 2019, a survey conducted by CUHK revealed that more than 50% of respondents were deeply dissatisfied with the police's performance.<ref name=\"independent_9158061\"/> According to some reports, their aggressive behaviours and tactics have caused them to become a symbol that represents hostility and suppression.

Protesters demanded that the government fully retract the riot characterisation.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_backdown\"/> Lam's analogy as Hong Kong people's mother attracted criticisms after the violent crackdown on 12&nbsp;June.<ref name=\"standardhk_129667\"/>\n\nLam announced the suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June,<ref name=\"scmp_3014669\"/> and officially apologised to the public on 18&nbsp;June two days after another massive march.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_sincereapologies\"/> In early July, Lam reiterated that the bill \"had passed away\" and reaffirmed that all efforts to amend the law had ceased, though her use of language was thought to be ambiguous.<ref name=\"guardian_20190709_deadbill\"/> During July and August 2019, the government insisted that it would not make any concessions, and that Lam could still lead despite calls asking for her resignation.

'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations.

bill|the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill]] by the [[Hong Kong government]].<ref name=\"bbc_49317695\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190213_trojanhorse\" /> Had it been enacted, the bill would have allowed the [[extradition]] of wanted criminal suspects and criminal fugitives to territories with which [[Hong Kong]] does not currently have extradition agreements, including [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]].<ref name=\"nyt_20190610_whatis\" /> This led to concerns by some that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the jurisdiction and [[Law of the People's Republic of

As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, an investigation into [[Allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct surrounding the 2019 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of all arrested protesters, a retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Carrie Lam]]'s resignation along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] for election of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and the Chief Executive.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\" /><ref name=\"abc_66464962\" />\n\nDespite a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9&nbsp;June 2019, the government persisted with the bill.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"vox_18658650\" /> Protesters gathered outside the [[Legislative Council Complex]] to stall the bill's second reading on 12&nbsp;June,<ref name=\"scmp_3013797\" /><ref name=\"cnbc_20190610\" /><ref name=\"nyt_20190610_carriestandfast\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_20190610_pursuebill\" /> resulting in an [[612 Incident|intense standoff]] between the protesters and the police who deployed [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=\"time_20190613_battlefront\" /> An even bigger protest took place on 16 June, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters insisted on the complete withdrawal of the bill and reacted to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12&nbsp;June.<ref name=\"scmp_3014695\" /> The anniversary of the handover on 1&nbsp;July 2019 saw the [[storming of the Legislative Council Complex]],<ref name=\"hkfp_20190701_occupychamber\" /> and subsequent protests throughout the summer spread to different districts.<ref name=\"nyt_20190722_trainstation\" /> Police inaction when suspected triad members [[2019 Yuen Long attack|assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long]] on 21&nbsp;July 2019,<ref name=\"bbc_49074532\" /> the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|police storming of Prince Edward station]] on 31&nbsp;August 2019, and the large-scale demonstrations during the [[70th&nbsp;anniversary of the People's Republic of China]] on 1&nbsp;October, caused further escalation of the protests.<ref name=\"amnesty_20190901_policeprotest\" />\n\nLam eventually withdrew the bill on 4&nbsp;September 2019,<ref name=\"cnn_20190904_withdrawbill\" /><ref name=\"guardian_20190719_extraditionbill\" /><ref name=\"bbc_48917796\" /> but still refused to concede to the other four demands. Claiming to curb further protests, Lam invoked the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]] on 4&nbsp;October 2019 to implement an [[anti-mask law]], to counterproductive effect.<ref name=\"rthk_1484040\" /> As the protests dragged on, confrontations escalated as both sides became increasingly violent.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], would erode the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the Chinese Communist Party's internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping or snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted on by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representative of Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it on the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries. Of 167 countries, Hong Kong ranked&nbsp;75th while mainland China ranked&nbsp;153rd.<ref name=thestandard215668>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/215668/Hong-Kong-barely-passes-as-%27flawed-democracy%27|title=Hong Kong barely passes as 'flawed democracy'|last=Standard|first=The|website=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracyindex2019|title=Democracy Index 2019 A year of democratic setbacks and popular protest|website=[[Economist Intelligence Unit|EIU.com]]|url-access=registration|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] and the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence movement]] was marked by the campaign for the [[2016 New Territories East by-election]] by activist [[Edward Leung]].<ref name=\"scmp_3021518\" /> As fewer and fewer young people in Hong Kong identified themselves as Chinese, pollsters at the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the younger respondents were, the more distrustful they were of the Chinese government.<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /> By 2019, almost no Hong Kong youth identified themselves as Chinese.<ref name=\"economist_20190826_almostnobody\" /> The [[Moral and National Education controversy]] in 2012 severely shook young people's confidence in the systems which they believed protected their rights. With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire, along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future drove youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> It has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> because, since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> This has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting great influence, Hong Kong also suffers from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city had the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the world in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective was to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10&nbsp;years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to rise, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the police force to be disbanded.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|Police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12&nbsp;June&nbsp;2019.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March 2019 was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill.

The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while its chair [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel had exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nPolice modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1&nbsp;October 2019 confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any disciplinary measures to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer had been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/> The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequences.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on the economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales had declined and consumers' appetite for spending had decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancel bookings, and certain banks and shops were forced to close their doors. Supplies of goods were also halted or obstructed because of the protests. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Because of lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed shop openings.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Stock of protest supplies such as gas masks ran low in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. The desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions dropped by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce selling prices.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9&nbsp;June 2019 to late August 2019. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012; two large IPOs were shelved in June and July 2019. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to a year earlier,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13&nbsp;August 2019, the Airport Authority cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting.

People who opposed the protests in a self-dubbed \"[[silent majority]]\", including wavering sideline supporters and moderates who say that they have been driven away by the violence, argued that protesters were spreading \"chaos and fear\" across the city, causing damage to the economy and harming people not involved in the protests.

conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was 'reaching the end of its life.' Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us. Otherwise the Civil Human Rights Front will plan our next action.'}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"guardian_20190722_thugsgovernment\">{{cite news |last1=Kuo |first1=Lily |title=Hong Kong: why thugs may be

It is also known for its extreme and severe climate, with the lowest temperatures in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] being recorded in [[Verkhoyansk]] and [[Oymyakon]], and regular winter averages commonly being below {{convert|-35|C|F}} in Yakutsk. The hypercontinental tendencies also result in very warm summers for much of the republic.\n\nSakha was first home to [[hunting-gathering]] and [[reindeer herding]] [[Tungusic peoples|Tungusic]] and [[Paleosiberian peoples]] such as the [[Evenks]] and [[Yukaghir]]. Migrating from the area around [[Lake Baikal]], the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Sakha people]] first settled the middle [[Lena river|Lena]] sometime between the 9th and 16th centuries, likely in several waves, bringing the [[pastoralism|pastoral]] economy of [[Central Asia]] with them. Sakha was incorporated as [[Yakutsk Oblast]] into the [[Russian Empire]] in the early-mid 17th century, and the indigenous peoples of the area were made to pay [[yasak]]. While the initial period following Russian conquest saw the Sakha population drop by 70%, the czarist period also saw the expansion of the Sakha ethnic group out of the Middle Lena and along the [[Vilyuy River]], the north, and the east, displacing other indigenous groups. Sakha was home to some of the last fighting in the [[Russian Civil War]], and Yakutsk Oblast was reorganized into the [[Yakut ASSR]] in 1922. The Soviet period saw the migration of many ethnic Russians and Ukrainians into the area. The modern Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) was established in 1991 following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. \n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[exonym]] ''Yakut'' comes from the [[Evenks|Evenk]] term ''Yeket'', which was the term the Evenks used to describe the Sakha. This was in turn picked up by the Russians.<ref>{{cite book |last=Forsyth |first=James |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A History of the Peoples of Siberia: Russia\u2019s North Asian Colony |url= |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=55 |isbn=978-0521477710}}</ref> The name ''Sakha'' is of Turkic origin, \"saqa-saha\" meaning \"cue\" or \"bat\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Sakha Republic Fauna.jpg|thumb|Fauna of the Sakha Republic: [[Ross's gull]], the [[Siberian crane]], [[polar bear]], [[horse]] and [[reindeer]].

These waters, the coldest and iciest of all seas in the Northern Hemisphere, are covered by ice for 9\u201310&nbsp;months of the year. [[New Siberian Islands]] are a part of the republic's territory.  After [[Nunavut]] was separated from Canada's [[Northwest Territories]], Sakha became the [[List of the largest country subdivisions by area|largest subnational entity]] ([[statoid]]) in the world, with an area of {{convert|3083523|km2|sp=us}},<ref name=\"area\" /> slightly smaller than the territory of [[India]] (3.3&nbsp;million km<sup>2</sup>).\n\nSakha can be divided into three great vegetation belts. About 40% of Sakha lies above the [[Arctic circle]] and all of it is covered by [[permafrost]] which greatly influences the region's ecology and limits forests in the southern region. Arctic and subarctic [[tundra]] define the middle region, where [[lichen]] and [[moss]] grow as great green carpets and are favorite pastures for [[reindeer]]. In the southern part of the tundra belt, scattered stands of dwarf [[Siberian pine]] and [[larch]] grow along the rivers. Below the tundra is the vast [[taiga]] forest region. Larch trees dominate in the north and stands of [[fir]] and [[pine tree|pine]] begin to appear in the south. Taiga forests cover about 47% of Sakha and almost 90% of the cover is larch.\n\nThe Sakha Republic is the site of [[Pleistocene Park]], a project directed at recreating Pleistocene tundra grasslands by stimulating the growth of grass with the introduction of animals which thrived in the region during the late [[Pleistocene]]&nbsp;\u2014 early [[Holocene]] period.\n\nIn recent years, global warming has caused the melting of previously frozen soils. Thousands of homes are in danger of collapsing in the mud in summer, while northern villages are overwhelmed by floods.<ref>https://www.lemonde.fr/big-browser/article/2019/03/28/aux-etats-unis-des-centaines-de-villes-croulant-sous-leurs-dechets-ne-recyclent-plus_5442790_4832693.html</ref>\n\n===Time zones===\n[[File:Sakha Yakutia rep.png|right|thumb|250px|Map of Sakha (Yakutia).]]\nSakha Republic is the only subject of Russia which uses more than one time zone.

However, the influx of later settlers had assimilated themselves into the Russian mainstream by the 20th century.\n\n===Russian Empire===\nIn an administrative reform of 1782, [[Irkutsk Governorate]] was created. In 1805, [[Yakutsk Oblast]] was split from Irkutsk Governorate.\n\nYakutsk Oblast in the early 19th century marked the easternmost territory of the Russian Empire, including such [[Russian Far East|Far Eastern]] (Pacific) territories as were acquired, known as [[Okhotsk Okrug]] within Yakutsk Oblast. With the formation of [[Primorskaya Oblast]] in 1856, the Russian territories of the Pacific were detached from Sakha.\n[[File:\u0427\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044b \u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0414\u0443\u043c\u044b 1917.jpeg|thumb|right|Members of the Siberian Regional Duma from Yakutsk, 1917.]]\n\nThe Russians established agriculture in the [[Lena River]] basin. The members of religious groups who were exiled to Sakha in the second half of the 19th century began to grow [[wheat]], [[oat]]s, and [[potato]]es. The [[fur trade]] established a cash economy. Industry and transport began to develop at the end of the 19th century and in the beginning of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period. This was also the beginning of [[geological]] prospecting, [[mining]], and local [[lead]] production. The first steam-powered ships and barges arrived.\n\nSakha's remoteness, even compared to the rest of Siberia, made it a place of exile of choice for both Tsarist and Communist governments of Russia. Among the famous Tsarist-era exiles were the democratic writer [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]]; [[Doukhobor]] [[conscientious objector]]s, whose story was told to [[Leo Tolstoy]] by [[Vasily Nikolaevich Pozdnyakov|Vasily Pozdnyakov]]; the [[Socialist Revolutionary]] and writer [[Vladimir Zenzinov]], who left an interesting account of his Arctic experiences; and Polish socialist activist [[Wac\u0142aw Sieroszewski]], who pioneered in ethnographic research on the Sakha people.\n\nA Sakha national movement first emerged during the [[1905 Revolution]]. A Yakut Union was formed under the leadership of a Sakha lawyer and city councilor by the name of [[Vasily Nikiforov]], which criticized the policies and effects of Russian colonialism, and demanded representation in the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|State Duma]]. The Yakut Union acted to make the city council of Yakutsk stand down and was joined by thousands of Sakha from the countryside, but the leaders were arrested and the movement fizzled out by April 1906. Their demand for a Sakha repsentative in the Duma, however, was granted.<ref>{{cite book |last=Forsyth |first=James |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A History of the Peoples of Siberia: Russia\u2019s North Asian Colony |url= |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=167-168 |isbn=978-0521477710}}</ref>\n\n===Soviet era===\nSakha was home to the last stage of the Russian Civil War, the [[Yakut Revolt]]. \n\nOn April 27, 1922, former Yakutsk Oblast was proclaimed the [[Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Yakut ASSR]], although in fact the eastern part of the territory, including the city of Yakutsk, was controlled by the [[White movement|White Russians]].\n\nSakha experienced significant collectivization [[first five-year plan|between 1929 and 1934]], with the number of households experiencing collectivization rising from 3.6% in 1929 to 41.7% in 1932.

Under the Russians, the local population was converted to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and required to take Orthodox Christian names, but in practice generally continued to follow traditional religions. During the Soviet era, most or all of the shamans died without successors.\n\nIn the 1990s, a neopagan shamanist movement called ''aiyy yeurekh\u00e9'' was founded by the controversial journalist Ivan Ukhkhan and a philologist calling himself T\u00e9ris.<ref>[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rss/28-1_113.pdf Yakutia (Sakha) Faces a Religious Choice: Shamanism or Christianity]</ref> This group and others cooperated to build a shaman temple in downtown Yakutsk in 2002.<ref>[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rss/33-1_057.pdf Whose Steeple is Higher?

As of 2008, Orthodox leaders described the worldview of the republic's indigenous population (or, rather, those among the population who are not completely indifferent to religion) as ''dvoyeverie'' (dual belief system), or a \"tendency toward [[syncretism]]\", as evidenced by the locals sometimes first inviting a shaman, and then an Orthodox priest to carry out their rites in connection with some event in their life.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.taday.ru/text/135461.html\n|title =\u0412 \u042f\u043a\u0443\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0435 (\u0427. 1) (Yakutia is dominated by a dual belief system)|author=\u0415\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0414\u044f\u0442\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 (Yelena Dyatlova)\n|date=October 1, 2008\n|quote=\u0412\u043e \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044f\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0442\u0435\u0445 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0438\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u044f\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0448\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0441\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0448\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430. \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0432 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0434\u043a\u0435, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0445\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0447\u0435\u043c-\u0442\u043e \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0438\u043c \u043f\u043e \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u043a \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0438, \u043d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u044f\u044f. \u0414\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u0442\u0435\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u044f\u043a\u0443\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0438, \u0441 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043c\u044b \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c, \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043a \u0441\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0443 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u043e\u0442\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0432\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043d\u043e.\n}} (An interview with Maxim Kozlov, a Moscow priest who had recently returned from a missionary trip down the Lena along with the Bishop of Yakutsk).</ref>\n\nAccording to the Information Center under the President of Sakha Republic (\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0435 \u0420\u0421(\u042f)), the religious demography of the republic was as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religare.ru/2_43720.html |title=\u0420\u0415\u041b\u0418\u0413\u0410\u0420\u0415 \u2013 \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0435 \u0421\u0430\u0445\u0430 (\u042f\u043a\u0443\u0442\u0438\u044f): \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u044b \u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u044b |publisher=Religare.ru |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> Orthodoxy: 44.9%, Shamanism: 26.2%, Non-religious: 23.0%, New religious movements: 2.4%, Islam: 1.2%, Buddhism: 1.0%, Protestantism: 0.9%, Catholicism: 0.4%.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Eparchy (Diocese) of Yakutia is led by Bishop Roman (Lukin) of Yakutsk (2011).

Retrieved June 15, 2012.</ref> Its [[capital city|capital]] is the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Yakutsk]]. It is also known for its extreme and severe climate, with the lowest temperatures in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] being recorded in [[Verkhoyansk]] and [[Oymyakon]], and regular winter averages commonly being below {{convert|-35|C|F}} in Yakutsk. The hypercontinental tendencies also result in very warm summers for much of the republic.\n\nSakha was first home to [[hunting-gathering]] and [[reindeer herding]] [[Tungusic peoples|Tungusic]] and [[Paleosiberian peoples]] such as the [[Evenks]] and [[Yukaghir]]. Migrating from the area around [[Lake Baikal]], the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Sakha people]] first settled the middle [[Lena river|Lena]] sometime between the 9th and 16th centuries, likely in several waves, bringing the [[pastoralism|pastoral]] economy of [[Central Asia]] with them. Sakha was incorporated as [[Yakutsk Oblast]] into the [[Russian Empire]] in the early-mid 17th century, and the indigenous peoples of the area were made to pay [[yasak]]. While the initial period following Russian conquest saw the Sakha population drop by 70%, the czarist period also saw the expansion of the Sakha ethnic group out of the Middle Lena and along the [[Vilyuy River]], the north, and the east, displacing other indigenous groups. Sakha was home to some of the last fighting in the [[Russian Civil War]], and Yakutsk Oblast was reorganized into the [[Yakut ASSR]] in 1922. The Soviet period saw the migration of many ethnic Russians and Ukrainians into the area. The modern Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) was established in 1991 following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. \n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[exonym]] ''Yakut'' comes from the [[Evenks|Evenk]] term ''Yeket'', which was the term the Evenks used to describe the Sakha. This was in turn picked up by the Russians.<ref>{{cite book |last=Forsyth |first=James |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A History of the Peoples of Siberia: Russia\u2019s North Asian Colony |url= |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=55 |isbn=978-0521477710}}</ref> The name ''Sakha'' is of Turkic origin, \"saqa-saha\" meaning \"cue\" or \"bat\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Sakha Republic Fauna.jpg|thumb|Fauna of the Sakha Republic: [[Ross's gull]], the [[Siberian crane]], [[polar bear]], [[horse]] and [[reindeer]].

These waters, the coldest and iciest of all seas in the Northern Hemisphere, are covered by ice for 9\u201310&nbsp;months of the year. [[New Siberian Islands]] are a part of the republic's territory.  After [[Nunavut]] was separated from Canada's [[Northwest Territories]], Sakha became the [[List of the largest country subdivisions by area|largest subnational entity]] ([[statoid]]) in the world, with an area of {{convert|3083523|km2|sp=us}},<ref name=\"area\" /> slightly smaller than the territory of [[India]] (3.3&nbsp;million km<sup>2</sup>).\n\nSakha can be divided into three great vegetation belts. About 40% of Sakha lies above the [[Arctic circle]] and all of it is covered by [[permafrost]] which greatly influences the region's ecology and limits forests in the southern region. Arctic and subarctic [[tundra]] define the middle region, where [[lichen]] and [[moss]] grow as great green carpets and are favorite pastures for [[reindeer]]. In the southern part of the tundra belt, scattered stands of dwarf [[Siberian pine]] and [[larch]] grow along the rivers. Below the tundra is the vast [[taiga]] forest region. Larch trees dominate in the north and stands of [[fir]] and [[pine tree|pine]] begin to appear in the south. Taiga forests cover about 47% of Sakha and almost 90% of the cover is larch.\n\nThe Sakha Republic is the site of [[Pleistocene Park]], a project directed at recreating Pleistocene tundra grasslands by stimulating the growth of grass with the introduction of animals which thrived in the region during the late [[Pleistocene]]&nbsp;\u2014 early [[Holocene]] period.\n\nIn recent years, global warming has caused the melting of previously frozen soils. Thousands of homes are in danger of collapsing in the mud in summer, while northern villages are overwhelmed by floods.<ref>https://www.lemonde.fr/big-browser/article/2019/03/28/aux-etats-unis-des-centaines-de-villes-croulant-sous-leurs-dechets-ne-recyclent-plus_5442790_4832693.html</ref>\n\n===Time zones===\n[[File:Sakha Yakutia rep.png|right|thumb|250px|Map of Sakha (Yakutia).]]\nSakha Republic is the only subject of Russia which uses more than one time zone.

However, the influx of later settlers had assimilated themselves into the Russian mainstream by the 20th century.\n\n===Russian Empire===\nIn an administrative reform of 1782, [[Irkutsk Governorate]] was created. In 1805, [[Yakutsk Oblast]] was split from Irkutsk Governorate.\n\nYakutsk Oblast in the early 19th century marked the easternmost territory of the Russian Empire, including such [[Russian Far East|Far Eastern]] (Pacific) territories as were acquired, known as [[Okhotsk Okrug]] within Yakutsk Oblast. With the formation of [[Primorskaya Oblast]] in 1856, the Russian territories of the Pacific were detached from Sakha.\n[[File:\u0427\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044b \u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0414\u0443\u043c\u044b 1917.jpeg|thumb|right|Members of the Siberian Regional Duma from Yakutsk, 1917.]]\n\nThe Russians established agriculture in the [[Lena River]] basin. The members of religious groups who were exiled to Sakha in the second half of the 19th century began to grow [[wheat]], [[oat]]s, and [[potato]]es. The [[fur trade]] established a cash economy. Industry and transport began to develop at the end of the 19th century and in the beginning of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period. This was also the beginning of [[geological]] prospecting, [[mining]], and local [[lead]] production. The first steam-powered ships and barges arrived.\n\nSakha's remoteness, even compared to the rest of Siberia, made it a place of exile of choice for both Tsarist and Communist governments of Russia. Among the famous Tsarist-era exiles were the democratic writer [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]]; [[Doukhobor]] [[conscientious objector]]s, whose story was told to [[Leo Tolstoy]] by [[Vasily Nikolaevich Pozdnyakov|Vasily Pozdnyakov]]; the [[Socialist Revolutionary]] and writer [[Vladimir Zenzinov]], who left an interesting account of his Arctic experiences; and Polish socialist activist [[Wac\u0142aw Sieroszewski]], who pioneered in ethnographic research on the Sakha people.\n\nA Sakha national movement first emerged during the [[1905 Revolution]]. A Yakut Union was formed under the leadership of a Sakha lawyer and city councilor by the name of [[Vasily Nikiforov]], which criticized the policies and effects of Russian colonialism, and demanded representation in the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|State Duma]]. The Yakut Union acted to make the city council of Yakutsk stand down and was joined by thousands of Sakha from the countryside, but the leaders were arrested and the movement fizzled out by April 1906. Their demand for a Sakha repsentative in the Duma, however, was granted.<ref>{{cite book |last=Forsyth |first=James |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A History of the Peoples of Siberia: Russia\u2019s North Asian Colony |url= |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=167-168 |isbn=978-0521477710}}</ref>\n\n===Soviet era===\nSakha was home to the last stage of the Russian Civil War, the [[Yakut Revolt]]. \n\nOn April 27, 1922, former Yakutsk Oblast was proclaimed the [[Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Yakut ASSR]], although in fact the eastern part of the territory, including the city of Yakutsk, was controlled by the [[White movement|White Russians]].\n\nSakha experienced significant collectivization [[first five-year plan|between 1929 and 1934]], with the number of households experiencing collectivization rising from 3.6% in 1929 to 41.7% in 1932.

Under the Russians, the local population was converted to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and required to take Orthodox Christian names, but in practice generally continued to follow traditional religions. During the Soviet era, most or all of the shamans died without successors.\n\nIn the 1990s, a neopagan shamanist movement called ''aiyy yeurekh\u00e9'' was founded by the controversial journalist Ivan Ukhkhan and a philologist calling himself T\u00e9ris.<ref>[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rss/28-1_113.pdf Yakutia (Sakha) Faces a Religious Choice: Shamanism or Christianity]</ref> This group and others cooperated to build a shaman temple in downtown Yakutsk in 2002.<ref>[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rss/33-1_057.pdf Whose Steeple is Higher?

The list focuses on the main indicative types of taxes: [[corporate tax]], [[Income tax|individual income tax]], and [[sales tax]], including [[Value-added tax|VAT and GST]], but does not list [[capital gains tax]].\n\nSome other taxes (for instance [[property tax]], substantial in many countries, such as the United States) and [[payroll tax]] are not shown here. The table is not exhaustive in representing the true tax burden to either the corporation or the individual in the listed country. The tax rates displayed are marginal and do not account for deductions, exemptions or rebates. The effective rate is usually lower than the marginal rate. The tax rates given for [[federation]]s (such as the United States and Canada) are averages and vary depending on the state or province. Territories that have different rates to their respective nation are in italics.\n\n== Tax rates by countries and territories ==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col;\"

Sales Taxes]]\n\nA comparison of [[tax rate]]s by countries is difficult and somewhat subjective, as [[tax law]]s in most countries are extremely complex and the [[Tax incidence|tax burden]] falls differently on different groups in each country and sub-national unit. The list focuses on the main indicative types of taxes: [[corporate tax]], [[Income tax|individual income tax]], and [[sales tax]], including [[Value-added tax|VAT and GST]], but does not list [[capital gains tax]].\n\nSome other taxes (for instance [[property tax]], substantial in many countries, such as the United States) and [[payroll tax]] are not shown here. The table is not exhaustive in representing the true tax burden to either the corporation or the individual in the listed country. The tax rates displayed are marginal and do not account for deductions, exemptions or rebates. The effective rate is usually lower than the marginal rate. The tax rates given for [[federation]]s (such as the United States and Canada) are averages and vary depending on the state or province. Territories that have different rates to their respective nation are in italics.\n\n== Tax rates by countries and territories ==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col;\"

Massacre of the [[Jews of Poland]], [[Belarus]], and today's Ukraine occurred throughout the rebellion, which lasted for many years and during the [[Russo-Polish War]] (1654-1667) and the small northern war with the [[Swedish Empire]] that ignited them. Nevertheless, the sudden destruction of many communities from the beginning of April\u2013May 1648 (Iyar 1848), until the cessation of the Cossacks' progress in November of that year, is the named source. According to the historian Adam Teller: \"In the Jewish collective memory, the events in the summer and autumn of 1648 define the uprising in general, and therefore the riots were known as the 1848s.\" Thousands were slaughtered or died of starvation and epidemics, and many others fled, sold into slavery, or converted. The number of Jews killed by the Cossack rebels in 1648 was estimated at a few thousand to 20,000 at most; It is estimated that all the parties - the Cossacks, the Russians, the Swedes, their allies and the Poles themselves who massacred them on suspicion of collaborating with the invaders - killed between 40,000 and 50,000 Jews in total.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1569, with the establishment of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], large land tracts (of today's Ukraine) were transferred from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] to the rule of the Kingdom of Poland. The aristocracy, which enjoyed independence and even chose the king, controlled the area that had been ruled until then by the [[Tatars]] from the [[Crimea]]. In the territories western to the [[Dnieper River]], tens of thousands of people from the rest of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] came to settle down. The great [[Magnates]], which most of them were descendants of the local aristocracy, established vast agricultural estates and imposed strict rules on the local Ruthenian peasants.\n\nAmong the settlers, there were many [[Jews]]. They were pushed from [[Poland]] itself under the pressure of city residents who wanted to reduce the economic competition. Many of the [[Jews]] were employed by the nobility as [[leases]] and estate managers. Dozens of new communities were established in [[Ukraine]], mainly on the right bank (western area) of the [[Dnieper]]. The eastern side was a somewhat wild area. It was closer to the [[Crimea]] and dangerous to settlement, although some estates and cities were there and drew [[Jews]] looking for jobs. Southern to where the river bends, lived the [[Cossacks]] from the  [[Zaporozhian Sich]], a semi-nomadic society that maintained a routine of constant fighting with the [[Tatars]]. The [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] maintained strained relations with the [[Cossacks]] and tried to subordinate them to its authority while exploiting them for military usage.\n\nThe nobility mercilessly brutalized the general population and especially the [[serfs]]. The economic and social tension, which also led to strong hostility towards Jewish lessees, had gotten worse due to religious reasons. At the end of the 16th century, in the framework of the counter-reformation, the [[Jesuits]] have reached the area. Although they intended to fight any manifestation of Protestantism, they soon turned their attention to the [[Ruthenians]], which almost all were Orthodox Christians. [[Sigismund III Vasa]] (King Sigismund III) was a devout Catholic, as were most of the Polish nobles. Under these pressures, many of the [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] nobles converted to Catholicism. Similar attempts, which were also expressed in establishing a local Uniate church and the persecution of Orthodox priests who refused to join it, were made towards the common people. The local's rage for all this was quickly channeled into acts of rebellion led by the [[Cossacks]], who were experienced fighters and they rebelled eight times between 1592 and 1638.\n\nIn the 19th century, with the creation of [[Ukrainian nationalism]], many historians tried to describe the conflict between a local [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] independence movement and foreign Polish nobility and its Jewish servants. The great [[Magnates]] in the region were, in fact, mostly Catholics or Unites, but they were descendants of the original inhabitants, such as the [[Ostrogski family]]. The [[Voivode]] [[Jeremi Wi\u015bniowiecki]] (the Vishnotzky Duke of the book \" The Abyss of Despair (Yeven Metzulah)\", in Hebrew: \u05d9\u05d5\u05b5\u05df \u05de\u05b0\u05e6\u05d5\u05bc\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4) was the son of a well-known Orthodox family and converted to Catholicism at the age of 20. There are reports of cooperation between Jews and locals against the nobility and the Jews participation in Cossack raids. Like all the townspeople in the area, the Jews were obliged to participate in defensing the towns in case of a siege. In the East Bank, many were obliged to carry the weapon in case of Tartar attacks.\n\n== The Events ==\n\n=== The Outbreak of the Uprising ===\n{{Main|1=Khmelnytsky Uprising}}One of the victims of the landowners was a local junior nobleman named Bogdan Khmelnytsky. In early 1647, his property and his intended fianc\u00e9 were taken (and according to a single report, his ten-year-old son was murdered) by Daniel Czaplinski, apparently the deputy of the magnate Alexander Koniecpolski. When Bogdan Khmelnytsky turned to the courts and didn\u2019t receive any response, a great rebellion began to develop, which was much bigger the previous ones.\n\nIn the spring of 1648, Khmelnitsky, who was appointed to be the Ataman (officer) of the Zapurozi, led an army of Cossacks against the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. He made an alliance with the Tatars, who provided him with 4,000 cavalry under the command of Tugai Bay. In April he crossed the Dnieper with his army and won two crushing victories against the crown forces, one on the Yellow River on May 15 and the other in Kurson on the 26th.\n\nThe news of his victories sparked a huge uprising among the people throughout the country. The Cossacks and the masses massacred the Jews, nobles, Catholics, and Uniates wherever they reached. The disturbances spread to southern of today's Belarus, and the Cossack troops reached Pinsk. The eastern bank of the Dnieper, where the population was almost entirely Orthodox and the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth's presence was weak, fell without a real struggle. The following day after the victory in Kurson, on the first day of Shavuot (a Jewish holiday), on May 27, 1648, began a mass deportation of the Jews in the surrounding districts to the fortified cities, desecrating the holiday. About the same time, Yirmi Vishniewiecki withdrew from his estates in Lubny with his own army and took with him several hundred of Jews along with the other refugees. He kept gathering Jewish people on the way.\n\nNathan Neta Hanover, whose book \" ''The Abyss of Despair (Yeven Metzulah)'' \" is the best-known chronicle of events, described what he heard about the riots in the eastern bank that fell into the hands of the rebels:\n\n{{Quote|text=\"many communities beyond the Dnieper, and close to the battle field, such as Pereyaslaw, Baryszowka, Piratyn, and Boryspole, Lubin and Lachowce and their neighbors, who were unable to escape, perished for the sanctification of His Name. These persons died cruel and bitter deaths. Some were skinned alive and their flesh was thrown to the dogs; some had their hands and limbs chopped off, and their bodies thrown on the highway only to be trampled by wagons and crushed by horses; some has wounds inflicted upon them, and thrown on the street to die a slow death; they writhed in their blood until they breathed their last; others were buried alive. The enemy slaughtered infants in the laps of their mothers. They were sliced into pieces like fish. They slashed the bellies of pregnant women, removed their infants and tossed them in their faces. Some women had their bellies torn open and live cats placed in them. The bellies were then sewed up with the living cats remaining within. They chopped off the hands of the victims so that they would not be able to remove the cats from the bellies. The infants were hung on the breasts of their mothers. Some children were pierced with spears, roasted on the fire and then brought to their mothers to be eaten. Many times they used the bodies of Jewish children as improvised bridges upon which they later crossed. There was no cruel device of murder in the whole world that was not perpetrated by the enemies.\"|sign=[[Nathan Neta Hanover]]|source=\"[[The Abyss of Despair (Yeven Metzulah)]]\", chapter IV}}\n\nOn the first day of June, Khmelnitsky's main camp was stopped at Bila Sarkawa and ceased moving westward. Yet, the masses in the territories that remained under the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth control continued to rebel. Some atamans (officers) Cossack, with the most dominant of them all- Maxim Krivonos, used their forces to support the acts of rebellion. On the tenth of June, 1648, Krivonos conquered the city of Nemyriv, where a large Jewish population had fortified. According to Hanover and other record-writers, he pretended to be a friendly force and flew flags of the Crown Army, while Cossack sources reported from inside. As soon as Nemyriv fell, the Cossacks slaughtered all the Catholics and the Jews inside. Hanover reported 6,000 Jews killed, an improbable number which was denied by modern historians but still provides a measure of destruction. Mordechai Nadav noted that events of the size of that in Pinsk, in which several dozen Jews were apparently killed during the invasion, were more typical of the events. Similar massacres took place in many other cities, such as Polona and Bar. In Nemyriv, the Jewish chronologists noted a mass refusal of Jews to offer the slaughterers to convert to Christianity and to be saved, although at the same time the Shakh (Shabbatai ben Meir HaKohen) wrote that \"many Jews violated the covenant.\" A group of Jews which swore allegiance to the Cossacks and converted to Christianity rescued itself from the city after a short time, when Nemyriv fell into the hands of Vishniewitzky.\n\nOn June 18, Krivonos began a siege of Tulchyn, and broke through the wall on the 21st. The next day the fort fell. Then there was a time-out for several days and on June 26 the massacre took place. Hanover and others argued that the local commander, Duke Janusz Chetvartinsky, betrayed the Jews and gave them to the rioters while trying in vain to save his own life. Israel Halperin determined that there was no evidence of this and Chturtinsky probably tried to release all those who were inside by means of a bribe, but the Cossacks killed them all. He believed that the source of the rumor was because Cheturtinsky belonged to a devout Orthodox family and that is why the Catholics suspected him. Hannover noted that Jews were also offered to convert to Christianity, but they rejected it and chose death for the sanctification of God's Name. The historian Yechezkel Feram rejected Hannover's description and claimed that Hanover based on another person's testimony. Fram believed that the description was a distortion of the story \"cliff of the times\" about a similar sanction in Hommel that took place at the same time, on the 20th of June, 1648. Meir Meshbreshin reported that several rabbis urged the people to surrender and not to convert, and all of them were slaughtered, but this event is doubted as well.\n\nOthers like Hanover tended to link the sanctions of 1848-1988 to the Ashkenazi Kiddush tradition of the Middle Ages, from events such as the 1096 decrees of Blois from 1171. The day Nemyriv was conquered, 10 June 1648, is also the Memorial Day In memory of the victims of the Cossacks. Yet, there were no similar events like the mass suicide in the days of the Crusaders in 1650. Historian Jacob Katz tended to associate this to the erosion of the ideal of Kiddush Hashem (the sanctification of God's name through martyrdom) in the past centuries, but Feram wrote that it remained as strong as ever. The difference between the riots was due to external circumstances. Unlike the Crusaders, the rebellious Ruthenians had no organized policy of conversion: they classified anyone who was not Orthodox as an enemy, but did not intended to spread their own faith. Also, there are reports of Jews who converted to Christianity voluntarily and still were killed. The Eastern Church had no direct connection with the rioters. For their part, they dealt with looting and killing for their own sake, nobility, Catholics and Uniates as Jews. Paul of Aleppo, who visited the country a few years later, told of a desire for extermination. Even the masses, who were not familiar with the halakhic elements of the hour of annihilation but were well aware of the principle of a long tradition, viewed the events as a politic class struggle rather than an attempt to convert them, as many reports indicate, both from the chronicles and from testimonies to the courts after everything happened.\n\nIn September the noble armies suffered a heavy defeat in the Battle of Filabetsi, and in fact, there was no significant force remained until Warsaw itself. Khmelnytsky advanced toward Lviv and Zamo\u015b\u0107. In Lviv, the city's residents were offered to extradite the Jews in return for lifting the siege, but they refused. As in all other cities, the Jews took part in its defense. At the end of November, fearing a prolonged battle in the winter and after the new Polish-Lithuanian king offered him extensive concessions, Khmelnitsky retreated to Kiev. The fighting resumed at the end of May 1649, and continued intermittently for years to come. Large-scale killings were carried out against the Ukrainian Jews and the parts of Belarus that fell into the hands of the rebels. The number of people who converted to Christianity, which many of them kept their new religion even after the conquest of their homes by the crown's faithful soldiers, was big enough that on the 2nd of May, 1650, King Jan Kazimierz gave a special order that allows all those who wished it to return to Judaism. Many were captured by the Tartars. Among the Jews, it was thought that the Tartars were interested in any Jew in order to sell them in slavery markets. However, they often wanted only slaves who would provide a worthwhile price. These included young women, men of working age and children. There were cases in which the Ruthenian masses rejected the attempts to sell them slaves who were not included among these classifications. It was also reported that the elderly and other non-wanted slaves were separated from the captured prisoners and burned alive so that they would not burden the caravans. However, the Tartars did not take part in the massacres known as Tulchyn and Nemyriv; these were the work of Maksym Kryvonis. The Cossacks themselves did not take slaves but killed those who fell into their hands. The Jewish communities joined forces in the efforts to redeem the Jewish slaves, which were located mainly in the large market in Constantinople. Large donations were made throughout the Jewish world: a special tax was imposed by the Council of Four Lands in areas not affected by the revolt, the Karaites in the Ottoman capital raised donations, and the main help came from a slavery-redeeming company in Venice whose emissaries came as far as Hamburg and Amsterdam to request charity. With these funds and its official delegate, the community of Constantinople redeemed 1,500 people by July 1651, in exchange for a total amount of 150,000 Spanish reais. The stream then decreased and in total there were 2,000 redeemed people in 1648, some in distant markets such as Persia and Algiers.\n\nThe number of Jewish victims was evaluated as great. Samuel Ben-Nathan Feidel, in his book from 1650, counted 281 communities destroyed and claimed that six hundred thousand Jews were killed. The Shakh on the other hand, noted that there were one thousand. Menashe Ben Israel wrote to Oliver Cromwell that there were one hundred and eighty thousand. Although in the 20th century, Isaac Schifer estimated that there were three hundred thousand killed or taken prisoner from 1648 to -1655. Modern research has greatly reduced estimates of the victims of the massacres: Professor Shmuel Ettinger estimated the entire Jewish population of Ukraine in 1648 at -51,325 persons, based on documents from that period. Prof. Shaul Stampfer claimed that there were 40,000, stating that \"'''at most 50% (20,000) and perhaps much less'''\" than those who died at the outbreak of the revolt in 1648.\n\n===  Additional disputes  ===\nIn 1654 Tsardom of Russia gave Suzerainty to Khmelnytsky and their armies invaded together into the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, both in Ukraine and in the north, in Belarus and Lithuania. At the beginning of August 1655 Vilna fell into the hands of the occupier and a mass slaughter was carried out, although the reports showed that most of the Jews had managed to escape in time. In October, Lublin was captured, where the chronicles cite about 2,000 Jews who died. It was the greatest disaster of the new battle. The historian Dov Weinryb, based both on Polish records and on personal reports, stated that the correct number was probably several hundred. The Russians also tended to take many prisoners, and a new wave of Jewish slaves reached the markets in 1665 and 1656. Once again, a great effort began to raise funds for their redemption.\n\nIn the summer of 1655 invaded a new enemy to the republic, the Swedish Empire led by King Carl Gustav. This war was the most destructive of all the struggles between Poland and Lithuania. It is still estimated to be worse than World War II in terms of the relative damage caused to the country. In what became known as the \"Swedish Flood,\" the most affluent and populated areas of Poland were completely destroyed. The circumstances led to great hunger that year. Jewish reports staged the invaders as sympathetic towards them. Although they did not take special action against them except for a random killing, many Jews, together with the rest of the people, died of starvation, epidemics and sword. For example, the Jewish quarter of Kazimierz in Krak\u00f3w was completely destroyed by the siege on the city in September\u2013October 1655 and the survivors fled to Bohemia and Moravia.\n\nThe Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth was almost collapsing: Many nobles believed that Karl Gustav would do them good and change sides with their armies. The magnate Janusz Radziwi\u0142\u0142 swore allegiance in return for protection from the Russians and cut off Lithuania from the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. But the scales were tipped by the massacres and looting of the Swedes, and especially by the awakening of Catholic sentiment with the successful defense of the Jesna Gora Monastery since November. The Pi\u0142sudski (a family of nobility that originated in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and increased in notability under the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Second Polish Republic) began to resent the Swedish king, who neglected their affairs, and most of them renewed their loyalty to Jan Kazimierz. The masses of the people and the minor nobility, headed by Hetman Stefan Czerniecki, launched a guerilla war against the Lutheran conquerors. In the fall of 1656, the Czar estimated that Sweden might become too strong and started supporting the King of Poland.\n\nThe rebels, driven also by the betrayal of the Calvinist Radziwill, ran what they perceived as a struggle for the Catholic Church. Lutherans, Calvinists, neo-Aryans, Orthodox and Jews were all marked as enemies and suspected of collaborating with the Swedes. Different militias and the Crown Forces massacred them frequently. On January 22, 1656, the king confiscated the remains of Kazimierz and gave all the looting that could be extracted from it to the army after declaring that the Jews had cooperated with the enemy. In February 1656, Czerniecki killed 600 Jews, according to the records, when he liberated Sandomierz Castle. Poland, Lithuania and Sweden signed a peace agreement in 1660, and the fighting between the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and Moscow resumed. It continued on a relatively limited scale until signing the Truce of Andrusovo Agreement in 1667, which brought tranquility to the kingdom for the first time in 19 years. The Lithuanian communities paid a large sum to include in the contract a clause allowing all Jewish prisoners in Russia, with the exception of converts and women who were married, to return home.\n\nThe historian Dov Weinryb wrote that according to records about the size of Jewish communities in the 1970s and 1980s, which together with other data indicate that many survived by conversion or immigration, \"a reasonable estimate\" of all Jews killed - By the sword, by all sides, and by epidemics and famine - during the turbulent period that swept Poland from 1648 to 1677, \"will be between 40,000 and 50,000, although historians point to far larger estimates, which are high enough to include between a fifth and a quarter of the Jewish population In Poland and Lithuania on the eve of the uprising. \"\n\n===  Following the Sanctions  ===\n[[File:Hebrewbooks_org_42621_520.jpg|right|thumb|312x312px|''\"El Maleh Rahamim\"'' in memory of the victims of the sanctions of 1096 and the sanctions of the Cossack riots.]]\nThe chaos that was in Poland following the sanctions brought the leaders of the communities and their rabbis into taking steps regarding the welfare of the refugees, both in material aid and in halachic discussions to allow a second marriage to women whose husbands had been lost. The problem of women whose husbands had been lost reached distant courts in communities where captives were redeemed and wanted to remarry. In Cairo, in a case cited in the \"Divrei Noam\", a group of women sent a messenger to Poland who returned with divorce documents from all their husbands.\n\nThe generation who lived at that time debated the question whether the sanctions were shedding clean blood for the sins of the House of Israel or punishment from god. Many adopted the first statement, but pamphlets published in Europe blamed the Polish Jewry of committing sins such as: loan interest, Folk distribution of Kabbalah books to the masses, raising pigs for non-Jews, lawlessness and more. The massive flight to the west also led to the renewed growth of the Holy Roman Empire as an important Torah center, after years of standing in the shadow of its neighbor to the east. Researchers in the past have frequently related the pogroms as a catalyst for the rise of Sabbateanism. Sarah, the wife of Shabtai Zvi, also became orphaned during it. Although this assertion lost its validity over time, Israel Halpern believed that the effort to raise funds for the redemption of captives throughout the continent hastened the horrific news of the events to the entire Diaspora and played an important role.\n\nIn memory of the heavy mourning, the rabbis decreed banquets and fancy costumes. Wearing silk and velvet was forbidden for three years. Women were forbidden to wear gold chains and gems for three years. It was forbidden to sing songs of joy for one year, except for wedding ceremonies, and the authority was given by the leaders of each community to extend the validity of the prohibitions for additional years.\n\nIn February 1650 The Council of Four Lands assembled in Lublin, where it was declared that the Memorial Day for the sanctions in Blois and for the day that nemyriv fell will be on the 10th of June, 1648 (20th of Sivan- a month from the Jewish calendar) In memory of the victims. Lamentations and special prayers were written to be said on this day. Rabbi Yom Tov Lipman Heller then corrected the lament of ''\"Ella Ezekara in Third Tears\"'' for those who perished. In addition, various versions of the prayer ''\"El Malei Rachamim\"'' (a Jewish prayer for the soul of a person who has died, usually recited at the graveside during the burial service and at memorial services during the year) were also composed, to be recited on the 20th of Sivan, on Yom Kippur, on the Sabbath preceding Shavuot and on Shabbat Chazon.\n\nDespite its many inaccuracies, ''\"Abyss of Despair\"'' has become a historical memory because of the high quality of Hanover's writing. It was published in more than twenty editions in several languages, and remained a major source until the 20th century. The sanctions of 1648 are mentioned in several literary works in Hebrew. The most famous of them are: ''\"The Slave\"'' by Isaac Bashevis Singer, ''\"The Nazarene\"'' by Shalom Asch, ''\"A City In Its Fullness\"'' by SY Agnon and the Ballad ''\"the Rabbi's daughter\"'' by Shaul Tchernichovsky.\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Amelia Glaser (editor).

Massacre of the [[Jews of Poland]], [[Belarus]], and today's Ukraine occurred throughout the rebellion, which lasted for many years and during the [[Russo-Polish War]] (1654-1667) and the small northern war with the [[Swedish Empire]] that ignited them. Nevertheless, the sudden destruction of many communities from the beginning of April\u2013May 1648 (Iyar 1848), until the cessation of the Cossacks' progress in November of that year, is the named source. According to the historian Adam Teller: \"In the Jewish collective memory, the events in the summer and autumn of 1648 define the uprising in general, and therefore the riots were known as the 1848s.\" Thousands were slaughtered or died of starvation and epidemics, and many others fled, sold into slavery, or converted. The number of Jews killed by the Cossack rebels in 1648 was estimated at a few thousand to 20,000 at most; It is estimated that all the parties - the Cossacks, the Russians, the Swedes, their allies and the Poles themselves who massacred them on suspicion of collaborating with the invaders - killed between 40,000 and 50,000 Jews in total.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1569, with the establishment of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], large land tracts (of today's Ukraine) were transferred from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] to the rule of the Kingdom of Poland. The aristocracy, which enjoyed independence and even chose the king, controlled the area that had been ruled until then by the [[Tatars]] from the [[Crimea]]. In the territories western to the [[Dnieper River]], tens of thousands of people from the rest of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] came to settle down. The great [[Magnates]], which most of them were descendants of the local aristocracy, established vast agricultural estates and imposed strict rules on the local Ruthenian peasants.\n\nAmong the settlers, there were many [[Jews]]. They were pushed from [[Poland]] itself under the pressure of city residents who wanted to reduce the economic competition. Many of the [[Jews]] were employed by the nobility as [[leases]] and estate managers. Dozens of new communities were established in [[Ukraine]], mainly on the right bank (western area) of the [[Dnieper]]. The eastern side was a somewhat wild area. It was closer to the [[Crimea]] and dangerous to settlement, although some estates and cities were there and drew [[Jews]] looking for jobs. Southern to where the river bends, lived the [[Cossacks]] from the  [[Zaporozhian Sich]], a semi-nomadic society that maintained a routine of constant fighting with the [[Tatars]]. The [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] maintained strained relations with the [[Cossacks]] and tried to subordinate them to its authority while exploiting them for military usage.\n\nThe nobility mercilessly brutalized the general population and especially the [[serfs]]. The economic and social tension, which also led to strong hostility towards Jewish lessees, had gotten worse due to religious reasons. At the end of the 16th century, in the framework of the counter-reformation, the [[Jesuits]] have reached the area. Although they intended to fight any manifestation of Protestantism, they soon turned their attention to the [[Ruthenians]], which almost all were Orthodox Christians. [[Sigismund III Vasa]] (King Sigismund III) was a devout Catholic, as were most of the Polish nobles. Under these pressures, many of the [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] nobles converted to Catholicism. Similar attempts, which were also expressed in establishing a local Uniate church and the persecution of Orthodox priests who refused to join it, were made towards the common people. The local's rage for all this was quickly channeled into acts of rebellion led by the [[Cossacks]], who were experienced fighters and they rebelled eight times between 1592 and 1638.\n\nIn the 19th century, with the creation of [[Ukrainian nationalism]], many historians tried to describe the conflict between a local [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] independence movement and foreign Polish nobility and its Jewish servants. The great [[Magnates]] in the region were, in fact, mostly Catholics or Unites, but they were descendants of the original inhabitants, such as the [[Ostrogski family]]. The [[Voivode]] [[Jeremi Wi\u015bniowiecki]] (the Vishnotzky Duke of the book \" The Abyss of Despair (Yeven Metzulah)\", in Hebrew: \u05d9\u05d5\u05b5\u05df \u05de\u05b0\u05e6\u05d5\u05bc\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4) was the son of a well-known Orthodox family and converted to Catholicism at the age of 20. There are reports of cooperation between Jews and locals against the nobility and the Jews participation in Cossack raids. Like all the townspeople in the area, the Jews were obliged to participate in defensing the towns in case of a siege. In the East Bank, many were obliged to carry the weapon in case of Tartar attacks.\n\n== The Events ==\n\n=== The Outbreak of the Uprising ===\n{{Main|1=Khmelnytsky Uprising}}One of the victims of the landowners was a local junior nobleman named Bogdan Khmelnytsky. In early 1647, his property and his intended fianc\u00e9 were taken (and according to a single report, his ten-year-old son was murdered) by Daniel Czaplinski, apparently the deputy of the magnate Alexander Koniecpolski. When Bogdan Khmelnytsky turned to the courts and didn\u2019t receive any response, a great rebellion began to develop, which was much bigger the previous ones.\n\nIn the spring of 1648, Khmelnitsky, who was appointed to be the Ataman (officer) of the Zapurozi, led an army of Cossacks against the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. He made an alliance with the Tatars, who provided him with 4,000 cavalry under the command of Tugai Bay. In April he crossed the Dnieper with his army and won two crushing victories against the crown forces, one on the Yellow River on May 15 and the other in Kurson on the 26th.\n\nThe news of his victories sparked a huge uprising among the people throughout the country. The Cossacks and the masses massacred the Jews, nobles, Catholics, and Uniattes wherever they reached. The disturbances spread to southern of today's Belarus, and the Cossack troops reached Pinsk. The eastern bank of the Dnieper, where the population was almost entirely Orthodox and the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth's presence was weak, fell without a real struggle. The following day after the victory in Kurson, on the first day of Shavuot (a Jewish holiday), on May 27, 1648, began a mass deportation of the Jews in the surrounding districts to the fortified cities, desecrating the holiday. About the same time, Yirmi Vishniewiecki withdrew from his estates in Lubny with his own army and took with him several hundred of Jews along with the other refugees. He kept gathering Jewish people on the way.\n\nNathan Neta Hanover, whose book \" ''The Abyss of Despair (Yeven Metzulah)'' \" is the best-known chronicle of events, described what he heard about the riots in the eastern bank that fell into the hands of the rebels:\n\n{{Quote|text=\"many communities beyond the Dnieper, and close to the battle field, such as Pereyaslaw, Baryszowka, Piratyn, and Boryspole, Lubin and Lachowce and their neighbors, who were unable to escape, perished for the sanctification of His Name. These persons died cruel and bitter deaths. Some were skinned alive and their flesh was thrown to the dogs; some had their hands and limbs chopped off, and their bodies thrown on the highway only to be trampled by wagons and crushed by horses; some has wounds inflicted upon them, and thrown on the street to die a slow death; they writhed in their blood until they breathed their last; others were buried alive. The enemy slaughtered infants in the laps of their mothers. They were sliced into pieces like fish. They slashed the bellies of pregnant women, removed their infants and tossed them in their faces. Some women had their bellies torn open and live cats placed in them. The bellies were then sewed up with the living cats remaining within. They chopped off the hands of the victims so that they would not be able to remove the cats from the bellies. The infants were hung on the breasts of their mothers. Some children were pierced with spears, roasted on the fire and then brought to their mothers to be eaten. Many times they used the bodies of Jewish children as improvised bridges upon which they later crossed. There was no cruel device of murder in the whole world that was not perpetrated by the enemies.\"|sign=[[Nathan Neta Hanover]]|source=\"[[The Abyss of Despair (Yeven Metzulah)]]\", chapter IV}}\n\nOn the first day of June, Khmelnitsky's main camp was stopped at Bila Sarkawa and ceased moving westward. Yet, the masses in the territories that remained under the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth control continued to rebel. Some atamans (officers) Cossack, with the most dominant of them all- Maxim Krivonos, used their forces to support the acts of rebellion. On the tenth of June, 1648, Krivonos conquered the city of Nemyriv, where a large Jewish population had fortified. According to Hanover and other record-writers, he pretended to be a friendly force and flew flags of the Crown Army, while Cossack sources reported from inside. As soon as Nemyriv fell, the Cossacks slaughtered all the Catholics and the Jews inside. Hanover reported 6,000 Jews killed, an improbable number which was denied by modern historians but still provides a measure of destruction. Mordechai Nadav noted that events of the size of that in Pinsk, in which several dozen Jews were apparently killed during the invasion, were more typical of the events. Similar massacres took place in many other cities, such as Polona and Bar. In Nemyriv, the Jewish chronologists noted a mass refusal of Jews to offer the slaughterers to convert to Christianity and to be saved, although at the same time the Shakh (Shabbatai ben Meir HaKohen) wrote that \"many Jews violated the covenant.\" A group of Jews which swore allegiance to the Cossacks and converted to Christianity rescued itself from the city after a short time, when Nemyriv fell into the hands of Vishniewitzky.\n\nOn June 18, Krivonos began a siege of Tulchyn, and broke through the wall on the 21st. The next day the fort fell. Then there was a time-out for several days and on June 26 the massacre took place. Hanover and others argued that the local commander, Duke Janusz Chetvartinsky, betrayed the Jews and gave them to the rioters while trying in vain to save his own life. Israel Halperin determined that there was no evidence of this and Chturtinsky probably tried to release all those who were inside by means of a bribe, but the Cossacks killed them all. He believed that the source of the rumor was because Cheturtinsky belonged to a devout Orthodox family and that is why the Catholics suspected him. Hannover noted that Jews were also offered to convert to Christianity, but they rejected it and chose death for the sanctification of God's Name. The historian Yechezkel Feram rejected Hannover's description and claimed that Hanover based on another person's testimony. Fram believed that the description was a distortion of the story \"cliff of the times\" about a similar sanction in Hommel that took place at the same time, on the 20th of June, 1648. Meir Meshbreshin reported that several rabbis urged the people to surrender and not to convert, and all of them were slaughtered, but this event is doubted as well.\n\nOthers like Hanover tended to link the sanctions of 1848-1988 to the Ashkenazi Kiddush tradition of the middle Ages, from events such as the 1096 decrees of Blois from 1171. The day Nemyriv was conquered, 10 June 1648, is also the Memorial Day In memory of the victims of the Cossacks. Yet, there were no similar events like the mass suicide in the days of the Crusaders in 1650. Historian Jacob Katz tended to associate this to the erosion of the ideal of Kiddush Hashem (the sanctification of God's name through martyrdom) in the past centuries, but Feram wrote that it remained as strong as ever. The difference between the riots was due to external circumstances. Unlike the Crusaders, the rebellious Ruthenians had no organized policy of conversion: they classified anyone who was not Orthodox as an enemy, but did not intended to spread their own faith. Also, there are reports of Jews who converted to Christianity voluntarily and still were killed. The Eastern Church had no direct connection with the rioters. For their part, they dealt with looting and killing for their own sake, nobility, Catholics and Uniattes as Jews. Paul of Aleppo, who visited the country a few years later, told of a desire for extermination. Even the masses, who were not familiar with the halakhic elements of the hour of annihilation but were well aware of the principle of a long tradition, viewed the events as a politic class struggle rather than an attempt to convert them, as many reports indicate, both from the chronicles and from testimonies to the courts after everything happened.\n\nIn September the noble armies suffered a heavy defeat in the Battle of Filabetsi, and in fact, there was no significant force remained until Warsaw itself. Khmelnytsky advanced toward Lviv and Zamo\u015b\u0107. In Lviv, the city's residents were offered to extradite the Jews in return for lifting the siege, but they refused. As in all other cities, the Jews took part in its defense. At the end of November, fearing a prolonged battle in the winter and after the new Polish-Lithuanian king offered him extensive concessions, Khmelnitsky retreated to Kiev. The fighting resumed at the end of May 1649, and continued intermittently for years to come. Large-scale killings were carried out against the Ukrainian Jews and the parts of Belarus that fell into the hands of the rebels. The number of people who converted to Christianity, which many of them kept their new religion even after the conquest of their homes by the crown's faithful soldiers, was big enough that on the 2nd of May, 1650, King Jan Kazimierz gave a special order that allows all those who wished it to return to Judaism. Many were captured by the Tartars. Among the Jews it was thought that the Tartars were interested in any Jew in order to sell them in slavery markets. However, they often wanted only slaves who would provide worthwhile price. These included young women, men of working age and children. There were cases in which the Ruthenian masses rejected the attempts to sell them slaves who were not included among these classifications. It was also reported that the elderly and other non-wanted slaves were separated from the captured prisoners and burned alive so that they would not burden the caravans. However, the Tartars did not take part in the massacres known as Tulchyn and Nemyriv; these were the work of Maksym Kryvonis. The Cossacks themselves did not take slaves, but killed those who fell into their hands. The Jewish communities joined forces in the efforts to redeem the Jewish slaves, which were located mainly in the large market in Constantinople. Large donations were made throughout the Jewish world: a special tax was imposed by the Council of Four Lands in areas not affected by the revolt, the Karaites in the Ottoman capital raised donations, and the main help came from a slavery-redeeming company in Venice whose emissaries came as far as Hamburg and Amsterdam to request charity. With these funds and its official delegate, the community of Constantinople redeemed 1,500 people by July 1651, in exchange for a total amount of 150,000 Spanish reais. The stream then decreased and in total there were 2,000 redeemed people in 1648, some in distant markets such as Persia and Algiers.\n\nThe number of Jewish victims was evaluated as great. Samuel Ben-Nathan Feidel, in his book from 1650, counted 281 communities destroyed and claimed that six hundred thousand Jews were killed. The Shakh on the other hand, noted that there were one thousand. Menashe Ben Israel wrote to Oliver Cromwell that there were one hundred and eighty thousand. Although in the 20th century, Isaac Schifer estimated that there were three hundred thousand killed or taken prisoner from 1648 to -1655. Modern research has greatly reduced estimates of the victims of the massacres: Professor Shmuel Ettinger estimated the entire Jewish population of Ukraine in 1648 at -51,325 persons, based on documents from that period. Prof. Shaul Stampfer claimed that there were 40,000, stating that \"'''at most 50% (20,000) and perhaps much less'''\" than those who died at the outbreak of the revolt in 1648.\n\n===  Additional disputes  ===\nIn 1654 Tsardom of Russia gave Suzerainty to Khmelnytsky and their armies invaded together into the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, both in Ukraine and in the north, in Belarus and Lithuania. At the beginning of August 1655 Vilna fell into the hands of the occupier and a mass slaughter was carried out, although the reports showed that most of the Jews had managed to escape in time. In October, Lublin was captured, where the chronicles cite about 2,000 Jews who died. It was the greatest disaster of the new battle. The historian Dov Weinryb, based both on Polish records and on personal reports, stated that the correct number was probably several hundred. The Russians also tended to take many prisoners, and a new wave of Jewish slaves reached the markets in 1665 and 1656. Once again, a great effort began to raise funds for their redemption.\n\nIn the summer of 1655 invaded a new enemy to the republic, the Swedish Empire led by King Carl Gustav. This war was the most destructive of all the struggles between Poland and Lithuania. It is still estimated to be worse than World War II in terms of the relative damage caused to the country. In what became known as the \"Swedish Flood,\" the most affluent and populated areas of Poland were completely destroyed. The circumstances led to great hunger that year. Jewish reports staged the invaders as sympathetic towards them. Although they did not take special action against them except for a random killing, many Jews, together with the rest of the people, died of starvation, epidemics and sword. For example, the Jewish quarter of Kazimierz in Krak\u00f3w was completely destroyed by the siege on the city in September\u2013October 1655 and the survivors fled to Bohemia and Moravia.\n\nThe Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth was almost collapsing: Many nobles believed that Karl Gustav would do them good and change sides with their armies. The magnate Janusz Radziwi\u0142\u0142 swore allegiance in return for protection from the Russians and cut off Lithuania from the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. But the scales were tipped by the massacres and looting of the Swedes, and especially by the awakening of Catholic sentiment with the successful defense of the Jesna Gora Monastery since November. The Pi\u0142sudski (a family of nobility that originated in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and increased in notability under the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Second Polish Republic) began to resent the Swedish king, who neglected their affairs, and most of them renewed their loyalty to Jan Kazimierz. The masses of the people and the minor nobility, headed by Hetman Stefan Czerniecki, launched a guerilla war against the Lutheran conquerors. In the fall of 1656, the Czar estimated that Sweden might become too strong and started supporting the King of Poland.\n\nThe rebels, driven also by the betrayal of the Calvinist Radziwill, ran what they perceived as a struggle for the Catholic Church. Lutherans, Calvinists, neo-Aryans, Orthodox and Jews were all marked as enemies and suspected of collaborating with the Swedes. Different militias and the Crown Forces massacred them frequently. On January 22, 1656, the king confiscated the remains of Kazimierz and gave all the looting that could be extracted from it to the army after declaring that the Jews had cooperated with the enemy. In February 1656, Czerniecki killed 600 Jews, according to the records, when he liberated Sandomierz Castle. Poland, Lithuania and Sweden signed a peace agreement in 1660, and the fighting between the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and Moscow resumed. It continued on a relatively limited scale until signing the Truce of Andrusovo Agreement in 1667, which brought tranquility to the kingdom for the first time in 19 years. The Lithuanian communities paid a large sum to include in the contract a clause allowing all Jewish prisoners in Russia, with the exception of converts and women who were married, to return home.\n\nThe historian Dov Weinryb wrote that according to records about the size of Jewish communities in the 1970s and 1980s, which together with other data indicate that many survived by conversion or immigration, \"a reasonable estimate\" of all Jews killed - By the sword, by all sides, and by epidemics and famine - during the turbulent period that swept Poland from 1648 to 1677, \"will be between 40,000 and 50,000, although historians point to far larger estimates, which are high enough to include between a fifth and a quarter of the Jewish population In Poland and Lithuania on the eve of the uprising. \"\n\n===  Following the Sanctions  ===\n[[File:Hebrewbooks_org_42621_520.jpg|right|thumb|312x312px|''\"El Maleh Rahamim\"'' in memory of the victims of the sanctions of 1096 and the sanctions of the Cossack riots.]]\nThe chaos that was in Poland following the sanctions brought the leaders of the communities and their rabbis into taking steps regarding the welfare of the refugees, both in material aid and in halachic discussions to allow a second marriage to women whose husbands had been lost. The problem of women whose husbands had been lost reached distant courts in communities where captives were redeemed and wanted to remarry. In Cairo, in a case cited in the \"Divrei Noam\", a group of women sent a messenger to Poland who returned with divorce documents from all their husbands.\n\nThe generation who lived at that time debated the question whether the sanctions were shedding clean blood for the sins of the House of Israel or punishment from god. Many adopted the first statement, but pamphlets published in Europe blamed the Polish Jewry of committing sins such as: loan interest, Folk distribution of Kabbalah books to the masses, raising pigs for non-Jews, lawlessness and more. The massive flight to the west also led to the renewed growth of the Holy Roman Empire as an important Torah center, after years of standing in the shadow of its neighbor to the east. Researchers in the past have frequently related the pogroms as a catalyst for the rise of Sabbateanism. Sarah, the wife of Shabtai Zvi, also became orphaned during it. Although this assertion lost its validity over time, Israel Halpern believed that the effort to raise funds for the redemption of captives throughout the continent hastened the horrific news of the events to the entire Diaspora and played an important role.\n\nIn memory of the heavy mourning, the rabbis decreed banquets and fancy costumes. Wearing silk and velvet was forbidden for three years. Women were forbidden to wear gold chains and gems for three years. It was forbidden to sing songs of joy for one year, except for wedding ceremonies, and the authority was given by the leaders of each community to extend the validity of the prohibitions for additional years.\n\nIn February 1650 The Council of Four Lands assembled in Lublin, where it was declared that the Memorial Day for the sanctions in Blois and for the day that nemyriv fell will be on the 10th of June, 1648 (20th of Sivan- a month from the Jewish calendar) In memory of the victims. Lamentations and special prayers were written to be said on this day. Rabbi Yom Tov Lipman Heller then corrected the lament of ''\"Ella Ezekara in Third Tears\"'' for those who perished. In addition, various versions of the prayer ''\"El Malei Rachamim\"'' (a Jewish prayer for the soul of a person who has died, usually recited at the graveside during the burial service and at memorial services during the year) were also composed, to be recited on the 20th of Sivan, on Yom Kippur, on the Sabbath preceding Shavuot and on Shabbat Chazon.\n\nDespite its many inaccuracies, ''\"Abyss of Despair\"'' has become a historical memory because of the high quality of Hanover's writing. It was published in more than twenty editions in several languages, and remained a major source until the 20th century. The sanctions of 1648 are mentioned in several literary works in Hebrew. The most famous of them are: ''\"The Slave\"'' by Isaac Bashevis Singer, ''\"The Nazarene\"'' by Shalom Asch, ''\"A City In Its Fullness\"'' by SY Agnon and the Ballad ''\"the Rabbi's daughter\"'' by Shaul Tchernichovsky.\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Amelia Glaser (editor).

He is crass and confrontational, regularly indulging in drugs and alcohol even while on duty. He is also shown to have a softer side, showing concern for his ailing mother, Eileen.\n\nBoyle and his new subordinate, Aidan McBride, investigate a murder, with evidence apparently pointing to an occult serial killer. Shortly after, Boyle attends a briefing by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Wendell Everett, sent to liaise with the Garda in hunting down four Irish drug traffickers, led by Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, who is believed to be awaiting a delivery of cocaine. Boyle recognises one of the men in Everett's presentation as the victim of the murder he and McBride had been investigating. McBride pulls over a car driven by Sheehy and his lieutenants Clive Cornell and Liam O'Leary and is shot dead. McBride's wife, Gabriela, reports McBride's disappearance to Boyle, who promises to look into it.\n\nThe strait-laced Everett and the unorthodox Boyle are teamed up to track down Sheehy and his men but, while Everett makes the rounds, encountering language difficulties and uncooperative residents, Boyle has a sexual encounter with a pair of prostitutes at a hotel in town. On his way back from the hotel, Boyle spots McBride's Garda car at a \"suicide hotspot\" along the coast, but does not believe that McBride killed himself. Gabriela says Aidan is gay. She, a Croatian woman, married him to get a visa. And he \"looks respectable\".<ref>[https://books.google.ru/books?id=-nBBAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA24&dq=%22Gabriela+marries+a+member+of+the+Garda%22&hl=ru&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwip3PSNxfHoAhUnxosKHTHjBNQQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=%22Gabriela%20marries%20a%20member%20of%20the%20Garda%22&f=false Leen Engelen, Kris Van Heuckelom.

P. 24]</ref> Meeting Everett at a local bar, Boyle notices a [[CCTV]] camera and remembers that the original suspect in the murder case claimed to be frequenting the very same establishment at the time of the killing. Looking over the footage from the time of the murder, they see that the suspect's alibi is valid\u2013and Everett also spots Sheehy and Cornell at the bar at the same time. Meanwhile, Cornell delivers a payoff to the Garda inspectors to keep them off the case, but Sheehy believes that Boyle will not be so easily swayed, after he meets with Boyle to half-heartedly attempt blackmail and then to offer a bribe, which is refused.\n\nTipped off by a young boy named Eugene, Boyle discovers a cache of weapons hidden in the marshes by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and arranges its return to an IRA member. After having her last wish to hear a live pub band fulfilled, Boyle's mother dies. Meeting at the bar again, Everett tells Boyle that Garda sources indicate Sheehy's shipment will be coming into [[County Cork]] and that he is leaving to investigate. Returning home, Boyle is confronted in his living room by O'Leary. Boyle pulls a gun and kills O'Leary, then calls Everett to tell him that the Cork lead is a decoy arranged by corrupt officers. Boyle drives to the local dock where Sheehy's vessel is berthed and Sheehy's men are unloading the cocaine. Everett arrives and is persuaded to give Boyle covering fire as he moves to arrest Sheehy and Cornell. Boyle kills Cornell before leaping onto the boat to deal with Sheehy. Everett's gunfire sets the boat alight. Boyle shoots Sheehy and leaves him for dead in the main cabin as the boat explodes.\n\nThe next day, Everett looks out on the water where the boat sank, believing Boyle to be dead.

He is crass and confrontational, regularly indulging in drugs and alcohol even while on duty. He is also shown to have a softer side, showing concern for his ailing mother, Eileen.\n\nBoyle and his new subordinate, Aidan McBride, investigate a murder, with evidence apparently pointing to an occult serial killer. Shortly after, Boyle attends a briefing by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Wendell Everett, sent to liaise with the Garda in hunting down four Irish drug traffickers, led by Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, who is believed to be awaiting a delivery of cocaine. Boyle recognises one of the men in Everett's presentation as the victim of the murder he and McBride had been investigating. McBride pulls over a car driven by Sheehy and his lieutenants Clive Cornell and Liam O'Leary and is shot dead. McBride's wife, Gabriela, reports McBride's disappearance to Boyle, who promises to look into it.\n\nThe strait-laced Everett and the unorthodox Boyle are teamed up to track down Sheehy and his men but, while Everett makes the rounds, encountering language difficulties and uncooperative residents, Boyle has a sexual encounter with a pair of prostitutes at a hotel in town. On his way back from the hotel, Boyle spots McBride's Garda car at a \"suicide hotspot\" along the coast, but does not believe that McBride killed himself. She, a Croatian woman, married him to get a visa. And he \"looks respectable\".<ref>[https://books.google.ru/books?id=-nBBAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA24&dq=%22Gabriela+marries+a+member+of+the+Garda%22&hl=ru&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwip3PSNxfHoAhUnxosKHTHjBNQQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=%22Gabriela%20marries%20a%20member%20of%20the%20Garda%22&f=false Leen Engelen, Kris Van Heuckelom.

P. 24]</ref> Meeting Everett at a local bar, Boyle notices a [[CCTV]] camera and remembers that the original suspect in the murder case claimed to be frequenting the very same establishment at the time of the killing. Looking over the footage from the time of the murder, they see that the suspect's alibi is valid\u2013and Everett also spots Sheehy and Cornell at the bar at the same time. Meanwhile, Cornell delivers a payoff to the Garda inspectors to keep them off the case, but Sheehy believes that Boyle will not be so easily swayed, after he meets with Boyle to half-heartedly attempt blackmail and then to offer a bribe, which is refused.\n\nTipped off by a young boy named Eugene, Boyle discovers a cache of weapons hidden in the marshes by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and arranges its return to an IRA member. After having her last wish to hear a live pub band fulfilled, Boyle's mother dies. Meeting at the bar again, Everett tells Boyle that Garda sources indicate Sheehy's shipment will be coming into [[County Cork]] and that he is leaving to investigate. Returning home, Boyle is confronted in his living room by O'Leary. Boyle pulls a gun and kills O'Leary, then calls Everett to tell him that the Cork lead is a decoy arranged by corrupt officers. Boyle drives to the local dock where Sheehy's vessel is berthed and Sheehy's men are unloading the cocaine. Everett arrives and is persuaded to give Boyle covering fire as he moves to arrest Sheehy and Cornell. Boyle kills Cornell before leaping onto the boat to deal with Sheehy. Everett's gunfire sets the boat alight. Boyle shoots Sheehy and leaves him for dead in the main cabin as the boat explodes.\n\nThe next day, Everett looks out on the water where the boat sank, believing Boyle to be dead.

Before they settled on the Germs as a band name, they called themselves \"Sophistifuck\" and the Revlon Spam Queens, but had to use a shorter name because they didn't have enough money to put this on a t-shirt.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHP-r9-eqdAC&pg=PA391 Alternative rock] By Dave Thompson p. 391</ref> \n\nAfter putting out an ad requesting \"two untalented girls\" who couldn't play their instruments, the two friends were joined by the suitably inexperienced bassist Terri Ryan, soon to be rechristened [[Lorna Doom]], and drummer [[Belinda Carlisle]], dubbed Dottie Danger, who never played a show with the group due to an extended bout of [[mononucleosis]] and went on to fame and fortune as both lead vocalist of [[The Go-Go's]] and an even more successful solo artist.

(standing for \"Germs Incognito\"). By the point in which they were filmed for ''The Decline of Western Civilization'', in late 1979, director Spheeris had to rent a soundstage called Cherrywood Studios in California in order for them to play a show outside of the club circuit from which they had been largely blacklisted.\n\n== Later life and suicide ==\nPlagued by Crash's worsening heroin addiction, and live performances that now often ended prematurely due to violent conflict between audience members and the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], the Germs disintegrated in April 1980, their last show being April 26 at the Fleetwood in Redondo Beach. \n\nCrash traveled to [[United Kingdom|Britain]], where he became heavily enamored with the music of [[Adam and the Ants]], adopted an Adam Ant\u2013inspired new look that included a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]], and put on a considerable amount of weight (some of which he eventually lost). Upon his return to the U.S., Crash formed the very short-lived Darby Crash Band; [[Circle Jerks]] drummer [[Lucky Lehrer]] joined the ill-fated ensemble on the eve of their first live performance after Crash kicked out the drummer they'd rehearsed with during soundcheck and convinced [[Pat Smear]] to act as the group's guitarist. Smear described the band as \"like the Germs, but with worse players\".\n\nOn December 3, 1980, an over-sold [[Starwood (nightclub)|Starwood]] hosted a final live show of the reunited Germs, including drummer Don Bolles.<ref>Mullen, Lexicon Devil</ref> Crash committed [[suicide]] by intentional heroin overdose on December 7, 1980, in a house in the Mid-Wilshire section of [[Hollywood, California]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/tombstonetourist00stan_0/page/306 The tombstone tourist: musicians] By Scott Stanton p. 306</ref> According to ''[[SPIN magazine]]'', apocryphal lore has Crash attempting to write \"Here Lies Darby Crash\" on the wall as he lay dying, but not finishing.

He grew up in [[Culver City, California]] and later, [[West Los Angeles]]. \n\nWhen he was 11 years old, his eldest half-brother, Bobby Lucas, died of a heroin overdose at the age of 27, thought to have been murdered by a disgruntled drug dealer who intentionally sold him an unusually potent batch of the drug. \n\nHe grew up believing that his biological father was a man named Harold \"Hal\" Beahm, who had left the family early on in his life. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}} When he was a teenager, one of his elder half-sisters, Faith Jr., revealed in an argument that his biological father was actually a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] sailor named William Bj\u00f6rklund. \n\nBeahm lived with his mother Faith Reynolds-Baker for much of his life, but their relationship was tumultuous. The accounts given of her in [[Brendan Mullen]] and [[Don Bolles (musician)|Don Bolles']] 2002 book ''Lexicon Devil: The Fast Times and Short Life of Darby Crash and the Germs'' portray her as having a mental illness, which caused her to behave erratically and be verbally abusive toward her son.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mullen|title=Lexicon Devil|pages=40\u201341}}</ref> \n\nFaith's third husband, Bob Baker, died suddenly of a heart attack at 39 in 1972; they had married in 1964 when a very young Beahm introduced the idea of them marrying after they began dating.
