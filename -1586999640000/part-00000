His and other people's efforts to gain access to schools were denied. Parents on Beacon Hill organized to hold classes for a school at the home of Hall's son, [[Primus Hall]], starting in 1798. Ten years later the school was moved to the African Meeting House. Parents gained partial support from the city in 1812 for the school, but continued to press for a regular public school. In the 1820s the city government provided 2 primary schools for black children.<ref>[http://www.afroammuseum.org/site13.htm ''Abiel Smith School, 46 Joy Street''], Museum of African American History, Boston and Nantucket.

White wrote:\n\n<blockquote>...black separatists sought to control the Boston \"African\" school mastership. This attempt undermined a movement by black and white abolitionists to integrate Boston's schools. From the black community, integrationists John T. Hilton, a barber, and Thomas Dalton, a tailor, with as many as eighty-eight others had petitioned the school committee three times between 1844 and 1846. They earnestly requested that 'exclusive schools be abolished' and that their children be allowed to attend schools in their respective districts. Consistently refused, blacks boycotted in the late 1840s, lowering African school attendance by 65%. In the state legislature, they lobbied a bill outlawing race as a criterion for school admission. By 1848, blacks had engaged Robert Morris, one of the first black lawyers in America, to file suit in the court of common pleas against the city to test the constitutionality of school segregation.<ref>{{cite book|author=White, Arthur T.|title=A Portrait of Charles Sumner \u2014 Advocate for Civil Rights, 1840-1874: Implications for Educational Leadership in the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoW_SnU2aTUC&pg=PA76|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=25 May 2011|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-640-92519-3|pages=76}}</ref> Repeated petitions and demands to integrate Boston's schools were resisted by the Boston School Committee for eleven years.

His and other people's efforts to gain access to schools were denied. Parents on Beacon Hill organized to hold classes for a school at the home of Hall's son, [[Primus Hall]], starting in 1798. Ten years later the school was moved to the African Meeting House. Parents gained partial support from the city in 1812 for the school, but continued to press for a regular public school. In the 1820s the city government provided 2 primary schools for black children.<ref>[http://www.afroammuseum.org/site13.htm ''Abiel Smith School, 46 Joy Street''], Museum of African American History, Boston and Nantucket.

White wrote:\n\n<blockquote>...black separatists sought to control the Boston \"African\" school mastership. This attempt undermined a movement by black and white abolitionists to integrate Boston's schools. From the black community, integrationists John T. Hilton, a barber, and Thomas Dalton, a tailor, with as many as eighty-eight others had petitioned the school committee three times between 1844 and 1846. They earnestly requested that 'exclusive schools be abolished' and that their children be allowed to attend schools in their respective districts. Consistently refused, blacks boycotted in the late 1840s, lowering African school attendance by 65%. In the state legislature, they lobbied a bill outlawing race as a criterion for school admission. By 1848, blacks had engaged Robert Morris, one of the first black lawyers in America, to file suit in the court of common pleas against the city to test the constitutionality of school segregation.<ref>{{cite book|author=White, Arthur T.|title=A Portrait of Charles Sumner \u2014 Advocate for Civil Rights, 1840-1874: Implications for Educational Leadership in the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoW_SnU2aTUC&pg=PA76|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=25 May 2011|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-640-92519-3|pages=76}}</ref> Repeated petitions and demands to integrate Boston's schools were resisted by the Boston School Committee for eleven years.

This situation changed with the [[Battle of the Paracel Islands]] in January 1974 when the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] expelled the South Vietnamese from the Paracel Islands.

The Portuguese, whose vessels frequented the South China Sea as early as at the beginning of the 16th century, were the first to refer to these islands as 'Ilhas do Pracel' in the 16th century.<br /> Regarding the likely origin of the term ''Paracel'', the word is a variant of the more common form ''pracel'' or ''parcel'', from the {{lang-es|placer}},<ref>[https://archive.org/details/diccionariomart01navagoog <!-- quote=diccionario. --> Mart\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez de Navarrete, ''Diccionario mar\u00edtimo espa\u00f1ol'', 1831]</ref> which was used by the [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese]] and Spanish navigators to designate shallow sandy seas or [[submerged bank]]s, such as ''[[Placer de los Roques]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dicio.com.br/parcel/|title=Parcel|publisher=}}</ref> \n{{quote|Pracel is a moderately elevated chain of islets, sandbanks, and reefs. These features are continuously distributed and stretched over a noticeable distance of tens or hundreds of kilometers in length. Pracel may not be a suitable place for human residents, but its irregular depth creates an ideal environment inhabited by fish. Pracel often forms a natural bulwark as an outer line of defense for a coast or a land.<ref name=\"NDV\" />}}\n\nThe Portuguese were later followed by the Dutch, the English, the Spanish, and the French in the waters of the island group. On the \"Map of the coast of Tonquin and Cochinchina\", made in 1747 by Pierre d'Hondt, the dangerous band of rugged rocks was labeled \"Le Paracel\", a French phonetic notation.

A weather station was built on Pattle Island (by the French) in 1932, and a lighthouse and radio station in 1937.<br />\nNortheast of this is Quanfu Dao (\"All Wealth Island\").<br />\nObservation Bank, also named Silver Islet, and the Lesser Silver Islet, are the northernmost of the group and contain a small cay.<br />\nJust south of them are [[Yagong Dao]] (He Duck) and Xianshe Yu (Salty Hut).\n\nAt the eastern side of the group lies a {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} long boomerang shaped reef with Stone Islet at its north end and Drummond Island at its south end.\n\nThe Duncan Islands ({{coord|16|27|N|111|43|E}}<ref name=nga/>), consisting of Duncan Island and Palm Island, lie approximately {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Drummond Island and about {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} east of Antelope Reef. Kuangzai Shazhou (Little Basket) lies about halfway between Palm Island and Antelope Reef.\n\n=== Other features ===\nTaking {{coord|16|40|N|112|20|E}} as the centre of the Paracel Islands, then the Amphitrite Group is ENE, and the Crescent Group is West.\n\n====Southeast====\n* [[Bombay Reef]]: This elongated reef is situated at the southeastern corner of the Paracel Islands ({{coord|16|112.5}}) and lies approximately {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=on}} southeast of the Crescent group. With most parts submerged, the reef measures approximately {{convert|18|by|5|km|0|abbr=on}} (E-W by N-S). Bombay Reef encloses a deep [[lagoon]] with rocks on its edge.\n\n====Eastern sub-group====\n* Bremen Bank: Located {{convert|24|km|0|abbr=on}} north of Bombay Reef ({{coord|16.3|112.5}}), is the southwestern-most feature of this subgroup. This submerged shallow bank measures approximately {{convert|23|km|0|abbr=on}} in length from northeast to southwest. The shallowest area reaches a depth of about {{convert|12|m}} and is located in the southwestern part of the bank.\n* Jehangire Bank: East of the Bremen Bank at {{coord|16.3|112.7}}\n* Neptuna Bank: North of the Bremen Bank at {{coord|16.5|112.5}}\n* Pyramid Rock: NE of the Neptuna Bank at {{coord|16.6|112.6}}\n* Lincoln Island: Surrounded by a coral reef, located {{convert|37|km|0|abbr=on}} southeast from the Amphitrite Group at {{coord|16.7|112.7}}, the island is covered with brushes and fairly high trees, including [[coconut]] [[palm tree]]s. The depth increases sharply on the northern and eastern sides of the island but the southern and south western regions are shallow. An observation post on the western side was found by officers of the German government surveys in 1883. In 1948, Great Britain requested France for permission to use the feature for military exercises.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n====Northeast====\n* Dido Bank: Separate from, and NE of, the Eastern sub-group at {{coord|16|49|N|112|53|E}}<ref name=nga/>\n\n====(ENE: Ampitrite group)====\n{{coord|16|53|N|112|17|E}}<ref name=nga/>\n\n====Northwest====\n* North Reef: Situated approximately {{convert|56|km|0|abbr=on}} north from the Crescent group and about {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}} west-northwest from the Amphitrite group at {{coord|17.1|111.5}},<ref name=nga/> the reef is the most northwesterly feature of the Paracel Islands. Most parts of the reef are submerged. There are rugged rocks are around the edge that are barely above water. There is a passage into the lagoon on the southwestern side of the reef.\n\n====(West: Crescent group)====\n\n====Inner southwest====\n* Discovery Reef: Measuring approximately {{convert|27|km|0|abbr=on}} in length from east to west, and {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}} from north to south, the reef is located about {{convert|18|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the Crescent Group at {{coord|16.25|111.7}}. Completely submerged, the elongated ring structure is the largest single reef in the Paracel Islands. The reef has two large, deep openings into the lagoon on its southern side. In the ocean nearby is [[Dragon Hole]]  the deepest known sinkhole in the world.<ref name=\"xinhaunet\"/><ref name=\"washpost\"/>\n* Passu Keah: This small reef encloses a shallow lagoon and is located about {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the eastern side of Discovery Reef at {{coord|16.1|111.8}}, approximately {{convert|37|mi|km}} east-northeast from Triton Island. The sand cay measures {{convert|9|km|0|abbr=on}} in length.\n\n====Outer southwest====\n* [[Triton Island]]: The sand cay supports vegetation and stands on a steep-sided coral reef measuring {{convert|1.5|km|0|abbr=on}} in length. This southwesternmost island of the Paracels is situated about {{convert|56|km|0|abbr=on}} from Discovery Reef at {{coord|15.8|111.2}}.\n\n====Central====\n* Vuladdore Reef: Located slightly south of the centre of the group at {{coord|16.3|112}}, this mostly submerged reef is orientated east\u2013west and measures approximately {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} by {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}}.

Pracel often forms a natural bulwark as an outer line of defense for a coast or a land.<ref name=\"NDV\" />}}\n\nThe Portuguese were later followed by the Dutch, the English, the Spanish, and the French in the waters of the island group. On the \"Map of the coast of Tonquin and Cochinchina\", made in 1747 by Pierre d'Hondt, the dangerous band of rugged rocks was labeled \"Le Paracel\", a French phonetic notation. Because of their location on an important seaborne route the Paracel Islands drew much attention from navigators and [[hydrographer]]s in the [[Age of Exploration]]. Disputes in the area since the Second World War have again drawn attention to the islands.\n\nOn the \"Map of Europe, Africa and Asia\" published in 1598 by [[Cornelis Claesz van Wieringen|Cornelis Claesz]], an unnamed band of rocks and sandbanks are shown near the present-day location of the Paracel and Spratly Islands. About two decades later, the names Pracel and Costa de Pracel (Coast of Pracel) appeared on the ''Chart of Asia and eight city maps'' published in 1617 by [[Willem Blaeu|Willem Jansz Blaeu]], a Dutch map maker.

These three exceptions are: The continuation of the pregnancy constitutes a danger to the life or health of the mother; The existence of life-threatening fetal malformations; The pregnancy is the result of rape, non-consensual artificial insemination or incest.\n\n<br />\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1837 and 1936 penal legislation authorized [[therapeutic abortion]] while banning all other forms of abortion, regardless of whether the abortion consented or not. The 1890 Penal Code, in article 640, allowed for abortion when it was absolutely necessary to save the mother's life, but stated that the law did not recommend such means, which were \"generally condemned\" by the [[Catholic Church]], the official religion at the time.<ref name=c355-06 /> In all other cases, a third party who attempted to abort a fetus without the woman's consent faced three to six years' imprisonment (five to ten years if the abortion was successful) or one to three years imprisonment if the woman consented (four to eight years if the abortion was successful).<ref name=abortocolombiabook>{{cite book|last1=Molina Betancur|first1=Carlos Mario|title=El derecho al aborto en Colombia.

The law also provided for reduced sentences, of 3\u20136 months (5\u201310 months if the abortion was successful), in the case of \"honest women of good reputation\" who received an abortion to \"conceal their frailty\" (''aborto honoris causa'').<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nA very conservative 1922 law to reform the penal code would have eliminated therapeutic abortion and punished women who sought an abortion but maintained the ''aborto honoris causa'', but the law never entered into force. The ''aborto honoris causa'', a legal concept inherited from Spain and Italy, was based on the opinion that a single mother had lost her honour.<ref name=abortocolombiabook /> The 1936 Penal Code differentiated between consented abortion (one to four years imprisonment for the woman and practitioner) and abortion not consented to (one to six years for the practitioner), maintaining provisions for a reduced sentence (reduced by a half to two thirds) or full pardon for an abortion to save one's honour or that of the mother, sister, woman, her descendants, or adopted girl.<ref name=c355-06 /><ref name=abortocolombiabook />\n\nThe 1980 Penal Code, in articles 343 to 345, removed the ''aborto honoris causa'' and adopted penalties and attenuating circumstances which would be largely retained by the current penal code, adopted in 2000.\n\n\n\n'''<big>Decree 100 of 1980.

The majority opinion of the court contended the [[Constitution of Colombia|1991 Constitution]], which recognizes life as a fundamental right (in article 11) and cites it as one of the founding principles in the constitutional preamble and article 2, recognized the \"primacy and inviolability of life\", excluding any possibility for abortion and allowing the legislator to penalize such acts. Furthermore, it opined that \"the life of the unborn embodies a fundamental value, for the hope of its existence as a person, and its apparent helplessness requires special attention from the State.\"<ref name=c133-94>{{cite court|vol=Sentencia C-133/94|court=Constitutional Court|date=17 March 1994|url=http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/RELATORIA/1994/C-133-94.htm}}</ref> Thus, Colombia's abortion legislation was constitutional under the State's obligation to protect the life of \"all persons\", which, at the time, the Court claimed \"obviously\" protected life during its formation and development given that these stages were condition for the viability of birth, the origin of the [[Legal personality|legal existence of a person]].<ref name=c133-94 /> In addition, the Court said, if the Constitution gives couples the right to decide their number of children, this right could only be exercised prior to conception since conception creates a being which is existentially distinct from the mother.<ref name=c133-94 />\n\n===Legal situation prior to 2006===\n\nAbortion was legally regulated by articles 122 through 124 of the Colombian Penal Code (law 599 of 2000).

Beginning in April 2005, several lawyers, led by M\u00f3nica Roa of the [[Women's Link Worldwide]] NGO, challenged the constitutionality of the abortion-related articles of the Penal Code to the Constitutional Court. The court consolidated three separate challenges into a single case.<ref name=elpais /> M\u00f3nica Roa's brief claimed that the ban on abortion violated a woman's constitutional right to the free development of her personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'') and autonomy, because the State was preventing her from deciding freely on issues which pertained solely to her. She further suggested that the legislation was [[Proportionality (law)|disproportional]], violated a woman's right to equality (by criminalizing a medical practice only needed by women, while the denial of an abortion was a clear example of discrimination against women violating their constitutional rights to health and life).<ref name=c355-06 /> Besides article 122 of the Penal Code, Roa also challenged the phrase in article 123 which subjected those who practised abortions on minors under fourteen to a higher prison sentence, as she said it violated a young girl's constitutionally-recognized autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 /> Finally, Roa challenged the entirety of article 124, because merely initiating criminal proceedings for an abortion in the face of sexual violence was violation of a woman's dignity, freedom and autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nSupporting her arguments, Roa also argued that clandestine abortions threatened a woman's life and cited several opinions from international organizations and international human rights instruments (which are of constitutional value and legally binding in Colombian constitutional law).<ref name=c355-06 /> Other constitutional arguments presented in favour of decriminalization included the secularism of the State, gender equality, human dignity, the right to intimacy and the freedom of conscience.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nReligious opposition to abortion was particularly intense during the court challenge, particularly from the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Opus Dei]], as well their allies in [[Congress of Colombia|Congress]].<ref name=elpais /> During the [[Colombian presidential election, 2006|2006 presidential campaign]], incumbent President [[\u00c1lvaro Uribe]] said that he opposed abortion, but most of his rivals, including eventual second-place finisher [[Carlos Gaviria D\u00edaz|Carlos Gaviria]], a former Constitutional Court magistrate, supported abortion rights and the legal challenge to the Penal Code.<ref name=elpais />\n\nThe Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF) opposed abortion as a family planning measure, but gave a favourable opinion to the decriminalization of abortion in certain cases.<ref name=c355-06 /> In its intervention before the Court, the [[Ombudsman's Office of Colombia|Ombudsman]] (''Defensor del Pueblo''), an autonomous constitutional control organization, supported the legal challenge against the ban on abortion. Like other contributors, the Ombudsman claimed that the law was based on a retrograde view of women as \"merely biological\", ignoring modern constitutional provisions for gender equality.<ref name=c355-06 /> The [[Ministry of Social Protection (Colombia)|Ministry of Social Protection]] primarily mentioned the public health risks associated with clandestine abortions to support its opinion that restrictive laws like those in Colombia were not efficient in any way in reducing unwanted pregnancies.\n\nThe [[Episcopal Conference of Colombia]] opposed the decriminalization of abortion, arguing that the impugned articles of the Penal Code protected the life, health and integrity of the unborn but also of the mother. The [[Magisterium]] assailed modern notions of liberty where people take as their sole and indisputable reference for their own choices, \"not the truth about good and evil, but only their subjective and changeable opinion or even their selfish and whimsical interest\", leading to the loss of any reference to common values and to a state where everything is negotiable, \"even the first of the fundamental rights, the right to life.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> The Episcopal Conference argued that the \"original and inalienable right to life\" could not be subject to political debate, and stated that to \"claim the right to abortion, to infanticide [...], means attributing to human freedom a perverse and evil significance: absolute power over and against others.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Notably, opponents of the challenge to the law brought attention to the [[American Convention on Human Rights]], which states in article 4.1 that \"Every person has the right to have his life respected. This right shall be protected by law and, in general, from the moment of conception.\" In addition to this formal intervention, the Constitutional Court received a written contribution signed by all the Archbishops in Colombia, including [[Pedro Rubiano Sa\u00e9nz]], [[Archbishop of Bogot\u00e1]], urging the Court to rule the articles constitutional.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe [[Inspector General of Colombia]], [[Edgardo Jos\u00e9 Maya Villaz\u00f3n|Edgardo Maya Villaz\u00f3n]], asked the Court to decriminalize abortion in the cases of maternal health, life-threatening foetal defects and conception without the woman's consent (in legal terms, ruling article 122 conditionally constitutional). Constitutionally, the Inspector General held that the right to life must be balanced with and interpreted alongside the principle of human dignity.<ref name=c355-06 /> The Inspector General concluded that criminalizing abortion in the aforementioned cases constituted an unreasonable and disproportionate sanction, interfering with a woman's fundamental rights.\n\n==Sentence C-355 of 2006==\n\nOn May 10, 2006, the Constitutional Court reached a 5-3 decision which partially decriminalized abortion in Colombia under certain circumstances.\n\nThe majority opinion examined several constitutional and legal issues pertaining to life and fundamental rights, including:<ref name=c355-06 />\n\n*'''Life and the right to live:''' The Court held that the Colombian Constitution not only protected the right to life but also recognized life as a value, which implied a duty for the State to protect life. However, if the legislators are allowed to adopt appropriate measures to comply with this duty, this does not mean that all measures adopted in this sense are necessarily justified, because life does not have the character of an absolute value or right and must be weighted with other constitutional values, principles and rights. The right to life (article 11 of the Constitution) is limited to human beings, while the protection of life as a value extends to the unborn.<ref name=\"c355-06\" />\n*'''Life in [[International human rights law]]:''' The Court considered the protection of the right to life in several international human rights treaties which hold constitutional status in Colombia as part of the 'constitutional bloc'. The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] explicitly state that the right to life is held by the human person. The aforementioned American Convention on Human Rights states that the right to life must be protected by life, \"in general\" from the moment of conception; but the Court held that this was not of an absolute nature, notably because the terms \"in general\" contemplates possibilities in which the law does not protect life from the moment of conception. \n*'''Women's rights in the Colombian Constitution and international law:''' Gender equality and women's rights were constitutionally recognized in 1991, while international human rights conventions and legal instruments have protected women's reproductive rights and recognized violence against women as one of the most serious crimes.\n*'''Limits to the legislator's powers in criminal matters:''' While the Colombian legislator enjoys a wide margin of freedom in determining criminal law, this power is not unlimited. Criminal legislation must respect fundamental rights, constitutional principles and the legal principles of proportionality and reasonableness. Some of the constitutional limits to the legislator's power to legislate include human dignity (which, for women, includes the right to freely determine her life), the free development of personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'', individual autonomy) the right to health (which, for women, includes reproductive health) and international law.\n\nConcretely, the Court ruled that the total ban on abortion in Article 122 of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. While the life of the unborn is protected by the constitutional order, the Court considered that the legislator is not obligated to adopt criminal laws to protect the life of the unborn, although it also stated that such measures were not disproportionate. However, a complete ban on abortion meant the complete dominance of one legal interest (the life of the unborn) over all others, specifically the fundamental rights of the mother.<ref name=\"c355-06\" /> The Colombian Constitution, in the Court's opinion, is characterized by the coexistence of several values, principles and rights - none of which have an absolute value against the others. Therefore, the ban on abortion was therefore unconstitutional, as it completely ignored the dignity of the mother and reduced her to \"a mere receptacle of unborn life, lacking rights or constitutionally relevant interests meriting protection.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Article 124, which imposed a reduced sentence on the mother in cases of rape, was also ruled to be unconstitutional because it was disproportionate. As a result, the Court ruled that abortion should be permitted in cases where the pregnancy is the result of rape, artificial insemination without consent, incest, if the pregnancy threatens the life and health (physical and mental) of the woman and in cases of foetal malformations rendering the fetus inviable.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court also struck down the phrase \"or in women younger than fourteen\" in Article 123, which subjected those who practised an abortion on a woman younger than fourteen to a longer jail sentence. Prior constitutional jurisprudence had recognized that minors had the right, depending on their maturity, to consent to medical interventions or treatments.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court concluded by stating that it had limited itself to noting the three 'extreme scenarios' which violated the Constitution, and that nothing prevents the legislator from decriminalizing abortion in other circumstances.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\n==Current legal situation==\n\nTo date, the Congress has not amended the Penal Code to take into account the Constitutional Court's C-355/06 ruling. Therefore, abortion in Colombia is currently permitted in the three instances which were decriminalized by sentence C-355/06. <ref name=\"c355-06\" />\n\n===Rape, incest and artificial insemination without consent===\n\nAbortion is permitted when the pregnancy is the result of rape, abusive sexual intercourse without consent, incest and artificial insemination or transfer of a fertilized ovum without consent. It is necessary that, in such circumstances, the offence has been duly reported to the appropriate authorities. Sentence C-355/06 explicitly barred legislators from adopting regulatory measures which would establish disproportionate burdens on women's rights, such as demanding forensic evidence of sexual penetration.\n\n===Maternal life or health===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where the continuation of the pregnancy constitutes a danger to the mother's physical or mental health or life, subject to medical certification. The Court did not establish specific cases which would constitute threats to a mother's health or life, instead leaving such tasks to medical professionals.\n\n===Fetal malformations===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where medically certified serious fetal malformations mean that the newborn would probably not survive. The Court did not establish specific malformations, leaving such tasks to medical professionals.\n\n===Conscientious objection===\n\nIn sentence C-355/06, the Constitutional Court reiterated that [[juridical persons]] do not have the right to conscientious objection, a right only recognized to [[natural persons]]. Therefore, no clinic, hospital or other health centre may refuse to practise abortions based on conscientious objections in the aforementioned cases. A doctor who refuses to practise an abortion must nevertheless refer the woman to another doctor who may perform the abortion. In another court ruling, T-209 of 2008, the Constitutional Court emphasized that a conscientious objection can only be based on religious convictions and not personal opinions.\n\n==='''Other circumstances'''===\n\nIn the absence of any change to the law, an abortion in any other circumstance remains illegal and punishable by 16 to 54 months imprisonment for both the woman and the person who performed the abortion.\n\n==Barriers and obstacles to abortion==\n\nDespite the decriminalization of abortion in several women's groups and the Constitutional Court have identified a number of barriers imposed on women seeking a legal abortion. These include requests for additional requirements to those set forth by sentence C-355/06, unfounded conscientious objections and medical boards unjustifiably delaying the procedure by more than 5 days (the limit estimated by the Court to respond to a woman's request).<ref>{{cite book|title=Determinantes del aborto inseguro y barreras de acceso para la atenci\u00f3n de la interrupci\u00f3n voluntaria del embarazo en mujeres colombianas|date=2014|publisher=Ministerio de Salud y Protecci\u00f3n Social and Fondo de Poblaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas (UNFPA)|location=Bogot\u00e1|isbn=978-958-873-575-7|url=http://profamilia.org.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Determinantes%20del%20aborto%20inseguro%20y%20barreras%20de%20acceso%20para%20la%20atencio%CC%81n%20de%20la%20IVE%20en%20mujeres%20colombianas.pdf|ref=profamilia publication}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, the Constitutional Court heard the case of a woman who was diagnosed with a severe fetal malformation that was incompatible with life, but her healthcare provider would only authorize an abortion if a judge granted a judicial order to do so (a condition not required under the law), which the judge did not grant because of conscientious objections. The court's ruling reiterated that neither institutions nor judicial authorities can refuse a woman an abortion based on conscience claims, and stated that, under the circumstances where an abortion is legal, women \"enjoy a right to decide, free from any pressure, coercion, urging, manipulation and, in general, any sort of inadmissible intervention, to terminate a pregnancy \u2026 it is forbidden to raise any obstacles, requirements or additional barriers.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Center Praises Momentous Decision in Abortion Case in Colombia|url=http://www.reproductiverights.org/press-room/center-praises-momentous-decision-in-abortion-case-in-colombia|website=Center for Reproductive Rights|accessdate=14 January 2016|date=27 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n\nIn October 2013, the [[Guttmacher Institute]] reported an estimated 400,400 induced abortions were performed in Colombia in 2008, of which only 322 were reported as legal procedures.<ref name=abortionstats>{{cite web|title=Unintended Pregnancy and Induced Abortion in Colombia|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-pregnancy-abortion-Colombia.html|website=Guttmacher Institute|accessdate=14 January 2016}}</ref> These numbers are much higher than the official statistics reported by the [[Colombian Ministry of Health|Ministry of Health]], which indicated that 15,000 abortions were performed in Colombia between 2009 and 2012.

Second. Declare INHIBITED to issue a substantive pronouncement, due to the substantive ineptitude of the lawsuit, regarding the charges made against articles 90, 91 and 93 of the Civil Code (for violation of articles 4, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50 and 95 of the Political Charter, as well as of the provisions of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and of the United Nations Convention against Torture). Summary of the ruling Citizen Natalia Bernal Cano demanded the constitutionality of articles 90, 91 and 93 of the Civil Code. In his opinion, limiting the rights of those who are about to be born, does not know that they are \"innocent living beings capable of feeling pain and that they are attacked with abortive methods when they are in the womb because their human person status is not recognized, holder of rights and obligations \u201d3. Consequently, he maintained that the defendant provisions violate the provisions of the Constitution in its articles 1, 2, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50, 94 and 95; the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the United Nations Convention against Torture. The Court concluded that regarding the charges for ignorance of articles 1, 2, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 94 of the Constitution, the phenomenon of constitutional res judicata operated for what was resolved in judgment C-591 of 1995, reiterated in judgment C-327 of 2016. In effect, it found that on that occasion the Court ruled regarding the constitutionality of the same legal provisions, for the same reasons stated in this application. Additionally, it clarified that the reasons stated by the plaintiff are not sufficient to weaken the existence of res judicata. Therefore, it was resolved in that judgment. On the other hand, the Court determined that the charges for ignorance of the Constitution in its articles 4, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50 and 95, of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and of the Convention of the United Nations against Torture did not comply with the minimum requirements demanded by constitutional jurisprudence.

The 1890 Penal Code, in article 640, allowed for abortion when it was absolutely necessary to save the mother's life, but stated that the law did not recommend such means, which were \"generally condemned\" by the [[Catholic Church]], the official religion at the time.<ref name=c355-06 /> In all other cases, a third party who attempted to abort a fetus without the woman's consent faced three to six years' imprisonment (five to ten years if the abortion was successful) or one to three years imprisonment if the woman consented (four to eight years if the abortion was successful).<ref name=abortocolombiabook>{{cite book|last1=Molina Betancur|first1=Carlos Mario|title=El derecho al aborto en Colombia.

The ''aborto honoris causa'', a legal concept inherited from Spain and Italy, was based on the opinion that a single mother had lost her honour.<ref name=abortocolombiabook /> The 1936 Penal Code differentiated between consented abortion (one to four years imprisonment for the woman and practitioner) and abortion not consented to (one to six years for the practitioner), maintaining provisions for a reduced sentence (reduced by a half to two thirds) or full pardon for an abortion to save one's honour or that of the mother, sister, woman, her descendants, or adopted girl.<ref name=c355-06 /><ref name=abortocolombiabook />\n\nThe 1980 Penal Code, in articles 343 to 345, removed the ''aborto honoris causa'' and adopted penalties and attenuating circumstances which would be largely retained by the current penal code, adopted in 2000.\n\n\n\n'''<big>Decree 100 of 1980.

The majority opinion of the court contended the [[Constitution of Colombia|1991 Constitution]], which recognizes life as a fundamental right (in article 11) and cites it as one of the founding principles in the constitutional preamble and article 2, recognized the \"primacy and inviolability of life\", excluding any possibility for abortion and allowing the legislator to penalize such acts.

Beginning in April 2005, several lawyers, led by M\u00f3nica Roa of the [[Women's Link Worldwide]] NGO, challenged the constitutionality of the abortion-related articles of the Penal Code to the Constitutional Court. The court consolidated three separate challenges into a single case.<ref name=elpais /> M\u00f3nica Roa's brief claimed that the ban on abortion violated a woman's constitutional right to the free development of her personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'') and autonomy, because the State was preventing her from deciding freely on issues which pertained solely to her. She further suggested that the legislation was [[Proportionality (law)|disproportional]], violated a woman's right to equality (by criminalizing a medical practice only needed by women, while the denial of an abortion was a clear example of discrimination against women violating their constitutional rights to health and life).<ref name=c355-06 /> Besides article 122 of the Penal Code, Roa also challenged the phrase in article 123 which subjected those who practised abortions on minors under fourteen to a higher prison sentence, as she said it violated a young girl's constitutionally-recognized autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 /> Finally, Roa challenged the entirety of article 124, because merely initiating criminal proceedings for an abortion in the face of sexual violence was violation of a woman's dignity, freedom and autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nSupporting her arguments, Roa also argued that clandestine abortions threatened a woman's life and cited several opinions from international organizations and international human rights instruments (which are of constitutional value and legally binding in Colombian constitutional law).<ref name=c355-06 /> Other constitutional arguments presented in favour of decriminalization included the secularism of the State, gender equality, human dignity, the right to intimacy and the freedom of conscience.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nReligious opposition to abortion was particularly intense during the court challenge, particularly from the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Opus Dei]], as well their allies in [[Congress of Colombia|Congress]].<ref name=elpais /> During the [[Colombian presidential election, 2006|2006 presidential campaign]], incumbent President [[\u00c1lvaro Uribe]] said that he opposed abortion, but most of his rivals, including eventual second-place finisher [[Carlos Gaviria D\u00edaz|Carlos Gaviria]], a former Constitutional Court magistrate, supported abortion rights and the legal challenge to the Penal Code.<ref name=elpais />\n\nThe Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF) opposed abortion as a family planning measure, but gave a favourable opinion to the decriminalization of abortion in certain cases.<ref name=c355-06 /> In its intervention before the Court, the [[Ombudsman's Office of Colombia|Ombudsman]] (''Defensor del Pueblo''), an autonomous constitutional control organization, supported the legal challenge against the ban on abortion. Like other contributors, the Ombudsman claimed that the law was based on a retrograde view of women as \"merely biological\", ignoring modern constitutional provisions for gender equality.<ref name=c355-06 /> The [[Ministry of Social Protection (Colombia)|Ministry of Social Protection]] primarily mentioned the public health risks associated with clandestine abortions to support its opinion that restrictive laws like those in Colombia were not efficient in any way in reducing unwanted pregnancies.\n\nThe [[Episcopal Conference of Colombia]] opposed the decriminalization of abortion, arguing that the impugned articles of the Penal Code protected the life, health and integrity of the unborn but also of the mother. The [[Magisterium]] assailed modern notions of liberty where people take as their sole and indisputable reference for their own choices, \"not the truth about good and evil, but only their subjective and changeable opinion or even their selfish and whimsical interest\", leading to the loss of any reference to common values and to a state where everything is negotiable, \"even the first of the fundamental rights, the right to life.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> The Episcopal Conference argued that the \"original and inalienable right to life\" could not be subject to political debate, and stated that to \"claim the right to abortion, to infanticide [...], means attributing to human freedom a perverse and evil significance: absolute power over and against others.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Notably, opponents of the challenge to the law brought attention to the [[American Convention on Human Rights]], which states in article 4.1 that \"Every person has the right to have his life respected. This right shall be protected by law and, in general, from the moment of conception.\" In addition to this formal intervention, the Constitutional Court received a written contribution signed by all the Archbishops in Colombia, including [[Pedro Rubiano Sa\u00e9nz]], [[Archbishop of Bogot\u00e1]], urging the Court to rule the articles constitutional.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe [[Inspector General of Colombia]], [[Edgardo Jos\u00e9 Maya Villaz\u00f3n|Edgardo Maya Villaz\u00f3n]], asked the Court to decriminalize abortion in the cases of maternal health, life-threatening foetal defects and conception without the woman's consent (in legal terms, ruling article 122 conditionally constitutional). Constitutionally, the Inspector General held that the right to life must be balanced with and interpreted alongside the principle of human dignity.<ref name=c355-06 /> The Inspector General concluded that criminalizing abortion in the aforementioned cases constituted an unreasonable and disproportionate sanction, interfering with a woman's fundamental rights.\n\n==Sentence C-355 of 2006==\n\nOn May 10, 2006, the Constitutional Court reached a 5-3 decision which partially decriminalized abortion in Colombia under certain circumstances.\n\nThe majority opinion examined several constitutional and legal issues pertaining to life and fundamental rights, including:<ref name=c355-06 />\n\n*'''Life and the right to live:''' The Court held that the Colombian Constitution not only protected the right to life but also recognized life as a value, which implied a duty for the State to protect life. However, if the legislators are allowed to adopt appropriate measures to comply with this duty, this does not mean that all measures adopted in this sense are necessarily justified, because life does not have the character of an absolute value or right and must be weighted with other constitutional values, principles and rights. The right to life (article 11 of the Constitution) is limited to human beings, while the protection of life as a value extends to the unborn.<ref name=\"c355-06\" />\n*'''Life in [[International human rights law]]:''' The Court considered the protection of the right to life in several international human rights treaties which hold constitutional status in Colombia as part of the 'constitutional bloc'. The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] explicitly state that the right to life is held by the human person. The aforementioned American Convention on Human Rights states that the right to life must be protected by life, \"in general\" from the moment of conception; but the Court held that this was not of an absolute nature, notably because the terms \"in general\" contemplates possibilities in which the law does not protect life from the moment of conception. \n*'''Women's rights in the Colombian Constitution and international law:''' Gender equality and women's rights were constitutionally recognized in 1991, while international human rights conventions and legal instruments have protected women's reproductive rights and recognized violence against women as one of the most serious crimes.\n*'''Limits to the legislator's powers in criminal matters:''' While the Colombian legislator enjoys a wide margin of freedom in determining criminal law, this power is not unlimited. Criminal legislation must respect fundamental rights, constitutional principles and the legal principles of proportionality and reasonableness. Some of the constitutional limits to the legislator's power to legislate include human dignity (which, for women, includes the right to freely determine her life), the free development of personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'', individual autonomy) the right to health (which, for women, includes reproductive health) and international law.\n\nConcretely, the Court ruled that the total ban on abortion in Article 122 of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. While the life of the unborn is protected by the constitutional order, the Court considered that the legislator is not obligated to adopt criminal laws to protect the life of the unborn, although it also stated that such measures were not disproportionate. However, a complete ban on abortion meant the complete dominance of one legal interest (the life of the unborn) over all others, specifically the fundamental rights of the mother.<ref name=\"c355-06\" /> The Colombian Constitution, in the Court's opinion, is characterized by the coexistence of several values, principles and rights - none of which have an absolute value against the others. Therefore, the ban on abortion was therefore unconstitutional, as it completely ignored the dignity of the mother and reduced her to \"a mere receptacle of unborn life, lacking rights or constitutionally relevant interests meriting protection.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Article 124, which imposed a reduced sentence on the mother in cases of rape, was also ruled to be unconstitutional because it was disproportionate. As a result, the Court ruled that abortion should be permitted in cases where the pregnancy is the result of rape, artificial insemination without consent, incest, if the pregnancy threatens the life and health (physical and mental) of the woman and in cases of foetal malformations rendering the fetus inviable.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court also struck down the phrase \"or in women younger than fourteen\" in Article 123, which subjected those who practised an abortion on a woman younger than fourteen to a longer jail sentence. Prior constitutional jurisprudence had recognized that minors had the right, depending on their maturity, to consent to medical interventions or treatments.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court concluded by stating that it had limited itself to noting the three 'extreme scenarios' which violated the Constitution, and that nothing prevents the legislator from decriminalizing abortion in other circumstances.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\n==Current legal situation==\n\nTo date, the Congress has not amended the Penal Code to take into account the Constitutional Court's C-355/06 ruling. Therefore, abortion in Colombia is currently permitted in the three instances which were decriminalized by sentence C-355/06. <ref name=\"c355-06\" />\n\n===Rape, incest and artificial insemination without consent===\n\nAbortion is permitted when the pregnancy is the result of rape, abusive sexual intercourse without consent, incest and artificial insemination or transfer of a fertilized ovum without consent. It is necessary that, in such circumstances, the offence has been duly reported to the appropriate authorities. Sentence C-355/06 explicitly barred legislators from adopting regulatory measures which would establish disproportionate burdens on women's rights, such as demanding forensic evidence of sexual penetration.\n\n===Maternal life or health===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where the continuation of the pregnancy constitutes a danger to the mother's physical or mental health or life, subject to medical certification. The Court did not establish specific cases which would constitute threats to a mother's health or life, instead leaving such tasks to medical professionals.\n\n===Fetal malformations===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where medically certified serious fetal malformations mean that the newborn would probably not survive. The Court did not establish specific malformations, leaving such tasks to medical professionals.\n\n===Conscientious objection===\n\nIn sentence C-355/06, the Constitutional Court reiterated that [[juridical persons]] do not have the right to conscientious objection, a right only recognized to [[natural persons]]. Therefore, no clinic, hospital or other health centre may refuse to practise abortions based on conscientious objections in the aforementioned cases. A doctor who refuses to practise an abortion must nevertheless refer the woman to another doctor who may perform the abortion. In another court ruling, T-209 of 2008, the Constitutional Court emphasized that a conscientious objection can only be based on religious convictions and not personal opinions.\n\n==='''Other circumstances'''===\n\nIn the absence of any change to the law, an abortion in any other circumstance remains illegal and punishable by 16 to 54 months imprisonment for both the woman and the person who performed the abortion.\n\n==Barriers and obstacles to abortion==\n\nDespite the decriminalization of abortion in several women's groups and the Constitutional Court have identified a number of barriers imposed on women seeking a legal abortion. These include requests for additional requirements to those set forth by sentence C-355/06, unfounded conscientious objections and medical boards unjustifiably delaying the procedure by more than 5 days (the limit estimated by the Court to respond to a woman's request).<ref>{{cite book|title=Determinantes del aborto inseguro y barreras de acceso para la atenci\u00f3n de la interrupci\u00f3n voluntaria del embarazo en mujeres colombianas|date=2014|publisher=Ministerio de Salud y Protecci\u00f3n Social and Fondo de Poblaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas (UNFPA)|location=Bogot\u00e1|isbn=978-958-873-575-7|url=http://profamilia.org.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Determinantes%20del%20aborto%20inseguro%20y%20barreras%20de%20acceso%20para%20la%20atencio%CC%81n%20de%20la%20IVE%20en%20mujeres%20colombianas.pdf|ref=profamilia publication}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, the Constitutional Court heard the case of a woman who was diagnosed with a severe fetal malformation that was incompatible with life, but her healthcare provider would only authorize an abortion if a judge granted a judicial order to do so (a condition not required under the law), which the judge did not grant because of conscientious objections. The court's ruling reiterated that neither institutions nor judicial authorities can refuse a woman an abortion based on conscience claims, and stated that, under the circumstances where an abortion is legal, women \"enjoy a right to decide, free from any pressure, coercion, urging, manipulation and, in general, any sort of inadmissible intervention, to terminate a pregnancy \u2026 it is forbidden to raise any obstacles, requirements or additional barriers.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Center Praises Momentous Decision in Abortion Case in Colombia|url=http://www.reproductiverights.org/press-room/center-praises-momentous-decision-in-abortion-case-in-colombia|website=Center for Reproductive Rights|accessdate=14 January 2016|date=27 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n\nIn October 2013, the [[Guttmacher Institute]] reported an estimated 400,400 induced abortions were performed in Colombia in 2008, of which only 322 were reported as legal procedures.<ref name=abortionstats>{{cite web|title=Unintended Pregnancy and Induced Abortion in Colombia|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-pregnancy-abortion-Colombia.html|website=Guttmacher Institute|accessdate=14 January 2016}}</ref> These numbers are much higher than the official statistics reported by the [[Colombian Ministry of Health|Ministry of Health]], which indicated that 15,000 abortions were performed in Colombia between 2009 and 2012.

In other words, 25.2% of women penalized for abortion in Colombia are minors.\n\n== Important announcement Nov 2015 ==\n\nIn November 2015, [[Attorney general of colombia|Attorney General]] [[Eduardo Montealegre]] announced that he would send a bill to Congress legalizing abortion on request in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.

TO BE RESOLVED in the judgment C-591 of 1995 by means of which it was decided \"Articles 90, 91 and 93 of the Civil Code be declared EXEQUIBLE\", regarding the charges for ignorance of articles 1, 2, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 94 of the Constitution. Second. Declare INHIBITED to issue a substantive pronouncement, due to the substantive ineptitude of the lawsuit, regarding the charges made against articles 90, 91 and 93 of the Civil Code (for violation of articles 4, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50 and 95 of the Political Charter, as well as of the provisions of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and of the United Nations Convention against Torture). Summary of the ruling Citizen Natalia Bernal Cano demanded the constitutionality of articles 90, 91 and 93 of the Civil Code. In his opinion, limiting the rights of those who are about to be born, does not know that they are \"innocent living beings capable of feeling pain and that they are attacked with abortive methods when they are in the womb because their human person status is not recognized, holder of rights and obligations \u201d3. Consequently, he maintained that the defendant provisions violate the provisions of the Constitution in its articles 1, 2, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50, 94 and 95; the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the United Nations Convention against Torture. The Court concluded that regarding the charges for ignorance of articles 1, 2, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 94 of the Constitution, the phenomenon of constitutional res judicata operated for what was resolved in judgment C-591 of 1995, reiterated in judgment C-327 of 2016. In effect, it found that on that occasion the Court ruled regarding the constitutionality of the same legal provisions, for the same reasons stated in this application. Additionally, it clarified that the reasons stated by the plaintiff are not sufficient to weaken the existence of res judicata. Therefore, it was resolved in that judgment. On the other hand, the Court determined that the charges for ignorance of the Constitution in its articles 4, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50 and 95, of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and of the Convention of the United Nations against Torture did not comply with the minimum requirements demanded by constitutional jurisprudence. '''Specifically, it maintained that they do not meet the requirements of certainty, clarity, specificity and sufficiency, which is why it declared itself inhibited from issuing a substantive pronouncement.'''\n\n\n\n\n[https://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/RELATORIA/1994/C-133-94.htm Constitutional Court rules on the existing lawsuit ]\n[https://elpais.com/sociedad/2019/09/30/actualidad/1569863503_607122.html \u201cIn Colombia there are 502 minors criminalized for aborting Sep 30, 2019]\nhttps://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/comunicados/Comunicado%20No.%2011%20del%2002%20de%20marzo%20de%202020.pdf\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Abortion]]\n*[[:Category:Abortion by country|Abortion by country]]\n*[[Abortion law]]\n\n{{Abortion in South America}}\n{{Abortion}}\n\n[[Category:Abortion in Colombia| ]]\n", "name_user": "Isabellac99", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_Colombia"}
