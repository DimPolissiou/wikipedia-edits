Following the First World War, the Southern League dropped its Second Division, and with many clubs dropping out due to financial difficulties, Swansea were placed in the First Division. After four seasons in the Southern League, Swansea Town became founder members of the new [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] of [[the Football League]] in 1920. During the club's 106-year existence, it has competed in a number of nationally and internationally organised competitions, and all players who have played in 100 or more such matches are listed below.\n\n[[Roger Freestone]] holds the club record for most appearances in all competitions, having played 676 times in all competitions during two different spells spanning from 1989\u20132004.

{"title_page": "Four-stroke engine", "text_new": "[[File:4StrokeEngine Ortho 3D Small.gif|thumb|right|300px|Four-stroke cycle used in gasoline/petrol engines: intake (1), compression (2), power (3), and exhaust (4).]] The right blue side is the intake port and the left brown side is the exhaust port. The cylinder wall is a thin sleeve surrounding the piston head which creates a space for the combustion of fuel and the genesis of mechanical '''four-stroke''' (also '''four-cycle''') '''engine''' is an [[internal combustion]] (IC) engine in which the [[piston]] completes four separate strokes while turning the crankshaft. A stroke refers to the full travel of the piston along the cylinder, in either direction. The four separate strokes are termed:\n#'''Intake''': Also known as induction or suction. This stroke of the piston begins at top dead center (T.D.C.) and ends at bottom dead center (B.D.C.). In this stroke the intake valve must be in the open position while the piston pulls an air-fuel mixture into the cylinder by producing vacuum pressure into the cylinder through its downward motion. The piston is moving down as air is being sucked in by the downward motion against the piston.\n#'''Compression''': This stroke begins at B.D.C, or just at the end of the suction stroke, and ends at T.D.C.  In this stroke the piston compresses the air-fuel mixture in preparation for ignition during the power stroke (below). Both the intake and exhaust valves are closed during this stage.\n#'''Combustion''': Also known as power or ignition. This is the start of the second revolution of the four stroke cycle. At this point the crankshaft has completed a full 360 degree revolution. While the piston is at T.D.C. (the end of the compression stroke) the compressed air-fuel mixture is ignited by a [[spark plug]] (in a gasoline engine) or by heat generated by high compression (diesel engines), forcefully returning the piston to B.D.C. This stroke produces mechanical work from the engine to turn the crankshaft.\n#'''Exhaust''': Also known as outlet. During the ''exhaust'' stroke, the piston, once again, returns from B.D.C. to T.D.C. while the exhaust valve is open. This action expels the spent air-fuel mixture through the exhaust valve.\nThese four strokes can be remembered by the colloquial phrase, \"Suck, Squeeze, Bang, Blow\".\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 0ttO cycle ===\n{{main|Otto cycle}}\n{{see also|Otto engine}}\n[[File:PSM V18 D500 An american internal combustion otto engine.jpg|thumb|left|An Otto Engine from 1880's US Manufacture]]\n\n[[Nikolaus Otto|Nikolaus August Otto]] was a traveling salesman for a grocery concern. In his travels, he encountered the internal combustion engine built in Paris by Belgian expatriate [[\u00c9tienne Lenoir|Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir]].  In 1860, Lenoir successfully created a double-acting engine that ran on illuminating gas at 4% efficiency. The 18&nbsp;litre [[\u00c9tienne Lenoir#Lenoir engine|Lenoir Engine]] produced only 2&nbsp;horsepower. The Lenoir engine ran on illuminating gas made from coal, which had been developed in Paris by [[Philippe le Bon|Philip Lebon]].<ref name=\"NAMuseum\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nicolaus-august-otto.de/node/15 |title=125 Jahre Viertaktmotor |trans-title=125 Years of the Four Stroke Engine |website=Oldtimer Club Nicolaus August Otto e.V. |location=Germany |language=German |url-status=dead |year=2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507083259/http://www.nicolaus-august-otto.de/node/15 |archive-date=2011-05-07}}</ref>\n\nIn testing a replica of the Lenoir engine in 1861, Otto became aware of the effects of compression on the fuel charge. In 1862, Otto attempted to produce an engine to improve on the poor efficiency and reliability of the Lenoir engine. He tried to create an engine that would compress the fuel mixture prior to ignition, but failed as that engine would run no more than a few minutes prior to its destruction. Many other engineers were trying to solve the problem, with no success.<ref name=\"NAMuseum\" />\n\nIn 1864, Otto and [[Eugen Langen]] founded the first internal combustion engine production company, NA Otto and Cie (NA Otto and Company). Otto and Cie succeeded in creating a successful atmospheric engine that same year.<ref name=\"NAMuseum\" />\nThe factory ran out of space and was moved to the town of [[Deutz, Cologne|Deutz]], Germany in 1869, where the company was renamed to [[Deutz AG|Deutz Gasmotorenfabrik AG]] (The Deutz Gas Engine Manufacturing Company).<ref name=\"NAMuseum\" /> In 1872, [[Gottlieb Daimler]] was technical director and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] was the head of engine design. Daimler was a gunsmith who had worked on the Lenoir engine.\nBy 1876, Otto and Langen succeeded in creating the first internal combustion engine that compressed the fuel mixture prior to combustion for far higher efficiency than any engine created to this time.\n\nDaimler and Maybach left their employ at Otto and Cie and developed the first high-speed Otto engine in 1883. In 1885, they produced the first automobile to be equipped with an Otto engine. The [[Daimler Reitwagen|Daimler ''Reitwagen'']] used a hot-tube ignition system and the fuel known as Ligroin to become the world's first vehicle  powered by an internal combustion engine. It used a four-stroke engine based on Otto's design. The following year, [[Karl Benz]] produced a four-stroke engined automobile that is regarded as the first car.<ref>Ralph Stein (1967). The Automobile Book. Paul Hamlyn Ltd</ref>\n\nIn 1884, Otto's company, then known as Gasmotorenfabrik Deutz (GFD), developed electric ignition and the carburetor. In 1890, Daimler and Maybach formed a company known as [[Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft|Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]]. Today, that company is [[Daimler-Benz]].\n\n=== Atkinson cycle ===\n[[Image:Prius2004.JPG|thumb|230px|This 2004 [[Toyota Prius]] hybrid has an Atkinson-cycle engine as the petrol-electric hybrid engine]]\n[[Image:T cycle AtkinsonMiller.png|thumb|170px|The Atkinson Gas Cycle]]\n{{main|Atkinson cycle}}\n\nThe Atkinson-cycle engine is a type of single stroke internal combustion engine invented by [[James Atkinson (inventor)|James Atkinson]] in 1882. The Atkinson cycle is designed to provide efficiency at the expense of [[power density]], and is used in some modern hybrid electric applications.\n\nThe original Atkinson-cycle piston engine allowed the intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes of the four-stroke cycle to occur in a single turn of the crankshaft and was designed to avoid infringing certain patents covering Otto-cycle engines.<ref name=pat367496>{{cite patent|country=US|number=367496|inventor=J. Atkinson|title=Gas Engine|gdate=1887-08-02}}</ref>\n\nDue to the unique [[crankshaft]] design of the Atkinson, its expansion ratio can differ from its compression ratio and, with a power stroke longer than its compression stroke, the engine can achieve greater [[thermal efficiency]] than a traditional piston engine. While Atkinson's original design is no more than a historical curiosity, many modern engines use unconventional valve timing to produce the effect of a shorter compression stroke/longer power stroke, thus realizing the [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] improvements the Atkinson cycle can provide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autos.ca/auto-tech/auto-tech-atkinson-cycle-engines-and-hybrids/ |title=Auto Tech: Atkinson Cycle engines and Hybrids |work=Autos.ca |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2013-02-23}}</ref>\n\n===Diesel cycle===\n{{Main|Diesel cycle}}\n[[File:1 Audi R15.jpg|thumb|right|Audi Diesel R15 at Le Mans]]\n\nThe [[diesel engine]] is a technical refinement of the 1876 Otto-cycle engine. Where Otto had realized in 1861 that the efficiency of the engine could be increased by first compressing the fuel mixture prior to its ignition, [[Rudolf Diesel]] wanted to develop a more efficient type of engine that could run on much heavier fuel. The [[Etienne Lenoir|Lenoir]], Otto Atmospheric, and Otto Compression engines (both 1861 and 1876) were designed to run on [[Coal gas|Illuminating Gas (coal gas)]]. With the same motivation as Otto, Diesel wanted to create an engine that would give small industrial companies their own power source to enable them to compete against larger companies, and like Otto, to get away from the requirement to be tied to a municipal fuel supply. Like Otto, it took more than a decade to produce the high-compression engine that could self-ignite fuel sprayed into the cylinder. Diesel used an air spray combined with fuel in his first engine.\n\nDuring initial development, one of the engines burst, nearly killing Diesel. He persisted, and finally created a successful engine in 1893. The high-compression engine, which ignites its fuel by the heat of compression, is now called the diesel engine, whether a four-stroke or two-stroke design.\n\nThe four-stroke diesel engine has been used in the majority of heavy-duty applications for many decades. It uses a heavy fuel containing more energy and requiring less refinement to produce. The most efficient Otto-cycle engines run near 30% thermal efficiency.\n\n==Thermodynamic analysis==\n[[Image:diagrama pv de ciclo 4tempos.png|right|300px|thumb|The idealized four-stroke Otto cycle [[Pressure volume diagram|p-V diagram]]: the\n<span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #10ff00;\">&nbsp;intake (A)&nbsp;</span>\nstroke is performed by an [[Isobaric process|isobaric]] expansion, followed by the\n<span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #ffae21;\">&nbsp;compression (B)&nbsp;</span>\nstroke, performed by an [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] compression. Through the combustion of fuel an [[isochoric process]] is produced, followed by an adiabatic expansion, characterizing the\n<span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #ff0001;\">&nbsp;power (C)&nbsp;</span>\nstroke. The cycle is closed by an isochoric process and an isobaric compression, characterizing the <span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #639eff;\">&nbsp;exhaust (D)&nbsp;</span>\nstroke.\n]]\n\nThe [[thermodynamic]] analysis of the actual four-stroke and two-stroke cycles is not a simple task. However, the analysis can be simplified significantly if air standard assumptions<ref name=\"airstandard\">{{cite web |url=http://www.betp.net/2011/04/air-standard-assumptions/ |title=Best Place for Engineering and Technology, Air Standard Assumptions |url-status=dead}}{{dead link|date=January 2020}}</ref> are utilized. The resulting cycle, which closely resembles the actual operating conditions, is the Otto cycle.\n\nDuring normal operation of the engine, as the air/fuel mixture is being compressed, an electric spark is created to ignite the mixture. At low rpm this occurs close to TDC (Top Dead Centre). As engine rpm rises, the speed of the flame front does not change so the spark point is advanced earlier in the cycle to allow a greater proportion of the cycle for the charge to combust before the power stroke commences. This advantage is reflected in the various Otto engine designs; the atmospheric (non-compression) engine operates at 12% efficiency whereas the compressed-charge engine has an operating efficiency around 30%.\n\n==Fuel considerations==\nA problem with compressed charge engines is that the temperature rise of the compressed charge can cause pre-ignition. If this occurs at the wrong time and is too energetic, it can damage the engine. Different fractions of petroleum have widely varying flash points (the temperatures at which the fuel may self-ignite). This must be taken into account in engine and fuel design.\n\nThe tendency for the compressed fuel mixture to ignite early is limited by the chemical composition of the fuel. There are several grades of fuel to accommodate differing performance levels of engines. The fuel is altered to change its self ignition temperature. There are several ways to do this. As engines are designed with higher compression ratios the result is that pre-ignition is much more likely to occur since the fuel mixture is compressed to a higher temperature prior to deliberate ignition. The higher temperature more effectively evaporates fuels such as gasoline, which increases the efficiency of the compression engine. Higher [[Compression ratio]]s also means that the distance that the piston can push to produce power is greater (which is called the [[Expansion ratio]]).\n\nThe octane rating of a given fuel is a measure of the fuel's resistance to self-ignition. A fuel with a higher numerical octane rating allows for a higher compression ratio, which extracts more energy from the fuel and more effectively converts that energy into useful work while at the same time preventing engine damage from pre-ignition. High Octane fuel is also more expensive.\n\nMany modern four-stroke engines employ [[gasoline direct injection]] or GDI. In a gasoline direct-injected engine, the injector nozzle protrudes into the combustion chamber. The direct fuel injector injects gasoline under a very high pressure into the cylinder during the compression stroke, when the piston is closer to the top.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.testingautos.com/car_care/four-stroke-engine.html |title= Four-stroke engine: how it works, animation| website= testingautos.com|  accessdate= January 25, 2020}}</ref> Employment of direct fuel injection significantly drops the peak temperature which is a function of both injection timing and quantity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/direct-injection/ |title= Direct-Injection - an overview| website= sciencedirect.com|  accessdate= January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nDiesel engines by their nature do not have concerns with pre-ignition. They have a concern with whether or not combustion can be started. The description of how likely Diesel fuel is to ignite is called the Cetane rating. Because Diesel fuels are of low volatility, they can be very hard to start when cold.  Various techniques are used to start a cold Diesel engine, the most common being the use of a [[glow plug]].\n\n==Design and engineering principles==\n\n=== Power output limitations ===\n[[Image:Ciclo del motore 4T.svg|right|250px|thumb|The four-stroke cycle\n<br>1=TDC\n<br>2=BDC\n<br><span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #10ff00;\">'''&nbsp;A: Intake&nbsp;'''</span>\n<br><span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #ffae21;\">'''&nbsp;B: Compression&nbsp;'''</span>\n<br><span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #ff0000;\">'''&nbsp;C: Power&nbsp;'''</span>\n<br><span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #639eff;\">'''&nbsp;D: Exhaust&nbsp;'''</span>\n]]\n\nThe maximum amount of power generated by an engine is determined by the maximum amount of air ingested. The amount of power generated by a piston engine is related to its size (cylinder volume), whether it is a [[two-stroke engine]] or four-stroke design, [[volumetric efficiency]], losses, air-to-fuel ratio, the calorific value of the fuel, oxygen content of the air and speed ([[revolutions per minute|RPM]]). The speed is ultimately limited by material strength and [[lubrication]]. Valves, pistons and [[connecting rod]]s suffer severe acceleration forces. At high engine speed, physical breakage and [[piston ring]] flutter can occur, resulting in power loss or even engine destruction. [[Piston ring]] flutter occurs when the rings oscillate vertically within the piston grooves they reside in. Ring flutter compromises the seal between the ring and the cylinder wall, which causes a loss of cylinder pressure and power. If an engine spins too quickly, valve springs cannot act quickly enough to close the valves. This is commonly referred to as '[[valve float]]', and it can result in piston to valve contact, severely damaging the engine. At high speeds the lubrication of piston cylinder wall interface tends to break down. This limits the piston speed for industrial engines to about 10&nbsp;m/s.\n\n==== Intake/exhaust port flow ====\nThe output power of an engine is dependent on the ability of intake (air\u2013fuel mixture) and exhaust matter to move quickly through valve ports, typically located in the [[cylinder head]]. To increase an engine's output power, irregularities in the intake and exhaust paths, such as casting flaws, can be removed, and, with the aid of an [[air flow bench]], the radii of valve port turns and [[valve seat]] configuration can be modified to reduce resistance. This process is called [[cylinder head porting|porting]], and it can be done by hand or with a [[CNC]] machine.\n\n=== Waste heat recovery of an internal combustion engine ===\nAn internal combustion engine is on average capable of converting only 40-45% of supplied energy into mechanical work. A large part of the waste energy is in the form of heat that is released to the environment through coolant, fins etc. If we could somehow recover the waste heat we can improve the engine's performance. It has been found that even if 6% of the entirely wasted heat is recovered it can increase the engine efficiency greatly.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sprouse III|first=Charles|last2=Depcik|first2=Christopher|date=2013-03-01|title=Review of organic Rankine cycles for internal combustion engine exhaust waste heat recovery|journal=Applied Thermal Engineering|volume=51|issue=1\u20132|pages=711\u2013722|doi=10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2012.10.017}}</ref>\n\nMany methods have been devised in order to extract waste heat out of an engine exhaust and use it further to extract some useful work, decreasing the exhaust pollutants at the same time. Use of the [[Rankine cycle|Rankine Cycle]], [[turbocharging]] and [[Thermoelectric generator|thermoelectric generation]] can be very useful as a [[waste heat recovery unit|waste heat recovery]] system.\n\nThough these systems are used more frequently some issues, like their low efficiency at lower heat supply rates and high pumping losses, remain a cause of concern. {{Citation needed|reason=The section is sourced to a single paper which, from the abstract, seems to be limited to the Rankine cycle. I have requested the full paper and upon review will either remove or update the template.|date=April 2019}}\n\n==== Supercharging ====\nOne way to increase engine power is to force more air into the cylinder so that more power can be produced from each power stroke. This can be done using some type of air compression device known as a [[supercharger]], which can be powered by the engine crankshaft.\n\nSupercharging increases the power output limits of an internal combustion engine relative to its displacement. Most commonly, the supercharger is always running, but there have been designs that allow it to be cut out or run at varying speeds (relative to engine speed). Mechanically driven supercharging has the disadvantage that some of the output power is used to drive the supercharger, while power is wasted in the high pressure exhaust, as the air has been compressed twice and then gains more potential volume in the combustion but it is only expanded in one stage.\n\n==== Turbocharging ====\nA [[turbocharger]] is a supercharger that is driven by the engine's exhaust gases, by means of a [[turbine]]. A turbocharger is incorporated into the exhaust system of a vehicle to make use of the expelled exhaust. It consists of a two piece, high-speed turbine assembly with one side that compresses the intake air, and the other side that is powered by the exhaust gas outflow.\n\nWhen idling, and at low-to-moderate speeds, the turbine produces little power from the small exhaust volume, the turbocharger has little effect and the engine operates nearly in a naturally aspirated manner. When much more power output is required, the engine speed and throttle opening are increased until the exhaust gases are sufficient to 'spool up' the turbocharger's turbine to start compressing much more air than normal into the intake manifold. Thus, additional power (and speed) is expelled through the function of this turbine.\n\nTurbocharging allows for more efficient engine operation because it is driven by exhaust pressure that would otherwise be (mostly) wasted, but there is a design limitation known as [[turbo lag]]. The increased engine power is not immediately available due to the need to sharply increase engine RPM, to build up pressure and to spin up the turbo, before the turbo starts to do any useful air compression. The increased intake volume causes increased exhaust and spins the turbo faster, and so forth until steady high power operation is reached. Another difficulty is that the higher exhaust pressure causes the exhaust gas to transfer more of its heat to the mechanical parts of the engine.\n\n=== Rod and piston-to-stroke ratio ===\nThe rod-to-stroke ratio is the ratio of the length of the [[connecting rod]] to the length of the piston stroke. A longer rod reduces sidewise pressure of the piston on the cylinder wall and the stress forces, increasing engine life. It also increases the cost and engine height and weight.\n\nA \"square engine\" is an engine with a bore diameter equal to its stroke length. An engine where the bore diameter is larger than its stroke length is an [[oversquare]] engine, conversely, an engine with a bore diameter that is smaller than its stroke length is an undersquare engine.\n\n=== Valve train ===\nThe valves are typically operated by a [[camshaft]] rotating at half the speed of the [[crankshaft]]. It has a series of [[cam]]s along its length, each designed to open a valve during the appropriate part of an intake or exhaust stroke. A [[tappet]] between valve and cam is a contact surface on which the cam slides to open the valve. Many engines use one or more camshafts \u201cabove\u201d a row (or each row) of cylinders, as in the illustration, in which each cam directly actuates a valve through a flat tappet. In other engine designs the camshaft is in the [[crankcase]], in which case each cam usually contacts a [[push rod]], which contacts a [[rocker arm]] that opens a valve, or in case of a [[flathead engine]] a push rod is not necessary. The [[overhead cam]] design typically allows higher engine speeds because it provides the most direct path between cam and valve.\n\n==== Valve clearance ====\nValve clearance refers to the small gap between a valve lifter and a valve stem that ensures that the valve completely closes. On engines with mechanical valve adjustment, excessive clearance causes noise from the valve train. A too small valve clearance can result in the valves not closing properly, this results in a loss of performance and possibly overheating of exhaust valves. Typically, the clearance must be readjusted each {{convert|20000|mi|km}} with a feeler gauge.\n\nMost modern production engines use  [[hydraulic lifters]] to automatically compensate for valve train component wear. Dirty engine oil may cause lifter failure.\n\n===Energy balance===\nOtto engines are about 30% efficient; in other words, 30% of the energy generated by combustion is converted into useful rotational energy at the output shaft of the engine, while the remainder being losses due to waste heat, friction and engine accessories.<ref name=\"OtoE\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ecen.com/content/eee7/motoref.htm |title=Efficiencies of Internal Combustion Engines |first=Omar Campos |last=Ferreira |work=Economia & Energia |location=Brasil |language=Portuguese |date=March 1998 |access-date=2016-04-11}}</ref> There are a number of ways to recover some of the energy lost to waste heat. The use of a Turbocharger in Diesel engines is very effective by boosting incoming air pressure and in effect, provides the same increase in performance as having more displacement. The Mack Truck company, decades ago, developed a turbine system that converted waste heat into kinetic energy that it fed  back into the engine's transmission. In 2005, BMW announced the development of the [[turbosteamer]], a two-stage heat-recovery system similar to the Mack system that recovers 80% of the energy in the exhaust gas and raises the efficiency of an Otto engine by 15%.<ref name=\"BMWTS\">{{cite news |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2005/12/09/bmw-turbosteamer-gets-hot-and-goes/ |title=BMW Turbo Steamer Gets Hot and Goes |first=John |last=Neff |work=Autoblog |date=2005-12-09 |access-date=2016-04-11}}</ref> By contrast, a [[six-stroke engine]] may reduce fuel consumption by as much as 40%.\n\nModern engines are often intentionally built to be slightly less efficient than they could otherwise be. This is necessary for [[Vehicle emissions control|emission controls]] such as [[exhaust gas recirculation]] and [[catalytic converter]]s that reduce [[smog]] and other atmospheric pollutants. Reductions in efficiency may be counteracted with an [[engine control unit]] using [[Lean-burn|lean burn techniques]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Air pollution from motor vehicles: Standards and Technologies for Controlling Emissions |first1=Asif |last1=Faiz |first2=Christopher S. |last2=Weaver |first3=Michael P. |last3=Walsh |publisher=World Bank Publications |year=1996 |isbn=9780821334447}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] mandates that vehicles must achieve an average of {{convert|34.9|mpgus|abbr=on|1}} compared to the current standard of {{convert|25|mpgus|abbr=on|1}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/fuel-economy|title=Fuel Economy |publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)|location=US|accessdate=2016-04-11}}</ref> As automakers look to meet these standards by 2016, new ways of engineering the traditional [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE) have to be considered.

The cylinder wall is a thin sleeve surrounding the piston head which creates a space for the combustion of fuel and the genesis of mechanical '''four-stroke''' (also '''four-cycle''') '''engine''' is an [[internal combustion]] (IC) engine in which the [[piston]] completes four separate strokes while turning the crankshaft. A stroke refers to the full travel of the piston along the cylinder, in either direction. The four separate strokes are termed:\n#'''Intake''': Also known as induction or suction. This stroke of the piston begins at top dead center (T.D.C.) and ends at bottom dead center (B.D.C.). In this stroke the intake valve must be in the open position while the piston pulls an air-fuel mixture into the cylinder by producing vacuum pressure into the cylinder through its downward motion. The piston is moving down as air is being sucked in by the downward motion against the piston.\n#'''Compression''': This stroke begins at B.D.C, or just at the end of the suction stroke, and ends at T.D.C.  In this stroke the piston compresses the air-fuel mixture in preparation for ignition during the power stroke (below). Both the intake and exhaust valves are closed during this stage.\n#'''Combustion''': Also known as power or ignition. This is the start of the second revolution of the four stroke cycle. At this point the crankshaft has completed a full 360 degree revolution. While the piston is at T.D.C. (the end of the compression stroke) the compressed air-fuel mixture is ignited by a [[spark plug]] (in a gasoline engine) or by heat generated by high compression (diesel engines), forcefully returning the piston to B.D.C. This stroke produces mechanical work from the engine to turn the crankshaft.\n#'''Exhaust''': Also known as outlet. During the ''exhaust'' stroke, the piston, once again, returns from B.D.C. to T.D.C. while the exhaust valve is open. This action expels the spent air-fuel mixture through the exhaust valve.\nThese four strokes can be remembered by the colloquial phrase, \"Suck, Squeeze, Bang, Blow\".\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 0ttO cycle ===\n{{main|Otto cycle}}\n{{see also|Otto engine}}\n[[File:PSM V18 D500 An american internal combustion otto engine.jpg|thumb|left|An Otto Engine from 1880's US Manufacture]]\n\n[[Nikolaus Otto|Nikolaus August Otto]] was a traveling salesman for a grocery concern. In his travels, he encountered the internal combustion engine built in Paris by Belgian expatriate [[\u00c9tienne Lenoir|Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir]].  In 1860, Lenoir successfully created a double-acting engine that ran on illuminating gas at 4% efficiency. The 18&nbsp;litre [[\u00c9tienne Lenoir#Lenoir engine|Lenoir Engine]] produced only 2&nbsp;horsepower. The Lenoir engine ran on illuminating gas made from coal, which had been developed in Paris by [[Philippe le Bon|Philip Lebon]].<ref name=\"NAMuseum\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nicolaus-august-otto.de/node/15 |title=125 Jahre Viertaktmotor |trans-title=125 Years of the Four Stroke Engine |website=Oldtimer Club Nicolaus August Otto e.V. |location=Germany |language=German |url-status=dead |year=2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507083259/http://www.nicolaus-august-otto.de/node/15 |archive-date=2011-05-07}}</ref>\n\nIn testing a replica of the Lenoir engine in 1861, Otto became aware of the effects of compression on the fuel charge. In 1862, Otto attempted to produce an engine to improve on the poor efficiency and reliability of the Lenoir engine. He tried to create an engine that would compress the fuel mixture prior to ignition, but failed as that engine would run no more than a few minutes prior to its destruction. Many other engineers were trying to solve the problem, with no success.<ref name=\"NAMuseum\" />\n\nIn 1864, Otto and [[Eugen Langen]] founded the first internal combustion engine production company, NA Otto and Cie (NA Otto and Company). Otto and Cie succeeded in creating a successful atmospheric engine that same year.<ref name=\"NAMuseum\" />\nThe factory ran out of space and was moved to the town of [[Deutz, Cologne|Deutz]], Germany in 1869, where the company was renamed to [[Deutz AG|Deutz Gasmotorenfabrik AG]] (The Deutz Gas Engine Manufacturing Company).<ref name=\"NAMuseum\" /> In 1872, [[Gottlieb Daimler]] was technical director and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] was the head of engine design. Daimler was a gunsmith who had worked on the Lenoir engine.\nBy 1876, Otto and Langen succeeded in creating the first internal combustion engine that compressed the fuel mixture prior to combustion for far higher efficiency than any engine created to this time.\n\nDaimler and Maybach left their employ at Otto and Cie and developed the first high-speed Otto engine in 1883. In 1885, they produced the first automobile to be equipped with an Otto engine. The [[Daimler Reitwagen|Daimler ''Reitwagen'']] used a hot-tube ignition system and the fuel known as Ligroin to become the world's first vehicle  powered by an internal combustion engine. It used a four-stroke engine based on Otto's design. The following year, [[Karl Benz]] produced a four-stroke engined automobile that is regarded as the first car.<ref>Ralph Stein (1967). The Automobile Book. Paul Hamlyn Ltd</ref>\n\nIn 1884, Otto's company, then known as Gasmotorenfabrik Deutz (GFD), developed electric ignition and the carburetor. In 1890, Daimler and Maybach formed a company known as [[Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft|Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]]. Today, that company is [[Daimler-Benz]].\n\n=== Atkinson cycle ===\n[[Image:Prius2004.JPG|thumb|230px|This 2004 [[Toyota Prius]] hybrid has an Atkinson-cycle engine as the petrol-electric hybrid engine]]\n[[Image:T cycle AtkinsonMiller.png|thumb|170px|The Atkinson Gas Cycle]]\n{{main|Atkinson cycle}}\n\nThe Atkinson-cycle engine is a type of single stroke internal combustion engine invented by [[James Atkinson (inventor)|James Atkinson]] in 1882. The Atkinson cycle is designed to provide efficiency at the expense of [[power density]], and is used in some modern hybrid electric applications.\n\nThe original Atkinson-cycle piston engine allowed the intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes of the four-stroke cycle to occur in a single turn of the crankshaft and was designed to avoid infringing certain patents covering Otto-cycle engines.<ref name=pat367496>{{cite patent|country=US|number=367496|inventor=J. Atkinson|title=Gas Engine|gdate=1887-08-02}}</ref>\n\nDue to the unique [[crankshaft]] design of the Atkinson, its expansion ratio can differ from its compression ratio and, with a power stroke longer than its compression stroke, the engine can achieve greater [[thermal efficiency]] than a traditional piston engine. While Atkinson's original design is no more than a historical curiosity, many modern engines use unconventional valve timing to produce the effect of a shorter compression stroke/longer power stroke, thus realizing the [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] improvements the Atkinson cycle can provide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autos.ca/auto-tech/auto-tech-atkinson-cycle-engines-and-hybrids/ |title=Auto Tech: Atkinson Cycle engines and Hybrids |work=Autos.ca |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2013-02-23}}</ref>\n\n===Diesel cycle===\n{{Main|Diesel cycle}}\n[[File:1 Audi R15.jpg|thumb|right|Audi Diesel R15 at Le Mans]]\n\nThe [[diesel engine]] is a technical refinement of the 1876 Otto-cycle engine. Where Otto had realized in 1861 that the efficiency of the engine could be increased by first compressing the fuel mixture prior to its ignition, [[Rudolf Diesel]] wanted to develop a more efficient type of engine that could run on much heavier fuel. The [[Etienne Lenoir|Lenoir]], Otto Atmospheric, and Otto Compression engines (both 1861 and 1876) were designed to run on [[Coal gas|Illuminating Gas (coal gas)]]. With the same motivation as Otto, Diesel wanted to create an engine that would give small industrial companies their own power source to enable them to compete against larger companies, and like Otto, to get away from the requirement to be tied to a municipal fuel supply. Like Otto, it took more than a decade to produce the high-compression engine that could self-ignite fuel sprayed into the cylinder. Diesel used an air spray combined with fuel in his first engine.\n\nDuring initial development, one of the engines burst, nearly killing Diesel. He persisted, and finally created a successful engine in 1893. The high-compression engine, which ignites its fuel by the heat of compression, is now called the diesel engine, whether a four-stroke or two-stroke design.\n\nThe four-stroke diesel engine has been used in the majority of heavy-duty applications for many decades. It uses a heavy fuel containing more energy and requiring less refinement to produce. The most efficient Otto-cycle engines run near 30% thermal efficiency.\n\n==Thermodynamic analysis==\n[[Image:diagrama pv de ciclo 4tempos.png|right|300px|thumb|The idealized four-stroke Otto cycle [[Pressure volume diagram|p-V diagram]]: the\n<span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #10ff00;\">&nbsp;intake (A)&nbsp;</span>\nstroke is performed by an [[Isobaric process|isobaric]] expansion, followed by the\n<span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #ffae21;\">&nbsp;compression (B)&nbsp;</span>\nstroke, performed by an [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] compression. Through the combustion of fuel an [[isochoric process]] is produced, followed by an adiabatic expansion, characterizing the\n<span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #ff0001;\">&nbsp;power (C)&nbsp;</span>\nstroke. The cycle is closed by an isochoric process and an isobaric compression, characterizing the <span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #639eff;\">&nbsp;exhaust (D)&nbsp;</span>\nstroke.\n]]\n\nThe [[thermodynamic]] analysis of the actual four-stroke and two-stroke cycles is not a simple task. However, the analysis can be simplified significantly if air standard assumptions<ref name=\"airstandard\">{{cite web |url=http://www.betp.net/2011/04/air-standard-assumptions/ |title=Best Place for Engineering and Technology, Air Standard Assumptions |url-status=dead}}{{dead link|date=January 2020}}</ref> are utilized. The resulting cycle, which closely resembles the actual operating conditions, is the Otto cycle.\n\nDuring normal operation of the engine, as the air/fuel mixture is being compressed, an electric spark is created to ignite the mixture. At low rpm this occurs close to TDC (Top Dead Centre). As engine rpm rises, the speed of the flame front does not change so the spark point is advanced earlier in the cycle to allow a greater proportion of the cycle for the charge to combust before the power stroke commences. This advantage is reflected in the various Otto engine designs; the atmospheric (non-compression) engine operates at 12% efficiency whereas the compressed-charge engine has an operating efficiency around 30%.\n\n==Fuel considerations==\nA problem with compressed charge engines is that the temperature rise of the compressed charge can cause pre-ignition. If this occurs at the wrong time and is too energetic, it can damage the engine. Different fractions of petroleum have widely varying flash points (the temperatures at which the fuel may self-ignite). This must be taken into account in engine and fuel design.\n\nThe tendency for the compressed fuel mixture to ignite early is limited by the chemical composition of the fuel. There are several grades of fuel to accommodate differing performance levels of engines. The fuel is altered to change its self ignition temperature. There are several ways to do this. As engines are designed with higher compression ratios the result is that pre-ignition is much more likely to occur since the fuel mixture is compressed to a higher temperature prior to deliberate ignition. The higher temperature more effectively evaporates fuels such as gasoline, which increases the efficiency of the compression engine. Higher [[Compression ratio]]s also means that the distance that the piston can push to produce power is greater (which is called the [[Expansion ratio]]).\n\nThe octane rating of a given fuel is a measure of the fuel's resistance to self-ignition. A fuel with a higher numerical octane rating allows for a higher compression ratio, which extracts more energy from the fuel and more effectively converts that energy into useful work while at the same time preventing engine damage from pre-ignition. High Octane fuel is also more expensive.\n\nMany modern four-stroke engines employ [[gasoline direct injection]] or GDI. In a gasoline direct-injected engine, the injector nozzle protrudes into the combustion chamber. The direct fuel injector injects gasoline under a very high pressure into the cylinder during the compression stroke, when the piston is closer to the top.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.testingautos.com/car_care/four-stroke-engine.html |title= Four-stroke engine: how it works, animation| website= testingautos.com|  accessdate= January 25, 2020}}</ref> Employment of direct fuel injection significantly drops the peak temperature which is a function of both injection timing and quantity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/direct-injection/ |title= Direct-Injection - an overview| website= sciencedirect.com|  accessdate= January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nDiesel engines by their nature do not have concerns with pre-ignition. They have a concern with whether or not combustion can be started. The description of how likely Diesel fuel is to ignite is called the Cetane rating. Because Diesel fuels are of low volatility, they can be very hard to start when cold.  Various techniques are used to start a cold Diesel engine, the most common being the use of a [[glow plug]].\n\n==Design and engineering principles==\n\n=== Power output limitations ===\n[[Image:Ciclo del motore 4T.svg|right|250px|thumb|The four-stroke cycle\n<br>1=TDC\n<br>2=BDC\n<br><span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #10ff00;\">'''&nbsp;A: Intake&nbsp;'''</span>\n<br><span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #ffae21;\">'''&nbsp;B: Compression&nbsp;'''</span>\n<br><span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #ff0000;\">'''&nbsp;C: Power&nbsp;'''</span>\n<br><span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #639eff;\">'''&nbsp;D: Exhaust&nbsp;'''</span>\n]]\n\nThe maximum amount of power generated by an engine is determined by the maximum amount of air ingested. The amount of power generated by a piston engine is related to its size (cylinder volume), whether it is a [[two-stroke engine]] or four-stroke design, [[volumetric efficiency]], losses, air-to-fuel ratio, the calorific value of the fuel, oxygen content of the air and speed ([[revolutions per minute|RPM]]). The speed is ultimately limited by material strength and [[lubrication]]. Valves, pistons and [[connecting rod]]s suffer severe acceleration forces. At high engine speed, physical breakage and [[piston ring]] flutter can occur, resulting in power loss or even engine destruction. [[Piston ring]] flutter occurs when the rings oscillate vertically within the piston grooves they reside in. Ring flutter compromises the seal between the ring and the cylinder wall, which causes a loss of cylinder pressure and power. If an engine spins too quickly, valve springs cannot act quickly enough to close the valves. This is commonly referred to as '[[valve float]]', and it can result in piston to valve contact, severely damaging the engine. At high speeds the lubrication of piston cylinder wall interface tends to break down. This limits the piston speed for industrial engines to about 10&nbsp;m/s.\n\n==== Intake/exhaust port flow ====\nThe output power of an engine is dependent on the ability of intake (air\u2013fuel mixture) and exhaust matter to move quickly through valve ports, typically located in the [[cylinder head]]. To increase an engine's output power, irregularities in the intake and exhaust paths, such as casting flaws, can be removed, and, with the aid of an [[air flow bench]], the radii of valve port turns and [[valve seat]] configuration can be modified to reduce resistance. This process is called [[cylinder head porting|porting]], and it can be done by hand or with a [[CNC]] machine.\n\n=== Waste heat recovery of an internal combustion engine ===\nAn internal combustion engine is on average capable of converting only 40-45% of supplied energy into mechanical work. A large part of the waste energy is in the form of heat that is released to the environment through coolant, fins etc. If we could somehow recover the waste heat we can improve the engine's performance. It has been found that even if 6% of the entirely wasted heat is recovered it can increase the engine efficiency greatly.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sprouse III|first=Charles|last2=Depcik|first2=Christopher|date=2013-03-01|title=Review of organic Rankine cycles for internal combustion engine exhaust waste heat recovery|journal=Applied Thermal Engineering|volume=51|issue=1\u20132|pages=711\u2013722|doi=10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2012.10.017}}</ref>\n\nMany methods have been devised in order to extract waste heat out of an engine exhaust and use it further to extract some useful work, decreasing the exhaust pollutants at the same time. Use of the [[Rankine cycle|Rankine Cycle]], [[turbocharging]] and [[Thermoelectric generator|thermoelectric generation]] can be very useful as a [[waste heat recovery unit|waste heat recovery]] system.\n\nThough these systems are used more frequently some issues, like their low efficiency at lower heat supply rates and high pumping losses, remain a cause of concern. {{Citation needed|reason=The section is sourced to a single paper which, from the abstract, seems to be limited to the Rankine cycle. I have requested the full paper and upon review will either remove or update the template.|date=April 2019}}\n\n==== Supercharging ====\nOne way to increase engine power is to force more air into the cylinder so that more power can be produced from each power stroke. This can be done using some type of air compression device known as a [[supercharger]], which can be powered by the engine crankshaft.\n\nSupercharging increases the power output limits of an internal combustion engine relative to its displacement. Most commonly, the supercharger is always running, but there have been designs that allow it to be cut out or run at varying speeds (relative to engine speed). Mechanically driven supercharging has the disadvantage that some of the output power is used to drive the supercharger, while power is wasted in the high pressure exhaust, as the air has been compressed twice and then gains more potential volume in the combustion but it is only expanded in one stage.\n\n==== Turbocharging ====\nA [[turbocharger]] is a supercharger that is driven by the engine's exhaust gases, by means of a [[turbine]]. A turbocharger is incorporated into the exhaust system of a vehicle to make use of the expelled exhaust. It consists of a two piece, high-speed turbine assembly with one side that compresses the intake air, and the other side that is powered by the exhaust gas outflow.\n\nWhen idling, and at low-to-moderate speeds, the turbine produces little power from the small exhaust volume, the turbocharger has little effect and the engine operates nearly in a naturally aspirated manner. When much more power output is required, the engine speed and throttle opening are increased until the exhaust gases are sufficient to 'spool up' the turbocharger's turbine to start compressing much more air than normal into the intake manifold. Thus, additional power (and speed) is expelled through the function of this turbine.\n\nTurbocharging allows for more efficient engine operation because it is driven by exhaust pressure that would otherwise be (mostly) wasted, but there is a design limitation known as [[turbo lag]]. The increased engine power is not immediately available due to the need to sharply increase engine RPM, to build up pressure and to spin up the turbo, before the turbo starts to do any useful air compression. The increased intake volume causes increased exhaust and spins the turbo faster, and so forth until steady high power operation is reached. Another difficulty is that the higher exhaust pressure causes the exhaust gas to transfer more of its heat to the mechanical parts of the engine.\n\n=== Rod and piston-to-stroke ratio ===\nThe rod-to-stroke ratio is the ratio of the length of the [[connecting rod]] to the length of the piston stroke. A longer rod reduces sidewise pressure of the piston on the cylinder wall and the stress forces, increasing engine life. It also increases the cost and engine height and weight.\n\nA \"square engine\" is an engine with a bore diameter equal to its stroke length. An engine where the bore diameter is larger than its stroke length is an [[oversquare]] engine, conversely, an engine with a bore diameter that is smaller than its stroke length is an undersquare engine.\n\n=== Valve train ===\nThe valves are typically operated by a [[camshaft]] rotating at half the speed of the [[crankshaft]]. It has a series of [[cam]]s along its length, each designed to open a valve during the appropriate part of an intake or exhaust stroke. A [[tappet]] between valve and cam is a contact surface on which the cam slides to open the valve. Many engines use one or more camshafts \u201cabove\u201d a row (or each row) of cylinders, as in the illustration, in which each cam directly actuates a valve through a flat tappet. In other engine designs the camshaft is in the [[crankcase]], in which case each cam usually contacts a [[push rod]], which contacts a [[rocker arm]] that opens a valve, or in case of a [[flathead engine]] a push rod is not necessary. The [[overhead cam]] design typically allows higher engine speeds because it provides the most direct path between cam and valve.\n\n==== Valve clearance ====\nValve clearance refers to the small gap between a valve lifter and a valve stem that ensures that the valve completely closes. On engines with mechanical valve adjustment, excessive clearance causes noise from the valve train. A too small valve clearance can result in the valves not closing properly, this results in a loss of performance and possibly overheating of exhaust valves. Typically, the clearance must be readjusted each {{convert|20000|mi|km}} with a feeler gauge.\n\nMost modern production engines use  [[hydraulic lifters]] to automatically compensate for valve train component wear. Dirty engine oil may cause lifter failure.\n\n===Energy balance===\nOtto engines are about 30% efficient; in other words, 30% of the energy generated by combustion is converted into useful rotational energy at the output shaft of the engine, while the remainder being losses due to waste heat, friction and engine accessories.<ref name=\"OtoE\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ecen.com/content/eee7/motoref.htm |title=Efficiencies of Internal Combustion Engines |first=Omar Campos |last=Ferreira |work=Economia & Energia |location=Brasil |language=Portuguese |date=March 1998 |access-date=2016-04-11}}</ref> There are a number of ways to recover some of the energy lost to waste heat. The use of a Turbocharger in Diesel engines is very effective by boosting incoming air pressure and in effect, provides the same increase in performance as having more displacement. The Mack Truck company, decades ago, developed a turbine system that converted waste heat into kinetic energy that it fed  back into the engine's transmission. In 2005, BMW announced the development of the [[turbosteamer]], a two-stage heat-recovery system similar to the Mack system that recovers 80% of the energy in the exhaust gas and raises the efficiency of an Otto engine by 15%.<ref name=\"BMWTS\">{{cite news |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2005/12/09/bmw-turbosteamer-gets-hot-and-goes/ |title=BMW Turbo Steamer Gets Hot and Goes |first=John |last=Neff |work=Autoblog |date=2005-12-09 |access-date=2016-04-11}}</ref> By contrast, a [[six-stroke engine]] may reduce fuel consumption by as much as 40%.\n\nModern engines are often intentionally built to be slightly less efficient than they could otherwise be. This is necessary for [[Vehicle emissions control|emission controls]] such as [[exhaust gas recirculation]] and [[catalytic converter]]s that reduce [[smog]] and other atmospheric pollutants. Reductions in efficiency may be counteracted with an [[engine control unit]] using [[Lean-burn|lean burn techniques]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Air pollution from motor vehicles: Standards and Technologies for Controlling Emissions |first1=Asif |last1=Faiz |first2=Christopher S. |last2=Weaver |first3=Michael P. |last3=Walsh |publisher=World Bank Publications |year=1996 |isbn=9780821334447}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] mandates that vehicles must achieve an average of {{convert|34.9|mpgus|abbr=on|1}} compared to the current standard of {{convert|25|mpgus|abbr=on|1}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/fuel-economy|title=Fuel Economy |publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)|location=US|accessdate=2016-04-11}}</ref> As automakers look to meet these standards by 2016, new ways of engineering the traditional [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE) have to be considered.

As an adult, she recalled that she had made five trips to Australia and, at the age of eight, had seen a bullfight at [[Mazatl\u00e1n|Mazatlan]], Mexico.{{sfnp|Killman|2016|page=284}}\n\nCaptain Killman instructed his daughter while at sea and she had to study hard.

None of the crew of eleven was seriously injured.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith no land in sight and no life-boats, the crew had no immediate choice but to stay with the floating hulk of the ''Lyman D.

The cook dodged about the galley and attacked another sailor with his axe, cutting him in about eight different places. The mate fired two shots into the galley. In the meantime, the cook soaked the gallery in kerosene and set fire to it. The cook was then subdued, handcuffed, and tied to the main mast. Using the pumps, the fire was extinguished. When the crew returned on deck, they found the cook had untied the rope with which he had been secured and, before anyone could catch him, he said \"Goodbye,\" and committed suicide by jumping overboard.

Foster'' was Captain Daniel O. Killman,{{sfnp|Killman|2016|page=83}} who retained command until the ship was abandoned in 1913.\n\nMuch is known of Killman's life at sea because he wrote an autobiography \"Forty Years Master: a life in sail & steam\". His nickname amongst seafarers was \"Crazy Killman\", not so much due to his mental state but his single-minded determination.\n\nUnusually, Killman's wife, Minnie, and his daughter accompanied him on voyages. His eldest daughter, Catherine Sudden Killman (named for Killman's previous command, the barquentine ''Catherine Sudden''), spent most of the first fourteen years of her life at sea aboard the ''Lyman D. Foster''. During that time she visited many countries and ports. As an adult, she recalled that she had made five trips to Australia and, at the age of eight, had seen a bullfight at [[Mazatl\u00e1n|Mazatlan]], Mexico.{{sfnp|Killman|2016|page=284}}\n\nCaptain Killman instructed his daughter while at sea and she had to study hard. She went on to become a school teacher in Tacoma.{{sfnp|Killman|2016|page=284}}\n\n==== Explosion (1904) ====\nAlthough the ''Lyman D. Foster'' relied on her sails for propulsion, like many ocean-going sailing vessels of the time, she was fitted with a steam boiler and [[Steam donkey|donkey-engine]]. This engine reduced the manual labour needed to operate the vessel, by powering winches and pumps.\n\nLeaving [[Puget Sound]] on a voyage to Sydney in 1904, the schooner was towed out from [[Bellingham, Washington|Whatcom]]\u2014her loading port\u2014and was abreast of [[Cape Flattery]], when there was a terrific explosion.\n\nThe boiler of the donkey engine had burst and completely wrecked the deck house in the vicinity. The donkey-engine Itself was also smashed to pieces, one portion crashing into a lifeboat and damaging it beyond repair.\n\nThe cook of the vessel was the only man hurt by the explosion. He was picked up among the wreckage, and was found  to be badly scalded.

The first is a nearly contemporaneous account given by a steward from the schooner, as reported in the [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]] of 16 May 1913:<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article240062132|title=A Thrilling Story of the Sea|date=1913-05-16|work=Daily Telegraph (Sydney, NSW: 1883\u20131930)|access-date=2018-03-01|pages=11}}</ref> The second account is that of Captain Killman, as reported in the Tacoma Daily Ledger of 3 August 1913\u2014and so written just over four months after the event\u2014which is quoted in the notes accompanying his autobiography.{{sfnp|Killman|2016|pp=296\u2013299}} The third is the one written many years after the event, also by Captain Killman, which is included in his autobiography.{{sfnp|Killman|2016|pages=119\u2013130}} The three accounts differ only slightly and are aligned concerning the sequence of events.\n\nThe hurricane struck the Lyman D. Foster between noon on 15 April 1913, when the wind began steadily increasing in force,  and the following early morning. According to Captain Killman, the first damage to the ship occurred at around 9:00&nbsp;p.m. when the a foresail blew away, and around 10:30&nbsp;p.m. waves began breaking over the deck of the ship.{{sfnp|Killman|2016|pp=296\u2013299}}\n\nThe schooner was carrying a portion of its cargo of lumber on the deck. Waves breaking over the deck shifted this deck-cargo and soon carried it over the sides of the ship. Approximately a third of the cargo was lost. in this way.<ref name=\":1\" /> Next, the main-mast broke in two and the loose part went over the side, unfortunately tearing way the [[Chainplate|chainplates]] in the process. The damage put great strain on the fore-mast, which also broke. The mizzen-mast broke next and\u2014relatively gently\u2014came to rest on the deck, but in doing so damaged the steering gear. By the morning, the rudder was gone.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe crew had no sleep that night but did manage to cut away the broken mizzen-mast.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDaylight revealed the extent of the damage; all the masts, the rudder and all the boats had been lost, together with a third of the cargo. The schooner was still afloat, but only just. The ship had taken on a lot of water. She had drawn 17-feet when leaving port fully laden but was now drawing 22-feet and so sitting very low in the water. None of the crew of eleven was seriously injured.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith no land in sight and no life-boats, the crew had no immediate choice but to stay with the floating hulk of the ''Lyman D. Foster'', despite the risk that swelling of the wet lumber cargo would damage the hull. They did however still have some charts\u2014they were able to establish that they were drifting toward Fiji\u2014some canned-meat and canned-fruits,<ref name=\":1\" /> and the remainder of the cargo of lumber. They also had 800 gallons of fresh water on board.\n\nCaptain D. O. Killman and the other ten members of the crew built two makeshift [[scow]]s, using wood from the cargo and nails and other materials that they retrieved from the ship. They caulked the scows using rope ''a''nd molten beeswax and made some sails.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe crew sighted a steamer but that ship did not see them, possibly because, without masts and low in the water, the ''Lyman D. Foster'' would not be visible at a distance.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOn 1 May 1913, an island was sighted about 20-miles distant and it was decided that this was their best opportunity. The ship was abandoned at 8 a.m <ref name=\":1\" /> and it took the rest of the day to reach the island of [[Kabara, Fiji|Kabara]]\u2014pronounced  [[Help:IPA/Fijian|[kam\u02c8bara]]] .<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article158752400|title=Lyman D.

From there they proceeded to [[Levuka]] by [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], arriving on 5 May 1913.<ref name=\":2\" /> After reaching Australia aboard a steamer, Captain Killman accepted command of the schooner ''H.K.Hall'' in Sydney.\n\n=== Salvage and sale ===\nOnce the ''Lyman D. Foster'' had been abandoned by its captain and crew, it became possible for other ships to attempt to recover the ship.\n\nThe ''Lyman D.

The dredge was named for the wife of the then Governor of Fiji, Sir [[Ernest Bickham Sweet-Escott]].\n\nBy 1916, the shipping losses during World War 1 had resulted in a huge increase in the value of ship's hulls and, when the government no longer needed the dredge, it was put up for sale by tender.<ref name=\"THE DREDGE LADY ESCOTT TO BE SOLD\"/> By June 1917, the dredge had been sold to the Kaipara Steamship Company of [[Auckland]], New Zealand.\n\nIn the 1920s, there was a Fiji Government yacht also named after Lady Escott.

He held the [[NYSAC]] [[welterweight]] world title in 1972 and challenged for welterweight world championships on three occasions; the unified [[World Boxing Association|WBA]], and [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] titles twice in 1971 and 1974; and the WBC title in 1976. As an amateur, he won the National [[Golden Gloves]] [[lightweight]] title in 1964 and the welterweight title in 1966.<ref>Lindy Lindell, \"Metro Detroit Boxing\"</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n\nLewis was initially taken under the wing of Detroit-based coach Luther Burgess, who presided over his formative boxing years and was later trained by [[Eddie Futch]]. Due to Lewis\u2019s exciting style, he soon attracted the attention of Hollywood. His management company consisted of actors and entertainment stars such as [[Ryan O\u2019Neal]], [[Bill Cosby]] and [[Robert Goulet]].\n\nRacing through the early part of his career, Lewis was victorious in his first 22 fights. He fought out of Detroit initially, before basing himself in Los Angeles. Establishing himself as one of boxing\u2019s top prospects, Lewis was poised to take on his biggest fight to date, against Ernie \u2018Indian Red\u2019 Lopez.  In the first 4 rounds, Lewis outclassed his opponent, before Lopez came from behind to win.\n\nLewis bounced back to win his next five fights, including defeating highly rated contender Oscar \"Shotgun\" Albarado over ten rounds. This set the stage for a rematch against former foe [[Ernie Lopez]]. In a closely fought and exciting contest, Lewis picked up the decision, flooring his opponent in round 4.<ref>Boxrec, \"Professional boxing record for Hedgemon Lewis\", \"http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=012562&cat=boxer {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102035952/http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=012562&cat=boxer |date=November 2, 2012 }}\"</ref>\n\n===Fighting for the world title===\n\nEmbarking on a succession of impressive wins, Lewis improved his record to 40-3. In December 1971, Lewis took on Cuban fighter [[Jose Napoles]] for the WBC and WBA World Welterweight titles. The bout was tightly contested, with Lewis pushing the world champion for the full 15 rounds. The decision went to Napoles, but all 3 judges scorecards registered a very close fight. Still at a relatively young age of 25, Lewis returned to winning ways, racking up 11 straight wins on the bounce. This included a doubleheader against former world champion [[Billy Backus]].\n\nLewis traveled to Syracuse, New York, the home town of Backus, for the first bout in June 1972. In what turned out to be one of the fights of the year, Lewis dropped his rival in round 4 on his way to a decision victory. In the rematch, later on, that year, Lewis would once again claim victory.<ref>Harry Mullan, \"Great Book of Boxing\"</ref> In defeating Backus, Lewis picked up the New York version of the World Welterweight title. He also gained the admiration of the New York boxing scene. Continuing on with varying degrees of success, Lewis would fight twice more for the world title, including a rematch against Jose Napoles, without success.<ref>Peter Arnold, \"The illustrated encyclopedia of world boxing\"</ref> Hedgemon Lewis retired in 1976 at the age of 30. His final career record read 53-7-2. Lewis was inducted into the California Boxing Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\n==Post professional boxing career==\n\nNot yet finished with the sport, Lewis became a noted coach and cornerman in the world of boxing. He worked the corners with legendary figures such as Eddie Futch, Thell Torrence and [[Freddie Roach (boxing)|Freddy Roach]]. He would play a key role as part of Futch\u2019s camp in the epic \u2018Thriller in Manila\u2019 fight. Lewis trained fighters until his death. Outside of boxing, he also achieved success in the Los Angeles real estate market.<ref>Harry Mullan, \"Great Book of Boxing\"</ref> He died on March 31, 2020 at the age of 74.<ref>[https://fightnews.com/hedgemon-lewis-passes-away/72262]</ref>\n\n==Professional boxing record==\n{{S-start}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"|'''53 Wins''' (26 knockouts, 27 decisions), ''' 7 Losses''' (4 knockouts, 3 decisions), '''2 Draws'''<ref>{{cite web | url =http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=012562&cat=boxer | title =Hedgemon Lewis professional boxing record | publisher =BoxRec.com | access-date =February 2, 2011 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20121102035952/http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=012562&cat=boxer | archive-date =November 2, 2012 | url-status =dead }}</ref>\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#e3e3e3;\"\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Res.'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Record'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Opponent'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Type'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Rd., Time'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Date'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Location'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Notes'''\n|- align=center\n|{{no2}}Loss\n|align=center|53-7-2||align=left|{{flagicon|England}} [[John H.

He held the [[NYSAC]] [[welterweight]] world title in 1972 and challenged for welterweight world championships on three occasions; the unified [[World Boxing Association|WBA]], and [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] titles twice in 1971 and 1974; and the WBC title in 1976. As an amateur, he won the National [[Golden Gloves]] [[lightweight]] title in 1964 and the welterweight title in 1966.<ref>Lindy Lindell, \"Metro Detroit Boxing\"</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n\nLewis was initially taken under the wing of Detroit-based coach Luther Burgess, who presided over his formative boxing years and was later trained by [[Eddie Futch]]. Due to Lewis\u2019s exciting style, he soon attracted the attention of Hollywood. His management company consisted of actors and entertainment stars such as [[Ryan O\u2019Neal]], [[Bill Cosby]] and [[Robert Goulet]].\n\nRacing through the early part of his career, Lewis was victorious in his first 22 fights. He fought out of Detroit initially, before basing himself in Los Angeles. Establishing himself as one of boxing\u2019s top prospects, Lewis was poised to take on his biggest fight to date, against Ernie \u2018Indian Red\u2019 Lopez.  In the first 4 rounds, Lewis outclassed his opponent, before Lopez came from behind to win.\n\nLewis bounced back to win his next 5 fights back to back, including defeating highly rated contender Oscar \"Shotgun\" Albarado over ten rounds. This set the stage for a rematch against former foe [[Ernie Lopez]]. In a closely fought and exciting contest, Lewis picked up the decision, flooring his opponent in round 4.<ref>Boxrec, \"Professional boxing record for Hedgemon Lewis\", \"http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=012562&cat=boxer {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102035952/http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=012562&cat=boxer |date=November 2, 2012 }}\"</ref>\n\n===Fighting for the world title===\n\nEmbarking on a succession of impressive wins, Lewis improved his record to 40-3. In December 1971, Lewis took on Cuban fighter [[Jose Napoles]] for the WBC and WBA World Welterweight titles. The bout was tightly contested, with Lewis pushing the world champion for the full 15 rounds. The decision went to Napoles, but all 3 judges scorecards registered a very close fight. Still at a relatively young age of 25, Lewis returned to winning ways, racking up 11 straight wins on the bounce. This included a doubleheader against former world champion [[Billy Backus]].\n\nLewis traveled to Syracuse, New York, the home town of Backus, for the first bout in June 1972. In what turned out to be one of the fights of the year, Lewis dropped his rival in round 4 on his way to a decision victory. In the rematch, later on, that year, Lewis would once again claim victory.<ref>Harry Mullan, \"Great Book of Boxing\"</ref> In defeating Backus, Lewis picked up the New York version of the World Welterweight title. He also gained the admiration of the New York boxing scene. Continuing on with varying degrees of success, Lewis would fight twice more for the world title, including a rematch against Jose Napoles, without success.<ref>Peter Arnold, \"The illustrated encyclopedia of world boxing\"</ref> Hedgemon Lewis retired in 1976 at the age of 30. His final career record read 53-7-2. Lewis was inducted into the California Boxing Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\n==Post professional boxing career==\n\nNot yet finished with the sport, Lewis became a noted coach and cornerman in the world of boxing. He worked the corners with legendary figures such as Eddie Futch, Thell Torrence and [[Freddie Roach (boxing)|Freddy Roach]]. He would play a key role as part of Futch\u2019s camp in the epic \u2018Thriller in Manila\u2019 fight. Lewis trained fighters until his death. Outside of boxing, he also achieved success in the Los Angeles real estate market.<ref>Harry Mullan, \"Great Book of Boxing\"</ref> He died on March 31, 2020 at the age of 74.<ref>[https://fightnews.com/hedgemon-lewis-passes-away/72262]</ref>\n\n==Professional boxing record==\n{{S-start}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"|'''53 Wins''' (26 knockouts, 27 decisions), ''' 7 Losses''' (4 knockouts, 3 decisions), '''2 Draws'''<ref>{{cite web | url =http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=012562&cat=boxer | title =Hedgemon Lewis professional boxing record | publisher =BoxRec.com | access-date =February 2, 2011 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20121102035952/http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=012562&cat=boxer | archive-date =November 2, 2012 | url-status =dead }}</ref>\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#e3e3e3;\"\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Res.'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Record'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Opponent'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Type'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Rd., Time'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Date'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Location'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Notes'''\n|- align=center\n|{{no2}}Loss\n|align=center|53-7-2||align=left|{{flagicon|England}} [[John H.
