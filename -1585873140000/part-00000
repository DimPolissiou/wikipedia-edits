It stars [[Robert De Niro]], [[Nick Nolte]], [[Jessica Lange]], [[Joe Don Baker]], [[Juliette Lewis]], [[Robert Mitchum]], and [[Gregory Peck]] in his final theatrical film role. In addition to Mitchum and Peck, [[Martin Balsam]] cameos in the remake; all three starred in the original film. The film tells the story of a convicted rapist, who, mostly by using his newfound knowledge of the law and its numerous loopholes, seeks vengeance against a former [[public defender]], whom he blames for his 14-year imprisonment because of the purposefully faulty defense tactics used during his trial.\n\n''Cape Fear'' marks the [[Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro|seventh collaboration between Scorsese and De Niro]]. The film received positive reviews and was a commercial success. It received [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations for Best Actor (De Niro) and Best Supporting Actress ([[Juliette Lewis]]).\n\n==Plot==\n\nSam Bowden ([[Nick Nolte]]) is a lawyer living in North Carolina with his wife Leigh ([[Jessica Lange]]) and teenage daughter Danielle ([[Juliette Lewis]]). [[Max Cady]] ([[Robert De Niro]]), a former client whom Sam failed to defend, is released from prison after 14 years; Cady was tried for rape and battery of a young woman and, appalled by the attack, Sam buried evidence that might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal. \n\nCady, who has studied law in prison but unsuccessfully appealed his conviction several times, tracks Sam down and begins to terrorise the Bowden family; he lurks near the property and the family dog is mysteriously killed. Sam attempts to have Cady arrested but the police say there is no evidence of a crime. At a bar, Cady intentionally meets Sam's work colleague Lori. He later violently attacks and rapes her but she refuses to press charges, ashamed of what happened. Sam hires a private investigator, Kerserk, to follow Cady.\n\nCady approaches Danielle at school by impersonating her new drama teacher, and they kiss. Sam warns Cady to leave him and his family alone or suffer the consequences, a conversation that Cady secretly tapes with a hidden recorder. Sam also hire three men to beat Cady; as Sam watches from afar, Cady turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them instead. Cady then uses the recording of Sam's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Sam.\n\nKersek assumes that Cady may try to enter the Bowden house while he believes Sam is out of town; the family fake his departure and hide in the house, hoping that Cady will break in so that he can be shot in self-defense. Cady kills the Bowden's housekeeper Graciela and impersonates her to ambush and kill Kersek. Horrified after discovering the bodies, Sam, Leigh, and Danielle flee to their houseboat docked upstate along [[Cape Fear (headland)|Cape Fear]] river. \n\nCady, who has followed the family, attacks Sam and prepares to rape Leigh and Danielle while making Sam watch. Danielle sprays Cady with lighter fluid as he lights a cigar, engulfing him in flames and causing him to jump off the boat. However, Cady clings to a rope and pulls himself back on board. As the boat is rocked by a violent thunderstorm, a badly burned and deranged Cady confronts Sam, putting him on a [[mock trial]] to condemn him for withholding the specific evidence that would have given him a lighter sentence in jail. Despite Sam's insistence that his crime was too heinous for that evidence to be taken into account, Cady berates him for failing to properly do his duty as a lawyer. \n\nThe storm eventually knocks Cady off of his feet, allowing Sam to gain the upper hand once the women jump off the boat and make it to shore. Sam then uses Cady's handcuffs to shackle Cady to the boat. When the boat hits a rock and is destroyed, the fight continues on shore, but a raging tide carries Cady away and he drowns. Sam washes the blood from his hands before he rejoins Leigh and Danielle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Robert De Niro]] as [[Max Cady]]\n*[[Nick Nolte]] as Sam Bowden\n*[[Jessica Lange]] as Leigh Bowden\n*[[Juliette Lewis]] as Danielle Bowden\n*[[Joe Don Baker]] as Claude Kersek\n*[[Robert Mitchum]] as Lt.

Spielberg stayed on as a producer, through his [[Amblin Entertainment]], but chose not to be credited personally on the finished film.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CEED9113FF933A25752C1A967958260 | work=The New York Times | first=Janet | last=Maslin | title=FILM; Martin Scorsese Ventures Back To 'Cape Fear' | date=1991-11-10}}</ref>\n\nDespite having worked with Nolte in ''[[New York Stories]]'' (1989), Scorsese did not have him in mind to portray Sam Bowden and wanted [[Harrison Ford]] to play the part instead. Ford, however, agreed to do the film only if he was going to portray Max Cady. Nolte, who was interested in portraying Bowden, managed to convince Scorsese to cast him for the part. In addition, [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]] both auditioned for the part of Danielle Bowden and Spielberg reportedly wanted [[Bill Murray]] to portray Cady.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Cormier|first=Roger|title=15 Intense Facts About ''Cape Fear''|date=November 16, 2016|magazine=[[Mental Floss]]|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/88173/15-intense-facts-about-cape-fear|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nNick Nolte is taller than Robert De Niro, but for the movie, Nolte lost weight and De Niro developed muscles until De Niro appeared to be the stronger man.

As with [[Cape Fear (1962 film)|the 1962 film version]], where director [[J. Lee Thompson]] specifically acknowledged Hitchcock's influence, strove to use Hitchcock's style, and had [[Bernard Hermann]] write the score, Scorsese made his version in the Hitchcock manner, especially through the use of unusual camera angles, lighting, and editing techniques. Additionally, Scorsese's version has opening credits designed by regular Hitchcock collaborator [[Saul Bass]], and the link to Hitchcock is cemented by the reuse of the original score by Herrmann, albeit reworked by [[Elmer Bernstein]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/cape-fear-film-score-mc0002394599|title=Cape Fear, film score|work=AllMusic}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film was a box office success, making $182,291,969 worldwide<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=capefear.htm | title=Cape Fear (1991) - Box Office Mojo | website=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=2010-01-24}}</ref> on a $35 million budget.\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received generally positive reviews by critics, with praise garnered towards its performances, direction, cinematography and editing.

A close up, sharing the same scary score of the movie, Uncle Leo is seen with \u201cJerry\u201d & \u201cHello\u201d tattooed on each hand.

After a short conversation, he plays [[Aretha Franklin]]'s single \"[[Do Right Woman, Do Right Man]].\"\n\nAlone with Danielle in the school's theater, Cady alludes to [[Henry Miller]]'s trilogy ''[[The Rosy Crucifixion]]'', which contains the books ''Plexus,'' ''Nexus,'' and ''Sexus.'' Danielle says she read parts of ''[[Tropic of Cancer]].''\n\nCady tells Sam he will teach him \"the meaning of commitment.\" He tells Sam to \"check out the [[Bible]], counselor. Look between [[Book of Esther|Esther]] and [[Psalms]].\" After staging his departure at the airport, Sam returns home covertly with Leigh and Danielle, and later discovers Cady was referring to the [[Book of Job]].\n\nCady quotes a translation of the 17th century priest, physician, mystic, and poet, [[Angelus Silesius]], saying: {{cquote|\n\n:I am like God, and God like me.\n:I am as Large as God, He is as small as I.\n:He cannot above me, nor I beneath him, be.\n|}}\n\nCady alludes to [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', saying he is [[Virgil]] guiding Sam through the Ninth Circle of Hell, the last and lowest circle, reserved for traitors.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films featuring home invasions]]\n* [[List of 1991 box office number-one films in the United States]]\n* [[Night and the City (1992 film)|''Night and the City'']], another remake also starring De Niro and Lange\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=E9snGGV1X5MC&printsec=frontcover&source=in Machura, Stefan and Robson, Peter, eds.

Spielberg stayed on as a producer, through his [[Amblin Entertainment]], but chose not to be credited personally on the finished film.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CEED9113FF933A25752C1A967958260 | work=The New York Times | first=Janet | last=Maslin | title=FILM; Martin Scorsese Ventures Back To 'Cape Fear' | date=1991-11-10}}</ref>\n\nDespite having worked with Nolte in ''[[New York Stories]]'' (1989), Scorsese did not have him in mind to portray Sam Bowden and wanted [[Harrison Ford]] to play the part instead. Ford, however, agreed to do the film only if he was going to portray Max Cady. Nolte, who was interested in portraying Bowden, managed to convince Scorsese to cast him for the part. In addition, [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]] both auditioned for the part of Danielle Bowden and Spielberg reportedly wanted [[Bill Murray]] to portray Cady.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Cormier|first=Roger|title=15 Intense Facts About ''Cape Fear''|date=November 16, 2016|magazine=[[Mental Floss]]|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/88173/15-intense-facts-about-cape-fear|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nNick Nolte is taller than Robert De Niro, but for the movie, Nolte lost weight and De Niro developed muscles until De Niro appeared to be the stronger man.

As with [[Cape Fear (1962 film)|the 1962 film version]], where director [[J. Lee Thompson]] specifically acknowledged Hitchcock's influence, strove to use Hitchcock's style, and had [[Bernard Hermann]] write the score, Scorsese made his version in the Hitchcock manner, especially through the use of unusual camera angles, lighting, and editing techniques. Additionally, Scorsese's version has opening credits designed by regular Hitchcock collaborator [[Saul Bass]], and the link to Hitchcock is cemented by the reuse of the original score by Herrmann, albeit reworked by [[Elmer Bernstein]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/cape-fear-film-score-mc0002394599|title=Cape Fear, film score|work=AllMusic}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film was a box office success, making $182,291,969 worldwide<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=capefear.htm | title=Cape Fear (1991) - Box Office Mojo | website=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=2010-01-24}}</ref> on a $35 million budget.\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received generally positive reviews by critics, with praise garnered towards its performances, direction, cinematography and editing. It received a 73% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on the film aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 49 reviews, with an average score of 7.06/10. The consensus reads, \"Smart and stylish, ''Cape Fear'' is a gleefully mainstream shocker from Martin Scorsese, with a terrifying Robert De Niro performance.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1037581-cape_fear/ |title=''Cape Fear'' at RottenTomatoes.com |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=2011-11-01}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a score of 73 out of 100 based on 9 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cape-fear |title=Cape Fear Reviews |website=Metacritic |accessdate=2016-06-11}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three stars, commenting: \"''Cape Fear'' is impressive moviemaking, showing Scorsese as a master of a traditional Hollywood genre who is able to mold it to his own themes and obsessions.

However, he only lasted a few months with the company as Spivey was forced into retirement due to a buildup of previous injuries, and the character was abandoned. In 2013, WWE debuted [[Bray Wyatt]], another character partly based on not just De Niro's portrayal, but also Waylon Mercy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Critics, not fans, should bite their tongues|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/MatMatters/2013/07/15/pf-20975591.html|publisher=Slam!

A close up, sharing the same scary score of the movie, Uncle Leo is seen with \u201cJerry\u201d & \u201cHello\u201d tattooed on each hand.

After a short conversation, he plays [[Aretha Franklin]]'s single \"[[Do Right Woman, Do Right Man]].\"\n\nAlone with Danielle in the school's theater, Cady alludes to [[Henry Miller]]'s trilogy ''[[The Rosy Crucifixion]]'', which contains the books ''Plexus,'' ''Nexus,'' and ''Sexus.'' Danielle says she read parts of ''[[Tropic of Cancer]].''\n\nCady tells Sam he will teach him \"the meaning of commitment.\" He tells Sam to \"check out the [[Bible]], counselor. Look between [[Book of Esther|Esther]] and [[Psalms]].\" After staging his departure at the airport, Sam returns home covertly with Leigh and Danielle, and later discovers Cady was referring to the [[Book of Job]].\n\nCady quotes a translation of the 17th century priest, physician, mystic, and poet, [[Angelus Silesius]], saying: {{cquote|\n\n:I am like God, and God like me.\n:I am as Large as God, He is as small as I.\n:He cannot above me, nor I beneath him, be.\n|}}\n\nCady alludes to [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', saying he is [[Virgil]] guiding Sam through the Ninth Circle of Hell, the last and lowest circle, reserved for traitors.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films featuring home invasions]]\n* [[List of 1991 box office number-one films in the United States]]\n* [[Night and the City (1992 film)|''Night and the City'']], another remake also starring De Niro and Lange\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=E9snGGV1X5MC&printsec=frontcover&source=in Machura, Stefan and Robson, Peter, eds.
