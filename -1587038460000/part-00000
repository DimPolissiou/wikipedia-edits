It is located in the [[Vale of White Horse]] near the [[River Thames]], across the road from the twelfth-century [[Norman architecture|Norman]] Hall and the [[Manor House (Sutton Courtenay)|Manor House]]. The Abbey has been recognised by the [[Historic buildings council|Historic Building Council for England]] (now [[Historic England]]) as a building of outstanding historic and [[architecture|architectural]] interest.<ref name=abbeyarchives>The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay archives.</ref> It is considered to be a \u2018textbook\u2019 example of the English medieval [[manor house]]{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} and has been a [[listed building#Grade I|Grade I-listed]] building since 1952.<ref name=listed />\n\nThe Abbey has its origins in the thirteenth century as a [[clergy house|rectory]] of [[Abingdon Abbey]], a [[Benedictines|Benedictine]] [[monastery]] up north in [[Abingdon-on-Thames]]. Several construction phases took place during the Middle Ages, carried out by prominent figures like [[Solomon of Rochester]], [[Thomas Beckington]] and [[William Say (priest)|William Say]], but it wasn't until the seventeenth century that the current plan was completed.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}} It was probably during the [[Victorian era]] that the house acquired the name 'The Abbey'.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> From 1495 to 1867, The Abbey was in possession of [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]] at [[Windsor Castle]], who leased the estate among others to [[John Fettiplace (politician died 1580)|John Fettiplace]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}}\n\nAfter being inhabited by [[Evelyn St. Croix Fleming]], the estate was bought by [[David Astor]] in 1958, who leased it to the [[Ockenden International|Ockenden Venture]] which offered sanctuary to refugees and displaced children. In the 70s, The Abbey was lent to the exiled Bishop [[Colin Winter]] to house the [[Namibia International Peace Centre]]. In 1978, the [[Astor family]] sold the house and in 1980 it came into possession of The New Era Centre, a [[foundation (nonprofit)|non-profit charity]] led by Dr. [[Fred Blum]] and Bishop [[Stephen Verney]].<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The New Era Centre used The Abbey as a [[retreat (spiritual)|spiritual retreat]] and conference centre, and changed its name to '''The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay''' in the 1990s.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> \n\nThe Abbey, Sutton Courtenay is a residential centre in which a [[spiritualism|spiritual]] community offers hospitality to people seeking [[personal development|personal growth]], spiritual refreshment and [[healing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=278687&subid=0|title=The Abbey Sutton Courtenay Limited|website=[[Charity Commission for England and Wales]]|access-date=20 March 2020}}</ref> The Abbey also runs a programme of events for the public in the areas of spirituality, personal development, education, music and the arts.<ref name=abingdon />\n\n== Buildings ==\n[[File:Plan_of_The_Abbey,_Sutton_Courtenay.png|thumb|A plan of the main building (ground floor).]]\nThe Abbey forms a [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] with an inner [[courtyard]]. It has 28 rooms and a [[great hall]].<ref name=abbeyarchives /> The building has two storeys and is constructed from stone and timber with clay roof tiles. Originally, the roof would have been thatched. Four ranges are arranged around the central courtyard. The oldest part of The Abbey was originally built in timber frame and consisted of the north and west ranges, parts of which were later encased in stone to stabilise the structure.\n\nNowadays, there is also a guest house which is used for customers, conference guests and visitors. It is adjacent to the main house and it has its own kitchen with a dining area. The guest house has nine rooms in total, five twins and four single rooms.<ref name=abbeystaying>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/staying-at-the-abbey/|title=Staying at The Abbey|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref>\n\nThe main entrance to The Abbey was through the rear door of a cross passage which served to separate the great hall from the service wing. Nowadays, the main entrance is on the east side with a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] arch, a 1980s insertion replacing a narrow door, leading to the courtyard.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}}\n\nNineteenth-century accounts of the site show many inaccuracies.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} [[Edward Blore]] made sketches of the interior of the hall and of the house as seen from the northwest, which served as the basis of the engravings published by [[John Henry Parker]] in 1853.{{sfn|Parker|1853|p=272}} Parker also published a plan, but this was inaccurate in detail.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} [[Peter Spencer Spokes]] and John M.

The wing is largely timber-framed. On the ground floor at the southwest end, the wing seems to incorporate a stone wall of an earlier structure, in which lateral chimney stacks have been built with fire places dating from the nineteenth century. The plastered stone wall on the south side, which is of timber above the first floor, is an underbuilding for an [[overhang (architecture)|overhang]]. The north wall consists of large [[ashlar]] blocks suggesting that that was done between the fifteenth and seventeenth century and it had a three-light [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]] window. Its timber-framed north wall is also the south wall of the great hall. The [[dormer]] roof between the truss of the great hall and the service wing is done in a thirteenth-century technique. The roof of the service wing itself, however, is post-medieval.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=228}} Today, the service wing houses the [[solitary confinement|meditation room]] and accommodation.<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\nThe great hall was originally timber-framed and integrated with the contemporary service wing. It was cased in stone between 1320 and 1340 to prevent deforming of the base crucks under [[shear stress]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=232}} The hall has two equal [[bay (architecture)|bays]] and the four two-light windows have been replaced in the twentieth century by three-light Perpendicular windows. The stonework of the northern doorway was largely renewed in the nineteenth century. It has wave-moulded [[jamb]]s, [[voussoir]]s and an [[ogee]]-scroll [[hood mould]]. The original southern doorway was less important and similar in style, but with [[chamfer]]ed jambs. The east wall abuts the north range with a straight joint, while the joint of the north range with the west wall is obscured by plaster. The doorway in the east wall has been rebuilt in brick.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=228}} The west wall of the hall is [[battlement|castellated]] and probably early nineteenth century.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The great hall survives open to the roof, with one cruck truss carrying a [[king post]] which is unique in that it was never hidden by a ceiling.<ref name=abbeyhistory>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/history/|title=The Abbey - 800 Years of History|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref> The workmanship of the timber structure is of exceptional quality. The main timbers are made from very large trees carefully sawn to avoid waney edges.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=231}} All four posts have been made from the same tree. The structure has nineteenth- and twentieth-century renovations.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=232}} It has a wooden floor and can accommodate up to sixty people seated.<ref name=abbeystaying />\n\n=== North range ===\n[[File:Library, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay 01.jpg|thumb|The library.]]\nIn the courtyard between the north and west range is a timber-framed staircase outshut, dating from before the stone casing of the early fourteenth century. The stair is modern and leads to a door on the first floor of the north range. The outshut roof was probably repaired in the seventeenth century with an inserted [[purlin]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=233}}\n\nThe northern range is roofed in six bays. The western three bays were originally also built in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, while the eastern three bays of the northern range have timber work in the roof that indicates a fifteenth-century date.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=233}}\n\nThe finish of the timbers of the three western bays in the north range is of inferior quality to that of the hall. On the ground floor was a [[parlour]] now used as a dining room, located under the two most western bays. The walls of this parlour vary in size. The west wall contains a three-light Perpendicular window, the north wall contains three two-light ones. The present fireplace is modern but there must have been a chimney since the fifteenth century.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=234}} East of the parlour, the floor level rises and there is a [[cross passage]]. The door at the north end of the passage became blocked and was reopened only in the 1980s. East to the passage, under the third bay from the west, is a lodged floor. Originally, the bay was divided in a room to the north and a narrow room or corridor to the south.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=235}} The first floor was intended as a [[great chamber]], the second most important room in a medieval English manor house. This chamber was entered through a door from the staircase outshut. It is dominated by two fourteenth-century two-light [[transom (architecture)|transom]] windows in the west [[gable]] and in the north wall. The reveals of a third window also remain in the north wall.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The present fireplace has [[musician]] [[corbel]]s from the fifteenth century.{{sfn |Wood |1965 |p=XVIIE (plate)}} It had the same open roof structure as the great hall until probably the seventeenth century, when the space was divided into two rooms, with a corridor on the south side of the eastern room. These rooms now serve as the library and dining room respectively.<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\n[[File:Solar, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The [[solar (room)|solar]].]]\nOn the ground floor of the three eastern bays, the third bay from the east was probably open to the roof and is nowadays part of the same room with the third bay from the west (the room east of the parlour). It has a small [[lancet window]] in the northern wall at the base of the chimney. The two eastern most bays formed one room and has a modern partition from a corridor to the south. The north and east walls are both from stone, and at the east end of the northern wall is a blocked window. The other two windows are modern. An overhang projected northwards to the room. The present timber south wall replaced a stone wall, remains of which were found during [[plumbing]] operations in 1987-8.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=236}} On the first floor there was a [[solar (room)|solar]] in the second and third bay from the east which was to the south divided from the dining room by a timber-framed partition. On the north side, there are two nineteenth- or twentieth-century Gothic windows flanking a large chimney with a fireplace. There may have been a partition in the middle of the room before the fireplace was built. The solar has a partition to the east behind which was a [[chapel]] and a door from the north to the east range.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=235}}\n\n=== East range ===\n[[File:Arch, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|East entrance looking into the courtyard.]]\nThe east range, which today holds the entrance archway, was constructed around 1500 and contains three bays. The modern gatehouse, at the northern end of the east range, has a lancet window in its east wall. It has a jettied timber frame upper on existing stone walls.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> \n\nSouth of the archway, the wall was timber framed but later partially infilled with brick and rubble as far as the chimney, where it abuts the south range. This timber framed wall is on a different alignment than the gatehouse, probably to unite with the south wall of the southeastern block, which may have been a wall around the building rather than part of a building.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}}\n\nThe roof of the southern bay of the east range was black-smokened and may have served as a kitchen or [[brewhouse]] at some time into which a chimney was later inserted.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}}\n\n=== South range ===\n[[File:Hearth, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The Hearth, a meeting room in the south range.]]\nThe adjoining southeast corner block appears to have been roofed, probably in the seventeenth century, to connect the east range with the south range, completing the plan to create a courtyard.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}} \n\nThe south range, extending the service wing, was added during the mid-sixteenth century. The two storey structure consisting of three bays was open to the eaves and once served as a kitchen.<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\nNowadays, the southeast corner block contains a meeting room called 'The Hearth', seating up to eighteen people.<ref name=abbeystaying /> The south range is now used as The Abbey\u2019s administration office.\n\n== Grounds ==\n[[File:Avenue1, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The lime tree avenue.]]\n[[File:Courtyard2, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The courtyard garden.]]\nIn 1804, Francis Justice, who was in possession of the estate at the time, was allotted over two acres on the green north of the house.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=224}} As a result of this enlargement of the [[curtilage]], The Abbey now stands in the midst of extensive grounds and is approached by an [[avenue (landscape)|avenue]] of [[Tilia|lime trees]] across the enclosure allotment, leading near to the east of the house. Although the avenue across the grounds appears to have existed before the enclosure (some trees are older than 1804) the house stood on the eastern edge of its curtilage until 1798. The old boundary wall survives, only circa two meters beyond the east wall of the house.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} Nowadays, The Abbey consists of six acres of grounds which are of [[archaeology|archaeological]] importance because the remains of ancillary buildings underlie the gardens.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> The [[perimeter]] is marked by old stone walls, dead hedging and wooden fencing.\n\nSome four and a half acres of the land are used as gardens. On the north lawn, there is a [[Platanus|plane tree]] surrounded by [[Narcissus (plant)|daffodils]]. Here grow [[Rhododendron|rhododendrons]], [[Acer campestre|field maple]] (with a gnarled [[bark (botany)|bark]]), [[bramble]], [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[beech]], [[Acer pseudoplatanus|sycamore]], [[oak]], [[Hedera|ivy]] and various [[Pinophyta|conifers]]. There are also [[Lauraceae|laurels]], winter-flowering ''[[Viburnum]]'', [[Symphoricarpos|snowberry]], a young [[Prunus serrulata|Japanese cherry]] and [[maple]]. A trunk and several branches from an old [[Fagus sylvatica#Cultivation|copper beech]] serve as a place for [[fungus|fungi]] and [[lichen]]s to grow on. Under the trees, there is a purpose built woodstore. On the west lawn, there is a [[Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia|London planetree]]. The south lawn has a [[labyrinth]] in it, where the [[maypole]] is erected. This lawn as young [[Sequoioideae|redwood]] and several varieties of [[apple]] and [[plum]] trees. Furthermore, The Abbey has mature [[live oak]], [[Taxus baccata|yew]], [[Prunus avium|wild cherry]], [[Prunus subg. Padus|bird cherry]], [[Morus (plant)|mulberry]] and a [[Cedrus libani|cedar of Lebanon]]. In 1991, a project was completed which took care for the trees and [[transplanting|transplanted]] various species around the grounds. There is also a small secluded [[orchard]] adjacent to the grounds, where honey is produced from The Abbey's own [[mason bee|mason]] and [[honey bee]]s. The guest house area contains ivy, yew, apple, [[Euonymus|spindle]], [[Sambucus|elder]] and [[Viburnum lantana|wayfarer]] together with many [[Rosa setigera|climbing roses]], [[Salvia officinalis|sage]] and [[fern]]s.<ref name=abbeygrounds>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/grounds/|title=The Abbey Grounds|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=19 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref>\n\nThe courtyard garden has a [[Ficus|fig tree]], ''[[Magnolia]]'', [[rose]]s and a medieval style flower bed surrounded by a mature ''[[Buxus]]'' hedging. This garden was restored during the 1990s with [[gravel]]led paths and redesigned by B. Vellacot, a local volunteer. Around the main building there are flower beds with plants such as ''[[Fuchsia]]'', [[Lavandula|lavender]], [[Vinca|periwinkle]], [[Brunnera macrophylla|Siberian bugloss]], sage, [[Helichrysum italicum|curry plants]], [[catnip]], [[rosemary]], [[Jasminum nudiflorum|winter jasmine]] and [[Spiraea|spirea]].

In the eleventh century, [[William the Conquerer]] granted the estate of Sutton to the [[House of Courtenay]], and the village became Sutton Courtenay.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> In 1090, King [[William II of England]] granted the [[All Saints' Church, Sutton Courtenay|church of Sutton]] and its lands and [[tithe]]s to the monks of Abingdon Abbey.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}}\n\nAbingdon Abbey constructed The Abbey as a [[monastic grange]], used as an administrative centre for the abbey's land and tithe holdings.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> However, the owner of the hide of land, Alwi the priest (whose father owned the land before him according to the [[Domesday Book]]), agreed with the [[abbot]] that he should retain Sutton with reversion first to his son and thereafter to the abbey, on condition of giving in [[Milton, Vale of White Horse|Milton]] chapelry immediately.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=28}} Almost certainly in the late twelfth century, Abingdon Abbey took two thirds of the tithes and the [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] the remaining third.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=104-5}} In 1258, following a dispute, the land was formally appropriated to the abbey and a [[clergy house|vicarage]] was ordained.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=106}} As it was close to Abingdon Abbey, it was probably run by the monks themselves rather than being left to a steward.<ref name=berkshirehistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/castles/scourtenay_abbey.html|title=The Abbey at Sutton Courtenay|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2004|work=Royal Berkshire History|author=David Nash Ford}}</ref> In 1278, however, [[Hugh de Courtenay]], Lord of the [[Manor House (Sutton Courtenay)|Manor of Sutton]], sued the abbey for [[advowson]].

Many of these men rarely visited Sutton, leaving the running of The Abbey to various underlings. William Steele, rector in 1371, left money to each of his four servants in Sutton. Robert of Walsham, rector from 1372 to 1384 and Dean of [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], may have resided intermittently. His successor John Yernemouth was rector from 1384 to 1397 and did not reside but hired a chaplain to perform his duties. John Yernemouth was the [[chaplain]] of Prince [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England]]. He left the rectory to William Brouns, father of Bishop [[Thomas Brunce|Thomas Brouns]], and two others sometime before 1394. By then, the building had become ruinous and badly roofed. Walter Medford, later [[Archdeacon of Berkshire]], was rector from 1397 to 1413 and may well have used the house. His successor, Nicholas Colnet, also may have resided at the rectory. Colnet was the doctor of King [[Henry V of England]] and was rector until 1420. He left money to the church and poor of Sutton.<ref>[[Berkshire Record Office]], D/EP 7/123.</ref> [[Thomas Beckington]], rector since 1420 and secretary of King [[Henry VI of England]], stayed at Sutton twice in 1442 and perhaps on other occasions.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=224}} The ceiling of the solar is attributed to Beckington.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> In 1442, he was accompanied by [[William Say (priest)|William Say]], who succeeded him as rector when Beckington became [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]] in 1443.{{sfn |Fletcher |1990 |p=60-2}} In 1444, Say obtained license to celebrate divine office in the house.

In 1984, after The Abbey was improved to a habitable state, the first two resident community members moved in. Stephen Verney extensively discussed, and believed in, the role Buddhist practice and philosophy could play in increasing connectivity with a Christian deity, and it was this belief which led many of The New Era Centre\u2019s early pursuits.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> Blum spent decades researching, interviewing and publishing on [[Mahatma Gandhi]]\u2019s life works and legacy. So too did The Abbey welcome [[India]]n thinkers, such as the social activist and spiritual leader [[Vimala Thakar]] who, in the 1980s, led a seminar here. Among the earliest events taking place at The Abbey was the annual [[Gandhi Foundation]] Summer School that continued to be held there.

Upon the purchase of The Abbey by The New Era Centre in 1980, a monumental effort was required to source volunteer labour, both locally and from abroad. Sourcing funding was difficult, and some potential investors remained unconvinced that the founders high ideals could lead to anything other than a misuse of funds. However, Blum and Verney remained committed to their project, disputing each critical point. Much of the work was carried out in a co-operative form, such as the 'work camp' of 1981, a community of enthusiastic volunteers. Volunteers from organisations such as [[WWOOF]] UK and [[HelpX]] still play a vital role in keeping The Abbey alive.

The north and east walls are both from stone, and at the east end of the northern wall is a blocked window. The other two windows are modern. An overhang projected northwards to the room. The present timber south wall replaced a stone wall, remains of which were found during [[plumbing]] operations in 1987-8.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=236}} On the first floor there was a [[solar (room)|solar]] in the second and third bay from the east which was to the south divided from the dining room by a timber-framed partition. On the north side, there are two nineteenth- or twentieth-century Gothic windows flanking a large chimney with a fireplace.

In the eleventh century, [[William the Conquerer]] granted the estate of Sutton to the [[House of Courtenay]], and the village became Sutton Courtenay.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> In 1090, King [[William II of England]] granted the [[All Saints' Church, Sutton Courtenay|church of Sutton]] and its lands and [[tithe]]s to the monks of Abingdon Abbey.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}}\n\nAbingdon Abbey constructed The Abbey as a [[monastic grange]], used as an administrative centre for the abbey's land and tithe holdings.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> However, the owner of the hide of land, Alwi the priest (whose father owned the land before him according to the [[Domesday Book]]), agreed with the [[abbot]] that he should retain Sutton with reversion first to his son and thereafter to the abbey, on condition of giving in [[Milton, Vale of White Horse|Milton]] chapelry immediately.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=28}} Almost certainly in the late twelfth century, Abingdon Abbey took two thirds of the tithes and the [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] the remaining third.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=104-5}} In 1258, following a dispute, the land was formally appropriated to the abbey and a [[clergy house|vicarage]] was ordained.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=106}} As it was close to Abingdon Abbey, it was probably run by the monks themselves rather than being left to a steward.<ref name=berkshirehistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/castles/scourtenay_abbey.html|title=The Abbey at Sutton Courtenay|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2004|work=Royal Berkshire History|author=David Nash Ford}}</ref> In 1278, however, [[Hugh de Courtenay]], Lord of the [[Manor House (Sutton Courtenay)|Manor of Sutton]], sued the abbey for [[advowson]].

Many of these men rarely visited Sutton, leaving the running of The Abbey to various underlings. William Steele, rector in 1371, left money to each of his four servants in Sutton. Robert of Walsham, rector from 1372 to 1384 and Dean of [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], may have resided intermittently. His successor John Yernemouth was rector from 1384 to 1397 and did not reside but hired a chaplain to perform his duties. John Yernemouth was the [[chaplain]] of Prince [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England]]. He left the rectory to William Brouns, father of Bishop [[Thomas Brunce|Thomas Brouns]], and two others sometime before 1394. By then, the building had become ruinous and badly roofed. Walter Medford, later [[Archdeacon of Berkshire]], was rector from 1397 to 1413 and may well have used the house. His successor, Nicholas Colnet, also may have resided at the rectory. Colnet was the doctor of King [[Henry V of England]] and was rector until 1420.

After months of torrential rain that hindered work, the house was sold in 1980 to The New Era Centre, a [[foundation (nonprofit)|non-profit charity]] established by Dr [[Fred Blum]] in 1967. During his lifetime, Blum became a member of the [[Quakers]], whilst maintaining his Jewish heritage. In 1963, Blum resigned from his academic posts in the [[United States]] and pursued a future based in the United Kingdom.{{sfn |Mehta |2011 |p=56}} In 1969, he met Bishop [[Stephen Verney]] at a conference in [[Coventry]] where Verney was doing [[reconciliation (theology)|reconciliation]] work. They became friends, \u201clike brothers\u201d, and Verney became a [[trustee]] and significant supporter and contributor to the creation and work of The New Era Centre at The Abbey, which became a [[charitable organization|registered charity]] on 20 December 1979. Verney was a well-connected individual, and frequently communicated with the politician [[Roy Jenkins]].<ref name=abbeyarchives /> The residential community of The New Era Centre in The Abbey was dedicated on 4 October 1981 as a space to explore and work towards the synthesis of [[Christianity]] and more contemporary understandings of societal transformation. In 1984, after The Abbey was improved to a habitable state, the first two resident community members moved in. Stephen Verney extensively discussed, and believed in, the role Buddhist practice and philosophy could play in increasing connectivity with a Christian deity, and it was this belief which led many of The New Era Centre\u2019s early pursuits.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> Blum spent decades researching, interviewing and publishing on [[Mahatma Gandhi]]\u2019s life works and legacy. So too did The Abbey welcome [[India]]n thinkers, such as the social activist and spiritual leader [[Vimala Thakar]] who, in the 1980s, led a seminar here. Among the earliest events taking place at The Abbey was the annual [[Gandhi Foundation]] Summer School that continued to be held there. Much of Blum's work can now be found in The Abbey's library. {{sfn |Mehta |2011 |p=58}}\n\n[[File:The Abbey ruinous state.jpg |thumb|The Abbey in a ruinous state, around 1979.]]\nTwentieth-century landowners had to contend with various states of disrepair, and few have had either the capital or the will to sustain the business. Upon the purchase of The Abbey by The New Era Centre in 1980, a monumental effort was required to source volunteer labour, both locally and from abroad. Sourcing funding was difficult, and some potential investors remained unconvinced that the founders high ideals could lead to anything other than a misuse of funds. However, Blum and Verney remained committed to their project, disputing each critical point. Much of the work was carried out in a co-operative form, such as the 'work camp' of 1981, a community of enthusiastic volunteers. Volunteers from organisations such as [[WWOOF]] UK and [[HelpX]] still play a vital role in keeping The Abbey alive. Blum died in January 1990 and Verney continued the work at The Abbey, but retired in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/volunteering/|title=Volunteering|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|date=2020|access-date=20 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1991, the charity was re-named 'The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay'. Rooted in the Christian tradition yet open to other faiths, The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay is to this day home a small resident community and serves as a [[retreat (spiritual)|spiritual retreat]] and conference centre. Around 2006, communal worship moved from group prayers to group meditation and since 2007 concerts have been hosted here as well.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> In 2008, The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay launched its own website and in 2019 a history research project started as part of its 40th Anniversary Programme.\n\n== Gallery ==\n{{Gallery\n|title=\n|width=160 | height=170\n|align=center\n|footer=\n|File:The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay7.jpg\n |alt1=The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay\n |The courtyard.\n|File:Garden in snow, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg\n |alt2=The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay\n |The gardens in snow.\n|File:The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay20.jpg\n |alt3=The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay\n |The Abbey as seen from the south with the labyrinth in front.\n|File:The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay5.jpg\n |alt4=The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay\n |Gardens of The Abbey.\n|File:The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay4.jpg\n |alt5=The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay\n |Gardens of The Abbey.\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Grade I listed buildings in Vale of White Horse]]\n*[[List of country houses in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Medieval architecture]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n*{{cite journal |ref={{harvid|Currie|1992}} |last=Currie |first=Christopher Richard John |date=1992 |title=Larger Medieval Houses in the Vale of White Horse |url=http://www.oxoniensia.org/volumes/1992/currie.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2bLp5w_7pXDgXVExO6q3J5l2_lAwHH_yIHaVzQ8idMXmSi1oBi9TgVSRo |journal=[[Oxoniensia]] |volume=57 |issue= |pages=81-224 |doi= |access-date=16 March 2020}}\n*{{cite book|ref={{harvid|Dalton|1957}} |title=The manuscripts of St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle |last=Dalton |first=John Neale|author-link=John Neale Dalton|date=1957}}\n*{{cite journal |ref={{harvid|Elrington|1968}} |last=Elrington |first=Christopher Robin |author-link=Christopher Elrington |date=1968 |title=The borough of Tewkesbury: Manors and other estates |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/glos/vol8/pp131-137 |journal=A History of the County of Gloucester |volume=8 |issue= |pages=131-137 |doi= |access-date=17 March 2020 |location=London}}\n*{{cite book|ref={{harvid|Fletcher|1990}} |title=Sutton Courtenay: history of a Thames side village |last=Fletcher |first=John M. |date=1990}}\n*{{cite journal |ref={{harvid|Spokes |1964}} |last1=Fletcher |first1=John M. |last2=Spokes |first2=Peter Spencer |author-link2=Peter Spencer Spokes |date=1964 |title=The Origin and Development of Crown-Post Roofs |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/63444653/Origin-and-Development-of-Crown-Post-Roof-Fletcher-and-Spokes |journal=[[Medieval Archaeology (journal)|Medieval Archaeology]] |volume=8 |issue= |pages=152-183 |doi= |access-date=19 March 2020}}\n*{{cite book|ref={{harvid|Mehta|2011}} |title=Understanding Gandhi: Gandhians in Conversation with Fred J Blum |last1=Mehta |first1=Jayshree |last2=Thakkar |first2=Usha |author-link2=Usha Thakkar |doi=10.4135/9788132106838 |date=2011}}\n*{{cite book|ref={{harvid|Parker|1853}} |title=Some Account of Domestic Architecture in England, ii |last=Parker |first=John Henry|author-link=John Henry Parker|date=1853}}\n*{{Cite book|last1=Pevnser |first1=Sir Nikolaus |author-link1=Nikolaus Pevsner |title=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides|The buildings of England: Berkshire]] |place=[[New Haven, Connecticut]] |publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|page=236-7|year=1966|isbn=0-300-09582-1 }}\n*{{Cite book|last1=Pilling |first1=John C. |author-link1= |title=Oxfordshire houses |url= |place=[[Stroud]] |publisher=Search Sutton Publishing Ltd.|page=11-12|year=1993|isbn=0-750-90222-1 }}\n*{{cite journal |ref={{harvid|Preston |1919}} |last=Preston|first=A.E. |date=1919 |title=Sutton Courtenay and Abingdon Abbey |url=https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-787-1/dissemination/pdf/BAJ025_PDFs/BAJ025_A04_preston.pdf |journal=Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire Archaeological Journal |volume=XXV |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=17 March 2020}}\n*{{cite book|ref={{harvid|Wood|1965}} |title=English Medieval House|last=Wood |first=Margaret E.|date=1965|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay}}\n*[http://www.theabbey.uk.com/ The Abbey Community Retreat and Conference Centre] (official website).\n*[http://www.berkshirehistory.com/castles/scourtenay_abbey.html Royal Berkshire History: The 'Abbey' at Sutton Courtenay]\n*[https://www.exploringsurreyspast.org.uk/themes/subjects/refugees/ockenden_international_from_vision_to_venture/ Exploring Surrey's Past]\n*[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk Images of England: Statutory list description].
