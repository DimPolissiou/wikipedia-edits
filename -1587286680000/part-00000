Fifteen years after it disbanded, band leader Avraham Rosenblum revived the band under the name '''Avraham Rosenblum & Diaspora''' and produced several more albums.\n\n== Background ==\nThe '''Diaspora Yeshiva''' <ref>[https://diasporayeshiva.weebly.com/ Website of the Diaspora Yeshiva]</ref> was founded in 1967 by Rabbi Mordechai Goldstein, an alumnus of the [[Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim|Chofetz Chaim Yeshiva]] in [[Queens]], New York, and a colleague of Rabbi [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach]].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}}  It is the only Jewish institution located on [[Mount Zion]].

Students were encouraged to keep their long hair and their musical instruments.{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=331}}\n\nNumerous students were professional or semi-professional musicians, and several musical collaborations were spawned in the yeshiva dorms.<ref name=mish/> In 1975 student Avraham Rosenblum, a rock guitarist who had started his own band in New York in 1970, founded the Diaspora Yeshiva Band.<ref name=mish/>{{sfn|Strom|2011|p=196}} The band became an outreach tool for other hippie students and, later, post-hippie seekers, using [[Jewish music]] to draw them into the milieu of [[Torah study]].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=331}}<ref name=mish/>\n\n==History==\nThe Diaspora Yeshiva Band staged its first concert at the [[Gerard Behar Center|Beit Ha'Am]] hall in the [[Nachlaot]] neighborhood of Jerusalem during [[Hanukkah]] 1975.<ref name=mish/> After that, the band became well known for its weekly Saturday-night concerts held in a room adjacent to [[David's Tomb]] (located in the same courtyard as the yeshiva) on Mount Zion.<ref name=mish/>{{sfn|Selavan|1993|p=88}}{{sfn|Sofer|1995|p=92}} These concerts attracted American, British and French secular youth;

Fifteen years after it disbanded, band leader Avraham Rosenblum revived the band under the name '''Avraham Rosenblum & Diaspora''' and produced several more albums.\n\n== Background ==\nThe '''Diaspora Yeshiva''' <ref>[https://diasporayeshiva.weebly.com/ Website of the Diaspora Yeshiva]</ref> was founded in 1967 by Rabbi Mordechai Goldstein, an alumnus of the [[Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim|Chofetz Chaim Yeshiva]] in [[Queens]], New York, and a colleague of Rabbi [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach]].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}}  It is the only Jewish institution located on [[Mount Zion]].

It is scheduled to take place on May 10, 2020. It will be the eleventh event under the [[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] chronology.\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place at the [[Royal Farms Arena]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], but the venue canceled all shows that were to be held in May [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on sports|due to the]] [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]. WWE announced that the show's [[Money in the Bank ladder match|eponymous ladder matches]] would take place at its \"[[Titan Towers]]\" global headquarters building in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] with a new \"Corporate Ladder\" gimmick culminating on the facility's chatt. WWE has not yet announced where the card's remaining matches will originate.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Background ===\n[[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] (MITB) is an annual [[gimmick]] pay-per-view produced by WWE since 2010 and generally held between May and July. The concept of the show comes from WWE's established [[Money in the Bank ladder match]], in which multiple wrestlers use [[Ladder match|ladders]] to retrieve a briefcase hanging above the ring. The briefcase contains a contract that guarantees the winner a match for a world championship of their choosing at any time within the next year. Since the [[Money in the Bank (2018)|2018 event]], both the men's and women's matches featured eight wrestlers, evenly divided between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] [[WWE brand extension|brands]]. For 2020, it was reduced to six wrestlers divided between the brands. Male wrestlers compete for a contract to grant them a match for either Raw's [[WWE Championship]] or SmackDown's [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], while female wrestlers compete for a [[Raw Women's Championship]] or [[SmackDown Women's Championship]] match contract. 2020 will be the eleventh event in the Money in the Bank chronology.<ref name=\"2020event\"/>\n\n====Impact of the coronavirus pandemic====\nThe event was originally announced with [[Baltimore]]'s [[Royal Farms Arena]] as host.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lambert|first=Jeremy|title=WWE Money In The Bank 2020 Scheduled For May 10 In Baltimore, MD|url=https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/wwe-money-bank-2020-scheduled-may-10-baltimore-md|work=Fightful|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"2020event\">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Mike|title=WWE MONEY IN THE BANK 2020 DETAILS|url=https://pwinsider.com/article/134349/wwe-money-in-the-bank-2020-details.html?p=1|work=PWInsider|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref> However, [[Maryland]] issued a [[stay at home order]] on March 30, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maryland to Enact Stay-at-Home Order Monday as Coronavirus Cases Top 1,400|last=Barnes|first=Sophia|url=https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/maryland-governor-larry-hogan-latest-monday-march-30-coronavirus-outbreak-covid-19-stay-at-home-order/2258161/|work=NBC4 Washington|date=March 30, 2020|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> Subsequently on April 9, the host venue cancelled the event due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], and began issuing refunds.

It is scheduled to take place on May 10, 2020. It will be the eleventh event under the [[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] chronology.\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place at the [[Royal Farms Arena]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], but the venue canceled all shows that were to be held in May [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on sports|due to the]] [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]. WWE announced that the show's [[Money in the Bank ladder match|eponymous ladder matches]] would take place at its \"[[Titan Towers]]\" global headquarters building in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] with a new \"Corporate Ladder\" gimmick culminating on the facility's roof. WWE has not yet announced where the card's remaining matches will originate.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Background ===\n[[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] (MITB) is an annual [[gimmick]] pay-per-view produced by WWE since 2010 and generally held between May and July. The concept of the show comes from WWE's established [[Money in the Bank ladder match]], in which multiple wrestlers use [[Ladder match|ladders]] to retrieve a briefcase hanging above the ring. The briefcase contains a contract that guarantees the winner a match for a world championship of their choosing at any time within the next year. Since the [[Money in the Bank (2018)|2018 event]], both the men's and women's matches featured eight wrestlers, evenly divided between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] [[WWE brand extension|brands]]. For 2020, it was reduced to six wrestlers divided between the brands. Male wrestlers compete for a contract to grant them a match for either Raw's [[WWE Championship]] or SmackDown's [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], while female wrestlers compete for a [[Raw Women's Championship]] or [[SmackDown Women's Championship]] match contract. 2020 will be the eleventh event in the Money in the Bank chronology.<ref name=\"2020event\"/>\n\n====Impact of the coronavirus pandemic====\nThe event was originally announced with [[Baltimore]]'s [[Royal Farms Arena]] as host.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lambert|first=Jeremy|title=WWE Money In The Bank 2020 Scheduled For May 10 In Baltimore, MD|url=https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/wwe-money-bank-2020-scheduled-may-10-baltimore-md|work=Fightful|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"2020event\">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Mike|title=WWE MONEY IN THE BANK 2020 DETAILS|url=https://pwinsider.com/article/134349/wwe-money-in-the-bank-2020-details.html?p=1|work=PWInsider|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref> However, [[Maryland]] issued a [[stay at home order]] on March 30, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maryland to Enact Stay-at-Home Order Monday as Coronavirus Cases Top 1,400|last=Barnes|first=Sophia|url=https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/maryland-governor-larry-hogan-latest-monday-march-30-coronavirus-outbreak-covid-19-stay-at-home-order/2258161/|work=NBC4 Washington|date=March 30, 2020|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> Subsequently on April 9, the host venue cancelled the event due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], and began issuing refunds.

Chamberlain and his supporters believed war could be avoided and hoped Germany would agree to leave the rest of Poland alone. German [[hegemony]] over Central Europe was also at stake. In private, Hitler said in May that Danzig was not the important issue to him, but pursuit of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' for Germany.<ref>''A World at Total War: Global Conflict and the Politics of Destruction, 1937\u20131945'', Roger Chickering, Stig F\u00f6rster, Bernd Greiner, p. 97</ref>\n\n=== Breakdown of talks ===\nWith tensions mounting, Germany turned to aggressive diplomacy. On 28 April 1939, Hitler [[unilateral]]ly withdrew from both the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 and the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935. Talks over Danzig and the Corridor broke down and months passed without diplomatic interaction between Germany and Poland. During this interim period, the Germans learned that France and Britain had failed to secure an alliance with the Soviet Union against Germany, and that the Soviet Union was interested in an alliance with Germany against Poland. Hitler had already issued orders to prepare for a possible \"solution of the Polish problem by military means\" through the [[Fall Weiss (1939)|Case White]] scenario.\n\nIn May 1939, in a statement to his generals while they were in the midst of planning the invasion of Poland, Hitler made it clear that the invasion would not come without resistance as it had in Czechoslovakia:<ref name=\"Clark, Lloyd 2011, page 26\">Clark, Lloyd, ''Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943'', 2011, p. 26</ref>\n\n{{quote|With minor exceptions German national unification has been achieved.

We cannot expect a repetition of Czechoslovakia.

In fact, the Soviets agreed not to aid France or the UK in the event of their going to war with Germany over Poland and, in a secret protocol of the pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed to divide Eastern Europe, including Poland, into two [[spheres of influence]]; the western one-third of the country was to go to Germany and the eastern two-thirds to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe German assault was originally scheduled to begin at 04:00 on 26 August. However, on 25 August, the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]] was signed as an annex to the [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)]]. In this accord, Britain committed itself to the defence of Poland, guaranteeing to preserve Polish independence. At the same time, the British and the Poles were hinting to Berlin that they were willing to resume discussions\u2014not at all how Hitler hoped to frame the conflict. Thus, he wavered and postponed his attack until 1 September, managing to in effect halt the entire invasion \"in mid-leap\".\n[[File:Ribbentrop-Molotov.svg|thumb|left|Planned and actual divisions of Poland, according to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], with later adjustments|alt=Map showing the planned and actual divisions of Poland according to the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact.]]\n\nHowever, there was one exception: on the night of 25\u201326 August, a German sabotage group which had not heard anything about a delay of the invasion made an attack on the [[Jablunkov Pass]] and [[Mosty u Jablunkova|Mosty]] railway station in [[Silesia]]. On the morning of 26 August, this group was repelled by Polish troops. The German side described all this as an incident \"caused by an insane individual\" (see [[Jab\u0142onk\u00f3w incident]]).\n\nOn 26 August, Hitler tried to dissuade the British and the French from interfering in the upcoming conflict, even pledging that the ''Wehrmacht'' forces would be made available to Britain's empire in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/a295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref> The negotiations convinced Hitler that there was little chance the Western Allies would declare war on Germany, and even if they did, because of the lack of \"territorial guarantees\" to Poland, they would be willing to negotiate a compromise favourable to Germany after its conquest of Poland. Meanwhile, the increased number of overflights by high-altitude [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and cross-border troop movements signaled that war was imminent.\n[[File:Second World War Europe.png|right|thumb|The map shows the beginning of World War II in September 1939 in a European context.]]\n\nOn 29 August, prompted by the British, Germany issued one last diplomatic offer, with ''Fall Weiss'' yet to be rescheduled. That evening, the German government responded in a communication that it aimed not only for the restoration of Danzig but also the Polish Corridor (which had not previously been part of Hitler's demands) in addition to the safeguarding of the [[German minority in Poland]]. It said that they were willing to commence negotiations, but indicated that a Polish representative with the power to sign an agreement had to arrive in Berlin the next day while in the meantime it would draw up a set of proposals.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk78.asp Reply of the German Chancellor to the Communication of 28 August 1939, from His Majesty's Government] Cited in the British Blue Book</ref> The British Cabinet was pleased that negotiations had been agreed to but, mindful of how [[Emil H\u00e1cha]] had been [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|forced to sign his country away]] under similar circumstances just months earlier, regarded the requirement for an immediate arrival of a Polish representative with full signing powers as an unacceptable [[ultimatum]].<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk81.asp Viscount Halifax to Sir N.

It was then broadcast that Poland had rejected Germany's offer, and negotiations with Poland came to an end. Hitler issued orders for the invasion to commence soon afterwards.\n\nOn 29 August, Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[J\u00f3zef Beck]] ordered military [[mobilization]], but under the pressure from Great Britain and France, the mobilization was cancelled. When the final mobilization started, it added to the confusion.<ref>Oslon and Cloud,\"A Question of Honor\" p. 50</ref>\n\nOn 30 August, the [[Polish Navy]] sent its destroyer [[flotilla]] to Britain, executing the [[Peking Plan]]. On the same day, [[Marshal of Poland]] [[Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y]] announced the mobilization of Polish troops. However, he was pressured into revoking the order by the French, who apparently still hoped for a diplomatic settlement, failing to realize that the Germans were fully mobilized and concentrated at the Polish border.<ref>Seidner, Stanley S.

However, partly because of the earlier stoppage, Poland finally managed to mobilize only about 70% of its planned forces (only about 900,000 of 1,350,000 soldiers planned to mobilize in first order), and because of that many units were still forming or moving to their designated frontline positions. The late mobilization reduced combat capability of Polish Army by about 1/3.\n\n== Opposing forces ==\n{{See also|Opposing forces in the Polish September Campaign|Soviet order of battle for invasion of Poland in 1939|Slovak invasion of Poland}}\n\n=== Germany ===\n{{See also|German order of battle for the invasion of Poland}}\n\nGermany had a substantial numeric advantage over Poland and had developed a significant military before the conflict. The ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' (army) had 3,472 [[tank]]s in its inventory, of which 2,859 were with the Field Army and 408 with the [[Replacement Army]].{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=88}} 453 tanks were assigned into four light divisions, while another 225 tanks were in detached regiments and companies.{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=91}}  Most notably, the Germans had seven ''[[Panzer]]'' divisions, with 2,009 tanks between them, utilizing a new [[operational doctrine]].{{sfn|Jentz|1996|pp=90\u201391}} It held that these divisions should act in coordination with other elements of the military, punching holes in the enemy line and isolating selected units, which would be [[Encirclement|encircled]] and destroyed. This would be followed up by less-mobile mechanized infantry and foot soldiers. The ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (air force) provided both tactical and strategic [[air power]], particularly [[dive bomber]]s that disrupted lines of supply and communications. Together, the new methods were nicknamed \"''[[Blitzkrieg]]''\" (lightning war). While historian [[Basil Liddell Hart]] claimed \"Poland was a full demonstration of the ''Blitzkrieg'' theory\",<ref>B.H. Hart & A.J.P. Taylor, p. 41</ref> [[Invasion of Poland#Misconceptions|some other historians]] disagree.<ref name=Cooper0 />\n\n[[Aircraft]] played a major role in the campaign. [[Bomber aircraft|Bombers]] also attacked cities, causing huge losses amongst the civilian population through [[terror bombing]] and strafing. The ''Luftwaffe'' forces consisted of 1,180 [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], 290 [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju 87 ''Stuka'']] [[dive bomber]]s, 1,100 conventional bombers (mainly [[Heinkel He 111]]s and [[Dornier Do 17]]s), and an assortment of 550 transport and 350 reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Bombers of the Luftwaffe, Joachim Dressel and Manfred Griehl, Arms and Armour, 1994</ref><ref>The Flying pencil, Heinz J.

The partitioning powers did not invest in the development of industry, especially in the armaments industry in ethnically Polish areas. Moreover, Poland had to deal with damage caused by [[World War I]]. This resulted in the need to build a defense industry from scratch. Between 1936 and 1939, Poland invested heavily in the newly created [[Centralny Okr\u0119g Przemys\u0142owy|Central Industrial Region]]. Preparations for a defensive war with Germany were ongoing for many years, but most plans assumed fighting would not begin before 1942. To raise funds for industrial development, Poland sold much of the modern equipment it produced.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', p. 177</ref> In 1936, a [[Fundusz Obrony Narodowej|National Defence Fund]] was set up to collect funds necessary for strengthening the Polish Armed forces. The [[Polish Army]] had approximately a million soldiers, but not all were mobilized by 1 September. Latecomers sustained significant casualties when public transport became targets of the ''Luftwaffe''. The Polish military had fewer armored forces than the Germans, and these units, dispersed within the infantry, were unable to effectively engage the Germans.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 270\u201394</ref>\n\nExperiences in the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] shaped Polish Army organizational and operational doctrine. Unlike the [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]], the Polish\u2013Soviet War was a conflict in which the [[cavalry]]'s mobility played a decisive role.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 135\u2013138</ref> Poland acknowledged the benefits of mobility but was unable to invest heavily in many of the expensive, unproven inventions since then.

The Polish Air Force consisted of a 'Bomber Brigade', 'Pursuit Brigade' and aircraft assigned to the various ground armies.<ref>'Duel for the Sky' by Christopher Shores</ref> The Polish fighters were older than their German counterparts; the PZL P.11 fighter\u2014produced in the early 1930s\u2014had a top speed of only {{convert|365|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, far less than German bombers.

As a \"last minute\" order in the summer of 1939, Poland bought 160 French [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]] fighters and 111 English airplanes (100 light bombers [[Fairey Battle]], 10 [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] and 1 [[Supermarine Spitfire]]; the sale of 150 Spitfires asked by the Polish government was rejected by the Air Ministry).<ref name=\"Wojciech Mazur\">{{cite journal |last1=Mazur |first1=Wojciech |title=Pomocnik Historyczny |journal=Polityka |date=March 2009 |volume=3/2009 |page=103}}</ref> Despite the fact that some of the airplanes had been shipped to Poland (the first transport of purchased aircraft on the ship \"Lassel\" sailed from Liverpool on 28 August 1939<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.plus-minus.net.pl/PomocPolsce/UnitedKingdom/index1.html | title=1::Pomoc wojenna Imperium Brytyjskiego dla Polski w okresie II Wojny \u015aWIATOWEJ}}</ref>), none of them would take part in combat.

It called for the start of hostilities before a [[declaration of war]], and pursued a doctrine of mass encirclement and destruction of enemy forces. The infantry\u2014far from completely mechanized but fitted with fast-moving artillery and logistic support\u2014was to be supported by ''Panzers'' and small numbers of truck-mounted infantry (the ''Sch\u00fctzen'' regiments, forerunners of the ''[[panzergrenadier]]s'') to assist the rapid movement of troops and concentrate on [[Schwerpunkt|localized parts]] of the enemy [[Military front|front]], eventually isolating segments of the enemy, surrounding, and destroying them. The pre-war \"armored idea\" (which an American journalist in 1939 dubbed ''Blitzkrieg'')\u2014which was advocated by some generals, including [[Heinz Guderian]]\u2014would have had the armor punching holes in the enemy's front and ranging deep into rear areas; in actuality, the campaign in Poland would be fought along more traditional lines. This stemmed from conservatism on the part of the German high command, who mainly restricted the role of armor and mechanized forces to supporting the conventional infantry divisions.\n\nPoland's terrain was well suited for mobile operations when the weather cooperated; the country had flat [[plain]]s with long frontiers totalling almost {{convert|5600|km|mi|abbr=on}}, Poland's long border with Germany on the west and north\u2014facing East Prussia\u2014extended {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

Colonel General [[Fedor von Bock]] commanded Army Group North, comprising General [[Georg von K\u00fcchler]]'s 3rd Army, which was to strike southward from East Prussia, and General [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]]'s 4th Army, which was to attack eastward across the base of the [[Polish Corridor]].\n* A tertiary attack by part of Army Group South's allied [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak]] units from Slovakia.\n* From within Poland, the German minority would assist by engaging in diversion and sabotage operations through ''[[Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz]]'' units prepared before the war.\n\nAll three assaults were to converge on [[Warsaw]], while the main Polish army was to be encircled and destroyed west of the [[Vistula]]. ''Fall Weiss'' was initiated on 1 September 1939, and was the first operation of [[European Theatre of World War II|Second World War in Europe]].\n\n=== Polish defence plan ===\n[[File:Dywizje wrzesien 1.png|thumb|right|Deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions immediately before the German invasion.|alt=Map showing deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions on 1 September 1939, immediately before the German invasion.]]\n\nThe Polish determination to deploy forces directly at the German-Polish border, prompted by the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]], shaped the country's defence plan, \"[[Plan West]]\". Poland's most valuable natural resources, industry and population were located along the western border in [[Silesian Voivodeship (1920\u20131939)|Eastern Upper Silesia]]. Polish policy centred on their protection especially since many politicians feared that if Poland were to retreat from the regions disputed by Germany, Britain and France would sign a separate peace treaty with Germany similar to the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 68\u201372</ref> The fact that none of Poland's allies had specifically guaranteed Polish borders or [[territorial integrity]] didn't help in easing Polish concerns. For these reasons, the Polish government disregarded French advice to deploy the bulk of its forces behind natural barriers such as the [[Vistula]] and [[San (river)|San]] rivers, even though some Polish generals supported it as a better strategy. The West Plan did permit the Polish armies to retreat inside the country, but it was supposed to be a slow retreat behind prepared positions and was intended to give the armed forces time to complete its mobilization and execute a general [[counteroffensive]] with the support of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]].<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 122\u201325</ref>\n\nIn the case of a failure to defend the most of the territory, the army was to retreat to the south-east of the country, where the rough terrain, the [[Stryi River|Stryj]] and [[Dniestr]] rivers, valleys, hills and swamps would provide natural lines of defence against the [[Nazi Germany|German]] advance and [[Romanian Bridgehead]] could be created.\n[[File:Polish P-11 camouflaged in airfield 1939.jpg|thumb|left|A camouflaged Polish P-11 fighter at a combat airfield|alt=A photo of a Polish P-11 fighter covered in camouflage netting at an unidentified combat airfield]]\n\nThe Polish General Staff had not begun elaborating the \"West\" defence plan until 4 March 1939. It was assumed that the Polish Army, fighting in the initial phase of the war alone, would be compelled to defend the western regions of the country. The plan of operations took into account, first of all, the numerical and material superiority of the enemy and, consequently, assumed the defensive character of Polish operations. The Polish intentions were: defence of the western regions judged as indispensable for waging the war, taking advantage of the propitious conditions for counterattacks by reserve units, and avoidance of being smashed before the beginning of Franco/British operations in Western Europe. The [[operation plan|operational plan]] had not been elaborated in detail and concerned only the first stage of operations.<ref name=\"Wojna Obronna\" />\n\nThe British and French estimated that Poland would be able to defend itself for two to three months, while Poland estimated it could do so for at least six months. While Poland drafted its estimates based upon the expectation that the Western Allies would honor their treaty obligations and quickly start an offensive of their own, the French and British expected the war to develop into [[trench warfare]] much like World War I. The Polish government was not notified of this strategy and based all of its defence plans on promises of quick relief by their Western allies.<ref name=\"Pi\u0105tkowski\">{{cite book | author =Henryk Pi\u0105tkowski | title =Kampania wrze\u015bniowa 1939 roku w Polsce | year =1943 | page =39 | publisher =Sekcja Wydawnicza APW | location =Jerusalem | url =http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | accessdate =2 November 2011 | language =pl | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080209164014/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | archive-date =9 February 2008 | url-status =dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Raczy\u0144ski\">{{cite book | author=Count [[Edward Raczy\u0144ski (1891\u20131993)|Edward Raczy\u0144ski]] | title = The British-Polish Alliance; Its Origin and Meaning | year =1948 | publisher=Mellville Press | location = London }}</ref>\n\nPolish forces were stretched thinly along the Polish-German border and lacked compact defence lines and good defence positions along disadvantageous terrain. This strategy also left [[supply line]]s poorly protected. One-third of Poland's forces were massed in or near the Polish Corridor, making them vulnerable to a [[Pincer movement|double envelopment]] from East Prussia and the west. Another third were concentrated in the north-central part of the country, between the major cities of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and Warsaw.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 304\u2013310</ref> The forward positioning of Polish forces vastly increased the difficulty of carrying out strategic maneuvers, compounded by inadequate mobility, as Polish units often lacked the ability to retreat from their defensive positions as they were being overrun by more mobile German mechanized formations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n[[File:Peking.jpg|thumb|[[Peking Plan]]: Polish destroyers evacuate the Baltic Sea en route to the United Kingdom.|alt=Photo of three Polish destroyers executing the Peking Plan and evacuating to British before the start of the invasion.]]\n\nAs the prospect of conflict increased, the British government pressed Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz to evacuate the most modern elements of the Polish Navy from the Baltic Sea.<ref name=\"PN\" /> In the event of war the Polish military leaders realized that the ships which remained in the Baltic were likely to be quickly sunk by the Germans. Furthermore, the [[Danish straits]] were well within operating range of the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' and ''Luftwaffe'', so there was little chance of an evacuation plan succeeding if implemented after hostilities began. Four days after the signing of the Polish-British Common Defence Pact, three destroyers of the Polish Navy executed the Peking Plan and consequently evacuated to Great Britain.<ref name=\"PN\" />\n\nAlthough the Polish military had prepared for conflict, the civilian population remained largely unprepared. Polish pre-war [[propaganda]] emphasized that any German invasion would be easily repelled. Consequently, Polish defeats during the German invasion came as a shock to the civilian population.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Lacking training for such a disaster, the civilian population panicked and retreated east, spreading chaos, lowering troop morale and making road transportation for Polish troops very difficult.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> The propaganda also had some negative consequences for the Polish troops themselves, whose communications, disrupted by German mobile units operating in the rear and civilians blocking roads, were further thrown into chaos by bizarre reports from Polish radio stations and newspapers, which often reported imaginary victories and other military operations. This led to some Polish troops being encircled or taking a stand against overwhelming odds, when they thought they were actually counterattacking or would soon receive reinforcements from other victorious areas.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n=== Phase 1: German invasion ===\n[[File:Poland2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Map showing the advances made by the Germans, and the disposition of all troops from 1 to 14 September|alt=Map showing the advance made by the Germans, and the disposition of German and Polish troops on 14 September 1939.]]\n\nFollowing several German-staged incidents (like the Gleiwitz incident, a part of [[Operation Himmler]]), which German propaganda used as a [[pretext]] to claim that German forces were acting in [[self-defence]], one of the first acts of war took place on 1 September 1939. At 04:45, the old German [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] ''[[German battleship Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]]'' opened fire on the Polish military transit depot at [[Battle of Westerplatte|Westerplatte]] in the Free City of Danzig on the [[Baltic Sea]]. However, in many places German units crossed the Polish border even before 04.45. Around that time Luftwaffe attacked a number of military and civilian targets, including [[bombing of Wielu\u0144]], the first large scale city bombing of the war. At 08:00, German troops\u2014still without a formal declaration of war issued\u2014[[Battle of Mokra|attacked near the Polish village of Mokra]]. The [[Battle of the Border]] had begun. Later that day, the Germans attacked on Poland's western, southern and northern borders, while German aircraft began raids on Polish cities. The main axis of attack led eastwards from Germany through the western Polish border. Supporting attacks came from East Prussia in the north, and a joint German-Slovak tertiary attack by units ([[Field Army Bernol\u00e1k|Field Army \"Bernol\u00e1k\"]]) from the German-allied Slovak Republic in the south. All three assaults converged on the Polish capital of Warsaw.\n[[File:Zniszczenia1939 0.jpg|thumb|left|The city of [[Wielu\u0144]] destroyed by ''Luftwaffe'' bombing|alt=Aerial photo showing the city of Wielu\u0144, which was destroyed by ''Luftwaffe'' bombing on 1 September]]\n\nFrance and the UK declared war on Germany on 3 September, but [[Western betrayal|failed to provide any meaningful support]]. The German-French border saw only [[Saar Offensive|a few minor skirmishes]], although the majority of German forces, including 85% of their armoured forces, were engaged in Poland. Despite some Polish successes in minor border battles, German technical, operational and numerical superiority forced the Polish armies to retreat from the borders towards Warsaw and [[Lw\u00f3w]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' gained [[air superiority]] early in the campaign. By destroying communications, the ''Luftwaffe'' increased the pace of the advance which overran Polish airstrips and early warning sites, causing logistical problems for the Poles. Many [[Polish Air Force]] units ran low on supplies, 98 of their number withdrew into then-neutral Romania.<ref name=\"E.R Hooton, p87\" /> The Polish initial strength of 400 was reduced to 54 by 14 September and air opposition virtually ceased,<ref name=\"E.R Hooton, p87\" /> with the main Polish air bases destroyed in the first 48 hours of the war.<ref name=\"gunther1940\">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n13/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper & Brothers |location=New York|authorlink=John Gunther| author=Gunther, John | year=1940 | pages=xvi\u2013xvii}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S55480, Polen, Parade vor Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|Hitler watching German soldiers marching into Poland in September 1939.]]\n\nGermany attacked from three directions on land.

At the same time, Guderian led his 3rd Army tanks across the Narew, attacking the line of the [[Bug River]], already encircling Warsaw. All the German armies made progress in fulfilling their parts of the ''Fall Weiss'' plan. The Polish armies were splitting up into uncoordinated fragments, some of which were retreating while others were launching disjointed attacks on the nearest German columns.\n\n[[File:Komancza 1939 onet.1.09.2010.jpg|thumb|Cheerful German and [[Slovak invasion of Poland|Slovak soldiers]] posing with a group of civilians in [[Koma\u0144cza]], September 1939.]]\nPolish forces abandoned the regions of [[Pomerelia]] (the Polish Corridor), [[Greater Poland]] and [[Silesian Voivodeship (1920\u20131939)|Polish Upper Silesia]] in the first week. The Polish plan for border defence was proven a dismal failure. The German advance as a whole was not slowed. On 10 September, the Polish commander-in-chief\u2014Marshal Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y\u2014ordered a [[Withdrawal (military)|general retreat]] to the southeast, towards the Romanian Bridgehead.<ref name=\"Stanley S 1977, pp. 29\" /> Meanwhile, the Germans were tightening their encirclement of the Polish forces west of the Vistula (in the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a area and, still farther west, around [[Pozna\u0144]]) and also penetrating deeply into eastern Poland.

Around that time, advanced German forces also reached the city of [[Lw\u00f3w]], a major [[metropolis]] in eastern Poland. 1,150 German aircraft bombed Warsaw on 24 September.\n\n[[File:Polish artillery Battle of Bzura 1939.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A bombed Polish Army column during the [[Battle of the Bzura]]|alt=A bombed Polish Army column during the Battle of the Bzura.]]\nThe Polish defensive plan called for a strategy of encirclement: they were to allow the Germans to advance in between two Polish Army groups in the line between Berlin and Warsaw-Lodz, at which point [[Armia Prusy]] would move in and repulse the German spearhead, trapping them. In order for this to happen, Armia Prusy needed to be fully mobilized by 3 September.

The German troops left the area, and the Red Army troops entered Lviv on 22 September.\n\nThe Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop pact and the invasion of Poland marked the beginning of a period during which the government of the Soviet Union increasingly tried to convince itself that the actions of Germany were reasonable, and were not developments to be worried about, despite evidence to the contrary.<ref>Clark, Lloyd, ''Kursk: The greatest battle: Eastern Front 1943'', 2011, pp. 62, 67, 76\u201380</ref> On 7 September 1939, just a few days after France and Britain joined the war against Germany, Stalin explained to a colleague that the war was to the advantage of the Soviet Union, as follows:<ref name=\"Clark, Lloyd 2011, page 62\">Clark, Lloyd, ''Kursk: The greatest battle: Eastern Front 1943'', 2011, p. 62</ref>\n\n{{quote|A war is on between two groups of capitalist countries ... for the redivision of the world, for the domination of the world!

It would be months before Hitler would see the futility of his peace negotiation attempts with the United Kingdom and France, but the culmination of combined European and Pacific conflicts would result in what was truly a \"world war\". Thus, what was not seen by most politicians and generals in 1939 is clear from the historical perspective: The Polish September Campaign marked the beginning of a pan-European war, which combined with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] in 1937 and the [[Pacific War]] in 1941 to form the global conflict known as World War II.\n\nThe invasion of Poland led Britain and France to declare war on Germany on 3 September. However, they did little to affect the outcome of the September Campaign. No declaration of war was issued by Britain and France against the Soviet Union. This lack of direct help led many Poles to believe that they had been [[Western betrayal#Up to 1939|betrayed by their Western allies]]. Foreign Secretary [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Edward Wood]] said they were only obligated to declare war on Germany due to the first clause of the [[Anglo-Polish military alliance|Anglo-Polish Agreement]] in 1939.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sword|first=Keith Sword|date=1991|title=British Reactions to the Soviet Occupation of Eastern Poland in September 1939|url=|journal=The Slavonic and East European Review |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=81\u2013101|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe different attitude of the Anglo-French allies of Poland towards Nazi Germany and the USSR was argued at this time, for example, by the future head of the British government, Churchill:\n\n \"Russians were guilty of gross treachery during the recent negotiations, but Marshal Voroshilov's demand that the Russian armies, if they were allies of Poland, should occupy Vilnius and Lvov was a perfectly reasonable military demand. It was rejected by Poland, whose arguments, despite their naturalness, cannot be considered satisfactory in the light of current events. As a result, Russia took up the same positions as an enemy of Poland that it might have taken as a very dubious and suspected friend. The difference is actually not as great as it might seem. The Russians mobilized a very large force and showed that they were able to move quickly and far from their pre-war positions. They now border on Germany, and the latter is completely unable to expose the Eastern front. A large German army will have to be left behind to monitor it.

In 1939, only 10% of the Polish army was made up of cavalry units.<ref>Henryk Smaczny, ''Ksi\u0119ga kawalerii polskiej'' (\"Book of Polish cavalry\"), TESCO, Warszawa 1989, {{ISBN|83-00-02555-3}}</ref> [[Polish cavalry]] never charged German tanks or entrenched infantry or artillery, but usually acted as [[Mounted infantry|mobile infantry]] (like [[dragoon]]s) and reconnaissance units, and executed cavalry charges only in rare situations against foot soldiers.

The last cavalry-vs-cavalry battle in Europe was fought between German and Polish cavalries ([[Battle of Krasnobr\u00f3d (1939)]]). Polish cavalry consisted of 11 [[brigade]]s, equipped with [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35|\"UR\" anti-tank rifles]] and light artillery such as the highly effective [[Bofors 37 mm]] anti-tank gun. The myth originated from war correspondents' reports similar to that of the [[Charge at Krojanty|Battle of Krojanty]], where a Polish cavalry brigade was fired upon in ambush by hidden armored vehicles, after it had mounted a successful sabre-charge against German infantry. There were also cases when Polish cavalry dashing between tanks trying to break out of encirclement gave an impression of an attack.<ref group=\"Note\">Seidner takes issue here with this contention on at least one occasion.

Though numerically inferior, it had been redeployed from major air bases to small camouflaged airfields shortly before the war. Only some [[trainer aircraft|trainers]] and auxiliary aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The Polish Air Force, despite being significantly outnumbered and with its fighters outmatched by more advanced German fighters, remained active until the second week of the campaign, inflicting significant damage on the ''Luftwaffe''.<ref>Steven J.

Visible shattered window.]]\n\n=== First use of ''Blitzkrieg'' strategy ===\nIt is often assumed that '' Blitzkrieg'' is the strategy that Germany first used in Poland. Many early post-war histories, such as Barrie Pitt's in ''The Second World War'' (BPC Publishing 1966), attribute German victory to \"enormous development in military technique which occurred between 1918 and 1940\", and cite that \"Germany, who translated (British inter-war) theories into action... called the result ''Blitzkrieg''\". That idea has been repudiated by some authors. Matthew Cooper writes:\n\n{{quote|\"Throughout the Polish Campaign, the employment of the mechanized units revealed the idea that they were intended solely to ease the advance and to support the activities of the infantry.... Thus, any strategic exploitation of the armoured idea was still-born. The paralysis of command and the breakdown of morale were not made the ultimate aim of the{{nbs}}... German ground and air forces, and were only incidental by-products of the traditional manoeuvers of rapid encirclement and of the supporting activities of the flying artillery of the ''Luftwaffe'', both of which had as their purpose the physical destruction of the enemy troops. Such was the ''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' of the Polish campaign.\" \u2013 Cooper<ref name=\"Cooper176\" />|sign=|source=}}\n\n''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' was a strategy dating back to [[Frederick the Great]], and it was applied in the Polish Campaign, little changed from the [[Franco-Prussian War|French campaigns in 1870]] or 1914. The use of [[tank]]s\n\n{{quote|...left much to be desired... Fear of enemy action against the flanks of the advance, fear which was to prove so disastrous to German prospects in the west in 1940 and in the Soviet Union in 1941, was present from the beginning of the war. \u2013 Cooper<ref name=Cooper0 />}}\n\nJohn Ellis, writing in ''[[Brute Force (book)|Brute Force]]'', asserted that\n\n{{quote|...there is considerable justice in Matthew Cooper's assertion that the ''panzer'' divisions were not given the kind of ''strategic'' mission that was to characterize authentic armoured ''blitzkrieg'', and were almost always closely subordinated to the various mass infantry armies. \u2013 Ellis<ref>Ellis, John (1999). ''Brute Force: Allied Strategy and Tactics in the Second World War'', pp. 3\u20134</ref> (emphasis in original)}}\n\nZaloga and Madej, in ''The Polish Campaign 1939'', also address the subject of mythical interpretations of ''Blitzkrieg'' and the importance of other arms in the campaign. Western accounts of the September campaign have stressed the shock value of the ''panzers'' and ''Stuka'' attacks, they have\n\n{{quote|...tended to underestimate the punishing effect of German artillery on Polish units. Mobile and available in significant quantity, artillery shattered as many units as any other branch of the ''Wehrmacht''. \u2013 Zaloga and Madej<ref name=\"Cooper4\" />}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Eastern Front (World War II)]]\n* [[Polish resistance movement in World War II]]\n* [[History of Poland (1939\u20131945)]]\n* [[Horses in World War II]]\n* [[List of Polish divisions in World War II]]\n* [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)]]\n* [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]]\n* [[Phoney War]]\n* [[Polish cavalry brigade order of battle in 1939]]\n* [[Polish contribution to World War II]]\n* [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)]]\n* [[Timeline of the invasion of Poland]]\n* [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht]]\n* [[Western betrayal]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n== References ==\n<!--This article uses the Cite.php citation mechanism.

As the Wehrmacht advanced, Polish forces withdrew from their forward bases of operation close to the [[Germany\u2013Poland border]] to more established [[defense line]]s to the east. After the mid-September Polish defeat in the [[Battle of the Bzura]], the Germans gained an undisputed advantage.

On 28 April 1939, Hitler [[unilateral]]ly withdrew from both the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 and the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935. Talks over Danzig and the Corridor broke down and months passed without diplomatic interaction between Germany and Poland. During this interim period, the Germans learned that France and Britain had failed to secure an alliance with the Soviet Union against Germany, and that the Soviet Union was interested in an alliance with Germany against Poland. Hitler had already issued orders to prepare for a possible \"solution of the Polish problem by military means\" through the [[Fall Weiss (1939)|Case White]] scenario.\n\nIn May 1939, in a statement to his generals while they were in the midst of planning the invasion of Poland, Hitler made it clear that the invasion would not come without resistance as it had in Czechoslovakia:<ref name=\"Clark, Lloyd 2011, page 26\">Clark, Lloyd, ''Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943'', 2011, p. 26</ref>\n\n{{quote|With minor exceptions German national unification has been achieved.

In fact, the Soviets agreed not to aid France or the UK in the event of their going to war with Germany over Poland and, in a secret protocol of the pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed to divide Eastern Europe, including Poland, into two [[spheres of influence]]; the western one-third of the country was to go to Germany and the eastern two-thirds to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe German assault was originally scheduled to begin at 04:00 on 26 August. However, on 25 August, the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]] was signed as an annex to the [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)]]. In this accord, Britain committed itself to the defence of Poland, guaranteeing to preserve Polish independence. At the same time, the British and the Poles were hinting to Berlin that they were willing to resume discussions\u2014not at all how Hitler hoped to frame the conflict. Thus, he wavered and postponed his attack until 1 September, managing to in effect halt the entire invasion \"in mid-leap\".\n[[File:Ribbentrop-Molotov.svg|thumb|left|Planned and actual divisions of Poland, according to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], with later adjustments|alt=Map showing the planned and actual divisions of Poland according to the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact.]]\n\nHowever, there was one exception: on the night of 25\u201326 August, a German sabotage group which had not heard anything about a delay of the invasion made an attack on the [[Jablunkov Pass]] and [[Mosty u Jablunkova|Mosty]] railway station in [[Silesia]]. On the morning of 26 August, this group was repelled by Polish troops. The German side described all this as an incident \"caused by an insane individual\" (see [[Jab\u0142onk\u00f3w incident]]).\n\nOn 26 August, Hitler tried to dissuade the British and the French from interfering in the upcoming conflict, even pledging that the ''Wehrmacht'' forces would be made available to Britain's empire in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/a295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref> The negotiations convinced Hitler that there was little chance the Western Allies would declare war on Germany, and even if they did, because of the lack of \"territorial guarantees\" to Poland, they would be willing to negotiate a compromise favourable to Germany after its conquest of Poland. Meanwhile, the increased number of overflights by high-altitude [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and cross-border troop movements signaled that war was imminent.\n[[File:Second World War Europe.png|right|thumb|The map shows the beginning of World War II in September 1939 in a European context.]]\n\nOn 29 August, prompted by the British, Germany issued one last diplomatic offer, with ''Fall Weiss'' yet to be rescheduled. That evening, the German government responded in a communication that it aimed not only for the restoration of Danzig but also the Polish Corridor (which had not previously been part of Hitler's demands) in addition to the safeguarding of the [[German minority in Poland]]. It said that they were willing to commence negotiations, but indicated that a Polish representative with the power to sign an agreement had to arrive in Berlin the next day while in the meantime it would draw up a set of proposals.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk78.asp Reply of the German Chancellor to the Communication of 28 August 1939, from His Majesty's Government] Cited in the British Blue Book</ref> The British Cabinet was pleased that negotiations had been agreed to but, mindful of how [[Emil H\u00e1cha]] had been [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|forced to sign his country away]] under similar circumstances just months earlier, regarded the requirement for an immediate arrival of a Polish representative with full signing powers as an unacceptable [[ultimatum]].<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk81.asp Viscount Halifax to Sir N.

It was then broadcast that Poland had rejected Germany's offer, and negotiations with Poland came to an end. Hitler issued orders for the invasion to commence soon afterwards.\n\nOn 29 August, Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[J\u00f3zef Beck]] ordered military [[mobilization]], but under the pressure from Great Britain and France, the mobilization was cancelled. When the final mobilization started, it added to the confusion.<ref>Oslon and Cloud,\"A Question of Honor\" p. 50</ref>\n\nOn 30 August, the [[Polish Navy]] sent its destroyer [[flotilla]] to Britain, executing the [[Peking Plan]]. On the same day, [[Marshal of Poland]] [[Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y]] announced the mobilization of Polish troops. However, he was pressured into revoking the order by the French, who apparently still hoped for a diplomatic settlement, failing to realize that the Germans were fully mobilized and concentrated at the Polish border.<ref>Seidner, Stanley S.

However, partly because of the earlier stoppage, Poland finally managed to mobilize only about 70% of its planned forces (only about 900,000 of 1,350,000 soldiers planned to mobilize in first order), and because of that many units were still forming or moving to their designated frontline positions. The late mobilization reduced combat capability of Polish Army by about 1/3.\n\n== Opposing forces ==\n{{See also|Opposing forces in the Polish September Campaign|Soviet order of battle for invasion of Poland in 1939|Slovak invasion of Poland}}\n\n=== Germany ===\n{{See also|German order of battle for the invasion of Poland}}\n\nGermany had a substantial numeric advantage over Poland and had developed a significant military before the conflict. The ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' (army) had 3,472 [[tank]]s in its inventory, of which 2,859 were with the Field Army and 408 with the [[Replacement Army]].{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=88}} 453 tanks were assigned into four light divisions, while another 225 tanks were in detached regiments and companies.{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=91}}  Most notably, the Germans had seven ''[[Panzer]]'' divisions, with 2,009 tanks between them, utilizing a new [[operational doctrine]].{{sfn|Jentz|1996|pp=90\u201391}} It held that these divisions should act in coordination with other elements of the military, punching holes in the enemy line and isolating selected units, which would be [[Encirclement|encircled]] and destroyed. This would be followed up by less-mobile mechanized infantry and foot soldiers. The ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (air force) provided both tactical and strategic [[air power]], particularly [[dive bomber]]s that disrupted lines of supply and communications. Together, the new methods were nicknamed \"''[[Blitzkrieg]]''\" (lightning war). While historian [[Basil Liddell Hart]] claimed \"Poland was a full demonstration of the ''Blitzkrieg'' theory\",<ref>B.H. Hart & A.J.P. Taylor, p. 41</ref> [[Invasion of Poland#Misconceptions|some other historians]] disagree.<ref name=Cooper0 />\n\n[[Aircraft]] played a major role in the campaign. [[Bomber aircraft|Bombers]] also attacked cities, causing huge losses amongst the civilian population through [[terror bombing]] and strafing. The ''Luftwaffe'' forces consisted of 1,180 [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], 290 [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju 87 ''Stuka'']] [[dive bomber]]s, 1,100 conventional bombers (mainly [[Heinkel He 111]]s and [[Dornier Do 17]]s), and an assortment of 550 transport and 350 reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Bombers of the Luftwaffe, Joachim Dressel and Manfred Griehl, Arms and Armour, 1994</ref><ref>The Flying pencil, Heinz J.

The partitioning powers did not invest in the development of industry, especially in the armaments industry in ethnically Polish areas. Moreover, Poland had to deal with damage caused by [[World War I]]. This resulted in the need to build a defense industry from scratch. Between 1936 and 1939, Poland invested heavily in the newly created [[Centralny Okr\u0119g Przemys\u0142owy|Central Industrial Region]]. Preparations for a defensive war with Germany were ongoing for many years, but most plans assumed fighting would not begin before 1942. To raise funds for industrial development, Poland sold much of the modern equipment it produced.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', p. 177</ref> In 1936, a [[Fundusz Obrony Narodowej|National Defence Fund]] was set up to collect funds necessary for strengthening the Polish Armed forces. The [[Polish Army]] had approximately a million soldiers, but not all were mobilized by 1 September. Latecomers sustained significant casualties when public transport became targets of the ''Luftwaffe''. The Polish military had fewer armored forces than the Germans, and these units, dispersed within the infantry, were unable to effectively engage the Germans.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 270\u201394</ref>\n\nExperiences in the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] shaped Polish Army organizational and operational doctrine. Unlike the [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]], the Polish\u2013Soviet War was a conflict in which the [[cavalry]]'s mobility played a decisive role.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 135\u2013138</ref> Poland acknowledged the benefits of mobility but was unable to invest heavily in many of the expensive, unproven inventions since then.

It called for the start of hostilities before a [[declaration of war]], and pursued a doctrine of mass encirclement and destruction of enemy forces. The infantry\u2014far from completely mechanized but fitted with fast-moving artillery and logistic support\u2014was to be supported by ''Panzers'' and small numbers of truck-mounted infantry (the ''Sch\u00fctzen'' regiments, forerunners of the ''[[panzergrenadier]]s'') to assist the rapid movement of troops and concentrate on [[Schwerpunkt|localized parts]] of the enemy [[Military front|front]], eventually isolating segments of the enemy, surrounding, and destroying them. The pre-war \"armored idea\" (which an American journalist in 1939 dubbed ''Blitzkrieg'')\u2014which was advocated by some generals, including [[Heinz Guderian]]\u2014would have had the armor punching holes in the enemy's front and ranging deep into rear areas; in actuality, the campaign in Poland would be fought along more traditional lines. This stemmed from conservatism on the part of the German high command, who mainly restricted the role of armor and mechanized forces to supporting the conventional infantry divisions.\n\nPoland's terrain was well suited for mobile operations when the weather cooperated; the country had flat [[plain]]s with long frontiers totalling almost {{convert|5600|km|mi|abbr=on}}, Poland's long border with Germany on the west and north\u2014facing East Prussia\u2014extended {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Those had been lengthened by another {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the southern side in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement of 1938. The German incorporation of [[Bohemia and Moravia]] and creation of the German [[puppet state]] of [[History of Slovakia#World War II|Slovakia]] meant that Poland's southern flank was also exposed.\n\nHitler demanded that Poland be conquered in six weeks, but German planners thought that it would require three months.<ref name=\"knickerbocker1941\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwGwpIBHhgcC&lpg=PR2&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Is Tomorrow Hitler's? 200 Questions On the Battle of Mankind | publisher=Reynal & Hitchcock | author=Knickerbocker, H.R. | year=1941 | pages=29\u201330| isbn=978-1-4179-9277-5 }}</ref> They intended to fully exploit their long border with the great enveloping manoeuver of ''Fall Weiss''. German units were to invade Poland from three directions:\n* A main attack over the western Polish border. This was to be carried out by Army Group South commanded by Colonel General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], attacking from German [[Silesia]] and from the [[Moravia]]n and Slovak border: General [[Johannes Blaskowitz]]'s 8th Army was to drive eastward against [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]; General [[Wilhelm List]]'s 14th Army was to push on toward [[Krak\u00f3w]] and to turn the Poles' [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] flank; and General [[Walter von Reichenau]]'s 10th Army, in the centre with Army Group South's armor, was to deliver the decisive blow with a northeastward thrust into the heart of Poland.\n* A second route of attack from northern [[Prussia]]. Colonel General [[Fedor von Bock]] commanded Army Group North, comprising General [[Georg von K\u00fcchler]]'s 3rd Army, which was to strike southward from East Prussia, and General [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]]'s 4th Army, which was to attack eastward across the base of the [[Polish Corridor]].\n* A tertiary attack by part of Army Group South's allied [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak]] units from Slovakia.\n* From within Poland, the German minority would assist by engaging in diversion and sabotage operations through ''[[Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz]]'' units prepared before the war.\n\nAll three assaults were to converge on [[Warsaw]], while the main Polish army was to be encircled and destroyed west of the [[Vistula]]. ''Fall Weiss'' was initiated on 1 September 1939, and was the first operation of [[European Theatre of World War II|Second World War in Europe]].\n\n=== Polish defence plan ===\n[[File:Dywizje wrzesien 1.png|thumb|right|Deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions immediately before the German invasion.|alt=Map showing deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions on 1 September 1939, immediately before the German invasion.]]\n\nThe Polish determination to deploy forces directly at the German-Polish border, prompted by the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]], shaped the country's defence plan, \"[[Plan West]]\". Poland's most valuable natural resources, industry and population were located along the western border in [[Silesian Voivodeship (1920\u20131939)|Eastern Upper Silesia]]. Polish policy centred on their protection especially since many politicians feared that if Poland were to retreat from the regions disputed by Germany, Britain and France would sign a separate peace treaty with Germany similar to the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 68\u201372</ref> The fact that none of Poland's allies had specifically guaranteed Polish borders or [[territorial integrity]] didn't help in easing Polish concerns. For these reasons, the Polish government disregarded French advice to deploy the bulk of its forces behind natural barriers such as the [[Vistula]] and [[San (river)|San]] rivers, even though some Polish generals supported it as a better strategy. The West Plan did permit the Polish armies to retreat inside the country, but it was supposed to be a slow retreat behind prepared positions and was intended to give the armed forces time to complete its mobilization and execute a general [[counteroffensive]] with the support of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]].<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 122\u201325</ref>\n\nIn the case of a failure to defend the most of the territory, the army was to retreat to the south-east of the country, where the rough terrain, the [[Stryi River|Stryj]] and [[Dniestr]] rivers, valleys, hills and swamps would provide natural lines of defence against the [[Nazi Germany|German]] advance and [[Romanian Bridgehead]] could be created.\n[[File:Polish P-11 camouflaged in airfield 1939.jpg|thumb|left|A camouflaged Polish P-11 fighter at a combat airfield|alt=A photo of a Polish P-11 fighter covered in camouflage netting at an unidentified combat airfield]]\n\nThe Polish General Staff had not begun elaborating the \"West\" defence plan until 4 March 1939. It was assumed that the Polish Army, fighting in the initial phase of the war alone, would be compelled to defend the western regions of the country. The plan of operations took into account, first of all, the numerical and material superiority of the enemy and, consequently, assumed the defensive character of Polish operations. The Polish intentions were: defence of the western regions judged as indispensable for waging the war, taking advantage of the propitious conditions for counterattacks by reserve units, and avoidance of being smashed before the beginning of Franco/British operations in Western Europe. The [[operation plan|operational plan]] had not been elaborated in detail and concerned only the first stage of operations.<ref name=\"Wojna Obronna\" />\n\nThe British and French estimated that Poland would be able to defend itself for two to three months, while Poland estimated it could do so for at least six months. While Poland drafted its estimates based upon the expectation that the Western Allies would honor their treaty obligations and quickly start an offensive of their own, the French and British expected the war to develop into [[trench warfare]] much like World War I. The Polish government was not notified of this strategy and based all of its defence plans on promises of quick relief by their Western allies.<ref name=\"Pi\u0105tkowski\">{{cite book | author =Henryk Pi\u0105tkowski | title =Kampania wrze\u015bniowa 1939 roku w Polsce | year =1943 | page =39 | publisher =Sekcja Wydawnicza APW | location =Jerusalem | url =http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | accessdate =2 November 2011 | language =pl | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080209164014/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | archive-date =9 February 2008 | url-status =dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Raczy\u0144ski\">{{cite book | author=Count [[Edward Raczy\u0144ski (1891\u20131993)|Edward Raczy\u0144ski]] | title = The British-Polish Alliance; Its Origin and Meaning | year =1948 | publisher=Mellville Press | location = London }}</ref>\n\nPolish forces were stretched thinly along the Polish-German border and lacked compact defence lines and good defence positions along disadvantageous terrain. This strategy also left [[supply line]]s poorly protected. One-third of Poland's forces were massed in or near the Polish Corridor, making them vulnerable to a [[Pincer movement|double envelopment]] from East Prussia and the west. Another third were concentrated in the north-central part of the country, between the major cities of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and Warsaw.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 304\u2013310</ref> The forward positioning of Polish forces vastly increased the difficulty of carrying out strategic maneuvers, compounded by inadequate mobility, as Polish units often lacked the ability to retreat from their defensive positions as they were being overrun by more mobile German mechanized formations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n[[File:Peking.jpg|thumb|[[Peking Plan]]: Polish destroyers evacuate the Baltic Sea en route to the United Kingdom.|alt=Photo of three Polish destroyers executing the Peking Plan and evacuating to British before the start of the invasion.]]\n\nAs the prospect of conflict increased, the British government pressed Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz to evacuate the most modern elements of the Polish Navy from the Baltic Sea.<ref name=\"PN\" /> In the event of war the Polish military leaders realized that the ships which remained in the Baltic were likely to be quickly sunk by the Germans. Furthermore, the [[Danish straits]] were well within operating range of the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' and ''Luftwaffe'', so there was little chance of an evacuation plan succeeding if implemented after hostilities began. Four days after the signing of the Polish-British Common Defence Pact, three destroyers of the Polish Navy executed the Peking Plan and consequently evacuated to Great Britain.<ref name=\"PN\" />\n\nAlthough the Polish military had prepared for conflict, the civilian population remained largely unprepared. Polish pre-war [[propaganda]] emphasized that any German invasion would be easily repelled. Consequently, Polish defeats during the German invasion came as a shock to the civilian population.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Lacking training for such a disaster, the civilian population panicked and retreated east, spreading chaos, lowering troop morale and making road transportation for Polish troops very difficult.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> The propaganda also had some negative consequences for the Polish troops themselves, whose communications, disrupted by German mobile units operating in the rear and civilians blocking roads, were further thrown into chaos by bizarre reports from Polish radio stations and newspapers, which often reported imaginary victories and other military operations. This led to some Polish troops being encircled or taking a stand against overwhelming odds, when they thought they were actually counterattacking or would soon receive reinforcements from other victorious areas.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n=== Phase 1: German invasion ===\n[[File:Poland2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Map showing the advances made by the Germans, and the disposition of all troops from 1 to 14 September|alt=Map showing the advance made by the Germans, and the disposition of German and Polish troops on 14 September 1939.]]\n\nFollowing several German-staged incidents (like the Gleiwitz incident, a part of [[Operation Himmler]]), which German propaganda used as a [[pretext]] to claim that German forces were acting in [[self-defence]], one of the first acts of war took place on 1 September 1939. At 04:45, the old German [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] ''[[German battleship Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]]'' opened fire on the Polish military transit depot at [[Battle of Westerplatte|Westerplatte]] in the Free City of Danzig on the [[Baltic Sea]]. However, in many places German units crossed the Polish border even before 04.45. Around that time Luftwaffe attacked a number of military and civilian targets, including [[bombing of Wielu\u0144]], the first large scale city bombing of the war. At 08:00, German troops\u2014still without a formal declaration of war issued\u2014[[Battle of Mokra|attacked near the Polish village of Mokra]]. The [[Battle of the Border]] had begun. Later that day, the Germans attacked on Poland's western, southern and northern borders, while German aircraft began raids on Polish cities. The main axis of attack led eastwards from Germany through the western Polish border. Supporting attacks came from East Prussia in the north, and a joint German-Slovak tertiary attack by units ([[Field Army Bernol\u00e1k|Field Army \"Bernol\u00e1k\"]]) from the German-allied Slovak Republic in the south. All three assaults converged on the Polish capital of Warsaw.\n[[File:Zniszczenia1939 0.jpg|thumb|left|The city of [[Wielu\u0144]] destroyed by ''Luftwaffe'' bombing|alt=Aerial photo showing the city of Wielu\u0144, which was destroyed by ''Luftwaffe'' bombing on 1 September]]\n\nFrance and the UK declared war on Germany on 3 September, but [[Western betrayal|failed to provide any meaningful support]].

Despite some Polish successes in minor border battles, German technical, operational and numerical superiority forced the Polish armies to retreat from the borders towards Warsaw and [[Lw\u00f3w]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' gained [[air superiority]] early in the campaign. By destroying communications, the ''Luftwaffe'' increased the pace of the advance which overran Polish airstrips and early warning sites, causing logistical problems for the Poles.

At the same time, Guderian led his 3rd Army tanks across the Narew, attacking the line of the [[Bug River]], already encircling Warsaw.

The German troops left the area, and the Red Army troops entered Lviv on 22 September.\n\nThe Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop pact and the invasion of Poland marked the beginning of a period during which the government of the Soviet Union increasingly tried to convince itself that the actions of Germany were reasonable, and were not developments to be worried about, despite evidence to the contrary.<ref>Clark, Lloyd, ''Kursk: The greatest battle: Eastern Front 1943'', 2011, pp. 62, 67, 76\u201380</ref> On 7 September 1939, just a few days after France and Britain joined the war against Germany, Stalin explained to a colleague that the war was to the advantage of the Soviet Union, as follows:<ref name=\"Clark, Lloyd 2011, page 62\">Clark, Lloyd, ''Kursk: The greatest battle: Eastern Front 1943'', 2011, p. 62</ref>\n\n{{quote|A war is on between two groups of capitalist countries ... for the redivision of the world, for the domination of the world!

It would be months before Hitler would see the futility of his peace negotiation attempts with the United Kingdom and France, but the culmination of combined European and Pacific conflicts would result in what was truly a \"world war\". Thus, what was not seen by most politicians and generals in 1939 is clear from the historical perspective: The Polish September Campaign marked the beginning of a pan-European war, which combined with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] in 1937 and the [[Pacific War]] in 1941 to form the global conflict known as World War II.\n\nThe invasion of Poland led Britain and France to declare war on Germany on 3 September. However, they did little to affect the outcome of the September Campaign. No declaration of war was issued by Britain and France against the Soviet Union. This lack of direct help led many Poles to believe that they had been [[Western betrayal#Up to 1939|betrayed by their Western allies]]. Foreign Secretary [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Edward Wood]] said they were only obligated to declare war on Germany due to the first clause of the [[Anglo-Polish military alliance|Anglo-Polish Agreement]] in 1939.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sword|first=Keith Sword|date=1991|title=British Reactions to the Soviet Occupation of Eastern Poland in September 1939|url=|journal=The Slavonic and East European Review |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=81\u2013101|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe different attitude of the Anglo-French allies of Poland towards Nazi Germany and the USSR was argued at this time, for example, by the future head of the British government, Churchill:\n\n \"Russians were guilty of gross treachery during the recent negotiations, but Marshal Voroshilov's demand that the Russian armies, if they were allies of Poland, should occupy Vilnius and Lvov was a perfectly reasonable military demand. It was rejected by Poland, whose arguments, despite their naturalness, cannot be considered satisfactory in the light of current events. As a result, Russia took up the same positions as an enemy of Poland that it might have taken as a very dubious and suspected friend. The difference is actually not as great as it might seem. The Russians mobilized a very large force and showed that they were able to move quickly and far from their pre-war positions. They now border on Germany, and the latter is completely unable to expose the Eastern front. A large German army will have to be left behind to monitor it.

In 1939, only 10% of the Polish army was made up of cavalry units.<ref>Henryk Smaczny, ''Ksi\u0119ga kawalerii polskiej'' (\"Book of Polish cavalry\"), TESCO, Warszawa 1989, {{ISBN|83-00-02555-3}}</ref> [[Polish cavalry]] never charged German tanks or entrenched infantry or artillery, but usually acted as [[Mounted infantry|mobile infantry]] (like [[dragoon]]s) and reconnaissance units, and executed cavalry charges only in rare situations against foot soldiers. Most of these charges were successful.<ref name=\"Kawaleria\">{{cite web | author=Marcin Lewandowski | title=Szar\u017ce we wrze\u015bniu 1939 (Cavalry charges in September 1939) | publisher= | year=2005 | work=Kawaleria II RP | url=http://www.kawaleria.marcin-lewandowski.xip.pl/szarze.php | accessdate=2006-04-26 |language=pl}}</ref> Other armies (including German and Soviet) also fielded and extensively used elite horse cavalry units at that time. The last cavalry-vs-cavalry battle in Europe was fought between German and Polish cavalries ([[Battle of Krasnobr\u00f3d (1939)]]). Polish cavalry consisted of 11 [[brigade]]s, equipped with [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35|\"UR\" anti-tank rifles]] and light artillery such as the highly effective [[Bofors 37 mm]] anti-tank gun. The myth originated from war correspondents' reports similar to that of the [[Charge at Krojanty|Battle of Krojanty]], where a Polish cavalry brigade was fired upon in ambush by hidden armored vehicles, after it had mounted a successful sabre-charge against German infantry. There were also cases when Polish cavalry dashing between tanks trying to break out of encirclement gave an impression of an attack.<ref group=\"Note\">Seidner takes issue here with this contention on at least one occasion. Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland''</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polamjournal.com/Library/APHistory/Cavalry_Myth/cavalry_myth.html|title=Cavalry Myth}}</ref>\n\n=== Polish Air Force ===\nThe [[Polish Air Force order of battle in 1939|Polish Air Force]] was not destroyed on the ground in the first days of the war. Though numerically inferior, it had been redeployed from major air bases to small camouflaged airfields shortly before the war. Only some [[trainer aircraft|trainers]] and auxiliary aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The Polish Air Force, despite being significantly outnumbered and with its fighters outmatched by more advanced German fighters, remained active until the second week of the campaign, inflicting significant damage on the ''Luftwaffe''.<ref>Steven J. Zaloga, Ramiro Bujeiro, Howard Gerrard, ''Poland 1939: the birth of blitzkrieg'', Osprey Publishing, 2002, {{ISBN|1-84176-408-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oQeAKAjlEwMC&pg=PA50&dq=Polish+airforce+1939+ground Google Print, p.50]</ref> The ''Luftwaffe'' lost 285 aircraft to all operational causes, with 279 more damaged, and the Poles lost 333 aircraft.<ref>Overy, Richard J., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uocntt1lGDUC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28 ''The Air War: 1939\u20131945''], London, Europa Publications, 1980. p. 28</ref>\n\n=== Polish resistance to the invasion ===\nAnother question concerns whether Poland inflicted any significant losses on the German forces and whether it surrendered too quickly. In the first few days, Germany sustained very heavy losses: Poland cost the Germans 993 tanks and armored vehicles as campaign losses of which 300 tanks were never recovered,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.achtungpanzer.com/invasion-of-poland-fall-weiss.htm|title=Invasion of Poland \u2013 Fall Weiss|website=achtungpanzer.com}}</ref><ref>''Encyklopedia II wojny \u015bwiatowej'', p. 670</ref> thousands of soldiers, and 25% of its air strength.<ref>Bekker, Cajus (1964) ''Angriffshohe'' 285 aircraft destroyed, 279 damaged of initial force</ref> As for duration, the September Campaign lasted about a week and a half less than the [[Battle of France]] in 1940 even though the Anglo-French forces were much closer to parity with the Germans in numerical strength and equipment and were supported by the [[Maginot line]].<ref group=\"Note\" name=\"FrenchForces\">Polish to German forces in the September Campaign: 1,000,000 soldiers, 4,300 guns, 880 tanks, 435 aircraft (Poland) to 1,800,000 soldiers, 10,000 guns, 2,800 tanks, 3,000 aircraft (Germany). French and participating Allies to German forces in the Battle of France: 2,862,000 soldiers, 13,974 guns, 3,384 tanks, 3,099 aircraft 2 (Allies) to 3,350,000 soldiers, 7,378 guns, 2,445 tanks, 5,446 aircraft (Germany).</ref> Furthermore, the Polish Army was preparing the [[Romanian Bridgehead]], which would have prolonged Polish defence, but the plan was invalidated by the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September 1939.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', ch. 3</ref> Poland also never officially surrendered to the Germans. Under German occupation, there was continued resistance by forces such as the ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'', [[Henryk Dobrza\u0144ski]]'s guerillas, and the [[Le\u015bni]] (\"forest partisans\").\n\n[[File:Defenders of Warsaw (1939).jpg|thumb|[[Polish Army|Polish soldiers]] with anti-aircraft artillery near the Warsaw Central Station in the first days of September 1939.]]\n[[File:American Embassy in Warsaw 1939.jpg|thumb|American embassy in Warsaw during the German air raid in September 1939. Visible shattered window.]]\n\n=== First use of ''Blitzkrieg'' strategy ===\nIt is often assumed that '' Blitzkrieg'' is the strategy that Germany first used in Poland. Many early post-war histories, such as Barrie Pitt's in ''The Second World War'' (BPC Publishing 1966), attribute German victory to \"enormous development in military technique which occurred between 1918 and 1940\", and cite that \"Germany, who translated (British inter-war) theories into action... called the result ''Blitzkrieg''\". That idea has been repudiated by some authors. Matthew Cooper writes:\n\n{{quote|\"Throughout the Polish Campaign, the employment of the mechanized units revealed the idea that they were intended solely to ease the advance and to support the activities of the infantry.... Thus, any strategic exploitation of the armoured idea was still-born. The paralysis of command and the breakdown of morale were not made the ultimate aim of the{{nbs}}... German ground and air forces, and were only incidental by-products of the traditional manoeuvers of rapid encirclement and of the supporting activities of the flying artillery of the ''Luftwaffe'', both of which had as their purpose the physical destruction of the enemy troops. Such was the ''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' of the Polish campaign.\" \u2013 Cooper<ref name=\"Cooper176\" />|sign=|source=}}\n\n''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' was a strategy dating back to [[Frederick the Great]], and it was applied in the Polish Campaign, little changed from the [[Franco-Prussian War|French campaigns in 1870]] or 1914. The use of [[tank]]s\n\n{{quote|...left much to be desired... Fear of enemy action against the flanks of the advance, fear which was to prove so disastrous to German prospects in the west in 1940 and in the Soviet Union in 1941, was present from the beginning of the war. \u2013 Cooper<ref name=Cooper0 />}}\n\nJohn Ellis, writing in ''[[Brute Force (book)|Brute Force]]'', asserted that\n\n{{quote|...there is considerable justice in Matthew Cooper's assertion that the ''panzer'' divisions were not given the kind of ''strategic'' mission that was to characterize authentic armoured ''blitzkrieg'', and were almost always closely subordinated to the various mass infantry armies. \u2013 Ellis<ref>Ellis, John (1999). ''Brute Force: Allied Strategy and Tactics in the Second World War'', pp. 3\u20134</ref> (emphasis in original)}}\n\nZaloga and Madej, in ''The Polish Campaign 1939'', also address the subject of mythical interpretations of ''Blitzkrieg'' and the importance of other arms in the campaign. Western accounts of the September campaign have stressed the shock value of the ''panzers'' and ''Stuka'' attacks, they have\n\n{{quote|...tended to underestimate the punishing effect of German artillery on Polish units. Mobile and available in significant quantity, artillery shattered as many units as any other branch of the ''Wehrmacht''. \u2013 Zaloga and Madej<ref name=\"Cooper4\" />}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Eastern Front (World War II)]]\n* [[Polish resistance movement in World War II]]\n* [[History of Poland (1939\u20131945)]]\n* [[Horses in World War II]]\n* [[List of Polish divisions in World War II]]\n* [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)]]\n* [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]]\n* [[Phoney War]]\n* [[Polish cavalry brigade order of battle in 1939]]\n* [[Polish contribution to World War II]]\n* [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)]]\n* [[Timeline of the invasion of Poland]]\n* [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht]]\n* [[Western betrayal]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n== References ==\n<!--This article uses the Cite.php citation mechanism.
