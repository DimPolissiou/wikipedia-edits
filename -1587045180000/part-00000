The city is located on the [[San Joaquin River]] in the northern [[San Joaquin Valley]] and had an estimated population of 311,178 by the California Department of Finance for 2018. Stockton is the [[List of largest California cities by population|13th]] largest city in California and the [[List of United States cities by population|61st]] largest city in the United States. It was named an [[All-America City Award|All-America City]] in 1999, 2004, 2015 and again in 2017.\n\nBuilt during the [[California Gold Rush]], Stockton's seaport serves as a gateway to the Central Valley and beyond. It provided easy access for trade and transportation to the southern gold mines. The [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]] (UOP), chartered in 1851, is the oldest university in California, and has been located in Stockton since 1923. In 2012 Stockton filed for what was then the largest municipal [[bankruptcy]] in US history, which had multiple causes including financial mismanagement in the 1990s and the [[Great Recession|2008 financial crisis]]. Stockton successfully exited bankruptcy in February 2015.\n\n==Geography==\n\nStockton is situated amidst the [[Arable land|farmland]] of California's [[San Joaquin Valley]], a subregion of the [[California Central Valley|Central Valley]]. In and around Stockton are thousands of miles of [[waterways]], which make up the [[California Delta]].\n\n[[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] and [[California State Route 99|State Route 99]], inland California's major north-south highways, pass through the city. [[California State Route 4|State Route 4]] and the dredged [[San Joaquin River]] connect the city with the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] to its west, creating the [[Stockton Deepwater Shipping Channel]]. Stockton and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] are California's only [[Inland port|inland sea ports]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city occupies a total area of {{convert|64.8|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|61.7|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|3.1|sqmi}} (4.76%) is water.\n\n==History==\n\nWhen Europeans first visited the Stockton area, it was occupied by the Yatchicumne, a branch of the Northern Valley [[Yokuts people|Yokuts Indians]]. They built their villages on low mounds to keep their homes above regular floods.  A Yokuts village named Pasasimas was located on a mound between Edison and Harrison Streets on what is now the [[Stockton Channel]] in downtown Stockton.<ref name=\"historycity\">{{cite web|title=History A Look into Stockton's Past Before the Gold Rush|url=http://www.stocktongov.com/discover/history/hist.html|publisher=City of Stockton|accessdate=21 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Siskiyou Trail]] began in the northern [[San Joaquin Valley]]. It was a centuries-old Native American footpath that led through the [[Sacramento Valley]] over the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] and into present-day [[Oregon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/592072|title=Archaeological Investigations of the Siskiyou Trail Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument Jackson County|access-date=2016-07-16}}</ref>\n\nThe extensive network of waterways in and around Stockton was fished and navigated by [[Plains and Sierra Miwok|Miwok Indians]] for centuries. During the [[California Gold Rush]], the [[San Joaquin River]] was navigable by ocean-going vessels, making Stockton a natural inland seaport and point of supply and departure for prospective gold-miners. From the mid-19th century onward, Stockton became the region's transportation hub, dealing mainly with agricultural products.\n\n===19th century===\n\n; Mexican era\n\nCapt. [[Charles Maria Weber]], a German, emigrated to America in 1836 (originally named Karl, he changed his name to Charles shortly after his arrival). After spending time in [[Texas]], he came overland from Missouri to California with the [[Bartleson-Bidwell Party]] in 1841. Weber went to work for [[John Sutter]], who vouched for \"Carlos Maria Weber\" to Mexican authorities. In 1842 Weber settled in the [[Pueblo of San Jos\u00e9]].\n\nAs an alien, Weber could not secure a land grant directly, so he formed a partnership with Guillermo (William) Gulnac. Born in New York, Gulnac had married a Mexican woman and sworn allegiance to [[Mexico]], which then ruled California. He applied in Weber's place for [[Rancho Campo de los Franceses]], a land grant of 11 square [[league (unit)|leagues]] on the east side of the San Joaquin River.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/GR_4157|title=A History of Stockton from Its Organization up to the Present Time | first=George Henry|last=Tinkham |year=1880|page=[https://archive.org/details/GR_4157/page/n430 397] |publisher=W.M. Hinton & Co.}}</ref>\n\nGulnac and Weber dissolved their partnership in 1843. Gulnac's attempts to settle the Rancho Campo de los Franceses failed, and Weber acquired it in 1845. In 1846 Weber had induced a number of settlers to locate on the rancho, when the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] broke out.  Considered a Californio, Weber was offered the position of captain by Mexican Gen. [[Jos\u00e9 Castro]], which he declined; he later, however, accepted the position of captain in the Cavalry of the United States. Capt. Weber's decision to change sides lost him a great deal of the trust he had built up among his Mexican business partners. As a result, he moved to the grant in 1847 and sold his business in San Jose in 1849.\n\n; Gold rush era\n\nAt the start of the [[California Gold Rush]] in 1848, Europeans and Americans started to arrive in the area of Weber's rancho on their way to the goldfields. When Weber decided to try his hand at gold mining in late 1848, he soon found selling supplies to [[California Gold Rush|gold-seekers]] was more profitable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.stockton.ca.us/Awards/WeberAward.cfm |title=Captain Charles M.

Weber built the first permanent residence in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] on a piece of land now known as Weber Point.<ref name=\"historycity\"/>  During the Gold Rush, the location of what is now Stockton developed as a river port, the hub of roads to the gold settlements in the San Joaquin Valley and northern terminus of the [[Stockton - Los Angeles Road]].

After the gold rush, many worked for the railroads and land reclamation projects in the [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta]] and remained in Stockton. By 1880 Stockton was home to the third-largest Chinese community in California. Discriminatory laws, in particular the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882, restricted immigration and prevented the Chinese from buying property.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/ugly-legacy-latino-couple-finds-racist-covenant-housing-paperwork-n1082476|title=An ugly legacy: Latino couple finds racist covenant in housing paperwork|last=Aviles|first=Gwen|date=November 15, 2019|work=NBC News|language=en|access-date=2019-11-16|quote=No persons other than those wholly of the white Caucasian race shall use, occupy or reside upon any part of or within any building located on the above described real property, except servants or domestics of another race employed by or domiciled with a white Caucasian owner or tenant,}}</ref> The Lincoln Hotel, built in 1920 by the Wong brothers on South El Dorado Street, was considered one of Stockton's finest hotels of the time.

In 1851 the City of Stockton received its charter from the State of California. Early settlers included gold seekers from Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, the Pacific Islands, Mexico and Canada. The historical population diversity is reflected in Stockton street names, architecture, numerous ethnic festivals and the faces and heritage of a majority of its citizens. In 1870 the Census Bureau reported Stockton's population as 87.6% white and 10.7% Asian.

The first chief of police was City Marshal W. W. Willoughby.  The city marshal was authorized to hire no more than 20 men as day and night policemen. He was required to structure his department with a police captain, an assistant captain and two sergeants.  The first station house was located on the corner of Center Street and Market Street.  In February 1861, the city council created the position of Chief of Police.  His annual salary was $900 and the chief would be elected by the public.  On May 6, 1862, George E. Taber was elected the first Chief of Police for the city of Stockton.\n\nIn 1886 Stockton police officers were required to wear blue uniforms and a six-point star badge. In October 1889 a new uniform was decided upon by the chief.  The uniform frock coat worn by Oakland police officers was cost around $50 or $60 each.  The San Francisco style star was chosen as the badge and was made of silver.  Each badge cost $5.\n\nBy 1907 the department had grown to 18 members, which included the chief, officers and clerks.  The population was around 25,000 and the police department handled about 600 cases per year.  In 1908 the chief required all police officers to appear for a day of field efficiency testing; this included each officer running 100 yards and a 50-yard revolver practice.\n\n; Modern history\n\nOn March 1, 2012, Eric Jones was sworn in as chief of police.

The city is located on the [[San Joaquin River]] in the northern [[San Joaquin Valley]] and had an estimated population of 311,178 by the California Department of Finance for 2018. Stockton is the [[List of largest California cities by population|13th]] largest city in California and the [[List of United States cities by population|61st]] largest city in the United States. It was named an [[All-America City Award|All-America City]] in 1999, 2004, 2015 and again in 2017.\n\nBuilt during the [[California Gold Rush]], Stockton's seaport serves as a gateway to the Central Valley and beyond. It provided easy access for trade and transportation to the southern gold mines. The [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]] (UOP), chartered in 1851, is the oldest university in California, and has been located in Stockton since 1923. In 2012 Stockton filed for what was then the largest municipal [[bankruptcy]] in US history, which had multiple causes including financial mismanagement in the 1990s, generous [[fringe benefits]] to unionized city employees,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-stockton-bankruptcy-cause-idUSBRE8621DL20120703|title=How Stockton went broke: A 15-year spending binge|date=2012-07-03|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-11-16|language=en}}</ref> and the [[Great Recession|2008 financial crisis]]. Stockton successfully exited bankruptcy in February 2015.\n\n==Geography==\n\nStockton is situated amidst the [[Arable land|farmland]] of California's [[San Joaquin Valley]], a subregion of the [[California Central Valley|Central Valley]]. In and around Stockton are thousands of miles of [[waterways]], which make up the [[California Delta]].\n\n[[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] and [[California State Route 99|State Route 99]], inland California's major north-south highways, pass through the city. [[California State Route 4|State Route 4]] and the dredged [[San Joaquin River]] connect the city with the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] to its west, creating the [[Stockton Deepwater Shipping Channel]]. Stockton and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] are California's only [[Inland port|inland sea ports]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city occupies a total area of {{convert|64.8|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|61.7|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|3.1|sqmi}} (4.76%) is water.\n\n==History==\n\nWhen Europeans first visited the Stockton area, it was occupied by the Yatchicumne, a branch of the Northern Valley [[Yokuts people|Yokuts Indians]]. They built their villages on low mounds to keep their homes above regular floods.  A Yokuts village named Pasasimas was located on a mound between Edison and Harrison Streets on what is now the [[Stockton Channel]] in downtown Stockton.<ref name=\"historycity\">{{cite web|title=History A Look into Stockton's Past Before the Gold Rush|url=http://www.stocktongov.com/discover/history/hist.html|publisher=City of Stockton|accessdate=21 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Siskiyou Trail]] began in the northern [[San Joaquin Valley]]. It was a centuries-old Native American footpath that led through the [[Sacramento Valley]] over the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] and into present-day [[Oregon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/592072|title=Archaeological Investigations of the Siskiyou Trail Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument Jackson County|access-date=2016-07-16}}</ref>\n\nThe extensive network of waterways in and around Stockton was fished and navigated by [[Plains and Sierra Miwok|Miwok Indians]] for centuries. During the [[California Gold Rush]], the [[San Joaquin River]] was navigable by ocean-going vessels, making Stockton a natural inland seaport and point of supply and departure for prospective gold-miners. From the mid-19th century onward, Stockton became the region's transportation hub, dealing mainly with agricultural products.\n\n===19th century===\n\n; Mexican era\n\nCapt. [[Charles Maria Weber]], a German, emigrated to America in 1836 (originally named Karl, he changed his name to Charles shortly after his arrival). After spending time in [[Texas]], he came overland from Missouri to California with the [[Bartleson-Bidwell Party]] in 1841. Weber went to work for [[John Sutter]], who vouched for \"Carlos Maria Weber\" to Mexican authorities. In 1842 Weber settled in the [[Pueblo of San Jos\u00e9]].\n\nAs an alien, Weber could not secure a land grant directly, so he formed a partnership with Guillermo (William) Gulnac. Born in New York, Gulnac had married a Mexican woman and sworn allegiance to [[Mexico]], which then ruled California. He applied in Weber's place for [[Rancho Campo de los Franceses]], a land grant of 11 square [[league (unit)|leagues]] on the east side of the San Joaquin River.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/GR_4157|title=A History of Stockton from Its Organization up to the Present Time | first=George Henry|last=Tinkham |year=1880|page=[https://archive.org/details/GR_4157/page/n430 397] |publisher=W.M. Hinton & Co.}}</ref>\n\nGulnac and Weber dissolved their partnership in 1843. Gulnac's attempts to settle the Rancho Campo de los Franceses failed, and Weber acquired it in 1845. In 1846 Weber had induced a number of settlers to locate on the rancho, when the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] broke out.  Considered a Californio, Weber was offered the position of captain by Mexican Gen. [[Jos\u00e9 Castro]], which he declined; he later, however, accepted the position of captain in the Cavalry of the United States. Capt. Weber's decision to change sides lost him a great deal of the trust he had built up among his Mexican business partners. As a result, he moved to the grant in 1847 and sold his business in San Jose in 1849.\n\n; Gold rush era\n\nAt the start of the [[California Gold Rush]] in 1848, Europeans and Americans started to arrive in the area of Weber's rancho on their way to the goldfields. When Weber decided to try his hand at gold mining in late 1848, he soon found selling supplies to [[California Gold Rush|gold-seekers]] was more profitable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.stockton.ca.us/Awards/WeberAward.cfm |title=Captain Charles M.

Weber built the first permanent residence in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] on a piece of land now known as Weber Point.<ref name=\"historycity\"/>  During the Gold Rush, the location of what is now Stockton developed as a river port, the hub of roads to the gold settlements in the San Joaquin Valley and northern terminus of the [[Stockton - Los Angeles Road]]. During its early years, Stockton was known by several names, including \"Weberville,\" \"Fat City,\" \"Mudville\" and \"California's Sunrise Seaport.\"<ref name=\"uopabout\">{{cite web|title=About Stockton|url=http://www.pacific.edu/About-Pacific/General-Questions/About-Stockton.html|website=www.pacific.edu|publisher=University of the Pacific|accessdate=31 October 2016}}</ref>  In 1849 Weber laid out a town, which he named \"Tuleburg,\" but he soon decided on \"Stockton\" in honor of [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Robert F.

After the gold rush, many worked for the railroads and land reclamation projects in the [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta]] and remained in Stockton.

The first chief of police was City Marshal W. W. Willoughby.  The city marshal was authorized to hire no more than 20 men as day and night policemen. He was required to structure his department with a police captain, an assistant captain and two sergeants.  The first station house was located on the corner of Center Street and Market Street.  In February 1861, the city council created the position of Chief of Police.  His annual salary was $900 and the chief would be elected by the public.  On May 6, 1862, George E. Taber was elected the first Chief of Police for the city of Stockton.\n\nIn 1886 Stockton police officers were required to wear blue uniforms and a six-point star badge. In October 1889 a new uniform was decided upon by the chief.  The uniform frock coat worn by Oakland police officers was cost around $50 or $60 each.  The San Francisco style star was chosen as the badge and was made of silver.  Each badge cost $5.\n\nBy 1907 the department had grown to 18 members, which included the chief, officers and clerks.  The population was around 25,000 and the police department handled about 600 cases per year.  In 1908 the chief required all police officers to appear for a day of field efficiency testing; this included each officer running 100 yards and a 50-yard revolver practice.\n\n; Modern history\n\nOn March 1, 2012, Eric Jones was sworn in as chief of police.
