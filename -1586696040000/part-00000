It also reached number one in Germany and the Netherlands and Top 10 positions in various other countries including Australia, Switzerland, New Zealand and Italy.

She'd been tortured incredibly by her mother as a child and the only place she felt safe, the only time she could really be herself was when she was sitting in her analyst's chair. She felt safe, comfortable and wasn't using her different faces as a defence. It's kind of an 'up yours' to the English music press who really fucked us up for a while.

The album peaked at number two in the UK and at number one in the US and Canada, becoming a multi-platinum seller in all three countries. It also reached number one in Germany and the Netherlands and Top 10 positions in various other countries including Australia, Switzerland, New Zealand and Italy. It spawned the international hit singles \"[[Mothers Talk]]\", \"[[Shout (Tears for Fears song)|Shout]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants to Rule the World]]\", \"[[Head over Heels (Tears for Fears song)|Head over Heels]]\", and \"[[I Believe (Tears for Fears song)|I Believe]]\". It remains their best-selling album to date.\n\nA companion video documentary entitled ''[[Scenes from the Big Chair]]'' was released in late 1985. Once the band had finished a lengthy touring and promotion schedule for the album, they took an extended hiatus from the music industry.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Quote box\n| quote=\"The title was my idea. It's a bit perverse but then you've got to understand our sense of humour. The 'Big Chair' idea is from this brilliant film called ''Sybil'' about a girl with 16 different personalities. She'd been tortured incredibly by her mother as a child and the only place she felt safe, the only time she could really be herself was when she was sitting in her analyst's chair. She felt safe, comfortable and wasn't using her different faces as a defence. It's kind of an 'up yours' to the English music press who really fucked us up for a while.

While walking through the hospital one night he overhears another janitor, Frakel, telling a patient that he's a doctor and needs to give her a physical examination, in order to rape her. After hearing this, Jay knocks out Frakel and tells the patient, Daisy Kensington, to go back to bed. Daisy, having been admitted to the hospital for being raised in isolation her entire life and hearing voices as well as being barefoot all her life, decides to follow Jay out of the hospital.\n\nRather than send Daisy back into the hospital, Jay decides to bring her home for his brother's wedding to convince his family that he has finally straightened out his life. While she impresses the family with her genuine, if unstable, charm, she also admits to Jay that she was in the hospital for killing her mother. While at the wedding Jay's father, suspecting that something is amiss, presses her for information, causing Daisy to have a panic attack. As Jay gets her into a cab, surrounded by his family, he tells them truth of who she is and that he is a janitor at the psychiatric hospital, only having come home to get money to pay back a loan shark. When Jay and Daisy return to his parents' house they search through his father's cars for keys and find a set in a classic RV, in which they set out for home. Despite getting along while driving Jay leaves Daisy at a bus station in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], intending to abandon her, but ends up having a change of heart and goes back for her.\n\nTheir journey becomes a fun adventure, despite the fact that they are both being hunted; Daisy for escaping the hospital and Jay for taking her and violating his probation. As Jay is the only one who can drive they pull over so he can sleep. During the night Daisy wakes him up due to a cop having pulled up behind. While Jay hides in the cupboard Daisy tells the cop that her boyfriend, \"Beaver,\" ran away when he saw the flashing lights. The cop tells her that his father's name was Beaver, before proceeding to check the RV. After checking the bathroom, which smells bad because they can't flush it, he leaves and walks into the bush on the side of the road to find \"Beaver\". While the cop is distracted Daisy throws away the keys to his car, so that she and Jay can escape, causing Jay to see her in a different light. A few nights later they go to a carnival, which Daisy has never been to before, claiming that it is \"the best day of her life.\"\n\nLater when they make a stopover, Jay makes a phone call to Dr. Bertleman, the doctor who was handling Daisy. She then overhears him say that he is going to take her back to Los Angeles only to bring her back to the psychiatric hospital. She runs away crying to the RV alone and attempts to drive away before Jay can get to her. As she only know the basics that Jay taught her she ends up driving around the parking lot in circles before crashing the RV. As Jay opens the door, she climbs out crying, as other people come to check on them. Jay then hurries them both into a diner. Jay, curious about Daisy, not truly believing she's schizophrenic as her doctor believes, asks her about whether the voices told her to kill her mother. Daisy tells him that it wasn't her who heard voices, but her mother. Her mother was screaming one night but Daisy didn't go to her, and when she woke up in the morning her mother was dead, causing Daisy to believe that she killed her mother. As Jay vehemently tells Daisy that she didn't kill her mother, a group of cop cars show up at the diner to arrest Jay and Daisy, assuming that one of the bystanders to the crash called them. As Jay kisses Daisy, the cops come into the diner and handcuff Jay, separating him and Daisy.\n\nWhen Jay's mother finds out he's in jail, she persuades his father to bail him out, which he does. When Jay returns to his apartment, he finds the door smashed open and his belongings torn apart. Glancing out the window he sees one of the loan sharks goons waiting for him outside, just as the loan shark looks up and sees him. After fleeing his apartment complex Jay goes to psychiatric hospital to see Daisy, but the security and Dr. Bertleman tell him to leave.\n\nDesperate, Jay goes to the train station and lies down on the tracks, so that he'll be deemed suicidal and be taken to the psychiatric hospital. Dr. Bertleman, knowing that Jay is fine and that it was just a ruse, dismisses Jay, but after Jay insists that he is suicidal, the doctor puts him in solitary confinement. Before Jay is taken away he tells the doctor that it wasn't Daisy who heard voices but her mother. While at the hospital another patient gives Jay information on Daisy's well-being and confirms that they're being kept apart.\n\nThat night Frakel sneaks the loan shark's goon into the hospital, where he then goes and strangles Jay using a chain. As Jay is struggling to get him off, the patient who was giving him information takes out the goon by hitting him in the head with a broom. After this Jay wakes up in the hospital, where Dr. Bertleman apologizes to Jay about Frakel and tells him he was right about Daisy's mother, who was a diagnosed schizophrenic. Dr. Bertleman then decides to release both Jay and Daisy from the hospital. Before Jay goes to meet Daisy he gets a letter from his father, which contains a check for $40,000 in order to pay off his debts. Jay then meets Daisy at the entrance to the hospital, where the two share a hug and kiss before leaving together, hand in hand.\n\nAs the credits start to roll, the last scene shows Daisy and Jay riding a merry-go-round.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Daisy Kensington\n*[[Scott Speedman]] as Jay Wheeler\n*[[Treat Williams]] as Mr. Wheeler\n*[[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]] as Mrs. Wheeler\n*[[J.

After hearing this, Jay knocks out Frakel and tells the patient, Daisy Kensington, to go back to bed. Daisy, having been admitted to the hospital for being raised in isolation her entire life and hearing voices as well as being barefoot all her life, decides to follow Jay out of the hospital.\n\nRather than send Daisy back into the hospital, Jay decides to bring her home for his brother's wedding to convince his family that he has finally straightened out his life. While she impresses the family with her genuine, if unstable, charm, she also admits to Jay that she was in the hospital for killing her mother. While at the wedding Jay's father, suspecting that something is amiss, presses her for information, causing Daisy to have a panic attack. As Jay gets her into a cab, surrounded by his family, he tells them truth of who she is and that he is a janitor at the psychiatric hospital, only having come home to get money to pay back a loan shark. When Jay and Daisy return to his parents' house they search through his father's cars for keys and find a set in a classic RV, in which they set out for home. Despite getting along while driving Jay leaves Daisy at a bus station in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], intending to abandon her, but ends up having a change of heart and goes back for her.\n\nTheir journey becomes a fun adventure, despite the fact that they are both being hunted; Daisy for escaping the hospital and Jay for taking her and violating his probation. As Jay is the only one who can drive they pull over so he can sleep. During the night Daisy wakes him up due to a cop having pulled up behind. While Jay hides in the cupboard Daisy tells the cop that her boyfriend, \"Beaver,\" ran away when he saw the flashing lights. The cop tells her that his father's name was Beaver, before proceeding to check the RV. After checking the bathroom, which smells bad because they can't flush it, he leaves and walks into the bush on the side of the road to find \"Beaver\". While the cop is distracted Daisy throws away the keys to his car, so that she and Jay can escape, causing Jay to see her in a different light. A few nights later they go to a carnival, which Daisy has never been to before, claiming that it is \"the best day of her life.\"\n\nLater when they make a stopover, Jay makes a phone call to Dr. Bertleman, the doctor who was handling Daisy. She then overhears him say that he is going to take her back to Los Angeles only to bring her back to the psychiatric hospital. She runs away crying to the RV alone and attempts to drive away before Jay can get to her. As she only know the basics that Jay taught her she ends up driving around the parking lot in circles before crashing the RV. As Jay opens the door, she climbs out crying, as other people come to check on them. Jay then hurries them both into a diner. Jay, curious about Daisy, not truly believing she's schizophrenic as her doctor believes, asks her about whether the voices told her to kill her mother. Daisy tells him that it wasn't her who heard voices, but her mother. Her mother was screaming one night but Daisy didn't go to her, and when she woke up in the morning her mother was dead, causing Daisy to believe that she killed her mother. As Jay vehemently tells Daisy that she didn't kill her mother, a group of cop cars show up at the diner to arrest Jay and Daisy, assuming that one of the bystanders to the crash called them. As Jay kisses Daisy, the cops come into the diner and handcuff Jay, separating him and Daisy.\n\nWhen Jay's mother finds out he's in jail, she persuades his father to bail him out, which he does. When Jay returns to his apartment, he finds the door smashed open and his belongings torn apart. Glancing out the window he sees one of the loan sharks goons waiting for him outside, just as the loan shark looks up and sees him. After fleeing his apartment complex Jay goes to psychiatric hospital to see Daisy, but the security and Dr. Bertleman tell him to leave.\n\nDesperate, Jay goes to the train station and lies down on the tracks, so that he'll be deemed suicidal and be taken to the psychiatric hospital. Dr. Bertleman, knowing that Jay is fine and that it was just a ruse, dismisses Jay, but after Jay insists that he is suicidal, the doctor puts him in solitary confinement. Before Jay is taken away he tells the doctor that it wasn't Daisy who heard voices but her mother. While at the hospital another patient gives Jay information on Daisy's well-being and confirms that they're being kept apart.\n\nThat night Frakel sneaks the loan shark's goon into the hospital, where he then goes and strangles Jay using a chain. As Jay is struggling to get him off, the patient who was giving him information takes out the goon by hitting him in the head with a broom. After this Jay wakes up in the hospital, where Dr. Bertleman apologizes to Jay about Frakel and tells him he was right about Daisy's mother, who was a diagnosed schizophrenic. Dr. Bertleman then decides to release both Jay and Daisy from the hospital. Before Jay goes to meet Daisy he gets a letter from his father, which contains a check for $40,000 in order to pay off his debts. Jay then meets Daisy at the entrance to the hospital, where the two share a hug and kiss before leaving together, hand in hand.\n\nAs the credits start to roll, the last scene shows Daisy and Jay riding a merry-go-round.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Daisy Kensington\n*[[Scott Speedman]] as Jay Wheeler\n*[[Treat Williams]] as Mr. Wheeler\n*[[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]] as Mrs. Wheeler\n*[[J.

Marshall]]<nowiki/> so that Holt could be a horse buyer for the [[United States Cavalry]].\n\n==Film career==\n[[File:Lila Lee Jack Holt 1921.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lila Lee]] is embraced by Holt in a publicity still for [[William C. deMille]]'s 1921 silent drama ''After the Show''.]]\nHolt began in [[Hollywood]] with [[Stunt performer|stunt]] work and [[Bit player|bit]] parts in [[Serial film|serials]] and at [[Universal Pictures]] worked as a supporting player for [[Francis Ford (actor)|Francis Ford]] and his brother [[John Ford]], and [[Grace Cunard]].\n\nIn his film debut, Holt rode a horse down a steep embankment into the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]] in a scene for [[Salomy Jane (1914 film)|''Salomy Jane'']]. The stunt cracked some of Holt's ribs and injured the horse so badly that it had to be destroyed. The film, which was considered lost for years, was included in the DVD released 2011 anthology ''Treasures 5 The West 1898\u20141938'' by the [[National Film Preservation Foundation]] after a print was discovered in Australia.<ref name=\"w\" />\n\nJack Holt, with his dapper mustache, prominent jaw, and quick-with-his-fists manner, personified [[Masculinity|rugged masculinity]]. Holt became [[Columbia Pictures]]' most reliable [[leading man]], and scored personal successes in three [[Frank Capra]] action dramas:  ''[[Submarine (1928 film)|Submarine]]'' (1928), ''[[Flight (1929 film)|Flight]]'' (1929) and ''[[Dirigible (film)|Dirigible]]'' (1931). Holt's no-nonsense characterizations were eclipsed by younger, tough-talking actors like [[James Cagney]] and [[Chester Morris]], although he was still entrusted with tough-guy-with-a-heart-of-gold leads. Two mid-1930s features, ''[[Whirlpool]]'' and ''[[The Defense Rests]]'', starred Holt opposite up-and-coming ingenue [[Jean Arthur]].\n\nExhibitors had come to associate Jack Holt with rough-and-tumble action, and so Holt continued to work in low-budget crime dramas (mostly for Columbia) through 1940. The series came to an end when he argued with studio chief [[Harry Cohn]]. Cohn thought the actor so arrogant that he assigned Holt the leading role in a lowbrow 15-chapter [[Serial film|serial]], ''[[Holt of the Secret Service]]'' (1941). Holt \u2014 the star of longest standing with the studio \u2014 was insulted by Cohn's demotion and, although he turned in a professional performance in the serial, he walked out on both Cohn and Columbia.\n\n[[File:Jack Holt-Seena Owen in Victory.jpg|thumb|right|Jack Holt and Seena Owen in ''Victory'']]Holt began freelancing at other studios, frequently appearing in outdoor and western fare. He would become an enduring member of the cowboy fraternity through ''[[Trail of Robin Hood]]'' (1950), a [[Roy Rogers]] western with guest appearances by Holt, [[Allan Lane]], [[Tom Keene (actor)|Tom Keene]], [[Tom Tyler]], [[Kermit Maynard]], and [[Rex Allen]].\n\nJack Holt's children established their own film careers. [[Tim Holt]] succeeded [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] as the star of [[RKO Radio Pictures]]' \"B\" westerns, and co-starred with his father in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948), with Jack as a grubby [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrant]]. [[Jennifer Holt]] played ingenues in low-budget features, mostly for [[Universal Pictures]]. The Holt family performed together on the \"Drifty\" episode of \"All Star Western Theater\" ([[KNX (radio station)|KNX]]-[[CBS Radio|CBS]] Pacific Network, 1946/47) as a father/son/daughter trio featuring a dramatic sketch and additional entertainment by [[Foy Willing]] and the [[Riders of the Purple Sage]].<ref>{{cite web|title=All-Star Western Theatre|url=http://www.radioarchives.com/All_Star_Western_Theatre_p/ra174.htm|website=Radio Archives|accessdate=25 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529232826/http://www.radioarchives.com/All_Star_Western_Theatre_p/ra174.htm|archivedate=29 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nHolt married divorcee Margaret Wood in 1917. Her father, tycoon Henry Morton Stanley-Wood, disowned her because she married an actor; they later made up after he had lost most of his money in the Great Depression. She had a daughter when they married, and together they had a son, Charles John Holt III, and a daughter, Elizabeth Marshall Holt. Better known as [[Tim Holt|Tim]] and [[Jennifer Holt|Jennifer]], respectively, both of them became actors in western films.<ref name=\"w\" />\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Bessie Barriscale Howard Hickman Jack Holt 1919.jpg|thumb|right|Original caption: \"[[Howard C.

The stunt cracked some of Holt's ribs and injured the horse so badly that it had to be destroyed. The film, which was considered lost for years, was included in the DVD released 2011 anthology ''Treasures 5 The West 1898\u20141938'' by the [[National Film Preservation Foundation]] after a print was discovered in Australia.<ref name=\"w\" />\n\nJack Holt, with his dapper mustache, prominent jaw, and quick-with-his-fists manner, personified [[Masculinity|rugged masculinity]]. Holt became [[Columbia Pictures]]' most reliable [[leading man]], and scored personal successes in three [[Frank Capra]] action dramas:  ''[[Submarine (1928 film)|Submarine]]'' (1928), ''[[Flight (1929 film)|Flight]]'' (1929) and ''[[Dirigible (film)|Dirigible]]'' (1931). Holt's no-nonsense characterizations were eclipsed by younger, tough-talking actors like [[James Cagney]] and [[Chester Morris]], although he was still entrusted with tough-guy-with-a-heart-of-gold leads. Two mid-1930s features, ''[[Whirlpool]]'' and ''[[The Defense Rests]]'', starred Holt opposite up-and-coming ingenue [[Jean Arthur]].\n\nExhibitors had come to associate Jack Holt with rough-and-tumble action, and so Holt continued to work in low-budget crime dramas (mostly for Columbia) through 1940. The series came to an end when he argued with studio chief [[Harry Cohn]]. Cohn thought the actor so arrogant that he assigned Holt the leading role in a lowbrow 15-chapter [[Serial film|serial]], ''[[Holt of the Secret Service]]'' (1941). Holt \u2014 the star of longest standing with the studio \u2014 was insulted by Cohn's demotion and, although he turned in a professional performance in the serial, he walked out on both Cohn and Columbia.\n\n[[File:Jack Holt-Seena Owen in Victory.jpg|thumb|right|Jack Holt and Seena Owen in ''Victory'']]Holt began freelancing at other studios, frequently appearing in outdoor and western fare. He would become an enduring member of the cowboy fraternity through ''[[Trail of Robin Hood]]'' (1950), a [[Roy Rogers]] western with guest appearances by Holt, [[Allan Lane]], [[Tom Keene (actor)|Tom Keene]], [[Tom Tyler]], [[Kermit Maynard]], and [[Rex Allen]].\n\nJack Holt's children established their own film careers. [[Tim Holt]] succeeded [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] as the star of [[RKO Radio Pictures]]' \"B\" westerns, and co-starred with his father in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948), with Jack as a grubby [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrant]]. [[Jennifer Holt]] played ingenues in low-budget features, mostly for [[Universal Pictures]]. The Holt family performed together on the \"Drifty\" episode of \"All Star Western Theater\" ([[KNX (radio station)|KNX]]-[[CBS Radio|CBS]] Pacific Network, 1946/47) as a father/son/daughter trio featuring a dramatic sketch and additional entertainment by [[Foy Willing]] and the [[Riders of the Purple Sage]].<ref>{{cite web|title=All-Star Western Theatre|url=http://www.radioarchives.com/All_Star_Western_Theatre_p/ra174.htm|website=Radio Archives|accessdate=25 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529232826/http://www.radioarchives.com/All_Star_Western_Theatre_p/ra174.htm|archivedate=29 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nHolt married divorcee Margaret Wood in 1917. Her father, tycoon Henry Morton Stanley-Wood, disowned her because she married an actor; they later made up after he had lost most of his money in the Great Depression. She had a daughter when they married, and together they had a son, Charles John Holt III, and a daughter, Elizabeth Marshall Holt.
