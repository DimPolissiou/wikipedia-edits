Following Trajkovski's death in 2004, he was succeeded by [[Branko Crvenkovski]]. [[Gjorge Ivanov]] won the 2009 presidential election and took office on 12 May 2009. He was re-elected in 2014.

All divergent beliefs were defined as [[heresy|heresies]]. This included [[Docetism]], [[Arianism]], [[Nestorianism]], and [[Sabellianism]]. \n\nThe most widely accepted definitions of the incarnation and the nature of Jesus were made by the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431, and the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451. These councils declared that Jesus was both fully God: begotten from, but not created by the Father; and fully man: taking His flesh and human nature from the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]].

Specifically, Incarnation is vital for understanding the concept of [[Divinization (Christian)|Divinisation]] of the Man, most well and elaborately developed in Orthodox Christianity and most well expressed by Church Fathers, such as [[St. Athanasius of Alexandria]] (\"Therefore He was not man, and then became God, but He was God, and then became man, and that to deify us\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Athanasius |title=Against the Arians |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.xxi.ii.i.xi.html |chapter=Discourse I, Paragraph 39 |access-date=2012-11-06 |author-link=Athanasius of Alexandria}}</ref>), [[St Cyril of Alexandria]] (\"For we too are sons and gods by grace, and we have surely been brought to this wonderful and supernatural dignity since we have the Only Begotten Word of God dwelling within us.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=of Alexandria |first=Cyril |title=On the Unity of Christ |publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-88141-133-1 |location=Crestwood, NY |pages=80}}</ref>) [[Divinization_(Christian)#Patristic_writings|and numerous others]].\n\n===Modern Protestantism===\nThe link between the incarnation and the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] within [[systematic theology]] is complex. Within traditional models of the atonement, such as [[Substitutionary atonement|Substitution]], [[Satisfaction theory of atonement|Satisfaction]] or [[Christus Victor]], Christ must be human in order for the sacrifice of the cross to be efficacious, for human sins to be \"removed\" and/or \"conquered\". In his work ''The Trinity and the Kingdom of God'',<ref>''Trinit\u00e4t und Reich Gottes. Zur Gotteslehre'' 1980</ref> [[J\u00fcrgen Moltmann]] differentiated between what he called a \"fortuitous\" and a \"necessary\" incarnation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The latter gives a soteriological emphasis to the incarnation: the Son of God became a man so that he could save us from our sins. The former, on the other hand, speaks of the incarnation as a fulfilment of the [[Love of God]], of his desire to be present and living amidst humanity, to \"walk in the garden\" with us. Moltmann favours \"fortuitous\" incarnation primarily because he feels that to speak of an incarnation of \"necessity\" is to do an injustice to the [[Ministry of Jesus|life of Christ]].\n\n==Hymns and prayers==\n\n===Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic===\nThe significance of the incarnation has been extensively discussed throughout [[History of Christianity|Christian history]], and is the subject of countless [[hymn]]s and [[prayer]]s. For instance, the ''[[Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom]]'' (c. 400), as used by [[Eastern Orthodox Christians]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Byzantine Catholics]], includes this \"Hymn to the Only Begotten Son\":\n<blockquote><poem>O only begotten Son and Word of God,\nWho, being immortal,\nDeigned for our [[salvation]]\nTo become incarnate\nOf the holy ''[[Theotokos]]'' and [[perpetual virginity of Mary|ever-virgin]] Mary,\nAnd became man without change;\nYou were also crucified,\nO Christ our God,\nAnd by death have trampled Death,\nBeing one of the Holy Trinity,\nGlorified with the Father and the Holy Spirit\u2014\nSave us!<ref>{{Cite Catholic Catechism | part = p1 | section = s2 | chapter = c3 | article = a3 | div = #463 }}</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\nAdditionally, the [[Divine Liturgy of Saint James]] includes this chant of \"[[Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence]]\" in its [[offertory]]:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Let all mortal flesh be silent,\nand stand with fear and trembling,\nand meditate nothing earthly within itself:\u2014\nFor the King of kings and Lord of lords, \n[[Christ]] our [[God in Christianity|God]], comes forward to be [[Crucifixion of Jesus|sacrificed]], \nand to be given for [[Eucharist|food]] to the faithful;\nand the bands of [[Christian angelology|angels]] go before Him\nwith every power and dominion,\nthe many-eyed [[cherubim]],\nand the six-winged [[seraphim]],\ncovering their faces,\nand crying aloud the hymn,\n[[Alleluia]], Alleluia, Alleluia.<ref>''[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0717.htm Divine Liturgy of St. James]''.

The text of this ma\u201bneetho dates back to the 6th century and is attributed in later sources to St. Severus, the Patriarch of Antioch (c. 465\u2013538).

The Son of God, Servetus asserted, is not an eternally existing being, but rather the more abstract ''Logos'' (a manifestation of the One True God, not a separate person) incarnate. For this reason, Servetus refused to call Christ the \"eternal Son of God\" preferring \"the Son of the eternal God\" instead.<ref>[http://godglorified.com/errors_of_the_trinity.htm 'De trinitatis erroribus'], Book 7.</ref>\n\nIn describing Servetus' theology of the ''Logos'', Andrew Dibb (2005) comments: \"In Genesis God reveals Himself as the Creator. In John He reveals that He created by means of the Word, or ''Logos.'' Finally, also in John, He shows that this ''Logos'' became flesh and 'dwelt among us'. Creation took place by the spoken word, for God said 'Let there be...' The spoken word of Genesis, the ''Logos'' of John, and the Christ, are all one and the same.\"<ref>Andrew Dibb, ''Servetus, Swedenborg and the Nature of God'', University Press of America, 2005, p 93.

The French reformer [[John Calvin]], who asserted he would ensure the death of Servetus if he set foot in Geneva because of his non-Reformed views on the Trinity and the sacrament of baptism, requested he be beheaded as a traitor rather than burned as a heretic, but the authorities insisted on executing Servetus by fire.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cottret |first=Bernard |title=John Calvin |publisher=W.B.Eerdmans |year=2000 |location=Grand Rapids |pages=222\u2013225 |translator-last=McDonald |translator-first=M. Wallace |author-link=Bernard Cottret}}</ref>\n\n===English Arians===\nPost-Reformation Arians such as [[William Whiston]] often held a view of the incarnation in keeping with the personal [[pre-existence]] of Christ. Whiston considered the incarnation to be of the Logos Who had pre-existed as \"a Metaphysick existence, in potentia or in the like higher and sublimer Manner in the Father as His Wisdom or Word before His real Creation or Generation.\".<ref>James E. Force ''William Whiston, honest Newtonian'' 1985 p16</ref>\n\n=== Socinian and Unitarian ===\nServetus rejected [[Arianism]] because it denied Jesus' divinity<ref>''Restituci\u00f3n'', p. 137.</ref> so it is certain that he would have also rejected [[Socinianism]] as a form of Arianism which both rejects that Jesus is God, and, also that Jesus consciously existed before His birth, which most Arian groups accept. [[Fausto Sozzini]] and writers of the [[Polish Brethren]] such as [[Samuel Przypkowski]], [[Marcin Czechowic]] and [[Johann Ludwig von Wolzogen]] saw the incarnation as being primarily a function of [[fatherhood]]. Namely that Christ was literally both 'Son of Man' from his maternal side, and also literally 'Son of God' on his paternal side. The concept of the incarnation \u2014\"the Word became flesh and dwelt among us\"\u2014 was understood as the literal ''word'' or ''logos'' of {{Bibleref2|Ps.|33:6}} having been made human by a virgin birth. Sozzini, Przypkowski and other Socinian writers were distinct from Servetus in stating that Jesus having \"come down from heaven\" was primarily in terms of Mary's miraculous conception and not in Jesus having in any literal sense been in heaven.<ref>[[George Huntston Williams]] ''The Radical Reformation''</ref><ref>[[Roland H. Bainton]]. ''The Reformation of the Sixteenth Century''</ref> Today the number of churches with Socinian Christology is very small, the main group known for this are the [[Christadelphians]], other groups include [[Church of God General Conference (Abrahamic Faith)|CoGGC]] and [[Church of the Blessed Hope|CGAF]]. Modern [[Socinian]] or \"[[Biblical Unitarian]]\" writers generally place emphasis on \"made flesh\" not just meaning \"made a body\", but incarnation (a term these groups would avoid) requiring Jesus having the temptable and mortal nature of His mother.<ref>A.D. Norris, ''The Person of the Lord Jesus Christ'', [[The Christadelphian]], Birmingham 1982</ref>\n\n=== Oneness Pentecostalism===\nIn contrast to the traditional view of the incarnation cited above, adherents of [[Oneness Pentecostalism]] believe in the doctrine of Oneness. Although both Oneness and traditional Christianity teach that God is a ''singular'' Spirit, Oneness adherents reject the idea that God is a Trinity of persons. Oneness doctrine teaches there is one God who manifests Himself in different ways, as opposed to a Trinity, where God is seen as one being consisting of three distinct persons. \n\nTo a Oneness Pentecostal, Jesus is seen as both fully divine and fully human. The term Father refers to God Himself, who caused the conception of the Son in Mary, thus becoming the father of the child she bore. The term Son refers to the fully human person, Jesus Christ; and the Holy Ghost refers to the manifestation of God's Spirit inside of and around His people. Thus the Father is ''not'' the Son \u2013 and this distinction is crucial \u2013 but is ''in'' the Son as the fullness of His divine nature.<ref>{David K. Bernard (1994-09-30).

All divergent beliefs were defined as [[heresy|heresies]]. This included [[Docetism]], [[Arianism]], [[Nestorianism]], and [[Sabellianism]]. \n\nThe most widely accepted definitions of the incarnation and the nature of Jesus were made by the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431, and the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451. These councils declared that Jesus was both fully God: begotten from, but not created by the Father; and fully man: taking His flesh and human nature from the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]. These two natures, human and divine, were [[hypostatic union|hypostatically]] united into the one [[Personhood#Christianity|personhood]] of Jesus Christ.<ref group=\"note\">[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.toc.html The Seven Ecumenical Councils], from the ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', vols. 2\u201314 (CCEL.org) Contains detailed statements from each of these councils.

Without diminishing His divinity, He added to it all that is involved in being human.<ref name=\"Packer\">[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/march/25.72.html Packer, J.I., \"Incarnate Forever\", ''Christianity Today'', Vol. 48, No. 3, p.72, March 1, 2004]</ref> In Christian belief it is understood that Jesus was at the same time both fully God and fully human, two natures in one person.<ref>[http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/articles.php/5622/archbishop-justin-addresses-muslim-council-of-wales Welby, Justin. \"Archbishop Justin addresses Muslim Council of Wales\", The Archbishop of Canterbury, October 2, 2015]</ref> The body of Christ was therefore subject to all the bodily weaknesses to which human nature is universally subject; such are hunger (Matthew.4:2), thirst (John 19:28), fatigue (John 4:6), pain, and death. They were the natural results of the human nature He assumed.<ref name=\"Drum\">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07706b.htm Drum, Walter. \"The Incarnation\". ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''] Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 20 Octobrt 2016</ref>\n\nIncarnation of Jesus is also one of the key factors which, alongside humans made in image and likeness of God, forms Christian Anthropology. Specifically, Incarnation is vital for understanding the concept of [[Divinization (Christian)|Divinisation]] of the Man, most well and elaborately developed in Orthodox Christianity and most well expressed by Church Fathers, such as [[St. Athanasius of Alexandria]] (\"Therefore He was not man, and then became God, but He was God, and then became man, and that to deify us\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Athanasius |title=Against the Arians |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.xxi.ii.i.xi.html |chapter=Discourse I, Paragraph 39 |access-date=2012-11-06 |author-link=Athanasius of Alexandria}}</ref>), [[St Cyril of Alexandria]] (\"For we too are sons and gods by grace, and we have surely been brought to this wonderful and supernatural dignity since we have the Only Begotten Word of God dwelling within us.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=of Alexandria |first=Cyril |title=On the Unity of Christ |publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-88141-133-1 |location=Crestwood, NY |pages=80}}</ref>) [[Divinization_(Christian)#Patristic_writings|and numerous others]].\n\n===Modern Protestantism===\nThe link between the incarnation and the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] within [[systematic theology]] is complex. Within traditional models of the atonement, such as [[Substitutionary atonement|Substitution]], [[Satisfaction theory of atonement|Satisfaction]] or [[Christus Victor]], Christ must be human in order for the sacrifice of the cross to be efficacious, for human sins to be \"removed\" and/or \"conquered\". In his work ''The Trinity and the Kingdom of God'',<ref>''Trinit\u00e4t und Reich Gottes. Zur Gotteslehre'' 1980</ref> [[J\u00fcrgen Moltmann]] differentiated between what he called a \"fortuitous\" and a \"necessary\" incarnation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The latter gives a soteriological emphasis to the incarnation: the Son of God became a man so that he could save us from our sins. The former, on the other hand, speaks of the incarnation as a fulfilment of the [[Love of God]], of his desire to be present and living amidst humanity, to \"walk in the garden\" with us. Moltmann favours \"fortuitous\" incarnation primarily because he feels that to speak of an incarnation of \"necessity\" is to do an injustice to the [[Ministry of Jesus|life of Christ]].\n\n==Hymns and prayers==\n\n===Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic===\nThe significance of the incarnation has been extensively discussed throughout [[History of Christianity|Christian history]], and is the subject of countless [[hymn]]s and [[prayer]]s. For instance, the ''[[Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom]]'' (c. 400), as used by [[Eastern Orthodox Christians]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Byzantine Catholics]], includes this \"Hymn to the Only Begotten Son\":\n<blockquote><poem>O only begotten Son and Word of God,\nWho, being immortal,\nDeigned for our [[salvation]]\nTo become incarnate\nOf the holy ''[[Theotokos]]'' and [[perpetual virginity of Mary|ever-virgin]] Mary,\nAnd became man without change;\nYou were also crucified,\nO Christ our God,\nAnd by death have trampled Death,\nBeing one of the Holy Trinity,\nGlorified with the Father and the Holy Spirit\u2014\nSave us!<ref>{{Cite Catholic Catechism | part = p1 | section = s2 | chapter = c3 | article = a3 | div = #463 }}</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\nAdditionally, the [[Divine Liturgy of Saint James]] includes this chant of \"[[Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence]]\" in its [[offertory]]:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Let all mortal flesh be silent,\nand stand with fear and trembling,\nand meditate nothing earthly within itself:\u2014\nFor the King of kings and Lord of lords, \n[[Christ]] our [[God in Christianity|God]], comes forward to be [[Crucifixion of Jesus|sacrificed]], \nand to be given for [[Eucharist|food]] to the faithful;\nand the bands of [[Christian angelology|angels]] go before Him\nwith every power and dominion,\nthe many-eyed [[cherubim]],\nand the six-winged [[seraphim]],\ncovering their faces,\nand crying aloud the hymn,\n[[Alleluia]], Alleluia, Alleluia.<ref>''[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0717.htm Divine Liturgy of St. James]''.

AD 60) have a similar ''ma\u201bneetho'',<ref group=\"note\">(Syr.): A responsory, originally to a psalm, where each verse of a psalm had a response in poetic form. The text of this ma\u201bneetho dates back to the 6th century and is attributed in later sources to St. Severus, the Patriarch of Antioch (c. 465\u2013538). The Byzantine Orthodox rite also has a similar hymn called a troparion and is attributed there to Emperor Justinian (c. 483-565)</ref> a poetic hymn, traditionally attributed to St. Severus, the Patriarch of Antioch (c. 465\u2013538):\n<blockquote><poem>I exalt Thee, Lord and King,\nOnly-begotten Son and Word\nof the heavenly Father,\nimmortal by nature, Thou came down by grace\nfor salvation\nand life for all human race; was incarnate\nof the holy\nglorious, pure Virgin\nMary, Mother of God\nand became man without any change;\nwas crucified for us.\nO Christ, our God,\nWho by Thy death trampled and slaughtered our death,\nWho are One of the Holy Trinity,\nworshipped and honored with\nthe Father and the Holy Spirit,\nhave mercy on us all.<ref>[http://sor.cua.edu/Liturgy/SvcBook/Service_Book_20080512.pdf]</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\n== Alternative views ==\n\n=== Michael Servetus ===\nDuring the Reformation, [[Michael Servetus]] taught a theology of the incarnation that [[Antitrinitarianism|denied trinitarianism]], insisting that classical trinitarians were essentially [[tritheist]]s who had rejected Biblical [[monotheism]] in favor of [[Greek philosophy]]. The Son of God, Servetus asserted, is not an eternally existing being, but rather the more abstract ''Logos'' (a manifestation of the One True God, not a separate person) incarnate. For this reason, Servetus refused to call Christ the \"eternal Son of God\" preferring \"the Son of the eternal God\" instead.<ref>[http://godglorified.com/errors_of_the_trinity.htm 'De trinitatis erroribus'], Book 7.</ref>\n\nIn describing Servetus' theology of the ''Logos'', Andrew Dibb (2005) comments: \"In Genesis God reveals Himself as the Creator. In John He reveals that He created by means of the Word, or ''Logos.'' Finally, also in John, He shows that this ''Logos'' became flesh and 'dwelt among us'. Creation took place by the spoken word, for God said 'Let there be...' The spoken word of Genesis, the ''Logos'' of John, and the Christ, are all one and the same.\"<ref>Andrew Dibb, ''Servetus, Swedenborg and the Nature of God'', University Press of America, 2005, p 93.

The French reformer [[John Calvin]], who asserted he would ensure the death of Servetus if he set foot in Geneva because of his non-Reformed views on the Trinity and the sacrament of baptism, requested he be beheaded as a traitor rather than burned as a heretic, but the authorities insisted on executing Servetus by fire.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cottret |first=Bernard |title=John Calvin |publisher=W.B.Eerdmans |year=2000 |location=Grand Rapids |pages=222\u2013225 |translator-last=McDonald |translator-first=M. Wallace |author-link=Bernard Cottret}}</ref>\n\n===English Arians===\nPost-Reformation Arians such as [[William Whiston]] often held a view of the incarnation in keeping with the personal [[pre-existence]] of Christ. Whiston considered the incarnation to be of the Logos Who had pre-existed as \"a Metaphysick existence, in potentia or in the like higher and sublimer Manner in the Father as His Wisdom or Word before His real Creation or Generation.\".<ref>James E. Force ''William Whiston, honest Newtonian'' 1985 p16</ref>\n\n=== Socinian and Unitarian ===\nServetus rejected [[Arianism]] because it denied Jesus' divinity<ref>''Restituci\u00f3n'', p. 137.</ref> so it is certain that he would have also rejected [[Socinianism]] as a form of Arianism which both rejects that Jesus is God, and, also that Jesus consciously existed before His birth, which most Arian groups accept. [[Fausto Sozzini]] and writers of the [[Polish Brethren]] such as [[Samuel Przypkowski]], [[Marcin Czechowic]] and [[Johann Ludwig von Wolzogen]] saw the incarnation as being primarily a function of [[fatherhood]]. Namely that Christ was literally both 'Son of Man' from his maternal side, and also literally 'Son of God' on his paternal side. The concept of the incarnation \u2014\"the Word became flesh and dwelt among us\"\u2014 was understood as the literal ''word'' or ''logos'' of {{Bibleref2|Ps.|33:6}} having been made human by a virgin birth. Sozzini, Przypkowski and other Socinian writers were distinct from Servetus in stating that Jesus having \"come down from heaven\" was primarily in terms of Mary's miraculous conception and not in Jesus having in any literal sense been in heaven.<ref>[[George Huntston Williams]] ''The Radical Reformation''</ref><ref>[[Roland H. Bainton]]. ''The Reformation of the Sixteenth Century''</ref> Today the number of churches with Socinian Christology is very small, the main group known for this are the [[Christadelphians]], other groups include [[Church of God General Conference (Abrahamic Faith)|CoGGC]] and [[Church of the Blessed Hope|CGAF]]. Modern [[Socinian]] or \"[[Biblical Unitarian]]\" writers generally place emphasis on \"made flesh\" not just meaning \"made a body\", but incarnation (a term these groups would avoid) requiring Jesus having the temptable and mortal nature of His mother.<ref>A.D. Norris, ''The Person of the Lord Jesus Christ'', [[The Christadelphian]], Birmingham 1982</ref>\n\n=== Oneness Pentecostalism===\nIn contrast to the traditional view of the incarnation cited above, adherents of [[Oneness Pentecostalism]] believe in the doctrine of Oneness. Although both Oneness and traditional Christianity teach that God is a ''singular'' Spirit, Oneness adherents reject the idea that God is a Trinity of persons. Oneness doctrine teaches there is one God who manifests Himself in different ways, as opposed to a Trinity, where God is seen as one being consisting of three distinct persons. \n\nTo a Oneness Pentecostal, Jesus is seen as both fully divine and fully human. The term Father refers to God Himself, who caused the conception of the Son in Mary, thus becoming the father of the child she bore. The term Son refers to the fully human person, Jesus Christ; and the Holy Ghost refers to the manifestation of God's Spirit inside of and around His people. Thus the Father is ''not'' the Son \u2013 and this distinction is crucial \u2013 but is ''in'' the Son as the fullness of His divine nature.<ref>{David K. Bernard (1994-09-30).

It also differs totally from the [[Mormonism and Judaism#Nature of God|Jewish tradition]] of [[ethical monotheism]] in which [[Elohim#Hebrew Bible|Elohim]] ({{Lang-he|\u05d0\u05b1\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd}}) is a completely different conception.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{catholic|title=The Incarnation}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://godglorified.com/errors_of_the_trinity.htm 'De trinitatis erroribus'], by Michael Servetus (Non-Trinitarian)\n* [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/athanasius/incarnation.html On the Incarnation] by Saint [[Athanasius of Alexandria]].
