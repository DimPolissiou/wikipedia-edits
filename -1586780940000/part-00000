When two strangers from [[China]] claim him as a reincarnation of war hero 'Liu Shen' and take him to China, Sidhu, encouraged by trickster Chopstick ([[Ranvir Shorey]]), believes he will be feted as a hero, unaware of his own recruitment to assassinate the smuggler Hojo ([[Gordon Liu]]).\n\nSidhu travels to China with Chopstick. Along the way, he meets Sakhi ([[Deepika Padukone]]), the Indian-Chinese spokesmodel known as Ms. Tele Shoppers Media, or Ms. TSM, who also appears in China. Her twin sister Suzy, known as the [[femme fatale]] Meow Meow, works for Hojo, not knowing Hojo tried to kill her father, Inspector Chiang (Roger Yuan). Sidhu, through a series of accidents, initially eludes Hojo. However, Sidhu realises the truth about his identity. Devastated, Sidhu apologizes to Hojo. Just then, Dada shows up and starts beating Hojo's men, but Hojo kills dada, and Sidhu is exposed as a loser. Also, he is beaten and urinated on by Hojo. Injured and disgraced, Sidhu vows revenge. Three months later, Sidhu encounters an [[amnesia]]c vagrant, whom he later identifies to Sakhi as Inspector Chiang. Chiang later recovers his memory and trains Sidhu in [[kung fu]]. When Hojo again meets with Sidhu, Suzy injures Chiang; but upon seeing Sakhi, betrays Hojo. Sidhu fights Hojo in single combat, eventually using a modified vegetable-cutting technique to overpower him. After a huge fight, Sidhu finally kills Hojo. In the aftermath, Sidhu opens a vegetable stall in China but is recruited to fight for some African pygmies.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Akshay Kumar]] as Sidhu Sharma / [[Liu Sheng, Prince of Zhongshan|Liu Sheng]]\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] as Sakhi (Ms.TSM) / Suzy (Meow Meow)\n* [[Mithun Chakraborty]] as Dada (extended appearance)\n* [[Ranvir Shorey]] as Chopstick\n* [[Roger Yuan]] as Police Inspector Chiang Kohung\n* [[Gordon Liu]] as Hojo\n* [[Kiran Juneja]] as Chiang's wife\n* [[Kevin Wu]] as Frankie\n* [[Conan Stevens]] as Joey\n\n== Production ==\nThe film, earlier known as ''Mera Naam Chin Chin Choo'' and also ''Made in China'',<ref name=\"namechange\">[http://www.naachgaana.com/2007/12/08/mithun-in-chandni-chowk-to-china/ Abid, Bollywood Trade News Network, \"Mithun in Chandni Chowk to China?\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213161030/http://www.naachgaana.com/2007/12/08/mithun-in-chandni-chowk-to-china/ |date=13 December 2007 }} via Naachgaana.com, 8 December 2007</ref> is written by Sridhar Raghavan.\n\nShooting began in January 2008 and included a schedule in China.<ref name=\"Film info\">[http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k7/aug/aug307.php Indiantelevision.com, \"Warner Bros to distribute Nikhil Advani's 'Made in China'\"], 21 August 2007</ref>\n\nThe music is by [[Shankar Ehsaan Loy|Shankar, Ehsaan and Loy]].

When two strangers from [[China]] claim him as a reincarnation of war hero 'Liu Shen' and take him to China, Sidhu, encouraged by trickster Chopstick ([[Ranvir Shorey]]), believes he will be feted as a hero, unaware of his own recruitment to assassinate the smuggler Hojo ([[Gordon Liu]]).\n\nSidhu travels to China with Chopstick. Along the way, he meets Sakhi ([[Deepika Padukone]]), the Indian-Chinese spokesmodel known as Ms. Tele Shoppers Media, or Ms. TSM, who also appears in China. Her twin sister Suzy, known as the [[femme fatale]] Meow Meow, works for Hojo, not knowing Hojo tried to kill her father, Inspector Chiang (Roger Yuan). Sidhu, through a series of accidents, initially eludes Hojo. However, Sidhu realises the truth about his identity. Devastated, Sidhu apologizes to Hojo. Just then, Dada shows up and starts beating Hojo's men, but Hojo kills dada, and Sidhu is exposed as a loser. Also, he is beaten and urinated on by Hojo. Injured and disgraced, Sidhu vows revenge. Three months later, Sidhu encounters an [[amnesia]]c vagrant, whom he later identifies to Sakhi as Inspector Chiang. Chiang later recovers his memory and trains Sidhu in [[kung fu]]. When Hojo again meets with Sidhu, Suzy injures Chiang; but upon seeing Sakhi, betrays Hojo. Sidhu fights Hojo in single combat, eventually using a modified vegetable-cutting technique to overpower him. After a huge fight, Sidhu finally kills Hojo. In the aftermath, Sidhu opens a vegetable stall in China but is recruited to fight for some African pygmies.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Akshay Kumar]] as Sidhu Sharma / [[Liu Sheng, Prince of Zhongshan|Liu Sheng]]\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] as Sakhi (Ms.TSM) / Suzy (Meow Meow)\n* [[Mithun Chakraborty]] as Dada (extended appearance)\n* [[Ranvir Shorey]] as Chopstick\n* [[Roger Yuan]] as Police Inspector Chiang Kohung\n* [[Gordon Liu]] as Hojo\n* [[Kiran Juneja]] as Chiang's wife\n* [[Kevin Wu]] as Frankie\n* [[Conan Stevens]] as Joey\n\n== Production ==\nThe film, earlier known as ''Mera Naam Chin Chin Choo'' and also ''Made in China'',<ref name=\"namechange\">[http://www.naachgaana.com/2007/12/08/mithun-in-chandni-chowk-to-china/ Abid, Bollywood Trade News Network, \"Mithun in Chandni Chowk to China?\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213161030/http://www.naachgaana.com/2007/12/08/mithun-in-chandni-chowk-to-china/ |date=13 December 2007 }} via Naachgaana.com, 8 December 2007</ref> is written by Sridhar Raghavan.\n\nShooting began in January 2008 and included a schedule in China.<ref name=\"Film info\">[http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k7/aug/aug307.php Indiantelevision.com, \"Warner Bros to distribute Nikhil Advani's 'Made in China'\"], 21 August 2007</ref>\n\nThe music is by [[Shankar Ehsaan Loy|Shankar, Ehsaan and Loy]].

She demonstrated an independent streak and a willingness to use factional Scottish politics in her conflicts with James over the custody of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]] and his treatment of her friend [[Barbara Ruthven|Beatrix Ruthven]]. Anne appears to have loved James at first, but the couple gradually drifted and eventually lived apart, though mutual respect and a degree of affection survived.<ref>Stewart, 182, 300\u2013301.</ref>\n\nIn England, Anne shifted her energies from factional politics to patronage of the arts and constructed her own magnificent court, hosting one of the richest cultural [[Salon (gathering)|salons]] in Europe.<ref>Barroll, 15, 35, 109; \"Although Anna had considerable personal freedom and her own court, she does not appear to have intervened so visibly against her husband in factional politics as she did in Scotland, and her support was not often sought.

Though she was reported to have been a [[Protestant]] at the time of her death, evidence suggests that she may have converted to [[Catholicism]] at some point in her life.<ref>The Archbishop of Canterbury reported that she had died rejecting Catholic notions. \"But, then,\" cautions historian John Leeds Barroll, \"we are all familiar with the modern 'press release'. In Anna's day, too, there was much to be said for promulgating an official version of England's queen dying 'respectably'.\" Barroll, 172; A letter from Anne to [[Scipione Borghese]] of 31 July 1601 is \"open in its embrace of Catholicism\", according to McManus, 93.</ref>\n\nHistorians have traditionally dismissed Anne as a lightweight queen, frivolous and self-indulgent.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/livesqueensengl11strigoog/page/n244 <!-- pg=233 quote=inauthor:Agnes inauthor:Strickland \"Anne of Denmark\". --> Agnes Strickland (1848), 276] Retrieved 10 May 2007; Willson, 95; \"Her traditionally flaccid court image&nbsp;...\" Barroll, 27; Croft, 55; \"Anne had proved to be both dull and indolent, though showing a certain tolerant amiability so long as her whims were satisfied.

In need of a male heir the King had been hoping for a son,<ref>Williams, 1.</ref> and Sofie gave birth to a son, [[Christian IV of Denmark]], three years later.<ref>Williams, 3.</ref>\n\nWith her older sister, [[Elizabeth of Denmark, Duchess of Brunswick|Elizabeth]], Anne was sent to be raised at [[G\u00fcstrow Palace|G\u00fcstrow]] by her maternal grandparents, the [[Ulrich III of Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow|Duke]] and [[Elizabeth of Denmark, Duchess of Mecklenburg|Duchess of Mecklenburg]]. Christian was also sent to be brought up at G\u00fcstrow but two years later, in 1579, his father the King wrote to his parents-in-law, to request the return of his sons, Christian and Ulrich, (probably, at the urging of the Rigsr\u00e5d, the Danish Privy Council), and Anne and Elizabeth returned with him.<ref>Williams, 5.</ref>\n\nAnne enjoyed a close, happy family upbringing in Denmark, thanks largely to Queen Sophie, who nursed the children through their illnesses herself.<ref>Croft, 24; The English agent Daniel Rogers reported to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] that Sophie was \"a right virtuous and godly Princess which with motherly care and great wisdom ruleth her children.\" Williams, 4.</ref> Suitors from all over Europe sought the hands of Anne and Elizabeth in marriage, including [[James VI of Scotland]], who favoured Denmark as a kingdom reformed in religion and a profitable trading partner.<ref name=\"Croft 24\">Croft, 24</ref>\n[[Image:James VI of Scotland aged 20, 1586..jpg|thumb|James VI in 1586, aged twenty, three years before his marriage to Anne.

One reason James set this option aside was Henry's hard requirement for military assistance.

As a matchmaker, however, Sophie proved more diligent than Frederick and, overcoming sticking points on the amount of the [[dowry]] and the status of [[Orkney]],<ref>The [[Orkney Islands]] had been a provisional part of the dowry of [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret of Denmark]] on her marriage to [[James III of Scotland]] in 1469, returnable to Denmark upon full payment of the dowry.

Williams, 15.</ref> Fowler's insinuation, that James preferred men to women,<ref>\"All his life, except perhaps for six short months, King James disliked women, regarding them as inferior beings. All his interest was centered on the attractions of personable young men.\" Williams, 14\u201315.</ref> would have been hidden from the fourteen-year-old Anne, who devotedly embroidered shirts for her fianc\u00e9 while 300 tailors worked on her wedding dress.<ref>There were other dresses: five hundred Danish tailors and embroiderers were said to have been at work for three months. Willson, 87; A dress of peach and parrot-coloured [[damask]] with fishboned skirts lined with wreaths of pillows round the hips was especially admired. Williams, 14.</ref>\n\nWhatever the truth of the rumours, James required a royal match to preserve the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] line.<ref>Croft, 23\u20134.</ref> \"God is my witness\", he explained, \"I could have abstained longer than the weal of my country could have permitted, [had not] my long delay bred in the breasts of many a great jealousy of my inability, as if I were a barren stock.\"<ref>Willson, 85.</ref> On 20 August 1589, Anne was [[Proxy marriage|married by proxy]] to James at [[Kronborg Castle]], the ceremony ending with James' representative, [[George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal]], sitting next to Anne on the bridal bed.<ref>Williams, 15; McManus, 61.</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\nAnne set sail for Scotland within 10 days, but her fleet under the command of Admiral [[Peder Munk]] was beset by a series of misadventures,<ref>At [[Elsinore]] a [[cannon|naval gun]] had backfired, killing two gunners. The next day, a gun [[Cannon operation|fired]] in tribute to two visiting Scottish noblemen exploded, killing one gunner and injuring 9 of the crew. Storms at sea then put the fleet in severe difficulties (one report had Anne's ship missing for three days). Two of the ships in the flotilla collided, killing two more sailors. Anna's ship, the \"Gideon\", sprung a dangerous leak and put into Gammel Sellohe in Norway for repairs, but it leaked again after setting sail once more. The fleet then put in at [[Flekker\u00f8y]], by which time it was 1 October and the crews were unwilling to try again so late in the year.

He arrived in Oslo on 19 November after travelling by land from [[Flekkefjord]] via [[T\u00f8nsberg]].<ref>In one of the messages James left behind, he said he had decided on this action alone, to demonstrate that he was no \"irresolute ass who could do nothing of himself\". Willson, 90; Stewart, 112; Williams points out that it was brave of James to cross the North Sea at that time of year in a 130-ton ship. Williams, 18; McManus notes that the gesture \"startles commentators accustomed to the image of James as a timorous man.\" McManus, 63.</ref> According to a Scottish account, he presented himself to Anne, \"with boots and all\", and, disarming her protests, gave her a kiss in the Scottish fashion.<ref>\"His majesty minded to give the Queen a kiss after the Scots fashion at meeting, which she refused as not being the form of her country. Marry, after a few words spoken privately between His Majesty and her, there passed familiarity and kisses.\" [[David Moysie]]'s account, quoted by Stewart, 112; Williams, 20; McManus sees Anne's protests as an early sign of assertiveness. McManus, 65\u201366; Willson distrusts Moysie's version and prefers a Danish narrative whereby James enters Oslo in state with heralds, observing the diplomatic niceties in full. Willson, 90\u201391</ref>\n\nAnne and James were formally married at the [[Old Bishop's Palace in Oslo]] on 23 November 1589, \"with all the splendour possible at that time and place.\"<ref>Stewart, 112.</ref> So that both bride and groom could understand, Leith minister [[David Lindsay (bishop of Ross)|David Lindsay]] conducted the ceremony in French, describing Anne as \"a Princess both godly and beautiful&nbsp;... she giveth great contentment to his Majesty.\"<ref>Stewart, 112; Willson, 91.</ref> A month of celebrations followed; and on 22 December, cutting his entourage to 50, James visited his new relations at [[Kronborg Castle]] in [[Elsinore]], where the newlyweds were greeted by Queen Sophie, 12 year-old [[Christian IV of Denmark|King Christian IV]], and Christian's four regents.<ref>Stewart, 113; Williams, 23. Anne and James may have repeated their marriage ceremony at Kronborg, this time by Lutheran rites, on 21 January 1590. Williams, 23; McManus regards this repeat ceremony as unsubstantiated. McManus, 61.</ref> The couple moved on to [[Copenhagen]] on 7 March and attended the wedding of Anne's older sister Elizabeth to [[Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick]] on 19 April, sailing two days later for Scotland in a patched up \"Gideon\".<ref>Stewart, 117.</ref> They arrived in the [[Water of Leith]] on 1 May.

Williams, 53\u201357.</ref> Nervous of the lengths to which Anne might go, James formally charged Mar in writing never to surrender Henry to anyone except on orders from his own mouth, \"because in the surety of my son consists my surety\", nor to yield Henry to the Queen even in the event of his own death.<ref>Stewart, 141; \"And in case God call me at any time see that neither for the Queen nor Estates, their pleasure, you deliver him till he be eighteen years of age, and that he command you himself.\" Williams, 55.</ref> Anne demanded the matter be referred to the Council, but James would not hear of it.<ref>Williams, 54.</ref> After public scenes in which James reduced her to rage and tears over the issue,<ref>In May 1595 Anne desperately pleaded with James to be allowed custody of Henry, complaining that \"it was an ill return to refuse her suit, founded on reason and nature, and to prefer giving the care of her babe to a subject who neither in rank nor deserving was the best his Majesty had.\" The King countered that \"though he doubted nothing of her good intentions yet if some faction got strong enough, she could not hinder his boy being used against him, as he himself had been against his unfortunate mother.\" Williams, 54, quoting from Thomas Birch, ''Memoirs of Queen Elizabeth'', vol. 1 (London, 1754), p. 243.</ref> Anne became so bitterly upset that in July 1595 she suffered a miscarriage.<ref>Williams, 56.</ref> Thereafter, she outwardly abandoned her campaign, but it was thought permanent damage had been done to the marriage. In August 1595, [[John Colville (c. 1540\u20131605)|John Colville]] wrote: \"There is nothing but lurking hatred disguised with cunning dissimulation betwixt the King and the Queen, each intending by slight to overcome the other.\"<ref>Stewart, 141.</ref> Despite these differences, Anne and James visited the Prince at Stirling in December 1595 and returned to [[Holyrood Palace]] to celebrate her 21st birthday.<ref>M.

Anne extended and rebuilt [[Dunfermline Palace]], in 1601 preparing a lodging for her daughter [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]], but the princess remained at [[Linlithgow Palace]] on the king's orders.

Willson, 160; Williams, 70\u20131</ref> Pregnant at the time, Anne descended on Stirling with a force of \"well-supported\" nobles, intent on removing the nine-year-old Henry, whom she had hardly seen for five years; but [[Marie Stewart, Countess of Mar|Mar's wife]] and son would allow her to bring no more than two attendants with her into the castle.<ref>Stewart, 169\u201372.</ref> The obduracy of Henry's keepers sent Anne into such a fury that she suffered another miscarriage: according to [[David Calderwood]], she \"went to bed in anger and parted with child the tenth of May.\"<ref>Stewart, 169; Williams, 70; Foreign commentators in London passed on rumours about the miscarriage: the Venetian ambassador reported that Anne had beaten her belly to induce it, the French [[Maximilien de B\u00e9thune, duc de Sully]], that she had faked the miscarriage for political effect. Williams, 71; Stewart, 169; McManus, 91.</ref>\n\nWhen the Earl of Mar returned with James' instructions that Anne join him in the [[Kingdom of England]], she informed James by letter that she refused to do so unless allowed custody of Henry.<ref>James' reply indicates that Anne had accused him of not loving her, of only marrying her because of her high birth, and of listening to rumours that she might turn [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]]: \"I thank God,\" he wrote, \"I carry that love and respect unto you which by the law of God and nature I ought to do my wife and mother of my children, but not for ye are a King's daughter, for whether ye were a King's or a cook's daughter ye must be all alike to me, being once my wife.\" And he swore \"upon the peril of my salvation and damnation, that neither the [[Earl of Mar]] nor any flesh living ever informed me that ye was upon any [[papist]] or Spanish course.\" Stewart, 170.</ref> This \"forceful maternal action\", as historian Pauline Croft describes it, obliged James to climb down at last, though he reproved Anne for \"[[wikt:froward|froward]] womanly apprehensions\" and described her behaviour in a letter to Mar as \"wilfulness\".<ref>Croft, 55; Willson, 160; Williams, 71; both Barroll, 30, and McManus, 81, point out that Anne's actions were political as well as maternal; elaborate diplomacy and politics went into the hand-over: the governing Council met at [[Stirling]] and banned Anne's noble attendants from coming within ten miles (16&nbsp;km) of Henry; Mar delivered Henry to [[Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox]], representing the king; Lennox delivered him to the Council; the Council handed him over to Anne and Lennox, who were to take him south together; Stewart, 170\u20131. As the Queen travelled south, [[John Graham, 3rd Earl of Montrose]], wrote to James urging him to exercise greater control over her: \"But lest Her Highness' wrath continuing, should hereafter produce unexpected tortures, I would most humbly entreat Your Majesty to prevent the same&nbsp;... and suffer not this canker or corruption to have any further progress.\" Barroll, 33.</ref> After a brief convalescence from the [[miscarriage]], Anne duly travelled south with Prince Henry,<ref>Princess [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]] followed two days later and soon caught up, but [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]] was left in Scotland, being sickly.

Williams, 79.</ref>\n\n===Marital frictions===\nObservers regularly noted incidents of marital discord between Anne and James. The so-called [[Gowrie conspiracy]] of 1600, in which the young [[John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie|Earl of Gowrie, John Ruthven]], and his brother [[Alexander Ruthven]] were killed by James' attendants for a supposed assault on the King, triggered the dismissal of their sisters Beatrix and [[Barbara Ruthven]] as ladies-in-waiting to Anne, with whom they were \"in chiefest credit.\"<ref>Williams, 61\u201363; Barroll, 25.</ref> The Queen, who was five months pregnant,<ref>She gave birth to her second son, [[Charles I of England|Charles]], on the evening of 19 November 1600, at the same time as the Ruthven brothers' corpses were being hanged, drawn, and quartered. Williams, 66; Barroll, 26.</ref> refused to get out of bed unless they were reinstated and stayed there for two days, also refusing to eat. When James tried to command her, she warned him to take care how he treated her because she was not the Earl of Gowrie.<ref>James Melville, who witnessed the scene, wrote in his diary: \"Foremost among those refraining to believe in the guilt of the two brothers was the Queen herself. She remained in her apartment and refused to be dressed for two days&nbsp;... Although the King receiving full information of his wife's conduct and of the consequences to be drawn from it, he could not be persuaded to take up the matter right, but sought by all means to cover his folly.\" Williams, 63.</ref> James placated her for the moment by paying a famous acrobat to entertain her,<ref>Williams, 63\u20134.</ref> but she never gave up, and her stubborn support for the Ruthvens over the next three years was taken seriously enough by the government to be regarded as a security issue.<ref>Barroll notes a \"politically relentless\" streak in Anne. Barroll, 23. Anne, however, always promised she would never take part in any \"practice\" against James. Barroll, 28.</ref> In 1602, after discovering that Anne had smuggled Beatrix Ruthven into Holyrood, James carried out a cross-examination of the entire household;<ref>Barroll, 27; Williams, 64\u201365.</ref> in 1603, he finally decided to grant Beatrix Ruthven a pension of \u00a3200.<ref>\"Because though her family is hateful on account of the abominable attempt against the King, she has shown no malicious disposition.\" Williams, 65.</ref>\n\nIn 1603, James fought with Anne over the proposed composition of her English household, sending her a message that \"his Majesty took her continued perversity very heinously.\"<ref>Williams, 76.</ref> In turn, Anne took exception to James' drinking: in 1604 she confided to the French envoy that \"the King drinks so much, and conducts himself so ill in every respect, that I expect an early and evil result.\"<ref name=\"multiref1\">Croft, 56.</ref>\n\nA briefer confrontation occurred in 1613 when Anne shot and killed James' favourite dog during a hunting session. After his initial rage, James smoothed things over by giving her a \u00a32,000 diamond in memory of the dog, whose name was Jewel.<ref>Williams, 164\u20135.</ref>\n\n===Separate life===\n[[Image:Eliz bohemia 3.jpg|thumb|upright|Anne's daughter Elizabeth, c. 1606, by [[Robert Peake the Elder]]]]\nIn London, Anne adopted a cosmopolitan lifestyle, while James preferred to escape the capital, most often at his hunting lodge in [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]].<ref>Stewart, 181.</ref> Anne's chaplain, [[Godfrey Goodman]], later summed up the royal relationship: \"The King himself was a very chaste man, and there was little in the Queen to make him [[wikt:uxorious|uxorious]]; yet they did love as well as man and wife could do, not conversing together.\"<ref name=\"stew182\">Stewart, 182: 'conversing together' in the now obsolete sense of ''living together''</ref> Anne moved into [[Greenwich Palace]] and then [[Somerset House]], which she renamed Denmark House.

After narrowly surviving the birth and death of her last baby, Sophia, in 1607, Anne's decision to have no more children may have widened the gulf between her and James.<ref name=\"multiref3\">Williams, 112.</ref>\n\nThe death of their son Henry in 1612 at the age of eighteen, probably from [[typhoid]], and the departure for [[Heidelberg]] of their daughter [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]] in April 1613, after marrying [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]],<ref>Anne had originally objected to the match with Frederick, regarding it as beneath her dignity; and she did not attend the wedding at the [[Banqueting House]] in [[Whitehall]], absent \"as they say, troubled with the [[gout]].\" Stewart, 247, 250; Williams, 154\u201356.</ref> further weakened the family ties binding Anne and James.<ref name=\"croft89\">Croft, 89.</ref> Henry's death hit Anne particularly hard; the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] ambassador was advised not to offer condolences to her \"because she cannot bear to have it mentioned; nor does she ever recall it without abundant tears and sighs\".<ref>Barroll, 134; The letter writer [[John Chamberlain (letter writer)|John Chamberlain]] suggested that Anne absented herself from the investiture of [[Charles I of England|Charles]] as [[Prince of Wales]] four years later \"lest she renew her grief by the memory of the last Prince.\" Stewart, 249.</ref> From this time forward, Anne's health deteriorated, and she withdrew from the centre of cultural and political activities, staging her last known [[masque]] in 1614 and no longer maintaining a noble court.<ref>Croft, 89; Anne's ailments included [[gout]], [[dropsy]], [[arthritis]] and swollen feet. Williams, 159.</ref> Her influence over James visibly waned as he became openly dependent on powerful favourites.<ref name=\"croft89\"/>\n\n===Reaction to favourites===\nAlthough James had always adopted male [[favourite]]s among his courtiers, he now encouraged them to play a role in the government. Anne reacted very differently to the two powerful favourites who dominated the second half of her husband's English reign, [[Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset|Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset]], and [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers]], the future Duke of Buckingham. She detested Carr,<ref name=\"croft89\"/> but she encouraged the rise of Villiers, whom James knighted in her bedchamber;<ref>Barroll, 148; [[George Abbot (Archbishop of Canterbury)|Archbishop of Canterbury George Abbot]] and others had pressed Anne to support Villiers' appointment as a [[Gentleman of the Bedchamber]]; at first, she refused, saying, according to Abbot's own account, \"if Villiers get once into his favour, those who shall have most contributed to his preferment will be the first sufferers by him. I shall be no more spared than the rest\"; but Carr's enemies nonetheless persuaded the Queen to advocate for Villiers. Williams, 170; Willson, 352; Stewart, 268\u20139.</ref> and she developed friendly relations with him, calling him her \"dog\".<ref>Williams reproduces a facsimile of a letter from Anne to Villiers which begins: \"My kind dog, I have receaved your letter which is verie wellcom to me yow doe verie well in lugging the sowes eare. {{sic}}\" Williams, plate facing page 152. Villiers wrote back that he had pulled the King's ear until it was as long as any sow's. Williams, 172.</ref> Even so, Anne found herself increasingly ignored after Buckingham's rise and became a lonely figure towards the end of her life.<ref>Croft, 100.</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n[[Image:Anne of Denmark by Paul Van Somer.jpg|left|thumb|Anne of Denmark, c. 1616, by [[Paul van Somer]]]]\n\nA further source of difference between Anne and James was the issue of religion; for example, she abstained from the [[Anglican]] [[Eucharist|communion]] at her English coronation.<ref>Willson takes Anne's abstention as a sign of Catholicism; McManus cautions that it may have signalled reformed-church distrust of the [[Eucharist]]. Willson, 221; McManus, 92\u201393.</ref> Anne had been brought up a [[Lutheran]], and had a Lutheran chaplain [[Hans Sering]] in her household, but she may have discreetly converted to [[Catholicism]] at some point, a politically embarrassing scenario which alarmed ministers of the Scottish [[Kirk]] and caused suspicion in Anglican England.<ref>Historians are divided on whether Anne ever converted to Catholicism. \"Some time in the 1590s, Anne became a Roman Catholic.\" Willson, 95; \"Some time after 1600, but well before March 1603, Queen Anne was received into the Catholic Church in a secret chamber in the royal palace\". Fraser, 15; \"The Queen&nbsp;... [converted] from her native Lutheranism to a discreet, but still politically embarrassing Catholicism which alienated many ministers of the Kirk.\" Croft, 24\u20135; \"Catholic foreign ambassadors\u2014who would surely have welcomed such a situation\u2014were certain that the Queen was beyond their reach. 'She is a Lutheran', concluded the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] envoy Nicolo Molin in 1606.\" Stewart, 182; \"In 1602 a report appeared, claiming that Anne&nbsp;... had converted to the Catholic faith some years before. The author of this report, the Scottish [[Jesuit]] [[Robert Abercromby (missionary)|Robert Abercromby]], testified that James had received his wife's desertion with equanimity, commenting, 'Well, wife, if you cannot live without this sort of thing, do your best to keep things as quiet as possible.' Anne would, indeed, keep her religious beliefs as quiet as possible: for the remainder of her life \u2014 even after her death\u2014they remained obfuscated.\" Hogge, 303\u20134.</ref>\n\nQueen Elizabeth had certainly been worried about the possibility and sent messages to Anne warning her not to listen to [[papist]] counsellors and requesting the names of anyone who had tried to convert her; Anne had replied that there was no need to name names because any such efforts had failed.<ref>Barroll, 25; Stewart, 143.</ref> Anne drew criticism from the Kirk for keeping [[Henrietta Stewart|Henrietta Gordon]], wife of the exiled Catholic [[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly]], as a confidante;<ref>The Countess of Huntly, a strong supporter of the Jesuits, was the daughter of [[Esm\u00e9 Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox]], James' boyhood favourite, who had been hounded out of the country in 1582; she was therefore the sister of [[Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox]]. Williams, 45.</ref> after Huntly's return in 1596, the [[St Andrews]] minister David Black called Anne an [[atheist]] and remarked in a sermon that \"the Queen of Scotland was a woman for whom, for fashion's sake, the clergy might pray but from whom no good could be hoped.\"<ref>Stewart, 144; Williams, 59.</ref>\n\nWhen former intelligencer Sir [[Anthony Standen (spy)|Anthony Standen]] was discovered bringing Anne a rosary from [[Pope Clement VIII]] in 1603, James imprisoned him in the Tower for ten months.<ref>James sent the rosary back to the Pope. Willson, 221\u2013222; Standen had confided to the [[Jesuit]] subversive [[Robert Parsons (priest)|Robert Parsons]] that he was acting in Rome for the Queen. Haynes, 41. Willson assumes this incident is a proof of Anne's Catholicism, Haynes that it represents growing \"Catholic leanings\".</ref> Anne protested her annoyance at the gift, but eventually secured Standen's release.<ref name=\"multiref3\"/>\n\nLike James, Anne later supported a Catholic match for both their sons, and her correspondence with the potential bride, [[Maria Anna of Spain|the Spanish Infanta, Maria Anna]], included a request that two [[friar]]s be sent to [[Jerusalem]] to pray for her and the King.<ref>Willson, 221\u2013222.</ref> The papacy itself was never quite sure where Anne stood; in 1612, [[Pope Paul V]] advised a nuncio: \"Not considering the inconstancy of that Queen and the many changes she had made in religious matters and that even if it might be true that she might be a Catholic, one should not take on oneself any judgement.\"<ref>Williams, 200.</ref>\n\n==Court and politics==\n[[File:Portrait of Anne of Danemark.jpg|thumb|Anne of Denmark, c. 1617, by [[Paul van Somer]]]]\n[[Image:Anne of Denmark Gheeraerts.jpg|thumb| Anne of Denmark, c. 1611-1614, attributed to [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]].]]\nIn Scotland, Anne sometimes exploited court factionalism for her own ends, in particular by supporting the enemies of the [[Earl of Mar]].<ref>Williams, 53.</ref> As a result, James did not trust her with secrets of state. [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Henry Howard]], active in the highly secret diplomacy concerning the English succession, subtly reminded James that though Anne possessed every virtue, [[Eve#Eve in Christianity|Eve]] was corrupted by the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]].<ref>Willson, 156\u20137</ref> Another of James' secret correspondents, [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], believed that \"the Queen was weak and a tool in the hands of clever and unscrupulous persons.\"<ref name=\"auto\">Williams, 93.</ref> In practice, Anne seems to have been little interested in high politics unless they touched on the fate of her children or friends, and later told Secretary of State Robert Cecil that \"she was more contented with her pictures than he with his great employments.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/> However, in November 1600 Robert Cecil had been anxious to find out about correspondence she had with [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Albert]], Governor of the [[Spanish Netherlands]].<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 13 part 2 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 728.</ref>\n\nIn England, Anne largely turned from political to social and artistic activities.<ref>Barroll, 35.</ref> Though she participated fully in the life of James' court and maintained a court of her own, often attracting those not welcomed by James, she rarely took political sides against her husband. Whatever her private difficulties with James, she proved a diplomatic asset to him in England, conducting herself with discretion and graciousness in public. Anne played a crucial role, for example, in conveying to ambassadors and foreign visitors the prestige of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart dynasty]] and its [[House of Oldenburg|Danish connections]].<ref>Croft, 25.</ref>\n\nThe [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] envoy, Nicolo Molin, wrote this description of Anne in 1606: {{cquote|She is intelligent and prudent; and knows the disorders of the government, in which she has no part, though many hold that as the King is most devoted to her, she might play as large a role as she wished. But she is young and averse to trouble; she sees that those who govern desire to be left alone, and so she professes indifference. All she ever does is to beg a favour for someone. She is full of kindness for those who support her, but on the other hand she is terrible, proud, unendurable to those she dislikes.<ref name=\"stew182\"/>}}\n\nAnne's comments did attract attention and were reported by diplomats. In May 1612 the [[Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon|Duke of Bouillon]] came to London as the ambassador of [[Marie de' Medici]], dowager of France. According to the Venetian ambassador, [[Antonio Foscarini]], his instructions included a proposal of marriage between [[Christine of France|Princess Christine]], the second Princess of France, and Prince Henry. Anne told one of his senior companions that she would prefer Prince Henry married a French princess without a dowry than a Florentine princess with any amount of gold.<ref>[https://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/venice/vol12/pp358-366 ''Calendar State Papers Venice: 1610-1613'', vol. 12, (London, 1905), no. 539.]</ref>\n\n===Reputation===\nAnne has traditionally been regarded with condescension by historians, who have emphasised her triviality and extravagance.<ref>Croft, 55.</ref> Along with James, she tended to be dismissed by a historical tradition, beginning with the anti-Stuart historians of the mid-17th century, which saw in the self-indulgence and vanity of the Jacobean court the origins of the [[English civil war]]. Historian David Harris Willson, in his 1956 biography of James, delivered this damning verdict: \"Anne had little influence over her husband. She could not share his intellectual interests, and she confirmed the foolish contempt with which he regarded women. Alas! The king had married a stupid wife.\"<ref>Willson, 95.</ref> The 19th-century biographer [[Agnes Strickland]] condemned Anne's actions to regain custody of Prince Henry as irresponsible: \"It must lower the character of Anne of Denmark in the eyes of everyone, both as a woman and queen, that she&nbsp;... preferred to indulge the mere instincts of maternity at the risk of involving her husband, her infant, and their kingdom, in the strife and misery of unnatural warfare.\"<ref>Strickland (1848), 276.</ref>\n\nHowever, the reassessment of James in the past two decades, as an able ruler who extended royal power in Scotland and preserved his kingdoms from war throughout his reign,<ref>Croft summarizes the elements of this reappraisal in her introduction to ''King James'' (2003).</ref> has been accompanied by a re-evaluation of Anne as an influential political figure and assertive mother, at least for as long as the royal marriage remained a reality.<ref>\"Queen Anne has traditionally been regarded with condescension by male historians who emphasized her extravagance and triviality. Recent studies have pointed instead to her influence, certainly as long as her marriage (despite its obvious frictions) remained alive.\" Croft, 55; \"...&nbsp;the power of Anna's politicised maternity.\" McManus, 82.</ref> John Leeds Barroll argues in his cultural biography of Anne that her political interventions in Scotland were more significant, and certainly more troublesome, than previously noticed; and Clare McManus, among other cultural historians, has highlighted Anne's influential role in the Jacobean cultural flowering, not only as a patron of writers and artists but as a performer herself.<ref>See: Barroll, ''Anna of Denmark, Queen of England: A Cultural Biography'', and Clare McManus, ''Women on the Renaissance Stage: Anna of Denmark and Female Masquing in the Stuart Court (1590\u20131619)''.</ref>\n\n==Patron of the arts==\nAnne shared with James the fault of extravagance, though it took her several years to exhaust her considerable dowry.<ref>Croft, 25; In 1593, James appointed a special Council, known as the \"[[Octavians]]\", to sort out Anne's accounts and make economies. Stewart, 142\u20133.</ref> She loved dancing and pageants, activities often frowned upon in [[Presbyterian]] Scotland, but for which she found a vibrant outlet in [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] London, where she created a \"rich and hospitable\" cultural climate at the royal court,<ref>Barroll, 161; \"The cultural interests of Queen Anne and Prince Henry led to a brief flowering of elegance in the Royal Family.\" Croft, 129.</ref> became an enthusiastic playgoer, and sponsored lavish [[masque]]s.

Barroll, 58.</ref> Anne sometimes performed with her ladies in the masques herself, occasionally offending members of the audience. In ''[[The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses]]'' of 1604, she played [[Athena|Pallas Athena]], wearing a tunic that some observers regarded as too short; in ''[[The Masque of Blackness]]'' of 1605, Anne performed while six months pregnant, she and her ladies causing scandal by appearing with their skin painted as \"blackamores\". Letter writer [[Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester|Dudley Carleton]] reported that when the Queen afterwards danced with the Spanish ambassador, he kissed her hand \"though there was danger it would have left a mark upon his lips\".<ref>Williams, 126; McManus, 2\u20133; After Anne's first masque, [[Samuel Daniel]]'s ''[[The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses]]'', Carleton judged Anne's costume as [[Pallas Athena]] too short because it revealed her legs and feet. In 1605, Anne and her ladies scandalized members of the court by appearing as \"blackamores\" in ''[[The Masque of Blackness]]''. Cerasano, 80; McManus, 4; Anne was six months pregnant when she performed in this masque.

Christian was also sent to be brought up at G\u00fcstrow but two years later, in 1579, his father the King wrote to his parents-in-law, to request the return of his sons, Christian and Ulrich, (probably, at the urging of the Rigsr\u00e5d, the Danish Privy Council), and Anne and Elizabeth returned with him.<ref>Williams, 5.</ref>\n\nAnne enjoyed a close, happy family upbringing in Denmark, thanks largely to Queen Sophie, who nursed the children through their illnesses herself.<ref>Croft, 24; The English agent Daniel Rogers reported to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] that Sophie was \"a right virtuous and godly Princess which with motherly care and great wisdom ruleth her children.\" Williams, 4.</ref> Suitors from all over Europe sought the hands of Anne and Elizabeth in marriage, including [[James VI of Scotland]], who favoured Denmark as a kingdom reformed in religion and a profitable trading partner.<ref name=\"Croft 24\">Croft, 24</ref>\n[[Image:James VI of Scotland aged 20, 1586..jpg|thumb|James VI in 1586, aged twenty, three years before his marriage to Anne.

When James tried to command her, she warned him to take care how he treated her because she was not the Earl of Gowrie.<ref>James Melville, who witnessed the scene, wrote in his diary: \"Foremost among those refraining to believe in the guilt of the two brothers was the Queen herself. She remained in her apartment and refused to be dressed for two days&nbsp;... Although the King receiving full information of his wife's conduct and of the consequences to be drawn from it, he could not be persuaded to take up the matter right, but sought by all means to cover his folly.\" Williams, 63.</ref> James placated her for the moment by paying a famous acrobat to entertain her,<ref>Williams, 63\u20134.</ref> but she never gave up, and her stubborn support for the Ruthvens over the next three years was taken seriously enough by the government to be regarded as a security issue.<ref>Barroll notes a \"politically relentless\" streak in Anne.

Williams, 159.</ref> Her influence over James visibly waned as he became openly dependent on powerful favourites.<ref name=\"croft89\"/>\n\n===Reaction to favourites===\nAlthough James had always adopted male [[favourite]]s among his courtiers, he now encouraged them to play a role in the government. Anne reacted very differently to the two powerful favourites who dominated the second half of her husband's English reign, [[Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset|Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset]], and [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers]], the future Duke of Buckingham. She detested Carr,<ref name=\"croft89\"/> but she encouraged the rise of Villiers, whom James knighted in her bedchamber;<ref>Barroll, 148; [[George Abbot (Archbishop of Canterbury)|Archbishop of Canterbury George Abbot]] and others had pressed Anne to support Villiers' appointment as a [[Gentleman of the Bedchamber]]; at first, she refused, saying, according to Abbot's own account, \"if Villiers get once into his favour, those who shall have most contributed to his preferment will be the first sufferers by him. I shall be no more spared than the rest\"; but Carr's enemies nonetheless persuaded the Queen to advocate for Villiers. Williams, 170; Willson, 352; Stewart, 268\u20139.</ref> and she developed friendly relations with him, calling him her \"dog\".<ref>Williams reproduces a facsimile of a letter from Anne to Villiers which begins: \"My kind dog, I have receaved your letter which is verie wellcom to me yow doe verie well in lugging the sowes eare. {{sic}}\" Williams, plate facing page 152. Villiers wrote back that he had pulled the King's ear until it was as long as any sow's. Williams, 172.</ref> Even so, Anne found herself increasingly ignored after Buckingham's rise and became a lonely figure towards the end of her life.<ref>Croft, 100.</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n[[Image:Anne of Denmark by Paul Van Somer.jpg|left|thumb|Anne of Denmark, c. 1616, by [[Paul van Somer]]]]\n\nA further source of difference between Anne and James was the issue of religion; for example, she abstained from the [[Anglican]] [[Eucharist|communion]] at her English coronation.<ref>Willson takes Anne's abstention as a sign of Catholicism; McManus cautions that it may have signalled reformed-church distrust of the [[Eucharist]]. Willson, 221; McManus, 92\u201393.</ref> Anne had been brought up a [[Lutheran]], and had a Lutheran chaplain [[Hans Sering]] in her household, but she may have discreetly converted to [[Catholicism]] at some point, a politically embarrassing scenario which alarmed ministers of the Scottish [[Kirk]] and caused suspicion in Anglican England.<ref>Historians are divided on whether Anne ever converted to Catholicism. \"Some time in the 1590s, Anne became a Roman Catholic.\" Willson, 95; \"Some time after 1600, but well before March 1603, Queen Anne was received into the Catholic Church in a secret chamber in the royal palace\". Fraser, 15; \"The Queen&nbsp;... [converted] from her native Lutheranism to a discreet, but still politically embarrassing Catholicism which alienated many ministers of the Kirk.\" Croft, 24\u20135; \"Catholic foreign ambassadors\u2014who would surely have welcomed such a situation\u2014were certain that the Queen was beyond their reach. 'She is a Lutheran', concluded the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] envoy Nicolo Molin in 1606.\" Stewart, 182; \"In 1602 a report appeared, claiming that Anne&nbsp;... had converted to the Catholic faith some years before. The author of this report, the Scottish [[Jesuit]] [[Robert Abercromby (missionary)|Robert Abercromby]], testified that James had received his wife's desertion with equanimity, commenting, 'Well, wife, if you cannot live without this sort of thing, do your best to keep things as quiet as possible.' Anne would, indeed, keep her religious beliefs as quiet as possible: for the remainder of her life \u2014 even after her death\u2014they remained obfuscated.\" Hogge, 303\u20134.</ref>\n\nQueen Elizabeth had certainly been worried about the possibility and sent messages to Anne warning her not to listen to [[papist]] counsellors and requesting the names of anyone who had tried to convert her; Anne had replied that there was no need to name names because any such efforts had failed.<ref>Barroll, 25; Stewart, 143.</ref> Anne drew criticism from the Kirk for keeping [[Henrietta Stewart|Henrietta Gordon]], wife of the exiled Catholic [[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly]], as a confidante;<ref>The Countess of Huntly, a strong supporter of the Jesuits, was the daughter of [[Esm\u00e9 Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox]], James' boyhood favourite, who had been hounded out of the country in 1582; she was therefore the sister of [[Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox]]. Williams, 45.</ref> after Huntly's return in 1596, the [[St Andrews]] minister David Black called Anne an [[atheist]] and remarked in a sermon that \"the Queen of Scotland was a woman for whom, for fashion's sake, the clergy might pray but from whom no good could be hoped.\"<ref>Stewart, 144; Williams, 59.</ref>\n\nWhen former intelligencer Sir [[Anthony Standen (spy)|Anthony Standen]] was discovered bringing Anne a rosary from [[Pope Clement VIII]] in 1603, James imprisoned him in the Tower for ten months.<ref>James sent the rosary back to the Pope. Willson, 221\u2013222; Standen had confided to the [[Jesuit]] subversive [[Robert Parsons (priest)|Robert Parsons]] that he was acting in Rome for the Queen. Haynes, 41. Willson assumes this incident is a proof of Anne's Catholicism, Haynes that it represents growing \"Catholic leanings\".</ref> Anne protested her annoyance at the gift, but eventually secured Standen's release.<ref name=\"multiref3\"/>\n\nLike James, Anne later supported a Catholic match for both their sons, and her correspondence with the potential bride, [[Maria Anna of Spain|the Spanish Infanta, Maria Anna]], included a request that two [[friar]]s be sent to [[Jerusalem]] to pray for her and the King.<ref>Willson, 221\u2013222.</ref> The papacy itself was never quite sure where Anne stood; in 1612, [[Pope Paul V]] advised a nuncio: \"Not considering the inconstancy of that Queen and the many changes she had made in religious matters and that even if it might be true that she might be a Catholic, one should not take on oneself any judgement.\"<ref>Williams, 200.</ref>\n\n==Court and politics==\n[[File:Portrait of Anne of Danemark.jpg|thumb|Anne of Denmark, c. 1617, by [[Paul van Somer]]]]\n[[Image:Anne of Denmark Gheeraerts.jpg|thumb| Anne of Denmark, c. 1611-1614, attributed to [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]].]]\nIn Scotland, Anne sometimes exploited court factionalism for her own ends, in particular by supporting the enemies of the [[Earl of Mar]].<ref>Williams, 53.</ref> As a result, James did not trust her with secrets of state. [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Henry Howard]], active in the highly secret diplomacy concerning the English succession, subtly reminded James that though Anne possessed every virtue, [[Eve#Eve in Christianity|Eve]] was corrupted by the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]].<ref>Willson, 156\u20137</ref> Another of James' secret correspondents, [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], believed that \"the Queen was weak and a tool in the hands of clever and unscrupulous persons.\"<ref name=\"auto\">Williams, 93.</ref> In practice, Anne seems to have been little interested in high politics unless they touched on the fate of her children or friends, and later told Secretary of State Robert Cecil that \"she was more contented with her pictures than he with his great employments.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/> However, in November 1600 Robert Cecil had been anxious to find out about correspondence she had with [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Albert]], Governor of the [[Spanish Netherlands]].<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 13 part 2 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 728.</ref>\n\nIn England, Anne largely turned from political to social and artistic activities.<ref>Barroll, 35.</ref> Though she participated fully in the life of James' court and maintained a court of her own, often attracting those not welcomed by James, she rarely took political sides against her husband. Whatever her private difficulties with James, she proved a diplomatic asset to him in England, conducting herself with discretion and graciousness in public. Anne played a crucial role, for example, in conveying to ambassadors and foreign visitors the prestige of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart dynasty]] and its [[House of Oldenburg|Danish connections]].<ref>Croft, 25.</ref>\n\nThe [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] envoy, Nicolo Molin, wrote this description of Anne in 1606: {{cquote|She is intelligent and prudent; and knows the disorders of the government, in which she has no part, though many hold that as the King is most devoted to her, she might play as large a role as she wished. But she is young and averse to trouble; she sees that those who govern desire to be left alone, and so she professes indifference. All she ever does is to beg a favour for someone. She is full of kindness for those who support her, but on the other hand she is terrible, proud, unendurable to those she dislikes.<ref name=\"stew182\"/>}}\n\nAnne's comments did attract attention and were reported by diplomats. In May 1612 the [[Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon|Duke of Bouillon]] came to London as the ambassador of [[Marie de' Medici]], dowager of France. According to the Venetian ambassador, [[Antonio Foscarini]], his instructions included a proposal of marriage between [[Christine of France|Princess Christine]], the second Princess of France, and Prince Henry. Anne told one of his senior companions that she would prefer Prince Henry married a French princess without a dowry than a Florentine princess with any amount of gold.<ref>[https://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/venice/vol12/pp358-366 ''Calendar State Papers Venice: 1610-1613'', vol. 12, (London, 1905), no. 539.</ref>\n\n===Reputation===\nAnne has traditionally been regarded with condescension by historians, who have emphasised her triviality and extravagance.<ref>Croft, 55.</ref> Along with James, she tended to be dismissed by a historical tradition, beginning with the anti-Stuart historians of the mid-17th century, which saw in the self-indulgence and vanity of the Jacobean court the origins of the [[English civil war]]. Historian David Harris Willson, in his 1956 biography of James, delivered this damning verdict: \"Anne had little influence over her husband. She could not share his intellectual interests, and she confirmed the foolish contempt with which he regarded women. Alas! The king had married a stupid wife.\"<ref>Willson, 95.</ref> The 19th-century biographer [[Agnes Strickland]] condemned Anne's actions to regain custody of Prince Henry as irresponsible: \"It must lower the character of Anne of Denmark in the eyes of everyone, both as a woman and queen, that she&nbsp;... preferred to indulge the mere instincts of maternity at the risk of involving her husband, her infant, and their kingdom, in the strife and misery of unnatural warfare.\"<ref>Strickland (1848), 276.</ref>\n\nHowever, the reassessment of James in the past two decades, as an able ruler who extended royal power in Scotland and preserved his kingdoms from war throughout his reign,<ref>Croft summarizes the elements of this reappraisal in her introduction to ''King James'' (2003).</ref> has been accompanied by a re-evaluation of Anne as an influential political figure and assertive mother, at least for as long as the royal marriage remained a reality.<ref>\"Queen Anne has traditionally been regarded with condescension by male historians who emphasized her extravagance and triviality. Recent studies have pointed instead to her influence, certainly as long as her marriage (despite its obvious frictions) remained alive.\" Croft, 55; \"...&nbsp;the power of Anna's politicised maternity.\" McManus, 82.</ref> John Leeds Barroll argues in his cultural biography of Anne that her political interventions in Scotland were more significant, and certainly more troublesome, than previously noticed; and Clare McManus, among other cultural historians, has highlighted Anne's influential role in the Jacobean cultural flowering, not only as a patron of writers and artists but as a performer herself.<ref>See: Barroll, ''Anna of Denmark, Queen of England: A Cultural Biography'', and Clare McManus, ''Women on the Renaissance Stage: Anna of Denmark and Female Masquing in the Stuart Court (1590\u20131619)''.</ref>\n\n==Patron of the arts==\nAnne shared with James the fault of extravagance, though it took her several years to exhaust her considerable dowry.<ref>Croft, 25; In 1593, James appointed a special Council, known as the \"[[Octavians]]\", to sort out Anne's accounts and make economies. Stewart, 142\u20133.</ref> She loved dancing and pageants, activities often frowned upon in [[Presbyterian]] Scotland, but for which she found a vibrant outlet in [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] London, where she created a \"rich and hospitable\" cultural climate at the royal court,<ref>Barroll, 161; \"The cultural interests of Queen Anne and Prince Henry led to a brief flowering of elegance in the Royal Family.\" Croft, 129.</ref> became an enthusiastic playgoer, and sponsored lavish [[masque]]s. [[Walter Cope|Sir Walter Cope]], asked by Robert Cecil to select a play for the Queen during her brother [[Ulrik of Denmark (1578\u20131624)|Ulrik of Holstein]]'s visit, wrote, \"Burbage is come and says there is no new play the Queen has not seen but they have revived an old one called ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' which for wit and mirth he says will please her exceedingly.\"<ref>Williams, 99; This Burbage was probably [[Cuthbert Burbage]], brother of [[Richard Burbage]]. McCrea, 119; Ackroyd, 411.</ref> Anne's masques, scaling unprecedented heights of dramatic staging and spectacle,<ref>Croft, 2\u20133, 56; \"The allure of these elaborate, expensive pieces of theatre is by no means clear from their surviving scripts, suggesting that their appeal lay instead in the design of their sets and costumes, in their special effects, in their music and dancing, and in the novelty of having royalty and nobility performing on stage.\" Stewart, 183; \"These spectacles lasted (not counting rehearsals) for the space of only one night a year and were not even performed every year of her reign. Thus, although surveys of the period define James' Queen via these masquings, they were, in the end, only the tip of the iceberg.\" Barroll, 58.</ref> were avidly attended by foreign ambassadors and dignitaries and functioned as a potent demonstration of the English crown's European significance. Zorzi Giustinian, the Venetian ambassador, wrote of the Christmas 1604 masque that \"in everyone's opinion no other Court could have displayed such pomp and riches\".<ref>Barroll, 108\u20139.</ref>\n[[Image:Queens House.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Queen's House]] at Greenwich, begun for Anne in 1616]]\nAnne's masques were responsible for almost all the courtly female performance in the first two decades of the 17th-century and are regarded as crucial to the history of women's performance.<ref>McManus, 3; Barroll uses the extant masque lists from 1603\u201310 to identify the noblewomen of Anne's inner circle. Barroll, 58.</ref> Anne sometimes performed with her ladies in the masques herself, occasionally offending members of the audience. In ''[[The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses]]'' of 1604, she played [[Athena|Pallas Athena]], wearing a tunic that some observers regarded as too short; in ''[[The Masque of Blackness]]'' of 1605, Anne performed while six months pregnant, she and her ladies causing scandal by appearing with their skin painted as \"blackamores\". Letter writer [[Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester|Dudley Carleton]] reported that when the Queen afterwards danced with the Spanish ambassador, he kissed her hand \"though there was danger it would have left a mark upon his lips\".<ref>Williams, 126; McManus, 2\u20133; After Anne's first masque, [[Samuel Daniel]]'s ''[[The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses]]'', Carleton judged Anne's costume as [[Pallas Athena]] too short because it revealed her legs and feet. In 1605, Anne and her ladies scandalized members of the court by appearing as \"blackamores\" in ''[[The Masque of Blackness]]''. Cerasano, 80; McManus, 4; Anne was six months pregnant when she performed in this masque. McManus, 11.</ref> Anne commissioned the leading talents of the day to create these masques, including [[Ben Jonson]] and [[Inigo Jones]].<ref>Croft, 56; \"The part she played in promoting the fortunes of Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones has never been sufficiently recognised.\" Williams, 124. Other writers employed by Anne included [[Samuel Daniel]], [[Thomas Campion]] and [[John Donne]]. Williams, 157; Stewart, 183.</ref>\n\nJones, a gifted architect steeped in the latest European taste, also designed the [[Queen's House]] at Greenwich for Anne, one of the first true [[Palladian]] buildings in England;<ref>Croft, 3; Probably, the first floor was finished at Anne's death. Williams, 181.</ref> and the Dutch inventor [[Salomon de Caus]] laid out her gardens at Greenwich and Somerset House.

[[AllMusic]] defines industrial music as the \"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of [[rock music|rock]] and [[electronic music]]\" that was \"initially a blend of [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] electronics experiments ([[tape music]], [[musique concr\u00e8te]], [[white noise]], [[synthesizer]]s, [[music sequencer|sequencer]]s, etc.) and [[punk rock|punk]] provocation\".<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=style|id=ma0000002658|pure_url=yes}}|title=Industrial|work=Allmusic|publisher=All Media Network|access-date=2017-05-05|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of [[Industrial Records]] by members of [[Throbbing Gristle]] and [[Monte Cazazza]]. While the genre name originated with Throbbing Gristle's emergence in the [[United Kingdom]], concentrations of artists and labels vital to the genre also emerged in [[United States|America]], namely in [[Chicago]].\n\nThe first industrial artists experimented with [[noise music|noise]] and aesthetically controversial topics, musically and visually, such as [[fascism]], [[sexual perversion]], and the [[occult]]. Prominent industrial musicians include Throbbing Gristle, [[Monte Cazazza]], [[SPK (band)|SPK]], [[Boyd Rice]], [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], and [[Z'EV]].<ref name=Handbook>V.Vale. ''[[Industrial Culture Handbook|Re/Search #6/7: Industrial Culture Handbook]]'', 1983.</ref> On Throbbing Gristle's 1977 debut album ''[[The Second Annual Report]]'', they coined the slogan \"industrial music for industrial people\". Chicago-based independent label [[Wax Trax Records]] featured a heavy roster of industrial music acts. The precursors that influenced the development of the genre included acts such as electronic music group [[Kraftwerk]], [[experimental rock]] acts such as [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Frank Zappa]], [[psychedelic rock]] artists such as [[Jimi Hendrix]], and composers such as [[John Cage]]. Musicians also cite writers such as [[William S. Burroughs]], and philosophers such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] as influences.\n\nWhile the term was self-applied by a small coterie of groups and individuals associated with Industrial Records in the late 1970s, it was broadened to include artists influenced by the original movement or using an \"industrial\" aesthetic.<ref>\"... journalists now use 'industrial' as a term like they would 'blues.'\"\u2014Genesis P-Orridge, ''RE/Search'' #6/7, p. 16.</ref> Over time, the genre's influence spread into and blended with styles including [[ambient music|ambient]], synth music and rock such as [[Front 242]], [[Front Line Assembly]], and [[Sister Machine Gun]] from the Chicago-based Wax Trax Records. [[Electro-industrial]] music is a primary subgenre that developed in the 1980s. The two other most notable hybrid genres are [[industrial rock]] and [[industrial metal]], which include bands such as [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Skinny Puppy]], and [[KMFDM]], the first two of which released platinum-selling albums in the [[1990s in music|1990s]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Precursors===\n[[File:Frank Zappa - Capt. Beefheart.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Frank Zappa]] and [[Captain Beefheart]] in 1975, cited as inspirations by Herman Taylor]]\nIndustrial music drew from a broad range of predecessors. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the genre was first named in 1942 when ''[[The Musical Quarterly]]'' called [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Dmitri Shostakovich's]] 1927 [[Symphony No. 2 (Shostakovich)|Symphony No. 2]] \"the high tide of 'industrial music'.\"<ref name=OED1>{{Cite OED|term=Industrial}}</ref> Similarly, in 1972 ''[[The New York Times]]'' described works by [[Ferde Grof\u00e9]] (especially 1935's ''A Symphony in Steel'') as a part of \"his 'industrial music' genre [that] called on such instruments as four pairs of shoes, two brooms, a locomotive bell, a pneumatric drill and a compressed-air tank\".<ref name=\"NYT1\">{{cite journal |last1=Henahan |first1=Donal |title=Limned the Landscape |journal=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 4, 1972 |page=46 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/04/archives/limned-the-landscape.html |accessdate=November 17, 2018}}</ref> Though these compositions are not directly tied to what the genre would become, they are early examples of music designed to mimic machinery noise and factory atmosphere.\n\nIn his book ''Interrogation Machine: Laibach and NSK'', Alexei Monroe argues that [[Kraftwerk]] were particularly significant in the development of industrial music, as the \"first successful artists to incorporate representations of industrial sounds into nonacademic electronic music.\"<ref name=monroe>Monroe, p. 212</ref> Industrial music was created originally by using mechanical and electric machinery, and later advanced synthesizers, samplers and electronic percussion as the technology developed. Monroe also argues for [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]] as an influential contemporary of the industrial musicians.<ref name=monroe/> Groups cited as inspirational by the founders of industrial music include [[The Velvet Underground]], [[Joy Division]], and [[Martin Denny]].<ref>''RE/Search'' #6/7, p. 11\u201312.</ref> [[Genesis P-Orridge]] of [[Throbbing Gristle]] had a cassette library including recordings by the [[Master Musicians of Jajouka]], Kraftwerk, [[Charles Manson]], and [[William S.

The label went on to distribute some of the most prominent names in industrial throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Wax Trax! also distributed industrial releases in the United States for the Belgium record label Play It Again Sam Records, and had opened a North American office dubbed Play It Again Sam U.S.A. as a division of Wax Trax!. Wax Trax! was subsequently purchased by [[TVT Records]] in 1992.

[[AllMusic]] defines industrial music as the \"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of [[rock music|rock]] and [[electronic music]]\" that was \"initially a blend of [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] electronics experiments ([[tape music]], [[musique concr\u00e8te]], [[white noise]], [[synthesizer]]s, [[music sequencer|sequencer]]s, etc.) and [[punk rock|punk]] provocation\".<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=style|id=ma0000002658|pure_url=yes}}|title=Industrial|work=Allmusic|publisher=All Media Network|access-date=2017-05-05|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of [[Industrial Records]] by members of [[Throbbing Gristle]] and [[Monte Cazazza]]. While the genre name originated with Throbbing Gristle's emergence in the [[United Kingdom]], concentrations of artists and labels vital to the genre also emerged in [[United States|America]], namely in [[Chicago]].\n\nThe first industrial artists experimented with [[noise music|noise]] and aesthetically controversial topics, musically and visually, such as [[fascism]], [[sexual perversion]], and the [[occult]]. Prominent industrial musicians include Throbbing Gristle, [[Monte Cazazza]], [[SPK (band)|SPK]], [[Boyd Rice]], [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], and [[Z'EV]].<ref name=Handbook>V.Vale. ''[[Industrial Culture Handbook|Re/Search #6/7: Industrial Culture Handbook]]'', 1983.</ref> On Throbbing Gristle's 1977 debut album ''[[The Second Annual Report]]'', they coined the slogan \"industrial music for industrial people\". Chicago-based independent label [[Wax Trax Records]] featured a heavy roster of industrial music acts. The precursors that influenced the development of the genre included acts such as electronic music group [[Kraftwerk]], [[experimental rock]] acts such as [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Frank Zappa]], [[psychedelic rock]] artists such as [[Jimi Hendrix]], and composers such as [[John Cage]]. Musicians also cite writers such as [[William S. Burroughs]], and philosophers such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] as influences.\n\nWhile the term was self-applied by a small coterie of groups and individuals associated with Industrial Records in the late 1970s, it was broadened to include artists influenced by the original movement or using an \"industrial\" aesthetic.<ref>\"... journalists now use 'industrial' as a term like they would 'blues.'\"\u2014Genesis P-Orridge, ''RE/Search'' #6/7, p. 16.</ref> Over time, the genre's influence spread into and blended with styles including [[ambient music|ambient]], synth music and rock such as [[Front 242]], [[Front Line Assembly]], and [[Sister Machine Gun]] from the Chicago-based Wax Trax Records. [[Electro-industrial]] music is a primary subgenre that developed in the 1980s. The two other most notable hybrid genres are [[industrial rock]] and [[industrial metal]], which include bands such as [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Skinny Puppy]], and [[KMFDM]], the first two of which released platinum-selling albums in the [[1990s in music|1990s]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Precursors===\n[[File:Frank Zappa - Capt.

Industrial Records intended the term ''industrial'' to evoke the idea of music created for a new generation, with previous music being more ''agricultural'': P-Orridge stated that \"there's an irony in the word 'industrial' because there's the music ''industry''. And then there's the joke we often used to make in interviews about churning out our records like motorcars \u2014''that'' sense of industrial. And ... up till then the music had been kind of based on the [[blues]] and slavery, and we thought it was time to update it to at least Victorian times\u2014you know, the [[Industrial Revolution]]\".<ref>''RE/Search'' #6/7, pp. 9\u201310.</ref>\n[[Image:Burroughs1983 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William S. Burroughs]], a conceptual inspiration for the industrial musicians]]\nEarly industrial music often featured tape editing, stark percussion and loops distorted to the point where they had degraded to harsh noise, such as the work of early industrial group [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], which journalist Simon Reynolds described as characterized by \"hissing high hats and squelchy snares of rhythm-generator.\"{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=168|ref=Reynolds}}  Carter of Throbbing Gristle invented a device named the \"Gristle-izer\", played by Christopherson, which comprised a one-octave keyboard and a number of cassette machines triggering various pre-recorded sounds.{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=228|ref=Reynolds}}\n\nTraditional instruments were often played in nontraditional or highly modified ways. Reynolds described the Cabaret Voltaire members' individual contributions as \"[[Chris Watson (musician)|[Chris] Watson]]'s smears of synth slime; [[Stephen Mallinder|[Stephen] Mallinder]]'s dankly pulsing bass; and [[Richard H. Kirk|[Richard H.] Kirk]]'s spikes of shattered-glass guitar.\"{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=168|ref=Reynolds}} Watson custom-built a fuzzbox for Kirk's guitar, producing a unique [[timbre]].{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|pp=169\u2013170|ref=Reynolds}} Carter built speakers, effects units, and synthesizer modules, as well as modifying more conventional rock instrumentation, for Throbbing Gristle.{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=227|ref=Reynolds}} Tutti played guitar with a slide in order to produce [[glissando|glissandi]], or pounded the strings as if it were a percussion instrument.{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=230|ref=Reynolds}} Throbbing Gristle also played at very high volume and produced ultra-high and sub-bass frequencies in an attempt to produce physical effects, naming this approach as \"metabolic music.\"{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=235|ref=Reynolds}}\n\nVocals were sporadic, and were as likely to be [[bubblegum pop]] as they were to be abrasive [[polemic]]s. Cabaret Voltaire's Stephen Mallinder's vocals were electronically treated.{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=170|ref=Reynolds}}\n\nThe purpose of industrial music initially was to serve as a commentary on modern society by eschewing what artists saw as trite connections to the past.<ref name=\"industrial records\">{{cite web | url=http://brainwashed.com/tg/industrial.html | title=Industrial Records: Industrial Music for Industrial People | publisher=Brainwashed Inc. | accessdate=April 16, 2010}}</ref> Throbbing Gristle opposed the elements of traditional rock music remaining in the [[punk rock]] scene, declaring industrial to be \"anti-music.\"{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=230|ref=Reynolds}} Early industrial performances often involved [[taboo]]-breaking, provocative elements, such as [[mutilation]], [[sado-masochistic]] elements and [[totalitarian]] imagery or symbolism, as well as forms of audience abuse,<ref name=\"RE/Search #6/7, p. 5\">''RE/Search'' #6/7, p.&nbsp;5.</ref> such as Throbbing Gristle's aiming high powered lights at the audience.<ref name=\"ford 8.10\">Ford, 8.10</ref>\n\nIndustrial groups typically focus on [[transgressive art|transgressive]] subject matter. In his introduction for the ''[[Industrial Culture Handbook]]'' (1983), [[Jon Savage]] considered some hallmarks of industrial music to be organizational autonomy, shock tactics, and the use of synthesizers and \"anti-music.\"<ref name=\"RE/Search #6/7, p. 5\"/> Furthermore, an interest in the investigation of \"[[cult]]s, wars, psychological techniques of persuasion, unusual murders (especially by children and [[psychopaths]]), [[forensic pathology]], [[venereology]], [[concentration camp]] behavior, the history of [[uniforms]] and insignia\" and [[Aleister Crowley]]'s ''[[magick (Aleister Crowley)|magick]]'' was present in Throbbing Gristle's work,<ref>''RE/Search'' #6/7, p. 9.</ref> as well as in other industrial pioneers.

It was the third year that [[Liam Buckley]] is the team's manager (in his current spell), following replacing [[Pete Mahon]] in December 2011. The Saints finished the previous season as the [[2013 League of Ireland Premier Division|2013 champions]]. The season was very successful on the field as the Saints began by winning the inaugural [[2014 President of Ireland's Cup|President's Cup]] and the [[2013\u201314 Leinster Senior Cup|Leinster Senior Cup]]. The biggest triumph of all however was when top scorer [[Christy Fagan]] wrote himself into the club's history books by scoring twice in a 2\u20130 win over [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] in the [[2014 FAI Cup Final]], ending a 53-year hoodoo with the cup for the club.. Pats also competed in the [[2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]], the [[2014 Setanta Sports Cup|Setanta Cup]] and the [[2014 League of Ireland Cup|League of Ireland

their 63rd consecutive season in the [[League of Ireland]] top division. It was the third year that [[Liam Buckley]] is the teams manager (in his current spell), following replacing [[Pete Mahon]] in December 2011. The Saints finished the previous season as the [[2013 League of Ireland Premier Division|2013 champions]]. The season was very successful on the field as the Saints began by winning the inaugural [[2014 President of Ireland's Cup|President's Cup]] and the [[2013\u201314 Leinster Senior Cup|Leinster Senior Cup]]. The biggest triumph of all however was when top scorer [[Christy Fagan]] wrote himself into the club's history books by scoring twice in a 2\u20130 win over [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] in the [[2014 FAI Cup Final]], ending a 53-year hoodoo with the cup for the club.. Pats also competed in the [[2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]], the [[2014 Setanta Sports Cup|Setanta Cup]] and the [[2014 League of Ireland Cup|League of Ireland Cup]].\n\n==Squad==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; width:85%;\"\n|-\n!  style=\"background:#d50000; color:white\" text-align:center;\"| No.\n!
