Timberlake co-wrote the song with its producers, [[The Neptunes]] (consisting of [[Chad Hugo]] and [[Pharrell Williams]]). [[Jive Records]] released the track on April 8, 2003 as the third single from ''Justified''. Originally intended to be featured on [[Michael Jackson]]'s tenth studio album ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]'' (2001), Jackson rejected the song along with several other tracks, which were instead given to Timberlake for his debut album. It is an uptempo, [[disco]] [[Groove (music)|groove]], [[Soul music|soul]] infused song containing influences from Jackson and [[Stevie Wonder]].\n\nThe song received generally positive reviews, with [[Music journalism|music critics]] noting it as a stand-out track, while complimenting its musical elements. \"Rock Your Body\" topped the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Singles Chart]]. It peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and became the third single from ''Justified'' to do so, following \"[[Like I Love You]]\" and \"[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]\". It also charted at number five on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) for sales of 500,000 and 400,000 copies, respectively.\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Rock Your Body\", which was directed by [[Francis Lawrence]], features Timberlake with several back-up dancers performing choreography within a multi-color lighted cube. Timberlake performed the song live several times, including the highly controversial performance at the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show]] with [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Janet Jackson]], referred to as a \"[[wardrobe malfunction]]\".\n\n==Writing and recording==\n\"Rock Your Body\" was written by Timberlake, and its producers Hugo and Williams.<ref name=\"Notes\">{{cite AV media notes|others=Justin Timberlake|title=[[Justified (album)|Justified]]|year=2002|type= inlay cover|publisher= [[Jive Records]]}}</ref> It was recorded at Master Sound Recording Studios and Windmark Recording, both located in [[Virginia Beach]] with Andrew Coleman serving as a [[recording engineer]].<ref name=\"Notes\"/> It was [[Mixing (music production)|mixed]] by Serban Ghenea at Windmark Recording, with Daniel Botancourt and Tim Roberts aiding as additional engineers.<ref name=\"Notes\"/> John Hanes provided additional Pro Tools engineering.

The video inter-cuts to Justin Timberlake singing to the song. Timberlake then floats to the floor from an opening in the cubic's ceiling, performing choreography with his supporting dancers and singing to the track's first verse. Throughout the video, it inter-cuts to Timberlake dancing by himself, with the sections sometimes featuring the camera panning around Timberlake's face. Entering the second verse, Timberlake is in the cube on his own, manipulating the motion of the cube with his hands, with his legs following the moving platform. Timberlake then returns performing choreography again with his dancers.\n\nFollowing the second chorus, Timberlake is dancing with a female ([[Staci Flood]]), who lip syncs Vanessa Marquez's section. A break-down of the song, where Timberlake is [[beatboxing]], shows him dancing by himself. The first beatboxing section of the song is only available in the music video version; the audio version doesn't include the first beatboxing part. The breakdown then ends, with the video continuing with Timberlake and his back-up dancers. The closing beat boxing section of the track features the camera panning around several duplicates of Timberlake beatboxing and talking in sync to the song's lyrics. The video ends with the final Timberlake duplicate pointing and running towards the opposite direction.\n\n==Live performances==\nJustin Timberlake performed \"Rock Your Body\" during his [[Justified World Tour]] and the [[Christina Aguilera]] conjoint tour [[Justified & Stripped Tour]], both in support of his debut album ''Justified''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/justin-timberlake/15661|title=JT returns to the UK|date=December 2, 2003|work=NME|publisher=IPC Media|accessdate=May 19, 2013}}</ref> Timberlake performed the song live on the sketch comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in October 2003, where he served as host and musical guest.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Justin Timberlake |episodelink= |series=Saturday Night Live |serieslink= |credits= |network=[[NBC]] |station= |airdate=2003-10-11 |season=[[Saturday Night Live (season 29)|29]] |seriesno= |number=547 |minutes=90-92 }}</ref> On February 1, 2004, Timberlake performed the song with [[pop music|pop]] singer [[Janet Jackson]] during her performance at the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show]].<ref name=\"apologeticjackson\">{{cite news|title=Apologetic Jackson says 'costume reveal' went awry|publisher= [[CNN|CNN.com]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=February 3, 2004|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/02/02/superbowl.jackson/|accessdate=July 27, 2007}}</ref> At the moment he sang the lyric \"I'll have you naked by the end of this song,\" the singer ripped off part of Jackson's outfit, momentarily exposing her right [[breast]] on live television.<ref name=\"apologeticjackson\"/> Timberlake distanced himself from the controversy while Jackson faced much criticism and backlash.

Timberlake co-wrote the song with its producers, [[The Neptunes]] (consisting of [[Chad Hugo]] and [[Pharrell Williams]]). [[Jive Records]] released the track on April 8, 2003 as the third single from ''Justified''. Originally intended to be featured on [[Michael Jackson]]'s tenth studio album ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]'' (2001), Jackson rejected the song along with several other tracks, which were instead given to Timberlake for his debut album. It is an uptempo, [[disco]] [[Groove (music)|groove]], [[Soul music|soul]] infused song containing influences from Jackson and [[Stevie Wonder]].\n\nThe song received generally positive reviews, with [[Music journalism|music critics]] noting it as a stand-out track, while complimenting its musical elements. \"Rock Your Body\" topped the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Singles Chart]]. It peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and became the third single from ''Justified'' to do so, following \"[[Like I Love You]]\" and \"[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]\". It also charted at number five on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) for sales of 500,000 and 400,000 copies, respectively.\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Rock Your Body\", which was directed by [[Francis Lawrence]], features Timberlake with several back-up dancers performing choreography within a multi-color lighted cube. Timberlake performed the song live several times, including the highly controversial performance at the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show]] with [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Janet Jackson]], referred to as a \"[[wardrobe malfunction]]\".\n\n==Writing and recording==\n\"Rock Your Body\" was written by Timberlake, and its producers Hugo and Williams.<ref name=\"Notes\">{{cite AV media notes|others=Justin Timberlake|title=[[Justified (album)|Justified]]|year=2002|type= inlay cover|publisher= [[Jive Records]]}}</ref> It was recorded at Master Sound Recording Studios and Windmark Recording, both located in [[Virginia Beach]] with Andrew Coleman serving as a [[recording engineer]].<ref name=\"Notes\"/> It was [[Mixing (music production)|mixed]] by Serban Ghenea at Windmark Recording, with Daniel Botancourt and Tim Roberts aiding as additional engineers.<ref name=\"Notes\"/> John Hanes provided additional Pro Tools engineering.

The video inter-cuts to Justin Timberlake singing to the song. Timberlake then floats to the floor from an opening in the cubic's ceiling, performing choreography with his supporting dancers and singing to the track's first verse. Throughout the video, it inter-cuts to Timberlake dancing by himself, with the sections sometimes featuring the camera panning around Timberlake's face. Entering the second verse, Timberlake is in the cube on his own, manipulating the motion of the cube with his hands, with his legs following the moving platform. Timberlake then returns performing choreography again with his dancers.\n\nFollowing the second chorus, Timberlake is dancing with a female ([[Staci Flood]]), who lip syncs Vanessa Marquez's section. A break-down of the song, where Timberlake is [[beatboxing]], shows him dancing by himself. The first beatboxing section of the song is only available in the music video version; the audio version doesn't include the first beatboxing part. The breakdown then ends, with the video continuing with Timberlake and his back-up dancers. The closing beat boxing section of the track features the camera panning around several duplicates of Timberlake beatboxing and talking in sync to the song's lyrics. The video ends with the final Timberlake duplicate pointing and running towards the opposite direction.\n\n==Live performances==\nJustin Timberlake performed \"Rock Your Body\" during his [[Justified World Tour]] and the [[Christina Aguilera]] conjoint tour [[Justified & Stripped Tour]], both in support of his debut album ''Justified''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/justin-timberlake/15661|title=JT returns to the UK|date=December 2, 2003|work=NME|publisher=IPC Media|accessdate=May 19, 2013}}</ref> Timberlake performed the song live on the sketch comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in October 2003, where he served as host and musical guest.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Justin Timberlake |episodelink= |series=Saturday Night Live |serieslink= |credits= |network=[[NBC]] |station= |airdate=2003-10-11 |season=[[Saturday Night Live (season 29)|29]] |seriesno= |number=547 |minutes=90-92 }}</ref> On February 1, 2004, Timberlake performed the song with [[pop music|pop]] singer [[Janet Jackson]] during her performance at the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show]].<ref name=\"apologeticjackson\">{{cite news|title=Apologetic Jackson says 'costume reveal' went awry|publisher= [[CNN|CNN.com]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=February 3, 2004|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/02/02/superbowl.jackson/|accessdate=July 27, 2007}}</ref> At the moment he sang the lyric \"I'll have you naked by the end of this song,\" the singer ripped off part of Jackson's outfit, momentarily exposing her right [[breast]] on live television.<ref name=\"apologeticjackson\"/> Timberlake distanced himself from the controversy while Jackson faced much criticism and backlash.

It was released on February 15, 1984 by [[Sire Records]] as the album's fifth [[Single (music)|single]]. Written and composed by its producer [[Reggie Lucas]], the song was remixed by Madonna's then-boyfriend [[John Benitez|John \"Jellybean\" Benitez]]. The singer used refined and expressive vocals to deliver lyrics about an unfulfilled love.\n\nContemporary critics and authors applauded the song, calling it harmonically the most complex track from ''Madonna'' and praising its [[dance-pop]] nature. In the United States, \"Borderline\" became Madonna's first top-ten hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number ten in June 1984. In the United Kingdom, it peaked at number two after it was re-released as a single in 1986. Elsewhere, the song reached the top 10 or 20 in numerous European nations, while topping the singles chart of Ireland. \"Borderline\" placed number 84 on ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' magazine's list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born,\" while ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' included it on their critics list of \"All-Time 100 Songs.\"\n\nThe accompanying [[music video]] portrayed Madonna with a Latin-American man as her boyfriend to whom she returns after being enticed to pose and model for a British photographer. The video generated academic interest for its use of power as symbolism. The video, in heavy rotation on [[MTV]], was instrumental in establishing Madonna's early success, and she was credited for resisting the taboo of [[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|interracial relationships]] within it.\n\nMadonna performed the song on [[The Virgin Tour]] (1985) and the [[Sticky & Sweet Tour]] (2008), in which a punk-rock version of the song was performed. \"Borderline\" has been covered by artists including [[Duffy (singer)|Duffy]], [[Jody Watley]], [[Counting Crows]] and [[The Flaming Lips]].\n\n==Background and development==\nIn 1982, Madonna was working with producer Reggie Lucas on her debut album. She had already composed three songs when Lucas brought one of his own compositions to the project, calling it \"Borderline\".<ref name=\"tara1\">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=76}}</ref> However, after recording the song, Madonna was unhappy with the final version, feeling that Lucas used too many instruments and did not consider her ideas for the song.<ref name=\"tara1\"/> This led to a dispute between the two. After finishing the album, Lucas left the project without altering the songs to Madonna's specifications. Hence, Madonna brought her then-boyfriend John \"Jellybean\" Benitez to remix \"Borderline\" and two other recorded tracks.<ref name=\"tara1\"/> On hearing the final version, [[Seymour Stein]], head of [[Sire Records]], declared, \"I dared to believe this was going to be huge beyond belief, the biggest thing I'd ever had, after I heard 'Borderline'... The passion that she put into that song, I thought, there's no stopping this girl.\"<ref name=\"rslist\"/>\n\n==Recording and composition==\n\"Borderline\" was recorded in February 1983 and presented a change in Madonna's normal vocal tone.<ref name=\"liner\"/> A sentimental track, the song talks about a love that is never quite fulfilled.<ref name=\"tara2\"/> According to author Santiago Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez in his book ''Madonna's Drowned Worlds'', the song's lyrics like \"Something in way you love me won't let me be/I don't want to be your prisoner so baby won't you set me free\" depicted a rebellion against male chauvinism.<ref name=\"fouz\">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=141}}</ref> Madonna used a refined and expressive singing voice, backed by Lucas's instrumentations.<ref name=\"tara2\"/> The song is considered to be the best example of the working relationship between Lucas and Madonna, as Lucas pushed the singer to find emotional depth in the song. Although sounding icy, the [[Refrain|chorus]] is contemporary in style, and the song's vocal range was later used by Madonna as her own personal range through her whole music career.<ref>{{harvnb|Cresswell|2006|p=714}}</ref> It opens with a keyboard-rich [[Introduction (music)|intro]] played on a [[Rhodes piano|Fender-Rhodes]] [[electric piano]] and a catchy synth melody provided by [[Fred Zarr]].<ref name=\"rikky1\">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=11}}</ref> [[Bass (instrument)|Bass]] player Anthony Jackson doubled Dean Gant's synth bass to provide a solid and more complex texture.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/>\n\nThe chords in the song were inspired by the 1970s [[disco]] sound in [[Philadelphia]], as well as [[Elton John]]'s musical style.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/> The chord sequences evoke [[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive|Bachman-Turner Overdrive]]'s song \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet (Bachman-Turner Overdrive song)|You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet]]\", while the synth phases display Madonna's typical musical style.<ref name=\"rikky2\">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=12}}</ref> The song is set in common time with a moderate [[tempo]] of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of [[D major]] with Madonna's vocal range spanning from F{{music|sharp}}<sub>3</sub> to B<sub>4</sub>. The song follows in the chord progression of D\u2013C\u2013G in the first verse to Bm\u2013Em\u2013A\u2013F{{music|sharp}} in the pre-chorus, and changes to A\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013Bm\u2013A\u2013E and G\u2013D\u2013A in the chorus.<ref name=\"sheet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdFPE.asp?ppn=MN0037591|title=Borderline&nbsp;\u2013 Madonna Ciccone&nbsp;\u2013 Digital Sheet Music|publisher=Musicnotes.com.

The girl is emotionally torn between the photographer and her [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] boyfriend ([[Louie Louie (musician)|Louie Louie]]),<ref name=\"clerk1\" /> with whom her troubled relationship mirrors the struggle many Hispanic women faced with their men.<ref name=\"bob\" /> The video narrative weaves the two relationship stories together in color and black-and-white.<ref name=\"kell1\">{{harvnb|Kellner|1995|p=270}}</ref> In the color sequences, Madonna sings, flirts and seduces her boyfriend, and in the black-and-white sequences she poses for the photographer, who also courts her.<ref name=\"kell1\" />\n\nThe video shows Madonna in her usual style in those years, with her hair in a haystack and wearing lace gloves, high-heeled boots with thick socks and her trademark \"boy-toy\" belt.<ref name=\"bob\" /> She changes clothing from one shot to another, in color as well as black and white, while wearing an unusual array of clothes including crop-tops, T-shirts, vests and sweaters coupled with cut-off pants and jeans, as well as a couple of evening gowns.<ref name=\"clerk1\" /> Posing for the photographer, Madonna looks towards the camera with challenge in her eyes, depicting sexual aggression.<ref name=\"metz1\" /> At one point, she starts spraying [[graffiti]] over some lifeless classical statues, portraying herself as a transgressor who breaks rules and attempts innovation.<ref name=\"kell1\" />\n\nLambert said that there was \"no formula\" used when making the \"Borderline\" video and that they were \"inventing it as we went along.\"<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{harvnb|Tannenbaum|Marks|2011|p=15}}</ref> In the January 1997 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Lambert described the video and its plot as, \"Boy and girl enjoy simple pleasures of [[barrio]] love, girl is tempted by fame, boy gets huffy, girl gets famous, but her new beau's out-of-line reaction to a behavioral trifle (all she did was to spray-paint his expensive sports car) drives her back to her true love.\"<ref name=\"fouz\" /> The portrayal of the street life reflected Madonna's life in the gritty, multiracial streets and clubs that she had haunted while her career was beginning, while the depiction of high fashion reflected the popularity and success she was experiencing.<ref name=\"metz1\" /> \n\n{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=\"When I screened 'Borderline' for Madonna's manager, Freddy DeMann, he was hysterical that I had combined black-and-white footage with color footage.

Although at first it seems that Madonna denies her Hispanic boyfriend in favor of the photographer, later she rejects him, implying her desire to control her own sexual pleasures and to cross established pop borderlines with lyrics like \"You just keep on pushing my love, over the borderline\".<ref name=\"kell1\" /> The contrasting image of Madonna, first as a messy blonde in the street sequence and later as a glamorous high-fashion blonde, suggests that one can construct one's own image and identity. Madonna's \"street\" image depicted in the video allowed her to appeal to Hispanic and black youths.<ref name=\"kell1\" />\n\nThe \"Borderline\" video attracted early attention from academics,<ref name=\"fouz\" /> who noted the symbolism of power in the two contrasting scenes. The photographer's studio is decorated with classical sculptures and nude statues holding spears, phallic symbols. In contrast, phallic symbols portrayed in the Hispanic neighborhood include a street lamp that Madonna embraces and a [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] cue held erect by Madonna's boyfriend.<ref name=\"fouz\" /> Author Andrew Metz commented that with these scenes, Madonna displayed her sophisticated views on the fabrications of feminity as a supreme power rather than the normal views of oppression.<ref name=\"metz1\" /> Author Carol Clerk said that the videos of \"Borderline\" and \"[[Lucky Star (Madonna song)|Lucky Star]]\" established Madonna not as the [[girl next door]], but as a sassy, smart and tough funny woman. Professor [[Douglas Kellner]], in his book ''Media Culture: Cultural Studies, Identity, and Politics Between the Modern and the Postmodern'', commented that the video depicted motifs and strategies that helped Madonna in her journey to become a star.<ref>{{harvnb|Kellner|1995|p=269}}</ref> The clothes Madonna wore in the video were later used by designers like [[Karl Lagerfeld]] and [[Christian Lacroix]].<ref name=\"clerk1\" />\n\n==Live performances==\n[[File:Madonna - Tears of a clown (25683567543).jpg|thumb|Madonna performing \"Borderline\" during her [[Madonna: Tears of a Clown|Tears of a Clown]] concert in Melbourne, Australia on March 2016.]]\nThe song was performed by Madonna on [[The Virgin Tour]] (1985) and the [[Sticky & Sweet Tour]] (2008).

It was released on February 15, 1984 by [[Sire Records]] as the album's fifth [[Single (music)|single]]. Written and composed by its producer [[Reggie Lucas]], the song was remixed by Madonna's then-boyfriend [[John Benitez|John \"Jellybean\" Benitez]]. The singer used refined and expressive vocals to deliver lyrics about an unfulfilled love.\n\nContemporary critics and authors applauded the song, calling it harmonically the most complex track from ''Madonna'' and praising its [[dance-pop]] nature. In the United States, \"Borderline\" became Madonna's first top-ten hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number ten in June 1984. In the United Kingdom, it peaked at number two after it was re-released as a single in 1986. Elsewhere, the song reached the top 10 or 20 in numerous European nations, while topping the singles chart of Ireland. \"Borderline\" placed number 84 on ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' magazine's list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born,\" while ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' included it on their critics list of \"All-Time 100 Songs.\"\n\nThe accompanying [[music video]] portrayed Madonna with a Latin-American man as her boyfriend to whom she returns after being enticed to pose and model for a British photographer. The video generated academic interest for its use of power as symbolism. The video, in heavy rotation on [[MTV]], was instrumental in establishing Madonna's early success, and she was credited for resisting the taboo of [[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|interracial relationships]] within it.\n\nMadonna performed the song on [[The Virgin Tour]] (1985) and the [[Sticky & Sweet Tour]] (2008), in which a punk-rock version of the song was performed. \"Borderline\" has been covered by artists including [[Duffy (singer)|Duffy]], [[Jody Watley]], [[Counting Crows]] and [[The Flaming Lips]].\n\n==Background and development==\nIn 1982, Madonna was working with producer Reggie Lucas on her debut album. She had already composed three songs when Lucas brought one of his own compositions to the project, calling it \"Borderline\".<ref name=\"tara1\">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=76}}</ref> However, after recording the song, Madonna was unhappy with the final version, feeling that Lucas used too many instruments and did not consider her ideas for the song.<ref name=\"tara1\"/> This led to a dispute between the two. After finishing the album, Lucas left the project without altering the songs to Madonna's specifications. Hence, Madonna brought her then-boyfriend John \"Jellybean\" Benitez to remix \"Borderline\" and two other recorded tracks.<ref name=\"tara1\"/> On hearing the final version, [[Seymour Stein]], head of [[Sire Records]], declared, \"I dared to believe this was going to be huge beyond belief, the biggest thing I'd ever had, after I heard 'Borderline'... The passion that she put into that song, I thought, there's no stopping this girl.\"<ref name=\"rslist\"/>\n\n==Recording and composition==\n\"Borderline\" was recorded in February 1983 and presented a change in Madonna's normal vocal tone.<ref name=\"liner\"/> A sentimental track, the song talks about a love that is never quite fulfilled.<ref name=\"tara2\"/> According to author Santiago Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez in his book ''Madonna's Drowned Worlds'', the song's lyrics like \"Something in way you love me won't let me be/I don't want to be your prisoner so baby won't you set me free\" depicted a rebellion against male chauvinism.<ref name=\"fouz\">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=141}}</ref> Madonna used a refined and expressive singing voice, backed by Lucas's instrumentations.<ref name=\"tara2\"/> The song is considered to be the best example of the working relationship between Lucas and Madonna, as Lucas pushed the singer to find emotional depth in the song. Although sounding icy, the [[Refrain|chorus]] is contemporary in style, and the song's vocal range was later used by Madonna as her own personal range through her whole music career.<ref>{{harvnb|Cresswell|2006|p=714}}</ref> It opens with a keyboard-rich [[Introduction (music)|intro]] played on a [[Rhodes piano|Fender-Rhodes]] [[electric piano]] and a catchy synth melody provided by [[Fred Zarr]].<ref name=\"rikky1\">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=11}}</ref> [[Bass (instrument)|Bass]] player Anthony Jackson doubled Dean Gant's synth bass to provide a solid and more complex texture.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/>\n\nThe chords in the song were inspired by the 1970s [[disco]] sound in [[Philadelphia]], as well as [[Elton John]]'s musical style.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/> The chord sequences evoke [[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive|Bachman-Turner Overdrive]]'s song \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet (Bachman-Turner Overdrive song)|You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet]]\", while the synth phases display Madonna's typical musical style.<ref name=\"rikky2\">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=12}}</ref> The song is set in common time with a moderate [[tempo]] of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of [[D major]] with Madonna's vocal range spanning from F{{music|sharp}}<sub>3</sub> to B<sub>4</sub>. The song follows in the chord progression of D\u2013C\u2013G in the first verse to Bm\u2013Em\u2013A\u2013F{{music|sharp}} in the pre-chorus, and changes to A\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013Bm\u2013A\u2013E and G\u2013D\u2013A in the chorus.<ref name=\"sheet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdFPE.asp?ppn=MN0037591|title=Borderline&nbsp;\u2013 Madonna Ciccone&nbsp;\u2013 Digital Sheet Music|publisher=Musicnotes.com.

The girl is emotionally torn between the photographer and her [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] boyfriend ([[Louie Louie (musician)|Louie Louie]]),<ref name=\"clerk1\" /> with whom her troubled relationship mirrors the struggle many Hispanic women faced with their men.<ref name=\"bob\" /> The video narrative weaves the two relationship stories together in color and black-and-white.<ref name=\"kell1\">{{harvnb|Kellner|1995|p=270}}</ref> In the color sequences, Madonna sings, flirts and seduces her boyfriend, and in the black-and-white sequences she poses for the photographer, who also courts her.<ref name=\"kell1\" />\n\nThe video shows Madonna in her usual style in those years, with her hair in a haystack and wearing lace gloves, high-heeled boots with thick socks and her trademark \"boy-toy\" belt.<ref name=\"bob\" /> She changes clothing from one shot to another, in color as well as black and white, while wearing an unusual array of clothes including crop-tops, T-shirts, vests and sweaters coupled with cut-off pants and jeans, as well as a couple of evening gowns.<ref name=\"clerk1\" /> Posing for the photographer, Madonna looks towards the camera with challenge in her eyes, depicting sexual aggression.<ref name=\"metz1\" /> At one point, she starts spraying [[graffiti]] over some lifeless classical statues, portraying herself as a transgressor who breaks rules and attempts innovation.<ref name=\"kell1\" />\n\nLambert said that there was \"no formula\" used when making the \"Borderline\" video and that they were \"inventing it as we went along.\"<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{harvnb|Tannenbaum|Marks|2011|p=15}}</ref> In the January 1997 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Lambert described the video and its plot as, \"Boy and girl enjoy simple pleasures of [[barrio]] love, girl is tempted by fame, boy gets huffy, girl gets famous, but her new beau's out-of-line reaction to a behavioral trifle (all she did was to spray-paint his expensive sports car) drives her back to her true love.\"<ref name=\"fouz\" /> The portrayal of the street life reflected Madonna's life in the gritty, multiracial streets and clubs that she had haunted while her career was beginning, while the depiction of high fashion reflected the popularity and success she was experiencing.<ref name=\"metz1\" /> \n\n{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=\"When I screened 'Borderline' for Madonna's manager, Freddy DeMann, he was hysterical that I had combined black-and-white footage with color footage.

Although at first it seems that Madonna denies her Hispanic boyfriend in favor of the photographer, later she rejects him, implying her desire to control her own sexual pleasures and to cross established pop borderlines with lyrics like \"You just keep on pushing my love, over the borderline\".<ref name=\"kell1\" /> The contrasting image of Madonna, first as a messy blonde in the street sequence and later as a glamorous high-fashion blonde, suggests that one can construct one's own image and identity. Madonna's \"street\" image depicted in the video allowed her to appeal to Hispanic and black youths.<ref name=\"kell1\" />\n\nThe \"Borderline\" video attracted early attention from academics,<ref name=\"fouz\" /> who noted the symbolism of power in the two contrasting scenes. The photographer's studio is decorated with classical sculptures and nude statues holding spears, phallic symbols. In contrast, phallic symbols portrayed in the Hispanic neighborhood include a street lamp that Madonna embraces and a [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] cue held erect by Madonna's boyfriend.<ref name=\"fouz\" /> Author Andrew Metz commented that with these scenes, Madonna displayed her sophisticated views on the fabrications of feminity as a supreme power rather than the normal views of oppression.<ref name=\"metz1\" /> Author Carol Clerk said that the videos of \"Borderline\" and \"[[Lucky Star (Madonna song)|Lucky Star]]\" established Madonna not as the [[girl next door]], but as a sassy, smart and tough funny woman. Professor [[Douglas Kellner]], in his book ''Media Culture: Cultural Studies, Identity, and Politics Between the Modern and the Postmodern'', commented that the video depicted motifs and strategies that helped Madonna in her journey to become a star.<ref>{{harvnb|Kellner|1995|p=269}}</ref> The clothes Madonna wore in the video were later used by designers like [[Karl Lagerfeld]] and [[Christian Lacroix]].<ref name=\"clerk1\" />\n\n==Live performances==\n[[File:Madonna - Tears of a clown (25683567543).jpg|thumb|Madonna performing \"Borderline\" during her [[Madonna: Tears of a Clown|Tears of a Clown]] concert in Melbourne, Australia on March 2016.]]\nThe song was performed by Madonna on [[The Virgin Tour]] (1985) and the [[Sticky & Sweet Tour]] (2008).

The song's musical style, and production by Timbaland, were heavily inspired by [[old school hip hop]] from the early 1980s, and includes a portion that samples [[Run-D.M.C.]]'s \"[[Raising Hell (album)|Peter Piper]]\". The beginning of the song samples [[Rock Master Scott & the Dynamic Three]]'s \"Request Line\".\n\nReleased as the album's first single in September 2002, the track reached the number two position on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Missy Elliott's most successful single to date. A [[remix]] of this song features [[50 Cent]]. The end of the song samples \"Take Me to the Mardi Gras\" by [[Bob James (musician)|Bob James]] and was also sampled in one of Missy's first features \"[[The Things That You Do]]\", and the synth pattern in the rhythm track samples the intro of \"[[Heart of Glass (song)|Heart of Glass]]\" by [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]].\n\n==Lyrics==\nA portion of the song's lyrics helped popularize the slang term \"[[Buttocks|badonkadonk]]\" with mainstream audiences (\"Love the way my butt go bum-bump-bum-bump-bump/Keep your eyes on my bum-bump-bum-bump-bump/And think you can handle this badonk-a-donk-donk\").<ref>{{cite web|title=63.

In the middle of the song, after the lyric \"Listen up close while I take you backwards\", the lyric \"Watch the way Missy like to take it backwards\" is also played in reverse. This vocal reversing trend made it to several of her productions during the following years.\n\nIn the song's chorus, an elephant trumpeting is heard to hide a sexual reference (\"If you got a big [elephant trumpet], let me search it\"). There is no version of the song that replaces the elephant sound with a word it is meant to hide; there is no word to hide, as it is meant to be left to the listener's imagination. In both the explicit and edited versions, the song uses [[onomatopoeia]] such as \"ra-ta-ta-ta\" and \"buboomp buboomp boomp\" to refer to sexual bodily moves.<ref name=\"Guins\">{{citation|last=Guins|first=Radford|title=Edited Clean Version: Technology and the Culture of Control|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtFXpZi3z28C|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2009|page=152|isbn=081664814X}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video to \"Work It\" was directed by [[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]]. [[Timbaland]] and [[Tweet (singer)|Tweet]] make cameos in the video. [[Alyson Stoner]] stars as Lead Kid Dancer. The video pays tribute to [[Aaliyah]] (1979\u20132001) and [[Lisa Lopes|Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes]] (1971\u20132002), who at the time had both recently died. They are commemorated in the music video with their images airbrushed on a car's hood. It also features an appearance by dancer and graffiti writer [[Mr. Wiggles]] from [[Rock Steady Crew]]. There is another music video that features [[50 Cent]] rapping the first verse on the remix.\n\nIn shooting the video, director Myers shot the opening scene with live [[honey bee]]s; only one crew member was stung. Additionally, he forgot to replace a glass of wine with a glass of water when filming the restaurant scene, so Elliott was heavily drunk after production.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moss|first=Corey|title=Missy Elliott Speaks Gibberish To Janet Jackson On 'Work It' Set: VMA Lens Recap|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458600/story-behind-work-it.jhtml|publisher=MTV|date=November 12, 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021201102304/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458600/20021108/elliott_missy.jhtml|archivedate=December 1, 2002}}</ref>\n\nThe video won the award for [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the [[2003 MTV Video Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Sanneh|first=Kelefa|title=A Win for Missy Elliott at Music Video Awards|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/29/nyregion/a-win-for-missy-elliott-at-music-video-awards.html|accessdate=December 24, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 29, 2003}}</ref> In a 2010 interview with \"Dance Spirit\", Alyson Stoner revealed that she almost didn't go to the audition for \"Work It\" and her dancing is featured in a clean part of the video.<ref>[http://www.dancespirit.com/whos-hot/you-should-know/hip-hop_teen_alyson_stoner/ Hip-Hop Teen Alyson Stoner <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> \"Work It\" was choreographed by Hi-Hat.<ref>[https://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/the-little-girl-from-the-missy-elliott-video-made-a-tribute The Little Girl From The Missy Elliott Video Made A Missy Tribute Video And It\u2019s Awesome <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Alyson Stoner won the role of Lead Kid Dancer out of 400 to 500 kids.<ref>[http://www.vibe.com/2017/11/alyson-stoner-missy-elliott-interview/ Interview: 15 Years After \u201cWork It,\u201d Alyson Stoner Talks Missy Elliott\u2019s Character And Influence On Her Career <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2018, ''Billboard'' critics ranked it 2nd among the \"greatest music videos of the 21st century.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/list/8466543/100-greatest-music-videos-of-the-21st-century |title=The 100 Greatest Music Videos of the 21st Century: Critics' Picks |date=July 24, 2018 |work=Billboard |accessdate=July 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Alyson Stoner tribute video==\nIn 2015, 13 years after \"Work It\" came out Alyson Stoner reunited with her former co-stars to release a tribute dance video of \"Work It\" for Missy Elliott.<ref>[http://www.today.com/popculture/missy-elliott-video-kid-makes-video-tribute-rapper-t3071 The little girl from Missy Elliott's videos proves she can still 'Work It' <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This was done after people had been asking her why she didn't dance with Missy Elliott and Katy Perry during the 2015 Super Bowl.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etonline.com/music/159694_the_little_girl_from_missy_elliot_videos_recreated_her_moves_this_amazing_tribute|title=The Little Girl From Missy Elliot's Videos Recreated Her Moves in This Amazing Tribute|last=Ungerman|first=Alex|date=February 12, 2015|website=Entertainment Tonight|language=en-US}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=June 2019}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/2017/11/alyson-stoner-missy-elliott-interview|title=Alyson Stoner Discusses Missy Elliott's Impact On Her Career|last=Jefferson|first=J'na|date=2017-11-10|website=Vibe|language=en|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nJohn Bush of [[AllMusic]] described the song as \"turn[ing] the tables on male rappers, taking charge of the sex game, matching their lewdest, rudest rhymes, and also featuring the most notorious backmasked vocal of the year.\" Bush cited the song as an example of Elliott's \"artistic progression, trying to push hip-hop forward...neatly emphasizing her differences from other rappers by writing tracks for nearly every facet of the female side of relationships.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Bush|first=John|title=Under Construction: Review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/under-construction-mw0000231192|website=AllMusic|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked \"Work It\" 25th in its list \"100 Best Songs of the 2000s\".<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-songs-of-the-aughts-20110617/missy-elliott-work-it-20110616 25: Missy Elliott, 'Work It']</ref> In 2003, ''The Village Voice'' named \"Work It\" the best single of 2002 on their annual year-end critics' poll [[Pazz & Jop]];

The song's musical style, and production by Timbaland, were heavily inspired by [[old school hip hop]] from the early 1980s, and includes a portion that samples [[Run-D.M.C.]]'s \"[[Raising Hell (album)|Peter Piper]]\". The beginning of the song samples [[Rock Master Scott & the Dynamic Three]]'s \"Request Line\".\n\nReleased as the album's first single in September 2002, the track reached the number two position on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Missy Elliott's most successful single to date. A [[remix]] of this song features [[50 Cent]]. The end of the song samples \"Take Me to the Mardi Gras\" by [[Bob James (musician)|Bob James]] and was also sampled in one of Missy's first features \"[[The Things That You Do]]\", and the synth pattern in the rhythm track samples the intro of \"[[Heart of Glass (song)|Heart of Glass]]\" by [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]].\n\n==Lyrics==\nA portion of the song's lyrics helped popularize the slang term \"[[Buttocks|badonkadonk]]\" with mainstream audiences (\"Love the way my butt go bum-bump-bum-bump-bump/Keep your eyes on my bum-bump-bum-bump-bump/And think you can handle this badonk-a-donk-donk\").<ref>{{cite web|title=63.

In the middle of the song, after the lyric \"Listen up close while I take you backwards\", the lyric \"Watch the way Missy like to take it backwards\" is also played in reverse. This vocal reversing trend made it to several of her productions during the following years.\n\nIn the song's chorus, an elephant trumpeting is heard to hide a sexual reference (\"If you got a big [elephant trumpet], let me search it\"). There is no version of the song that replaces the elephant sound with a word it is meant to hide; there is no word to hide, as it is meant to be left to the listener's imagination. In both the explicit and edited versions, the song uses [[onomatopoeia]] such as \"ra-ta-ta-ta\" and \"buboomp buboomp boomp\" to refer to sexual bodily moves.<ref name=\"Guins\">{{citation|last=Guins|first=Radford|title=Edited Clean Version: Technology and the Culture of Control|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtFXpZi3z28C|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2009|page=152|isbn=081664814X}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video to \"Work It\" was directed by [[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]]. [[Timbaland]] and [[Tweet (singer)|Tweet]] make cameos in the video. [[Alyson Stoner]] stars as Lead Kid Dancer. The video pays tribute to [[Aaliyah]] (1979\u20132001) and [[Lisa Lopes|Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes]] (1971\u20132002), who at the time had both recently died. They are commemorated in the music video with their images airbrushed on a car's hood. It also features an appearance by dancer and graffiti writer [[Mr. Wiggles]] from [[Rock Steady Crew]]. There is another music video that features [[50 Cent]] rapping the first verse on the remix.\n\nIn shooting the video, director Myers shot the opening scene with live [[honey bee]]s; only one crew member was stung. Additionally, he forgot to replace a glass of wine with a glass of water when filming the restaurant scene, so Elliott was heavily drunk after production.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moss|first=Corey|title=Missy Elliott Speaks Gibberish To Janet Jackson On 'Work It' Set: VMA Lens Recap|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458600/story-behind-work-it.jhtml|publisher=MTV|date=November 12, 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021201102304/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458600/20021108/elliott_missy.jhtml|archivedate=December 1, 2002}}</ref>\n\nThe video won the award for [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the [[2003 MTV Video Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Sanneh|first=Kelefa|title=A Win for Missy Elliott at Music Video Awards|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/29/nyregion/a-win-for-missy-elliott-at-music-video-awards.html|accessdate=December 24, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 29, 2003}}</ref> In a 2010 interview with \"Dance Spirit\", Alyson Stoner revealed that she almost didn't go to the audition for \"Work It\" and her dancing is featured in a clean part of the video.<ref>[http://www.dancespirit.com/whos-hot/you-should-know/hip-hop_teen_alyson_stoner/ Hip-Hop Teen Alyson Stoner <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> \"Work It\" was choreographed by Hi-Hat.<ref>[https://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/the-little-girl-from-the-missy-elliott-video-made-a-tribute The Little Girl From The Missy Elliott Video Made A Missy Tribute Video And It\u2019s Awesome <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Alyson Stoner won the role of Lead Kid Dancer out of 400 to 500 kids.<ref>[http://www.vibe.com/2017/11/alyson-stoner-missy-elliott-interview/ Interview: 15 Years After \u201cWork It,\u201d Alyson Stoner Talks Missy Elliott\u2019s Character And Influence On Her Career <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2018, ''Billboard'' critics ranked it 2nd among the \"greatest music videos of the 21st century.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/list/8466543/100-greatest-music-videos-of-the-21st-century |title=The 100 Greatest Music Videos of the 21st Century: Critics' Picks |date=July 24, 2018 |work=Billboard |accessdate=July 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Alyson Stoner tribute video==\nIn 2015, 13 years after \"Work It\" came out Alyson Stoner reunited with her former co-stars to release a tribute dance video of \"Work It\" for Missy Elliott.<ref>[http://www.today.com/popculture/missy-elliott-video-kid-makes-video-tribute-rapper-t3071 The little girl from Missy Elliott's videos proves she can still 'Work It' <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This was done after people had been asking her why she didn't dance with Missy Elliott and Katy Perry during the 2015 Super Bowl.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etonline.com/music/159694_the_little_girl_from_missy_elliot_videos_recreated_her_moves_this_amazing_tribute|title=The Little Girl From Missy Elliot's Videos Recreated Her Moves in This Amazing Tribute|last=Ungerman|first=Alex|date=February 12, 2015|website=Entertainment Tonight|language=en-US}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=June 2019}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/2017/11/alyson-stoner-missy-elliott-interview|title=Alyson Stoner Discusses Missy Elliott's Impact On Her Career|last=Jefferson|first=J'na|date=2017-11-10|website=Vibe|language=en|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nJohn Bush of [[AllMusic]] described the song as \"turn[ing] the tables on male rappers, taking charge of the sex game, matching their lewdest, rudest rhymes, and also featuring the most notorious backmasked vocal of the year.\" Bush cited the song as an example of Elliott's \"artistic progression, trying to push hip-hop forward...neatly emphasizing her differences from other rappers by writing tracks for nearly every facet of the female side of relationships.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Bush|first=John|title=Under Construction: Review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/under-construction-mw0000231192|website=AllMusic|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked \"Work It\" 25th in its list \"100 Best Songs of the 2000s\".<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-songs-of-the-aughts-20110617/missy-elliott-work-it-20110616 25: Missy Elliott, 'Work It']</ref> In 2003, ''The Village Voice'' named \"Work It\" the best single of 2002 on their annual year-end critics' poll [[Pazz & Jop]];

It was released as the first [[Single (music)|single]] from their second international album ''[[Backstreet's Back]]'' in June 1997, and the third single from their [[Backstreet Boys (1997 album)|debut US album]] in March 1998. The US debut was originally released without the song, which references the band's return via their second international album. However, once it was decided that the single would be released in the US, the album was re-released with \"Everybody\" included. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' commented that the song has \"a contagious dance/pop beat and catchy hook that perfectly showcases this talented group's voices.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1998/BB-1998-04-04.pdf|title=Single Reviews|work=Billboard magazine|accessdate=9 February 2020|page=65|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[Zomba Label Group|Zomba]] chairman [[Clive Calder]] suggested the song as a single, but [[Jive Records|Jive]] president [[Barry Weiss]] thought it would be weird to have a song called \"Backstreet's Back\" on the band's first US album. The band suggested it could just mean that they were back home. After Canadian markets began playing the song, US markets near the border began picking the song up. The band met with Weiss and asked that the song be added to the US album after the first million units had already been produced.<ref name=\"ew\">Interview with Backstreet Boys, management, and others from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' 10th Anniversary Issue.</ref> Written and produced by [[Max Martin]] and [[Denniz Pop|Denniz PoP]], \"Everybody\" is one of the Backstreet Boys' most successful singles to date, reaching number 4 in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], running 22 weeks, and number 3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Worldwide Charts|url=http://www.backstreetparadise.com/charts.html|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref> It is [[RIAA certification|certified]] platinum in the United States with 2.1 million sales.\n\nThere are two versions of the song. The international album features the album or 7\" version, which is the standard recording. The US album features the extended version of the song which includes an extended breakdown section, but cuts the bridge. The music video for the song was cut to both versions of the song, with the extended video released to the US market, and the standard video released everywhere else. In late August 2012, Backstreet Boys member [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick Carter]] revealed via Twitter that the group was recording the song in Spanish, and it might be featured in their eighth studio record for Latin markets.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Carter twitter update|url=https://twitter.com/nickcarter/status/240277086760206336|accessdate=August 29, 2012|date=August 28, 2012|quote=We are recording backstreets back in Spanish. Omg what's going on! Maybe well put it on the new record for Latin markets. En espa\u00f1ol}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\n===Background===\nThe music video was directed by [[Joseph Kahn]] and filmed in [[Los Angeles]], California from June 16\u201318, 1997.<ref name=\"Everybody20\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7865195/backstreet-boys-everybody-backstreets-back-video-anniversary-interview|title=How 'Everybody (Backstreet's Back)' Director Joseph Kahn Pushed Racial Boundaries & Brought a Backstreet Boy to Tears|last=Tailor|first=Leena|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 14, 2017|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> Kahn was contacted by [[Jive Records]] to direct a project with a \"white [[Jodeci]]\". He initially didn't know who the Backstreet Boys were, but was shocked by the group's European sales figures after being given a [[cassette tape]] and publicity release about them.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/> Kahn initially started out as a grunge and hip-hop director, but wanted to explore the pop genre, since he grew up listening to music from the 1980s.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/>\n\nThe haunted house treatment of the video was based on a treatment he envisioned for rapper [[Ice Cube]] a few months prior, and was inspired by the music video of [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]\".<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/> Kahn and the Backstreet Boys wanted [[Antonio Fargas]] to portray the bus driver, as they were fans of ''[[Starsky & Hutch]]''.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/> The video shoot lasted for 36 hours, with Nick Carter's mummy shot being filmed last.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/>\n\nThe video premiered outside the United States in July 1997, although viewers with [[Fuse (TV channel)|MuchMusic USA]] were able to see it as at the time it was still mostly a simulcast of the Canadian channel.  Jive did not get behind the concept of the band in costumes or the $1 million requirements, and did not believe MTV would respect the video. The band ultimately had to put up their own money to shoot the video and had to fight with the label to get reimbursed once it was successful.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/> In a 2017 interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Kahn reflected on the impact of the music video:<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/><blockquote>I was just trying to do something fun and make the pop video I\u2019d always wanted to make,\" he says. \"I love pop, and it just didn\u2019t exist at that point -- so I guess this helped start the whole pop scene in America. It allowed me to help create a new pop scene and, through these videos, create my view of pop culture.</blockquote>\n\n===Synopsis===\n[[File:Everybody Video BSB.jpg|thumb|The group, with [[Howie D.|Howie]] in front, as they prepare to leave the haunted house]]\nThe video is [[Framing device|bookended]] by scenes framing the context: When their bus breaks down, the band's driver ([[Antonio Fargas]]) insists that the group spend a night at a nearby haunted house (the same house used in the 1995 film ''[[Casper (film)|Casper]]'') while he gets help. It then shows Brian preparing to sleep in one of the bedrooms. As he is in bed, he pulls out a scary animal from under his covers, making him scream in horror. The musical portion of the video plays as a dream sequence in which each band member appears as a different [[movie monster]]: [[Brian Littrell|Brian]] as a [[werewolf]]; [[Howie Dorough|Howie]] as [[Dracula]]; [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick]] as a [[mummy]]; [[A.J. McLean|A.J.]] as [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Erik, the Phantom of the Opera]]; and [[Kevin Richardson (musician)|Kevin]] as [[Two-Face]]-like [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]. The boys, as monsters, mainly appear in their own individual vignettes related to their character, while the band as a group appears in the foyer of the house dressed in centuries-old clothing, performing a dance routine with a group of additional dancers. Supermodel [[Josie Maran]] appears as Howie's companion in his vignette. Following the song, the boys meet up in the foyer, each one having dreamed themselves as monsters. They resolve to leave, but are terrified by the sight of their driver standing at the front door with the appearance of [[Frankenstein's monster]]. The boys scream in terror, and the video ends.\n\nThere are two cuts of the video; one for the US market, and one for the international market, each of which features the edit of the song released on the album for that market. The international video cuts from the opening bookend to the first verse. The bridge of the song is intact and the first half of the dance routine, a ballroom dance portion, is intercut with the vignettes under it. This leads into the second half of the dance portion during the final choruses of the song which are not intercut with the vignettes. In the US cut, the ballroom half of the dance routine and the beginning of the second half are used at the start of the song during the first rhythm-only breakdown, and is not intercut with the vignettes. The second breakdown, which replaces the bridge, is accompanied only by shots from the vignettes, along with some shots of Brian's Wolfman character doing some [[Tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbling]] moves in the foyer and in the various vignettes. When the final choruses begin, the second half of the dance routine is shown again from the start, but is intercut with vignette scenes. Most of the remainder of the video is cut identically, other than several minor instances of alternate scenes or takes being used. The dance floor in the video was painted. At the end, Brian wakes up, looks in his bed to see nothing, and realizes that he had a nightmare. As he tells Howie about his dream, he and the other guys tell each other that they had a dream as well and described what they were. Howie and the others get ready to leave, but find that their bus driver is a monster, making the Backstreet Boys scream in terror.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n===MTV Video Music Awards===\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[1998 MTV Video Music Awards|1998]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\"\n|[[Best Group Video]]\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|[[Best Dance Video]]\n|{{nom}}\n{{end}}\n\n===Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards===\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[1999 Kids' Choice Awards|1999]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\n|Favorite Song\n|{{won}}\n{{end}}\n\n===Grammy Awards===\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n||[[41st Grammy Awards|1999]]\n||Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\n|[[Best New Artist]]\n|{{nom}}\n{{end}}\n\n===MuchMusic Video Awards===\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n||[[MuchMusic Video Awards|1998]]\n||Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\n|Peoples Choice Favorite International Group\n|{{won}}\n{{end}}\n\n===MTV Movie Awards===\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n||[[MTV Movie Awards|2014]]\n|''This Is the End'' (Performance)\n|Best Musical Moment<ref>http://www.mtv.com/ontv/movieawards/2014/best-musical-moment/</ref>\n|{{won}}\n{{end}}\n\n==Cover versions and usage in media==\n{{in popular culture|date=January 2020}}\n* \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" was used in the 2002 Philippine TV commercial of [[Rexona]].\n* The song appeared in one TV spot of ''[[Finding Nemo]]''.\n* [[Howard Stern]] had a parody on his show titled \"Every Homo (Backside's Back)\", which was performed by his band, the Losers.\n* [[Snowball (cockatoo)|Snowball the Cockatoo]], the first non-human animal conclusively demonstrated to be capable of beat induction, was first observed \"dancing\" to this song.\n* In 2012, [[Old Navy]] used the song for a commercial.\n* In 2012, the band licensed the song to the [[Kinect]] game ''[[Dance Central 3]]''.\n* In 2013, the song was performed by the Backstreet Boys at the end of the film ''[[This Is the End]]''.\n* In 2013, the song was covered by [[Darren Criss]] in the movie ''[[Girl Most Likely]]''.\n* Since June 2014, the song has been used in adverts for Go Ahead!

It was released as the first [[Single (music)|single]] from their second international album ''[[Backstreet's Back]]'' in June 1997, and the third single from their [[Backstreet Boys (1997 album)|debut US album]] in March 1998. The US debut was originally released without the song, which references the band's return via their second international album. However, once it was decided that the single would be released in the US, the album was re-released with \"Everybody\" included. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' commented that the song has \"a contagious dance/pop beat and catchy hook that perfectly showcases this talented group's voices.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1998/BB-1998-04-04.pdf|title=Single Reviews|work=Billboard magazine|accessdate=9 February 2020|page=65|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[Zomba Label Group|Zomba]] chairman [[Clive Calder]] suggested the song as a single, but [[Jive Records|Jive]] president [[Barry Weiss]] thought it would be weird to have a song called \"Backstreet's Back\" on the band's first US album. The band suggested it could just mean that they were back home. After Canadian markets began playing the song, US markets near the border began picking the song up. The band met with Weiss and asked that the song be added to the US album after the first million units had already been produced.<ref name=\"ew\">Interview with Backstreet Boys, management, and others from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' 10th Anniversary Issue.</ref> Written and produced by [[Max Martin]] and [[Denniz Pop|Denniz PoP]], \"Everybody\" is one of the Backstreet Boys' most successful singles to date, reaching number 4 in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], running 22 weeks, and number 3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Worldwide Charts|url=http://www.backstreetparadise.com/charts.html|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref> It is [[RIAA certification|certified]] platinum in the United States with 2.1 million sales.\n\nThere are two versions of the song. The international album features the album or 7\" version, which is the standard recording. The US album features the extended version of the song which includes an extended breakdown section, but cuts the bridge. The music video for the song was cut to both versions of the song, with the extended video released to the US market, and the standard video released everywhere else. In late August 2012, Backstreet Boys member [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick Carter]] revealed via Twitter that the group was recording the song in Spanish, and it might be featured in their eighth studio record for Latin markets.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Carter twitter update|url=https://twitter.com/nickcarter/status/240277086760206336|accessdate=August 29, 2012|date=August 28, 2012|quote=We are recording backstreets back in Spanish. Omg what's going on! Maybe well put it on the new record for Latin markets. En espa\u00f1ol}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\n===Background===\nThe music video was directed by [[Joseph Kahn]] and filmed in [[Los Angeles]], California from June 16\u201318, 1997.<ref name=\"Everybody20\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7865195/backstreet-boys-everybody-backstreets-back-video-anniversary-interview|title=How 'Everybody (Backstreet's Back)' Director Joseph Kahn Pushed Racial Boundaries & Brought a Backstreet Boy to Tears|last=Tailor|first=Leena|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 14, 2017|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> Kahn was contacted by [[Jive Records]] to direct a project with a \"white [[Jodeci]]\". He initially didn't know who the Backstreet Boys were, but was shocked by the group's European sales figures after being given a [[cassette tape]] and publicity release about them.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/> Kahn initially started out as a grunge and hip-hop director, but wanted to explore the pop genre, since he grew up listening to music from the 1980s.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/>\n\nThe haunted house treatment of the video was based on a treatment he envisioned for rapper [[Ice Cube]] a few months prior, and was inspired by the music video of [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]\".<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/> Kahn and the Backstreet Boys wanted [[Antonio Fargas]] to portray the bus driver, as they were fans of ''[[Starsky & Hutch]]''.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/> The video shoot lasted for 36 hours, with Nick Carter's mummy shot being filmed last.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/>\n\nThe video premiered outside the United States in July 1997, although viewers with [[Fuse (TV channel)|MuchMusic USA]] were able to see it as at the time it was still mostly a simulcast of the Canadian channel.  Jive did not get behind the concept of the band in costumes or the $1 million requirements, and did not believe MTV would respect the video. The band ultimately had to put up their own money to shoot the video and had to fight with the label to get reimbursed once it was successful.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/> In a 2017 interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Kahn reflected on the impact of the music video:<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/><blockquote>I was just trying to do something fun and make the pop video I\u2019d always wanted to make,\" he says. \"I love pop, and it just didn\u2019t exist at that point -- so I guess this helped start the whole pop scene in America. It allowed me to help create a new pop scene and, through these videos, create my view of pop culture.</blockquote>\n\n===Synopsis===\n[[File:Everybody Video BSB.jpg|thumb|The group, with [[Howie D.|Howie]] in front, as they prepare to leave the haunted house]]\nThe video is [[Framing device|bookended]] by scenes framing the context: When their bus breaks down, the band's driver ([[Antonio Fargas]]) insists that the group spend a night at a nearby haunted house (the same house used in the 1995 film ''[[Casper (film)|Casper]]'') while he gets help. It then shows Brian preparing to sleep in one of the bedrooms. As he is in bed, he pulls out a scary animal from under his covers, making him scream in horror. The musical portion of the video plays as a dream sequence in which each band member appears as a different [[movie monster]]: [[Brian Littrell|Brian]] as a [[werewolf]]; [[Howie Dorough|Howie]] as [[Dracula]]; [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick]] as a [[mummy]]; [[A.J. McLean|A.J.]] as [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Erik, the Phantom of the Opera]]; and [[Kevin Richardson (musician)|Kevin]] as [[Two-Face]]-like [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]. The boys, as monsters, mainly appear in their own individual vignettes related to their character, while the band as a group appears in the foyer of the house dressed in centuries-old clothing, performing a dance routine with a group of additional dancers. Supermodel [[Josie Maran]] appears as Howie's companion in his vignette. Following the song, the boys meet up in the foyer, each one having dreamed themselves as monsters. They resolve to leave, but are terrified by the sight of their driver standing at the front door with the appearance of [[Frankenstein's monster]]. The boys scream in terror, and the video ends.\n\nThere are two cuts of the video; one for the US market, and one for the international market, each of which features the edit of the song released on the album for that market. The international video cuts from the opening bookend to the first verse. The bridge of the song is intact and the first half of the dance routine, a ballroom dance portion, is intercut with the vignettes under it. This leads into the second half of the dance portion during the final choruses of the song which are not intercut with the vignettes. In the US cut, the ballroom half of the dance routine and the beginning of the second half are used at the start of the song during the first rhythm-only breakdown, and is not intercut with the vignettes. The second breakdown, which replaces the bridge, is accompanied only by shots from the vignettes, along with some shots of Brian's Wolfman character doing some [[Tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbling]] moves in the foyer and in the various vignettes. When the final choruses begin, the second half of the dance routine is shown again from the start, but is intercut with vignette scenes. Most of the remainder of the video is cut identically, other than several minor instances of alternate scenes or takes being used. The dance floor in the video was painted. At the end, Brian wakes up, looks in his bed to see nothing, and realizes that he had a nightmare.

AGC was Australia's oldest national finance company offering a range of finance, investment and insurance products and were market leaders in equipment finance, cashflow finance, motor vehicle and personal finance.\n\n== Origins ==\n\nAGC was registered as a public company on 18 June 1925 and listed on the stock exchange in 1928.  Its business specialised in lending for cars and farm machinery and later expanded into personal loans and lending for non-farm business equipment.  Most of the funding for AGC's loans came from issuing [[debenture]]s to the public, offering attractive interest rates. The first Managing Director was Mr G K Bain who assumed control from the company commencement until his retirement in 1956.\n\nHaving a strong association with Ford Motor Company, which had just opened an Australian office and was establishing  a dealer network, AGC incorporated Traders Finance Corporation Ltd (\"TFC\") on 10 July 1925 to provide financing exclusively for the Ford dealer sales network. TFC was wound down in the late-1970s although AGC continued to maintain a large percentage of Ford dealers business.\n\nTransport and General Insurance Insurance Company Ltd was formed in 1938 as a wholly owned subsidiary of AGC to provide insurance facilities for purchasers of vehicles from the motor dealer network, and for general insurance needs of the affiliated motor dealers. The name was changed to AGC (Insurances) Ltd in the mid 1970s to better identify with the AGC products. The business was sold to AMP Society in 1989 and operated as AMP United Insurances Ltd.\n\nIn 1957 the [[Bank of New South Wales]] (later called the Wales, the forerunner of today's Westpac) bought 40% of AGC and over the years progressively increased its interest to a majority stake of 76% and then acquired all remaining shares in 1988.  Banking regulations at the time prevented banks from doing the sort of lending finance companies like AGC did, but buying a finance company let the banks get around that.  All the major Australian banks ended up with finance company subsidiaries doing riskier lending than the banks themselves would.  The Wales let AGC run as an independent business, and that included giving no guarantees on the debentures issued by AGC.\n\n== Local Expansion==\n\nInitially AGC operated through head office in Sydney, with state operations in each capital city. The first regional branch presence was established in Toowoomba, Queensland in 1958 under the management of Mr K (Keith) M Jack who would later become the Managing Director in 1980.\n\nFurther branch expansion quickly followed in all states and by the mid-1970s AGC operated more than 100 branch offices with over 3,000 staff. With advancing technology in the mid-1980s most suburban and regional branches were closed and the business operations were again centralised in large state operations, servicing clients statewide by local resident sales staff or electronically from state centres.\n\n== Offshore Expansion==\n\nAGC's first offshore operation was New Zealand which operated relatively autonomously as AGC (New Zealand) Ltd from 1938. Papua New Guinea was established in 1958. The 1960s saw AGC move into South East Asia with Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei all opened as joint ventures with Standard Chartered Bank of England.\n\nBy the mid-1980s AGC had extended its overseas presence, generally with a local joint partner, into countries such as Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Solomon Islands, Fiji, Portugal and a joint office with Westpac in London. Overall, by 1988 the very successful overseas operations involved 12 countries and employed more than 1,000 staff.\n\nAlthough most overseas businesses were very profitable, all were progressively sold in the early-1990s as part of the business rationalisation after the financial crisis of the late-1980s.\n\n== 1970s and 1980s==\n\nThrough the 1970s AGC expanded and increased profits.  It avoided many of the disasters that befell others in that time, though it did indulge in the diversification strategies that were in vogue, ending up for a time with a majority interest in [[Budget Rent-A-Car]]<!-- is this the Australiian arm? --> and in property developer [[Mirvac]], plus minority interests in all sorts of things from entertainment business (\"AGC Paradine\" in partnership with well-known entertainment personality David Frost), winemaking, brickworks to caravans.  On the finance related side AGC continued to expand overseas, and in Australia acquired [[Bill Acceptance Corporation]] (BAC) in 1977 (which it ran as an independent business). In the early-1980s AGC also acquired a number of competitor retail financier companies, notably General Credits, Standard Chartered Finance Australia, Associated Midland and Amev-UDC. From the late-1970s until 1988 AGC also operated a \"big ticket\" corporate financing business as AGC Corporate Finance, providing finance facilities for such purposes as commercial aircraft, public company preference shares and mining equipment. This operation was moved to Westpac Corporate Finance control in 1988.\n\nIn general, lending through those years was conservative and risk was tightly controlled.  Lending against real estate in particular was capped at 30% of the loan book and spread by type and geography.  The head office in Sydney at the time was devoid of luxuries, in a way reflecting in its environment the discipline applied to the business.\n\nOne property position that did spiral away in that time though was the [[Kooralbyn]] resort development started by prominent businessmen [[Peter Abeles]] and [[Arthur George]] in 1975.  They put up $2m and AGC put up $4m, but costs increased and after advancing $12m AGC took it over.  AGC then spent yet more over subsequent years until finally exiting in 1987 for a loss of some $50m.  The motto within AGC that \"the first loss is the best loss\" had been illustrated, but the experience didn't keep it out of much worse property forays like the Como development in later years.\n\n== The 1990s and beyond ==\n\nIn the late-1980s and early-1990s, AGC found itself in severe difficulties having deviated from the traditional conservative lending policies towards \"big ticket\" property development loans. The economy turned against these borrowers, leaving AGC, and many similar financiers, with very substantial impaired loans and a consequent serious funding crisis. Westpac, although suffering similar situations with defaulting loans, agreed to support AGC through the provision of substantial funding lines. The ensuing period from 1991 onwards saw a complete restructure of the management operations and policies including exit from most property lending, sale of offshore subsidiaries (excluding AGC New Zealand), and updated lending policies. These actions resulted in a strong return to the traditional \"mainstream\" profitable performance by the mid-1990s.\n\n== History of Chief Executives ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name!!

The downside to this product for the consumer, is if they failed to repay the balance of a particular interest free plan, it would revert to a high interest rate.  These cards could also be used through EFTPOS and ATM terminals, but these would automatically bear high interest.  The card has since been superseded by [[GE CreditLine]].\n\n====Personal Line of Credit====\nProvided a line of credit up to $15,000. Enabled customers to obtain home improvements, motor vehicles, [[debt consolidation]] or use the line of credit for any other worthwhile purpose. Cash advances were also available under this product allowing a borrower to take their line of credit up to their limit.<ref>[https://qilo.io Personal finance includes Personal Line of Credit] options available to borrowers struggling with debt.</ref>\n\n====Mortgage Line of Credit====\nProvided a line of credit secured by a mortgage, over residential real estate for amounts over $20,000. Maximum amount that could be lent to a customer could be up to 90% of their property's value. This type of credit facility is secured by a first or second mortgage.\n\n===Business Finance===\n\n====Chattel Financing====\nProviding funding to businesses for the acquisition of business-related assets such as motor vehicles and trucks, earth moving equipment etc. by way of purchase funding or leasing.\n\n====Cashflow Funding====\nProviding funding to businesses for cashflow purposes, as an alternative to traditional banking overdraft or term loans. Facilities were usually secured by the business assets such as stock and debtors.\n\n===Dealer Finance===\n\n====Motor Financing====\nProviding funding to motor dealer clients for the purchase of motor vehicles from the dealership.\n\n====Dealer Funding====\nProviding funding to motor dealers for carrying floor plan of motor vehicle stock, or loans to dealers for the establishment and expansion of dealer businesses.\n\n==GE Acquisition==\nOn Monday, 26 November 2001, it was announced that GE Capital (GE Money) had made an unsolicited approach to the Westpac Banking Corporation regarding the possible sale of the Personal Finance and Motor Dealer finance parts of AGC's business in Australia and New Zealand.<ref>See https://web.archive.org/web/20020408182337/http://www.agc.com.au/display.cfm?doc=00-80-15</ref>   This was completed in June 2002 at a reported price of $1.7b and from that point GE started integrating the AGC businesses into the GE Consumer Finance Australian arm. The personal finance segment of the business included the Credit Line product which had commenced business in 1968 as AGC Household Finance, and moved to the Credit Line product in 1984.\n\n==Westpac Integration==\nWith the GE acquisition of the retail and dealer lending segments of the AGC portfolio, Westpac integrated the Business Finance segments in Australia and New Zealand into its own operations under the banner of \"Westpac Equipment Finance\".\n\n==Notes and references==\n<references/>\n* ''Westpac: The Bank that Broke the Bank'', Edna Carew, Doubleday, 1997, paperback {{ISBN|0-86824-664-6}}.\n\n{{General Electric}}\n\n[[Category:General Electric Money subsidiaries| ]]\n\n[[de:GE Money]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox company \n| name   = Australian Guarantee Corporation Limited\n| logo   = <!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:AGC_Logo.png|250px|Corporate logo]] --> \n| type   = No longer trading\n| foundation     = 1925\n| fate           = Acquired\n| successor      = [[GE Money]] and [[Westpac Banking Corporation]]\n| location       =  [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]\n| industry       = [[Finance]]\n| products       = Personal Finance<br>Business Finance<br>Retail Finance<br>Dealer Motor Vehicle Finance<br>Investments<br>Line of Credit<br>Insurance\n|}}\nFounded in 1921 as Australian Guarantee Company to initially provide finance for purchasers of smaller household items, it progressed into financing motor vehicles and was renamed as '''Australian Guarantee Corporation''' Limited in 1925 (\"AGC\").

These actions resulted in a strong return to the traditional \"mainstream\" profitable performance by the mid-1990s.\n\n== History of Chief Executives ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name!!

The downside to this product for the consumer, is if they failed to repay the balance of a particular interest free plan, it would revert to a high interest rate.  These cards could also be used through EFTPOS and ATM terminals, but these would automatically bear high interest.  The card has since been superseded by [[GE CreditLine]].\n\n====Personal Line of Credit====\nProvided a line of credit up to $15,000. Enabled customers to obtain home improvements, motor vehicles, [[debt consolidation]] or use the line of credit for any other worthwhile purpose. Cash advances were also available under this product allowing a borrower to take their line of credit up to their limit.<ref>[https://qilo,io Personal finance includes Personal Line of Credit] options available to borrowers struggling with debt.</ref>\n\n====Mortgage Line of Credit====\nProvided a line of credit secured by a mortgage, over residential real estate for amounts over $20,000. Maximum amount that could be lent to a customer could be up to 90% of their property's value. This type of credit facility is secured by a first or second mortgage.\n\n===Business Finance===\n\n====Chattel Financing====\nProviding funding to businesses for the acquisition of business-related assets such as motor vehicles and trucks, earth moving equipment etc. by way of purchase funding or leasing.\n\n====Cashflow Funding====\nProviding funding to businesses for cashflow purposes, as an alternative to traditional banking overdraft or term loans. Facilities were usually secured by the business assets such as stock and debtors.\n\n===Dealer Finance===\n\n====Motor Financing====\nProviding funding to motor dealer clients for the purchase of motor vehicles from the dealership.\n\n====Dealer Funding====\nProviding funding to motor dealers for carrying floor plan of motor vehicle stock, or loans to dealers for the establishment and expansion of dealer businesses.\n\n==GE Acquisition==\nOn Monday, 26 November 2001, it was announced that GE Capital (GE Money) had made an unsolicited approach to the Westpac Banking Corporation regarding the possible sale of the Personal Finance and Motor Dealer finance parts of AGC's business in Australia and New Zealand.<ref>See https://web.archive.org/web/20020408182337/http://www.agc.com.au/display.cfm?doc=00-80-15</ref>   This was completed in June 2002 at a reported price of $1.7b and from that point GE started integrating the AGC businesses into the GE Consumer Finance Australian arm.

It was released in February 1996 as the third single from her third [[studio album]], ''[[Jagged Little Pill]]'' (1995). It was written by Morissette and [[Glen Ballard]], and was produced by him. \"Ironic\" is a song written in the key of [[B major]], and includes a moderate tempo of eighty-five beats per minute. The lyrics present several situations that are described as \"ironic\"; this has led to debate as to whether any of these actually match the accepted meaning of ''[[irony]]''. However, some have argued that it does match what is known as [[Irony#Situational irony|situational irony]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/05/08/what_everybody_gets_wrong_about_alanis_morissettes_ironic_partner/|title=What everybody gets wrong about Alanis Morissette's \"Ironic\"|last=Roberts|first=Michael Reid|website=Salon|access-date=2017-07-24}}</ref>\n\nThe track topped the Canadian [[RPM (magazine)|''RPM'']] Top Singles chart for six weeks, and reached the top five in Australia, New Zealand and Norway. In the United States, the song reached number four on April 13, 1996, and currently is her highest-charting single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. \"Ironic\" was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The song won the [[Juno Award]] for [[Juno Award for Single of the Year|Single of the Year]], and received two [[Grammy Award]] nominations in [[39th Grammy Awards|1997]], for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Best Short Form Music Video]]. French director [[St\u00e9phane Sednaoui]] filmed the music video. In it, Morissette drives through a winter landscape, and she plays [[Dual role|multiple roles]] as her passengers. MTV nominated the music video for six [[MTV Video Music Awards]] in [[1996 MTV Video Music Awards|1996]], winning three of them.

Then, she drives her car through a winter landscape, and she begins to sing the song's [[Verse (popular music)#Verse|first verse]]. When it comes to the [[Refrain|chorus]], a second Morissette comes in. She is in a green sweater and sits in the backseat on the passenger side. When the first chorus ends, a third Morissette comes in, and she is in a yellow sweater with braided hair, also in the backseat, but on the driver's side. Along the way, the yellow Morissette is singing and eating at the same time, and when it comes to the second verse, a fourth and last Morissette comes in, she is in a red sweater sitting in the front passenger seat. During the second chorus, she climbs out of the window when they are still driving and almost gets knocked out by a bridge, but still manages a smile after doing so. The camera comes back to the driving Morissette, after the breakdown, and she takes off her hat, tosses it into the back seat, and becomes as loud as the other three while singing the song. When Morissette sings the [[Conclusion (music)|outro]], she is still driving through the winter landscape, and suddenly the car breaks down (possibly having run out of gas, which may be \"ironic\" in itself since the video started with her at a gas station). Morissette (as the driver) gets out of the car, and all her \"passengers\" have disappeared.\n\nIn an interview for ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' in 2015, Morissette revealed that her clothes in the video reflected the personalities of each character. The driver in a red knit beanie was the one in control, \"the responsible one\". The spunky character, who Morissette refers to as the \u201cquirkster,\u201d wears a yellow sweater with a crown of long swaying braids. Morissette liked the braids so much that she would often wear them on stage. The passenger-seat girl wearing a deep red sweater and pajama-type pants was \"the romantic\u2014wistful and thoughtful and also the risk-taker\". As for the girl head-banging in the backseat in green sweater, Morissette said; \"The girl in green feels the most like the 'whole me'. The green sweater girl\u2014fun and frolic-y. [She] gets into trouble\u2014she's the girl you want with you when you are heading to a water park.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.vogue.com/article/alanis-morissette-nineties-style-ironic |title=Isn\u2019t It Ironic?

He commented that unlike [[Britney Spears]]' \"[[Lucky (Britney Spears song)|Lucky]]\" music video, where Spears plays dual role of a girl named \"Lucky\" and her fan, and both appear together in some scenes helped by [[visual effects]], \"Ironic\" does not utilize them, using solely [[film editing|editing]], giving the sense that all the Morissettes interact with each other.<ref>{{cite book|title=Television: Critical Methods and Applications|first=Blaine |last=Allan |location=[[Mahwah, New Jersey]]|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|page=310|isbn=0-8058-5415-0|oclc=71005849|edition=3rd}}</ref> Journalist Carol Vernallis also found that Morissette's \"[[wiktionary:chit-chat|chitchat]]\" way of singing the song creates an intimate connection viewer. She mentioned the video in her book ''Experiencing Music Video: Aesthetics and Cultural Context'' (2004), where she studied how the audience may pay attention to the lyrics of the song in a music video.

It was released in February 1996 as the third single from her third [[studio album]], ''[[Jagged Little Pill]]'' (1995). It was written by Morissette and [[Glen Ballard]], and was produced by him. \"Ironic\" is a song written in the key of [[B major]], and includes a moderate tempo of eighty-five beats per minute. The lyrics present several situations that are described as \"ironic\"; this has led to debate as to whether any of these actually match the accepted meaning of ''[[irony]]''. However, some have argued that it does match what is known as [[Irony#Situational irony|situational irony]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/05/08/what_everybody_gets_wrong_about_alanis_morissettes_ironic_partner/|title=What everybody gets wrong about Alanis Morissette's \"Ironic\"|last=Roberts|first=Michael Reid|website=Salon|access-date=2017-07-24}}</ref>\n\nThe track topped the Canadian [[RPM (magazine)|''RPM'']] Top Singles chart for six weeks, and reached the top five in Australia, New Zealand and Norway.

Then, she drives her car through a winter landscape, and she begins to sing the song's [[Verse (popular music)#Verse|first verse]]. When it comes to the [[Refrain|chorus]], a second Morissette comes in. She is in a green sweater and sits in the backseat on the passenger side. When the first chorus ends, a third Morissette comes in, and she is in a yellow sweater with braided hair, also in the backseat, but on the driver's side. Along the way, the yellow Morissette is singing and eating at the same time, and when it comes to the second verse, a fourth and last Morissette comes in, she is in a red sweater sitting in the front passenger seat. During the second chorus, she climbs out of the window when they are still driving and almost gets knocked out by a bridge, but still manages a smile after doing so. The camera comes back to the driving Morissette, after the breakdown, and she takes off her hat, tosses it into the back seat, and becomes as loud as the other three while singing the song. When Morissette sings the [[Conclusion (music)|outro]], she is still driving through the winter landscape, and suddenly the car breaks down (possibly having run out of gas, which may be \"ironic\" in itself since the video started with her at a gas station). Morissette (as the driver) gets out of the car, and all her \"passengers\" have disappeared.\n\nIn an interview for ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' in 2015, Morissette revealed that her clothes in the video reflected the personalities of each character. The driver in a red knit beanie was the one in control, \"the responsible one\". The spunky character, who Morissette refers to as the \u201cquirkster,\u201d wears a yellow sweater with a crown of long swaying braids. Morissette liked the braids so much that she would often wear them on stage. The passenger-seat girl wearing a deep red sweater and pajama-type pants was \"the romantic\u2014wistful and thoughtful and also the risk-taker\". As for the girl head-banging in the backseat in green sweater, Morissette said; \"The girl in green feels the most like the 'whole me'. The green sweater girl\u2014fun and frolic-y. [She] gets into trouble\u2014she's the girl you want with you when you are heading to a water park.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.vogue.com/article/alanis-morissette-nineties-style-ironic |title=Isn\u2019t It Ironic?

He commented that unlike [[Britney Spears]]' \"[[Lucky (Britney Spears song)|Lucky]]\" music video, where Spears plays dual role of a girl named \"Lucky\" and her fan, and both appear together in some scenes helped by [[visual effects]], \"Ironic\" does not utilize them, using solely [[film editing|editing]], giving the sense that all the Morissettes interact with each other.<ref>{{cite book|title=Television: Critical Methods and Applications|first=Blaine |last=Allan |location=[[Mahwah, New Jersey]]|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|page=310|isbn=0-8058-5415-0|oclc=71005849|edition=3rd}}</ref> Journalist Carol Vernallis also found that Morissette's \"[[wiktionary:chit-chat|chitchat]]\" way of singing the song creates an intimate connection viewer. She mentioned the video in her book ''Experiencing Music Video: Aesthetics and Cultural Context'' (2004), where she studied how the audience may pay attention to the lyrics of the song in a music video.

It was written by Timberlake and [[Scott Storch]] with producer [[Timbaland]] and was inspired by Timberlake's former relationship with singer [[Britney Spears]]. [[Jive Records]] released the song to [[Contemporary hit radio|contemporary hit]] and [[Rhythmic contemporary|rhythmic radio]] in the United States on November 26, 2002, as the album's second single. Accompanied by an [[electric piano]], [[Beatboxing|beatbox]], guitars, [[synthesizer]]s, [[Arabic music|Arabian]]-inspired [[riffs]] and [[Gregorian chant]]s, \"Cry Me a River\" is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his last girlfriend, who had cheated on him.\n\n\"Cry Me a River\" received acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who considered it a stand-out track on ''Justified'' and praised Timbaland's production. The song earned several lists of best of the year and the decade (2000s), while ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' included it on their [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] at 484. It won a [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[2004 Grammy Awards|2004 ceremony]]. The song peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Pop Songs]] charts and charted in the top ten in other countries. It was certified double platinum by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) and platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI).\n\nFilmmaker [[Francis Lawrence]] directed the music video for \"Cry Me a River\" in [[Malibu, California]]. In the controversial video, Timberlake's character invades the home of his ex-lover and films himself having sexual relations with another woman. Spears alleged that the video was a [[publicity stunt]], but Timberlake maintained that she did not inspire the production. The clip won the awards for [[Best Male Video]] and [[Best Pop Video]] at the [[2003 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Timberlake performed \"Cry Me a River\" on his four major concert tours: [[The Justified World Tour]] (2003\u201304), [[Justified and Stripped Tour]] (2003), [[FutureSex/LoveShow]] (2007), and [[The 20/20 Experience World Tour]] (2013\u201315). The song has been covered by various recording artists, including [[Kelly Clarkson]] and [[Taylor Swift]].\n\n==Writing and production==\n[[File:Britney Spears.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A blond woman wearing a black and white top and black pants is performing|Timberlake acknowledged in December 2011 that the inspiration for \"Cry Me a River\" was his ended relationship with [[Britney Spears]].]]\n\nTimberlake and [[Scott Storch]] wrote \"Cry Me a River\" with [[Timbaland]], who produced the song.<ref name=\"Notes\"/> Storch found working with Timberlake easy because of the song's meaning.<ref name=\"mtv4\"/> Reporters believed its lyrics were inspired by Timberlake's romantic relationship with American recording artist [[Britney Spears]],<ref name=\"mtv1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458390/timberlake-readies-new-single.jhtml?headlines=true|title=Justin Tightlipped About Whether 'River' Flows From Britney|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=October 29, 2002|accessdate=September 5, 2011|work=MTV News}}</ref> which ended in 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1974703_1974707_1974580,00.html|title=Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, 2002|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|last=Webley|first=Kayla|date=March 23, 2010|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref> Timberlake told [[MTV News]], \"I'm not going to specifically say if any song is about anybody.

It was written by Timberlake and [[Scott Storch]] with producer [[Timbaland]] and was inspired by Timberlake's former relationship with singer [[Britney Spears]]. [[Jive Records]] released the song to [[Contemporary hit radio|contemporary hit]] and [[Rhythmic contemporary|rhythmic radio]] in the United States on November 26, 2002, as the album's second single. Accompanied by an [[electric piano]], [[Beatboxing|beatbox]], guitars, [[synthesizer]]s, [[Arabic music|Arabian]]-inspired [[riffs]] and [[Gregorian chant]]s, \"Cry Me a River\" is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his last girlfriend, who had cheated on him.\n\n\"Cry Me a River\" received acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who considered it a stand-out track on ''Justified'' and praised Timbaland's production. The song earned several lists of best of the year and the decade (2000s), while ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' included it on their [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] at 484. It won a [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[2004 Grammy Awards|2004 ceremony]]. The song peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Pop Songs]] charts and charted in the top ten in other countries. It was certified double platinum by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) and platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI).\n\nFilmmaker [[Francis Lawrence]] directed the music video for \"Cry Me a River\" in [[Malibu, California]]. In the controversial video, Timberlake's character invades the home of his ex-lover and films himself having sexual relations with another woman. Spears alleged that the video was a [[publicity stunt]], but Timberlake maintained that she did not inspire the production. The clip won the awards for [[Best Male Video]] and [[Best Pop Video]] at the [[2003 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Timberlake performed \"Cry Me a River\" on his four major concert tours: [[The Justified World Tour]] (2003\u201304), [[Justified and Stripped Tour]] (2003), [[FutureSex/LoveShow]] (2007), and [[The 20/20 Experience World Tour]] (2013\u201315). The song has been covered by various recording artists, including [[Kelly Clarkson]] and [[Taylor Swift]].\n\n==Writing and production==\n[[File:Britney Spears.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A blond woman wearing a black and white top and black pants is performing|Timberlake acknowledged in December 2011 that the inspiration for \"Cry Me a River\" was his ended relationship with [[Britney Spears]].]]\n\nTimberlake and [[Scott Storch]] wrote \"Cry Me a River\" with [[Timbaland]], who produced the song.<ref name=\"Notes\"/> Storch found working with Timberlake easy because of the song's meaning.<ref name=\"mtv4\"/> Reporters believed its lyrics were inspired by Timberlake's romantic relationship with American recording artist [[Britney Spears]],<ref name=\"mtv1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458390/timberlake-readies-new-single.jhtml?headlines=true|title=Justin Tightlipped About Whether 'River' Flows From Britney|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=October 29, 2002|accessdate=September 5, 2011|work=MTV News}}</ref> which ended in 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1974703_1974707_1974580,00.html|title=Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, 2002|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|last=Webley|first=Kayla|date=March 23, 2010|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref> Timberlake told [[MTV News]], \"I'm not going to specifically say if any song is about anybody.

It was released in June 1986 as the second single from the album ''[[Into the Light (Chris de Burgh album)|Into the Light]]''. The song was responsible for introducing de Burgh's music to a mainstream audience worldwide.\n\n==Creation==\nThe song was written in reference to (though not specifically about) his wife Diane and was released on the album ''Into the Light''. On the British TV series ''[[This Is Your Life]]'', de Burgh said that the song was inspired by the memory of when he first saw Diane, and how men so often cannot even remember what their wives were wearing when they first met.<ref>{{cite web|title= Lady In Red by Chris de Burgh |publisher= Songfacts |url= http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3060 |accessdate= 27 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception and impact==\nThe song was a massive hit across the world, quickly becoming de Burgh's best-selling single and his [[signature song]], transforming him from a [[Cult following|cult artist]] into a household name in many countries. It reached the number one position in Canada, the UK, Ireland, Norway and the Flanders region of Belgium. It also reached number three in the United States during the spring of 1987. The song also propelled its parent album ''Into The Light'' to the number two position in the United Kingdom and success in other markets. The song was de Burgh's third UK hit single and the first to reach the top 40.<ref>{{cite book|first= David |last= Roberts |year= 2006 |title= [[British Hit Singles & Albums]] |edition= 19th |publisher= [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Records Limited]] |location= London |isbn= 1-904994-10-5}}</ref>\n\nThe song tends to divide public opinion and it was voted the tenth most annoying song of all time in a poll commissioned by [[Dotmusic]] in 2000.

It was released in June 1986 as the second single from the album ''[[Into the Light (Chris de Burgh album)|Into the Light]]''. The song was responsible for introducing de Burgh's music to a mainstream audience worldwide.\n\n==Creation==\nThe song was written in reference to (though not specifically about) his wife Diane and was released on the album ''Into the Light''. On the British TV series ''[[This Is Your Life]]'', de Burgh said that the song was inspired by the memory of when he first saw Diane, and how men so often cannot even remember what their wives were wearing when they first met.<ref>{{cite web|title= Lady In Red by Chris de Burgh |publisher= Songfacts |url= http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3060 |accessdate= 27 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception and impact==\nThe song was a massive hit across the world, quickly becoming de Burgh's best-selling single and his [[signature song]], transforming him from a [[Cult following|cult artist]] into a household name in many countries. It reached the number one position in Canada, the UK, Ireland, Norway and the Flanders region of Belgium. It also reached number three in the United States during the spring of 1987. The song also propelled its parent album ''Into The Light'' to the number two position in the United Kingdom and success in other markets. The song was de Burgh's third UK hit single and the first to reach the top 40.<ref>{{cite book|first= David |last= Roberts |year= 2006 |title= [[British Hit Singles & Albums]] |edition= 19th |publisher= [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Records Limited]] |location= London |isbn= 1-904994-10-5}}</ref>\n\nThe song tends to divide public opinion and it was voted the tenth most annoying song of all time in a poll commissioned by [[Dotmusic]] in 2000.
