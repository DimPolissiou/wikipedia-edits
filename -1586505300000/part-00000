These enter the lungs where they branch into progressively narrower secondary and tertiary bronchi that branch into numerous smaller tubes, the [[bronchiole]]s. In [[bird]]s the bronchioles are termed [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|parabronchi]]. It is the bronchioles, or parabronchi that generally open into the microscopic [[pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] in mammals and [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|atria]] in birds. Air has to be pumped from the environment into the alveoli or atria by the process of [[breathing]] which involves the [[muscles of respiration]].\n\nIn most [[fish]], and a number of other [[aquatic animal]]s (both [[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s) the respiratory system consists of [[gill]]s, which are either partially or completely external organs, bathed in the watery environment. This water flows over the gills by a variety of active or passive means. Gas exchange takes place in the gills which consist of thin or very flat [[Gill#Vertebrate gills|filaments]] and [[Gill#Vertebrate gills|lammelae]] which expose a very large surface area of highly [[blood vessel|vascularized]] tissue to the water.\n\nOther animals, such as [[insects]], have respiratory systems with very simple anatomical features, and in [[amphibians]] even the [[skin]] plays a vital role in gas exchange. [[Plants]] also have respiratory systems but the directionality of gas exchange can be opposite to that in animals. The respiratory system in plants includes anatomical features such as [[stoma]]ta, that are found in various parts of the plant.<ref>{{cite book|last=West|first=John B.|title=Respiratory physiology-- the essentials|publisher=Williams & Wilkins|location=Baltimore|pages=[https://archive.org/details/respiratoryphysi00west/page/1 1\u201310]|isbn=0-683-08937-4|url=https://archive.org/details/respiratoryphysi00west/page/1|year=1995}}</ref>\n\n==Mammals==\n===Anatomy===\n{{Main|Lung|Respiratory tract}}\n[[File:Poumons2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|'''Fig. 1.'''

The color code is the same as on the left. In addition to a more forceful and extensive contraction of the diaphragm, the intercostal muscles are aided by the accessory muscles of inhalation to exaggerate the movement of the ribs upwards, causing a greater expansion of the rib cage. During exhalation, apart from the relaxation of the muscles of inhalation, the abdominal muscles actively contract to pull the lower edges of the rib cage downwards decreasing the volume of the rib cage, while at the same time pushing the diaphragm upwards deep into the thorax.\n| width1 = 200\n| image1 = Quiet breathing.jpg\n| caption1 = '''Fig. 7''' The muscles of breathing at rest: inhalation on the left, exhalation on the right. Contracting muscles are shown in red; relaxed muscles in blue. Contraction of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] generally contributes the most to the expansion of the chest cavity (light blue). However, at the same time, the intercostal muscles pull the ribs upwards (their effect is indicated by arrows) also causing the [[rib cage]] to expand during inhalation (see diagram on other side of the page). The relaxation of all these muscles during exhalation cause the rib cage and abdomen (light green) to elastically return to their resting positions. Compare with Fig. 6, the MRI video of the chest movements during the breathing cycle.\n}}\nIn [[mammals]], inhalation at rest is primarily due to the contraction of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]. This is an upwardly domed sheet of muscle that separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity. When it contracts the sheet flattens, (i.e. moves downwards as shown in Fig.&nbsp;7) increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity. The contracting diaphragm  pushes the abdominal organs downwards. But because the pelvic floor prevents the lowermost abdominal organs moving in that direction, the pliable abdominal contents cause the belly to bulge outwards to the front and sides, because the relaxed abdominal muscles do not resist this movement (Fig.&nbsp;7). This entirely passive bulging (and shrinking during exhalation) of the abdomen during normal breathing is sometimes referred to as \"abdominal breathing\", although it is, in fact, \"diaphragmatic breathing\", which is not visible on the outside of the body. Mammals only use their abdominal muscles only during forceful exhalation (see Fig.&nbsp;8, and discussion below). Never during any form of inhalation.\n\nAs the diaphragm contracts, the [[rib cage]] is simultaneously enlarged by the ribs being pulled upwards by the [[intercostal muscles]] as shown in Fig.&nbsp;4. All the ribs slant downwards from the rear to the front (as shown in Fig.&nbsp;4); but the lowermost ribs ''also'' slant downwards from the midline outwards (Fig.&nbsp;5). Thus the rib cage's transverse diameter can be increased in the same way as the antero-posterior diameter is increase by the so-called [[pump handle movement]] shown in Fig.&nbsp;4.\n\nThe enlargement of the thoracic cavity's vertical dimension by the contraction of the diaphragm, and its two horizontal dimensions by the lifting of the front and sides of the ribs, causes the intrathoracic pressure to fall. The lungs' interiors are open to the outside air, and being elastic, therefore expand to fill the increased space. The inflow of air into the lungs occurs via the [[respiratory airways]] (Fig. 2). In health these airways (starting at the nose or mouth, and ending in the microscopic dead-end sacs called [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]]) are always open, though the diameters of the various sections can be changed by the [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and [[parasympathetic nervous system]]s. The alveolar air pressure is therefore always close to atmospheric air pressure (about 100&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]] at sea level) at rest, with the pressure gradients that cause air to move in and out of the lungs during breathing rarely exceeding 2\u20133&nbsp;kPa.<ref name=\"Chrisvan L 1995\">{{cite journal |last1=Koen |first1=Chrisvan L. |last2=Koeslag |first2=Johan H. | title=On the stability of subatmospheric intrapleural and intracranial pressures |journal= News in Physiological Sciences | date=1995 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=176\u2013178 |doi=10.1152/physiologyonline.1995.10.4.176}}</ref><ref name=\"Williams & Wilkins\">{{cite book |last1=West |first1=J.B. |title=Respiratory physiology: the essentials. |location=Baltimore |publisher=Williams & Wilkins |date=1985| pages= 21\u201330, 84\u201384, 98\u2013101 }}</ref>\n\nDuring exhalation the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax.

The oxygen [[Partial pressure|tension]] (or partial pressure) remains close to 13-14&nbsp;kPa (about 100&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg), and that of carbon dioxide very close to 5.3&nbsp;kPa (or 40&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg). This contrasts with composition of the dry outside air at sea level, where the partial pressure of oxygen is 21&nbsp;kPa (or 160&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg) and that of carbon dioxide 0.04&nbsp;kPa (or 0.3&nbsp;mmHg).<ref name=tortora1 />\n\nDuring heavy breathing ([[hyperpnea]]), as, for instance, during exercise, inhalation is brought about by a more powerful and greater excursion of the contracting diaphragm than at rest (Fig. 8). In addition the \"[[accessory muscles of respiration|accessory muscles of inhalation]]\" exaggerate the actions of the intercostal muscles (Fig. 8). These accessory muscles of inhalation are muscles that extend from the [[cervical vertebrae]] and base of the skull to the upper ribs and [[sternum]], sometimes through an intermediary attachment to the [[clavicle]]s.<ref name=tortora1 /> When they contract the rib cage's internal volume is increased to a far greater extent than can be achieved by contraction of the intercostal muscles alone. Seen from outside the body the lifting of the clavicles during strenuous or labored inhalation is sometimes called [[clavicular breathing]], seen especially during [[asthma]] attacks and in people with [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].\n\nDuring heavy breathing, exhalation is caused by relaxation of all the muscles of inhalation. But now, the abdominal muscles, instead of remaining relaxed (as they do at rest), contract forcibly pulling the lower edges of the [[Rib cage#Function|rib cage]] downwards (front and sides) (Fig.&nbsp;8). This not only drastically decreases the size of the rib cage, but also pushes the abdominal organs upwards against the diaphragm which consequently bulges deeply into the thorax (Fig.&nbsp;8). The end-exhalatory lung volume is now well below the resting mid-position and contains far less air than the resting \"functional residual capacity\". However, in a normal mammal, the lungs cannot be emptied completely. In an adult human there is always still at least 1 liter of residual air left in the lungs after maximum exhalation.<ref name=tortora1 />\n\nThe automatic rhythmical breathing in and out, can be interrupted by coughing, sneezing (forms of very forceful exhalation), by the expression of a wide range of emotions (laughing, sighing, crying out in pain, exasperated intakes of breath) and by such voluntary acts as speech, singing, whistling and the playing of wind instruments. All of these actions rely on the muscles described above, and their effects on the movement of air in and out of the lungs.\n\nAlthough not a form of breathing, the [[Valsalva maneuver]] involves the respiratory muscles. It is, in fact, a very forceful exhalatory effort against a tightly closed [[glottis]], so that no air can escape from the lungs.<ref name=\"taylor\">{{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=D |title=The Valsalva Manoeuvre: A critical review |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=26 |issue=1 |year=1996 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6264 |accessdate=14 March 2016}}</ref> Instead abdominal contents are evacuated in the opposite direction, through orifices in the pelvic floor.  The abdominal muscles contract very powerfully, causing the pressure inside the abdomen and thorax to rise to extremely high levels. The Valsalva maneuver can be carried out voluntarily, but is more generally a reflex elicited when attempting to empty the abdomen during, for instance, difficult defecation, or during childbirth. Breathing ceases during this maneuver.\n\n===Gas exchange===\n{{Main|Gas exchange}}\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| align = right\n| header = Mechanism of gas exchange \n| width1 = 250\n| image1 = Gas exchange.jpg\n| caption1 = '''Fig. 11''' A highly diagrammatic illustration of the process of gas exchange in the mammalian lungs, emphasizing the differences between the gas compositions of the ambient air, the alveolar air (light blue) with which the pulmonary capillary blood equilibrates, and the blood gas tensions in the pulmonary arterial (blue blood entering the lung on the left) and venous blood (red blood leaving the lung on the right).

This ensures that equilibration of the partial pressures of the gases in the two compartments is very efficient and occurs very quickly. The blood leaving the alveolar capillaries and is eventually distributed throughout the body therefore has a [[partial pressure]] of oxygen of 13-14&nbsp;kPa (100&nbsp;mmHg), and a [[PCO2|partial pressure of carbon dioxide]] of 5.3&nbsp;kPa (40&nbsp;mmHg) (i.e. the same as the oxygen and carbon dioxide gas tensions as in the alveoli).<ref name=tortora1 /> As mentioned in [[Respiratory system#Mechanics of breathing|the section above]], the corresponding partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the ambient (dry) air at sea level are 21&nbsp;kPa (160&nbsp;mmHg) and 0.04&nbsp;kPa (0.3&nbsp;mmHg) respectively.<ref name=tortora1 />\n\nThis marked difference between the composition of the alveolar air and that of the ambient air can be maintained because the [[functional residual capacity]] is contained in dead-end sacs connected to the outside air by fairly narrow and relatively long tubes (the airways: [[nose]], [[pharynx]], [[larynx]], [[trachea]], [[bronchi]] and their branches down to the [[bronchioles]]), through which the air has to be breathed both in and out (i.e. there is no unidirectional through-flow as there is in the [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|bird lung]]). This typical mammalian anatomy combined with the fact that the lungs are not emptied and re-inflated with each breath (leaving a substantial volume of air, of about 2.5-3.0&nbsp;liters, in the alveoli after exhalation), ensures that the composition of the alveolar air is only minimally disturbed when the 350&nbsp;ml of fresh air is mixed into it with each inhalation. Thus the animal is provided with a very special \"portable atmosphere\", whose composition differs significantly from the [[Great Oxygenation Event|present-day ambient air]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lovelock |first1=James | title=Healing Gaia: Practical medicine for the Planet|url=https://archive.org/details/healinggaiaprac00love |url-access=registration |pages=21\u201334, 73\u201388|location=New York |publisher=Harmony Books |date=1991|isbn= 0-517-57848-4}}</ref> It is this portable atmosphere (the [[functional residual capacity]]) to which the blood and therefore the body tissues are exposed \u2013 not to the outside air.\n\nThe resulting arterial partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide are [[Homeostasis#Blood partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide|homeostatically controlled]]. A rise in the arterial partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> and, to a lesser extent, a fall in the arterial partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub>, will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing till the [[blood gas tension]]s in the lungs, and therefore the arterial blood, return to normal. The converse happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a lesser extent, the oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced till blood gas normality is restored.\n\nSince the blood arriving in the alveolar capillaries has a partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> of, on average, 6&nbsp;kPa (45&nbsp;mmHg), while the pressure in the alveolar air is 13-14&nbsp;kPa (100&nbsp;mmHg), there will be a net diffusion of oxygen into the capillary blood, changing the composition of the 3&nbsp;liters of alveolar air slightly. Similarly, since the blood arriving in the alveolar capillaries has a partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> of also about 6&nbsp;kPa (45&nbsp;mmHg), whereas that of the alveolar air is 5.3&nbsp;kPa (40&nbsp;mmHg), there is a net movement of carbon dioxide out of the capillaries into the alveoli. The changes brought about by these net flows of individual gases into and out of the alveolar air necessitate the replacement of about 15% of the alveolar air with ambient air every  5&nbsp;seconds or so. This is very tightly controlled by the monitoring of the arterial blood gases (which accurately reflect composition of the alveolar air) by the [[Aortic body|aortic]] and [[Carotid body|carotid bodies]], as well as by the [[Central chemoreceptors|blood gas and pH sensor]] on the anterior surface of the [[medulla oblongata]] in the brain. There are also oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors in the lungs, but they primarily determine the diameters of the [[bronchioles]] and [[Pulmonary circulation|pulmonary capillaries]], and are therefore responsible for directing the flow of air and blood to different parts of the lungs.\n\nIt is only as a result of accurately maintaining the composition of the 3&nbsp;liters of alveolar air that with each breath some carbon dioxide is discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up from the outside air. If more carbon dioxide than usual has been lost by a short period of [[hyperventilation]], respiration will be slowed down or halted until the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide has returned to 5.3&nbsp;kPa (40&nbsp;mmHg). It is therefore strictly speaking untrue that the primary function of the respiratory system is to rid the body of carbon dioxide \u201cwaste\u201d. The carbon dioxide that is breathed out with each breath could probably be more correctly be seen as a byproduct of the body's extracellular fluid [[Homeostasis#Blood partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide]] and  [[Homeostasis#Extracellular fluid pH|pH homeostats]]\n \nIf these homeostats are compromised, then a [[respiratory acidosis]], or a [[respiratory alkalosis]] will occur. In the long run these can be compensated by renal adjustments to the [[Acid-base homeostasis|H<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> concentrations in the plasma]]; but since this takes time, the [[hyperventilation syndrome]] can, for instance, occur when agitation or anxiety cause a person to breathe fast and deeply thus causing a distressing [[respiratory alkalosis]] through the blowing off of too much CO<sub>2</sub> from the blood into the outside air.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shu|first=BC |author2=Chang, YY |author3=Lee, FY |author4=Tzeng, DS |author5=Lin, HY |author6=Lung, FW|title=Parental attachment, premorbid personality, and mental health in young males with hyperventilation syndrome.|journal=Psychiatry Research|date=2007-10-31|volume=153|issue=2|pages=163\u201370|pmid=17659783|doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2006.05.006}}</ref>\n\nOxygen has a very low solubility in water, and is therefore carried in the blood loosely combined with [[hemoglobin]].

During inhalation the air is warmed and saturated with water vapor during its passage through the [[nasal cavity|nose passages]] and [[pharynx]]. [[Vapour pressure of water|Saturated water vapor pressure]] is dependent only on temperature. At a body core temperature of 37&nbsp;\u00b0C  it is 6.3&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]] (47.0&nbsp;mmHg), irrespective of any other influences, including altitude.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Diem |first1=K. |last2=Lenter| first2= C.|title=Scientific Tables| location=Basle, Switzerland|publisher=Ciba-Geigy |date=1970|edition= Seventh| pages= 257\u2013258 }}</ref> Thus at sea level, where the ambient atmospheric pressure is about 100&nbsp;kPa, the moistened air that flows into the lungs from the [[trachea]] consists of water vapor (6.3&nbsp;kPa), nitrogen (74.0&nbsp;kPa), oxygen (19.7&nbsp;kPa) and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases (a total of 100&nbsp;kPa). In dry air the [[partial pressure]] of O<sub>2</sub> at sea level is 21.0&nbsp;kPa (i.e. 21% of 100&nbsp;kPa), compared to the 19.7&nbsp;kPa of oxygen entering the alveolar air. (The tracheal partial pressure of oxygen is 21% of [100&nbsp;kPa \u2013 6.3&nbsp;kPa] = 19.7&nbsp;kPa).  At the summit of [[Mount Everest|Mt. Everest]] (at an altitude of 8,848&nbsp;m or 29,029&nbsp;ft) the total [[Mount Everest#Death zone|atmospheric pressure is 33.7&nbsp;kPa]], of which 7.1&nbsp;kPa (or 21%) is oxygen.<ref name=altitude /> The air entering the lungs also has a total pressure of 33.7&nbsp;kPa, of which 6.3&nbsp;kPa is, unavoidably, water vapor (as it is at sea level). This reduces the partial pressure of oxygen entering the alveoli to 5.8&nbsp;kPa (or 21% of [33.7&nbsp;kPa \u2013 6.3&nbsp;kPa] = 5.8&nbsp;kPa). The reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen in the inhaled air is therefore substantially greater than the reduction of the total atmospheric pressure at altitude would suggest (on Mt Everest: 5.8&nbsp;kPa ''vs.'' 7.1&nbsp;kPa).\n\nA further minor complication exists at altitude. If the volume of the lungs were to be instantaneously doubled at the beginning of inhalation, the air pressure inside the lungs would be halved. This happens regardless of altitude. Thus, halving of the sea level air pressure (100&nbsp;kPa) results in an intrapulmonary air pressure of 50&nbsp;kPa. Doing the same at 5500&nbsp;m, where the atmospheric pressure is only 50&nbsp;kPa,  the intrapulmonary air pressure falls to 25&nbsp;kPa. Therefore, the same change in lung volume at sea level results in a 50&nbsp;kPa difference in pressure between the ambient air and the intrapulmonary air, whereas it result in a difference of only 25&nbsp;kPa at 5500&nbsp;m. The driving pressure forcing air into the lungs during inhalation is therefore halved at this altitude. The ''rate'' of inflow of air into the lungs during inhalation at sea level is therefore twice that which occurs at 5500&nbsp;m. However, in reality, inhalation and exhalation occur far more gently and less abruptly than in the example given. The differences between the atmospheric and intrapulmonary pressures, driving air in and out of the lungs during the breathing cycle, are in the region of only 2\u20133&nbsp;kPa.<ref name=\"Chrisvan L 1995\"/><ref name=\"Williams & Wilkins\"/> A doubling or more of these small pressure differences could be achieved only by very major changes in the breathing effort at high altitudes.\n\nAll of the above influences of low atmospheric pressures on breathing are accommodated primarily by breathing deeper and faster ([[hyperpnea]]).  The exact degree of hyperpnea is determined by the [[Homeostasis#Blood partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide|blood gas homeostat]], which regulates the [[partial pressure]]s of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. This [[Homeostasis|homeostat]] prioritizes the regulation of the arterial [[partial pressure]] of carbon dioxide over that of oxygen at sea level.<ref name=tortora1 /> That is to say, at sea level the arterial partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> is maintained at very close to 5.3&nbsp;kPa (or 40&nbsp;mmHg) under a wide range of circumstances, at the expense of the arterial partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub>, which is allowed to vary within a very wide range of values, before eliciting a corrective ventilatory response.  However, when the atmospheric pressure (and therefore the partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> in the ambient air) falls to below 50-75% of its value at sea level, oxygen [[homeostasis]] is given priority over carbon dioxide homeostasis.<ref name=tortora1 /> This switch-over occurs at an elevation of about 2500&nbsp;m (or about 8000&nbsp;ft). If this switch occurs relatively abruptly, the hyperpnea at high altitude will cause a severe fall in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, with a [[Homeostasis#Extracellular fluid pH|consequent rise in the pH of the arterial plasma]]. This is one contributor to [[Altitude sickness|high altitude sickness]]. On the other hand, if the switch to oxygen homeostasis is incomplete, then [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] may complicate the clinical picture with potentially fatal results.\n\nThere are oxygen sensors in the smaller [[Bronchus|bronchi]] and [[bronchiole]]s. In response to low partial pressures of oxygen in the inhaled air these sensors reflexively cause the pulmonary arterioles to constrict.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Von Euler |first1=U.S. |last2= Liljestrand |first2=G. | title= Observations on the pulmonary arterial blood pressure in the cat |journal= Acta Physiologica Scandinavica | date=1946 |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=301\u2013320 |doi=10.1111/j.1748-1716.1946.tb00389.x}}</ref> (This is the exact opposite of the corresponding reflex in the tissues, where low arterial partial pressures of O<sub>2</sub> cause arteriolar vasodilation.) At altitude this causes the [[Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction|pulmonary arterial pressure to rise]] resulting in a much more even distribution of blood flow to the lungs than occurs at sea level. At sea level the pulmonary arterial pressure is very low, with the result that [[Ventilation/perfusion ratio#Physiology|the tops of the lungs receive far less blood than the bases]], which are relatively over-perfused with blood. It is only in the middle of the lungs that the [[Ventilation/perfusion ratio#Physiology|blood and air flow to the alveoli are ideally matched]]. At altitude this variation in the [[ventilation/perfusion ratio]] of alveoli from the tops of the lungs to the bottoms is eliminated, with all the alveoli perfused and ventilated in more or less the physiologically ideal manner. This is a further important contributor to the [[Effects of high altitude on humans#Acclimatization to altitude|acclimatatization to high altitudes]] and low oxygen pressures.\n\nThe kidneys measure the oxygen ''content'' (mmol&nbsp;O<sub>2</sub>/liter blood, rather than the partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub>) of the arterial blood.

In this manner, irritants caught in the [[mucus]] which lines the respiratory tract are expelled or moved to the [[mouth]] where they can be [[swallowed]].<ref name=tortora1 /> During coughing, contraction of the smooth muscle in the airway walls narrows the trachea by pulling the ends of the cartilage plates together and by pushing soft tissue into the lumen. This increases the expired airflow rate to dislodge and remove any irritant particle or mucus.\n\n[[Respiratory epithelium]] can secrete a variety of molecules that aid in the defense of the lungs. These include secretory [[immunoglobulin]]s (IgA), [[collectin]]s, [[defensin]]s and other peptides and [[proteases]], [[reactive oxygen species]], and [[reactive nitrogen species]]. These secretions can act directly as antimicrobials to help keep the airway free of infection. A variety of [[chemokine]]s and [[cytokine]]s are also secreted that recruit the traditional immune cells and others to the site of infections.\n\n[[Pulmonary surfactant|Surfactant]] immune function is primarily attributed to two proteins: SP-A and SP-D. These proteins can bind to sugars on the surface of pathogens and thereby [[opsonize]] them for uptake by phagocytes. It also regulates inflammatory responses and interacts with the adaptive immune response.

It floats on the surface of the thin watery layer which lines the insides of the alveoli, reducing the water's surface tension.\n\nThe surface tension of a watery surface (the water-air interface) tends to make that surface shrink.<ref name=tortora1 /> When that surface is curved as it is in the alveoli of the lungs, the shrinkage of the surface decreases the diameter of the alveoli. The more acute the curvature of the water-air interface [[Pulmonary surfactant#Function|the greater the tendency for the alveolus to collapse]].<ref name=tortora1 /> This has three effects. Firstly the surface tension inside the alveoli resists expansion of the alveoli during inhalation (i.e. it makes the lung stiff, or non-compliant). Surfactant reduces the surface tension and therefore makes the lungs more [[Pulmonary compliance|compliant]], or less stiff, than if it were not there. Secondly, the diameters of the alveoli increase and decrease during the breathing cycle. This means that the alveoli have a [[Pulmonary surfactant#Compliance|greater tendency to collapse]] (i.e. cause [[atelectasis]]) at the end of exhalation that at the end of inhalation. Since surfactant floats on the watery surface, its molecules are more tightly packed together when the alveoli shrink during exhalation.<ref name=tortora1 /> This causes them to have a greater surface tension-lowering effect when the alveoli are small than when they are large (as at the end of inhalation, when the surfactant molecules are more widely spaced). The tendency for the alveoli to collapse is therefore almost the same at the end of exhalation as at the end of inhalation. Thirdly, the surface tension of the curved watery layer lining the alveoli tends to draw water from the lung tissues into the alveoli. Surfactant reduces this danger to negligible levels, and keeps the alveoli dry.<ref name=tortora1 /><ref>{{cite book|author=West, John B.|title=Respiratory physiology-- the essentials|publisher=Williams & Wilkins|location=Baltimore|year=1994|pages=[https://archive.org/details/respiratoryphysi00west/page/21 21\u201330, 84\u201384, 98\u2013101]|isbn=0-683-08937-4|url=https://archive.org/details/respiratoryphysi00west/page/21}}</ref>\n\n[[Premature birth|Pre-term babies]] who are unable to manufacture surfactant have lungs that tend to collapse each time they breathe out.

Some [[prostaglandin]]s are removed from the circulation, while others are synthesized in the lungs and released into the blood when lung tissue is stretched.\n\nThe lungs activate one hormone. The physiologically inactive decapeptide [[angiotensin I]] is converted to the [[aldosterone]]-releasing octapeptide, [[angiotensin II]], in the pulmonary circulation. The reaction occurs in other tissues as well, but it is particularly prominent in the lungs. Angiotensin II also has a direct effect on [[Arteriole|arteriolar walls]], causing arteriolar [[vasoconstriction]], and consequently a rise in [[arterial blood pressure]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Cellular Mechanism of Vasoconstriction Induced by Angiotensin II It Remains To Be Determined|journal = Circulation Research|date = 2003-11-28|issn = 0009-7330|pmid = 14645130|pages = 1015\u20131017|volume = 93|issue = 11|doi = 10.1161/01.RES.0000105920.33926.60|language = en|first = Hideo|last = Kanaide|first2 = Toshihiro|last2 = Ichiki|first3 = Junji|last3 = Nishimura|first4 = Katsuya|last4 = Hirano}}</ref> Large amounts of the [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]] responsible for this activation are located on the surfaces of the [[endothelial cells]] of the alveolar capillaries.

Vocalization, or singing, in birds occurs via the [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|syrinx]], an organ located at the base of the trachea. The vibration of air flowing across the larynx ([[vocal cords]]), in humans, and the syrinx, in birds, results in sound. Because of this, gas movement is vital for [[communication]] purposes.\n\n====Temperature control====\n[[Thermoregulation|Panting]] in dogs, cats, birds and some other animals provides a means of reducing body temperature, by evaporating saliva in the mouth (instead of evaporating sweat on the skin).\n\n===Clinical significance===\n[[Respiratory disease|Disorders of the respiratory system]] can be classified into several general groups:\n* Airway obstructive conditions  (e.g., [[emphysema]], [[bronchitis]], [[Allergic asthma|asthma]])\n* Pulmonary restrictive conditions  (e.g., [[fibrosis]], [[sarcoidosis]], alveolar damage, [[pleural effusion]])\n* Vascular diseases  (e.g., [[pulmonary edema]], [[pulmonary embolism]], [[pulmonary hypertension]])\n* Infectious, environmental and other \"diseases\" (e.g., [[pneumonia]], [[tuberculosis]], [[asbestosis]], [[air pollution#Pollutants|particulate pollutants]])\n* Primary cancers (e.g. [[Lung cancer|bronchial carcinoma]], [[mesothelioma]])\n* Secondary cancers (e.g. cancers that originated elsewhere in the body, but have seeded themselves in the lungs)\n* Insufficient surfactant (e.g. [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome|respiratory distress syndrome]] in pre-term babies) .\n\nDisorders of the respiratory system are usually treated by a [[pulmonology|pulmonologist]] and [[Respiratory therapy|respiratory therapist]].\n\nWhere there is an inability to breathe or an insufficiency in breathing a [[medical ventilator]] may be used.\n\n==Exceptional mammals==\n\n===Horses===\n{{Main|Respiratory system of the horse}}\nHorses are [[obligate nasal breathing|obligate nasal breathers]] which means that they are different from many other mammals because they do not have the option of breathing through their mouths and must take in air through their noses.\n\n===Elephants===\nThe [[elephant]] is the only mammal known to have no [[pleural space]].

Some of the smallest [[spider]]s and [[mite]]s can breathe simply by exchanging gas through the surface of the body. Larger spiders, [[scorpion]]s and other [[arthropods]] use a primitive [[book lung]].\n\n====Insects====\n{{Main|Respiratory system of insects}}\nMost insects breath passively through their [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s (special openings in the [[exoskeleton]]) and the air reaches every part of the body by means of a series of smaller and smaller tubes called 'trachaea' when their diameters are relatively large, and '[[tracheole]]s' when their diameters are very small. The tracheoles make contact with individual cells throughout the body.<ref name=campbell /> They are partially filled with fluid, which can be withdrawn from the individual tracheoles when the tissues, such as muscles,  are active and have a high demand for oxygen, bringing the air closer to the active cells.<ref name=campbell /> This is probably brought about by the buildup of lactic acid in the active muscles causing an osmotic gradient, moving the water out of the tracheoles and into the active cells.  Diffusion of gases is effective over small distances but not over larger ones, this is one of the reasons insects are all relatively small. Insects which do not have spiracles and trachaea, such as some Collembola, breathe directly through their skins, also by diffusion of gases.<ref>[http://www.earthlife.net/insects/anatomy.html The Earth Life Web, Insect Morphology and Anatomy]. Earthlife.net. Retrieved on 2013-04-21.</ref>\n\nThe number of spiracles an insect has is variable between species, however, they always come in pairs, one on each side of the body, and usually one pair per segment. Some of the Diplura have eleven, with four pairs on the thorax, but in most of the ancient forms of insects, such as Dragonflies and Grasshoppers there are two thoracic and eight abdominal spiracles. However, in most of the remaining insects, there are fewer. It is at the level of the tracheoles that oxygen is delivered to the cells for respiration.\n\nInsects were once believed to exchange gases with the environment continuously by the [[simple diffusion]] of gases into the tracheal system. More recently, however, large variation in insect ventilatory patterns has been documented and insect respiration appears to be highly variable. Some small insects do not demonstrate continuous respiratory movements and may lack muscular control of the spiracles. Others, however, utilize [[muscle contraction|muscular contraction]] of the [[abdomen]] along with coordinated spiracle contraction and relaxation to generate cyclical gas exchange patterns and to reduce water loss into the atmosphere. The most extreme form of these patterns is termed [[discontinuous gas exchange]] cycles.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Lighton\n | first = JRB\n | title = Discontinuous gas exchange in insects\n | journal = Annu Rev Entomol\n | volume = 41\n | pages = 309\u2013324\n | date = January 1996\n | doi = 10.1146/annurev.en.41.010196.001521 | pmid = 8546448\n }}</ref>\n\n===Molluscs===\n{{Main |Respiratory system of gastropods}}\n[[Molluscs]] generally possess gills that allow gas exchange between the aqueous environment and their circulatory systems. These animals also possess a heart that pumps blood containing [[hemocyanin]] as its oxygen-capturing molecule.<ref name=campbell /> Hence, this respiratory system is similar to that of vertebrate fish. The [[respiratory system of gastropods]] can include either gills or a lung.\n\n==Plants==\n{{Main|Photosynthesis}}\n[[Plant]]s use [[carbon dioxide]] gas in the process of [[photosynthesis]], and exhale [[oxygen]] gas as waste. The chemical equation of photosynthesis is 6 CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) and 6 H<sub>2</sub>O (water), which in the presence of sunlight makes C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (glucose) and 6 O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen). Photosynthesis uses electrons on the carbon atoms as the repository for the energy obtained from sunlight.<ref name=stryer>{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=In: Biochemistry. |chapter= Photosynthesis |edition= Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H.

In so doing the carbon atoms and their electrons are combined with oxygen forming CO<sub>2</sub> which is easily removed from both the cells and the organism. Plants use both processes, photosynthesis to capture the energy and [[Aerobic cellular respiration|oxidative metabolism]] to use it.\n\nPlant respiration is limited by the process of [[diffusion]]. Plants take in carbon dioxide through holes, known as [[stoma]]ta, that can open and close on the undersides of their [[leaf|leaves]] and sometimes other parts of their anatomy. Most plants require some oxygen for [[catabolic]] processes (break-down reactions that release energy). But the quantity of O<sub>2</sub> used per hour is small as they are not involved in activities that require high rates of [[Aerobic cellular respiration|aerobic]] metabolism. Their requirement for air, however, is very high as they need CO<sub>2</sub> for photosynthesis, which constitutes only 0.04% of the environmental air. Thus, to make 1&nbsp;g of glucose requires the removal of all the CO<sub>2</sub> from ''at least'' 18.7&nbsp;liters of air at sea level. But inefficiencies in the photosynthetic process cause considerably greater volumes of air to be used.<ref name=stryer /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Neil A.|title= Biology|edition= Second|publisher= Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc|location= Redwood City, California|date= 1990|pages=206\u2013223|isbn=0-8053-1800-3}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Great Oxygenation Event]]\n* [[Respiratory adaptation]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikibooks|Human Physiology|The respiratory system}}\n{{Wikibooks|Anatomy and Physiology of Animals|Respiratory System}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080913133403/http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/farabee/BIOBK/BioBookRESPSYS.html#Diseases%20of%20the%20Respiratory%20Sys A high school level description of the respiratory system]\n*[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/chb/lectures/anatomy7.html Introduction to Respiratory System]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090326024545/http://www.scienceaid.co.uk/biology/humans/lungs.html Science aid: Respiratory System] A simple guide for high school students\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070807215651/http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/bemis/FAOV4/Ch18.doc The Respiratory System] University level (Microsoft Word document)\n*[http://meded.ucsd.edu/ifp/jwest/resp_phys/index.html Lectures in respiratory physiology] by noted respiratory physiologist [[John B.

These enter the lungs where they branch into progressively narrower secondary and tertiary bronchi that branch into numerous smaller tubes, the [[bronchiole]]s. In [[bird]]s the bronchioles are termed [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|parabronchi]]. It is the bronchioles, or parabronchi that generally open into the microscopic [[pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] in mammals and [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|atria]] in birds. Air has to be pumped from the environment into the alveoli or atria by the process of [[breathing]] which involves the [[muscles of respiration]].\n\nIn most [[fish]], and a number of other [[aquatic animal]]s (both [[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s) the respiratory system consists of [[gill]]s, which are either partially or completely external organs, bathed in the watery environment. This water flows over the gills by a variety of active or passive means. Gas exchange takes place in the gills which consist of thin or very flat [[Gill#Vertebrate gills|filaments]] and [[Gill#Vertebrate gills|lammelae]] which expose a very large surface area of highly [[blood vessel|vascularized]] tissue to the water.\n\nOther animals, such as [[insects]], have respiratory systems with very simple anatomical features, and in [[amphibians]] even the [[skin]] plays a vital role in gas exchange. [[Plants]] also have respiratory systems but the directionality of gas exchange can be opposite to that in animals.

The color code is the same as on the left. In addition to a more forceful and extensive contraction of the diaphragm, the intercostal muscles are aided by the accessory muscles of inhalation to exaggerate the movement of the ribs upwards, causing a greater expansion of the rib cage. During exhalation, apart from the relaxation of the muscles of inhalation, the abdominal muscles actively contract to pull the lower edges of the rib cage downwards decreasing the volume of the rib cage, while at the same time pushing the diaphragm upwards deep into the thorax.\n| width1 = 200\n| image1 = Quiet breathing.jpg\n| caption1 = '''Fig. 7''' The muscles of breathing at rest: inhalation on the left, exhalation on the right. Contracting muscles are shown in red; relaxed muscles in blue. Contraction of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] generally contributes the most to the expansion of the chest cavity (light blue). However, at the same time, the intercostal muscles pull the ribs upwards (their effect is indicated by arrows) also causing the [[rib cage]] to expand during inhalation (see diagram on other side of the page). The relaxation of all these muscles during exhalation cause the rib cage and abdomen (light green) to elastically return to their resting positions. Compare with Fig. 6, the MRI video of the chest movements during the breathing cycle.\n}}\nIn [[mammals]], inhalation at rest is primarily due to the contraction of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]. This is an upwardly domed sheet of muscle that separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity. When it contracts the sheet flattens, (i.e. moves downwards as shown in Fig.&nbsp;7) increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity. The contracting diaphragm  pushes the abdominal organs downwards. But because the pelvic floor prevents the lowermost abdominal organs moving in that direction, the pliable abdominal contents cause the belly to bulge outwards to the front and sides, because the relaxed abdominal muscles do not resist this movement (Fig.&nbsp;7). This entirely passive bulging (and shrinking during exhalation) of the abdomen during normal breathing is sometimes referred to as \"abdominal breathing\", although it is, in fact, \"diaphragmatic breathing\", which is not visible on the outside of the body. Mammals only use their abdominal muscles only during forceful exhalation (see Fig.&nbsp;8, and discussion below). Never during any form of inhalation.\n\nAs the diaphragm contracts, the [[rib cage]] is simultaneously enlarged by the ribs being pulled upwards by the [[intercostal muscles]] as shown in Fig.&nbsp;4. All the ribs slant downwards from the rear to the front (as shown in Fig.&nbsp;4); but the lowermost ribs ''also'' slant downwards from the midline outwards (Fig.&nbsp;5). Thus the rib cage's transverse diameter can be increased in the same way as the antero-posterior diameter is increase by the so-called [[pump handle movement]] shown in Fig.&nbsp;4.\n\nThe enlargement of the thoracic cavity's vertical dimension by the contraction of the diaphragm, and its two horizontal dimensions by the lifting of the front and sides of the ribs, causes the intrathoracic pressure to fall. The lungs' interiors are open to the outside air, and being elastic, therefore expand to fill the increased space. The inflow of air into the lungs occurs via the [[respiratory airways]] (Fig. 2). In health these airways (starting at the nose or mouth, and ending in the microscopic dead-end sacs called [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]]) are always open, though the diameters of the various sections can be changed by the [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and [[parasympathetic nervous system]]s. The alveolar air pressure is therefore always close to atmospheric air pressure (about 100&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]] at sea level) at rest, with the pressure gradients that cause air to move in and out of the lungs during breathing rarely exceeding 2\u20133&nbsp;kPa.<ref name=\"Chrisvan L 1995\">{{cite journal |last1=Koen |first1=Chrisvan L. |last2=Koeslag |first2=Johan H. | title=On the stability of subatmospheric intrapleural and intracranial pressures |journal= News in Physiological Sciences | date=1995 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=176\u2013178 |doi=10.1152/physiologyonline.1995.10.4.176}}</ref><ref name=\"Williams & Wilkins\">{{cite book |last1=West |first1=J.B. |title=Respiratory physiology: the essentials. |location=Baltimore |publisher=Williams & Wilkins |date=1985| pages= 21\u201330, 84\u201384, 98\u2013101 }}</ref>\n\nDuring exhalation the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax.

This contrasts with composition of the dry outside air at sea level, where the partial pressure of oxygen is 21&nbsp;kPa (or 160&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg) and that of carbon dioxide 0.04&nbsp;kPa (or 0.3&nbsp;mmHg).<ref name=tortora1 />\n\nDuring heavy breathing ([[hyperpnea]]), as, for instance, during exercise, inhalation is brought about by a more powerful and greater excursion of the contracting diaphragm than at rest (Fig. 8). In addition the \"[[accessory muscles of respiration|accessory muscles of inhalation]]\" exaggerate the actions of the intercostal muscles (Fig. 8). These accessory muscles of inhalation are muscles that extend from the [[cervical vertebrae]] and base of the skull to the upper ribs and [[sternum]], sometimes through an intermediary attachment to the [[clavicle]]s.<ref name=tortora1 /> When they contract the rib cage's internal volume is increased to a far greater extent than can be achieved by contraction of the intercostal muscles alone. Seen from outside the body the lifting of the clavicles during strenuous or labored inhalation is sometimes called [[clavicular breathing]], seen especially during [[asthma]] attacks and in people with [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].\n\nDuring heavy breathing, exhalation is caused by relaxation of all the muscles of inhalation. But now, the abdominal muscles, instead of remaining relaxed (as they do at rest), contract forcibly pulling the lower edges of the [[Rib cage#Function|rib cage]] downwards (front and sides) (Fig.&nbsp;8). This not only drastically decreases the size of the rib cage, but also pushes the abdominal organs upwards against the diaphragm which consequently bulges deeply into the thorax (Fig.&nbsp;8). The end-exhalatory lung volume is now well below the resting mid-position and contains far less air than the resting \"functional residual capacity\". However, in a normal mammal, the lungs cannot be emptied completely. In an adult human there is always still at least 1 liter of residual air left in the lungs after maximum exhalation.<ref name=tortora1 />\n\nThe automatic rhythmical breathing in and out, can be interrupted by coughing, sneezing (forms of very forceful exhalation), by the expression of a wide range of emotions (laughing, sighing, crying out in pain, exasperated intakes of breath) and by such voluntary acts as speech, singing, whistling and the playing of wind instruments. All of these actions rely on the muscles described above, and their effects on the movement of air in and out of the lungs.\n\nAlthough not a form of breathing, the [[Valsalva maneuver]] involves the respiratory muscles. It is, in fact, a very forceful exhalatory effort against a tightly closed [[glottis]], so that no air can escape from the lungs.<ref name=\"taylor\">{{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=D |title=The Valsalva Manoeuvre: A critical review |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=26 |issue=1 |year=1996 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6264 |accessdate=14 March 2016}}</ref> Instead abdominal contents are evacuated in the opposite direction, through orifices in the pelvic floor.  The abdominal muscles contract very powerfully, causing the pressure inside the abdomen and thorax to rise to extremely high levels. The Valsalva maneuver can be carried out voluntarily, but is more generally a reflex elicited when attempting to empty the abdomen during, for instance, difficult defecation, or during childbirth. Breathing ceases during this maneuver.\n\n===Gas exchange===\n{{Main|Gas exchange}}\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| align = right\n| header = Mechanism of gas exchange \n| width1 = 250\n| image1 = Gas exchange.jpg\n| caption1 = '''Fig. 11''' A highly diagrammatic illustration of the process of gas exchange in the mammalian lungs, emphasizing the differences between the gas compositions of the ambient air, the alveolar air (light blue) with which the pulmonary capillary blood equilibrates, and the blood gas tensions in the pulmonary arterial (blue blood entering the lung on the left) and venous blood (red blood leaving the lung on the right).

It is folded into about 300 million small air sacs called [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]]<ref name=grays /> (each between 75 and 300&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter) branching off from the respiratory [[bronchiole]]s in the [[lung]]s, thus providing an extremely large surface area (approximately 145&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) for gas exchange to occur.<ref name=grays />\n\nThe air contained within the alveoli has a semi-permanent volume of about 2.5-3.0&nbsp;liters which completely surrounds the alveolar capillary blood (Fig.&nbsp;12). This ensures that equilibration of the partial pressures of the gases in the two compartments is very efficient and occurs very quickly. The blood leaving the alveolar capillaries and is eventually distributed throughout the body therefore has a [[partial pressure]] of oxygen of 13-14&nbsp;kPa (100&nbsp;mmHg), and a [[PCO2|partial pressure of carbon dioxide]] of 5.3&nbsp;kPa (40&nbsp;mmHg) (i.e. the same as the oxygen and carbon dioxide gas tensions as in the alveoli).<ref name=tortora1 /> As mentioned in [[Respiratory system#Mechanics of breathing|the section above]], the corresponding partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the ambient (dry) air at sea level are 21&nbsp;kPa (160&nbsp;mmHg) and 0.04&nbsp;kPa (0.3&nbsp;mmHg) respectively.<ref name=tortora1 />\n\nThis marked difference between the composition of the alveolar air and that of the ambient air can be maintained because the [[functional residual capacity]] is contained in dead-end sacs connected to the outside air by fairly narrow and relatively long tubes (the airways: [[nose]], [[pharynx]], [[larynx]], [[trachea]], [[bronchi]] and their branches down to the [[bronchioles]]), through which the air has to be breathed both in and out (i.e. there is no unidirectional through-flow as there is in the [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|bird lung]]). This typical mammalian anatomy combined with the fact that the lungs are not emptied and re-inflated with each breath (leaving a substantial volume of air, of about 2.5-3.0&nbsp;liters, in the alveoli after exhalation), ensures that the composition of the alveolar air is only minimally disturbed when the 350&nbsp;ml of fresh air is mixed into it with each inhalation. Thus the animal is provided with a very special \"portable atmosphere\", whose composition differs significantly from the [[Great Oxygenation Event|present-day ambient air]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lovelock |first1=James | title=Healing Gaia: Practical medicine for the Planet|url=https://archive.org/details/healinggaiaprac00love |url-access=registration |pages=21\u201334, 73\u201388|location=New York |publisher=Harmony Books |date=1991|isbn= 0-517-57848-4}}</ref> It is this portable atmosphere (the [[functional residual capacity]]) to which the blood and therefore the body tissues are exposed \u2013 not to the outside air.\n\nThe resulting arterial partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide are [[Homeostasis#Blood partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide|homeostatically controlled]]. A rise in the arterial partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> and, to a lesser extent, a fall in the arterial partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub>, will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing till the [[blood gas tension]]s in the lungs, and therefore the arterial blood, return to normal. The converse happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a lesser extent, the oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced till blood gas normality is restored.\n\nSince the blood arriving in the alveolar capillaries has a partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> of, on average, 6&nbsp;kPa (45&nbsp;mmHg), while the pressure in the alveolar air is 13-14&nbsp;kPa (100&nbsp;mmHg), there will be a net diffusion of oxygen into the capillary blood, changing the composition of the 3&nbsp;liters of alveolar air slightly. Similarly, since the blood arriving in the alveolar capillaries has a partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> of also about 6&nbsp;kPa (45&nbsp;mmHg), whereas that of the alveolar air is 5.3&nbsp;kPa (40&nbsp;mmHg), there is a net movement of carbon dioxide out of the capillaries into the alveoli. The changes brought about by these net flows of individual gases into and out of the alveolar air necessitate the replacement of about 15% of the alveolar air with ambient air every  5&nbsp;seconds or so. This is very tightly controlled by the monitoring of the arterial blood gases (which accurately reflect composition of the alveolar air) by the [[Aortic body|aortic]] and [[Carotid body|carotid bodies]], as well as by the [[Central chemoreceptors|blood gas and pH sensor]] on the anterior surface of the [[medulla oblongata]] in the brain. There are also oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors in the lungs, but they primarily determine the diameters of the [[bronchioles]] and [[Pulmonary circulation|pulmonary capillaries]], and are therefore responsible for directing the flow of air and blood to different parts of the lungs.\n\nIt is only as a result of accurately maintaining the composition of the 3&nbsp;liters of alveolar air that with each breath some carbon dioxide is discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up from the outside air. If more carbon dioxide than usual has been lost by a short period of [[hyperventilation]], respiration will be slowed down or halted until the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide has returned to 5.3&nbsp;kPa (40&nbsp;mmHg). It is therefore strictly speaking untrue that the primary function of the respiratory system is to rid the body of carbon dioxide \u201cwaste\u201d. The carbon dioxide that is breathed out with each breath could probably be more correctly be seen as a byproduct of the body's extracellular fluid [[Homeostasis#Blood partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide]] and  [[Homeostasis#Extracellular fluid pH|pH homeostats]]\n \nIf these homeostats are compromised, then a [[respiratory acidosis]], or a [[respiratory alkalosis]] will occur. In the long run these can be compensated by renal adjustments to the [[Acid-base homeostasis|H<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> concentrations in the plasma]]; but since this takes time, the [[hyperventilation syndrome]] can, for instance, occur when agitation or anxiety cause a person to breathe fast and deeply thus causing a distressing [[respiratory alkalosis]] through the blowing off of too much CO<sub>2</sub> from the blood into the outside air.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shu|first=BC |author2=Chang, YY |author3=Lee, FY |author4=Tzeng, DS |author5=Lin, HY |author6=Lung, FW|title=Parental attachment, premorbid personality, and mental health in young males with hyperventilation syndrome.|journal=Psychiatry Research|date=2007-10-31|volume=153|issue=2|pages=163\u201370|pmid=17659783|doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2006.05.006}}</ref>\n\nOxygen has a very low solubility in water, and is therefore carried in the blood loosely combined with [[hemoglobin]].

When all the heme groups carry one O<sub>2</sub> molecule each the blood is said to be \u201csaturated\u201d with oxygen, and no further increase in the partial pressure of oxygen will meaningfully increase the oxygen concentration of the blood.

With expansion of the lungs (through lowering of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] and expansion of the [[thoracic cage]]) the alveolar air now occupies a larger volume, and its [[Boyle's law|pressure falls proportionally]], causing air to flow in from the surroundings, through the airways, till the pressure in the alveoli is once again at the ambient air pressure. The reverse obviously happens during exhalation. This ''process'' (of inhalation and exhalation) is exactly the same at sea level, as on top of [[Mount Everest|Mt.

During inhalation the air is warmed and saturated with water vapor during its passage through the [[nasal cavity|nose passages]] and [[pharynx]]. [[Vapour pressure of water|Saturated water vapor pressure]] is dependent only on temperature. At a body core temperature of 37&nbsp;\u00b0C  it is 6.3&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]] (47.0&nbsp;mmHg), irrespective of any other influences, including altitude.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Diem |first1=K. |last2=Lenter| first2= C.|title=Scientific Tables| location=Basle, Switzerland|publisher=Ciba-Geigy |date=1970|edition= Seventh| pages= 257\u2013258 }}</ref> Thus at sea level, where the ambient atmospheric pressure is about 100&nbsp;kPa, the moistened air that flows into the lungs from the [[trachea]] consists of water vapor (6.3&nbsp;kPa), nitrogen (74.0&nbsp;kPa), oxygen (19.7&nbsp;kPa) and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases (a total of 100&nbsp;kPa). In dry air the [[partial pressure]] of O<sub>2</sub> at sea level is 21.0&nbsp;kPa (i.e. 21% of 100&nbsp;kPa), compared to the 19.7&nbsp;kPa of oxygen entering the alveolar air. (The tracheal partial pressure of oxygen is 21% of [100&nbsp;kPa \u2013 6.3&nbsp;kPa] = 19.7&nbsp;kPa).  At the summit of [[Mount Everest|Mt. Everest]] (at an altitude of 8,848&nbsp;m or 29,029&nbsp;ft) the total [[Mount Everest#Death zone|atmospheric pressure is 33.7&nbsp;kPa]], of which 7.1&nbsp;kPa (or 21%) is oxygen.<ref name=altitude /> The air entering the lungs also has a total pressure of 33.7&nbsp;kPa, of which 6.3&nbsp;kPa is, unavoidably, water vapor (as it is at sea level). This reduces the partial pressure of oxygen entering the alveoli to 5.8&nbsp;kPa (or 21% of [33.7&nbsp;kPa \u2013 6.3&nbsp;kPa] = 5.8&nbsp;kPa). The reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen in the inhaled air is therefore substantially greater than the reduction of the total atmospheric pressure at altitude would suggest (on Mt Everest: 5.8&nbsp;kPa ''vs.'' 7.1&nbsp;kPa).\n\nA further minor complication exists at altitude. If the volume of the lungs were to be instantaneously doubled at the beginning of inhalation, the air pressure inside the lungs would be halved. This happens regardless of altitude. Thus, halving of the sea level air pressure (100&nbsp;kPa) results in an intrapulmonary air pressure of 50&nbsp;kPa. Doing the same at 5500&nbsp;m, where the atmospheric pressure is only 50&nbsp;kPa,  the intrapulmonary air pressure falls to 25&nbsp;kPa. Therefore, the same change in lung volume at sea level results in a 50&nbsp;kPa difference in pressure between the ambient air and the intrapulmonary air, whereas it result in a difference of only 25&nbsp;kPa at 5500&nbsp;m. The driving pressure forcing air into the lungs during inhalation is therefore halved at this altitude. The ''rate'' of inflow of air into the lungs during inhalation at sea level is therefore twice that which occurs at 5500&nbsp;m. However, in reality, inhalation and exhalation occur far more gently and less abruptly than in the example given. The differences between the atmospheric and intrapulmonary pressures, driving air in and out of the lungs during the breathing cycle, are in the region of only 2\u20133&nbsp;kPa.<ref name=\"Chrisvan L 1995\"/><ref name=\"Williams & Wilkins\"/> A doubling or more of these small pressure differences could be achieved only by very major changes in the breathing effort at high altitudes.\n\nAll of the above influences of low atmospheric pressures on breathing are accommodated primarily by breathing deeper and faster ([[hyperpnea]]).  The exact degree of hyperpnea is determined by the [[Homeostasis#Blood partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide|blood gas homeostat]], which regulates the [[partial pressure]]s of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. This [[Homeostasis|homeostat]] prioritizes the regulation of the arterial [[partial pressure]] of carbon dioxide over that of oxygen at sea level.<ref name=tortora1 /> That is to say, at sea level the arterial partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> is maintained at very close to 5.3&nbsp;kPa (or 40&nbsp;mmHg) under a wide range of circumstances, at the expense of the arterial partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub>, which is allowed to vary within a very wide range of values, before eliciting a corrective ventilatory response.  However, when the atmospheric pressure (and therefore the partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> in the ambient air) falls to below 50-75% of its value at sea level, oxygen [[homeostasis]] is given priority over carbon dioxide homeostasis.<ref name=tortora1 /> This switch-over occurs at an elevation of about 2500&nbsp;m (or about 8000&nbsp;ft). If this switch occurs relatively abruptly, the hyperpnea at high altitude will cause a severe fall in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, with a [[Homeostasis#Extracellular fluid pH|consequent rise in the pH of the arterial plasma]]. This is one contributor to [[Altitude sickness|high altitude sickness]]. On the other hand, if the switch to oxygen homeostasis is incomplete, then [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] may complicate the clinical picture with potentially fatal results.\n\nThere are oxygen sensors in the smaller [[Bronchus|bronchi]] and [[bronchiole]]s. In response to low partial pressures of oxygen in the inhaled air these sensors reflexively cause the pulmonary arterioles to constrict.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Von Euler |first1=U.S. |last2= Liljestrand |first2=G. | title= Observations on the pulmonary arterial blood pressure in the cat |journal= Acta Physiologica Scandinavica | date=1946 |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=301\u2013320 |doi=10.1111/j.1748-1716.1946.tb00389.x}}</ref> (This is the exact opposite of the corresponding reflex in the tissues, where low arterial partial pressures of O<sub>2</sub> cause arteriolar vasodilation.) At altitude this causes the [[Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction|pulmonary arterial pressure to rise]] resulting in a much more even distribution of blood flow to the lungs than occurs at sea level. At sea level the pulmonary arterial pressure is very low, with the result that [[Ventilation/perfusion ratio#Physiology|the tops of the lungs receive far less blood than the bases]], which are relatively over-perfused with blood. It is only in the middle of the lungs that the [[Ventilation/perfusion ratio#Physiology|blood and air flow to the alveoli are ideally matched]]. At altitude this variation in the [[ventilation/perfusion ratio]] of alveoli from the tops of the lungs to the bottoms is eliminated, with all the alveoli perfused and ventilated in more or less the physiologically ideal manner. This is a further important contributor to the [[Effects of high altitude on humans#Acclimatization to altitude|acclimatatization to high altitudes]] and low oxygen pressures.\n\nThe kidneys measure the oxygen ''content'' (mmol&nbsp;O<sub>2</sub>/liter blood, rather than the partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub>) of the arterial blood.

These responses cause air to be expelled forcefully from the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] or [[nose]], respectively. In this manner, irritants caught in the [[mucus]] which lines the respiratory tract are expelled or moved to the [[mouth]] where they can be [[swallowed]].<ref name=tortora1 /> During coughing, contraction of the smooth muscle in the airway walls narrows the trachea by pulling the ends of the cartilage plates together and by pushing soft tissue into the lumen. This increases the expired airflow rate to dislodge and remove any irritant particle or mucus.\n\n[[Respiratory epithelium]] can secrete a variety of molecules that aid in the defense of the lungs. These include secretory [[immunoglobulin]]s (IgA), [[collectin]]s, [[defensin]]s and other peptides and [[proteases]], [[reactive oxygen species]], and [[reactive nitrogen species]]. These secretions can act directly as antimicrobials to help keep the airway free of infection. A variety of [[chemokine]]s and [[cytokine]]s are also secreted that recruit the traditional immune cells and others to the site of infections.\n\n[[Pulmonary surfactant|Surfactant]] immune function is primarily attributed to two proteins: SP-A and SP-D. These proteins can bind to sugars on the surface of pathogens and thereby [[opsonize]] them for uptake by phagocytes. It also regulates inflammatory responses and interacts with the adaptive immune response. Surfactant degradation or inactivation may contribute to enhanced susceptibility to lung inflammation and infection.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000078172 |pmid=15211087 |title=Host Defense Functions of Pulmonary Surfactant |journal=Biology of the Neonate |volume=85 |issue=4 |pages=326\u201332 |year=2004 |last1=Wright |first1=Jo Rae }}</ref>\n\nMost of the respiratory system is lined with mucous membranes that contain [[mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue]], which produces [[white blood cell]]s such as [[lymphocyte]]s.\n\n====Prevention of alveolar collapse====\n{{Main|Pulmonary surfactant}}\nThe lungs make a [[pulmonary surfactant|surfactant]], a surface-active [[lipoprotein]] complex (phospholipoprotein) formed by [[Type II pneumocyte|type II alveolar cells]]. It floats on the surface of the thin watery layer which lines the insides of the alveoli, reducing the water's surface tension.\n\nThe surface tension of a watery surface (the water-air interface) tends to make that surface shrink.<ref name=tortora1 /> When that surface is curved as it is in the alveoli of the lungs, the shrinkage of the surface decreases the diameter of the alveoli. The more acute the curvature of the water-air interface [[Pulmonary surfactant#Function|the greater the tendency for the alveolus to collapse]].<ref name=tortora1 /> This has three effects. Firstly the surface tension inside the alveoli resists expansion of the alveoli during inhalation (i.e. it makes the lung stiff, or non-compliant). Surfactant reduces the surface tension and therefore makes the lungs more [[Pulmonary compliance|compliant]], or less stiff, than if it were not there. Secondly, the diameters of the alveoli increase and decrease during the breathing cycle. This means that the alveoli have a [[Pulmonary surfactant#Compliance|greater tendency to collapse]] (i.e. cause [[atelectasis]]) at the end of exhalation that at the end of inhalation. Since surfactant floats on the watery surface, its molecules are more tightly packed together when the alveoli shrink during exhalation.<ref name=tortora1 /> This causes them to have a greater surface tension-lowering effect when the alveoli are small than when they are large (as at the end of inhalation, when the surfactant molecules are more widely spaced). The tendency for the alveoli to collapse is therefore almost the same at the end of exhalation as at the end of inhalation. Thirdly, the surface tension of the curved watery layer lining the alveoli tends to draw water from the lung tissues into the alveoli. Surfactant reduces this danger to negligible levels, and keeps the alveoli dry.<ref name=tortora1 /><ref>{{cite book|author=West, John B.|title=Respiratory physiology-- the essentials|publisher=Williams & Wilkins|location=Baltimore|year=1994|pages=[https://archive.org/details/respiratoryphysi00west/page/21 21\u201330, 84\u201384, 98\u2013101]|isbn=0-683-08937-4|url=https://archive.org/details/respiratoryphysi00west/page/21}}</ref>\n\n[[Premature birth|Pre-term babies]] who are unable to manufacture surfactant have lungs that tend to collapse each time they breathe out.

They also release a variety of substances that enter the systemic arterial blood, and they remove other substances from the systemic venous blood that reach them via the pulmonary artery. Some [[prostaglandin]]s are removed from the circulation, while others are synthesized in the lungs and released into the blood when lung tissue is stretched.\n\nThe lungs activate one hormone. The physiologically inactive decapeptide [[angiotensin I]] is converted to the [[aldosterone]]-releasing octapeptide, [[angiotensin II]], in the pulmonary circulation. The reaction occurs in other tissues as well, but it is particularly prominent in the lungs. Angiotensin II also has a direct effect on [[Arteriole|arteriolar walls]], causing arteriolar [[vasoconstriction]], and consequently a rise in [[arterial blood pressure]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Cellular Mechanism of Vasoconstriction Induced by Angiotensin II It Remains To Be Determined|journal = Circulation Research|date = 2003-11-28|issn = 0009-7330|pmid = 14645130|pages = 1015\u20131017|volume = 93|issue = 11|doi = 10.1161/01.RES.0000105920.33926.60|language = en|first = Hideo|last = Kanaide|first2 = Toshihiro|last2 = Ichiki|first3 = Junji|last3 = Nishimura|first4 = Katsuya|last4 = Hirano}}</ref> Large amounts of the [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]] responsible for this activation are located on the surfaces of the [[endothelial cells]] of the alveolar capillaries. The converting enzyme also inactivates [[bradykinin]]. Circulation time through the alveolar capillaries is less than one second, yet 70% of the angiotensin I reaching the lungs is converted to angiotensin II in a single trip through the capillaries. Four other peptidases have been identified on the surface of the pulmonary endothelial cells.\n\n====Vocalization====\nThe movement of gas through the [[larynx]], [[pharynx]] and [[mouth]] allows humans to [[speech|speak]], or ''[[phonation|phonate]]''. Vocalization, or singing, in birds occurs via the [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|syrinx]], an organ located at the base of the trachea. The vibration of air flowing across the larynx ([[vocal cords]]), in humans, and the syrinx, in birds, results in sound. Because of this, gas movement is vital for [[communication]] purposes.\n\n====Temperature control====\n[[Thermoregulation|Panting]] in dogs, cats, birds and some other animals provides a means of reducing body temperature, by evaporating saliva in the mouth (instead of evaporating sweat on the skin).\n\n===Clinical significance===\n[[Respiratory disease|Disorders of the respiratory system]] can be classified into several general groups:\n* Airway obstructive conditions  (e.g., [[emphysema]], [[bronchitis]], [[Allergic asthma|asthma]])\n* Pulmonary restrictive conditions  (e.g., [[fibrosis]], [[sarcoidosis]], alveolar damage, [[pleural effusion]])\n* Vascular diseases  (e.g., [[pulmonary edema]], [[pulmonary embolism]], [[pulmonary hypertension]])\n* Infectious, environmental and other \"diseases\" (e.g., [[pneumonia]], [[tuberculosis]], [[asbestosis]], [[air pollution#Pollutants|particulate pollutants]])\n* Primary cancers (e.g. [[Lung cancer|bronchial carcinoma]], [[mesothelioma]])\n* Secondary cancers (e.g. cancers that originated elsewhere in the body, but have seeded themselves in the lungs)\n* Insufficient surfactant (e.g. [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome|respiratory distress syndrome]] in pre-term babies) .\n\nDisorders of the respiratory system are usually treated by a [[pulmonology|pulmonologist]] and [[Respiratory therapy|respiratory therapist]].\n\nWhere there is an inability to breathe or an insufficiency in breathing a [[medical ventilator]] may be used.\n\n==Exceptional mammals==\n\n===Horses===\n{{Main|Respiratory system of the horse}}\nHorses are [[obligate nasal breathing|obligate nasal breathers]] which means that they are different from many other mammals because they do not have the option of breathing through their mouths and must take in air through their noses.\n\n===Elephants===\nThe [[elephant]] is the only mammal known to have no [[pleural space]].

The primary bronchi enter the lungs to become the intrapulmonary bronchi, which give off a set of parallel branches called ventrobronchi and, a little further on, an equivalent set of dorsobronchi (Fig.&nbsp;16).<ref name=AvResp /> The ends of the intrapulmonary bronchi discharge air into the posterior air sacs at the [[Anatomical terms of location#Caudal|caudal]] end of the bird.

Thus [[Lungfish]] possess one or two lungs, and the [[Anabantoidei|labyrinth fish]] have developed a special  \"labyrinth organ\", which characterizes this suborder of fish. The labyrinth organ is a much-folded supra[[Branchial arches|branchial]] accessory [[breathing organ]]. It is formed by a [[Blood vessel|vascularized]] expansion of the epibranchial bone of the first gill arch, and is used for [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] in air.<ref name =\"Pinter\">Pinter, H.

Barron's Educational Series, Inc., {{ISBN|0-8120-5635-3}}</ref>\n\nThis organ allows labyrinth fish to take in [[oxygen]] directly from the air, instead of taking it from the water in which they reside through use of [[gills]]. The labyrinth organ helps the oxygen in the inhaled air to be absorbed into the [[bloodstream]]. As a result, labyrinth fish can survive for a short period of time out of water, as they can inhale the air around them, provided they stay moist.\n\nLabyrinth fish are not born with functional labyrinth organs.

Some of the smallest [[spider]]s and [[mite]]s can breathe simply by exchanging gas through the surface of the body. Larger spiders, [[scorpion]]s and other [[arthropods]] use a primitive [[book lung]].\n\n====Insects====\n{{Main|Respiratory system of insects}}\nMost insects breath passively through their [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s (special openings in the [[exoskeleton]]) and the air reaches every part of the body by means of a series of smaller and smaller tubes called 'trachaea' when their diameters are relatively large, and '[[tracheole]]s' when their diameters are very small. The tracheoles make contact with individual cells throughout the body.<ref name=campbell /> They are partially filled with fluid, which can be withdrawn from the individual tracheoles when the tissues, such as muscles,  are active and have a high demand for oxygen, bringing the air closer to the active cells.<ref name=campbell /> This is probably brought about by the buildup of lactic acid in the active muscles causing an osmotic gradient, moving the water out of the tracheoles and into the active cells.  Diffusion of gases is effective over small distances but not over larger ones, this is one of the reasons insects are all relatively small. Insects which do not have spiracles and trachaea, such as some Collembola, breathe directly through their skins, also by diffusion of gases.<ref>[http://www.earthlife.net/insects/anatomy.html The Earth Life Web, Insect Morphology and Anatomy]. Earthlife.net. Retrieved on 2013-04-21.</ref>\n\nThe number of spiracles an insect has is variable between species, however, they always come in pairs, one on each side of the body, and usually one pair per segment. Some of the Diplura have eleven, with four pairs on the thorax, but in most of the ancient forms of insects, such as Dragonflies and Grasshoppers there are two thoracic and eight abdominal spiracles. However, in most of the remaining insects, there are fewer. It is at the level of the tracheoles that oxygen is delivered to the cells for respiration.\n\nInsects were once believed to exchange gases with the environment continuously by the [[simple diffusion]] of gases into the tracheal system. More recently, however, large variation in insect ventilatory patterns has been documented and insect respiration appears to be highly variable. Some small insects do not demonstrate continuous respiratory movements and may lack muscular control of the spiracles. Others, however, utilize [[muscle contraction|muscular contraction]] of the [[abdomen]] along with coordinated spiracle contraction and relaxation to generate cyclical gas exchange patterns and to reduce water loss into the atmosphere. The most extreme form of these patterns is termed [[discontinuous gas exchange]] cycles.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Lighton\n | first = JRB\n | title = Discontinuous gas exchange in insects\n | journal = Annu Rev Entomol\n | volume = 41\n | pages = 309\u2013324\n | date = January 1996\n | doi = 10.1146/annurev.en.41.010196.001521 | pmid = 8546448\n }}</ref>\n\n===Molluscs===\n{{Main |Respiratory system of gastropods}}\n[[Molluscs]] generally possess gills that allow gas exchange between the aqueous environment and their circulatory systems. These animals also possess a heart that pumps blood containing [[hemocyanin]] as its oxygen-capturing molecule.<ref name=campbell /> Hence, this respiratory system is similar to that of vertebrate fish. The [[respiratory system of gastropods]] can include either gills or a lung.\n\n==Plants==\n{{Main|Photosynthesis}}\n[[Plant]]s use [[carbon dioxide]] gas in the process of [[photosynthesis]], and exhale [[oxygen]] gas as waste. The chemical equation of photosynthesis is 6 CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) and 6 H<sub>2</sub>O (water), which in the presence of sunlight makes C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (glucose) and 6 O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen). Photosynthesis uses electrons on the carbon atoms as the repository for the energy obtained from sunlight.<ref name=stryer>{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=In: Biochemistry. |chapter= Photosynthesis |edition= Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H. FreeMan and Company|date= 1995 |pages= 653\u2013680 |isbn= 0-7167-2009-4 }}</ref> Respiration is the opposite of photosynthesis. It reclaims the energy to power chemical reactions in cells. In so doing the carbon atoms and their electrons are combined with oxygen forming CO<sub>2</sub> which is easily removed from both the cells and the organism. Plants use both processes, photosynthesis to capture the energy and [[Aerobic cellular respiration|oxidative metabolism]] to use it.\n\nPlant respiration is limited by the process of [[diffusion]]. Plants take in carbon dioxide through holes, known as [[stoma]]ta, that can open and close on the undersides of their [[leaf|leaves]] and sometimes other parts of their anatomy. Most plants require some oxygen for [[catabolic]] processes (break-down reactions that release energy). But the quantity of O<sub>2</sub> used per hour is small as they are not involved in activities that require high rates of [[Aerobic cellular respiration|aerobic]] metabolism. Their requirement for air, however, is very high as they need CO<sub>2</sub> for photosynthesis, which constitutes only 0.04% of the environmental air. Thus, to make 1&nbsp;g of glucose requires the removal of all the CO<sub>2</sub> from ''at least'' 18.7&nbsp;liters of air at sea level. But inefficiencies in the photosynthetic process cause considerably greater volumes of air to be used.<ref name=stryer /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Neil A.|title= Biology|edition= Second|publisher= Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc|location= Redwood City, California|date= 1990|pages=206\u2013223|isbn=0-8053-1800-3}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Great Oxygenation Event]]\n* [[Respiratory adaptation]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikibooks|Human Physiology|The respiratory system}}\n{{Wikibooks|Anatomy and Physiology of Animals|Respiratory System}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080913133403/http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/farabee/BIOBK/BioBookRESPSYS.html#Diseases%20of%20the%20Respiratory%20Sys A high school level description of the respiratory system]\n*[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/chb/lectures/anatomy7.html Introduction to Respiratory System]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090326024545/http://www.scienceaid.co.uk/biology/humans/lungs.html Science aid: Respiratory System] A simple guide for high school students\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070807215651/http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/bemis/FAOV4/Ch18.doc The Respiratory System] University level (Microsoft Word document)\n*[http://meded.ucsd.edu/ifp/jwest/resp_phys/index.html Lectures in respiratory physiology] by noted respiratory physiologist [[John B.

This type of iron is unlike most of the iron in the earth, as the iron in the earth was much deeper than the humans of that time period were able to excavate. The nickel content of the meteoric iron made it not need to be heated up, and instead, it was hammered and shaped into tools and weapons.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DaAmwiJ4rnEC&pg=PA125#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Understanding materials science'', p. 125, Rolf E.

The apparent terrorist attack is named \"Careless Monday\", and no one takes responsibility. Three months on, university graduate Saki Morimi visits [[New York City]] and then [[Washington D.C.]] for her graduation trip. Outside the [[White House]], Saki encounters a naked Japanese man suffering from [[amnesia]]. The man, after receiving Saki's coat, follows the directions of a [[concierge]], Juiz, on his unusual [[cell phone]], to an apartment where he finds multiple [[fake passport]]s, choosing the identity of Akira Takizawa. Saki appears to retrieve her passport, and they return to Japan, where a new missile has hit.\n\nTakizawa discovers that his phone carries \u00a58.2 billion in digital money, and that he is part of a game, where twelve individuals called Sele\u00e7\u00e3o are given [[Japanese yen|\u00a510 billion]] to \"save\" Japan in some way. The Sele\u00e7\u00e3o are able to contact Juiz, who can fulfill their orders for a price. However, if the money is used up completely, or for selfish purposes, the individual will be eliminated by the Supporter, the anonymous \"twelfth man\" of the group. During the search for answers, Takizawa learns he was involved in Careless Monday, transporting twenty-thousand [[NEET]]s to [[Dubai]] after they helped evacuate the missiles' attacks before the attacks.\n\nHe also encounters other Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, including [[National Police Agency (Japan)|police officer]] Y\u016bsei Kond\u014d, [[neurosurgeon]] Dr. Hajime Hiura, and [[serial killer]] Kuroha Diana Shiratori, who targets rapists. Saki and her friends, who run a company called Eden of the East, eventually become involved in the conspiracies surrounding Takizawa. The company's name stems from a cell phone app that can recognise and provide details on items and people via social networking.\n\nTakizawa meets Yutaka Itazu, a [[hikikomori]] and hacker, who studies Takizawa and the late Kond\u014d's phones, able to access the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o requests. They discover Takizawa did not launch the missiles, but it was orchestrated by other Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, Daiju Mononobe and Ry\u014d Y\u016bki. After Takizawa leaves, Itazu discovers sixty more missiles will be launched, but is run over by Mononobe before he can inform Takizawa. However, Itazu sends the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o database to Eden beforehand, and recovers in hospital.\n\nMononobe approaches Takizawa, inviting him to his endgame. He explains that Mr. Outside is actually Saiz\u014d At\u014d, an elderly businessman who helped rebuild [[Post-occupation Japan|post-war Japan]]. He believes At\u014d has since died. Travelling to At\u014d's business facility, Mononobe reveals to Takizawa that Juiz is an advanced [[artificial intelligence]], housed in twelve [[supercomputer]]s. Takizawa objects to Mononobe and Y\u016bki's plan and leaves, but not before they reveal Takizawa's made himself a martyr to defend the NEETs from being accused as terrorists, erasing his memory to protect them.\n\nTakizawa reunites with Saki and Eden at his home, a [[shopping mall]] in [[Toyosu]], just as the twenty-thousand NEETs return from Dubai on a cargo ship. Takizawa draws everyone to the roof, ordering them to suggest a countermeasure for the approaching missiles. Juiz summons the [[JSDF]] to intercept the missiles. Takizawa, knowing he will be unable to pose as a terrorist, asks Juiz to make him the \"King of Japan\", erasing his memory once again, but he slips his cell phone into Saki's pocket beforehand.\n\n===''The King of Eden''===\nSix months after the events of the anime, Takizawa has disappeared, while Saki searches for his whereabouts. Juiz sends Saki a message he recorded before erasing his memory again, Takizawa instructing her to meet in their \"special place\". Following the missile strike, Eden became a successful business, and Takizawa has become a folk hero named the \"Air King\", his image marketed by Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, Jintaro Tsuji, hoping to turn him into a martyr or terrorist. Eden also learns Takizawa's last name has been changed to Iinuma, the same as the recently deceased Prime Minister of Japan. Tsuji spreads rumours that Takizawa is Iinuma's illegitimate son.\n\nSaki, realizing that Takizawa's message may be alluding to [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] in New York, travels there. She discovers a gun has been smuggled into her luggage, her cab driver fleeing with Takizawa's phone in the back. Saki eventually finds Takizawa, who does not recognize her. They retrieve her purse and Takizawa's phone from the cabbie, Takizawa accepting his lost identity. Eden, who have access to the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o database, learn Y\u016bki destroyed his phone, and Dr. Hiura is alive, his memory erased by the Supporter. They later discover that Mononobe has hacked their systems, forcing them to shut Eden down.\n\nTakizawa hopes to find out what became of his mother, traveling with Saki to a [[carousel]] where they find a golden ring left there by his mother. They are attacked by men working for Iinuma, and film director Taishi Naomoto, a fellow Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, but he is arrested. Kuroha aids Takizawa, informing him that he must return to Japan to confirm his illegitimacy as the Prime Minister's son. Mononobe begins targeting a series of [[truck]]s, actually housing the individual Juiz supercomputers, with missiles. He destroys the Supporter and Tsuji's trucks, while Kuroha sacrifices her own to keep Takizawa in the game. She leaves while Takizawa and Saki fly to Japan.\n\n===''Paradise Lost''===\nTakizawa and Saki arrive in Japan, meeting Iinuma's [[widow]] Chigusa, who removes several strands of Takizawa's hair for a [[DNA test]]. Takizawa is separated from Saki, asking her to track down his mother by identifying his pet dog through Eden. Takizawa later escapes his escorts by swapping places with one of the NEETs. He contacts Eden, who have retreated to the university campus, informing him of the Juiz trucks.\n\nSaki and her friend Satoshi Osugi track down Takizawa's mother, Aya, who runs a bar. She admits she lived in New York and had a fling with Iinuma, but does not confirm or deny the identity of Takizawa's father. Aya flees when Mononobe sends police to interrogate her. Takizawa tracks down his Juiz truck, meeting up with Eden members Micchon and Sis, who hijack Mononobe's truck. Eden's leader Kazuomi Hirasawa meets Saiz\u014d At\u014d, discovering he is alive and works as a cab driver, doubling also as the Supporter.\n\nTakizawa and Eden arrive at Iinuma's house, where Mononobe meets Takizawa. Mononobe asks him to retire from the game so he can win and take control of the government. Takizawa agrees as long as Mononobe becomes Prime Minister, but the latter declines. Takizawa goes ahead with his own endgame, addressing Japan using the \"Airship\" phone app, roleplaying as a terrorist but encourages society to change their country for the better. In a final act, he gives all the recipients one yen each.\n\nImpressed, At\u014d ends the game, declaring all of the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o as winners. As a farewell gift, he erases their memories of the game over the phones. However, Takizawa is unaffected, immune to its effects. Mononobe leaves, running into Y\u016bki, who is unaware of what has happened, and tries to murder Mononobe for abandoning him. Mononobe crashes his car, running over Y\u016bki in the process. Takizawa checks the DNA test, discovering he is unrelated to her husband. He departs, kissing Saki and promising to meet her again. In the epilogue, Saki narrates how Eden shut down for a while to support the NEETs. In a final scene, Takizawa meets At\u014d, and they drive off to speak about future plans.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Saki Morimi}}|\u68ee\u7f8e \u54b2|Morimi Saki}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Saori Hayami]]|[[Leah Clark]]}}\n:Saki Morimi is a young woman in her last year in university. After her parents died, she has been living with her married elder sister and her family, who have been supporting her through college. She visits New York City as part of her graduation trip but leaves her friends to visit Washington D.C. alone. At the start of the series, she throws a coin at the [[White House]] lawn and is approached by police, but Akira Takizawa bails her out of trouble. After realizing that her passport is in the coat she gives to Akira, she follows him, and later goes back with him to Tokyo, Japan. She tries to get a job so that she does not become reliant on her sister's family, but after her interview with her brother-in-law's former company goes badly, she follows Akira on his adventures and gets her old club, \"Eden of the East\", to partner with Akira on their business venture.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Akira Takizawa}}|\u6edd\u6ca2 \u6717|Takizawa Akira}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Ry\u014dhei Kimura]]|[[Jason Liebrecht]]}}\n:A young man who lost his memory because of a brainwashing program, Akira Takizawa meets Saki Morimi in Washington D.C., appearing naked and only carrying a handgun and an extremely advanced cell phone with the phrase ''\"noblesse oblige\"'' printed on it and 8.2 billion yen in digital money credit.  When Saki is questioned by police after she throws a coin in the grounds of the [[White House]], he helps her out and she gives him her coat to thank him.  When he makes his first call, a female voice claiming to be \"Juiz\" answers. She sends him a map that marks an apartment building where he is apparently staying. In his apartment, he finds guns and many different passports which seem to all belong to him. Saki follows after realizing she left her passport in the coat she gave him and the two decide to return to Japan together. His real name and DOB are unknown; his current identity as Akira Takizawa was chosen from the passports he found, which lists that in [[Toyosu]], Japan and that he was born on January 7, 1989, one day younger than Saki Morimi.\n<!--\nDo not split off, characters not notable enough for own sections\n-->\n\n===Eden of the East club===\nThe Eden of the East club started out as a small recycling group, but has quickly turned into a springboard for a successful commercial website, thanks to Micchon's revolutionary image recognition engine that resides in the ''Eden'' website and Saki's ability to improve the value of any item, including junk.

A former bureaucrat, he has connections to many of the political leaders in Japan. He maneuvers to become an executive (CEO  in the TV series English dub) of the ATO Institution. He brings Akira to the ATO headquarters and reveals more information about his past with the hopes of recruiting him to his side. His ambition is not only to win the game, but to replace Mr. Outside himself as he assumes Mr. Outside is dead. According to him, Japan is in a state of apathy caused by the economic prosperity it has obtained since the end of [[World War II]], and the strong political influence from countries like the United States into their society, thus he plans to \"save\" the country by rallying the population with a wide scale terrorist attack.<ref name=\"ep10\"/> However, Akira and the NEETs recruited by him managed to foil his plans, first with Careless Monday, and then by countering the missiles at the end of the regular TV series.<ref name = \"ep11\">''Eden of the East'', episode 11</ref> In the ''King of Eden'' movie, he uses the Japanese police Public Security Dept to investigate the Eden of the East group, which has been involved with Akira Takizawa's activities.

In ''Paradise Lost'', he reveals that he plans to overthrow the current government and install a more powerful one at the cost of individual freedom.

(The Juiz devices originally were stored in a facility that Mononobe found, but they were relocated to mobile platforms, leaving behind large holes at the facility). When a Sele\u00e7\u00e3o is removed from the game, their trailer is scrapped, or alternately, a Sele\u00e7\u00e3o is removed if their trailer is destroyed. Judging by the differing reactions of the various Juizes, the AIs appear to be independent entities, but initialized from the same generative code base. In episode 10, a woman appears at ATO headquarters with the same voice and manner of speech as Juiz; this serves to cast doubt on whether she is actually Juiz or whether her voice and personality (if not her memories) simply were used as the model for developing Juiz.

Like Brienza, he pointed out that \"the debt ''Eden'' owes to ''The Bourne Identity'' is considerable\", but concludes that \"the result is, in a word, superb\".<ref name=\"ANN Spring 09 Preview Guide: Carl Kimlinger\" />\n\nWriting for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Charles Solomon ranked the series the fourth best anime on his \"Top 10\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/anime-top-10-evangelion-fullmetal-alchemist-lead-2010s-best/ | title=Anime Top 10: \u2018Evangelion,\u2019 \u2018Fullmetal Alchemist\u2019 lead 2010\u2032s best | author=Solomon, Charles | date=December 21, 2010 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate=February 15, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814112028/http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/anime-top-10-evangelion-fullmetal-alchemist-lead-2010s-best|archivedate=August 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal bar|Film}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website |http://www.juiz.jp/}}\n* {{Cite web |url = http://www.production-ig.co.jp/contents/works_sp/1810_/ |title = Eden of the East |publisher = [[Production I.G]] |access-date = 2009-03-18 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090227014748/http://www.production-ig.co.jp/contents/works_sp/1810_/ |archive-date = 2009-02-27 |url-status = dead }}\n* {{Cite web |url = http://www.funimation.com/edenoftheeast/ | title = Eden of the East | type = official anime Website | publisher = [[FUNimation]]}}\n* {{ann|anime|10474}}\n\n{{Production I.G}}\n{{Noitamina}}\n\n[[Category:2009 Japanese novels]]\n[[Category:2010 Japanese novels]]\n[[Category:Anime with original screenplays]]\n[[Category:Films set in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Funimation]]\n[[Category:IG Port franchises]]\n[[Category:Mystery anime and manga]]\n[[Category:NoitaminA]]\n[[Category:Political thriller anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Production I.G]]\n[[Category:Psychological anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Romance anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Terrorism in fiction]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Japan]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Fiction about amnesia]]\n[[Category:Cameras in fiction]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses|East of Eden (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Eden of the East\n| image           = Eden of the East DVD volume 1.jpg\n| caption         = Cover art of the first Japanese DVD volume featuring protagonists Saki Morimi (left) and Akira Takizawa (right).\n| ja_kanji        = \u6771\u306e\u30a8\u30c7\u30f3\n| ja_romaji       = Higashi no Eden\n| genre = [[Mystery fiction|Mystery]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jensen |first1=Paul |last2=Beckett |first2=James |title=Eden of the East - Shelf Life |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2016-05-02/.101662 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=January 6, 2020 |date=May 2, 2016 |quote=The series' initial 11-episode run was one of the most tightly paced and intriguing mystery/thrillers I'd seen in a long time}}</ref> [[political thriller]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kimlinger |first1=Carl |title=Eden of the East BLURAY - Review |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/eden-of-the-east/bluray-the-complete-series |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=January 6, 2020 |date=October 18, 2010 | quote=It's a strange start to one of the stranger political thrillers in recent years;}}</ref> [[psychological fiction|psychological]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Watch Eden Of The East Episodes Sub & Dub |url=https://www.funimation.com/shows/eden-of-the-east/ |website=[[Funimation]] |accessdate=January 6, 2020}}</ref><!-- Genres should be based on what reliable sources list them as and not on personal interpretations.

The apparent terrorist attack is named \"Careless Monday\", and no one takes responsibility. Three months on, university graduate Saki Morimi visits [[New York City]] and then [[Washington D.C.]] for her graduation trip. Outside the [[White House]], Saki encounters a naked Japanese man suffering from [[amnesia]]. The man, after receiving Saki's coat, follows the directions of a [[concierge]], Juiz, on his unusual [[cell phone]], to an apartment where he finds multiple [[fake passport]]s, choosing the identity of Akira Takizawa. Saki appears to retrieve her passport, and they return to Japan, where a new missile has hit.\n\nTakizawa discovers that his phone carries \u00a58.2 billion in digital money, and that he is part of a game, where twelve individuals called Sele\u00e7\u00e3o are given [[Japanese yen|\u00a510 billion]] to \"save\" Japan in some way. The Sele\u00e7\u00e3o are able to contact Juiz, who can fulfill their orders for a price. However, if the money is used up completely, or for selfish purposes, the individual will be eliminated by the Supporter, the anonymous \"twelfth man\" of the group. During the search for answers, Takizawa learns he was involved in Careless Monday, transporting twenty-thousand [[NEET]]s to [[Dubai]] after they helped evacuate the missiles' attacks before the attacks.\n\nHe also encounters other Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, including [[National Police Agency (Japan)|police officer]] Y\u016bsei Kond\u014d, [[neurosurgeon]] Dr. Hajime Hiura, and [[serial killer]] Kuroha Diana Shiratori, who targets rapists. Saki and her friends, who run a company called Eden of the East, eventually become involved in the conspiracies surrounding Takizawa. The company's name stems from a cell phone app that can recognise and provide details on items and people via social networking.\n\nTakizawa meets Yutaka Itazu, a [[hikikomori]] and hacker, who studies Takizawa and the late Kond\u014d's phones, able to access the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o requests. They discover Takizawa did not launch the missiles, but it was orchestrated by other Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, Daiju Mononobe and Ry\u014d Y\u016bki. After Takizawa leaves, Itazu discovers sixty more missiles will be launched, but is run over by Mononobe before he can inform Takizawa. However, Itazu sends the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o database to Eden beforehand, and recovers in hospital.\n\nMononobe approaches Takizawa, inviting him to his endgame. He explains that Mr. Outside is actually Saiz\u014d At\u014d, an elderly businessman who helped rebuild [[Post-occupation Japan|post-war Japan]]. He believes At\u014d has since died. Travelling to At\u014d's business facility, Mononobe reveals to Takizawa that Juiz is an advanced [[artificial intelligence]], housed in twelve [[supercomputer]]s. Takizawa objects to Mononobe and Y\u016bki's plan and leaves, but not before they reveal Takizawa's made himself a martyr to defend the NEETs from being accused as terrorists, erasing his memory to protect them.\n\nTakizawa reunites with Saki and Eden at his home, a [[shopping mall]] in [[Toyosu]], just as the twenty-thousand NEETs return from Dubai on a cargo ship. Takizawa draws everyone to the roof, ordering them to suggest a countermeasure for the approaching missiles. Juiz summons the [[JSDF]] to intercept the missiles. Takizawa, knowing he will be unable to pose as a terrorist, asks Juiz to make him the \"King of Japan\", erasing his memory once again, but he slips his cell phone into Saki's pocket beforehand.\n\n===''The King of Eden''===\nSix months after the events of the anime, Takizawa has disappeared, while Saki searches for his whereabouts. Juiz sends Saki a message he recorded before erasing his memory again, Takizawa instructing her to meet in their \"special place\". Following the missile strike, Eden became a successful business, and Takizawa has become a folk hero named the \"Air King\", his image marketed by Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, Jintaro Tsuji, hoping to turn him into a martyr or terrorist. Eden also learns Takizawa's last name has been changed to Iinuma, the same as the recently deceased Prime Minister of Japan. Tsuji spreads rumours that Takizawa is Iinuma's illegitimate son.\n\nSaki, realizing that Takizawa's message may be alluding to [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] in New York, travels there. She discovers a gun has been smuggled into her luggage, her cab driver fleeing with Takizawa's phone in the back. Saki eventually finds Takizawa, who does not recognize her. They retrieve her purse and Takizawa's phone from the cabbie, Takizawa accepting his lost identity. Eden, who have access to the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o database, learn Y\u016bki destroyed his phone, and Dr. Hiura is alive, his memory erased by the Supporter. They later discover that Mononobe has hacked their systems, forcing them to shut Eden down.\n\nTakizawa hopes to find out what became of his mother, traveling with Saki to a [[carousel]] where they find a golden ring left there by his mother. They are attacked by men working for Iinuma, and film director Taishi Naomoto, a fellow Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, but he is arrested. Kuroha aids Takizawa, informing him that he must return to Japan to confirm his illegitimacy as the Prime Minister's son. Mononobe begins targeting a series of [[truck]]s, actually housing the individual Juiz supercomputers, with missiles. He destroys the Supporter and Tsuji's trucks, while Kuroha sacrifices her own to keep Takizawa in the game. She leaves while Takizawa and Saki fly to Japan.\n\n===''Paradise Lost''===\nTakizawa and Saki arrive in Japan, meeting Iinuma's [[widow]] Chigusa, who removes several strands of Takizawa's hair for a [[DNA test]]. Takizawa is separated from Saki, asking her to track down his mother by identifying his pet dog through Eden. Takizawa later escapes his escorts by swapping places with one of the NEETs. He contacts Eden, who have retreated to the university campus, informing him of the Juiz trucks.\n\nSaki and her friend Satoshi Osugi track down Takizawa's mother, Aya, who runs a bar. She admits she lived in New York and had a fling with Iinuma, but does not confirm or deny the identity of Takizawa's father. Aya flees when Mononobe sends police to interrogate her. Takizawa tracks down his Juiz truck, meeting up with Eden members Micchon and Sis, who hijack Mononobe's truck. Eden's leader Kazuomi Hirasawa meets Saiz\u014d At\u014d, discovering he is alive and works as a cab driver, doubling also as the Supporter.\n\nTakizawa and Eden arrive at Iinuma's house, where Mononobe meets Takizawa. Mononobe asks him to retire from the game so he can win and take control of the government. Takizawa agrees as long as Mononobe becomes Prime Minister, but the latter declines. Takizawa goes ahead with his own endgame, addressing Japan using the \"Airship\" phone app, roleplaying as a terrorist but encourages society to change their country for the better. In a final act, he gives all the recipients one yen each.\n\nImpressed, At\u014d ends the game, declaring all of the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o as winners. As a farewell gift, he erases their memories of the game over the phones. However, Takizawa is unaffected, immune to its effects. Mononobe leaves, running into Y\u016bki, who is unaware of what has happened, and tries to murder Mononobe for abandoning him. Mononobe crashes his car, running over Y\u016bki in the process. Takizawa checks the DNA test, discovering he is unrelated to her husband. He departs, kissing Saki and promising to meet her again. In the epilogue, Saki narrates how Eden shut down for a while to support the NEETs. In a final scene, Takizawa meets At\u014d, and they drive off to speak about future plans.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Saki Morimi}}|\u68ee\u7f8e \u54b2|Morimi Saki}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Saori Hayami]]|[[Leah Clark]]}}\n:Saki Morimi is a young woman in her last year in university. After her parents died, she has been living with her married elder sister and her family, who have been supporting her through college. She visits New York City as part of her graduation trip but leaves her friends to visit Washington D.C. alone. At the start of the series, she throws a coin at the [[White House]] lawn and is approached by police, but Akira Takizawa bails her out of trouble. After realizing that her passport is in the coat she gives to Akira, she follows him, and later goes back with him to Tokyo, Japan. She tries to get a job so that she does not become reliant on her sister's family, but after her interview with her brother-in-law's former company goes badly, she follows Akira on his adventures and gets her old club, \"Eden of the East\", to partner with Akira on their business venture.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Akira Takizawa}}|\u6edd\u6ca2 \u6717|Takizawa Akira}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Ry\u014dhei Kimura]]|[[Jason Liebrecht]]}}\n:A young man who lost his memory because of a brainwashing program, Akira Takizawa meets Saki Morimi in Washington D.C., appearing naked and only carrying a handgun and an extremely advanced cell phone with the phrase ''\"noblesse oblige\"'' printed on it and 8.2 billion yen in digital money credit.  When Saki is questioned by police after she throws a coin in the grounds of the [[White House]], he helps her out and she gives him her coat to thank him.  When he makes his first call, a female voice claiming to be \"Juiz\" answers. She sends him a map that marks an apartment building where he is apparently staying. In his apartment, he finds guns and many different passports which seem to all belong to him. Saki follows after realizing she left her passport in the coat she gave him and the two decide to return to Japan together. His real name and DOB are unknown; his current identity as Akira Takizawa was chosen from the passports he found, which lists that in [[Toyosu]], Japan and that he was born on January 7, 1989, one day younger than Saki Morimi.\n<!--\nDo not split off, characters not notable enough for own sections\n-->\n\n===Eden of the East club===\nThe Eden of the East club started out as a small recycling group, but has quickly turned into a springboard for a successful commercial website, thanks to Micchon's revolutionary image recognition engine that resides in the ''Eden'' website and Saki's ability to improve the value of any item, including junk. Soon, the site's ability to work on phones attracted many student subscribers.

He brings Akira to the ATO headquarters and reveals more information about his past with the hopes of recruiting him to his side. His ambition is not only to win the game, but to replace Mr. Outside himself as he assumes Mr. Outside is dead.

In ''Paradise Lost'', he reveals that he plans to overthrow the current government and install a more powerful one at the cost of individual freedom.

When a Sele\u00e7\u00e3o is removed from the game, their trailer is scrapped, or alternately, a Sele\u00e7\u00e3o is removed if their trailer is destroyed. Judging by the differing reactions of the various Juizes, the AIs appear to be independent entities, but initialized from the same generative code base. In episode 10, a woman appears at ATO headquarters with the same voice and manner of speech as Juiz; this serves to cast doubt on whether she is actually Juiz or whether her voice and personality (if not her memories) simply were used as the model for developing Juiz.

Like Brienza, he pointed out that \"the debt ''Eden'' owes to ''The Bourne Identity'' is considerable\", but concludes that \"the result is, in a word, superb\".<ref name=\"ANN Spring 09 Preview Guide: Carl Kimlinger\" />\n\nWriting for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Charles Solomon ranked the series the fourth best anime on his \"Top 10\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/anime-top-10-evangelion-fullmetal-alchemist-lead-2010s-best/ | title=Anime Top 10: \u2018Evangelion,\u2019 \u2018Fullmetal Alchemist\u2019 lead 2010\u2032s best | author=Solomon, Charles | date=December 21, 2010 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate=February 15, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814112028/http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/anime-top-10-evangelion-fullmetal-alchemist-lead-2010s-best|archivedate=August 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal bar|Film}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website |http://www.juiz.jp/}}\n* {{Cite web |url = http://www.production-ig.co.jp/contents/works_sp/1810_/ |title = Eden of the East |publisher = [[Production I.G]] |access-date = 2009-03-18 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090227014748/http://www.production-ig.co.jp/contents/works_sp/1810_/ |archive-date = 2009-02-27 |url-status = dead }}\n* {{Cite web |url = http://www.funimation.com/edenoftheeast/ | title = Eden of the East | type = official anime Website | publisher = [[FUNimation]]}}\n* {{ann|anime|10474}}\n\n{{Production I.G}}\n{{Noitamina}}\n\n[[Category:2009 Japanese novels]]\n[[Category:2010 Japanese novels]]\n[[Category:Anime with original screenplays]]\n[[Category:Films set in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Funimation]]\n[[Category:IG Port franchises]]\n[[Category:Mystery anime and manga]]\n[[Category:NoitaminA]]\n[[Category:Political thriller anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Production I.G]]\n[[Category:Psychological anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Romance anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Terrorism in fiction]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Japan]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Fiction about amnesia]]\n[[Category:Cameras in fiction]]\n", "name_user": "Xezbeth", "label": "safe", "comment": "+link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_of_the_East"}

It is a Grade I [[listed building]]{{sfn|British Listed Buildings}} and stands at the highest point in the village.{{sfn|CRSBI}} Much of the church dates from the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] period, although the original central tower was replaced by a brick one at the north-east corner in 1659 and some alterations, particularly to the fenestration, the nave arcades and transepts, and the north porch, were made in two stages during the 19th century.\n\nAccording to [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] it is \"a puzzle church and an extremely powerful one\",{{sfn|Pevsner|p=187}} while it has also been called \"one of the finest parish churches in the country\"{{sfn|British History Online}} and the \"cathedral of North Hampshire\" (Rev. Charles Stooks).{{sfn|CRSBI}} Of the 19th-century restoration of the building, [[Simon Jenkins]] states that \"for once the Victorian  does not emerge the winner, especially in the chancel\",{{sfn|Jenkins|p=245}} which latter [[John Betjeman|Betjeman]] terms \"splendid\".{{sfn|Betjeman|p=242}}\n\n==History==\n===Anglo-Saxon===\nAn [[Anglo-Saxon]] church from the 9th century was built on the site of the current [[Norman architecture|Norman]] church.{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 1}} At this time [[Alfred the Great]] owned the manor and hundred of Crondall, and the rector of Crondall had responsibility for the entire area of the hundred, which covered much of what is north-east Hampshire today, including [[Long Sutton, Hampshire|Long Sutton]], [[Aldershot]] and [[Yateley]] parishes all the way down to the [[Harrow Way]].{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 1}}{{sfn|CRSBI}} This responsibility continued after the [[Norman Conquest|Conquest]], with [[Walkelin]], the Bishop of Winchester, owning Crondall in 1086.{{sfn|CRSBI}}\n\n[[Domesday Book]] in 1086 gave the church's value as 20 shillings, but the only archaeological evidence of it today is a flint wall under the north transept and a blocked wall on the outside of the southern transept.{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 1}}\n\n===Norman===\nArchaeological work carried out under the nave arcade uncovered an earlier Norman church built on the foundations of the Anglo-Saxon church than the one we see today, constructed at roughly the same time as the Norman motte and bailey at [[Crondall#Barley Pound, Motte and Bailey|Barley Pound]]. The current church was built in around 1170 on the order of [[Henry of Blois]], Bishop of Winchester and [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]]'s half brother, possibly with the help of masons who had completed their work on [[Winchester Cathedral]].{{sfn|Crondall and Ewshot}}\n\nOn the exterior, the south door and arch, west doorway, blocked north aisle window and string course are all Norman.{{sfn|Pevsner|p=187}} The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] arches of the nave were constructed on the foundation of the earlier Norman church, with the [[Gothic architecture#Transition from Romanesque to Gothic architecture|Transitional]] chancel being added at the end of the 12th century,{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 1}} probably being started around 1170, and the whole church being completed by the end of the century.{{sfn|British History Online}} The chancel has a quadripartite ribbed vault, with modern plaster between the ribs. The central boss is of the [[Lamb of God]].{{sfn|Jenkins|p=245}} There was a central tower,{{sfn|British History Online}}\nwhich was removed in 1659, the thrusting out of the responds between choir and nave being visible today, as are distortion in the vault ribs of the chancel.{{sfn|British History Online}}\n\nThe west doorway was constructed in c. 1200; Pevsner remarks on its \"richly moulded arch\", which is capped by a sculpted head.{{sfn|Pevsner|p=187}}\n[[File:All saints crondall nave.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Nave, with 12th-century arches, leading to chancel of same period]] The font in the nave is thought to be 12th century,{{sfn|CRSBI}}  although the anonymous church guide, as well as Jenkins (who comments it is \"as shapeless as a Henry Moore\"), claim that it comes from the original Anglo-Saxon church.{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 1}}{{sfn|Jenkins|p=245}}\n\n===13th\u201316th century===\nUntil 1284 the avowson (the right to appoint vicars to the church) accompanied ownership of Crondall manor, but in that year [[John of Pontoise]], Bishop of Winchester, gained control of appointments of rectors to Crondall (the rector in turn appointing a vicar) in return for the [[Winchester Cathedral Priory|Priory and Convent of St Swithun]] gaining control of a number of manors.{{sfn|British History Online}} This right was changed in 1318, when the avowson of Crondall was granted to the Chapel of St Elizabeth, Winchester, although it is uncertain whether this, or the 1334 grant to the Priory and Convent of St Swithun, was realised.{{sfn|British History Online}} The rectory and avowson of Crondall were granted by [[Henry Beaufort]], Bishop of Winchester, to the [[Hospital of St Cross]] in Winchester in 1446, a right it retained even after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]].{{sfn|Parish Office, pp. 1\u20132}}\n\nThere are three [[Crusades|Crusader]] crosses on the east jamb of the doorway in the north porch, one of which might have been carved in the 13th century by Sir Alexander Giffard of Itchell Manor, who kept a [[vigil]] at the altar of the church before embarking on crusade.{{sfn|L.C}} On the opposite doorway are crosses which by tradition are pilgrims' crosses made by pilgrims on the nearby [[Pilgrims' Way]] from Winchester to Canterbury before visiting the tomb of [[Thomas Becket]] in [[Canterbury Cathedral]].{{sfn|L.C}}\n\nIn 1538 the church became [[Anglican]] on [[Thomas Cromwell]]'s injunction, following which the wall paintings inside the church were whitewashed, all candlesticks and images were removed, a wooden table replaced the stone altar and a [[Early Modern English Bible translations|Bible in English]] used for services, now conducted in English.{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 2}}\n\nThe windows on the southern side of the chancel date from the 14th century.{{sfn|British History Online}}\nThere is a fine brass on the chancel floor to Nicholas de Kaerwent (vicar 1361\u201381; d. 1381), Rector of Crondall, which incorporates [[Fylfot|Fylfot crosses]] on the stole.{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 1}}\n\nTwo family tombs in the chancel recesses date from this period. The Gifford tomb on the south side (\"Gyfford\";{{sfn|Pevsner|p=188}} \"Giffard\"{{sfn|British History Online}}) (1563) has the inscription: \"Hereunder lyeth the body of John Gyfford Esquyer heyre aparant of Sir Wyll[ia]m Gyfford Knyght who had to wyfe Elizabethe one of the dawghters of Sir George Throkmarton Knight and had by her issue fyve sonnys and viii dawghters and so changyd this mortall lyfe the fyrst day of May in the yere of our Lorde God 1563 on whose soule Jesu have m'cy\". The Paulet tomb on the north (1558) is to Sir George Paulet (d. 1532), a commissioner to the Dissolution{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 5}} and the younger brother of [[William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester]].{{sfn|British History Online}} Many of the inscriptions on this tomb have been erased, some deliberately.{{sfn|British History Online}}\n[[File:All Saints Crondall tower perspective correction.jpg|thumb|right|200px|17th-century tower from west, showing two timber connecting galleries]]\n\n===17th\u201318th century===\nIn 1643 [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] soldiers seized the church under Colonel Birch, CIO to Major-General Sir William Waller.{{sfn|L.C}} The building was soon heavily defended with entrenchments, and the church was further defaced.{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 2}} In subsequent years numerous sightings of the ghosts of Parliamentarian soldiers in the church's graveyard were reported,{{sfn|Scanlan}} particularly of a mounted trooper who is said to disappear through a doorway having ridden up the avenue of limes.{{sfn|L.C}}\n\nA new bell frame was placed in the Norman tower in 1642, two additional bells were added and the roof covered with 1,200 lbs of lead.{{sfn|CRSBI}} By 1657 there was sufficient concern about the stability of the Norman tower following this work that it was decided to bring it down and a new tower of four stages, detached from the church itself and modelled on the tower of St Matthews, Battersea, was built in its place in 1659.{{sfn|British History Online}} This work, which cost \u00a3428,{{sfn|Pevsner|p=187}} took 32 men, 110,000 bricks and 62 loads of sand,{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 4}} and the old church was connected to the new tower by two timber galleries, \"as if part of a Shakespearean theatre\".{{sfn|Jenkins|p=245}} The tower \u2013 a \"proud tower\", according to Betjeman{{sfn|Betjeman|p=242}} \u2013 has a number of arched doorways and windows, and is capped by four octagonal pinnacles on the belfry. The six bells in the tower date from 1616 and 1619 (Henry Knight; the second bell from 1619 has been recast); 1650 (uncredited); and two, including the tenor, 1788 (Robert Wells).{{sfn|British History Online}} The clock in the north face of the tower was replaced in 1876 by one in the east face.{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 4}}\n\n===19th century===\nThere were two periods of building in the 19th century.

It is a Grade I [[listed building]]{{sfn|British Listed Buildings}} and stands at the highest point in the village.{{sfn|CRSBI}} Much of the church dates from the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] period, although the original central tower was replaced by a brick one at the north-east corner in 1659 and some alterations, particularly to the fenestration, the nave arcades and transepts, and the north porch, were made in two stages during the 19th century.\n\nAccording to [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] it is \"a puzzle church and an extremely powerful one\",{{sfn|Pevsner, p. 187}} while it has also been called \"one of the finest parish churches in the country\"{{sfn|British History Online}} and the \"cathedral of North Hampshire\" (Rev. Charles Stooks).{{sfn|CRSBI}} Of the 19th-century restoration of the building, [[Simon Jenkins]] states that \"for once the Victorian  does not emerge the winner, especially in the chancel\",{{sfn|Jenkins, p. 245}} which latter [[John Betjeman|Betjeman]] terms \"splendid\".{{sfn|Betjeman, p. 242}}\n\n==History==\n===Anglo-Saxon===\nAn [[Anglo-Saxon]] church from the 9th century was built on the site of the current [[Norman architecture|Norman]] church.{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 1}} At this time [[Alfred the Great]] owned the manor and hundred of Crondall, and the rector of Crondall had responsibility for the entire area of the hundred, which covered much of what is north-east Hampshire today, including [[Long Sutton, Hampshire|Long Sutton]], [[Aldershot]] and [[Yateley]] parishes all the way down to the [[Harrow Way]].{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 1}}{{sfn|CRSBI}} This responsibility continued after the [[Norman Conquest|Conquest]], with [[Walkelin]], the Bishop of Winchester, owning Crondall in 1086.{{sfn|CRSBI}}\n\n[[Domesday Book]] in 1086 gave the church's value as 20 shillings, but the only archaeological evidence of it today is a flint wall under the north transept and a blocked wall on the outside of the southern transept.{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 1}}\n\n===Norman===\nArchaeological work carried out under the nave arcade uncovered an earlier Norman church built on the foundations of the Anglo-Saxon church than the one we see today, constructed at roughly the same time as the Norman motte and bailey at [[Crondall#Barley Pound, Motte and Bailey|Barley Pound]]. The current church was built in around 1170 on the order of [[Henry of Blois]], Bishop of Winchester and [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]]'s half brother, possibly with the help of masons who had completed their work on [[Winchester Cathedral]].{{sfn|Crondall and Ewshot}}\n\nOn the exterior, the south door and arch, west doorway, blocked north aisle window and string course are all Norman.{{sfn|Pevsner, p. 187}} The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] arches of the nave were constructed on the foundation of the earlier Norman church, with the [[Gothic architecture#Transition from Romanesque to Gothic architecture|Transitional]] chancel being added at the end of the 12th century,{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 1}} probably being started around 1170, and the whole church being completed by the end of the century.{{sfn|British History Online}} The chancel has a quadripartite ribbed vault, with modern plaster between the ribs. The central boss is of the [[Lamb of God]].{{sfn|Jenkins, p. 245}} There was a central tower,{{sfn|British History Online}}\nwhich was removed in 1659, the thrusting out of the responds between choir and nave being visible today, as are distortion in the vault ribs of the chancel.{{sfn|British History Online}}\n\nThe west doorway was constructed in c. 1200; Pevsner remarks on its \"richly moulded arch\", which is capped by a sculpted head.{{sfn|Pevsner, p. 187}}\n[[File:All saints crondall nave.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Nave, with 12th-century arches, leading to chancel of same period]] The font in the nave is thought to be 12th century,{{sfn|CRSBI}}  although the anonymous church guide, as well as Jenkins (who comments it is \"as shapeless as a Henry Moore\"), claim that it comes from the original Anglo-Saxon church.{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 1}}{{sfn|Jenkins, p. 245}}\n\n===13th\u201316th century===\nUntil 1284 the avowson (the right to appoint vicars to the church) accompanied ownership of Crondall manor, but in that year [[John of Pontoise]], Bishop of Winchester, gained control of appointments of rectors to Crondall (the rector in turn appointing a vicar) in return for the [[Winchester Cathedral Priory|Priory and Convent of St Swithun]] gaining control of a number of manors.{{sfn|British History Online}} This right was changed in 1318, when the avowson of Crondall was granted to the Chapel of St Elizabeth, Winchester, although it is uncertain whether this, or the 1334 grant to the Priory and Convent of St Swithun, was realised.{{sfn|British History Online}} The rectory and avowson of Crondall were granted by [[Henry Beaufort]], Bishop of Winchester, to the [[Hospital of St Cross]] in Winchester in 1446, a right it retained even after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]].{{sfn|Parish Office, pp. 1\u20132}}\n\nThere are three [[Crusades|Crusader]] crosses on the east jamb of the doorway in the north porch, one of which might have been carved in the 13th century by Sir Alexander Giffard of Itchell Manor, who kept a [[vigil]] at the altar of the church before embarking on crusade.{{sfn|L.C}} On the opposite doorway are crosses which by tradition are pilgrims' crosses made by pilgrims on the nearby [[Pilgrims' Way]] from Winchester to Canterbury before visiting the tomb of [[Thomas Becket]] in [[Canterbury Cathedral]].{{sfn|L.C}}\n\nIn 1538 the church became [[Anglican]] on [[Thomas Cromwell]]'s injunction, following which the wall paintings inside the church were whitewashed, all candlesticks and images were removed, a wooden table replaced the stone altar and a [[Early Modern English Bible translations|Bible in English]] used for services, now conducted in English.{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 2}}\n\nThe windows on the southern side of the chancel date from the 14th century.{{sfn|British History Online}}\nThere is a fine brass on the chancel floor to Nicholas de Kaerwent (vicar 1361\u201381; d. 1381), Rector of Crondall, which incorporates [[Fylfot|Fylfot crosses]] on the stole.{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 1}}\n\nTwo family tombs in the chancel recesses date from this period. The Gifford tomb on the south side (\"Gyfford\";{{sfn|Pevsner, p. 188}} \"Giffard\"{{sfn|British History Online}}) (1563) has the inscription: \"Hereunder lyeth the body of John Gyfford Esquyer heyre aparant of Sir Wyll[ia]m Gyfford Knyght who had to wyfe Elizabethe one of the dawghters of Sir George Throkmarton Knight and had by her issue fyve sonnys and viii dawghters and so changyd this mortall lyfe the fyrst day of May in the yere of our Lorde God 1563 on whose soule Jesu have m'cy\". The Paulet tomb on the north (1558) is to Sir George Paulet (d. 1532), a commissioner to the Dissolution{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 5}} and the younger brother of [[William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester]].{{sfn|British History Online}} Many of the inscriptions on this tomb have been erased, some deliberately.{{sfn|British History Online}}\n[[File:All Saints Crondall tower perspective correction.jpg|thumb|right|200px|17th-century tower from west, showing two timber connecting galleries]]\n\n===17th\u201318th century===\nIn 1643 [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] soldiers seized the church under Colonel Birch, CIO to Major-General Sir William Waller.{{sfn|L.C}} The building was soon heavily defended with entrenchments, and the church was further defaced.{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 2}} In subsequent years numerous sightings of the ghosts of Parliamentarian soldiers in the church's graveyard were reported,{{sfn|Scanlan}} particularly of a mounted trooper who is said to disappear through a doorway having ridden up the avenue of limes.{{sfn|L.C}}\n\nA new bell frame was placed in the Norman tower in 1642, two additional bells were added and the roof covered with 1,200 lbs of lead.{{sfn|CRSBI}} By 1657 there was sufficient concern about the stability of the Norman tower following this work that it was decided to bring it down and a new tower of four stages, detached from the church itself and modelled on the tower of St Matthews, Battersea, was built in its place in 1659.{{sfn|British History Online}} This work, which cost \u00a3428,{{sfn|Pevsner, p. 187}} took 32 men, 110,000 bricks and 62 loads of sand,{{sfn|Parish Office, p. 4}} and the old church was connected to the new tower by two timber galleries, \"as if part of a Shakespearean theatre\".{{sfn|Jenkins, p. 245}} The tower \u2013 a \"proud tower\", according to Betjeman{{sfn|Betjeman, p. 242}} \u2013 has a number of arched doorways and windows, and is capped by four octagonal pinnacles on the belfry.

Swamp buffaloes have a grey skin at birth, but become slate blue later. [[Albinism|Albinoids]] are present in some populations. River buffaloes have comparatively longer faces, smaller girths, and bigger limbs than swamp buffaloes. Their dorsal ridges extend further back and taper off more gradually. Their horns grow downward and backward, then curve upward in a spiral. Swamp buffaloes are heavy-bodied and stockily built; the body is short and the belly large. The forehead is flat, the eyes prominent, the face short, and the [[snout|muzzle]] wide. The neck is comparatively long, and the [[withers]] and [[Rump (animal)|croup]] are prominent. A dorsal ridge extends backward and ends abruptly just before the end of the chest. Their horns grow outward, and curve in a semicircle, but always remain more or less on the plane of the forehead. The tail is short, reaching only to the [[Hock (anatomy)|hock]]s. Height at the withers is {{convert|129|-|133|cm|in|abbr=on}} for males, and {{convert|120|-|127|cm|in|abbr=on}} for females.

Swamp buffaloes prefer to [[Wallowing in animals|wallow]] in mudholes which they make with their horns. During wallowing, they acquire a thick coating of mud.<ref name= Cockrill1977/> Both are well-adapted to a hot and humid climate with temperatures ranging from {{convert|0|C|F|abbr=on}} in the winter to {{convert|30|C|F|abbr=on}} and greater in the summer. Water availability is important in hot climates, since they need wallows, rivers, or splashing water to assist in [[thermoregulation]]. Some water buffalo [[breed]]s are adapted to [[Saline water|saline]] seaside shores and [[Soil salinity|saline sandy terrain]].<ref name=Borghese2005/>\n\n===Diet===\nWater buffaloes thrive on many [[aquatic plant]]s. During floods, they will graze submerged, raising their heads above the water and carrying quantities of edible plants. Water buffaloes eat [[Reed (plant)|reeds]], ''[[Arundo donax]]'', a kind of ''[[Cyperaceae]]'', ''[[Eichhornia crassipes]]'', and ''[[Juncaceae]]''. Some of these plants are of great value to local peoples.  Others, such as ''E. crassipes'', are a major problem in some tropical valleys and by eating them, the water buffaloes may help to keep waterways clear.\n\nGreen fodders are used widely for intensive milk production and for fattening. Many fodder crops are conserved as hay, chaffed, or pulped. Fodders include [[alfalfa]], the leaves, stems or trimmings of [[banana]], [[cassava]], [[Mangelwurzel]], [[esparto]], ''[[Leucaena leucocephala]]'' and [[kenaf]], [[maize]], [[oat]]s, ''[[Pandanus]]'', [[peanut]], [[sorghum]], [[soybean]], [[sugarcane]], [[bagasse]], and [[turnip]]s. [[Citrus]] pulp and [[pineapple]] wastes have been fed safely to buffalo. In Egypt, whole sun-dried [[Date palm#Dates|dates]] are fed to milk buffalo up to 25% of the standard feed mixture.<ref name= Cockrill1977/>\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Water buffalo calf, India.jpg|thumb|A water buffalo calf in [[India]]]]\n\nSwamp buffaloes generally become [[Reproduction|reproductive]] at an older age than river breeds. Young males in Egypt, India, and Pakistan are first mated at about 3.0\u20133.5 years of age, but in Italy they may be used as early as 2 years of age. Successful mating behaviour may continue until the animal is 12 years or even older. A good river buffalo male can impregnate 100 females in a year. A strong seasonal influence on [[mating]] occurs. Heat stress reduces [[libido]].<ref name= Cockrill1977/>\n\nAlthough water buffaloes are polyoestrous, their reproductive efficiency shows wide variation throughout the year. Water buffalo cows exhibit a distinct seasonal change in displaying [[oestrus]], [[Conception (biology)|conception]] rate, and [[Calf (animal)|calving]] rate.<ref name=Barile2005>Barile, V. L.

[[Gestation]] lasts from 281\u2013334 days, but most reports give a range between 300 and 320 days. Swamp buffaloes carry their calves for one or two weeks longer than river buffaloes.

In 1886, a few milking types were brought from India to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. They have been the main grazing animals on the subcoastal plains and river basins between Darwin and [[Arnhem Land]] since the 1880s.

Water buffaloes also occur in the [[Top End]]. As a result, they were hunted in the Top End from 1885 until 1980. The commencement of the [[brucellosis]] and [[tuberculosis]] campaign (BTEC) resulted in a huge culling program to reduce water buffalo herds to a fraction of the numbers that were reached in the 1980s. The BTEC was finished when the Northern Territory was declared free of the disease in 1997. Numbers dropped dramatically as a result of the campaign, but have since recovered to an estimated 150,000 animals across northern Australia in 2008.<ref>[http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/b4a187ba-7a72-4ed2-ab06-7a8b8a1b87a0/files/buffalo.pdf The feral water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis)].

Most of them are kept by people who work on small farms in family units. Their water buffaloes live in close association with them, and are often their greatest [[capital asset]]. The women and girls in India generally look after the milking buffaloes, while the men and boys are concerned with the working animals. Throughout Asia, they are commonly tended by children who are often seen leading or riding their charges to wallows. Water buffaloes are the ideal animals for work in the deep mud of [[paddy field]]s because of their large hooves and flexible foot joints. They are often referred to as \"the living tractor of the East\". It probably is possible to plow deeper with water buffaloes than with either oxen or horses. They are the most efficient and economical means of cultivation of small fields. In most rice-producing countries, they are used for threshing and for transporting the [[Sheaf (agriculture)|sheaves]] during the rice harvest. They provide power for oilseed mills, sugarcane presses, and devices for raising water. They are widely used as [[pack animal]]s and, in India and Pakistan, for heavy haulage also.

About 300 water buffaloes race in groups of five or six, spurred on by bareback jockeys wielding wooden sticks, as hundreds of spectators cheer. The water buffalo has always played an important role in agriculture in Thailand. For the farmers of Chon Buri Province, near Bangkok, it is an important annual festival, beginning in mid-October. It is also a celebration among rice farmers before the rice harvest. At dawn, farmers walk their water buffaloes through the surrounding rice fields, splashing them with water to keep them cool before leading them to the race field. This amazing festival started over 100 years ago, when two men arguing about whose water buffalo was the fastest ended up having a race between them. That is how it became a tradition and gradually a social event for farmers, who gathered from around the country in Chonburi to trade their goods. The festival also helps a great deal in preserving the numbers of water buffaloes, which have been dwindling at quite an alarming rate in other regions. Modern machinery is rapidly replacing water buffaloes in Thai agriculture. With most of the farm work mechanized, the water buffalo-racing tradition has continued. Racing buffalo are raised just to race; they do not work at all. The few farm buffalo which still do work are much bigger than the racers because of the strenuous work they perform. Farm water buffaloes are in the \"Buffalo Beauty Pageant\", a Miss Farmer beauty contest and a comedic water buffalo costume contest, etc.. This festival perfectly exemplifies a favored Thai attitude to life \u2014 \"sanuk,\" meaning fun.\n* The [[Babulang]] water buffalo racing festival in [[Sarawak]], Malaysia, is the largest or grandest of the many rituals, ceremonies and festivals of the traditional [[Bisaya (Borneo)|Bisaya]] community of Limbang, Sarawak.

There was a time when many village cattle which provide rural Cambodians with muscle power to plow their fields and transport agricultural products died from an unknown disease. The villagers prayed to a spirit to help save their animals from the disease and promised to show their gratitude by holding a water buffalo race each year on the last day of the \"P'chum Ben\" festival, as it is known in Cambodia. The race draws hundreds of spectators, who come to see riders and their animals charge down the racing field, the racers bouncing up and down on the backs of their water buffaloes, whose horns were draped with colorful cloth.\n* [[Buffalo racing in Kerala]] is similar to the [[Kambala]] races.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/02/27/stories/2004022702250500.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Bull race held at Kaakkoor peacefully | date=27 February 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/02/27/stories/2004022702240500.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title='Maramadi' winners | date=27 February 2004}}</ref>\n\n===Religious festival===\n* The Pulilan Carabao Festival is held annually every 14 and 15 May in the [[Philippines|Philippine]] town of [[Pulilan]] in honor of [[Isidore the Laborer|St. Isidore the Laborer]], the patron saint of farmers.

Swamp buffaloes have a grey skin at birth, but become slate blue later. [[Albinism|Albinoids]] are present in some populations. River buffaloes have comparatively longer faces, smaller girths, and bigger limbs than swamp buffaloes. Their dorsal ridges extend further back and taper off more gradually. Their horns grow downward and backward, then curve upward in a spiral. Swamp buffaloes are heavy-bodied and stockily built; the body is short and the belly large. The forehead is flat, the eyes prominent, the face short, and the [[snout|muzzle]] wide. The neck is comparatively long, and the [[withers]] and [[Rump (animal)|croup]] are prominent. A dorsal ridge extends backward and ends abruptly just before the end of the chest. Their horns grow outward, and curve in a semicircle, but always remain more or less on the plane of the forehead. The tail is short, reaching only to the [[Hock (anatomy)|hock]]s. Height at the withers is {{convert|129|-|133|cm|in|abbr=on}} for males, and {{convert|120|-|127|cm|in|abbr=on}} for females. They range in weight from {{convert|300|-|550|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, but weights of over {{convert|1000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} have also been observed.<ref name=\"Cockrill1977\" />\n\n''Tedong bonga'' is a [[piebald]] water buffalo featuring a unique black and white colouration that is favoured by the [[Toraja]] of [[Sulawesi]].<ref>Priyanto, D., Suradissastra, K.

The two types do not readily interbreed, but fertile offspring can occur. Water buffalo-[[cattle]] hybrids have not been observed to occur, but the embryos of such hybrids reach maturity in laboratory experiments, albeit at lower rates than non-hybrids.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Kochhar, H.

Swamp buffaloes prefer to [[Wallowing in animals|wallow]] in mudholes which they make with their horns. During wallowing, they acquire a thick coating of mud.<ref name= Cockrill1977/> Both are well-adapted to a hot and humid climate with temperatures ranging from {{convert|0|C|F|abbr=on}} in the winter to {{convert|30|C|F|abbr=on}} and greater in the summer. Water availability is important in hot climates, since they need wallows, rivers, or splashing water to assist in [[thermoregulation]]. Some water buffalo [[breed]]s are adapted to [[Saline water|saline]] seaside shores and [[Soil salinity|saline sandy terrain]].<ref name=Borghese2005/>\n\n===Diet===\nWater buffaloes thrive on many [[aquatic plant]]s. During floods, they will graze submerged, raising their heads above the water and carrying quantities of edible plants. Water buffaloes eat [[Reed (plant)|reeds]], ''[[Arundo donax]]'', a kind of ''[[Cyperaceae]]'', ''[[Eichhornia crassipes]]'', and ''[[Juncaceae]]''. Some of these plants are of great value to local peoples.  Others, such as ''E. crassipes'', are a major problem in some tropical valleys and by eating them, the water buffaloes may help to keep waterways clear.\n\nGreen fodders are used widely for intensive milk production and for fattening. Many fodder crops are conserved as hay, chaffed, or pulped. Fodders include [[alfalfa]], the leaves, stems or trimmings of [[banana]], [[cassava]], [[Mangelwurzel]], [[esparto]], ''[[Leucaena leucocephala]]'' and [[kenaf]], [[maize]], [[oat]]s, ''[[Pandanus]]'', [[peanut]], [[sorghum]], [[soybean]], [[sugarcane]], [[bagasse]], and [[turnip]]s. [[Citrus]] pulp and [[pineapple]] wastes have been fed safely to buffalo. In Egypt, whole sun-dried [[Date palm#Dates|dates]] are fed to milk buffalo up to 25% of the standard feed mixture.<ref name= Cockrill1977/>\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Water buffalo calf, India.jpg|thumb|A water buffalo calf in [[India]]]]\n\nSwamp buffaloes generally become [[Reproduction|reproductive]] at an older age than river breeds. Young males in Egypt, India, and Pakistan are first mated at about 3.0\u20133.5 years of age, but in Italy they may be used as early as 2 years of age. Successful mating behaviour may continue until the animal is 12 years or even older. A good river buffalo male can impregnate 100 females in a year. A strong seasonal influence on [[mating]] occurs. Heat stress reduces [[libido]].<ref name= Cockrill1977/>\n\nAlthough water buffaloes are polyoestrous, their reproductive efficiency shows wide variation throughout the year. Water buffalo cows exhibit a distinct seasonal change in displaying [[oestrus]], [[Conception (biology)|conception]] rate, and [[Calf (animal)|calving]] rate.<ref name=Barile2005>Barile, V. L.

[[Gestation]] lasts from 281\u2013334 days, but most reports give a range between 300 and 320 days. Swamp buffaloes carry their calves for one or two weeks longer than river buffaloes. It is not rare to find water buffaloes that continue to work well at the age of 30, and instances of a working life of 40 years have been recorded.<ref name= Cockrill1977/>\n\n==Taxonomic history==\n[[Carl Linnaeus]] first described the genus ''[[Bos]]'' and the water buffalo under the [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] ''Bos bubalis'' in 1758; the species was known to occur in Asia and was held as a domestic form in Italy.<ref>{{cite book |author=Linnaeus, C. |year=1758 |chapter=Bos Bubalis |title=Systema natur\u00e6 per regna tria natur\u00e6, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis |volume=v.1 |location=Holmiae |publisher=Laurentii Salvii |chapterurl=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/726975 |edition=10 |page=72}}</ref>\n[[Sir John Ellerman, 1st Baronet|Ellerman]] and [[Terence Morrison-Scott|Morrison-Scott]] treated the wild and domestic forms of the water buffalo as [[Conspecificity|conspecifics]],<ref>{{cite book |author1=Ellerman, J.R.|author2=Morrison-Scott, T.

In 1886, a few milking types were brought from India to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. They have been the main grazing animals on the subcoastal plains and river basins between Darwin and [[Arnhem Land]] since the 1880s.

Water buffaloes also occur in the [[Top End]]. As a result, they were hunted in the Top End from 1885 until 1980. The commencement of the [[brucellosis]] and [[tuberculosis]] campaign (BTEC) resulted in a huge culling program to reduce water buffalo herds to a fraction of the numbers that were reached in the 1980s. The BTEC was finished when the Northern Territory was declared free of the disease in 1997. Numbers dropped dramatically as a result of the campaign, but have since recovered to an estimated 150,000 animals across northern Australia in 2008.<ref>[http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/b4a187ba-7a72-4ed2-ab06-7a8b8a1b87a0/files/buffalo.pdf The feral water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis)].

Most of them are kept by people who work on small farms in family units. Their water buffaloes live in close association with them, and are often their greatest [[capital asset]]. The women and girls in India generally look after the milking buffaloes, while the men and boys are concerned with the working animals. Throughout Asia, they are commonly tended by children who are often seen leading or riding their charges to wallows. Water buffaloes are the ideal animals for work in the deep mud of [[paddy field]]s because of their large hooves and flexible foot joints. They are often referred to as \"the living tractor of the East\". It probably is possible to plow deeper with water buffaloes than with either oxen or horses. They are the most efficient and economical means of cultivation of small fields. In most rice-producing countries, they are used for threshing and for transporting the [[Sheaf (agriculture)|sheaves]] during the rice harvest. They provide power for oilseed mills, sugarcane presses, and devices for raising water. They are widely used as [[pack animal]]s and, in India and Pakistan, for heavy haulage also. In their invasions of Europe, the Turks used water buffaloes for hauling heavy battering rams. Their dung is used as a [[fertilizer]], and as a [[fuel]] when dried.<ref name= Cockrill1977/>\n\nApproximately 26 million water buffaloes are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QL|title=FAOSTAT|website=www.fao.org|access-date=25 October 2019}}</ref> Water buffaloes contribute 72 million tonnes of [[milk]] and three million tonnes of [[meat]] annually to world food, much of it in areas that are prone to nutritional imbalances.

The races are conducted by having the water buffaloes (bulls) run in long parallel slushy ditches, where they are driven by men standing on wooden planks drawn by the water buffaloes. The objectives of the race are to finish first and to raise the water to the greatest height. It is also a rural sport. Kambala races are arranged with competition as well as without competition and as a part of thanksgiving (to God) in about 50 villages of coastal Karnataka.\n* In the [[Chonburi Province]] of [[Thailand]], and in [[Pakistan]], there are annual water buffalo races.\n* The Chon Buri water buffalo racing festival, Thailand<ref>[http://www.thailand-guide.org/traditional_thai_sports/index.htm Buffalo Racing, Thailand, thailand-guide.org (p) some content provided by Tourism Authority of Thailand, Last Updated : 1 July 2007];  [http://www.thailandlife.com/2001-2004/watching-the-buffalo-racing.html Watching the Buffalo Racing, by Panrit \"Gor\" Daoruang, 14 October 2003, Thailand Life]; [http://www.thailandlife.com/buffalo.htm Running of the buffalo: Thais take their beasts of burden to the races; by: Alisa Tang, Associated Press Writer]; [http://www.urbanlowdown.com/destinations/thailand/chonburi/219.html Buffalo Racing, The lowdown by Aliwyn Cole, 1 August 2005, Urban Lowdown]; [http://www.gorsworld.com/buffaloracing_story.htm \"Running with the Buffalo\", originally published in the ''Learning Post'', a supplement of the ''Bangkok Post'']</ref> In downtown [[Chonburi (city)|Chonburi]], {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Bangkok]], at the annual water buffalo festival held in mid-October. About 300 water buffaloes race in groups of five or six, spurred on by bareback jockeys wielding wooden sticks, as hundreds of spectators cheer. The water buffalo has always played an important role in agriculture in Thailand. For the farmers of Chon Buri Province, near Bangkok, it is an important annual festival, beginning in mid-October. It is also a celebration among rice farmers before the rice harvest. At dawn, farmers walk their water buffaloes through the surrounding rice fields, splashing them with water to keep them cool before leading them to the race field. This amazing festival started over 100 years ago, when two men arguing about whose water buffalo was the fastest ended up having a race between them. That is how it became a tradition and gradually a social event for farmers, who gathered from around the country in Chonburi to trade their goods. The festival also helps a great deal in preserving the numbers of water buffaloes, which have been dwindling at quite an alarming rate in other regions. Modern machinery is rapidly replacing water buffaloes in Thai agriculture. With most of the farm work mechanized, the water buffalo-racing tradition has continued. Racing buffalo are raised just to race; they do not work at all. The few farm buffalo which still do work are much bigger than the racers because of the strenuous work they perform. Farm water buffaloes are in the \"Buffalo Beauty Pageant\", a Miss Farmer beauty contest and a comedic water buffalo costume contest, etc.. This festival perfectly exemplifies a favored Thai attitude to life \u2014 \"sanuk,\" meaning fun.\n* The [[Babulang]] water buffalo racing festival in [[Sarawak]], Malaysia, is the largest or grandest of the many rituals, ceremonies and festivals of the traditional [[Bisaya (Borneo)|Bisaya]] community of Limbang, Sarawak. Highlights are the Ratu Babulang competition and the water buffalo races, which can only be found in this town in [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]].\n* At the Vihear Suor village water buffalo racing festival, Cambodia,<ref>[http://farnham.blogspot.com/2006/09/buffalo-racing-in-cambodia.html Buffalo Racing in Cambodia, 27 September 2006]</ref> each year, people visit Buddhist temples across the country to honor their deceased loved ones during a 15-day period commonly known as the [[Festival of the Dead]], but in Vihear Suor village, about {{convert|22|mi|km}} northeast of Cambodia, citizens each year wrap up the festival with a water buffalo race to entertain visitors and honour a pledge made hundreds of years ago. There was a time when many village cattle which provide rural Cambodians with muscle power to plow their fields and transport agricultural products died from an unknown disease. The villagers prayed to a spirit to help save their animals from the disease and promised to show their gratitude by holding a water buffalo race each year on the last day of the \"P'chum Ben\" festival, as it is known in Cambodia. The race draws hundreds of spectators, who come to see riders and their animals charge down the racing field, the racers bouncing up and down on the backs of their water buffaloes, whose horns were draped with colorful cloth.\n* [[Buffalo racing in Kerala]] is similar to the [[Kambala]] races.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/02/27/stories/2004022702250500.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Bull race held at Kaakkoor peacefully | date=27 February 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/02/27/stories/2004022702240500.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title='Maramadi' winners | date=27 February 2004}}</ref>\n\n===Religious festival===\n* The Pulilan Carabao Festival is held annually every 14 and 15 May in the [[Philippines|Philippine]] town of [[Pulilan]] in honor of [[Isidore the Laborer|St. Isidore the Laborer]], the patron saint of farmers.
