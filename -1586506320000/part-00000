In 1898 he converted to [[Unitarianism]]. He moved to Tokyo the following year and was accepted into the First Higher School in 1900. He was accepted into the Department of Literature of [[Tokyo Imperial University]] in 1903. While in Tokyo, he became friends with [[Ueda Bin]], who suggested his nickname. He graduated in 1906, and after returning briefly to Tottori to get married, moved into rooms provided by [[Yosano Tekkan]] and [[Yosano Akiko]] in Kojimachi, Tokyo where he taught as an English language instructor at a women\u2019s college until 1909. This was also the start of his association with women\u2019s literature, and his literary circle included [[Okamoto Kanoko]], [[Yamakawa Kikue]] and [[Hiratsuka Raicho]].\n\nIn 1909, Ikuta began his translation of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]\u2019s ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' into Japanese, which was completed in 1911. The same year, he also assisted Hiratsuka in the publication of her [[literary magazine]] [[Bluestocking (magazine)|''Bluestocking'']]. He continued to work on translation of Nietzsche from 1916 through 1929, eventually translating all of Nietzsche\u2019s works into Japanese. he also translated [[Homer]]\u2019s ''[[Odyssey]]'' in 1922.\n\nAlso around this time, he began a correspondence with the [[socialism|socialist]] [[Toshihiko Sakai]] and the [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[Sakae \u014csugi]]. This led to an interest in the works of [[Karl Marx]], and he translated [[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|''Das Kapital'']] into Japanese in 1919. However, his flirtation with Marxism was short-lived, and he had distanced himself from Marxist ideals by 1923. His interest in anarchism lasted longer, and maintained a correspondence with [[Takamure Itsue]] for many years. He translated [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]\u2019s ''[[Divine comedy]]'' in 1924.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1930 Ikuta moved to [[Yuigahama]] in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]. At some point before this time, he contracted [[Leprosy|Hansen\u2019s Disease]]. he left Kamakura before the physical effects of the disease became apparent, and lived in [[Shibuya]], Tokyo until his death in 1936.
