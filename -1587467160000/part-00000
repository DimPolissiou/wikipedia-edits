Several Iron Age cultures flourished from around 900 AD, including the [[Toutswemogala Hill]] Iron Age settlement. The Toutswe were based in the eastern region of what is now Botswana, relying on [[Tswana cattle]] breed held in kraals as their source of wealth. The arrival of the ancestors of the Tswana-speakers who came to control the region (from the [[Vaal River]] to Botswana) has yet to be dated precisely although AD 600 seems to be a consensus estimate. This massive cattle-raising complex prospered until 1300 AD or so. All these various peoples were connected to trade routes that ran via the Limpopo River to the Indian Ocean, and trade goods from Asia such as beads made their way to Botswana most likely in exchange for ivory, gold and rhinoceros horn. Members of the Bakwena, a chieftaincy under a legendary leader named Kgabo II, made their way into the southern Kalahari by AD 1500, at the latest, and his people drove the Bakgalagadi inhabitants west into the desert. Over the years, several offshoots of the Bakwena moved into adjoining territories. The Bangwaketse occupied areas to the west, while the Bangwato moved northeast into formerly Bakalanga areas. Not long afterwards, a Bangwato offshoot known as the Batawana migrated into the Okavango Delta, probably in the 1790s. The first written records relating to modern-day Botswana appear in 1824. What these records show is that the Bangwaketse had become the predominant power in the region. Under the rule of Makaba II, the Bangwaketse kept vast herds of cattle in well-protected desert areas, and used their military prowess to raid their neighbours. Other chiefdoms in the area, by this time, had capitals of 10,000 or so and were fairly prosperous. One of these famous capitals was Kaditshwene which was the cultural capital of the Bahurutshe people, one of the principal Tswana tribes and a centre of manufacturing and trading, it had been founded in the late 1400s on the site of iron and copper ore deposits. This equilibrium came to end during the Mfecane period, 1823-1843, when a succession of invading peoples from South Africa entered the country. Although the Bangwaketse were able to defeat the invading Bakololo (Sotho-Tswana speaking Clan) in 1826, over time all the major chiefdoms in Botswana were attacked, weakened, and impoverished. The Bakololo and amaNdebele raided repeatedly, and took large numbers of cattle from the Batswana\u2014most of whom were driven into the desert or sanctuary areas such as hilltops and caves. Only after 1843, when the Amandebele moved into western Zimbabwe, did this threat subside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iexplore.com/articles/travel-guides/africa/botswana/history-and-culture|title=Botswana \u2014 History and Culture|website=www.iexplore.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Botswana.html|title=Culture of Botswana - history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|website=www.everyculture.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref>\n[[File:Pre-colonial indigenous South African rondavel.png|thumb|Homestead in the ancient City of [[Kaditshwene]]|alt=|left]]\nAccording to all historical narratives to date, [[Barotseland]], or rather the Luyi state or nation, was invaded sometime between 1820 and 1840 by a branch of Sotho-Tswana peoples that the Luyi originally referred to as the Akubu,  later known as the [[Makololo]] led by their warrior charismatic leader, Sibituane a wise military strategist, occupying it and imposing their will for over thirty years, until they were overthrown in 1864. The Makololo were in fact the [[Bafokeng]] Basotho(Mixture of Sotho and Tswana) people that moved from the then Orange Free State area through modern day Botswana upnorth to the present day southern Zambia. From the 1820s to the 1860s, the name Makololo inspired a combination of fear, horror and reverence amongst peoples of the Kalahari between the Orange and Zambezi Rivers. The name Makololo only came about during the long migration north. One version has it that the name came about after Sibituane took a wife named Setlutlu of the Batlokoa (Tswana Clan), who he had previously awarded to Lechae, one of his young commanders but who he was particularly enamoured with himself. Sibituane was renowned for his military capabilities and his leadership qualities. The very fact of so many victories for Sibituane over peoples who would have strongly resisted the transit of strangers through their lands suggests remarkable abilities. This led to considerable respect for Sibituane and the Makololo system of rule. In truth it was no contest and after a few battles the Lozi forces were completely routed although total subjugation of Barotseland took around five years to complete. Sibituane made his capital at Naliele but moved south again to Linyanti (present day Sangwali) in Caprivi where he met Livingstone and Oswell in 1851.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1080/00020185608706984|title = Sebetwane and the Ma ''Kololo''|journal = African Studies|volume = 15|issue = 2|pages = 49\u201374|year = 1956|last1 = Smith|first1 = Edwin W.}}</ref><ref>https://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?aid=78500&dir=2018/november/19</ref><ref>https://www.tothevictoriafalls.com/vfpages/people/makololo.html</ref>\n<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271812285_In_Search_of_Kaditshwene</ref>\n\n===Batswana\u2013Boer Wars===\n[[File:Sechele Gustav Fritsch 1865.jpg|thumb|An 1865 Portrait of Kgosi [[Sechele I]] in Ntsweng Bechuanaland]]\n\nDuring the 1840s and 1850s trade with Cape Colony-based merchants opened up and enabled the Batswana chiefdoms to rebuild. The Bakwena, Bangwaketse, Bangwato and Batawana cooperated to control the lucrative ivory trade, and then used the proceeds to import horses and guns, which in turn enabled them to establish control over what is now Botswana. This process was largely complete by 1880, and thus the Bushmen, the Bakalanga, the Bakgalagadi, the [[Tswapong people|Batswapong]] and other current minorities were subjugated by the Batswana. Following the Great Trek, Afrikaners from the Cape Colony established themselves on the borders of Botswana in the Transvaal. In 1852 a coalition of Tswana chiefdoms led by Sechele I resisted Afrikaner incursions which culminated with the pivotal showdown of the [[Battle of Dimawe]] fought with artillery and long range rifles as well as musket fire. Although it was the Boer Commando led by the Boer Commandant-General [[Pieter Scholtz]] and [[Paul Kruger]], as an officer leading the Boer advance who started the offensive, it was they who ended up on the retreat followed by Batswana's retaliatory attacks into the then [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]'s Marique district in which Boer settlements, villages and farms were scotched. After about eight years of intermittent tensions and hostilities, eventually came to a peace agreement in Potchefstroom in 1860. From that point on, the modern-day border between South Africa and Botswana was agreed on, and the Afrikaners and Batswana traded and worked together peacefully.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramsay|first=Jeff|date=1991-01-01|title=The Batswana-Boer War of 1852-53: how the Batswana achieved victory|url=https://journals.co.za/content/botnotes/23/1/AJA052550590_916|journal=Botswana Notes & Records|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|issn=0525-5090}}</ref>\n\n===Battle of Khutiyabasadi===\n\nThe Batawana's (Tswana tribe/clan) fight against invading Ndebele of 1884. When the amaNdebele arrived at Toteng, they thus found the village abandoned. But, as they settled down to enjoy their bloodless conquest, about seventy mounted Batawana under Kgosi Moremi's personal command appeared, all armed with breech-loading rifles. In classic commando style the cavalry began to harass the much larger enemy force with lethal hit and run volleys. Meanwhile, another group of traditionally armed subjects of the Kgosi also made their presence known.\n\nAt this point the amaNdebele commander, Lotshe, took the bait dividing his army into two groups. One party pursued Moremi's small force, while the other fruitlessly tried to catch up to what they believed was the main body of Batawana.\n\nAs the invaders generally lacked guns, as well as horses, Moremi continued to harass his pursuers, inflicting significant casualties while remaining unscathed.\n\nThe primary mission of Moremi's men was not, however, to inflict losses on the enemy so much as to ensnare them into a well designed trap. His force thus gradually retreated northward towards Khutiyabasadi, drawing the amaNdebele to where the main body of defenders were already well entrenched.\n\nAs they approached the swamp area south Khutiyabasadi, Lotshe struggled to reunite his men, perhaps sensing that they were approaching a showdown. But, instead, Moremi's Batawana, now joined by Qhunkunyane's Wayeyi drew the amaNdebele still deeper into the swamps.\n[[File:Een mes met schede, Tswana or Kora, RP-T-1914-17-92.jpg|thumb|Graduation daggers that were given to Tswana Fighting Regiments]]\nIn this area of poor visibility, due to the thick tall reeds, the Batawana and Wayeyi were able to employ additional tricks to lure the invaders towards their ultimate doom. At one point a calf and its mother were tied to separate trees to make Lotshe's men think that they were finally catching up to their main prize, the elusive Batawana cattle. As they pressed forward the amaNdebele were further unnerved by additional hit and run attacks and sniping by small bands of Batawana marksmen. Certainly they could not have been comfortable in the unfamiliar Okavango environment.\n\nIt was at Kuthiyabasadi that the defenders' trap was finally sprung. At the time, the place was an island dominated by high reeds and surrounded to the west by deep water. In the reeds, three well armed Batawana regiments, joined by local Wayeyi, waited patiently. There they had built a small wooden platform, upon which several men could be seen from across the channel, as well tunnels and entrenchments for concealment. The amaNdebele were drawn to the spot by the appearance of Batawana cavalry who crossed the channel to the island in their sight. In addition, cattle were placed on a small islet adjacent to Kuthiyabasadi, while a group of soldiers now made themselves visible by standing up on the wooden platform. Also at the location was a papyrus bridge that had been purposely weakened at crucial spots. Surveying the scene, Lotshe ordered his men to charge across the bridge over what he presumably thought was no more than a small stream. As planned, the bridge collapsed when full of amaNdebele, who were thus unexpectedly thrown into a deep water channel. Few if any would have known how to swim.\n\nAdditional waves of amaNdebele found themselves pinned down by their charging compatriots along the river bank, which was too deep for them to easily ford. With the enemy thus in disarray, the signal was given for the main body of defenders to emerge from their tunnels and trenches. A barrage of bullets cut through Lotshe's lines from three sides, quickly turning the battle into a one-sided massacre. It is said that after the main firing had ceased, the Wayeyi used their mekoro to further attack the survivors trapped in the river, hitting them on the head with their oars. In this way, many more were drowned. By the time the fighting was over, the blood is reported to have turned the water along the course of the river black. While the total number of casualties at Khutiyabasadi cannot be precisely known, observers in Bulawayo at the time confirm that over 2,500 men had left on Lotshe's expedition and less than 500 returned. While the bulk of the amaNdebele losses are believed to have occurred in and around Khutiyabasadi itself, survivors of the battle were also killed while being mercilessly pursued by the Batawana cavalry. Moremi was clearly determined to send a strong message to Lobengula that his regiments were no match. Still others died of exhaustion and hunger while trying to make their way home across the dry plains south of Chobe; the somewhat more hospitable route through Gammangwato having been blocked by Khama. While the battle at Khutiyabasadi was a great victory for the Batawana and defeat for the amaNdebele, for the Wayeyi of the region the outcome is said to have been a mixed blessing. While they had shared in the victory over the hated Amandebele, one of its consequences was a tightening of Batawana authority in the area over them, as Moremi settled for a period at nearby Nokaneng.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?aid=72905&dir=2017/november/06|title=Mmegi Blogs :: The Guns Of Khutiyabasadi (II)|last=Ramsay|first=Jeff|work=Mmegi Blogs|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref>\n\n=== First Matabele War ===\n\nThe [[First Matabele War]] was fought between 1893 and 1894 in modern-day Zimbabwe. The British South Africa Company had no more than 750 troops in the British South Africa Company's Police, with an undetermined number of possible colonial volunteers and an additional 700 Tswana (Bechuana) allies who marched on Bulawayo from the south commandeered by [[Khama III]], the most influential of the Batswana chiefs, and a staunch ally of the British. The Salisbury and Fort Victoria columns marched into Bulawayo on 4 November 1893. The Imperial column from Bechuanaland was nowhere to be seen. They had set march on 18 October heading north for Bulawayo and had a minor skirmish with the Matabele near Mphoengs on 2 November. They finally reached Bulawayo on 15 November, a delay which probably saved the Chartered Company's then newly occupied territory being annexed to the imperial [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsap.org/hiscampaigns.html|title=BSAP History: Campaigns|website=www.bsap.org|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Bophuthatswana ===\n[[File:Flag of Bophuthatswana (1972\u20131994).svg|thumb|150px|Flag of Bophuthatswana]]\n\nThe [[Bophuthatswana]] Territorial Authority was created in 1961, and in June 1972 Bophuthatswana was declared a self-governing state. On 6 December 1977 this 'homeland' was granted independence by the South African government. Bophuthatswana's capital city was Mmabatho and 99% of its population was Tswana speaking. In March 1994, Bophuthatswana was placed under the control of two administrators, Tjaart van der Walt and Job Mokgoro. The small, widespread pieces of land were reincorporated into South Africa on 27 April 1994. Bophuthatswana is part of the North West Province under Premier Prof Job Mokgoro. On 9 May 2018, Mahumapelo, who was Premier before Prof Mokgoro, announced that he would take leave of absence and appointed Finance MEC Wendy Nelson as acting premier. President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed an inter-ministerial task team to investigate violent protests in the province's capital Mahikeng and other towns through the province over a long period of time. Supra Mahumapelo officially resigned on 23 May 2018.\n\n==Dynasties and tribes==\n\n===Botswana===\nThe republic of Botswana (formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland) is named for the Tswana people. The country's eight major tribes/Clans speak Tswana, which is also called Setswana. All have a traditional Paramount Chief, styled ''Kgosikgolo'', who is entitled to a seat in the [[Ntlo ya Dikgosi]] (an advisory body to the country's [[Parliament of Botswana|Parliament]]).

They are one of the largest ethnic groups in the country, and the [[Tswana language]] is one of eleven official languages in [[South Africa]]. There were over 4 million Tswana speakers in the country in 2012,<ref name=\"statssa_za\" /> with [[North West Province]] having a majority of 2,200,000 Tswana speakers. From 1948 to 1994, South African Tswana people were defined by the [[Apartheid in South Africa|Apartheid]] regime to be citizens of [[Bophuthatswana]], one of ten [[bantustan]]s set up for the purpose of defending the policy of denying black Africans citizenship in South Africa.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Batswana in South Africa\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"155\" classes=\"center\">\nFile:Royal Bafokeng Stadium, Phokeng.jpg|alt=Picture of Batswana in SA|''Royal Bafokeng Stadium owned by Bafokeng.\nFile:Mafikeng, North West, South Africa (20506154516).jpg|alt=Picture of Batswana in SA|''Mafikeng, North West, South Africa.\nFile:Kgosi Leruo Tshedkedi Molotlegi.jpg|alt=Picture of Batswana in SA|''[[King Molotlegi|Leruo Molotlegi]] of Bafokeng.\n</gallery>\n\n==Setswana food and cuisine==\nBogobe is a porridge made from sorghum or millet which can be prepared differently to make various porridges. The most popular sorghum porridge is Ting.<ref>https://www.fondazioneslowfood.com/en/ark-of-taste-slow-food/ting-ya-mabele/</ref> Bogobe jwa Logala/Sengana is a traditional Setswana dish prepared from sorghum porridge mixed/cooked with milk. [[Seswaa]] is Botswana's national dish and is often served at weddings, funerals, and other celebrations. Seswaa is a pounded or shredded meat and often served with Bogobe (Porridge). Madila is a sour cultured milk a primitive form of cheese curd prepared from cow and goat milk over a period of time until fully matured for consumption. Traditionally madila were prepared using Lekuka a leather sack or bag used in processing and storing madila. Madila is also traditionally used as relish, eaten with pap. It can also be used in popular Tswana breakfast meal, motogo, to give the soft porridge that sour and milky taste.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Setswana food and cuisine\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"155\" classes=\"center\">\nFile:Seswaa avec bogobe.jpg|alt=Picture of Tswana Food|''Seswaa and Bogobe.\nFile:Latte 020.jpg|alt=Picture of Tswana Food|''Madila sour cultured milk.\n</gallery>\n\n==Culture and attire==\nBatswana wear a cotton fabric known in Setswana as Leteishi and Sotho as [[Shweshwe]]. This fabric is often used for wedding celebrations and other traditional celebrations. In Setswana tradition mothers wear mogagolwane, a checkered small blanket during traditional baby-showers, and married women during traditional weddings are identified by it, as well as during various initiation ceremonies. Even during funerals Batswana women don mogagolwane.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Culture and attire\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"155\" classes=\"center\">\nFile:Brown shweshwe.jpg|alt=Picture of Leteitshi|''Traditional Brown Leteitshi  (shweshwe).\nFile:Blue shweshwe.jpg|alt=Picture of Leteitshi|''A blue Leteitshi.\nFile:ShweShwe.JPG|alt=Picture of Leteisthi|''Leteitshi Patterns.\n</gallery>\n\n==Music==\nTswana music is mostly vocal and performed, sometimes without drums depending on the occasion; it also makes heavy use of string instruments. Tswana folk music has instruments such as Setinkane (a Botswana version of miniature piano), Segankure/Segaba (a Botswana version of the Chinese instrument Erhu), Moropa (Meropa -plural) (a Botswana version of the many varieties of drums),and phala (a Botswana version of a whistle used mostly during celebrations, which comes in a variety of forms). Botswana cultural musical instruments are not confined only to the strings or drums. the hands are used as musical instruments too, by either clapping them together or against phathisi (goat skin turned inside out wrapped around the calf area; it is only used by men) to create music and rhythm. For the last few decades, the guitar has been celebrated as a versatile music instrument for Tswana music as it offers a variety in string which the Segaba instrument does not have. Other notable modern Tswana music is Tswana Rap known as [[Motswako]].<ref>https://mg.co.za/article/2017-10-27-00-heritage-and-choice-collide-in-setswana-musical?platform=hootsuite</ref>\n\n==Visual arts==\nBatswana are noted for their skill at crafting baskets from Mokola Palm and local dyes. The baskets are generally woven into three types: large, lidded baskets used for storage, large, open baskets for carrying objects on the head or for winnowing threshed grain, and smaller plates for winnowing pounded grain. Potters made clay pots for storing water, traditional beer and also for cooking and hardly for commercial use. Craft makers made wooden crafts and they made traditional cooking utensils such as leso and lehetlho, traditional wooden chairs and drums among others.<ref>http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?aid=63447&dir=2016/september/28</ref>\n\n\n==Tswana astronomy==\n[[File:Milky Way Galaxy.jpg|thumb|Milky Way Galaxy]]\nAstronomy is an old age tradition in Africa. As with all other cultures, various ethnic groups developed their own interpretations of the solar system.  Using their natural instrument the eye, Batswana have observed, commented on and named celestial objects of interest to them. There are more telling and specific names that relate to unique stellar patterns and their seasonal appearance e.g. Selemela, Naka, Thutlwa, and Dikolojwane. According to Tswana culture, the stars of Orion's sword were \"dintsa le Dikolobe\", three dogs chasing three pigs of Orion's belt. The Milky Way was viewed by the Tswana as Molalatladi, the place where lightning rests. It was further believed that this place of rest also kept the sky from collapsing and showed the movement of time.  Some even claimed that it turned the sun to the east, in a way to explaining the rising of the sun. It was also believed that it was a supernatural footpath across the sky along which ancestors' spirits walked. The moon (Ngwedi) is said to represent a woman; it brings forth light but not as scorching as the Sun (Letsatsi) and its light is associated with happiness. Venus is called Mphatlalatsana (the brilliant and blinding one) by Batswana & Kopadilalelo (seeker of evening meals).  The southern African calendar was made up of 354 days, (12 x 29.5 day lunar month). This was 11 days shorter than the solar year, an issue which could not be ignored.  The solution was to add an additional month, when necessary, to \"catch up\".  Some years were 12 months long, others 13. After the arrival of Europeans and the introduction of the Gregorian calendar, it was noted that the Batswana people had started forgetting the name of the 13th month. In contrast to Europe, where the new year is in the middle of winter, in southern Africa it logically started in September or October at the start of the new growing season.

Several Iron Age cultures flourished from around 900 AD, including the [[Toutswemogala Hill]] Iron Age settlement. The Toutswe were based in the eastern region of what is now Botswana, relying on [[Tswana cattle]] breed held in kraals as their source of wealth. The arrival of the ancestors of the Tswana-speakers who came to control the region (from the [[Vaal River]] to Botswana) has yet to be dated precisely although AD 600 seems to be a consensus estimate. This massive cattle-raising complex prospered until 1300 AD or so. All these various peoples were connected to trade routes that ran via the Limpopo River to the Indian Ocean, and trade goods from Asia such as beads made their way to Botswana most likely in exchange for ivory, gold and rhinoceros horn. Members of the Bakwena, a chieftaincy under a legendary leader named Kgabo II, made their way into the southern Kalahari by AD 1500, at the latest, and his people drove the Bakgalagadi inhabitants west into the desert. Over the years, several offshoots of the Bakwena moved into adjoining territories. The Bangwaketse occupied areas to the west, while the Bangwato moved northeast into formerly Bakalanga areas. Not long afterwards, a Bangwato offshoot known as the Batawana migrated into the Okavango Delta, probably in the 1790s. The first written records relating to modern-day Botswana appear in 1824. What these records show is that the Bangwaketse had become the predominant power in the region. Under the rule of Makaba II, the Bangwaketse kept vast herds of cattle in well-protected desert areas, and used their military prowess to raid their neighbours. Other chiefdoms in the area, by this time, had capitals of 10,000 or so and were fairly prosperous. One of these famous capitals was Kaditshwene which was the cultural capital of the Bahurutshe people, one of the principal Tswana tribes and a centre of manufacturing and trading, it had been founded in the late 1400s on the site of iron and copper ore deposits. This equilibrium came to end during the Mfecane period, 1823-1843, when a succession of invading peoples from South Africa entered the country. Although the Bangwaketse were able to defeat the invading Bakololo (Sotho-Tswana speaking Clan) in 1826, over time all the major chiefdoms in Botswana were attacked, weakened, and impoverished. The Bakololo and amaNdebele raided repeatedly, and took large numbers of cattle from the Batswana\u2014most of whom were driven into the desert or sanctuary areas such as hilltops and caves. Only after 1843, when the Amandebele moved into western Zimbabwe, did this threat subside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iexplore.com/articles/travel-guides/africa/botswana/history-and-culture|title=Botswana \u2014 History and Culture|website=www.iexplore.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Botswana.html|title=Culture of Botswana - history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|website=www.everyculture.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref>\n[[File:Pre-colonial indigenous South African rondavel.png|thumb|Homestead in the ancient City of [[Kaditshwene]]|alt=|left]]\nAccording to all historical narratives to date, [[Barotseland]], or rather the Luyi state or nation, was invaded sometime between 1820 and 1840 by a branch of Sotho-Tswana peoples that the Luyi originally referred to as the Akubu,  later known as the [[Makololo]] led by their warrior charismatic leader, Sibituane a wise military strategist, occupying it and imposing their will for over thirty years, until they were overthrown in 1864. The Makololo were in fact the [[Bafokeng]] Basotho(Mixture of Sotho and Tswana) people that moved from the then Orange Free State area through modern day Botswana upnorth to the present day southern Zambia. From the 1820s to the 1860s, the name Makololo inspired a combination of fear, horror and reverence amongst peoples of the Kalahari between the Orange and Zambezi Rivers. The name Makololo only came about during the long migration north. One version has it that the name came about after Sibituane took a wife named Setlutlu of the Batlokoa (Tswana Clan), who he had previously awarded to Lechae, one of his young commanders but who he was particularly enamoured with himself. Sibituane was renowned for his military capabilities and his leadership qualities. The very fact of so many victories for Sibituane over peoples who would have strongly resisted the transit of strangers through their lands suggests remarkable abilities. This led to considerable respect for Sibituane and the Makololo system of rule. In truth it was no contest and after a few battles the Lozi forces were completely routed although total subjugation of Barotseland took around five years to complete. Sibituane made his capital at Naliele but moved south again to Linyanti (present day Sangwali) in Caprivi where he met Livingstone and Oswell in 1851.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1080/00020185608706984|title = Sebetwane and the Ma ''Kololo''|journal = African Studies|volume = 15|issue = 2|pages = 49\u201374|year = 1956|last1 = Smith|first1 = Edwin W.}}</ref><ref>https://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?aid=78500&dir=2018/november/19</ref><ref>https://www.tothevictoriafalls.com/vfpages/people/makololo.html</ref>\n<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271812285_In_Search_of_Kaditshwene</ref>\n\n===Batswana\u2013Boer Wars===\n[[File:Sechele Gustav Fritsch 1865.jpg|thumb|An 1865 Portrait of Kgosi [[Sechele I]] in Ntsweng Bechuanaland]]\n\nDuring the 1840s and 1850s trade with Cape Colony-based merchants opened up and enabled the Batswana chiefdoms to rebuild. The Bakwena, Bangwaketse, Bangwato and Batawana cooperated to control the lucrative ivory trade, and then used the proceeds to import horses and guns, which in turn enabled them to establish control over what is now Botswana. This process was largely complete by 1880, and thus the Bushmen, the Bakalanga, the Bakgalagadi, the [[Tswapong people|Batswapong]] and other current minorities were subjugated by the Batswana. Following the Great Trek, Afrikaners from the Cape Colony established themselves on the borders of Botswana in the Transvaal. In 1852 a coalition of Tswana chiefdoms led by Sechele I resisted Afrikaner incursions which culminated with the pivotal showdown of the [[Battle of Dimawe]] fought with artillery and long range rifles as well as musket fire. Although it was the Boer Commando led by the Boer Commandant-General [[Pieter Scholtz]] and [[Paul Kruger]], as an officer leading the Boer advance who started the offensive, it was they who ended up on the retreat followed by Batswana's retaliatory attacks into the then [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]'s Marique district in which Boer settlements, villages and farms were scotched. After about eight years of intermittent tensions and hostilities, eventually came to a peace agreement in Potchefstroom in 1860. From that point on, the modern-day border between South Africa and Botswana was agreed on, and the Afrikaners and Batswana traded and worked together peacefully.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramsay|first=Jeff|date=1991-01-01|title=The Batswana-Boer War of 1852-53: how the Batswana achieved victory|url=https://journals.co.za/content/botnotes/23/1/AJA052550590_916|journal=Botswana Notes & Records|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|issn=0525-5090}}</ref>\n\n===Battle of Khutiyabasadi===\n\nThe Batawana's (Tswana tribe/clan) fight against invading Ndebele of 1884. When the amaNdebele arrived at Toteng, they thus found the village abandoned. But, as they settled down to enjoy their bloodless conquest, about seventy mounted Batawana under Kgosi Moremi's personal command appeared, all armed with breech-loading rifles. In classic commando style the cavalry began to harass the much larger enemy force with lethal hit and run volleys. Meanwhile, another group of traditionally armed subjects of the Kgosi also made their presence known.\n\nAt this point the amaNdebele commander, Lotshe, took the bait dividing his army into two groups. One party pursued Moremi's small force, while the other fruitlessly tried to catch up to what they believed was the main body of Batawana.\n\nAs the invaders generally lacked guns, as well as horses, Moremi continued to harass his pursuers, inflicting significant casualties while remaining unscathed.\n\nThe primary mission of Moremi's men was not, however, to inflict losses on the enemy so much as to ensnare them into a well designed trap. His force thus gradually retreated northward towards Khutiyabasadi, drawing the amaNdebele to where the main body of defenders were already well entrenched.\n\nAs they approached the swamp area south Khutiyabasadi, Lotshe struggled to reunite his men, perhaps sensing that they were approaching a showdown. But, instead, Moremi's Batawana, now joined by Qhunkunyane's Wayeyi drew the amaNdebele still deeper into the swamps.\n[[File:Een mes met schede, Tswana or Kora, RP-T-1914-17-92.jpg|thumb|Graduation daggers that were given to Tswana Fighting Regiments]]\nIn this area of poor visibility, due to the thick tall reeds, the Batawana and Wayeyi were able to employ additional tricks to lure the invaders towards their ultimate doom. At one point a calf and its mother were tied to separate trees to make Lotshe's men think that they were finally catching up to their main prize, the elusive Batawana cattle. As they pressed forward the amaNdebele were further unnerved by additional hit and run attacks and sniping by small bands of Batawana marksmen. Certainly they could not have been comfortable in the unfamiliar Okavango environment.\n\nIt was at Kuthiyabasadi that the defenders' trap was finally sprung. At the time, the place was an island dominated by high reeds and surrounded to the west by deep water. In the reeds, three well armed Batawana regiments, joined by local Wayeyi, waited patiently. There they had built a small wooden platform, upon which several men could be seen from across the channel, as well tunnels and entrenchments for concealment. The amaNdebele were drawn to the spot by the appearance of Batawana cavalry who crossed the channel to the island in their sight. In addition, cattle were placed on a small islet adjacent to Kuthiyabasadi, while a group of soldiers now made themselves visible by standing up on the wooden platform. Also at the location was a papyrus bridge that had been purposely weakened at crucial spots. Surveying the scene, Lotshe ordered his men to charge across the bridge over what he presumably thought was no more than a small stream. As planned, the bridge collapsed when full of amaNdebele, who were thus unexpectedly thrown into a deep water channel. Few if any would have known how to swim.\n\nAdditional waves of amaNdebele found themselves pinned down by their charging compatriots along the river bank, which was too deep for them to easily ford. With the enemy thus in disarray, the signal was given for the main body of defenders to emerge from their tunnels and trenches. A barrage of bullets cut through Lotshe's lines from three sides, quickly turning the battle into a one-sided massacre. It is said that after the main firing had ceased, the Wayeyi used their mekoro to further attack the survivors trapped in the river, hitting them on the head with their oars. In this way, many more were drowned. By the time the fighting was over, the blood is reported to have turned the water along the course of the river black. While the total number of casualties at Khutiyabasadi cannot be precisely known, observers in Bulawayo at the time confirm that over 2,500 men had left on Lotshe's expedition and less than 500 returned. While the bulk of the amaNdebele losses are believed to have occurred in and around Khutiyabasadi itself, survivors of the battle were also killed while being mercilessly pursued by the Batawana cavalry. Moremi was clearly determined to send a strong message to Lobengula that his regiments were no match. Still others died of exhaustion and hunger while trying to make their way home across the dry plains south of Chobe; the somewhat more hospitable route through Gammangwato having been blocked by Khama. While the battle at Khutiyabasadi was a great victory for the Batawana and defeat for the amaNdebele, for the Wayeyi of the region the outcome is said to have been a mixed blessing. While they had shared in the victory over the hated Amandebele, one of its consequences was a tightening of Batawana authority in the area over them, as Moremi settled for a period at nearby Nokaneng.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?aid=72905&dir=2017/november/06|title=Mmegi Blogs :: The Guns Of Khutiyabasadi (II)|last=Ramsay|first=Jeff|work=Mmegi Blogs|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref>\n\n=== First Matabele War ===\n\nThe [[First Matabele War]] was fought between 1893 and 1894 in modern-day Zimbabwe. The British South Africa Company had no more than 750 troops in the British South Africa Company's Police, with an undetermined number of possible colonial volunteers and an additional 700 Tswana (Bechuana) allies who marched on Bulawayo from the south commandeered by [[Khama III]], the most influential of the Batswana chiefs, and a staunch ally of the British. The Salisbury and Fort Victoria columns marched into Bulawayo on 4 November 1893. The Imperial column from Bechuanaland was nowhere to be seen. They had set march on 18 October heading north for Bulawayo and had a minor skirmish with the Matabele near Mphoengs on 2 November. They finally reached Bulawayo on 15 November, a delay which probably saved the Chartered Company's then newly occupied territory being annexed to the imperial [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsap.org/hiscampaigns.html|title=BSAP History: Campaigns|website=www.bsap.org|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Bophuthatswana ===\n[[File:Flag of Bophuthatswana (1972\u20131994).svg|thumb|150px|Flag of Bophuthatswana]]\n\nThe [[Bophuthatswana]] Territorial Authority was created in 1961, and in June 1972 Bophuthatswana was declared a self-governing state. On 6 December 1977 this 'homeland' was granted independence by the South African government. Bophuthatswana's capital city was Mmabatho and 99% of its population was Tswana speaking. In March 1994, Bophuthatswana was placed under the control of two administrators, Tjaart van der Walt and Job Mokgoro. The small, widespread pieces of land were reincorporated into South Africa on 27 April 1994. Bophuthatswana is part of the North West Province under Premier Prof Job Mokgoro. On 9 May 2018, Mahumapelo, who was Premier before Prof Mokgoro, announced that he would take leave of absence and appointed Finance MEC Wendy Nelson as acting premier. President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed an inter-ministerial task team to investigate violent protests in the province's capital Mahikeng and other towns through the province over a long period of time. Supra Mahumapelo officially resigned on 23 May 2018.\n\n==Dynasties and tribes==\n\n===Botswana===\nThe republic of Botswana (formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland) is named for the Tswana people. The country's eight major tribes/Clans speak Tswana, which is also called Setswana. All have a traditional Paramount Chief, styled ''Kgosikgolo'', who is entitled to a seat in the [[Ntlo ya Dikgosi]] (an advisory body to the country's [[Parliament of Botswana|Parliament]]). The Tswana dynasties are all related. A person who lives in Botswana is a [[Botswana|Motswana]] and the plural is Batswana.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sundaystandard.info/we-are-batswana-they-call-us-batswanan |title=We are Batswana; they call us Batswanan |date=2 December 2015 |accessdate=1 September 2017 |newspaper=Sunday Standard |department=Linguist Chair |location=Gaborone}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bc.html |title=The World Factbook |chapter=Botswana, People and Society, Nationality |publisher=CIA |location=Washington, DC |accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref> The three main branches of the Tswana tribe formed during the 17th century.

They are one of the largest ethnic groups in the country, and the [[Tswana language]] is one of eleven official languages in [[South Africa]]. There were over 4 million Tswana speakers in the country in 2012,<ref name=\"statssa_za\" /> with [[North West Province]] having a majority of 2,200,000 Tswana speakers. From 1948 to 1994, South African Tswana people were defined by the [[Apartheid in South Africa|Apartheid]] regime to be citizens of [[Bophuthatswana]], one of ten [[bantustan]]s set up for the purpose of defending the policy of denying black Africans citizenship in South Africa.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Batswana in South Africa\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"155\" classes=\"center\">\nFile:Royal Bafokeng Stadium, Phokeng.jpg|alt=Picture of Batswana in SA|''Royal Bafokeng Stadium owned by Bafokeng.\nFile:Mafikeng, North West, South Africa (20506154516).jpg|alt=Picture of Batswana in SA|''Mafikeng, North West, South Africa.\nFile:Kgosi Leruo Tshedkedi Molotlegi.jpg|alt=Picture of Batswana in SA|''King Molotlegi of Bafokeng.\n</gallery>\n\n==Setswana food and cuisine==\nBogobe is a porridge made from sorghum or millet which can be prepared differently to make various porridges. The most popular sorghum porridge is Ting.<ref>https://www.fondazioneslowfood.com/en/ark-of-taste-slow-food/ting-ya-mabele/</ref> Bogobe jwa Logala/Sengana is a traditional Setswana dish prepared from sorghum porridge mixed/cooked with milk. [[Seswaa]] is Botswana's national dish and is often served at weddings, funerals, and other celebrations. Seswaa is a pounded or shredded meat and often served with Bogobe (Porridge). Madila is a sour cultured milk a primitive form of cheese curd prepared from cow and goat milk over a period of time until fully matured for consumption. Traditionally madila were prepared using Lekuka a leather sack or bag used in processing and storing madila. Madila is also traditionally used as relish, eaten with pap. It can also be used in popular Tswana breakfast meal, motogo, to give the soft porridge that sour and milky taste.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Setswana food and cuisine\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"155\" classes=\"center\">\nFile:Seswaa avec bogobe.jpg|alt=Picture of Tswana Food|''Seswaa and Bogobe.\nFile:Latte 020.jpg|alt=Picture of Tswana Food|''Madila sour cultured milk.\n</gallery>\n\n==Culture and attire==\nBatswana wear a cotton fabric known in Setswana as Leteishi and Sotho as [[Shweshwe]]. This fabric is often used for wedding celebrations and other traditional celebrations. In Setswana tradition mothers wear mogagolwane, a checkered small blanket during traditional baby-showers, and married women during traditional weddings are identified by it, as well as during various initiation ceremonies. Even during funerals Batswana women don mogagolwane.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Culture and attire\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"155\" classes=\"center\">\nFile:Brown shweshwe.jpg|alt=Picture of Leteitshi|''Traditional Brown Leteitshi  (shweshwe).\nFile:Blue shweshwe.jpg|alt=Picture of Leteitshi|''A blue Leteitshi.\nFile:ShweShwe.JPG|alt=Picture of Leteisthi|''Leteitshi Patterns.\n</gallery>\n\n==Music==\nTswana music is mostly vocal and performed, sometimes without drums depending on the occasion; it also makes heavy use of string instruments. Tswana folk music has instruments such as Setinkane (a Botswana version of miniature piano), Segankure/Segaba (a Botswana version of the Chinese instrument Erhu), Moropa (Meropa -plural) (a Botswana version of the many varieties of drums),and phala (a Botswana version of a whistle used mostly during celebrations, which comes in a variety of forms). Botswana cultural musical instruments are not confined only to the strings or drums. the hands are used as musical instruments too, by either clapping them together or against phathisi (goat skin turned inside out wrapped around the calf area; it is only used by men) to create music and rhythm. For the last few decades, the guitar has been celebrated as a versatile music instrument for Tswana music as it offers a variety in string which the Segaba instrument does not have. Other notable modern Tswana music is Tswana Rap known as [[Motswako]].<ref>https://mg.co.za/article/2017-10-27-00-heritage-and-choice-collide-in-setswana-musical?platform=hootsuite</ref>\n\n==Visual arts==\nBatswana are noted for their skill at crafting baskets from Mokola Palm and local dyes. The baskets are generally woven into three types: large, lidded baskets used for storage, large, open baskets for carrying objects on the head or for winnowing threshed grain, and smaller plates for winnowing pounded grain. Potters made clay pots for storing water, traditional beer and also for cooking and hardly for commercial use. Craft makers made wooden crafts and they made traditional cooking utensils such as leso and lehetlho, traditional wooden chairs and drums among others.<ref>http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?aid=63447&dir=2016/september/28</ref>\n\n\n==Tswana astronomy==\n[[File:Milky Way Galaxy.jpg|thumb|Milky Way Galaxy]]\nAstronomy is an old age tradition in Africa. As with all other cultures, various ethnic groups developed their own interpretations of the solar system.  Using their natural instrument the eye, Batswana have observed, commented on and named celestial objects of interest to them. There are more telling and specific names that relate to unique stellar patterns and their seasonal appearance e.g. Selemela, Naka, Thutlwa, and Dikolojwane. According to Tswana culture, the stars of Orion's sword were \"dintsa le Dikolobe\", three dogs chasing three pigs of Orion's belt. The Milky Way was viewed by the Tswana as Molalatladi, the place where lightning rests. It was further believed that this place of rest also kept the sky from collapsing and showed the movement of time.  Some even claimed that it turned the sun to the east, in a way to explaining the rising of the sun. It was also believed that it was a supernatural footpath across the sky along which ancestors' spirits walked. The moon (Ngwedi) is said to represent a woman; it brings forth light but not as scorching as the Sun (Letsatsi) and its light is associated with happiness. Venus is called Mphatlalatsana (the brilliant and blinding one) by Batswana & Kopadilalelo (seeker of evening meals).  The southern African calendar was made up of 354 days, (12 x 29.5 day lunar month). This was 11 days shorter than the solar year, an issue which could not be ignored.  The solution was to add an additional month, when necessary, to \"catch up\".  Some years were 12 months long, others 13. After the arrival of Europeans and the introduction of the Gregorian calendar, it was noted that the Batswana people had started forgetting the name of the 13th month. In contrast to Europe, where the new year is in the middle of winter, in southern Africa it logically started in September or October at the start of the new growing season.

In 1905, the [[Sambalpur district]] was transferred to Odisha and the estates of Surguja were transferred from Bengal to Chhattisgarh.\n\nThe area constituting the new state merged into Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 1956, under the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956]] and remained a part of that state for 44 years. Prior to its becoming a part of the new state of Madhya Pradesh, the region was part of old Madhya Pradesh State, with its capital at Bhopal. Prior to that, the region was part of the [[Central Provinces and Berar]] (CP and Berar) under British rule.

The economy of Chhattisgarh recorded a growth rate of 6.7% in 2017\u201318.<ref name=\"Budget Analysis\" /> Chhattisgarh's success factors in achieving high growth rate are growth in agriculture and industrial production.\n\n=== Tea production ===\nChhattisgarh State is ranked as the 17th-largest tea-producing state in India. The districts of Jashpur and Surguja are favourable tea production areas. In Jashpur district, the first tea plantation, Brahmnishthajaya Sogara Ashram was established under the direction of Pujya Pad Gurupad. Tea production started after two years at the Sogara Ashram. A tea processing unit was established in Sogara Ashram and the unit name set as the Aghor Tea Processing Plant. The forestry department has also started a tea plantation motivated by the Sogara Ashram. In Surguja district, a tea nursery is being developed by the Margdarshan Sansthan Agriculture College in Ambikapur, Surguja.\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nAgriculture is counted as the chief economic occupation of the state. According to a government estimate, net sown area of the state is 4.828&nbsp;million hectares and the gross sown area is 5.788&nbsp;million hectares.<ref name=\"Agriculture in Chhattisgarh\">{{cite web|title=Agriculture in Chhattisgarh |url=http://cg.gov.in/development/cdevelopment.htm#irrigation |accessdate=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721155523/http://cg.gov.in/development/cdevelopment.htm |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}</ref> Horticulture and animal husbandry also engage a major share of the total population of the state.<ref>{{cite web|title=Economy of Chhattisgarh|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/economy/|accessdate=22 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507072918/http://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/economy/|archive-date=7 May 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> About 80% of the population of the state is rural and the main livelihood of the villagers is agriculture and agriculture-based small industry.\n\nThe majority of the farmers are still practising the traditional methods of cultivation, resulting in low growth rates and productivity. The farmers have to be made aware of modern technologies suitable to their holdings. Providing adequate knowledge to the farmers is essential for better implementation of the agricultural development plans and to improve productivity.<ref name=\"nhm.nic.in\">http://nhm.nic.in/ActionPlan/ActionPlan_Chhattisgarh.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nConsidering this and a very limited irrigated area, the productivity of not only rice but also other crops is low, hence the farmers are unable to obtain economic benefits from agriculture and it has remained as subsistence agriculture till now.\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Chloroxylon from India.JPG|Chloroxylon is used for pest management in organic rice cultivation in Chhattisgarh\nFile:Medicinal Rice.jpg|Medicinal rice of Chhattisgarh used as an immune booster\nFile:Aloe Farming.jpg|Aloe vera farming in Chhattisgarh\nFile:Gulbakawali Farming.jpg|Herbal farming in Chhattisgarh: Gulbakawali\nFile:Pigeonpea cultivation on Safed Musli Bed.jpg|Herbal farming in Chhattisgarh: Safed Musli with Arhar\n</gallery>\n\n==== Agricultural products ====\nThe main crops are rice, maize,<ref>Oudhia, P. (1999) Allelopathic effects of Lantana camara L. on germination of soybean. Legume Research 22(4): 273\u2013274.</ref> ''kodo-kutki'' and other small millets and pulses (''tuar''<ref>Oudhia, P.

In the mid-1990s, most of Chhattisgarh was still a monocrop belt. Only one-fourth to one-fifth of the sown area was double-cropped. When a very substantial portion of the population is dependent on agriculture, a situation where nearly 80% of a state's area is covered only by one crop, immediate attention to turn them into double crop areas is needed. Also, very few cash crops are grown in Chhattisgarh, so there is a need to diversify the agriculture produce towards oilseeds and other cash crops. Chhattisgarh is also called the \"rice bowl of central India\".<ref name=\"Agriculture in Chhattisgarh\" />\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Kodo Millet in Chhattisgarh.jpg|Kodo Millet is used as a life saving medicine in Chhattisgarh\nFile:Bastar Beer.jpg|Bastar beer prepared from Sulfi\n</gallery>\n\n==== Irrigation ====\nIn Chhattisgarh, rice, the main crop, is grown on about 77% of the net sown area. Only about 20% of the area is under irrigation; the rest depends on rain. Of the three agroclimatic zones, about 73% of the Chhattisgarh plains, 97% of the Bastar plateau and 95% of the northern hills are rainfed. The irrigated area available for double cropping is only 87,000&nbsp;ha in Chhattisgarh plains and 2300&nbsp;ha in Bastar plateau and northern hills. Due to this, the productivity of rice and other crops is low, hence the farmers are unable to obtain economic benefits from agriculture and it has remained as subsistence agriculture till now, though agriculture is the main occupation of more than 80% of the population.<ref name=\"nhm.nic.in\" />\n\nIn Chhattisgarh region, about 22% of net cropped area was under irrigation as compared to 36.5% in Madhya Pradesh in 1998\u201399, whereas the average national irrigation was about 40%. The irrigation is characterised by a high order of variability ranging from 1.6% in Bastar to 75.0% in Dhamtari. Based on an average growth trend in the irrigated area, about 0.43% additional area is brought under irrigation every year as compared to 1.89% in Madhya Pradesh and 1.0% in the country as a whole. Thus, irrigation has been growing at a very low rate in Chhattisgarh and the pace of irrigation is so slow, it would take about 122 years to reach the 75% level of net irrigated area in Chhattisgarh at the present rate of growth.<ref name=\"nhm.nic.in\" />\n\nChhattisgarh has a limited [[irrigation]] system, with dams and [[canal]]s on some rivers. Average rainfall in the state is around 1400&nbsp;mm and the entire state falls under the rice agroclimatic zone. The Large variation in the yearly rainfall directly affects the production of rice. Irrigation is the prime need of the state for its overall development and therefore the state government has given top priority to development of irrigation.<ref name=\"Agriculture in Chhattisgarh\" />\n\nA total of four major, 33 medium and 2199 minor irrigation projects have been completed and five major, nine medium and 312 minor projects are under construction, as of 31 March 2006.{{Update inline|date=August 2019|reason=These numbers are from over ten years ago. Needs updating}}\n\n=== Industrial sector ===\n\n==== Power sector ====\nChhattisgarh is one of the few states of India where the power sector is effectively developed. Based on the current production of surplus electric power, the position of the State is comfortable and profitable. The Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board (CSEB) is in a strong position to meet the electricity requirement of the state and is in good financial health. According to [[Central Electricity Authority (India)|Central Electricity Authority]] (CEA), Chhattisgarh provides electricity to several other states because of surplus production.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/chhattisgarh-is-power-surplus-state--confirms-cea-report.html|title=Chhattisgarh is power surplus state, confirms CEA report|last=Pioneer|first=The|website=The Pioneer|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref>\n\nIn Chhattisgarh, [[National Thermal Power Corporation Limited]] (|NTPC) has [[Sipat Thermal Power Station]] with a capacity of 2,980 MW at Sipat, Bilaspur; [[LARA Super Thermal Power Station]] with a nameplate capacity of 1600MW and [[Korba Super Thermal Power Station]] with a capacity of 2,600 MW at Korba, while CSEB's units have a thermal capacity of 1,780 MW and hydel capacity of 130 MW. Apart from NTPC and CSEB, there are a number of private generation units of large and small capacity. The state government has pursued a liberal policy with regard to captive generation which has resulted in a number of private companies coming up.<ref name=\"Power Sector in Chhattisgarh\">{{cite web|title=Power Sector in Chhattisgarh|url=http://cserc.nic.in/power_sector.htm|accessdate=22 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041211023325/http://www.cserc.nic.in/power_sector.htm|archive-date=11 December 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe state has a potential of 61,000 MW of additional thermal power in terms of availability of coal for more than 100 years and more than 2,500 MW hydel capacity. To use this vast potential, substantial additions to the existing generation capacity are already underway.<ref name=\"Power Sector in Chhattisgarh\" />\n\n==== Steel sector ====\nThe steel industry is one of the biggest heavy industries of Chhattisgarh. Bhilai Steel Plant, Bhilai operated by [[Steel Authority of India Limited|SAIL]], with a capacity of 5.4&nbsp;million tonnes per year, is regarded as a significant growth indicator of the state. More than 100 steel rolling mills, 90 sponge iron plants and ferro-alloy units are in Chhattisgarh. Along with Bhilai, today Raipur, Bilaspur, Korba and Raigarh have become the steel hub of Chhattisgarh. Today, Raipur has become the centre of the steel sector, the biggest market for steel in India.<ref name=\"Industries in Chhattisgarh\">{{cite web|title=Industries in Chhattisgarh|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/economy/chhattisgarh-industries.html|accessdate=22 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810083204/http://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/economy/chhattisgarh-industries.html|archive-date=10 August 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Aluminium sector ====\nThe aluminium industry of Chhattisgarh was established by Bharat Aluminium Company Limited, which has a capacity of around 600,000 tonnes each year.<ref name=\"Industries in Chhattisgarh\" />\n\n==== Natural resources ====\n\n===== Forest =====\nForests occupy 41.33% of the total area (as per the latest report by the [[Indian Forest Service]]) and the rich forest resources include wood, tendu leaves, [[honey]] and lac. Approximately 3%is under very dense forest, 25.97% is moderately dense, 12.28% is open forest and 0.09% is scrub.\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Healing Flora of Kabirdham District.jpg|Flora of Kabirdham District\nFile:Asian Luna Moth.JPG|Indian Luna Moth in Chhattisgarh Forest\nFile:Ventilago denticulata in Chhattisgarh.jpg|Ventilago in the diverse Chhattisgarh Forest\nFile:Mahua.jpg|Mahua\n</gallery>\n\n===== Mineral deposits =====\nChhattisgarh is rich in minerals. It produces 20% of the country's total cement production. It has the highest output of coal in the country with second-highest reserves. It is third in iron ore production and first in tin production. [[Limestone]], [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] and [[bauxite]] are abundant. It is the only [[tin]] ore-producing state in India. Other commercially extracted minerals include corandum, [[garnet]], [[quartz]], [[marble]], [[alexandrite]] and diamonds.\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nMaikal Hills.jpg|Maikal Hills in Chhattisgarh\nMineral wealth of Chhattisgarh.jpg|Mineral Wealth from Chandidongri, Chhattisgarh\n</gallery>\n\n===== Information and technologies =====\nIn recent years,Chhattisgarh is also receiving exposure in information technology (IT) projects and consultancy. Its government is also promoting IT and has set up a body to take care of IT solutions. The body, known as CHiPS, is providing large IT projects such as Choice, Swan, etc.\n\n===== Major companies =====\nMajor companies with a presence in the state include:\n* Metal: [[Bhilai Steel Plant]], [[Jindal Steel and Power]], [[Bharat Aluminium Company]]\n* Oil: [[Indian Oil Corporation]], [[Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited]]\n* Mining: [[National Mineral Development Corporation|NMDC]], [[South Eastern Coalfields]]\n* Power : [[NTPC Limited|NTPC]], [[Lanco Infratech]], [[KSK Energy Ventures]], [[Jindal Power Limited]]\n\n=== Exports ===\nChhattisgarh's total exports were US$353.3&nbsp;million in 2009\u201310. Nearly 75% of exports comes from Bhilai and the remaining from Urla, Bhanpuri, and Sirgitti. The major exports products include steel, handicrafts, handlooms, blended yarn, food and agri-products, iron, aluminium, cement, minerals, and engineering products.

The reason for this is the extreme poverty in rural areas.\n\n=== Health Index ===\nAs per census 2011, the State has population of 25.5&nbsp;million and six medical colleges ( five Government and one private) with intake capacity of 700 students and doctor patient ratio of 1:17,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chhattisgarh a poor State with low health indices: CAG |url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2017/state-editions/chhattisgarh-a-poor-state-with-low-health-indices-cag.html |website=The Pioneer |accessdate=29 September 2018 |date=31 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929233452/https://www.dailypioneer.com/2017/state-editions/chhattisgarh-a-poor-state-with-low-health-indices-cag.html |archive-date=29 September 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nUnder The NITI Aayog released Health Index report titled, \"Healthy States, Progressive India.\"- Chhattisgarh has an index of 52.02 Out of 100, which is better than states such as Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Odisha, Bihar, Assam, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pandey |first1=Kundan |title=NITI Aayog's Health Index: Kerala on top; Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh among worst performers |url=https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/niti-aayog-s-health-index-kerala-on-top-rajasthan-uttar-pradesh-among-worst-performers-59663 |website=Down To Earth |accessdate=29 September 2018 |date=9 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810142701/https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/niti-aayog-s-health-index-kerala-on-top-rajasthan-uttar-pradesh-among-worst-performers-59663 |archive-date=10 August 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDespite different health related schemes and programmes, the health indicators such as the percentage of women with BMI<18.5, Under Five Mortality Rate and underweight children are poor. This may be due to the difficulty in accessing the remote areas in the state. The prevalence of female malnutrition in Chhattisgarh is higher than the national average\u2014half of the ST females are malnourished. The performance of SCs is a little better than the corresponding national and state average. The Under Five Mortality Rate among STs is significantly higher than the national average.\n\n=== Net state domestic product ===\nChhattisgarh is one of the emerging states with relatively high growth rates of net state domestic product (NSDP) (8.2% vs. 7.1% All India over 2002\u20132008) and per capita NSDP (6.2% vs. 5.4% All India over 2002\u20132008). The growth rates of the said parameters are above the national averages and thus it appears that Chhattisgarh is catching up with other states in this respect. However, the state still has very low levels of per capita income as compared to the other states.\n\n=== Urbanisation ===\nOut of total population of Chhattisgarh, 23.24% people live in urban regions. The total figure of population living in urban areas is 5,937,237 of which 3,035,469 are males and while remaining 2,901,768 are females.\n\nRaipur, Durg, Bhilai Nagar, Bilaspur, Korba, Jagdalpur, Rajnandgaon and Raigarh are some of the urban towns and cities in the region.<ref name=\"census2011.co.in\" />\n\n=== Sex ratio ===\nThere are more than 13 million males and 12.9&nbsp; million females in Chhattisgarh, which constitutes 2.11% of the country's population. The [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] in the state is one of the most balanced in India with 991 females per 1,000 males, as is the child sex-ratio with 964 females per 1,000 males (Census 2011)\n\n=== Fertility rate ===\nChhattisgarh has a fairly high fertility rate (3.1) as compared to All India (2.6) and the replacement rate (2.1). It has a rural fertility rate of 3.2 and urban fertility rate of 2.1.\n\n=== SC and ST population ===\nWith the exception of the hilly states of the north-east, Chhattisgarh has one of highest shares of Scheduled Tribe (ST) populations within a state, accounting for about 10 percent of the STs in India. Scheduled Tribes make up 30.62% of the population. The tribals are an important part of the state population and mainly inhabit the dense forests of Bastar and other districts of south Chhattisgarh. The percentage increase in the population of the scheduled list of tribals during the 2001\u20132011 decade had been at the rate of 18.23%. The Scheduled Caste (SC) population of Chhattisgarh is 2,418,722 as per 2001 census constituting 11.6 percent of the total population (20,833,803). The proportion of Scheduled Castes has increased from 11.6 percent in 2001 to 12.8% in 2011.\n\n=== Poverty ===\n[[File:Diospyros melanoxylon Tendu.jpg|thumb|[[Tendu (tree)|Tendu]] Patta (Leaf) collection in Chhattisgarh, India.]]\nThe incidence of poverty in Chhattisgarh is very high. The estimated poverty ratio in 2004\u201305 based on uniform reference period consumption was around 50 per cent, which is approximately double the all India level. The incidence of poverty in the rural and urban areas is almost the same.\n\nMore than half of the rural STs and urban SCs are poor. In general, the proportion of poor SC and ST households in the state is higher than the state average and their community's respective national averages (except for rural SC households). Given that more than 50 percent of the state's population is ST and SC, the high incidence of income poverty among them is a matter of serious concern in the state.\n\nThis indicates that the good economic performance in recent years has not percolated to this socially deprived group, which is reflected in their poor performance in human development indicators.\n\n=== Access to drinking water ===\nIn terms of access to improved drinking water sources, at the aggregate level, Chhattisgarh fared better than the national average and the SCs of the state performed better than the corresponding national average. Scheduled Tribes are marginally below the state average, but still better than the STs at the all India level.\n\nThe proportion of households with access to improved sources of drinking water in 2008\u201309 was 91%. This proportion was over 90% even in states like Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. This was largely because these states had over 70% of their households accessing tube wells/hand-pumps as sources of drinking water.\n\n=== Sanitation ===\nSanitation facilities in the state were abysmally low with only about 41 percent having toilet facilities before the [[Swachh Bharat Mission]] was Launched by the Government of India. The Urban areas of Chhattisgarh attained the title of open defecation free on 2 October 2017 and the rural areas have achieved a 90.31% sanitation coverage. What sets Chhattisgarh apart from other states of India is an approach to bring in behavioural change in order to get open defecation free status. In Chhattisgarh, people don't get toilet incentives, they have to construct the toilet with their own money, after using the toilet for 3 months they are entitled for the incentive amount.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/commendable-progress-urban-rural-sanitation-chhattisgarh-way-open-defecation-free-12041/|title=With Commendable Progress in Both Urban And Rural Sanitation, Chhattisgarh Is on Its Way To Be Open Defecation Free \u2013 Swachh Report Card|date=19 September 2017|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810143753/https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/commendable-progress-urban-rural-sanitation-chhattisgarh-way-open-defecation-free-12041/|archive-date=10 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Teledensity ===\nAcross states, it has been found that [[teledensity]] (telephone density) was below 10 percent in 2010 for Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, reflecting a lack of access to telephones in these relatively poorer states. But due to development of new technology the teledensity in 2017 is 68.08 percent which shows improvement of telecom infrastructure. On the other hand, for states like Delhi and Himachal Pradesh and metropolitan cities like Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai, teledensity was over 100 percent in 2010 implying that individuals have more than one telephone connection.\n\n=== Road density ===\nThe total density of National Highways (NHs) in Chhattisgarh is at 23.4&nbsp;km per 1,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> out of the total length of 3,168&nbsp;km in the State, the Central Government has informed.\nChhattisgarh Government had completed construction of 5,266 cement concrete (CC) roads having a total length of 1,530&nbsp;km in various villages of the State as on 31 May 2016 under 'Mukhyamantri Gram Sadak Yojana'.<ref>{{cite web |title=23.4&nbsp;km per 1000 sq. kms NH road density in Chhattisgarh: Centre |url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2016/state-editions/234-kms-per-1000-sq-kms-nh-road-density-in-chhattisgarh-centre.html |website=The Pioneer |accessdate=29 September 2018 |date=15 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929233445/https://www.dailypioneer.com/2016/state-editions/234-kms-per-1000-sq-kms-nh-road-density-in-chhattisgarh-centre.html |archive-date=29 September 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n=== Witchcraft ===\n[[File:Mission Against Witchcraft.jpg|thumb|Social Mission Against Blind Faith|alt=|left]]To bring about social reforms and with a view to discourage undesirable social practices, Chhattisgarh government has enacted the Chhattisgarh Tonhi Atyachar (Niwaran) Act, 2005 against witchery.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dark Spell|url=http://newsblaze.com/story/20091108150914shan.nb/topstory.html|accessdate=22 July 2011|date=8 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125204907/http://newsblaze.com/story/20091108150914shan.nb/topstory.html|archive-date=25 November 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Much has to be done on the issue of law enforcement by judicial authorities to protect women in this regard, bringing such persecution to an end.<ref name=\"womennewsnetwork.net\" />\n\nSome sections of tribal population of Chhattisgarh state believe in [[witchcraft]].<ref name=\"womennewsnetwork.net\">{{cite web|title=India: Protective Laws Fall Short for Women Charged with Witchcraft|url=http://womennewsnetwork.net/2010/03/21/witchcraft-india-89/|accessdate=22 July 2011|date=21 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702111614/http://womennewsnetwork.net/2010/03/21/witchcraft-india-89/|archive-date=2 July 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Women are believed to have access to supernatural forces and are accused of being witches (''tonhi'') often to settle personal scores.\n\nAs of 2010, they are still hounded out of villages on the basis of flimsy accusations by male village sorcerers paid to do so by villagers with personal agendas, such as property and goods acquisition.<ref name=\"womennewsnetwork.net\" /> According to [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] Channel's investigations, those accused are fortunate if they are only verbally bullied and shunned or exiled from their village.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{IndiaCensusPop\n| title= Population Growth\n| 1951= 7457000\n| 1961= 9154000\n| 1971= 11637000\n| 1981= 14010000\n| 1991= 17615000\n| 2001= 20834000\n| 2011= 25540198\n| estimate=\n| estyear=\n| estref=\n| footnote=Source:Census of India<ref name=\"Census Population\">{{cite web|url=http://indiabudget.nic.in/es2006-07/chapt2007/tab97.pdf|title=Census Population|work=Census of India|publisher=Ministry of Finance India|accessdate=18 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219073658/http://indiabudget.nic.in/es2006-07/chapt2007/tab97.pdf|archive-date=19 December 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"2011census\">{{cite web|url=http://www.census2011.co.in/states.php|title=States Census 2011|work=Census of India|publisher=Ministry of Finance India|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214170814/http://www.census2011.co.in/states.php|archive-date=14 February 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|1901=4181554|1911=5191583|1921=5264976|1931=6028778|1941=6814886}}\nChhattisgarh has an urban population of 23.4% (around 5.1&nbsp;million people in 2011) residing in urban areas.

According to another local custom, women can choose to terminate a marriage relationship through a custom called ''chudi pahanana'', if she desires. Most of the old temples and shrines follow [[Shaktism]] and are goddess-centric (e.g., [[Shabari]], [[Mahamaya]], [[Danteshwari Temple|Danteshwari]]) and the existence of these temples gives insight into historical and current social fabric of this state. However, a mention of these progressive local customs in no way suggests that the ideology of female subservience does not exist in Chhattisgarh.

[[Champaran, Chhattisgarh|Champaran]] is a small town with religious significance as the birthplace of the saint [[Vallabha|Vallabhacharya]], increasingly important as a pilgrimage site for the Gujarati community.\n\nChhattisgarh has a significant role in the life of the Lord [[Rama]]. Lord Rama along with his wife Sita and his younger brother [[Lakshmana]] had started his ''[[Vanvas]]'' (exile) in the Bastar, then known as Dandakarayna. They lived more than 10 of their 14 years of Vanvas in different places of Chhattisgarh. One of the remarkable places is [[Shivrinarayan]] which is nearby [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh|Bilaspur]] district of Chhattisgarh. Shivrinarayan was named after an old lady [[Shabari]]. When Ram visited Shabari she said \"I do not have anything to offer other than my heart, but here are some berry fruits. May it please you, my Lord.\" Saying so, Shabari offered the fruits she had meticulously collected to Rama. When Rama was tasting them, Lakshmana raised the concern that Shabari had already tasted them and therefore unworthy of eating. To this Rama said that of the many types of food he had tasted, \"nothing could equal these berry fruits, offered with such devotion. You taste them, then alone will you know. Whomsoever offers a fruit, leaf, flower or some water with love, I partake it with great joy.\"\n\nThe [[Odia culture]] is prominent in the eastern parts of Chhattisgarh bordering Odisha.\n\n=== Literature ===\nChhattisgarh is a storehouse of literature, performing arts and crafts\u2014all of which derives its substance and sustenance from the day-to-day life experiences of its people. Religion, mythology, social and political events, nature and folklore are favourite motifs. Traditional crafts include painting, woodcarving, bell metal craft, bamboo ware, and tribal jewellery. Chhattisgarh has a rich literary heritage with roots that lie deep in the sociological and historical movements of the region. Its literature reflects the regional consciousness and the evolution of an identity distinct from others in Central India.\n\n=== Crafts ===\nChhattisgarh is known for \"Kosa silk\" and \"lost wax art\". Besides saris and salwar suits, the fabric is used to create lehengas, stoles, shawls and menswear including jackets, shirts, achkans and sherwanis. Works by the internationally renowned sculptor, Sushil Sakhuja's Dhokra Nandi, are available at the government's Shabagcrafts emporium, Raipur.\n\n=== Dance ===\nPanthi, Raut Nacha, Pandwani, Chaitra, Kaksar, Saila, Khamb-swang, Bhatra Naat, Rahas, Raai, Maao-Pata and Soowa are the several indigenous dance styles of Chhattisgarh.\n\nPanthi, the folk dance of the Satnami community, has religious overtones. Panthi is performed on Maghi Purnima, the anniversary of the birth of [[Ghasidas|Guru Ghasidas]]. The dancers dance around a jaitkhamb set up for the occasion, to songs eulogising their spiritual head. The songs reflect a view of ''[[nirvana]]'', conveying the spirit of their guru's renunciation and the teachings of saint poets like [[Kabir]], Ramdas and Dadu. Dancers with bent torsos and swinging arms dance, carried away by their devotion. As the rhythm quickens, they perform acrobatics and form human pyramids.<ref>{{cite web|title=Panthi Dance|url=http://www.sangeetnatak.org/deshparva/desaj/panthi.htm|accessdate=27 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002123235/http://www.sangeetnatak.org/deshparva/desaj/panthi.htm|archivedate=2 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== Pandwani ====\n[[Pandavani]] is a folk ballad form performed predominantly in Chhattisgarh. It depicts the story of the Pandavas, the leading characters in the epic Mahabharata. The artists in the Pandavani narration consist of a lead artist and some supporting singers and musicians.

In 1905, the [[Sambalpur district]] was transferred to Odisha and the estates of Surguja were transferred from Bengal to Chhattisgarh.\n\nThe area constituting the new state merged into Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 1956, under the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956]] and remained a part of that state for 44 years. Prior to its becoming a part of the new state of Madhya Pradesh, the region was part of old Madhya Pradesh State, with its capital at Bhopal. Prior to that, the region was part of the [[Central Provinces and Berar]] (CP and Berar) under British rule. Some areas constituting the Chhattisgarh state were [[princely state]]s under the British rule, but later on were merged into Madhya Pradesh.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cgfinance.nic.in/FSFC/State%20Finance%20Report/English/Chap-4.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502133300/http://cgfinance.nic.in/FSFC/State%20Finance%20Report/English/Chap-4.pdf |archive-date=2 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Separation of Chhattisgarh ===\n[[File:Secretariat in Naya Raipur.JPG|thumb|Mantralaya in Naya (New) Raipur]]\nThe present state of Chhattisgarh was carved out of Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 2000.<ref name=\"cgfinance.nic.in\" /><ref name=\"zeenews.india.com\" /> The demand for a separate state was first raised in the 1920s.

In the mid-1990s, most of Chhattisgarh was still a monocrop belt. Only one-fourth to one-fifth of the sown area was double-cropped. When a very substantial portion of the population is dependent on agriculture, a situation where nearly 80% of a state's area is covered only by one crop, immediate attention to turn them into double crop areas is needed. Also, very few cash crops are grown in Chhattisgarh, so there is a need to diversify the agriculture produce towards oilseeds and other cash crops. Chhattisgarh is also called the \"rice bowl of central India\".<ref name=\"Agriculture in Chhattisgarh\" />\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Kodo Millet in Chhattisgarh.jpg|Kodo Millet is used as a life saving medicine in Chhattisgarh\nFile:Bastar Beer.jpg|Bastar beer prepared from Sulfi\n</gallery>\n\n==== Irrigation ====\nIn Chhattisgarh, rice, the main crop, is grown on about 77% of the net sown area. Only about 20% of the area is under irrigation; the rest depends on rain. Of the three agroclimatic zones, about 73% of the Chhattisgarh plains, 97% of the Bastar plateau and 95% of the northern hills are rainfed. The irrigated area available for double cropping is only 87,000&nbsp;ha in Chhattisgarh plains and 2300&nbsp;ha in Bastar plateau and northern hills. Due to this, the productivity of rice and other crops is low, hence the farmers are unable to obtain economic benefits from agriculture and it has remained as subsistence agriculture till now, though agriculture is the main occupation of more than 80% of the population.<ref name=\"nhm.nic.in\" />\n\nIn Chhattisgarh region, about 22% of net cropped area was under irrigation as compared to 36.5% in Madhya Pradesh in 1998\u201399, whereas the average national irrigation was about 40%. The irrigation is characterised by a high order of variability ranging from 1.6% in Bastar to 75.0% in Dhamtari. Based on an average growth trend in the irrigated area, about 0.43% additional area is brought under irrigation every year as compared to 1.89% in Madhya Pradesh and 1.0% in the country as a whole. Thus, irrigation has been growing at a very low rate in Chhattisgarh and the pace of irrigation is so slow, it would take about 122 years to reach the 75% level of net irrigated area in Chhattisgarh at the present rate of growth.<ref name=\"nhm.nic.in\" />\n\nChhattisgarh has a limited [[irrigation]] system, with dams and [[canal]]s on some rivers. Average rainfall in the state is around 1400&nbsp;mm and the entire state falls under the rice agroclimatic zone. The Large variation in the yearly rainfall directly affects the production of rice. Irrigation is the prime need of the state for its overall development and therefore the state government has given top priority to development of irrigation.<ref name=\"Agriculture in Chhattisgarh\" />\n\nA total of four major, 33 medium and 2199 minor irrigation projects have been completed and five major, nine medium and 312 minor projects are under construction, as of 31 March 2006.{{Update inline|date=August 2019|reason=These numbers are from over ten years ago.

Based on the current production of surplus electric power, the position of the State is comfortable and profitable. The Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board (CSEB) is in a strong position to meet the electricity requirement of the state and is in good financial health. According to [[Central Electricity Authority (India)|Central Electricity Authority]] (CEA), Chhattisgarh provides electricity to several other states because of surplus production.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/chhattisgarh-is-power-surplus-state--confirms-cea-report.html|title=Chhattisgarh is power surplus state, confirms CEA report|last=Pioneer|first=The|website=The Pioneer|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref>\n\nIn Chhattisgarh, [[National Thermal Power Corporation Limited]] (|NTPC) has [[Sipat Thermal Power Station]] with a capacity of 2,980 MW at Sipat, Bilaspur; [[LARA Super Thermal Power Station]] with a nameplate capacity of 1600MW and [[Korba Super Thermal Power Station]] with a capacity of 2,600 MW at Korba, while CSEB's units have a thermal capacity of 1,780 MW and hydel capacity of 130 MW. Apart from NTPC and CSEB, there are a number of private generation units of large and small capacity.

To use this vast potential, substantial additions to the existing generation capacity are already underway.<ref name=\"Power Sector in Chhattisgarh\" />\n\n==== Steel sector ====\nThe steel industry is one of the biggest heavy industries of Chhattisgarh. Bhilai Steel Plant, Bhilai operated by [[Steel Authority of India Limited|SAIL]], with a capacity of 5.4&nbsp;million tonnes per year, is regarded as a significant growth indicator of the state. More than 100 steel rolling mills, 90 sponge iron plants and ferro-alloy units are in Chhattisgarh. Along with Bhilai, today Raipur, Bilaspur, Korba and Raigarh have become the steel hub of Chhattisgarh. Today, Raipur has become the centre of the steel sector, the biggest market for steel in India.<ref name=\"Industries in Chhattisgarh\">{{cite web|title=Industries in Chhattisgarh|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/economy/chhattisgarh-industries.html|accessdate=22 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810083204/http://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/economy/chhattisgarh-industries.html|archive-date=10 August 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Aluminium sector ====\nThe aluminium industry of Chhattisgarh was established by Bharat Aluminium Company Limited, which has a capacity of around 600,000 tonnes each year.<ref name=\"Industries in Chhattisgarh\" />\n\n==== Natural resources ====\n\n===== Forest =====\nForests occupy 41.33% of the total area (as per the latest report by the [[Indian Forest Service]]) and the rich forest resources include wood, tendu leaves, [[honey]] and lac.

The Average Literacy rate in Chhattisgarh for Urban regions was 84.05 percent in which males were 90.58% literate while female literacy stood at 73.39%. Total literates in the urban region of Chhattisgarh were 4,370,966.<ref name=\"census2011.co.in\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census2011.co.in/census/state/chhattisgarh.html|title=Chhattisgarh Population Sex Ratio in Chhattisgarh Literacy rate data|website=census2011.co.in|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808042246/http://www.census2011.co.in/census/state/chhattisgarh.html|archive-date=8 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAccording to NSS (2007\u201308), the literacy rate for [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Scheduled Castes (SCs)]] was better than the corresponding national average.\n\nAmong the marginalised groups, STs are at the bottom of the rankings, further emphasising the lack of social development in the state. Bastar and Dantewada in south Chhattisgarh are the most illiterate districts and the drop out ratio is the highest among all the districts. The reason for this is the extreme poverty in rural areas.\n\n=== Health Index ===\nAs per census 2011, the State has population of 25.5&nbsp;million and six medical colleges ( five Government and one private) with intake capacity of 700 students and doctor patient ratio of 1:17,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chhattisgarh a poor State with low health indices: CAG |url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2017/state-editions/chhattisgarh-a-poor-state-with-low-health-indices-cag.html |website=The Pioneer |accessdate=29 September 2018 |date=31 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929233452/https://www.dailypioneer.com/2017/state-editions/chhattisgarh-a-poor-state-with-low-health-indices-cag.html |archive-date=29 September 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nUnder The NITI Aayog released Health Index report titled, \"Healthy States, Progressive India.\"- Chhattisgarh has an index of 52.02 Out of 100, which is better than states such as Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Odisha, Bihar, Assam, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pandey |first1=Kundan |title=NITI Aayog's Health Index: Kerala on top; Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh among worst performers |url=https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/niti-aayog-s-health-index-kerala-on-top-rajasthan-uttar-pradesh-among-worst-performers-59663 |website=Down To Earth |accessdate=29 September 2018 |date=9 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810142701/https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/niti-aayog-s-health-index-kerala-on-top-rajasthan-uttar-pradesh-among-worst-performers-59663 |archive-date=10 August 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDespite different health related schemes and programmes, the health indicators such as the percentage of women with BMI<18.5, Under Five Mortality Rate and underweight children are poor. This may be due to the difficulty in accessing the remote areas in the state. The prevalence of female malnutrition in Chhattisgarh is higher than the national average\u2014half of the ST females are malnourished. The performance of SCs is a little better than the corresponding national and state average. The Under Five Mortality Rate among STs is significantly higher than the national average.\n\n=== Net state domestic product ===\nChhattisgarh is one of the emerging states with relatively high growth rates of net state domestic product (NSDP) (8.2% vs. 7.1% All India over 2002\u20132008) and per capita NSDP (6.2% vs. 5.4% All India over 2002\u20132008). The growth rates of the said parameters are above the national averages and thus it appears that Chhattisgarh is catching up with other states in this respect. However, the state still has very low levels of per capita income as compared to the other states.\n\n=== Urbanisation ===\nOut of total population of Chhattisgarh, 23.24% people live in urban regions. The total figure of population living in urban areas is 5,937,237 of which 3,035,469 are males and while remaining 2,901,768 are females.\n\nRaipur, Durg, Bhilai Nagar, Bilaspur, Korba, Jagdalpur, Rajnandgaon and Raigarh are some of the urban towns and cities in the region.<ref name=\"census2011.co.in\" />\n\n=== Sex ratio ===\nThere are more than 13 million males and 12.9&nbsp; million females in Chhattisgarh, which constitutes 2.11% of the country's population. The [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] in the state is one of the most balanced in India with 991 females per 1,000 males, as is the child sex-ratio with 964 females per 1,000 males (Census 2011)\n\n=== Fertility rate ===\nChhattisgarh has a fairly high fertility rate (3.1) as compared to All India (2.6) and the replacement rate (2.1). It has a rural fertility rate of 3.2 and urban fertility rate of 2.1.\n\n=== SC and ST population ===\nWith the exception of the hilly states of the north-east, Chhattisgarh has one of highest shares of Scheduled Tribe (ST) populations within a state, accounting for about 10 percent of the STs in India. Scheduled Tribes make up 30.62% of the population. The tribals are an important part of the state population and mainly inhabit the dense forests of Bastar and other districts of south Chhattisgarh. The percentage increase in the population of the scheduled list of tribals during the 2001\u20132011 decade had been at the rate of 18.23%. The Scheduled Caste (SC) population of Chhattisgarh is 2,418,722 as per 2001 census constituting 11.6 percent of the total population (20,833,803). The proportion of Scheduled Castes has increased from 11.6 percent in 2001 to 12.8% in 2011.\n\n=== Poverty ===\n[[File:Diospyros melanoxylon Tendu.jpg|thumb|[[Tendu (tree)|Tendu]] Patta (Leaf) collection in Chhattisgarh, India.]]\nThe incidence of poverty in Chhattisgarh is very high. The estimated poverty ratio in 2004\u201305 based on uniform reference period consumption was around 50 per cent, which is approximately double the all India level. The incidence of poverty in the rural and urban areas is almost the same.\n\nMore than half of the rural STs and urban SCs are poor. In general, the proportion of poor SC and ST households in the state is higher than the state average and their community's respective national averages (except for rural SC households). Given that more than 50 percent of the state's population is ST and SC, the high incidence of income poverty among them is a matter of serious concern in the state.\n\nThis indicates that the good economic performance in recent years has not percolated to this socially deprived group, which is reflected in their poor performance in human development indicators.\n\n=== Access to drinking water ===\nIn terms of access to improved drinking water sources, at the aggregate level, Chhattisgarh fared better than the national average and the SCs of the state performed better than the corresponding national average. Scheduled Tribes are marginally below the state average, but still better than the STs at the all India level.\n\nThe proportion of households with access to improved sources of drinking water in 2008\u201309 was 91%. This proportion was over 90% even in states like Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. This was largely because these states had over 70% of their households accessing tube wells/hand-pumps as sources of drinking water.\n\n=== Sanitation ===\nSanitation facilities in the state were abysmally low with only about 41 percent having toilet facilities before the [[Swachh Bharat Mission]] was Launched by the Government of India. The Urban areas of Chhattisgarh attained the title of open defecation free on 2 October 2017 and the rural areas have achieved a 90.31% sanitation coverage. What sets Chhattisgarh apart from other states of India is an approach to bring in behavioural change in order to get open defecation free status. In Chhattisgarh, people don't get toilet incentives, they have to construct the toilet with their own money, after using the toilet for 3 months they are entitled for the incentive amount.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/commendable-progress-urban-rural-sanitation-chhattisgarh-way-open-defecation-free-12041/|title=With Commendable Progress in Both Urban And Rural Sanitation, Chhattisgarh Is on Its Way To Be Open Defecation Free \u2013 Swachh Report Card|date=19 September 2017|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810143753/https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/commendable-progress-urban-rural-sanitation-chhattisgarh-way-open-defecation-free-12041/|archive-date=10 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Teledensity ===\nAcross states, it has been found that [[teledensity]] (telephone density) was below 10 percent in 2010 for Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, reflecting a lack of access to telephones in these relatively poorer states. But due to development of new technology the teledensity in 2017 is 68.08 percent which shows improvement of telecom infrastructure. On the other hand, for states like Delhi and Himachal Pradesh and metropolitan cities like Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai, teledensity was over 100 percent in 2010 implying that individuals have more than one telephone connection.\n\n=== Road density ===\nThe total density of National Highways (NHs) in Chhattisgarh is at 23.4&nbsp;km per 1,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> out of the total length of 3,168&nbsp;km in the State, the Central Government has informed.\nChhattisgarh Government had completed construction of 5,266 cement concrete (CC) roads having a total length of 1,530&nbsp;km in various villages of the State as on 31 May 2016 under 'Mukhyamantri Gram Sadak Yojana'.<ref>{{cite web |title=23.4&nbsp;km per 1000 sq. kms NH road density in Chhattisgarh: Centre |url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2016/state-editions/234-kms-per-1000-sq-kms-nh-road-density-in-chhattisgarh-centre.html |website=The Pioneer |accessdate=29 September 2018 |date=15 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929233445/https://www.dailypioneer.com/2016/state-editions/234-kms-per-1000-sq-kms-nh-road-density-in-chhattisgarh-centre.html |archive-date=29 September 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n=== Witchcraft ===\n[[File:Mission Against Witchcraft.jpg|thumb|Social Mission Against Blind Faith|alt=|left]]To bring about social reforms and with a view to discourage undesirable social practices, Chhattisgarh government has enacted the Chhattisgarh Tonhi Atyachar (Niwaran) Act, 2005 against witchery.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dark Spell|url=http://newsblaze.com/story/20091108150914shan.nb/topstory.html|accessdate=22 July 2011|date=8 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125204907/http://newsblaze.com/story/20091108150914shan.nb/topstory.html|archive-date=25 November 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Much has to be done on the issue of law enforcement by judicial authorities to protect women in this regard, bringing such persecution to an end.<ref name=\"womennewsnetwork.net\" />\n\nSome sections of tribal population of Chhattisgarh state believe in [[witchcraft]].<ref name=\"womennewsnetwork.net\">{{cite web|title=India: Protective Laws Fall Short for Women Charged with Witchcraft|url=http://womennewsnetwork.net/2010/03/21/witchcraft-india-89/|accessdate=22 July 2011|date=21 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702111614/http://womennewsnetwork.net/2010/03/21/witchcraft-india-89/|archive-date=2 July 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Women are believed to have access to supernatural forces and are accused of being witches (''tonhi'') often to settle personal scores.\n\nAs of 2010, they are still hounded out of villages on the basis of flimsy accusations by male village sorcerers paid to do so by villagers with personal agendas, such as property and goods acquisition.<ref name=\"womennewsnetwork.net\" /> According to [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] Channel's investigations, those accused are fortunate if they are only verbally bullied and shunned or exiled from their village.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{IndiaCensusPop\n| title= Population Growth\n| 1951= 7457000\n| 1961= 9154000\n| 1971= 11637000\n| 1981= 14010000\n| 1991= 17615000\n| 2001= 20834000\n| 2011= 25540198\n| estimate=\n| estyear=\n| estref=\n| footnote=Source:Census of India<ref name=\"Census Population\">{{cite web|url=http://indiabudget.nic.in/es2006-07/chapt2007/tab97.pdf|title=Census Population|work=Census of India|publisher=Ministry of Finance India|accessdate=18 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219073658/http://indiabudget.nic.in/es2006-07/chapt2007/tab97.pdf|archive-date=19 December 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"2011census\">{{cite web|url=http://www.census2011.co.in/states.php|title=States Census 2011|work=Census of India|publisher=Ministry of Finance India|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214170814/http://www.census2011.co.in/states.php|archive-date=14 February 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|1901=4181554|1911=5191583|1921=5264976|1931=6028778|1941=6814886}}\nChhattisgarh has an urban population of 23.4% (around 5.1&nbsp;million people in 2011) residing in urban areas.

Although this ratio is small compared to other states, it is unique in India because Chhattisgarh is the 10th-largest state in India.\n\nThe gender ratio (number of females per 1,000 males) has been steadily declining over 20th century in Chhattisgarh. But it is conspicuous that Chhattisgarh always had a better female-to-male ratio compared with national average.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

According to another local custom, women can choose to terminate a marriage relationship through a custom called ''chudi pahanana'', if she desires. Most of the old temples and shrines follow [[Shaktism]] and are goddess-centric (e.g., [[Shabari]], [[Mahamaya]], [[Danteshwari Temple|Danteshwari]]) and the existence of these temples gives insight into historical and current social fabric of this state. However, a mention of these progressive local customs in no way suggests that the ideology of female subservience does not exist in Chhattisgarh. On the contrary, the male authority and dominance is seen quite clearly in the social and cultural life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Social Structure in Chhattisgarh |url=http://www.korbacity.com/index.php/know-more-about-chhattisgarh/chhattisgarh-social-structure.html |accessdate=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720005404/http://www.korbacity.com/index.php/know-more-about-chhattisgarh/chhattisgarh-social-structure.html |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Temple Carvings in Malhar Bilaspur Chhattisgarh 2009.jpg|thumb|A carving in the 10th- or 11th-century Hindu temple of Malhar village.

[[Champaran, Chhattisgarh|Champaran]] is a small town with religious significance as the birthplace of the saint [[Vallabha|Vallabhacharya]], increasingly important as a pilgrimage site for the Gujarati community.\n\nChhattisgarh has a significant role in the life of the Lord [[Rama]]. Lord Rama along with his wife Sita and his younger brother [[Lakshmana]] had started his ''[[Vanvas]]'' (exile) in the Bastar, then known as Dandakarayna. They lived more than 10 of their 14 years of Vanvas in different places of Chhattisgarh. One of the remarkable places is [[Shivrinarayan]] which is nearby [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh|Bilaspur]] district of Chhattisgarh. Shivrinarayan was named after an old lady [[Shabari]]. When Ram visited Shabari she said \"I do not have anything to offer other than my heart, but here are some berry fruits. May it please you, my Lord.\" Saying so, Shabari offered the fruits she had meticulously collected to Rama. When Rama was tasting them, Lakshmana raised the concern that Shabari had already tasted them and therefore unworthy of eating. To this Rama said that of the many types of food he had tasted, \"nothing could equal these berry fruits, offered with such devotion. You taste them, then alone will you know. Whomsoever offers a fruit, leaf, flower or some water with love, I partake it with great joy.\"\n\nThe [[Odia culture]] is prominent in the eastern parts of Chhattisgarh bordering Odisha.\n\n=== Literature ===\nChhattisgarh is a storehouse of literature, performing arts and crafts\u2014all of which derives its substance and sustenance from the day-to-day life experiences of its people. Religion, mythology, social and political events, nature and folklore are favourite motifs. Traditional crafts include painting, woodcarving, bell metal craft, bamboo ware, and tribal jewellery. Chhattisgarh has a rich literary heritage with roots that lie deep in the sociological and historical movements of the region. Its literature reflects the regional consciousness and the evolution of an identity distinct from others in Central India.\n\n=== Crafts ===\nChhattisgarh is known for \"Kosa silk\" and \"lost wax art\". Besides saris and salwar suits, the fabric is used to create lehengas, stoles, shawls and menswear including jackets, shirts, achkans and sherwanis. Works by the internationally renowned sculptor, Sushil Sakhuja's Dhokra Nandi, are available at the government's Shabagcrafts emporium, Raipur.\n\n=== Dance ===\nPanthi, Raut Nacha, Pandwani, Chaitra, Kaksar, Saila, Khamb-swang, Bhatra Naat, Rahas, Raai, Maao-Pata and Soowa are the several indigenous dance styles of Chhattisgarh.\n\nPanthi, the folk dance of the Satnami community, has religious overtones. Panthi is performed on Maghi Purnima, the anniversary of the birth of [[Ghasidas|Guru Ghasidas]]. The dancers dance around a jaitkhamb set up for the occasion, to songs eulogising their spiritual head. The songs reflect a view of ''[[nirvana]]'', conveying the spirit of their guru's renunciation and the teachings of saint poets like [[Kabir]], Ramdas and Dadu. Dancers with bent torsos and swinging arms dance, carried away by their devotion. As the rhythm quickens, they perform acrobatics and form human pyramids.<ref>{{cite web|title=Panthi Dance|url=http://www.sangeetnatak.org/deshparva/desaj/panthi.htm|accessdate=27 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002123235/http://www.sangeetnatak.org/deshparva/desaj/panthi.htm|archivedate=2 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== Pandwani ====\n[[Pandavani]] is a folk ballad form performed predominantly in Chhattisgarh. It depicts the story of the Pandavas, the leading characters in the epic Mahabharata. The artists in the Pandavani narration consist of a lead artist and some supporting singers and musicians. There are two styles of narration in Pandavani, Vedamati, and Kapalik. In the Vedamati style, the lead artist narrates in a simple manner by sitting on the floor throughout the performance. The Kaplik style is livelier, where the narrator actually enacts the scenes and characters.

The first part is set in the medium-sized town of [[Fenyang]] (in the northern [[Shanxi]] province) in 1999. 25-year-old shopkeeper Tao (Zhao Tao) is torn between two suitors. Jingsheng ([[Zhang Yi (actor)|Zhang Yi]]) is a well-off gas station owner whom she has little connection with but could drastically improve her material living conditions. She feels closer to Liangzi (Liang Jingdong), a poor laborer in a local coal mine. When confronted by both men, Tao decides to marry Jingsheng in the hope of leaving Fenyang.\n\nIn 2014, Tao is now divorced from Jingsheng and still living in Fenyang, running the prosperous gas station and being a prominent and generous woman in the city. Jingsheng has since remarried and lives in Shanghai, and has become wealthy from investments. Liangzi works as a miner near [[Handan]], in the neighboring province of [[Hebei]], and has gotten ill. Most of the second act focuses on Tao and Jingsheng's son, Daole (pronounced Dollar in English) aged 7, who comes to visit her for the funeral of her father. Tao is upset by Daole's distance, which she acknowledges is due to their cultural differences - a product of Jingsheng's fascination with globalization. Tao, knowing they are fated to be apart, decides to ride the slow train with Daole, instead of sending him on a plane back to Shanghai. As a parting gift, Tao makes Daole a set of keys for her house so that he can return to his mother's home whenever he wants.\n\nIn 2025, Daole (now currently called Dollar) is attending college in Australia. He is constantly fighting with his father over his desire to drop out of college and have the freedom he was never granted in his childhood. He meets Mia, his Chinese language teacher, an older woman for whom he develops feelings and eventually begins a relationship with. Dollar shares with Mia how he still carries the keys his mother gave him when he was a young boy, and that he fears she may die, even though they have not talked for years. Mia convinces him to fly back to China with her so that he can see Tao. The film ends with Tao dancing to \"[[Go West (song)|Go West]]\", recalling the beginning of the film when, as a young woman, she was dancing merrily with all of her then fellows (making waves with their arms, \"wave\" being incidentally the translation of the first name \"Tao\" in English), full of hope for a better life.

The first part is set in the medium-sized town of [[Fenyang]] (in the northern [[Shanxi]] province) in 1999. 25-year-old shopkeeper Tao (Zhao Tao) is torn between two suitors. Jingsheng ([[Zhang Yi (actor)|Zhang Yi]]) is a well-off gas station owner whom she has little connection with but could drastically improve her material living conditions. She feels closer to Liangzi (Liang Jingdong), a poor laborer in a local coal mine. When confronted by both men, Tao decides to marry Jingsheng in the hope of leaving Fenyang.\n\nIn 2014, Tao is now divorced from Jingsheng and still living in Fenyang, running the prosperous gas station and being a prominent and generous woman in the city. Jingsheng has since remarried and lives in Shanghai, and has become wealthy from investments. Liangzi works as a miner near [[Handan]], in the neighboring province of [[Hebei]], and has gotten ill. Most of the second act focuses on Tao and Jingsheng's son, Daole (pronounced Dollar in English) aged 7, who comes to visit her for the funeral of her father. Tao is upset by Daole's distance, which she acknowledges is due to their cultural differences - a product of Jingsheng's fascination with globalization. Tao, knowing they are fated to be apart, decides to ride the slow train with Daole, instead of sending him on a plane back to Shanghai. As a parting gift, Tao makes Daole a set of keys for her house so that he can return to his mother's home whenever he wants.\n\nIn 2025, Daole (now currently called Dollar) is attending college in Australia. He is constantly fighting with his father over his desire to drop out of college and have the freedom he was never granted in his childhood. He meets Mia, his Chinese language teacher, an older woman for whom he develops feelings and eventually begins a relationship with. Dollar shares with Mia how he still carries the keys his mother gave him when he was a young boy, and that he fears she may die, even though they have not talked for years. Mia convinces him to fly back to China with her so that he can see Tao. The film ends with Tao dancing to \"[[Go West (song)|Go West]]\", recalling the beginning of the film when a young woman, she was dancing merrily with all of her then fellows (making waves with their arms, \"wave\" being incidentally the translation of the first name \"Tao\" in English), full of hope for a better life. Any reunion with Daole (Dollar) is not seen.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Zhao Tao]]<ref name=variety>{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/2014/film/news/chinas-jia-zhangke-plans-mountains-trek-1201185965/|title= China\u2019s Jia Zhangke Plans \u2018Mountains\u2019 Trek (EXCLUSIVE)|author= Patrick Frater|date= 19 May 2014|accessdate= 13 February 2015|work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n*[[Zhang Yi (actor)|Zhang Yi]]\n*Liang Jingdong\n*[[Dong Zijian]]\n*[[Sylvia Chang]]\n*Rong Zishan\n*Liang Yonghao\n*Liu Lu\n*Yuan Wenqian\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film earned {{CNY|32.22 million}} at the Chinese box office.<ref name=cbooo>{{cite web |url= http://www.cbooo.cn/m/627766|title= \u5c71\u6cb3\u6545\u4eba\uff082015\uff09|accessdate= 15 February 2016|work= cbooo.cn|language= Chinese}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\n''Mountains May Depart'' holds a 79/100 average on review aggregation site [[Metacritic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mountains-may-depart |title=''Mountains May Depart'' Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=24 January 2016}}</ref> [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote, \"Jia Zhang-ke\u2019s ''Mountains May Depart'' is a mysterious and in its way staggeringly ambitious piece of work from a film-maker whose creativity is evolving before our eyes.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/20/mountains-may-depart-review-jia-zhang-ke-scales-new-heights-with-futurist-drama|title= Mountains May Depart review: Jia Zhang-ke scales new heights with futurist drama|author= [[Peter Bradshaw]]|date= 20 May 2015|accessdate= 25 May 2015|work= [[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\nScott Foundas of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' states \"''Mountains May Depart'' is never less than a work of soaring ambition and deeply felt humanism, as Jia longs not so much to turn back the hands of time, but to ever so slightly slow them down.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/mountains-may-depart-cannes-film-review-1201501026/|title= Cannes Film Review: \u2018Mountains May Depart\u2019|author= Scott Foundas|date= 19 May 2015|accessdate=25 May 2015|work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Derek Elley]] of ''[[Film Business Asia]]'' gave it a 5 out of 10, calling the film a \"weakly written saga of friendship [that] goes way off the rails in the final part.\"<ref name=Elley>{{cite web |url= http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/mountains-may-depart|title= Mountains May Depart|author= [[Derek Elley]]|date= 21 May 2015|accessdate= 24 May 2015|work= [[Film Business Asia]]}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\n* \"[[Go West (song)|Go West]]\" (1993) by the [[Pet Shop Boys]] <ref name=\"LT\">{{in lang|fr}} Antoine Duplan, [http://www.letemps.ch/culture/2016/01/26/dela-montagnes-argent-ne-bonheur-chine \"\u00ab Au-del\u00e0 des montagnes \u00bb : l\u2019argent ne fait pas le bonheur de la Chine\"], ''[[Le Temps]]'', Tuesday 26 January 2016 (page visited on 3 February 2016).</ref>\n* \"[[Sally Yeh discography#1990|Take care]]\" ({{zh|\u73cd\u91cd}}, 1990) by [[Sally Yeh]] ({{zh|\u8449\u5029\u6587}})<ref name=LT/>\nGo West plays a prominent role in the film, as the film opens to a scene on New Year's Eve 1999 with Tao dancing to the song and closes in 2025 with a scene of Tao crying and dancing to the song near the old pagoda.

The first competition&mdash;often referred to as \"Ludum Dare Zero\"&mdash;was held in April 2002, with 18 participants. Its popularity turned the focus towards the competitions rather than the forum. The time limit was subsequently increased to 48 hours, because 24 hours were decided to be too few.<ref name=intel1>{{cite web|last=Boswell|first=Wendy|title=Get Your Game On with Ludum Dare: Interview with Mike Kasprzak (Part 1)|url=http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/09/30/get-your-game-on-with-ludum-dare-interview-with-mike-kasprzak-part-1|work=Intel|accessdate=December 15, 2013|date=September 30, 2013}}</ref> Since 2011 the competition has seen significant annual increases in numbers of game submissions, partly owing to the public awareness of [[Minecraft]] designer [[Markus Persson]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Peter|title=Ludum Dare for Rubyists: An Online 48 Hour Game Coding Competition|url=http://www.rubyinside.com/ludum-dare-for-rubyists-an-online-48-hour-game-coding-competition-5687.html|work=Ruby Inside|accessdate=December 15, 2013|date=December 13, 2011}}</ref> who has participated seven times.<ref>{{cite web|title=Notch|url=http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/author/notch/|work=Ludum Dare|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nUntil 2014, the event was very informal as the Ludum Dare team worked on it in their spare time. Due to the increasing number of contestants, long-time organizer Mike Kasprzak announced in September 2014 that he would attempt at setting up a business model allowing him to work full-time on the project.<ref name=\"ldfuture\">{{cite web|url=http://gamasutra.com/view/news/225663/Ludum_Dare_organizer_ponders_the_game_jams_future.php|work=Gamasutra|title=Ludum Dare organizer ponders the game jam's future|date=September 16, 2014}}</ref> Charging for Ludum Dare is however \"out of question\",<ref name=\"ldfuture\" /> and money is currently exclusively raised through donations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ludumdare.com/compo/2014/09/26/the-future-of-ludum-dare-part-3/|work=Ludum Dare|title=The Future of Ludum Dare (Part 3) \u2013 The Beginning|date=September 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring Ludum Dare 35 in April 2016, an announcement acknowledged various issues regarding the game jam's rating system. In particular, it explained that some users had attempted to artificially boost their game ratings with alternative accounts. As a consequence of this problem, future Ludum Dare events were indefinitely cancelled pending a replacement website being constructed for hosting the game jam.<ref>http://ludumdare.com/compo/2016/06/08/well-this-is-awkward-2/</ref> This led to a community backlash, and the game jam in August 2016 went ahead regardless, organized by website administrator and long-time community member ''sorceress''. In respect of the complaints previously raised, the community decided by referendum to forego the game rating phase after the game jam. So uniquely, there were no winners for that one event.<ref>http://ludumdare.com/compo/2016/06/09/august-ld-you-decide/</ref>\n\nStarting in Ludum Dare 44, the schedule was changed to run twice per year in April and October due to organizer Mike Kasprzak struggling to keep up<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/placeholder/results-for-ludum-dare-42|website=ldjam.com|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n== Competition structure ==\n\nCurrently, Ludum Dare is held two times a year.<ref>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/$120416/results-for-ludum-dare-43</ref> In the week preceding each competition suggested themes are subject to votes by prospective participants.

The Jam, which allows development teams, private source code and extended development time of 72 hours, takes place concurrently with the solo competition.<ref name=guide />\n\nA smaller competition called \"Mini Ludum Dare\" is held during months without a Ludum Dare. These are each hosted by a veteran participant who is free to decide the theme within which the games must fit.<ref name=intel2 /> The rules are generally the same as in Ludum Dare, but the 48-hour limitation is usually ignored in favor of late participation.\n\nEvery October Ludum Dare hosts the October Challenge, which challenges people to \"Finish a game,  take it to market, and earn $1\".<ref>{{cite web|title=October Challenge 2014|url=http://ludumdare.com/compo/2014/09/29/october-challenge-2014/|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}</ref> Participants have 31 days to upload a link to their game to the website.

The first competition&mdash;often referred to as \"Ludum Dare Zero\"&mdash;was held in April 2002, with 18 participants. Its popularity turned the focus towards the competitions rather than the forum. The time limit was subsequently increased to 48 hours, because 24 hours were decided to be too few.<ref name=intel1>{{cite web|last=Boswell|first=Wendy|title=Get Your Game On with Ludum Dare: Interview with Mike Kasprzak (Part 1)|url=http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/09/30/get-your-game-on-with-ludum-dare-interview-with-mike-kasprzak-part-1|work=Intel|accessdate=December 15, 2013|date=September 30, 2013}}</ref> Since 2011 the competition has seen significant annual increases in numbers of game submissions, partly owing to the public awareness of [[Minecraft]] designer [[Markus Persson]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Peter|title=Ludum Dare for Rubyists: An Online 48 Hour Game Coding Competition|url=http://www.rubyinside.com/ludum-dare-for-rubyists-an-online-48-hour-game-coding-competition-5687.html|work=Ruby Inside|accessdate=December 15, 2013|date=December 13, 2011}}</ref> who has participated seven times.<ref>{{cite web|title=Notch|url=http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/author/notch/|work=Ludum Dare|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nUntil 2014, the event was very informal as the Ludum Dare team worked on it in their spare time. Due to the increasing number of contestants, long-time organizer Mike Kasprzak announced in September 2014 that he would attempt at setting up a business model allowing him to work full-time on the project.<ref name=\"ldfuture\">{{cite web|url=http://gamasutra.com/view/news/225663/Ludum_Dare_organizer_ponders_the_game_jams_future.php|work=Gamasutra|title=Ludum Dare organizer ponders the game jam's future|date=September 16, 2014}}</ref> Charging for Ludum Dare is however \"out of question\",<ref name=\"ldfuture\" /> and money is currently exclusively raised through donations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ludumdare.com/compo/2014/09/26/the-future-of-ludum-dare-part-3/|work=Ludum Dare|title=The Future of Ludum Dare (Part 3) \u2013 The Beginning|date=September 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring Ludum Dare 35 in April 2016, an announcement acknowledged various issues regarding the game jam's rating system. In particular, it explained that some users had attempted to artificially boost their game ratings with alternative accounts. As a consequence of this problem, future Ludum Dare events were indefinitely cancelled pending a replacement website being constructed for hosting the game jam.<ref>http://ludumdare.com/compo/2016/06/08/well-this-is-awkward-2/</ref> This led to a community backlash, and the game jam in August 2016 went ahead regardless, organized by website administrator and long-time community member ''sorceress''. In respect of the complaints previously raised, the community decided by referendum to forego the game rating phase after the game jam. So uniquely, there were no winners for that one event.<ref>http://ludumdare.com/compo/2016/06/09/august-ld-you-decide/</ref>\n\nStarting in Ludum Dare 44, the schedule was changed to run twice per year in April and October due to organizer Mike Kasprzak struggling to keep up<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/placeholder/results-for-ludum-dare-42|website=ldjam.com|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n== Competition structure ==\n\nCurrently, Ludum Dare is held two times a year.<ref>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/$120416/results-for-ludum-dare-43</ref> In the week preceding each competition suggested themes are subject to votes by prospective participants. A theme is subsequently announced<ref name=intel3>{{cite web|last=Boswell|first=Wendy|title=Get Your Game On with Ludum Dare: Interview with Mike Kasprzak (Part 3)|url=http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/10/04/get-your-game-on-with-ludum-dare-interview-with-mike-kasprzak-part-3|work=Intel|accessdate=December 15, 2013|date=October 4, 2013}}</ref> before participants are given 48 hours to create a [[video game]] (although [[board games]] or similar are accepted<ref name=guide>{{cite web|title=Rules and Guide|url=http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/rules/|work=Ludum Dare|accessdate=December 4, 2014}}</ref>) that fits within it.  All game code and content must be created during the competition and by a single person, and [[source code]] is encouraged to be included. During the event many participants record multiple [[screenshot]]s of the development of their game to later produce a [[time-lapse]] video.<ref name=timelapse /> In addition, many broadcast a live [[streaming video|video stream]],<ref name=intel2>{{cite web|last=Boswell|first=Wendy|title=Get Your Game On with Ludum Dare: Interview with Mike Kasprzak (Part 2)|url=http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/10/02/get-your-game-on-with-ludum-dare-interview-with-mike-kasprzak-part-2|work=Intel|accessdate=December 15, 2013|date=October 2, 2013}}</ref> particularly since April 2013, when a widget showing Ludum Dare video streams hosted on [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] was added to the Ludum Dare website.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kasprzak|first=Mike|title=Streaming Widget Alpha 2|url=http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2013/04/13/streaming-widget-alpha-2/|work=Ludum Dare|accessdate=December 15, 2013|date=April 13, 2013}}</ref> After the end of the competition participants are given three weeks to play and rate other submitted games to determine the winners.<ref name=intel3 /> There are no physical or cash prizes, but each participant retains full ownership of their game<ref name=guide/>&mdash;some have achieved financial success after developing their initial submission.<ref name=intel2 />\n\nAs of the 18th edition of the competition, which was held in August 2010, a more relaxed version called the \"Jam\" was introduced. The Jam, which allows development teams, private source code and extended development time of 72 hours, takes place concurrently with the solo competition.<ref name=guide />\n\nA smaller competition called \"Mini Ludum Dare\" is held during months without a Ludum Dare. These are each hosted by a veteran participant who is free to decide the theme within which the games must fit.<ref name=intel2 /> The rules are generally the same as in Ludum Dare, but the 48-hour limitation is usually ignored in favor of late participation.\n\nEvery October Ludum Dare hosts the October Challenge, which challenges people to \"Finish a game,  take it to market, and earn $1\".<ref>{{cite web|title=October Challenge 2014|url=http://ludumdare.com/compo/2014/09/29/october-challenge-2014/|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}</ref> Participants have 31 days to upload a link to their game to the website. The event is not competitive and is just a small event to encourage game development from people who do not make money from their games regularly.\n\n== Results ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2|No. !! rowspan=2|Month !! rowspan=2|Theme (bonus) !! colspan=2|Participants !! colspan=2|Compo winner !! colspan=2|Jam winner !! rowspan=2|Ref.\n|-\n!

It borders four other London boroughs - [[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet]] to the east of ancient [[Watling Street|Watling Street (now the A5 road)]], [[London Borough of Brent|Brent]] to the south-east, [[London Borough of Ealing|Ealing]] to the south and [[London Borough of Hillingdon|Hillingdon]] to the west - plus the [[Hertfordshire]] districts of [[Three Rivers District|Three Rivers]] and [[Hertsmere]] to the north. The local authority is [[Harrow London Borough Council]]. The London borough was formed in 1965, based on boundaries that had been established in 1934. The borough is made up of three towns: [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] proper, [[Pinner]], and [[Stanmore]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Harrow1961.svg|thumb|left|Harrow within Middlesex in 1961]]\nHarrow Urban District was formed in 1934 as an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] of [[Middlesex]] by the [[Local Government Act 1929|Middlesex Review Order 1934]], as a merger of the former area of [[Harrow on the Hill Urban District]], [[Hendon Rural District]] and [[Wealdstone Urban District]]. The local authority was Harrow Urban District Council.\n\nThe urban district gained the status of [[municipal borough]] on 4 May 1954 and the urban district council became Harrow Borough Council. The 50th anniversary of the incorporation as a borough was celebrated in April 2004, which included a visit by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].\n\nIn 1965 the municipal borough was abolished and its former area was transferred to [[Greater London]] from Middlesex under the [[London Government Act 1963]] to form the London Borough of Harrow. It is the only London borough<!-- Note the City of London is not a London borough --> to replicate exactly the unchanged boundaries of a single former district. This was probably because its population was large enough. According to the 1961 census it had a population of 209,080, making it the largest local government district in Middlesex.\n\n==Demographics==\n;Location\nIts site on and near the greenbelt and ease of access to [[central London]] (20 minutes by train to [[Marylebone railway station|Marylebone]] and 12 minutes to [[Euston railway station|Euston]] via [[West Midlands Trains]]) make Harrow a convenient place to live. Rising property prices in all London areas have helped to see a large increase in property redevelopment of its existing Edwardian and 1920s to 1940s housing stock.\n\n;Ethnicity\nHarrow is a diverse borough, having 63.8% of its population from the BME (Black and Minority Ethnic) communities, with the largest group being of Indian ethnicity (specifically those from [[Gujarat]] and [[South India]]). The borough can also claim to have the largest concentration of [[Sri Lankan Tamil people|Sri Lankan Tamils]] in the UK and Ireland as well as having the highest density of [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] [[Hindus]] as well as [[Jains]] in the UK.<ref>[http://www.london.gov.uk/gangs/projects/harrow/index.jsp London against gun and knife crime] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184646/http://www.london.gov.uk/gangs/projects/harrow/index.jsp |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Ethnicity===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ethnic Group\n!colspan=\"2\"|2001<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/construct/submit.asp?forward=yes&menuopt=201&subcomp= |title=KS006 - Ethnic group  |publisher=NOMIS |accessdate=30 January 2016}}</ref>\n!colspan=\"2\"|2011<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/QS201EW/view/1946157259?cols=measures |title=Ethnic Group by measures |publisher=NOMIS |accessdate=8 January 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n!Number\n!%\n!Number\n!%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | White: British || 103,207 || % || 73,826 || 30.8%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | White: Irish || 9,057 || % || 7,336 || 3.0%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | White: Gypsy or Irish Traveller || || || 181 || 0.07%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | White: Other || 9,279 || % || 19,648 || 8.2%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | '''White: Total''' || '''121,543''' || '''%''' || '''100,991''' || '''42.07%'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Asian or Asian British: Indian || 45,310 || % || 63,051 || 26.3%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Asian or Asian British: Pakistani || 4,317|| % || 7,797 || 3.2%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Asian or Asian British: Bangladeshi || 953 || % || 1,378 || 0.5%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Asian or Asian British: Chinese || 2,567 || % || 2,629 || 1.0%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Asian or Asian British: Other Asian || 10,734 || % || 26,953 || 11.2%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | '''Asian or Asian British: Total''' || '''61,314''' || '''%''' || '''101,808''' || '''42.2%'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Black or Black British: African || 5,656 || % || 8,526 || 3.5%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Black or Black British: Caribbean || 6,116 || % || 6,812 || 2.8%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Black or Black British: Other Black || 931 || % || 4,370 || 1.8%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | '''Black or Black British: Total''' || '''12,703''' || '''%''' || '''19,708''' || '''8.1%'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Mixed: White and Black Caribbean || 1,371 || % || 2,344 || 0.9%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Mixed: White and Black African || 633 || % || 1,053 || 0.4%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Mixed: White and Asian || 2,018 || % || 3,417 || 1.4%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Mixed: Other Mixed || 1,818 || % || 2,685 || 1.1%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | '''Mixed: Total''' || '''5,840''' || '''%''' || '''9,499''' || '''3.8%'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Other: Arab || || || 3,708 || 1.5%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Other: Any other ethnic group || 2,847 || % || 3,342 || 1.3%\n|-5\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | '''Other: Total''' || '''2,847''' || '''%''' || '''7,050''' || '''2.8%'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | '''Black, Asian, and minority ethnic: Total''' || '''85,271''' || '''%''' || '''138,065''' || '''57.93%'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | '''Total''' || '''206,814''' || '''100.00%''' || '''239,056''' || '''100.00%'''\n|}\n\n{{Historical populations\n|type = UK\n|title = Population\n|footnote = Source: [http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TPop&u_id=10064028&c_id=10001043&add=N ''A Vision of Britain through time, citing Census population'']\n|1801|3240\n|1811|3969\n|1821|4383\n|1831|5342\n|1841|5829\n|1851|5980\n|1861|7424\n|1871|8869\n|1881|10313\n|1891|12231\n|1901|22683\n|1911|42065\n|1921|64431\n|1931|98694\n|1941|146617\n|1951|217811\n|1961|210424\n|1971|203309\n|1981|196147\n|1991|203769\n|2001|207389\n|2011|239056\n}}\n\nWards with the highest white British population were:\n*Pinner\n*Pinner South (a long-stretched ward covering Pinner Village, the area west of North Harrow and Rayners Lane, and east of [[Eastcote]])\n*Stanmore Park (an area mostly covering [[Stanmore]])\n\nThe lowest wards meanwhile were:\n*Kenton East (the area west of Honeypot Lane, bordering Kenton Lane),\n*Queensbury (the area north of the station, around Honeypot Lane)\n\nSince 2005, on the last Sunday in June Harrow Council hosts ''Under One Sky'' - Harrow's largest festival, to celebrate and the joint communities of Harrow.

Hatch End Cricket Club previously played at Shaftesbury playing fields in Hatch End but following an arson attack on their clubhouse and a subsequent failure to raise enough funds to build a new one, the club moved to Elstree in 2011.\n\nHarrow also had a professional [[rugby league]] team when [[London Broncos]] played at The Hive Stadium in 2014 and 2015. The club relocated to Ealing from 2016 onwards.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:Harrow_London_UK_labelled_ward_map_2002.svg|thumb|A map showing the wards of Harrow since 2002]]\nHarrow is divided into 21 [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]], each represented by three councillors on [[Harrow London Borough Council]]. After the most recent council elections, the borough is controlled by the Labour party. The number of councillors are as follows: Labour 35, Conservative 28.<ref>[http://www.harrow.gov.uk/www2/mgMemberIndex.aspx?FN=PARTY&VW=LIST&PIC=0 List of Harrow Councillors] at www.harrow.gov.uk</ref>\n\n==Education==\n{{see also|List of schools in Harrow}}\nThe borough is often perceived as having a good educational record, and features many state-funded primary and secondary schools as well as a handful of large tertiary colleges. For a long time the secondary schools of Harrow did not feature integrated sixth-form education, with all school leavers having to join the large tertiary colleges such as [[Harrow College]], Stanmore College or [[St Dominic's Sixth Form College]]. There have been critics of the tertiary colleges, with many arguing the standard of education does not continue the standard set by the Borough's secondary schools. Indeed, Harrow suffers a significant number of pupils leaving the Borough for their tertiary education. However, as of 2005-2006 session, select Harrow secondary schools introduced sixth forms in the hope to retain more of the pupils and to provide them an alternative to the large tertiary colleges. From September 2010, the primary sector was modified to enable transfer to secondary education at age 11 in line with other London Boroughs.<ref name=\"harrow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harrow.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?categoryID=49&documentID=1361|title=School reorganisation to change the ages of transfer|year=2009|publisher=London borough of Harrow|accessdate=2009-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417122116/http://www.harrow.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?categoryID=49&documentID=1361|archive-date=17 April 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Borough has a Music Service which provides instrumental tuition for 15% of all Harrow state sector pupils (the national figure is 8% of all state pupils receiving instrumental tuition) and a range of ensemble opportunities for pupils.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harrowmusicservice.org/|title=Harrow Music Service|author=|date=|website=Harrow Music Service|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe independent schools of the Borough are dominated by the presence of [[Harrow School]] and [[John Lyon School]] for boys and [[North London Collegiate School]] which consistently rank as among the best schools in the country. Notable independent primary schools include [[Orley Farm School]] and Reddiford School, both of which are [[co-educational]].\n\nThere are also a number of [[voluntary aided school]]s in the Borough. These include: [[Salvatorian College]] (Roman Catholic, Boys), Sacred Heart Language College (Roman Catholic, Girls) and Moriah Jewish Day School (Jewish, Co-ed).\n\nThere are two [[special needs]] high schools; Kingsley High School (Co-ed) and Shaftesbury High School (Co-ed).\n\nOther state secondary schools in the London Borough of Harrow are: Whitefriars High School (Co-ed); Bentley Wood High School (Girls); [[Canons High School]] (Co-ed); [[Harrow High School]] (Co-ed); [[Hatch End High School]] (Co-ed); [[Nower Hill High School]] (Co-ed); [[Park High School, Stanmore|Park High School]] (Co-ed); [[Rooks Heath College]](Co-ed); [[Whitmore High School]] (Co-ed).

It is located near the northwestern extremity of the modern-day network, with 4 lines serving the area. The Bakerloo and Jubilee lines terminate in the borough, at [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] and [[Stanmore]] respectively. Meanwhile, the Piccadilly and Metropolitan lines pass through the southern edge of the borough on shared track before both terminating at [[Uxbridge]]. The [[Northern line]] terminates just outside Harrow at [[Edgware tube station]] in the [[London Borough of Barnet]].\n\nThe [[London Overground]] also serves the borough, sharing track with the Bakerloo line between Queens Park and [[Harrow & Wealdstone station|Harrow & Wealdstone]] before it continues beyond the latter station to eventually terminate at Watford Junction.\n\nThe numerous [[National Rail]], [[London Overground]] and [[London Underground]] stations in the borough are:\n* [[Canons Park tube station|Canons Park]]\n* [[Harrow & Wealdstone station|Harrow & Wealdstone]]\n* [[Harrow-on-the-Hill station|Harrow-on-the-Hill]]\n* [[Hatch End railway station|Hatch End]]\n* [[Headstone Lane railway station|Headstone Lane]]\n* [[North Harrow tube station|North Harrow]]\n* [[Pinner tube station|Pinner]]\n* [[Rayners Lane tube station|Rayners Lane]]\n* [[South Harrow tube station|South Harrow]]\n* [[Stanmore tube station|Stanmore]]\n* [[Sudbury Hill tube station|Sudbury Hill]]\n* [[Sudbury Hill Harrow railway station|Sudbury Hill Harrow]]\n* [[West Harrow tube station|West Harrow]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:London Opportunity Areas.png|thumb|300px|right|Map showing the planning context of Ealing's 'Opportunity Area' in the [[Mayor of London]]'s strategic [[London Plan]] for high-density [[brown field]] development]] -->\n\nIn March 2011, the main forms of transport that residents used to travel to work were: driving a car or van, 27.5% of all residents aged 16\u201374; underground, metro, light rail, tram, 5.9%; bus, minibus or coach, 5.9%; train, 4.5%; on foot, 4.3%; work mainly at or from home, 3.5%; passenger in a car or van, 1.6%.<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 Census: QS701EW Method of travel to work, local authorities in England and Wales|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-and-quick-statistics-for-wards-and-output-areas-in-england-and-wales/rft-qs701ew.xls|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=23 November 2013}} Percentages are of all residents aged 16-74 including those not in employment.

It borders four other London boroughs - [[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet]] to the east of ancient [[Watling Street|Watling Street (now the A5 road)]], [[London Borough of Brent|Brent]] to the south-east, [[London Borough of Ealing|Ealing]] to the south and [[London Borough of Hillingdon|Hillingdon]] to the west - plus the [[Hertfordshire]] districts of [[Three Rivers District|Three Rivers]] and [[Hertsmere]] to the north. The local authority is [[Harrow London Borough Council]]. The London borough was formed in 1965, based on boundaries that had been established in 1934. The borough is made up of three towns: [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] proper, [[Pinner]], and [[Stanmore]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Harrow1961.svg|thumb|left|Harrow within Middlesex in 1961]]\nHarrow Urban District was formed in 1934 as an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] of [[Middlesex]] by the [[Local Government Act 1929|Middlesex Review Order 1934]], as a merger of the former area of [[Harrow on the Hill Urban District]], [[Hendon Rural District]] and [[Wealdstone Urban District]]. The local authority was Harrow Urban District Council.\n\nThe urban district gained the status of [[municipal borough]] on 4 May 1954 and the urban district council became Harrow Borough Council. The 50th anniversary of the incorporation as a borough was celebrated in April 2004, which included a visit by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].\n\nIn 1965 the municipal borough was abolished and its former area was transferred to [[Greater London]] from Middlesex under the [[London Government Act 1963]] to form the London Borough of Harrow. It is the only London borough<!-- Note the City of London is not a London borough --> to replicate exactly the unchanged boundaries of a single former district. This was probably because its population was large enough. According to the 1961 census it had a population of 209,080, making it the largest local government district in Middlesex.\n\n==Demographics==\n;Location\nIts site on and near the greenbelt and ease of access to [[central London]] (20 minutes by train to [[Marylebone railway station|Marylebone]] and 12 minutes to [[Euston railway station|Euston]] via [[West Midlands Trains]]) make Harrow a convenient place to live. Rising property prices in all London areas have helped to see a large increase in property redevelopment of its existing Edwardian and 1920s to 1940s housing stock.\n\n;Ethnicity\nHarrow is a diverse borough, having 63.8% of its population from the BME (Black and Minority Ethnic) communities, with the largest group being of Indian ethnicity (specifically those from [[Gujarat]] and [[South India]]). The borough can also claim to have the largest concentration of [[Sri Lankan Tamil people|Sri Lankan Tamils]] in the UK and Ireland as well as having the highest density of [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] [[Hindus]] as well as [[Jains]] in the UK.<ref>[http://www.london.gov.uk/gangs/projects/harrow/index.jsp London against gun and knife crime] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184646/http://www.london.gov.uk/gangs/projects/harrow/index.jsp |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Ethnicity===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ethnic Group\n!colspan=\"2\"|2001<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/construct/submit.asp?forward=yes&menuopt=201&subcomp= |title=KS006 - Ethnic group  |publisher=NOMIS |accessdate=30 January 2016}}</ref>\n!colspan=\"2\"|2011<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/QS201EW/view/1946157259?cols=measures |title=Ethnic Group by measures |publisher=NOMIS |accessdate=8 January 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n!Number\n!%\n!Number\n!%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | White: British || 103,207 || % || 73,826 || 30.8%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | White: Irish || 9,057 || % || 7,336 || 3.0%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | White: Gypsy or Irish Traveller || || || 181 || 0.07%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | White: Other || 9,279 || % || 19,648 || 8.2%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | '''White: Total''' || '''121,543''' || '''%''' || '''100,991''' || '''42.07%'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Asian or Asian British: Indian || 45,310 || % || 63,051 || 26.3%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Asian or Asian British: Pakistani || 4,317|| % || 7,797 || 3.2%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Asian or Asian British: Bangladeshi || 953 || % || 1,378 || 0.5%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Asian or Asian British: Chinese || 2,567 || % || 2,629 || 1.0%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Asian or Asian British: Other Asian || 10,734 || % || 26,953 || 11.2%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | '''Asian or Asian British: Total''' || '''61,314''' || '''%''' || '''101,808''' || '''42.2%'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Black or Black British: African || 5,656 || % || 8,526 || 3.5%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Black or Black British: Caribbean || 6,116 || % || 6,812 || 2.8%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Black or Black British: Other Black || 931 || % || 4,370 || 1.8%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | '''Black or Black British: Total''' || '''12,703''' || '''%''' || '''19,708''' || '''8.1%'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Mixed: White and Black Caribbean || 1,371 || % || 2,344 || 0.9%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Mixed: White and Black African || 633 || % || 1,053 || 0.4%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Mixed: White and Asian || 2,018 || % || 3,417 || 1.4%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Mixed: Other Mixed || 1,818 || % || 2,685 || 1.1%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | '''Mixed: Total''' || '''5,840''' || '''%''' || '''9,499''' || '''3.8%'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Other: Arab || || || 3,708 || 1.5%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | Other: Any other ethnic group || 2,847 || % || 3,342 || 1.3%\n|-5\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | '''Other: Total''' || '''2,847''' || '''%''' || '''7,050''' || '''2.8%'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | '''Black, Asian, and minority ethnic: Total''' || '''85,271''' || '''%''' || '''138,065''' || '''57.93%'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" | '''Total''' || '''206,814''' || '''100.00%''' || '''239,056''' || '''100.00%'''\n|}\n\n{{Historical populations\n|type = UK\n|title = Population\n|footnote = Source: [http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TPop&u_id=10064028&c_id=10001043&add=N ''A Vision of Britain through time, citing Census population'']\n|1801|3240\n|1811|3969\n|1821|4383\n|1831|5342\n|1841|5829\n|1851|5980\n|1861|7424\n|1871|8869\n|1881|10313\n|1891|12231\n|1901|22683\n|1911|42065\n|1921|64431\n|1931|98694\n|1941|146617\n|1951|217811\n|1961|210424\n|1971|203309\n|1981|196147\n|1991|203769\n|2001|207389\n|2011|239056\n}}\n\nWards with the highest white British population were:\n*Pinner\n*Pinner South (a long-stretched ward covering Pinner Village, the area west of North Harrow and Rayners Lane, and east of [[Eastcote]])\n*Stanmore Park (an area mostly covering [[Stanmore]])\n\nThe lowest wards meanwhile were:\n*Kenton East (the area west of Honeypot Lane, bordering Kenton Lane),\n*Queensbury (the area north of the station, around Honeypot Lane)\n\nSince 2005, on the last Sunday in June Harrow Council hosts ''Under One Sky'' - Harrow's largest festival, to celebrate and the joint communities of Harrow.

For a long time the secondary schools of Harrow did not feature integrated sixth-form education, with all school leavers having to join the large tertiary colleges such as [[Harrow College]], Stanmore College or [[St Dominic's Sixth Form College]]. There have been critics of the tertiary colleges, with many arguing the standard of education does not continue the standard set by the Borough's secondary schools. Indeed, Harrow suffers a significant number of pupils leaving the Borough for their tertiary education. However, as of 2005-2006 session, select Harrow secondary schools introduced sixth forms in the hope to retain more of the pupils and to provide them an alternative to the large tertiary colleges. From September 2010, the primary sector was modified to enable transfer to secondary education at age 11 in line with other London Boroughs.<ref name=\"harrow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harrow.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?categoryID=49&documentID=1361|title=School reorganisation to change the ages of transfer|year=2009|publisher=London borough of Harrow|accessdate=2009-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417122116/http://www.harrow.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?categoryID=49&documentID=1361|archive-date=17 April 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Borough has a Music Service which provides instrumental tuition for 15% of all Harrow state sector pupils (the national figure is 8% of all state pupils receiving instrumental tuition) and a range of ensemble opportunities for pupils.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harrowmusicservice.org/|title=Harrow Music Service|author=|date=|website=Harrow Music Service|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe independent schools of the Borough are dominated by the presence of [[Harrow School]] and [[John Lyon School]] for boys and [[North London Collegiate School]] which consistently rank as among the best schools in the country.

The Bakerloo and Jubilee lines terminate in the borough, at [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] and [[Stanmore]] respectively.

FAT file systems instead used alternating tables, as this allowed recovery of the file system if the media was ejected during a write (which occurs frequently in practice with removable media). The optional [[TexFAT]] component adds support for additional backup tables and maps, but may not be supported.\n\nThe exFAT format allows individual files larger than 4&nbsp;GiB, facilitating long continuous recording of HD video which can exceed the 4&nbsp;GiB limit in less than an hour. Current digital cameras using FAT32 will break the video files into multiple segments of approximately 2 or 4&nbsp;GiB. With the increase of capacity and the increase of data being transferred, the write operation needs to be made more efficient. SDXC cards, running at UHS-I have a minimum guaranteed write speed of 10&nbsp;MBps and exFAT plays a factor in achieving that throughput through the reduction of the file system overhead in cluster allocation. This is achieved through the introduction of a cluster bitmap and elimination (or reduction) of writes to the FAT. A single bit in the directory record indicates that the file is contiguous, telling the exFAT driver to ignore the FAT. This optimization is analogous to an [[Extent (file systems)|extent]] in other file systems, except that it only applies to whole files, as opposed to contiguous parts of files.\n\n== Adoption ==\nexFAT is supported in [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] with update KB955704,<ref name=\"xpkb\" /> [[Windows Embedded CE 6.0]], [[Windows Vista#Service Pack 1|Windows Vista with Service Pack 1]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/pages/windows-vista-service-pack-1-beta-whitepaper.aspx#_Toc175944550|title=Vista SP1 Whitepaper|date=August 28, 2007|accessdate=August 28, 2007|first=Brandon|last=LeBlanc|publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref> [[Windows Server 2008]],<ref name=\"Server2008exFATsupport\" /> [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8]], [[Windows Server 2008 R2|Windows Server 2008 R2 (except Windows Server 2008 Server Core)]], [[Windows 10]], [[Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X]] starting from 10.6.5 and [[iPadOS]].<ref name=\"Mac OS X 10.6.5 Notes\" /><ref name=\"fsck_exfat man\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/06/07/how-to-use-external-storage-on-ipad-and-iphone-with-ios-13|title=How to use external storage on iPad and iPhone with iOS 13|last=Friday|first=rew O'Hara|last2=June 07|website=AppleInsider|language=en|access-date=2020-02-26|last3=2019|last4=PT|first4=12:11 pm}}</ref>\n\nCompanies can integrate exFAT into a specific group of consumer devices, including cameras, camcorders, and digital photo frames for a [[flat fee]].

For each file, exFAT uses two separate 64-bit length fields in the directory: the Valid Data Length (VDL) which indicates the real size of the file, and the physical data length.\n\nTo provide improvement in the allocation of cluster storage for a new file, Microsoft incorporated a method to pre-allocate contiguous clusters and bypass the use of updating the FAT table and on December 10, 2013 the US patent office granted patent US8606830.<ref>{{Cite patent|US|8606830}}, ''\"Contiguous File Allocation in an Extensible File System\"''</ref> One feature of exFAT (used in the exFAT implementation within embedded systems) provides atomic transactions for the multiple steps of updating the file system metadata. The feature, called ''Transaction Safe FAT'', or [[TexFAT]], was granted a patent by the US patent office under US7613738 on November 3, 2009.<ref>{{Cite patent|US|7613738}}, ''\"FAT Directory Structure for use in Transaction Safe File System\"''</ref>\n\n=== Directory file set ===\nexFAT and the rest of the FAT family of file systems does not use indexes for file names, unlike NTFS which uses [[B-trees]] for file searching. When a file is accessed, the directory must be sequentially searched until a match is found. For file names shorter than 16 characters in length, one file name record is required but the entire file is represented by three 32-byte directory records. This is called a directory file set, and a 256 MiB sub-directory can hold up to 2,796,202 file sets. (If files have longer names, this number will decrease but this is the maximum based on the minimum three-record file set.) To help improve the sequential searching of the directories (including the root) a hash value of the file name is derived for each file and stored in the directory record. When searching for a file, the file name is first converted to upper case using the upcase table (file names are case insensitive) and then hashed using a proprietary patented algorithm into a 16-bit (2 byte) hash value. Each record in the directory is searched by comparing the hash value. When a match is found, the file names are compared to ensure that the proper file was located in case of hash collisions. This improves performance because only 2 bytes have to be compared for each file. This significantly reduces the CPU cycles because most file names are more than 2 characters (bytes) in size and virtually every comparison is performed on only 2 bytes at a time until the intended file is located.\n\n=== Metadata and checksums ===\nexFAT introduces metadata integrity through the use of checksums. There are three checksums currently in use. The Volume Boot Record (VBR) is a 12 sector region that contains the boot records, BIOS Parameter Block (BPB), OEM parameters and the checksum sector. (There are two VBR type regions, the main VBR and the backup VBR.) The checksum sector is a checksum of the previous 11 sectors, with the exception of three bytes in the boot sector (Flags and percent used). This provides integrity of the VBR by determining if the VBR was modified. The most common cause could be a boot sector virus, but this would also catch any other corruption to the VBR. A second checksum is used for the upcase table. This is a static table and should never change. Any corruption in the table could prevent files from being located because this table is used to convert the filenames to upper case when searching to locate a file. The third checksum is in the directory file sets. Multiple directory records are used to define a single file and this is called a file set. This file set has metadata including the file name, time stamps, attributes, address of first cluster location of the data, file lengths, and the file name. A checksum is taken over the entire file set and a mismatch would occur if the directory file set was accidentally or maliciously changed. When the file system is mounted, and the integrity check is conducted, these hashes are verified. Mounting also includes comparison of the version of the exFAT file system by the driver to make sure the driver is compatible with the file system it is trying to mount, and to make sure that none of the required directory records are missing (for example, the directory record for the upcase table and Allocation Bitmap are required and the file system can't run if they are missing). If any of these checks fail, the file system should not be mounted, although in certain cases it may mount read-only.\n\nThe file system provides extensibility through template-based metadata definitions using generic layouts and generic patterns.<ref>{{Cite patent|US|2009164440|Patent Application}}, ''\"Quick Filename Lookup Using Name Hash\"''; Microsoft Corp; contains exFAT specification revision 1.00.

FAT file systems instead used alternating tables, as this allowed recovery of the file system if the media was ejected during a write (which occurs frequently in practice with removable media). The optional [[TexFAT]] component adds support for additional backup tables and maps, but may not be supported.\n\nThe exFAT format allows individual files larger than 4&nbsp;GiB, facilitating long continuous recording of HD video which can exceed the 4&nbsp;GiB limit in less than an hour. Current digital cameras using FAT32 will break the video files into multiple segments of approximately 2 or 4&nbsp;GiB. With the increase of capacity and the increase of data being transferred, the write operation needs to be made more efficient. SDXC cards, running at UHS-I have a minimum guaranteed write speed of 10&nbsp;MBps and exFAT plays a factor in achieving that throughput through the reduction of the file system overhead in cluster allocation. This is achieved through the introduction of a cluster bitmap and elimination (or reduction) of writes to the FAT. A single bit in the directory record indicates that the file is contiguous, telling the exFAT driver to ignore the FAT. This optimization is analogous to an [[Extent (file systems)|extent]] in other file systems, except that it only applies to whole files, as opposed to contiguous parts of files.\n\n== Adoption ==\nexFAT is supported in [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] with update KB955704,<ref name=\"xpkb\" /> [[Windows Embedded CE 6.0]], [[Windows Vista#Service Pack 1|Windows Vista with Service Pack 1]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/pages/windows-vista-service-pack-1-beta-whitepaper.aspx#_Toc175944550|title=Vista SP1 Whitepaper|date=August 28, 2007|accessdate=August 28, 2007|first=Brandon|last=LeBlanc|publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref> [[Windows Server 2008]],<ref name=\"Server2008exFATsupport\" /> [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8]], [[Windows Server 2008 R2|Windows Server 2008 R2 (except Windows Server 2008 Server Core)]], [[Windows 10]], [[Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X]] starting from 10.6.5 and [[iPadOS]].<ref name=\"Mac OS X 10.6.5 Notes\" /><ref name=\"fsck_exfat man\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/06/07/how-to-use-external-storage-on-ipad-and-iphone-with-ios-13|title=How to use external storage on iPad and iPhone with iOS 13|last=Friday|first=rew O'Hara|last2=June 07|website=AppleInsider|language=en|access-date=2020-02-26|last3=2019|last4=PT|first4=12:11 pm}}</ref>\n\nCompanies can integrate exFAT into a specific group of consumer devices, including cameras, camcorders, and digital photo frames for a [[flat fee]].

For each file, exFAT uses two separate 64-bit length fields in the directory: the Valid Data Length (VDL) which indicates the real size of the file, and the physical data length.\n\nTo provide improvement in the allocation of cluster storage for a new file, Microsoft incorporated a method to pre-allocate contiguous clusters and bypass the use of updating the FAT table and on December 10, 2013 the US patent office granted patent US8606830.<ref>{{Cite patent|US|8606830}}, ''\"Contiguous File Allocation in an Extensible File System\"''</ref> One feature of exFAT (used in the exFAT implementation within embedded systems) provides atomic transactions for the multiple steps of updating the file system metadata. The feature, called ''Transaction Safe FAT'', or [[TexFAT]], was granted a patent by the US patent office under US7613738 on November 3, 2009.<ref>{{Cite patent|US|7613738}}, ''\"FAT Directory Structure for use in Transaction Safe File System\"''</ref>\n\n=== Directory file set ===\nexFAT and the rest of the FAT family of file systems does not use indexes for file names, unlike NTFS which uses [[B-trees]] for file searching. When a file is accessed, the directory must be sequentially searched until a match is found. For file names shorter than 16 characters in length, one file name record is required but the entire file is represented by three 32-byte directory records. This is called a directory file set, and a 256 MiB sub-directory can hold up to 2,796,202 file sets. (If files have longer names, this number will decrease but this is the maximum based on the minimum three-record file set.) To help improve the sequential searching of the directories (including the root) a hash value of the file name is derived for each file and stored in the directory record. When searching for a file, the file name is first converted to upper case using the upcase table (file names are case insensitive) and then hashed using a proprietary patented algorithm into a 16-bit (2 byte) hash value. Each record in the directory is searched by comparing the hash value. When a match is found, the file names are compared to ensure that the proper file was located in case of hash collisions. This improves performance because only 2 bytes have to be compared for each file. This significantly reduces the CPU cycles because most file names are more than 2 characters (bytes) in size and virtually every comparison is performed on only 2 bytes at a time until the intended file is located.\n\n=== Metadata and checksums ===\nexFAT introduces metadata integrity through the use of checksums. There are three checksums currently in use. The Volume Boot Record (VBR) is a 12 sector region that contains the boot records, BIOS Parameter Block (BPB), OEM parameters and the checksum sector. (There are two VBR type regions, the main VBR and the backup VBR.) The checksum sector is a checksum of the previous 11 sectors, with the exception of three bytes in the boot sector (Flags and percent used). This provides integrity of the VBR by determining if the VBR was modified. The most common cause could be a boot sector virus, but this would also catch any other corruption to the VBR. A second checksum is used for the upcase table. This is a static table and should never change. Any corruption in the table could prevent files from being located because this table is used to convert the filenames to upper case when searching to locate a file. The third checksum is in the directory file sets. Multiple directory records are used to define a single file and this is called a file set. This file set has metadata including the file name, time stamps, attributes, address of first cluster location of the data, file lengths, and the file name. A checksum is taken over the entire file set and a mismatch would occur if the directory file set was accidentally or maliciously changed. When the file system is mounted, and the integrity check is conducted, these hashes are verified. Mounting also includes comparison of the version of the exFAT file system by the driver to make sure the driver is compatible with the file system it is trying to mount, and to make sure that none of the required directory records are missing (for example, the directory record for the upcase table and Allocation Bitmap are required and the file system can't run if they are missing). If any of these checks fail, the file system should not be mounted, although in certain cases it may mount read-only.\n\nThe file system provides extensibility through template-based metadata definitions using generic layouts and generic patterns.<ref>{{Cite patent|US|2009164440|Patent Application}}, ''\"Quick Filename Lookup Using Name Hash\"''; Microsoft Corp; contains exFAT specification revision 1.00.

The offsets for the FAT and the cluster heap is adjustable at format-time, so that writes to these areas will happen in as few flash blocks as possible.\n* An \"OEM Parameters\" field can be used to record features such as block size of the underlying storage.<ref name=CE-flash>{{cite web |title=OEM Parameter Definition with exFAT (Windows Embedded CE 6.0) |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ee490605(v=winembedded.60) |website=Microsoft documentation |language=en-us}}</ref>\n* The lack of a [[Journaling file system|journal]], so that less data are written\n\nHowever, Microsoft's own implementation on Windows is not truly optimized for flash drives.

The largest theoretical file size would be 16&nbsp;EiB\u22121&nbsp;byte, the same as in NTFS. However, since the true theoretical maximum volume size under the current specification cannot exceed 128&nbsp;PiB, a file can never reach that file length. Another reason for the limit is that current IDE/ATA disk addressing is LBA-48, and uses a 48 bit block address to address a sector. A 512 byte sector size would make the maximum addressable file system 512 \u00d7 2{{sup|48}} = 2{{sup|57}}, which is 128&nbsp;PiB. In other words, the 128&nbsp;PiB limit on the architecture is a hardware restriction. This scenario does not include AF (4k sectors) and exFAT is limited to 128&nbsp;PiB regardless of sector size based on the specification.\n</ref>\n\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_Size_Volume\">The theoretical maximum volume size is defined by up to 2{{sup|32}} \u2212 11 possible clusters with up to 2{{sup|25}} \u2212 1 bytes per cluster = ca. 128 PiB.
