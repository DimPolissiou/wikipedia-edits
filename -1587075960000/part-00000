Thus they created a female sidekick for the Joker; she would become his love interest. [[Arleen Sorkin]], a former star of the soap opera ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', appeared in a dream sequence on that series in which she wore a [[jester]] costume; They used this scene as an inspiration for Quinn.<ref>{{cite web| first = Pat | last = Jankiewicz| title = Quinn-tessentials.

Written and drawn by Dini and Timm, the comic book is told in the style and continuity of ''Batman: The Animated Series''. It describes Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel, Ph.D. as an [[Arkham Asylum]] [[Psychiatrist|psychologist]] who falls in love with the Joker and becomes his accomplice and on-again, off-again girlfriend. The story received wide praise<ref>{{cite web|first=Hilary|last=Goldstein|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/618/618636p1.html|title=The Batman Adventures: Mad Love Review|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[j2 Global]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 24, 2005|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}</ref> and won the [[Eisner Award|Eisner]] and [[Harvey Award|Harvey Awards]] for Best Single Issue Comic of the Year.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/eisner94.php |title=Will Eisner Comic Industry Award Nominees and Winners|journal=Comic Book Awards Almanac|publisher=The Hahn Library|date=1994}}</ref> ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' series adapted ''Mad Love'' as an episode of the same name in 1999. It was the second \"animated style\" comic book adapted for the series, with the other being \"Holiday Knights.\"\n\nHarleen Quinzel becomes fascinated with the Joker while working at Arkham Asylum and volunteers to help treat him. She falls hopelessly in love with the Joker during their sessions, and she helps him escape from the asylum more than once. When Batman returns a severely injured Joker to Arkham, she dons a jester costume to become Harley Quinn, the Joker's sidekick. The Joker frequently insults, ignores, hurts, and even tries to kill Harley, but she always comes back to him, convinced that he genuinely loves her.\n\n===Expanded role===\nAfter ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Harley makes several other animated appearances. She appears as one of the four main female characters of the [[Flash animation|web cartoon]] ''[[Gotham Girls]]''. She also made guest appearances in other cartoons within the [[DC animated universe]], appearing alongside the Joker in the [[Justice League (TV series)|''Justice League'']] episode \"Wild Cards\" and alongside [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] in the ''[[Static Shock]]'' episode \"Hard as Nails.\"\n\nHarley Quinn appears in [[The Batman/Superman Movie|''World's Finest: The Batman/Superman Movie'']] (a compilation movie consisting of three-part ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode \"World's Finest\") as a rival and [[Foil (literature)|foil]] for [[Lex Luthor]]'s assistant [[Mercy Graves]]; each takes an immediate dislike for the other, at one point fighting brutally with each other as Lex Luthor and the Joker have a business meeting. In the film's [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], Harley ties Graves as a human shield to a combat robot set to confront [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], but Graves is rescued by the two heroes without suffering any harm.\n\nThe animated movie ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' takes place in the future, long after the events in ''Batman: The Animated Series''. It includes a flashback scene in which Harley helps the Joker torture [[Tim Drake]] until he has become \"Joker Jr.,\" an insane miniature version of the Clown Prince of Crime; she then falls down a deep pit during a battle with [[Batgirl]]. At the end of the movie, a pair of twin girls who model themselves on the Joker are released on bail to their grandmother, who angrily berates them \u2014 to which they answer: \"Oh, shut up, Nana Harley!\" Prior to this, her costume made several appearances in episodes in the future [[Batcave]].\n\n==Characterization==\n===Harleen Quinzel===\nDr. Harleen Frances Quinzel is depicted as having been a [[psychiatrist]]<ref name=Eury>Michael Eury (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id= ''Back Issue'' #99], TwoMorrows Publishing, 2017, p. 69, \"Before she was Harley Quinn, she was the Joker's psychiatrist. ...

Art by [[Alex Ross]].]]\nHarley Quinn was first introduced in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' appearing in the style of a [[jester]]. She wore a black domino mask, white facial makeup, and a one-piece black-and-red [[motley]] outfit with a cowl.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Unlike the Joker, Harley's skin is not permanently white in the animated series, as this is reiterated in scenes showing Harley out of costume with a normal skin complexion. Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Ph.D., is portrayed as having blonde hair and blue eyes. She typically wears glasses, a skirt, high-heeled shoes, and a white lab coat.<ref name=\"auto3\">''Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death'' #1. DC Comics</ref>\n\nIn her early comic book appearances until 2011, the character wore her original black-and-red costume from the animated series. In September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Harley Quinn had a revamped look that lasted until 2016. The New 52 showed Harley Quinn with an alternating black-and-red-toned outfit with a sleeveless top, elbow pads, tight shorts, knee pads, and boots. Her hair color was altered to half-red and half-black, like the cap of her previous incarnation. Consistent with a new origin, her skin was bleached as the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.<ref name=\"auto4\">''Suicide Squad'' #7 (May 2012). DC Comics</ref>\n\nFollowing 2016's ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Harley Quinn debuted a new look in the third volume of her eponymous series, as well as the fifth volume of ''Suicide Squad''. Her hair color is now blonde with blue [[dip dye]] on the left side and pink dip dye on the right, and she sports two new outfits. One outfit consists of tight, blue and red shorts, a ripped tee-shirt, satin jacket, fingerless gloves, [[fishnet]] stockings, studded belt, and lace-up boots, much like [[Margot Robbie]]'s depiction of the character in the 2016 [[Suicide Squad (film)|''Suicide Squad'']] film. The character's other outfit is a two-tone, black-and-red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots. She has also been known to wear both red-and-black colored nail polishes on both her fingernails and toenails in an alternating fashion.\n\nHarley Quinn is adorned with various tattoos, including four diamonds on her upper right thigh. Within the [[DC Extended Universe]], both Harley and the Joker have several tattoos, with Harley having them on her cheek, forearm, legs, and abdomen.\n\n==Transition to comic books and publication history==\nAfter the success of ''The Animated Series'', the character proved so popular that she was eventually added to [[Batman (comic book)|''Batman'']] comic book [[Canon (fiction)|canon]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Hilary|title=Batman: Harley Quinn Review|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2005/05/25/batman-harley-quinn-review|website=IGN|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=24 May 2005}}</ref> She first appeared in the Batman adventures comic then original graphic novel ''Batman: Harley Quinn'', as part of the \"[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]\" story, although she had already appeared in the [[Elseworlds]] ''[[Batman: Thrillkiller]]'' and ''Batman: Thrillkiller '62'' in 1997. The comic book version of Quinn, like the comic book version of the Joker, is more dangerously violent and less humorously quirky than the animated series version. Despite her noticeably more violent demeanor, Harley does show mercy and compassion from time to time; she notably stops Poison Ivy from killing Batman, instead convincing her to leave the hero hanging bound and gagged from a large statue.\n\nA ''Harley Quinn'' [[ongoing series]]<ref>{{cite book|first= Alan|last=Cowsill|editor-first=Hannah|editor-last=Dolan|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|chapter= 2000s|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |location=London, England|date=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 297 |quote = Written by Karl Kesel and drawn by Terry Dodson, the double-sized first issue dealt with Harley's twisted relationship with the Joker.}}</ref> was published monthly by [[DC Comics]] for 38 issues from 2001 to 2003. Creators who contributed to the title included [[Karl Kesel]], [[Terry Dodson]], A.J. Lieberman, and Mike Huddleston. The series dealt with her going solo, eventually starting a gang and then fleeing Gotham for the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] with her friend Poison Ivy. Quinn dies, only to be resurrected and then return to Gotham. The series ends with Harley turning herself into Arkham Asylum, having finally understood that she needs help. We also learn in issue #8 of the comic that Harley had a relationship in college with fellow psychology student Guy Kopski, whose suicide foreshadowed her obsession with the Joker. Harley later appears in the [[Jeph Loeb]] series [[Batman: Hush|''Hush'']]. She is next seen in a ''[[Villains United]]'' ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' special, where she is one of the many villains who escape from Arkham (although she is knocked unconscious the moment she escapes).\n\nIn the \"[[One Year Later]]\" storyline, Harley Quinn is an inmate at Arkham, glimpsed briefly in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #823 (November 2006).\n\nHarley next appeared in ''Batman'' #663 (April 2007), in which she helps the Joker with a plan to kill all his former henchmen, unaware that the \"punch line\" to the scheme is her own death. Upon realizing this, she shoots him in the shoulder.\n\nHarley resurfaces in ''Detective Comics'' #831 (June 2007), written by Paul Dini. Harley has spent the last year applying for parole, only to see her request systematically rejected by Bruce Wayne, the layman member of Arkham's medical commission. She is kidnapped by Peyton Riley, the new female [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], who offers her a job; Harley turns the job down out of respect for the memory of Arnold Wesker, the original Ventriloquist, who attempted to cheer her up during her first week in Arkham while the Joker was still on the loose. She then helps Batman and [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Jim Gordon]] foil the impostor's plans. Although Riley escapes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with Harley's effort at redemption and agrees with granting her parole.\n\n[[Birds of Prey (comics)|''Birds of Prey'']] #105 (June 2007) reveals Harley Quinn as the 6th member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. In issue #108, upon hearing that [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] has sent the Russian authorities footage of teammate [[Deadshot]] murdering the Six's employer as payback for double-crossing them, Harley asks, \"Is it a bad time to say 'I quit'?\" thus leaving the team.\n\nIn [[Countdown (DC Comics)|''Countdown'']] #43 (July 2007), Harley appears to have reformed and is shown to be residing in an [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]]-run women's shelter. Having abandoned her jester costume and clown make-up, she now only wears an Amazonian [[stola]] or [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]]. She befriends the former [[Catwoman]] replacement [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]] and then succeeds in persuading her to join her at the shelter, where she is working as an assistant. They are both brought to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themiscyra]] by \"Athena\" (really [[Granny Goodness]]) and begin Amazon training. Holly and Harley then meet the real Athena and encounter [[Mary Marvel]]. The group reveals Granny's deception, and Holly, Harley, and Mary follow her as she retreats to [[Apokolips]]. Mary finds the Olympian gods, whom Granny had been holding prisoner, and the group frees them. Harley is granted powers by [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] as a reward. Upon returning to Earth, the powers vanish, and Harley and Holly return to [[Gotham City]].\n\n===''Gotham City Sirens''===\nHarley Quinn joins forces with [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] (Pamela Isley) and [[Catwoman]] (Selina Kyle) in the series ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]''. Having moved in with Pamela Isley at the [[Riddler]]'s apartment, she meets up with Catwoman, who offers for the three of them to live and work together. A new villain who tries to take down Selina Kyle named the Boneblaster breaks into the apartment, and the three of them have to move after they defeat him. Later, after a chance encounter with [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], the Joker attempts to kill her, apparently out of jealousy. Quinn is rescued by Ivy and Catwoman, and it is later revealed that her attacker was not the real Joker, but one of his old henchmen impersonating him.\n\n[[File:Harleen Quinzel.jpg|thumb|200px|Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Ph.D.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Art by [[Clay Mann]] and Seth Mann.]]\nIn ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'' #7, Harley Quinn visits her family in [[Bensonhurst]], Brooklyn, during the holiday season. Harley's father is a swindler who is still in jail, and her brother, Barry, is a loser with dead-end dreams of rock stardom. Her mother, Sharon, wants her to stop the \"villain and hero stuff.\" The dysfunctional, \"horrible\" experience while visiting family causes her to return home to the Sirens' shared Gotham City hideout where Harley, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy spend the rest of Christmas together.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nFollowing a number of adventures with Catwoman and Ivy, Harley betrays them and breaks into Arkham Asylum, intending to kill the Joker for his years of abuse towards her. However, Harley ultimately chooses instead to release the Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility that results in most of the guards and staff members either being killed or taken hostage by the inmates.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #20\u201323.

DC Comics</ref> Shortly afterward, Poison Ivy breaks into Harley's cell and attempts to kill her for her betrayal, but instead offers to free her if she helps her kill Catwoman, who had left both of her fellow Sirens behind in Arkham. Harley agrees, and the two set out to trap Catwoman.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #25 (July 2011). DC Comics</ref> During the ensuing fight, Catwoman says that she saw good in them and only wanted to help. Just as Batman is about to arrest them, Catwoman helps the two of them escape.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #26 (August 2011).

Harley appears in the debut issue as Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Ph.D., with continued appearances throughout the series.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n===The New 52/Harley Quinn Rebirth===\nFollowing DC's [[The New 52|2011 relaunch]] of its titles, Harley Quinn's costume and appearance were fully revamped. ''The New 52'' shows Harley Quinn with a sleeveless top, tight shorts, and boots. Her hair color has also been altered to half-red and half-black, and her bleached white skin is the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nAfter a falling out with the Joker, she goes into a murderous frenzy, directed towards people responsible for the Joker's imprisonment. Captured by the [[Black Canary]], she is forcibly inducted into the [[Suicide ]] by [[Amanda Waller]]. However, when she discovers that the Joker is rumored to be dead, it takes a further toll to her already-addled mind, and betraying the Suicide Squad, she puts their safety and secrecy at risk by turning herself into the Gotham Police Department in a plot to gain access to the skinned face of the Joker.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #6 (February 2012). DC Comics</ref> Her plan pays off, and she manages to recover the face; though, in a further psychotic episode, Harley captures and ties up Deadshot and places the skinned face of the Joker over Deadshot's face, so that she can carry on a \"conversation\" with her dead lover. Deadshot lures Harley in close, shooting and severely injuring her during the conversation.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> After the Joker returns to Gotham in the \"[[Death of the Family]]\" storyline, he forces her to disguise herself in his old [[Red Hood#The Joker|Red Hood]] costume and trick the Batman into coming to the chemical plant where they first met. The Batman then falls into a tank and demands Harley to tell him where the Joker is. However, she only replies, in tears, that he is no longer the Joker she had fallen in love with.<ref>''Batman''#13 (October 2012).

In the series, Harley Quinn has become a landlady at [[Coney Island]], is a part-time member of a roller derby team, and has returned to her work in psychology under her real alias, indicating that Harley's real identity is not public knowledge in the new status quo.\n\nUnder Conner and Palmiotti's writing, Harley was reinvented as an [[antihero]] who, after being released from the Suicide Squad and having her public files erased, values human life more or less and actively tries to improve life in her neighborhood, with mixed results. While the comic book version of the character is still romantically linked with the Joker, a more recent development has Harley also romantically involved with [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]].

Harley has once again met up with Power Girl and even her new sidekick Terra. She has faced down multiple villains from the Penguin to the corrupt mayor of New York and is in the process of running for mayor herself when the previous mayor tried to solve the homeless problem by feeding them to cannibals. She also runs a \"vigilante for hire\" group; she calls her Gang of Harleys and has numerous other allies and stalkers, including Red Tool (a parody of Deadpool), Harley Sinn (a former nemesis) and various other allies she has made along the way. The mayor countered by kidnapping her friend Mason and killing him. Harley got revenge, and then she and Ivy went to visit with her family. On her return, a Man-Bat was seen around town, and Tony went missing. Not feeling very good after the death of Mason, Harley ordered her gang to stay out of it and was summarily ignored. They went to Arkham to ask Langstrom if he was behind it but found him gibbering in his cell. He did, however, mention that there was \"another.\" Meanwhile, Harley went hunting for the Man-Bat and took it down, only to find out it was Tony. Kidnapped moments later, they awoke in Langstrom's lab to find that his wife Francine was the newest Man-Bat, and she then jabbed Harley with the Man-Bat potion.\n\nAfter that mess, a few of her old criminal buddies, including the Penguin, the Mad Hatter, the Scarecrow, Solomon Grundy, False Face, Mr. Freeze, and numerous other Batman villains took advantage of Harley's grief over her dead friend Mason to split her from her team. This was a temporary measure, and soon, Harley freed them from mind control and apologized for some things she said while on truth serum. Working together with all of her friends and allies like Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, and Power Girl, Harley took the gang down. A few weeks later, the Riddler showed up late for the fight while Harley and her gang were eating at the reformed Condiment King's new hot dog stand, and they easily beat him up too. This was followed up by a one-shot issue in which we see a decimated future where Red Tool has tracked down Old Lady Harley at future cyborg Tony's request. We learn that she married pretty much everyone she knew at one time or another and that the world was mostly destroyed when her Gang of Harleys became several Gangs and tore each other to pieces after Coach was killed/absorbed by Brainiac. Harley finds her old original gang, beats them up, and retakes control. This leaves Coach/Brainiac in charge, and he heads out with Red Tool to go home. Back in the current time period, she recently went on a one-woman rampage on Apokolips before coming back to Earth with a new friend she rescued from Granny Goodness named Tina to deal with a realtor and a cult run by a skeleton-headed goof calling himself \"Lord Death Man\" whom she heard about on a literal pirate broadcast. It turns out that he set it up himself because he is in love with her and thought it was fun walking into her traps, being apparently unkillable. Harley used the money he paid her to save her building and surrounding businesses from a land developer, whom she then catapulted away. When last seen, Harley was reading one of her own comics and a woman calling herself Jonni DC, Continuity Cop was threatening to stop her, and the preview predicted Harley would destroy the DC Universe. After her mother was temporarily retconned and a series of pointless adventures through multiple continuities, everything was restored to normal, with the exception of an alternate past superhero with no concept of a \"gray area\" being pulled into Harley's world.\n\n====Controversy====\nIn September 2013, DC Comics announced a contest for fans and artists, \"Break into comics with Harley Quinn!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2013/09/05/break-into-comics-with-harley-quinn#1|title=Break into comics with Harley Quinn!|work=DC Comics|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>, in which contestants were to draw Harley in four different suicide scenarios. This contest drew controversy not only because it was announced close to [[National Suicide Prevention Week]], but because some artists did not like the sexualized portrayal of Harley in the fourth scenario, in which Harley attempts suicide while naked in her bathtub. After seeing the reactions to the contest, DC apologized, saying they should have made it clear that it was a dream sequence that was not supposed to be taken seriously. In the final version, the bathtub scene was cut and replaced with Harley sitting on a rocket while flying in space.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/12/dc-comics-harley-quinn-suicide-_n_3913842.html | work=[[The Huffington Post]]|first=Cavan | last=Sieczkowski | title=Awful Comic Contest Asks For Drawings of Naked Woman Committing Suicide | date=September 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/dc-comics-contest-draw-a-naked-woman-committing-suicid-1265537616|title=DC Comics Contest: Draw a Naked Woman Committing Suicide|author=Callie Beusman|work=Jezebel|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===''Harley's Little Black Book''===\nHarley also teamed up with a lot of major DC characters in ''Harley's Little Black Book'', including Zatanna, Wonder Woman, Superman, Lobo, and a version of herself and some other superheroines in a world in which they were trying to kill [[Hitler]].\n\n===DC Universe===\nDC Comics began the next relaunch of its entire line of titles called ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' in June 2016. In December 2017, DC opted to rebrand its titles under the \"DC Universe\" name, using the continuity established from DC Rebirth.<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Rich|title=The End Of DC Rebirth Announced At New York Comic-Con|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/10/06/end-dc-rebirth-announced-new-york-comic-con|website=bleedingcool|accessdate=March 11, 2018|date=October 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bonthuys|first=Darryn|title=The Rebirth era is over, as a new direction begins in DC Universe|url=https://www.criticalhit.net/comics-toys/rebirth-era-new-direction-begins-dc-universe|website=criticalhit|accessdate=March 11, 2018|date=December 1, 2017}}</ref> Within the DC Universe, Harley Quinn is featured in a third bi-monthly volume of her eponymous series, starting with ''Harley Quinn'' vol. 3 #1 (October 2016).\n\n====Suicide Squad====\n[[File:Harley Quinn at Belle Reve.png|thumb|Harley Quinn attacks guards at Belle Reve.<ref name=\"auto5\">''Suicide Squad'' vol. 5 #20. DC Comics</ref> Art by [[Stjepan \u0160eji\u0107]].]] Harley Quinn has a recurring role in the comic book title ''[[Suicide Squad]]'', which debuted its fifth volume with ''Suicide Squad'' vol. 5 #1 (October 2016). Following the events of ''DC Rebirth'', Harley Quinn sports two new outfits following in ''DC Universe''. She wears tight blue-and-red shorts, a ripped white tee shirt, a satin jacket, fingerless gloves, net stockings, and boots. Her other outfit is a two-tone, black-and-red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots. Harley Quinn is adorned with tattoos, and her hair color is blonde hair with blue [[dip dye]] on the left side and pink dip dye on the right to match the movie and her new hairstyle in ''52''.\n\nUnlike her counterpart in the ''New 52'' series (who may be a sequel to this series after Harley finishes her time on the Squad, even going so far as to erase her public criminal record despite the fact that both versions got the dip-dyed hairstyle at the same time), she is still fairly dark and resists any attempts at labeling her a hero, no matter how many lives she saves or how many times she steps up to take command of the situation. She tends to swap her carefree joking attitude for the occasional sulk. So far, the events of the Squad do little to affect the DC Universe outside of their immediate mission. She is still officially done with the Joker in a romantic capacity and still Poison Ivy's on-again, off-again girlfriend.\n\nThe ongoing fifth volume of ''Suicide Squad'' shows Harley Quinn as an unpredictable and dangerous inmate at Belle Reve Penitentiary, attacking the facility's security forces when given the opportunity.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Harley Quinn becomes the leader of the Suicide Squad in issue #20, following Rick Flag's apparent death. The members of the team under Harley's leadership include [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Deadshot]], the [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]], [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], and [[Killer Croc]].\n\n====Harley Quinn DC Black Label====\n\nHarley Quinn is a major character in DC's first [[DC Black Label|''Black Label'']] comic series, an adult-focused imprint, in Sean Murphy's 8-part standalone story ''Batman: White Knight'' (more information provided in other versions section).\n\n''Harleen'', a limited series created by [[Stjepan \u0160eji\u0107|Stjepan Sejic]], due to debut on September 25, will provide new insight into the character's origin story and will be her first solo comic series within the new imprint.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2019/06/14/dc-black-label-reimagines-harley-quinn%E2%80%99s-origin-in-harleen-from-writer-and-artist|title=DC BLACK LABEL REIMAGINES HARLEY QUINN'S ORIGIN IN HARLEEN FROM WRITER AND ARTIST STJEPAN \u0160EJI\u0106|date=2019-06-14|website=DC|language=en|access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to her own origin story, Harley Quinn will also feature in Kami Garcia, Mike Mayhew, and Mico Suayan's ''Joker/Harley: Criminal Sanity.''

This version of Harley is a schoolgirl named '''Hayley Fitzpatrick''' who dresses up in order to help a female version of the Joker called Bianca Steeplechase. After Batgirl kills Bianca, Harley is shown killing her own family, intent on revenge in the final frames of the story.<ref>''Batman: Thrillkiller''. DC Comics</ref>\n* In the ''[[Elseworlds 80-Page Giant]]'', one of the stories is about [[Lex Luthor]] as a music producer.

DC Comics</ref>\n* Harley appears in ''[[Batman/The Spirit]]''. In this crossover, Harley is one of the many villains who helps try to take down the Batman and the [[Spirit (comics)|Spirit]]. She initially appears disguised as a flight attendant.\n* In the [[Joker (graphic novel)|2008 graphic novel ''Joker'']], Harley Quinn appears as the Joker's helper and [[aide-de-camp]]. She at one point acts as a stripper (though this may be a ruse) and is never shown speaking.<ref>''Joker'' (2008). DC Comics</ref>\n* In the [[Ame-Comi Girls]] universe, Harley is partnered with the [[Catwoman]] and [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]]  as part of a trio of villains.\n* The [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]] version of Harley Quinn is named '''Yo-Yo'''. She was a henchwoman of the [[Alternate versions of the Joker#Flashpoint|Joker]], and the [[Batman (Thomas Wayne)|Batman]] chased her down to find the Joker's location, as she had kidnapped [[Two-Face|Judge Dent]]'s children. He chased her to the ledge of the building around Crime Alley. Batman drops her off the roof, but is luckily saved by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]].<ref>''Flashpoint'' #1</ref>\n* In ''[[Batman '66]]'', a version of Harley Quinn designed more around the 1960s television show (she is slightly taller and her hair is short; she also wears prominent slanted glasses, a long red dress and red blouse, large pearl necklace, and fairly prominent earrings) appears as '''Dr. Holly Quinn''', PhD, a psychologist at [[Arkham Asylum]], referred to as Arkham Institute for the Criminally Insane. She convinces the Joker to cooperate with Batman and Robin in exchange for approving his comedy night proposal.<ref name=\":0\">''Batman '66'' #3.

Quinn is devastated by her role in the plot and to atone for her mistake, Dr. Quinn reverses the device by submitting herself to its effects \u2014 freeing the people of Gotham, but sacrificing her sanity in the process. She escapes and becomes a supervillain named Harlequin, wearing a [[roller derby]]-inspired version of the classic Harley costume. She retains her considerable intelligence and psychological training, making her a difficult foe for the Dynamic Duo, but is eventually captured when Batman and Robin disguise themselves as criminals (Batman in his regular alternate guise of [[Matches Malone]]) who beat up other bad guys who were auditioning to be Holly's henchmen.<ref>''Batman '66'' #24. DC Comics</ref>\n* Harley Quinn appears in the prequel comic to the game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''. She helps the Joker kidnap [[Lois Lane]] and surgically plant a trigger in her heart that will set off a nuclear bomb in Metropolis should her heart stop; when Superman accidentally kills her (thinking she is [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]) he becomes devastated, with the grieving Superman killing the Joker as a result. Harley struggles to come to terms with the Joker's death, but develops an attachment to the Green Arrow when he kidnaps her to protect her from Superman's wrath, but is also grief-stricken when he is killed by Superman. She later confronts the Black Canary, but hesitates upon realizing she is pregnant upon vomiting mid-battle and reveals to the Black Canary that she has a four-year-old daughter named Lucy who lives with her sister. Harley and the Canary befriend each other as a result and Harley starts helping Batman's Insurgency, though most members distrust her due to her lover's actions. In ''[[Injustice 2]]'', she helps to fight Grodd's Society and Brainiac alongside the Black Canary, the Green Arrow and the other Justice League and Regime members. It is revealed in the ending that she later joins the Justice League as a fully accepted member, though she occasionally has to deal with her violent impulses. It is also revealed that her daughter thinks her mother is actually her Aunt Harley, though Harley hopes she may one day be able to tell her the truth. \n* In the ''[[Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' crossover, Harley is made into a mutant hyena by the [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]]. She is knocked out by the Batman in the final battle and [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] uses her hammer to take down the rest of the Arkham inmates. After the Shredder is defeated, the mutagen in her system decays naturally, causing her and the rest of the mutated inmates to revert to normal.<ref>''Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' #6. DC Comics/IDW</ref>\n* In ''[[Batman: White Knight]]'', it is revealed that Harley Quinn was two different women all along. The first Harley Quinn, Harleen Quinzel, quit when the Joker captured and tortured [[Robin (character)|Robin]] ([[Jason Todd]]), and she was replaced by another girl, Marian Drews, without the Joker even realizing it. Once the Joker was cured from his insanity, he proposes marriage to Harley, only for her to beat him and mock him for acting \"normal\". The original Harley Quinn then appears, kicks the \"fake Harley\" unconscious and reveals to Jack Napier (Joker's true identity in this continuity) that there were two Harleys all along. While Harleen loved the Joker \"despite his flaws\", Marian loved the Joker by \"his flaws\". She accepts his marriage proposal and joins him in his quest to rid Gotham City of the Batman. Drews then takes the mantle of the Joker for herself \"until the real Joker returns\".<ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #2</ref><ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #3</ref>\n*In ''[[DC Comics Bombshells]]'', Harley fell in with the Joker (in this version, a gangster) after leaving Charm School, but left him when he began his journey into the occult. By the time of the events of the story, Harley is drawn to England by a voice she believes is the Joker, but turns out to be the Joker's Daughter. She rejects the Joker's Daughter's attempt to have the Joker resurrected in the body of Poison Ivy, instead beginning a relationship with Ivy herself.\n* In ''[[Batman: Damned]]'' Harley snaps after the Joker's mysterious death following a battle with Batman and performs surgery on herself and dressing herself to make her resemble the Joker. Harley leads the Joker's remaining henchman on a revenge mission, blowing up several buildings and taking over the GCPD building and defacing the Batsignal so that it resembles the Joker's smile. Batman arrives and defeats the henchman before Harley paralyzes him with a toxin, beats him with her baseball bat, and attempts to sexually abuse him. Batman is then possessed by the Enchantress, and strangles Harley against the Batsignal.<ref>''Batman: Damned'' #2</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Film===\n====Live-action====\n* Harley Quinn was initially set to appear in ''Batman Unchained'', the fifth film planned for the original Batman film series.<ref>{{cite web|first=Kelly|last=Konda|url=https://weminoredinfilm.com/2015/06/15/the-inside-story-on-5-batman-movies-which-almost-got-made-before-batman-begins/|title=The Inside Story on 5 Batman Movies Which Almost Got Made Before Batman Begins|website=We Majored in Film|date=June 15, 2015|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|first=Michael|last=Fleming|url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1116680121|title = Schumacher trims sails|magazine = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date = November 11, 1997|accessdate =November 11, 2008}}</ref> She was to be featured as the Joker's ([[Jack Nicholson]]) daughter, who allies herself with the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] to get revenge on Batman for her father's death.<ref>{{cite news|last=Linder|first=Brian|url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034019p1.html|title = Rumblings From Gotham|website = [[IGN]]|publisher=[[j2 Global]]|location=San Francisco, California|date = July 27, 2000|accessdate =October 17, 2008}}</ref> Due to the critical and commercial failure of [[Batman & Robin (film)|''Batman & Robin'']], however, this film was cancelled.\n* The ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' version of Harley makes a cameo appearance in the 2018 film ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]'' in The Distracted Globe nightclub sequence.<ref>{{cite web|author=Chris Begley |url=https://batman-news.com/2017/12/11/joker-harley-quinn-ready-player-one-trailer/ |title=The Joker and Harley Quinn appear in 'Ready Player One' trailer |publisher=Batman News |date= |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=====DC Extended Universe=====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margot Robbie]] as Harley Quinn in a publicity still for ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016)]] -->\n[[Margot Robbie]] portrays Dr. Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn in the [[DC Extended Universe]].<ref name=AdditionalCast>{{cite news|title='Suicide Squad': First Cast Photo Revealed|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/suicide-squad-first-cast-photo-revealed-1201468975/|accessdate=April 9, 2015|work=variety.com|date=July 25, 2015}}</ref>\n* The character debuted in the [[2016 in film|2016 film]] ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]''.

Thus they created a female sidekick for the Joker; she would become his love interest. [[Arleen Sorkin]], a former star of the soap opera ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', appeared in a dream sequence on that series in which she wore a [[jester]] costume; They used this scene as an inspiration for Quinn.<ref>{{cite web| first = Pat | last = Jankiewicz| title = Quinn-tessentials.

The story received wide praise<ref>{{cite web|first=Hilary|last=Goldstein|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/618/618636p1.html|title=The Batman Adventures: Mad Love Review|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[j2 Global]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 24, 2005|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}</ref> and won the [[Eisner Award|Eisner]] and [[Harvey Award|Harvey Awards]] for Best Single Issue Comic of the Year.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/eisner94.php |title=Will Eisner Comic Industry Award Nominees and Winners|journal=Comic Book Awards Almanac|publisher=The Hahn Library|date=1994}}</ref> ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' series adapted ''Mad Love'' as an episode of the same name in 1999. It was the second \"animated style\" comic book adapted for the series, with the other being \"Holiday Knights.\"\n\nHarleen Quinzel becomes fascinated with the Joker while working at Arkham Asylum and volunteers to help treat him. She falls hopelessly in love with the Joker during their sessions, and she helps him escape from the asylum more than once. When Batman returns a severely injured Joker to Arkham, she dons a jester costume to become Harley Quinn, the Joker's sidekick. The Joker frequently insults, ignores, hurts, and even tries to kill Harley, but she always comes back to him, convinced that he genuinely loves her.\n\n===Expanded role===\nAfter ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Harley makes several other animated appearances. She appears as one of the four main female characters of the [[Flash animation|web cartoon]] ''[[Gotham Girls]]''. She also made guest appearances in other cartoons within the [[DC animated universe]], appearing alongside the Joker in the [[Justice League (TV series)|''Justice League'']] episode \"Wild Cards\" and alongside [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] in the ''[[Static Shock]]'' episode \"Hard as Nails.\"\n\nHarley Quinn appears in [[The Batman/Superman Movie|''World's Finest: The Batman/Superman Movie'']] (a compilation movie consisting of three-part ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode \"World's Finest\") as a rival and [[Foil (literature)|foil]] for [[Lex Luthor]]'s assistant [[Mercy Graves]]; each takes an immediate dislike for the other, at one point fighting brutally with each other as Lex Luthor and the Joker have a business meeting. In the film's [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], Harley ties Graves as a human shield to a combat robot set to confront [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], but Graves is rescued by the two heroes without suffering any harm.\n\nThe animated movie ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' takes place in the future, long after the events in ''Batman: The Animated Series''. It includes a flashback scene in which Harley helps the Joker torture [[Tim Drake]] until he has become \"Joker Jr.,\" an insane miniature version of the Clown Prince of Crime; she then falls down a deep pit during a battle with [[Batgirl]]. At the end of the movie, a pair of twin girls who model themselves on the Joker are released on bail to their grandmother, who angrily berates them \u2014 to which they answer: \"Oh, shut up, Nana Harley!\" Prior to this, her costume made several appearances in episodes in the future [[Batcave]].\n\n==Characterization==\n===Harleen Quinzel===\nDr. Harleen Frances Quinzel is depicted as having been a [[psychiatrist]]<ref name=Eury>Michael Eury (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id= ''Back Issue'' #99], TwoMorrows Publishing, 2017, p. 69, \"Before she was Harley Quinn, she was the Joker's psychiatrist. ...

''Gotham City Sirens'' #7 (Feb. 2010) shows Harley visiting her family for the holiday season, in which they are portrayed as being very dysfunctional.

Speaking with a pronounced Northeastern<!-- Do not change this to a specific place as this is variable per depiction. --> accent, Harley refers to the Joker as ''Mistah J'' and ''Puddin''', terms of endearment that have since been used in nearly every adaptation in which the two characters appear.\n\n===Appearance===\n[[File:Harley Quinn and Joker.png|thumb|Harley Quinn with the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] on the cover of ''Batman: Harley Quinn''. Art by [[Alex Ross]].]]\nHarley Quinn was first introduced in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' appearing in the style of a [[jester]]. She wore a black domino mask, white facial makeup, and a one-piece black-and-red [[motley]] outfit with a cowl.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Unlike the Joker, Harley's skin is not permanently white in the animated series, as this is reiterated in scenes showing Harley out of costume with a normal skin complexion. Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Ph.D., is portrayed as having blonde hair and blue eyes. She typically wears glasses, a skirt, high-heeled shoes, and a white lab coat.<ref name=\"auto3\">''Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death'' #1. DC Comics</ref>\n\nIn her early comic book appearances until 2011, the character wore her original black-and-red costume from the animated series. In September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Harley Quinn had a revamped look that lasted until 2016. The New 52 showed Harley Quinn with an alternating black-and-red-toned outfit with a sleeveless top, elbow pads, tight shorts, knee pads, and boots. Her hair color was altered to half-red and half-black, like the cap of her previous incarnation. Consistent with a new origin, her skin was bleached as the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.<ref name=\"auto4\">''Suicide Squad'' #7 (May 2012). DC Comics</ref>\n\nFollowing 2016's ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Harley Quinn debuted a new look in the third volume of her eponymous series, as well as the fifth volume of ''Suicide Squad''. Her hair color is now blonde with blue [[dip dye]] on the left side and pink dip dye on the right, and she sports two new outfits. One outfit consists of tight, blue and red shorts, a ripped tee-shirt, satin jacket, fingerless gloves, [[fishnet]] stockings, studded belt, and lace-up boots, much like [[Margot Robbie]]'s depiction of the character in the 2016 [[Suicide Squad (film)|''Suicide Squad'']] film. The character's other outfit is a two-tone, black-and-red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots. She has also been known to wear both red-and-black colored nail polishes on both her fingernails and toenails in an alternating fashion.\n\nHarley Quinn is adorned with various tattoos, including four diamonds on her upper right thigh. Within the [[DC Extended Universe]], both Harley and the Joker have several tattoos, with Harley having them on her cheek, forearm, legs, and abdomen.\n\n==Transition to comic books and publication history==\nAfter the success of ''The Animated Series'', the character proved so popular that she was eventually added to [[Batman (comic book)|''Batman'']] comic book [[Canon (fiction)|canon]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Hilary|title=Batman: Harley Quinn Review|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2005/05/25/batman-harley-quinn-review|website=IGN|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=24 May 2005}}</ref> She first appeared in the Batman adventures comic then original graphic novel ''Batman: Harley Quinn'', as part of the \"[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]\" story, although she had already appeared in the [[Elseworlds]] ''[[Batman: Thrillkiller]]'' and ''Batman: Thrillkiller '62'' in 1997. The comic book version of Quinn, like the comic book version of the Joker, is more dangerously violent and less humorously quirky than the animated series version. Despite her noticeably more violent demeanor, Harley does show mercy and compassion from time to time; she notably stops Poison Ivy from killing Batman, instead convincing her to leave the hero hanging bound and gagged from a large statue.\n\nA ''Harley Quinn'' [[ongoing series]]<ref>{{cite book|first= Alan|last=Cowsill|editor-first=Hannah|editor-last=Dolan|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|chapter= 2000s|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |location=London, England|date=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 297 |quote = Written by Karl Kesel and drawn by Terry Dodson, the double-sized first issue dealt with Harley's twisted relationship with the Joker.}}</ref> was published monthly by [[DC Comics]] for 38 issues from 2001 to 2003. Creators who contributed to the title included [[Karl Kesel]], [[Terry Dodson]], A.J. Lieberman, and Mike Huddleston. The series dealt with her going solo, eventually starting a gang and then fleeing Gotham for the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] with her friend Poison Ivy. Quinn dies, only to be resurrected and then return to Gotham. The series ends with Harley turning herself into Arkham Asylum, having finally understood that she needs help. We also learn in issue #8 of the comic that Harley had a relationship in college with fellow psychology student Guy Kopski, whose suicide foreshadowed her obsession with the Joker. Harley later appears in the [[Jeph Loeb]] series [[Batman: Hush|''Hush'']]. She is next seen in a ''[[Villains United]]'' ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' special, where she is one of the many villains who escape from Arkham (although she is knocked unconscious the moment she escapes).\n\nIn the \"[[One Year Later]]\" storyline, Harley Quinn is an inmate at Arkham, glimpsed briefly in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #823 (November 2006).\n\nHarley next appeared in ''Batman'' #663 (April 2007), in which she helps the Joker with a plan to kill all his former henchmen, unaware that the \"punch line\" to the scheme is her own death. Upon realizing this, she shoots him in the shoulder.\n\nHarley resurfaces in ''Detective Comics'' #831 (June 2007), written by Paul Dini. Harley has spent the last year applying for parole, only to see her request systematically rejected by Bruce Wayne, the layman member of Arkham's medical commission. She is kidnapped by Peyton Riley, the new female [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], who offers her a job; Harley turns the job down out of respect for the memory of Arnold Wesker, the original Ventriloquist, who attempted to cheer her up during her first week in Arkham while the Joker was still on the loose. She then helps Batman and [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Jim Gordon]] foil the impostor's plans. Although Riley escapes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with Harley's effort at redemption and agrees with granting her parole.\n\n[[Birds of Prey (comics)|''Birds of Prey'']] #105 (June 2007) reveals Harley Quinn as the 6th member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. In issue #108, upon hearing that [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] has sent the Russian authorities footage of teammate [[Deadshot]] murdering the Six's employer as payback for double-crossing them, Harley asks, \"Is it a bad time to say 'I quit'?\" thus leaving the team.\n\nIn [[Countdown (DC Comics)|''Countdown'']] #43 (July 2007), Harley appears to have reformed and is shown to be residing in an [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]]-run women's shelter. Having abandoned her jester costume and clown make-up, she now only wears an Amazonian [[stola]] or [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]]. She befriends the former [[Catwoman]] replacement [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]] and then succeeds in persuading her to join her at the shelter, where she is working as an assistant. They are both brought to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themiscyra]] by \"Athena\" (really [[Granny Goodness]]) and begin Amazon training. Holly and Harley then meet the real Athena and encounter [[Mary Marvel]]. The group reveals Granny's deception, and Holly, Harley, and Mary follow her as she retreats to [[Apokolips]]. Mary finds the Olympian gods, whom Granny had been holding prisoner, and the group frees them. Harley is granted powers by [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] as a reward. Upon returning to Earth, the powers vanish, and Harley and Holly return to [[Gotham City]].\n\n===''Gotham City Sirens''===\nHarley Quinn joins forces with [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] (Pamela Isley) and [[Catwoman]] (Selina Kyle) in the series ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]''. Having moved in with Pamela Isley at the [[Riddler]]'s apartment, she meets up with Catwoman, who offers for the three of them to live and work together. A new villain who tries to take down Selina Kyle named the Boneblaster breaks into the apartment, and the three of them have to move after they defeat him. Later, after a chance encounter with [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], the Joker attempts to kill her, apparently out of jealousy. Quinn is rescued by Ivy and Catwoman, and it is later revealed that her attacker was not the real Joker, but one of his old henchmen impersonating him.\n\n[[File:Harleen Quinzel.jpg|thumb|200px|Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Ph.D.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Art by [[Clay Mann]] and Seth Mann.]]\nIn ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'' #7, Harley Quinn visits her family in [[Bensonhurst]], Brooklyn, during the holiday season. Harley's father is a swindler who is still in jail, and her brother, Barry, is a loser with dead-end dreams of rock stardom. Her mother, Sharon, wants her to stop the \"villain and hero stuff.\" The dysfunctional, \"horrible\" experience while visiting family causes her to return home to the Sirens' shared Gotham City hideout where Harley, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy spend the rest of Christmas together.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nFollowing a number of adventures with Catwoman and Ivy, Harley betrays them and breaks into Arkham Asylum, intending to kill the Joker for his years of abuse towards her. However, Harley ultimately chooses instead to release the Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility that results in most of the guards and staff members either being killed or taken hostage by the inmates.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #20\u201323. DC Comics</ref>\n\nHarley and the Joker are eventually defeated by the Batman and Catwoman, and Harley is last seen being wheeled away while bound in a straitjacket and muzzle.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #24 (June 2011). DC Comics</ref> Shortly afterward, Poison Ivy breaks into Harley's cell and attempts to kill her for her betrayal, but instead offers to free her if she helps her kill Catwoman, who had left both of her fellow Sirens behind in Arkham. Harley agrees, and the two set out to trap Catwoman.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #25 (July 2011). DC Comics</ref> During the ensuing fight, Catwoman says that she saw good in them and only wanted to help. Just as Batman is about to arrest them, Catwoman helps the two of them escape.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #26 (August 2011). DC Comics</ref>\n\nIn August 2016, the debut of the six-issue miniseries ''Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death'' reuniting Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, and Catwoman. Harley appears in the debut issue as Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Ph.D., with continued appearances throughout the series.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n===The New 52/Harley Quinn Rebirth===\nFollowing DC's [[The New 52|2011 relaunch]] of its titles, Harley Quinn's costume and appearance were fully revamped. ''The New 52'' shows Harley Quinn with a sleeveless top, tight shorts, and boots. Her hair color has also been altered to half-red and half-black, and her bleached white skin is the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nAfter a falling out with the Joker, she goes into a murderous frenzy, directed towards people responsible for the Joker's imprisonment. Captured by the [[Black Canary]], she is forcibly inducted into the [[Suicide ]] by [[Amanda Waller]]. However, when she discovers that the Joker is rumored to be dead, it takes a further toll to her already-addled mind, and betraying the Suicide Squad, she puts their safety and secrecy at risk by turning herself into the Gotham Police Department in a plot to gain access to the skinned face of the Joker.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #6 (February 2012). DC Comics</ref> Her plan pays off, and she manages to recover the face; though, in a further psychotic episode, Harley captures and ties up Deadshot and places the skinned face of the Joker over Deadshot's face, so that she can carry on a \"conversation\" with her dead lover. Deadshot lures Harley in close, shooting and severely injuring her during the conversation.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> After the Joker returns to Gotham in the \"[[Death of the Family]]\" storyline, he forces her to disguise herself in his old [[Red Hood#The Joker|Red Hood]] costume and trick the Batman into coming to the chemical plant where they first met. The Batman then falls into a tank and demands Harley to tell him where the Joker is. However, she only replies, in tears, that he is no longer the Joker she had fallen in love with.<ref>''Batman''#13 (October 2012).

In the series, Harley Quinn has become a landlady at [[Coney Island]], is a part-time member of a roller derby team, and has returned to her work in psychology under her real alias, indicating that Harley's real identity is not public knowledge in the new status quo.\n\nUnder Conner and Palmiotti's writing, Harley was reinvented as an [[antihero]] who, after being released from the Suicide Squad and having her public files erased, values human life more or less and actively tries to improve life in her neighborhood, with mixed results. While the comic book version of the character is still romantically linked with the Joker, a more recent development has Harley also romantically involved with [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]]. ''Harley Quinn'' series writers [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] and [[Amanda Conner]] confirmed that the two characters are in a non-monogamous romantic relationship.<ref>{{cite web|first=Evan|last=Narcisse|url=http://kotaku.com/dc-comics-harley-quinn-poison-ivy-are-girlfriends-w-1711038615|title=DC Comics: Harley Quinn & Poison Ivy Are Girlfriends \"Without Monogamy\"|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Univision Communication]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=June 12, 2015|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}</ref> Between issues #11\u201313, Harley formed a brief partnership with an amnesiac [[Power Girl]] and battled the [[Clock King]] and the [[Sportsmaster]] before Power Girl's memory was restored, and she left Harley at the top of the [[Eiffel Tower]] as punishment for her deceit.<ref>''Harley Quinn'' #11\u201313 (October\u2013December 2014).

Harley agrees to help a woman whose daughter has been kidnapped by a gang in Hollywood.<ref>''Harley Quinn## #16-19(June\u2013August 2015)''</ref>\n\n''Harley Quinn'' has featured a few standalone specials which are not directly connected to the main series and feature multiple artists. In the [[scratch and sniff]]-themed ''Annual'' issue, Harley briefly returned to Gotham to save her girlfriend Poison Ivy, as the [[Arkham Asylum]] employees monitoring her had brainwashed her to create a hallucinogenic pathogen.<ref>''Harley Quinn Annual'' #1 (October 2014). DC Comics</ref> In the [[Valentines Day|''Valentine's Day'']] ''Special'', Harley returned to Gotham to win a prize date with Bruce Wayne (who, unbeknownst to her, is the Batman) and finds herself fighting animal rights activists-turned-supervillain blackmailers. She shares a brief intimate moment with Bruce Wayne. At Coney Island, Batman informs Harley that while he still distrusts her, he admires her attempt at heroism and promises not to interfere. Harley kisses the Batman and tells him to get \"lessons\" on kissing from Bruce Wayne, to which the Batman privately grins.<ref>''Harley Quinn Valentines Day Special'' #1 (Feb 2015).

The plane carrying her crashes over the ocean while flying through a storm, and Harley is washed up onto the shores of an island inhabited by an uncontacted tribe. The tribe quickly declares her a goddess and is determined to have her meet their god-king who turns out to be the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].\n\nAfter a fight and reconciliation, Harley learns that the Joker has been living on the island as a god and making the inhabitants dress up as various superheroes and track him down while playing tricks on them. It is announced that she and the Joker are to be married.

Harley has once again met up with Power Girl and even her new sidekick Terra. She has faced down multiple villains from the Penguin to the corrupt mayor of New York and is in the process of running for mayor herself when the previous mayor tried to solve the homeless problem by feeding them to cannibals. She also runs a \"vigilante for hire\" group; she calls her Gang of Harleys and has numerous other allies and stalkers, including Red Tool (a parody of Deadpool), Harley Sinn (a former nemesis) and various other allies she has made along the way. The mayor countered by kidnapping her friend Mason and killing him. Harley got revenge, and then she and Ivy went to visit with her family. On her return, a Man-Bat was seen around town, and Tony went missing. Not feeling very good after the death of Mason, Harley ordered her gang to stay out of it and was summarily ignored. They went to Arkham to ask Langstrom if he was behind it but found him gibbering in his cell. He did, however, mention that there was \"another.\" Meanwhile, Harley went hunting for the Man-Bat and took it down, only to find out it was Tony. Kidnapped moments later, they awoke in Langstrom's lab to find that his wife Francine was the newest Man-Bat, and she then jabbed Harley with the Man-Bat potion.\n\nAfter that mess, a few of her old criminal buddies, including the Penguin, the Mad Hatter, the Scarecrow, Solomon Grundy, False Face, Mr. Freeze, and numerous other Batman villains took advantage of Harley's grief over her dead friend Mason to split her from her team. This was a temporary measure, and soon, Harley freed them from mind control and apologized for some things she said while on truth serum. Working together with all of her friends and allies like Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, and Power Girl, Harley took the gang down. A few weeks later, the Riddler showed up late for the fight while Harley and her gang were eating at the reformed Condiment King's new hot dog stand, and they easily beat him up too. This was followed up by a one-shot issue in which we see a decimated future where Red Tool has tracked down Old Lady Harley at future cyborg Tony's request. We learn that she married pretty much everyone she knew at one time or another and that the world was mostly destroyed when her Gang of Harleys became several Gangs and tore each other to pieces after Coach was killed/absorbed by Brainiac. Harley finds her old original gang, beats them up, and retakes control. This leaves Coach/Brainiac in charge, and he heads out with Red Tool to go home. Back in the current time period, she recently went on a one-woman rampage on Apokolips before coming back to Earth with a new friend she rescued from Granny Goodness named Tina to deal with a realtor and a cult run by a skeleton-headed goof calling himself \"Lord Death Man\" whom she heard about on a literal pirate broadcast. It turns out that he set it up himself because he is in love with her and thought it was fun walking into her traps, being apparently unkillable. Harley used the money he paid her to save her building and surrounding businesses from a land developer, whom she then catapulted away. When last seen, Harley was reading one of her own comics and a woman calling herself Jonni DC, Continuity Cop was threatening to stop her, and the preview predicted Harley would destroy the DC Universe. After her mother was temporarily retconned and a series of pointless adventures through multiple continuities, everything was restored to normal, with the exception of an alternate past superhero with no concept of a \"gray area\" being pulled into Harley's world.\n\n====Controversy====\nIn September 2013, DC Comics announced a contest for fans and artists, \"Break into comics with Harley Quinn!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2013/09/05/break-into-comics-with-harley-quinn#1|title=Break into comics with Harley Quinn!|work=DC Comics|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>, in which contestants were to draw Harley in four different suicide scenarios. This contest drew controversy not only because it was announced close to [[National Suicide Prevention Week]], but because some artists did not like the sexualized portrayal of Harley in the fourth scenario, in which Harley attempts suicide while naked in her bathtub. After seeing the reactions to the contest, DC apologized, saying they should have made it clear that it was a dream sequence that was not supposed to be taken seriously.

DC Comics</ref> Art by [[Stjepan \u0160eji\u0107]].]] Harley Quinn has a recurring role in the comic book title ''[[Suicide Squad]]'', which debuted its fifth volume with ''Suicide Squad'' vol. 5 #1 (October 2016). Following the events of ''DC Rebirth'', Harley Quinn sports two new outfits following in ''DC Universe''. She wears tight blue-and-red shorts, a ripped white tee shirt, a satin jacket, fingerless gloves, net stockings, and boots. Her other outfit is a two-tone, black-and-red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots. Harley Quinn is adorned with tattoos, and her hair color is blonde hair with blue [[dip dye]] on the left side and pink dip dye on the right to match the movie and her new hairstyle in ''52''.\n\nUnlike her counterpart in the ''New 52'' series (who may be a sequel to this series after Harley finishes her time on the Squad, even going so far as to erase her public criminal record despite the fact that both versions got the dip-dyed hairstyle at the same time), she is still fairly dark and resists any attempts at labeling her a hero, no matter how many lives she saves or how many times she steps up to take command of the situation. She tends to swap her carefree joking attitude for the occasional sulk. So far, the events of the Squad do little to affect the DC Universe outside of their immediate mission. She is still officially done with the Joker in a romantic capacity and still Poison Ivy's on-again, off-again girlfriend.\n\nThe ongoing fifth volume of ''Suicide Squad'' shows Harley Quinn as an unpredictable and dangerous inmate at Belle Reve Penitentiary, attacking the facility's security forces when given the opportunity.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Harley Quinn becomes the leader of the Suicide Squad in issue #20, following Rick Flag's apparent death. The members of the team under Harley's leadership include [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Deadshot]], the [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]], [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], and [[Killer Croc]].\n\n====Harley Quinn DC Black Label====\n\nHarley Quinn is a major character in DC's first [[DC Black Label|''Black Label'']] comic series, an adult-focused imprint, in Sean Murphy's 8-part standalone story ''Batman: White Knight'' (more information provided in other versions section).\n\n''Harleen'', a limited series created by [[Stjepan \u0160eji\u0107|Stjepan Sejic]], due to debut on September 25, will provide new insight into the character's origin story and will be her first solo comic series within the new imprint.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2019/06/14/dc-black-label-reimagines-harley-quinn%E2%80%99s-origin-in-harleen-from-writer-and-artist|title=DC BLACK LABEL REIMAGINES HARLEY QUINN'S ORIGIN IN HARLEEN FROM WRITER AND ARTIST STJEPAN \u0160EJI\u0106|date=2019-06-14|website=DC|language=en|access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to her own origin story, Harley Quinn will also feature in Kami Garcia, Mike Mayhew, and Mico Suayan's ''Joker/Harley: Criminal Sanity.''

This version of Harley is a schoolgirl named '''Hayley Fitzpatrick''' who dresses up in order to help a female version of the Joker called Bianca Steeplechase. After Batgirl kills Bianca, Harley is shown killing her own family, intent on revenge in the final frames of the story.<ref>''Batman: Thrillkiller''. DC Comics</ref>\n* In the ''[[Elseworlds 80-Page Giant]]'', one of the stories is about [[Lex Luthor]] as a music producer. One of his groups is, as the press puts it, \"[[alternative lifestyle]] [[folk music|folkies]] Ivy and Harley\".<ref>''Elseworlds 80-Page Giant''. DC Comics</ref>\n* On the new [[Earth-Three|Earth-3]], Harleen Quinzel is the Jokester's business manager and is killed by the [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]].<ref>''Countdown'' #32. DC Comics</ref>\n* Harley appears in ''[[Batman/The Spirit]]''. In this crossover, Harley is one of the many villains who helps try to take down the Batman and the [[Spirit (comics)|Spirit]]. She initially appears disguised as a flight attendant.\n* In the [[Joker (graphic novel)|2008 graphic novel ''Joker'']], Harley Quinn appears as the Joker's helper and [[aide-de-camp]]. She at one point acts as a stripper (though this may be a ruse) and is never shown speaking.<ref>''Joker'' (2008). DC Comics</ref>\n* In the [[Ame-Comi Girls]] universe, Harley is partnered with the [[Catwoman]] and [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]]  as part of a trio of villains.\n* The [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]] version of Harley Quinn is named '''Yo-Yo'''. She was a henchwoman of the [[Alternate versions of the Joker#Flashpoint|Joker]], and the [[Batman (Thomas Wayne)|Batman]] chased her down to find the Joker's location, as she had kidnapped [[Two-Face|Judge Dent]]'s children. He chased her to the ledge of the building around Crime Alley. Batman drops her off the roof, but is luckily saved by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]].<ref>''Flashpoint'' #1</ref>\n* In ''[[Batman '66]]'', a version of Harley Quinn designed more around the 1960s television show (she is slightly taller and her hair is short; she also wears prominent slanted glasses, a long red dress and red blouse, large pearl necklace, and fairly prominent earrings) appears as '''Dr. Holly Quinn''', PhD, a psychologist at [[Arkham Asylum]], referred to as Arkham Institute for the Criminally Insane. She convinces the Joker to cooperate with Batman and Robin in exchange for approving his comedy night proposal.<ref name=\":0\">''Batman '66'' #3. DC Comics</ref> Dr. Quinn is manipulated by the Catwoman and the Joker to perfect the Joker Wave \u2014 a hysteria-inducing transmitting dish used on Gotham. Quinn is devastated by her role in the plot and to atone for her mistake, Dr. Quinn reverses the device by submitting herself to its effects \u2014 freeing the people of Gotham, but sacrificing her sanity in the process. She escapes and becomes a supervillain named Harlequin, wearing a [[roller derby]]-inspired version of the classic Harley costume. She retains her considerable intelligence and psychological training, making her a difficult foe for the Dynamic Duo, but is eventually captured when Batman and Robin disguise themselves as criminals (Batman in his regular alternate guise of [[Matches Malone]]) who beat up other bad guys who were auditioning to be Holly's henchmen.<ref>''Batman '66'' #24. DC Comics</ref>\n* Harley Quinn appears in the prequel comic to the game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''. She helps the Joker kidnap [[Lois Lane]] and surgically plant a trigger in her heart that will set off a nuclear bomb in Metropolis should her heart stop; when Superman accidentally kills her (thinking she is [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]) he becomes devastated, with the grieving Superman killing the Joker as a result. Harley struggles to come to terms with the Joker's death, but develops an attachment to the Green Arrow when he kidnaps her to protect her from Superman's wrath, but is also grief-stricken when he is killed by Superman. She later confronts the Black Canary, but hesitates upon realizing she is pregnant upon vomiting mid-battle and reveals to the Black Canary that she has a four-year-old daughter named Lucy who lives with her sister. Harley and the Canary befriend each other as a result and Harley starts helping Batman's Insurgency, though most members distrust her due to her lover's actions. In ''[[Injustice 2]]'', she helps to fight Grodd's Society and Brainiac alongside the Black Canary, the Green Arrow and the other Justice League and Regime members. It is revealed in the ending that she later joins the Justice League as a fully accepted member, though she occasionally has to deal with her violent impulses. It is also revealed that her daughter thinks her mother is actually her Aunt Harley, though Harley hopes she may one day be able to tell her the truth. \n* In the ''[[Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' crossover, Harley is made into a mutant hyena by the [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]]. She is knocked out by the Batman in the final battle and [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] uses her hammer to take down the rest of the Arkham inmates. After the Shredder is defeated, the mutagen in her system decays naturally, causing her and the rest of the mutated inmates to revert to normal.<ref>''Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' #6. DC Comics/IDW</ref>\n* In ''[[Batman: White Knight]]'', it is revealed that Harley Quinn was two different women all along. The first Harley Quinn, Harleen Quinzel, quit when the Joker captured and tortured [[Robin (character)|Robin]] ([[Jason Todd]]), and she was replaced by another girl, Marian Drews, without the Joker even realizing it. Once the Joker was cured from his insanity, he proposes marriage to Harley, only for her to beat him and mock him for acting \"normal\". The original Harley Quinn then appears, kicks the \"fake Harley\" unconscious and reveals to Jack Napier (Joker's true identity in this continuity) that there were two Harleys all along. While Harleen loved the Joker \"despite his flaws\", Marian loved the Joker by \"his flaws\". She accepts his marriage proposal and joins him in his quest to rid Gotham City of the Batman. Drews then takes the mantle of the Joker for herself \"until the real Joker returns\".<ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #2</ref><ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #3</ref>\n*In ''[[DC Comics Bombshells]]'', Harley fell in with the Joker (in this version, a gangster) after leaving Charm School, but left him when he began his journey into the occult. By the time of the events of the story, Harley is drawn to England by a voice she believes is the Joker, but turns out to be the Joker's Daughter. She rejects the Joker's Daughter's attempt to have the Joker resurrected in the body of Poison Ivy, instead beginning a relationship with Ivy herself.\n* In ''[[Batman: Damned]]'' Harley snaps after the Joker's mysterious death following a battle with Batman and performs surgery on herself and dressing herself to make her resemble the Joker. Harley leads the Joker's remaining henchman on a revenge mission, blowing up several buildings and taking over the GCPD building and defacing the Batsignal so that it resembles the Joker's smile. Batman arrives and defeats the henchman before Harley paralyzes him with a toxin, beats him with her baseball bat, and attempts to sexually abuse him. Batman is then possessed by the Enchantress, and strangles Harley against the Batsignal.<ref>''Batman: Damned'' #2</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Film===\n====Live-action====\n* Harley Quinn was initially set to appear in ''Batman Unchained'', the fifth film planned for the original Batman film series.<ref>{{cite web|first=Kelly|last=Konda|url=https://weminoredinfilm.com/2015/06/15/the-inside-story-on-5-batman-movies-which-almost-got-made-before-batman-begins/|title=The Inside Story on 5 Batman Movies Which Almost Got Made Before Batman Begins|website=We Majored in Film|date=June 15, 2015|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|first=Michael|last=Fleming|url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1116680121|title = Schumacher trims sails|magazine = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date = November 11, 1997|accessdate =November 11, 2008}}</ref> She was to be featured as the Joker's ([[Jack Nicholson]]) daughter, who allies herself with the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] to get revenge on Batman for her father's death.<ref>{{cite news|last=Linder|first=Brian|url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034019p1.html|title = Rumblings From Gotham|website = [[IGN]]|publisher=[[j2 Global]]|location=San Francisco, California|date = July 27, 2000|accessdate =October 17, 2008}}</ref> Due to the critical and commercial failure of [[Batman & Robin (film)|''Batman & Robin'']], however, this film was cancelled.\n* The ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' version of Harley makes a cameo appearance in the 2018 film ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]'' in The Distracted Globe nightclub sequence.<ref>{{cite web|author=Chris Begley |url=https://batman-news.com/2017/12/11/joker-harley-quinn-ready-player-one-trailer/ |title=The Joker and Harley Quinn appear in 'Ready Player One' trailer |publisher=Batman News |date= |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=====DC Extended Universe=====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margot Robbie]] as Harley Quinn in a publicity still for ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016)]] -->\n[[Margot Robbie]] portrays Dr. Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn in the [[DC Extended Universe]].<ref name=AdditionalCast>{{cite news|title='Suicide Squad': First Cast Photo Revealed|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/suicide-squad-first-cast-photo-revealed-1201468975/|accessdate=April 9, 2015|work=variety.com|date=July 25, 2015}}</ref>\n* The character debuted in the [[2016 in film|2016 film]] ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]''.

Attempting to avoid her father's fate, she joins a criminal organisation called the Pact to steal a virus that will be able to cure her hereditary condition. This depiction initially reverses the dynamic between Harley and the Joker. Quinn manipulates and abuses her former patient at Arkham  Asylum, named \"John Doe\", who is infatuated with her. As the series progresses, John's confidence will increase and, depending on the player's choices, he will either aid Bruce Wayne in capturing Quinn or transform into the traditional version of the Joker.

Epigenetics also studies how these genetic modifications can be passed on to future generations. Schizophrenia is a debilitating and often misunderstood disorder that affects up to 1% of the world's population.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Roth TL, Lubin FD, Sodhi M, Kleinman JE | title = Epigenetic mechanisms in schizophrenia | journal = Biochim.

In the late 1870s, [[Emil Kraepelin]] started the idea of studying it as an illness. Another paradigm, introduced by Zubin and Spring in 1977, was the [[Diathesis-stress model|stress-vulnerability model]] where the individual has unique characteristics that give him or her strengths or vulnerabilities to deal with stress, a predisposition for schizophrenia. More recently, with the decoding of the human genome, there had been a focus on identifying specific genes to study the disease. However, the genetics paradigm faced problems with inconsistent, inconclusive, and variable results. The most recent school of thought is studying schizophrenia through epigenetics.<ref name=\"Kaplan_2008\">{{cite journal | author = Kaplan RM | title = Being Bleuler: the second century of schizophrenia | journal = Australas Psychiatry | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 305\u201311 |date=October 2008 | pmid = 18781458 | doi = 10.1080/10398560802302176 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Diathesisstressdualriskmodel.JPG|thumb|alt=Alternative text, Diathesis-Stress Model|A visualization of the stress-vulnerability model, also known as the Diathesis-Stress Model]]\n\nThe idea of epigenetics has been described as far back as 1942, when Conrad Waddington described it as how the environment regulated genetics. As the field and available technology has progressed, the term has come to also refer to the molecular mechanisms of regulation. The concept that these epigenetic changes can be passed on to future generations has progressively become more accepted.<ref name=\"Pidsley_2011\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pidsley R, Mill J | title = Epigenetic studies of psychosis: current findings, methodological approaches, and implications for postmortem research | journal = Biol.

These symptoms are often used to build and study [[animal models of schizophrenia]] in the field of epigenetics.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/> Positive symptoms are considered [[limbic system|limbic]] system aberrations, while negative and cognitive symptoms are thought of as frontal lobe abnormalities.<ref name=\"isbn0-205-59495-6\">{{cite book |vauthors=Hooley JM, Butcher JN, Mineka S | title = Abnormal Psychology (14th Edition) (MyPsychLab Series) | publisher = Allyn & Bacon | location = Boston, Mass | year = 2009 | pages = | isbn = 978-0-205-59495-5 | oclc = | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\nPositive Symptoms:\n[[File:Brain limbicsystem.jpg|thumb|alt=Alternative text, Limbic system of the brain|The limbic system and associated structures of the brain, where abnormalities lead to positive symptoms of schizophrenia.]]\n*[[hallucinations|Hallucination]]\n*Delusions and paranoia\n*Thought disorders\nNegative Symptoms:\n*Apathy\n*[[alogia|Poverty of speech]]\n* Flat or blunted emotions\nCognitive Dysfunctions:\n*Impaired working memory\n*Disorganized thoughts\n* Cognitive impairments<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/>\n\n==== Heritability ====\n\nThere is a great deal of evidence to show that schizophrenia is a heritable disease. One key piece of evidence is a twin study that showed that the likelihood of developing the disease is 53% for one member of monozygotic twins (twins with same genetic code), compared to the 15% for dizygotic twins, who don't share the exact DNA.<ref name=\"Sham_1996\">{{cite journal | author = Sham P | title = Genetic epidemiology | journal = Br.

There are various environmental factors that have been suggested, including the use of marijuana, complications during pregnancy, socioeconomic status and environment, and maternal malnutrition. As the field of epigenetics advances, these and other external risk factors are likely to be considered in epidemiological studies.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/>\n\n==== Genetics ====\n\nSeveral genes have been identified as important in the study of schizophrenia, but there are a few that have special roles when studying the epigenetic modifications of the disease.\n*[[GAD1]]- GAD1 codes for the [[protein]] [[GAD67]], an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] from [[glutamate]]. Individuals with schizophrenia have shown a decrease in GAD67 levels and this deficit is thought to lead to working memory problems, among other impairments.<ref name=\"Gavin_2010\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gavin DP, Sharma RP | title = Histone modifications, DNA methylation, and schizophrenia | journal = Neurosci Biobehav Rev | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 882\u20138 |date=May 2010 | pmid = 19879893 | pmc = 2848916 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.10.010 | url = }}</ref>\n*[[RELN]]- RELN codes for [[reelin]], an extracellular protein that is necessary for formation of memories and learning through plasticity. Reelin is thought to regulate nearby [[glutamate]] producing neurons.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/>\n\nBoth proteins are created by GABAergic neurons. Several studies have demonstrated that levels of both reelin and GAD67 are downregulated  in patients with schizophrenia and animal models.\n\n*[[bdnf|BDNF]] - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF, is another important gene in the study of schizophrenia genetics. BDNF plays a crucial role in cognition, learning, memory formation, and vulnerability to social and life experiences.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/>\n\n=== Research methods ===\nEpigenetics can be studied and researched through various methods. One of the most common methods is looking at [[postmortem studies|postmortem brain tissue]] of patients with schizophrenia and analyzing them for biomarkers. Other common methods include tissue culture studies of neurons, genome-wide analysis of non-brain cells in living patients (see [[Peripheral blood mononuclear cell|PBMC]]), and transgenic and schizophrenic animal models.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/>\n\nOther studies that are currently being done or that can be done in the future include longitudinal studies of patients, \"at-risk\" populations, and monozygotic twins, and studies that  examine specific gene-environment interactions and epigenetic effects.<ref name=\"Rutten_2009\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rutten BP, Mill J | title = Epigenetic mediation of environmental influences in major psychotic disorders |journal=[[Schizophrenia Bulletin]] |volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 1045\u201356 |date=November 2009 | pmid = 19783603 | pmc = 2762629 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/sbp104 }}</ref>\n\n== Epigenetic alterations ==\nEpigenetics (translated as \"above genetics\") is the study of how genes are regulated through reversible and heritable molecular mechanisms. The epigenetic changes modify gene expression through either activation of the gene that codes for a certain protein, or repression of the gene. There are two main categories of modifications: the [[methylation]] of [[DNA]] and modifications to [[histones]]. Research findings have demonstrated that several examples of both of these changes are linked to schizophrenia and its symptoms.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/>\n[[File:Epigenetic mechanisms.png|thumb|alt=Mechanisms of epigenetics|Mechanisms of epigenetics in the cell]]\n\n=== DNA methylation ===\nDNA methylation is the covalent addition of a [[methyl]] group to a segment of the DNA code. These -CH3 groups are added to [[cytosine]] residues by the [[DNMT]] (DNA Methytransferases) enzymes. The binding methyl group to [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] regions interferes with the binding of [[transcription factors]] and silences the gene by preventing the transcription of that code.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/> DNA methylation is one of the most well studied epigenetic mechanisms and there have been several findings linking it to schizophrenia.\n\n==== Methylation of GABAergic genes ====\n\nIt has been consistently shown in various studies that levels of reelin and GAD67 are downregulated in the cortical and [[Hippocampus|hippocampal]] tissue samples of individuals with schizophrenia. These proteins are used by GABAergic neurons, and abnormalities in their levels could result in some of the symptoms found in individuals with schizophrenia. The genes for these two proteins are found in areas of the genetic code that can be methylated (see [[CpG island]]).\nRecent studies have demonstrated an epigenetic link between the levels of the proteins and schizophrenia. One study found that cortical neurons with lower levels of GAD67 and reelin also showed increased levels of DNMT1, one of the enzymes that adds a methyl group. It has also been shown that a schizophrenic-type state can be induced in mice when they were chronically given l-methionine, a precursor necessary for DNMT activity. These and other findings provide a strong link between epigenetic changes and schizophrenia.<ref name=\"Gavin_2010\"/>\n\n==== Methylation of BDNF ====\n\nDNA methylation can also affect expression of BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor). The BDNF protein is important for cognition, learning, and even vulnerability to early life trauma. Sun et al. showed that fear condition led to changes in DNA methylation levels in BDNF promoter regions in hippocampal neurons. It was also shown that inhibiting DNMT activity led to change in levels of BDNF in the hippocampus. Methylation of BDNF DNA has also been shown to be affected by post-natal social experiences, stressful environment, and social interaction deprivation. Furthermore, these stimuli have also been linked to increased anxiety, problems with cognition, etc. While a direct link between schizophrenia and BDNF levels hasn't been established, these findings suggest a relation to many problems that are similar to symptoms.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/>\n\n=== Histone modifications ===\n\nHistones are proteins that the DNA chromosome are wrapped around. Histones are present as an octamer (set of 8 proteins) and they can be modified through [[acetylation]], [[methylation]], [[SUMOylation]], etc. These changes can either open or close up the chromosome. Thus, depending on which histone is modified and the exact process, histone modifications can either silence or promote gene expression (while DNA methylation almost always silences).\n\nBecause the sub-field of histone modifications is relatively new, there aren't many results yet. Some studies have found that patients with schizophrenia have higher levels of methylation at H3 (the 3rd histone in the octamer) in the prefrontal cortex, an area that could be related to the negative symptoms. It has also been shown that histone acetylation and [[phosphorylation]] is increased at the promoter for the BDNF protein, which is involved in learning and memory.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/>\n\nMore recent studies have found that postmortem brain tissue from patients with schizophrenia had higher levels of [[HDAC]], histone deacetylase, an enzyme that remove acetyl groups from histones. HDAC1 levels are inversely correlated with GAD67 protein expression, which is decreased in patients with schizophrenia.<ref name=\"Gavin_2010\"/>\n\n=== Heritability ===\n\nStudies have shown that epigenetic changes can be passed on to future generations through meiosis and mitosis.<ref name=\"Goto_1998\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Goto T, Monk M | title = Regulation of X-chromosome inactivation in development in mice and humans | journal = Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Research findings have shown this to be true for patients with schizophrenia as well. In rats, the transmission of maternal behavior and even stress responses can be attributed to how certain genes in the hippocampus of the mother are methylated.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/>  Another study has shown that the methylation of the BDNF gene, which can be affected by early life stress and abuse, is also transmittable to future generations.<ref name=\"RothLubin2009\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Roth TL, Lubin FD, Funk AJ, Sweatt JD | title = Lasting epigenetic influence of early-life adversity on the BDNF gene | journal = Biol.

This is  through mutagenesis, which cause further spontaneous changes, or through genomic imprinting. As the parent ages, more and more errors may occur in the epigenetic process.<ref name=\"van Os\">{{cite journal |vauthors=van Os J, Rutten BP, Poulton R | title = Gene-environment interactions in schizophrenia: review of epidemiological findings and future directions | journal = Schizophr Bull | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 1066\u201382 |date=November 2008 | pmid = 18791076 | pmc = 2632485 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/sbn117 }}</ref> There is also evidence of the association between the inhalation of benzene through the burning of wood and schizophrenic development.

In the late 1870s, [[Emil Kraepelin]] started the idea of studying it as an illness. Another paradigm, introduced by Zubin and Spring in 1977, was the [[Diathesis-stress model|stress-vulnerability model]] where the individual has unique characteristics that give him or her strengths or vulnerabilities to deal with stress, a predisposition for schizophrenia. More recently, with the decoding of the human genome, there had been a focus on identifying specific genes to study the disease. However, the genetics paradigm faced problems with inconsistent, inconclusive, and variable results. The most recent school of thought is studying schizophrenia through epigenetics.<ref name=\"Kaplan_2008\">{{cite journal | author = Kaplan RM | title = Being Bleuler: the second century of schizophrenia | journal = Australas Psychiatry | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 305\u201311 |date=October 2008 | pmid = 18781458 | doi = 10.1080/10398560802302176 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Diathesisstressdualriskmodel.JPG|thumb|alt=Alternative text, Diathesis-Stress Model|A visualization of the stress-vulnerability model, also known as the Diathesis-Stress Model]]\n\nThe idea of epigenetics has been described as far back as 1942, when Conrad Waddington described it as how the environment regulated genetics.

These symptoms are often used to build and study [[animal models of schizophrenia]] in the field of epigenetics.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/> Positive symptoms are considered [[limbic system|limbic]] system aberrations, while negative and cognitive symptoms are thought of as frontal lobe abnormalities.<ref name=\"isbn0-205-59495-6\">{{cite book |vauthors=Hooley JM, Butcher JN, Mineka S | title = Abnormal Psychology (14th Edition) (MyPsychLab Series) | publisher = Allyn & Bacon | location = Boston, Mass | year = 2009 | pages = | isbn = 978-0-205-59495-5 | oclc = | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\nPositive Symptoms:\n[[File:Brain limbicsystem.jpg|thumb|alt=Alternative text, Limbic system of the brain|The limbic system and associated structures of the brain, where abnormalities lead to positive symptoms of schizophrenia.]]\n*[[hallucinations|Hallucination]]\n*Delusions and paranoia\n*Thought disorders\nNegative Symptoms:\n*Apathy\n*[[alogia|Poverty of speech]]\n* Flat or blunted emotions\nCognitive Dysfunctions:\n*Impaired working memory\n*Disorganized thoughts\n* Cognitive impairments<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/>\n\n==== Heritability ====\n\nThere is a great deal of evidence to show that schizophrenia is a heritable disease. One key piece of evidence is a twin study that showed that the likelihood of developing the disease is 53% for one member of monozygotic twins (twins with same genetic code), compared to the 15% for dizygotic twins, who don't share the exact DNA.<ref name=\"Sham_1996\">{{cite journal | author = Sham P | title = Genetic epidemiology | journal = Br.

There are various environmental factors that have been suggested, including the use of marijuana, complications during pregnancy, socioeconomic status and environment, and maternal malnutrition. As the field of epigenetics advances, these and other external risk factors are likely to be considered in epidemiological studies.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/>\n\n==== Genetics ====\n\nSeveral genes have been identified as important in the study of schizophrenia, but there are a few that have special roles when studying the epigenetic modifications of the disease.\n*[[GAD1]]- GAD1 codes for the [[protein]] [[GAD67]], an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] from [[glutamate]]. Individuals with schizophrenia have shown a decrease in GAD67 levels and this deficit is thought to lead to working memory problems, among other impairments.<ref name=\"Gavin_2010\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gavin DP, Sharma RP | title = Histone modifications, DNA methylation, and schizophrenia | journal = Neurosci Biobehav Rev | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 882\u20138 |date=May 2010 | pmid = 19879893 | pmc = 2848916 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.10.010 | url = }}</ref>\n*[[RELN]]- RELN codes for [[reelin]], an extracellular protein that is necessary for formation of memories and learning through plasticity. Reelin is thought to regulate nearby [[glutamate]] producing neurons.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/>\n\nBoth proteins are created by GABAergic neurons. Several studies have demonstrated that levels of both reelin and GAD67 are downregulated  in patients with schizophrenia and animal models.\n\n*[[bdnf|BDNF]] - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF, is another important gene in the study of schizophrenia genetics. BDNF plays a crucial role in cognition, learning, memory formation, and vulnerability to social and life experiences.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/>\n\n=== Research methods ===\nEpigenetics can be studied and researched through various methods. One of the most common methods is looking at [[postmortem studies|postmortem brain tissue]] of patients with schizophrenia and analyzing them for biomarkers. Other common methods include tissue culture studies of neurons, genome-wide analysis of non-brain cells in living patients (see [[Peripheral blood mononuclear cell|PBMC]]), and transgenic and schizophrenic animal models.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/>\n\nOther studies that are currently being done or that can be done in the future include longitudinal studies of patients, \"at-risk\" populations, and monozygotic twins, and studies that  examine specific gene-environment interactions and epigenetic effects.<ref name=\"Rutten_2009\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rutten BP, Mill J | title = Epigenetic mediation of environmental influences in major psychotic disorders |journal=[[Schizophrenia Bulletin]] |volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 1045\u201356 |date=November 2009 | pmid = 19783603 | pmc = 2762629 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/sbp104 }}</ref>\n\n== Epigenetic alterations ==\nEpigenetics (translated as \"above genetics\") is the study of how genes are regulated through reversible and heritable molecular mechanisms. The epigenetic changes modify gene expression through either activation of the gene that codes for a certain protein, or repression of the gene. There are two main categories of modifications: the [[methylation]] of [[DNA]] and modifications to [[histones]]. Research findings have demonstrated that several examples of both of these changes are linked to schizophrenia and its symptoms.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/>\n[[File:Epigenetic mechanisms.jpg|thumb|alt=Alternative text, Mechanisms of Epigenetics|Mechanisms of Epigenetics in the Cell]]\n\n=== DNA methylation ===\nDNA methylation is the covalent addition of a [[methyl]] group to a segment of the DNA code. These -CH3 groups are added to [[cytosine]] residues by the [[DNMT]] (DNA Methytransferases) enzymes. The binding methyl group to [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] regions interferes with the binding of [[transcription factors]] and silences the gene by preventing the transcription of that code.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/> DNA methylation is one of the most well studied epigenetic mechanisms and there have been several findings linking it to schizophrenia.\n\n==== Methylation of GABAergic genes ====\n\nIt has been consistently shown in various studies that levels of reelin and GAD67 are downregulated in the cortical and [[Hippocampus|hippocampal]] tissue samples of individuals with schizophrenia. These proteins are used by GABAergic neurons, and abnormalities in their levels could result in some of the symptoms found in individuals with schizophrenia. The genes for these two proteins are found in areas of the genetic code that can be methylated (see [[CpG island]]).\nRecent studies have demonstrated an epigenetic link between the levels of the proteins and schizophrenia. One study found that cortical neurons with lower levels of GAD67 and reelin also showed increased levels of DNMT1, one of the enzymes that adds a methyl group. It has also been shown that a schizophrenic-type state can be induced in mice when they were chronically given l-methionine, a precursor necessary for DNMT activity. These and other findings provide a strong link between epigenetic changes and schizophrenia.<ref name=\"Gavin_2010\"/>\n\n==== Methylation of BDNF ====\n\nDNA methylation can also affect expression of BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor). The BDNF protein is important for cognition, learning, and even vulnerability to early life trauma. Sun et al. showed that fear condition led to changes in DNA methylation levels in BDNF promoter regions in hippocampal neurons. It was also shown that inhibiting DNMT activity led to change in levels of BDNF in the hippocampus. Methylation of BDNF DNA has also been shown to be affected by post-natal social experiences, stressful environment, and social interaction deprivation. Furthermore, these stimuli have also been linked to increased anxiety, problems with cognition, etc. While a direct link between schizophrenia and BDNF levels hasn't been established, these findings suggest a relation to many problems that are similar to symptoms.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/>\n\n=== Histone modifications ===\n\nHistones are proteins that the DNA chromosome are wrapped around. Histones are present as an octamer (set of 8 proteins) and they can be modified through [[acetylation]], [[methylation]], [[SUMOylation]], etc. These changes can either open or close up the chromosome. Thus, depending on which histone is modified and the exact process, histone modifications can either silence or promote gene expression (while DNA methylation almost always silences).\n\nBecause the sub-field of histone modifications is relatively new, there aren't many results yet. Some studies have found that patients with schizophrenia have higher levels of methylation at H3 (the 3rd histone in the octamer) in the prefrontal cortex, an area that could be related to the negative symptoms. It has also been shown that histone acetylation and [[phosphorylation]] is increased at the promoter for the BDNF protein, which is involved in learning and memory.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/>\n\nMore recent studies have found that postmortem brain tissue from patients with schizophrenia had higher levels of [[HDAC]], histone deacetylase, an enzyme that remove acetyl groups from histones. HDAC1 levels are inversely correlated with GAD67 protein expression, which is decreased in patients with schizophrenia.<ref name=\"Gavin_2010\"/>\n\n=== Heritability ===\n\nStudies have shown that epigenetic changes can be passed on to future generations through meiosis and mitosis.<ref name=\"Goto_1998\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Goto T, Monk M | title = Regulation of X-chromosome inactivation in development in mice and humans | journal = Microbiol.

In rats, the transmission of maternal behavior and even stress responses can be attributed to how certain genes in the hippocampus of the mother are methylated.<ref name=\"Roth_2009\"/>  Another study has shown that the methylation of the BDNF gene, which can be affected by early life stress and abuse, is also transmittable to future generations.<ref name=\"RothLubin2009\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Roth TL, Lubin FD, Funk AJ, Sweatt JD | title = Lasting epigenetic influence of early-life adversity on the BDNF gene | journal = Biol.

Current antipsychotic drugs, like [[clozapine]] and [[sulpiride]], have been shown to also induce demethylation.<ref name=\"Gavin_2010\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Behavioral epigenetics]]\n* [[Causes of schizophrenia]]\n* [[Epigenetics in psychology]]\n* [[Neuroscience]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n*{{cite web | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/epigenetics/index.xhtml | title = Epigenetics | work = Science Online Special Collection | publisher = AAAS |date=October 2010 }}\n*{{cite journal | author = Akbarian S | title = Epigenetics of schizophrenia | journal = Curr Top Behav Neurosci | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 611\u201328 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21312415 | doi =10.1007/7854_2010_38 | series = Current Topics in Behavioral Neurosciences | isbn = 978-3-642-13716-7  }}\n*{{cite journal |vauthors=Gavin DP, Sharma RP | title = Histone modifications, DNA methylation, and schizophrenia | journal = Neurosci Biobehav Rev | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 882\u20138 |date=May 2010 | pmid = 19879893 | pmc = 2848916 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.10.010 }}\n*{{cite book |vauthors=Mill J, Petronis A | title = Brain, Behavior and Epigenetics (Epigenetics and Human Health) | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 2011 | pages = | isbn = 978-3-642-17425-4  }}\n*{{cite journal |vauthors=Oh G, Petronis A | title = Environmental studies of schizophrenia through the prism of epigenetics | journal = Schizophr Bull | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 1122\u20139 |date=November 2008 | pmid = 18703665 | pmc = 2632494 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/sbn105 }}\n*{{cite journal |vauthors=Roth TL, Lubin FD, Sodhi M, Kleinman JE | title = Epigenetic mechanisms in schizophrenia | journal = Biochim.

As his father and predecessor was also known as Carlos, he is sometimes called '''Carlos II'''. Carlos ruled over one of the most powerful and prosperous [[chiefdom]]s in the region at the time, controlling the coastal areas of southwest Florida and wielding influence throughout the southern peninsula. Contemporary Europeans recognized him as the most powerful chief in Florida.\n\nCarlos inherited the throne from his father, who had been installed as regent while the designated heir, Felipe, was too young to rule. Carlos' father bypassed Felipe in favor of Carlos, creating tension between Carlos and Felipe's families. Felipe served as war chief and was seen as a stronger leader by many Calusa.\n\nCarlos was chief at the time of contact with the Spanish under [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s]] in 1566. At this time, Carlos faced internal political pressure from Felipe as well as war with external enemies, most notably the [[Tocobaga]] around [[Tampa Bay]]. As a result, he initially sought an alliance with the Spanish. The alliance soon failed due to the conflicting aims of the two parties, and the relationship between the Calusa and the Spanish turned violent. Eventually Carlos was captured and executed by Spanish officers. Felipe succeeded him as chief.\n\n==Background and succession==\n[[File:FLMap-Calusa-core&domain.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Approximate Calusa core territory (red) and sphere of influence (blue) in Carlos' time]]\n\nDuring Carlos' time, the Calusa were a major power in Florida.

[[Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda]] says ''Senquene'' was the name of Carlos II's father and predecessor (Hann 5). However, Lewis (32) and Marquardt (104\u2013106) refer to the original king (Carlos II's father's brother) as \"Senquene\". Goggin and Sturtevant, Widmer, and McGoun follow Fontaneda in giving Senquene as the name of Carlos II's father.</ref> Their sister was married to the war chief (a position known to the Spanish as \"captain general\") with whom she had a son, who was eventually known to the Spanish as Felipe. The king had no sons of his own. As the Calusa, unusually among [[Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands|Southeastern peoples]], apparently practiced [[patrilineal succession]], the king named Felipe his heir. He formally adopted Felipe and married him to his daughter. However, the king died while Felipe was still too young to rule. Senquene and Felipe's father agreed that Senquene should rule temporarily until Felipe came of age. After Senquene took the kingship, Carlos was born. Senquene reneged on his vow to step down; he named Carlos his successor and had the previous king's daughter divorced from Felipe and remarried to Carlos. He placated Felipe's enraged family by naming Felipe the next captain general and arranging a marriage to one of his own daughters. This development caused unease for many Calusa, who saw it as a usurpation.<ref name=McGoun16/><ref>Hann 267\u2013269.</ref><ref name=Widmer6>Widmer 1988:6.</ref>\n\nCarlos II had an older sister, later baptized Antonia, whom he loved greatly. By the time of contact with the Spanish, Antonia was one of Carlos' wives (according to Spanish reports Calusa chiefs were expected to take their sister as one of their wives). His queen or principal wife, whose name is unknown, was the sister of Felipe.<ref name=Widmer6/> Carlos had several other wives, many of whom were daughters of his [[vassal|vassal chiefs]].<ref>McGoun 1993: 34.</ref>\n\n==Kingship==\nCarlos likely rose to the kingship in the 1550s; William Marquart suggests 1556 based on events that happened that year. Carlos' succession evidently inspired challenges from other powerful chiefdoms. In 1556, the daughter of Oathchaqua, chief of the [[Ais people|Ais]] of [[Cape Canaveral]], set out for Calusa to cement an alliance between their peoples by marrying Carlos. During the journey, she was captured by the chief of the [[Surruque]] or Serrope, who took her as his own wife. In doing so, Chief Surruque challenged Carlos' authority, disrupted the key alliance and trading route between the Calusa and Ais, and positioned himself as a significant power. A few years later, the [[Tocobaga]] of [[Tampa Bay]] asserted themselves by capturing twelve Calusa nobles, including the sister of Carlos' wife. Beset with problems, Carlos struggled to respond.<ref>Marquardt 1987:106</ref>\n\nCarlos was king at the time of contact with the Spanish under [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s]]. Avil\u00e9s arrived in the Calusa region in 1566, five months after establishing the settlement of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] in northeast Florida and ejecting the French [[Huguenot]]s from their settlement of [[Fort Caroline]]. The Spanish landed at Carlos' capital, Calos, probably on [[Mound Key]].<ref>McGoun 1993: 9.</ref> Men\u00e9ndez' primary goal in the voyage was to secure the release of Spanish shipwreck survivors living among the Calusa, including his son Juan.<ref>McGoun, p. 9\u201311.</ref>\n\nCarlos jumped at the chance for an alliance with the powerful foreigners. He hoped such an alliance would help against his people's enemies, in particular the Tocabaga. He also may have hoped it would give him the upper hand in his rivalry with Felipe, whom the Spanish chronicler Gonzalo Sol\u00eds de Mer\u00e1s wrote was even more feared by his people than Carlos himself.<ref>McGoun, p. 12.</ref> According to historian Stephen Edward Reilly, this power struggle was the primary reason Carlos pursued an alliance with the Spanish.<ref>McGoun, pp. 12\u201313.</ref>\n\nCarlos attempted to solidify the alliance with the Spanish by offering to wed his sister Antonia to Men\u00e9ndez, who very reluctantly accepted. He allowed the Spanish to establish a small outpost and a [[Jesuit]] mission, [[San Ant\u00f3n de Carlos]], near the main town of Calos.<ref name=McGoun14>McGoun, p. 14.</ref> He also sent several prominent Calusa, including Felipe, a certain Sebastian, and Sebastian's son Pedro (relatives of Carlos), on a trip to [[Havana]]. However, relations with the Spanish soon soured. Carlos did reluctantly release his captive shipwreck survivors, but was angered when Men\u00e9ndez refused to aid him against the Tocobaga. He was further dismayed when Men\u00e9ndez put off consummating his marriage to Antonia (Sol\u00eds de Mer\u00e1s is unclear as to whether they ever consummated the union).<ref>McGoun, p. 13.</ref>\n\n==Death and aftermath==\nThereafter, the relationship took a violent turn, as Carlos repeatedly plotted against the Spanish. He attempted three times to assassinate Men\u00e9ndez. After Men\u00e9ndez's departure, the Calusa were continuously hostile towards the Spanish outpost and its commander, Francisco de Reinoso. Reinoso wanted to fight back, but was prevented from doing so by Father Juan de Rogel, who led Mission San Ant\u00f3n. In Spring 1567, Reinoso managed to compel Rogel to journey to Havana, allowing him to strike against the Calusa. Reinoso had Carlos captured and killed, along with his advisers, and installed Felipe in his place.<ref name=\"McGoun14\"/>\n\nFelipe proved a stronger king than Carlos, and therefore a greater danger to the Spanish. Though he appeased the Spanish by ostensibly converting to Christianity, he did not abandon the traditional religious practice or the power it afforded him. In 1569, the Calusa attacked the landing party of [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez M\u00e1rquez]]. Men\u00e9ndez M\u00e1rquez repelled the attack and had Felipe and twenty of his supporters killed. Pedro, whom Spanish sources call Carlos' \"first cousin\", succeeded Felipe as chief of the Calusa. Pedro was no more compliant than his predecessors had been, and the Spanish abandoned the region.<ref>McGoun, pp. 15\u201316 and note.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n*{{cite encyclopedia |last= Goggin |first= John M. |author-link=John Mann Goggin|last2= Sturtevant |first2= William C.|author-link2=William C.
