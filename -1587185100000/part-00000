In 1762, after losing the [[French and Indian War]] to Great Britain, France secretly ceded [[New France]] to [[Spain]], per the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]]. In 1763 France ceded its territories east of the Mississippi River to Great Britain.\n\nIt regained the western territory under [[Napoleon]], who sold it in 1803 to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. He had decided to get rid of the New World territories after failing to regain control of [[Saint-Domingue]], where a slave rebellion had toppled colonial control. In 1804 [[Haiti]] declared independence as the second republic of the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe Plains Indians retained control of much of their territory until the late 19th century, giving way finally before superior United States arms and technology. Their territories were invaded by settlers, and crossed by the development of improved routes for settlers' emigrant wagon trains to the West Coast, followed by more permanent construction of transcontinental railroads. These brought tens of thousands of settlers to the Plains.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.  In 1803, most of the land for [[History of Kansas|modern day Kansas]] was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile [[Louisiana Purchase]] for 2.83 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] per [[acre]].\n\nIn 1854, the [[Kansas Territory]] was organized; and in 1861 [[Kansas]] became the 34th [[U.S. state]].  '''Ellsworth County''' was established February 26, 1867.  The county was named after the old [[Fort Ellsworth]], named in honor of 2nd Lieutenant Allen Ellsworth of the 7th Iowa Cavalry (Company H), who supervised construction of the fort in 1864 during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

The fort was subsequently moved to a new site about one mile to the northeast, and the old fort's remaining buildings were ordered torn down in June 1867.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nOn March 22, 1869, Fourteen [[Pawnee people|Pawnee Indians]], including scouts who had been honorably discharged after working for the army, were traveling through Ellsworth County when they ran into U.S. cavalry troops. Though the Pawnees had discharge papers from the army, a fight ensued. The Indians retreated to a sandstone cave, known today as Palmer's Cave. Their attackers set fire to grass at the cave's entrance, and six to nine Pawnees were killed as they ran out. The others died from exposure without their possessions. A few days later, the post surgeon at nearby [[Fort Harker (Kansas)|Fort Harker]], in today's town of [[Kanopolis, Kansas|Kanopolis]], removed six heads from their bodies, and shipped them to the Army Medical Museum in Washington, D.C., for cranial study.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Unspeakable Sadness: The Dispossession of the Nebraska Indians|last=Wishart|first=David|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=182, 183|quote=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kansaspublicradio.org/kpr-news/painting-symbolizes-dark-chapter-kansas-history-one-youve-likely-never|title=Spencer Painting Symbolizes Dark Chapter of Kansas History Few Have Ever Read|date=2017-01-27|newspaper=Kansas Public Radio|access-date=2017-02-13|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the later 19th century, this area became known for cattle ranching and cattle drives.

In 1762, after losing the [[French and Indian War]] to Great Britain, France secretly ceded [[New France]] to [[Spain]], per the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]]. In 1763 France ceded its territories east of the Mississippi River to Great Britain.\n\nIt regained the western territory under [[Napoleon]], who sold it in 1803 to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. He had decided to get rid of the New World territories after failing to regain control of [[Saint-Domingue]], where a slave rebellion had toppled colonial control. In 1804 [[Haiti]] declared independence as the second republic of the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe Plains Indians retained control of much of their territory until the late 19th century, giving way finally before superior United States arms and technology. Their territories were invaded by settlers, and crossed by the development of improved routes for settlers' emigrant wagon trains to the West Coast, followed by more permanent construction of transcontinental railroads. These brought tens of thousands of settlers to the Plains.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.  In 1803, most of the land for [[History of Kansas|modern day Kansas]] was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile [[Louisiana Purchase]] for 2.83 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] per [[acre]].\n\nIn 1854, the [[Kansas Territory]] was organized; and in 1861 [[Kansas]] became the 34th [[U.S. state]].  '''Ellsworth County''' was established February 26, 1867.  The county was named after the old [[Fort Ellsworth]], named in honor of 2nd Lieutenant Allen Ellsworth of the 7th Iowa Cavalry (Company H), who supervised construction of the fort in 1864 during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

The fort was subsequently moved to a new site about one mile to the northeast, and the old fort's remaining buildings were ordered torn down in June 1867.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nOn March 22, 1869, Fourteen [[Pawnee people|Pawnee Indians]], including scouts who had been honorably discharged after working for the army, were traveling through Ellsworth County when they ran into U.S. cavalry troops. Though the Pawnees had discharge papers from the army, a fight ensued. The Indians retreated to a sandstone cave, known today as Palmer's Cave. Their attackers set fire to grass at the cave's entrance, and six to nine Pawnees were killed as they ran out. The others died from exposure without their possessions. A few days later, the post surgeon at nearby [[Fort Harker (Kansas)|Fort Harker]], in today's town of [[Kanopolis, Kansas|Kanopolis]], removed six heads from their bodies, and shipped them to the Army Medical Museum in Washington, D.C., for cranial study.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Unspeakable Sadness: The Dispossession of the Nebraska Indians|last=Wishart|first=David|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=182, 183|quote=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kansaspublicradio.org/kpr-news/painting-symbolizes-dark-chapter-kansas-history-one-youve-likely-never|title=Spencer Painting Symbolizes Dark Chapter of Kansas History Few Have Ever Read|date=2017-01-27|newspaper=Kansas Public Radio|access-date=2017-02-13|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the later 19th century, this area became known for cattle ranching and cattle drives.

Travel has been adopted as the most effective method of personal reform and has become an emblematic feature of organisation.

During the course of these tours, members are generally seen dressed in simple, white, loose-clothing, carrying sleeping bags on their backs.<ref name=womenbm/> These members use mosques as their base during this travel but particular mosques, due to more frequent tablighiyat activities, have come to be specifically associated with this organisation.

They urge the attendees to spend time in tabligh for self reformation and the propagation of Islam.<ref>{{harvnb|Masud|2000|pp=27\u201328}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, the assumed role of these ''jamaat'' members cycle in a way that they may be engaged as a preacher, a cook or as a cleaner at other times. Among Tabligh Jamaat members, this is generally referred to as ''khidmat'' which essentially connotes to serving their companions and freeing them for tablighi engagements.<ref name=womenbm/> The members of the Jamaat are assigned these roles based on the day's ''mashwara''.

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Cot Goh.jpg|thumb|Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, [[Montasik]], [[Aceh Besar]], [[Aceh]]]]\n\n===Criticism===\nDue to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>  Tablighi Jamaat has been banned in some Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan, where its puritanical preachings are viewed as extremist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-who-are-the-tablighi-jamaat-the-organisation-at-the-epicentre-of-coronavirus-outbreak-in-india/article31238915.ece|title=Explained  Who are the Tablighi Jamaat?}}</ref>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=518}}</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/growing-islamic-state-influence-in-pakistan-fuels-sectarian-violence/|title=Growing Islamic State Influence in Pakistan Fuels Sectarian Violence|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=517}}</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.

However they also engage in proselytizing activities, discussing among themselves in small groups the basics of Tabligh and traveling with their husbands (or another ''[[mahram]]'') on proselytizing trips.<ref name=defeo-12-10-09>{{cite web |last1=De F\u00e9o |first1=Agn\u00e8s |title=Behind the Veil, In the Ranks of the Tablighi Jamaat |url=http://www.world-religion-watch.org/index.php/about-us-researchers-and-fellows-at-world-religion-watch/research-publications-and-working-papers/284-veil-tabligh-jamaat |publisher=World Religion Watch |accessdate=23 January 2016 |date=12 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128094407/http://www.world-religion-watch.org/index.php/about-us-researchers-and-fellows-at-world-religion-watch/research-publications-and-working-papers/284-veil-tabligh-jamaat |archive-date=28 January 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Tabligh inculcates in them that dawah is also important alongside taking care of their spouses or taking care of their children.<ref name=defeo-12-10-09/>\n\nAccording to a 1996 study by Barbara Metcalf,<ref name=womenbm/> the Tablighi Jamaat has encouraged to participate since the beginning of the movement. Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Cot Goh.jpg|thumb|Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, [[Montasik]], [[Aceh Besar]], [[Aceh]]]]\n\n===Criticism===\nDue to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>  Tablighi Jamaat has been banned in some Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan, where its puritanical preachings are viewed as extremist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-who-are-the-tablighi-jamaat-the-organisation-at-the-epicentre-of-coronavirus-outbreak-in-india/article31238915.ece|title=Explained  Who are the Tablighi Jamaat?}}</ref>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=518}}</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/growing-islamic-state-influence-in-pakistan-fuels-sectarian-violence/|title=Growing Islamic State Influence in Pakistan Fuels Sectarian Violence|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=517}}</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.

The juxtaglomerular apparatus is named because it is next to (juxta-<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.com/browse/juxtaposition |title=Dictionary.com |access-date=11 June 2015}}</ref>) the [[Glomerulus (kidney)| glomerulus]].\n\nThe juxtaglomerular apparatus consists of three types of cells:\n# the [[macula densa]], a part of the  distal convoluted tubule of the same nephron\n# [[juxtaglomerular cell]]s, (also known as granular cells) which secrete [[renin]]\n# [[extraglomerular mesangial cells]]\n\n==Structure==\nThe juxtaglomerular apparatus is part of the kidney [[nephron]], next to the [[Glomerulus (kidney)|glomerulus]]. It is found between [[afferent arteriole]] and the [[distal convoluted tubule]] of the same nephron. This location is critical to its function in regulating renal blood flow and [[glomerular filtration rate]].\n\n==Function==\n\n===Juxtaglomerular cells===\n[[Image:Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.png|thumb|300px|The [[renin\u2013angiotensin system]]. It is activated when juxtaglomerular cells are poorly perfused.]]\n{{See also|Renin\u2013angiotensin system}}\n[[Renin]] is produced by [[juxtaglomerular cells]]. These cells are similar to [[epithelium]] and are located in the tunica media of the afferent arterioles as they enter the glomeruli.<ref name=\"ganong\">{{cite book|last1=Ganong|title=Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology|publisher=TATA McGRAW HILL|isbn=978-1-25-902753-6|pages=705}}</ref> The juxtaglomerular cells secrete renin in response to:\n\n*Stimulation of the [[beta-1 adrenergic receptor]]\n*Decrease in renal perfusion pressure (detected directly by the granular cells)\n*Decrease in NaCl concentration at the macula densa, often due to a decrease in [[glomerular filtration rate]]\n\n===Extraglomerular mesangial cells===\n[[Extraglomerular mesangial cells]] are located in the junction between the afferent and efferent arterioles, but their significance in this location is unknown. [[Renin]] is also found in these cells.<ref name=\"ganong\"/>\n\n===Macula densa===\nAt the point where the afferent arterioles enter the glomerulus and the efferent arteriole leaves it, the tubule of the [[nephron]] touches the arterioles of the [[glomerulus]] from which it rose. At this location, the distal convoluted tubule, there is a modified region of tubular epithelium called the [[macula densa]].<ref name=ganong/> Cells in the macula densa respond to changes in the [[sodium chloride]] levels in the distal tubule of the nephron via the [[tubuloglomerular feedback]] (TGF) loop.\n\nThe macula densa's detection of elevated sodium chloride, which leads to an increase in GFR, is based on the concept of [[purinergic signaling]].<ref name=\"pmid20519378\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Carlstrom | first1 = M. | last2 = Wilcox | first2 = C.

The juxtaglomerular apparatus is named because it is next to (juxta-<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.com/browse/juxtaposition |title=Dictionary.com |access-date=11 June 2015}}</ref>) the [[Glomerulus (kidney)| glomerulus]].\n\nThe juxtaglomerular apparatus consists of three types of cells:\n# the [[macula densa]], a part of the  distal convoluted tubule of the same nephron\n# [[juxtaglomerular cell]]s, (also known as granular cells) which secrete [[renin]]\n# [[extraglomerular mesangial cells]]\n\n==Structure==\nThe juxtaglomerular apparatus is part of the kidney [[nephron]], next to the [[Glomerulus (kidney)|glomerulus]].

At this location, thick ascending limb of loop of Henle, there is a modified region of tubular epithelium called the [[Macula densa]].<ref name=ganong/> Cells in the macula densa respond to changes in the [[sodium chloride]] levels in the distal tubule of the nephron via the [[tubuloglomerular feedback]] (TGF) loop.\n\nThe macula densa's detection of elevated sodium chloride, which leads to an increase in GFR, is based on the concept of [[purinergic signaling]].<ref name=\"pmid20519378\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Carlstrom | first1 = M. | last2 = Wilcox | first2 = C.

They used some building materials from much older previous edifices. Franciscans took over the church in 1300. In the second half of the 14th century, the Franciscans expanded it, forming a monastery. Today the [[Ba\u010d, Serbia#Franciscan monastery|Fanciscian monastery of B\u00e1cs]] is the oldest church building in present-day Vojvodina. In the early 13th century [[Ugrin Cs\u00e1k, Archbishop of Kalocsa]], founded a hospital in B\u00e1cs, as the first such facility in this part of Europe. Pope Gregory IX wrote about the \"Ba\u010dka hospital\" in 1234, as being open for the sick and poor. At the beginning of the fourteenth century the town of [[Ba\u010d, Serbia|B\u00e1cs]] prospered during the rule of king [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles Robert I]], who started building the modern [[Ba\u010d Fortress|fortress]] in 1338\u201342 at the site of the earlier [[hillfort]]. From the 15th century, it became the most important Hungarian defense point against the invading Ottoman forces.\n\nIn 1526 the Kingdom of Hungary was defeated in the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] by the Ottoman Empire, King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] fell in the battle. After the victorious campaign the Ottoman army led by [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] withdrew from Hungary through the [[Danube\u2013Tisza Interfluve]], leaving only smaller garrisons in the fortifications. Within two to three weeks the retreating army killed approximately 400.000 men, burned down almost all the settlements, desolating the whole region.<ref>https://www.arcanum.hu/hu/online-kiadvanyok/Borovszky-borovszky-samu-magyarorszag-varmegyei-es-varosai-1/bacs-bodrog-varmegye-ii-22BB/bacs-bodrog-varmegye-tortenete-irta-reiszig-ede-dr-2393/ii-a-varmegye-tortenete-a-mohacsi-vesztol-a-kiegyezesig-15251867-258B/1-a-torok-hodoltsag-258C/a-szultan-visszavonulasa-2591/</ref> In this chaotic period took place the revolt of the [[Rascians]] and Ba\u010dka became (from 1526\u201327) the central region of an independent, short-lived Serbian pseudostate,<ref>Veselin P.

The ruler of this state was the self-appointed [[Emperor Jovan Nenad]] (previously the stableman of the king [[John Z\u00e1polya]]) and his capital city was [[Subotica]]. After Jovan Nenad was defeated and killed, his state collapsed and Ba\u010dka, for a short time, came again under Hungarian administration. Soon, the region became part of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAfter the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest, most of the previously decisive Hungarian majority population have fled (in the 16th\u201317th centuries).

Christian forces of the [[Holy League (1684)]] led by [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] in a surprise attack destroyed the Ottoman army crossing the river [[Tisza]]. The battle resulted in a spectacular victory for Austria. As a result, in 1699 the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] was signed, ending the Ottoman control in much of [[Central Europe]]. All the lands of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (except for [[Banat]] and a small chunk of [[Slavonia|Eastern Slavonia]]) conquered by the Ottomans in the [[Ottoman Hungary|previous 150 years]] were returned. Under the rule of [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] the Ba\u010dka became a possession of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. [[B\u00e1cs-Bodrog|B\u00e1cs-Bodrog County]] was established in the western parts of the region and it was re-integrated into the county system of the Kingdom of Hungary, while some other (mostly eastern) parts of the Ba\u010dka were incorporated into the [[Tisza]]-[[Mure\u015f River|Maros]] section of Habsburg [[Military Frontier]], which was directly administered  by the Imperial Habsburg court in Vienna. There were significant differences in the status of the inhabitants of the feudal county and the privileged newcome settlers of the Military Frontier, who composed mostly of ethnic Serbs. The [[Grenz infantry]] of the Military Frontier was primarily formed to defend Austria against the Ottoman Turks, but impliedly it was intended to offset and control the Hungarian population. This position was several times used by the Habsburg rulers as a political and tactical instrument in the following centuries.<ref>https://delhir.info/2019/10/27/istennel-a-hazaert-es-a-szabadsagert-ujra-belovagolt-a-bacskaba-ii-rakoczi-ferenc/</ref>\n\nIn the [[R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War of Independence]]  heavy fightings took place also in Ba\u010dka. In 1704 [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] led a victorious campaign in this parts. The Serbs fought on the Emperor's side since the beginning of the war. They were used as the light cavalry in the Austrian army and as tax collectors. During the eight years of war Hungarian villages and towns of the Great Hungarian Plain and Transdanubia were burnt and robbed by the Serbs, while in B\u00e1cska Serb villages were burnt. However, there were some Serbs who fought on Rak\u00f3czi's side against the Habsburgs \u2013 the Frontiersmen of Semlak. The leader of the Kuruc Serb troops was Frontier Captain Obrad Lali\u0107 from Senta.\nLater, some parts of the Military Frontier were abolished in 1751, these parts of Ba\u010dka were also included into [[B\u00e1cs-Bodrog County]].

After 1860, when the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar was abolished, [[B\u00e1cs-Bodrog]] County was again formed in the territory of Ba\u010dka.

The local military commander demanded the shopkeeper's immediate extradition, court martialed him and executed him on the spot.

Following this capitulation, Slavs from [[Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja]] organized a new civil administration in these regions as well as their own military units known as People's Guard (Serbian: ''Narodna stra\u017ea'').  The new civil administration was composed of local People's Boards (Serbian: ''Narodni odbori''), which were subordinated to Serb People's Board (Serbian: ''Srpski narodni odbor'') in [[Novi Sad]]. Military units of Serb People's Board also possessed aircraft from the Novi Sad Airport. After elections, which were organized between 18 and 24 November, Great People's Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs of Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja (held on 25 November 1918) proclaimed unification of these regions with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. The assembly represented only a part of the whole population and did not met the principle of the [[self-determination]] of nations. It numbered 757 deputies, of which 578 were [[Serbs]] , 84 [[Bunjevci]] , 62 [[Slovaks]] , 21 [[Rusyn people|Rusyn]] , 6 [[Germans]] , 3 [[\u0160okci]] , 2 [[Croats]] and 1 [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] , despite the fact that the absolute majority of the population of these regions was Hungarian and German. New administrative bodies of Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja (government and parliament) were also formed. Although, government in Belgrade accepted decision of unification with Serbia, it never recognized new provincial government. The provincial administration, however, was active until 12 March 1919, when it held its last session.<ref>Dr Drago Njegovan, Prisajedinjenje Vojvodine Srbiji, Muzej Vojvodine, Novi Sad, 2004.</ref>\n\nOn 1 December 1918, the Kingdom of Serbia united with the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs to form new country named the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]. Sovereignty of new kingdom was recognized by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint Germain]] in 1919. The [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 4 June 1920 defined the exact borders between [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (which was later renamed to [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]) and original territory of Ba\u010dka was divided between these two countries. The northern part of the region was a separate county of Hungary (B\u00e1cs-Bodrog) with seat in Baja, which was later incorporated into [[B\u00e1cs-Kiskun]] county. The southern part of the region was within the District of Novi Sad of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes between 1918 and 1922, then was divided between [[Ba\u010dka Oblast]] and [[Belgrade Oblast]], [[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia#Oblasts (1922\u20131929)|provinces ''(oblasts)'']] of the kingdom, between 1922 and 1929.

In the same time, percentage of South Slavs decreased from 44% in 1820 to 27% in 1910. 1921 census showed about 40,000 Hungarian speakers less than in census of 1910. This was especially case in Subotica where 1910 census recorded 55.587 speakers of Hungarian and 33,247 speakers of [[Bunjevac dialect|Bunjevac]], while census of 1921 recorded 60,700 speakers of Serbo-Croatian and 26,750 speakers of Hungarian. This is explained by the fact that ethnic Bunjevci from Subotica who had knowledge of Hungarian language were listed as speakers of Hungarian by 1910 census. Between 1921 and 1931 census, number of Hungarian speakers in Ba\u010dka increased from 260,998 to 268,711.

Today the [[Ba\u010d, Serbia#Franciscan monastery|Fanciscian monastery of B\u00e1cs]] is the oldest church building in present-day Vojvodina. In the early 13th century [[Ugrin Cs\u00e1k, Archbishop of Kalocsa]], founded a hospital in B\u00e1cs, as the first such facility in this part of Europe. Pope Gregory IX wrote about the \"Ba\u010dka hospital\" in 1234, as being open for the sick and poor. At the beginning of the fourteenth century the town of [[Ba\u010d, Serbia|B\u00e1cs]] prospered during the rule of king [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles Robert I]], who started building the modern [[Ba\u010d Fortress|fortress]] in 1338\u201342 at the site of the earlier [[hillfort]]. From the 15th century, it became the most important Hungarian defense point against the invading Ottoman forces.\n\nIn 1526 the Kingdom of Hungary was defeated in the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] by the Ottoman Empire, King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] fell in the battle. After the victorious campaign the Ottoman army led by [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] withdrew from Hungary through the [[Danube\u2013Tisza Interfluve]], leaving only smaller garrisons in the fortifications. Within two to three weeks the retreating army killed approximately 400.000 men, burned down almost all the settlements, desolating the whole region.<ref>https://www.arcanum.hu/hu/online-kiadvanyok/Borovszky-borovszky-samu-magyarorszag-varmegyei-es-varosai-1/bacs-bodrog-varmegye-ii-22BB/bacs-bodrog-varmegye-tortenete-irta-reiszig-ede-dr-2393/ii-a-varmegye-tortenete-a-mohacsi-vesztol-a-kiegyezesig-15251867-258B/1-a-torok-hodoltsag-258C/a-szultan-visszavonulasa-2591/</ref> In this chaotic period took place the revolt of the [[Rascians]] and Ba\u010dka became (from 1526\u201327) the central region of an independent, short-lived Serbian pseudostate,<ref>Veselin P.

The ruler of this state was the self-appointed [[Emperor Jovan Nenad]] (previously the stableman of the king [[John Z\u00e1polya]]) and his capital city was [[Subotica]]. After Jovan Nenad was defeated and killed, his state collapsed and Ba\u010dka, for a short time, came again under Hungarian administration. Soon, the region became part of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAfter the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest, most of the previously decisive Hungarian majority population have fled (in the 16th\u201317th centuries). The relatively dense populated and prosperous southern counties of the Kingdom were devastated and became mostly abandoned and depopulated.

Hungarian, Serb and [[Bunjevci]] peasants, and Serb and [[Vlachs|Vlach]] peasant soldiers lived (in ever-decreasing number) in the area, who had an impact on the landscape with their farming. In the Ottoman towns there was a Muslim population, and outside the city wall there were communities of various Christian denominations and occupations.

Christian forces of the [[Holy League (1684)]] led by [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] in a surprise attack destroyed the Ottoman army crossing the river [[Tisza]]. The battle resulted in a spectacular victory for Austria. As a result, in 1699 the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] was signed, ending the Ottoman control in much of [[Central Europe]]. All the lands of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (except for [[Banat]] and a small chunk of [[Slavonia|Eastern Slavonia]]) conquered by the Ottomans in the [[Ottoman Hungary|previous 150 years]] were returned. Under the rule of [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] the Ba\u010dka became a possession of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. [[B\u00e1cs-Bodrog|B\u00e1cs-Bodrog County]] was established in the western parts of the region and it was re-integrated into the county system of the Kingdom of Hungary, while some other (mostly eastern) parts of the Ba\u010dka were incorporated into the [[Tisza]]-[[Mure\u015f River|Maros]] section of Habsburg [[Military Frontier]], which was directly administered  by the Imperial Habsburg court in Vienna. There were significant differences in the status of the inhabitants of the feudal county and the privileged newcome settlers of the Military Frontier, who composed mostly of ethnic Serbs. The [[Grenz infantry]] of the Military Frontier was primarily formed to defend Austria against the Ottoman Turks, but impliedly it was intended to offset and control the Hungarian population. This position was several times used by the Habsburg rulers as a political and tactical instrument in the following centuries.<ref>https://delhir.info/2019/10/27/istennel-a-hazaert-es-a-szabadsagert-ujra-belovagolt-a-bacskaba-ii-rakoczi-ferenc/</ref>\n\nIn the [[R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War of Independence]]  heavy fightings took place also in Ba\u010dka. In 1704 [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] led a victorious campaign in this parts. The Serbs fought on the Emperor's side since the beginning of the war. They were used as the light cavalry in the Austrian army and as tax collectors. During the eight years of war Hungarian villages and towns of the Great Hungarian Plain and Transdanubia were burnt and robbed by the Serbs, while in B\u00e1cska Serb villages were burnt. However, there were some Serbs who fought on Rak\u00f3czi's side against the Habsburgs \u2013 the Frontiersmen of Semlak. The leader of the Kuruc Serb troops was Frontier Captain Obrad Lali\u0107 from Senta.\nLater, some parts of the Military Frontier were abolished in 1751, these parts of Ba\u010dka were also included into [[B\u00e1cs-Bodrog County]]. The only part of Ba\u010dka which remained within the Military Frontier was [[\u0160ajka\u0161ka]], but it also came under civil administration in 1873.\n\nAccording to the Austrian censuses from 1715\u201320, [[Serbs]], [[Bunjevci]], and [[\u0160okci]] comprised most of the region's population (97.6% of population according to 1715\u20131720 census data<ref name=\"hic.hr\">http://hic.hr/books/seeurope/011e-bognar.htm</ref><ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite book|author1=Karoly Kocsis|author2=Eszter Kocsis-Hodosi|title=Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minorities in the Carpathian Basin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zZ_NVM9mNEC&pg=PA141|date=April 2001|publisher=Simon Publications, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-931313-75-9|page=141}}</ref>).

After 1860, when the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar was abolished, [[B\u00e1cs-Bodrog]] County was again formed in the territory of Ba\u010dka.

When an angry mob chased one Serb-speaking shopkeeper to his home for refusing to remove his Cyrillic sign, he responded by shooting at the demonstrators. The local military commander demanded the shopkeeper's immediate extradition, court martialed him and executed him on the spot. The court martial also designated twelve more affluent hostages from among the Serb-speaking population who would be \"arrested and immediately executed by the military authorities\" in the case of any obstruction or opposition shown by the local [Serb-speaking] population to the military authorities.\" This would presage the Serb genocide committed in the [[Independent State of Croatia]] during most of the [[Second World War]].<ref>[[Peter Judson|Judson, Peter M.]] ''The Habsburg Empire: A New History'' (p. 398), Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass./London, England.

Following this capitulation, Slavs from [[Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja]] organized a new civil administration in these regions as well as their own military units known as People's Guard (Serbian: ''Narodna stra\u017ea'').  The new civil administration was composed of local People's Boards (Serbian: ''Narodni odbori''), which were subordinated to Serb People's Board (Serbian: ''Srpski narodni odbor'') in [[Novi Sad]]. Military units of Serb People's Board also possessed aircraft from the Novi Sad Airport. After elections, which were organized between 18 and 24 November, Great People's Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs of Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja (held on 25 November 1918) proclaimed unification of these regions with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. The assembly represented only a part of the whole population and did not met the principle of the [[self-determination]] of nations. It numbered 757 deputies, of which 578 were [[Serbs]] , 84 [[Bunjevci]] , 62 [[Slovaks]] , 21 [[Rusyn people|Rusyn]] , 6 [[Germans]] , 3 [[\u0160okci]] , 2 [[Croats]] and 1 [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] , despite the fact that the absolute majority of the population of these regions was Hungarian and German. New administrative bodies of Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja (government and parliament) were also formed. Although, government in Belgrade accepted decision of unification with Serbia, it never recognized new provincial government. The provincial administration, however, was active until 12 March 1919, when it held its last session.<ref>Dr Drago Njegovan, Prisajedinjenje Vojvodine Srbiji, Muzej Vojvodine, Novi Sad, 2004.</ref>\n\nOn 1 December 1918, the Kingdom of Serbia united with the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs to form new country named the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]. Sovereignty of new kingdom was recognized by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint Germain]] in 1919. The [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 4 June 1920 defined the exact borders between [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (which was later renamed to [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]) and original territory of Ba\u010dka was divided between these two countries. The northern part of the region was a separate county of Hungary (B\u00e1cs-Bodrog) with seat in Baja, which was later incorporated into [[B\u00e1cs-Kiskun]] county. The southern part of the region was within the District of Novi Sad of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes between 1918 and 1922, then was divided between [[Ba\u010dka Oblast]] and [[Belgrade Oblast]], [[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia#Oblasts (1922\u20131929)|provinces ''(oblasts)'']] of the kingdom, between 1922 and 1929.

In the same time, percentage of South Slavs decreased from 44% in 1820 to 27% in 1910. 1921 census showed about 40,000 Hungarian speakers less than in census of 1910. This was especially case in Subotica where 1910 census recorded 55.587 speakers of Hungarian and 33,247 speakers of [[Bunjevac dialect|Bunjevac]], while census of 1921 recorded 60,700 speakers of Serbo-Croatian and 26,750 speakers of Hungarian. This is explained by the fact that ethnic Bunjevci from Subotica who had knowledge of Hungarian language were listed as speakers of Hungarian by 1910 census. Between 1921 and 1931 census, number of Hungarian speakers in Ba\u010dka increased from 260,998 to 268,711.

Before this occupation, according to 1931 census, Yugoslav Ba\u010dka had 784,896 inhabitants, of whom there were 284,865 Yugoslavs (Serbs, Croats, Bunjevci, \u0160okci), 268,711 Hungarians and 169,858 Germans. Hungarian occupation authorities expelled several thousands of Serbs from the region and settled ethnic Hungarians from other parts of Central Europe in their place, so that the Hungarian census of 1941 recorded different a demographic composition in the region. According to this census, the territory of Ba\u010dka had 789,705 inhabitants, of which 45.4% or{{clarify|date=December 2012}} 47.2% were speakers of Hungarian language (not all of them native, however).<ref>K\u00e1roly Kocsis, Eszter Kocsisn\u00e9 Hodosi, Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minorities in the Carpathian Basin, Simon Publications LLC, 1998, p. 116-153 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-zZ_NVM9mNEC&pg=PA120&dq=Northern+transylvania++hungarians+romanians+number&hl=en&ei=FQkfTdjRKdKZhQeQ4Zi3Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CGAQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref> During the occupation, [[Occupation of Vojvodina, 1941-1944|Hungarian troops killed]] about 20,000 Serbs, Jews and Roma.<ref name=\"Dimitrije Boarov 2001, page 183\">Dimitrije Boarov, Politi\u010dka istorija Vojvodine, Novi Sad, 2001, page 183.</ref>\n\nThe occupation ended in 1944 and Yugoslav Ba\u010dka became part of the new [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]] (later the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia).

For example, [[Adolf Hitler]] and many Nazi officials had dark hair and were still considered members of the [[Aryan race]] under Nazi racial doctrine, because the determination of an individual's racial type depended on a preponderance of many characteristics in an individual rather than on just one defining feature.<ref>\"The range of blond hair color in pure Nordic peoples runs from flaxen and red to shades of chestnut and brown... It must be clearly understood that blondness of hair and of eye is not a final test of Nordic race. The Nordics include all the blonds, and also those of darker hair or eye when possessed of a preponderance of other Nordic characters. In this sense the word \"blond\" means those lighter shades of hair or eye color in contrast to the very dark or black shades which are termed brunet. The meaning of \"blond\" as now used is therefore not limited to the lighter or flaxen shades as in colloquial speech. In England among Nordic populations there are large numbers of individuals with hazel brown eyes joined with the light brown or chestnut hair which is the typical hair shade of the English and Americans. This combination is also common in Holland and Westphalia and is frequently associated with a very fair skin.

In the 19th century, \"language\" was considered a property of \"ethnicity\", and thus the speakers of the Indo-Iranian or Indo-European languages came to be called the \"[[Aryan race]]\", as contradistinguished from what came to be called the \"[[Semitic people|Semitic race]]\". By the late 19th century, among some people, the notions of an \"Aryan race\" became closely linked to [[Nordicism]], which posited Northern European racial superiority over all other peoples. This \"[[master race]]\" ideal engendered both the \"[[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]]\" programs of [[Nazi Germany]], in which the classification of people as \"Aryan\" and \"non-Aryan\" was most emphatically directed towards the exclusion of [[Jews]].<ref>{{citation|last=Campt|first=Tina|title=Other Germans: Black Germans and the Politics of Race, Gender, and Memory in the Third Reich|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|year=2004|page=143}}</ref><ref group=note>Under the 1933 ''Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service'', a non-Aryan was defined as \"an individual descended from a non-Aryan (in particular Jewish parents or grandparents)\" ({{harvnb|Campt|2004|p=143}}).</ref> By the end of World War II, the word 'Aryan' had become associated by many with the racial ideologies and atrocities committed by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]].\n\nWestern notions of an \"[[Aryan race]]\" rose to prominence in late-19th- and early-20th-century [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racialism]], an idea most notably embraced by [[Nazism]]. The Nazis believed that the \"[[Nordic race|Nordic peoples]]\" (who were also referred to as the \"[[Germanic peoples]]\") represent an ideal and \"pure race\" that was the purest representation of the original racial stock of those who were then called the Proto-Aryans.<ref>[[Joseph Pomeroy Widney|Widney, Joseph P]].

The word was used by [[Herodotus]] in reference to the Iranian [[Medes]] whom he describes as the people who \"were once universally known as Aryans\".{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=180}}\n\nThe meaning of 'Aryan' that was adopted into the English language in the late 18th century was the one associated with the technical term used in comparative philology, which in turn had the same meaning as that evident in the very oldest [[Old Indo-Aryan]] usage, i.e. as a (self-) identifier of \"[[Indo-Aryan peoples|(speakers of) Indo-Aryan languages]]\".<ref name=\"OED\"/><ref group=note>The context being religious, Max M\u00fcller understood this to especially mean \"the worshipers of the gods of the Brahmans\". If this is seen from the point of view of the religious poets of the RigVedic hymns, an 'Aryan' was then a person who held the same religious convictions as the poet himself. This idea can then also be found in Iranian texts.</ref> This usage was simultaneously influenced by a word that appeared in classical sources (Latin and Greek ''\u1f08\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2'' ''Arianes'', e.g. in Pliny 1.133 and Strabo 15.2.1\u20138), and recognized to be the same as that which appeared in living Iranian languages, where it was a (self-)identifier of the \"[[Iranian peoples|(speakers of) Iranian languages]]\". Accordingly, 'Aryan' came to refer to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|languages of the Indo-Iranian language group]], and by extension, native [[Indo-Iranians|speakers of those languages]].<ref>{{citation|last=Siegert|first=Hans|title=Zur Geschichte der Begriffe 'Arier' und 'Arisch'|journal=W\u00f6rter und Sachen|series=New Series|volume=4|year=1941\u20131942|pages=84\u201399}}</ref>\n\n=== Avestan ===\nThe term Arya is used in ancient [[Persian language]] texts, for example in the [[Behistun inscription]] from the 5th century BCE, in which the Persian kings [[Darius the Great]] and [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] are described as \"Aryans of Aryan stock\" (''arya arya chi\u00e7a''). The inscription also refers to the deity [[Ahura Mazda]] as \"the god of the Aryans\", and to the ancient Persian language as \"Aryan\". In this sense the word seems to have referred to the elite culture of the ancient Iranians, including both linguistic, cultural and religious aspects. {{sfn|Briant|2002|p=180}}{{sfn|Kuz'mina|2007|pp=371\u2013372}} The word also has a central place in the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian religion]] in which the \"Aryan expanse\" (''Airyana Vaejah'')  is described as the mythical homeland of the Iranian people's and as the center of the world.{{sfn|Rose|2011}}\n\n=== Vedic Sanskrit ===\n\nThe term Arya is used 36 times in 34 hymns in the [[Rigveda]].\nAccording to Talageri (2000, The Rig Veda. A Historical Analysis)\n\"''the particular Vedic Aryans of the Rigveda were one section among these [[Puru (Vedic tribe)|Purus]], who called themselves [[Bh\u0101ratas|Bharatas]].''\" Thus it is possible, according to Talageri, that at one point Arya did refer to a specific tribe.\n\nWhile the word may ultimately derive from a tribal name, already in the Rigveda it appears as a religious distinction, separating those who sacrifice \"properly\" from those who do not belong to the [[historical Vedic religion]], presaging the usage in later Hinduism where the term comes to denote religious righteousness or piety. In [[Mandala 9|RV 9]].63.5, ''{{IAST|\u00e2rya}}'' \"noble, pious, righteous\" is used as contrasting with ''{{IAST|\u00e1r\u0101van}}'' \"not liberal, envious, hostile\":\n:''{{IAST|\u00edndra\u1e43 v\u00e1rdhanto apt\u00fara\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e47v\u00e1nto v\u00ed\u015bvam \u00e2ryam apaghn\u00e1nto \u00e1r\u0101v\u1e47a\u1e25}}''\n:\"[the [[Soma (drink)|Soma]]-drops], performing every noble work, active, augmenting Indra's strength, driving away the godless ones.\" (trans. Griffith)\n\n=== Sanskrit epics ===\nArya and Anarya are primarily used in the moral sense in the [[Hindu Epics]]. People are usually called Arya or Anarya based on their behaviour. Arya is typically one who follows the [[Dharma]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} This is historically applicable for any person living anywhere in [[Bharata Varsha]] or vast India.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\nAccording to the [[Mahabharata]], a person's behaviour (not wealth or learning) determines if he can be called an Arya.<ref>(Mbh: ''tasyam samsadi sarvasyam ksatttaram pujayamy aham/ vrttena hi bhavaty aryo na dhanena na vidyaya''. 0050880521)</ref><ref name=\"Bronkhorst 1999\">Deshpande/ Gomez in Bronkhorst & Deshpande 1999</ref>\n\n=== Religious use ===\nThe word ''\u0101rya'' is often found in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain texts. In the Indian spiritual context, it can be applied to Rishis or to someone who has mastered the four noble truths and entered upon the spiritual path. According to Indian leader [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the religions of [[India]] may be called collectively ''\u0101rya dharma,'' a term that includes the religions that originated in the [[Indian subcontinent]] (e.g. [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and possibly [[Sikhism]]).<ref>\n{{cite book |last=Kumar |first=Priya |title=Beyond tolerance and hospitality: Muslims as strangers and minor subjects in Hindu nationalist and Indian nationalist discourse |editor=Elisabeth Weber |work=Living Together: Jacques Derrida's Communities of Violence and Peace |publisher=Fordham University Press |year=2012 |ISBN=9780823249923 |p=96}}\n</ref>\n\n==== Hinduism ====\n\"''O my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low family like that of a [[Chandala]], is situated on the highest platform of self-realization. Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and sacrifices according to Vedic literatures many, many times after taking bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage. Such a person is considered to be the best of the Arya family''\" ([[Bhagavata Purana]] 3.33.7).\n\n\"''My dear Lord, one's occupational duty is instructed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 according to Your point of view, which never deviates from the highest goal of life. Those who follow their occupational duties under Your supervision, being equal to all living entities, moving and nonmoving, and not considering high and low, are called \u0100ryans. Such \u0100ryans worship You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.''\" (Bhagavata Purana 6.16.43).\n\nAccording to [[Swami Vivekananda]], \"''A child materially born is not an Arya; the child born in spirituality is an Arya.''\" He further elaborated, referring to the [[Manu Smriti]]: \"''Says our great law-giver, [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]], giving the definition of an Arya, 'He is the Arya, who is born through prayer.' Every child not born through prayer is illegitimate, according to the great law-giver: The child must be prayed for. Those children that come with curses, that slip into the world, just in a moment of inadvertence, because that could not be prevented \u2013 what can we expect of such progeny?...''\"(Swami Vivekananda, Complete Works vol.8)\n\n[[Dayananda Saraswati|Swami Dayananda]] founded a Dharmic organisation [[Arya Samaj]] in 1875. [[Sri Aurobindo]] published a journal combining nationalism and spiritualism under the title ''[[Arya (journal)|Arya]]'' from 1914 to 1921.\n\n==== Buddhism ====\n{{main|Arya (Buddhism)}}\nThe word ''\u0101rya'' ([[P\u0101li]]: ''ariya''), in the sense of \"noble\" or \"exalted\", is very frequently used in Buddhist texts to designate a spiritual warrior or hero, which use this term much more often than Hindu or Jain texts. Buddha's [[Dharma]] and [[Vinaya]] are the ''ariyassa dhammavinayo''. The [[Four Noble Truths]] are called the ''catv\u0101ry \u0101ryasaty\u0101ni'' ([[Sanskrit]]) or ''catt\u0101ri ariyasacc\u0101ni'' (Pali). The [[Noble Eightfold Path]] is called the ''\u0101ryam\u0101rga'' (Sanskrit, also ''{{IAST|\u0101ry\u0101\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45gikam\u0101rga}}'') or ''ariyamagga'' (P\u0101li).\n\nIn [[Buddhist texts]], the \u0101rya pudgala (Pali: ''ariyapuggala, \"noble person\")'' are those who have the Buddhist ''[[\u015b\u012bla]]'' (P\u0101li ''s\u012bla'', meaning \"virtue\") and who have reached a certain level of spiritual advancement on the [[Buddhist paths to liberation|Buddhist path]], mainly one of the [[Four stages of enlightenment|four levels of awakening]] or in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, a [[bodhisattva]] level ([[Bh\u016bmi (Buddhism)|bhumi]]). Those who despise Buddhism are often called \"''an\u0101ryas''\".\n\n==== Jainism ====\nThe word \u0101rya is also often used in [[Jainism]], in Jain texts such as the Pannavanasutta.\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn the 19th century, linguists still supposed that the age of a language determined its \"superiority\" (because it was assumed to have genealogical purity).

Muller was careful to note in his later work that he thought Aryan was a linguistic category rather than a racial one. Nevertheless, scholars used Muller's invasion theory to propose their own visions of racial conquest through South Asia and the Indian Ocean. In 1885, the New Zealand polymath [[Edward Tregear]] argued that an \"Aryan tidal-wave\" had washed over India and continued to push south, through the islands of the East Indian archipelago, reaching the distant shores of New Zealand. Scholars such as [[John Batchelor (missionary)|John Batchelor]], [[Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Br\u00e9au|Armand de Quatrefages]], and [[Daniel Garrison Brinton|Daniel Brinton]] extended this invasion theory to the Philippines, Hawaii, and Japan, identifying indigenous peoples who they believed were the descendants of early Aryan conquerors.<ref name=Robinson2016>{{Cite book|title=The Lost White Tribe: Explorers, Scientists, and the Theory that Changed a Continent|last=Robinson|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780199978489|location=New York|pages=147\u2013161}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1850s [[Arthur de Gobineau]] supposed that \"Aryan\" corresponded to the suggested prehistoric Indo-European culture (1853\u20131855, ''Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races'').

The \"[[master race]]\", according to de Gobineau, were the Northern European \"Aryans\", who had remained \"racially pure\". Southern Europeans (to include Spaniards and Southern Frenchmen), Eastern Europeans, North Africans, Middle Easterners, Iranians, Central Asians, Indians, he all considered racially mixed, degenerated through the [[miscegenation]], and thus less than ideal. <!--While de Gobineau still saw the Northern Europeans as a subgroup of the \"Aryans\" (i.e. he did not equate Nordic peoples with \"Aryans\", but merely considered them to be the best representatives of it)-->\n\nBy the 1880s a number of linguists and anthropologists argued that the \"Aryans\" themselves had originated somewhere in northern Europe. A specific region began to crystallize when the linguist [[Karl Penka]] (''Die Herkunft der Arier. Neue Beitr\u00e4ge zur historischen Anthropologie der europ\u00e4ischen V\u00f6lker'', 1886) popularized the idea that the \"Aryans\" had emerged in [[Scandinavia]] and could be identified by the distinctive Nordic characteristics of blond hair and blue eyes. The distinguished biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] agreed with him, coining the term \"Xanthochroi\" to refer to fair-skinned Europeans (as opposed to darker Mediterranean peoples, who Huxley called \"Melanochroi\").<ref>{{citation|last = Huxley| first = Thomas| title=The Aryan Question and Pre-Historic Man|journal=The Nineteenth Century|year=1890|issue=XI/1890|url = http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE7/Aryan.html}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Passing of the Great Race - Map 4.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Madison Grant]]'s vision of the distribution of \"Nordics\" (red), \"Alpines\" (green) and \"Mediterraneans\" (yellow).]]\n[[File:Ripley map of cephalic index in Europe.png|right|thumb|300px|[[William Z.

A similar rationale was followed by [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] in his book ''L'Aryen et son r\u00f4le social'' (1899, \"The Aryan and his Social Role\"). To this idea of \"races\", Vacher de Lapouge espoused what he termed ''[[eugenics|selectionism]]'', and which had two aims: first, achieving the annihilation of trade unionists, considered \"degenerate\"; second, the prevention of labour dissatisfaction through the creation of \"types\" of man, each \"designed\" for one specific task (See the novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' for a fictional treatment of this idea).\n\nMeanwhile, in India, the [[British Raj|British colonial government]] had followed de Gobineau's arguments along another line, and had fostered the idea of a superior \"Aryan race\" that co-opted the [[Indian caste system]] in favor of imperial interests.<ref name=\"Thapar\">{{citation|last=Thapar|first=Romila|title=The Theory of Aryan Race and India: History and Politics|journal=Social Scientist|volume=24|issue=1/3|date= January 1, 1996 |pages=3\u201329|doi=10.2307/3520116|issn=0970-0293|publisher=Social Scientist|jstor=3520116}}</ref><ref name=\"Leopold\">{{citation|last=Leopold|first=Joan|title=British Applications of the Aryan Theory of Race to India, 1850\u20131870|journal=The English Historical Review|volume=89|issue=352|year=1974|pages=578\u2013603|doi=10.1093/ehr/LXXXIX.CCCLII.578}}</ref> In its fully developed form, the British-mediated interpretation foresaw a segregation of Aryan and non-Aryan along the lines of caste, with the upper castes being \"Aryan\" and the lower ones being \"non-Aryan\". The European developments not only allowed the British to identify themselves as high-caste, but also allowed the Brahmins to view themselves as on-par with the British. Further, it provoked the reinterpretation of Indian history in racialist and, in opposition, [[Indian Nationalist]] terms,<ref name=\"Thapar\" /><ref name=\"Leopold\" /> and \u2013 in following a special interpretation of [[Max M\u00fcller]]'s identification of \"Aryan\" as a national name \u2013 this gave rise recently among [[Hindu nationalists]] to the \"[[indigenous Aryans]]\" or so-called \"Out of India\" theory, disputed by many scholars in academia, which seeks an Indian origin of the Indo-European \"Aryans\".\n\nIn ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888), [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] described the \"[[Root race#The fifth root race (Aryan)|Aryan root race]]\" as the fifth of seven \"[[Root race]]s\", dating their [[soul]]s as having begun to [[Reincarnation|incarnate]] about a million years ago in [[Atlantis]].

For example, [[Adolf Hitler]] and many Nazi officials had dark hair and were still considered members of the [[Aryan race]] under Nazi racial doctrine, because the determination of an individual's racial type depended on a preponderance of many characteristics in an individual rather than on just one defining feature.<ref>\"The range of blond hair color in pure Nordic peoples runs from flaxen and red to shades of chestnut and brown... It must be clearly understood that blondness of hair and of eye is not a final test of Nordic race. The Nordics include all the blonds, and also those of darker hair or eye when possessed of a preponderance of other Nordic characters. In this sense the word \"blond\" means those lighter shades of hair or eye color in contrast to the very dark or black shades which are termed brunet. The meaning of \"blond\" as now used is therefore not limited to the lighter or flaxen shades as in colloquial speech. In England among Nordic populations there are large numbers of individuals with hazel brown eyes joined with the light brown or chestnut hair which is the typical hair shade of the English and Americans. This combination is also common in Holland and Westphalia and is frequently associated with a very fair skin. These men are all of \"blond\" aspect and constitution and consequently are to be classed as members of the Nordic race.\" Quoted in Grant, 1922, p. 26.</ref>\n\nIn September 1935, the Nazis passed the [[Nuremberg Laws]].

In the 19th century, \"language\" was considered a property of \"ethnicity\", and thus the speakers of the Indo-Iranian or Indo-European languages came to be called the \"[[Aryan race]]\", as contradistinguished from what came to be called the \"[[Semitic people|Semitic race]]\". By the late 19th century, among some people, the notions of an \"Aryan race\" became closely linked to [[Nordicism]], which posited Northern European racial superiority over all other peoples. This \"[[master race]]\" ideal engendered both the \"[[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]]\" programs of [[Nazi Germany]], in which the classification of people as \"Aryan\" and \"non-Aryan\" was most emphatically directed towards the exclusion of [[Jews]].<ref>{{citation|last=Campt|first=Tina|title=Other Germans: Black Germans and the Politics of Race, Gender, and Memory in the Third Reich|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|year=2004|page=143}}</ref><ref group=note>Under the 1933 ''Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service'', a non-Aryan was defined as \"an individual descended from a non-Aryan (in particular Jewish parents or grandparents)\" ({{harvnb|Campt|2004|p=143}}).</ref> By the end of World War II, the word 'Aryan' had become associated by many with the racial ideologies and atrocities committed by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]].\n\nWestern notions of an \"[[Aryan race]]\" rose to prominence in late-19th- and early-20th-century [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racialism]], an idea most notably embraced by [[Nazism]].

The word was used by [[Herodotus]] in reference to the Iranian [[Medes]] whom he describes as the people who \"were once universally known as Aryans\".{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=180}}\n\nThe meaning of 'Aryan' that was adopted into the English language in the late 18th century was the one associated with the technical term used in comparative philology, which in turn had the same meaning as that evident in the very oldest [[Old Indo-Aryan]] usage, i.e. as a (self-) identifier of \"[[Indo-Aryan peoples|(speakers of) Indo-Aryan languages]]\".<ref name=\"OED\"/><ref group=note>The context being religious, Max M\u00fcller understood this to especially mean \"the worshipers of the gods of the Brahmans\".

This idea can then also be found in Iranian texts.</ref> This usage was simultaneously influenced by a word that appeared in classical sources (Latin and Greek ''\u1f08\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2'' ''Arianes'', e.g. in Pliny 1.133 and Strabo 15.2.1\u20138), and recognized to be the same as that which appeared in living Iranian languages, where it was a (self-)identifier of the \"[[Iranian peoples|(speakers of) Iranian languages]]\". Accordingly, 'Aryan' came to refer to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|languages of the Indo-Iranian language group]], and by extension, native [[Indo-Iranians|speakers of those languages]].<ref>{{citation|last=Siegert|first=Hans|title=Zur Geschichte der Begriffe 'Arier' und 'Arisch'|journal=W\u00f6rter und Sachen|series=New Series|volume=4|year=1941\u20131942|pages=84\u201399}}</ref>\n\n=== Avestan ===\nThe term Arya is used in ancient [[Persian language]] texts, for example in the [[Behistun inscription]] from the 5th century BCE, in which the Persian kings [[Darius the Great]] and [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] are described as \"Aryans of Aryan stock\" (''arya arya chi\u00e7a''). The inscription also refers to the deity [[Ahura Mazda]] as \"the god of the Aryans\", and to the ancient Persian language as \"Aryan\". In this sense the word seems to have referred to the elite culture of the ancient Iranians, including both linguistic, cultural and religious aspects. {{sfn|Briant|2002|p=180}}{{sfn|Kuz'mina|2007|pp=371\u2013372}} The word also has a central place in the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian religion]] in which the \"Aryan expanse\" (''Airyana Vaejah'')  is described as the mythical homeland of the Iranian people's and as the center of the world.{{sfn|Rose|2011}}\n\n=== Vedic Sanskrit ===\n\nThe term Arya is used 36 times in 34 hymns in the [[Rigveda]].\nAccording to Talageri (2000, The Rig Veda. A Historical Analysis)\n\"''the particular Vedic Aryans of the Rigveda were one section among these [[Puru (Vedic tribe)|Purus]], who called themselves [[Bh\u0101ratas|Bharatas]].''\" Thus it is possible, according to Talageri, that at one point Arya did refer to a specific tribe.\n\nWhile the word may ultimately derive from a tribal name, already in the Rigveda it appears as a religious distinction, separating those who sacrifice \"properly\" from those who do not belong to the [[historical Vedic religion]], presaging the usage in later Hinduism where the term comes to denote religious righteousness or piety. In [[Mandala 9|RV 9]].63.5, ''{{IAST|\u00e2rya}}'' \"noble, pious, righteous\" is used as contrasting with ''{{IAST|\u00e1r\u0101van}}'' \"not liberal, envious, hostile\":\n:''{{IAST|\u00edndra\u1e43 v\u00e1rdhanto apt\u00fara\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e47v\u00e1nto v\u00ed\u015bvam \u00e2ryam apaghn\u00e1nto \u00e1r\u0101v\u1e47a\u1e25}}''\n:\"[the [[Soma (drink)|Soma]]-drops], performing every noble work, active, augmenting Indra's strength, driving away the godless ones.\" (trans.

Arya is typically one who follows the [[Dharma]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} This is historically applicable for any person living anywhere in [[Bharata Varsha]] or vast India.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\nAccording to the [[Mahabharata]], a person's behaviour (not wealth or learning) determines if he can be called an Arya.<ref>(Mbh: ''tasyam samsadi sarvasyam ksatttaram pujayamy aham/ vrttena hi bhavaty aryo na dhanena na vidyaya''. 0050880521)</ref><ref name=\"Bronkhorst 1999\">Deshpande/ Gomez in Bronkhorst & Deshpande 1999</ref>\n\n=== Religious use ===\nThe word ''\u0101rya'' is often found in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain texts. In the Indian spiritual context, it can be applied to Rishis or to someone who has mastered the four noble truths and entered upon the spiritual path. According to Indian leader [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the religions of [[India]] may be called collectively ''\u0101rya dharma,'' a term that includes the religions that originated in the [[Indian subcontinent]] (e.g. [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and possibly [[Sikhism]]).<ref>\n{{cite book |last=Kumar |first=Priya |title=Beyond tolerance and hospitality: Muslims as strangers and minor subjects in Hindu nationalist and Indian nationalist discourse |editor=Elisabeth Weber |work=Living Together: Jacques Derrida's Communities of Violence and Peace |publisher=Fordham University Press |year=2012 |ISBN=9780823249923 |p=96}}\n</ref>\n\n==== Hinduism ====\n\"''O my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low family like that of a [[Chandala]], is situated on the highest platform of self-realization.

Those who follow their occupational duties under Your supervision, being equal to all living entities, moving and nonmoving, and not considering high and low, are called \u0100ryans. Such \u0100ryans worship You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.''\" (Bhagavata Purana 6.16.43).\n\nAccording to [[Swami Vivekananda]], \"''A child materially born is not an Arya; the child born in spirituality is an Arya.''\" He further elaborated, referring to the [[Manu Smriti]]: \"''Says our great law-giver, [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]], giving the definition of an Arya, 'He is the Arya, who is born through prayer.' Every child not born through prayer is illegitimate, according to the great law-giver: The child must be prayed for.

[[Sri Aurobindo]] published a journal combining nationalism and spiritualism under the title ''[[Arya (journal)|Arya]]'' from 1914 to 1921.\n\n==== Buddhism ====\n{{main|Arya (Buddhism)}}\nThe word ''\u0101rya'' ([[P\u0101li]]: ''ariya''), in the sense of \"noble\" or \"exalted\", is very frequently used in Buddhist texts to designate a spiritual warrior or hero, which use this term much more often than Hindu or Jain texts. Buddha's [[Dharma]] and [[Vinaya]] are the ''ariyassa dhammavinayo''. The [[Four Noble Truths]] are called the ''catv\u0101ry \u0101ryasaty\u0101ni'' ([[Sanskrit]]) or ''catt\u0101ri ariyasacc\u0101ni'' (Pali). The [[Noble Eightfold Path]] is called the ''\u0101ryam\u0101rga'' (Sanskrit, also ''{{IAST|\u0101ry\u0101\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45gikam\u0101rga}}'') or ''ariyamagga'' (P\u0101li).\n\nIn [[Buddhist texts]], the \u0101rya pudgala (Pali: ''ariyapuggala, \"noble person\")'' are those who have the Buddhist ''[[\u015b\u012bla]]'' (P\u0101li ''s\u012bla'', meaning \"virtue\") and who have reached a certain level of spiritual advancement on the [[Buddhist paths to liberation|Buddhist path]], mainly one of the [[Four stages of enlightenment|four levels of awakening]] or in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, a [[bodhisattva]] level ([[Bh\u016bmi (Buddhism)|bhumi]]). Those who despise Buddhism are often called \"''an\u0101ryas''\".\n\n==== Jainism ====\nThe word \u0101rya is also often used in [[Jainism]], in Jain texts such as the Pannavanasutta.\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn the 19th century, linguists still supposed that the age of a language determined its \"superiority\" (because it was assumed to have genealogical purity).

Muller was careful to note in his later work that he thought Aryan was a linguistic category rather than a racial one. Nevertheless, scholars used Muller's invasion theory to propose their own visions of racial conquest through South Asia and the Indian Ocean. In 1885, the New Zealand polymath [[Edward Tregear]] argued that an \"Aryan tidal-wave\" had washed over India and continued to push south, through the islands of the East Indian archipelago, reaching the distant shores of New Zealand. Scholars such as [[John Batchelor (missionary)|John Batchelor]], [[Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Br\u00e9au|Armand de Quatrefages]], and [[Daniel Garrison Brinton|Daniel Brinton]] extended this invasion theory to the Philippines, Hawaii, and Japan, identifying indigenous peoples who they believed were the descendants of early Aryan conquerors.<ref name=Robinson2016>{{Cite book|title=The Lost White Tribe: Explorers, Scientists, and the Theory that Changed a Continent|last=Robinson|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780199978489|location=New York|pages=147\u2013161}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1850s [[Arthur de Gobineau]] supposed that \"Aryan\" corresponded to the suggested prehistoric Indo-European culture (1853\u20131855, ''Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races''). Further, de Gobineau believed that there were three basic races \u2013 white, yellow and black \u2013 and that everything else was caused by race [[miscegenation]], which de Gobineau argued was the cause of chaos. The \"[[master race]]\", according to de Gobineau, were the Northern European \"Aryans\", who had remained \"racially pure\". Southern Europeans (to include Spaniards and Southern Frenchmen), Eastern Europeans, North Africans, Middle Easterners, Iranians, Central Asians, Indians, he all considered racially mixed, degenerated through the [[miscegenation]], and thus less than ideal. <!--While de Gobineau still saw the Northern Europeans as a subgroup of the \"Aryans\" (i.e. he did not equate Nordic peoples with \"Aryans\", but merely considered them to be the best representatives of it)-->\n\nBy the 1880s a number of linguists and anthropologists argued that the \"Aryans\" themselves had originated somewhere in northern Europe. A specific region began to crystallize when the linguist [[Karl Penka]] (''Die Herkunft der Arier. Neue Beitr\u00e4ge zur historischen Anthropologie der europ\u00e4ischen V\u00f6lker'', 1886) popularized the idea that the \"Aryans\" had emerged in [[Scandinavia]] and could be identified by the distinctive Nordic characteristics of blond hair and blue eyes. The distinguished biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] agreed with him, coining the term \"Xanthochroi\" to refer to fair-skinned Europeans (as opposed to darker Mediterranean peoples, who Huxley called \"Melanochroi\").<ref>{{citation|last = Huxley| first = Thomas| title=The Aryan Question and Pre-Historic Man|journal=The Nineteenth Century|year=1890|issue=XI/1890|url = http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE7/Aryan.html}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Passing of the Great Race - Map 4.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Madison Grant]]'s vision of the distribution of \"Nordics\" (red), \"Alpines\" (green) and \"Mediterraneans\" (yellow).]]\n[[File:Ripley map of cephalic index in Europe.png|right|thumb|300px|[[William Z.

A similar rationale was followed by [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] in his book ''L'Aryen et son r\u00f4le social'' (1899, \"The Aryan and his Social Role\"). To this idea of \"races\", Vacher de Lapouge espoused what he termed ''[[eugenics|selectionism]]'', and which had two aims: first, achieving the annihilation of trade unionists, considered \"degenerate\"; second, the prevention of labour dissatisfaction through the creation of \"types\" of man, each \"designed\" for one specific task (See the novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' for a fictional treatment of this idea).\n\nMeanwhile, in India, the [[British Raj|British colonial government]] had followed de Gobineau's arguments along another line, and had fostered the idea of a superior \"Aryan race\" that co-opted the [[Indian caste system]] in favor of imperial interests.<ref name=\"Thapar\">{{citation|last=Thapar|first=Romila|title=The Theory of Aryan Race and India: History and Politics|journal=Social Scientist|volume=24|issue=1/3|date= January 1, 1996 |pages=3\u201329|doi=10.2307/3520116|issn=0970-0293|publisher=Social Scientist|jstor=3520116}}</ref><ref name=\"Leopold\">{{citation|last=Leopold|first=Joan|title=British Applications of the Aryan Theory of Race to India, 1850\u20131870|journal=The English Historical Review|volume=89|issue=352|year=1974|pages=578\u2013603|doi=10.1093/ehr/LXXXIX.CCCLII.578}}</ref> In its fully developed form, the British-mediated interpretation foresaw a segregation of Aryan and non-Aryan along the lines of caste, with the upper castes being \"Aryan\" and the lower ones being \"non-Aryan\". The European developments not only allowed the British to identify themselves as high-caste, but also allowed the Brahmins to view themselves as on-par with the British.
