It covers the northern part of the [[Maluku Islands]], bordering the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the north, the [[Halmahera Sea]] to the east, the [[Molucca Sea]] to the west, and the [[Seram Sea]] to the south. The provincial capital is [[Sofifi]] on the largest island of [[Halmahera]], while the largest city is the island city of [[Ternate]]. The population of North Maluku was 1,038,087 in the 2010 census,<ref name=\"bps2010\">[http://www.bps.go.id/65tahun/SP2010_agregat_data_perProvinsi.pdf Central Bureau of Statistics: ''Census 2010''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113144717/http://www.bps.go.id/65tahun/SP2010_agregat_data_perProvinsi.pdf |date=2010-11-13 }}, retrieved 17 January 2011 {{in lang|id}}</ref> making it one of the least-populous provinces in Indonesia; at the latest estimate (July 2019) the population number had risen to 1,235,700.<ref>Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2019.</ref> \n\nNorth Maluku was originally the centre of the four largest Islamic sultanates in the eastern Indonesian archipelago\u2014[[Sultanate of Bacan|Bacan]], Jailolo, [[Sultanate of Tidore|Tidore]] and the [[Sultanate of Ternate|Ternate]]\u2014known as the ''Moloku Kie Raha'' (Four Mountain Sultanates). Upon Europeans' arrival at the beginning of the 16th century, North Maluku became the site of competition between the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] to control the trade. In the end, the Dutch emerged victorious, beginning the three-century Dutch rule in the region. The [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] invaded the region during [[World War II]], and Ternate became the centre of the Japanese ruler's position for the Pacific region. Following the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesia's independence]], the region became a part of the province of [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]].\n\nThe province of North Maluku was officially established on 12 October 1999. Ternate served as its ''de facto'' capital until 2010, when the provincial government moved to [[Sofifi]]. The movement of the regional economy in North Maluku is largely relies on the agricultural sector, fisheries and other types of marine products. The main commodities that support economic pulse in North Maluku include [[copra]], [[nutmeg]], [[clove]]s, [[Fishery|fisheries]], [[gold]] and [[nickel]]. North Maluku's natural products include [[rice]], [[Maize|corn]], roasted sweet potatoes, [[bean]]s, [[coconut]], potatoes, nutmeg, [[sago]], and [[eucalyptus]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Etymology ===\nHistorically, the term Maluku referred to the four sultanate centers in North Maluku, namely Ternate, Tidore, Bacan and Jailolo. A certain form of confederation of the four kingdoms which most likely emerged in the 14th century, was called Moloku Kie Raha or \"Four Mountain Sultanates in Maluku\". Although then the four kingdoms expanded and covered the entire North Maluku region (now) and parts of [[Sulawesi]] and [[New Guinea]], the expansion area was not included in the term Maluku which only referred to the four sultanate centers of North Maluku.\n\nThe etymology of the word ''Maluku'' is not very clear, and it has been a matter of debate for many experts. A common theory says that the term ''Maluku'' originates from the [[Arabic Language|Arabic]] phrase ''Jaziratul Muluk'' (\u062c\u0632\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0648\u0643), which means \"Country of the Kings\" (''muluk'' is the plural form of ''malik'', which means king). Thus the Ambon archipelago, the Banda archipelago and island groups to the south were at that time not included in the original sense of the term.\n\n=== Pre-colonial era ===\nThe island of [[Ternate]] began to bustle in the early 13th century. Early Ternate residents were residents of the exodus from [[Halmahera]]. Initially in Ternate there were 4 villages, each headed by a momole (head of the clan). It was they who first made contact with merchants who came from all directions looking for spices. The population of Ternate became increasingly heterogeneous with settlements of [[Arabs|Arab]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] traders. Because of the increasingly busy trading activities were added with threats that often came from pirates, the Momole Guna Tobona leaders held a conference to form a stronger organization and appoint a single leader as king.\n\nIn 1257, Momole Ciko, Sampalu's leader was elected and appointed as the first kolano (king) with the title Baab Mashur Malamo (1257-1272). The Kingdom of Gapi is centered in the village of Ternate, which in later developments is getting bigger and more crowded so that the population is also referred to as Gam Lamo or the big village (later people call Gam Lamo with Gamalama). The greater and more popular Ternate, so that people would rather say Ternate kingdom than the kingdom of Gapi. Under the leadership of several generations of the next ruler, Ternate developed from a kingdom which only served a small island to become the most influential and largest empire in eastern Indonesia, especially the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]].\n\nIn the early days of Ternate people was led by the momole. After forming a kingdom, a leadership position was held by a king called Kolano. Starting in the mid-15th century, Islam was totally adopted by the kingdom and the application of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] was put in place. Sultan Zainal Abidin left the Kolano title and replaced it with the title of [[Sultan]]. The scholars became important figures in the kingdom.\n\nOpposite of Ternate lies the island of [[Tidore]], the seat of the Kingdom of Tidore. According to the genealogies of the kings of Ternate and Tidore, the first King Tidore was Muhammad Naqil who ascended the throne in 1081. It was only at the end of the 14th century that [[Islam]] was made the official religion of the Kingdom of Tidore by 11th King Tidore, Sultan Djamaluddin, who was willing to enter [[Islam]] thanks to the preaching of Sheikh Mansur from [[Arabian Peninsula|Arab]].\n[[File:AMH-6727-KB Dutch being entertained by the king of Ternate.jpg|thumb|Dutch being entertained by the king of Ternate]]\n\n=== Colonial era ===\nThe first European to land in the Moluccas is [[Ludovico di Varthema]], an [[Italians|Italian]] exploler. In 1512, the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] set foot in Ternate for the first time under the leadership of [[Francisco Serr\u00e3o]], with the approval of the sultan, Portugal was allowed to establish a trading post in Ternate. Portugal came not only to trade but to control the trade in [[spice]]s, [[nutmeg]] and [[clove]]s in Maluku. For this reason, they must first conquer Ternate.\n\nSultan Bayanullah died leaving the heirs who were still very young. The widow of the sultan, Consort Nukila and Prince Taruwese, sister of the deceased sultan acted as guardian. Empress Nukila from [[Tidore]] intended to unite Ternate and Tidore under one crown, one of his two sons, Pangeran Hidayat (later Sultan Dayalu) and prince Abu Hayat (later Sultan Abu Hayat II). While Prince Tarruwese wanted a throne for himself.\n\nThe Portuguese took advantage of this opportunity and pitted both of them until a civil war broke out. Empress Nukila's side was supported by Tidore while Prince Taruwese was supported by Portugal. After winning the victory Prince Taruwese was betrayed and killed by Portugal. The governor of Portugal acted as an adviser to the kingdom and with influence had succeeded in persuading the royal council to appoint prince Tabariji as sultan. But when Sultan Tabariji began to show hostility, he was slandered and exiled to [[Goa]], [[India]]. There he was forced by Portugal to sign an agreement to make Ternate a Christian kingdom and a royal vassal of Portugal, but the agreement was flatly rejected by Sultan Khairun.\n\nPortugal's treatment of his brothers made Sultan Khairun furious and determined to drive Portugal from Maluku. Portugal's actions caused anger among the people who finally stood behind Sultan Khairun. In response, the Portuguese governor, Lopez de Mesquita invited Sultan Khairun to a conference to negotiate before cruelly murdering the sultan who came without his bodyguard.\n\nThe assassination of Sultan Khairun increasingly encouraged the people of Ternate to expel Portugal, even the entire Moluccas now supported the leadership and struggle of [[Sultan Babullah of Ternate|Sultan Baabullah]], the fortress of Portugal throughout Maluku and the eastern regions of Indonesia were attacked. After 5 years of war, Portugal finally were expelled from Maluku in 1575. Under the leadership of Sultan Baabullah, Ternate reached its peak, the area stretched from [[North Sulawesi|North]] and [[Central Sulawesi]] in the west to the [[Marshall Islands]] in the east, from the southern [[Philippines]] in the north to the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]] in the south.\n\nAfter Sultan Baabullah died, the sultanate began to weaken, the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] which had [[Iberian Union|united]] with Portugal in 1580 tried to regain control of Maluku by attacking Ternate. With Spain's new power strengthening its position in the [[Philippines]], Ternate also formed an alliance with [[Mindanao]] to drive Spain away but failed, even Sultan Said Barakati was captured by the Spaniards and thrown into exile in [[Manila]].\n\nThe sultanate requested the help of the [[Netherlands]] in 1603. The Dutch expelled the Spanish from Maluku. On June 26, 1607 the Sultan of Ternate signed a  monopoly contract in Maluku in return for Dutch assistance against Spain. In 1607, the Dutch also built the [[Fort Oranje (Ternate)|Fort Oranje]] on Ternate, which was their first stronghold in the archipelago. From the beginning, unhealthy and unbalanced relations between the Netherlands and Ternate caused dissatisfaction with the rulers and nobles of Ternate. Among them are Prince Hidayat, the Ambonese young king who was also a former regent of Ternate, leading the opposition who opposed the position of the sultan and the Dutch. He ignored the Dutch trade monopoly agreement by selling spices to [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Makassar people|Makassar]] traders. Meanwhile, the [[Sultanate of Tidore]], succeeded in rejecting Dutch presence in their territory and remained an independent area until the end of the 18th century. But this did not last long because the [[Dutch East India Company]] formed by the Dutch to control the spice trade in Maluku succeeded in conquering Ternate and Tidore with an orderly, neat and controlled strategy and procedure in the form of a strong organization. In the end, both Ternate and Tidore as well as other kingdoms in Maluku were annexed into the [[Dutch East Indies]]. For the next three century, the archipelago would remain under Dutch control.\n[[File:31st Division landing on Morotai.jpg|thumb|[[United States Army]] [[31st Infantry Division (United States)|31st Infantry Division]] landing in Morotai during the [[Battle of Morotai]]]]\n\n=== Modern era ===\nThe [[Empire of Japan]] invaded Maluku early in 1942 as part of its [[Dutch East Indies Campaign]] of [[World War II]], ousting the Dutch from the region. Halmahera became the site of a [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] naval base at [[Kao, Indonesia|Kao]] Bay. 2 years later, [[United States Armed Forces|US forces]] and their allies launched the [[Battle of Morotai]] in 1944; bombing the island in August and invading it in September. [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese forces]] on Morotai held out until 1945 but failed to expel the Allied invaders. In the latter part of 1944, 61,000 personnel landed on Morotai.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=102}} Two thirds of them were engineers, who rapidly established facilities including harbors and two airstrips{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=102}} plus extensive fuel stores. The formal surrender of the Second Japanese Army took place at Morotai on 9 September 1945. The last [[Japanese holdout]] from the war, Private [[Teruo Nakamura]] ([[Amis language|Amis]]: Attun Palalin), was discovered by the [[Indonesian Air Force]] on Morotai, and surrendered to a search patrol on December 18, 1974.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Last Last Soldier?|date=January 13, 1975|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917064,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|newspaper=Time}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the Japanese surrendered, the Dutch regained control of the region, before handing it over to the Indonesian government in 1949. In 1957, the [[Permesta]] movement was declared in [[Manado]], [[North Sulawesi]], aiming to overthrow the Indonesian government, The movement received support from the [[United States]] and [[Taiwan]]. In January 1958 the CIA began developing covert support networks to the PRRI and Permesta rebels. Supported by the American, Permesta forces captures Morotai and Halmahera as well as several islands. On May 1958 [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]] started to gather amphibious forces to retake both Morotai and the rebel-held town of [[Jailolo (town)|Jailolo]] on the island of [[Halmahera]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=134}} By May 16 the assault fleet started to gather in [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] harbour and on May 20 its troops landed on Morotai while \u00e9lite ''Pasukan Gerak Tjepat'' (PGT or \"Quick Reaction Force\") troops parachuted onto the island.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=147}} The Permesta force's surrender was as quick as its capture of the island less than a month before.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=147}} It alarmed the Permesta rebels who had captured Jailolo, many of whom promptly fled back to [[North Sulawesi]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=147}} Thereafter the rebellion was largely confined to the [[Minahassa Peninsula]] of Sulawesi, where Permesta remnants waged a guerilla campaign until the last unit surrendered in January 1962.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=161}}\n[[File:Indonesian Navy Commando Corps on Morotai Beach, Jalesveva Jayamahe, p154.jpg|thumb|Indonesian Navy Commando Corps on Morotai Beach during the Permesta insurgency]]\nDuring the administration of President [[B. J. Habibie]], the idea emerged to accelerate development in several potential regions by forming new provinces. Maluku is one of the potential areas for accelerating development through the expansion of the province, mainly because of the pace of development between the northern and southern regions and or between the middle and southeast regions that are not harmonious. On that basis, the government established North Maluku Province (with the temporary capital in Ternate) which was confirmed by Law Number 46 of 1999 concerning the division of North Maluku Province, [[Buru Regency]] and [[Tanimbar Islands Regency]].<ref>Lembaran Negara Tahun 1999 Nomor 174, Tambahan Lembaran Negera Nomor 3895</ref>\n\nNorth Maluku was also the site of the [[Maluku sectarian conflict]]. Although the area is more peaceful than the neighbouring Maluku province, there were several clashes between Christians and Muslims in Ternate and Halmahera. Several people were killed in [[Kao, Indonesia|Kao]], Halmahera as residents of both faiths and [[Makian]]ese Muslim migrants fought for three days, and the majority of sources state that the violence had started with the invasion of Sosol, one of the two villages destroyed by the Makianese gang.<ref name=north>{{cite journal|last=Duncan|first=Christopher R.|title=The Other Maluku: Chronologies of Conflict in North Maluku|journal=Indonesia|date=October 2005|volume=80|issue=80|series=Southeast Asia Program Publications at Cornell University|pages=53\u201380|jstor=3351319}}</ref><ref name=\"braith200\">{{harvnb|Braithwaite|2010|pp=200\u2013201}}</ref> A team of leaders was tasked with securing peace by the regional government, however no modifications were made to the [[redistricting]] decision and tension remained.<ref name=\"braith200\" /> The conflict spread from Halmahera to neighbouring Ternate and Tidore. On 6 November 1999, a several-hundred strong Muslim gang, led by local Makianese political elite and thought to be mostly Makianese refugees, raged through [[Ternate]] attacking the Christian minority there also.<ref name=braith202>{{harvnb|Braithwaite|2010|pp=202\u2013203}}</ref> The police forces of Ternate were only able to guard their own institutions from attack, yet the traditional guards of the [[Sultan]] of Ternate, mostly composed of local Ternate Muslims, were particularly effective at protecting the local Christian population from attack.<ref name=\"braith214\">{{harvnb|Braithwaite|2010|p=214}}</ref> The Sultan's guard had both established secure perimeters around areas of the city, including the mostly [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese-owned]] business district, and physically stood between the mobs and possible victims in some cases and were later commended for preventing a potential massacre. At least 4 people died, however, and the Indonesian Navy later evacuated the several thousand Christian residents of both islands to [[Bitung]] and [[Manado]] in [[North Sulawesi]].\n\nThe conflict was finally resolved after the [[Malino II Accord]] was signed by both parties.\n\n==Geography==\nThe islands of North Maluku are mostly of volcanic origin, with the volcanoes of [[Dukono]] on Halmahera, [[Gamalama]] on Ternate still active and the whole of Tidore consisting of a large [[stratovolcano]]. The [[rainforest]]s of [[Halmahera]], [[Morotai]], the [[Obi Islands]], the [[Bacan]] islands and other islands of North Maluku have been described by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as the \"Halmahera rain forests\" [[ecoregion]] and are home to a number of plant and animal species unique to the islands, which are in the [[Wallacea]] transition zone, containing a mixture of species of Asian and [[Australasia ecozone|Australasian]] origin. The predominant trees of the forest are ''[[Anisoptera thurifera]]'', ''[[Hopea gregaria]]'', ''[[Hopea iriana]]'', ''[[Shorea assamica]]'', ''[[Shorea montigena]]'', ''[[Shorea selanica]]'', and ''[[Vatica rassak]]''.\n\nThe endemic mammals found here include the [[Obi mosaic-tailed rat]] (''Melomys obiensis''), [[masked flying fox]] (''Pteropus personatus''), and three arboreal [[marsupial]]s, the [[ornate cuscus|ornate]] (''Phalanger ornatus''), [[Rothschild's cuscus|Rothschild's]] (''P. rothschildi''), [[blue-eyed cuscus|blue-eyed]] (''P. matabiru'') and [[Gebe cuscus|Gebe]] (''P. alexandrae'') [[cuscus]]es. There are over two hundred different birds on the islands, twenty-six of which are endemic, a large number for this small island group. The endemics include four birds which are the only species in their [[genera]], including the elusive [[invisible rail]] (''Habroptila wallacii''), the [[white-streaked friarbird]] (''Melitograis gilolensis''), and two birds of paradise, the [[paradise-crow]] (''Lycocorax pyrrhopterus'') and [[Wallace's standardwing]] (''Semioptera wallacii''). The islands are also home to the largest bee in the world, [[Wallace's giant bee]] (''Megachile pluto'').<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|name=Halmahera Rain Forests|id=aa0106}}</ref>\n\nThe islands have a [[tropical rainforest climate]].\n\nMost of the natural forest remains on these mountainous islands, although much of the coastal and lowland areas have been cleared for clove-planting since the sixteenth century, especially on the islands of Ternate and [[Tidore]]. Logging has occurred more recently on Halmahera and Morotai.\n\nThe North Maluku Islands are formed by the movement of three tectonic plates, namely [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasia]], the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]] and [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australia]] which have occurred since the time of lime. this movement formed the archipelago volcanic archipelago that stretched from north to south in western Halmahera, including Ternate Island, Tidore Island, Moti Island, Mare Island and Makian Island. Halmahera Island itself is a volcanic island even though volcanic activity occurs only in a part of its territory.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nNorth Maluku Province was subdivided into seven [[Regency (Indonesia)|regencies]] and two autonomous [[Cities of Indonesia|cities]].

Upon Europeans' arrival at the beginning of the 16th century, North Maluku became the site of competition between the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] to control the trade. In the end, the Dutch emerged victorious, beginning the three-century Dutch rule in the region. The [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] invaded the region during [[World War II]], and Ternate became the centre of the Japanese ruler's position for the Pacific region. Following the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesia's independence]], the region became a part of the province of [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]].\n\nThe province of North Maluku was officially established on 12 October 1999. Ternate served as its ''de facto'' capital until 2010, when the provincial government moved to [[Sofifi]]. The movement of the regional economy in North Maluku is largely relies on the agricultural sector, fisheries and other types of marine products. The main commodities that support economic pulse in North Maluku include [[copra]], [[nutmeg]], [[clove]]s, [[Fishery|fisheries]], [[gold]] and [[nickel]]. North Maluku's natural products include [[rice]], [[Maize|corn]], roasted sweet potatoes, [[bean]]s, [[coconut]], potatoes, nutmeg, [[sago]], and [[eucalyptus]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Etymology ===\nHistorically, the term Maluku referred to the four sultanate centers in North Maluku, namely Ternate, Tidore, Bacan and Jailolo. A certain form of confederation of the four kingdoms which most likely emerged in the 14th century, was called Moloku Kie Raha or \"Four Mountain Sultanates in Maluku\". Although then the four kingdoms expanded and covered the entire North Maluku region (now) and parts of [[Sulawesi]] and [[New Guinea]], the expansion area was not included in the term Maluku which only referred to the four sultanate centers of North Maluku.\n\nThe etymology of the word ''Maluku'' is not very clear, and it has been a matter of debate for many experts. A common theory says that the term ''Maluku'' originates from the [[Arabic Language|Arabic]] phrase ''Jaziratul Muluk'' (\u062c\u0632\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0648\u0643), which means \"Country of the Kings\" (''muluk'' is the plural form of ''malik'', which means king). Thus the Ambon archipelago, the Banda archipelago and island groups to the south were at that time not included in the original sense of the term.\n\n=== Pre-colonial era ===\nThe island of [[Ternate]] began to bustle in the early 13th century. Early Ternate residents were residents of the exodus from [[Halmahera]]. Initially in Ternate there were 4 villages, each headed by a momole (head of the clan). It was they who first made contact with merchants who came from all directions looking for spices. The population of Ternate became increasingly heterogeneous with settlements of [[Arabs|Arab]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] traders. Because of the increasingly busy trading activities were added with threats that often came from pirates, the Momole Guna Tobona leaders held a conference to form a stronger organization and appoint a single leader as king.\n\nIn 1257, Momole Ciko, Sampalu's leader was elected and appointed as the first kolano (king) with the title Baab Mashur Malamo (1257-1272). The Kingdom of Gapi is centered in the village of Ternate, which in later developments is getting bigger and more crowded so that the population is also referred to as Gam Lamo or the big village (later people call Gam Lamo with Gamalama). The greater and more popular Ternate, so that people would rather say Ternate kingdom than the kingdom of Gapi. Under the leadership of several generations of the next ruler, Ternate developed from a kingdom which only served a small island to become the most influential and largest empire in eastern Indonesia, especially the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]].\n\nIn the early days of Ternate people was led by the momole. After forming a kingdom, a leadership position was held by a king called Kolano. Starting in the mid-15th century, Islam was totally adopted by the kingdom and the application of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] was put in place. Sultan Zainal Abidin left the Kolano title and replaced it with the title of [[Sultan]]. The scholars became important figures in the kingdom.\n\nOpposite of Ternate lies the island of [[Tidore]], the seat of the Kingdom of Tidore. According to the genealogies of the kings of Ternate and Tidore, the first King Tidore was Muhammad Naqil who ascended the throne in 1081. It was only at the end of the 14th century that [[Islam]] was made the official religion of the Kingdom of Tidore by 11th King Tidore, Sultan Djamaluddin, who was willing to enter [[Islam]] thanks to the preaching of Sheikh Mansur from [[Arabian Peninsula|Arab]].\n[[File:AMH-6727-KB Dutch being entertained by the king of Ternate.jpg|thumb|Dutch being entertained by the king of Ternate]]\n\n=== Colonial era ===\nThe first European to land in the Moluccas is [[Ludovico di Varthema]], an [[Italians|Italian]] exploler. In 1512, the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] set foot in Ternate for the first time under the leadership of [[Francisco Serr\u00e3o]], with the approval of the sultan, Portugal was allowed to establish a trading post in Ternate. Portugal came not only to trade but to control the trade in [[spice]]s, [[nutmeg]] and [[clove]]s in Maluku. For this reason, they must first conquer Ternate.\n\nSultan Bayanullah died leaving the heirs who were still very young. The widow of the sultan, Consort Nukila and Prince Taruwese, sister of the deceased sultan acted as guardian. Empress Nukila from [[Tidore]] intended to unite Ternate and Tidore under one crown, one of his two sons, Pangeran Hidayat (later Sultan Dayalu) and prince Abu Hayat (later Sultan Abu Hayat II). While Prince Tarruwese wanted a throne for himself.\n\nThe Portuguese took advantage of this opportunity and pitted both of them until a civil war broke out. Empress Nukila's side was supported by Tidore while Prince Taruwese was supported by Portugal. After winning the victory Prince Taruwese was betrayed and killed by Portugal. The governor of Portugal acted as an adviser to the kingdom and with influence had succeeded in persuading the royal council to appoint prince Tabariji as sultan. But when Sultan Tabariji began to show hostility, he was slandered and exiled to [[Goa]], [[India]]. There he was forced by Portugal to sign an agreement to make Ternate a Christian kingdom and a royal vassal of Portugal, but the agreement was flatly rejected by Sultan Khairun.\n\nPortugal's treatment of his brothers made Sultan Khairun furious and determined to drive Portugal from Maluku. Portugal's actions caused anger among the people who finally stood behind Sultan Khairun. In response, the Portuguese governor, Lopez de Mesquita invited Sultan Khairun to a conference to negotiate before cruelly murdering the sultan who came without his bodyguard.\n\nThe assassination of Sultan Khairun increasingly encouraged the people of Ternate to expel Portugal, even the entire Moluccas now supported the leadership and struggle of [[Sultan Babullah of Ternate|Sultan Baabullah]], the fortress of Portugal throughout Maluku and the eastern regions of Indonesia were attacked. After 5 years of war, Portugal finally were expelled from Maluku in 1575. Under the leadership of Sultan Baabullah, Ternate reached its peak, the area stretched from [[North Sulawesi|North]] and [[Central Sulawesi]] in the west to the [[Marshall Islands]] in the east, from the southern [[Philippines]] in the north to the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]] in the south.\n\nAfter Sultan Baabullah died, the sultanate began to weaken, the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] which had [[Iberian Union|united]] with Portugal in 1580 tried to regain control of Maluku by attacking Ternate. With Spain's new power strengthening its position in the [[Philippines]], Ternate also formed an alliance with [[Mindanao]] to drive Spain away but failed, even Sultan Said Barakati was captured by the Spaniards and thrown into exile in [[Manila]].\n\nThe sultanate requested the help of the [[Netherlands]] in 1603. The Dutch expelled the Spanish from Maluku. On June 26, 1607 the Sultan of Ternate signed a  monopoly contract in Maluku in return for Dutch assistance against Spain. In 1607, the Dutch also built the [[Fort Oranje (Ternate)|Fort Oranje]] on Ternate, which was their first stronghold in the archipelago. From the beginning, unhealthy and unbalanced relations between the Netherlands and Ternate caused dissatisfaction with the rulers and nobles of Ternate. Among them are Prince Hidayat, the Ambonese young king who was also a former regent of Ternate, leading the opposition who opposed the position of the sultan and the Dutch. He ignored the Dutch trade monopoly agreement by selling spices to [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Makassar people|Makassar]] traders. Meanwhile, the [[Sultanate of Tidore]], succeeded in rejecting Dutch presence in their territory and remained an independent area until the end of the 18th century. But this did not last long because the [[Dutch East India Company]] formed by the Dutch to control the spice trade in Maluku succeeded in conquering Ternate and Tidore with an orderly, neat and controlled strategy and procedure in the form of a strong organization. In the end, both Ternate and Tidore as well as other kingdoms in Maluku were annexed into the [[Dutch East Indies]]. For the next three century, the archipelago would remain under Dutch control.\n[[File:31st Division landing on Morotai.jpg|thumb|[[United States Army]] [[31st Infantry Division (United States)|31st Infantry Division]] landing in Morotai during the [[Battle of Morotai]]]]\n\n=== Modern era ===\nThe [[Empire of Japan]] invaded Maluku early in 1942 as part of its [[Dutch East Indies Campaign]] of [[World War II]], ousting the Dutch from the region. Halmahera became the site of a [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] naval base at [[Kao, Indonesia|Kao]] Bay. 2 years later, [[United States Armed Forces|US forces]] and their allies launched the [[Battle of Morotai]] in 1944; bombing the island in August and invading it in September. [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese forces]] on Morotai held out until 1945 but failed to expel the Allied invaders. In the latter part of 1944, 61,000 personnel landed on Morotai.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=102}} Two thirds of them were engineers, who rapidly established facilities including harbors and two airstrips{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=102}} plus extensive fuel stores. The formal surrender of the Second Japanese Army took place at Morotai on 9 September 1945. The last [[Japanese holdout]] from the war, Private [[Teruo Nakamura]] ([[Amis language|Amis]]: Attun Palalin), was discovered by the [[Indonesian Air Force]] on Morotai, and surrendered to a search patrol on December 18, 1974.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Last Last Soldier?|date=January 13, 1975|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917064,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|newspaper=Time}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the Japanese surrendered, the Dutch regained control of the region, before handing it over to the Indonesian government in 1949. In 1957, the [[Permesta]] movement was declared in [[Manado]], [[North Sulawesi]], aiming to overthrow the Indonesian government, The movement received support from the [[United States]] and [[Taiwan]]. In January 1958 the CIA began developing covert support networks to the PRRI and Permesta rebels. Supported by the American, Permesta forces captures Morotai and Halmahera as well as several islands. On May 1958 [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]] started to gather amphibious forces to retake both Morotai and the rebel-held town of [[Jailolo (town)|Jailolo]] on the island of [[Halmahera]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=134}} By May 16 the assault fleet started to gather in [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] harbour and on May 20 its troops landed on Morotai while \u00e9lite ''Pasukan Gerak Tjepat'' (PGT or \"Quick Reaction Force\") troops parachuted onto the island.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=147}} The Permesta force's surrender was as quick as its capture of the island less than a month before.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=147}} It alarmed the Permesta rebels who had captured Jailolo, many of whom promptly fled back to [[North Sulawesi]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=147}} Thereafter the rebellion was largely confined to the [[Minahassa Peninsula]] of Sulawesi, where Permesta remnants waged a guerilla campaign until the last unit surrendered in January 1962.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=161}}\n[[File:Indonesian Navy Commando Corps on Morotai Beach, Jalesveva Jayamahe, p154.jpg|thumb|Indonesian Navy Commando Corps on Morotai Beach during the Permesta insurgency]]\nDuring the administration of President [[B. J. Habibie]], the idea emerged to accelerate development in several potential regions by forming new provinces. Maluku is one of the potential areas for accelerating development through the expansion of the province, mainly because of the pace of development between the northern and southern regions and or between the middle and southeast regions that are not harmonious. On that basis, the government established North Maluku Province (with the temporary capital in Ternate) which was confirmed by Law Number 46 of 1999 concerning the division of North Maluku Province, [[Buru Regency]] and [[Tanimbar Islands Regency]].<ref>Lembaran Negara Tahun 1999 Nomor 174, Tambahan Lembaran Negera Nomor 3895</ref>\n\nNorth Maluku was also the site of the [[Maluku sectarian conflict]]. Although the area is more peaceful than the neighbouring Maluku province, there were several clashes between Christians and Muslims in Ternate and Halmahera. Several people were killed in [[Kao, Indonesia|Kao]], Halmahera as residents of both faiths and [[Makian]]ese Muslim migrants fought for three days, and the majority of sources state that the violence had started with the invasion of Sosol, one of the two villages destroyed by the Makianese gang.<ref name=north>{{cite journal|last=Duncan|first=Christopher R.|title=The Other Maluku: Chronologies of Conflict in North Maluku|journal=Indonesia|date=October 2005|volume=80|issue=80|series=Southeast Asia Program Publications at Cornell University|pages=53\u201380|jstor=3351319}}</ref><ref name=\"braith200\">{{harvnb|Braithwaite|2010|pp=200\u2013201}}</ref> A team of leaders was tasked with securing peace by the regional government, however no modifications were made to the [[redistricting]] decision and tension remained.<ref name=\"braith200\" /> The conflict spread from Halmahera to neighbouring Ternate and Tidore. On 6 November 1999, a several-hundred strong Muslim gang, led by local Makianese political elite and thought to be mostly Makianese refugees, raged through [[Ternate]] attacking the Christian minority there also.<ref name=braith202>{{harvnb|Braithwaite|2010|pp=202\u2013203}}</ref> The police forces of Ternate were only able to guard their own institutions from attack, yet the traditional guards of the [[Sultan]] of Ternate, mostly composed of local Ternate Muslims, were particularly effective at protecting the local Christian population from attack.<ref name=\"braith214\">{{harvnb|Braithwaite|2010|p=214}}</ref> The Sultan's guard had both established secure perimeters around areas of the city, including the mostly [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese-owned]] business district, and physically stood between the mobs and possible victims in some cases and were later commended for preventing a potential massacre. At least 4 people died, however, and the Indonesian Navy later evacuated the several thousand Christian residents of both islands to [[Bitung]] and [[Manado]] in [[North Sulawesi]].\n\nThe conflict was finally resolved after the [[Malino II Accord]] was signed by both parties.\n\n==Geography==\nThe islands of North Maluku are mostly of volcanic origin, with the volcanoes of [[Dukono]] on Halmahera, [[Gamalama]] on Ternate still active and the whole of Tidore consisting of a large [[stratovolcano]]. The [[rainforest]]s of [[Halmahera]], [[Morotai]], the [[Obi Islands]], the [[Bacan]] islands and other islands of North Maluku have been described by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as the \"Halmahera rain forests\" [[ecoregion]] and are home to a number of plant and animal species unique to the islands, which are in the [[Wallacea]] transition zone, containing a mixture of species of Asian and [[Australasia ecozone|Australasian]] origin. The predominant trees of the forest are ''[[Anisoptera thurifera]]'', ''[[Hopea gregaria]]'', ''[[Hopea iriana]]'', ''[[Shorea assamica]]'', ''[[Shorea montigena]]'', ''[[Shorea selanica]]'', and ''[[Vatica rassak]]''.\n\nThe endemic mammals found here include the [[Obi mosaic-tailed rat]] (''Melomys obiensis''), [[masked flying fox]] (''Pteropus personatus''), and three arboreal [[marsupial]]s, the [[ornate cuscus|ornate]] (''Phalanger ornatus''), [[Rothschild's cuscus|Rothschild's]] (''P. rothschildi''), [[blue-eyed cuscus|blue-eyed]] (''P. matabiru'') and [[Gebe cuscus|Gebe]] (''P. alexandrae'') [[cuscus]]es. There are over two hundred different birds on the islands, twenty-six of which are endemic, a large number for this small island group. The endemics include four birds which are the only species in their [[genera]], including the elusive [[invisible rail]] (''Habroptila wallacii''), the [[white-streaked friarbird]] (''Melitograis gilolensis''), and two birds of paradise, the [[paradise-crow]] (''Lycocorax pyrrhopterus'') and [[Wallace's standardwing]] (''Semioptera wallacii''). The islands are also home to the largest bee in the world, [[Wallace's giant bee]] (''Megachile pluto'').<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|name=Halmahera Rain Forests|id=aa0106}}</ref>\n\nThe islands have a [[tropical rainforest climate]].\n\nMost of the natural forest remains on these mountainous islands, although much of the coastal and lowland areas have been cleared for clove-planting since the sixteenth century, especially on the islands of Ternate and [[Tidore]]. Logging has occurred more recently on Halmahera and Morotai.\n\nThe North Maluku Islands are formed by the movement of three tectonic plates, namely [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasia]], the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]] and [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australia]] which have occurred since the time of lime. this movement formed the archipelago volcanic archipelago that stretched from north to south in western Halmahera, including Ternate Island, Tidore Island, Moti Island, Mare Island and Makian Island. Halmahera Island itself is a volcanic island even though volcanic activity occurs only in a part of its territory.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nNorth Maluku Province was subdivided into seven [[Regency (Indonesia)|regencies]] and two autonomous [[Cities of Indonesia|cities]]. An eighth regency, covering '''Taliabu Island''', was formed in 2013 from the westernmost island in the Sula Islands Residency.

[https://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/sophia-hanover-dies \"Sophia of Hanover Dies\"]. ''History Today'', Vol. 64 Issue 6, June 2014</ref> She was the daughter of [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]] and [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth Stuart of England]], and granddaughter of King [[James I of England]]. Sophia had been betrothed to Ernest Augustus's older brother, [[George William, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg|George William]], who did not want her. When she married Ernest Augustus instead, releasing George William from this obligation, George WIlliam ceded to Ernest Augustus his claim to [[Principality of L\u00fcneburg|L\u00fcneburg]].\n\nAs the fourth son, Ernest Augustus had little chance of succeeding his father as ruler. Therefore, the couple had to live in the [[Leineschloss]] at the Hanover court of Ernest Augustus' eldest brother [[Christian Louis, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Christian Louis]]. However, in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648, it had been agreed between the Catholic and Protestant powers that the rulership of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Osnabr\u00fcck]] should alternate between the two churches, and that the respective Protestant bishops should be members of the [[House of Welf]]. When the Osnabruck throne became vacant in 1662, the family appointed Ernest Augustus Prince-Bishop. Ernest Augustus and Sophia moved to [[Iburg Castle]], together with their two living sons and Sophia's niece [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Madame Palatine|Princess Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate]] (future sister-in-law of [[Louis XIV of France]]). In 1667 they began to build a more up-to-date residence, Osnabruck Palace, and in 1673 they moved there. Their youngest son was born there in 1674.\n\nChristian Louis died childless in 1665, leaving L\u00fcneburg to the second brother, George William, who had ceded his right to Ernest Augustus, and thus succeeded. George William kept the district of Celle for himself.\n\nIn 1679, Ernest Augustus inherited the [[Principality of Calenberg]] from the third brother [[John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-Calenberg|John Frederick]]. In 1680 the family moved back to Hanover. \n\nIn 1683, against the protestations of his five younger sons, Ernest Augustus instituted [[primogeniture]], so that his territory would not be further subdivided after his death, and also as a pre-condition for obtaining the coveted electorship. He participated in the [[Great Turkish War]] on the side of [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. In 1692, he was appointed [[Prince-elector]] by the Emperor, thus raising the [[House of Hanover]] to electoral dignity; however, the electorship did not come into effect until 1708.{{what}} He was nonetheless recognized as Elector of Hanover, the very first. Ernest Augustus died in 1698 at [[Herrenhausen]] Palace, Hanover. He was succeeded as ruler by his eldest son, [[George I of Great Britain|George Louis]], later King George I of Great Britain.\n\nHis main residences were the Leineschloss, in Hanover, and the Herrenhausen, a summer residence a short distance outside the city. Ernest Augustus and Sophia had the [[Herrenhausen Gardens|Great Garden at Herrenhausen]] enlarged after Italian and Dutch models, creating one of the most distinguished baroque formal gardens of Europe.\n\n<gallery>\nUnbekannt, Maison de Plaisir d'Herrenhausen, c1708..jpg|[[Herrenhausen Gardens|Herrenhausen Great Garden]], Hanover\nOsnabr\u00fcck Bisch\u00f6fliche Residenz (1777)@01.JPG|Osnabruck Palace\n</gallery>\n\n{{multiple image\n|align=center|width=150\n|image1=Coat of Arms of Ernest August, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (1661-1692).svg|caption1=Arms of Ernest as Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg 1661\u20131692\n|image2=Coat of Arms of Ernest August, Elector of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (1692-1698).svg|caption2=Arms of Ernest August as Elector-designate 1692\u20131698\n}}\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|1= 1.

20 November 1629 \u2013 23 January 1698) was ruler of the [[Principality of L\u00fcneburg]] from 1658 and of the [[Principality of Calenberg]] from 1679 until his death. He was appointed as the ninth [[Prince-elector|prince-elector]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1692, but died before the appointment became effective.\n\nHe was also ruler of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Osnabr\u00fcck]] from 1662 until his death.\n\n== Biography ==\n\nErnest Augustus was born on 20 November 1629 at [[Herzberg Castle]] near [[G\u00f6ttingen]], [[Principality of Calenberg]], the youngest son of [[George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] and Prince of Calenberg, and [[Anne Eleonore of Hesse-Darmstadt]].  \n\nOn 30 September 1658, he married [[Sophia of the Palatinate]] in [[Heidelberg]].<ref name=\"Cavendish\">Cavendish, Richard. [https://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/sophia-hanover-dies \"Sophia of Hanover Dies\"]. ''History Today'', Vol. 64 Issue 6, June 2014</ref> She was the daughter of [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]] and [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth Stuart of England]], and granddaughter of King [[James I of England]]. Sophia had been betrothed to Ernest Augustus's older brother, [[George William, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg|George William]], who did not want her. When she married Ernest Augustus instead, releasing George William from this obligation, George WIlliam ceded to Ernest Augustus his claim to [[Principality of L\u00fcneburg|L\u00fcneburg]].\n\nAs the fourth son, Ernest Augustus had little chance of succeeding his father as ruler. Therefore, the couple had to live in the [[Leineschloss]] at the Hanover court of Ernest Augustus' eldest brother [[Christian Louis, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Christian Louis]]. However, in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648, it had been agreed between the Catholic and Protestant powers that the rulership of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Osnabr\u00fcck]] should alternate between the two churches, and that the respective Protestant bishops should be members of the [[House of Welf]]. When the Osnabruck throne became vacant in 1662, the family appointed Ernest Augustus Prince-Bishop. Ernest Augustus and Sophia moved to [[Iburg Castle]], together with their two living sons and Sophia's niece [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Madame Palatine|Princess Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate]] (future sister-in-law of [[Louis XIV of France]]). In 1667 they began to build a more up-to-date residence, Osnabruck Palace, and in 1673 they moved there. Their youngest son was born there in 1674.\n\nChristian Louis died childless in 1665, leaving L\u00fcneburg to the second brother, George William, who had ceded his right to Ernest Augustus, and thus succeeded. George William kept the district of Celle for himself.\n\nIn 1679. Ernest Augustus inherited the [[Principality of Calenberg]] from the third brother [[John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-Calenberg|John Frederick]]. In 1680 the family moved back to Hanover. \n\nIn 1683, against the protestations of his five younger sons, Ernest Augustus instituted [[primogeniture]], so that his territory would not be further subdivided after his death, and also as a pre-condition for obtaining the coveted electorship. He participated in the [[Great Turkish War]] on the side of [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. In 1692, he was appointed [[Prince-elector]] by the Emperor, thus raising the [[House of Hanover]] to electoral dignity; however, the electorship did not come into effect until 1708. He was nonetheless recognized as Elector of Hanover, the very first. Ernest Augustus died in 1698 at [[Herrenhausen]] Palace, Hanover. He was succeeded as ruler by his eldest son, [[George I of Great Britain|George Louis]], later King George I of Great Britain.\n\nHis main residences were the Leineschloss, in Hanover, and the Herrenhausen, a summer residence a short distance outside the city. Ernest Augustus and Sophia had the [[Herrenhausen Gardens|Great Garden at Herrenhausen]] enlarged after Italian and Dutch models, creating one of the most distinguished baroque formal gardens of Europe.\n\n<gallery>\nUnbekannt, Maison de Plaisir d'Herrenhausen, c1708..jpg|[[Herrenhausen Gardens|Herrenhausen Great Garden]], Hanover\nOsnabr\u00fcck Bisch\u00f6fliche Residenz (1777)@01.JPG|Osnabruck Palace\n</gallery>\n\n{{multiple image\n|align=center|width=150\n|image1=Coat of Arms of Ernest August, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (1661-1692).svg|caption1=Arms of Ernest as Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg 1661\u20131692\n|image2=Coat of Arms of Ernest August, Elector of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (1692-1698).svg|caption2=Arms of Ernest August as Elector-designate 1692\u20131698\n}}\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|1= 1.

The company considered moving its headquarters out of New Brunswick in the 1960s, but decided to stay in the town after city officials promised to revitalize downtown New Brunswick by demolishing old buildings and constructing new ones. While New Brunswick lost many historic structures, including the early home of Rutgers University, and most of its historic commercial waterfront to the redevelopment effort, the gentrification did attract people back to New Brunswick. Johnson & Johnson hired [[Henry N. Cobb]] from [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]] to design its new headquarters.

Designed to address the issue of poor patient compliance with oral therapy, they are administered by intramuscular injection at intervals of 2 weeks and one month, respectively.

However, none of the three studies showed a relationship between how long someone used talc and how much their cancer risk increased, which is expected in experiments with carcinogens and other toxic substances (see [[dose-response relationship]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/the-johnson-and-johnson-talc-cancer-case/|title=The Johnson and Johnson Talc Cancer Case|author=Steven Novella|website=Neurologica blog|access-date=2019-09-30|author-link=Steven Novella}}</ref>\n\n=== Opioid epidemic ===\n{{Further|Opioid epidemic in the United States}}\nBy 2018, the company had become embroiled in the [[opioid epidemic in the United States]] and had become a target of [[lawsuit]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dddmag.com/news/2018/03/doj-support-lawsuits-against-companies-selling-opioids|title=DOJ to Support Lawsuits Against Companies Selling Opioids|last=Gurman|first=Sadie|date=March 2, 2018|work=Drug Discovery & Development|access-date=2 March 2018|publisher=Advantage Business Media|agency=Associated Press|last2=Mulvihill|first2=Geoff}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/12/health/oklahoma-opioid-trial-johnson-and-johnson-kingpin/index.html|title=Johnson & Johnson acted as opioid kingpin, Oklahoma attorney general says|date=March 12, 2019|access-date=14 March 2019|publisher=CNN}}</ref> Over 500 opioid-related cases have been filed as of May 2018 against Johnson & Johnson and its competitors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://seekingalpha.com/article/4200206-trump-insurance-johnson-and-johnson|title=Trump Insurance For Johnson & Johnson|access-date=25 August 2018}}</ref> In Idaho, Johnson & Johnson is part of a lawsuit accusing the company for being partially to blame for opioid-related overdose deaths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.idahostatesman.com/living/health-fitness/article216893150.html|title=11 Idaho counties take on Walmart, CVS, drug companies in opioid lawsuit|access-date=25 August 2018}}</ref> The first major trial began in Oklahoma in May 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/first-big-trial-in-opioid-crisis-set-to-kick-off-in-oklahoma-11558958401|title=First Big Trial in Opioid Crisis Set to Kick Off in Oklahoma|last=Randazzo|first=Sara|date=2019-05-27|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2019-05-28|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}</ref> On August 26, 2019, the Oklahoma judge ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $572 million for their part in the opioid crisis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/26/health/oklahoma-opioid-trial-verdict-bn/index.html|title=Oklahoma wins case against drugmaker in historic opioid trial|work=[[CNN]] | first1=Jacqueline | last1=Howard | first2=Wayne | last2=Drash | date=August 26, 2019 | access-date=August 26, 2019}}</ref> In October 2019, Johnson & Johnson reached a $20.4 million settlement with two Ohio counties grappling with the opioid epidemic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2019-10-02/johnson-and-johnson-agrees-to-pay-ohio-counties-204m-opioid-settlement|title=Johnson & Johnson to Pay Ohio Counties $20.4M Opioid Settlement|last=|first=|date=|website=www.usnews.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\n====Northeastern Ohio Settlement====\n\nIn October 2019, the company agreed to a settlement of US$20.4 million with two Ohio counties \u2013 Cuyahoga (Cleveland) and Summit (Akron).

The company considered moving its headquarters out of New Brunswick in the 1960s, but decided to stay in the town after city officials promised to revitalize downtown New Brunswick by demolishing old buildings and constructing new ones.

In 1887 he left Qandahar for a year's travel that took him to [[Lahore]] and [[Peshawar]] where he spent some time studying [[English language|English]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. He eventually landed in [[Jalalabad]] and was invited in 1888 to join the administration of the Afghan amir [[Abdur Rahman Khan]].<ref name=\"IranicaOnline\" /><ref name=\"Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab 1988. p. 13\">Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab, Translation: Shkirando as \"Kniga Upominanii o Myatezhe\" Moscow, 1988. p. 13</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHe was soon attached to the entourage of the amir's eldest son, Habib Ullah Khan, at the recommendation of one of his teachers, Mullah Sarwar Ishaq'zai.<ref name=\"Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab 1988. p. 13\" /> Faiz Mohammad accompanied the prince from Kabul to Jalalabad in 1311/1893-94.<ref>Faiz Mohammad Katib Hazara, \"Siraj al-Tawarikh\", Kabul, 1331-1333/1913-1915. III, p. 990</ref> There is a manuscript attributed to him, dated 29 Rajab 1311/5 February 1894, which places him in Jalalabad at this time. In 1314/1896, when Habib Ullah's younger brother [[Nasrullah Khan (Afghanistan)|Nasr Ullah Khan]] toured [[England]] on a state visit, Habib Ullah assigned Faiz Mohammad to copy and post in the Charsuq, Kabul's main market-place, the detailed letters sent back by Nasr Ullah recounting his activities, so that \u201cnoble and commoner alike would be apprised of the honor and respect that the English were according him\u201d.<ref>Faiz Mohammad Katib Hazara, \"Siraj al-Tawarikh\", Kabul, 1331-1333/1913-1915. III, p. 1107</ref>\n\nDuring Habib Ullah's reign, Faiz Mohammad was involved, if only peripherally, with the Young Afghan movement led by [[Mahmud Tarzi|Mahmud Baig Tarzi]]. He is said to have been associated with the publication of Tarzi's reformist journal, ''Siraj al-Akbar'', and three other journals, ''Anis'', ''\u1e24ayy alal-falah'', and ''Aina-ye Irfan''. After the assassination of his patron in 1337/1919, Faiz Mohammad worked for a time at the [[Ministry of Education (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Education]] on textbook revision. Sometime later, he was appointed to a teaching position at the [[Habibia High School|Habibiya Laycee]] ''(Habibiya High School)'' in Kabul.<ref name=\"Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab 1988. p. 13\" />\n\nDuring the reign of [[Aman Ullah Khan]] (1919\u201329), the Iranian minister in Kabul Sayyed Mahdi Farrokh compiled a \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of contemporary Afghan leaders. His sketch of Faiz Mohammad characterizes him as a devout [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslim]], highly regarded by the [[Qizilbash]] community of Kabul, as well as a leader among his own people, the Hazaras, and an important source of information for the Persian mission about what was going on in the capital.<ref>M. Farrokh, \"Tarikh-e Siasi-ye Afghanistan\", Tehran, 1314 \u0160./1935; Reprinted, Qom, 1371 \u0160./1992, pp. 252-54</ref>\n\nIn 1929, the [[Tajik people|Tajik]] outlaw [[Habibull\u0101h Kalak\u0101ni|Habib Ullah Kalakani]], also in a derogatory manner called Bacha ye Saqqao (son of the water-carrier), ousted Aman Ullah Khan and took control of Kabul for nine months (January to October 1929). During this uprising Faiz Mohammad, who spent almost the entire period inside the city, kept a journal which was the basis for an unfinished monograph entitled ''Kitab-e Tadakoor-e Enqilab'' which he began shortly after the fall of Bacha ye Saqqao.\n\nDuring the occupation, Faiz Mohammad was forced to take part in a delegation sent by Kalakani to negotiate with Hazara groups opposing the Tajik leader. According to his account, he managed to subvert Kalakani's plans and caused the mission to fail. However, he and the mission's leader, Noor al-Din Agha, a Qizilbash Shi\u02bfite from Kabul, paid a heavy price for this: both were sentenced to death by beating. Faiz Mohammad alone survived the ordeal and was saved by a colleague. The Persian mission in Kabul, under a directive from [[Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h|Reza Shah]] to do what it could to aid the Shi\u02bfites of Kabul, sent medicines to his house. He eventually recovered enough to travel the following year to Tehran for more medical care. After less than a year there, he returned to Kabul, where he died on 6 Shawal 1349/3 March 1931, at the age of sixty-eight or sixty-nine.<ref>Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab, Translation: Shkirando as \"Kniga Upominanii o Myatezhe\" Moscow, 1988. p. 24.</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\nFaiz Mohammad  is best known for his books on Afghan history. During Habib Ullah's reign, he accepted two commissions to write a comprehensive history of Afghanistan covering events from the time of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah]] down through the reign of Habib Ullah Khan. The first was a history of Afghanistan entitled ''Tohfat ul-Habib'' (\u1e24abib's gift) in honor of the amir, but Habib Ullah Khan deemed the finished work unacceptable and ordered Faiz Mohammad to start over. The revised version is the three-volume history of Afghanistan entitled Siraj al-Tawarikh (Lamp of Histories), an allusion to the amir's honorific \u201cLamp of the Nation and Religion\u201d (Siraj al-mella wa\u02bel-din). There were also problems in publishing it, the third volume never being completely printed. It is thought that the process of publishing the third volume lasted several years and only ended after Habib Ullah Khan's death.<ref>V. A. Romodin, \u201cSources of the Siraj al-Tawarikh,\u201d in Pis\u2019mennye pamyatniki i problemy istorii kul\u2019tury narodov Vostoka, May 1969, p. 114 (Abstracts of papers presented at the Fifth Annual Session of the Literary Division of the Institute of Orientalistics, Academy of Sciences)</ref> Some say the publication on the third volume was halted at page 1,240 for unspecified reasons.<ref>M.

The manuscript of the remainder of the third volume is widely believed to have been finished, and the autograph was reportedly turned over to the Afghan archives by Faiz Mohammad's son. Volumes devoted to Habib Ullah Khan and Aman Ullah Khan may also have been written. A ''farman'' issued by the latter announced that Faiz Mohammad had been ordered to complete the ''Siraj'' and then begin work on a chronicle of the reign of Aman Ullah Khan to be entitled ''Tarikh-e Asr-e Amaniya''.

In 1887 he left Qandahar for a year's travel that took him to [[Lahore]] and [[Peshawar]] where he spent some time studying [[English language|English]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]].

In 1314/1896, when Habib Ullah's younger brother [[Nasrullah Khan (Afghanistan)|Nasr Ullah Khan]] toured [[England]] on a state visit, Habib Ullah assigned Faiz Mohammad to copy and post in the Charsuq, Kabul's main market-place, the detailed letters sent back by Nasr Ullah recounting his activities, so that \u201cnoble and commoner alike would be apprised of the honor and respect that the English were according him\u201d.<ref>Faiz Mohammad Katib Hazara, \"Siraj al-Tawarikh\", Kabul, 1331-1333/1913-1915. III, p. 1107</ref>\n\nDuring Habib Ullah's reign, Faiz Mohammad was involved, if only peripherally, with the Young Afghan movement led by [[Mahmud Tarzi|Mahmud Baig Tarzi]]. He is said to have been associated with the publication of Tarzi's reformist journal, ''Siraj al-Akbar'', and three other journals, ''Anis'', ''\u1e24ayy alal-falah'', and ''Aina-ye Irfan''. After the assassination of his patron in 1337/1919, Faiz Mohammad worked for a time at the [[Ministry of Education (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Education]] on textbook revision. Sometime later, he was appointed to a teaching position at the [[Habibia High School|Habibiya Laycee]] ''(Habibiya High School)'' in Kabul.<ref name=\"Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab 1988. p. 13\" />\n\nDuring the reign of [[Aman Ullah Khan]] (1919\u201329), the Iranian minister in Kabul Sayyed Mahdi Farrokh compiled a \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of contemporary Afghan leaders. His sketch of Faiz Mohammad characterizes him as a devout [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslim]], highly regarded by the [[Qizilbash]] community of Kabul, as well as a leader among his own people, the Hazaras, and an important source of information for the Persian mission about what was going on in the capital.<ref>M. Farrokh, \"Tarikh-e Siasi-ye Afghanistan\", Tehran, 1314 \u0160./1935; Reprinted, Qom, 1371 \u0160./1992, pp. 252-54</ref>\n\nIn 1929, the [[Tajik people|Tajik]] outlaw [[Habibull\u0101h Kalak\u0101ni|Habib Ullah Kalakani]], known to history as Bacha ye Saqqao (son of the water-carrier), ousted Aman Ullah Khan and took control of Kabul for nine months (January to October 1929). During this uprising Faiz Mohammad, who spent almost the entire period inside the city, kept a journal which was the basis for an unfinished monograph entitled ''Kitab-e Tadakoor-e Enqilab'' which he began shortly after the fall of Bacha ye Saqqao.\n\nDuring the occupation, Faiz Mohammad was forced to take part in a delegation sent by Kalakani to negotiate with Hazara groups opposing the Tajik leader. According to his account, he managed to subvert Kalakani's plans and caused the mission to fail. However, he and the mission's leader, Noor al-Din Agha, a Qizilbash Shi\u02bfite from Kabul, paid a heavy price for this: both were sentenced to death by beating. Faiz Mohammad alone survived the ordeal and was saved by a colleague. The Persian mission in Kabul, under a directive from [[Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h|Reza Shah]] to do what it could to aid the Shi\u02bfites of Kabul, sent medicines to his house. He eventually recovered enough to travel the following year to Tehran for more medical care. After less than a year there, he returned to Kabul, where he died on 6 Shawal 1349/3 March 1931, at the age of sixty-eight or sixty-nine.<ref>Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab, Translation: Shkirando as \"Kniga Upominanii o Myatezhe\" Moscow, 1988. p. 24</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\nFaiz Mohammad  is best known for his books on Afghan history. During Habib Ullah's reign, he accepted two commissions to write a comprehensive history of Afghanistan covering events from the time of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah]] down through the reign of Habib Ullah Khan. The first was a history of Afghanistan entitled ''Tohfat ul-Habib'' (\u1e24abib's gift) in honor of the amir, but Habib Ullah Khan deemed the finished work unacceptable and ordered Faiz Mohammad to start over. The revised version is the three-volume history of Afghanistan entitled Siraj al-Tawarikh (Lamp of Histories), an allusion to the amir's honorific \u201cLamp of the Nation and Religion\u201d (Siraj al-mella wa\u02bel-din). There were also problems in publishing it, the third volume never being completely printed. It is thought that the process of publishing the third volume lasted several years and only ended after Habib Ullah Khan's death.<ref>V. A.

The earliest surviving Western Asian epic poetry, the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', was written in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]].\n\nEarly poems in the [[Eurasia]]n continent evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese [[Classic of Poetry|''Shijing'']]; or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit]] ''[[Vedas]]'', the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] ''[[Gathas]]'', and the [[Homer]]ic epics, the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Ancient Greek attempts to define poetry, such as [[Aristotle]]'s [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']], focused on the uses of [[Speech communication|speech]] in [[rhetoric]], [[drama]], [[song]], and [[comedy]]. Later attempts concentrated on features such as [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], [[line (poetry)|verse form]], and [[rhyme]], and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative [[prosaic]] writing.\n\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretations of words, or to evoke [[emotion|emotive]] responses.

The use of [[ambiguity]], [[symbol]]ism, [[irony]], and other [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistic]] elements of [[poetic diction]] often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, figures of speech such as [[metaphor]], [[simile]], and [[metonymy]]<ref>{{Cite book |last=Strachan, John R |title=Poetry: an introduction |last2=Terry, Richard, G |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-8147-9797-6 |page=119}}</ref> establish a resonance between otherwise disparate images\u2014a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived.

[[Japanese Language|Japanese]] is a [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]-timed language. [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[French language|French]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are called syllable-timed languages.

Languages can rely on either pitch or tone. Some languages with a pitch accent are Vedic Sanskrit or Ancient Greek. [[Tonal language]]s include Chinese, Vietnamese and most [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Subsaharan languages]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Yip, Moira |title=Tone |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-521-77314-0 |series=Cambridge textbooks in linguistics |pages=1\u20134, 130}}</ref>\n\nMetrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements of stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called [[foot (prosody)|feet]] within a line. In Modern English verse the pattern of stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or [[elision|elided]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|p=12}}</ref> In the [[classical languages]], on the other hand, while the [[Meter (music)|metrical]] units are similar, [[vowel length]] rather than stresses define the meter.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jorgens |first=Elise Bickford |title=The well-tun'd word : musical interpretations of English poetry, 1597\u20131651 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-8166-1029-7 |page=23}}</ref> [[Old English]] poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=75\u201376}}</ref>\n[[File:Marianne Moore 1935.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Marianne Moore]]]]\nThe chief device of ancient [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Biblical poetry]], including many of the [[psalms]], was ''[[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]'', a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to [[antiphon]]al or [[call and response (music)|call-and-response]] performance, which could also be reinforced by [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Walker-Jones |first=Arthur |title=Hebrew for biblical interpretation |publisher=Society of Biblical Literature |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-58983-086-8 |pages=211\u201313}}</ref> Some classical poetry forms, such as [[Venpa]] of the [[Tamil language]], had rigid grammars (to the point that they could be expressed as a [[context-free grammar]]) which ensured a rhythm.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bala Sundara Raman |first=L |last2=Ishwar, S |last3=Kumar Ravindranath, Sanjeeth |year=2003 |title=Context Free Grammar for Natural Language Constructs: An implementation for Venpa Class of Tamil Poetry |journal=Tamil Internet |pages=128\u201336 |citeseerx=10.1.1.3.7738}}</ref>\n\n[[Shi (poetry)|Classical Chinese poetics]], based on the [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|tone system of Middle Chinese]], recognized two kinds of tones: the level (\u5e73 ''p\u00edng'') tone and the oblique (\u4ec4 ''z\u00e8'') tones, a category consisting of the rising (\u4e0a ''sh\u00e1ng'') tone, the departing (\u53bb ''q\u00f9'') tone and the entering (\u5165 ''r\u00f9'') tone.

For example, [[Robert Pinsky]] has argued that while dactyls are important in classical verse, English dactylic verse uses dactyls very irregularly and can be better described based on patterns of iambs and anapests, feet which he considers natural to the language.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pinsky|1998|p=66}}</ref> Actual rhythm is significantly more complex than the basic scanned meter described above, and many scholars have sought to develop systems that would scan such complexity. [[Vladimir Nabokov]] noted that overlaid on top of the regular pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of verse was a separate pattern of accents resulting from the natural pitch of the spoken words, and suggested that the term \"scud\" be used to distinguish an unaccented stress from an accented stress.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nabokov, Vladimir |url=https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/9 |title=Notes on Prosody |publisher=[[Bollingen Foundation]] |year=1964 |isbn=978-0-691-01760-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/9 9\u201313]}}</ref>\n\n==== Metrical patterns ====\n[[File:Lewis Carroll - Henry Holiday - Hunting of the Snark - Plate 6.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'' (1876) is mainly in [[anapestic tetrameter]].]]\n{{Main|Meter (poetry)}}\n\nDifferent traditions and genres of poetry tend to use different meters, ranging from the Shakespearean [[iambic pentameter]] and the Homeric [[dactylic hexameter]] to the [[anapestic tetrameter]] used in many nursery rhymes. However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition. For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a [[caesura]] (or pause) may be added (sometimes in place of a foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given a [[Meter (poetry)|feminine ending]] to soften it or be replaced by a [[spondee]] to emphasize it and create a hard stop. Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to be fairly regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=36\u201371}}</ref> Regularity can vary between language.

They may be used as an independent structural element in a poem, to reinforce rhythmic patterns, or as an ornamental element.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=65}}</ref> They can also carry a meaning separate from the repetitive sound patterns created. For example, [[Chaucer]] used heavy alliteration to mock Old English verse and to paint a character as archaic.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Osberg, Richard H |title=Essays on the art of Chaucer's Verse |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8153-2951-0 |editor-last=Gaylord, Alan T |pages=195\u2013228 |chapter='I kan nat geeste': Chaucer's Artful Alliteration}}</ref>\n\nRhyme consists of identical (\"hard-rhyme\") or similar (\"soft-rhyme\") sounds placed at the ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines (\"[[internal rhyme]]\"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Alighieri, Dante; Pinsky Robert (trans.) |url=https://archive.org/details/infernoofdante00dant |title=The Inferno of Dante: A New Verse Translation |publisher=Farrar, Straus & Giroux |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-374-17674-7 |chapter=Introduction}}</ref> The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.<ref name=\"kiparsky\">{{Cite journal |last=Kiparsky, Paul |date=Summer 1973 |title=The Role of Linguistics in a Theory of Poetry |journal=Daedalus |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=231\u201344}}</ref>\n\nAlliteration is the repetition of letters or letter-sounds at the beginning of two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words. Alliteration and assonance played a key role in structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure, so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur. This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures.\n\nAssonance, where the use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the beginning or end of a word, was widely used in [[skald]]ic poetry but goes back to the Homeric epic.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Russom, Geoffrey |url=https://archive.org/details/beowulfoldgerman0000russ |title=Beowulf and old Germanic metre |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-521-59340-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/beowulfoldgerman0000russ/page/64 64\u201386] |url-access=registration}}</ref> Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Liu |first=James JY |title=Art of Chinese Poetry |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-226-48687-1 |pages=21\u201322}}</ref> Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word. Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.<ref name=kiparsky/>\n\n==== Rhyming schemes ====\n[[File:Paradiso Canto 31.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|''[[Divine Comedy]]'': [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] see God as a point of light.]]\n{{Main|Rhyme scheme}}\n\nIn many languages, including modern European languages and Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as [[ballad]]s, [[sonnet]]s and [[couplet|rhyming couplets]]. However, the use of structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional [[rhyme scheme]]s.

Some forms of poetry carry a consistent and well-defined rhyming scheme, such as the [[chant royal]] or the [[Ruba'i|rubaiyat]], while other poetic forms have variable rhyme schemes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=71\u2013104}}</ref>\n\nMost rhyme schemes are described using letters that correspond to sets of rhymes, so if the first, second and fourth lines of a quatrain rhyme with each other and the third line do not rhyme, the quatrain is said to have an \"aa-ba\" rhyme scheme. This rhyme scheme is the one used, for example, in the rubaiyat form.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|p=27}}</ref> Similarly, an \"a-bb-a\" quatrain (what is known as \"[[enclosed rhyme]]\") is used in such forms as the [[Petrarchan sonnet]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=88\u201391}}</ref> Some types of more complicated rhyming schemes have developed names of their own, separate from the \"a-bc\" convention, such as the [[ottava rima]] and [[terza rima]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=81\u201382, 85}}</ref> The types and use of differing rhyming schemes are discussed further in the [[rhyme scheme|main article]].\n\n=== Form in poetry ===\nPoetic form is more flexible in modernist and post-modernist poetry and continues to be less structured than in previous literary eras. Many modern poets eschew recognizable structures or forms and write in [[free verse]]. But poetry remains distinguished from prose by its form; some regard for basic formal structures of poetry will be found in even the best free verse, however much such structures may appear to have been ignored.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Whitworth |first=Michael H |title=Reading modernist poetry |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-6731-4 |page=74}}</ref> Similarly, in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form for emphasis or effect.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hollander|1981|pp=50\u201351}}</ref>\n\nAmong major structural elements used in poetry are the line, the [[stanza]] or [[verse paragraph]], and larger combinations of stanzas or lines such as [[canto]]s. Also sometimes used are broader visual presentations of words and [[calligraphy]]. These basic units of poetic form are often combined into larger structures, called ''poetic forms'' or poetic modes (see the following section), as in the [[sonnet]] or [[haiku]].\n\n==== Lines and stanzas ====\n{{main|Line (poetry)|Stanza}}\n\nPoetry is often separated into lines on a page, in a process known as [[line break (poetry)|lineation]]. These lines may be based on the number of metrical feet or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=7\u201313}}</ref> See the article on [[line break (poetry)|line breaks]] for information about the division between lines.\n\nLines of poems are often organized into [[stanza]]s, which are denominated by the number of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a [[couplet]] (or [[distich]]), three lines a [[tercet|triplet]] (or [[tercet]]), four lines a [[quatrain]], and so on. These lines may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78\u201382}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alexander Blok - Noch, ulica, fonar, apteka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Alexander Blok|Blok]]'s [[Russian language|Russian]] poem, \"''Noch, ulitsa, fonar, apteka''\" (\"Night, street, lamp, drugstore\"), on a wall in [[Leiden]]]]\n\nOther poems may be organized into [[verse paragraph]]s, in which regular rhymes with established rhythms are not used, but the poetic tone is instead established by a collection of rhythms, alliterations, and rhymes established in paragraph form.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=78}}</ref> Many medieval poems were written in verse paragraphs, even where regular rhymes and rhythms were used.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Middle English Literature: a guide to criticism |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-631-23290-2 |editor-last=Dalrymple, Roger |page=10}}</ref>\n\nIn many forms of poetry, stanzas are interlocking, so that the rhyming scheme or other structural elements of one stanza determine those of succeeding stanzas. Examples of such interlocking stanzas include, for example, the [[ghazal]] and the [[villanelle]], where a refrain (or, in the case of the villanelle, refrains) is established in the first stanza which then repeats in subsequent stanzas. Related to the use of interlocking stanzas is their use to separate thematic parts of a poem. For example, the [[strophe]], [[antistrophe]] and [[epode]] of the ode form are often separated into one or more stanzas.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78\u201379}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases, particularly lengthier formal poetry such as some forms of epic poetry, stanzas themselves are constructed according to strict rules and then combined. In [[skald]]ic poetry, the [[dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt]] stanza had eight lines, each having three \"lifts\" produced with alliteration or assonance. In addition to two or three alliterations, the odd-numbered lines had partial rhyme of consonants with dissimilar vowels, not necessarily at the beginning of the word; the even lines contained internal rhyme in set syllables (not necessarily at the end of the word). Each half-line had exactly six syllables, and each line ended in a trochee. The arrangement of dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tts followed far less rigid rules than the construction of the individual dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tts.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Companion to Old Norse-Icelandic Literature and Culture |publisher=Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-4051-3738-6 |editor-last=McTurk, Rory |editor-link=Rory McTurk |pages=269\u201380}}</ref>\n\n==== Visual presentation ====\n{{Main|Visual poetry}}\n\nEven before the advent of printing, the visual appearance of poetry often added meaning or depth.

Visual elements have become an important part of the poet's toolbox, and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes. Some [[Modernism|Modernist]] poets have made the placement of individual lines or groups of lines on the page an integral part of the poem's composition. At times, this complements the poem's [[rhythm]] through visual [[caesura]]s of various lengths, or creates [[Contrast (linguistics)|juxtapositions]] so as to accentuate meaning, [[ambiguity]] or [[irony]], or simply to create an aesthetically pleasing form.

By the 14th century and the [[Italian Renaissance]], the form had further crystallized under the pen of [[Petrarch]], whose sonnets were translated in the 16th century by [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Sir Thomas Wyatt]], who is credited with introducing the sonnet form into English literature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=94}}</ref> A traditional Italian or [[Petrarchan sonnet]] follows the rhyme scheme ''ABBA, ABBA, CDECDE'', though some variation, perhaps the most common being CDCDCD, especially within the final six lines (or ''sestet''), is common.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Minta, Stephen |url=https://archive.org/details/petrarchpetrarch0000mint/page/15 |title=Petrarch and Petrarchism |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-7190-0748-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/petrarchpetrarch0000mint/page/15 15\u201317]}}</ref> The [[English sonnet|English (or Shakespearean) sonnet]] follows the rhyme scheme ''ABAB, CDCD, EFEF, GG'', introducing a third [[quatrain]] (grouping of four lines), a final [[couplet]], and a greater amount of variety with regard to rhyme than is usually found in its Italian predecessors. By convention, sonnets in English typically use [[iambic pentameter]], while in the [[Romance languages]], the [[hendecasyllable]] and [[Alexandrine]] are the most widely used meters.\n\nSonnets of all types often make use of a ''volta'', or \"turn,\" a point in the poem at which an idea is turned on its head, a question is answered (or introduced), or the subject matter is further complicated. This ''volta'' can often take the form of a \"but\" statement contradicting or complicating the content of the earlier lines. In the Petrarchan sonnet, the turn tends to fall around the division between the first two quatrains and the sestet, while English sonnets usually place it at or near the beginning of the closing couplet.\n[[File:Carol Ann Duffy (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Carol Ann Duffy]]]]\nSonnets are particularly associated with high poetic diction, vivid imagery, and romantic love, largely due to the influence of Petrarch as well as of early English practitioners such as [[Edmund Spenser]] (who gave his name to the [[Spenserian sonnet]]), [[Michael Drayton]], and Shakespeare, whose [[Shakespeare's sonnets|sonnets]] are among the most famous in English poetry, with twenty being included in the ''[[Oxford Book of English Verse]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Oxford Book of English Verse |title-link=Oxford Book of English Verse |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1900 |editor-last=Quiller-Couch, Arthur}}</ref> However, the twists and turns associated with the ''volta'' allow for a logical flexibility applicable to many subjects.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=119\u201333}}</ref> Poets from the earliest centuries of the sonnet to the present have utilized the form to address topics related to politics ([[John Milton]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Claude McKay]]), theology ([[John Donne]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]), war ([[Wilfred Owen]], [[e.e. cummings]]), and gender and sexuality ([[Carol Ann Duffy]]). Further, postmodern authors such as [[Ted Berrigan]] and [[John Berryman]] have challenged the traditional definitions of the sonnet form, rendering entire sequences of \"sonnets\" that often lack rhyme, a clear logical progression, or even a consistent count of fourteen lines.\n\n=== Shi ===\n[[File:Dufucalligraphy.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Du Fu]], \"On Visiting the Temple of [[Laozi]]\"]]\n{{Main|Shi (poetry)}}\n\n''Shi'' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:\u8a69|\u8a69]]|s=[[wikt:\u8bd7|\u8bd7]]|p=sh\u012b|w=shih}}) Is the main type of [[Classical Chinese poetry]].<ref>[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971).

In all cases, rhyming is obligatory. The Yuefu is a folk ballad or a poem written in the folk ballad style, and the number of lines and the length of the lines could be irregular. For the other variations of ''shi'' poetry, generally either a four line (quatrain, or ''[[jueju]]'') or else an eight-line poem is normal; either way with the even numbered lines rhyming. The line length is scanned by an according number of characters (according to the convention that one character equals one syllable), and are predominantly either five or seven characters long, with a [[caesura]] before the final three syllables. The lines are generally end-stopped, considered as a series of couplets, and exhibit verbal parallelism as a key poetic device.<ref>[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971).

(New York: Columbia University Press). {{ISBN|0-231-03464-4}}, 1\u20132 and 15\u201318</ref> The \"old style\" verse (''Gushi'') is less formally strict than the ''jintishi'', or regulated verse, which, despite the name \"new style\" verse actually had its theoretical basis laid as far back as [[Shen Yue]] (441\u2013513 CE), although not considered to have reached its full development until the time of [[Chen Zi'ang]] (661\u2013702 CE).<ref>[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971).

Among its other rules, the jintishi rules regulate the tonal variations within a poem, including the use of set patterns of the [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]] of [[Middle Chinese]]. The basic form of jintishi (sushi) has eight lines in four couplets, with parallelism between the lines in the second and third couplets. The couplets with parallel lines contain contrasting content but an identical grammatical relationship between words. Jintishi often have a rich poetic diction, full of [[allusion]], and can have a wide range of subject, including history and politics.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Faurot |first=Jeannette L |url=https://archive.org/details/drinkingwithmoon0000unse/page/30 |title=Drinking with the moon |publisher=China Books & Periodicals |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-8351-2639-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/drinkingwithmoon0000unse/page/30 30]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wang |first=Yugen |date=1 June 2004 |title=Shige: The Popular Poetics of Regulated Verse |journal=T'ang Studies |volume=2004 |issue=22 |pages=81\u2013125 |doi=10.1179/073750304788913221}}</ref> One of the masters of the form was [[Du Fu]] (712\u2013770 CE), who wrote during the Tang Dynasty (8th century).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Schirokauer |first=Conrad |title=A brief history of Chinese and Japanese civilizations |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-15-505569-8 |edition=2nd |page=119}}</ref>\n\n=== Villanelle ===\n[[File:AudenLibraryOfCongress.jpg|thumb|upright|[[W.

This is reflected in its requirements on the tone markings of certain syllables, which must be marked with ''mai ek'' ({{lang|th|\u0e44\u0e21\u0e49\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e01}}, {{IPA-th|m\u00e1j \u00e8\u02d0k}}, {{lang|th|\u25cc\u0e48}}) or ''mai tho'' ({{lang|th|\u0e44\u0e21\u0e49\u0e42\u0e17}}, {{IPA-th|m\u00e1j t\u02b0\u014d\u02d0|}}, {{lang|th|\u25cc\u0e49}}). This was likely derived from when the Thai language had three tones (as opposed to today's five, a split which occurred during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] period), two of which corresponded directly to the aforementioned marks.

Odes have a formal poetic diction and generally deal with a serious subject. The strophe and antistrophe look at the subject from different, often conflicting, perspectives, with the epode moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues.

In his Junior year at New York City's Christ the King High School at the age of 17, Zwerenz experienced what he would later regard as his \" poetic baptism\" while reading a simple and pastoral poem by France's rebellious Arthur Rimbaud entitled simply \" Sensation\" .\nCareer: After this time he completely gave his whole self to the poetic life, sleeping in graveyards and barren fields as he discovered at the same time the balm of alcohol which he mixed with agnostic theology and poems of travel. Immediately after his graduation from High School, Zwerenz flew from his home town of New York City to Bloomington, Indiana where he stayed for some time, depending upon strangers for food and lodging. In 1988 Zwerenz attended New York University's Queens College where he graduated with honors in June of 1992 despite his increasing intake of beer and wine. Zwerenz already by the time he attended Graduate School at Queens College had gained a fixed reputation as a young, bohemian sort of man often donning very long hair, a leather suit and cowboy boots. A newly acquired car allowed his traveling lifestyle the means to pursue his wanderlust. He made it a habit to leave his parents' house in Queens, New York, for weeks and months at a time, driving or flying to distant places in The United States such as Boston, Pennsylvania, Florida and Los Angeles. After a brief and unsuccessful attempt at conservative employment, by the age of 23 Zwerenz quit Graduate School in favor of a more adventurous life, spending his time often in the company of attractive, young women who would assist his constant shaky economic status. After five years of playing in a semi successful local rock band, mostly as a means to release his manic energy and to obtain extra money, Zwerenz finally devoted all of his free time to composing advanced verse in an extremely serious manner. Greatly and profoundly influenced by the Victorian Romantics of England and the United States, and even more so by the French Decadents of the mid 19th century, such bards as Paul Verlaine, Charles Baudelaire, Edgar Allan Poe, Lord George Byron and John Keats left a permanent mark on his own budding and serious verse. By the time he entered his thirties, Zwerenz had found his own poetic voice: stanzas flowing with an almost always rhyming, strictly attentive metered expressionism coupled with mystical theology, which, as he grew in age became more and more Catholic Christian in sentiment and in subject matter.\nPersonal Life: No longer would he be confused and corrupted by what he now called the dangerous works of such atheistic philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Victor Hugo and Arthur Schopenhauer.  It was about at this time that he discovered the Summa Theologica by Saint Thomas Aquinas which he read in a solemn and sacred vein. Even more of a permanent and lasting influence were the writings of the French Saint Louis Marie De Montfort who sang the praises of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus in ways which dazzled Zwerenz' mind to the extent that he would never be the same again. All of these interior changes found their way into his verse, and it wasn't long before Zwerenz became determined to speak to the world about his newly found felicity in the bosom of the Holy Roman Catholic Church. And although it was about this time that he ceased to drink, his always overtaxed psyche began to give way, coupled with the harsh and misunderstanding treatment which his parents would persecute him with as they had no idea how to raise nor relate to a truly maverick and extreme type of artist which bewildered them in the character of the very different personage of their poet son. This family tension would often resolve itself in very detrimental and tragic ends which would more than not leave the bold and nascent poet in extremely abusive situations. His father, a strict disciplinarian, would often have the young bard arrested for no tangible offenses, leading to many unprotected admissions in madhouses. In fact, from the time Zwerenz was 15 until his early forties, he was hospitalized thirty three times, almost always against his will and on many more than several occasions he nearly lost his life from the countless, merciless and brutal beatings Zwerenz received by mostly policemen in these barbaric institutions. Zwerenz' father was a close acquaintance with the local police authorities, and he made sure that these ties did not go unused. As Zwerenz grew into middle age, he rarely lived at home for obvious reasons relating to protecting his own physical safety, if not his very life. His many relationships with women were fraught with fights and disagreements, and Zwerenz began to live a more cloistered life living alone in many different places, far from home, where he could focus on his poetry, undisturbed.\nNo longer would he be confused and corrupted by what he now called the dangerous works of such atheistic philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Victor Hugo and Arthur Schopenhauer.

It was not until 2020 however that Green Frog Publishing, a large publishing house based in Vermont, released his life's poetic work, consisting of 11 volumes of verse, entitled \" The Complete Anthology\" which has met with substantial success. Zwerenz lives alone in New York now and is 51 years of age.\n\n=== Epic poetry ===\n[[File:Cam\u00f5es, por Fern\u00e3o Gomes.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es|Cam\u00f5es]]]]\n{{Main|Epic poetry}}\n\nEpic poetry is a genre of poetry, and a major form of [[narrative]] literature.

While the composition of epic poetry, and of [[long poem]]s generally, became less common in the west after the early 20th century, some notable epics have continued to be written.

Common forms include the [[limerick (poetry)|limerick]], the [[clerihew]], and the [[double dactyl]].\n\nWhile light poetry is sometimes condemned as [[doggerel]], or thought of as poetry composed casually, humor often makes a serious point in a subtle or subversive way.

However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition. For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a [[caesura]] (or pause) may be added (sometimes in place of a foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given a [[Meter (poetry)|feminine ending]] to soften it or be replaced by a [[spondee]] to emphasize it and create a hard stop. Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to be fairly regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=36\u201371}}</ref> Regularity can vary between language. In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, [[iambic tetrameter]] in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur, or occurs to a much lesser extent, in English.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nabokov, Vladimir |url=https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/46 |title=Notes on Prosody |publisher=Bollingen Foundation |year=1964 |isbn=978-0-691-01760-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/46 46\u201347]}}</ref>\n[[File:Kiprensky Pushkin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alexander Pushkin]]]]\nSome common metrical patterns, with notable examples of poets and poems who use them, include:\n* [[Iambic pentameter]] ([[John Milton]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]''; [[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Shakespeare's Sonnets|Sonnets]]'')<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|p=206}}</ref>\n* [[Dactylic hexameter]] (Homer, ''[[Iliad]]''; [[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'')<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|p=63}}</ref>\n* [[Iambic tetrameter]] ([[Andrew Marvell]], \"[[To His Coy Mistress]]\"; [[Alexander Pushkin]], ''[[Eugene Onegin]]''; [[Robert Frost]], ''[[Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening]]'')<ref name=\"tetra\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.tetrameter.com |title=What is Tetrameter? |publisher=tetrameter.com |access-date=10 December 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Trochaic octameter]] ([[Edgar Allan Poe]], \"[[The Raven]]\")<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|p=60}}</ref>\n* [[Trochaic tetrameter]] ([[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]''; the Finnish national epic, ''[[Kalevala|The Kalevala]]'', is also in trochaic tetrameter, the natural rhythm of Finnish and Estonian)\n* {{lang|fr|[[Alexandrin]]}} ([[Jean Racine]], ''[[Ph\u00e8dre]]'')<ref>{{Cite book |last=James |first=ED |url=https://archive.org/details/racinephdre00jame |title=Racine: Ph\u00e8dre |last2=Jondorf, G |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-521-39721-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/racinephdre00jame/page/32 32\u201334] |url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n=== Rhyme, alliteration, assonance ===\n[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Old English]] [[epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' is in [[alliterative]] [[Verse (poetry)|verse]].]]\n{{Main|Rhyme|Alliterative verse|Assonance}}\n\nRhyme, alliteration, assonance and [[Literary consonance|consonance]] are ways of creating repetitive patterns of sound. They may be used as an independent structural element in a poem, to reinforce rhythmic patterns, or as an ornamental element.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=65}}</ref> They can also carry a meaning separate from the repetitive sound patterns created. For example, [[Chaucer]] used heavy alliteration to mock Old English verse and to paint a character as archaic.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Osberg, Richard H |title=Essays on the art of Chaucer's Verse |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8153-2951-0 |editor-last=Gaylord, Alan T |pages=195\u2013228 |chapter='I kan nat geeste': Chaucer's Artful Alliteration}}</ref>\n\nRhyme consists of identical (\"hard-rhyme\") or similar (\"soft-rhyme\") sounds placed at the ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines (\"[[internal rhyme]]\"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Alighieri, Dante; Pinsky Robert (trans.) |url=https://archive.org/details/infernoofdante00dant |title=The Inferno of Dante: A New Verse Translation |publisher=Farrar, Straus & Giroux |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-374-17674-7 |chapter=Introduction}}</ref> The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.<ref name=\"kiparsky\">{{Cite journal |last=Kiparsky, Paul |date=Summer 1973 |title=The Role of Linguistics in a Theory of Poetry |journal=Daedalus |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=231\u201344}}</ref>\n\nAlliteration is the repetition of letters or letter-sounds at the beginning of two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words. Alliteration and assonance played a key role in structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure, so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur. This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures.\n\nAssonance, where the use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the beginning or end of a word, was widely used in [[skald]]ic poetry but goes back to the Homeric epic.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Russom, Geoffrey |url=https://archive.org/details/beowulfoldgerman0000russ |title=Beowulf and old Germanic metre |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-521-59340-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/beowulfoldgerman0000russ/page/64 64\u201386] |url-access=registration}}</ref> Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Liu |first=James JY |title=Art of Chinese Poetry |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-226-48687-1 |pages=21\u201322}}</ref> Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word.

Some forms of poetry carry a consistent and well-defined rhyming scheme, such as the [[chant royal]] or the [[Ruba'i|rubaiyat]], while other poetic forms have variable rhyme schemes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=71\u2013104}}</ref>\n\nMost rhyme schemes are described using letters that correspond to sets of rhymes, so if the first, second and fourth lines of a quatrain rhyme with each other and the third line do not rhyme, the quatrain is said to have an \"aa-ba\" rhyme scheme. This rhyme scheme is the one used, for example, in the rubaiyat form.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|p=27}}</ref> Similarly, an \"a-bb-a\" quatrain (what is known as \"[[enclosed rhyme]]\") is used in such forms as the [[Petrarchan sonnet]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=88\u201391}}</ref> Some types of more complicated rhyming schemes have developed names of their own, separate from the \"a-bc\" convention, such as the [[ottava rima]] and [[terza rima]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=81\u201382, 85}}</ref> The types and use of differing rhyming schemes are discussed further in the [[rhyme scheme|main article]].\n\n=== Form in poetry ===\nPoetic form is more flexible in modernist and post-modernist poetry and continues to be less structured than in previous literary eras. Many modern poets eschew recognizable structures or forms and write in [[free verse]]. But poetry remains distinguished from prose by its form; some regard for basic formal structures of poetry will be found in even the best free verse, however much such structures may appear to have been ignored.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Whitworth |first=Michael H |title=Reading modernist poetry |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-6731-4 |page=74}}</ref> Similarly, in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form for emphasis or effect.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hollander|1981|pp=50\u201351}}</ref>\n\nAmong major structural elements used in poetry are the line, the [[stanza]] or [[verse paragraph]], and larger combinations of stanzas or lines such as [[canto]]s. Also sometimes used are broader visual presentations of words and [[calligraphy]]. These basic units of poetic form are often combined into larger structures, called ''poetic forms'' or poetic modes (see the following section), as in the [[sonnet]] or [[haiku]].\n\n==== Lines and stanzas ====\n{{main|Line (poetry)|Stanza}}\n\nPoetry is often separated into lines on a page, in a process known as [[line break (poetry)|lineation]]. These lines may be based on the number of metrical feet or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=7\u201313}}</ref> See the article on [[line break (poetry)|line breaks]] for information about the division between lines.\n\nLines of poems are often organized into [[stanza]]s, which are denominated by the number of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a [[couplet]] (or [[distich]]), three lines a [[tercet|triplet]] (or [[tercet]]), four lines a [[quatrain]], and so on. These lines may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78\u201382}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alexander Blok - Noch, ulica, fonar, apteka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Alexander Blok|Blok]]'s [[Russian language|Russian]] poem, \"''Noch, ulitsa, fonar, apteka''\" (\"Night, street, lamp, drugstore\"), on a wall in [[Leiden]]]]\n\nOther poems may be organized into [[verse paragraph]]s, in which regular rhymes with established rhythms are not used, but the poetic tone is instead established by a collection of rhythms, alliterations, and rhymes established in paragraph form.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=78}}</ref> Many medieval poems were written in verse paragraphs, even where regular rhymes and rhythms were used.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Middle English Literature: a guide to criticism |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-631-23290-2 |editor-last=Dalrymple, Roger |page=10}}</ref>\n\nIn many forms of poetry, stanzas are interlocking, so that the rhyming scheme or other structural elements of one stanza determine those of succeeding stanzas. Examples of such interlocking stanzas include, for example, the [[ghazal]] and the [[villanelle]], where a refrain (or, in the case of the villanelle, refrains) is established in the first stanza which then repeats in subsequent stanzas. Related to the use of interlocking stanzas is their use to separate thematic parts of a poem. For example, the [[strophe]], [[antistrophe]] and [[epode]] of the ode form are often separated into one or more stanzas.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78\u201379}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases, particularly lengthier formal poetry such as some forms of epic poetry, stanzas themselves are constructed according to strict rules and then combined. In [[skald]]ic poetry, the [[dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt]] stanza had eight lines, each having three \"lifts\" produced with alliteration or assonance. In addition to two or three alliterations, the odd-numbered lines had partial rhyme of consonants with dissimilar vowels, not necessarily at the beginning of the word; the even lines contained internal rhyme in set syllables (not necessarily at the end of the word). Each half-line had exactly six syllables, and each line ended in a trochee. The arrangement of dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tts followed far less rigid rules than the construction of the individual dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tts.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Companion to Old Norse-Icelandic Literature and Culture |publisher=Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-4051-3738-6 |editor-last=McTurk, Rory |editor-link=Rory McTurk |pages=269\u201380}}</ref>\n\n==== Visual presentation ====\n{{Main|Visual poetry}}\n\nEven before the advent of printing, the visual appearance of poetry often added meaning or depth.

Visual elements have become an important part of the poet's toolbox, and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes.

At times, this complements the poem's [[rhythm]] through visual [[caesura]]s of various lengths, or creates [[Contrast (linguistics)|juxtapositions]] so as to accentuate meaning, [[ambiguity]] or [[irony]], or simply to create an aesthetically pleasing form.

In more developed, closed or \"received\" poetic forms, the rhyming scheme, meter and other elements of a poem are based on sets of rules, ranging from the relatively loose rules that govern the construction of an [[elegy]] to the highly formalized structure of the [[ghazal]] or [[villanelle]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=160\u201365}}</ref> Described below are some common forms of poetry widely used across a number of languages. Additional forms of poetry may be found in the discussions of the poetry of particular cultures or periods and in the [[Glossary of poetry terms|glossary]].\n\n=== Sonnet ===\n[[File:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shakespeare]]]]\n{{Main|Sonnet}}\n\nAmong the most common forms of poetry, popular from the [[Late Middle Ages]] on, is the sonnet, which by the 13th century had become standardized as fourteen lines following a set rhyme scheme and logical structure. By the 14th century and the [[Italian Renaissance]], the form had further crystallized under the pen of [[Petrarch]], whose sonnets were translated in the 16th century by [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Sir Thomas Wyatt]], who is credited with introducing the sonnet form into English literature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=94}}</ref> A traditional Italian or [[Petrarchan sonnet]] follows the rhyme scheme ''ABBA, ABBA, CDECDE'', though some variation, perhaps the most common being CDCDCD, especially within the final six lines (or ''sestet''), is common.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Minta, Stephen |url=https://archive.org/details/petrarchpetrarch0000mint/page/15 |title=Petrarch and Petrarchism |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-7190-0748-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/petrarchpetrarch0000mint/page/15 15\u201317]}}</ref> The [[English sonnet|English (or Shakespearean) sonnet]] follows the rhyme scheme ''ABAB, CDCD, EFEF, GG'', introducing a third [[quatrain]] (grouping of four lines), a final [[couplet]], and a greater amount of variety with regard to rhyme than is usually found in its Italian predecessors. By convention, sonnets in English typically use [[iambic pentameter]], while in the [[Romance languages]], the [[hendecasyllable]] and [[Alexandrine]] are the most widely used meters.\n\nSonnets of all types often make use of a ''volta'', or \"turn,\" a point in the poem at which an idea is turned on its head, a question is answered (or introduced), or the subject matter is further complicated. This ''volta'' can often take the form of a \"but\" statement contradicting or complicating the content of the earlier lines. In the Petrarchan sonnet, the turn tends to fall around the division between the first two quatrains and the sestet, while English sonnets usually place it at or near the beginning of the closing couplet.\n[[File:Carol Ann Duffy (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Carol Ann Duffy]]]]\nSonnets are particularly associated with high poetic diction, vivid imagery, and romantic love, largely due to the influence of Petrarch as well as of early English practitioners such as [[Edmund Spenser]] (who gave his name to the [[Spenserian sonnet]]), [[Michael Drayton]], and Shakespeare, whose [[Shakespeare's sonnets|sonnets]] are among the most famous in English poetry, with twenty being included in the ''[[Oxford Book of English Verse]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Oxford Book of English Verse |title-link=Oxford Book of English Verse |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1900 |editor-last=Quiller-Couch, Arthur}}</ref> However, the twists and turns associated with the ''volta'' allow for a logical flexibility applicable to many subjects.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=119\u201333}}</ref> Poets from the earliest centuries of the sonnet to the present have utilized the form to address topics related to politics ([[John Milton]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Claude McKay]]), theology ([[John Donne]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]), war ([[Wilfred Owen]], [[e.e. cummings]]), and gender and sexuality ([[Carol Ann Duffy]]). Further, postmodern authors such as [[Ted Berrigan]] and [[John Berryman]] have challenged the traditional definitions of the sonnet form, rendering entire sequences of \"sonnets\" that often lack rhyme, a clear logical progression, or even a consistent count of fourteen lines.\n\n=== Shi ===\n[[File:Dufucalligraphy.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Du Fu]], \"On Visiting the Temple of [[Laozi]]\"]]\n{{Main|Shi (poetry)}}\n\n''Shi'' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:\u8a69|\u8a69]]|s=[[wikt:\u8bd7|\u8bd7]]|p=sh\u012b|w=shih}}) Is the main type of [[Classical Chinese poetry]].<ref>[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971).

In all cases, rhyming is obligatory. The Yuefu is a folk ballad or a poem written in the folk ballad style, and the number of lines and the length of the lines could be irregular. For the other variations of ''shi'' poetry, generally either a four line (quatrain, or ''[[jueju]]'') or else an eight-line poem is normal; either way with the even numbered lines rhyming. The line length is scanned by an according number of characters (according to the convention that one character equals one syllable), and are predominantly either five or seven characters long, with a [[caesura]] before the final three syllables. The lines are generally end-stopped, considered as a series of couplets, and exhibit verbal parallelism as a key poetic device.<ref>[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971).

(New York: Columbia University Press). {{ISBN|0-231-03464-4}}, 1\u20132 and 15\u201318</ref> The \"old style\" verse (''Gushi'') is less formally strict than the ''jintishi'', or regulated verse, which, despite the name \"new style\" verse actually had its theoretical basis laid as far back as [[Shen Yue]] (441\u2013513 CE), although not considered to have reached its full development until the time of [[Chen Zi'ang]] (661\u2013702 CE).<ref>[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971).

Among its other rules, the jintishi rules regulate the tonal variations within a poem, including the use of set patterns of the [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]] of [[Middle Chinese]]. The basic form of jintishi (sushi) has eight lines in four couplets, with parallelism between the lines in the second and third couplets. The couplets with parallel lines contain contrasting content but an identical grammatical relationship between words.

The strophe and antistrophe look at the subject from different, often conflicting, perspectives, with the epode moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues.

Broadly it subsumes [[epic poetry]], but the term \"narrative poetry\" is often reserved for smaller works, generally with more appeal to [[human interest]]. Narrative poetry may be the oldest type of poetry. Many scholars of [[Homer]] have concluded that his ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' were composed of compilations of shorter narrative poems that related individual episodes. Much narrative poetry\u2014such as Scottish and English [[ballad]]s, and [[Balts|Baltic]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] heroic poems\u2014is [[performance poetry]] with roots in a preliterate [[oral tradition]].
