The facility was named after the recently deceased [[Arthur Currie|General Sir Arthur William Currie]], commander of the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during [[World War I]].\n\nOver the next decade, the facility would house a combination of personnel from the [[Royal Canadian Infantry Corps]] and [[Royal Canadian Army Service Corps]], along with personnel from the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF).\n\nDuring the Second World War a triangular air strip was constructed on the property, south of the Barracks. Two [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] stations operated out of the facility: No. 3 Service Flying Training School, with seven hangars on the north end of the strip, and No. 10 Repair Depot, with eleven hangars on the south end of the strip. The air strip was officially closed in 1964, and was removed several years later.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the Currie Barracks became an army training centre for units mobilized in southern Alberta; it was designated A-16.  These mobilized units were tasked to provide reinforcements for [[The Calgary Highlanders]] and [[The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada]].\n\nFollowing the war in 1946, the Currie Barracks became home to [[Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)]] and 1st Battalion, [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] as part of Canada's transition to having an expanded regular force army during the early years of the [[Cold War]].  The Currie Barracks underwent rapid expansion during the [[Korean War]] as the facility transformed into a major military centre, owing to its convenient access to the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s transcontinental mainline to [[Vancouver]] three kilometres to the north.  Headquarters Calgary Garrison was formed on October 26, 1950 in response to the need to coordinate the administration of army units stationed at and cycling through the Currie Barracks; thus the facility also began to use the names '''Calgary Garrison''' and '''Calgary Barracks'''.\n\n==Harvey Barracks==\n\n[[File:Harvey_Barracks_aerial_photo.png|thumb|right|220px|Harvey Barracks, 1964]]\n\nIn 1910 the Canadian military established Camp Sarcee on a piece of land expropriated from the [[Tsuu T'ina First Nation]] at the southwest corner of Calgary. Throughout the First World War the camp served as the training place for the [[10th Battalion (Canadians), CEF|10th]] and [[50th Battalion (Calgary), CEF|50th Battalions]] of the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]]. \n\nFollowing the Second World War the camp was re-established as Sarcee Barracks, being constructed during 1957 and opening in 1958. The new base contained a parade square, firing range, ropes course, school, housing, running track, and garages. In 1968 Sarcee Barracks was united with Currie Barracks to form CFB Calgary, and in 1981 the base was renamed \"Harvey Barracks\" after [[Frederick Maurice Watson Harvey|Frederick Harvey]]. The base closed in June 1997.\n\n==CFB Calgary's units, past and present==\n\nThe pending [[Unification of the Canadian Forces|unification]] of the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], [[Canadian Army]], and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] to form the [[Canadian Forces]] on February 1, 1968, precipitated a number of major changes to Canada's military.  As a result, the Currie Barracks were redesignated '''Canadian Forces Base Calgary''' (CFB Calgary) on March 14, 1966.\n\nAs a former Canadian Army facility, the newly designated CFB Calgary fell under [[Force Mobile Command]], the new command for Canada's land forces.  [[CFB Wainwright|Camp Wainwright]] at Denwood, Alberta, became a satellite auxiliary training camp under the jurisdiction of CFB Calgary on January 1, 1967, however the facility became a separately controlled base (CFB Wainwright) on August 1 of that year.\n\nCFB Calgary was reorganized by Mobile Command on February 20, 1969, when 1 Combat Group was combined with the base itself; both the base and 1 Combat Group reported to a single commander.  The base was tasked with providing administrative and support services to units posted to it in support of 1 Combat Group operations.\n\nInitial lodger units at CFB Calgary included:\n\n* Headquarters, 1 Combat Group\n* 1st [[Fort Garry Horse]]\n* 1 Signal Squadron\n* 1st Battalion [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]]\n* [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Band]]\n* Headquarters, 7 Tactical Air Unit (TAU)\n* 1 Service Battalion (The base was officially closed by the 1 Svc Bn Operations Officer Captain Stewart Campbell CD (Ret'd))\n\nThe force structure evolved as the 1st Fort Garry Horse was disbanded in 1970 as the regiment reverted to reserve status.

The facility was named after the recently deceased [[Arthur Currie|General Sir Arthur William Currie]], commander of the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during [[World War I]].\n\nOver the next decade, the facility would house a combination of personnel from the [[Royal Canadian Infantry Corps]] and [[Royal Canadian Army Service Corps]], along with personnel from the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF).\n\nDuring the Second World War a triangular air strip was constructed on the property, south of the Barracks. Two [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] stations operated out of the facility: No. 3 Service Flying Training School, with seven hangars on the north end of the strip, and No. 10 Repair Depot, with eleven hangars on the south end of the strip. The air strip was officially closed in 1964, and was removed several years later.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the Currie Barracks became an army training centre for units mobilized in southern Alberta; it was designated A-16.  These mobilized units were tasked to provide reinforcements for [[The Calgary Highlanders]] and [[The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada]].\n\nFollowing the war in 1946, the Currie Barracks became home to [[Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)]] and 1st Battalion, [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] as part of Canada's transition to having an expanded regular force army during the early years of the [[Cold War]].  The Currie Barracks underwent rapid expansion during the [[Korean War]] as the facility transformed into a major military centre, owing to its convenient access to the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s transcontinental mainline to [[Vancouver]] three kilometres to the north.  Headquarters Calgary Garrison was formed on October 26, 1950 in response to the need to coordinate the administration of army units stationed at and cycling through the Currie Barracks; thus the facility also began to use the names '''Calgary Garrison''' and '''Calgary Barracks'''.\n\n==Harvey Barracks==\n\n[[File:Harvey_Barracks_aerial_photo.png|thumb|right|220px|Harvey Barracks, 1964]]\n\nIn 1910 the Canadian Military established Camp Sarcee on a piece of land expropriated from the [[Tsuu T'ina First Nation]] at the southwest corner of Calgary. Throughout the First World War the camp served as the training place for the 10th and 50th Battalions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Following the Second World War the camp was re-established as Sarcee Barracks, being constructed during 1957 and opening in 1958. The new base contained a parade square, firing range, ropes course, school, housing, running track, and garages. In 1968 Sarcee Barracks was united with Currie Barracks to form CFB Calgary, and in 1981 the base was renamed \"Harvey Barracks\" after [[Frederick Maurice Watson Harvey|Frederick Harvey]]. The base closed in June 1997.\n\n==CFB Calgary's units, past and present==\n\nThe pending [[Unification of the Canadian Forces|unification]] of the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], [[Canadian Army]], and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] to form the [[Canadian Forces]] on February 1, 1968, precipitated a number of major changes to Canada's military.  As a result, the Currie Barracks were redesignated '''Canadian Forces Base Calgary''' (CFB Calgary) on March 14, 1966.\n\nAs a former Canadian Army facility, the newly designated CFB Calgary fell under [[Force Mobile Command]], the new command for Canada's land forces.  [[CFB Wainwright|Camp Wainwright]] at Denwood, Alberta, became a satellite auxiliary training camp under the jurisdiction of CFB Calgary on January 1, 1967, however the facility became a separately controlled base (CFB Wainwright) on August 1 of that year.\n\nCFB Calgary was reorganized by Mobile Command on February 20, 1969, when 1 Combat Group was combined with the base itself; both the base and 1 Combat Group reported to a single commander.  The base was tasked with providing administrative and support services to units posted to it in support of 1 Combat Group operations.\n\nInitial lodger units at CFB Calgary included:\n\n* Headquarters, 1 Combat Group\n* 1st [[Fort Garry Horse]]\n* 1 Signal Squadron\n* 1st Battalion [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]]\n* [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Band]]\n* Headquarters, 7 Tactical Air Unit (TAU)\n* 1 Service Battalion (The base was officially closed by the 1 Svc Bn Operations Officer Captain Stewart Campbell CD (Ret'd))\n\nThe force structure evolved as the 1st Fort Garry Horse was disbanded in 1970 as the regiment reverted to reserve status.  [[The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada]] and the [[1 Military Police Platoon]] along with [[Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)]] were garrisoned at CFB Calgary beginning in the 1960s.\n\nIn September 1991, the 1 Canadian Brigade Group and CFB Calgary became independent of each other under separate commands and reported to [[Land Force Western Area]].\n\nDespite the closure of CFB Calgary in 1998, three Reserve Force units of the Canadian Army remain at the site. These units consist of the Headquarters, 41 Canadian Brigade Group, [[41 Service Battalion]], and [[41 Combat Engineer Regiment]].

It has been established that there are two groups of \u03b1-particles differing at 760 mm pressure and 15\u00b0C by 3.08\u00b10.10 mm range reduced to zero bombarding voltage. The groups have been shown to be associated with the production of Li7 in the ground state and in an excited state. At 239 kv bombarding voltage, the excited state is formed 1.7 times as often as the ground state. The energy balance, Q, associated with the production of the ground state has been determined to be 7.093\u00b10.022 Mev. The energy of the excited level has been determined to be 494\u00b116 kev. The total yield curve for \u03b1-particles has been investigated from 235 kv to 390 kv bombarding voltage.

It has been established that there are two groups of \u03b1-particles differing at 760 mm pressure and 15\u00b0C by 3.08\u00b10.10 mm range reduced to zero bombarding voltage. The groups have been shown to be associated with the production of Li7 in the ground state and in an excited state. At 239 kv bombarding voltage, the excited state is formed 1.7 times as often as the ground state. The energy balance, Q, associated with the production of the ground state has been determined to be 7.093\u00b10.022 Mev. The energy of the excited level has been determined to be 494\u00b116 kev. The total yield curve for \u03b1-particles has been investigated from 235 kv to 390 kv bombarding voltage. The measured value for the energy of the excited level in Li7 is discussed in connection with values from other reactions in which Li7 is an end product and with \u03b3-ray measurements of the level.<ref name=\"Thesis\"/> }}\n\n===Papers===\n\n====1930s - 1940s====\n*[[Samuel King Allison|Allison, Samuel K.]], Graves, Elizabeth R., [[Lester Skaggs|Skaggs, Lester S.]], & [[Nicholas M.

She earned her PhD from the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]], and though her family suffered during [[The Holocaust]], Gertrude was able to escape to London and later to the United States.  Her research during [[World War II]] was classified, and not published until 1946.  She and her husband, [[Maurice Goldhaber]], spent most of their post-war careers at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].\n\n==Early life==\nGertrude Scharff was born in [[Mannheim]], [[Germany]] on July 14, 1911.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P3\"/> She attended [[Public school (government funded)|public school]], and it is there that she developed an interest in science.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/> Unusual for the time, her parents supported this interest \u2014 possibly because her father had wanted to be a chemist before being forced to support his family with the death of his father.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/> Goldhaber's early life was filled with hardship.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/> During [[World War I]] she recalled having to eat bread made partially of [[sawdust]], and her family suffered through the [[hyperinflation]] of [[Weimar Republic|postwar Germany]], although it did not prevent her from attending the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/>\n\n==Education==\nAt the University of Munich Gertrude quickly developed an interest in [[physics]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/> Although her family had supported her early interest in science, her father encouraged her to study law at Munich.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/>  In defense of her decision to study physics Gertrude told her father, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in the law. I want to understand what the world is made of.\u201d<ref name=\"Saxon98\"/><ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/>\n\nAs was usual for students at the time, Gertrude spent semesters at various other universities including the [[University of Freiburg]], the [[University of Zurich]], and the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] (where she would meet her future husband) before returning to the University of Munich.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/> Upon returning to Munich Gertrude took up a position with [[Walter Gerlach]] to perform her thesis research.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/> In her thesis Gertrude studied the effects of stress on magnetization.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P6\"/> She graduated in 1935 and published her thesis in 1936.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P6\"/>\n\nWith the rise to power of the [[Nazi party]] in 1933, Gertrude faced increasing difficulties in Germany because of her [[Jew|Jewish heritage]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/> During this time her father was arrested and jailed, and although he and his wife were able to flee to [[Switzerland]] upon his release, they later returned to Germany and perished in [[The Holocaust]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/> Gertrude remained in Germany until the completion of her [[Ph.D.]] in 1935, at which point she fled to [[London]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/><ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/> Although Gertrude's parents did not escape the Nazis her sister Liselotte did.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/>\n\n==Career==\nFor the first six months of her stay in London, Gertrude lived off the money she made from selling her [[Leica Camera|Leica]] camera, as well as money earned from translating German to English.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/> Gertrude found that having a Ph.D. was a disadvantage as there were more spots for refugee students than for refugee scientists.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/> She wrote to 35 other refugee scientists looking for work, and was told by all but one that there were already too many refugee scientists already working.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P6\"/><ref name=\"Bond and Henley P7\">[[#Bond99|Bond and Henley 1999]], p. 7</ref> Only Maurice Goldhaber wrote back offering any hope, stating that he thought she might be able to find work in [[Cambridge]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P7\"/> Gertrude was able to find work in [[George Paget Thomson]]'s lab working on [[electron diffraction]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P7\"/> Although she had a post-doctoral position with Thomson, Gertrude realized that she was not going to be offered a real position with him and so looked for other work.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/>\n\nIn 1939 Gertrude married [[Maurice Goldhaber]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/><ref name=\"CWP\"/> She then moved to [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]], [[Illinois]] to join him at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/> The state of Illinois had strict [[nepotism|anti-nepotism]] laws at the time which prevented Gertrude Goldhaber from being hired by the university because her husband already had a position there.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/> Gertrude was granted neither salary nor laboratory space, and worked in Maurice's lab as an unpaid assistant.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/> Since Maurice's lab was only set up for [[nuclear physics]] research, Gertrude Goldhaber took up research in that field as well.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/> During this time Gertrude and Maurice Goldhaber had two sons: Alfred and Michael.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/><ref name=\"CWP\"/> Goldhaber was eventually given a soft-money line by the department to help support her research.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/>\n\nGoldhaber studied neutron-proton and neutron-nucleus reaction [[Cross section (physics)|cross sections]] in 1941, and gamma radiation emission and absorption by [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in 1942.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P7\"/> Around this time she also observed that [[spontaneous nuclear fission]] is accompanied by the release of neutrons \u2014 a result that had been theorized earlier but had yet to be shown.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P7\"/> Her work with spontaneous nuclear fission was [[Classified information|classified]] during [[World War II|the war]], and was only published after the war ended in 1946.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P7\"/>\n\nGertrude and Maurice Goldhaber moved from Illinois to [[Long Island]] where they both joined the staff of [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/><ref name=\"Bond and Henley P6\">[[#Bond99|Bond and Henley 1999]], p. 6</ref> At the laboratory she founded a series of monthly lectures known as the Brookhaven Lecture Series which is still continuing {{As of|2009|June|lc=yes|df=US}}.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P6\"/><ref name=\"BNL Lectures\">[[#BHNL Lecture|Brookhaven Lecture Series]]</ref>\n\n==Honors==\n* 1947 \u2014 elected as a fellow of the [[American Physical Society]]<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P6\"/>\n* 1972 \u2014 elected to [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (the third female physicist to be so honored)<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P6\"/>\n* 1982 \u2014 [[Long Island Achiever\u2019s Award in Science]]<ref

She earned her PhD from the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]], and though her family suffered during [[The Holocaust]], Gertrude was able to escape to London and later to the United States.  Her research during [[World War II]] was classified, and not published until 1946.  She and her husband, [[Maurice Goldhaber]], spent most of their post-war careers at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].\n\n==Early life==\nGertrude Scharff was born in [[Mannheim]], [[Germany]] on July 14, 1911.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P3\"/> She attended [[Public school (government funded)|public school]], and it is there that she developed an interest in science.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/> Unusual for the time, her parents supported this interest \u2014 possibly because her father had wanted to be a chemist before being forced to support his family with the death of his father.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/> Goldhaber's early life was filled with hardship.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/> During [[World War I]] she recalled having to eat bread made partially of [[sawdust]], and her family suffered through the [[hyperinflation]] of [[Weimar Republic|postwar Germany]], although it did not prevent her from attending the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/>\n\n==Education==\nAt the University of Munich Gertrude quickly developed an interest in [[physics]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/> Although her family had supported her early interest in science, her father encouraged her to study law at Munich.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/>  In defense of her decision to study physics Gertrude told her father, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in the law. I want to understand what the world is made of.\u201d<ref name=\"Saxon98\"/><ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/>\n\nAs was usual for students at the time, Gertrude spent semesters at various other universities including the [[University of Freiburg]], the [[University of Zurich]], and the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] (where she would meet her future husband) before returning to the University of Munich.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/> Upon returning to Munich Gertrude took up a position with [[Walter Gerlach]] to perform her thesis research.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/> In her thesis Gertrude studied the effects of stress on magnetization.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P6\"/> She graduated in 1935 and published her thesis in 1936.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P6\"/>\n\nWith the rise to power of the [[Nazi party]] in 1933, Gertrude faced increasing difficulties in Germany because of her [[Jew|Jewish heritage]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/> During this time her father was arrested and jailed, and although he and his wife were able to flee to [[Switzerland]] upon his release, they later returned to Germany and perished in [[The Holocaust]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/> Gertrude remained in Germany until the completion of her [[Ph.D.]] in 1935, at which point she fled to [[London]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/><ref name=\"Bond and Henley P4\"/> Although Gertrude's parents did not escape the Nazis her sister Liselotte did.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/>\n\n==Career==\nFor the first six months of her stay in London, Gertrude lived off the money she made from selling her [[Leica Camera|Leica]] camera, as well as money earned from translating German to English.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/> Gertrude found that having a Ph.D. was a disadvantage as there were more spots for refugee students than for refugee scientists.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/> She wrote to 35 other refugee scientists looking for work, and was told by all but one that there were already too many refugee scientists already working.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P6\"/><ref name=\"Bond and Henley P7\">[[#Bond99|Bond and Henley 1999]], p. 7</ref> Only Maurice Goldhaber wrote back offering any hope, stating that he thought she might be able to find work in [[Cambridge]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P7\"/> Gertrude was able to find work in [[George Paget Thomson]]'s lab working on [[electron diffraction]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P7\"/> Although she had a post-doctoral position with Thomson, Gertrude realized that she was not going to be offered a real position with him and so looked for other work.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/>\n\nIn 1939 Gertrude married [[Maurice Goldhaber]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/><ref name=\"CWP\"/> She then moved to [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]], [[Illinois]] to join him at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/> The state of Illinois had strict [[nepotism|anti-nepotism]] laws at the time which prevented Gertrude Goldhaber from being hired by the university because her husband already had a position there.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/> Gertrude was granted neither salary nor laboratory space, and worked in Maurice's lab as an unpaid assistant.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/> Since Maurice's lab was only set up for [[nuclear physics]] research, Gertrude Goldhaber took up research in that field as well.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/> During this time Gertrude and Maurice Goldhaber had two sons: Alfred and Michael.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/><ref name=\"CWP\"/> Goldhaber was eventually given a soft-money line by the department to help support her research.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/>\n\nGoldhaber studied neutron-proton and neutron-nucleus reaction [[Cross section (physics)|cross sections]] in 1941, and gamma radiation emission and absorption by [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in 1942.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P7\"/> Around this time she also observed that [[spontaneous nuclear fission]] is accompanied by the release of neutrons \u2014 a result that had been theorized earlier but had yet to be shown.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P7\"/> Her work with spontaneous nuclear fission was [[Classified information|classified]] during [[World War II|the war]], and was only published after the war ended in 1946.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P7\"/>\n\nGertrude and Maurice Goldhaber moved from Illinois to [[Long Island]] where they both joined the staff of [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P5\"/><ref name=\"Bond and Henley P6\">[[#Bond99|Bond and Henley 1999]], p. 6</ref> At the laboratory she founded a series of monthly lectures known as the Brookhaven Lecture Series which is still continuing {{As of|2009|June|lc=yes|df=US}}.<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P6\"/><ref name=\"BNL Lectures\">[[#BHNL Lecture|Brookhaven Lecture Series]]</ref>\n\n==Honors==\n* 1947 \u2014 elected as a fellow of the [[American Physical Society]]<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P6\"/>\n* 1972 \u2014 elected to [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (the third female physicist to be so honored)<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P6\"/>\n* 1982 \u2014 [[Long Island Achiever\u2019s Award in Science]]<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P6\"/>\n* 1984 \u2014 [[Phi Beta Kappa]] visiting scholar<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P6\"/>\n* 1990 \u2014 Outstanding Woman Scientist Award from the New York Chapter of the [[Association for Women Scientists]]<ref name=\"Bond and Henley P6\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2001, [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] created [[Goldhaber fellows|the Gertrude and Maurice Goldhaber Distinguished Fellowships]] in her honor. These prestigious Fellowships are awarded to early-career scientists with exceptional talent and credentials who have a strong desire for independent research at the frontiers of their fields.<ref>[http://www.bnl.gov/HR/goldhaber.asp Goldhaber Distinguished Fellowships]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation|last=Bond|first=Peter D.|first2=Ernest|last2=Henley|title=Gertrude Scharff Goldhaber 1911-1998: A Biographical Memoir |accessdate=2009-03-05|series=Biographical Memoirs |volume= 77|year=1999|publisher= [[National Academies Press|The National Academy Press]]|location= [[Washington, D.C.]]|ref=Bond99|url=http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/ggoldhaber.pdf}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/lectures/default.asp|title=Brookhaven Lecture Series|date=July 2, 2008|publisher=[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]|accessdate=2009-07-01|ref=BHNL Lecture}}\n*{{Citation | last =Goldhaber | first =Maurice | author-link = Maurice Goldhaber | year =2001 | title =Gertrude Scharff Goldhaber | series = Contributions of 20th Century Women to Physics | publisher = [[University of California, Los Angeles]] | url =http://cwp.library.ucla.edu/Phase2/Goldhaber,_Gertrude_Scharff@812345678.html |archiveurl= |archivedate= | accessdate =2009-03-05 |ref=Goldhaber2001}}\n*{{Citation | last =Saxon | first =Wolfgang | title =Gertrude Scharff Goldhaber, 86, Crucial Scientist in Nuclear Fission | periodical = [[The New York Times]] | date =February 6, 1998 | pages =D18 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DC123DF935A35751C0A96E958260 |archiveurl= |archivedate= | accessdate =2009-03-05|ref=Saxon98}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Goldhaber, Gertrude Scharff}}\n[[Category:American nuclear physicists]]\n[[Category:Experimental physicists]]\n[[Category:1911 births]]\n[[Category:1998 deaths]]\n[[Category:American women physicists]]\n[[Category:American women scientists]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Brookhaven National Laboratory staff]]\n[[Category:Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich alumni]]\n[[Category:20th-century physicists]]\n[[Category:20th-century American scientists]]\n[[Category:20th-century American women scientists]]\n[[Category:Women nuclear physicists]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removing fromCategory:American women scientistsusingCat-a-lot", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gertrude_Scharff_Goldhaber"}
