It was awarded to recognize U-boat crews who had completed three war patrols. The badge was worn on the lower left side of the uniform and was oval shaped resembling a wreath of laurel leaves. A submarine lay across the center and the [[German State Crown]] (Reichskrone) was inlaid at the top center of the wreath.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|pp=118, 119}}{{sfn|Ailsby|1987|p=118}}\n\nOn October 13, 1939, the ''U-boat War Badge'' was reinstituted.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|p=118}} It was very similar to the original badge with the exception of the imperial crown being replaced with a [[German Eagle]] above a swastika, and a more modernized submarine now facing towards the left was used.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|pp=118, 119}}{{sfn|Ailsby|1987|p=118}} The new version was first made of bronze metal, with later ones made of zinc with a \"gold wash\".{{sfn|Angolia|1987|p=119}}\n\n==Classes==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:U-boat War Badge.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''U-boat War Badge'' from World War II]] -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:U-boat War Badge with Diamonds.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''U-boat War Badge with Diamonds'' from\nWorld War II]] -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Special-Badge-U-Boat-War.JPG|thumb|right|250px|''Special Grade of U-boat War Badge with Diamonds'' from World War II (uniquely worn by Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz) ]] -->\nThe award was bestowed in two classes:\n\n===U-Boat War Badge===\nThere were several ways to be awarded this medal. The most common would be the completion of two or more war patrols.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|p=118}} Although the completion of two war patrols might seem a lowly requirement, but a typical U-boat war cruise would often run into months at a time. Completing two war patrols could be equally dangerous as the U-boat has to endure constant attacks by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[aircraft]] and [[warship]]s.

It was awarded to recognize U-boat crews who had completed three war patrols. The badge was worn on the lower left side of the uniform and was oval shaped resembling a wreath of laurel leaves. A submarine lay across the center and the [[German State Crown]] (Reichskrone) was inlaid at the top center of the wreath.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|pp=118, 119}}{{sfn|Ailsby|1987|p=118}}\n\nOn October 13, 1939, the ''U-boat War Badge'' was reinstituted.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|p=118}} It was very similar to the original badge with the exception of the imperial crown being replaced with a [[German Eagle]] above a swastika, and a more modernized submarine now facing towards the left was used.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|pp=118, 119}}{{sfn|Ailsby|1987|p=118}} The new version was first made of bronze metal, with later ones made of zinc with a \"gold wash\".{{sfn|Angolia|1987|p=119}}\n\n==Classes==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:U-boat War Badge.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''U-boat War Badge'' from World War II]] -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:U-boat War Badge with Diamonds.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''U-boat War Badge with Diamonds'' from \nWorld War II]] -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Special-Badge-U-Boat-War.JPG|thumb|right|250px|''Special Grade of U-boat War Badge with Diamonds'' from World War II (uniquely worn by Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz) ]] -->\nThe award was bestowed in two classes:\n\n===U-Boat War Badge===\nThere were several ways to be awarded this medal.

A total {{USD|30 million}} prize pool was available across the various competitions.\n\n==Overview==\nThe Fortnite World Cup uses two of the game modes available to the video game, ''Fortnite''. The main World Cup event as well as the Pro-Am use ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', a [[battle royale game]] where up to 100 players airdrop onto an island without any weapons or armor, save for a pickaxe. Once on the ground, players must scavenge for weapons, armor, and healing items, as well as using their pickaxe to knock down existing features to gather wood, stone, and metal resources. This all must be done while avoiding attacks from other players, as well as staying within a shrinking circle on the map or risk taking fatal damage outside it. Players can use gathered resources to build walls, floors, and stairs and ramps to use as cover from attacks. The last player or team left alive wins. In ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'', players can build unique courses at their own pace, which can be used to create competitive events that can then share with others.\n\nThe Fortnite World Cup had online events over 10 weeks from April to June 2019 for people to place. The weeks alternated between solo players and duos teams. During the Saturday of each week, any player or duo could compete with others by geographic region, playing up to 10 matches to earn points through eliminations and victories. The top three thousand players/teams from each region then competed on the Sunday event, again playing up to ten matches to earn points. The top point-scorers in each region from the Sunday event then proceed through to the World Cup, a total of about twenty players/teams each week.<ref name=\"epicgames.com\">[https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/events/world-cup/about]</ref> An estimated 40 million players vied for spots in the solo and duos World Cup.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/us/fortnite-world-cup-winner-bugha.html | title = This Fortnite World Cup Winner Is 16 and $3 Million Richer | first1 = Derrick Bryson | last1= Taylor | first2=Niraj | last2= Chokshi | date = July 29, 2019 | accessdate = July 29, 2019 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref> In the World Cup finals, the competitors played a total of six matches, with points earned for the highest finishers.

Similarly, each duo team in the final received a minimum of {{USD|100,000}} with the top team winning {{USD|3 million}}.<ref name=\"variety viewership\"/>\n\nThe Fortnite Creative Cup had a similar online process to select the players for the finals, taking place over five two-week periods from April to June 2019. Each active week, a new Creative challenge is available. Players, once completed with their Creative island, must submit a video of that challenge to Epic in that period. For each period, Epic selected three of the best entries by a panel of judges. Each selected entry earns a cash prize of {{USD|5,000}} and a guaranteed spot in the Creative Cup finals. From the fifteen winning entries, five were selected by Epic to be used in the Creative Cup finales.<ref>[https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-world-cup-creative-competitions-official-rules]</ref> In the finales, eight teams of four, consisting of those that had their Creative island selected and other notable ''Fortnite'' players, complete in these five events to earn the best overall score. The winners in the finale split a {{USD|3 million}} prize pool.<ref name=\"epicgames.com\"/>\n\nThe teams for the Fortnite Pro-Am are selected by Epic Games, with each team made up of a ''Fortnite'' streamer and a celebrity. The teams each played five matches, with a scoring system for the winning teams. The team with the highest overall score after five matches won the Pro-Am. Each team received a minimum of {{USD|20,000}} with the winning team receiving {{USD|1 million}}.\n\nfinite battle Royale\n[[Epic Games]] had launched ''Fortnite'' in its original planned form, now known as ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'', as an [[early access]] title in July 2017, around the same time that the first influential [[battle royale game]], ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]''(PUBG) was released. Inspired by this, Epic created a variation of ''Fortnite'' and released it as ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' in September 2017. While [[free-to-play]], the game was supported by [[microtransaction]]s.

A total {{USD|30 million}} prize pool was available across the various competitions.\n\n==Overview==\nThe Fortnite World Cup uses two of the game modes available to the video game, ''Fortnite''. The main World Cup event as well as the Pro-Am use ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', a [[battle royale game]] where up to 100 players airdrop onto an island without any weapons or armor, save for a pickaxe. Once on the ground, players must scavenge for weapons, armor, and healing items, as well as using their pickaxe to knock down existing features to gather wood, stone, and metal resources. This all must be done while avoiding attacks from other players, as well as staying within a shrinking circle on the map or risk taking fatal damage outside it. Players can use gathered resources to build walls, floors, and stairs and ramps to use as cover from attacks. The last player or team left alive wins. In ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'', players can build unique courses at their own pace, which can be used to create competitive events that can then share with others.\n\nThe Fortnite World Cup had online events over 10 weeks from April to June 2019 for people to place. The weeks alternated between solo players and duos teams. During the Saturday of each week, any player or duo could compete with others by geographic region, playing up to 10 matches to earn points through eliminations and victories. The top three thousand players/teams from each region then competed on the Sunday event, again playing up to ten matches to earn points. The top point-scorers in each region from the Sunday event then proceed through to the World Cup, a total of about twenty players/teams each week.<ref name=\"epicgames.com\">[https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/events/world-cup/about]</ref> An estimated 40 million players vied for spots in the solo and duos World Cup.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/us/fortnite-world-cup-winner-bugha.html | title = This Fortnite World Cup Winner Is 16 and $3 Million Richer | first1 = Derrick Bryson | last1= Taylor | first2=Niraj | last2= Chokshi | date = July 29, 2019 | accessdate = July 29, 2019 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref> In the World Cup finals, the competitors played a total of six matches, with points earned for the highest finishers.

Similarly, each duo team in the final received a minimum of {{USD|100,000}} with the top team winning {{USD|3 million}}.<ref name=\"variety viewership\"/>\n\nThe Fortnite Creative Cup had a similar online process to select the players for the finals, taking place over five two-week periods from April to June 2019. Each active week, a new Creative challenge is available. Players, once completed with their Creative island, must submit a video of that challenge to Epic in that period. For each period, Epic selected three of the best entries by a panel of judges. Each selected entry earns a cash prize of {{USD|5,000}} and a guaranteed spot in the Creative Cup finals. From the fifteen winning entries, five were selected by Epic to be used in the Creative Cup finales.<ref>[https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-world-cup-creative-competitions-official-rules]</ref> In the finales, eight teams of four, consisting of those that had their Creative island selected and other notable ''Fortnite'' players, complete in these five events to earn the best overall score. The winners in the finale split a {{USD|3 million}} prize pool.<ref name=\"epicgames.com\"/>\n\nThe teams for the Fortnite Pro-Am are selected by Epic Games, with each team made up of a ''Fortnite'' streamer and a celebrity. The teams each played five matches, with a scoring system for the winning teams. The team with the highest overall score after five matches won the Pro-Am. Each team received a minimum of {{USD|20,000}} with the winning team receiving {{USD|1 million}}.\n\n==History==\n[[Epic Games]] had launched ''Fortnite'' in its original planned form, now known as ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'', as an [[early access]] title in July 2017, around the same time that the first influential [[battle royale game]], ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]''(PUBG) was released. Inspired by this, Epic created a variation of ''Fortnite'' and released it as ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' in September 2017. While [[free-to-play]], the game was supported by [[microtransaction]]s. ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' rapidly became popular, and by June 2018, with the game ported to computer, consoles, and mobile devices, had reached 125 million players.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17456814/fortnite-battle-royale-epic-games-125-million-players-first-year-e3-2018 | title = Fortnite now has 125 million players just one year after launch | first = Nick | last = Statt | date = June 12, 2018 | accessdate = June 12, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180613155733/https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17456814/fortnite-battle-royale-epic-games-125-million-players-first-year-e3-2018 | archivedate = June 13, 2018 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Total 2018 revenue for ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' was estimated at {{USD|2.4 billion|long=no}} by analysis firm SuperData Research.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-01-16-fortnite-tops-2018-superdata-chart-with-usd2-4b-digital-revenue | title = Fortnite tops SuperData's 2018 chart with $2.4 billion digital revenue | first=  Matthew | last =Handrahan | date = January 16, 2019 | accessdate = January 16, 2019 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref> Epic designated {{USD|100 million}} of these revenues to position ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' as an esport.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/epic-makes-fornite-biggest-esport-with-100-million-in-prize-money.html | title = Epic makes \u2018Fortnite\u2019 biggest esport in the world with $100 million in prize money. | first = Tae | last = Kim | date = May 21, 2018 | accessdate = July 15, 2018 | website = [[CNBC]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180715210712/https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/epic-makes-fornite-biggest-esport-with-100-million-in-prize-money.html | archive-date = July 15, 2018 | url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nThe inaugural Fortnite World Cup was first announced in February 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18235132/fortnite-world-cup-final-date-prize-money-new-york-esports | title = Fortnite\u2019s $30 million World Cup final is happening in July | first = Andrew | last = Webster | date = February 22, 2019 | accessdate = February 22, 2019 | work = [[The Verge]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190223102447/https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18235132/fortnite-world-cup-final-date-prize-money-new-york-esports | archive-date = February 23, 2019 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Vincent |first1=Brittany |title=The next World Cup?

His father, a truck driver, abandoned his family in Gray's youth. Upon the death of his mother, Mfume dropped out of high school at sixteen to begin working as many as three jobs at a time to support his three sisters. He also began hanging around street corners, sometimes with the wrong friends. In his biography, he reports that he \"was locked up a couple of times on suspicion of theft because [he] happened to be black and happened to be young.\" Speculation as to the degree of his entanglement with the law has varied, especially as he later came into prominence.

Often working 40 to 46 hours per week at various Baltimore city Teen Centers (an after school program) while simultaneously a full-time student at [[Baltimore City Community College]], where he served as the head of its [[Black Students Union]] and the editor of the school newspaper. He went on to attend [[Morgan State University]], where he graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1976. He would go on to earn a [[Master of Liberal Arts]] degree in 1984 at [[Johns Hopkins University]].

Upon the death of his mother, Mfume dropped out of high school at sixteen to begin working as many as three jobs at a time to support his three sisters. He also began hanging around street corners, sometimes with the wrong friends. In his biography, he reports that he \"was locked up a couple of times on suspicion of theft because [he] happened to be black and happened to be young.\" Speculation as to the degree of his entanglement with the law has varied, especially as he later came into prominence.

He went on to attend [[Morgan State University]], where he graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1976. He would go on to earn a [[Master of Liberal Arts]] degree in 1984 at [[Johns Hopkins University]].
