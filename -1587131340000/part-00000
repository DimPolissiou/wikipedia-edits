As part of the Virginia Company and Colony, the London Company owned a large portion of Atlantic and Inland Canada. The company was permitted by its charter to establish a {{convert|100|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} settlement within this area. The portion of the company's territory north of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] was shared with the [[Plymouth Company]], with the stipulation that neither company found a colony within 100 miles (161&nbsp;km) of each other.\n\nThe London Company made landfall on 26 April 1607, at the southern edge of the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]], which they named [[Cape Henry]], near present-day [[Virginia Beach]]. Deciding to move the encampment, on 4 May 1607, they established the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown Settlement]]  on the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] about {{convert|40|mi|km}} upstream from its mouth at the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Later in 1607, the Plymouth Company established its [[Popham Colony]] in present-day [[Maine]], but it was abandoned after about a year. By 1609, the Plymouth Company had dissolved. As a result, the charter for the London Company was adjusted with a new grant that extended from \"sea to sea\" of the previously-shared area between the 38th and [[40th parallel north|40th parallel]]. It was amended in 1612 to include the new territory of the ''Somers Isles (or [[Bermuda]]).\n\nThe London Company struggled financially, especially with labour shortages in its Virginia colony. Its profits improved after sweeter strains of [[tobacco]] than the native variety were cultivated and successfully exported from Virginia as a [[cash crop]] beginning in 1612. By 1619 a system of indentured service was fully developed in the colony;<ref>Karl Frederick Geiser, [https://archive.org/stream/redemptionersind00geis/redemptionersind00geis_djvu.txt Redemptioners and indentured servants in the colony and commonwealth of Pennsylvania], p.5.

Each company was made up of investors, known as \"adventurers\", who purchased shares of company stock. The Crown granted a charter to each company with a monopoly to explore, settle, or trade with a particular region of the world. Profits were shared among the investors according to the amount of stock that each owned. More than 6,300 Englishmen invested in joint-stock companies between 1585 and 1630, trading in Russia, Turkey, Africa, the East Indies, the Mediterranean, and North America.\n\n===Founding===\nInvestors in the [[Virginia Company]] hoped to profit from the natural resources of the New World. In 1606 Captain [[Bartholomew Gosnold]] obtained of King [[James VI and I|James I]] a charter for two companies. The first, the Virginia Company of London (now known generally as the \"London Company\"), covered what are now [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]] and [[The Carolinas|Carolina]], between Latitude 34\u00b0 and Latitude 41\u00b0 North.

Almost 1,700 people purchased shares, including men of different occupations and classes, wealthy women, and representatives of institutions such as trade guilds, towns and cities. Proceedes from the sale of stock was used to help finance the costs of establishing overseas settlements, including paying for ships and supplies and recruiting and outfitng laborers.

They named this shore as [[Cape Henry]]. They were attacked by Native Americans, and the settlers moved north. On 14 May 1607, these first settlers selected the site of [[Jamestown Island]], further upriver and on the northern shore, as the place to build their fort.\n\nIn addition to survival, the early colonists were expected to make a profit for the owners of the Virginia Company. Although the settlers were disappointed that gold did not wash up on the beach and gems did not grow in the trees, they realised there was great potential for wealth of other kinds in their new home. Early industries, such as glass manufacture, pitch and tar production for naval stores, and beer and wine making took advantage of natural resources and the land's fertility. From the outset settlers thought that the abundance of timber would be the primary leg of the economy, as Britain's forests had long been felled. The seemingly inexhaustible supply of cheap American timber was to be the primary enabler of England's (and then Britain's) rise to maritime (merchant and naval) supremacy. However, the settlers could not devote as much time as the Virginia Company would have liked to developing commodity products for export. They were too busy trying to survive.\n[[File:Jamestown_settler_dead_in_the_swamp.jpg|thumb|Jamestown Settler dead in the swamp]]\nWithin the three-sided fort erected on the banks of the James, the settlers quickly discovered that they were, first and foremost, employees of the Virginia Company of London, following instructions of the men appointed by the Company to rule them. In exchange, the laborers were armed, and received clothes and food from the common store. After seven years, they were to receive land of their own. The gentlemen, who provided their own armor and weapons, were to be paid in land, dividends or additional shares of stock.\n\nInitially, the colonists were governed by a president and seven-member council selected by the King. Leadership problems quickly erupted. Jamestown's first two leaders coped with varying degrees of success with sickness, assaults by Native Americans, poor food and water supplies, and class strife. Many colonists were ill-prepared to carve out a new settlement on a frontier. When [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]] became Virginia's third president, he proved the strong leader that the colony needed. Industry flourished and relations with [[Chief Powhatan]]'s people improved.\n[[File:Colonial_Jamestown_About_1614.jpg|thumb|Artist conception of aerial view of Jamestown 1614]]\n\n=== Instructions for the Virginia Company ===\nAfter so many failed colonizing attempts in the 16th Century such as the [[Roanoke Colony]] and with the ascension of [[James VI and I|King James]] to the throne of England on 24 March 1603 the effort to colonize was renewed, this time in the form of joint stock companies, which did not involve the public (King's) treasury thus from a Royal perspective a risk-free endeavor. Although a profit-driven enterprise, the King was motivated by international rivalry and the propagation of religion, and the individuals who undertook the risk of venturing to the new world were motivated by a chance to improve their economic and social standing.\n\nThus King James awarded a patent to a group of investors which included detailed instructions for everything from where to place watchmen and with how many, to where to plant.  It instructed [[Christopher Newport]], captain of the [[Susan Constant]], and [[Bartholomew Gosnold]], captain of the [[Godspeed (ship)|Godspeed]] and leader of the expedition of three ships, on their duties upon reaching the land they named Virginia. There were no instructions for administration or governance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1600-1650/instructions-for-the-virginia-colony-1606.php|title=Instructions for the Virginia Colony 1606|website=American History Revoluion to Reconstruction and Beyond}}</ref>\n\n=== The Charter of 1606 ===\n{{main|Charter of 1606}}\nThe First Virginia Charter established provisions for governance of the colony. It was to be governed by a  colonial council, which proved ineffective.  A governor, [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Lord Delaware]], was dispatched in  1610 to provide firmer governance of the colony. The council back in London whose directives and interests Lord Delaware represented was composed of knights, gentlemen and  merchants who had invested in the company. This charter also limited the jurisdiction of the Virginia company  of London to 100 miles from the seaboard and from 38 degrees to 45 degrees latitude north.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1600-1650/the-first-virginia-charter-1606.php|title=First Virginia Company|website=American History Revolution to Reconstruction}}</ref>\n\n===Charter of 1609===\n{{Main|Second Virginia Charter}}\n[[Image:Wpdms virginia company plymouth council.png|right|thumb|The 1608 grant to the Virginia Company of London \"from sea to sea\" is shown demarcated in red.

Investment boomed as the Company launched an intensive recruitment campaign.

When Gates finally arrived to take up his new post in 1610, with most of the survivors of the ''Sea Venture'' (on two new ships built in Bermuda, the ''Deliverance'' and the ''Patience''), he found that only 60 of the original 214 colonists had survived the infamous [[Starving Time (Jamestown)|\"Starving Time\" of 1609\u20131610]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apva.org/history/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416222010/http://www.apva.org/history/index.html |archivedate=2009-04-16 }} Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities: ''Jamestown History''</ref> Most of these were dying or ill. Despite the abundance of food which Gates' expedition brought from Bermuda (which had necessitated the building of two ships), it was clear the colony was not yet self-sufficient and could not survive.\n\nThe survivors of Jamestown were taken aboard the ''Deliverance'' and the ''Patience'', and the colony was abandoned. Gates intended to transport all the settlers back to England, but the fortuitous arrival of another relief fleet, bearing [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Governor Lord De la Warre]], granted Jamestown a reprieve. All the settlers were put ashore again, and Sir George Somers returned to Bermuda aboard the ''Patience'' to obtain more food. (Somers died there, and his nephew, Matthew Somers, the captain of the ''Patience'', sailed the vessel to [[Lyme Regis]] in England, instead, to claim his inheritance).\n\n=== Charter of 1612 ===\nThe third Virginia \u00a0Charter or Charter of 1612, was essentially the same as the Charter of 1609, with the difference being\u00a0 territorial jurisdiction, expanding it to the Atlantic Islands like Bermuda and from \u201csea to sea\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1600-1650/the-third-virginia-charter-1612.php|title=The Third Virginia Charter|website=American History Revolution to Reconstruction and Beyond}}</ref>\n\n=== The \"Great Charter\" ===\nThis was an ordinance and constitution that proceeded from a set of instructions issued in 1618 to the governor and the [[Virginia Governor's Council|Council of Virginia]] known as An Ordinance and Constitution of the Virginia Company in England 24 July 1621.<ref name=\"ThreeCharters1957\">{{Cite book|title=The Three Charters of the Virginia Company of London with Seven Related Documents|chapter= \"Virginia Company, Instructions to Governor Yeardley\"(Sometimes called \"The Great Charter\")|editor=Bemiss, Samuel M.|date=1957|publisher=Williamsburg, VA: Virginia 350th Anniversary Celebration Corporation|chapter-url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/36181/36181-h/36181-h.htm#pg_8}}</ref> This document replaced military law with common law, and provided for land ownership for settlers living in the colony.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kukla, Jon|year=1985|title=Order and Chaos in Early America: Political and Social Stability in Pre-Restoration Virginia|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=90|issue=2|pages=275\u2013299|jstor=1852667|doi=10.2307/1852667}}</ref>{{rp|283}} It is\u00a0also of great significance for it provides governance independent of the Crown.

The Company debt was now over \u00a39,000. Worried Virginians were hardly reassured by the advice of pragmatic Treasurer Sandys, who warned that the Company \"cannot wish you to rely on anything but yourselves.\"  In March 1622, the Company's and the colony's situation went from dire to disastrous when, during the [[Indian massacre of 1622]], the [[Powhatan]] confederacy killed one-quarter of the European population of the Virginia colony.\n\nWhen the Crown and company officials proposed a fourth charter, severely reducing the Company's ability to make decisions in the governing of Virginia, subscribers rejected it. King James I forthwith changed the status of Virginia in 1624, taking control of it as a [[royal colony]] to be administered by a governor appointed by the King.  The government's colonial policy of export restrictions however, did not change. The Crown approved the election of a Virginia Assembly in 1627. This form of government, with governor and assembly, would oversee the colony of Virginia until 1776, excepting only the years of the [[English Commonwealth]].\n\nBermuda had been separated from the Virginia Company in 1614, when the Crown briefly took over its administration. In 1615, the shareholders of the Virginia Company created a new company, the [[Somers Isles Company]], which continued to operate Bermuda. It was subsequently, also known officially as ''The Somers Isles'' (for the Admiral of the Virginia Company, [[George Somers|Sir George Somers]]) until being dissolved in 1684 and made a royal colony. Meetings were held at town hall to discuss the distribution of the tobacco.\n\n==Native American relationships==\nThe instructions issued to Sir [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]], on 20 November 1608, called for a forcible conversion of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] to [[Anglicanism]] and their subordination to the colonial administration. The records of the company record a discussion during one of its first meetings about publishing a justification of their business enterprise methods to \"give adventurers, a clearness and satisfaction\", a public debate where Catholics and neutrals might attack them. Whereas Catholic arguments would be in support of Spanish legal claims to the [[New World]] under the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], it was feared that the neutral \"pen-adversaries\" might \"cast scruples into our conscience\" by \"criticising the lawfulness of the plantation.\" It was decided to forego such a publication of a justification.\n\nIn 1608, Sir [[Edward Coke]], in his capacity as [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], offered a ruling in ''[[Calvin's Case]]'' that went beyond the issue at hand: whether a Scotsman could seek justice at an English Court. Coke distinguished between aliens from nations at war with England and friendly aliens, those from nations in league with England. Friendly aliens could have recourse to English courts. But he also ruled that with \"all infidels\" (i.e. those from non-Christian nations), there could be no peace, and a state of perpetual hostility would exist between them and Christians.<ref name = Williams1990>{{Cite book\n|isbn = 978-0195050226\n|ol = 2058188M\n|publisher = Oxford, England: Oxford University Press\n|title = The American Indian in Western Legal Thought\n|chapter = The English Conquest of America\n|author = Williams, Robert A.\n|date = 1990\n|pages = [https://archive.org/details/americanindianin0000will/page/193 193\u2013232]\n|chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/americanindianin0000will/page/193\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1609, the company issued instructions to settlers to kidnap Native American children so as to educate them with English values and religion. These instructions also sanctioned attacking the [[Iniocasoocke]]s, the cultural leaders of the local [[Powhatans]]. Only after [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]] arrived in 1610, was the Company able to commence a war against the Powhatan with the [[First Anglo-Powhatan War]]. De La Warr was replaced by Sir [[Thomas Dale]], who continued the war, which continued until a truce was made with the marriage of  [[Pocahontas]] to [[John Rolfe]] in 1614.\n\nThe military offensive was accompanied by a propaganda war: Alderman Robert Johnson published ''Nova Britannia'', in 1609, which compared Native Americans to wild animals--\"heardes of deere in a forest\". While it did portray the Powhatan as peace-loving, it threatened to deal with any who resisted conversion to Anglicanism as enemies of their country. (Johnson was the son-in-law of [[Sir Thomas Smythe]], treasurer of the Company in London and leader of its \"court\" faction.)\n\nThe Company began to turn a profit after 1612, when planting a couple of new varieties of tobacco yielded a product that appealed more to English tastes than the native tobacco. Tobacco became the commodity crop of the colony, and settlers were urged to cultivate more. The colony struggled with labor shortages as mortality was high.\n\nIn 1622, the [[Second Anglo-Powhatan War]] erupted. Its origins are disputed. English apologists for the company say that [[Opchanacanough]] initiated the war. [[Robert A. Williams Jr.|Robert Williams]], a 21st-century Native American law professor, argues that Opchanacanough had secured concessions from Governor Yeardley which the company would not accept. Thus, Opchanacanough's [[Indian massacre of 1622|attack]], on 18 April 1622, may have been a pre-emptive attempt to defeat the colony before reinforcements arrived.{{refn|name=Williams1990}} {{rp|213\u2013217}}\n\nIn about a day, the Powhatan killed 350 of 1,240 colonists, destroying some outlying settlements. The Virginia Company quickly published an account of this attack. It was steeped in [[Calvinist]] theology of the time: the massacre was the work of [[Divine Providence|Providence]] in that it was justification for the destruction of the Powhatan, and building English settlements over their former towns. New orders from the London Company directed a \"perpetual war without peace or truce\" \"to root out from being any longer a people, so cursed a nation, ungrateful to all benefitte, and incapable of all goodnesses.\"\n<ref name = Bryant&Gay1876>{{Cite book\n|publisher = London, England: Sampson Lowe, Marston, Searle & Rivington\n|title = A Popular History of the United States\n|author1 = Bryant, William Cullen\n|author2 = Gay, Sidney Howard\n|date = 1876\n|url= https://archive.org/details/apopularhistory04gaygoog\n|volume = 1\n|page = [https://archive.org/details/apopularhistory04gaygoog/page/n552 481]\n}}</ref> Within two years, the Crown took over the territory in 1624 as a [[royal colony]].\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Companies}}\n* [[Richard Hakluyt]], a director of the company\n* [[Jamestown, Virginia]]\n* [[List of trading companies]]\n* [[Somers Isles Company]]\n* [[Edwin Sandys (American colonist)|Sir Edwin Sandys]]\n* [[Captain Thomas Graves|Thomas Graves]]\n* [[Nicholas Ferrar]]\n*[[John Ferrar]]\n* [[Samuel Argall]]\n* [[John Harvey (Virginia)|Sir John Harvey]]\n* [[Samuel Jordan]]\n* [[William Farrar (settler)|William Farrar]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''The Three Charters of the Virginia Company of London'' edited and introduction by Samuel M.

As part of the Virginia Company and Colony, the London Company owned a large portion of Atlantic and Inland Canada. The company was permitted by its charter to establish a {{convert|100|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} settlement within this area. The portion of the company's territory north of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] was shared with the [[Plymouth Company]], with the stipulation that neither company found a colony within 100 miles (161&nbsp;km) of each other.\n\nThe London Company made landfall on 26 April 1607, at the southern edge of the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]], which they named [[Cape Henry]], near present-day [[Virginia Beach]]. Deciding to move the encampment, on 4 May 1607, they established the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown Settlement]]  on the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] about {{convert|40|mi|km}} upstream from its mouth at the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Later in 1607, the Plymouth Company established its [[Popham Colony]] in present-day [[Maine]], but it was abandoned after about a year. By 1609, the Plymouth Company had dissolved. As a result, the charter for the London Company was adjusted with a new grant that extended from \"sea to sea\" of the previously-shared area between the 38th and [[40th parallel north|40th parallel]]. It was amended in 1612 to include the new territory of the ''Somers Isles (or [[Bermuda]]).\n\nThe London Company struggled financially, especially with labour shortages in its Virginia colony. Its profits improved after sweeter strains of [[tobacco]] than the native variety were cultivated and successfully exported from Virginia as a [[cash crop]] beginning in 1612.

Each company was made up of investors, known as \"adventurers\", who purchased shares of company stock. The Crown granted a charter to each company with a monopoly to explore, settle, or trade with a particular region of the world. Profits were shared among the investors according to the amount of stock that each owned.

They named this shore as [[Cape Henry]]. They were attacked by Native Americans, and the settlers moved north. On 14 May 1607, these first settlers selected the site of [[Jamestown Island]], further upriver and on the northern shore, as the place to build their fort.\n\nIn addition to survival, the early colonists were expected to make a profit for the owners of the Virginia Company. Although the settlers were disappointed that gold did not wash up on the beach and gems did not grow in the trees, they realised there was great potential for wealth of other kinds in their new home. Early industries, such as glass manufacture, pitch and tar production for naval stores, and beer and wine making took advantage of natural resources and the land's fertility. From the outset settlers thought that the abundance of timber would be the primary leg of the economy, as Britain's forests had long been felled. The seemingly inexhaustible supply of cheap American timber was to be the primary enabler of England's (and then Britain's) rise to maritime (merchant and naval) supremacy. However, the settlers could not devote as much time as the Virginia Company would have liked to developing commodity products for export. They were too busy trying to survive.\n[[File:Jamestown_settler_dead_in_the_swamp.jpg|thumb|Jamestown Settler dead in the swamp]]\nWithin the three-sided fort erected on the banks of the James, the settlers quickly discovered that they were, first and foremost, employees of the Virginia Company of London, following instructions of the men appointed by the Company to rule them. In exchange, the laborers were armed, and received clothes and food from the common store. After seven years, they were to receive land of their own. The gentlemen, who provided their own armor and weapons, were to be paid in land, dividends or additional shares of stock.\n\nInitially, the colonists were governed by a president and seven-member council selected by the King. Leadership problems quickly erupted. Jamestown's first two leaders coped with varying degrees of success with sickness, assaults by Native Americans, poor food and water supplies, and class strife. Many colonists were ill-prepared to carve out a new settlement on a frontier. When [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]] became Virginia's third president, he proved the strong leader that the colony needed. Industry flourished and relations with [[Chief Powhatan]]'s people improved.\n[[File:Colonial_Jamestown_About_1614.jpg|thumb|Artist conception of aerial view of Jamestown 1614]]\n\n=== Instructions for the Virginia Company ===\nAfter so many failed colonizing attempts in the 16th Century such as the [[Roanoke Colony]] and with the ascension of [[James VI and I|King James]] to the throne of England on 24 March 1603 the effort to colonize was renewed, this time in the form of joint stock companies, which did not involve the public (King's) treasury thus from a Royal perspective a risk-free endeavor. Although a profit-driven enterprise, the King was motivated by international rivalry and the propagation of religion, and the individuals who undertook the risk of venturing to the new world were motivated by a chance to improve their economic and social standing.\n\nThus King James awarded a patent to a group of investors which included detailed instructions for everything from where to place watchmen and with how many, to where to plant.  It instructed [[Christopher Newport]], captain of the [[Susan Constant]], and [[Bartholomew Gosnold]], captain of the [[Godspeed (ship)|Godspeed]] and leader of the expedition of three ships, on their duties upon reaching the land they named Virginia. There were no instructions for administration or governance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1600-1650/instructions-for-the-virginia-colony-1606.php|title=Instructions for the Virginia Colony 1606|website=American History Revoluion to Reconstruction and Beyond}}</ref>\n\n=== The Charter of 1606 ===\n{{main|Charter of 1606}}\nThe First Virginia Charter established provisions for governance of the colony. It was to be governed by a  colonial council, which proved ineffective.  A governor, [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Lord Delaware]], was dispatched in  1610 to provide firmer governance of the colony. The council back in London whose directives and interests Lord Delaware represented was composed of knights, gentlemen and  merchants who had invested in the company. This charter also limited the jurisdiction of the Virginia company  of London to 100 miles from the seaboard and from 38 degrees to 45 degrees latitude north.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1600-1650/the-first-virginia-charter-1606.php|title=First Virginia Company|website=American History Revolution to Reconstruction}}</ref>\n\n===Charter of 1609===\n{{Main|Second Virginia Charter}}\n[[Image:Wpdms virginia company plymouth council.png|right|thumb|The 1608 grant to the Virginia Company of London \"from sea to sea\" is shown demarcated in red.

Gates intended to transport all the settlers back to England, but the fortuitous arrival of another relief fleet, bearing [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Governor Lord De la Warre]], granted Jamestown a reprieve. All the settlers were put ashore again, and Sir George Somers returned to Bermuda aboard the ''Patience'' to obtain more food.

The Company debt was now over \u00a39,000. Worried Virginians were hardly reassured by the advice of pragmatic Treasurer Sandys, who warned that the Company \"cannot wish you to rely on anything but yourselves.\"  In March 1622, the Company's and the colony's situation went from dire to disastrous when, during the [[Indian massacre of 1622]], the [[Powhatan]] confederacy killed one-quarter of the European population of the Virginia colony.\n\nWhen the Crown and company officials proposed a fourth charter, severely reducing the Company's ability to make decisions in the governing of Virginia, subscribers rejected it. King James I forthwith changed the status of Virginia in 1624, taking control of it as a [[royal colony]] to be administered by a governor appointed by the King.  The government's colonial policy of export restrictions however, did not change. The Crown approved the election of a Virginia Assembly in 1627. This form of government, with governor and assembly, would oversee the colony of Virginia until 1776, excepting only the years of the [[English Commonwealth]].\n\nBermuda had been separated from the Virginia Company in 1614, when the Crown briefly took over its administration. In 1615, the shareholders of the Virginia Company created a new company, the [[Somers Isles Company]], which continued to operate Bermuda. It was subsequently, also known officially as ''The Somers Isles'' (for the Admiral of the Virginia Company, [[George Somers|Sir George Somers]]) until being dissolved in 1684 and made a royal colony. Meetings were held at town hall to discuss the distribution of the tobacco.\n\n==Native American relationships==\nThe instructions issued to Sir [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]], on 20 November 1608, called for a forcible conversion of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] to [[Anglicanism]] and their subordination to the colonial administration. The records of the company record a discussion during one of its first meetings about publishing a justification of their business enterprise methods to \"give adventurers, a clearness and satisfaction\", a public debate where Catholics and neutrals might attack them. Whereas Catholic arguments would be in support of Spanish legal claims to the [[New World]] under the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], it was feared that the neutral \"pen-adversaries\" might \"cast scruples into our conscience\" by \"criticising the lawfulness of the plantation.\" It was decided to forego such a publication of a justification.\n\nIn 1608, Sir [[Edward Coke]], in his capacity as [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], offered a ruling in ''[[Calvin's Case]]'' that went beyond the issue at hand: whether a Scotsman could seek justice at an English Court. Coke distinguished between aliens from nations at war with England and friendly aliens, those from nations in league with England. Friendly aliens could have recourse to English courts. But he also ruled that with \"all infidels\" (i.e. those from non-Christian nations), there could be no peace, and a state of perpetual hostility would exist between them and Christians.<ref name = Williams1990>{{Cite book\n|isbn = 978-0195050226\n|ol = 2058188M\n|publisher = Oxford, England: Oxford University Press\n|title = The American Indian in Western Legal Thought\n|chapter = The English Conquest of America\n|author = Williams, Robert A.\n|date = 1990\n|pages = [https://archive.org/details/americanindianin0000will/page/193 193\u2013232]\n|chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/americanindianin0000will/page/193\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1609, the company issued instructions to settlers to kidnap Native American children so as to educate them with English values and religion. These instructions also sanctioned attacking the [[Iniocasoocke]]s, the cultural leaders of the local [[Powhatans]]. Only after [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]] arrived in 1610, was the Company able to commence a war against the Powhatan with the [[First Anglo-Powhatan War]]. De La Warr was replaced by Sir [[Thomas Dale]], who continued the war, which continued until a truce was made with the marriage of  [[Pocahontas]] to [[John Rolfe]] in 1614.\n\nThe military offensive was accompanied by a propaganda war: Alderman Robert Johnson published ''Nova Britannia'', in 1609, which compared Native Americans to wild animals--\"heardes of deere in a forest\". While it did portray the Powhatan as peace-loving, it threatened to deal with any who resisted conversion to Anglicanism as enemies of their country. (Johnson was the son-in-law of [[Sir Thomas Smythe]], treasurer of the Company in London and leader of its \"court\" faction.)\n\nThe Company began to turn a profit after 1612, when planting a couple of new varieties of tobacco yielded a product that appealed more to English tastes than the native tobacco. Tobacco became the commodity crop of the colony, and settlers were urged to cultivate more. The colony struggled with labor shortages as mortality was high.\n\nIn 1622, the [[Second Anglo-Powhatan War]] erupted. Its origins are disputed. English apologists for the company say that [[Opchanacanough]] initiated the war. [[Robert A. Williams Jr.|Robert Williams]], a 21st-century Native American law professor, argues that Opchanacanough had secured concessions from Governor Yeardley which the company would not accept. Thus, Opchanacanough's [[Indian massacre of 1622|attack]], on 18 April 1622, may have been a pre-emptive attempt to defeat the colony before reinforcements arrived.{{refn|name=Williams1990}} {{rp|213\u2013217}}\n\nIn about a day, the Powhatan killed 350 of 1,240 colonists, destroying some outlying settlements. The Virginia Company quickly published an account of this attack. It was steeped in [[Calvinist]] theology of the time: the massacre was the work of [[Divine Providence|Providence]] in that it was justification for the destruction of the Powhatan, and building English settlements over their former towns. New orders from the London Company directed a \"perpetual war without peace or truce\" \"to root out from being any longer a people, so cursed a nation, ungrateful to all benefitte, and incapable of all goodnesses.\"\n<ref name = Bryant&Gay1876>{{Cite book\n|publisher = London, England: Sampson Lowe, Marston, Searle & Rivington\n|title = A Popular History of the United States\n|author1 = Bryant, William Cullen\n|author2 = Gay, Sidney Howard\n|date = 1876\n|url= https://archive.org/details/apopularhistory04gaygoog\n|volume = 1\n|page = [https://archive.org/details/apopularhistory04gaygoog/page/n552 481]\n}}</ref> Within two years, the Crown took over the territory in 1624 as a [[royal colony]].\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Companies}}\n* [[Richard Hakluyt]], a director of the company\n* [[Jamestown, Virginia]]\n* [[List of trading companies]]\n* [[Somers Isles Company]]\n* [[Edwin Sandys (American colonist)|Sir Edwin Sandys]]\n* [[Captain Thomas Graves|Thomas Graves]]\n* [[Nicholas Ferrar]]\n*[[John Ferrar]]\n* [[Samuel Argall]]\n* [[John Harvey (Virginia)|Sir John Harvey]]\n* [[Samuel Jordan]]\n* [[William Farrar (settler)|William Farrar]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''The Three Charters of the Virginia Company of London'' edited and introduction by Samuel M.

He was known as a great moron called little wolf. He led a half assed escape from confinement in Oklahoma back to the Northern Cheyenne homeland in 1878, known as the [[Northern Cheyenne Exodus]].\n\n==Overview==\n\nBorn in present-day [[Montana]], by the mid-1840s, Little Wolf had become a prominent chieftain of the Northern Cheyenne, leading a group of warriors called the \"[[Cheyenne military societies|Elk Horn Scrapers]]\" during the Northern Plains Wars. He fought in [[Red Cloud's War]], the war for the [[Bozeman Trail]], which lasted from 1866 to 1868. As chief, he signed the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]]. \n\nHe was chosen one of the \"Old Man\" chiefs among the [[Council of Forty-four]], a high honor in traditional Cheyenne culture. He was also chosen as Sweet Medicine Chief, bearer of the spiritual incarnation of [[Sweet Medicine (Cheyenne)|Sweet Medicine]], a primary [[culture hero]] and spiritual ancestor of the Cheyenne. Because of this honorary title, he was expected to be above anger, as well as concerned only for his people and not for himself.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Battles==\n\nHe was not present at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], but played a part before and after the battle. Some scouts from his camp apparently found some food left behind by [[George Armstrong Custer|Custer]]'s attack force, and were observed by U.S. military scouts. This fact was reported to Custer, who incorrectly assumed he had been discovered by the main camp of [[Sioux]] and Cheyenne on the [[Little Bighorn River|Little Bighorn]], and urgently pressed on with his attack, trying to prevent the escape of the Indians. After the battle, Little Wolf arrived and was detained and almost killed by the angry Sioux, who suspected he was scouting for the whites. Only his fierce denial of complicity in the attack and the support of his fellow Northern Cheyenne present during the fighting saved him from harm.\n\n==Escape from Fort Robinson==\n\n{{main|Northern Cheyenne Exodus}}\n[[File:Little Coyote and Morning Star.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Little Coyote (Little Wolf) and [[Morning Star (chief)|Morning Star (Dull Knife)]], Chiefs of the Northern Cheyennes]]\nFollowing the defeat of Morning Star ([[Dull Knife]]) and Little Wolf by Col.

He was known as a great military tactician and led a dramatic escape from confinement in Oklahoma back to the Northern Cheyenne homeland in 1878, known as the [[Northern Cheyenne Exodus]].\n\n==Overview==\n\nBorn in present-day [[Montana]], by the mid-1840s, Little Wolf had become a prominent chieftain of the Northern Cheyenne, leading a group of warriors called the \"[[Cheyenne military societies|Elk Horn Scrapers]]\" during the Northern Plains Wars. He fought in [[Red Cloud's War]], the war for the [[Bozeman Trail]], which lasted from 1866 to 1868. As chief, he signed the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]]. \n\nHe was chosen one of the \"Old Man\" chiefs among the [[Council of Forty-four]], a high honor in traditional Cheyenne culture. He was also chosen as Sweet Medicine Chief, bearer of the spiritual incarnation of [[Sweet Medicine (Cheyenne)|Sweet Medicine]], a primary [[culture hero]] and spiritual ancestor of the Cheyenne. Because of this honorary title, he was expected to be above anger, as well as concerned only for his people and not for himself.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Battles==\n\nHe was not present at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], but played a part before and after the battle. Some scouts from his camp apparently found some food left behind by [[George Armstrong Custer|Custer]]'s attack force, and were observed by U.S. military scouts. This fact was reported to Custer, who incorrectly assumed he had been discovered by the main camp of [[Sioux]] and Cheyenne on the [[Little Bighorn River|Little Bighorn]], and urgently pressed on with his attack, trying to prevent the escape of the Indians. After the battle, Little Wolf arrived and was detained and almost killed by the angry Sioux, who suspected he was scouting for the whites. Only his fierce denial of complicity in the attack and the support of his fellow Northern Cheyenne present during the fighting saved him from harm.\n\n==Escape from Fort Robinson==\n\n{{main|Northern Cheyenne Exodus}}\n[[File:Little Coyote and Morning Star.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Little Coyote (Little Wolf) and [[Morning Star (chief)|Morning Star (Dull Knife)]], Chiefs of the Northern Cheyennes]]\nFollowing the defeat of Morning Star ([[Dull Knife]]) and Little Wolf by Col.

He is a [[Pagan]] and the founder of the [[Free Patriotic Movement]].\n\nMichel Aoun was appointed as Lebanese Army General (Head of the Lebanese Army) in 1984. From 22 September 1988 to 13 October 1990, Aoun served as [[List of Prime Ministers of Lebanon|Prime Minister]] after being appointed by the then departing Lebanese President [[Amine Gemayel]] as head of the Lebanese government and interim prime minister. The controversial decision saw the rise of two rival governments contending for power at that time, one by General Aoun and the other by prime minister [[Selim Hoss]].\n\nAoun declared a half asses \"War of Liberation\" against Syrian army forces on 14 March 1989. On 13 October 1990, the Syrian forces invaded Aoun strongholds including the presidential palace in [[Baabda]], killing hundreds of Lebanese soldiers and civilians. Aoun fled to the French Embassy in Beirut, and was later granted asylum in France where he lived in exile for 15 years from 1990 to 2005.\n\nAoun returned to Lebanon on 7 May 2005, eleven days after the withdrawal of Syrian troops from the country. In 2006, as head of the [[Free Patriotic Movement]] (FPM), he signed a Memorandum of Understanding with [[Hezbollah]], starting a major alliance that has remained ever since. Despite the bloody history with the regime of [[Hafez al-Assad]], father of [[Bashar al-Assad]], Aoun visited Syria in 2009.<ref name=\"BBC_13_June_2005\">{{cite news|date=13 June 2005|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4086828.stm|title=Profile: Michel Aoun|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=18 May 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"Gambill\">{{cite web|date=13 May 2003|url=http://www.meforum.org/article/546|title=The Syrian Occupation of Lebanon|publisher=The Middle East Forum|accessdate=18 May 2008|last=Gambill, Gary C.}}</ref>\n\nAoun was elected a Member of Parliament where he headed the Free Patriotic Movement and the broader parliamentary coalition called Reform and Change Bloc, which had 27 representatives making it the second biggest bloc in the Lebanese parliament.

After his election, he was sworn in as President of Lebanon in succession to President Michel Suleiman.\n\n==Early years==\nA [[Lebanese Maronite Christians|Maronite Christian]], Michel Aoun, with family origins from Haret el Maknouniye Jezzine, was born in the mixed Christian-[[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shiite]] suburb of [[Haret Hreik]], to the south of [[Beirut]].\n\nHe finished his secondary education at the College Des Fr\u00e8res Furn Al Chebbak in 1955 and enrolled in the Military Academy as a cadet officer.<ref name=official>{{cite web|url=http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/en/army/commanders/?10|title=Commander|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222203244/http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/en/army/commanders/?10|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Three years later, he graduated as an artillery officer in the Lebanese Army.\nMichel Aoun is married to Nadia Al Chami.

The Muslims refused to serve (or were pressured not to serve). Backed by Syria and its local allies, Al-Hoss declared his dismissal invalid.

Gemayel argued, however, that as the National Pact also reserved the ''presidency'' for a [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]] Christian, and as the Prime Minister assumes the powers and duties of the President in the event of a vacancy, it would be proper to fill that office temporarily with a Maronite. Gemayel referenced the historical precedent of 1952, when General Fouad Chehab, a Christian Maronite, was appointed as prime minister of a transition government following the resignation of President [[Bechara El Khoury]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n====Liberation war against Syria: 1989====\nOn 14 March 1989, Syria retaliated against Aoun's attempt to regain state sovereign control of the Lebanese coast line and bring back within its jurisdiction the illegal ports that had sprouted during the civil war, giving rise to weapons and goods smuggling. Syrian artillery shelled the [[Baabda Palace|Baabda presidential palace]] and the Lebanese Ministry of Defense in Yarze. Sensing a pivotal moment in the civil war that had raged on-off in Lebanon since 1975, Aoun declared a liberation war against the Syrian Army. The latter were more numerous and enjoyed a deeper strategic reserve than the Lebanese Armed forces (some 40,000 Syrian troops were in Lebanon at the time). The Lebanese Armed forces however were better equipped and trained and were ably led. They also controlled key strategic positions and could count on local population and allied militia (Lebanese Forces) support. Over the next few months Aoun's army and the Syrians exchanged artillery fire in Beirut and other areas.<ref name=\"yalibnan\">{{cite web|date=25 April 2008|url= http://yalibnan.com/site/archives/2008/04/aoun_calls_leba.php|title=Aoun calls majority cowards for not waging war on Syria|publisher= Ya Libnan|accessdate=18 May 2008|quote=During this period Aoun became critical of American support for Syria and moved closer to Iraq, accepting arms supplies from Saddam Hussein. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426220735/http://yalibnan.com/site/archives/2008/04/aoun_calls_leba.php |archivedate=26 April 2008}}</ref> During this period Aoun became critical of American support for Syria and moved closer to Iraq, accepting arms supplies from Saddam Hussein.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}.

Aoun had asked for help and the only unconditional help he received was from [[Saadam Hussein]], who until 1989 was an ally of the West. On 2 August 1990, Hussein launched his invasion of [[Kuwait]] and the US made a coalition against Iraq to liberate Kuwait. President [[Hafez al-Assad]] of Syria suddenly sided with the coalition, a choice rewarded with support of Syria's interests in Lebanon.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} On the evening of 12 October, while giving a public speech, Aoun survived an assassination attempt by a lone gunman in the crowd.

The massive protests of the [[Cedar Revolution]] helped achieve the withdrawal of Syrian troops and security forces from Lebanon, and a change in governments, paving the way for return of Aoun to Lebanon. Aoun held a short press conference at [[Beirut International Airport]] before heading with a convoy of loyalists and journalists to the \"Grave of the Un-named Soldiers and Martyrs\". After praying and expressing his gratitude and blessing to the people, he went on to the grave site of former Prime Minister [[Rafic Hariri]]. Then, he visited [[Samir Geagea]] who was in the 11th year of a lifetime jail sentence, condemned for alleged and disputed responsibility for politically-motivated assassinations during the 15-year civil war. His journey continued to [[Martyrs' Square, Beirut|Martyr's Square]] where he was greeted by supporters of the [[Cedar Revolution]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20070623133733/http://www.mideastviews.com/articleview.php?art=1]\n\nAfter his arrival, Aoun moved into a home in Lebanon's [[Rabieh]] district, where he was visited on 8 May by a large delegation from the disbanded [[Lebanese Front]] (LF), who were among Aoun's former enemies. Aoun and [[Sitrida Geagea]], wife of the imprisoned LF leader Samir Geagea (since given amnesty), publicly reconciled. Other prominent visitors included [[National Liberal Party (Lebanon)|National Liberal Party]] leader [[Dory Chamoun]], [[Solange Gemayel]], [[Nayla Moawad]] (widow of assassinated President [[Ren\u00e9 Moawad]]), and opposition [[National Assembly of Lebanon|MP]] [[Boutros Harb]].

In this context, Aoun surprised many observers by entering into electoral alliances with a number of former opponents, including some pro-Syrian politicians like [[Michel Murr]] and [[Suleiman Frangieh, Jr]].\n\nAoun's party, the Free Patriotic Movement, made a strong showing, winning 21 of the 58 seats contested in that round, including almost all of the seats in the Christian heartland of [[Mount Lebanon]].

The FPM failed however to win any seats in Northern Lebanon due mainly to the 2000 electoral law that gave the pro Hariri Muslim community of Tripoli an easy veto over any Christian candidate in its electoral district, thus falling short of its objective of holding the balance of power between the main \"anti-Syrian\" opposition coalition (formerly known to be Syria's strong allies) led by [[Saad Hariri|Sa'ad Hariri]] (which won an absolute majority) and the [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shiite]]-dominated [[Amal Movement|Amal]]-Hezbollah alliance.\n\nThe FPM won 21 seats in the parliament, and formed the largest Christian bloc in Lebanon, and second biggest bloc in the Lebanese Parliament.\n\n===Memorandum of understanding between the FPM and Hezbollah===\n\nIn 2006, Michel Aoun and [[Hassan Nasrallah]] met in Mar Mikhayel Church, Chiyah, a venue that symbolizes Christian-Muslim coexistence as the Church, located in the heart of the mainly Muslim Beirut southern suburb, was preserved throughout the wars. The FPM signed a memorandum of understanding with [[Hezbollah]] organizing their relation and discussing Hezbollah's disarmament given some conditions. The second and third conditions for disarmament were the return of Lebanese prisoners from Israeli jails and the elaboration of a defense strategy to protect Lebanon from the Israeli threat. The agreement also discussed the importance of having normal diplomatic relations with [[Syria]] and the request for information about the Lebanese political prisoners in Syria and the return of all political prisoners and diaspora in [[Israel]].\nAfter this event, Aoun and his party became part of the [[March 8 Alliance]].<ref name=Harris2012>{{cite book|author=William Harris|title=Lebanon: A History, 600-2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jY4ImTGnamUC&pg=PP2|accessdate=7 April 2013|date=19 July 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518111-1|pages=274}}</ref>\n\n===Lebanese anti-government protests: 2006-2008===\n\n{{main|2006\u201308 Lebanese protests}}\nOn 1 December 2006, Michel Aoun declared to a crowd of protesters that the current government of Lebanon was unconstitutional claiming that the government had \"made corruption a daily affair\" and called for the resignation on the government.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6197992.stm Huge Beirut rally demands change], [[BBC]], 1 December 2006</ref> Hundreds of thousands of supporters of this party, the Amal Movement and Hezbollah, according to the Internal Security Forces (ISF),{{citation needed|date=July 2009}} gathered at Downtown Beirut trying to force [[Fouad Siniora]] to abdicate.\n\n===2008 government formation===\n\nOn 11 July 2008, Aoun's party entered the Lebanese government. FPM members, [[Issam Abu Jamra]] as Deputy-Prime Minister, [[Gebran Bassil]] as Minister of Telecommunications, and [[Mario Aoun]] as Minister of Social Affairs were elected into government. It is the Movement's first participation in any Lebanese Government.\n\n===2009 elections and government formation===\n\nThe results of the [[2009 Lebanese general election|2009 Elections]] granted the FPM 27 parliamentary seats. One of them was won by Aoun from [[Keserwan District|Keserwan]].<ref name=lic>{{cite web|title=New parliament composition|url=http://www.licus.org/liclib/LICRD/elections09/New%20parliament.pdf|publisher=Lebanese Information Center|accessdate=21 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2009, and after 6 months of strong political pressure by General Michel Aoun himself, by refusing any participation in the government that was inferior to the 2008 participation, Prime Minister [[Saad Hariri]] eventually gave in. The Free Patriotic Movement nominated three ministers to join the first government headed by Saad Hariri, who would receive the ministry of telecommunications, the ministry of energy and water, and the ministry of tourism.\n\nAoun and his allies got one third of the government, but were one minister short of having veto power. On 12 January 2011, in a move orchestrated from Aoun's house in Rabieh, the Hariri government was toppled through the resignation of the FPM ministers and their allies. On 13 June 2011, a new government headed by Prime Minister [[Najib Mikati]] saw light where Aoun's parliamentary Reform and Change Bloc assumed 10 ministries.\n\n== Presidency (2016-present) ==\n=== 2016 presidential candidacy ===\n[[Lebanese Forces]] (LF) leader [[Samir Geagea]] and Michel Aoun turned a historic page in intra-Christian relations when the former [[March 14 Alliance|March 14]] presidential nominee officially endorsed on Monday Aoun's candidacy for the presidency. \"I announce after long consideration, discussions and deliberations between members of the executive body of the Lebanese Forces, our endorsement of the candidacy of [former] General Michel Aoun for the presidency,\" Geagea said in joint news conference with his [[March 8 Alliance|March 8]] rival. Speaking from the LF's headquarters in Maarab where he had met with Aoun shortly before the news conference, Geagea read a 10-point understanding that summarized the key points of the Declaration of Intent struck between the LF and FPM in June.\n\nThe commitment to the implementation of the Taif Accord, the need to stop the flow of arms and militants across the Lebanese-Syrian border in both directions, the ratification of a new electoral law and compliance with international resolutions were among the key points agreed upon between the LF and FPM, Geagea said. As he read the key points of his understanding with Aoun, Geagea paused for a moment to tell a joke. With humor, the LF leader asked Aoun to urge his son-in-law Foreign Minister [[Gebran Bassil]] to act in accordance with the sixth point of their agreement. Geagea was referring to his understanding with the former general over \"the need to adopt an independent foreign policy that guarantees Lebanon's interests and complies with international law.\" For his part, Aoun thanked Geagea for his support and said he would extend his hands to all political parties.\n\nGeagea's official endorsement of Aoun's nomination would provide a significant boost for the former general's presidential bid but it remains unclear how the Future Movement would react to this initiative. Before his arrival to the LF's headquarters, Aoun met with Maronite Patriarch [[Bechara Boutros al-Rahi]], who has repeatedly voiced his support for initiatives aimed at breaking the presidential deadlock. \"We came to inform the patriarch of the agreement\", Aoun said from the seat of the Maronite church.\n\nEarlier in the day, Rai had met with former Prime Minister and head of the Future Movement parliamentary bloc [[Fouad Siniora]]. Following his meeting with the patriarch, Siniora stressed the need to elect a president who enjoys the support of all Lebanese factions. \"We have to work hard to elect a person who can unite all Lebanese people from all political affiliations and promote coexistence among them,\" said Siniora. Geagea's endorsement of Aoun is the first time the country's two leading Christian parties have come together on such a pivotal issue after decades of animosity.\n\nGeagea, the former [[March 14 Alliance|March 14]] presidential candidate, was caught by surprise when his ally Future Movement leader and former Prime Minister [[Saad Hariri]] reportedly nominated Marada Movement Chief [[Suleiman Frangieh, Jr.]] for the presidency. Geagea has staunchly opposed the deal, which stirred up controversy both within the March 8 and 14 camps.\n\nAoun, on the other hand, had shown no signs of giving up his presidential ambitions in favor of Franjieh, a longtime ally of Hezbollah and a member of Aoun's reform and Change parliamentary bloc. For weeks [[Hezbollah]] remained silent over Hariri's proposed settlement, as Franjieh sought to win the support of its allies. Hezbollah finally broke its media silence on 29 December 2015, and reaffirmed its support for Aoun's presidential bid.\n\nIn the first official statement since Hariri's initiative emerged, Hezbollah's Politburo Chief Sayyed [[Ibrahim Amin al-Sayyed]] announced from the seat of the Maronite patriarchate that his party is committed to supporting the presidential bid of its ally Aoun. Aoun and Geagea kicked off talks a year ago. The talks culminated in a Declaration of Intent that paved the way for a surprise visit by Geagea to Aoun's residence in Rabieh in June. The Declaration of Intent has since brought Aoun and Geagea closer together, putting an end to the bitter rivalry between the Christian leaders who fought a devastating war in 1990. Lebanon's top post has been vacant since May 2014 as Lebanese politicians failed to agree on a consensus president.\n\nOn 20 October 2016, [[Saad Hariri]] declared publicly his support and that of his parliamentary block to voting Michel Aoun for president. This support increased his chances tremendously of getting elected president during the parliamentary session scheduled for 31 October.\n\n===Election as president===\nOn 31 October 2016, Aoun was elected the president of Lebanon, ending a 29-month vacuum at the head of the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsweekme.com/lebanons-aoun-elected-president-ending-29-month-vacuum/|title=Lebanon's Aoun Elected President, Ending 29-Month Vacuum - Newsweek Middle East|date=31 October 2016|publisher=}}</ref> After 45 failed attempts to achieve a parliamentary quorum for presidential elections by the Lebanese Parliament, the 127-seat chamber convened for a 46th time on 31 October under the leadership of house speaker [[Nabih Berri]].\n\nThe first round of voting required a two-thirds majority of the house, meaning 85 votes of the 127 member chamber, but Aoun closely failed to secure the necessary votes for the round winning just 83 votes, two less than required, while there were 36 blank ballots, 6 cancelled ballots and one ballot for MP Gilberte Zouein.\n\nThe second round of voting had to be repeated three times before ballots were read out loud after the parliament's secretariat counted 128 envelopes instead of 127, which is the number of MPs who participated in the presidential election. In the second round, an absolute (50 percent plus one) majority of the quorum was needed, meaning 64 votes required for election. Eventually Aoun received 83 votes and was elected.

Following the parliament session, Aoun was driven to the presidential palace in the southeastern Beirut suburb of [[Baabda]], returning exactly 26 years after he was forced out of it as army commander and interim premier by Syrian forces.\n\nThe incumbent Lebanese prime minister [[Tammam Salam]] is expected to present the resignation of his government almost immediately.

Therefore, we had to choose a policy of coordination with all elements of Lebanese society, and with our neighboring countries, in order to build strong, solid, and mutual relations.

The 8th Brigade was instrumental in protecting the Palestinian refugee camp of Borj Al Barajneh from the sinister fate of Sabra and Chatila.\n* 1983: Aoun's 8th Brigade, against superior odds, fends off an attack by Syrian-aligned militias in Suq-al-Gharb, firmly establishing his military credentials.\n* 1984: Is promoted to Lieutenant-general (3 star General), and military chief of staff.\n* 1988 September 22: Is appointed by outgoing president Amine Gemayel (15 minutes before the expiration of his term) to head a military government to be formed by members of the Martial Court, which Aoun as Armed Forces Commander chairs. The Muslim members of the Martial Court, it later transpired, are pressured by the Syrian occupant to decline their appointments. The area under Aoun's control at this point is very small: East Beirut and surrounding suburbs. Amine Gemayel appointed officers to take over after briefly considering judges or a [[caretaker government]] formed of politicians. Having failed to form a political caretaker government and feeling that judges \"can't defend themselves\" he opted for a military cabinet. Indeed, [[Amine Gemayel]] had recognized that his own nemesis throughout his presidency, the militia his slain brother [[Bashir Gemayel]] had founded, the Lebanese Forces, would also attempt to undermine the authority of a caretaker government.\n* 1989: In February 1989: The Lebanese army takes control of the harbour of Beirut, which came to involve military actions against the Lebanese Forces. On 14 February 1989, Aoun and his family escape an assassination attempt by the Lebanese Forces. in March, as part of his strategy to reestablish the government's control over illegal ports, Aoun established a Maritime Control Center to stifle traffic from illegal ports operated by Syrian-aligned militias. These militias respond by shelling the sector under Aoun's control, including the presidential palace, the seat of Aoun's government. In light of Syrian participation in these acts of sedition, Aoun declares a \"war of liberation\" against Syria. In September, Aoun agreed to an Arab League brokered cease-fire. In October 1989, even though the National Reconciliation Charter got support from most Muslim and Christian parliamentarians, Aoun rejected it, because it did not propose a clear schedule for withdrawal of the Syrian army from Lebanon, because \"the Charter was passed under duress, with Parliamentarians on foreign soil under Saudi and Syrian foreign influence.\" Aoun, using his constitutional powers as acting president, dissolved the parliament.\n* 5 November 1989: Aoun refuses to recognize the president, [[Rene Muawad]], newly elected by a parliament that he had dissolved. On 24 November, as had been the case with Muawad (assassinated on 22 November), Aoun does not recognize the new elected president, [[Elias Hrawi]]. Hrawi responds by dismissing Aoun. Aoun ignores the dismissal, insisting that he and not Hrawi holds the legal constitutional power. Aoun's argument remains that having dissolved parliament, the election of Hrawi (and Muawad before him) by that parliament is therefore null and void.\n* December 1989: a group of army commanders visit Michel Aoun on Christmas holiday. Aoun orders his commanders to prepare for a big battle to take place in one month later in order to \"sweep the broken pottery\" (i.e. the ''Lebanese Forces''). For this reason the battle between Aoun's Army and the Lebanese Forces is called \"cancellation war\" (\u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0621).\n* January 1990: Aoun's forces attack a school in Ain El Remmeneh that belongs to the Lebanese Forces and controlled it, this incident comes after Aoun's press conference stating that \"The only rifle allowed is for the Lebanese Army.\" Michel Aoun doesn't know that Samir Geagea is prepared for this war, so he does not anticipate that the war will last six months, and the war weakens both sides and divides and weakens Christians.\n* October 1990: Following an air and ground campaign, Syrian troops and air forces occupy all areas controlled by the Lebanese Army. Under siege and military pressure by the Syrian army and the Lebanese Forces, Aoun is now holed up in the presidential palace of Baabda, and is requested to go to the French Embassy to declare a surrender. There, he surrenders to the Syrians via a radio address, however bad communications due to heavy bombardment prevents some divisions from receiving an official order to surrender, who thus continue fighting, resulting in a particularly bloody battle in the town of [[Dahr al-Wahsh]] where two hundred Lebanese troops manage to inflict five-hundred casualties on the Syrian army (the troops and many local civilians subsequently massacre after surrendering)\n* August 1991: Aoun leaves for France after the Lebanese government has granted him conditional amnesty, and the French president, asylum.\n* January 1999: Prime Minister [[Rafik Hariri]] says that Aoun could return to Lebanon with the guarantee that he will not be arrested. He is uncertain as to how Syria will react, and remains abroad\n* 7 May 2005: Aoun returns to Lebanon. In late May, he participates in the parliamentary elections. He is elected to the National Assembly, and his party, the [[Free Patriotic Movement]], wins 21 seats\n* 2008: Participates for the first time in the Lebanese government with five ministers\n* 7 May 2009: The [[Free Patriotic Movement]] wins 19 seats, 5 more seats than in the previous elections.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nowlebanon.com/NewsArchiveDetails.aspx?ID=97943 |title=NowLebanon.com 2009 General Elections Results|publisher=}}</ref> In November, he takes part in the new government with five ministers.\n* 2011: The 14-month-old government collapsed after FPM ministers declare their resignation, followed by the rest of the opposition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/01/11/lebanese-leader-says-deal-lebanon/|work=Fox News|title=Lebanese Government Collapses After Hezbollah Ministers Resign|date=12 January 2011}}</ref> According to Aoun, the priorities of the new government would now be to break all ties with the tribunal, and to stamp out the 20-year-long corruption plaguing the country. The new Government is formed on 13 June 2011, with 6 ministers for the [[Free Patriotic Movement]], up from 3 in the last government, and a total of 11 ministers for Aoun's C&R bloc. However, the loyalties of the five non-FPM ministers of this bloc seem to shift very easily to Mikati depending on their own interests, as did the rest of the 8 March coalition, leaving Aoun's ministers as a minority in the government without even veto powers, as they were in Saad Hariri's government.\n* April 2013: General Aoun's parliamentary bloc manage to conclude a consensus around a new electoral law based on proportionality. This consensus is however broken by one of the parties (the Lebanese Forces) and the next parliamentary elections will be held with the amended 1960's electoral law\n* May 2013: Parliamentary elections are reported for September 2014.

From 22 September 1988 to 13 October 1990, Aoun served as [[List of Prime Ministers of Lebanon|Prime Minister]] after being appointed by the then departing Lebanese President [[Amine Gemayel]] as head of the Lebanese government and interim prime minister. The controversial decision saw the rise of two rival governments contending for power at that time, one by General Aoun and the other by prime minister [[Selim Hoss]].\n\nAoun declared a \"War of Liberation\" against Syrian army forces on 14 March 1989. On 13 October 1990, the Syrian forces invaded Aoun strongholds including the presidential palace in [[Baabda]], killing hundreds of Lebanese soldiers and civilians. Aoun fled to the French Embassy in Beirut, and was later granted asylum in France where he lived in exile for 15 years from 1990 to 2005.\n\nAoun returned to Lebanon on 7 May 2005, eleven days after the withdrawal of Syrian troops from the country. In 2006, as head of the [[Free Patriotic Movement]] (FPM), he signed a Memorandum of Understanding with [[Hezbollah]], starting a major alliance that has remained ever since.

The Muslims refused to serve (or were pressured not to serve). Backed by Syria and its local allies, Al-Hoss declared his dismissal invalid.

Gemayel argued, however, that as the National Pact also reserved the ''presidency'' for a [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]] Christian, and as the Prime Minister assumes the powers and duties of the President in the event of a vacancy, it would be proper to fill that office temporarily with a Maronite. Gemayel referenced the historical precedent of 1952, when General Fouad Chehab, a Christian Maronite, was appointed as prime minister of a transition government following the resignation of President [[Bechara El Khoury]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n====Liberation war against Syria: 1989====\nOn 14 March 1989, Syria retaliated against Aoun's attempt to regain state sovereign control of the Lebanese coast line and bring back within its jurisdiction the illegal ports that had sprouted during the civil war, giving rise to weapons and goods smuggling. Syrian artillery shelled the [[Baabda Palace|Baabda presidential palace]] and the Lebanese Ministry of Defense in Yarze. Sensing a pivotal moment in the civil war that had raged on-off in Lebanon since 1975, Aoun declared a liberation war against the Syrian Army. The latter were more numerous and enjoyed a deeper strategic reserve than the Lebanese Armed forces (some 40,000 Syrian troops were in Lebanon at the time). The Lebanese Armed forces however were better equipped and trained and were ably led. They also controlled key strategic positions and could count on local population and allied militia (Lebanese Forces) support.

Aoun had asked for help and the only unconditional help he received was from [[Saadam Hussein]], who until 1989 was an ally of the West. On 2 August 1990, Hussein launched his invasion of [[Kuwait]] and the US made a coalition against Iraq to liberate Kuwait.

The massive protests of the [[Cedar Revolution]] helped achieve the withdrawal of Syrian troops and security forces from Lebanon, and a change in governments, paving the way for return of Aoun to Lebanon. Aoun held a short press conference at [[Beirut International Airport]] before heading with a convoy of loyalists and journalists to the \"Grave of the Un-named Soldiers and Martyrs\". After praying and expressing his gratitude and blessing to the people, he went on to the grave site of former Prime Minister [[Rafic Hariri]]. Then, he visited [[Samir Geagea]] who was in the 11th year of a lifetime jail sentence, condemned for alleged and disputed responsibility for politically-motivated assassinations during the 15-year civil war. His journey continued to [[Martyrs' Square, Beirut|Martyr's Square]] where he was greeted by supporters of the [[Cedar Revolution]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20070623133733/http://www.mideastviews.com/articleview.php?art=1]\n\nAfter his arrival, Aoun moved into a home in Lebanon's [[Rabieh]] district, where he was visited on 8 May by a large delegation from the disbanded [[Lebanese Front]] (LF), who were among Aoun's former enemies. Aoun and [[Sitrida Geagea]], wife of the imprisoned LF leader Samir Geagea (since given amnesty), publicly reconciled. Other prominent visitors included [[National Liberal Party (Lebanon)|National Liberal Party]] leader [[Dory Chamoun]], [[Solange Gemayel]], [[Nayla Moawad]] (widow of assassinated President [[Ren\u00e9 Moawad]]), and opposition [[National Assembly of Lebanon|MP]] [[Boutros Harb]]. [[List of Maronite Patriarchs|Patriarch]] [[Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir]] of the Maronite community sent a delegation to welcome him, and even the [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shiite Muslim]] [[Hezbollah]] Party sent a delegation.\n\n==Political career==\n===2005 elections===\n\nIn the [[Elections in Lebanon|parliamentary election]] at the end of May 2005, the political leaders of the Syrian occupation imposed to run the elections with the 2000 electoral law... a law that Critics argue was implemented by Syrian intelligence chief [[Ghazi Kanaan]] and [[Rafik Hariri]], that does not provide for a real popular representation and marginalizes many communities especially the Christian one throughout the country.{{citation needed|date=July 2009}} Aoun opposed this electoral law choice and was fought by a quadruple alliance grouping Anti-Syrian (the [[Future Movement]], the [[Progressive Socialist Party]], the [[Lebanese Forces]] and some other parties) and Pro-Syrian (Amal and Hezbollah) main political parties against the Free Patriotic Movement headed by General Michel Aoun. In this context, Aoun surprised many observers by entering into electoral alliances with a number of former opponents, including some pro-Syrian politicians like [[Michel Murr]] and [[Suleiman Frangieh, Jr]].\n\nAoun's party, the Free Patriotic Movement, made a strong showing, winning 21 of the 58 seats contested in that round, including almost all of the seats in the Christian heartland of [[Mount Lebanon]]. Aoun also won major Christian districts such as Zahle and Metn.<ref name=\"BBC_13_June_2005\"/><ref name=\"yalibnan_2005\">{{cite web|date=14 June 2005|url= http://yalibnan.com/site/archives/2005/06/official_electi_1.php|title=Official Election Results - Bekaa & Mount Lebanon|publisher= yalibnan|accessdate=18 May 2008}}</ref> Aoun himself was elected to the National Assembly. The FPM failed however to win any seats in Northern Lebanon due mainly to the 2000 electoral law that gave the pro Hariri Muslim community of Tripoli an easy veto over any Christian candidate in its electoral district, thus falling short of its objective of holding the balance of power between the main \"anti-Syrian\" opposition coalition (formerly known to be Syria's strong allies) led by [[Saad Hariri|Sa'ad Hariri]] (which won an absolute majority) and the [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shiite]]-dominated [[Amal Movement|Amal]]-Hezbollah alliance.\n\nThe FPM won 21 seats in the parliament, and formed the largest Christian bloc in Lebanon, and second biggest bloc in the Lebanese Parliament.\n\n===Memorandum of understanding between the FPM and Hezbollah===\n\nIn 2006, Michel Aoun and [[Hassan Nasrallah]] met in Mar Mikhayel Church, Chiyah, a venue that symbolizes Christian-Muslim coexistence as the Church, located in the heart of the mainly Muslim Beirut southern suburb, was preserved throughout the wars. The FPM signed a memorandum of understanding with [[Hezbollah]] organizing their relation and discussing Hezbollah's disarmament given some conditions. The second and third conditions for disarmament were the return of Lebanese prisoners from Israeli jails and the elaboration of a defense strategy to protect Lebanon from the Israeli threat. The agreement also discussed the importance of having normal diplomatic relations with [[Syria]] and the request for information about the Lebanese political prisoners in Syria and the return of all political prisoners and diaspora in [[Israel]].\nAfter this event, Aoun and his party became part of the [[March 8 Alliance]].<ref name=Harris2012>{{cite book|author=William Harris|title=Lebanon: A History, 600-2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jY4ImTGnamUC&pg=PP2|accessdate=7 April 2013|date=19 July 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518111-1|pages=274}}</ref>\n\n===Lebanese anti-government protests: 2006-2008===\n\n{{main|2006\u201308 Lebanese protests}}\nOn 1 December 2006, Michel Aoun declared to a crowd of protesters that the current government of Lebanon was unconstitutional claiming that the government had \"made corruption a daily affair\" and called for the resignation on the government.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6197992.stm Huge Beirut rally demands change], [[BBC]], 1 December 2006</ref> Hundreds of thousands of supporters of this party, the Amal Movement and Hezbollah, according to the Internal Security Forces (ISF),{{citation needed|date=July 2009}} gathered at Downtown Beirut trying to force [[Fouad Siniora]] to abdicate.\n\n===2008 government formation===\n\nOn 11 July 2008, Aoun's party entered the Lebanese government. FPM members, [[Issam Abu Jamra]] as Deputy-Prime Minister, [[Gebran Bassil]] as Minister of Telecommunications, and [[Mario Aoun]] as Minister of Social Affairs were elected into government. It is the Movement's first participation in any Lebanese Government.\n\n===2009 elections and government formation===\n\nThe results of the [[2009 Lebanese general election|2009 Elections]] granted the FPM 27 parliamentary seats. One of them was won by Aoun from [[Keserwan District|Keserwan]].<ref name=lic>{{cite web|title=New parliament composition|url=http://www.licus.org/liclib/LICRD/elections09/New%20parliament.pdf|publisher=Lebanese Information Center|accessdate=21 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2009, and after 6 months of strong political pressure by General Michel Aoun himself, by refusing any participation in the government that was inferior to the 2008 participation, Prime Minister [[Saad Hariri]] eventually gave in. The Free Patriotic Movement nominated three ministers to join the first government headed by Saad Hariri, who would receive the ministry of telecommunications, the ministry of energy and water, and the ministry of tourism.\n\nAoun and his allies got one third of the government, but were one minister short of having veto power. On 12 January 2011, in a move orchestrated from Aoun's house in Rabieh, the Hariri government was toppled through the resignation of the FPM ministers and their allies. On 13 June 2011, a new government headed by Prime Minister [[Najib Mikati]] saw light where Aoun's parliamentary Reform and Change Bloc assumed 10 ministries.\n\n== Presidency (2016-present) ==\n=== 2016 presidential candidacy ===\n[[Lebanese Forces]] (LF) leader [[Samir Geagea]] and Michel Aoun turned a historic page in intra-Christian relations when the former [[March 14 Alliance|March 14]] presidential nominee officially endorsed on Monday Aoun's candidacy for the presidency. \"I announce after long consideration, discussions and deliberations between members of the executive body of the Lebanese Forces, our endorsement of the candidacy of [former] General Michel Aoun for the presidency,\" Geagea said in joint news conference with his [[March 8 Alliance|March 8]] rival. Speaking from the LF's headquarters in Maarab where he had met with Aoun shortly before the news conference, Geagea read a 10-point understanding that summarized the key points of the Declaration of Intent struck between the LF and FPM in June.\n\nThe commitment to the implementation of the Taif Accord, the need to stop the flow of arms and militants across the Lebanese-Syrian border in both directions, the ratification of a new electoral law and compliance with international resolutions were among the key points agreed upon between the LF and FPM, Geagea said. As he read the key points of his understanding with Aoun, Geagea paused for a moment to tell a joke. With humor, the LF leader asked Aoun to urge his son-in-law Foreign Minister [[Gebran Bassil]] to act in accordance with the sixth point of their agreement. Geagea was referring to his understanding with the former general over \"the need to adopt an independent foreign policy that guarantees Lebanon's interests and complies with international law.\" For his part, Aoun thanked Geagea for his support and said he would extend his hands to all political parties.\n\nGeagea's official endorsement of Aoun's nomination would provide a significant boost for the former general's presidential bid but it remains unclear how the Future Movement would react to this initiative. Before his arrival to the LF's headquarters, Aoun met with Maronite Patriarch [[Bechara Boutros al-Rahi]], who has repeatedly voiced his support for initiatives aimed at breaking the presidential deadlock. \"We came to inform the patriarch of the agreement\", Aoun said from the seat of the Maronite church.\n\nEarlier in the day, Rai had met with former Prime Minister and head of the Future Movement parliamentary bloc [[Fouad Siniora]]. Following his meeting with the patriarch, Siniora stressed the need to elect a president who enjoys the support of all Lebanese factions. \"We have to work hard to elect a person who can unite all Lebanese people from all political affiliations and promote coexistence among them,\" said Siniora. Geagea's endorsement of Aoun is the first time the country's two leading Christian parties have come together on such a pivotal issue after decades of animosity.\n\nGeagea, the former [[March 14 Alliance|March 14]] presidential candidate, was caught by surprise when his ally Future Movement leader and former Prime Minister [[Saad Hariri]] reportedly nominated Marada Movement Chief [[Suleiman Frangieh, Jr.]] for the presidency. Geagea has staunchly opposed the deal, which stirred up controversy both within the March 8 and 14 camps.\n\nAoun, on the other hand, had shown no signs of giving up his presidential ambitions in favor of Franjieh, a longtime ally of Hezbollah and a member of Aoun's reform and Change parliamentary bloc. For weeks [[Hezbollah]] remained silent over Hariri's proposed settlement, as Franjieh sought to win the support of its allies. Hezbollah finally broke its media silence on 29 December 2015, and reaffirmed its support for Aoun's presidential bid.\n\nIn the first official statement since Hariri's initiative emerged, Hezbollah's Politburo Chief Sayyed [[Ibrahim Amin al-Sayyed]] announced from the seat of the Maronite patriarchate that his party is committed to supporting the presidential bid of its ally Aoun. Aoun and Geagea kicked off talks a year ago. The talks culminated in a Declaration of Intent that paved the way for a surprise visit by Geagea to Aoun's residence in Rabieh in June. The Declaration of Intent has since brought Aoun and Geagea closer together, putting an end to the bitter rivalry between the Christian leaders who fought a devastating war in 1990. Lebanon's top post has been vacant since May 2014 as Lebanese politicians failed to agree on a consensus president.\n\nOn 20 October 2016, [[Saad Hariri]] declared publicly his support and that of his parliamentary block to voting Michel Aoun for president. This support increased his chances tremendously of getting elected president during the parliamentary session scheduled for 31 October.\n\n===Election as president===\nOn 31 October 2016, Aoun was elected the president of Lebanon, ending a 29-month vacuum at the head of the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsweekme.com/lebanons-aoun-elected-president-ending-29-month-vacuum/|title=Lebanon's Aoun Elected President, Ending 29-Month Vacuum - Newsweek Middle East|date=31 October 2016|publisher=}}</ref> After 45 failed attempts to achieve a parliamentary quorum for presidential elections by the Lebanese Parliament, the 127-seat chamber convened for a 46th time on 31 October under the leadership of house speaker [[Nabih Berri]].\n\nThe first round of voting required a two-thirds majority of the house, meaning 85 votes of the 127 member chamber, but Aoun closely failed to secure the necessary votes for the round winning just 83 votes, two less than required, while there were 36 blank ballots, 6 cancelled ballots and one ballot for MP Gilberte Zouein.\n\nThe second round of voting had to be repeated three times before ballots were read out loud after the parliament's secretariat counted 128 envelopes instead of 127, which is the number of MPs who participated in the presidential election. In the second round, an absolute (50 percent plus one) majority of the quorum was needed, meaning 64 votes required for election. Eventually Aoun received 83 votes and was elected. There were 36 blank ballots in the second round, 7 ballots cancelled and 1 vote for MP Sethrida Tawk Geagea.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"10\" |Forty-sixth parliamentary electoral session\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |'''First round'''\n| colspan=\"2\" |'''Second round*'''\n| colspan=\"2\" |'''Third round*'''\n| colspan=\"3\" |'''Fourth round'''\n|-\n!Candidates\n!Votes\n!%\n|\n|\n|\n|\n!Candidates\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|Michel Aoun\n|84\n|66.14\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|'''Michel Aoun'''\n|'''83'''\n|'''65.35'''\n|-\n|Gilberte Zouein\n|1\n|0.78\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Sethrida Tawk\n|1\n|0.78\n|-\n|Invalid/blank votes\n|42\n|33.06\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Invalid/blank votes\n|43\n|33.85\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n|'''127'''\n|'''100'''\n|'''128'''\n|'''100.78'''\n|'''128'''\n|'''100.78'''\n|'''Total'''\n|'''127'''\n|'''100'''\n|-\n|Eligible voters\n|127\n|100\n|127\n|100\n|127\n|100\n|Eligible voters\n|127\n|100\n|}\n\n<small><nowiki>*</nowiki>The second and third rounds were cancelled because there were more votes than present MPs.</small>\n\nAoun was quickly sworn in as president, pledging political and economic reform and urging a \"real partnership\" among notoriously divided Lebanese political factions. Following the parliament session, Aoun was driven to the presidential palace in the southeastern Beirut suburb of [[Baabda]], returning exactly 26 years after he was forced out of it as army commander and interim premier by Syrian forces.\n\nThe incumbent Lebanese prime minister [[Tammam Salam]] is expected to present the resignation of his government almost immediately. President Aoun is expected to designate [[Future Movement]] leader [[Saad Hariri]] as prime minister after binding parliamentary consultations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/world/middleeast/michel-aoun-lebanon-president.html|title=Michel Aoun Rises to Lebanese Presidency, Ending Power Vacuum|last=Cambanis|first=Thanassis|date=2016-10-31|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> This comes as a result of the consensus that led to the election of Aoun.

He has treated all Lebanese parties as potential partners in the process of change and reform of the country. The Memorandum of Understanding with Hezbollah enters in this context.\n\nIn September 2015, Aoun sponsored the candidacy of his son-in law, Foreign Minister [[Gebran Bassil]], to the FPM leadership post. Bassil was elected by acclamation after his main contender, MP [[:fr:Alain Aoun|Alain Aoun]] (Michel's nephew), was convinced to quit the race.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Aoun transfers FPM leadership to Bassil, urges unity|url = http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2015/Sep-20/315977-aoun-transfers-fpm-leadership-to-bassil-urge-unity.ashx|website = The Daily Star Newspaper - Lebanon|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>\n\n==Political views==\n===The West===\nAoun explained why he turned back on the West and forged an alliance with the [[Axis of Resistance]] in a speech on May 2008 by saying:\n\n{{quote|\"We chose this long-term political option, because we knew that the interests of the West do not lie with us. Its interests lie with Israel, on one hand, and with the oil, on the other hand. We are not included among its interests at present. The only thing it cares about is resolving the problem of Israel at our expense, through the naturalization of the Palestinians in Lebanon, and pleasing the oil-producing countries, because its material interests lie there. Therefore, we had to choose a policy of coordination with all elements of Lebanese society, and with our neighboring countries, in order to build strong, solid, and mutual relations. Lebanese society in general, and the Christians in particular, are not used to this, and therefore, it has aroused fear and concern. However, our confidence in ourselves, in the choice we made, and in our views have made it possible for us to stand before you, and to ask you to give the efforts we are undertaking a chance.

I cannot be against the United States; besides, politically, I am linked to American politics. How could anyone say I am anti-American? But I regret the American position on Lebanon. I pray for the day when the United States will correctly see Lebanon.\nI know the power of the United States, its influence in the world. I know that it can crush anyone who resists its wishes. At the same time, I will defend myself against the United States even if it crushes me, I will only engage in self-defense.\n\n[...]\n\nIt's not just a matter of convincing the American people, but of convincing those who make policy in the United States. They should know that Lebanon is an antidote to much that is wrong with the Middle East. Fundamentalist Islam is creating a fundamentalist Judaism, for action always leads to reaction. If Lebanon fails, how can tolerant societies be built in the Middle East? No land of tolerance will emerge without Lebanon.

He goes to France to receive further military training at Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne. He graduates the following year. He is promoted to Second Lieutenant on 30 September.\n* 1966: Gets military training at [[Fort Sill]], Oklahoma, USA.\n* 1978: Goes to France for more military training at \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure de Guerre.\n* 1980: Returns to Lebanon, where he soon is appointed head of the Defence Brigade, which is stationed along the [[Green Line (Lebanon)|Green Line]] that separated West and East Beirut.\n* 1982: Aoun is promoted to brigadier-general and gets command over the new 8th Brigade, a multi-confessional army unit. The 8th Brigade was instrumental in protecting the Palestinian refugee camp of Borj Al Barajneh from the sinister fate of Sabra and Chatila.\n* 1983: Aoun's 8th Brigade, against superior odds, fends off an attack by Syrian-aligned militias in Suq-al-Gharb, firmly establishing his military credentials.\n* 1984: Is promoted to Lieutenant-general (3 star General), and military chief of staff.\n* 1988 September 22: Is appointed by outgoing president Amine Gemayel (15 minutes before the expiration of his term) to head a military government to be formed by members of the Martial Court, which Aoun as Armed Forces Commander chairs. The Muslim members of the Martial Court, it later transpired, are pressured by the Syrian occupant to decline their appointments. The area under Aoun's control at this point is very small: East Beirut and surrounding suburbs. Amine Gemayel appointed officers to take over after briefly considering judges or a [[caretaker government]] formed of politicians. Having failed to form a political caretaker government and feeling that judges \"can't defend themselves\" he opted for a military cabinet. Indeed, [[Amine Gemayel]] had recognized that his own nemesis throughout his presidency, the militia his slain brother [[Bashir Gemayel]] had founded, the Lebanese Forces, would also attempt to undermine the authority of a caretaker government.\n* 1989: In February 1989: The Lebanese army takes control of the harbour of Beirut, which came to involve military actions against the Lebanese Forces. On 14 February 1989, Aoun and his family escape an assassination attempt by the Lebanese Forces. in March, as part of his strategy to reestablish the government's control over illegal ports, Aoun established a Maritime Control Center to stifle traffic from illegal ports operated by Syrian-aligned militias. These militias respond by shelling the sector under Aoun's control, including the presidential palace, the seat of Aoun's government. In light of Syrian participation in these acts of sedition, Aoun declares a \"war of liberation\" against Syria. In September, Aoun agreed to an Arab League brokered cease-fire. In October 1989, even though the National Reconciliation Charter got support from most Muslim and Christian parliamentarians, Aoun rejected it, because it did not propose a clear schedule for withdrawal of the Syrian army from Lebanon, because \"the Charter was passed under duress, with Parliamentarians on foreign soil under Saudi and Syrian foreign influence.\" Aoun, using his constitutional powers as acting president, dissolved the parliament.\n* 5 November 1989: Aoun refuses to recognize the president, [[Rene Muawad]], newly elected by a parliament that he had dissolved. On 24 November, as had been the case with Muawad (assassinated on 22 November), Aoun does not recognize the new elected president, [[Elias Hrawi]]. Hrawi responds by dismissing Aoun. Aoun ignores the dismissal, insisting that he and not Hrawi holds the legal constitutional power. Aoun's argument remains that having dissolved parliament, the election of Hrawi (and Muawad before him) by that parliament is therefore null and void.\n* December 1989: a group of army commanders visit Michel Aoun on Christmas holiday. Aoun orders his commanders to prepare for a big battle to take place in one month later in order to \"sweep the broken pottery\" (i.e. the ''Lebanese Forces''). For this reason the battle between Aoun's Army and the Lebanese Forces is called \"cancellation war\" (\u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0621).\n* January 1990: Aoun's forces attack a school in Ain El Remmeneh that belongs to the Lebanese Forces and controlled it, this incident comes after Aoun's press conference stating that \"The only rifle allowed is for the Lebanese Army.\" Michel Aoun doesn't know that Samir Geagea is prepared for this war, so he does not anticipate that the war will last six months, and the war weakens both sides and divides and weakens Christians.\n* October 1990: Following an air and ground campaign, Syrian troops and air forces occupy all areas controlled by the Lebanese Army. Under siege and military pressure by the Syrian army and the Lebanese Forces, Aoun is now holed up in the presidential palace of Baabda, and is requested to go to the French Embassy to declare a surrender. There, he surrenders to the Syrians via a radio address, however bad communications due to heavy bombardment prevents some divisions from receiving an official order to surrender, who thus continue fighting, resulting in a particularly bloody battle in the town of [[Dahr al-Wahsh]] where two hundred Lebanese troops manage to inflict five-hundred casualties on the Syrian army (the troops and many local civilians subsequently massacre after surrendering)\n* August 1991: Aoun leaves for France after the Lebanese government has granted him conditional amnesty, and the French president, asylum.\n* January 1999: Prime Minister [[Rafik Hariri]] says that Aoun could return to Lebanon with the guarantee that he will not be arrested. He is uncertain as to how Syria will react, and remains abroad\n* 7 May 2005: Aoun returns to Lebanon. In late May, he participates in the parliamentary elections. He is elected to the National Assembly, and his party, the [[Free Patriotic Movement]], wins 21 seats\n* 2008: Participates for the first time in the Lebanese government with five ministers\n* 7 May 2009: The [[Free Patriotic Movement]] wins 19 seats, 5 more seats than in the previous elections.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nowlebanon.com/NewsArchiveDetails.aspx?ID=97943 |title=NowLebanon.com 2009 General Elections Results|publisher=}}</ref> In November, he takes part in the new government with five ministers.\n* 2011: The 14-month-old government collapsed after FPM ministers declare their resignation, followed by the rest of the opposition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/01/11/lebanese-leader-says-deal-lebanon/|work=Fox News|title=Lebanese Government Collapses After Hezbollah Ministers Resign|date=12 January 2011}}</ref> According to Aoun, the priorities of the new government would now be to break all ties with the tribunal, and to stamp out the 20-year-long corruption plaguing the country. The new Government is formed on 13 June 2011, with 6 ministers for the [[Free Patriotic Movement]], up from 3 in the last government, and a total of 11 ministers for Aoun's C&R bloc. However, the loyalties of the five non-FPM ministers of this bloc seem to shift very easily to Mikati depending on their own interests, as did the rest of the 8 March coalition, leaving Aoun's ministers as a minority in the government without even veto powers, as they were in Saad Hariri's government.\n* April 2013: General Aoun's parliamentary bloc manage to conclude a consensus around a new electoral law based on proportionality.

In the UK, it is produced for the BBC. The show initially ran between 1990 and 2001 and was later revived in a different format known as '''''MasterChef Goes Large''''' from 2005 onwards. In 2008, the \"Goes Large\" part of the name was dropped, but the format remains identical. The revamped format was devised by [[Franc Roddam]] and John Silver with Karen Ross producing.\n\nThe series now appears in four versions: the main ''MasterChef'' series, ''[[MasterChef: The Professionals]]'' for working chefs, ''Celebrity MasterChef'' and ''[[Junior MasterChef]]'' for 9-to-12-year-olds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/08_august/24/junior.shtml |title=CBBC gets children cooking as Junior MasterChef is announced |date=24 August 2009}}</ref> The format has been reproduced around the world in various [[MasterChef|international versions]].\n\n==Original series==\nIn the original series, three amateur cooks took part in each episode, with nine rounds leading up to three semifinals and a final, in which they competed for the title of ''MasterChef''. The contestants were required to cook a gourmet three-course meal in under two hours. Contestants could cook any recipe, although there was a price limit on ingredients. \"Everyday\" ingredients and equipment were provided for them, in addition to which they could bring in up to five \"specialist\" ingredients or utensils.\n\nThe first incarnation of the series was presented by [[Loyd Grossman]], who was joined each week by two guest judges. One was a professional chef, the other was a celebrity. Grossman and the guest judges discussed the menus, walked around talking to the contestants and finally ate and judged the food. Originally, the judges' \"cogitations\" took place off-camera, though later on, edited highlights of the discussions were added between the tasting and the announcement of the winner.\n\nIn 1998 Grossman decided to take a [[sabbatical]], and the series was placed on hiatus in his absence.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He returned to present the 1999 series, but left the show in 2000.\n\n===2001 revamp===\nIn 2001, in response to declining ratings, the show underwent a makeover. It was moved from its traditional Sunday afternoon slot on [[BBC One]] to a Tuesday night slot on [[BBC Two]]. This new version of the programme asked contestants to cook two courses in just 90 minutes, and each contestant could only use the same key ingredient in each course \u2014 this was extended to two-and-a-half hours for three courses in the final. The celebrity judge was no longer included in this version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|title=Masterchef - UKGameshows|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173955/http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn October 2000, Grossman quit in anger over the proposed changes and he was replaced by chef [[Gary Rhodes]], who had previously presented ''[[MasterChef USA]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} ENTERTAINMENT {{!}} Grossman quits Masterchef|last=|first=|date=17 October 2000|website=BBC News Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202162125/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> The new version of the show received acclaim for its more serious tone, with Rhodes' advice to contestants being more critical in style than Grossman's, a forerunner of the approach of future cooking competitions like ''[[Hell's Kitchen (British TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' and the new format of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|title=The repast master - Telegraph|last=Symington|first=Nicki|date=7 July 2001|website=The Telegraph|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202164127/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|title=Between courses... {{!}} Food {{!}} The Guardian|last=Rayner|first=Jay|date=8 September 2002|website=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173735/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> However, it did not revive ratings as hoped, and was cancelled by the BBC after the first series.\n\n==Revived series==\nIn 2005, executive producers Franc Roddam and John Silver, along with series producer Karen Ross radically overhauled the format, and a new series was introduced, initially under the name ''MasterChef Goes Large''. The name reverted to ''MasterChef'' in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/tv_and_radio/masterchef/ |title=Two Programmes \u2013 MasterChef \u2013 Previous episodes |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\nIn the new version, there are two permanent judges, [[John Torode]] and [[Gregg Wallace]], although neither addresses the viewer directly; instead, narrative information is conveyed in a voiceover by [[India Fisher]].\n\nThe show proved very popular and became one of [[BBC Two]]'s more successful early-evening programmes, leading to an announcement by the BBC in 2009 that it would be moved to [[BBC One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/03_march/13/masterchef.shtml |title=Press Office \u2013 MasterChef rustles up move to BBC One |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\n===Format===\n[[File:Wallace and Torode.jpg|right|thumb|Judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace at ''MasterChef Live'', London, 2009]]\nIn the new format, each series airs five nights a week for eight weeks, consisting of six weeks of heats and quarter-finals, with six contestants emerging to compete against one another over the final two weeks to select a winner.\n\nIn each of the first six weeks, there are four heats and a quarter-final.  Six contestants enter each heat, with one quarter-finalist emerging from each of the four heats. These four quarter-finalists compete for a semi-final place, so that over the first six weeks, six semi-finalists emerge.\n\nIn 2010, the judges were given more flexibility, allowing them to advance more than one contestant to the quarter-finals, or, in one instance, none at all. Series 7 of ''MasterChef'' featured 'talent show-type' audition shows (similar to ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'') in which hopeful chefs cooked in front of the judges to secure a place in the competition. More than 20,000 people applied to audition for the series.<ref>{{cite news|author=BBC |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8332394/MasterChef-revamp-has-turned-cooking-show-into-The-X-Factor.html |title=MasterChef revamp 'has turned cooking show into The X Factor' |publisher=Telegraph |date= 18 February 2011|accessdate=2011-10-22 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Heats====\nThe heats follow a three-round format:\n* ''The Market Test'': the contestants have to invent a dish with the ingredients from the market, they have 15 minutes to select the food and 1 hour 10 minutes to cook the dish. 3 people leave the competition with the remaining going to the impression test from 2017\n* ''The Calling Card'': the contestants must invent a dish from scratch in 75 minutes (40 minutes up until 2009). The contestants can choose from any ingredients they like. \n* ''The Invention Test'': the contestants are given two boxes, one with sweet items, another with savoury. They must pick a box and make a dish out of the ingredients within 75 minutes.\n* ''The Impression Test'': the contestants must cook a two course meal in 75 minutes for past winners and finalists of ''MasterChef''. 1 hour to serve the main course, and a further fifteen minutes after that to serve dessert.\n\n====Quarter-finals====\nThe quarter-finals follow a different structure with different challenges. Up until 2010, the format was:\n* ''The Ingredients Test'': where the contestants are asked to identify a selection of ingredients or produce.\n* ''The Passion Test'': in which each contestant has one minute to convince the judges of their overwhelming passion for food. Following these two rounds, one contestant is knocked out without having cooked that day.\n* Finally, the remaining three quarter-finalists each produce a three course meal in one hour and twenty minutes.\n\nIn 2010, the quarter-final format was changed to:\n* ''The Choice Test'': where the contestants are given 15 minutes to cook their choice of either a pre-selected fish recipe or a meat recipe with the judges looking on. At least one contestant is eliminated after this test.\n* This is followed by the remaining quarter-finalists producing a two course meal in an hour.\n\nNow, the quarter-final format is: \n* ''The Palate Test'': Torode cooks a dish for the contestants, and they must identify the ingredients and try to recreate the dish using the ingredients given. \n* ''The Choice Test'': the chefs have 80 minutes to create a showstopping dish for the judges and a special celebrity food critic\n\n====Comeback Week====\nThe sixth week was called \"Comeback Week\" and featured contestants from the previous series of ''MasterChef'', who did not advance past the heats or quarter-finals. The format was different for this week:\n* ''The Skill Test'': where the contestants have 25 minutes to cook one of two pre-selected recipes. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Palate Test'': where Torode cooks a complex dish and asks the contestants one by one to eat the dish, listing as many ingredients in the dish as possible. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Pressure Test'': where the remaining contestants work a lunchtime shift at a busy restaurant under the supervision of a professional chef who comments on their performance.\n* The remaining contestants then have 60 minutes to cook a two course meal. One contestant is selected to advance to a quarter-final.\n* The comeback quarter-finalists then cook head-to-head in a larger version of the invention test, cooking one dish in an hour. One contestant is selected to advance to the semi-finals.\n\n==''MasterChef Live''==\n''MasterChef Live'' is an extension of the television programme. The event runs annually in November and is held over three days since 2009; it is hosted at [[Olympia (London)|London Olympia]], co-located with the annual [http://www.wineshow.co.uk/ Wine Show].\n\nHighlights of the event include live cooking demonstrations in the Chefs\u2019 Theatre, celebrity chefs, former contestants, critics, and ''MasterChef'' style cook-offs.\n\n== ''Celebrity MasterChef'' ==\n{{redirect|Celebrity MasterChef|the Romanian series|Celebrity MasterChef (Romanian series)}}\n''Celebrity MasterChef'' was devised as a celebrity version of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.

introduced in 2008.\n\n==''Junior MasterChef''==\n{{main article|Junior MasterChef}}\n''Junior MasterChef'' originally ran from 1994 to 1999 for under-16s. It was revived in 2010 with an age range of nine to twelve. A second series of the revived format ran in 2012, with a third following in 2014.\n\n== 2018 ''Rendang'' controversy ==\n''MasterChef'' was involved in a controversy (during Series 14, Episode 13) when Zaleha Kadir Olpin, a Malaysian-born contestant who had cooked ''[[nasi lemak]]'' and [[rendang]], native Southeast Asian dishes, was criticised by judges Gregg Wallace and John Torode because the dish was of poor quality. She had attempted to make a dish in thirty minutes that normally takes several hours to cook. Wallace pointed out that she should have tried to make a crispy chicken dish, given the time she had available.  Many commentators (who did not realise what the competition was about), particularly from Malaysia and Indonesia, pointed out that rendang is usually cooked as a stew and is not crispy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=France-Presse|first1=Agence|title='I would rendang his head': UK MasterChef judges stir up a storm|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/03/i-would-rendang-his-head-uk-masterchef-judges-stir-up-a-storm|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 April 2018}}</ref> The judges failed to differentiate between \"crispy\" and \"undercooked\".

competitive cooking show produced by [[Endemol Shine Group]] and is broadcast in 60 countries around the world. In the UK, it is produced for the BBC. The show initially ran between 1990 and 2001 and was later revived in a different format known as '''''MasterChef Goes Large''''' from 2005 onwards. In 2008, the \"Goes Large\" part of the name was dropped, but the format remains identical. The revamped format was devised by [[Franc Roddam]] and John Silver with Karen Ross producing.\n\nThe series now appears in four versions: the main ''MasterChef'' series, ''[[MasterChef: The Professionals]]'' for working chefs, ''Celebrity MasterChef'' and ''[[Junior MasterChef]]'' for 9-to-12-year-olds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/08_august/24/junior.shtml |title=CBBC gets children cooking as Junior MasterChef is announced |date=24 August 2009}}</ref> The format has been reproduced around the world in various [[MasterChef|international versions]].\n\n==Original series==\nIn the original series, three amateur cooks took part in each episode, with nine heats leading up to three semifinals and a final, in which they competed for the title of ''MasterChef''. The contestants were required to cook a gourmet three-course meal in under two hours. Contestants could cook any recipe, although there was a price limit on ingredients. \"Everyday\" ingredients and equipment were provided for them, in addition to which they could bring in up to five \"specialist\" ingredients or utensils.\n\nThe first incarnation of the series was presented by [[Loyd Grossman]], who was joined each week by two guest judges. One was a professional chef, the other was a celebrity. Grossman and the guest judges discussed the menus, walked around talking to the contestants and finally ate and judged the food. Originally, the judges' \"cogitations\" took place off-camera, though later on, edited highlights of the discussions were added between the tasting and the announcement of the winner.\n\nIn 1998 Grossman decided to take a [[sabbatical]], and the series was placed on hiatus in his absence.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He returned to present the 1999 series, but left the programme in 2000.\n\n===2001 revamp===\nIn 2001, in response to declining ratings, the programme underwent a makeover. It was moved from its traditional Sunday afternoon slot on [[BBC One]] to a Tuesday night slot on [[BBC Two]]. This new version of the programme asked contestants to cook two courses in just 90 minutes, and each contestant could only use the same key ingredient in each course \u2014 this was extended to two-and-a-half hours for three courses in the final. The celebrity judge was no longer included in this version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|title=Masterchef - UKGameshows|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173955/http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn October 2000, Grossman quit in anger over the proposed changes and he was replaced by chef [[Gary Rhodes]], who had previously presented ''[[MasterChef USA]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} ENTERTAINMENT {{!}} Grossman quits Masterchef|last=|first=|date=17 October 2000|website=BBC News Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202162125/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> The new version of the show received acclaim for its more serious tone, with Rhodes' advice to contestants being more critical in style than Grossman's, a forerunner of the approach of future cooking competitions like ''[[Hell's Kitchen (British TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' and the new format of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|title=The repast master - Telegraph|last=Symington|first=Nicki|date=7 July 2001|website=The Telegraph|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202164127/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|title=Between courses... {{!}} Food {{!}} The Guardian|last=Rayner|first=Jay|date=8 September 2002|website=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173735/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> However, it did not revive ratings as hoped, and was cancelled by the BBC after one series.\n\n==Revived series==\nIn 2005, executive producers Franc Roddam and John Silver, along with series producer Karen Ross radically overhauled the format, and a new series was introduced, initially under the name ''MasterChef Goes Large''. The name reverted to ''MasterChef'' in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/tv_and_radio/masterchef/ |title=Two Programmes \u2013 MasterChef \u2013 Previous episodes |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\nIn the new version, there are two permanent judges, [[John Torode]] and [[Gregg Wallace]], although neither addresses the viewer directly; instead, narrative information is conveyed in a voiceover by [[India Fisher]].\n\nThe show proved very popular and became one of [[BBC Two]]'s more successful early-evening programmes, leading to an announcement by the BBC in 2009 that it would be moved to [[BBC One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/03_march/13/masterchef.shtml |title=Press Office \u2013 MasterChef rustles up move to BBC One |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\n===Format===\n[[File:Wallace and Torode.jpg|right|thumb|Judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace at ''MasterChef Live'', London, 2009]]\nIn the new format, each series airs five nights a week for eight weeks, consisting of six weeks of heats and quarter-finals, with six contestants emerging to compete against one another over the final two weeks to select a winner.\n\nIn each of the first six weeks, there are four heats and a quarter-final.  Six contestants enter each heat, with one quarter-finalist emerging from each of the four heats. These four quarter-finalists compete for a semi-final place, so that over the first six weeks, six semi-finalists emerge.\n\nIn 2010, the judges were given more flexibility, allowing them to advance more than one contestant to the quarter-finals, or, in one instance, none at all. Series 7 of ''MasterChef'' featured 'talent show-type' audition shows (similar to ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'') in which hopeful chefs cooked in front of the judges to secure a place in the competition. More than 20,000 people applied to audition for the series.<ref>{{cite news|author=BBC |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8332394/MasterChef-revamp-has-turned-cooking-show-into-The-X-Factor.html |title=MasterChef revamp 'has turned cooking show into The X Factor' |publisher=Telegraph |date= 18 February 2011|accessdate=2011-10-22 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Heats====\nThe heats follow a three-round format:\n* ''The Market Test'': the contestants have to invent a dish with the ingredients from the market, they have 15 minutes to select the food and 1 hour 10 minutes to cook the dish. 3 people leave the competition with the remaining going to the impression test from 2017\n* ''The Calling Card'': the contestants must invent a dish from scratch in 75 minutes (40 minutes up until 2009). The contestants can choose from any ingredients they like. \n* ''The Invention Test'': the contestants are given two boxes, one with sweet items, another with savoury. They must pick a box and make a dish out of the ingredients within 75 minutes.\n* ''The Impression Test'': the contestants must cook a two course meal in 75 minutes for past winners and finalists of ''MasterChef''. 1 hour to serve the main course, and a further fifteen minutes after that to serve dessert.\n\n====Quarter-finals====\nThe quarter-finals follow a different structure with different challenges. Up until 2010, the format was:\n* ''The Ingredients Test'': where the contestants are asked to identify a selection of ingredients or produce.\n* ''The Passion Test'': in which each contestant has one minute to convince the judges of their overwhelming passion for food. Following these two rounds, one contestant is knocked out without having cooked that day.\n* Finally, the remaining three quarter-finalists each produce a three course meal in one hour and twenty minutes.\n\nIn 2010, the quarter-final format was changed to:\n* ''The Choice Test'': where the contestants are given 15 minutes to cook their choice of either a pre-selected fish recipe or a meat recipe with the judges looking on. At least one contestant is eliminated after this test.\n* This is followed by the remaining quarter-finalists producing a two course meal in an hour.\n\nNow, the quarter-final format is: \n* ''The Palate Test'': Torode cooks a dish for the contestants, and they must identify the ingredients and try to recreate the dish using the ingredients given. \n* ''The Choice Test'': the chefs have 80 minutes to create a showstopping dish for the judges and a special celebrity food critic\n\n====Comeback Week====\nThe sixth week was called \"Comeback Week\" and featured contestants from the previous series of ''MasterChef'', who did not advance past the heats or quarter-finals. The format was different for this week:\n* ''The Skill Test'': where the contestants have 25 minutes to cook one of two pre-selected recipes. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Palate Test'': where Torode cooks a complex dish and asks the contestants one by one to eat the dish, listing as many ingredients in the dish as possible. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Pressure Test'': where the remaining contestants work a lunchtime shift at a busy restaurant under the supervision of a professional chef who comments on their performance.\n* The remaining contestants then have 60 minutes to cook a two course meal. One contestant is selected to advance to a quarter-final.\n* The comeback quarter-finalists then cook head-to-head in a larger version of the invention test, cooking one dish in an hour. One contestant is selected to advance to the semi-finals.\n\n==''MasterChef Live''==\n''MasterChef Live'' is an extension of the television programme. The event runs annually in November and is held over three days since 2009; it is hosted at [[Olympia (London)|London Olympia]], co-located with the annual [http://www.wineshow.co.uk/ Wine Show].\n\nHighlights of the event include live cooking demonstrations in the Chefs\u2019 Theatre, celebrity chefs, former contestants, critics, and ''MasterChef'' style cook-offs.\n\n== ''Celebrity MasterChef'' ==\n{{redirect|Celebrity MasterChef|the Romanian series|Celebrity MasterChef (Romanian series)}}\n''Celebrity MasterChef'' was devised as a celebrity version of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.

''Labour Unity'') was the name used by a series of [[List of political parties in Israel|political parties]].  Ahdut HaAvoda in its first incarnation was led by [[David Ben-Gurion]]. It was  first established during the period of [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] and later became part of the [[Israel]]i political establishment. It was one of the forerunners of the modern-day [[Israeli Labor Party]].\n\n==History==\n===Ahdut HaAvoda===\nThe original Ahdut HaAvoda party was founded in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in March 1919, while under British military administration, after a split in the [[Poale Zion]] party, which had established a branch in [[Ottoman Syria]] in 1906. Ahdut HaAvoda was led by David Ben-Gurion, who had been a member of the pre-war group. The root of the division was a conflict between membership of the [[Communist International]] and participation in the bourgeois [[Zionist Organisation]] (ZO). The membership of the more radical anti-ZO faction tended to come from among the newer [[Yiddish]]-speaking immigrants. The speaking of Yiddish became another area of disagreement with Ahdut HaAvoda having a [[Revival of the Hebrew language|Hebrew]]-only policy.<ref>Lokman, Zachary. ''Comrades and Enemies: Arab and Jewish Workers in Palestine 1906\u20131948''. University of California Press. 1996. {{ISBN|0-520-20259-7}}. Pages 59, 67. \"Those attempting to speak in Yiddish ... were frequently shouted down at public meetings\"</ref>\n\nThe following year, 1920, at a conference in June, the Ahdut HaAvoda decided to establish a military organisation, the [[Haganah]], to replace the existing [[Hashomer]] militias.<ref>Peri, Yoram. ''Between Battles and Ballots: Israeli Military in Politics''. Cambridge University Press. 1983. {{ISBN|0-521-24414-5}}. Page 26.</ref>\n\nAlso in 1920, Ahdut HaAvoda and the [[Marxism|non-Marxist]] [[Hapoel Hatzair]] cooperated to set up the \"General Organization of Hebrew Workers\"\u2014the [[Histadrut]]. In November delegates were elected by 4,500 members of the various labor groups and the first congress was held in Haifa, December 1920. Ahdut HaAvoda did not have an overall majority, but with the help of Hapoel Hatzair, they dominated proceedings. Their objective was the building of a separate Jewish workers economy in [[Greater Israel]]. Ben-Gurion was living in [[New York City|New York]] at the time, but returned in 1921 to be elected the first Secretary of the Histradrut.<ref>Lokman. Page 65. \"out of a Jewish population of 80,000\"</ref><ref>Peri. Page 29. Has Ahdut HaAvoda established in February 1919 and Ben Gurion first Secretary of the Histadrut in December 1919.</ref> The Haganah was placed under Histadrut jurisdiction.<ref>Peri. Page 29.</ref>\n\nAt the third Ahdut HaAvoda congress in 1924 at [[Ein Harod]], Ben-Gurion defeated proposals put forward by [[Shlomo Kaplansky]] that a parliament be set up in Mandate Palestine. The issue had arisen due to the [[Colonial Office|British Colonial Office]] having presented plans for the setting up of a Legislative Council.<ref>Lokman. Pages 77, 78.</ref>\n\nOther important members of the first Ahdut HaAvoda were [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]], and [[Berl Katznelson]].\n\nCooperation between Ahdut HaAvoda and Hapoel Hatzair led them to merge in 1930 to form the \"Party of the Workers of the Land of Israel\"\u2014[[Mapai]], which was to become the dominant force in Zionist politics until the 1960s.<ref>Peri.

Others with close ties were [[David Elazar]], [[Yitzhak Hofi]], [[Avraham Adan]] and [[Yitzhak Rabin]].\n\n===Ahdut HaAvoda Poale Zion Movement===\nIn 1946 the Ahdut HaAvoda Movement merged with [[Poale Zion Left]] to form the Ahdut HaAvoda Poale Zion Movement ({{lang-he|\u05d4\u05ea\u05e0\u05d5\u05e2\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d7\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 \u05e4\u05d5\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9 \u05e6\u05d9\u05d5\u05df}}, ''HaTnu'a LeAhdut HaAvoda Poale Zion''). Two years later the party merged with the [[Hashomer Hatzair Workers Party of Palestine|Hashomer Hatzair Workers Party]] to form [[Mapam]]. Most senior Haganah commanders were Mapam members, including the head of the National Command Israel Galili who was one of Mapam's leaders. The Palmach was also dominated by Mapam with its commanding officer, Yigal Allon, and five brigade commanders being members.<ref>Peri, page 47.</ref> With the creation of Israel's national army this led to conflict with Ben Gurion. In 1953, after a series of confrontations, two of the four area Command Commanders and six of the twelve Brigade Commanders resigned. Those members of Mapam who remained, Yitzhak Rabin, [[Haim Bar-Lev]] and David Elazar, had to endure several years in staff or training post before resuming their careers.<ref>Peri, page 62.</ref>\n\n===Ahdut HaAvoda \u2013 Poale Zion===\nOn 23 August 1954 [[Moshe Aram]], [[Yisrael Bar-Yehuda]], [[Yitzhak Ben-Aharon]] and [[Aharon Zisling]] broke away from Mapam to re-establish Ahdut HaAvoda \u2013 Poale Zion. However, they were not recognised by the [[List of Knesset speakers|speaker of the Knesset]] as an independent party. The new party also launched a newspaper, ''[[LaMerhav]]'', which became a daily publication in December that year, and was published until merging into ''[[Davar]]'' in May 1971.\n\nThe [[1955 Israeli legislative election|1955 elections]] were fought as '''Ahdut HaAvoda''' and the party won 10 seats, making them the fifth largest in the [[Knesset]]. They formed part of both of Ben-Gurion's governing coalitions during the third Knesset. Party member [[Nahum Nir]] was appointed [[List of Knesset speakers|Knesset speaker]] (the only time a speaker has not been a member of the largest party), Bar-Yehuda was made Minister of Internal Affairs, and [[Moshe Carmel]] became [[Transportation Minister of Israel|Minister of Transportation]]. However, they party were ultimately responsible for bringing down the government in 1959 when they and fellow coalition partners Mapam voted against the government on the issue of selling arms to [[West Germany]] but refused to leave the coalition.\n\nIn the [[1959 Israeli legislative election|1959 elections]] the party was reduced to seven seats. They again joined the coalition government until its collapse in 1961, with Ben-Aharon becoming Minister of Transportation. The [[1961 Israeli legislative election|1961 elections]] saw them gain one seat, and become part of all three coalition governments of the fifth Knesset with Yigal Allon becoming Minister of Labour and Ben-Aharon, Bar-Yehuda and Carmel all acting as Minister of Transportation during the session.\n\nFor the [[1965 Israeli legislative election|1965 elections]], the party allied with Mapai to form the [[Alignment (political party)|Labor Alignment]], which won 45 seats. On 23 January 1968 the party merged with Mapai and [[Rafi (political party)|Rafi]] to form the [[Israeli Labor Party]] and ceased to exist as an individual entity.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.knesset.gov.il/faction/eng/FactionPage_eng.asp?PG=80 Ahdut HaAvoda - Poalei Zion] Knesset website\n\n{{Israeli political parties}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Political parties established in 1919]]\n[[Category:Defunct political parties in Israel]]\n[[Category:Political parties in Mandatory Palestine]]\n[[Category:Political parties disestablished in 1968]]\n[[Category:Zionist political parties in Israel]]\n[[Category:Labor Zionism]]\n[[Category:Zionism in Mandatory Palestine]]\n[[Category:Socialist parties in Israel]]\n[[Category:1919 establishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:1968 disestablishments in Israel]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox political party\n|name               = Ahdut HaAvoda\n|native_name        = {{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05b7\u05d7\u05b0\u05d3\u05d5\u05bc\u05ea \u05d4\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d3\u05b8\u05d4}}\n|lang1              = \n|lang1_name         = \n|lang2              = \n|lang2_name         = \n|lang3              = \n|lang3_name         = \n|lang4              = \n|lang4_name         = \n|logo               = AhdutHaAvoda.png\n|logo_size          = 120px\n|leader             = [[Yitzhak Tabenkin]]<br />[[Yigal Allon]]\n|chairman           = \n|president          = \n|secretary          = \n|spokesperson       = \n|leader1_title      = \n|leader1_name       = \n|leader2_title      = \n|leader2_name       = \n|leader3_title      = \n|leader3_name       = \n|founded            = March 1919 (Ahdut HaAvoda)<br />1944 (Ahdut HaAvoda Movement)<br />{{nowrap|1954 (Ahdut HaAvoda - Poale Zion)}}\n|dissolved          = 23 January 1968\n|merger             = \n|split              = [[Poale Zion]] (1919)<br />[[Mapai]] (1944)<br />[[Mapam]] (1954)\n|merged             = [[Mapai]] (5 Jan 1930)<br />[[Mapam]] (1948)<br />[[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]] (1968)\n|headquarters       = \n|newspaper          = ''[[LaMerhav]]'' (Hebrew)<br />''Folksblatt'' (Yiddish)\n|youth_wing         = \n|wing1_title        = \n|wing1              = \n|wing2_title        = \n|wing2              = \n|wing3_title        = \n|wing3              = \n|membership_year    = \n|membership         = \n|ideology           = [[Labor Zionism]]\n|position           =  [[Left-wing]]\n|national           = \n|international      = \n|europarl           = \n|affiliation1_title = Alliances\n|affiliation1       =[[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]] (1965\u20131968)\n|colorcode          = {{Ahdut HaAvoda/meta/color}}\n|seats1_title       = Most MKs\n|seats1             = 10 (1955\u20131959)\n|seats2_title       = {{nowrap|Fewest MKs}}\n|seats2             = 4 (1954\u20131955)\n|symbol             = {{Hebrew|\u05ea\u05d5}}\n|website            = \n|country            = Israel\n}}\n\n'''Ahdut HaAvoda''' ({{lang-he-n|\u05d0\u05b7\u05d7\u05b0\u05d3\u05d5\u05bc\u05ea \u05d4\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d3\u05b8\u05d4}}, lit. ''Labour Unity'') was the name used by a series of [[List of political parties in Israel|political parties]].  Ahdut HaAvoda in its first incarnation was led by [[David Ben-Gurion]]. It was  first established during the period of [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] and later became part of the [[Israel]]i political establishment. It was one of the forerunners of the modern-day [[Israeli Labor Party]].\n\n==History==\n===Ahdut HaAvoda===\nThe original Ahdut HaAvoda party was founded in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in March 1919, while under British military administration, after a split in the [[Poale Zion]] party, which had established a branch in [[Ottoman Syria]] in 1906. Ahdut HaAvoda was led by David Ben-Gurion, who had been a member of the pre-war group. The root of the division was a conflict between membership of the [[Communist International]] and participation in the bourgeois [[Zionist Organisation]] (ZO). The membership of the more radical anti-ZO faction tended to come from among the newer [[Yiddish]]-speaking immigrants. The speaking of Yiddish became another area of disagreement with Ahdut HaAvoda having a [[Revival of the Hebrew language|Hebrew]]-only policy.<ref>Lokman, Zachary. \"Comrades and Enemies - Arab and Jewish Workers in Palestine 1906 - 1948\". University of California Press. 1996. {{ISBN|0-520-20259-7}}. Pages 59, 67. \"Those attempting to speak in Yiddish ... were frequently shouted down at public meetings\"</ref>\n\nThe following year, 1920, at a conference in June, the Ahdut HaAvoda decided to establish a military organisation, the [[Haganah]], to replace the existing [[Hashomer]] militias.<ref>Peri, Yoram. \"Between battles and ballots. Israeli military in politics.\" Cambridge University Press. 1983. {{ISBN|0-521-24414-5}}. Page 26.</ref>\n\nAlso in 1920, Ahdut HaAvoda and the [[Marxism|non-Marxist]] [[Hapoel Hatzair]] cooperated to set up the \"General Organization of Hebrew Workers\" - the [[Histadrut]]. In November delegates were elected by 4,500 members of the various labor groups and the first congress was held in Haifa, December 1920. Ahdut HaAvoda did not have an overall majority, but with the help of Hapoel Hatzair, they dominated proceedings. Their objective was the building of a separate Jewish workers economy in [[Greater Israel]]. Ben-Gurion was living in [[New York City|New York]] at the time, but returned in 1921 to be elected the first Secretary of the Histradrut.<ref>Lokman. Page 65. \"out of a Jewish population of 80,000\"</ref><ref>Peri. Page 29. Has Ahdut HaAvoda established in February 1919 and Ben Gurion first Secretary of the Histadrut in December 1919.</ref> The Haganah was placed under Histadrut jurisdiction.<ref>Peri. Page 29.</ref>\n\nAt the third Ahdut HaAvoda congress in 1924 at [[Ein Harod]], Ben-Gurion defeated proposals put forward by [[Shlomo Kaplansky]] that a parliament be set up in Mandate Palestine. The issue had arisen due to the [[Colonial Office|British Colonial Office]] having presented plans for the setting up of a Legislative Council.<ref>Lokman. Pages 77, 78.</ref>\n\nOther important members of the first Ahdut HaAvoda were [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]], and [[Berl Katznelson]].\n\nCooperation between Ahdut HaAvoda and Hapoel Hatzair led them to merge in 1930 to form the \"Party of the Workers of the Land of Israel\" - [[Mapai]], which was to become the dominant force in Zionist politics until the 1960s.<ref>Peri. Page 103.</ref>\n\n===Ahdut HaAvoda Movement===\nOn 20 May 1944 a group known as ''Faction B'' ({{lang-he|\u05e1\u05d9\u05e2\u05d4 \u05d1'}}, ''Sia'a Bet'') split from Mapai adopting the Ahdut HaAvoda name from fourteen years earlier ({{lang-he|\u05d4\u05ea\u05e0\u05d5\u05e2\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d7\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4}}, ''HaTnu'a LeAhdut HaAvoda'').<ref>[http://www.jafi.org.il/education/jafi75/timeline3e.html#1 1944 timeline] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015200914/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/jafi75/timeline3e.html#1 |date=October 15, 2008 }} Jewish Agency for Israel</ref> This group was pro-Soviet, and rejected any territorial compromise.

Used for special purposes like (non-industrial-purpose) knives, axles or [[Punch (metalworking)|punches]]. Most steels with more than 2.5% carbon content are made using [[powder metallurgy]].\n\n==Heat treatment==\n[[File:Heat transfer steel diag2.png|thumb|right|Iron-carbon [[phase diagram]], showing the temperature and carbon ranges for certain types of heat treatments.]]\n{{main|Heat treatment}}\n\nThe purpose of heat treating carbon steel is to change the mechanical properties of steel, usually ductility, hardness, yield strength, or impact resistance. Note that the electrical and thermal conductivity are only slightly altered. As with most strengthening techniques for steel, [[Young's modulus]] (elasticity) is unaffected. All treatments of steel trade ductility for increased strength and vice versa. Iron has a higher solubility for carbon in the [[austenite]] phase; therefore all heat treatments, except spheroidizing and process annealing, start by heating the steel to a temperature at which the austenitic phase can exist. The steel is then quenched (heat drawn out) at a moderate to low rate allowing carbon to diffuse out of the austenite forming iron-carbide (cementite) and leaving ferrite, or at a high rate, trapping the carbon within the iron thus forming martensite. The rate at which the steel is cooled through the [[eutectoid]] temperature (about 727&nbsp;\u00b0C) affects the rate at which carbon diffuses out of austenite and forms cementite. Generally speaking, cooling swiftly will leave iron carbide finely dispersed and produce a fine grained [[pearlite]] and cooling slowly will give a coarser pearlite. Cooling a hypoeutectoid steel (less than 0.77 wt% C) results in a lamellar-pearlitic structure of iron carbide layers with \u03b1-[[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] (nearly pure iron) between. If it is hypereutectoid steel (more than 0.77 wt% C) then the structure is full pearlite with small grains (larger than the pearlite lamella) of [[cementite]] formed on the grain boundaries. A eutectoid steel (0.77% carbon) will have a pearlite structure throughout the grains with no cementite at the boundaries. The relative amounts of constituents are found using the [[lever rule]]. The following is a list of the types of heat treatments possible:\n\n*'''Spheroidizing''': Spheroidite forms when carbon steel is heated to approximately 700&nbsp;\u00b0C for over 30 hours. Spheroidite can form at lower temperatures but the time needed drastically increases, as this is a diffusion-controlled process. The result is a structure of rods or spheres of cementite within primary structure (ferrite or pearlite, depending on which side of the eutectoid you are on). The purpose is to soften higher carbon steels and allow more formability. This is the softest and most ductile form of steel. The adjacent image shows where spheroidizing usually occurs.<ref>Smith, p. 388</ref>\n*'''[[Annealing (metallurgy)|Full annealing]]''': Carbon steel is heated to approximately 40&nbsp;\u00b0C above Ac3{{?}} or Acm{{?}} for 1 hour; this ensures all the [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] transforms into [[austenite]] (although [[cementite]] might still exist if the carbon content is greater than the eutectoid). The steel must then be cooled slowly, in the realm of 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (36&nbsp;\u00b0F) per hour. Usually it is just furnace cooled, where the furnace is turned off with the steel still inside. This results in a coarse pearlitic structure, which means the \"bands\" of [[pearlite]] are thick.<ref name=Alvarenga>{{cite journal |vauthors=Alvarenga HD, Van de Putte T, Van Steenberge N, Sietsma J, Terryn H |title=Influence of Carbide Morphology and Microstructure on the Kinetics of Superficial Decarburization of C-Mn Steels |journal=Metall Mater Trans A |volume=46 |pages=123\u2013133 |date=Apr 2009 |doi=10.1007/s11661-014-2600-y }}</ref> Fully annealed steel is soft and [[ductile]], with no internal stresses, which is often necessary for cost-effective forming. Only spheroidized steel is softer and more ductile.<ref>Smith, p. 386</ref>\n*'''Process annealing''': A process used to relieve stress in a cold-worked carbon steel with less than 0.3% C. The steel is usually heated to 550\u2013650&nbsp;\u00b0C for 1 hour, but sometimes temperatures as high as 700&nbsp;\u00b0C. The image rightward{{clarify|date=June 2016}} shows the area where process annealing occurs.\n*'''Isothermal annealing''': It is a process in which hypoeutectoid steel is heated above the upper critical temperature. This temperature is maintained for a time and then reduced to below the lower critical temperature and is again maintained. It is then cooled to room temperature. This method eliminates any temperature gradient.\n*'''Normalizing''': Carbon steel is heated to approximately 55&nbsp;\u00b0C above Ac3 or Acm for 1 hour; this ensures the steel completely transforms to austenite. The steel is then air-cooled, which is a cooling rate of approximately {{convert|38|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} per minute. This results in a fine pearlitic structure, and a more-uniform structure. Normalized steel has a higher strength than annealed steel; it has a relatively high strength and hardness.<ref>Smith, pp. 386\u2013387</ref>\n*'''[[Quenching]]''': Carbon steel with at least 0.4 wt% C is heated to normalizing temperatures and then rapidly cooled (quenched) in water, brine, or oil to the critical temperature. The critical temperature is dependent on the carbon content, but as a general rule is lower as the carbon content increases. This results in a martensitic structure; a form of steel that possesses a super-saturated carbon content in a deformed body-centered cubic (BCC) crystalline structure, properly termed body-centered tetragonal (BCT), with much internal stress. Thus quenched steel is extremely hard but [[brittle]], usually too brittle for practical purposes. These internal stresses may cause stress cracks on the surface. Quenched steel is approximately three times harder (four with more carbon) than normalized steel.<ref>Smith, pp. 373\u2013377</ref>\n*'''[[Martempering]] (Marquenching)''': Martempering is not actually a tempering procedure, hence the term \"marquenching\". It is a form of isothermal heat treatment applied after an initial quench, typically in a molten salt bath, at a temperature just above the \"martensite start temperature\". At this temperature, residual stresses within the material are relieved and some bainite may be formed from the retained austenite which did not have time to transform into anything else. In industry, this is a process used to control the ductility and hardness of a material. With longer marquenching, the ductility increases with a minimal loss in strength; the steel is held in this solution until the inner and outer temperatures of the part equalize. Then the steel is cooled at a moderate speed to keep the temperature gradient minimal. Not only does this process reduce internal stresses and stress cracks, but it also increases the impact resistance.<ref>Smith, pp. 389\u2013390</ref>\n*'''[[Tempering (metallurgy)|Tempering]]''': This is the most common heat treatment encountered, because the final properties can be precisely determined by the temperature and time of the tempering. Tempering involves reheating quenched steel to a temperature below the [[eutectoid]] temperature then cooling. The elevated temperature allows very small amounts of spheroidite to form, which restores ductility, but reduces hardness. Actual temperatures and times are carefully chosen for each composition.<ref>Smith, pp. 387\u2013388</ref>\n*'''[[Austempering]]''': The austempering process is the same as martempering, except the quench is interrupted and the steel is held in the molten salt bath at temperatures between 205&nbsp;\u00b0C and 540&nbsp;\u00b0C, and then cooled at a moderate rate. The resulting steel, called bainite, produces an acicular microstructure in the steel that has great strength (but less than martensite), greater ductility, higher impact resistance, and less distortion than martensite steel. The disadvantage of austempering is it can be used only on a few steels, and it requires a special salt bath.<ref>Smith, p. 391</ref>\n\n==Case hardening==\n{{main|Case hardening}}\nCase hardening processes harden only the exterior of the steel part, creating a hard, wear resistant skin (the \"case\") but preserving a tough and ductile interior. Carbon steels are not very [[hardenability|hardenable]] meaning they can not be hardened throughout thick sections. Alloy steels have a better hardenability, so they can be through-hardened and do not require case hardening. This property of carbon steel can be beneficial, because it gives the surface good wear characteristics but leaves the core tough.\n\n==Forging temperature of steel==\n<ref name=Mat_hand>{{cite book|last=Brady|first=George S.|title=Materials Handbook|year=1997|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-07-007084-9|edition=14th|author2=Clauser, Henry R.|author3=Vaccari A., John|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/materialshandboo14geor}}</ref> \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The steel is then quenched (heat drawn out) at a moderate to low rate allowing carbon to diffuse out of the austenite forming iron-carbide (cementite) and leaving ferrite, or at a high rate, trapping the carbon within the iron thus forming martensite. The rate at which the steel is cooled through the [[eutectoid]] temperature (about 727&nbsp;\u00b0C) affects the rate at which carbon diffuses out of austenite and forms cementite. Generally speaking, cooling swiftly will leave iron carbide finely dispersed and produce a fine grained [[pearlite]] and cooling slowly will give a coarser pearlite. Cooling a hypoeutectoid steel (less than 0.77 wt% C) results in a lamellar-pearlitic structure of iron carbide layers with \u03b1-[[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] (nearly pure iron) between. If it is hypereutectoid steel (more than 0.77 wt% C) then the structure is full pearlite with small grains (larger than the pearlite lamella) of [[cementite]] formed on the grain boundaries. A eutectoid steel (0.77% carbon) will have a pearlite structure throughout the grains with no cementite at the boundaries. The relative amounts of constituents are found using the [[lever rule]]. The following is a list of the types of heat treatments possible:\n\n*'''Spheroidizing''': Spheroidite forms when carbon steel is heated to approximately 700&nbsp;\u00b0C for over 30 hours. Spheroidite can form at lower temperatures but the time needed drastically increases, as this is a diffusion-controlled process. The result is a structure of rods or spheres of cementite within primary structure (ferrite or pearlite, depending on which side of the eutectoid you are on). The purpose is to soften higher carbon steels and allow more formability. This is the softest and most ductile form of steel. The adjacent image shows where spheroidizing usually occurs.<ref>Smith, p. 388</ref>\n*'''[[Annealing (metallurgy)|Full annealing]]''': Carbon steel is heated to approximately 40&nbsp;\u00b0C above Ac3{{?}} or Acm{{?}} for 1 hour; this ensures all the [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] transforms into [[austenite]] (although [[cementite]] might still exist if the carbon content is greater than the eutectoid). The steel must then be cooled slowly, in the realm of 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (36&nbsp;\u00b0F) per hour. Usually it is just furnace cooled, where the furnace is turned off with the steel still inside. This results in a coarse pearlitic structure, which means the \"bands\" of [[pearlite]] are thick.<ref name=Alvarenga>{{cite journal |vauthors=Alvarenga HD, Van de Putte T, Van Steenberge N, Sietsma J, Terryn H |title=Influence of Carbide Morphology and Microstructure on the Kinetics of Superficial Decarburization of C-Mn Steels |journal=Metall Mater Trans A |volume=46 |pages=123\u2013133 |date=Apr 2009 |doi=10.1007/s11661-014-2600-y }}</ref> Fully annealed steel is soft and [[ductile]], with no internal stresses, which is often necessary for cost-effective forming. Only spheroidized steel is softer and more ductile.<ref>Smith, p. 386</ref>\n*'''Process annealing''': A process used to relieve stress in a cold-worked carbon steel with less than 0.3% C. The steel is usually heated to 550\u2013650&nbsp;\u00b0C for 1 hour, but sometimes temperatures as high as 700&nbsp;\u00b0C. The image rightward{{clarify|date=June 2016}} shows the area where process annealing occurs.\n*'''Isothermal annealing''': It is a process in which hypoeutectoid steel is heated above the upper critical temperature. This temperature is maintained for a time and then reduced to below the lower critical temperature and is again maintained. It is then cooled to room temperature. This method eliminates any temperature gradient.\n*'''Normalizing''': Carbon steel is heated to approximately 55&nbsp;\u00b0C above Ac3 or Acm for 1 hour; this ensures the steel completely transforms to austenite. The steel is then air-cooled, which is a cooling rate of approximately {{convert|38|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} per minute. This results in a fine pearlitic structure, and a more-uniform structure. Normalized steel has a higher strength than annealed steel; it has a relatively high strength and hardness.<ref>Smith, pp. 386\u2013387</ref>\n*'''[[Quenching]]''': Carbon steel with at least 0.4 wt% C is heated to normalizing temperatures and then rapidly cooled (quenched) in water, brine, or oil to the critical temperature. The critical temperature is dependent on the carbon content, but as a general rule is lower as the carbon content increases. This results in a martensitic structure; a form of steel that possesses a super-saturated carbon content in a deformed body-centered cubic (BCC) crystalline structure, properly termed body-centered tetragonal (BCT), with much internal stress. Thus quenched steel is extremely hard but [[brittle]], usually too brittle for practical purposes. These internal stresses may cause stress cracks on the surface. Quenched steel is approximately three times harder (four with more carbon) than normalized steel.<ref>Smith, pp. 373\u2013377</ref>\n*'''[[Martempering]] (Marquenching)''': Martempering is not actually a tempering procedure, hence the term \"marquenching\". It is a form of isothermal heat treatment applied after an initial quench, typically in a molten salt bath, at a temperature just above the \"martensite start temperature\". At this temperature, residual stresses within the material are relieved and some bainite may be formed from the retained austenite which did not have time to transform into anything else. In industry, this is a process used to control the ductility and hardness of a material. With longer marquenching, the ductility increases with a minimal loss in strength; the steel is held in this solution until the inner and outer temperatures of the part equalize. Then the steel is cooled at a moderate speed to keep the temperature gradient minimal. Not only does this process reduce internal stresses and stress cracks, but it also increases the impact resistance.<ref>Smith, pp. 389\u2013390</ref>\n*'''[[Tempering (metallurgy)|Tempering]]''': This is the most common heat treatment encountered, because the final properties can be precisely determined by the temperature and time of the tempering. Tempering involves reheating quenched steel to a temperature below the [[eutectoid]] temperature then cooling. The elevated temperature allows very small amounts of spheroidite to form, which restores ductility, but reduces hardness. Actual temperatures and times are carefully chosen for each composition.<ref>Smith, pp. 387\u2013388</ref>\n*'''[[Austempering]]''': The austempering process is the same as martempering, except the quench is interrupted and the steel is held in the molten salt bath at temperatures between 205&nbsp;\u00b0C and 540&nbsp;\u00b0C, and then cooled at a moderate rate. The resulting steel, called bainite, produces an acicular microstructure in the steel that has great strength (but less than martensite), greater ductility, higher impact resistance, and less distortion than martensite steel. The disadvantage of austempering is it can be used only on a few steels, and it requires a special salt bath.<ref>Smith, p. 391</ref>\n\n==Case hardening==\n{{main|Case hardening}}\nCase hardening processes harden only the exterior of the steel part, creating a hard, wear resistant skin (the \"case\") but preserving a tough and ductile interior. Carbon steels are not very [[hardenability|hardenable]] meaning they can not be hardened throughout thick sections. Alloy steels have a better hardenability, so they can be through-hardened and do not require case hardening. This property of carbon steel can be beneficial, because it gives the surface good wear characteristics but leaves the core tough.\n\n==Forging temperature of steel==\n<ref name=Mat_hand>{{cite book|last=Brady|first=George S.|title=Materials Handbook|year=1997|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-07-007084-9|edition=14th|author2=Clauser, Henry R.|author3=Vaccari A., John|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/materialshandboo14geor}}</ref> \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
