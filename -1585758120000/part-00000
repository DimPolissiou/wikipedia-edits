This proved inadequate in 1938, when a large share of Mefo\u2019s five-year promissory notes fell due, so the government employed \u201chighly dubious methods\u201d where \u201cbanks were forced to buy government bonds, and the government took money from savings accounts and insurance companies\u201d in order to pay the holders of Mefo bills, due mainly to a serious government cash shortage.<ref>[[Martin Kitchen]], ''A History of Modern Germany 1800-2000, Maden, MA, Blackwell Publishing'', 2006, p. 284</ref> Meanwhile, Schacht's administration achieved a rapid decline in the unemployment rate, the largest of any country during the Great Depression.{{sfn|DeLong|1997}} By 1938 unemployment was practically extinct.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Stephen |title=Weimar and Nazi Germany |year=1996 |publisher = Heinemann |location= Oxford |isbn=043530920X |page=85}}</ref>\n\nThe main economic priority of the Nazi government, which set it apart from previous German governments, was to rearm and rebuild Germany\u2019s military in preparation for an eventual war to conquer ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\u201cliving space\u201d) in the East.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=38}} Thus, at the beginning of his rule, Hitler said that \u201cthe future of Germany depends exclusively and only on the reconstruction of the [[Wehrmacht]]. All other tasks must cede precedence to the task of rearmament\u201d and \u201cin case of conflict between the demands of the Wehrmacht and demands for other purposes, the interests of the Wehrmacht must in every case have priority.\u201d{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=38}} This policy was implemented immediately, with military expenditures quickly growing far larger than the civilian work-creation programs. As early as June 1933, military spending for the year was budgeted to be three times larger than the spending on all civilian work-creation measures in 1932 and 1933 combined.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=55}} Nazi Germany increased its military spending faster than any other state in peacetime, with the share of military spending rising from 1 percent to 10 percent of national income in the first two years of the regime alone.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=66}} Eventually, by 1944, it reached as high as 75 percent.<ref name=\"Evans, Richard J. 2008 p. 333\"/>\n\nThe first financial package for rearmament was adopted by the Nazi government in June 1933, and it was extremely ambitious. Schacht approved a figure of 35 billion Reichsmarks to be spent on military buildup over eight years.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=53}} By comparison, the entire national income of Germany in 1933 was 43 billion Reichsmarks, so the government was not merely proposing to increase military spending, but to make military production the primary focus of the national economy.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=54}} Earlier, in April, the cabinet had already agreed to release the military from the normal processes of budgetary oversight.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=54}} Germany\u2019s international treaty obligations would not allow such extensive rearmament, so Hitler withdrew from the Geneva disarmament talks and from the [[League of Nations]] in October 1933.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=56}} The German government feared that this might provoke immediate war with France at the time, but it did not. Still, the fear that war might come before Germany was prepared for it served to create a sense of urgency and reinforced the rearmament program.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=56}} The army and the navy prepared to quickly expand their capacity and manpower. Plans were made to secretly build an air force (forbidden by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]), and the army prepared to introduce conscription within two years and grow to 300,000 soldiers by 1937 (also in violation of the Treaty of Versailles).{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=57}} At first, the navy did not benefit much from these rearmament plans, because Hitler wished to fight a land war in Europe and even hoped to make an alliance with the British Empire whereby the British would retain control of the seas. However, at the insistence of Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], an expansion of the navy was also approved in 1934. This included the projected construction of 8 battleships (Versailles allowed a maximum of 6), 3 aircraft carriers, 8 cruisers (Versailles permitted 6), 48 destroyers (Versailles permitted 12), and 72 submarines (completely banned by the treaty).{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=58-59}} The unprecedented size of the military budget was impossible to hide from foreign observers, but when Hitler was asked for an explanation, he claimed that Germany was \u201cengaged only in essential maintenance and renewal expenditure.\u201d{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=59}}\n\nThe enormous military buildup was financed to a large extent through deficit spending, including Mefo bills. Between 1933 and 1939 the total revenue of the German government amounted to 62 billion Reichsmarks, whereas government expenditure (up to 60% of which consisted of rearmament costs) exceeded 101 billion, thus causing a huge deficit and rising national debt (reaching 38 billion marks in 1939).<ref name=\"bare_url\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110901034600/http://varldenshistoria.se/files/bonnier-his/pdf/SHIS_0731.pdf VarldensHistoria.se: \"Frihet, j\u00e4mlikhet och NAZISM\"] (PDF).</ref><ref>H .P.

The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=131}} As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with [[IG Farben]], guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at [[Leuna]]. Any profits in excess of that amount would be turned over to the Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=106, 117\u2013118}}\n\nIn June 1933, the \"Reinhardt Program\" for infrastructure development was introduced. It combined indirect incentives, such as tax reductions, with direct public investment in waterways, railroads and highways.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=83}} It was followed by similar initiatives resulting in great expansion of the German construction industry. Between 1933 and 1936, employment in construction rose from only 666,000 to over 2,000,000.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=84}} Cars and other forms of motorized transport became increasingly attractive to the population, and the German motor industry boomed.{{sfn|Braun|1990|pp=83\u201384}} However, Germany\u2019s attempt to achieve [[autarky]] meant imposing restrictions on foreign currency, which caused a shortage of rubber and fuel for civilian use by 1939 and resulted in \u201cdrastic restrictions on the use of motor vehicles\u201d.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=364}}\n\n===Privatization and business ties===\nThe Great Depression had spurred increased state ownership in most Western capitalist countries.

Unlike [[Italian Fascism]], Nazism perceived workers and employers in each enterprise as families; each with different roles. This was shown in their tax structure. The Nazis allowed industries to deduct from their taxable income all sums used to purchase new equipment. Rich families employing a maid were allowed to count the maid as a dependent child and reap the tax benefit.<ref>Yeadon, Glen, and John Hawkins.

Progressive Press, 2008.</ref>\n\n===Foreign trade relations===\n\nIn the 1930s, world prices for raw materials (which constituted the bulk of German imports) were on the rise. At the same time, world prices for manufactured goods (Germany's chief exports) were falling. The result was that Germany found it increasingly difficult to maintain a balance of payments. A large trade deficit seemed almost inevitable. But Hitler found this prospect unacceptable. Germany began to move away from partially free trade in the direction of economic self-sufficiency.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=86}} Hitler was aware of the fact that Germany lacked reserves of raw materials, and full [[autarky]] was therefore impossible. Thus he chose a different approach. The Nazi government tried to limit the number of its trade partners, and, when possible, only trade with countries within the German sphere of influence. A number of bilateral trade agreements were signed between Germany and other European Countries (mostly countries located in Southern and South-Eastern Europe) during the 1930s. The German government strongly encouraged trade with these countries but strongly discouraged trade with any others.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=101}}{{clarify |date=July 2016 |reason= Through what mechanism did the Nazi government succeed in intervening trade?}}\n\nBy the late 1930s, the aims of German trade policy were to use economic and political power to make the countries of Southern Europe and the Balkans dependent on Germany. The German economy would draw its raw materials from that region, and the countries in question would receive German manufactured goods in exchange.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=102}}  Germany would also leverage productive trade relationships with Spain, Switzerland and Sweden in areas ranging from iron ore imports and clearing and payment services.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Golson |first1=Eric |title=The Economics of Neutrality |url=http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/178/1/Golson_The_Economics_of_Neutrality.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>  Throughout the 1930s, German businesses were also encouraged to form cartels, monopolies and oligopolies, whose interests were then protected by the state.{{sfn|Schweitzer|1964|p=265}}\n\n===Preparations for war===\n{{main|Adolf Hitler#Rearmament and new alliances}}\nIn 1936, after years of limitations imposed by the [[Versailles Treaty]], military spending in Germany rose to 10% of [[Gross national product|GNP]], higher than any other European country at the time, and, from 1936 onwards, even higher than civilian investments.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=85}} Hitler faced a choice between conflicting recommendations. On one side a \"free market\" technocratic faction within the government, centered around ''Reichsbank'' President [[Hjalmar Schacht]], Minister of Economics [[Walther Funk]] and Price Commissioner Dr. [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]] calling for decreased military spending, free trade, and a moderation in state intervention in the economy. This faction was supported by some of Germany's leading business executives, most notably Hermann Duecher of [[AEG]], [[Robert Bosch]] of [[Robert Bosch GmbH]], and Albert Voegeler of [[Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG|Vereinigte Stahlwerke]].{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=217}} On the other side the more politicized faction favored [[autarky|autarkic]] policies and sustained military spending.{{sfn|Carr|1972|p=49-52}} Hitler hesitated before siding with the latter, which was much in line with his fundamental ideological tenets: social darwinism and ''Lebensraum'''s aggressive policies. So in August 1936, Hitler issued his \"Memorandum\" requesting from [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] a series of Year's Plans (the term \"Four-Year Plan\" was coined only later, in September) in order to mobilize the entire economy, within the next four years, and make it ready for war: maximizing autarchic policies, even at a cost for the German people, and having the armed forces fully operational and ready at the end of the four years period.<ref>[[Richard Overy|R.

No state will be able to withdraw or even remain at a distance from this historical conflict...It is not the aim of this memorandum to prophesy the time when the untenable situation in Europe will become an open crisis. I only want, in these lines, to set down my conviction that this crisis cannot and will not fail to arrive and that it is Germany's duty to secure her own existence by every means in face of this catastrophe, and to protect herself against it, and that from this compulsion there arises a series of conclusions relating to the most important tasks that our people have ever been set. For a victory of Bolshevism over Germany would not lead to a Versailles treaty, but to the final destruction, indeed the annihilation of the German people...I consider it necessary for the ''Reichstag'' to pass the following two laws: 1) A law providing the death penalty for economic sabotage and 2) A law making the whole of Jewry liable for all damage inflicted by individual specimens of this community of criminals upon the German economy, and thus upon the German people.{{sfn|Dawidowicz|1976|p=32}} }} Hitler called for Germany to have the world's \"first army\" in terms of fighting power within the next four years and that \"the extent of the military development of our resources ''cannot be too large, nor its pace too swift''\" [italics in the original] and the role of the economy was simply to support \"Germany's self-assertion and the extension of her ''Lebensraum''\".<ref>[[Manfred Messerschmidt|Messerschmidt, Manfred]] \"Foreign Policy and Preparation for War\" from ''[[Germany and the Second World War]]'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990 pages 623\u2013624</ref><ref>[[Richard Overy|R. J. Overy]], \"Misjudging Hitler\" from ''The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered'' edited by Gordon Martel Routledge: London, United Kingdom, 1999 page 103</ref> Hitler went on to write that given the magnitude of the coming struggle that the concerns expressed by members of the \"free market\" faction like Schacht and Goerdeler that the current level of military spending was bankrupting Germany were irrelevant. Hitler wrote that: \"However well balanced the general pattern of a nation's life ought to be, there must at particular times be certain disturbances of the balance at the expense of other less vital tasks. If we do not succeed in bringing the German army as rapidly as possible to the rank of premier army in the world...then Germany will be lost!\"{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=220}} and \"The nation does not live for the economy, for economic leaders, or for economic or financial theories; on the contrary, it is finance and the economy, economic leaders and theories, which all owe unqualified service in this struggle for the self-assertion of our nation\".{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=220}}\n\nGermany had already been rapidly rearming and militarizing before 1936. However, it was in his memorandum of 1936 that Hitler made it clear he expected war to be imminent. He argued that the German economy \u201cmust be fit for war within four years.\u201d{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=357}} [[Autarky]] was to be pursued more aggressively, and the German people would have to begin making sacrifices in their consumption habits in order to enable food supplies and raw materials to be diverted towards military uses.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=357}} Speaking to a meeting of his main economic advisers in 1937, Hitler insisted that Germany\u2019s population had grown to the point where the nation would soon become unable to feed itself, so war for the conquest of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' in Eastern Europe was necessary as soon as possible. Therefore, if the rearmament drive caused economic problems, the response would have to entail pushing even harder in order to be ready for war faster, rather than scaling back military spending.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=359-360}} Seeing that Hitler had taken this stance, Schacht resigned as Minister of Economics in November 1937, and the management of the economy effectively passed to Hermann G\u00f6ring.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=360}}\n\nIn July 1937, the [[Reichswerke Hermann G\u00f6ring]] was established as a new industrial [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] to extract and process domestic [[iron ore]]s from [[Salzgitter]], as the first step in a general effort to increase German steel production in preparation for war.{{sfn|Overy|1994|pp=98}} Later, during the war, the ''Reichswerke'' would expand by incorporating much of the heavy industry of occupied nations, including between 50 and 60 per cent of Czech heavy industries and slightly less in Austria.{{sfn|Overy|1994|pp=155}} By the end of 1941, the ''Reichswerke'' had become the largest company in Europe, after absorbing most of the industry captured by Germany from the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Overy|1994|pp=158-159}}\n\n===Assessments of historical knowledge===\nA major historiographical debate about the relationship between the German prewar economy and foreign policy decision-making was prompted in the late 1980s, when historian [[Timothy Mason]] claimed that an economic crisis had caused a \"flight into war\" in 1939. Mason argued that the German working-class was opposed to the Nazi dictatorship in the over-heated German economy of the late 1930s.<ref name=\"Perry pages 780-781\">Perry, Matt \"Mason, Timothy\" pages 780-781 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'' edited by Kelly Boyd, Volume 2, London: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishing, 1999 page 780</ref> However, Mason\u2019s thesis was opposed by historian [[Richard Overy]] who wrote that Germany's economic problems could not explain aggression against [[Poland]] and that the reasons for the outbreak of war were due to the [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|ideological choices]] made by the Nazi leadership. For Overy, the problem with Mason's thesis was that it rested on the assumptions not shown by records.<ref>Mason, Tim & Overy, R.J. \"Debate: Germany, `domestic crisis\u2019 and the war in 1939\" from ''The Origins of The Second World War'' edited by Patrick Finney, Edward Arnold: London, United Kingdom, 1997, p.102.</ref> Overy argued that there was a difference between economic pressures induced by the problems of the [[Four Year Plan]], and economic motives to seize foreign industry, materials and reserves of neighboring states.<ref>[[Richard Overy|R.

Petroleum, sugar, coffee, chocolate and cotton were all extremely scarce. Germany used [[coal gasification]] to replace petroleum imports to a limited extent, and relied on Romanian oilfields at [[Ploiesti]]. Germany was dependent on Sweden for the majority of their iron ore production, and relied on Spain and Portugal to provide tungsten. Switzerland continued to trade with Germany, and was very useful as a neutral country friendly to Germany. Until the declaration of war on the Soviet Union, the Third Reich [[German\u2013Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|received]] large supplies of grain and raw materials from the [[USSR]], which they paid for with industrial machinery, weapons, and even German designs for a battleship. In the spring of 1940, the Soviet Union asked for two chemical plants as compensation for raw materials. The German government declined, at the insistence of the military.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=422}}\n\n[[Rationing]] was introduced for German consumers in 1939. However, while Britain immediately put their economy on a war footing as soon as the conflict began, Germany resisted equivalent measures until later in the war. For instance, the Nazis were reluctant to increase taxes on individual German citizens to pay for the war, so the top [[personal income tax]] rate in 1941 was 13.7% in Germany, as opposed to 23.7% in Great Britain.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=114}} The German government instead funded much of its military effort through plunder, especially plundering the wealth of Jewish citizens and the like, both at home and in the conquered territories.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/8119805/Confiscated-Jewish-wealth-helped-fund-the-German-war-effort.html|title=Confiscated Jewish wealth 'helped fund the German war effort'|first=Allan|last=Hall|date=November 9, 2010|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Use of conquered territories===\nDuring the war, as Germany acquired new territories (either by direct annexation or by installing puppet governments in defeated countries), these new territories were forced to sell raw materials and agricultural products to German buyers at extremely low prices. Hitler's policy of [[lebensraum]] strongly emphasized the conquest of new lands in the East, and the exploitation of these lands to provide cheap goods to Germany. In practice, however, the intensity of the fighting on the Eastern Front and the Soviet [[scorched earth]] policy meant that the Germans found little they could use, and, on the other hand, a large quantity of goods flowed into Germany from conquered lands in the West. For example, two-thirds of all French trains in 1941 were used to carry goods to Germany. Norway lost 20% of its national income in 1940 and 40% in 1943.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=121}}\n\n[[Fiscal policy]] was also directed towards exploitation of conquered countries, from which [[Financial capital|capital]] was to be gathered for German investments. German-run banks, such as [[Bank Emisyjny w Polsce]], were created to manage local economies.<ref name=gojski>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbp.pl/publikacje/bank_i_kredyt/2004_08/gojski.pdf |title=Etapy i cele niemieckiej polityki bankowej w GG.

Agricultural supply chains collapsed, partly due to wartime destruction and partly due to the British blockade that prevented the import of fertilizer and other raw materials from outside of Europe.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=418-419}} The grain harvest in France in 1940 was less than half what it had been in 1938. Grain yields also fell (compared to their pre-war levels) in Germany itself, as well as in Hungary and the occupied Netherlands and Yugoslavia. German grain imports from Yugoslavia and Hungary fell by almost 3 million tons, and this could only be partially offset by increased deliveries from Romania.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=419}} Coal and oil were also in short supply, again because Germany could not access sources outside of Europe. Germany's oil supplies, crucial for the war effort, depended largely on annual imports of 1.5 million tons of oil, mainly from Romania.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=411}} Although Germany seized the oil supplies of conquered states \u2013 for example reducing France to a mere 8 percent of its pre-war oil consumption \u2013 this was still not enough for the needs of the war.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=411}} Acute fuel shortages forced the German military to cut back on training for its drivers and pilots, because training would be a waste of fuel.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=412}} The Soviets and the Americans had accurate reports of Germany\u2019s oil supplies, but refused to believe that the Nazi government would take the risk of starting a war with so little fuel security, so they assumed that Germany must have had vast amounts of well-hidden supplies that they were not able to detect.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=412}} Germany also had a problem with coal, although in this case the issue was not a lack of quantity, but an inability to extract it and transport it where it was needed fast enough. Railways had been badly damaged by the war, and coal miners in occupied territories drastically reduced their productivity compared to pre-war levels. This was, in part, intentional sabotage on the part of the miners, who wished to harm the German war effort. But it was also in part due to lack of adequate nutrition for those miners, as food from their countries was redirected to Germany.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=413-415}}\n\nIn 1942, after the death of Armaments Minister [[Fritz Todt]], Hitler appointed [[Albert Speer]] as his replacement. Historians have long contended that the growing burdens of the war saw Germany move to a full [[war economy]] under the efficient<ref>for a critical assessment of Speer's performance see, however, Tooze 2006, 552ff.</ref> leadership of Speer. However historian Richard Overy contends this is a myth based on the flimsy conclusions of the [[Strategic Bombing Survey]], which relied on the views of one German official from the German Statistical Office, Ralf Wagenfuhr. Wagenfuhr was not senior enough to be aware of decision making at higher levels. Overy shows that the military and Nazi leadership were particular about preparing the economy for total war as they felt that World War I was lost on the Home Front.<ref>[[Richard Overy|Overy, Richard]] (1994) ''War and Economy in the Third Reich''.

Civilian factories were converted to military use and placed under military administration. From mid 1943 on, Germany switched to a full war economy overseen by [[Albert Speer]]. By late 1944, almost the entire German economy was dedicated to military production. The result was a dramatic rise in military production, with an increase by 2 to 3 times of vital goods like tanks and aircraft, despite the intensifying Allied air campaign and the loss of territory and factories. Restaurants and other services were closed to focus the German economy on military needs. With the exception of ammunition for the army, the increase in production was insufficient to match the Allies in any category of production. Some production was moved underground in an attempt to put it out of reach of Allied bombers.\n\nFrom late 1944 on, Allied bombings were destroying German factories and cities at a rapid pace, leading to the final collapse of the German war economy in 1945 ([[Stunde Null]]). Food became drastically scarce. Synthetic fuel production dropped by 86% in eight months, explosive output was reduced by 42% and the loss of tank output was 35%.<ref>Webster and Frankland,''The Strategic Air Offensive against Germany 1939-1945, Volume IV'' page 516</ref> The Allied bombing campaign also tied up valuable manpower, with [[Albert Speer]] (Germany's Minister of Armaments) estimating that in the summer of 1944 between 200,000 and 300,000 men were permanently employed in repairing oil installations and placing oil production underground.<ref>[[Richard Overy|R.

Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany'', New York, NY, Simon & Schuster, 2011, p. 260</ref> When the notes were presented for payment, the Reichsbank printed money. This proved inadequate in 1938, when a large share of Mefo\u2019s five-year promissory notes fell due, so the government employed \u201chighly dubious methods\u201d where \u201cbanks were forced to buy government bonds, and the government took money from savings accounts and insurance companies\u201d in order to pay the holders of Mefo bills, due mainly to a serious government cash shortage.<ref>[[Martin Kitchen]], ''A History of Modern Germany 1800-2000, Maden, MA, Blackwell Publishing'', 2006, p. 284</ref> Meanwhile, Schacht's administration achieved a rapid decline in the unemployment rate, the largest of any country during the Great Depression.{{sfn|DeLong|1997}} By 1938 unemployment was practically extinct.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Stephen |title=Weimar and Nazi Germany |year=1996 |publisher = Heinemann |location= Oxford |isbn=043530920X |page=85}}</ref>\n\nThe main economic priority of the Nazi government, which set it apart from previous German governments, was to rearm and rebuild Germany\u2019s military in preparation for an eventual war to conquer ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\u201cliving space\u201d) in the East.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=38}} Thus, at the beginning of his rule, Hitler said that \u201cthe future of Germany depends exclusively and only on the reconstruction of the [[Wehrmacht]]. All other tasks must cede precedence to the task of rearmament\u201d and \u201cin case of conflict between the demands of the Wehrmacht and demands for other purposes, the interests of the Wehrmacht must in every case have priority.\u201d{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=38}} This policy was implemented immediately, with military expenditures quickly growing far larger than the civilian work-creation programs. As early as June 1933, military spending for the year was budgeted to be three times larger than the spending on all civilian work-creation measures in 1932 and 1933 combined.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=55}} Nazi Germany increased its military spending faster than any other state in peacetime, with the share of military spending rising from 1 percent to 10 percent of national income in the first two years of the regime alone.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=66}} Eventually, by 1944, it reached as high as 75 percent.<ref name=\"Evans, Richard J. 2008 p. 333\"/>\n\nThe first financial package for rearmament was adopted by the Nazi government in June 1933, and it was extremely ambitious. Schacht approved a figure of 35 billion Reichsmarks to be spent on military buildup over eight years.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=53}} By comparison, the entire national income of Germany in 1933 was 43 billion Reichsmarks, so the government was not merely proposing to increase military spending, but to make military production the primary focus of the national economy.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=54}} Earlier, in April, the cabinet had already agreed to release the military from the normal processes of budgetary oversight.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=54}} Germany\u2019s international treaty obligations would not allow such extensive rearmament, so Hitler withdrew from the Geneva disarmament talks and from the [[League of Nations]] in October 1933.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=56}} The German government feared that this might provoke immediate war with France at the time, but it did not. Still, the fear that war might come before Germany was prepared for it served to create a sense of urgency and reinforced the rearmament program.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=56}} The army and the navy prepared to quickly expand their capacity and manpower. Plans were made to secretly build an air force (forbidden by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]), and the army prepared to introduce conscription within two years and grow to 300,000 soldiers by 1937 (also in violation of the Treaty of Versailles).{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=57}} At first, the navy did not benefit much from these rearmament plans, because Hitler wished to fight a land war in Europe and even hoped to make an alliance with the British Empire whereby the British would retain control of the seas. However, at the insistence of Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], an expansion of the navy was also approved in 1934.

At the same time, world prices for manufactured goods (Germany's chief exports) were falling. The result was that Germany found it increasingly difficult to maintain a balance of payments. A large trade deficit seemed almost inevitable. But Hitler found this prospect unacceptable. Germany began to move away from partially free trade in the direction of economic self-sufficiency.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=86}} Hitler was aware of the fact that Germany lacked reserves of raw materials, and full [[autarky]] was therefore impossible. Thus he chose a different approach. The Nazi government tried to limit the number of its trade partners, and, when possible, only trade with countries within the German sphere of influence. A number of bilateral trade agreements were signed between Germany and other European Countries (mostly countries located in Southern and South-Eastern Europe) during the 1930s. The German government strongly encouraged trade with these countries but strongly discouraged trade with any others.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=101}}{{clarify |date=July 2016 |reason= Through what mechanism did the Nazi government succeed in intervening trade?}}\n\nBy the late 1930s, the aims of German trade policy were to use economic and political power to make the countries of Southern Europe and the Balkans dependent on Germany. The German economy would draw its raw materials from that region, and the countries in question would receive German manufactured goods in exchange.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=102}}  Germany would also leverage productive trade relationships with Spain, Switzerland and Sweden in areas ranging from iron ore imports and clearing and payment services.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Golson |first1=Eric |title=The Economics of Neutrality |url=http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/178/1/Golson_The_Economics_of_Neutrality.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>  Throughout the 1930s, German businesses were also encouraged to form cartels, monopolies and oligopolies, whose interests were then protected by the state.{{sfn|Schweitzer|1964|p=265}}\n\n===Preparations for war===\n{{main|Adolf Hitler#Rearmament and new alliances}}\nIn 1936, after years of limitations imposed by the [[Versailles Treaty]], military spending in Germany rose to 10% of [[Gross national product|GNP]], higher than any other European country at the time, and, from 1936 onwards, even higher than civilian investments.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=85}} Hitler faced a choice between conflicting recommendations. On one side a \"free market\" technocratic faction within the government, centered around ''Reichsbank'' President [[Hjalmar Schacht]], Minister of Economics [[Walther Funk]] and Price Commissioner Dr. [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]] calling for decreased military spending, free trade, and a moderation in state intervention in the economy. This faction was supported by some of Germany's leading business executives, most notably Hermann Duecher of [[AEG]], [[Robert Bosch]] of [[Robert Bosch GmbH]], and Albert Voegeler of [[Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG|Vereinigte Stahlwerke]].{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=217}} On the other side the more politicized faction favored [[autarky|autarkic]] policies and sustained military spending.{{sfn|Carr|1972|p=49-52}} Hitler hesitated before siding with the latter, which was much in line with his fundamental ideological tenets: social darwinism and ''Lebensraum'''s aggressive policies. So in August 1936, Hitler issued his \"Memorandum\" requesting from [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] a series of Year's Plans (the term \"Four-Year Plan\" was coined only later, in September) in order to mobilize the entire economy, within the next four years, and make it ready for war: maximizing autarchic policies, even at a cost for the German people, and having the armed forces fully operational and ready at the end of the four years period.<ref>[[Richard Overy|R.

For a victory of Bolshevism over Germany would not lead to a Versailles treaty, but to the final destruction, indeed the annihilation of the German people...I consider it necessary for the ''Reichstag'' to pass the following two laws: 1) A law providing the death penalty for economic sabotage and 2) A law making the whole of Jewry liable for all damage inflicted by individual specimens of this community of criminals upon the German economy, and thus upon the German people.{{sfn|Dawidowicz|1976|p=32}} }} Hitler called for Germany to have the world's \"first army\" in terms of fighting power within the next four years and that \"the extent of the military development of our resources ''cannot be too large, nor its pace too swift''\" [italics in the original] and the role of the economy was simply to support \"Germany's self-assertion and the extension of her ''Lebensraum''\".<ref>[[Manfred Messerschmidt|Messerschmidt, Manfred]] \"Foreign Policy and Preparation for War\" from ''[[Germany and the Second World War]]'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990 pages 623\u2013624</ref><ref>[[Richard Overy|R. J. Overy]], \"Misjudging Hitler\" from ''The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered'' edited by Gordon Martel Routledge: London, United Kingdom, 1999 page 103</ref> Hitler went on to write that given the magnitude of the coming struggle that the concerns expressed by members of the \"free market\" faction like Schacht and Goerdeler that the current level of military spending was bankrupting Germany were irrelevant. Hitler wrote that: \"However well balanced the general pattern of a nation's life ought to be, there must at particular times be certain disturbances of the balance at the expense of other less vital tasks. If we do not succeed in bringing the German army as rapidly as possible to the rank of premier army in the world...then Germany will be lost!\"{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=220}} and \"The nation does not live for the economy, for economic leaders, or for economic or financial theories; on the contrary, it is finance and the economy, economic leaders and theories, which all owe unqualified service in this struggle for the self-assertion of our nation\".{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=220}}\n\nGermany had already been rapidly rearming and militarizing before 1936. However, it was in his memorandum of 1936 that Hitler made it clear he expected war to be imminent. He argued that the German economy \u201cmust be fit for war within four years.\u201d{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=357}} [[Autarky]] was to be pursued more aggressively, and the German people would have to begin making sacrifices in their consumption habits in order to enable food supplies and raw materials to be diverted towards military uses.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=357}} Speaking to a meeting of his main economic advisers in 1937, Hitler insisted that Germany\u2019s population had grown to the point where the nation would soon become unable to feed itself, so war for the conquest of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' in Eastern Europe was necessary as soon as possible. Therefore, if the rearmament drive caused economic problems, the response would have to entail pushing even harder in order to be ready for war faster, rather than scaling back military spending.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=359-360}} Seeing that Hitler had taken this stance, Schacht resigned as Minister of Economics in November 1937, and the management of the economy effectively passed to Hermann G\u00f6ring.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=360}}\n\nIn July 1937, the [[Reichswerke Hermann G\u00f6ring]] was established as a new industrial [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] to extract and process domestic [[iron ore]]s from [[Salzgitter]], as the first step in a general effort to increase German steel production in preparation for war.{{sfn|Overy|1994|pp=98}} Later, during the war, the ''Reichswerke'' would expand by incorporating much of the heavy industry of occupied nations, including between 50 and 60 per cent of Czech heavy industries and slightly less in Austria.{{sfn|Overy|1994|pp=155}} By the end of 1941, the ''Reichswerke'' had become the largest company in Europe, after absorbing most of the industry captured by Germany from the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Overy|1994|pp=158-159}}\n\n===Assessments of historical knowledge===\nA major historiographical debate about the relationship between the German prewar economy and foreign policy decision-making was prompted in the late 1980s, when historian [[Timothy Mason]] claimed that an economic crisis had caused a \"flight into war\" in 1939. Mason argued that the German working-class was opposed to the Nazi dictatorship in the over-heated German economy of the late 1930s.<ref name=\"Perry pages 780-781\">Perry, Matt \"Mason, Timothy\" pages 780-781 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'' edited by Kelly Boyd, Volume 2, London: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishing, 1999 page 780</ref> However, Mason\u2019s thesis was opposed by historian [[Richard Overy]] who wrote that Germany's economic problems could not explain aggression against [[Poland]] and that the reasons for the outbreak of war were due to the [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|ideological choices]] made by the Nazi leadership. For Overy, the problem with Mason's thesis was that it rested on the assumptions not shown by records.<ref>Mason, Tim & Overy, R.J. \"Debate: Germany, `domestic crisis\u2019 and the war in 1939\" from ''The Origins of The Second World War'' edited by Patrick Finney, Edward Arnold: London, United Kingdom, 1997, p.102.</ref> Overy argued that there was a difference between economic pressures induced by the problems of the [[Four Year Plan]], and economic motives to seize foreign industry, materials and reserves of neighboring states.<ref>[[Richard Overy|R.

Overy]], \"Germany, \u2018Domestic Crisis\u2019 and War in 1939\" from ''The Third Reich'' edited by Christian Leitz Blackwell: Oxford, 1999 pp.117-118.</ref> Meanwhile, [[Adam Tooze]] argued that from 1939 onwards, in spite of the military successes in the West, the German economy became dependent on vital imports from the East.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=420}} Tooze saw this as a reason for Hitler to attack the Soviet Union, because \"[t]he Third Reich had no intention of slipping into that kind of humbling dependence that Britain now occupied in relation to the United States, mortgaging its assets and selling its secrets, simply to sustain its war effort\".{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=422}} Up to [[Operation Barbarossa]] the German economy could not \"do without Soviet deliveries of oil, grain, and alloy metals.\"<ref>Ericson, Edward E.

Petroleum, sugar, coffee, chocolate and cotton were all extremely scarce. Germany used [[coal gasification]] to replace petroleum imports to a limited extent, and relied on Romanian oilfields at [[Ploiesti]]. Germany was dependent on Sweden for the majority of their iron ore production, and relied on Spain and Portugal to provide tungsten. Switzerland continued to trade with Germany, and was very useful as a neutral country friendly to Germany. Until the declaration of war on the Soviet Union, the Third Reich [[German\u2013Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|received]] large supplies of grain and raw materials from the [[USSR]], which they paid for with industrial machinery, weapons, and even German designs for a battleship. In the spring of 1940, the Soviet Union asked for two chemical plants as compensation for raw materials. The German government declined, at the insistence of the military.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=422}}\n\n[[Rationing]] was introduced for German consumers in 1939. However, while Britain immediately put their economy on a war footing as soon as the conflict began, Germany resisted equivalent measures until later in the war. For instance, the Nazis were reluctant to increase taxes on individual German citizens to pay for the war, so the top [[personal income tax]] rate in 1941 was 13.7% in Germany, as opposed to 23.7% in Great Britain.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=114}} The German government instead funded much of its military effort through plunder, especially plundering the wealth of Jewish citizens and the like, both at home and in the conquered territories.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/8119805/Confiscated-Jewish-wealth-helped-fund-the-German-war-effort.html|title=Confiscated Jewish wealth 'helped fund the German war effort'|first=Allan|last=Hall|date=November 9, 2010|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Use of conquered territories===\nDuring the war, as Germany acquired new territories (either by direct annexation or by installing puppet governments in defeated countries), these new territories were forced to sell raw materials and agricultural products to German buyers at extremely low prices. Hitler's policy of [[lebensraum]] strongly emphasized the conquest of new lands in the East, and the exploitation of these lands to provide cheap goods to Germany. In practice, however, the intensity of the fighting on the Eastern Front and the Soviet [[scorched earth]] policy meant that the Germans found little they could use, and, on the other hand, a large quantity of goods flowed into Germany from conquered lands in the West. For example, two-thirds of all French trains in 1941 were used to carry goods to Germany. Norway lost 20% of its national income in 1940 and 40% in 1943.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=121}}\n\n[[Fiscal policy]] was also directed towards exploitation of conquered countries, from which [[Financial capital|capital]] was to be gathered for German investments. German-run banks, such as [[Bank Emisyjny w Polsce]], were created to manage local economies.<ref name=gojski>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbp.pl/publikacje/bank_i_kredyt/2004_08/gojski.pdf |title=Etapy i cele niemieckiej polityki bankowej w GG.

Agricultural supply chains collapsed, partly due to wartime destruction and partly due to the British blockade that prevented the import of fertilizer and other raw materials from outside of Europe.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=418-419}} The grain harvest in France in 1940 was less than half what it had been in 1938. Grain yields also fell (compared to their pre-war levels) in Germany itself, as well as in Hungary and the occupied Netherlands and Yugoslavia. German grain imports from Yugoslavia and Hungary fell by almost 3 million tons, and this could only be partially offset by increased deliveries from Romania.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=419}} Coal and oil were also in short supply, again because Germany could not access sources outside of Europe. Germany's oil supplies, crucial for the war effort, depended largely on annual imports of 1.5 million tons of oil, mainly from Romania.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=411}} Although Germany seized the oil supplies of conquered states \u2013 for example reducing France to a mere 8 percent of its pre-war oil consumption \u2013 this was still not enough for the needs of the war.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=411}} Acute fuel shortages forced the German military to cut back on training for its drivers and pilots, because training would be a waste of fuel.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=412}} The Soviets and the Americans had accurate reports of Germany\u2019s oil supplies, but refused to believe that the Nazi government would take the risk of starting a war with so little fuel security, so they assumed that Germany must have had vast amounts of well-hidden supplies that they were not able to detect.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=412}} Germany also had a problem with coal, although in this case the issue was not a lack of quantity, but an inability to extract it and transport it where it was needed fast enough. Railways had been badly damaged by the war, and coal miners in occupied territories drastically reduced their productivity compared to pre-war levels. This was, in part, intentional sabotage on the part of the miners, who wished to harm the German war effort. But it was also in part due to lack of adequate nutrition for those miners, as food from their countries was redirected to Germany.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=413-415}}\n\nIn 1942, after the death of Armaments Minister [[Fritz Todt]], Hitler appointed [[Albert Speer]] as his replacement. Historians have long contended that the growing burdens of the war saw Germany move to a full [[war economy]] under the efficient<ref>for a critical assessment of Speer's performance see, however, Tooze 2006, 552ff.</ref> leadership of Speer. However historian Richard Overy contends this is a myth based on the flimsy conclusions of the [[Strategic Bombing Survey]], which relied on the views of one German official from the German Statistical Office, Ralf Wagenfuhr. Wagenfuhr was not senior enough to be aware of decision making at higher levels. Overy shows that the military and Nazi leadership were particular about preparing the economy for total war as they felt that World War I was lost on the Home Front.<ref>[[Richard Overy|Overy, Richard]] (1994) ''War and Economy in the Third Reich''.

[[Prisoner of war|Prisoners of war]] and civilians were brought into Germany from occupied territories after the German [[invasion of Poland]]. The necessary labour for the German war economy was provided by the new camp system, serving as one of the key instruments of terror.

Civilian factories were converted to military use and placed under military administration. From mid 1943 on, Germany switched to a full war economy overseen by [[Albert Speer]]. By late 1944, almost the entire German economy was dedicated to military production. The result was a dramatic rise in military production, with an increase by 2 to 3 times of vital goods like tanks and aircraft, despite the intensifying Allied air campaign and the loss of territory and factories. Restaurants and other services were closed to focus the German economy on military needs. With the exception of ammunition for the army, the increase in production was insufficient to match the Allies in any category of production. Some production was moved underground in an attempt to put it out of reach of Allied bombers.\n\nFrom late 1944 on, Allied bombings were destroying German factories and cities at a rapid pace, leading to the final collapse of the German war economy in 1945 ([[Stunde Null]]). Food became drastically scarce. Synthetic fuel production dropped by 86% in eight months, explosive output was reduced by 42% and the loss of tank output was 35%.<ref>Webster and Frankland,''The Strategic Air Offensive against Germany 1939-1945, Volume IV'' page 516</ref> The Allied bombing campaign also tied up valuable manpower, with [[Albert Speer]] (Germany's Minister of Armaments) estimating that in the summer of 1944 between 200,000 and 300,000 men were permanently employed in repairing oil installations and placing oil production underground.<ref>[[Richard Overy|R.

This name is contained in at least one inscription, namely, the [[Mantyasih]] inscription written in 907 CE.\n\nIn 1222, [[Ken Arok]] founded the [[Singhasari|Kingdom of Singhasari]], which he ruled until 1292. Before coming to power, Ken Arok seized power in Tumapel (Kediri) from Tungul Ametung. Ken Arok dynasty's descendants became kings of Singhasari and [[Majapahit]] from the 13th until the 15th century.\n\nIn 1227, [[Anusapati]] killed Ken Arok, and later became king of Singasari. Anusapati's power only lasted 20 years, before he was killed by Tohjaya. Three years later, Tohjaya was killed in the uprising led by Jaya Wisnuwardhana, son of Anusapati. In 1268, Wisnuwardhana died, and he was succeeded by Kertanegara (1268-1292). In 1292 Kertanegara was defeated by a rebel named Jayakatwang, ending the power of Kertanegara power and the history of Singhasari.\n\nIn 1293, [[Kublai Khan]], founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]], sent a large invasion fleet to Java with 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers, beginning the [[Mongol invasion of Java]].<ref>{{citation|last=Weatherford|first=Jack|title=Genghis khan and the making of the modern world|page=239|year=2004|location=New York|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-609-80964-4}}</ref> This was a [[punitive expedition]] against King [[Kertanegara]] of [[Singhasari]], who had refused to pay tribute to the Yuan and maimed one of its ministers. However, it ended with failure for the [[Mongols]].\n\nIn 1294, the Kingdom of Majapahit was founded. Its founder was Raden Wijaya. Majapahit reached its peak during the reign of [[Hayam Wuruk]]. He was accompanied by the mahapatih [[Gajah Mada]]. Together they managed to unite the vast territory under the name Dwipantara. Majaphit later developed to become one of the strongest empire in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn 1357, the Bubat event occurred, the war between the King of Sunda and the Majapahit Patih Gajah Mada. This event stems from the desire to take the king Hayam Wuruk Sundanese princess named Dyah Pitaloka as queen. However, because of a misunderstanding about the procedure of marriage, the plan led to a battle in Bubat. Majapahit troops, under the command of Gajah Mada defeated Pajajaran. In 1389, Hayam Wuruk died, and was succeeded by Wikramawardhana. This resulted in the beginning of the decline of the Majapahit Empire. As the Majapahit Empire went into decline in the late 1300s, Islam moved to fill the vacuum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/East-Java|title=East Java {{!}} province, Indonesia|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-03-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Islamic era ===\n{{Main|Spread of Islam in Indonesia}}\n[[File:Ampel Mosque in 2008.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ampel Mosque]] in [[Surabaya]] is the [[List of the oldest mosques|oldest surviving mosque]] in [[Java]], and second oldest in [[Indonesia]].

However, according to some experts, it is estimated that Islam entered Java around the 11th century with evidence of the tomb of Fatimah Binti Maimun in the village of Leran in [[Gresik Regency]] which dates from 475 AH (1085 AD). The tomb also shows that in the 11th century the North coast of Java had begun to be frequented by [[Arabs|Arab]] traders from the Middle East.

After the failure of the treaty, the Portuguese presence was then limited to Malacca in the [[Malay Peninsula]] and the [[Maluku Islands]].

In Blitar, an uprising by [[Pembela Tanah Air|PETA]] (Defenders of the Homeland) led by Supriyadi, Moeradi, Halir Mangkudijoyo, and Soemarto occurred in early 1945, but it was crushed by the Japanese.\n\nTwo weeks after the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclamation of independence]], Surabaya established its own government in the shape of a resident, R. Sudirman. The formation of government in Surabaya caused disputes between the republican forces and Japanese troops, resulting in various skirmishes across the city. This was because when the Japanese surrendered, they were obliged to remain in power until the allied forces arrived. The arrival of Allied forces in Surabaya created tensions with the newly established government of Indonesia, reaching  peak on 10 November 1945 where a major [[Battle of Surabaya|battle]] between the Surabayan residents led by [[Sutomo]] and Allied forces.\n\nThe battle forced the governor, Suryo, on the advice of People's Security Army (TKR), to move the seat of the government to the Mojokerto area. A week later, the government retreated again to a more secure location in Kediri. However, security situation Kediri worsen until finally, in February 1947, the East Java provincial government fled to Malang. While the administration was based in Malang, Gobvernor Suryo was replaced by R.P. Suroso, who was in turn replaced again by Dr. Moerdjani. On 21 July 1947, although still bound by the [[Linggadjati Agreement]] and a ceasefire agreement in effect since 14 October 1946, the Dutch commenced a military action, [[Operation Product]], which led to deteriorating security conditions in Malang. The East Java provincial government finally moved again to Blitar.\n\nThis military action ended after the [[Renville Agreement]]. However, this agreement had negative consequences for East Java, namely, a reduction in the territory controlled by the East Java provincial government. The Netherlands then turned the areas under its control into new states, such as the [[State of Madura]] and the State of East Java. Amid the difficulties faced by the government of Indonesia, a left-wing opposition group, ''Front Demokrasi Rakyat'' (FDR, People's Democratic Front) launched rebellion in Madiun on 18 September 1948, which is known as the [[Madiun Affair]]. However, eventually this revolt was defeated by the [[Indonesian Army]]. On 19 December 1948, the Dutch launched [[Operation Kraai]]. Blitar, which  the seat of the East Java provincial government was attacked by the Dutch. Governor Dr. Moerdjani and his staff were forced to flee and joined the guerrillas on the slopes of Mount Willis. Operation Kraai ended after the [[Roem\u2013van Roijen Agreement]] on 7 May 1949.\n\nFollowing the [[Dutch\u2013Indonesian Round Table Conference]], at which the Netherlands agreed to transfer sovereignty to the [[United States of Indonesia]], the Dutch withdrew its troops from East Java. East Java changed its status from a province into a [[State of East Java|state]]. However, on 25 February 1950, this was dissolved and became part of the territory of the [[Republic of Indonesia (1949\u201350)|Republic of Indonesia]]. The [[State of Madura]] also decided to join Indonesia.\n\n=== Contemporary era ===\nAlong with rapid growth of urbanization in East Java, the governments could not satisfy the population's needs for affordable housing, which led to the building of [[shanty towns]] along the rivers and rail tracks. Today, the shanty towns still exist; although some have been transformed into \u201cbetter\u201d housing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://republika.co.id/berita/nasional/daerah/17/02/10/ol4fs9284-kota-malang-masih-hadapi-permukiman-kumuh|title=Kota Malang Masih Hadapi Permukiman Kumuh|date=2017-02-10|website=Republika Online|language=id|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316175230/https://republika.co.id/berita/nasional/daerah/17/02/10/ol4fs9284-kota-malang-masih-hadapi-permukiman-kumuh|archive-date=2018-03-16|url-status=|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>\n\nEast Java has twice hosted the [[National Sports Week (Indonesia)|National Sports Week]] (PON), namely PON VII in 1969, and PON XV in 2000, and became the overall champion of PON in 2000, and 2008.

The length of the east-west stretch of about 400&nbsp;km. The width of the stretch of the north-south in the west about 200&nbsp;km, but in the eastern part of narrower by about 60&nbsp;km. [[Madura]] is the largest island in East Java, separated from the mainland Java by the [[Strait of Madura]]. [[Bawean Island]] is located about 150&nbsp;km north of Java. In the east of Madura there are a cluster of islands, the easternmost is [[Kangean Island]] and the northernmost is Masalembu Islands. In the southern part there are two small islands namely Nusa Barong and Sempu Island.\n\n===Geology===\nIn physiographic of geology, East Java Province can be grouped into three zones: the southern zone (plato), the middle zone (volcanic), and the northern zone (folds). Lowlands and highlands in the middle (of Ngawi, Blitar, Malang, to Bondowoso) has a fairly fertile soil. In the northern part ( Bojonegoro, Tuban, Gresik, to Madura Island) lies the Kapur Utara mountains and the Kendeng mountains which are relatively barren.\nIn the middle of the province stretch  mountain ranges and volcanoes: On the border with Central Java is [[Mount Lawu]] (3,265 metres). Southeast from Madiun is [[Mount Wilis]] (2,169 metres), and Mount Liman (2,563 metres). In the middle of the corridor lies the Anjasmoro mountains with peaks [[Arjuno-Welirang|Mount Arjuno]] (3,339 metres), Mount Welirang (3,156 metres), Mount Anjasmoro (2,277 metres), Mount Kawi (2,551 metres), and [[Mount Kelud]] (1,731 metres); The mountains are located in most Kediri, Blitar, Malang, Pasuruan, Mojokerto and Jombang. The group has the peak of Mount Bromo Tengger (2,329 metres), and Mount Semeru (3,676 metres). [[Mount Semeru]], which is also called Mahameru is the highest mountain in the island of Java. In the easternmost part if the province, there are two groups of mountains: the Iyang mountains with the peak Mount Argopuro (3,088 metres), the Ijen mountains with the peak [[Mount Raung]] (3344 metres) In the south there is a series of hills, that of the south coast of Pacitan, Trenggalek, Tulungagung, Blitar, Malang. the Kapur Selatan mountains is a continuation of a series of the Sewu mountains in Yogyakarta.\n\n===Water===\n[[File:Frost at Ranu Pani on 4 August 2018 by Susanto Tan.jpg|left|thumb|[[Classifications of snow|Light snow]] and [[frost]] is common at East Java highlands over 1500 [[Metres above sea level|meters above sea level]] in middle of year during late night until morning.]]\nTwo of the most important rivers in East Java is the [[Brantas River]] (290&nbsp;kilometres), and the [[Solo River]] (548&nbsp;kilometers). Brantas River has headwaters on the slopes Mount Arjuno near Batu, and flows through most areas in East Java, like Malang, Blitar, Tulungagung, Kediri, Jombang and Mojokerto. In Mojokerto, Brantas River split into two: [[Kali Mas]], and Porong; both empties into the Madura Strait. Solo River has headwaters on the slopes of Mount Lawu which lies on the border of East Java and Central Java, and flows through a portion of the eastern part of Central Java and East Java, which eventually empties in Gresik. Brantas River and Bengawan Solo are managed by Perum Jasa Tirta I. On the slopes of Mount Lawu near the border with Central Java are Sarangan, a natural lake. The main dam in East Java, among others Ir. Sutami and Selorejo Dam, which is used for irrigation, fish farming and tourism.\n\n===Climate===\nEast Java has a [[Tropical monsoon climate|tropical monsoon]] and [[Tropical savanna climate|savanna]] climate at lower elevation and [[Oceanic climate#Subtropical highland variety (Cfb, Cwb)|subtropical at higher elevation]]. Compared with the western part of Java Island, East Java in general has less rainfall. Average rainfall is 1,900&nbsp;mm per year, with a rainy season during the 100 days. The average temperature ranges between 19-34&nbsp;\u00b0C. Temperatures in the lower mountain areas, and even in areas Ranu Pani (slopes of Mount Semeru), temperatures can reach minus 4&nbsp;\u00b0C, causing a frost and fall of light snow.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/id-id/travel/ideperjalanan/12-fakta-ranupani-desa-di-kaki-semeru-yang-suhu-udaranya-saat-ini-capai-minus-4-derajat-celcius/ar-BBL4Cmv|title=12 Fakta Ranupani, Desa di Kaki Semeru yang Suhu Udaranya Saat Ini Capai Minus 4 Derajat Celcius|website=www.msn.com|language=id-ID|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Surabaya]], elevation: {{convert|5|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}, extremes 1963\u20131980\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 31.8\n|Feb high C = 31.5\n|Mar high C = 31.6\n|Apr high C = 31.4\n|May high C = 31.6\n|Jun high C = 31.2\n|Jul high C = 31.3\n|Aug high C = 30.1\n|Sep high C = 32.7\n|Oct high C = 33.4\n|Nov high C = 33.1\n|Dec high C = 31.9\n|year high C = 31.8\n|Jan low C = 24.1\n|Feb low C = 24.2\n|Mar low C = 24.0\n|Apr low C = 24.8\n|May low C = 24.1\n|Jun low C = 23.5\n|Jul low C = 23.0\n|Aug low C = 22.5\n|Sep low C = 22.9\n|Oct low C = 23.7\n|Nov low C = 24.1\n|Dec low C = 23.8\n|year low C = 23.7\n|rain colour=green\n|Jan rain mm = 327\n|Feb rain mm = 275\n|Mar rain mm = 283\n|Apr rain mm = 181\n|May rain mm = 159\n|Jun rain mm = 101\n|Jul rain mm = 22\n|Aug rain mm = 15\n|Sep rain mm = 17\n|Oct rain mm = 47\n|Nov rain mm = 105\n|Dec rain mm = 219\n|Jan rain days = 17\n|Feb rain days = 18\n|Mar rain days = 19\n|Apr rain days = 15\n|May rain days = 13\n|Jun rain days = 11\n|Jul rain days = 7\n|Aug rain days = 3\n|Sep rain days = 4\n|Oct rain days = 5\n|Nov rain days = 12\n|Dec rain days = 23\n\n|date=December 2010|Jan mean C=26.8|Feb mean C=26.8|Mar mean C=27|Apr mean C=27.3|May mean C=27.3|Jun mean C=26.7|Jul mean C=26.2|Aug mean C=26.5|Sep mean C=27.2|Oct mean C=28.2|Nov mean C=28.3|Dec mean C=27.3|Apr record high C=33.3|Apr record low C=18.3|Aug record high C=34.4|Aug record low C=16.1|Dec record high C=35|Dec record low C=20|Feb record high C=34.4|Feb record low C=21.1|Jan record high C=33.3|Jan record low C=21.1|Jul record high C=33.9|Jul record low C=14.4|Jun record high C=33.9|Jun record low C=15.6|Mar record high C=33.9|Mar record low C=20.6|May record high C=33.9|May record low C=16.7|Nov record high C=35.6|Nov record low C=19.4|Oct record high C=35|Oct record low C=17.8|Sep record high C=33.9|Sep record low C=16.7|Apr humidity=67.23|Aug humidity=57.87|Dec humidity=63.03|Feb humidity=69.1|Jan humidity=66.61|Jul humidity=60.84|Jun humidity=60.27|Mar humidity=66.3|May humidity=64.87|Nov humidity=56.13|Oct humidity=56.06|Sep humidity=54.53\n\n|Jan sun = 217\n|Feb sun = 196\n|Mar sun = 217\n|Apr sun = 270\n|May sun = 279\n|Jun sun = 300\n|Jul sun = 341\n|Aug sun = 341\n|Sep sun = 330\n|Oct sun = 310\n|Nov sun = 270\n|Dec sun = 248\n|year sun =\n|Jand sun = 7.0\n|Febd sun = 7.0\n|Mard sun = 7.0\n|Aprd sun = 9.0\n|Mayd sun = 9.0\n|Jund sun = 10.0\n|Juld sun = 11.0\n|Augd sun = 11.0\n|Sepd sun = 11.0\n|Octd sun = 10.0\n|Novd sun = 9.0\n|Decd sun = 8.0\n|Jan percentsun = 58\n|Feb percentsun = 58\n|Mar percentsun = 58\n|Apr percentsun = 75\n|May percentsun = 75\n|Jun percentsun = 83\n|Jul percentsun = 92\n|Aug percentsun = 92\n|Sep percentsun = 92\n|Oct percentsun = 83\n|Nov percentsun = 75\n|Dec percentsun = 62\n\n|source 1 = World Meteorological Organization;<ref name=\"World Weather Information Service\">{{cite web|url=http://worldweather.wmo.int/043/c00648.htm|title=World Weather Information Service \u2013 Surabaya|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref> Climate-Data.org (daily mean);<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.climate-data.org/asia/indonesia/east-java/surabaya-977158/|title=Surabaya climate: Average Temperature, weather by month, Surabaya weather averages -

[[West Java]]. Akin to [[Central Java]], the region's birth rates are not necessarily any lower than the rest of Java, however due to net population outflows, especially in times of calamity, not limited to volcanic eruptions or droughts, the region has varying rates of population growth that are generally lower than national average. Ethnic [[Javanese people|Javanese]] dominate the Java mainland as well as the total population of the province overall, while ethnic [[Madurese people|Madurese]] inhabit Madura and the Kangean and Masalembu archipelagos, though centuries of migrations have led the Java mainland to have a larger proportion of Madurese people than Madura itself. Minorities include distinct Javanese ethnicities such as the [[Tenggerese people|Tengger]] people in Bromo, the [[Saminism Movement|Samin]] and the [[Osing people|Osing]] people in [[Banyuwangi]]. East Java also hosts a significant population of foreign ethnic groups, such as [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]], Indians, and Arabs.\n\n=== Languages ===\nBesides the formal language, [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], East Java people use [[Javanese language|Javanese]] as daily language. Javanese as spoken in the western part of East Java (''Kulonan'') is a similar dialect to the one spoken in [[Central Java]], with its hierarchy of high, medium, and low registers. In the eastern part, such as Surabaya, Malang, and others, a more egalitarian version of Javanese is spoken, with less regard of hierarchy and a richer vocabulary for vulgarity. The dialect is notable for its roughness compared to other dialects spoken elsewhere in Java (especially the Mataram dialect spoken around [[Surakarta]] and [[Yogyakarta]], which is renowned for its smoothness) and contributes to the stereotype among Javanese people of East Javanese being \"blunt\" and \"loud\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hipwee.com/hiburan/serba-serbi-kehidupan-yang-dialami-oleh-arek-arek-jowo-timur/|title=Serba-Serbi Kehidupan yang Cuma Dialami Oleh Arek-Arek Jowo Timur|last=Karina|first=Ernia|date=2015-09-17|work=Hipwee|access-date=2018-09-26|language=id-ID}}</ref> Variants of Javanese are also used by Osing and Tengger minorities, the former utilizing a [[Balinese language|Balinese]]-influenced Javanese by virtue of its closeness with Bali island, and the latter speaking an archaic form of the language that retains many features now lost in other more-innovative Javanese dialects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?menu=004&LangID=213|title=Profile of|last=Project|first=UCLA Language Materials|date=1600-12-31|language=English|access-date=2018-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230065855/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?menu=004&LangID=213|archive-date=2010-12-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{bar box|title=Religion in East Java (2010 census)<ref name=\"BPS\u0320Religion\u03202010\">{{cite web| title = Population by Region and Religion in Indonesia | work = [[Badan Pusat Statistik|BPS]] | year = 2010 | url = http://sp2010.bps.go.id/index.php/site/tabel?tid=321&wid=0}}</ref>|titlebar=|left1=religion|right1=percent|float=right|bars={{bar percent|[[Islam]]|Green|96.36}}\n\n{{bar percent|Christianity|Blue|2.32}}\n\n{{bar percent|other, not stated or not asked|grey|0.84}}\n\n{{bar percent|Hinduism|orange|0.30}}\n\n{{bar percent|Buddhism|yellow|0.16}}\n\n{{bar percent|Confucianism|magenta|0.02}}}}Other than Javanese, minority language includes [[Madurese language|Madurese]], spoken by around 4 million ethnic Madurese people inhabiting Madura and the Kangean and Masalembu Islands.

Most of the people in East Java adheres to [[Islam]], forming around 96% of the total population. Other religions are also worshipped, such as [[Christianity]], which are mostly worshipped by [[Chinese Indonesians]] and immigrants from Eastern Indonesia and [[North Sumatra]], and also [[Hinduism]] which are mostly worshipped by the [[Tenggerese people]] in the [[Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park]] and the [[Balinese people]] inhabiting the easternmost part of the province bordering Bali. The [[Indonesian language]] is the official language of the province as well as the whole nation, but [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Madurese language|Madurese]] are the most frequently used language. Indonesian is only used for inter-ethnic communication and official purposes.\n\nEast Java is one of the provinces in Indonesia that offers different types of tourist attractions. This area offers a variety of natural attractions ranging from mountains, beaches, caves, to waterfalls. In general, almost every regencies or city in East Java has its own unique tourist destinations, such as the [[Ijen]] volcano in [[Banyuwangi Regency|Banyuwangi]], [[Baluran National Park]] in [[Situbondo Regency|Situbondo]], [[Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park]], etc.\n\n== History ==\n=== Prehistory ===\nEast Java has been inhabited by humans since prehistoric times.

They tell of many political and cultural events in the Kingdom of Dinoyo. The name of [[Malang]] is thought to come from the name of a sacred building called Malangkuseswara. This name is contained in at least one inscription, namely, the [[Mantyasih]] inscription written in 907 CE.\n\nIn 1222, [[Ken Arok]] founded the [[Singhasari|Kingdom of Singhasari]], which he ruled until 1292. Before coming to power, Ken Arok seized power in Tumapel (Kediri) from Tungul Ametung. Ken Arok dynasty's descendants became kings of Singhasari and [[Majapahit]] from the 13th until the 15th century.\n\nIn 1227, [[Anusapati]] killed Ken Arok, and later became king of Singasari. Anusapati's power only lasted 20 years, before he was killed by Tohjaya. Three years later, Tohjaya was killed in the uprising led by Jaya Wisnuwardhana, son of Anusapati. In 1268, Wisnuwardhana died, and he was succeeded by Kertanegara (1268-1292). In 1292 Kertanegara was defeated by a rebel named Jayakatwang, ending the power of Kertanegara power and the history of Singhasari.\n\nIn 1293, [[Kublai Khan]], founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]], sent a large invasion fleet to Java with 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers, beginning the [[Mongol invasion of Java]].<ref>{{citation|last=Weatherford|first=Jack|title=Genghis khan and the making of the modern world|page=239|year=2004|location=New York|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-609-80964-4}}</ref> This was a [[punitive expedition]] against King [[Kertanegara]] of [[Singhasari]], who had refused to pay tribute to the Yuan and maimed one of its ministers. However, it ended with failure for the [[Mongols]].\n\nIn 1294, the Kingdom of Majapahit was founded. Its founder was Raden Wijaya. Majapahit reached its peak during the reign of [[Hayam Wuruk]]. He was accompanied by the mahapatih [[Gajah Mada]]. Together they managed to unite the vast territory under the name Dwipantara. Majaphit later developed to become one of the strongest empire in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn 1357, the Bubat event occurred, the war between the King of Sunda and the Majapahit Patih Gajah Mada. This event stems from the desire to take the king Hayam Wuruk Sundanese princess named Dyah Pitaloka as queen. However, because of a misunderstanding about the procedure of marriage, the plan led to a battle in Bubat. Majapahit troops, under the command of Gajah Mada defeated Pajajaran. In 1389, Hayam Wuruk died, and was succeeded by Wikramawardhana. This resulted in the beginning of the decline of the Majapahit Empire. As the Majapahit Empire went into decline in the late 1300s, Islam moved to fill the vacuum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/East-Java|title=East Java {{!}} province, Indonesia|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-03-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Islamic era ===\n{{Main|Spread of Islam in Indonesia}}\n[[File:Ampel Mosque in 2008.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ampel Mosque]] in [[Surabaya]] is the [[List of the oldest mosques|oldest surviving mosque]] in [[Java]], and second oldest in [[Indonesia]].

However, according to some experts, it is estimated that Islam entered Java around the 11th century with evidence of the tomb of Fatimah Binti Maimun in the village of Leran in [[Gresik Regency]] which dates from 475 AH (1085 AD). The tomb also shows that in the 11th century the North coast of Java had begun to be frequented by [[Arabs|Arab]] traders from the Middle East.

The emergence of the Islamic kingdom on Java is also inseparable from the role of Walisongo. At first the spread of Islam was very rapid and was accepted by ordinary people, until finally the da'wah entered and was carried out by the rulers of this island.\n\n=== European colonization ===\nThe relationship between the Javanese and European colonial powers began in 1522, with the signing of a treaty between the [[Sunda Kingdom]] and the [[Portuguese Empire]] in [[Malacca]]. After the failure of the treaty, the Portuguese presence was then limited to Malacca in the [[Malay Peninsula]] and the [[Maluku Islands]]. An expedition under the leadership of the Dutch exploler [[Cornelis de Houtman]] consisting of four ships in 1596 became the beginning Dutch presence in the island.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Globe Encompassed: The Age of European Discovery, 1500-1700|author=Ames, Glenn J.|year=2008|page=99}}</ref> At the end of the 18th century, the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] had succeeded in expanding their influence on the Islamic sultanates in the interior of the island of Java.\n\nAt the onset of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the British conquered Java in 1811.

In Blitar, an uprising by [[Pembela Tanah Air|PETA]] (Defenders of the Homeland) led by Supriyadi, Moeradi, Halir Mangkudijoyo, and Soemarto occurred in early 1945, but it was crushed by the Japanese.\n\nTwo weeks after the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclamation of independence]], Surabaya established its own government in the shape of a resident, R. Sudirman. The formation of government in Surabaya caused disputes between the republican forces and Japanese troops, resulting in various skirmishes across the city. This was because when the Japanese surrendered, they were obliged to remain in power until the allied forces arrived. The arrival of Allied forces in Surabaya created tensions with the newly established government of Indonesia, reaching  peak on 10 November 1945 where a major [[Battle of Surabaya|battle]] between the Surabayan residents led by [[Sutomo]] and Allied forces.\n\nThe battle forced the governor, Suryo, on the advice of People's Security Army (TKR), to move the seat of the government to the Mojokerto area. A week later, the government retreated again to a more secure location in Kediri. However, security situation Kediri worsen until finally, in February 1947, the East Java provincial government fled to Malang. While the administration was based in Malang, Gobvernor Suryo was replaced by R.P. Suroso, who was in turn replaced again by Dr. Moerdjani. On 21 July 1947, although still bound by the [[Linggadjati Agreement]] and a ceasefire agreement in effect since 14 October 1946, the Dutch commenced a military action, [[Operation Product]], which led to deteriorating security conditions in Malang. The East Java provincial government finally moved again to Blitar.\n\nThis military action ended after the [[Renville Agreement]]. However, this agreement had negative consequences for East Java, namely, a reduction in the territory controlled by the East Java provincial government. The Netherlands then turned the areas under its control into new states, such as the [[State of Madura]] and the State of East Java. Amid the difficulties faced by the government of Indonesia, a left-wing opposition group, ''Front Demokrasi Rakyat'' (FDR, People's Democratic Front) launched rebellion in Madiun on 18 September 1948, which is known as the [[Madiun Affair]]. However, eventually this revolt was defeated by the [[Indonesian Army]]. On 19 December 1948, the Dutch launched [[Operation Kraai]]. Blitar, which  the seat of the East Java provincial government was attacked by the Dutch. Governor Dr. Moerdjani and his staff were forced to flee and joined the guerrillas on the slopes of Mount Willis. Operation Kraai ended after the [[Roem\u2013van Roijen Agreement]] on 7 May 1949.\n\nFollowing the [[Dutch\u2013Indonesian Round Table Conference]], at which the Netherlands agreed to transfer sovereignty to the [[United States of Indonesia]], the Dutch withdrew its troops from East Java. East Java changed its status from a province into a [[State of East Java|state]]. However, on 25 February 1950, this was dissolved and became part of the territory of the [[Republic of Indonesia (1949\u201350)|Republic of Indonesia]]. The [[State of Madura]] also decided to join Indonesia.\n\n=== Contemporary era ===\nAlong with rapid growth of urbanization in East Java, the governments could not satisfy the population's needs for affordable housing, which led to the building of [[shanty towns]] along the rivers and rail tracks. Today, the shanty towns still exist; although some have been transformed into \u201cbetter\u201d housing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://republika.co.id/berita/nasional/daerah/17/02/10/ol4fs9284-kota-malang-masih-hadapi-permukiman-kumuh|title=Kota Malang Masih Hadapi Permukiman Kumuh|date=2017-02-10|website=Republika Online|language=id|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316175230/https://republika.co.id/berita/nasional/daerah/17/02/10/ol4fs9284-kota-malang-masih-hadapi-permukiman-kumuh|archive-date=2018-03-16|url-status=|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>\n\nEast Java has twice hosted the [[National Sports Week (Indonesia)|National Sports Week]] (PON), namely PON VII in 1969, and PON XV in 2000, and became the overall champion of PON in 2000, and 2008.

[[Madura]] is the largest island in East Java, separated from the mainland Java by the [[Strait of Madura]]. [[Bawean Island]] is located about 150&nbsp;km north of Java. In the east of Madura there are a cluster of islands, the easternmost is [[Kangean Island]] and the northernmost is Masalembu Islands. In the southern part there are two small islands namely Nusa Barong and Sempu Island.\n\n===Geology===\nIn physiographic of geology, East Java Province can be grouped into three zones: the southern zone (plato), the middle zone (volcanic), and the northern zone (folds). Lowlands and highlands in the middle (of Ngawi, Blitar, Malang, to Bondowoso) has a fairly fertile soil. In the northern part ( Bojonegoro, Tuban, Gresik, to Madura Island) lies the Kapur Utara mountains and the Kendeng mountains which are relatively barren.\nIn the middle of the province stretch  mountain ranges and volcanoes: On the border with Central Java is [[Mount Lawu]] (3,265 metres). Southeast from Madiun is [[Mount Wilis]] (2,169 metres), and Mount Liman (2,563 metres).

Brantas River has headwaters on the slopes Mount Arjuno near Batu, and flows through most areas in East Java, like Malang, Blitar, Tulungagung, Kediri, Jombang and Mojokerto. In Mojokerto, Brantas River split into two: [[Kali Mas]], and Porong; both empties into the Madura Strait. Solo River has headwaters on the slopes of Mount Lawu which lies on the border of East Java and Central Java, and flows through a portion of the eastern part of Central Java and East Java, which eventually empties in Gresik. Brantas River and Bengawan Solo are managed by Perum Jasa Tirta I. On the slopes of Mount Lawu near the border with Central Java are Sarangan, a natural lake. The main dam in East Java, among others Ir. Sutami and Selorejo Dam, which is used for irrigation, fish farming and tourism.\n\n===Climate===\nEast Java has a [[Tropical monsoon climate|tropical monsoon]] and [[Tropical savanna climate|savanna]] climate at lower elevation and [[Oceanic climate#Subtropical highland variety (Cfb, Cwb)|subtropical at higher elevation]]. Compared with the western part of Java Island, East Java in general has less rainfall. Average rainfall is 1,900&nbsp;mm per year, with a rainy season during the 100 days. The average temperature ranges between 19-34&nbsp;\u00b0C. Temperatures in the lower mountain areas, and even in areas Ranu Pani (slopes of Mount Semeru), temperatures can reach minus 4&nbsp;\u00b0C, causing a frost and fall of light snow.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/id-id/travel/ideperjalanan/12-fakta-ranupani-desa-di-kaki-semeru-yang-suhu-udaranya-saat-ini-capai-minus-4-derajat-celcius/ar-BBL4Cmv|title=12 Fakta Ranupani, Desa di Kaki Semeru yang Suhu Udaranya Saat Ini Capai Minus 4 Derajat Celcius|website=www.msn.com|language=id-ID|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Surabaya]], elevation: {{convert|5|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}, extremes 1963\u20131980\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 31.8\n|Feb high C = 31.5\n|Mar high C = 31.6\n|Apr high C = 31.4\n|May high C = 31.6\n|Jun high C = 31.2\n|Jul high C = 31.3\n|Aug high C = 30.1\n|Sep high C = 32.7\n|Oct high C = 33.4\n|Nov high C = 33.1\n|Dec high C = 31.9\n|year high C = 31.8\n|Jan low C = 24.1\n|Feb low C = 24.2\n|Mar low C = 24.0\n|Apr low C = 24.8\n|May low C = 24.1\n|Jun low C = 23.5\n|Jul low C = 23.0\n|Aug low C = 22.5\n|Sep low C = 22.9\n|Oct low C = 23.7\n|Nov low C = 24.1\n|Dec low C = 23.8\n|year low C = 23.7\n|rain colour=green\n|Jan rain mm = 327\n|Feb rain mm = 275\n|Mar rain mm = 283\n|Apr rain mm = 181\n|May rain mm = 159\n|Jun rain mm = 101\n|Jul rain mm = 22\n|Aug rain mm = 15\n|Sep rain mm = 17\n|Oct rain mm = 47\n|Nov rain mm = 105\n|Dec rain mm = 219\n|Jan rain days = 17\n|Feb rain days = 18\n|Mar rain days = 19\n|Apr rain days = 15\n|May rain days = 13\n|Jun rain days = 11\n|Jul rain days = 7\n|Aug rain days = 3\n|Sep rain days = 4\n|Oct rain days = 5\n|Nov rain days = 12\n|Dec rain days = 23\n\n|date=December 2010|Jan mean C=26.8|Feb mean C=26.8|Mar mean C=27|Apr mean C=27.3|May mean C=27.3|Jun mean C=26.7|Jul mean C=26.2|Aug mean C=26.5|Sep mean C=27.2|Oct mean C=28.2|Nov mean C=28.3|Dec mean C=27.3|Apr record high C=33.3|Apr record low C=18.3|Aug record high C=34.4|Aug record low C=16.1|Dec record high C=35|Dec record low C=20|Feb record high C=34.4|Feb record low C=21.1|Jan record high C=33.3|Jan record low C=21.1|Jul record high C=33.9|Jul record low C=14.4|Jun record high C=33.9|Jun record low C=15.6|Mar record high C=33.9|Mar record low C=20.6|May record high C=33.9|May record low C=16.7|Nov record high C=35.6|Nov record low C=19.4|Oct record high C=35|Oct record low C=17.8|Sep record high C=33.9|Sep record low C=16.7|Apr humidity=67.23|Aug humidity=57.87|Dec humidity=63.03|Feb humidity=69.1|Jan humidity=66.61|Jul humidity=60.84|Jun humidity=60.27|Mar humidity=66.3|May humidity=64.87|Nov humidity=56.13|Oct humidity=56.06|Sep humidity=54.53\n\n|Jan sun = 217\n|Feb sun = 196\n|Mar sun = 217\n|Apr sun = 270\n|May sun = 279\n|Jun sun = 300\n|Jul sun = 341\n|Aug sun = 341\n|Sep sun = 330\n|Oct sun = 310\n|Nov sun = 270\n|Dec sun = 248\n|year sun =\n|Jand sun = 7.0\n|Febd sun = 7.0\n|Mard sun = 7.0\n|Aprd sun = 9.0\n|Mayd sun = 9.0\n|Jund sun = 10.0\n|Juld sun = 11.0\n|Augd sun = 11.0\n|Sepd sun = 11.0\n|Octd sun = 10.0\n|Novd sun = 9.0\n|Decd sun = 8.0\n|Jan percentsun = 58\n|Feb percentsun = 58\n|Mar percentsun = 58\n|Apr percentsun = 75\n|May percentsun = 75\n|Jun percentsun = 83\n|Jul percentsun = 92\n|Aug percentsun = 92\n|Sep percentsun = 92\n|Oct percentsun = 83\n|Nov percentsun = 75\n|Dec percentsun = 62\n\n|source 1 = World Meteorological Organization;<ref name=\"World Weather Information Service\">{{cite web|url=http://worldweather.wmo.int/043/c00648.htm|title=World Weather Information Service \u2013 Surabaya|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref> Climate-Data.org (daily mean);<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.climate-data.org/asia/indonesia/east-java/surabaya-977158/|title=Surabaya climate: Average Temperature, weather by month, Surabaya weather averages -

2018|last=|first=|website=|publisher=Badan Pusat Statistik|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}</ref>}}According to the 2000 [[census]], East Java had 34,765,993 people, which increased to 37,476,757 people at the 2010 Census,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160307211745/http://www.jawapos.com/halaman/index.php?act=detail&nid=151080]</ref> making it the second most populous Indonesian province after [[West Java]]. Akin to [[Central Java]], the region's birth rates are not necessarily any lower than the rest of Java, however due to net population outflows, especially in times of calamity, not limited to volcanic eruptions or droughts, the region has varying rates of population growth that are generally lower than national average. Ethnic [[Javanese people|Javanese]] dominate the Java mainland as well as the total population of the province overall, while ethnic [[Madurese people|Madurese]] inhabit Madura and the Kangean and Masalembu archipelagos, though centuries of migrations have led the Java mainland to have a larger proportion of Madurese people than Madura itself. Minorities include distinct Javanese ethnicities such as the [[Tenggerese people|Tengger]] people in Bromo, the [[Saminism Movement|Samin]] and the [[Osing people|Osing]] people in [[Banyuwangi]]. East Java also hosts a significant population of foreign ethnic groups, such as [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]], Indians, and Arabs.\n\n=== Languages ===\nBesides the formal language, [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], East Java people use [[Javanese language|Javanese]] as daily language. Javanese as spoken in the western part of East Java (''Kulonan'') is a similar dialect to the one spoken in [[Central Java]], with its hierarchy of high, medium, and low registers. In the eastern part, such as Surabaya, Malang, and others, a more egalitarian version of Javanese is spoken, with less regard of hierarchy and a richer vocabulary for vulgarity. The dialect is notable for its roughness compared to other dialects spoken elsewhere in Java (especially the Mataram dialect spoken around [[Surakarta]] and [[Yogyakarta]], which is renowned for its smoothness) and contributes to the stereotype among Javanese people of East Javanese being \"blunt\" and \"loud\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hipwee.com/hiburan/serba-serbi-kehidupan-yang-dialami-oleh-arek-arek-jowo-timur/|title=Serba-Serbi Kehidupan yang Cuma Dialami Oleh Arek-Arek Jowo Timur|last=Karina|first=Ernia|date=2015-09-17|work=Hipwee|access-date=2018-09-26|language=id-ID}}</ref> Variants of Javanese are also used by Osing and Tengger minorities, the former utilizing a [[Balinese language|Balinese]]-influenced Javanese by virtue of its closeness with Bali island, and the latter speaking an archaic form of the language that retains many features now lost in other more-innovative Javanese dialects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?menu=004&LangID=213|title=Profile of|last=Project|first=UCLA Language Materials|date=1600-12-31|language=English|access-date=2018-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230065855/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?menu=004&LangID=213|archive-date=2010-12-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{bar box|title=Religion in East Java (2010 census)<ref name=\"BPS\u0320Religion\u03202010\">{{cite web| title = Population by Region and Religion in Indonesia | work = [[Badan Pusat Statistik|BPS]] | year = 2010 | url = http://sp2010.bps.go.id/index.php/site/tabel?tid=321&wid=0}}</ref>|titlebar=|left1=religion|right1=percent|float=right|bars={{bar percent|[[Islam]]|Green|96.36}}\n\n{{bar percent|Christianity|Blue|2.32}}\n\n{{bar percent|other, not stated or not asked|grey|0.84}}\n\n{{bar percent|Hinduism|orange|0.30}}\n\n{{bar percent|Buddhism|yellow|0.16}}\n\n{{bar percent|Confucianism|magenta|0.02}}}}Other than Javanese, minority language includes [[Madurese language|Madurese]], spoken by around 4 million ethnic Madurese people inhabiting Madura and the Kangean and Masalembu Islands.
