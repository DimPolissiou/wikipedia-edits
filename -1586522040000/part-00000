When a party bearing the burden of proof meets their burden, the burden of proof switches to the other side. Burdens may be of different kinds for each party, in different phases of litigation. The [[Prima facie|burden of production]] is a minimal burden to produce at least enough evidence for the [[trier of fact]] to ''consider'' a disputed claim.<ref name=CL>''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law & Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], Guyora Binder, {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]</ref>{{rp|16\u201317}} After litigants have met the burden of production and their claim is being considered by a trier of fact, they have the burden of persuasion, that enough evidence has been presented to persuade the trier of fact that their side is correct. There are different ''standards'' of persuasiveness ranging from a [[preponderance of the evidence]], where there is just enough evidence to tip the balance, to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, as in United States criminal courts.<ref name=\"CL\"/>{{rp|17}}\n\nThe burden of proof is usually on the person who brings a claim in a dispute. It is often associated with the Latin [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] ''semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit'', a translation of which in this context is: \"the necessity of proof always lies with the person who lays charges.\"<ref>Transnational principle of law: [http://www.trans-lex.org/966000 Trans-Lex.org]</ref>\n\nThe party that does not carry the burden of proof carries the benefit of assumption of being correct, they are presumed to be correct, until the burden shifts after presentation of evidence by the party bringing the action. An example is in an American [[criminal case]], where there is a [[presumption of innocence]] by the [[defendant]]. Fulfilling the burden of proof effectively captures the benefit of assumption, passing the burden of proof off to another party.\n\n===In statistics===\n{{main|Null hypothesis}}\nIn [[inferential statistics]], the null hypothesis is a general statement or default position that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena, or no association among groups.<ref>{{cite book | last = Everitt | first = Brian | title = The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 0521593468 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/cambridgediction00ever_0 }}</ref> Rejecting or disproving the null [[hypothesis]]\u2014and thus concluding that there are grounds for believing that there ''is'' a relationship between two phenomena (e.g. that a potential treatment has a measurable effect)\u2014is a central task in the modern practice of science; the field of statistics gives precise criteria for rejecting a null hypothesis{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}.\n\nThe null hypothesis is generally assumed to be true until evidence indicates otherwise.  In statistics, it is often denoted '''''H''<sub>0</sub>''' (read \u201cH-nought\u201d, \"H-null\", \"H-oh\", or \"H-zero\").\n\nThe concept of a null hypothesis is used differently in two approaches to statistical inference. In the significance testing approach of [[Ronald Fisher]], a null hypothesis is rejected if the observed data are [[Statistical significance|significantly]] unlikely to have occurred if the null hypothesis were true. In this case the null hypothesis is rejected and an [[alternative hypothesis]] is accepted in its place. If the data are consistent with the null hypothesis, then the null hypothesis is not rejected. In neither case is the null hypothesis or its alternative proven; the null hypothesis is tested with data and a decision is made based on how likely or unlikely the data are. This is analogous to the legal principle of [[presumption of innocence]], in which a suspect or defendant is assumed to be innocent (null is not rejected) until proven guilty (null is rejected) beyond a reasonable doubt (to a statistically significant degree).\n\nIn the [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis testing]] approach of [[Jerzy Neyman]] and [[Egon Pearson]], a null hypothesis is contrasted with an alternative hypothesis and the two hypotheses are distinguished on the basis of data, with certain error rates.\n\nProponents of each approach criticize the other approach. Nowadays, though, a hybrid approach is widely practiced and presented in textbooks. The hybrid is in turn criticized as incorrect and incoherent\u2014for details, see [[Statistical hypothesis testing]].\n\nStatistical inference can be done without a null hypothesis, by specifying a [[statistical model]] corresponding to each candidate hypothesis and using [[model selection]] techniques to choose the most appropriate model.<ref>{{Citation |last=Burnham |first=K.

When a party bearing the burden of proof meets their burden, the burden of proof switches to the other side. Burdens may be of different kinds for each party, in different phases of litigation. The [[Prima facie|burden of production]] is a minimal burden to produce at least enough evidence for the [[trier of fact]] to ''consider'' a disputed claim.<ref name=CL>''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law & Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], Guyora Binder, {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]</ref>{{rp|16\u201317}} After litigants have met the burden of production and their claim is being considered by a trier of fact, they have the burden of persuasion, that enough evidence has been presented to persuade the trier of fact that their side is correct. There are different ''standards'' of persuasiveness ranging from a [[preponderance of the evidence]], where there is just enough evidence to tip the balance, to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, as in United States criminal courts.<ref name=\"CL\"/>{{rp|17}}\n\nThe burden of proof is usually on the person who brings a claim in a dispute. It is often associated with the Latin [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] ''semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit'', a translation of which in this context is: \"the necessity of proof always lies with the person who lays charges.\"<ref>Transnational principle of law: [http://www.trans-lex.org/966000 Trans-Lex.org]</ref>\n\nThe party that does not carry the burden of proof carries the benefit of assumption of being correct, they are presumed to be correct, until the burden shifts after presentation of evidence by the party bringing the action. An example is in an American [[criminal case]], where there is a [[presumption of innocence]] by the [[defendant]]. Fulfilling the burden of proof effectively captures the benefit of assumption, passing the burden of proof off to another party.\n\n===In statistics===\n{{main|Null hypothesis}}\nIn [[inferential statistics]], the null hypothesis is a general statement or default position that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena, or no association among groups.<ref>{{cite book | last = Everitt | first = Brian | title = The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 0521593468 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/cambridgediction00ever_0 }}</ref> Rejecting or disproving the null [[hypothesis]]\u2014and thus concluding that there are grounds for believing that there ''is'' a relationship between two phenomena (e.g. that a potential treatment has a measurable effect)\u2014is a central task in the modern practice of science; the field of statistics gives precise criteria for rejecting a null hypothesis{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}.\n\nThe null hypothesis is generally assumed to be true until evidence indicates otherwise.  In statistics, it is often denoted '''''H''<sub>0</sub>''' (read \u201cH-nought\u201d, \"H-null\", \"H-oh\", or \"H-zero\").\n\nThe concept of a null hypothesis is used differently in two approaches to statistical inference. In the significance testing approach of [[Ronald Fisher]], a null hypothesis is rejected if the observed data are [[Statistical significance|significantly]] unlikely to have occurred if the null hypothesis were true. In this case the null hypothesis is rejected and an [[alternative hypothesis]] is accepted in its place. If the data are consistent with the null hypothesis, then the null hypothesis is not rejected. In neither case is the null hypothesis or its alternative proven; the null hypothesis is tested with data and a decision is made based on how likely or unlikely the data are. This is analogous to the legal principle of [[presumption of innocence]], in which a suspect or defendant is assumed to be innocent (null is not rejected) until proven guilty (null is rejected) beyond a reasonable doubt (to a statistically significant degree).\n\nIn the [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis testing]] approach of [[Jerzy Neyman]] and [[Egon Pearson]], a null hypothesis is contrasted with an alternative hypothesis and the two hypotheses are distinguished on the basis of data, with certain error rates.\n\nProponents of each approach criticize the other approach. Nowadays, though, a hybrid approach is widely practiced and presented in textbooks. The hybrid is in turn criticized as incorrect and incoherent\u2014for details, see [[Statistical hypothesis testing]].\n\nStatistical inference can be done without a null hypothesis, by specifying a [[statistical model]] corresponding to each candidate hypothesis and using [[model selection]] techniques to choose the most appropriate model.<ref>{{Citation |last=Burnham |first=K.

office in the [[history of France]]. As First Secretary of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], he was the first [[Left-wing politics|left-wing politician]] to assume the presidency under the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]].\n\nReflecting family influences, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand started political life on the Catholic nationalist right. He served under the [[Vichy Regime]] during its earlier years. Subsequently he joined the [[French Resistance|Resistance]], moved to the left, and held ministerial office several times under the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand opposed [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]]'s establishment of the Fifth Republic. Although at times a politically isolated figure, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand outmanoeuvered rivals to become the left's standard bearer at every presidential election from 1965\u201388; with the exception of 1969. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was elected President at the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]]. He was [[1988 French presidential election|re-elected in 1988]] and remained in office until 1995.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand invited the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] into his first government, which was a controversial decision at the time. In the event, the Communists were boxed in as junior partners and, rather than taking advantage, saw their support erode. They left the cabinet in 1984. Early in his first term, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand followed a radical left-wing economic agenda, including nationalisation of key firms, but after two years, with the economy in crisis, he reversed course. He pushed a socially liberal agenda with reforms such as the abolition of the [[death penalty]], the 39-hour work week, and the end of a government monopoly in radio and television broadcasting. His foreign and defense policies built on those of his Gaullist predecessors. His partnership with [[German Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]] advanced European integration via the [[Maastricht Treaty]], but he reluctantly accepted [[German reunification]]. During his time in office, he was a strong promoter of culture and implemented a range of costly \"[[Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|Grands Projets]]\". He is the only French President to ever have named a female Prime Minister, [[\u00c9dith Cresson]], in 1991. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was twice forced by the loss of a parliamentary majority into \"[[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation governments]]\" with conservative cabinets led, respectively, by [[Jacques Chirac]] (1986\u20131988), and [[\u00c9douard Balladur]] (1993\u20131995). Less than eight months after leaving office, Mitterrand died from the [[prostate cancer]] he had successfully concealed for most of his presidency.\n\nBeyond making the French left electable, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand presided over the rise of the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] to dominance of the left, and the decline of the once-mighty [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] (as a share of the popular vote in the first presidential round, the Communists shrank from a peak of 21.27% in 1969 to 8.66% in 1995, at the end of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's second term).\n\n==Family==\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was born in [[Jarnac]], [[Charente]], and [[baptism|baptized]] '''Fran\u00e7ois Maurice Adrien Marie Mitterrand''', the son of Joseph Mitterrand and Yvonne Lorrain. His family was devoutly Catholic<ref>Tiersky, Ronald. ''Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand: A Very French President''. 2003, Rowman and Littlefield. pp. 38\u201342.</ref> and conservative. His father worked as an engineer for the [[Chemin de Fer de Paris \u00e0 Orl\u00e9ans|Compagnie Paris Orl\u00e9ans]] railway. He had three brothers, Robert, Jacques, and Philippe, and four sisters, Antoinette, Marie-Jos\u00e8phe, Colette, and Genevi\u00e8ve.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's wife, [[Danielle Mitterrand]] (''n\u00e9e'' Gouze, 1924\u20132011), came from a socialist background and worked for various left-wing causes. They married on 24 October 1944 and had three sons: Pascal (10 June \u2013 17 September 1945), [[Jean-Christophe Mitterrand|Jean-Christophe]], born in 1946, and Gilbert, born on 4 February 1949.

Arriving in Paris in autumn 1934, he then went to the [[\u00c9cole Libre des Sciences Politiques]] until 1937, where he obtained his diploma in July of that year. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand took membership for about a year in the ''Volontaires nationaux'' (National Volunteers), an organisation related to [[Fran\u00e7ois de la Rocque]]'s far-right league, the ''[[Croix de Feu]]''; the league had just participated in the [[6 February 1934 riots]] which led to the fall of the second ''[[Cartel des Gauches]]'' (Left-Wing Coalition).<ref name=\"P\u00e9an\">[[Pierre P\u00e9an]], ''Une jeunesse fran\u00e7aise'' (biography on Mitterrand), p.23\u201335</ref>\n\nContrary to some reports, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand never became a formal member of the ''[[Parti Social Fran\u00e7ais]]'' (PSF) which was the successor to the Croix de Feu and may be considered the first French right-wing mass party.<ref name=\"P\u00e9an\" /> However, he did write news articles in the ''[[L'Echo de Paris]]'' newspaper, which was close to the PSF. He participated in the demonstrations against the \"''[[m\u00e9t\u00e8que]] invasion''\" in February 1935 and then in those against law teacher [[Gaston J\u00e8ze]], who had been nominated as juridical counsellor of [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Negus]], in January 1936.\n\nWhen Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's involvement in these conservative nationalist movements was revealed in the 1990s, he attributed his actions to the milieu of his youth. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand furthermore had some personal and family relations with members of the [[La Cagoule|Cagoule]], a far-right terrorist group in the 1930s.<ref>[[Henry Rousso]], ''Le Syndrome de Vichy'', p.365</ref>\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand then served his [[Conscription in France|conscription]] from 1937 to 1939 in the 23rd r\u00e9giment d'infanterie coloniale.

He became engaged to Marie-Louise Terrasse (future actress and television presenter [[Catherine Langeais]]) in May 1940, when she was 16, but she broke it off in January 1942.

In his memoirs, he says that he had started this organisation while he was still officially working for the Vichy Regime.

When de Gaulle entered Paris following the [[Liberation of Paris|Liberation]], he was introduced to various men who were to be part of the provisional government. Among them was Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, when they came face to face, de Gaulle is said to have muttered: \"You again!\" He dismissed Fran\u00e7ois Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 2 weeks later.\n\nIn October 1944 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and [[Jacques Foccart]] developed a plan to liberate the POW and concentration camps. This was called operation ''Vicarage''. On the orders of de Gaulle, in April 1945 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand accompanied General Lewis as the French representative at the liberation of the camps at [[Kaufering concentration camp|Kaufering]] and [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]. By chance Mitterrand discovered his friend and member of his network, [[Robert Antelme]], suffering from [[typhus]].

At the [[June 1946 French legislative election|June 1946 legislative election]], he led the list of the [[Rally of the Republican Lefts]] (''Rassemblement des gauches r\u00e9publicaines'', RGR) in the Western suburb of Paris, but he was not elected. The RGR was an electoral entity composed of the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]], the centrist [[Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance]] (''Union d\u00e9mocratique et socialiste de la R\u00e9sistance'', UDSR) and several conservative groupings. It opposed the policy of the \"[[Three-parties]] alliance\" (Communists, Socialists and Christian Democrats).\n\nIn the [[November 1946 French legislative election|November 1946 legislative election]], he succeeded in winning a seat as deputy from the [[Ni\u00e8vre]] ''d\u00e9partement''. To be elected, he had to win a seat at the expense of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF). As leader of the RGR list, he led a very [[anti-communist]] campaign. He became a member of the UDSR party. In January 1947, he joined the cabinet as War Veterans Minister. He held various offices in the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] as a Deputy and as a Minister (holding eleven different portfolios in total), including as a [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of [[Ch\u00e2teau-Chinon (Ville)|Ch\u00e2teau-Chinon]] from 1959 to 1981.\n\nIn May 1948 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand participated in the [[Congress of The Hague]], together with [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Harold Macmillan]], [[Paul-Henri Spaak]], [[Albert Copp\u00e9]] and [[Altiero Spinelli]]. It originated the European Movement.\n\nAs Overseas Minister (1950\u20131951), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand opposed the colonial lobby to propose a reform program. He connected with the left when he resigned from the cabinet after the arrest of [[Morocco]]'s sultan (1953). As leader of the progressive wing of the UDSR, he took the head of the party in 1953, replacing the conservative [[Ren\u00e9 Pleven]].\n\nIn June 1953 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand attended the coronation of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Seated next to the elderly [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]], he reported having spent much of the ceremony being psychoanalyzed by her.\n\n===Senior minister during the Algerian War: 1954\u201358===\n\nAs [[List of Interior Ministers of France|Interior Minister]] in [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France]]'s cabinet (1954\u20131955), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had to direct the response to the [[Algerian War of Independence]]. He claimed: \"[[French Algeria|Algeria is France]].\" He was suspected of being the [[informant|informer]] of the Communist Party in the cabinet. This rumour was spread by the former Paris police prefect, who had been dismissed by him. The suspicions were dismissed by subsequent investigations.\n\nThe UDSR joined the [[Republican Front (France)|Republican Front]], a centre-left coalition, which won the [[1956 French legislative election|1956 legislative election]]. As [[List of Justice Ministers of France|Justice Minister]] (1956\u20131957), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand allowed the expansion of martial law in the Algerian conflict. Unlike other ministers (including Mend\u00e8s-France), who criticised the repressive policy in Algeria, he remained in [[Guy Mollet]]'s cabinet until its end.

This defeated coalition of the \"No\" was composed of the PCF and some left-wing republican politicians (such as Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand).\n\nThis attitude may have been a factor in Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's losing his seat in the [[1958 French legislative election|1958 elections]], beginning a long \"crossing of the desert\" (this term is usually applied to de Gaulle's decline in influence for a similar period). Indeed, in the second round of the legislative election, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was supported by the Communists but the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) refused to withdraw its candidate. This division caused the election of the [[Gaullist Party|Gaullist]] candidate. One year later, he was [[1959 French Senate election|elected]] to represent [[Ni\u00e8vre]] in the [[French Senate|Senate]], where he was part of the [[Democratic Left (France)|Group of the Democratic Left]]. At the same time, he was not admitted to the ranks of the [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (''Parti socialiste unifi\u00e9'', PSU) which was created by Mend\u00e8s-France, former internal opponents of Mollet and reform-minded former members of the Communist Party. The PSU leaders justified their decision by referring to his non-resignation from Mollet's cabinet and by his past in Vichy.\n\n[[File:Portret van Francois Mitterrand, Bestanddeelnr 910-7485.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand on 16 October 1959]]\nAlso in that same year, on the Avenue de l'Observatoire in Paris, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand claimed to have escaped an assassin's bullet by diving behind a hedge, in what became known as the ''Observatory Affair''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D9173BF93BA15755C0A961948260 | work=The New York Times | title=The Mitterrand Mystery | first1=Robert O. | last1=Paxton | date=28 June 1987 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}{{sic}}</ref> The incident brought him a great deal of publicity, initially boosting his political ambitions. Some of his critics claimed, however, that he had staged the incident himself, resulting in a backlash against Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. He later said he had earlier been warned by right-wing deputy [[Robert Pesquet]] that he was the target of an ''[[Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise]]'' death squad and accused Prime Minister [[Michel Debr\u00e9]] of being its instigator. Before his death, Pesquet claimed that Fran\u00e7ois Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had set up a fake attempt on his life. Prosecution was initiated against Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand but was later dropped. Nonetheless, the Observatory Affair cast a lasting shadow over Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's reputation. Years later in 1965, when Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand emerged as the challenger to de Gaulle in the second round of the presidential elections, de Gaulle was urged by an aide to use the Observatory Affair to discredit his opponent. \"No, and don't insist\" was the General's response, \"It would be wrong to demean the office of the Presidency, since one day he [Mitterrand] may have the job.\"<ref>Tiersky, Ronald.

(1965) - 53Fi3417.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in [[Toulouse]] on 17 December 1965 during the [[1965 French presidential election|1965 presidential election]] campaign]]\n\nIn the [[1962 French legislative election|1962 election]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand regained his seat in the National Assembly with the support of the PCF and the SFIO. Practicing left unity in Ni\u00e8vre, he advocated the rallying of left-wing forces at the national level, including the PCF, in order to challenge Gaullist domination. Two years later, he became the president (chairman) of the General Council of Ni\u00e8vre. While the opposition to De Gaulle organized in clubs, he founded his own group, the [[Convention of Republican Institutions]] (''Convention des institutions r\u00e9publicaines'', CIR). He reinforced his position as a left-wing opponent to [[Charles de Gaulle]] in publishing ''Le Coup d'\u00c9tat permanent'' (The permanent coup, 1964), which criticized de Gaulle's personal power, the weaknesses of Parliament and of the government, the President's exclusive control of foreign affairs, and defence, etc.\n\nIn 1965, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was the first left-wing politician who saw the [[1965 French presidential election|presidential election]] by universal suffrage as a way to defeat the opposition leadership. Not a member of any specific political party, his candidacy for presidency was accepted by all left-wing parties (the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO), [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]] (PR) and [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU)). He ended the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' of the PCF which the party had been subject to since 1947. For the SFIO leader [[Guy Mollet]], Mitterrand's candidacy prevented [[Gaston Defferre]], his rival in the SFIO, from running for the presidency. Furthermore, Fran\u00e7ois Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was a lone figure, so he did not appear as a danger to the left-wing parties' staff members.\n\nDe Gaulle was expected to win in the first round, but Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 31.7% of the vote, denying De Gaulle a first-round victory. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was supported in the second round by the left and other anti-Gaullists:  centrist [[Jean Monnet]], moderate conservative [[Paul Reynaud]] and [[Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour]], an extreme right-winger and the lawyer who had defended [[Raoul Salan]], one of the four generals who had organized the 1961 [[Algiers putsch]] during the [[Algerian War]].\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 44.8% of votes in the second round and de Gaulle, with the majority, was thus elected for another term, but this defeat was regarded as honourable, for no one was really expected to defeat de Gaulle. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand took the lead of a centre-left alliance: the [[Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la gauche d\u00e9mocrate et socialiste'', FGDS). It was composed of the SFIO, the Radicals and several left-wing republican clubs (such the CIR of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand).\n\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 1968.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand on 29 May 1968]]\nIn the [[1967 French legislative election|legislative election of March 1967]], the system where all candidates who failed to pass a 10% threshold in the first round were eliminated from the second round favoured the pro-Gaullist majority, which faced a split opposition (PCF, FGDS and centrists of [[Jacques Duhamel]]). Nevertheless, the parties of the left managed to gain 63 seats more than previously for a total of 194. The Communists remained the largest left-wing group with 22.5% of votes. The governing coalition won with its majority reduced by only one seat (247 seats out of 487).\n\nIn Paris, the Left (FGDS, PSU, PCF) managed to win more votes in the first round than the two governing parties (46% against 42.6%) while the [[Democratic Centre (France)|Democratic Centre]] of Duhamel got 7% of votes. But with 38% of votes, de Gaulle's [[Union des D\u00e9mocrates pour la R\u00e9publique|Union for the Fifth Republic]] remained the leading French party.<ref>[[Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9mond]], ''Notre si\u00e8cle'', 1988, Fayard, p.664 ff.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]] governmental crisis, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand held a press conference to announce his candidacy if a new presidential election was held. But after the Gaullist demonstration on the [[Champs-Elys\u00e9es]], de Gaulle dissolved the Assembly and called for a legislative election instead. In [[1968 French legislative election|this election]], the right wing won its largest majority since the ''[[National Bloc (France)|Bloc National]]'' [[1919 French legislative election|in 1919]].\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was accused of being responsible for this huge legislative defeat and the FGDS split. In 1969, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand could not run for the Presidency: [[Guy Mollet]] refused to give him the support of the SFIO. The left wing was eliminated in the first round, with the Socialist candidate Gaston Defferre winning a humiliating 5.1 percent of the total vote. [[Georges Pompidou]] faced the centrist [[Alain Poher]] in the [[1969 French presidential election|second round]].\n\n===Socialist Party leader: 1971\u201381===\nAfter the FGDS's implosion, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand turned to the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] (''Parti socialiste'' or PS). In June 1971, at the time of the [[Epinay Congress]], the CIR joined the PS, which had succeeded the SFIO in 1969. The executive of the PS was then dominated by [[Guy Mollet]]'s supporters. They proposed an \"ideological dialogue\" with the Communists. For Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, an electoral alliance with the Communists was necessary to rise to power. With this in mind, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand obtained the support of all the internal opponents to Mollet's faction and was elected as the first secretary of the PS. At the 1971 congress, he declared: \"Whoever does not accept the break with the established order, with capitalist society, cannot be an adherent of the Socialist Party.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4t3wo_congres-d-epinay-1971-francois-mitt_news|title=Congr\u00e8s d'Epinay (1971)|last=|first=|date=2008-03-22|website=Dailymotion|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22|quote=Celui qui n\u2019accepte pas la rupture avec l\u2019ordre \u00e9tabli, avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 capitaliste, celui l\u00e0, il ne peut pas \u00eatre adh\u00e8rent du Parti Socialiste.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/francois-mitterrand-socialist-party-common-program-communist-pcf-1981-elections-austerity/|title=The Many Lives of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|last=Birch|first=Jonah|date=19 August 2015|website=[[Jacobin]]|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1972, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand signed the [[Programme commun|Common Programme of Government]] with the Communist [[Georges Marchais]] and the [[Left Radical Party|Left Radical]] [[Robert Fabre]]. With this programme, he led the [[1973 French legislative election|1973 legislative campaign]] of the \"Union of the Left\".\n\n[[File:Strasbourg-1979-05-06 (3758237073).jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in Strasbourg on 5 May 1979]]\nAt the [[1974 French presidential election|1974 presidential election]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 43.2% of the vote in the first round, as the common candidate of the left. He faced [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] in the second round. During the national TV debate, Giscard d'Estaing criticised him as being \"a man of the past\", due to his long political career. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was narrowly defeated by Giscard d'Estaing, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand receiving 49.19% and Giscard 50.81%.\n\nIn 1977, the Communist and Socialist parties failed to update the ''Common Programme'', then lost the [[1978 French legislative election|1978 legislative election]]. While the Socialists took the leading position on the left, by obtaining more votes than the Communists for the first time [[1936 French legislative election|since 1936]], the leadership of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was challenged by an internal opposition led by [[Michel Rocard]] who criticized the programme of the PS as being \"archaic\" and \"unrealistic\". The polls indicated Rocard was more popular than Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. Nevertheless, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand won the vote at the Party's [[Metz Congress]] (1979) and Rocard renounced his candidacy for the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]].\n\nFor his third candidacy for presidency, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was not supported by the PCF but only by the PS. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand projected a reassuring image with the slogan \"the quiet force\". He campaigned for \"another politics\", based on the Socialist programme ''[[110 Propositions for France]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miroirs.ironie.org/socialisme/www.psinfo.net/elections/president/1981/index.html |title=\u00c9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 1981 |publisher=Miroirs.ironie.org |date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> and denounced the performance of the incumbent president. Furthermore, he benefited from divisions in the right-wing majority. He obtained 25.85% of votes in the first round (against 15% for the PCF candidate [[Georges Marchais]]), then defeated President Giscard d'Estaing in the second round, with 51.76%. He became the first left-wing politician elected [[President of France]] by universal suffrage.\n\n==Presidency==\n\n===First term: 1981\u20131988===\n[[File:Ronald Reagan Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 1984.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand with U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]], 1984]]\nIn the [[1981 French presidential election|presidential election of 10 May 1981]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand became the first socialist President of the Fifth Republic, and his government became the first left-wing government in 23 years. He named [[Pierre Mauroy]] as Prime Minister and organised a new [[1981 French legislative election|legislative election]]. The Socialists obtained an absolute parliamentary majority, and four Communists joined the cabinet.\n\n====Economic policy====\nThe beginning of his first term was marked by a left-wing [[economic policy]] based on the [[110 Propositions for France]] and the 1972 Common Programme between the Socialist Party, the [[Communist Party (France)|Communist Party]] and the [[Left Radical Party]]. This included several nationalizations, a 10% increase in the ''[[salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance|SMIC]]'' (minimum wage), a 39-hour work week, 5 weeks holiday per year, the creation of the [[solidarity tax on wealth]], an increase in social benefits, and the extension of workers' rights to consultation and information about their employers (through the [[Jean Auroux|Auroux Act]]). The objective was to boost economic demand and thus economic activity ([[Keynesianism]]), but the stimulative fiscal policy implemented by the Mauroy government was in contradiction with the constrained [[monetary policy]] implemented by the [[Bank of France]].<ref>Reichart, Alexandre (2015). \"[http://www.jeeh.it/articolo?urn=urn:abi:abi:RIV.JOU:2015;1.11 French Monetary Policy (1981\u20131985), A Constrained Policy, between Volcker Shock, the EMS and Macroeconomic Imbalances]\".

Housing allocations for the low-paid were raised by 25% in 1981, and in the two years following May 1981 family allowances were increased by 44% for families with 3 children and by 81% for families with 2 children. In 1981, the purchasing power of social transfers went up by 4.5% and by 7.6% in 1982. In addition, the minimum wage (which affected 1.7&nbsp;million employees) was increased by 15% in real terms between May 1981 and December 1982.<ref>''Socialism, the State and Public Policy'' in France edited by Philip G. Cerny and Martin A. Schain</ref>\n\nMajor efforts were made to improve access to housing and health care, while the government also attempted to tackle working-class under-achievement in schools by reinforcing the comprehensive system, modernising the curriculum and reducing [[Streaming (education)|streaming]]. As a means of increasing political participation, the government increased the financial allowances of local politicians, who also became entitled to paid leave from their jobs to attend courses in public administration. Allowances for the handicapped were improved, while improvements were also made in the pay and conditions for those serving in the army. A decree of January 1982 provided for \"solidarity contracts\" whereby firms would be subsidised for introducing part-time work or early retirement if they also allowed the creation of new jobs, while a decree of March 1982 provided employees with the right to retire at the age of 60 on 50% of average earnings during their 10 best years of employment. In 1983, legislation was passed to encourage greater equality in the private sector. Firms now had to make an annual report on the training opportunities and employment conditions for women and present a statistical analysis of their position in the firm, whilst the works committee had to ensure that equality promoting measures are taken.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Mitterrand's France'' Edited by Sonia Mazey and Michael Newman</ref> In addition, a new benefit was introduced for unemployed workers who had exhausted their eligibility for unemployment insurance.<ref name=\"Vail2009\">{{cite book |title=Recasting Welfare Capitalism Economic Adjustment in Contemporary France and Germany |first=Mark I. |last=Vail |year=2009 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-59213-967-5}}</ref> In December 1982, a law was passed that restored to workers the right to elect administrators to social security funds, which had been eliminated by Charles De Gaulle in 1967.<ref>''Contemporary France: Politics and Society Since 1945'' by D.

Priority was given to the struggle against inflation in order to remain competitive in the [[European Monetary System]]. Although there were two periods of mild economic reflation (first from 1984 to 1986 and again from 1988 to 1990), monetary and fiscal restraint was the essential policy orientation of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's presidency from 1983 onwards.<ref name=\"Smith1998\">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=W.

The government agreed at the same time to improve the pension position of some public sector employees and to increase the real value of the minimum pension. In addition, later negotiations brought retirement at 60 years into the occupational schemes although the financial terms for doing so could only be agreed for a 7-year period. A comparison between 1981 and 1986 showed that the minimum state pension had increased by 64% for a couple and by 81% for one person. During that same period, family allowances had increased by 71% for three children and by 112% for two children. In addition, the single-parent allowance for mothers or fathers with one child had been increased by 103% and for two or more children by 52% for each child\n\nIn order to mark the importance of the problems of the elderly, the government appointed a Secretary of State (attached to the Ministry of Social Affairs and National Solidarity) to carry special responsibility for them, and in an effort to try to relate policy to the felt needs of the elderly, it set up a central advisory committee to examine social policy from their point of view and carry out special studies and enquiries. This body became especially concerned with monitoring the attempts at coordination and encouraging policies which were aimed at helping he elderly stay at home instead of entering residential care.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn the field of health care, some prescription charges were abolished, hospital administration was decentralised, workers\u2019 rights in the health service were reaffirmed, and equipment was provided for researchers.<ref>''The French Socialist Party: Resurgence and Victory'' by D. S. Bell and Byron Criddle</ref> From 1983 onwards, wage-earners who had contributed to a pension fund for 37.5 years became eligible to retire on a full pension. This right was extended to the self-employed in 1984 and to farmers in 1986. People who had retired at the age of 60 were, however, not initially eligible for reductions on public transport until they reached the age of 65. The qualifying age for these reductions was, however, reduced to 62 in 1985.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">France during the socialist years by Gino Raymond</ref> A number of illegal immigrants had their position regularized under the Socialists and the conditions pertaining to residence and work permits were eased. Educational programmes were implemented to help immigrant communities, while immigrants were allowed the right to free association. The Socialist government also opened up talks with the authorities in some of the main countries of origin, easing nationality rules in the public sector, associating representatives of migrant groups with public authority work, and established an Immigrants Council in 1984.\n\nAlthough the income limit for allowances varied according to the position of the child in the family and the number of dependent children, these ceilings were made more favourable in cases where both parents were working or where a single parent was in charge and were linked to changes in wage levels. Those taking parental leave to care for three or more children (provided that they fulfilled the rules for eligibility) also received certain benefits in kind, such as a non-taxable, non-means-tested benefit and priority on vocational training courses. A new boost was also given to research into family problems including an interest in the effects of changing family structures, of women\u2019s employment and the impact of local social policies on family life.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> In addition, while a law on equal opportunities in employment was passed in July 1983 which prohibited all forms of unequal treatment regardless of the circumstances, together with providing for positive action plans to be established in major companies.

He also dissolved the ''Cour de s\u00fbret\u00e9'', a special high court, and enacted a massive regularization of [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]]. Tighter regulations on the powers of police to stop, search and arrest were introduced, and the \"loi s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et libert\u00e9\" (a controversial public order act) was repealed.

By 1986, particular attention was being focused on assisting women in single-parent families to get back into employment, in recognition of the growing problems associated with extra-marital births and marital breakdown. Parental leave was extended to firms with 100 employees in 1981 (previously, parental leave provision had been made in 1977 for firms employing at least 200 employees) and subsequently to all employees in 1984. From 1984 onwards, married women were obliged to sign tax returns, men and women were provided with equal rights in managing their common property and that of their children, and in 1985 they became responsible for each other\u2019s debts.\n\nChildcare facilities were also expanded, with the number of places in cr\u00e8ches rising steadily between 1981 and 1986.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> In addition, the minimum wage was significantly increased. From 1981 to 1984, the ''[[salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance|SMIC]]'' rose by 125%, while prices went up by only 75% during that same period.<ref>''The Death of Politics: France under Mitterrand'' by John Laughland {{page needed|date=May 2017}}</ref> Various measures were also introduced to mitigate the effects of rising unemployment.

A significant investment was made in music education with the creation of 5 new music schools in the departements and the revamping of the Conservatoire National de la Musique at Lyon, while the range and capacity of performance facilities in Paris was considerably increased, with the Cite Musicale de la Villette and the Opera de la Bastille allowing for specialist performance in a way that was lacking in Paris previously, and a 2,000 seat concert hall called le Zenith, which was designed primarily for rock music concerts but adapted for all uses.\n\nThe Socialists continued the policies of their predecessors with the Grand Louvre project and the opening of the Picasso Museum at the Hotel Sale, while the museum budget was quadrupled and particular sums were set aside for the first time for large regional projects including the establishment of a number of new museums in the provinces such as the Ecomuseum at Chartres and the Museum of Prehistory at Carnac. A fonds regional des Acquisitions was established to assist provincial museums in the purchase of works of art, while the state actively continued an existing policy of encouraging bequests in lieu of death duties.\n\nLibraries and publishing benefited from new thinking and an injection of funds, while aid to authors and publishers was restructured and book prices were fixed once again, with the objective being to assist smaller publishing houses and specialist bookshops. The network of regional lending libraries was significantly reinforced, while financial assistance was provided for the export of French books. In addition, archaeology, ethnography and historical buildings and monuments all benefited from the general increase in resources.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n====Domestic difficulties====\nThe Left lost the 1983 municipal elections and the 1984 European Parliament election. At the same time, the [[Alain Savary|Savary Bill]], to limit the financing of private schools by local communities, caused a political crisis. It was abandoned and Mauroy resigned in July 1984. [[Laurent Fabius]] succeeded him, and the Communists left the cabinet.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand did not significantly deviate from his predecessors and he continued nuclear weapons testing in the South Pacific in spite of protests from various peace and environmentalist organizations. In 1985, French agents sank the [[Greenpeace]]-owned ex-[[Fishing trawler|trawler]] [[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|''Rainbow Warrior'']] while it was docked in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] which the group had used in demonstrations against nuclear tests, [[whaling]], and [[seal hunting]]. One Greenpeace member was killed, and when news broke of the event, a major scandal erupted that led to the resignation of Defense Minister [[Charles Hernu]]. France subsequently paid reparations of 1.8&nbsp;million USD to Greenpeace.\n\n====First Cohabitation====\nBefore the [[1986 French legislative election|1986 legislative campaign]], [[proportional representation]] was instituted in accordance with the 110 Propositions. It did not prevent, however, the victory of the [[Rally for the Republic]]/[[Union for French Democracy]] (RPR/UDF) coalition. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand thus named the RPR leader [[Jacques Chirac]] as Prime Minister. This period of government, with a President and a Prime Minister who came from two opposite coalitions, was the first time that such a combination had occurred under the Fifth Republic, and came to be known as \"[[Cohabitation (government)|Cohabitation]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FRsocialist.htm |title=Socialist Party |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date=1914-07-31 |accessdate=11 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303143326/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FRsocialist.htm |archivedate=3 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nChirac mostly handled domestic policy while Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand concentrated on his \"reserved domain\" of foreign affairs and defence. However, several conflicts erupted between the two. In one example, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand refused to sign executive decrees of liberalization, obliging Chirac to pass the measures through parliament instead. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand also reportedly gave covert support to some social movements, notably the student revolt against the university reform ([[Alain Devaquet|Devaquet Bill]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2007}} Benefiting from the difficulties of Chirac's cabinet, the President's popularity increased.\n\nWith the polls running in his favor, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand announced his candidacy in the [[1988 French presidential election|1988 presidential election]]. He proposed a moderate programme (promising \"neither nationalisations nor liberalisation\") and advocated a \"united France,\" and laid out his policy priorities in his \"Letter to the French People.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miroirs.ironie.org/socialisme/www.psinfo.net/elections/president/1988/index.html |title=\u00c9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 1988 |publisher=Miroirs.ironie.org |date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> He obtained 34% of the votes in the first round, then faced Chirac in the second, and was re-elected with 54% of the votes.

Rocard led the moderate wing of the PS and he was the most popular of the Socialist politicians. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand decided to organize a new [[1988 French legislative election|legislative election]]. The PS obtained a relative parliamentary majority. Four centre-right politicians joined the cabinet.\n\nThe second term was marked by the creation of the [[Revenu minimum d'insertion|Insertion Minimum Revenue]] (RMI), which ensured a minimum level of income to those deprived of any other form of income; the restoring of the solidarity tax on wealth, which had been abolished by Chirac's cabinet; the institution of the [[Generalized social tax]]; the extension of parental leave up to the child's third birthday;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> the reform of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]]; the 1990 [[Gayssot Act]] on [[hate speech]] and [[Holocaust denial]]; the Besson law of 1990;<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/gov/publicsectorinnovationande-government/2537279.pdf] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the Mermaz Law of 1989;,<ref name=\"justlanded\">{{cite web|url=http://www.justlanded.com/english/France/Articles/Property/Letting-in-France|title=France: Letting in France, Rules & Regulations, Various rules and regulations apply to the letting of|publisher=justlanded.com|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> the introduction of a private childcare allowance;<ref name=\"google7\">{{cite book|title=The Politics of Post-Industrial Welfare States: Adapting Post-War Social Policies to New Social Risks|author1=Armingeon, K.|author2=Bonoli, G.|date=2007|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-134-17910-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTi2SS8egosC|page=218|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> the Urban Orientation Law of 1991;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/247-FR_Housing.pdf |title=National Analytical Study on Housing|date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> the [[Pierre Arpaillange|Arpaillange Act]] on the financing of political parties; the reform of the [[penal code]]; the [[Matignon Agreements (1988)|Matignon Agreements]] concerning [[New Caledonia]]; the [[Loi Evin|Evin Act]] on smoking in public places; the extension of the age limit for family allowances to 18 years in 1990;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref name=\"securite-sociale\">{{cite web|url=http://www.securite-sociale.fr/L-allocation-de-rentree-scolaire-est-versee-sous-conditions-de-ressources-pour-chaque-enfant?id_mot=67|title=Le portail du service public de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale / L'allocation de rentr\u00e9e scolaire est&nbsp;(...)|publisher=securite-sociale.fr|accessdate=7 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501082739/http://www.securite-sociale.fr/L-allocation-de-rentree-scolaire-est-versee-sous-conditions-de-ressources-pour-chaque-enfant?id_mot=67|archive-date=1 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the 1989 Education Act which, amongst other measures, obliged local authorities to educate all children with disabilities.<ref name=\"google8\">{{cite book|title=Implementing Inclusive Education|author=Innovation, C.E.R.|date=1997|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|isbn=9789264155893|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7N3QP75Q9wC|page=24|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> Several large architectural works were pursued, in what would become known as the [[Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] with the building of the [[Louvre Pyramid]], the [[Channel Tunnel]], the [[Grande Arche]] at [[La D\u00e9fense]], the [[Bastille Opera]], the Finance Ministry in [[Bercy]], and the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France|National Library of France]]. On 16 February 1993, President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand inaugurated in [[Fr\u00e9jus]] a memorial to the [[Indochina War|wars in Indochina]].\n\nBut the second term was also marked by rivalries within the PS and the split of the ''Mitterrandist'' group (at the [[Rennes Congress]], where supporters of [[Laurent Fabius]] and [[Lionel Jospin]] clashed bitterly for control of the party), the scandals about the financing of the party, the [[Infected blood scandal (France)|contaminated blood scandal]] which implicated Laurent Fabius and former ministers Georgina Dufoix and Emond Herv\u00e9, and the Elys\u00e9e wiretaps affairs.\n\n====Second Cohabitation====\nDisappointed with Rocard's apparent failure to enact the Socialists' programme, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand dismissed Michel Rocard in 1991 and appointed [[\u00c9dith Cresson]] to replace him. She was the first woman to become Prime Minister in France, but proved a costly mistake due to her tendency for making acerbic and racist public remarks. After the Socialists experienced heavy losses in the 1992 regional elections, Cresson resigned from office. Her successor [[Pierre B\u00e9r\u00e9govoy]] promised to fight unemployment and corruption but he could not prevent the catastrophic defeat of the left in the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 legislative election]]. The Socialist Party suffered a crushing defeat with the right-wing parties winning 485 seats to the left's 92. He killed himself on 1 May 1993.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand named the former RPR Finance Minister [[Edouard Balladur]] as Prime Minister. The second \"cohabitation\" was less contentious than the first, because the two men knew they were not rivals for the next presidential election. By this point, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was nearly 80 years old and suffering from cancer in addition to the shock of his friend [[Fran\u00e7ois de Grossouvre]]'s suicide. His second and last term ended after the [[1995 French presidential election|1995 presidential election]] in May 1995 with the election of [[Jacques Chirac]]. Socialist candidate [[Lionel Jospin]] lost the presidential election.\n\nOverall, as President, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand maintained the \"basic characteristic of a strong welfare base underpinned by a strong state.\" A United Nations Human Development report concluded that, from 1979 to 1989, France was the only country in the OECD (apart from Portugal) in which income inequalities did not get worse.<ref>''France since 1870: Culture, Politics, and Society'' by Charles Sowerine</ref> During his second term as president, however, the gap between rich and poor widened in France,<ref>''One Hundred Years of Socialism: The West European Left in the Twentieth Century'' by Donald Sassoon</ref> with both unemployment and poverty rising in the awake of the economic recession of 1991\u20131993.<ref>''The Mitterrand Years: Legacy and Evaluation'' edited by Mairi Maclean</ref> According to other studies, though, the percentage of the French population living in poverty (based on various criteria) fell between the mid-Eighties and the mid-Nineties.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bT-3laKFEUsC&pg=PA149&dq=poverty%20in%20france%201981-1995#v=onepage&q=poverty%20in%20france%201981-1995&f=false|title=Statistical Handbook on the Social Safety Net|first=Fernando Francisco|last=Padr\u00f3|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|via=Google Books|isbn=9781573565165}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cajWAgAAQBAJ|title=Innovations in Labour Market Policies The Australian Way: The Australian Way|last=OECD|date=17 July 2001|publisher=OECD Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9789264194502}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\n{{Main|Foreign policy of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand}}\n\n====East/West relations====\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand supported closer European collaboration and the preservation of France's special relationship with its former colonies, which he feared were falling under \"[[Anglosphere|Anglo-Saxon]] influence.\" His drive to preserve French power in Africa led to controversies concerning Paris' role during the [[Rwandan genocide]].<ref name=\"rwanda\">[http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2730430.ece Mitterrand's role revealed in Rwandan genocide warning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706182535/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2730430.ece |date=6 July 2008 }}, 3 July 2007.

Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand also sharply criticized the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet intervention]] in [[Afghanistan]] as well as the country's nuclear weapons buildup. When Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand visited the USSR in November 1988, the Soviet media claimed to be 'leaving aside the virtually wasted decade and the loss of the [[France-Russia relations|Soviet-French]] 'special relationship' of the Gaullist era'.\n\nNevertheless, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was worried by the rapidity of the [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern bloc's]] [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse]].

Seeing an \"East wind\" blowing in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, he stated that a \"Southern wind\" was also blowing in Africa, and that state leaders had to respond to the populations' wishes and aspirations by a \"democratic opening\", which included a [[representative democracy|representative system]], free elections, [[Multi-party system|multipartyism]], [[freedom of the press]], an independent judiciary, and abolition of censorship. Claiming that France was the country making the most important effort concerning development aid, he announced that the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] (LDCs) would henceforth receive only grants from France, as opposed to loans (in order to combat the massive increase of [[Third World debt]] during the 1980s). He likewise limited the [[interest rate]] to 5% on French loans to intermediate-income countries (that is, [[Ivory Coast]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], Cameroon and [[Gabon]]).\n\nHe also criticized interventionism in sovereign matters, which was according to him only another form of \"[[colonialism]]\". However, according to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, this did not imply lessened concern on the part of Paris for its [[French colonial empire|former colonies]]. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand thus continued with the African policy of de Gaulle inaugurated in 1960, which followed the relative failure of the 1958 creation of the [[French Community]]. All in all, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's La Baule speech, which marked a relative turning point in France's policy concerning its former colonies, has been compared with the 1956 ''loi-cadre [[Gaston Defferre|Defferre]]'' which was responding to [[anti-colonialist]] feelings.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061117230046/http://helios.univ-reims.fr/Labos/CERI/Mitterrand_et_la_democratie_en_Afrique.htm#UN%20DISCOURS%20DE%20CIRCONSTANCE Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand et la d\u00e9mocratie en Afrique, huit ans apr\u00e8s], by Albert Bourgi, {{ill|Centre de recherches internationales|fr}} (CERI) (mixed study unit with the [[CNRS]], dependent of the ''[[Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques]]'') {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nAfrican heads of state themselves reacted to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's speech at most with indifference.

The [[List of scientific priority disputes|controversy]] was eventually settled by an agreement (helped along by the mediation of Dr [[Jonas Salk]]) between President [[Ronald Reagan]] and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand which gave equal credit to both men and their teams.\n\n====Apology to the Huguenots====\nIn October 1985, to commemorate the tricentenary of the [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand gave a formal apology to the descendants of [[Huguenot]]s around the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://discours.vie-publique.fr/notices/857015500.html |title=Allocution de M.

Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's family then prosecuted Gubler and his publisher for violating [[Confidentiality#Medical confidentiality|medical confidentiality]].\n\n===P\u00e9tain===\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand came under fire in 1992 when it was revealed that he had arranged for the laying of a wreath of flowers on the grave of [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] each [[Armistice Day]] since 1987. P\u00e9tain had been the leader of French forces at the dramatic [[Battle of Verdun]] in World War I, for which he was revered by his contemporaries. Later, however, he became leader of [[Vichy France]] after the French [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|defeat by Germany]] (June 1940) in World War II, collaborating with [[Nazi Germany]] and putting [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] measures into place.\n\nThe placing of such a wreath was not without precedent. Presidents [[Charles de Gaulle]] and [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] had wreaths placed on P\u00e9tain's grave to commemorate the 50th and 60th anniversaries of the end of World War I. Similarly, President [[Georges Pompidou]] had a wreath placed in 1973 when P\u00e9tain's remains were returned to the [[Ile d'Yeu]] after being stolen. Nonetheless, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's regular annual tributes went beyond the marking by his predecessors of exceptional occasions, and offended sensibilities at a time when France was re-examining its role in [[the Holocaust]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n===Urba===\nThe Urba consultancy was established in 1971 by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] to advise Socialist-led [[Communes of France|communes]] on infrastructure projects and public works. The [[Urba affair]] became public in 1989 when two police officers investigating the [[Marseille]] regional office of Urba discovered detailed minutes of the organisation's contracts and division of proceeds between the party and elected officials. Although the minutes proved a direct link between Urba and graft activity, an edict from the office of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, himself listed as a recipient, prevented further investigation. The Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand election campaign of 1988 was directed by [[Henri Nallet]], who then became [[Minister of Justice (France)|Justice Minister]] and therefore in charge of the investigation at national level. In 1990 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand declared an amnesty for those under investigation, thus ending the affair. Socialist Party treasurer [[Henri Emmanuelli]] was tried in 1997 for corruption offences, for which he received a two-year suspended sentence.\n\n===Wiretaps===\nFrom 1982 to 1986, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand established an \"anti-terror cell\" installed as a service of the President of the Republic. This was an unusual set-up, since such law enforcement missions against terrorism are normally left to the [[French National Police|National Police]] and [[French Gendarmerie|''Gendarmerie'']], run under the cabinet and the Prime Minister, and under the supervision of the judiciary. The cell was largely staffed by members of these services, but it bypassed the normal line of command and safeguards. 3000 conversations concerning 150 people (7 for reasons judged to be contestable by the ensuing court process) were recorded between January 1983 and March 1986 by this anti terrorist cell at the Elys\u00e9e Palace. In one of its first actions, the cell was involved in the \"[[Irish of Vincennes]]\" affair, in which it appeared that members of the cell had planted weapons and explosives in the Vincennes apartment of three Irish nationals who were arrested on terrorism charges. Most markedly, it appears that the cell, under illegal [[presidential orders]], obtained [[wiretap]]s on journalists, politicians and other personalities who may have been an impediment for Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's personal life. The illegal wiretapping was revealed in 1993 by ''[[Lib\u00e9ration]]''; the case against members of the cell went to trial in November 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-387334,0.html |title=(Subscription) |work=Le Monde |location=France |accessdate=3 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324020235/http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-387334,0.html |archive-date=24 March 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netscape.qc.ca/article/?cat=Monde&article=M111351AU&ch=a|title=Le proc\u00e8s des \"\u00e9coutes de l'Elys\u00e9e\" doit commencer lundi \u00e0 Paris|last=Von Derschau|first=Verena|publisher=La Presse Canadienne|access-date=5 December 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928083952/http://www.netscape.qc.ca/article/?cat=Monde&article=M111351AU&ch=a#|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt took 20 years for the 'affaire' to come before the courts because the instructing judge [[Jean-Paul Vallat]] was at first thwarted by the 'affaire' being classed a defence secret, but in December 1999 la [[Commission consultative du secret de la d\u00e9fense nationale]] declassified part of the files concerned. The Judge finished his investigation in 2000, but it still took another four years before coming on 15 November 2004 before the 16th chamber of the ''[[Tribunal correctionnel (France)|Tribunal correctionnel]] de Paris''. 12 people were charged with  \"atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e\" (breach of privacy) and one with selling computer files. 7 were given suspended sentences and fines and 4 were found not guilty.\n\nThe affair finally ended before the ''Tribunal correctionnel de Paris'' with the court's judgement on 9 November 2005. 7 members of the President's anti-terrorist unit were condemned and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was designated as the \"inspirator and essentially the controller of the operation.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.fr/actualite/societe/0,3800002050,39369829,00.htm |title=La police fran\u00e7aise d\u00e9ploie ses grandes oreilles, 30 mai 2007 |publisher=News.fr |accessdate=3 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe court's judgement revealed that Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was motivated by keeping elements of his private life secret from the general public, such as the existence of his illegitimate daughter [[Mazarine Pingeot]] (which the writer [[Jean-Edern Hallier]], was threatening to reveal), his cancer which had been diagnosed in 1981, and the elements of his past in the Vichy R\u00e9gime which were not already public knowledge. The court judged that certain people were tapped for \"obscure\" reasons, such as [[Carole Bouquet]]'s companion, a lawyer with family in the Middle East, [[Edwy Plenel]], a journalist for ''le Monde'' who covered the ''Rainbow Warrior'' story and the Vincennes Three affair, and the lawyer Antoine Comte. The court declared \"Les faits avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 commis sur ordre soit du pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique, soit des ministres de la D\u00e9fense successifs qui ont mis \u00e0 la disposition de ([[Christian Prouteau]]) tous les moyens de l'\u00c9tat afin de les ex\u00e9cuter\" (translation: these actions were committed following orders from the French President or his various Defence Ministers who gave [[Christian Prouteau]] full access to the state machinery so he could execute the orders) The court stated that Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was the principal instigator of the wire taps (l'inspirateur et le d\u00e9cideur de l'essentiel) and that he had ordered some of the taps and turned a blind eye to others and that none of the 3000 wiretaps carried out by the cell were legally obtained.<ref>''Les oreilles du Pr\u00e9sident'' de [[Jean-Marie Pontaut]] et [[J\u00e9rome Dupuis]], [[Fayard]], 1996.

With French assistance, the Rwandan army grew from a force of 9,000 men in October 1990 to 28,000 in 1991. France also provided training staff, experts and massive quantities of weaponry and facilitated arms contracts with Egypt and South Africa. It also financed, armed and trained Habyrimana's Presidential Guard.

to 1995, the longest time in office in the [[history of France]]. As First Secretary of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], he was the first [[Left-wing politics|left-wing politician]] to assume the presidency under the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]].\n\nReflecting family influences, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand started political life on the Catholic nationalist right. He served under the [[Vichy Regime]] during its earlier years. Subsequently he joined the [[French Resistance|Resistance]], moved to the left, and held ministerial office several times under the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand opposed [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]]'s establishment of the Fifth Republic. Although at times a politically isolated figure, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand outmanoeuvered rivals to become the left's standard bearer at every presidential election from 1965\u201388; with the exception of 1969. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was elected President at the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]]. He was [[1988 French presidential election|re-elected in 1988]] and remained in office until 1995.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand invited the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] into his first government, which was a controversial decision at the time. In the event, the Communists were boxed in as junior partners and, rather than taking advantage, saw their support erode. They left the cabinet in 1984. Early in his first term, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand followed a radical left-wing economic agenda, including nationalisation of key firms, but after two years, with the economy in crisis, he reversed course. He pushed a socially liberal agenda with reforms such as the abolition of the [[death penalty]], the 39-hour work week, and the end of a government monopoly in radio and television broadcasting. His foreign and defense policies built on those of his Gaullist predecessors. His partnership with [[German Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]] advanced European integration via the [[Maastricht Treaty]], but he reluctantly accepted [[German reunification]]. During his time in office, he was a strong promoter of culture and implemented a range of costly \"[[Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|Grands Projets]]\". He is the only French President to ever have named a female Prime Minister, [[\u00c9dith Cresson]], in 1991. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was twice forced by the loss of a parliamentary majority into \"[[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation governments]]\" with conservative cabinets led, respectively, by [[Jacques Chirac]] (1986\u20131988), and [[\u00c9douard Balladur]] (1993\u20131995). Less than eight months after leaving office, Mitterrand died from the [[prostate cancer]] he had successfully concealed for most of his presidency.\n\nBeyond making the French left electable, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand presided over the rise of the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] to dominance of the left, and the decline of the once-mighty [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] (as a share of the popular vote in the first presidential round, the Communists shrank from a peak of 21.27% in 1969 to 8.66% in 1995, at the end of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's second term).\n\n==Family==\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was born in [[Jarnac]], [[Charente]], and [[baptism|baptized]] '''Fran\u00e7ois Maurice Adrien Marie Mitterrand''', the son of Joseph Mitterrand and Yvonne Lorrain. His family was devoutly Catholic<ref>Tiersky, Ronald. ''Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand: A Very French President''. 2003, Rowman and Littlefield. pp. 38\u201342.</ref> and conservative. His father worked as an engineer for the [[Chemin de Fer de Paris \u00e0 Orl\u00e9ans|Compagnie Paris Orl\u00e9ans]] railway.

They married on 24 October 1944 and had three sons: Pascal (10 June \u2013 17 September 1945), [[Jean-Christophe Mitterrand|Jean-Christophe]], born in 1946, and Gilbert, born on 4 February 1949.

Arriving in Paris in autumn 1934, he then went to the [[\u00c9cole Libre des Sciences Politiques]] until 1937, where he obtained his diploma in July of that year. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand took membership for about a year in the ''Volontaires nationaux'' (National Volunteers), an organisation related to [[Fran\u00e7ois de la Rocque]]'s far-right league, the ''[[Croix de Feu]]''; the league had just participated in the [[6 February 1934 riots]] which led to the fall of the second ''[[Cartel des Gauches]]'' (Left-Wing Coalition).<ref name=\"P\u00e9an\">[[Pierre P\u00e9an]], ''Une jeunesse fran\u00e7aise'' (biography on Mitterrand), p.23\u201335</ref>\n\nContrary to some reports, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand never became a formal member of the ''[[Parti Social Fran\u00e7ais]]'' (PSF) which was the successor to the Croix de Feu and may be considered the first French right-wing mass party.<ref name=\"P\u00e9an\" /> However, he did write news articles in the ''[[L'Echo de Paris]]'' newspaper, which was close to the PSF. He participated in the demonstrations against the \"''[[m\u00e9t\u00e8que]] invasion''\" in February 1935 and then in those against law teacher [[Gaston J\u00e8ze]], who had been nominated as juridical counsellor of [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Negus]], in January 1936.\n\nWhen Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's involvement in these conservative nationalist movements was revealed in the 1990s, he attributed his actions to the milieu of his youth.

He became engaged to Marie-Louise Terrasse (future actress and television presenter [[Catherine Langeais]]) in May 1940, when she was 16, but she broke it off in January 1942.

From 27 November 1943 Mitterrand worked for the [[Bureau central de renseignements et d'action]].<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais'', tome 1, p. 102</ref> In December 1943 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand ordered the execution of Henri Marlin (who was about to order attacks on the \"[[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]]\") by Jacques Paris and Jean Munier, who later hid out with Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's father.\n\nAfter a second visit to London in February 1944, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand took part in the liberation of Paris in August; he took over the headquarters of Commissariat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral aux prisonniers de guerre (general office for POW, the ministry he was working for), immediately he took up the vacant post of secretary general of POWs. When de Gaulle entered Paris following the [[Liberation of Paris|Liberation]], he was introduced to various men who were to be part of the provisional government. Among them was Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, when they came face to face, de Gaulle is said to have muttered: \"You again!\" He dismissed Fran\u00e7ois Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 2 weeks later.\n\nIn October 1944 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and [[Jacques Foccart]] developed a plan to liberate the POW and concentration camps. This was called operation ''Vicarage''. On the orders of de Gaulle, in April 1945 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand accompanied General Lewis as the French representative at the liberation of the camps at [[Kaufering concentration camp|Kaufering]] and [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]. By chance Mitterrand discovered his friend and member of his network, [[Robert Antelme]], suffering from [[typhus]]. Antelme was restricted to the camp to prevent the spread of disease, but Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand arranged for his \"escape\" and sent him back to France for treatment.<ref>Jean Lacouture, Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais, \u00e9d.

At the [[June 1946 French legislative election|June 1946 legislative election]], he led the list of the [[Rally of the Republican Lefts]] (''Rassemblement des gauches r\u00e9publicaines'', RGR) in the Western suburb of Paris, but he was not elected. The RGR was an electoral entity composed of the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]], the centrist [[Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance]] (''Union d\u00e9mocratique et socialiste de la R\u00e9sistance'', UDSR) and several conservative groupings. It opposed the policy of the \"[[Three-parties]] alliance\" (Communists, Socialists and Christian Democrats).\n\nIn the [[November 1946 French legislative election|November 1946 legislative election]], he succeeded in winning a seat as deputy from the [[Ni\u00e8vre]] ''d\u00e9partement''. To be elected, he had to win a seat at the expense of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF). As leader of the RGR list, he led a very [[anti-communist]] campaign. He became a member of the UDSR party. In January 1947, he joined the cabinet as War Veterans Minister. He held various offices in the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] as a Deputy and as a Minister (holding eleven different portfolios in total), including as a [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of [[Ch\u00e2teau-Chinon (Ville)|Ch\u00e2teau-Chinon]] from 1959 to 1981.\n\nIn May 1948 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand participated in the [[Congress of The Hague]], together with [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Harold Macmillan]], [[Paul-Henri Spaak]], [[Albert Copp\u00e9]] and [[Altiero Spinelli]]. It originated the European Movement.\n\nAs Overseas Minister (1950\u20131951), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand opposed the colonial lobby to propose a reform program. He connected with the left when he resigned from the cabinet after the arrest of [[Morocco]]'s sultan (1953). As leader of the progressive wing of the UDSR, he took the head of the party in 1953, replacing the conservative [[Ren\u00e9 Pleven]].\n\nIn June 1953 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand attended the coronation of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Seated next to the elderly [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]], he reported having spent much of the ceremony being psychoanalyzed by her.\n\n===Senior minister during the Algerian War: 1954\u201358===\n\nAs [[List of Interior Ministers of France|Interior Minister]] in [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France]]'s cabinet (1954\u20131955), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had to direct the response to the [[Algerian War of Independence]]. He claimed: \"[[French Algeria|Algeria is France]].\" He was suspected of being the [[informant|informer]] of the Communist Party in the cabinet. This rumour was spread by the former Paris police prefect, who had been dismissed by him. The suspicions were dismissed by subsequent investigations.\n\nThe UDSR joined the [[Republican Front (France)|Republican Front]], a centre-left coalition, which won the [[1956 French legislative election|1956 legislative election]]. As [[List of Justice Ministers of France|Justice Minister]] (1956\u20131957), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand allowed the expansion of martial law in the Algerian conflict. Unlike other ministers (including Mend\u00e8s-France), who criticised the repressive policy in Algeria, he remained in [[Guy Mollet]]'s cabinet until its end. As Minister of Justice, he had a role in 45 executions of the Algerian natives, recommending President [[Rene Coty]] to reject clemency in 80% of the cases, an action he later came to regret.<ref name=\"lepoint\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/politique/les-guillotines-de-mitterrand-31-08-2001-56908_20.php|title=Les guillotin\u00e9s de Mitterrand \u2013 Le Point|publisher=lepoint.fr|accessdate=7 December 2014|date=2001-08-31}}</ref> Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's role in confirming the death sentences of FLN rebels convicted by French courts of terrorism and later in abolishing the death penalty in 1981 led the British writer Anthony Daniels (writing under his pseudonym of [[Theodore Dalrymple]]) to accuse Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand of being an unprincipled opportunist, a cynical politician who proudly confirmed death sentences of FLN terrorists in the 1950s when it was popular and who only came to champion abolishing the death penalty when was popular with the French people.<ref>{{cite magazine\n  | last =  Dalrmymple\n  | first = Theodore\n  | title= The Battle of Algiers\n  | magazine = The New English Review\n  | date=March 2015| url = http://www.newenglishreview.org/Theodore_Dalrymple/A_Battle_of_Algiers/\n  | accessdate = 2016-10-25}}</ref>\n\nAs Minister of Justice he was an official representative of France during the wedding of [[Rainier III]], [[Prince of Monaco]], and actress [[Grace Kelly]].

He justified his opposition by the circumstances of de Gaulle's comeback: the [[May 1958 crisis|13 May 1958 quasi-putsch]] and military pressure. In September 1958, determinedly opposed to Charles de Gaulle, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand made an appeal to vote \"no\" in the [[1958 French constitutional referendum|referendum over the Constitution]], which was nevertheless adopted on 4 October 1958. This defeated coalition of the \"No\" was composed of the PCF and some left-wing republican politicians (such as Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand).\n\nThis attitude may have been a factor in Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's losing his seat in the [[1958 French legislative election|1958 elections]], beginning a long \"crossing of the desert\" (this term is usually applied to de Gaulle's decline in influence for a similar period). Indeed, in the second round of the legislative election, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was supported by the Communists but the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) refused to withdraw its candidate. This division caused the election of the [[Gaullist Party|Gaullist]] candidate. One year later, he was [[1959 French Senate election|elected]] to represent [[Ni\u00e8vre]] in the [[French Senate|Senate]], where he was part of the [[Democratic Left (France)|Group of the Democratic Left]]. At the same time, he was not admitted to the ranks of the [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (''Parti socialiste unifi\u00e9'', PSU) which was created by Mend\u00e8s-France, former internal opponents of Mollet and reform-minded former members of the Communist Party. The PSU leaders justified their decision by referring to his non-resignation from Mollet's cabinet and by his past in Vichy.\n\n[[File:Portret van Francois Mitterrand, Bestanddeelnr 910-7485.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand on 16 October 1959]]\nAlso in that same year, on the Avenue de l'Observatoire in Paris, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand claimed to have escaped an assassin's bullet by diving behind a hedge, in what became known as the ''Observatory Affair''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D9173BF93BA15755C0A961948260 | work=The New York Times | title=The Mitterrand Mystery | first1=Robert O. | last1=Paxton | date=28 June 1987 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}{{sic}}</ref> The incident brought him a great deal of publicity, initially boosting his political ambitions. Some of his critics claimed, however, that he had staged the incident himself, resulting in a backlash against Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. He later said he had earlier been warned by right-wing deputy [[Robert Pesquet]] that he was the target of an ''[[Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise]]'' death squad and accused Prime Minister [[Michel Debr\u00e9]] of being its instigator. Before his death, Pesquet claimed that Fran\u00e7ois Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had set up a fake attempt on his life. Prosecution was initiated against Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand but was later dropped. Nonetheless, the Observatory Affair cast a lasting shadow over Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's reputation. Years later in 1965, when Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand emerged as the challenger to de Gaulle in the second round of the presidential elections, de Gaulle was urged by an aide to use the Observatory Affair to discredit his opponent. \"No, and don't insist\" was the General's response, \"It would be wrong to demean the office of the Presidency, since one day he [Mitterrand] may have the job.\"<ref>Tiersky, Ronald.

F; Mitterrand cloture sa campagne \u00e0 Toulouse. (1965) - 53Fi3417.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in [[Toulouse]] on 17 December 1965 during the [[1965 French presidential election|1965 presidential election]] campaign]]\n\nIn the [[1962 French legislative election|1962 election]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand regained his seat in the National Assembly with the support of the PCF and the SFIO. Practicing left unity in Ni\u00e8vre, he advocated the rallying of left-wing forces at the national level, including the PCF, in order to challenge Gaullist domination. Two years later, he became the president (chairman) of the General Council of Ni\u00e8vre. While the opposition to De Gaulle organized in clubs, he founded his own group, the [[Convention of Republican Institutions]] (''Convention des institutions r\u00e9publicaines'', CIR). He reinforced his position as a left-wing opponent to [[Charles de Gaulle]] in publishing ''Le Coup d'\u00c9tat permanent'' (The permanent coup, 1964), which criticized de Gaulle's personal power, the weaknesses of Parliament and of the government, the President's exclusive control of foreign affairs, and defence, etc.\n\nIn 1965, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was the first left-wing politician who saw the [[1965 French presidential election|presidential election]] by universal suffrage as a way to defeat the opposition leadership. Not a member of any specific political party, his candidacy for presidency was accepted by all left-wing parties (the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO), [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]] (PR) and [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU)). He ended the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' of the PCF which the party had been subject to since 1947. For the SFIO leader [[Guy Mollet]], Mitterrand's candidacy prevented [[Gaston Defferre]], his rival in the SFIO, from running for the presidency. Furthermore, Fran\u00e7ois Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was a lone figure, so he did not appear as a danger to the left-wing parties' staff members.\n\nDe Gaulle was expected to win in the first round, but Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 31.7% of the vote, denying De Gaulle a first-round victory. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was supported in the second round by the left and other anti-Gaullists:  centrist [[Jean Monnet]], moderate conservative [[Paul Reynaud]] and [[Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour]], an extreme right-winger and the lawyer who had defended [[Raoul Salan]], one of the four generals who had organized the 1961 [[Algiers putsch]] during the [[Algerian War]].\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 44.8% of votes in the second round and de Gaulle, with the majority, was thus elected for another term, but this defeat was regarded as honourable, for no one was really expected to defeat de Gaulle. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand took the lead of a centre-left alliance: the [[Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la gauche d\u00e9mocrate et socialiste'', FGDS). It was composed of the SFIO, the Radicals and several left-wing republican clubs (such the CIR of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand).\n\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 1968.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand on 29 May 1968]]\nIn the [[1967 French legislative election|legislative election of March 1967]], the system where all candidates who failed to pass a 10% threshold in the first round were eliminated from the second round favoured the pro-Gaullist majority, which faced a split opposition (PCF, FGDS and centrists of [[Jacques Duhamel]]). Nevertheless, the parties of the left managed to gain 63 seats more than previously for a total of 194. The Communists remained the largest left-wing group with 22.5% of votes. The governing coalition won with its majority reduced by only one seat (247 seats out of 487).\n\nIn Paris, the Left (FGDS, PSU, PCF) managed to win more votes in the first round than the two governing parties (46% against 42.6%) while the [[Democratic Centre (France)|Democratic Centre]] of Duhamel got 7% of votes. But with 38% of votes, de Gaulle's [[Union des D\u00e9mocrates pour la R\u00e9publique|Union for the Fifth Republic]] remained the leading French party.<ref>[[Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9mond]], ''Notre si\u00e8cle'', 1988, Fayard, p.664 ff.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]] governmental crisis, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand held a press conference to announce his candidacy if a new presidential election was held. But after the Gaullist demonstration on the [[Champs-Elys\u00e9es]], de Gaulle dissolved the Assembly and called for a legislative election instead. In [[1968 French legislative election|this election]], the right wing won its largest majority since the ''[[National Bloc (France)|Bloc National]]'' [[1919 French legislative election|in 1919]].\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was accused of being responsible for this huge legislative defeat and the FGDS split. In 1969, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand could not run for the Presidency: [[Guy Mollet]] refused to give him the support of the SFIO. The left wing was eliminated in the first round, with the Socialist candidate Gaston Defferre winning a humiliating 5.1 percent of the total vote. [[Georges Pompidou]] faced the centrist [[Alain Poher]] in the [[1969 French presidential election|second round]].\n\n===Socialist Party leader: 1971\u201381===\nAfter the FGDS's implosion, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand turned to the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] (''Parti socialiste'' or PS). In June 1971, at the time of the [[Epinay Congress]], the CIR joined the PS, which had succeeded the SFIO in 1969. The executive of the PS was then dominated by [[Guy Mollet]]'s supporters. They proposed an \"ideological dialogue\" with the Communists. For Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, an electoral alliance with the Communists was necessary to rise to power. With this in mind, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand obtained the support of all the internal opponents to Mollet's faction and was elected as the first secretary of the PS. At the 1971 congress, he declared: \"Whoever does not accept the break with the established order, with capitalist society, cannot be an adherent of the Socialist Party.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4t3wo_congres-d-epinay-1971-francois-mitt_news|title=Congr\u00e8s d'Epinay (1971)|last=|first=|date=2008-03-22|website=Dailymotion|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22|quote=Celui qui n\u2019accepte pas la rupture avec l\u2019ordre \u00e9tabli, avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 capitaliste, celui l\u00e0, il ne peut pas \u00eatre adh\u00e8rent du Parti Socialiste.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/francois-mitterrand-socialist-party-common-program-communist-pcf-1981-elections-austerity/|title=The Many Lives of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|last=Birch|first=Jonah|date=19 August 2015|website=[[Jacobin]]|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1972, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand signed the [[Programme commun|Common Programme of Government]] with the Communist [[Georges Marchais]] and the [[Left Radical Party|Left Radical]] [[Robert Fabre]]. With this programme, he led the [[1973 French legislative election|1973 legislative campaign]] of the \"Union of the Left\".\n\n[[File:Strasbourg-1979-05-06 (3758237073).jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in Strasbourg on 5 May 1979]]\nAt the [[1974 French presidential election|1974 presidential election]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 43.2% of the vote in the first round, as the common candidate of the left. He faced [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] in the second round. During the national TV debate, Giscard d'Estaing criticised him as being \"a man of the past\", due to his long political career. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was narrowly defeated by Giscard d'Estaing, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand receiving 49.19% and Giscard 50.81%.\n\nIn 1977, the Communist and Socialist parties failed to update the ''Common Programme'', then lost the [[1978 French legislative election|1978 legislative election]]. While the Socialists took the leading position on the left, by obtaining more votes than the Communists for the first time [[1936 French legislative election|since 1936]], the leadership of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was challenged by an internal opposition led by [[Michel Rocard]] who criticized the programme of the PS as being \"archaic\" and \"unrealistic\". The polls indicated Rocard was more popular than Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. Nevertheless, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand won the vote at the Party's [[Metz Congress]] (1979) and Rocard renounced his candidacy for the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]].\n\nFor his third candidacy for presidency, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was not supported by the PCF but only by the PS. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand projected a reassuring image with the slogan \"the quiet force\". He campaigned for \"another politics\", based on the Socialist programme ''[[110 Propositions for France]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miroirs.ironie.org/socialisme/www.psinfo.net/elections/president/1981/index.html |title=\u00c9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 1981 |publisher=Miroirs.ironie.org |date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> and denounced the performance of the incumbent president. Furthermore, he benefited from divisions in the right-wing majority. He obtained 25.85% of votes in the first round (against 15% for the PCF candidate [[Georges Marchais]]), then defeated President Giscard d'Estaing in the second round, with 51.76%. He became the first left-wing politician elected [[President of France]] by universal suffrage.\n\n==Presidency==\n\n===First term: 1981\u20131988===\n[[File:Ronald Reagan Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 1984.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand with U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]], 1984]]\nIn the [[1981 French presidential election|presidential election of 10 May 1981]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand became the first socialist President of the Fifth Republic, and his government became the first left-wing government in 23 years. He named [[Pierre Mauroy]] as Prime Minister and organised a new [[1981 French legislative election|legislative election]]. The Socialists obtained an absolute parliamentary majority, and four Communists joined the cabinet.\n\n====Economic policy====\nThe beginning of his first term was marked by a left-wing [[economic policy]] based on the [[110 Propositions for France]] and the 1972 Common Programme between the Socialist Party, the [[Communist Party (France)|Communist Party]] and the [[Left Radical Party]]. This included several nationalizations, a 10% increase in the ''[[salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance|SMIC]]'' (minimum wage), a 39-hour work week, 5 weeks holiday per year, the creation of the [[solidarity tax on wealth]], an increase in social benefits, and the extension of workers' rights to consultation and information about their employers (through the [[Jean Auroux|Auroux Act]]). The objective was to boost economic demand and thus economic activity ([[Keynesianism]]), but the stimulative fiscal policy implemented by the Mauroy government was in contradiction with the constrained [[monetary policy]] implemented by the [[Bank of France]].<ref>Reichart, Alexandre (2015). \"[http://www.jeeh.it/articolo?urn=urn:abi:abi:RIV.JOU:2015;1.11 French Monetary Policy (1981\u20131985), A Constrained Policy, between Volcker Shock, the EMS and Macroeconomic Imbalances]\".

In 1981, the purchasing power of social transfers went up by 4.5% and by 7.6% in 1982.

As a means of increasing political participation, the government increased the financial allowances of local politicians, who also became entitled to paid leave from their jobs to attend courses in public administration. Allowances for the handicapped were improved, while improvements were also made in the pay and conditions for those serving in the army. A decree of January 1982 provided for \"solidarity contracts\" whereby firms would be subsidised for introducing part-time work or early retirement if they also allowed the creation of new jobs, while a decree of March 1982 provided employees with the right to retire at the age of 60 on 50% of average earnings during their 10 best years of employment. In 1983, legislation was passed to encourage greater equality in the private sector. Firms now had to make an annual report on the training opportunities and employment conditions for women and present a statistical analysis of their position in the firm, whilst the works committee had to ensure that equality promoting measures are taken.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Mitterrand's France'' Edited by Sonia Mazey and Michael Newman</ref> In addition, a new benefit was introduced for unemployed workers who had exhausted their eligibility for unemployment insurance.<ref name=\"Vail2009\">{{cite book |title=Recasting Welfare Capitalism Economic Adjustment in Contemporary France and Germany |first=Mark I. |last=Vail |year=2009 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-59213-967-5}}</ref> In December 1982, a law was passed that restored to workers the right to elect administrators to social security funds, which had been eliminated by Charles De Gaulle in 1967.<ref>''Contemporary France: Politics and Society Since 1945'' by D.

Priority was given to the struggle against inflation in order to remain competitive in the [[European Monetary System]]. Although there were two periods of mild economic reflation (first from 1984 to 1986 and again from 1988 to 1990), monetary and fiscal restraint was the essential policy orientation of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's presidency from 1983 onwards.<ref name=\"Smith1998\">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=W.

The government agreed at the same time to improve the pension position of some public sector employees and to increase the real value of the minimum pension. In addition, later negotiations brought retirement at 60 years into the occupational schemes although the financial terms for doing so could only be agreed for a 7-year period. A comparison between 1981 and 1986 showed that the minimum state pension had increased by 64% for a couple and by 81% for one person. During that same period, family allowances had increased by 71% for three children and by 112% for two children. In addition, the single-parent allowance for mothers or fathers with one child had been increased by 103% and for two or more children by 52% for each child\n\nIn order to mark the importance of the problems of the elderly, the government appointed a Secretary of State (attached to the Ministry of Social Affairs and National Solidarity) to carry special responsibility for them, and in an effort to try to relate policy to the felt needs of the elderly, it set up a central advisory committee to examine social policy from their point of view and carry out special studies and enquiries. This body became especially concerned with monitoring the attempts at coordination and encouraging policies which were aimed at helping he elderly stay at home instead of entering residential care.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn the field of health care, some prescription charges were abolished, hospital administration was decentralised, workers\u2019 rights in the health service were reaffirmed, and equipment was provided for researchers.<ref>''The French Socialist Party: Resurgence and Victory'' by D. S. Bell and Byron Criddle</ref> From 1983 onwards, wage-earners who had contributed to a pension fund for 37.5 years became eligible to retire on a full pension. This right was extended to the self-employed in 1984 and to farmers in 1986. People who had retired at the age of 60 were, however, not initially eligible for reductions on public transport until they reached the age of 65. The qualifying age for these reductions was, however, reduced to 62 in 1985.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">France during the socialist years by Gino Raymond</ref> A number of illegal immigrants had their position regularized under the Socialists and the conditions pertaining to residence and work permits were eased. Educational programmes were implemented to help immigrant communities, while immigrants were allowed the right to free association. The Socialist government also opened up talks with the authorities in some of the main countries of origin, easing nationality rules in the public sector, associating representatives of migrant groups with public authority work, and established an Immigrants Council in 1984.\n\nAlthough the income limit for allowances varied according to the position of the child in the family and the number of dependent children, these ceilings were made more favourable in cases where both parents were working or where a single parent was in charge and were linked to changes in wage levels. Those taking parental leave to care for three or more children (provided that they fulfilled the rules for eligibility) also received certain benefits in kind, such as a non-taxable, non-means-tested benefit and priority on vocational training courses. A new boost was also given to research into family problems including an interest in the effects of changing family structures, of women\u2019s employment and the impact of local social policies on family life.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> In addition, while a law on equal opportunities in employment was passed in July 1983 which prohibited all forms of unequal treatment regardless of the circumstances, together with providing for positive action plans to be established in major companies.

By 1986, particular attention was being focused on assisting women in single-parent families to get back into employment, in recognition of the growing problems associated with extra-marital births and marital breakdown. Parental leave was extended to firms with 100 employees in 1981 (previously, parental leave provision had been made in 1977 for firms employing at least 200 employees) and subsequently to all employees in 1984. From 1984 onwards, married women were obliged to sign tax returns, men and women were provided with equal rights in managing their common property and that of their children, and in 1985 they became responsible for each other\u2019s debts.\n\nChildcare facilities were also expanded, with the number of places in cr\u00e8ches rising steadily between 1981 and 1986.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> In addition, the minimum wage was significantly increased. From 1981 to 1984, the ''[[salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance|SMIC]]'' rose by 125%, while prices went up by only 75% during that same period.<ref>''The Death of Politics: France under Mitterrand'' by John Laughland {{page needed|date=May 2017}}</ref> Various measures were also introduced to mitigate the effects of rising unemployment. Between 1981 and 1986, there had been just over 800,000 young people placed on special work schemes, 800,000 early retirements, 200,000 enterprise allowance successes, and 30,000 retrained workers from declining industrial sectors.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n====Cultural policy====\nWith respect to cultural policies, grants were allocated to non-profit associations and community cultural initiatives,<ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|title=Hijab and the Republic: Uncovering the French Headscarf Debate|author=Winter, B.|date=2008|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-5132-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/hijabrepublicunc0000wint|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/hijabrepublicunc0000wint/page/113 113]|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> Mitterrand [[Liberalization|liberalized]] the media, created the [[Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel|CSA]] media regulation agency, and authorized [[pirate radios in France|pirate radio]] and the first private TV ([[Canal+]]), giving rise to the [[Media of France|private broadcasting]] sector.\n\nIn terms of the theatre, some transfer of resources was made from the subsidy of the national theatres to the support for theatre companies which did not necessarily have an institutional home. A significant investment was made in music education with the creation of 5 new music schools in the departements and the revamping of the Conservatoire National de la Musique at Lyon, while the range and capacity of performance facilities in Paris was considerably increased, with the Cite Musicale de la Villette and the Opera de la Bastille allowing for specialist performance in a way that was lacking in Paris previously, and a 2,000 seat concert hall called le Zenith, which was designed primarily for rock music concerts but adapted for all uses.\n\nThe Socialists continued the policies of their predecessors with the Grand Louvre project and the opening of the Picasso Museum at the Hotel Sale, while the museum budget was quadrupled and particular sums were set aside for the first time for large regional projects including the establishment of a number of new museums in the provinces such as the Ecomuseum at Chartres and the Museum of Prehistory at Carnac. A fonds regional des Acquisitions was established to assist provincial museums in the purchase of works of art, while the state actively continued an existing policy of encouraging bequests in lieu of death duties.\n\nLibraries and publishing benefited from new thinking and an injection of funds, while aid to authors and publishers was restructured and book prices were fixed once again, with the objective being to assist smaller publishing houses and specialist bookshops. The network of regional lending libraries was significantly reinforced, while financial assistance was provided for the export of French books. In addition, archaeology, ethnography and historical buildings and monuments all benefited from the general increase in resources.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n====Domestic difficulties====\nThe Left lost the 1983 municipal elections and the 1984 European Parliament election. At the same time, the [[Alain Savary|Savary Bill]], to limit the financing of private schools by local communities, caused a political crisis. It was abandoned and Mauroy resigned in July 1984. [[Laurent Fabius]] succeeded him, and the Communists left the cabinet.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand did not significantly deviate from his predecessors and he continued nuclear weapons testing in the South Pacific in spite of protests from various peace and environmentalist organizations. In 1985, French agents sank the [[Greenpeace]]-owned ex-[[Fishing trawler|trawler]] [[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|''Rainbow Warrior'']] while it was docked in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] which the group had used in demonstrations against nuclear tests, [[whaling]], and [[seal hunting]]. One Greenpeace member was killed, and when news broke of the event, a major scandal erupted that led to the resignation of Defense Minister [[Charles Hernu]]. France subsequently paid reparations of 1.8&nbsp;million USD to Greenpeace.\n\n====First Cohabitation====\nBefore the [[1986 French legislative election|1986 legislative campaign]], [[proportional representation]] was instituted in accordance with the 110 Propositions. It did not prevent, however, the victory of the [[Rally for the Republic]]/[[Union for French Democracy]] (RPR/UDF) coalition. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand thus named the RPR leader [[Jacques Chirac]] as Prime Minister. This period of government, with a President and a Prime Minister who came from two opposite coalitions, was the first time that such a combination had occurred under the Fifth Republic, and came to be known as \"[[Cohabitation (government)|Cohabitation]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FRsocialist.htm |title=Socialist Party |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date=1914-07-31 |accessdate=11 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303143326/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FRsocialist.htm |archivedate=3 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nChirac mostly handled domestic policy while Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand concentrated on his \"reserved domain\" of foreign affairs and defence. However, several conflicts erupted between the two. In one example, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand refused to sign executive decrees of liberalization, obliging Chirac to pass the measures through parliament instead. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand also reportedly gave covert support to some social movements, notably the student revolt against the university reform ([[Alain Devaquet|Devaquet Bill]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2007}} Benefiting from the difficulties of Chirac's cabinet, the President's popularity increased.\n\nWith the polls running in his favor, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand announced his candidacy in the [[1988 French presidential election|1988 presidential election]]. He proposed a moderate programme (promising \"neither nationalisations nor liberalisation\") and advocated a \"united France,\" and laid out his policy priorities in his \"Letter to the French People.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miroirs.ironie.org/socialisme/www.psinfo.net/elections/president/1988/index.html |title=\u00c9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 1988 |publisher=Miroirs.ironie.org |date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> He obtained 34% of the votes in the first round, then faced Chirac in the second, and was re-elected with 54% of the votes.

Four centre-right politicians joined the cabinet.\n\nThe second term was marked by the creation of the [[Revenu minimum d'insertion|Insertion Minimum Revenue]] (RMI), which ensured a minimum level of income to those deprived of any other form of income; the restoring of the solidarity tax on wealth, which had been abolished by Chirac's cabinet; the institution of the [[Generalized social tax]]; the extension of parental leave up to the child's third birthday;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> the reform of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]]; the 1990 [[Gayssot Act]] on [[hate speech]] and [[Holocaust denial]]; the Besson law of 1990;<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/gov/publicsectorinnovationande-government/2537279.pdf] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the Mermaz Law of 1989;,<ref name=\"justlanded\">{{cite web|url=http://www.justlanded.com/english/France/Articles/Property/Letting-in-France|title=France: Letting in France, Rules & Regulations, Various rules and regulations apply to the letting of|publisher=justlanded.com|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> the introduction of a private childcare allowance;<ref name=\"google7\">{{cite book|title=The Politics of Post-Industrial Welfare States: Adapting Post-War Social Policies to New Social Risks|author1=Armingeon, K.|author2=Bonoli, G.|date=2007|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-134-17910-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTi2SS8egosC|page=218|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> the Urban Orientation Law of 1991;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/247-FR_Housing.pdf |title=National Analytical Study on Housing|date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> the [[Pierre Arpaillange|Arpaillange Act]] on the financing of political parties; the reform of the [[penal code]]; the [[Matignon Agreements (1988)|Matignon Agreements]] concerning [[New Caledonia]]; the [[Loi Evin|Evin Act]] on smoking in public places; the extension of the age limit for family allowances to 18 years in 1990;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref name=\"securite-sociale\">{{cite web|url=http://www.securite-sociale.fr/L-allocation-de-rentree-scolaire-est-versee-sous-conditions-de-ressources-pour-chaque-enfant?id_mot=67|title=Le portail du service public de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale / L'allocation de rentr\u00e9e scolaire est&nbsp;(...)|publisher=securite-sociale.fr|accessdate=7 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501082739/http://www.securite-sociale.fr/L-allocation-de-rentree-scolaire-est-versee-sous-conditions-de-ressources-pour-chaque-enfant?id_mot=67|archive-date=1 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the 1989 Education Act which, amongst other measures, obliged local authorities to educate all children with disabilities.<ref name=\"google8\">{{cite book|title=Implementing Inclusive Education|author=Innovation, C.E.R.|date=1997|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|isbn=9789264155893|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7N3QP75Q9wC|page=24|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> Several large architectural works were pursued, in what would become known as the [[Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] with the building of the [[Louvre Pyramid]], the [[Channel Tunnel]], the [[Grande Arche]] at [[La D\u00e9fense]], the [[Bastille Opera]], the Finance Ministry in [[Bercy]], and the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France|National Library of France]].

She was the first woman to become Prime Minister in France, but proved a costly mistake due to her tendency for making acerbic and racist public remarks. After the Socialists experienced heavy losses in the 1992 regional elections, Cresson resigned from office. Her successor [[Pierre B\u00e9r\u00e9govoy]] promised to fight unemployment and corruption but he could not prevent the catastrophic defeat of the left in the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 legislative election]]. The Socialist Party suffered a crushing defeat with the right-wing parties winning 485 seats to the left's 92. He killed himself on 1 May 1993.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand named the former RPR Finance Minister [[Edouard Balladur]] as Prime Minister. The second \"cohabitation\" was less contentious than the first, because the two men knew they were not rivals for the next presidential election. By this point, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was nearly 80 years old and suffering from cancer in addition to the shock of his friend [[Fran\u00e7ois de Grossouvre]]'s suicide. His second and last term ended after the [[1995 French presidential election|1995 presidential election]] in May 1995 with the election of [[Jacques Chirac]]. Socialist candidate [[Lionel Jospin]] lost the presidential election.\n\nOverall, as President, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand maintained the \"basic characteristic of a strong welfare base underpinned by a strong state.\" A United Nations Human Development report concluded that, from 1979 to 1989, France was the only country in the OECD (apart from Portugal) in which income inequalities did not get worse.<ref>''France since 1870: Culture, Politics, and Society'' by Charles Sowerine</ref> During his second term as president, however, the gap between rich and poor widened in France,<ref>''One Hundred Years of Socialism: The West European Left in the Twentieth Century'' by Donald Sassoon</ref> with both unemployment and poverty rising in the awake of the economic recession of 1991\u20131993.<ref>''The Mitterrand Years: Legacy and Evaluation'' edited by Mairi Maclean</ref> According to other studies, though, the percentage of the French population living in poverty (based on various criteria) fell between the mid-Eighties and the mid-Nineties.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bT-3laKFEUsC&pg=PA149&dq=poverty%20in%20france%201981-1995#v=onepage&q=poverty%20in%20france%201981-1995&f=false|title=Statistical Handbook on the Social Safety Net|first=Fernando Francisco|last=Padr\u00f3|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|via=Google Books|isbn=9781573565165}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cajWAgAAQBAJ|title=Innovations in Labour Market Policies The Australian Way: The Australian Way|last=OECD|date=17 July 2001|publisher=OECD Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9789264194502}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\n{{Main|Foreign policy of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand}}\n\n====East/West relations====\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand supported closer European collaboration and the preservation of France's special relationship with its former colonies, which he feared were falling under \"[[Anglosphere|Anglo-Saxon]] influence.\" His drive to preserve French power in Africa led to controversies concerning Paris' role during the [[Rwandan genocide]].<ref name=\"rwanda\">[http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2730430.ece Mitterrand's role revealed in Rwandan genocide warning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706182535/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2730430.ece |date=6 July 2008 }}, 3 July 2007.

When the [[European Court of Human Rights]] finally ruled against the Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand doctrine, the policy had already led to most of the criminals never being punished for their crimes.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n====1990 speech at La Baule====\nResponding to a democratic movement in Africa after the 1989 fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], he made his La Baule speech in June 1990 which tied [[development aid]] to democratic efforts from former French colonies, and during which he opposed the devaluation of the [[CFA Franc]]. Seeing an \"East wind\" blowing in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, he stated that a \"Southern wind\" was also blowing in Africa, and that state leaders had to respond to the populations' wishes and aspirations by a \"democratic opening\", which included a [[representative democracy|representative system]], free elections, [[Multi-party system|multipartyism]], [[freedom of the press]], an independent judiciary, and abolition of censorship. Claiming that France was the country making the most important effort concerning development aid, he announced that the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] (LDCs) would henceforth receive only grants from France, as opposed to loans (in order to combat the massive increase of [[Third World debt]] during the 1980s). He likewise limited the [[interest rate]] to 5% on French loans to intermediate-income countries (that is, [[Ivory Coast]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], Cameroon and [[Gabon]]).\n\nHe also criticized interventionism in sovereign matters, which was according to him only another form of \"[[colonialism]]\". However, according to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, this did not imply lessened concern on the part of Paris for its [[French colonial empire|former colonies]]. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand thus continued with the African policy of de Gaulle inaugurated in 1960, which followed the relative failure of the 1958 creation of the [[French Community]]. All in all, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's La Baule speech, which marked a relative turning point in France's policy concerning its former colonies, has been compared with the 1956 ''loi-cadre [[Gaston Defferre|Defferre]]'' which was responding to [[anti-colonialist]] feelings.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061117230046/http://helios.univ-reims.fr/Labos/CERI/Mitterrand_et_la_democratie_en_Afrique.htm#UN%20DISCOURS%20DE%20CIRCONSTANCE Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand et la d\u00e9mocratie en Afrique, huit ans apr\u00e8s], by Albert Bourgi, {{ill|Centre de recherches internationales|fr}} (CERI) (mixed study unit with the [[CNRS]], dependent of the ''[[Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques]]'') {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nAfrican heads of state themselves reacted to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's speech at most with indifference.

[[Hassan II]], the king of Morocco, said for his part that \"Africa was too open to the world to remain indifferent to what was happening around it\", but that Western countries should \"help young democracies open out, without putting a knife under their throat, without a brutal transition to multipartyism.\"<ref>[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/IMG/pdf/B0100_-fiche22sommets.pdf Les 22 premi\u00e8res conf\u00e9rences des chefs d'Etat de France et d'Afrique], on French government website \u2013 URL accessed in January 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nAll in all, the La Baule speech has been said to be on one hand \"one of the foundations of political renewal in Africa French speaking area\", and on the other hand \"cooperation with France\", this despite \"incoherence and inconsistency, like any [[public policy]]\".<ref>[http://doc-iep.univ-lyon2.fr/Ressources/Documents/Etudiants/Memoires/detail-memoire.html?ID=310 Le discours de la Baule et le pluralisme en Afrique noire francophone.

Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's family then prosecuted Gubler and his publisher for violating [[Confidentiality#Medical confidentiality|medical confidentiality]].\n\n===P\u00e9tain===\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand came under fire in 1992 when it was revealed that he had arranged for the laying of a wreath of flowers on the grave of [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] each [[Armistice Day]] since 1987. P\u00e9tain had been the leader of French forces at the dramatic [[Battle of Verdun]] in World War I, for which he was revered by his contemporaries. Later, however, he became leader of [[Vichy France]] after the French [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|defeat by Germany]] (June 1940) in World War II, collaborating with [[Nazi Germany]] and putting [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] measures into place.\n\nThe placing of such a wreath was not without precedent. Presidents [[Charles de Gaulle]] and [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] had wreaths placed on P\u00e9tain's grave to commemorate the 50th and 60th anniversaries of the end of World War I. Similarly, President [[Georges Pompidou]] had a wreath placed in 1973 when P\u00e9tain's remains were returned to the [[Ile d'Yeu]] after being stolen. Nonetheless, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's regular annual tributes went beyond the marking by his predecessors of exceptional occasions, and offended sensibilities at a time when France was re-examining its role in [[the Holocaust]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n===Urba===\nThe Urba consultancy was established in 1971 by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] to advise Socialist-led [[Communes of France|communes]] on infrastructure projects and public works. The [[Urba affair]] became public in 1989 when two police officers investigating the [[Marseille]] regional office of Urba discovered detailed minutes of the organisation's contracts and division of proceeds between the party and elected officials. Although the minutes proved a direct link between Urba and graft activity, an edict from the office of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, himself listed as a recipient, prevented further investigation. The Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand election campaign of 1988 was directed by [[Henri Nallet]], who then became [[Minister of Justice (France)|Justice Minister]] and therefore in charge of the investigation at national level. In 1990 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand declared an amnesty for those under investigation, thus ending the affair. Socialist Party treasurer [[Henri Emmanuelli]] was tried in 1997 for corruption offences, for which he received a two-year suspended sentence.\n\n===Wiretaps===\nFrom 1982 to 1986, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand established an \"anti-terror cell\" installed as a service of the President of the Republic. This was an unusual set-up, since such law enforcement missions against terrorism are normally left to the [[French National Police|National Police]] and [[French Gendarmerie|''Gendarmerie'']], run under the cabinet and the Prime Minister, and under the supervision of the judiciary. The cell was largely staffed by members of these services, but it bypassed the normal line of command and safeguards. 3000 conversations concerning 150 people (7 for reasons judged to be contestable by the ensuing court process) were recorded between January 1983 and March 1986 by this anti terrorist cell at the Elys\u00e9e Palace. In one of its first actions, the cell was involved in the \"[[Irish of Vincennes]]\" affair, in which it appeared that members of the cell had planted weapons and explosives in the Vincennes apartment of three Irish nationals who were arrested on terrorism charges. Most markedly, it appears that the cell, under illegal [[presidential orders]], obtained [[wiretap]]s on journalists, politicians and other personalities who may have been an impediment for Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's personal life. The illegal wiretapping was revealed in 1993 by ''[[Lib\u00e9ration]]''; the case against members of the cell went to trial in November 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-387334,0.html |title=(Subscription) |work=Le Monde |location=France |accessdate=3 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324020235/http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-387334,0.html |archive-date=24 March 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netscape.qc.ca/article/?cat=Monde&article=M111351AU&ch=a|title=Le proc\u00e8s des \"\u00e9coutes de l'Elys\u00e9e\" doit commencer lundi \u00e0 Paris|last=Von Derschau|first=Verena|publisher=La Presse Canadienne|access-date=5 December 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928083952/http://www.netscape.qc.ca/article/?cat=Monde&article=M111351AU&ch=a#|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt took 20 years for the 'affaire' to come before the courts because the instructing judge [[Jean-Paul Vallat]] was at first thwarted by the 'affaire' being classed a defence secret, but in December 1999 la [[Commission consultative du secret de la d\u00e9fense nationale]] declassified part of the files concerned. The Judge finished his investigation in 2000, but it still took another four years before coming on 15 November 2004 before the 16th chamber of the ''[[Tribunal correctionnel (France)|Tribunal correctionnel]] de Paris''. 12 people were charged with  \"atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e\" (breach of privacy) and one with selling computer files. 7 were given suspended sentences and fines and 4 were found not guilty.\n\nThe affair finally ended before the ''Tribunal correctionnel de Paris'' with the court's judgement on 9 November 2005. 7 members of the President's anti-terrorist unit were condemned and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was designated as the \"inspirator and essentially the controller of the operation.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.fr/actualite/societe/0,3800002050,39369829,00.htm |title=La police fran\u00e7aise d\u00e9ploie ses grandes oreilles, 30 mai 2007 |publisher=News.fr |accessdate=3 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe court's judgement revealed that Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was motivated by keeping elements of his private life secret from the general public, such as the existence of his illegitimate daughter [[Mazarine Pingeot]] (which the writer [[Jean-Edern Hallier]], was threatening to reveal), his cancer which had been diagnosed in 1981, and the elements of his past in the Vichy R\u00e9gime which were not already public knowledge. The court judged that certain people were tapped for \"obscure\" reasons, such as [[Carole Bouquet]]'s companion, a lawyer with family in the Middle East, [[Edwy Plenel]], a journalist for ''le Monde'' who covered the ''Rainbow Warrior'' story and the Vincennes Three affair, and the lawyer Antoine Comte.

The bridge was designed by [[Ernest de Burgh]] and built in 1902-03 by William Murphy and James Taylor. The property is owned by [[Roads and Maritime Services]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. The bridge was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1474>{{cite NSW SHR|5051378|Middle Falbrook Bridge over Glennies Creek|hr=01474|accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article123442601 |title=TENDER ACCEPTED. |newspaper=[[The Maitland Daily Mercury]] |volume=7128 |issue=2751 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=3 November 1902 |accessdate=30 October 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}} </ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Timber truss bridges===\n\nTimber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid-19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\nErnest de Burgh, the designer of de Burgh truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer with the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that New South Wales was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\n===Glennies Creek Bridge===\n\nThe bridge was built in 1902-03 at a cost of [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]4,100.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article125103503 |title=local news of the week. |newspaper=[[The Maitland Weekly Mercury]] |volume=7128 |issue=521 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=26 December 1903 |accessdate=30 October 2018 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}} </ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe bridge over Glennies Creek is a de Burgh-type timber [[truss]] road bridge. It has two timber truss [[Span (architecture)|spans]], each of {{convert|28.1|m|ft}}. There are single timber approach spans at each end giving the bridge an overall length of {{convert|75.4|m|ft}}. The bridge super structure is supported by twin [[Braas Monier Building Group|Monier]] concrete cylinders with metal bracing. The bridge provides a single lane carriage way with a minimum width of {{convert|4.6|m|ft}}. A timber post-and-rail guard rail extends the full length of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe Middle Falbrook bridge is a de Burgh timber truss road bridge. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Ernest de Burgh, the designer of this type of truss.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\nde Burgh trusses were fourth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges. Designed by Public Works' engineer Ernest M. de Burgh, the de Burgh truss is an adaptation of the American [[Truss bridge#Pratt truss|Pratt truss]] design. The de Burgh truss is the first to use significant amounts of steel and iron, and did so in spite of its high cost and the government's historical preference for timber.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\nde Burgh trusses were significant technical improvements over their predecessors. The Middle Falbrook bridge has piers made from Monier pipes filled with concrete, which is representative of the emerging concrete technology in bridge construction. Middle Falbrook Bridge is located in the Hunter region, which has 15 historic bridges each constructed before 1905, and it gains heritage significance from its proximity to the high concentration of other historic bridges in the area.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\nIn 1998 there were ten surviving de Burgh trusses in NSW of the twenty built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\nThe Middle Falbrook bridge is a representative example of de Burgh timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\nMiddle Falbrook Bridge over Glennies Creek was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Ernest de Burgh, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has a small amount of aesthetic significance.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nTimber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nRare - only de Burgh truss bridge with Monier concrete pipe piers.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nRepresentative of de

is a heritage-listed [[road bridge]] that carries the Rixs Creek-Falbrook Road across the Glennies Creek, located at [[Middle Falbrook, New South Wales|Middle Falbrook]], in the [[Singleton Council]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. The bridge was designed by [[Ernest de Burgh]] and built in 1902-03 by William Murphy and James Taylor. The property is owned by [[Roads and Maritime Services]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. The bridge was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1474>{{cite NSW SHR|5051378|Middle Falbrook Bridge over Glennies Creek|hr=01474|accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article123442601 |title=TENDER ACCEPTED. |newspaper=[[The Maitland Daily Mercury]] |volume=7128 |issue=2751 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=3 November 1902 |accessdate=30 October 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}} </ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Timber truss bridges===\n\nTimber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid-19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\nErnest de Burgh, the designer of de Burgh truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer with the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that New South Wales was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\n===Glennies Creek Bridge===\n\nThe bridge was built in 1902-03 at a cost of [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]4,100.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article125103503 |title=local news of the week. |newspaper=[[The Maitland Weekly Mercury]] |volume=7128 |issue=521 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=26 December 1903 |accessdate=30 October 2018 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}} </ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe bridge over Glennies Creek is a de Burgh-type timber [[truss]] road bridge. It has two timber truss [[Span (architecture)|spans]], each of {{convert|28.1|m|ft}}. There are single timber approach spans at each end giving the bridge an overall length of {{convert|75.4|m|ft}}. The bridge super structure is supported by twin [[Braas Monier Building Group|Monier]] concrete cylinders with metal bracing. The bridge provides a single lane carriage way with a minimum width of {{convert|4.6|m|ft}}. A timber post-and-rail guard rail extends the full length of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe Middle Falbrook bridge is a de Burgh timber truss road bridge. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Ernest de Burgh, the designer of this type of truss.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\nde Burgh trusses were fourth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges. Designed by Public Works' engineer Ernest M. de Burgh, the de Burgh truss is an adaptation of the American [[Truss bridge#Pratt truss|Pratt truss]] design. The de Burgh truss is the first to use significant amounts of steel and iron, and did so in spite of its high cost and the government's historical preference for timber.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\nde Burgh trusses were significant technical improvements over their predecessors. The Middle Falbrook bridge has piers made from Monier pipes filled with concrete, which is representative of the emerging concrete technology in bridge construction. Middle Falbrook Bridge is located in the Hunter region, which has 15 historic bridges each constructed before 1905, and it gains heritage significance from its proximity to the high concentration of other historic bridges in the area.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\nIn 1998 there were ten surviving de Burgh trusses in NSW of the twenty built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\nThe Middle Falbrook bridge is a representative example of de Burgh timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\nMiddle Falbrook Bridge over Glennies Creek was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Ernest de Burgh, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has a small amount of aesthetic significance.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nTimber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nRare - only de Burgh truss bridge with Monier concrete pipe piers.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nRepresentative of de Burgh truss bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Transport|Engineering|New South Wales|Australian roads}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Australia]]\n* [[Hunter Region]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite web|author=|date=2007|title=Middle Falbrook Bridge over Glennies Creek|url=http://www.visitnsw.com.au/Operator.aspx?ProductId=9019524}}\n* {{cite web|author=Attraction Homepage|date=2007|title=Middle Falbrook Bridge over Glennies Creek|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4300131}}\n* {{cite book|last=Fraser|first=D J|date=1985|title=Timber Bridges of New South Wales}}\n* {{cite book|author=Department of Main Roads, NSW|date=1987|title=Timber Truss Bridge Maintenance Handbook}}\n* {{cite web|author=Roads and Traffic Authority|date=|title=S. 170 Register|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4300131}}\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC|name=Middle Falbrook Bridge over Glennies Creek|dno=5051378|id=1474|year=2018|accessdate=13 October 2018}}\n\n{{Road infrastructure in regional New South Wales}}\n\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Road bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Middle Falbrook, New South Wales]]\n[[Category:1903 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1903]]\n[[Category:Truss bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:Wooden bridges in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAttribution:{{Hunter Region places and items of interest}}", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glennies_Creek_bridge,_Middle_Falbrook"}

The first wave of invasions occurred from the 1220s into the 1240s. In [[Eastern Europe]], the Mongols destroyed [[Volga Bulgaria]], [[Cumania]], and [[Russian principalities]] such as [[Kievan Rus'|Kiev]] and [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Vladimir]]. In [[Central Europe]], the Mongol armies launched a two-pronged invasion of [[fragmented Poland]], culminating in the [[Battle of Legnica]] (9 April 1241), and the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]], culminating in the [[Battle of Mohi]] (11 April 1241).<ref>{{cite book|authorlink1=Thomas T.

The newly reunited army then withdrew to the [[Saj\u00f3]] river where they inflicted a decisive defeat on King [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]] at the [[Battle of Mohi]].

Surprise gave the Poles an initial advantage and they managed to kill many Mongol soldiers. When the invaders realized the actual numerical weakness of the [[Poles]], they regrouped, broke through the Polish ranks and defeated them. During the fighting, many Polish prisoners of war found ways to escape and hide in the nearby woods. The Polish defeat was partly influenced by the initially successful Polish knights having been distracted by looting.\n\n===Invasion of Czech lands===\nAfter the defeat of the European forces at Legnica, the Mongols then continued pillaging throughout Poland's neighboring kingdoms, particularly  [[Silesia]] and [[Moravia]].

Some Magyars (Hungarians), left behind during the main migration to the [[Pannonian plain|Pannonian basin]], still lived on the banks of the upper [[Volga]] (it is believed by some{{who|date=August 2018}} that the descendants of this group are the modern-day [[Bashkirs]], although this people now speaks a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language, not Magyar). In 1237 a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]], [[Friar Julian|Julianus]], set off on an expedition to lead them back, and was sent back to King B\u00e9la with a letter from Batu Khan. In this letter, Batu called upon the Hungarian king to surrender his kingdom unconditionally to the [[Tatar]] forces or face complete destruction. B\u00e9la did not reply, and two more messages were later delivered to Hungary. The first, in 1239, was sent by the defeated [[Cumans|Cuman]] tribes, who asked for and received asylum in Hungary. The second was sent in February 1241 by the defeated Polish princes.\n\nOnly then did King B\u00e9la call upon his magnates to join his army in defense of the country. He also asked the papacy and the Western European rulers for help. Foreign help came in the form of a small knight-detachment under the leadership of [[Frederick II, Duke of Austria]], but it was too small to change the outcome of the campaign. The majority of the Hungarian magnates also did not realize the urgency of the matter. Some may have hoped that a defeat of the royal army would force B\u00e9la to discontinue his centralization efforts and thus strengthen their own power.\n\nAlthough the Mongol danger was real and imminent, Hungary was not prepared to deal with it; in the minds of a people who had lived free from nomadic invasions for the last few hundred years, an invasion seemed impossible, and Hungary was no longer a predominantly soldier population. Only rich nobles were trained as heavy-armored cavalry. The Hungarians had long since forgotten the light-cavalry strategy and tactics of their ancestors, which were similar to those now used by the Mongols. The Hungarian army (some 60,000 on the eve of the [[Battle of Mohi]]) was made up of individual knights with tactical knowledge, discipline, and talented commanders. Because his army was not experienced in nomadic warfare, King B\u00e9la welcomed the Cuman King Kuthen (also known as [[Kotony]]) and his fighters. However, the Cuman invitation proved detrimental to the Hungarians because Batu Khan considered this acceptance of a group he considered rebels as justifications for his invasion of Hungary. After rumors began to circulate in Hungary that the Cumans were agents of the Mongols, some hot-headed Hungarians attacked the Cuman camp and killed Kotony. This led the enraged Cumans to ride south, looting, ravaging the countryside, and slaughtering the unsuspecting Magyar population. The Austrian troops retreated to Austria shortly thereafter to gain more western aid. The Hungarians now stood alone in the defense of their country.\n\n[[File:Battle of Mohi 1241.PNG|250px|thumb|right|Battle of Mohi in a Medieval-era depiction]]\n\nThe 1241 Mongol invasion first affected [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] (situated east and south of the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]). Tens of thousands of Wallachians and Moldavians lost their lives defending their territories from the [[Golden Horde]]. Crops and goods plundered from Wallachian settlements seem to have been a primary supply source for the Golden Horde. The invaders killed up to half of the population and burned down most of their settlements, thus destroying much of the cultural and economic records from that period. Neither Wallachians nor the army of Hungary offered much resistance against the Mongols.<ref name='VioletaEpure'>{{cite web |url=http://rocsir.goldenideashome.com/archiv/2004_1-2/2VioletaEpure2004.pdf |title=''Invazia mongol\u0103 \u00een Ungaria \u015fi spa\u0163iul rom\u00e2nesc'' |accessdate=2009-02-05 |last=Epure |first=Violeta-Anca |work=ROCSIR - Revista Rom\u00e2na de Studii Culturale (pe Internet) |language=Romanian |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151014083856/http://rocsir.goldenideashome.com/archiv/2004_1-2/2VioletaEpure2004.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-14 }}</ref> The swiftness of the invasion took many by surprise and forced them to retreat and hide in forests and the enclosed valleys of the Carpathians. In the end, however, the main target of the invasion was the Kingdom of Hungary.<ref name='VioletaEpure'/>\n\nThe Hungarian army arrived and encamped at the [[Saj\u00f3]] River on April 10, 1241, without having been directly challenged by the Mongols. The Mongols, having largely concealed their positions, began their attack the next night; after heavier-than-expected losses inflicted by Hungarian crossbowmen, the Mongols adjusted their strategy and routed the Hungarian forces rapidly. A major Hungarian loss was imminent, and the Mongols intentionally left a gap in their formation to permit the wavering Hungarian forces to flee and spread out in doing so, leaving them unable to effectively resist the Mongols as they picked off the retreating Hungarian remnants. While the king escaped with the help of his bodyguard, the remaining Hungarian army was mercilessly killed by the Mongols or drowned in the river as they attempted escape. Following their decisive victory, the Mongols now systematically occupied the [[Great Hungarian Plain]]s, the slopes of the northern [[Carpathian Mountains]], and [[Transylvania]]. Where they found local resistance, they ruthlessly killed the population. Where the locale offered no resistance, they forced the men into servitude in the Mongol army. Still, tens of thousands avoided Mongol domination by taking refuge behind the walls of the few existing [[fortresses]] or by hiding in the forests or large marshes along the rivers. The Mongols, instead of leaving the defenseless and helpless people and continuing their campaign through [[Pannonia]] to Western Europe, spent time securing and pacifying the occupied territories. On [[Christmas day]] 1241, the costly [[Siege of Esztergom (1241)|siege of Esztergom]] destroyed the capital and economic center of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], forcing the capital to be moved to [[Buda]]pest.<ref>\"Genghis Khan: his conquest, his empire, his legacy\"by Frank Lynn</ref>\n\nDuring the winter, contrary to the traditional strategy of nomadic armies which started campaigns only in spring-time, they crossed the [[Danube]] and continued their systematic occupation, including [[Pannonia]]. They eventually reached the Austrian borders and the Adriatic shores in [[Dalmatia]].

The most common reason given for this withdrawal is the Great Khan [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]]'s death on December 11, 1241. [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] died at the age of fifty-six after a binge of drinking during a hunting trip, which forced most of the Mongolian army to retreat back to Mongolia so that the princes of the blood could be present for the election of a new great khan. This is attested to by one primary source: the chronicle of [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], who after [[Europeans in Medieval China|visiting the Mongol court]], stated that the Mongols withdrew for this reason; he further stated that [[God]] had caused the Great Khan's death to protect Latin Christendom.<ref>John of Plano Carpini, \"History of the Mongols,\" in ''The Mission to Asia'', ed. Christopher Dawson (London:\nSheed and Ward, 1955), 44</ref> As Stephen Pow pointed out in his analysis of this issue, if we go by Carpini's account, a messenger would have to be able to make the journey from Mongolia to Central Europe in a little over 3 months at a minimum; the messenger would have to arrive in March, meaning he took about 3 months in the middle of winter from the time of the khan's death. Carpini himself accompanied a Mongol party in a much shorter journey (from Kiev to Mongolia) in 1246, where the party \"made great speed\" in order to reach the election ceremony in time, and made use of several horses per person while riding nearly all day and night. It took five months.<ref>Carpini, \"History of the Mongols\", 60; Pow, Deep ditches and well-built walls, pp. 19-21</ref>\n[[File:Kingdom of Galicia Volhynia Rus' Ukraine 1245 1349.jpg|thumb|Rus' states under Mongol control]]\n\n[[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid Al-Din]], a historian of the Mongol [[Ilkhanate]], explicitly states in the Ilkhanate's official histories that the Mongols were not even aware of Ogedei's death when they began their withdrawal.<ref>Rashid al-Din, Successors, 70-71.</ref> Rashid Al-Din, writing under the auspices of the Mongol Empire, had access to the official Mongol chronicle when compiling his history ([[Altan Debter]]). John Andrew Boyle asserts, based on the orthography, that Rashid Al-Din's account of the withdrawal from central Europe was taken verbatim from Mongolian records.<ref>Rashid al-Din, Successors, 10-11. Translated by John Andrew Boyle. Boyle's preamble notes: \"There are not infrequent interpolations from the Mongolian chronicle, and he even adopts its faulty chronology, in accordance with which the events of the European campaign take place a year later than in reality. In the present volume, Juvaini is down to the reign of Mongke (1251-1259) Rashid al-Din's main authority, but with considerable additional material from other sources. Thus the earlier historian's account of the invasion of eastern Europe (1241-1242) is repeated almost verbatim and is then followed, in a later chapter, by a much more detailed version of the same events, based, like the preceding description of the campaigns in Russia (1237-1240), on Mongol records, as is evident from the orthography of the proper names.\"</ref>\n\nAnother theory is that weather data preserved in tree rings points to a series of warm, dry summers in the region until 1242. When temperatures dropped and rainfall increased, the local climate shifted to a wetter and colder environment. That, in turn, caused flooding of the formerly dry grasslands and created a marshy terrain. Those conditions would have been less than ideal for the nomadic Mongol cavalry and their encampments, reducing their mobility and pastureland, curtailing their invasion into Europe west of the Hungarian plain,<ref name=\"climate change\">{{cite web|title=Climate probably stopped Mongols cold in Hungary, Science News, Science Ticker: Climate, Anthropology|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/climate-probably-stopped-mongols-cold-hungary?tgt=nr|year=2016|work=By Helen Thompson|accessdate=26 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803134208/https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/climate-probably-stopped-mongols-cold-hungary?tgt=nr|archivedate=3 August 2016}}</ref> and hastening their retreat.\n\nThe true reasons for the Mongol withdrawal are not fully known, but numerous plausible explanations exist. The Mongol invasion had bogged down into a series of costly and frustrating sieges, where they gained little loot and ran into stiff resistance. They had lost a large number of men despite their victories (see above). Finally, they were stretched thin in the European theater, and were experiencing a rebellion by the [[Cumans]] in what is now southern Russia, and the [[Caucasus]] (Batu returned to put it down, and spent roughly a year doing so).<ref>Rashid al-Din, Successors, 71-72.</ref> Others argue Europe's bad weather had an effect: Hungary has a high water table so it floods easily. An analysis of tree rings there found that Hungary had cold wet weather in early 1242, which likely turned Hungary's central plain into a huge swamp; so, lacking pastures for their horses, the Mongols would have had to fall back to Russia in search of better grasslands.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Climatic and environmental aspects of the Mongol withdrawal from Hungary in 1242 CE|first1=Ulf|last1=B\u00fcntgen|first2=Nicola|last2=Di Cosmo|date=26 May 2016|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|issue=1|pages=25606|doi=10.1038/srep25606|pmid = 27228400|df=|pmc=4881396|bibcode=2016NatSR...625606B}}</ref>\n\nRegardless of their reasons, the Mongols had completely withdrawn from Central Europe by mid-1242, though they still launched military operations in the west at this time, most notably the 1241\u20131243 [[Mongol invasion of Anatolia]]. Batu specifically decided against attending the kurultai in favor of staying in Europe, which delayed the ceremony for several years.<ref>J. J. Saunders, ''The History of the Mongol Conquests'' (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1971), 79.</ref>\n\nThe historian [[Jack Weatherford]] claims that European survival was due to Mongol unwillingness to fight in the more densely populated German principalities, where the weather affected the glue and sinew of the [[Mongol bow]]s. However, a counter to this assertion is that the Mongols were willing to fight in the densely populated areas of Song China and India. Furthermore, the Mongols were able to conquer Southern China which is located in a tropical climate zone and would have received far more rainfall and humidity than anywhere in Europe.<ref>[[Climate]]</ref><ref>[[Rain#Wettest known locations]]</ref> The territory of Western Europe had more forests and castles than the Mongols were accustomed, and there were opportunities for the European heavy cavalry to counter-attack. Also, despite the steppe tactics of the Avars and early Hungarians, both were defeated by Western states in the 9th and 10th centuries. A significant number of important castles and towns in Hungary had also resisted the formidable and infamous Mongol siege tactics.\n\nSir [[John Keegan]] claimed the Mongols failed against the geographical and weather conditions of Europe:\n\n<blockquote>[The Mongol armies], ferocious though they were, ultimately failed to translate their light cavalry power from the semi-temperate and desert regions where it flourished in to the high-rainfall zone of Western Europe.  Whenever [they] encountered ... peoples living by intensive agriculture, accumulating thereby food surpluses which enabled them to sustain campaigns longer than the foraging nomads ever could, and breeding on their rich grasslands horses which outmatched the nomad pony in battle, [they] had to admit defeat.  Light cavalry conquerors were in time either forced back into the arid environment where nomadism flourished, as on the borders of Western Europe, or, as in China, corrupted by the softness of agricultural civilization and absorbed by it.<ref>Sir John Keegan (1987) [i]The Mask of Command[/i], Viking: London, page 118</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome historians believe that the reason for Batu's stopping at the Mohi River was that he never intended to advance further.<ref name=\"deremilitari\">{{cite web|title=The Mongols in the West, Journal of Asian History v.33 n.1|url=http://www.deremilitari.org/resources/articles/sinor1.htm|year=1999|work=By Denis Sinor|accessdate=16 August 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901020511/http://deremilitari.org/resources/articles/sinor1.htm|archivedate=1 September 2009}}</ref> He had made the Russian conquest safe for the years to come, and when the Great Khan died and Batu rushed back to Mongolia to put in his claim for power, it ended his westward expansion. Subutai's recall at the same time left the Mongol armies without their spiritual head and primary strategist. Batu Khan was not able to resume his plans for conquest to the \"Great Sea\" (the Atlantic Ocean) until 1255, after the turmoil after \u00d6gedei's death had finally subsided with the election of [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] as Great Khan. Though he was capable of invading Western Europe, he was no longer interested.\n\n===Mongol infighting===\nFrom 1241 to 1248 a state of almost open warfare existed between Batu, son of Jochi, and [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]], son of \u00d6gedei. The Mongol Empire was ruled by a regency under \u00d6gedei's widow [[T\u00f6regene Khatun]], whose only goal was to secure the Great Khanate for her son, G\u00fcy\u00fck. There was so much bitterness between the two branches of the family that G\u00fcy\u00fck died in 1248 on his way to confront Batu to force him to accept his authority. He also had problems in his last years with the Principality of Halych-Volhynia, whose ruler, [[Danylo of Halych]], adopted a policy of confronting the Golden Horde and defeated some Mongol assaults in 1254. He was only defeated in 1259, under the Berke's rule. Batu Khan was unable to turn his army west until 1255, after M\u00f6ngke had become Great Khan in 1251, and he had repaired his relations with the Great Khanate. However, as he prepared to finish the invasion of Europe, he died. His son did not live long enough to implement his father and Subutai's plan to invade Europe, and with his death, Batu's younger brother [[Berke]] became Khan of the [[Kipchak Khanate]]. Berke was not interested in invading Europe as much as halting his cousin [[Hulagu Khan]] from destroying the [[Holy Land]]. Berke had converted to Islam and watched with horror as his cousin destroyed the [[Abbasid Caliph]], the spiritual head of Islam as far as Berke was concerned. The [[Mamluk]]s of Egypt, learning through spies that Berke was both a Muslim and not fond of his cousin, appealed to him for help and were careful to nourish their ties to him and his Khanate.\n\nBoth entities were [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] in origin.<ref name=\"Amitai-Preiss\">Amitai-Preiss, Reuven. ''The Mamluk-Ilkhanid War''</ref> Many of the Mamluks were of Turkic descent and Berke's Khanate was almost totally Turkic also. Jochi, Genghis Khan's oldest son, was of disputed parentage and only received 4,000 Mongol warriors to start his Khanate. His nearly 500,000 warriors were virtually all [[Turkic people]] who had submitted to the Mongols. Thus, the Khanate was Turkic in culture and had more in common with their Muslim Turkic Mamluks brothers than with the Mongol [[shamanist]] Hulagu and his horde. Thus, when Hulagu Khan began to mass his army for war against the Mamluk-controlled Holy Land, they swiftly appealed to Berke Khan who sent armies against his cousin and forced him to defend his domains in the north.\n\nHulagu returned to his lands by 1262, but instead of being able to avenge his defeats, had to turn north to face Berke Khan, suffering severe defeat in an attempted invasion north of the Caucasus in 1263, after Berke Khan had lured him north and away from the Holy Land. Thus, the Kipchak Khanate never invaded Europe; keeping watch to the south and east instead. Berke only sent troops into Europe twice, in two relatively light raids in 1259 and 1265, simply to collect booty he needed to pay for his wars against Hulagu from 1262\u201365.\n\n==Europe at the time of the Mongol invasion==\nThe Papacy had rejected the pleas of Georgia in favor of launching crusades in Spain and the Middle East, as well as preaching a Crusade against Kievan Rus in 1238 for refusing to join his earlier Balkan Crusade. Meanwhile, [[Emperor Frederick II]], a well-educated ruler, wanted to annex Italy to unite his separated kingdoms of Germany and Sicily. In addition to calling a council to depose the Holy Roman Emperor, Pope Gregory IX and his successor Innocent IV excommunicated Frederick four times and labeled him the [[Antichrist]].<ref>Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan (2015); Chris Peers, the Mongol War Machine (2015); Timothy May, the Mongol Art of War (2016). pp. 448-51</ref>\n\nIn the 1240s the efforts of Christendom were already divided between five Crusades, only one of which was aimed against the Mongols. Initially, when Bela sent messengers to the Pope to request a Crusade against the Mongols, the Pope tried to convince them to instead join his Crusade against the Holy Roman Emperor. Eventually Pope Gregory did promise a Crusade and the Church finally helped sanction a small Crusade against the Mongols in mid-1241, but it was diverted when he died in August 1241. Instead of fighting the Mongols, the resources gathered by the Crusade was used to fight a Crusade against the Hohenstaufen Dynasty after the German barons revolted against the Holy Roman Emperor's son Conrad in September 1241.<ref>Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan (2015); Chris Peers, the Mongol War Machine (2015); Timothy May, the Mongol Art of War (2016). pp. 450-1.</ref>\n\n==Later raids==\nThe [[Golden Horde]] raids in the 1280s (those in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland), were much greater in scale than anything since the 1241\u20131242 invasion, thanks to the lack of civil war in the Mongol Empire at the time. They have sometimes been collectively referred to as \"the second Mongol invasion of Europe\", \"the second Tatar-Mongol invasion of central and south-eastern Europe\",<ref>Peter Jackson, \"The Mongols and the West\", 2005.

[[Lublin]], [[Sieradz]], [[Sandomierz]], [[Zawichost]], [[Krak\u00f3w]], and [[Bytom]] were ravaged and plundered. Berke had no intention of occupying or conquering Poland. After this raid the [[Pope Alexander IV]] tried without success to organize a crusade against the Tatars.\n\n{{main|Third Mongol invasion of Poland}}\nAn unsuccessful invasion followed in 1287, led by [[Talabuga]] and Nogai Khan. 30,000 men (three tumens) in two columns under Nogai (10,000 Mongol cavalry) and Talabuga (20,000 Mongols and Ruthenians) respectively raided Lesser Poland to plunder the area and meet up north of [[Krak\u00f3w]]. Lublin, [[Mazovia]], and [[Sieradz]] were successfully raided, but the Mongols failed to capture Sandomierz and Krak\u00f3w and were repulsed with heavy casualties when they attempted to assault the cities, although the cities were devastated. Talabuga's main army (the rest of his column having dissolved across the countryside for raiding) was defeated by Duke [[Leszek II the Black|Leszek II]] at the [[Battle of \u0141ag\u00f3w]]. After this severe setback, Talabuga linked back up with the raiding parties and fled Poland with the loot that was already taken. Nogai's column, after suffering losses during the assault on Krak\u00f3w, split up to raid the lands both north and south of the city. One detachment headed towards the town of [[Stary S\u0105cz]], another to [[Podol\u00ednec]], and others to the [[Duchy of Sieradz]]. The first detachment was surprised and defeated by the Poles and their Hungarian allies in the [[Battle of Stary S\u0105cz]], while the second devastated the area of [[Podhale]] while skirmishing with the locals. After the defeat at Stary S\u0105cz, Nogai's whole column retreated into Ruthenia.<ref>Stanis\u0142aw Krakowski, ''Polska w walce z najazdami tatarskimi w XIII wieku'', MON, 1956.</ref>\n\n===Against Byzantine Thrace (1265, 1324 and 1337)===\n{{main|Mongol invasion of Thrace}}\nDuring the reign of Berke there was also a raid against [[Thrace]]. In the winter of 1265, the Bulgarian czar, Constantine Tych, requested Mongol intervention against the Byzantines in the Balkans. [[Nogai Khan]] led a Mongol raid of 20,000 cavalry (two ''tumens'') against the territories of Byzantine eastern Thrace. In early 1265, [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]] confronted the Mongols, but his smaller squadron apparently had very low morale and was quickly routed. Most of them were cut down as they fled. Michael was forced to retreat to Constantinople on a Genoese ship while Nogai's army plundered all of Thrace. Following this defeat, the Byzantine emperor made an alliance with the [[Golden Horde]] (which was massively beneficial for the latter), giving his daughter [[Euphrosyne Palaiologina (daughter of Michael VIII)|Euphrosyne]] in marriage to Nogai. Michael also sent much valuable fabric to Golden Horde as tribute.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Grousset The Empire of Steppes, page 399-400</ref>\n\nAlso during [[Uzbeg Khan]] reign Thrace suffered raids in 1324 and 1337.<ref>Denis Sinor, \"The Mongols in the West.\" ''Journal of Asian History'' (1999) pp: 1-44.</ref>\n\n===Against Bulgaria (1271, 1274, 1280 and 1285)===\nThe successors of Tsar Ivan Asen II \u2013 the regency of Kaliman Asen I decided to pay tax to the [[Golden Horde]]. In 1271 Nogai Khan led a successful raid against the country, which was a vassal of the Golden Horde until the early 14th century. Bulgaria was again raided by the Tatars in 1274, 1280 and 1285. In 1278 and 1279 Tsar [[Ivailo]] lead the Bulgarian army and crushed the Mongol raids before being surrounded at [[Silistra]].<ref>\u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0435\u0432 (Andreev), \u0419\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043d (Jordan); \u041b\u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432 (Lalkov), \u041c\u0438\u043b\u0447\u043e (Milcho) (1996). \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0445\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u0438 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0435 (The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars) (in Bulgarian). \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e \u0422\u044a\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e (Veliko Tarnovo): \u0410\u0431\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0440 (Abagar). {{ISBN|954-427-216-X}}.pp. 222</ref> After a three-month siege, he managed to once again break through the elite Mongol forces, forcing them to retreat north of the Danube. In 1280 a rebellion inspired by Byzantium left [[Ivailo]] without much support, and so he fled to [[Nogai Khan|Nogai]]'s camp, asking him for help before being killed by the Mongols. Tsar [[George I of Bulgaria|George I]], however, became a Mongol vassal before the Mongol threat was finally ended with the reign of [[Theodore Svetoslav]].\n[[File:MongolsInHungary1285.jpg|thumb|Mongol invasion of Hungary in 1285]]\n\n===Against Hungary (1285)===\n{{Main|Second Mongol invasion of Hungary}}\n\nIn 1285 Nogai Khan led a raid of Hungary alongside [[Talabuga]].

The newly reunited army then withdrew to the [[Saj\u00f3]] river where they inflicted a decisive defeat on King [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]] at the [[Battle of Mohi]].

Some Magyars (Hungarians), left behind during the main migration to the [[Pannonian plain|Pannonian basin]], still lived on the banks of the upper [[Volga]] (it is believed by some{{who|date=August 2018}} that the descendants of this group are the modern-day [[Bashkirs]], although this people now speaks a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language, not Magyar). In 1237 a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]], [[Friar Julian|Julianus]], set off on an expedition to lead them back, and was sent back to King B\u00e9la with a letter from Batu Khan. In this letter, Batu called upon the Hungarian king to surrender his kingdom unconditionally to the [[Tatar]] forces or face complete destruction. B\u00e9la did not reply, and two more messages were later delivered to Hungary. The first, in 1239, was sent by the defeated [[Cumans|Cuman]] tribes, who asked for and received asylum in Hungary. The second was sent in February 1241 by the defeated Polish princes.\n\nOnly then did King B\u00e9la call upon his magnates to join his army in defense of the country. He also asked the papacy and the Western European rulers for help. Foreign help came in the form of a small knight-detachment under the leadership of [[Frederick II, Duke of Austria]], but it was too small to change the outcome of the campaign. The majority of the Hungarian magnates also did not realize the urgency of the matter. Some may have hoped that a defeat of the royal army would force B\u00e9la to discontinue his centralization efforts and thus strengthen their own power.\n\nAlthough the Mongol danger was real and imminent, Hungary was not prepared to deal with it; in the minds of a people who had lived free from nomadic invasions for the last few hundred years, an invasion seemed impossible, and Hungary was no longer a predominantly soldier population. Only rich nobles were trained as heavy-armored cavalry. The Hungarians had long since forgotten the light-cavalry strategy and tactics of their ancestors, which were similar to those now used by the Mongols. The Hungarian army (some 60,000 on the eve of the [[Battle of Mohi]]) was made up of individual knights with tactical knowledge, discipline, and talented commanders. Because his army was not experienced in nomadic warfare, King B\u00e9la welcomed the Cuman King Kuthen (also known as [[Kotony]]) and his fighters. However, the Cuman invitation proved detrimental to the Hungarians because Batu Khan considered this acceptance of a group he considered rebels as justifications for his invasion of Hungary. After rumors began to circulate in Hungary that the Cumans were agents of the Mongols, some hot-headed Hungarians attacked the Cuman camp and killed Kotony. This led the enraged Cumans to ride south, looting, ravaging the countryside, and slaughtering the unsuspecting Magyar population. The Austrian troops retreated to Austria shortly thereafter to gain more western aid. The Hungarians now stood alone in the defense of their country.\n\n[[File:Battle of Mohi 1241.PNG|250px|thumb|right|Battle of Mohi in a Medieval-era depiction]]\n\nThe 1241 Mongol invasion first affected [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] (situated east and south of the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]). Tens of thousands of Wallachians and Moldavians lost their lives defending their territories from the [[Golden Horde]]. Crops and goods plundered from Wallachian settlements seem to have been a primary supply source for the Golden Horde. The invaders killed up to half of the population and burned down most of their settlements, thus destroying much of the cultural and economic records from that period. Neither Wallachians nor the army of Hungary offered much resistance against the Mongols.<ref name='VioletaEpure'>{{cite web |url=http://rocsir.goldenideashome.com/archiv/2004_1-2/2VioletaEpure2004.pdf |title=''Invazia mongol\u0103 \u00een Ungaria \u015fi spa\u0163iul rom\u00e2nesc'' |accessdate=2009-02-05 |last=Epure |first=Violeta-Anca |work=ROCSIR - Revista Rom\u00e2na de Studii Culturale (pe Internet) |language=Romanian |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151014083856/http://rocsir.goldenideashome.com/archiv/2004_1-2/2VioletaEpure2004.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-14 }}</ref> The swiftness of the invasion took many by surprise and forced them to retreat and hide in forests and the enclosed valleys of the Carpathians. In the end, however, the main target of the invasion was the Kingdom of Hungary.<ref name='VioletaEpure'/>\n\nThe Hungarian army arrived and encamped at the [[Saj\u00f3]] River on April 10, 1241, without having been directly challenged by the Mongols. The Mongols, having largely concealed their positions, began their attack the next night; after heavier-than-expected losses inflicted by Hungarian crossbowmen, the Mongols adjusted their strategy and routed the Hungarian forces rapidly. A major Hungarian loss was imminent, and the Mongols intentionally left a gap in their formation to permit the wavering Hungarian forces to flee and spread out in doing so, leaving them unable to effectively resist the Mongols as they picked off the retreating Hungarian remnants. While the king escaped with the help of his bodyguard, the remaining Hungarian army was mercilessly killed by the Mongols or drowned in the river as they attempted escape. Following their decisive victory, the Mongols now systematically occupied the [[Great Hungarian Plain]]s, the slopes of the northern [[Carpathian Mountains]], and [[Transylvania]]. Where they found local resistance, they ruthlessly killed the population. Where the locale offered no resistance, they forced the men into servitude in the Mongol army. Still, tens of thousands avoided Mongol domination by taking refuge behind the walls of the few existing [[fortresses]] or by hiding in the forests or large marshes along the rivers. The Mongols, instead of leaving the defenseless and helpless people and continuing their campaign through [[Pannonia]] to Western Europe, spent time securing and pacifying the occupied territories. On [[Christmas day]] 1241, the costly [[Siege of Esztergom (1241)|siege of Esztergom]] destroyed the capital and economic center of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], forcing the capital to be moved to [[Buda]]pest.<ref>\"Genghis Khan: his conquest, his empire, his legacy\"by Frank Lynn</ref>\n\nDuring the winter, contrary to the traditional strategy of nomadic armies which started campaigns only in spring-time, they crossed the [[Danube]] and continued their systematic occupation, including [[Pannonia]]. They eventually reached the Austrian borders and the Adriatic shores in [[Dalmatia]]. The Mongols appointed a ''[[darughachi]]'' in Hungary and minted coins in the name of Khagan.<ref>[[Michael Prawdin]], Gerard (INT) Chaliand ''The Mongol Empire'', p.268</ref> According to [[Michael Prawdin]], the country of B\u00e9la was assigned to Orda by Batu as an [[appanage]].  At least 20%-40% of the population died, by slaughter or epidemic. [[Rogerius of Apulia]], an [[Italian people|Italian]] monk and chronicler who witnessed and survived the invasion, pointed out not only the genocidal element of the occupation, but also that the Mongols especially \"found pleasure\" in humiliating local women.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Richard Bessel|author2=Dirk Schumann|title=Life after death: approaches to a cultural and social history of Europe during the 1940s and 1950s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NilW70Yol74C&pg=PA143|accessdate=1 October 2011|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00922-5|pages=143\u2013}}</ref> But while the Mongols claimed control of Hungary, they could not occupy fortified cities such as [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r|Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]], [[Veszpr\u00e9m]], [[Tihany]], [[Gy\u0151r]], [[Pannonhalma]], [[Mosonmagyar\u00f3v\u00e1r|Moson]], [[Sopron]], [[Vasv\u00e1r]], [[\u00dajhely]], Zala, [[L\u00e9ka]], [[Pozsony]], [[Nyitra]], [[Kom\u00e1rom]], [[F\u00fclek]] and [[Aba\u00fajv\u00e1r]]. Learning from this lesson, fortresses came to play a significant role in Hungary. King B\u00e9la IV rebuilt the country and invested in fortifications. Facing a shortage of money, he welcomed the settlement of Jewish families, investors, and tradesmen, granting them citizenship rights. The King also welcomed tens of thousands of Kun (Cumans) who had fled the country before the invasion. Chinese [[fire arrow]]s were deployed by Mongols against the city of Buda on December 25, 1241, which they overran.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-hMtbFlKW5AC&pg=PT11&dq=mongol+invasion+hungary+chinese+gunpowder#v=onepage&q=mongol%20%20hungary%20chinese%20gunpowder&f=false|title=This Is Rocket Science: True Stories of the Risk-Taking Scientists Who Figure Out Ways to Explore Beyond Earth |author=Gloria Skurzynski|accessdate=2011-11-28  |edition=illustrated |series= |volume= |year=2010 |publisher=National Geographic Books |location= |language= |isbn=978-1-4263-0597-9 |page=1958 |quote=In A.D. 1232 an army of 30,000 Mongol warriors invaded the Chinese city of Kai-fung-fu, where the Chinese fought back with fire arrows...Mongol leaders learned from their enemies and found ways to make fire arrows even more deadly as their invasion spread toward Europe.

To improve their defense capabilities for the future, they had to build forts, not only on the borders but also inside the country.

The most common reason given for this withdrawal is the Great Khan [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]]'s death on December 11, 1241. [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] died at the age of fifty-six after a binge of drinking during a hunting trip, which forced most of the Mongolian army to retreat back to Mongolia so that the princes of the blood could be present for the election of a new great khan. This is attested to by one primary source: the chronicle of [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], who after [[Europeans in Medieval China|visiting the Mongol court]], stated that the Mongols withdrew for this reason; he further stated that [[God]] had caused the Great Khan's death to protect Latin Christendom.<ref>John of Plano Carpini, \"History of the Mongols,\" in ''The Mission to Asia'', ed. Christopher Dawson (London:\nSheed and Ward, 1955), 44</ref> As Stephen Pow pointed out in his analysis of this issue, if we go by Carpini's account, a messenger would have to be able to make the journey from Mongolia to Central Europe in a little over 3 months at a minimum; the messenger would have to arrive in March, meaning he took about 3 months in the middle of winter from the time of the khan's death. Carpini himself accompanied a Mongol party in a much shorter journey (from Kiev to Mongolia) in 1246, where the party \"made great speed\" in order to reach the election ceremony in time, and made use of several horses per person while riding nearly all day and night. It took five months.<ref>Carpini, \"History of the Mongols\", 60; Pow, Deep ditches and well-built walls, pp. 19-21</ref>\n[[File:Kingdom of Galicia Volhynia Rus' Ukraine 1245 1349.jpg|thumb|Rus' states under Mongol control]]\n\n[[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid Al-Din]], a historian of the Mongol [[Ilkhanate]], explicitly states in the Ilkhanate's official histories that the Mongols were not even aware of Ogedei's death when they began their withdrawal.<ref>Rashid al-Din, Successors, 70-71.</ref> Rashid Al-Din, writing under the auspices of the Mongol Empire, had access to the official Mongol chronicle when compiling his history ([[Altan Debter]]). John Andrew Boyle asserts, based on the orthography, that Rashid Al-Din's account of the withdrawal from central Europe was taken verbatim from Mongolian records.<ref>Rashid al-Din, Successors, 10-11. Translated by John Andrew Boyle. Boyle's preamble notes: \"There are not infrequent interpolations from the Mongolian chronicle, and he even adopts its faulty chronology, in accordance with which the events of the European campaign take place a year later than in reality. In the present volume, Juvaini is down to the reign of Mongke (1251-1259) Rashid al-Din's main authority, but with considerable additional material from other sources. Thus the earlier historian's account of the invasion of eastern Europe (1241-1242) is repeated almost verbatim and is then followed, in a later chapter, by a much more detailed version of the same events, based, like the preceding description of the campaigns in Russia (1237-1240), on Mongol records, as is evident from the orthography of the proper names.\"</ref>\n\nAnother theory is that weather data preserved in tree rings points to a series of warm, dry summers in the region until 1242. When temperatures dropped and rainfall increased, the local climate shifted to a wetter and colder environment. That, in turn, caused flooding of the formerly dry grasslands and created a marshy terrain. Those conditions would have been less than ideal for the nomadic Mongol cavalry and their encampments, reducing their mobility and pastureland, curtailing their invasion into Europe west of the Hungarian plain,<ref name=\"climate change\">{{cite web|title=Climate probably stopped Mongols cold in Hungary, Science News, Science Ticker: Climate, Anthropology|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/climate-probably-stopped-mongols-cold-hungary?tgt=nr|year=2016|work=By Helen Thompson|accessdate=26 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803134208/https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/climate-probably-stopped-mongols-cold-hungary?tgt=nr|archivedate=3 August 2016}}</ref> and hastening their retreat.\n\nThe true reasons for the Mongol withdrawal are not fully known, but numerous plausible explanations exist. The Mongol invasion had bogged down into a series of costly and frustrating sieges, where they gained little loot and ran into stiff resistance. They had lost a large number of men despite their victories (see above). Finally, they were stretched thin in the European theater, and were experiencing a rebellion by the [[Cumans]] in what is now southern Russia, and the [[Caucasus]] (Batu returned to put it down, and spent roughly a year doing so).<ref>Rashid al-Din, Successors, 71-72.</ref> Others argue Europe's bad weather had an effect: Hungary has a high water table so it floods easily. An analysis of tree rings there found that Hungary had cold wet weather in early 1242, which likely turned Hungary\u2019s central plain into a huge swamp; so, lacking pastures for their horses, the Mongols would have had to fall back to Russia in search of better grasslands.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Climatic and environmental aspects of the Mongol withdrawal from Hungary in 1242 CE|first1=Ulf|last1=B\u00fcntgen|first2=Nicola|last2=Di Cosmo|date=26 May 2016|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|issue=1|pages=25606|doi=10.1038/srep25606|pmid = 27228400|df=|pmc=4881396|bibcode=2016NatSR...625606B}}</ref>\n\nRegardless of their reasons, the Mongols had completely withdrawn from Central Europe by mid-1242, though they still launched military operations in the west at this time, most notably the 1241\u20131243 [[Mongol invasion of Anatolia]]. Batu specifically decided against attending the kurultai in favor of staying in Europe, which delayed the ceremony for several years.<ref>J. J. Saunders, ''The History of the Mongol Conquests'' (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1971), 79.</ref>\n\nThe historian [[Jack Weatherford]] claims that European survival was due to Mongol unwillingness to fight in the more densely populated German principalities, where the weather affected the glue and sinew of the [[Mongol bow]]s. However, a counter to this assertion is that the Mongols were willing to fight in the densely populated areas of Song China and India. Furthermore, the Mongols were able to conquer Southern China which is located in a tropical climate zone and would have received far more rainfall and humidity than anywhere in Europe.<ref>[[Climate]]</ref><ref>[[Rain#Wettest known locations]]</ref> The territory of Western Europe had more forests and castles than the Mongols were accustomed, and there were opportunities for the European heavy cavalry to counter-attack. Also, despite the steppe tactics of the Avars and early Hungarians, both were defeated by Western states in the 9th and 10th centuries. A significant number of important castles and towns in Hungary had also resisted the formidable and infamous Mongol siege tactics.\n\nSir [[John Keegan]] claimed the Mongols failed against the geographical and weather conditions of Europe:\n\n<blockquote>[The Mongol armies], ferocious though they were, ultimately failed to translate their light cavalry power from the semi-temperate and desert regions where it flourished in to the high-rainfall zone of Western Europe.  Whenever [they] encountered ... peoples living by intensive agriculture, accumulating thereby food surpluses which enabled them to sustain campaigns longer than the foraging nomads ever could, and breeding on their rich grasslands horses which outmatched the nomad pony in battle, [they] had to admit defeat.  Light cavalry conquerors were in time either forced back into the arid environment where nomadism flourished, as on the borders of Western Europe, or, as in China, corrupted by the softness of agricultural civilization and absorbed by it.<ref>Sir John Keegan (1987) [i]The Mask of Command[/i], Viking: London, page 118</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome historians believe that the reason for Batu's stopping at the Mohi River was that he never intended to advance further.<ref name=\"deremilitari\">{{cite web|title=The Mongols in the West, Journal of Asian History v.33 n.1|url=http://www.deremilitari.org/resources/articles/sinor1.htm|year=1999|work=By Denis Sinor|accessdate=16 August 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901020511/http://deremilitari.org/resources/articles/sinor1.htm|archivedate=1 September 2009}}</ref> He had made the Russian conquest safe for the years to come, and when the Great Khan died and Batu rushed back to Mongolia to put in his claim for power, it ended his westward expansion.

Batu Khan was not able to resume his plans for conquest to the \"Great Sea\" (the Atlantic Ocean) until 1255, after the turmoil after \u00d6gedei's death had finally subsided with the election of [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] as Great Khan. Though he was capable of invading Western Europe, he was no longer interested.\n\n===Mongol infighting===\nFrom 1241 to 1248 a state of almost open warfare existed between Batu, son of Jochi, and [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]], son of \u00d6gedei. The Mongol Empire was ruled by a regency under \u00d6gedei's widow [[T\u00f6regene Khatun]], whose only goal was to secure the Great Khanate for her son, G\u00fcy\u00fck. There was so much bitterness between the two branches of the family that G\u00fcy\u00fck died in 1248 on his way to confront Batu to force him to accept his authority. He also had problems in his last years with the Principality of Halych-Volhynia, whose ruler, [[Danylo of Halych]], adopted a policy of confronting the Golden Horde and defeated some Mongol assaults in 1254. He was only defeated in 1259, under the Berke's rule. Batu Khan was unable to turn his army west until 1255, after M\u00f6ngke had become Great Khan in 1251, and he had repaired his relations with the Great Khanate. However, as he prepared to finish the invasion of Europe, he died. His son did not live long enough to implement his father and Subutai's plan to invade Europe, and with his death, Batu's younger brother [[Berke]] became Khan of the [[Kipchak Khanate]]. Berke was not interested in invading Europe as much as halting his cousin [[Hulagu Khan]] from destroying the [[Holy Land]]. Berke had converted to Islam and watched with horror as his cousin destroyed the [[Abbasid Caliph]], the spiritual head of Islam as far as Berke was concerned. The [[Mamluk]]s of Egypt, learning through spies that Berke was both a Muslim and not fond of his cousin, appealed to him for help and were careful to nourish their ties to him and his Khanate.\n\nBoth entities were [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] in origin.<ref name=\"Amitai-Preiss\">Amitai-Preiss, Reuven. ''The Mamluk-Ilkhanid War''</ref> Many of the Mamluks were of Turkic descent and Berke's Khanate was almost totally Turkic also. Jochi, Genghis Khan's oldest son, was of disputed parentage and only received 4,000 Mongol warriors to start his Khanate. His nearly 500,000 warriors were virtually all [[Turkic people]] who had submitted to the Mongols. Thus, the Khanate was Turkic in culture and had more in common with their Muslim Turkic Mamluks brothers than with the Mongol [[shamanist]] Hulagu and his horde. Thus, when Hulagu Khan began to mass his army for war against the Mamluk-controlled Holy Land, they swiftly appealed to Berke Khan who sent armies against his cousin and forced him to defend his domains in the north.\n\nHulagu returned to his lands by 1262, but instead of being able to avenge his defeats, had to turn north to face Berke Khan, suffering severe defeat in an attempted invasion north of the Caucasus in 1263, after Berke Khan had lured him north and away from the Holy Land. Thus, the Kipchak Khanate never invaded Europe; keeping watch to the south and east instead. Berke only sent troops into Europe twice, in two relatively light raids in 1259 and 1265, simply to collect booty he needed to pay for his wars against Hulagu from 1262-65.\n\n==Europe at the time of the Mongol invasion==\nThe Papacy had rejected the pleas of Georgia in favor of launching crusades in Spain and the Middle East, as well as preaching a Crusade against Kievan Rus in 1238 for refusing to join his earlier Balkan Crusade. Meanwhile, [[Emperor Frederick II]], a well-educated ruler, wanted to annex Italy to unite his separated kingdoms of Germany and Sicily. In addition to calling a council to depose the Holy Roman Emperor, Pope Gregory IX and his successor Innocent IV excommunicated Frederick four times and labeled him the [[Antichrist]].<ref>Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan (2015); Chris Peers, the Mongol War Machine (2015); Timothy May, the Mongol Art of War (2016). pp. 448-51</ref>\n\nIn the 1240s the efforts of Christendom were already divided between five Crusades, only one of which was aimed against the Mongols. Initially, when Bela sent messengers to the Pope to request a Crusade against the Mongols, the Pope tried to convince them to instead join his Crusade against the Holy Roman Emperor. Eventually Pope Gregory did promise a Crusade and the Church finally helped sanction a small Crusade against the Mongols in mid-1241, but it was diverted when he died in August 1241. Instead of fighting the Mongols, the resources gathered by the Crusade was used to fight a Crusade against the Hohenstaufen Dynasty after the German barons revolted against the Holy Roman Emperor's son Conrad in September 1241.<ref>Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan (2015); Chris Peers, the Mongol War Machine (2015); Timothy May, the Mongol Art of War (2016). pp. 450-1.</ref>\n\n==Later raids==\nThe [[Golden Horde]] raids in the 1280s (those in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland), were much greater in scale than anything since the 1241\u20131242 invasion, thanks to the lack of civil war in the Mongol Empire at the time. They have sometimes been collectively referred to as \"the second Mongol invasion of Europe\", \"the second Tatar-Mongol invasion of central and south-eastern Europe\",<ref>Peter Jackson, \"The Mongols and the West\", 2005. Page 199</ref> or \"the second Mongol invasion of central Europe.\"<ref name=\"Victor Spinei 1986.

[[Lublin]], [[Sieradz]], [[Sandomierz]], [[Zawichost]], [[Krak\u00f3w]], and [[Bytom]] were ravaged and plundered. Berke had no intention of occupying or conquering Poland. After this raid the [[Pope Alexander IV]] tried without success to organize a crusade against the Tatars.\n\n{{main|Third Mongol invasion of Poland}}\nAn unsuccessful invasion followed in 1287, led by [[Talabuga]] and Nogai Khan. 30,000 men (three tumens) in two columns under Nogai (10,000 Mongol cavalry) and Talabuga (20,000 Mongols and Ruthenians) respectively raided Lesser Poland to plunder the area and meet up north of [[Krak\u00f3w]]. Lublin, [[Mazovia]], and [[Sieradz]] were successfully raided, but the Mongols failed to capture Sandomierz and Krak\u00f3w and were repulsed with heavy casualties when they attempted to assault the cities, although the cities were devastated. Talabuga's main army (the rest of his column having dissolved across the countryside for raiding) was defeated by Duke [[Leszek II the Black|Leszek II]] at the [[Battle of \u0141ag\u00f3w]]. After this severe setback, Talabuga linked back up with the raiding parties and fled Poland with the loot that was already taken. Nogai's column, after suffering losses during the assault on Krak\u00f3w, split up to raid the lands both north and south of the city. One detachment headed towards the town of [[Stary S\u0105cz]], another to [[Podol\u00ednec]], and others to the [[Duchy of Sieradz]]. The first detachment was surprised and defeated by the Poles and their Hungarian allies in the [[Battle of Stary S\u0105cz]], while the second devastated the area of [[Podhale]] while skirmishing with the locals. After the defeat at Stary S\u0105cz, Nogai's whole column retreated into Ruthenia.<ref>Stanis\u0142aw Krakowski, ''Polska w walce z najazdami tatarskimi w XIII wieku'', MON, 1956.</ref>\n\n===Against Byzantine Thrace (1265, 1324 and 1337)===\n{{main|Mongol invasion of Thrace}}\nDuring the reign of Berke there was also a raid against [[Thrace]]. In the winter of 1265, the Bulgarian czar, Constantine Tych, requested Mongol intervention against the Byzantines in the Balkans. [[Nogai Khan]] led a Mongol raid of 20,000 cavalry (two ''tumens'') against the territories of Byzantine eastern Thrace. In early 1265, [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]] confronted the Mongols, but his smaller squadron apparently had very low morale and was quickly routed. Most of them were cut down as they fled. Michael was forced to retreat to Constantinople on a Genoese ship while Nogai's army plundered all of Thrace. Following this defeat, the Byzantine emperor made an alliance with the [[Golden Horde]] (which was massively beneficial for the latter), giving his daughter [[Euphrosyne Palaiologina (daughter of Michael VIII)|Euphrosyne]] in marriage to Nogai. Michael also sent much valuable fabric to Golden Horde as tribute.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Grousset The Empire of Steppes, page 399-400</ref>\n\nAlso during [[Uzbeg Khan]] reign Thrace suffered raids in 1324 and 1337.<ref>Denis Sinor, \"The Mongols in the West.\" ''Journal of Asian History'' (1999) pp: 1-44.</ref>\n\n===Against Bulgaria (1271, 1274, 1280 and 1285)===\nThe successors of Tsar Ivan Asen II \u2013 the regency of Kaliman Asen I decided to pay tax to the [[Golden Horde]]. In 1271 Nogai Khan led a successful raid against the country, which was a vassal of the Golden Horde until the early 14th century. Bulgaria was again raided by the Tatars in 1274, 1280 and 1285. In 1278 and 1279 Tsar [[Ivailo]] lead the Bulgarian army and crushed the Mongol raids before being surrounded at [[Silistra]].<ref>\u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0435\u0432 (Andreev), \u0419\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043d (Jordan); \u041b\u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432 (Lalkov), \u041c\u0438\u043b\u0447\u043e (Milcho) (1996). \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0445\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u0438 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0435 (The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars) (in Bulgarian). \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e \u0422\u044a\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e (Veliko Tarnovo): \u0410\u0431\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0440 (Abagar). {{ISBN|954-427-216-X}}.pp. 222</ref> After a three-month siege, he managed to once again break through the elite Mongol forces, forcing them to retreat north of the Danube. In 1280 a rebellion inspired by Byzantium left [[Ivailo]] without much support, and so he fled to [[Nogai Khan|Nogai]]'s camp, asking him for help before being killed by the Mongols. Tsar [[George I of Bulgaria|George I]], however, became a Mongol vassal before the Mongol threat was finally ended with the reign of [[Theodore Svetoslav]].\n[[File:MongolsInHungary1285.jpg|thumb|Mongol invasion of Hungary in 1285]]\n\n===Against Hungary (1285)===\n{{Main|Second Mongol invasion of Hungary}}\n\nIn 1285 Nogai Khan led a raid of Hungary alongside [[Talabuga]].

Nogai's own column suffered serious casualties. As with later invasions, it was repelled handily, the Mongols losing much of their invading force. The outcome could not have contrasted more sharply with the 1241 invasion, mostly due to the reforms of [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|B\u00e9la IV]], which included advances in military tactics and, most importantly, the widespread building of stone [[castle]]s, both responses to the defeat of the Hungarian Kingdom in 1241.

The title track music of this film is also taken from ''Bommarillu''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with a baby taking his initial steps on a beach while the father is supporting him. The narrator in the background ([[Prosenjit Chatterjee|Prasenjit]]) states that, it is right for a father to support his child in his infancy, but questions whether the father should continue to hold the child's hand even after he is 24 years old. As the credits roll, a visibly angry Sidhu ([[Hiran Chatterjee|Hiran]]) begins uttering abuses at all the fathers in the world. When inquired about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind ([[Sabyasachi Chakrabarty]]), gives him more than what he asks for. He cites instances where his choices of dressing, hairdo and many others are stashed away by his father's. However, he vows that the two things that will be of his choice would be, his career and the woman he would marry.\n\nPost-[[Motion picture credits|credits]], Satya ([[Subhasis Mukherjee]]), the Arvind dutiful household's servant wakes up Sidhu in the morning. In the background, we see Siddhu's mother, Lakshmi ([[Laboni Sarkar]]) singing a [[devotional song]] while cooking. At the dining table, Arvind, [[Managing Director]] of their construction company, inquires if Siddhu will join their office for managing their business. When Sidhu deliberates, his father doesn't stand any longer and instead plans for his [[marriage]] despite Sidhu's silent protest. The next week, he returns home to realize that he is going to get [[engagement|engaged]] to Manasi against his wishes. He speaks with her only to realize that she is a \"daddy's girl\" and she not being to his liking. However, with Arvind's final say, they eventually get engaged.\n\nWhile contemplating on his options in a temple, Sidhu accidentally meets Priya ([[Srabanti Malakar]]), an [[engineering]] student. Seeing her chirpy nature and vibrance, Sidhu begins to like her. He makes attempts to know her by meeting her on a regular basis. In the process, he starts liking her cherubic and ever-friendly nature and as someone who does what she loves. As days go by, he realizes about so many small things in her company that gave him happiness. He realizes that he has fallen in love with her.\n\nAlongside this, Sidhu applies for a bank loan to start out on his dream of building his career. When his love for Priya deepens, he wishes to propose to her. He confesses to her that he is engaged to marry Manasi against his wishes, but what he really wants is her. On knowing of him being engaged, Priya gets dejected, but comes back a day later and asks him to do what he wishes for and accepts his proposal. At this juncture, the ecstatic Sidhu is seen by a furious Arvind. Siddhu is admonished back home and he expresses his disinterest in marriage with Manasi. When asked for his reason to like Priya, Sidhu replies saying that if Priya can stay with their family for a week, then all their questions shall be answered. He convinces Priya to stay at his house after lying to her father, Kanaka Rao ([[Sushanta Dutta]]) that she is going on a college tour.\n\nWhen Priya is introduced to Sidhu's family, she gets a lukewarm welcome. As she settles down in the house, one after the other begins to like her. Even though getting used to the living habits of the authoritarian Arvind's household was difficult, Priya stayed put for Sidhu's sake. In the meanwhile, Arvind reprimands Sidhu when he knows of his bank loan and his plans, only to further enrage Sidhu. One day the entire family along with Priya attends a marriage ceremony. A cheerful Priya cheers up the ceremony with her playful nature. Coincidentally, Kanaka Rao who happens to be around, recognizes Sidhu as the drunken young man whom he encountered on an earlier occasion. Priya realizes her father's presence and quickly exits to avoid his attention. After saving their grace, Sidhu admonishes Priya for her antics at the marriage. A sad and angry Priya moves out of the house saying that she does not find Sidhu the same and that she cannot put on an act if she stays in their house. After getting back to her house, she rebuilds the trust her father has in her while Sidhu is left forlorn. Lakshmi confronts Arvind on Sidhu's choices and wants. In the process, Sidhu opens up his heart and leaving Arvind to repent on his foolishness. Sidhu requests Manasi and her parents to call off the impending marriage. While they relent, Arvind manages to convince Kanaka babu about Sidhu and Priya's marriage. In return, Kanaka  wants to know more about Sidhu by having him live in house for a week. Arvind agrees with this and as the story returns to the pre-credits scene, the viewers are left to assume about the happy marriage of the protagonists.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hiran Chatterjee|Hiran]] - Sidhu\n* [[Srabanti Malakar]] - Priya\n* [[Sabyasachi Chakrabarty]] - Aravind (Sidhu's father)\n* Sushanta Dutta&nbsp;\u2014 Kanaka Rao (Priya's father)\n* [[Laboni Sarkar]]&nbsp;\u2014 Lakshmi (Sidhu's mother)\n* [[Locket Chatterjee]]&nbsp;\u2014 Sidhu's sister-in-law\n* [[Subhasish Mukherjee]]&nbsp;\u2014 Satya (servant)\n* [[Kamalika Banerjee]]\n* [[Pritam Saha]] - Monti (Sidhu's nephew)\n\n==Crew==\n* Producer:Ashoke Kumar Dhanuka\n* Director:Rabi Kinagi\n* Story: Bhaskar\n* Production Design:\n* Dialogue:\n* 'Lyrics:  [[Goutam Susmit]]\n* Editing:\n* Cinematography:\n* '''Music Director''': [[S.

The Title Track music of this film  is also taken from ''Bommarillu''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with a baby taking his initial steps on a beach while the father is supporting him. The narrator in the background ([[Prosenjit Chatterjee|Prasenjit]]) states that, it is right for a father to support his child in his infancy, but questions whether the father should continue to hold the child's hand even after he is 24 years old. As the credits roll, a visibly angry Sidhu ([[Hiran Chatterjee|Hiran]]) begins uttering abuses at all the fathers in the world. When inquired about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind ([[Sabyasachi Chakrabarty]]), gives him more than what he asks for. He cites instances where his choices of dressing, hairdo and many others are stashed away by his father's. However, he vows that the two things that will be of his choice would be, his career and the woman he would marry.\n\nPost-[[Motion picture credits|credits]], Satya ([[Subhasis Mukherjee]]), the Arvind dutiful household's servant wakes up Sidhu in the morning. In the background, we see Siddhu's mother, Lakshmi ([[Laboni Sarkar]]) singing a [[devotional song]] while cooking. At the dining table, Arvind, [[Managing Director]] of their construction company, inquires if Siddhu will join their office for managing their business. When Sidhu deliberates, his father doesn't stand any longer and instead plans for his [[marriage]] despite Sidhu's silent protest. The next week, he returns home to realize that he is going to get [[engagement|engaged]] to Manasi against his wishes. He speaks with her only to realize that she is a \"daddy's girl\" and she not being to his liking. However, with Arvind's final say, they eventually get engaged.\n\nWhile contemplating on his options in a temple, Sidhu accidentally meets Priya ([[Srabanti Malakar]]), an [[engineering]] student. Seeing her chirpy nature and vibrance, Sidhu begins to like her. He makes attempts to know her by meeting her on a regular basis. In the process, he starts liking her cherubic and ever-friendly nature and as someone who does what she loves. As days go by, he realizes about so many small things in her company that gave him happiness. He realizes that he has fallen in love with her.\n\nAlongside this, Sidhu applies for a bank loan to start out on his dream of building his career. When his love for Priya deepens, he wishes to propose to her. He confesses to her that he is engaged to marry Manasi against his wishes, but what he really wants is her. On knowing of him being engaged, Priya gets dejected, but comes back a day later and asks him to do what he wishes for and accepts his proposal. At this juncture, the ecstatic Sidhu is seen by a furious Arvind. Siddhu is admonished back home and he expresses his disinterest in marriage with Manasi. When asked for his reason to like Priya, Sidhu replies saying that if Priya can stay with their family for a week, then all their questions shall be answered. He convinces Priya to stay at his house after lying to her father, Kanaka Rao ([[Sushanta Dutta]]) that she is going on a college tour.\n\nWhen Priya is introduced to Sidhu's family, she gets a lukewarm welcome. As she settles down in the house, one after the other begins to like her. Even though getting used to the living habits of the authoritarian Arvind's household was difficult, Priya stayed put for Sidhu's sake. In the meanwhile, Arvind reprimands Sidhu when he knows of his bank loan and his plans, only to further enrage Sidhu. One day the entire family along with Priya attends a marriage ceremony. A cheerful Priya cheers up the ceremony with her playful nature. Coincidentally, Kanaka Rao who happens to be around, recognizes Sidhu as the drunken young man whom he encountered on an earlier occasion. Priya realizes her father's presence and quickly exits to avoid his attention. After saving their grace, Sidhu admonishes Priya for her antics at the marriage. A sad and angry Priya moves out of the house saying that she does not find Sidhu the same and that she cannot put on an act if she stays in their house. After getting back to her house, she rebuilds the trust her father has in her while Sidhu is left forlorn. Lakshmi confronts Arvind on Sidhu's choices and wants. In the process, Sidhu opens up his heart and leaving Arvind to repent on his foolishness. Sidhu requests Manasi and her parents to call off the impending marriage. While they relent, Arvind manages to convince Kanaka babu about Sidhu and Priya's marriage. In return, Kanaka  wants to know more about Sidhu by having him live in house for a week. Arvind agrees with this and as the story returns to the pre-credits scene, the viewers are left to assume about the happy marriage of the protagonists.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hiran Chatterjee|Hiran]] - Sidhu\n* [[Srabanti Malakar]] - Priya\n* [[Sabyasachi Chakrabarty]] - Aravind (Sidhu's father)\n* Sushanta Dutta&nbsp;\u2014 Kanaka Rao (Priya's father)\n* [[Laboni Sarkar]]&nbsp;\u2014 Lakshmi (Sidhu's mother)\n* [[Locket Chatterjee]]&nbsp;\u2014 Sidhu's sister-in-law\n* [[Subhasish Mukherjee]]&nbsp;\u2014 Satya (servant)\n* [[Kamalika Banerjee]]\n* [[Pritam Saha]] - Monti (Sidhu's nephew)\n\n==Crew==\n* Producer:Ashoke Kumar Dhanuka\n* Director:Rabi Kinagi\n* Story: Bhaskar\n* Production Design:\n* Dialogue:\n* 'Lyrics:  [[Goutam Susmit]]\n* Editing:\n* Cinematography:\n* '''Music Director''': [[S.
