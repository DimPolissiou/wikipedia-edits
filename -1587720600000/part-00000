Three spin-off games have also been released: ''[[Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer]]'' for [[Nintendo 3DS]], ''[[Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival]]'' for [[Wii U]], and ''[[Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp]]'' for mobile devices.\n\n== Common elements ==\n\n=== Characters ===\n{{main|Characters in the Animal Crossing series}}\nWhile the series features various villagers for each title, certain prominent characters return in each series installment. [[Tom Nook]] is a [[Japanese raccoon dog|tanuki]] character who functions as both a shop owner and real estate broker, giving the player a loan for their house and allowing them to pay it back with no interest. He is one of the only residents of the town to follow a [[Capitalism|capitalist]] ethos. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/tom-nook-needs-to-get-with-the-times-1829149177|title=Tom Nook Needs To Get With The Times|last=Jackson|first=Gita|website=Kotaku|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref> [[Mr. Resetti]] is a mole character who appears from underground whenever players shut off the game without saving, berating them for circumventing one of the game's systems. Due to a new [[autosave]] function, he was \"laid off\" from his job in ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'', although he has gotten a new job as the Rescue Service operator. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/17/animal-crossing-new-horizons-autosave-resettis-job/|title=Animal Crossing New Horizons has autosave, so Resetti's out of a job|date=2019-06-17|website=VG247|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref>\n\n[[K.K.

This was seen by some fans as tacit support for [[music piracy]], although Nintendo denied that it was intended as [[social commentary]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/19/technology/social-commentary-or-just-a-dogs-opinion.html|title=Social Commentary, or Just a Dog's Opinion?|last=Jr|first=Tom Zeller|date=2005-12-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===Gameplay===\nIn the ''Animal Crossing'' games, the player assumes the role of a human child, aged between 9-13, who moves into a rural village populated with anthropomorphic animals and lives there indefinitely. Gameplay is [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]]: players have no defined objectives, but are instead encouraged to spend their time in the village performing any number of activities, which include collecting items, planting plants or other items, and socializing with the village's residents. ''Animal Crossing'' games are played in [[Real time (media)|real time]], utilizing the [[video game console]]'s internal clock and calendar. Thus, passage of time in the game world reflects that in reality, as well as the current season and time of day. Some in-game events, such as holidays or the growth of a tree, occur at certain times or require some duration of time to have passed.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\"/>\n\nOne notable feature of the ''Animal Crossing'' series is the high level of customization available, some of which affects the outcome of the game.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\" /> The [[player character]] is both named and gendered by the real life player at the start of the game, and their appearance can be modified by buying or designing custom clothes and accessories or changing the hairstyle (introduced in ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World|Wild World]]''). The player's house can also be furnished, decorated, and later expanded: the player can purchase and collect furniture and place it anywhere in the house, as well as change both the wallpaper and floor designs. While its terrain, building locations, and initial residents are randomly generated when the game is first begun (except in ''Animal Crossing: New Leaf'', in which the player decides between four given towns, and ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'', in which the player similarly decides between four given islands), the village's name and anthem, as well as some of the residents' catchphrases, are also determined by the player.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\"/>\n\nCollecting items is a major facet of ''Animal Crossing'': the player can explore the village and gather objects, including fruit from trees, seashells, and discarded items. Nearly all objects can be sold for Bells, the in-game currency. Players collect objects to obtain more Bells, which can then be used to buy furniture and clothing, purchase home expansions, invest in stocks, and play games. A number of specialized tools are available for other activities such as fishing and insect collecting. Special items, such as fossils and paintings, may be donated to the village museum. The player can choose to socialize with the other animal residents by engaging in conversation, sending and receiving letters, bartering, or playing hide-and-seek. Residents may move in or out of the village depending on the player's actions.\n\nAll installments of ''Animal Crossing'' allow some form of communication between players, both offline and [[Online game|online]]. A single village can house up to four human players, though only one can be exploring the village at any given time.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\">{{cite web| title=Animal Crossing Preview |last=Schneider |first=Peer |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/30/animal-crossing |date=May 30, 2002 |publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> The players can interact via written messages through the village post office or bulletin board.

[[Tom Nook]] is a [[Japanese raccoon dog|tanuki]] character who functions as both a shop owner and real estate broker, giving the player a loan for their house and allowing them to pay it back with no interest. He is one of the only residents of the town to follow a [[Capitalism|capitalist]] ethos. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/tom-nook-needs-to-get-with-the-times-1829149177|title=Tom Nook Needs To Get With The Times|last=Jackson|first=Gita|website=Kotaku|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref> [[Mr. Resetti]] is a mole character who appears from underground whenever players shut off the game without saving, berating them for circumventing one of the game's systems.

Gameplay is [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]]: players have no defined objectives, but are instead encouraged to spend their time in the village performing any number of activities, which include collecting items, planting plants or other items, and socializing with the village's residents. ''Animal Crossing'' games are played in [[Real time (media)|real time]], utilizing the [[video game console]]'s internal clock and calendar. Thus, passage of time in the game world reflects that in reality, as well as the current season and time of day. Some in-game events, such as holidays or the growth of a tree, occur at certain times or require some duration of time to have passed.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\"/>\n\nOne notable feature of the ''Animal Crossing'' series is the high level of customization available, some of which affects the outcome of the game.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\" /> The [[player character]] is both named and gendered by the real life player at the start of the game, and their appearance can be modified by buying or designing custom clothes and accessories or changing the hairstyle (introduced in ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World|Wild World]]''). The player's house can also be furnished, decorated, and later expanded: the player can purchase and collect furniture and place it anywhere in the house, as well as change both the wallpaper and floor designs. While its terrain, building locations, and initial residents are randomly generated when the game is first begun (except in ''Animal Crossing: New Leaf'', in which the player decides between four given towns, and ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'', in which the player similarly decides between four given islands), the village's name and anthem, as well as some of the residents' catchphrases, are also determined by the player.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\"/>\n\nCollecting items is a major facet of ''Animal Crossing'': the player can explore the village and gather objects, including fruit from trees, seashells, and discarded items. Nearly all objects can be sold for Bells, the in-game currency. Players collect objects to obtain more Bells, which can then be used to buy furniture and clothing, purchase home expansions, invest in stocks, and play games. A number of specialized tools are available for other activities such as fishing and insect collecting. Special items, such as fossils and paintings, may be donated to the village museum. The player can choose to socialize with the other animal residents by engaging in conversation, sending and receiving letters, bartering, or playing hide-and-seek. Residents may move in or out of the village depending on the player's actions.\n\nAll installments of ''Animal Crossing'' allow some form of communication between players, both offline and [[Online game|online]]. A single village can house up to four human players, though only one can be exploring the village at any given time.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\">{{cite web| title=Animal Crossing Preview |last=Schneider |first=Peer |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/30/animal-crossing |date=May 30, 2002 |publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> The players can interact via written messages through the village post office or bulletin board.

While some consider Talise to be its own language, others use it as a blanket term to group the closely related dialects of Poleo, Koo, Malagheti, Moli, and Tolo. It is a branch of the Proto-Guadalcanal family, which forms part of the Southeast Solomons language group. \n\n==Dialects==\nEven though Talise is a language on its own, it is also widely considered as a way to group other similar dialects such as Tolo, Moli, and Koo. The sound correspondences among these are very close. Many words like ''aso'' 'sun' and ''vula'' 'moon' are identical across all of the dialects. However, many other languages and dialects in Guadalcanal also share the same phonemes and words.<ref name=\"AA\" />\n\n== Phonology ==\n\n=== Consonants ===\nThe Tolo language has thirteen consonants. Most letters are pronounced as they are in English, with a few notable exceptions. The letter ''v'' may be pronounced as the voiced fricative [v] (as in English ''vote''), but it is also pronounced as the glide [w] (as in English ''win'') in certain cases. The digraph ''ts'' is nearly always pronounced like the ''ch'' in ''church'', except when used in the word ''katsa'' 'bark skirt', where it is pronounced as [ts] (as in English ''cats'').<ref name=\"AA\">{{Cite book |title=Tolo Dictionary |last=Crowley |first=Susan |publisher=Dept. of Linguistics, Research School of Pacific Studies, Australian National University |year=1986 |isbn=0858833468 |series=Pscific Linguistics Series C - No. 91 |location=Canberra |doi=10.15144/PL-C91 |hdl=1885/145398 |ref=harv |doi-access=free |hdl-access=free |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/tolodictionary0000crow }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Consonant Phonemes\n!\n!Labial\n!Alveolar\n!Velar\n!Glottal\n|-\n!Plosive\n|p, b\n|t, d\n|k, g\n|\n|-\n!Nasal\n|m\n|n, l\n|\n|\n|-\n!Tap/Flap\n|\n|r\n|\n|\n|-\n!Fricative\n|v\n|s \n|\n|h\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Vowels ===\nTolo has five short vowels, namely ''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u''. The letter ''e'' can either be pronounced as in \"'''e'''ver\" or as in \"sh'''a'''ke\", and the letter ''i'' can either be pronounced as in \"tr'''ee'''\" or as in \"s'''i'''t\".<ref name=\"AA\" />\n\n===Diphthongs===\nThere are eight diphthongs in the Tolo language. These are presented in the table below. <ref name=\"AA\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Ending with /e/ !! Ending with /i/ !! Ending with /u/ !! Ending with /o/\n|-\n| ae || ai || ou || ao\n|-\n| oe || oi || au ||\n|-\n|  || ei || ||\n|}\n\n===Prenasalisation===\nThe nasal sounds [m], [n] and [ng] are no separate phonemes, but always occur before the phonemes /b/, /d/ and /g/ respectively. Therefore, they are to be understood as part of those latter sounds. However, the extent to which someone hears this prenasalisation depends entirely on the speaker, as some stress it more if /b/,/d/ or /g/ come at the middle of a word instead of at the beginning.<ref name=\"AA\" />\n\n===Stress===\nStress in Tolo is almost always put on the second to last syllable, regardless of how many syllables are present in a word. Some of the rare exceptions are the pronouns ''hamitou'' and ''hamutou'', in which the stress is placed on the first syllable.<ref name=\"AA\" />\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Adjectives===\nAdjectives in Tolo almost always immediately follow the noun that they modify. The only exception to this rule is that numerals precede the noun. An example of this pattern is ''baka lava'' 'big child', where the adjective ''lava'' 'big' modifies the noun ''baka'' 'child'.<ref name=\"AA\" />\n\n===Possessive Adjectives===\nThe prefix/suffix 'na' is used to denote possession, depending on alienability, that is, if the modified noun is understood as an important part of the possessor or not. However, there is no specific rule that can be used to determine whether or not a noun is alienable or inablienable, so it is left up to each individual speaker. As an example, \"the way(road) of Jesus\" can be said as either \"salana lesu\" or \"nasala lesu\", with the affix 'na' acting as either the prefix or suffix.<ref name=\"AA\" />\n\n===Adverbs===\nAdverbs tend to come after the verb that they are modifying, but they come ''before'' the verb when they describe a direction. For example, in ''Hia e ba bongi'' 'He went yesterday', the time adverb ''bongi'' 'yesterday' modifies the verb ''ba'' 'went'. However, there are exceptions to both these rules. For example, to say come 'come quickly', one can say ''mai kesa'', using the adverb ''kesa'' after the verb ''mai'', but if one uses the alternative adverb ''savua'' to mean 'quickly, only the order ''savua mai'' is acceptable.<ref name=\"AA\" />\n\n===Prepositions===\nThe most common prepositions are ''i'' and ''na'', which can be interchanged in some cases. Some other common prepositions are ''hinia'', ''sania'', ''vania'', ''tavallia'', ''sana'', ''tania'', and ''ovea''. These prepositions can also change their endings as the object they are describing changes.<ref name=\"AA\" />\n\n=== Verbs ===\nTolo verbs are divided into transitive and intransitive classes. Transitive verbs are followed by an object and change their endings depending on the object. Intransitive verbs are not followed by any objects and do not change their endings.<ref name=\"AA\" />\n\n===Passive Voice===\nThere is no passive voice in Tolo. English passive voice can be implied by using ''kesana'' 'someone' or ''hira'' 'they' along with an active verb. For example, ''Hira belia na kaui Bobi'' can be translated to 'Bob's dog was stolen', but more literally means 'They stole Bob's dog.'<ref name=\"AA\" />\n\n===Future Tense===\nFuture tense is denoted by a pre-verbal particle. Future tense always has to indicated overtly, regardless of how far into the future the sentence talks about, whether it be a few minutes or a few months.<ref name=\"AA\" />\n\n===Plural Nouns===\nTolo marks plurality on the article, but not on the noun itself (as in English with the suffix ''-s''). For example, the plural of ''a daki'' 'the woman' is ''hira daki'' 'the women'.<ref name=\"AA\" />\n\n===Negative Questions===\nNegative questions are commonly answered according to the sense of the question being asked, not necessarily according to the answer. This is unlike English, where a question like 'Don't you want it?' can be answered either with 'Yes, I want it' or 'No, I don't want it'. In this case, an answer is given based on the idea the question is posing, not necessarily on the way it is worded. However, the same question in Tolo can be answered with ''Eo, nau taiha ngaloa'' which translates to 'Yes, I don't want it' or ''Taiha, nau ngaloa'', which is 'No, I want it'.<ref name=\"AA\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Languages of the Solomon Islands}}\n[[Category:Gela-Guadalcanal languages]]\n[[Category:Languages of the Solomon Islands]]\n\n{{au-lang-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Austronesian language sopken in the Solomon Islands}}\n{{Infobox language\n|name=Talise\n|altname=Tolo\n|states=[[Solomon Islands]]\n|region=[[Guadalcanal]]\n|speakers={{sigfig|12520|2}}\n|date=1999\n|ref=e18\n|familycolor=Austronesian\n|fam2=[[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] \n|fam3=[[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]]\n|fam4=[[Southeast Solomonic languages|Southeast Solomonic]]\n|fam5=[[Gela\u2013Guadalcanal languages|Gela\u2013Guadalcanal]]\n|fam6=[[Guadalcanal languages|Guadalcanal]]\n|iso3=tlr\n|glotto=tali1259\n|glottorefname=Talise\n}}\n\n'''Talise''' is a Southeast Solomonic language native to [[Guadalcanal]] with a speaker population of roughly 13,000.

The [[Snooker world rankings 2019/2020|rankings at the start of 2019/2020 season]] are determined by prize money earned in the [[Snooker world ranking points 2017/2018|2017/2018]] and [[Snooker world ranking points 2018/2019|2018/2019]] seasons and are updated after every tournament carrying ranking status; the players are re-ranked at the beginning of the current season after removing players relegated at the end of the previous season from the ranking list. As points are accrued from tournaments throughout the current season, the points from the corresponding tournaments from two seasons earlier are dropped. The rankings are used to set the official tournament seedings at various points throughout the season; even though the rankings are officially updated after every tournament carrying ranking status not all the rankings are used as seedings, and only the rankings officially used as seedings are documented below. The total points accumulated by the cut-off dates for the revised seedings are based on all the points up to that date in the 2019/2020 season, all of the points from the 2018/2019 season, and the points from the 2017/2018 season that have not yet been dropped. \n{{TOC right}}\n\n== Seeding revisions ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

points''' for the professional [[snooker]] players on the [[World Snooker Tour#Main Tour|World Snooker Main Tour]] in the [[Snooker season 2019/2020|2019/2020 season]] are based on performances in ranking [[List of snooker tournaments|tournaments]] over a two-year rolling period. The [[Snooker world rankings 2019/2020|rankings at the start of 2019/2020 season]] are determined by prize money earned in the [[Snooker world ranking points 2017/2018|2017/2018]] and [[Snooker world ranking points 2018/2019|2018/2019]] seasons and are updated after every tournament carrying ranking status; the players are re-ranked at the beginning of the current season after removing players relegated at the end of the previous season from the ranking list. As points are accrued from tournaments throughout the current season, the points from the corresponding tournaments from two seasons earlier are dropped. The rankings are used to set the official tournament seedings at various points throughout the season; even though the rankings are officially updated after every tournament carrying ranking status not all the rankings are used as seedings, and only the rankings officially used as seedings are documented below.
