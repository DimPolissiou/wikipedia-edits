{"title_page": "Histone methylation", "text_new": "{{short description|The modification of histones by addition of methyl groups.}}\n'''Histone methylation''' is a process by which methyl groups are transferred to [[amino acids]] of [[histone]] proteins that make up [[nucleosomes]], which the [[DNA]] double helix wraps around to form [[chromosomes]]. Methylation of histones can either increase or decrease transcription of genes, depending on which amino acids in the histones are methylated, and how many methyl groups are attached. Methylation events that weaken chemical attractions between histone tails and DNA increase transcription because they enable the DNA to uncoil from nucleosomes so that transcription factor proteins and RNA polymerase can access the DNA. This process is critical for the regulation of gene expression that allows different cells to express different genes.\n\n==Function==\nHistone methylation, as a mechanism for modifying [[chromatin]] structure is associated with stimulation of neural pathways known to be important for formation of [[long-term memories]] and learning.<ref name=\"Perry\">{{cite journal|last=Kramer|first=Jamie M.|title=Epigenetic regulation of memory: implications in human cognitive disorders|journal=Biomolecular Concepts|date=February 2013|volume=4|issue=1|pages=1\u201312|doi=10.1515/bmc-2012-0026}}<!--|accessdate=21 February 2013--></ref> Animal models have shown methylation and other epigenetic regulation mechanisms to be associated with conditions of aging, [[neurodegenerative diseases]], and intellectual disability<ref name=\"Perry\" /> (Rubinstein\u2013Taybi Syndrome, X-linked mental retardation).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lilja|first=Tobias|author2=Nina Heldring |author3=Ola Hermanson |title=Like a rolling histone: Epigenetic regulation of neural stem cells and brain development by factors controlling histone acetylation and methylation|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects|date=February 2013|volume=1830|issue=2|pages=2354\u20132360|doi=10.1016/j.bbagen.2012.08.011}}<!--|accessdate=21 February 2013--></ref>\nThis modification alters the properties of the [[nucleosome]] and affects its interactions with other proteins, particularly in regards to gene transcription processes.  \n* Histone methylation can be associated with either transcriptional [[Repressor|repression]] or [[Operon|activation]]. For example, trimethylation of [[histone H3]] at [[lysine]] 4 ([[H3K4me3]]) is an active mark for transcription and is upregulated in hippocampus one hour after contextual [[fear conditioning]] in rats. However, dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 ([[H3K9me2]]), a signal for transcriptional silencing, is increased after exposure to either the fear conditioning or a novel environment alone.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Swati|author2=Se Y.

If areas around oncogenes become unmethylated these cancer-causing genes have the potential to be transcribed at an alarming rate. Opposite of this is the methylation of tumor suppressor genes.

Methylation of histones can either increase or decrease transcription of genes, depending on which amino acids in the histones are methylated, and how many methyl groups are attached. Methylation events that weaken chemical attractions between histone tails and DNA increase transcription because they enable the DNA to uncoil from nucleosomes so that transcription factor proteins and RNA polymerase can access the DNA.

[[Epigenetic]] alterations are reversible meaning that they can be targets for therapy.\n\nThe activities of histone methyltransferases are offset by the activity of histone demethylases. This allows for the switching on or off of transcription by reversing pre-existing modifications. It is necessary for the activities of both histone methyltrasnsferases and histone demethylases to be regulated tightly. Misregulation of either can lead to gene expression that leads to increased susceptibility to disease.

Mutations that occur to increase and decrease methylation have great changes on gene regulation, while mutations to enzymes such as [[methyltransferase]] and demethyltransferase can completely alter which proteins are transcribed in a given cell. Over methylation of a chromosome can cause certain genes that are necessary for normal cell function, to become inactivated. In a certain yeast strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a mutation that causes three lysine residues on the third histone, H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79, to become methylated causes a delay in the mitotic cell cycle, as many genes required for this progression are inactivated. This extreme mutation leads to the death of the organism. It has been discovered that the deletion of genes that will eventually allow for the production of histone methyltransferase allows this organism to live as its lysine residues are not methylated.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jin | first1 = Y. | last2 = Rodriguez | first2 = A.

Cancer can be caused in a variety of ways due to differential methylation of histones. Since the discovery of [[oncogenes]] as well as [[tumor suppressor genes]] it has been known that a large factor of causing and repressing cancer is within our own genome. If areas around oncogenes become unmethylated these cancer-causing genes have the potential to be transcribed at an alarming rate. Opposite of this is the methylation of tumor suppressor genes. In cases where the areas around these genes were highly methylated, the tumor suppressor gene was not active and therefore cancer was more likely to occur.

The screenplay was adapted (in collaboration with [[David Zelag Goodman]]) from a [[Screenplay#Spec scripts|spec script]] titled ''Eyes,'' written by [[John Carpenter]]; it was Carpenter's first major studio film. [[H. B. Gilmour]] later wrote a novelization.\n\nProducer [[Jon Peters]], who was dating [[Barbra Streisand]] at the time, bought the screenplay as a starring vehicle for her, but Streisand eventually decided not to take the role because of \"the kinky nature of the story\", as Peters later explained. As a result, the role went to Dunaway, who had just won an Oscar for her performance in ''[[Network (1976 film)|Network]].'' Streisand nevertheless felt that \"Prisoner\", the [[torch song]] from the film, would be a good [[power ballad]] vehicle for her. She sang it on the soundtrack and garnered a moderate hit as a result (the record peaked at number 21 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]).\n\n''Eyes of Laura Mars'' is said to be an example of an American version of the Italian [[giallo]] genre. The film is also noted for its use of [[red herring]]s and its [[twist ending]].\n\n==Plot==\nLaura Mars ([[Faye Dunaway]]) is a glamorous fashion photographer who specializes in stylized violence (based upon the work of [[Helmut Newton]], who provided some of the photos used for the film while others were shot by Rebecca Blake). In the middle of controversy over whether her photographs glorify violence and are demeaning to women, Laura begins seeing, in first person through the eyes of the killer, real-time visions of the murders of her friends and colleagues.\n\nJohn Neville ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]), the lieutenant in charge of the case, shows Laura unpublished police photographs of unsolved murders that very closely mirror Laura's fashion shoots. Laura's visions continue, including visions of the killer stalking her and continuing to murder those around her. Meanwhile, Laura and Neville fall in love. The murders continue as Laura's various colleagues, acquaintances and past romantic interests come in and out of focus as potential suspects or victims, until a final confrontation between Laura and the killer occurs.\n\nAt her apartment, Laura is affected by one last vision of the killer, who has now come for her. The killer attempts to break in through her front door, but Laura deadbolts it before he/she can enter. Upon hearing her distress, Neville (who had been on his way to meet her) breaks through her balcony window. He proceeds to tell Laura they have caught the killer, a troubled colleague of hers named Tommy, and begins an elaborate explanation of Tommy's motivations and back story. Knowing Tommy well, Laura recognizes this as a lie. Neville, still talking about the killer, uses \"I.\"  Laura realizes that Neville is talking about himself and that Neville himself is the killer. As Neville details more of his own story, it is implied that he may have [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]]. Because of this, and his love for her, he cannot bring himself to murder her and instead asks that she end his life. He takes her hand, pointing the gun at him as she begs him not to and kills him, calling the police as the camera view closes in on her eyes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Laura Mars\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Lieutenant John Neville\n* [[Brad Dourif]] as Tommy Ludlow\n* [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] as Donald Phelps\n* [[Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1]] as Michael Reisler\n* [[Frank Adonis]] as Sal Volpe\n* Lisa Taylor as Michelle\n* [[Darlanne Fluegel]] as Lulu\n* [[Rose Gregorio]] as Elaine Cassel\n* [[Bill Boggs]] as Himself\n* Steve Marachuk as Robert\n* [[Meg Mundy]] as Doris Spenser\n* Marilyn Meyers as Sheila Weissman\n* [[John Sahag]] as Hairdresser\n\n==Production==\nThe film's source story was written by [[John Carpenter]], as was the earliest version of the screenplay. Producer [[Jack H. Harris]] had worked with Carpenter on the latter's feature-film directorial debut, ''Dark Star,'' and it was Harris who optioned Carpenter's eleven-page treatment, then titled simply ''Eyes.''\n\nHarris planned to make the film independently of the major studios with privately raised finance and [[Roberta Collins]] in the lead. But Harris's friend [[Jon Peters]] read the treatment, and upon reading it, he became enthusiastic about its potential as a vehicle for Peters's then-girlfriend [[Barbra Streisand]]. Peters got interest from [[Peter Guber]] at Columbia and they agreed to finance the project's development. Streisand pulled out of the film, but Columbia were sufficiently enthusiastic about the script to move forward with another actress and [[Faye Dunaway]] was cast. However, as a condition of this, the studio insisted on the script being rewritten; [[David Zelag Goodman]] shouldered that burden.<ref name=\"jack\">Jack H Harris, ''FATHER OF THE BLOB: The Making Of A Monster Smash & Other Hollywood Tales'' 2015</ref>\n\n\"It wasn't a pleasant experience\", said Carpenter. \"The original script was very good, I thought. But it got shat upon.\"<ref name=\"film\">Trick and Treat\nMcCarthy, Todd. Film Comment; New York Vol. 16, Iss. 1,  (Jan/Feb 1980): 17-24.</ref>\n\nProduction began on October 17, 1977. The film was shot entirely in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]]. A memorable sequence where the Laura Mars character photographs a group of models against a backdrop of two burning cars was filmed over four days at New York's [[Columbus Circle]]. The $7 million production wrapped on January 9, 1978, after 56 days of filming. It was reported that Peters and Dunaway had a tense relationship while making the film.\n\n==Reception==\nOn its release, the film received mixed critical reviews, but it was a box office hit, earning $20 million from a $7 million budget.\n\nThe movie received a broadly positive review in ''The New York Times,'' in which [[Janet Maslin]] called the ending of the film \"dumb\", but otherwise liked it. She wrote of it: \"It's the cleverness of ''Eyes of Laura Mars'' that counts, cleverness that manifests itself in superlative casting, drily controlled direction from Irvin Kershner, and spectacular settings that turn New York into the kind of eerie, lavish dreamland that could exist only in the idle noodlings of the very, very hip.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B02E5DC1F3EE432A25757C0A96E9C946990D6CF \"Screen: 'Eyes of Laura Mars':In The Netherworld\"], Janet Maslin, ''The New York Times'', August 4, 1978</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] was less enthusiastic, and pointed out what he called the film's clich\u00e9d \"woman in trouble\" plot.<ref>{{cite web|last=Emerson |first=Jim |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19780101/REVIEWS/801010302/1023 |title=Ebert's review |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=1978-01-01 |accessdate=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nAs of February 2020, the film has an approval rating of 48% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 5.12/10.

The screenplay was adapted (in collaboration with [[David Zelag Goodman]]) from a [[Screenplay#Spec scripts|spec script]] titled ''Eyes,'' written by [[John Carpenter]]; it was Carpenter's first major studio film. [[H. B. Gilmour]] later wrote a novelization.\n\nProducer [[Jon Peters]], who was dating [[Barbra Streisand]] at the time, bought the screenplay as a starring vehicle for her, but Streisand eventually decided not to take the role because of \"the kinky nature of the story\", as Peters later explained. As a result, the role went to Dunaway, who had just won an Oscar for her performance in ''[[Network (1976 film)|Network]].'' Streisand nevertheless felt that \"Prisoner\", the [[torch song]] from the film, would be a good [[power ballad]] vehicle for her. She sang it on the soundtrack and garnered a moderate hit as a result (the record peaked at number 21 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]).\n\n''Eyes of Laura Mars'' is said to be an example of an American version of the Italian [[giallo]] genre. The film is also noted for its use of [[red herring]]s and its [[twist ending]].\n\n==Plot==\nLaura Mars ([[Faye Dunaway]]) is a glamorous fashion photographer who specializes in stylized violence (based upon the work of [[Helmut Newton]], who provided some of the photos used for the film while others were shot by Rebecca Blake). In the middle of controversy over whether her photographs glorify violence and are demeaning to women, Laura begins seeing, in first person through the eyes of the killer, real-time visions of the murders of her friends and colleagues.\n\nJohn Neville ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]), the lieutenant in charge of the case, shows Laura unpublished police photographs of unsolved murders that very closely mirror Laura's fashion shoots. Laura's visions continue, including visions of the killer stalking her and continuing to murder those around her. Meanwhile, Laura and Neville fall in love. The murders continue as Laura's various colleagues, acquaintances and past romantic interests come in and out of focus as potential suspects or victims, until a final confrontation between Laura and the killer occurs.\n\nAt her apartment, Laura is affected by one last vision of the killer, who has now come for her. The killer attempts to break in through her front door, but Laura deadbolts it before he/she can enter. Upon hearing her distress, Neville (who had been on his way to meet her) breaks through her balcony window. He proceeds to tell Laura they have caught the killer, a troubled colleague of hers named Tommy, and begins an elaborate explanation of Tommy's motivations and back story. Knowing Tommy well, Laura recognizes this as a lie. Neville, still talking about the killer, uses \"I.\"  Laura realizes that Neville is talking about himself and that Neville himself is the killer. As Neville details more of his own story, it is implied that he may have [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]]. Because of this, and his love for her, he cannot bring himself to murder her and instead asks that she end his life. He takes her hand, pointing the gun at him as she begs him not to and kills him, calling the police as the camera view closes in on her eyes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Laura Mars\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Lieutenant John Neville\n* [[Brad Dourif]] as Tommy Ludlow\n* [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] as Donald Phelps\n* [[Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1]] as Michael Reisler\n* [[Frank Adonis]] as Sal Volpe\n* Lisa Taylor as Michelle\n* [[Darlanne Fluegel]] as Lulu\n* [[Rose Gregorio]] as Elaine Cassel\n* [[Bill Boggs]] as Himself\n* Steve Marachuk as Robert\n* [[Meg Mundy]] as Doris Spenser\n* Marilyn Meyers as Sheila Weissman\n* [[John Sahag]] as Hairdresser\n\n==Production==\nThe film's source story was written by [[John Carpenter]], as was the earliest version of the screenplay. Producer [[Jack H. Harris]] had worked with Carpenter on the latter's feature-film directorial debut, ''Dark Star,'' and it was Harris who optioned Carpenter's eleven-page treatment, then titled simply ''Eyes.'' \n\nHarris planned to make the film independently of the major studios with privately raised finance and [[Roberta Collins]] in the lead. But Harris's friend [[Jon Peters]] read the treatment, and upon reading it, he became enthusiastic about its potential as a vehicle for Peters's then-girlfriend [[Barbra Streisand]]. Peters got interest from [[Peter Guber]] at Columbia and they agreed to finance the project's development. Streisand pulled out of the film, but Columbia were sufficiently enthusiastic about the script to move forward with another actress and [[Faye Dunaway]] was cast. However, as a condition of this, the studio insisted on the script being rewritten; [[David Zelag Goodman]] shouldered that burden.<ref name=\"jack\">Jack H Harris, ''FATHER OF THE BLOB: The Making Of A Monster Smash & Other Hollywood Tales'' 2015</ref>\n\n\"It wasn't a pleasant experience\", said Carpenter. \"The original script was very good, I thought. But it got shat upon.\"<ref name=\"film\">Trick and Treat\nMcCarthy, Todd. Film Comment; New York Vol. 16, Iss. 1,  (Jan/Feb 1980): 17-24. </ref>\n\nProduction began on October 17, 1977. The film was shot entirely in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]]. A memorable sequence where the Laura Mars character photographs a group of models against a backdrop of two burning cars was filmed over four days at New York's [[Columbus Circle]]. The $7 million production wrapped on January 9, 1978, after 56 days of filming. It was reported that Peters and Dunaway had a tense relationship while making the film.\n\n==Reception==\nOn its release, the film received mixed critical reviews, but it was a box office hit, earning $20 million from a $7 million budget.\n\nThe movie received a broadly positive review in ''The New York Times,'' in which [[Janet Maslin]] called the ending of the film \"dumb\", but otherwise liked it. She wrote of it: \"It's the cleverness of ''Eyes of Laura Mars'' that counts, cleverness that manifests itself in superlative casting, drily controlled direction from Irvin Kershner, and spectacular settings that turn New York into the kind of eerie, lavish dreamland that could exist only in the idle noodlings of the very, very hip.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B02E5DC1F3EE432A25757C0A96E9C946990D6CF \"Screen: 'Eyes of Laura Mars':In The Netherworld\"], Janet Maslin, ''The New York Times'', August 4, 1978</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] was less enthusiastic, and pointed out what he called the film's clich\u00e9d \"woman in trouble\" plot.<ref>{{cite web|last=Emerson |first=Jim |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19780101/REVIEWS/801010302/1023 |title=Ebert's review |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=1978-01-01 |accessdate=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nAs of February 2020, the film has an approval rating of 48% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 5.12/10.

Many of the policies advanced in the manifesto, such as centralization, abolition of the senate, formation of national councils loyal to the state, expanded military power, and support for militias ([[Blackshirts]], for example) were adopted by Mussolini's regime, while other calls such as [[universal suffrage]] and a peaceful foreign policy<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://webspace.tiscali.it/|title=Tiscali Webspace|website=webspace.tiscali.it}}</ref> were abandoned. De Ambris later became a prominent [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]]. In 1932, \"[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]\", an essay by Mussolini and [[Giovanni Gentile]], provided an outline of fascism that better represented Mussolini's regime.\n\n==Regimes and parties==\nSome scholars assert that the term \"fascism\" should only be used to mean the ideology of the National Fascist Party under [[Benito Mussolini]] in Italy, which ruled from 1922 to 1943. However, other European regimes that showed strong similarities to Mussolini's governing are also popularly described as fascist. European regimes often described as fascist or being strongly influenced by fascism include:<ref name=\"Cyprian Blamires 2006\">For coverage of each one see Cyprian Blamires, ed., ''World fascism: a historical encyclopedia'' (Abc-Clio, 2006).</ref>\n* The [[National Fascist Party]]/[[Republican Fascist Party]] in [[Fascist Italy (1922-1943)|Italy]] and the [[Italian Social Republic]] under [[Benito Mussolini]] (1922\u20131945)\n* The [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] under [[Adolf Hitler]] (1933\u20131945) (Based around the ideology of [[National Socialism]], which was heavily influenced by fascism)\n* The [[National Union (Portugal)|National Union]] in [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]] under [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] and [[Marcelo Caetano]] (1933\u20131974) Salazar always rejected the label of fascist criticizing the \"exaltation of youth, the cult of force through direct action, the principle of the superiority of state political power in social life, [and] the propensity for organising masses behind a single leader\" as fundamental differences between fascism and the Catholic corporatism of the Estado Novo, however his regime adopted many fascist characteristics with the [[Legi\u00e3o Portuguesa (Estado Novo)|Legi\u00e3o Portuguesa]] and [[Mocidade Portuguesa]] being the most prominent examples, however these institutions were a little more than window dressing and had no political influence; after the end of the Spanish Civil War Salazar distanced his regime from fascism due to its pro-British orientation<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Vm5by1Najj4C&pg=PA143&lpg=PA143&dq=salazar+mussolini+influence&source=bl&ots=Vh3_mjwAGd&sig=ACfU3U14xB_nTM8w3cFyVJYFMs_aSFlsGw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5PHqt9rhAhXRJVAKHamNAKEQ6AEwC3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=salazar+mussolini+influence&f=false|title=Latin Fascist Elites: The Mussolini, Franco, and Salazar Regimes: The Mussolini, Franco, and Salazar Regimes|first=Paul H.|last=Lewis|date=December 30, 2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Blamires |first1=Cyprian |last2=Lloyd-Jones |first2=Stewart |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1576079409 |page=528}}</ref>\n* The [[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Fatherland Front]] in [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] under [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] and [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] (1934\u20131938) (Based around the ideology of [[Austrofascism]], which was heavily infleunced by [[Italian fascism]]) \n* The [[Yugoslav Radical Union]] in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] under [[Milan Stojadinovi\u0107]] (1935\u20131939) (Stojadinovi\u0107's regime lacked the fascist characteristics of being a mass movement and totalitarian; however, his regime was heavily inspired by fascism)<ref>{{cite book|last=Payne|first=Stanley G.|title=A History of Fascism, 1914\u20131945|year=1996|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0299148742|ref=Payne_1996|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780299148744}}</ref> \n* The [[4th of August Regime]] in [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] under [[Ioannis Metaxas]] (1936\u20131941) (The Metaxist regime was not fully fascist however adopted many fascist characteristics with the [[National Youth Organisation (Greece)|EON]] being an example of this.

However all regimes listed presented fascist influence through authoritarianism, use of organised paramilitaries/youth movements loyal to the state, propaganda and rhetoric that opposed [[liberalism]], [[individualism]], [[democracy]], [[communism]], etc, and built their economies around [[fascist corporatism|corporatism]]. These are all elements of governing popularised by Mussolini. The use of the Roman Salute and coloured shirt uniforms used by most of these regimes also shows how the aesthetics established by the National Fascist Party became adopted throughout Europe.\n\nThere were multiple regimes in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] that were influenced by fascism. These include the [[National Christian Party]] under [[Octavian Goga]] (1938), [[National Renaissance Front|Party of the Nation]] under [[Ion Gigurtu]] (1940) and the [[National Legionary State]] which was led by the [[Iron Guard]] under [[Horia Sima]] in conjunction with the Romanian military dictatorship under [[Ion Antonescu]] (1940-1941). The first two of these regimes were not completely fascist however used fascism to appeal to the growing far-right sympathies amongst the populace.<ref name = \"Report 51\">''Final Report'', p. 51.</ref>\n\nPrior to and during the Second World War, Nazi Germany imposed numerous fascist/fascist related regimes across occupied Europe, these may not fully espouse the form of fascism established by Mussolini however they were authoritarian, nationalist, anti-communist and staunchly pro-[[Axis powers]]:<ref name=\"Cyprian Blamires 2006\"/>\n* The [[National Partnership]] in the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Czech Republic]] under [[Emil H\u00e1cha]] (1939\u20131945)\n* The [[Slovak People's Party]] in [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovakia]] under [[Jozef Tiso]] (1939\u20131945)\n* The [[R\u00e9volution nationale|Vichy Regime]] supported by collaborationist parties ([[Marcel Bucard|Marcel Bucard's]] [[Mouvement Franciste]], [[Jacques Doriot|Jacques Doriot's]] [[French Popular Party]], [[Marcel D\u00e9at|Marcel D\u00e9at's]] [[National Popular Rally]]) and [[Joseph Darnand|Joseph Darnand's]] [[Milice]] in [[Vichy France|France]] under [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] and [[Pierre Laval]] (1940\u20131944)\n* The [[Usta\u0161e]] in [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] under [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] (1941\u20131945)\n* The Collaborationist government supported by Georgios Kosmidis's [[National Union of Greece]] in [[Hellenic State (1941\u20131944)|Greece]] under [[Georgios Tsolakoglou]], [[Konstantinos Logothetopoulos]] and [[Ioannis Rallis]] (1941\u20131944)\n* The [[Serbian State Guard|Collaborationist Serbian military]] supported by [[Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107|Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107's]] [[Yugoslav National Movement]] in [[Government of National Salvation|Serbia]] under [[Milan Nedi\u0107]] (1941\u20131944)\n* The [[Nasjonal Samling]] in [[Quisling regime|Norway]] under [[Vidkun Quisling]] (1942\u20131945)\n* The [[Arrow Cross Party]] in [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Hungary]] under [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]] (1944\u20131945)\n* [[Konrad Henlein|Konrad Henlein's]] [[Sudeten German Party]], [[Anton Mussert|Anton Mussert's]] [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands|NSB]], [[L\u00e9on Degrelle|L\u00e9on Degrelle's]] [[Rexist Party]] and [[Staf De Clercq|Staf De Clercq's]] [[Vlaams Nationaal Verbond|VNV]] were also given significant power in occupied Europe.\n\nThere were also a number of political movements active in Europe that were influenced in part by some features of Mussolini's regime. These include: [[Le Faisceau]], [[British Fascists]], [[British Union of Fascists]], [[Imperial Fascist League]], [[Blueshirts]], [[French National-Collectivist Party]], [[Breton National Party]], [[Falange Espa\u00f1ola de las JONS|Falange Espa\u00f1ola]], [[Black Front]], [[National Syndicalists (Portugal)|National Syndicalist Movement]], [[Verdinaso]], [[National Front (Switzerland)|Nationale Front]], [[Greek National Socialist Party]], [[Vlajka]], [[National Fascist Community]], [[National Radical Camp#Falanga|ONR-Falanga]], [[Patriotic People's Movement (Finland)|Patriotic People's Movement]], [[P\u0113rkonkrusts]], [[Union of Bulgarian National Legions]], [[Ratniks]] and the [[Russian Fascist Party]] (based in Manchuria).<ref name=\"Cyprian Blamires 2006\"/>\n\nProminent figures associated with European fascism outside of the Axis include [[Oswald Mosley]], [[Rotha Lintorn-Orman]], [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]], [[Joris Van Severen]], [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], [[Francisco Rol\u00e3o Preto]], [[Hristo Lukov]], [[Aleksandar Tsankov]], [[Boles\u0142aw Piasecki]], [[Radola Gajda]], [[Eoin O'Duffy]], [[Sven Olov Lindholm]], [[Vihtori Kosola]] and [[Konstantin Rodzaevsky]].\n[[File:Oswald Mosley and Benito Mussolini 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Italy's ''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] (left) with Oswald Mosley (right) during Mosley's visit to Italy in 1936.]]\n\nOther right-wing/far-right political parties such as the [[German National People's Party]], [[CEDA]], [[Unity Party (Hungary)|Party of Hungarian Life]], [[Mladorossi|Union of Mladorossi]] and the [[Fatherland League (Norway)|Fatherland League]] lacked the ideology of fascism but adopted some fascist characteristics. Far-right politicians like [[Alfred Hugenberg]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil-Robles y Qui\u00f1ones|Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil-Robles]] and [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]] represent fascism's influence on the right with these leaders adopting an ultra-nationalist and authoritarian rhetoric influenced by Mussolini and later Hitler's successes.\n\nThe nationalism espoused by these groups contrasted the internationalist focus of communism; there was little coordination between fascist movements prior to the Second World War however there was an attempt at unifying European fascists. The [[1934 Montreux Fascist conference]] was a meeting held by members of a number of European fascist parties and movements and was organised by the Comitati d'Azione per l'Universalit\u00e0 di Roma which received support from Mussolini. The first conference was open to many perspectives and failed to develop any unity amidst the many ideological conflicts among the delegates.  The second conference was equally ineffective and more meetings were attempted.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stanley G. Payne|title=A History of Fascism, 1914\u20131945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_MeR06xqXAC&pg=PA232|year=1996|page=232}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, most fascist regimes were dismantled by the victors, with only those in [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]] surviving. Parties, movements or politicians who carried the label \"fascist\" quickly became political pariahs with many nations across Europe banning any organisations or references relating to fascism and Nazism. With this came the rise of [[Neo-Fascism]], movements like the [[Italian Social Movement]], [[Socialist Reich Party]] and [[Union Movement]] attempted to continue fascism's legacy but failed to become mass movements.\n\nEuropean fascism influenced movements in the Americas. Both [[Fascism in North America|North America]] and [[Fascism in South America|South America]] would develop fascistic political groups rooted in the local European descended communities.  These included the [[National Socialist Movement of Chile|Chilean Nacistas]], [[Brazilian Integralist Action]], [[Nationalist Liberation Alliance|Argentine Civic Legion]], [[Revolutionary Union (Peru)|Peruvian Revolutionary Union]], [[National Synarchist Union]], [[Gold Shirts|Revolutionary Mexicanist Action]] and the [[Silver Legion of America]] along with figures like [[Pl\u00ednio Salgado]], [[Gustavo Barroso]], [[Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez von Mar\u00e9es|Gonz\u00e1lez von Mar\u00e9es]], [[Salvador Abascal]], [[Nicol\u00e1s Rodr\u00edguez Carrasco|Nicol\u00e1s Carrasco]], [[William Dudley Pelley]] and [[Adrien Arcand]]. Some historians also consider Argentine president [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] and his ideology, [[Peronism]] as being influenced by European fascism,<ref name=\"peronism\">Brennan, James P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AsuoVCbF7DgC&q=Fayt#v=snippet&q=Fayt&f=false ''Peronism and Argentina'']. Rowman & Littlefield. 1998.</ref> however, this has been disputed. Brazilian president, [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], and his corporate regime known as the [[Vargas Era|\"New State\"]] was also influenced by Mussolini's rule. European fascism was also influential in the European diaspora elsewhere in the world, in Australia [[Eric Campbell (political activist)|Eric Campbell's]] [[Centre Party (New South Wales)|Centre Party]] and the South African fascist movement, which included [[Oswald Pirow]], being examples of this.\n\n== Early relationship ==\nMussolini and [[Adolf Hitler]] were not always allies. While Mussolini wanted the expansion of fascist ideology throughout the world, he did not initially appreciate Hitler and the [[Nazi Party]]. Hitler was an early admirer of Mussolini and asked for Mussolini's guidance on how the Nazis could pull off their own [[March on Rome]].<ref>Smith, Denis Mack. 1983. ''Mussolini: A Biography.'' New York: Vintage Books. p172</ref> Mussolini did not respond to Hitler's requests as he did not have much interest in Hitler's movement and regarded Hitler to be somewhat crazy.<ref>Smith, Denis Mack. 1983. p172</ref> Mussolini did attempt to read ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' to find out what Hitler's Nazism was, but he was immediately disappointed, saying that ''Mein Kampf'' was \"a boring tome that I have never been able to read\" and claimed that Hitler's beliefs were \"little more than commonplace clich\u00e9s\".<ref>Smith. 1983. p172</ref>\n\nHitler and the Nazi Party in 1922 had praised the rise to power of Mussolini and sought a German-Italian alliance.<ref name=\"Christian Leitz P. 10\">Christian Leitz. ''Nazi Foreign Policy, 1933-1941: The Road to Global War''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: P. 10.</ref> Upon Mussolini's rise to power, the Nazis declared their admiration and emulation of the Italian Fascists, with Nazi member [[Hermann Esser]] in November 1922 saying that \"what a group of brave men in Italy have done, we can also do in Bavaria. We\u2019ve also got Italy\u2019s Mussolini: his name is Adolf Hitler\".<ref name=\"Christian Leitz P. 10\"/>\n\nThe second part of Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'' (\"The National Socialist Movement\", 1926) contains this passage: {{quote|I conceived the profoundest admiration for the great man south of the [[Alps]], who, full of ardent love for his people, made no pacts with the enemies of Italy, but strove for their annihilation by all ways and means. What will rank Mussolini among the great men of this earth is his determination not to share Italy with the [[Marxism|Marxists]], but to destroy [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalism]] and save the [[fatherland]] from it.|sign=Adolf Hitler, ''Mein Kampf'', p. 622}}\n\nIn a 1931 interview, Hitler spoke admirably about Mussolini, commending Mussolini's racial origins as being the same as that of Germans and claimed at the time that Mussolini was capable of building an [[Italian Empire]] that would outdo the [[Roman Empire]] and that he supported Mussolini's endeavors, saying: {{quote|They know that Benito Mussolini is constructing a colossal empire which will put the Roman Empire in the shade. We shall put up ... for his victories. Mussolini is a typical representative of our [[Alpine race]]...|Adolf Hitler, 1931.<ref>Richard Breiting, Adolf Hitler, \u00c9douard Calic (ed.). ''Secret conversations with Hitler:the two newly-discovered 1931 interviews''. John Day Co., 1971. Pp. 77.</ref>}}\n\nMussolini had personal reasons to oppose antisemitism as his longtime mistress and Fascist [[propaganda]] director [[Margherita Sarfatti]] was [[Jew]]ish. She had played an important role in the foundation of the fascist movement in Italy and promoting it to Italians and the world through supporting the arts. However, within the Italian fascist movement there were a minority who endorsed Hitler's antisemitism as [[Roberto Farinacci]], who was part of the far-right wing of the party.\n\nThere were also nationalist reasons why Germany and Italy were not immediate allies. [[Habsburg]] [[Austria]] (Hitler's birthplace) had an antagonistic relationship with Italy since it was formed, largely because [[Austria-Hungary]] had seized most of the territories once belonging to Italian states such as [[Venice]]. Italian [[irredentist]] claims sought the return of these lands to Italian rule (''[[Italia irredenta]]''). Although initially [[Neutral country|neutral]], Italy entered [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] against Germany and Austria-Hungary when promised several territories ([[Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol]], [[Trieste]], [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]]). After the war had ended, Italy was rewarded with these territories under the terms of the 1919 [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]].\n\nIn Germany and Austria, the annexation of Alto Adige/South Tyrol was controversial as the province was made up of a large majority of German speakers. While Hitler did not pursue this claim, many in the Nazi Party felt differently. In 1939, Mussolini and Hitler agreed on the [[South Tyrol Option Agreement]]. When Mussolini's government collapsed in 1943 and the [[Italian Social Republic]] was created, Alto Adige/South Tyrol was annexed to Nazi Greater Germany, but was restored to Italy after the war.\n\n== Racism ==\n{{see also|Italian Fascism and racism}}\nThe most striking difference is the [[Racism|racialist]] ideology which was the central priority of [[Nazism]], but not a priority of the other ideologies. Fascism was founded on the principle of [[nationalist]] [[wikt:unity|unity]] which opposed the divisionist [[Class conflict|class war]] ideologies of [[Socialism (Marxism)|Marxist socialism]] and [[communism]]; therefore, the majority of the regimes viewed racialism as counterproductive to unity, with Mussolini asserting: that \"[[National pride]] has no need of the delirium of race\".<ref>{{cite book  |last=Montagu |first=Ashley |title=Man's Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race|publisher=Rowman Altamira|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tkHqP3vgYi4C&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=%22+Nothing+will+ever+make+me+believe+that+biologically+pure+races+can+be+shown+to+exist+today%22&source=web&ots=ao7O_J0vr8&sig=22zZBSKlbcxbrBF1PXP3_PJygj0&hl=en |isbn=0-8039-4648-1}}</ref>\nNazism differed from Italian fascism in that it had a stronger emphasis on race in terms of social and economic policies. Though both ideologies denied the significance of the individual, Italian fascism saw the individual as subservient to the state whereas Nazism saw the individual as well as the state as ultimately subservient to the race.<ref>Grant, Moyra. Key Ideas in Politics. Nelson Thomas 2003. p. 21</ref> However, subservience to the Nazi state was also a requirement on the population. Mussolini's fascism held that cultural factors existed to serve the state and that it was not necessarily in the state's interest to interfere in cultural aspects of society. The only [[purpose of government]] in Mussolini's fascism was to uphold the state as supreme above all else, a concept which can be described as [[statolatry]].\n\nUnlike Hitler, Mussolini repeatedly changed his views on the issue of race according to the circumstances of the time. In 1921, Mussolini promoted the development of the Italian race such as when he said this: {{quote|text=The nation is not simply the sum of living individuals, nor the instrument of parties for their own ends, but an organism {{sic|comprised|hide=y|of}} the infinite series of generations of which the individuals are only transient elements; it is the supreme synthesis of all the material and immaterial values of the race.|sign=Benito Mussolini, 1921<ref>Gillette, Aaron. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy.'' London: Routledge. p. 39.</ref>}}\n\nLike Hitler, Mussolini publicly declared his support of a eugenics policy to improve the status of Italians in 1926 to the people of [[Reggio Emilia]]: {{quote|text=We need to create ourselves; we of this epoch and this generation, because it is up to us, I tell you, to make the face of this country unrecognizable in the next ten years.

''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 39.</ref> However, Italian fascism initially strongly rejected the common [[Nordic race|Nordicist]] conception of the Aryan race that idealized \"pure\" Aryans as having certain physical traits that were defined as Nordic such as blond hair and blue eyes.<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 188\">Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 188.</ref> The antipathy by Mussolini and other Italian fascists to Nordicism was over the existence of the Mediterranean [[inferiority complex]] that had been instilled into Mediterraneans by the propagation of such theories by German and Anglo-Saxon Nordicists who viewed Mediterranean peoples as racially degenerate and thus inferior.<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 188\"/> Mussolini refused to allow Italy to return again to this inferiority complex.<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 188\"/>\n\nIn a private conversation with Emil Ludwig in 1932, Mussolini derided the concept of a biologically superior race and denounced racism as being a foolish concept. Mussolini did not believe that race alone was that significant. Mussolini viewed himself as a modern-day [[Roman Emperor]], the [[Italians]] as a [[cultural]] [[elite]] and he also wished to \"[[Italianisation|Italianise]]\" the parts of the [[Italian Empire]] which he had desired to build.<ref name=\"cultural\">{{cite news|url=http://jch.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/7/3/115|publisher=jch.sagepub.com|title=Mussolini's Cultural Revolution: Fascist or Nationalist?|date=8 January 2008}}</ref> A cultural superiority of Italians, rather than a view of racialism.<ref name=\"cultural\"/> Mussolini believed that the development of a race was insignificant in comparison to the development of a culture, but he did believe that a race could be improved through moral development, though he did not say that this would make a superior race: {{quote|Race! It is a feeling, not a reality: ninety-five percent, at least, is a feeling. Nothing will ever make me believe that biologically pure races can be shown to exist today. [...] National pride has no need of the delirium of race. Only a revolution and a decisive leader can improve a race, even if this is more a sentiment than a reality. But I repeat that a race can change itself and improve itself. I say that it is possible to change not only the somatic lines, the height, but really also the character. Influence of moral pressure can act deterministically also in the biological sense.| sign=Benito Mussolini, 1932.;<ref>Montagu, Ashley.

He took advantage of the fact that no undertaking with regard to the rights of [[minorities]] such as those that lived in [[Istria]] and [[Trieste]]'s surroundings was made in either the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Treaty of Rapallo]] or the [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Treaty of Rome]] and after 1924 [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Treaty of Rome]] these same treaties did not make any undertaking with regard to the rights of the minorities that lived in [[Rijeka]]. Croatian, Slovene, German and French [[toponyms]] were systematically Italianized.\n\nAgainst ethnic Slovenes, he imposed an especially violent [[fascist Italianization]] policy. To Italianize ethnic [[Slovenes|Slovene]] and [[Croatian people|Croatian]] children, Fascist Italy brought Italian teachers from [[Southern Italy]] to the ex Austro-Hungarian territories that had been given to Italy in exchange for its decision to join Great Britain in World War I such as Slovene Littoral and a big part of western [[Slovenia]] while Slovene and Croatian teachers, poets, writers, artists and clergy were exiled to [[Sardinia]] and [[Southern Italy]]. Acts of fascist violence were not hampered by the authorities, such as the burning down of the [[Narodni dom (Trieste)|Narodni dom]] (Community Hall of ethnic Slovenes in Trieste) in Trieste, which was carried out at night by fascists with the connivance of the police on 13 July 1920.\n\nAfter the complete destruction of all Slovene minority cultural, financial and other organizations and the continuation of violent fascist Italianization policies of ethnic cleansing, one of the first [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organizations in Europe, [[TIGR]], emerged in 1927, and it coordinated the Slovene resistance against Fascist Italy until it was dismantled by the fascist secret police in 1941, after which some ex-TIGR members joined the [[Slovene Partisans]].\n\nFor Mussolini, the inclusion of people in a fascist society depended upon their loyalty to the state. Meetings between Mussolini and [[Arab]] dignitaries from the colony of [[Libya]] convinced him that the Arab population was worthy enough to be given extensive civil rights and as a result, he allowed Muslims to join a [[Muslim]] section of the Fascist Party, namely the [[Muslim Association of the Lictor]].<ref>Sarti, Roland. 1974.

In Italy and Germany a movement came to power that sought to create national unity through the repression of national enemies and the incorporation of all classes and both genders into a permanently mobilized nation.<ref>[http://www.cf.ac.uk/hisar/people/kp/ http://www.cf.ac.uk/hisar/people/kp/]</ref></blockquote>\n\nNazi ideologues such as [[Alfred Rosenburg]] were highly skeptical of the Italian race and fascism, but he believed that the improvement of the Italian race was possible if major changes were made in order to convert it into an acceptable \"Aryan\" race and he also said that the Italian fascist movement would only succeed if it purified the Italian race into an Aryan one.<ref name=\"Gillette. p42\"/> Nazi theorists believed that the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|downfall of the Roman Empire]] was due to the interbreeding of different races which created a \"polluted\" Italian race which was inferior.<ref name=\"Gillette. p42\"/>\n\nHitler believed this and he also believed that Mussolini represented an attempt to revive the pure elements of the former Roman civilization, such as the desire to create a strong and aggressive Italian people. However, Hitler was still audacious enough when meeting Mussolini for the first time in 1934 to tell him that all Mediterranean peoples were \"tainted\" by \"Negro blood\" and thus in his racist view they were degenerate.<ref name=\"Gillette. p42\"/>\n\nRelations between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany were initially poor but they deteriorated even further after the assassination of Austria's fascist chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] by [[Austrian Nazis]] in 1934. Under Dollfuss Austria was a key ally of Mussolini and Mussolini was deeply angered by Hitler's attempt to take over Austria and he expressed it by angrily mocking Hitler's earlier remark on the impurity of the Italian race by declaring that a \"Germanic\" race did not exist and he also indicated that Hitler's repression of Germany's Jews proved that the Germans were not a pure race: {{quote|But which race?

Nazi Germany was even more aggressive in expanding its borders in violation of the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]].  The Nazis murdered the [[Austrofascism|Austrofascist]] dictator Dollfuss, causing an uneasy relationship in Austria between fascism and Nazism at an early stage. [[Italian nationalism|Italian nationalist]] and [[Pan-Germanism|pan-German]] claims clashed over the issue of [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino|Tyrol]].\n\nIn the 1920s, Hitler with only a small Nazi party at the time wanted to form an alliance with Mussolini's regime as he recognized that his pan-German nationalism was seen as a threat by Italy. In Hitler's unpublished sequel to ''Mein Kampf'', he attempts to address concerns among Italian fascists about Nazism. In the book, Hitler puts aside the issue of Germans in Tyrol by explaining that overall Germany and Italy have more in common than not and that the Tyrol Germans must accept that it is in Germany's interests to be allied with Italy. Hitler claims that Germany, like Italy, was subjected to oppression by its neighbours and he denounces the Austrian Empire as having oppressed Italy from completing national unification just as France oppressed Germany from completing its national unification. Hitler's denunciation of Austria in the book is important because Italian fascists were skeptical about him due to the fact that he was born in Austria which Italy had considered to be its primary enemy for centuries and Italy saw Germany as an ally of Austria. By declaring that the Nazi movement was not interested in the territorial legacy of the Austrian Empire, this is a way to assure the Italian fascists that Hitler, the Nazi movement and Germany were not enemies of Italy.\n\nDespite public attempts of goodwill by Hitler towards Mussolini, Germany and Italy came into conflict in 1934 when Engelbert Dollfuss, the Austrofascist leader of Italy's ally Austria, was assassinated by Austrian Nazis on Hitler's orders in preparation for a planned [[Anschluss]] ([[annexation]] of Austria). Mussolini ordered troops to the Austrian-Italian border in readiness for war against Germany. Hitler backed down and defer plans to annex Austria.\n\nWhen Hitler and Mussolini first met, Mussolini referred to Hitler as \"a silly little monkey\" before the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] forced Mussolini into an agreement with Hitler. Mussolini also reportedly asked [[Pope Pius XII]] to [[excommunicate]] Hitler. From 1934 to [[1936]], Hitler continually attempted to win the support of Italy and the Nazi regime endorsed the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian invasion of Ethiopia]] (leading to [[Ethiopia|Ethiopia's]] annexation as [[Italian East Africa]]) while the [[League of Nations]] condemned Italian aggression. With other countries opposing Italy, the fascist regime had no choice but to draw closer to Nazi Germany. Germany joined Italy in supporting the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] under [[Francisco Franco]] with forces and supplies in the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nLater, Germany and Italy signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] committing the two regimes to oppose the [[Comintern]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[communism]]. By 1938, Mussolini allowed Hitler to carry out Anschluss in exchange for official German renunciation of claims to Tyrol. Mussolini supported the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|annexation]] of the [[Sudetenland]] during the [[Munich Agreement]] talks later the same year.\n\nIn 1939, the [[Pact of Steel]] was signed, officially creating an alliance of Germany and Italy. The Nazi official newspaper ''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' published articles extolling the mutually benefit of the alliance: {{quote|Firmly bound together through the inner unity of their ideologies and the comprehensive solidarity of their interests, the German and the Italian people are determined also in future to stand side by side and to strive with united effort for the securing of their [[Lebensraum]] [living space] and the maintenance of peace.|sign=''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' (May 23, 1939)}}\n\nHitler and Mussolini recognized commonalities in their politics and the second part of Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'' (\"The National Socialist Movement\", 1926) contains this passage: {{quote|I conceived the profoundest admiration for the great man south of the [[Alps]], who, full of ardent love for his people, made no pacts with the enemies of Italy, but strove for their annihilation by all ways and means. What will rank Mussolini among the great men of this earth is his determination not to share Italy with the [[Marxism|Marxists]], but to destroy [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalism]] and save the [[fatherland]] from it.|sign=''Mein Kampf'' (p. 622)}}\n\nBoth regimes despised [[French Third Republic|France]] (seen as an enemy which held territories claimed by both Germany and Italy) and [[Yugoslavia]] (seen by the Nazis as a racially degenerate Slavic state and holding lands such as [[Dalmatia]] claimed by the Italian fascists). Fascist territorial claims on Yugoslav territory meant that Mussolini saw the destruction of Yugoslavia as essential for Italian expansion. Hitler viewed Slavs as racially inferior, but he did not see importance in an immediate invasion of Yugoslavia, instead focusing on the threat from the Soviet Union.\n\nMussolini favored using the extremist [[Croatian people|Croatian]] nationalist [[Usta\u0161e]] as a useful tool to tear down Yugoslavia, led by the [[Serb]]s and with a Serbian [[dynasty]], the [[House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]]. In 1941, the Italian military campaign in [[Greece]] (the [[Greco-Italian War]], called the [[Battle of Greece]] for the period after the German intervention) was failing. Hitler reluctantly began the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] with the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]]. German, Italian, [[Bulgaria]]n, [[Hungary during World War II|Hungarian]] and Croatian [[Insurgency|insurgents]] (under the Axis [[Puppet state|puppet]] [[Independent State of Croatia]]) decisively defeated Yugoslavia.\n\nIn the aftermath, with the exception of Serbia and [[Vardar Macedonia]], most of Yugoslavia was reshaped based on Italian fascist foreign policy objectives. Mussolini demanded and received much of Dalmatia from the Croats in exchange for supporting the independence of Croatia. Mussolini's policy of creating an independent Croatia prevailed over Hitler's anti-Slavism and eventually, the Nazis and the Ustashe regime of Croatia would develop closer bonds due to the Ustashe's brutal effectiveness at suppressing Serb dissidents.\n\nThe question of religion also poses considerable conflicting differences as some forms of fascism, particularly the [[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Fatherland Front]] and [[National Union (Portugal)|National Union]] that were devoutly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]. The [[Religious aspects of Nazism|occultist and pagan]] elements of Nazi ideology were very hostile to the traditional Christianity found in the vast majority of fascist movements of the 20th century.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]''\n* [[Falange]]\n* [[Fascism in Africa]]\n* [[Fascism in Asia]]\n* [[Fascism in North America]]\n* [[Fascism in South America]]\n* [[Jingoism]]\n* [[National syndicalism]]\n* [[Radical right (Europe)|Radical right]]\n* [[Syndicalism]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Atkins, Stephen E.

Fascism was born in [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] following [[World War I]], and other fascist movements, influenced by [[Italian Fascism]], subsequently emerged across Europe. Among the political doctrines identified as ideological origins of fascism in Europe are the combining of a traditional national unity and revolutionary anti-democratic rhetoric espoused by [[Integral nationalism|integral nationalist]] [[Charles Maurras]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/5576.html|title=French Literary Fascism|website=Princeton University Press}}</ref> and [[Sorelianism|revolutionary syndicalist]] [[Georges Sorel]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Avant_Garde_Fascism.html?id=ADTdniFtnuwC&redir_esc=y|title=Avant-Garde Fascism: The Mobilization of Myth, Art, and Culture in France , 1909\u20131939|first=Mark|last=Antliff|date=September 3, 2007|publisher=Duke University Press|via=Google Books}}</ref> in [[France]].\n\nThe earliest foundations of fascism in practice can be seen in the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/birthoffascistid00ster|url-access=registration|title=The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution|first1=Zeev|last1=Sternhell|first2=Mario|last2=Sznajder|first3=Maia|last3=Ash\u00e9ri|date=August 8, 1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> led by the Italian nationalist [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], many of whose politics and aesthetics were subsequently used by [[Benito Mussolini]] and his [[Fasci Italiani di Combattimento|Italian Fasci of Combat]] which Mussolini had founded as the ''Fasci of Revolutionary Action'' in 1914. Despite the fact that its members referred to themselves as \"fascists\", the ideology was based around [[national syndicalism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/7870.html|title=Mussolini's Intellectuals|website=Princeton University Press}}</ref> The ideology of fascism would not fully develop until 1921, when Mussolini transformed his movement into the [[National Fascist Party]], which then in 1923 incorporated the [[Italian Nationalist Association]]. The INA established fascist tropes such as [[Blueshirts (Italian Nationalist Association)|colored shirt uniforms]] and also received the support of important proto-fascists like D'Annunzio and [[Italian nationalism|nationalist intellectual]] [[Enrico Corradini]].\n\nThe first declaration of the political stance of fascism was the [[Fascist Manifesto]], written by national syndicalist [[Alceste De Ambris]] and [[Futurism|futurist poet]] [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] and published in 1919. Many of the policies advanced in the manifesto, such as centralization, abolition of the senate, formation of national councils loyal to the state, expanded military power, and support for militias ([[Blackshirts]], for example) were adopted by Mussolini's regime, while other calls such as [[universal suffrage]] and a peaceful foreign policy<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://webspace.tiscali.it/|title=Tiscali Webspace|website=webspace.tiscali.it}}</ref> were abandoned. De Ambris later became a prominent [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]]. In 1932, \"[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]\", an essay by Mussolini and [[Giovanni Gentile]], provided an outline of fascism that better represented Mussolini's regime.\n\n==Regimes and parties==\nSome scholars assert that the term \"fascism\" should only be used to mean the ideology of the National Fascist Party under [[Benito Mussolini]] in Italy, which ruled from 1922 to 1943. However, other European regimes that showed strong similarities to Mussolini's governing are also popularly described as fascist. European regimes often described as fascist or being strongly influenced by fascism include:<ref name=\"Cyprian Blamires 2006\">For coverage of each one see Cyprian Blamires, ed., ''World fascism: a historical encyclopedia'' (Abc-Clio, 2006).</ref>\n* The [[National Fascist Party]]/[[Republican Fascist Party]] in [[Fascist Italy (1922-1943)|Italy]] and the [[Italian Social Republic]] under [[Benito Mussolini]] (1922\u20131945)\n* The [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] under [[Adolf Hitler]] (1933\u20131945) (Based around the ideology of [[National Socialism]], which was heavily influenced by fascism)\n* The [[National Union (Portugal)|National Union]] in [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]] under [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] and [[Marcelo Caetano]] (1933\u20131974) Salazar always rejected the label of fascist criticizing the \"exaltation of youth, the cult of force through direct action, the principle of the superiority of state political power in social life, [and] the propensity for organising masses behind a single leader\" as fundamental differences between fascism and the Catholic corporatism of the Estado Novo, however his regime adopted many fascist characteristics with the [[Legi\u00e3o Portuguesa (Estado Novo)|Legi\u00e3o Portuguesa]] and [[Mocidade Portuguesa]] being the most prominent examples, however these institutions were a little more than window dressing and had no political influence; after the end of the Spanish Civil War Salazar distanced his regime from fascism due to its pro-British orientation<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Vm5by1Najj4C&pg=PA143&lpg=PA143&dq=salazar+mussolini+influence&source=bl&ots=Vh3_mjwAGd&sig=ACfU3U14xB_nTM8w3cFyVJYFMs_aSFlsGw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5PHqt9rhAhXRJVAKHamNAKEQ6AEwC3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=salazar+mussolini+influence&f=false|title=Latin Fascist Elites: The Mussolini, Franco, and Salazar Regimes: The Mussolini, Franco, and Salazar Regimes|first=Paul H.|last=Lewis|date=December 30, 2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Blamires |first1=Cyprian |last2=Lloyd-Jones |first2=Stewart |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1576079409 |page=528}}</ref>\n* The [[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Fatherland Front]] in [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] under [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] and [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] (1934\u20131938) (Based around the ideology of [[Austrofascism]], which was heavily infleunced by [[Italian fascism]]) \n* The [[Yugoslav Radical Union]] in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] under [[Milan Stojadinovi\u0107]] (1935\u20131939) (Stojadinovi\u0107's regime lacked the fascist characteristics of being a mass movement and totalitarian; however, his regime was heavily inspired by fascism)<ref>{{cite book|last=Payne|first=Stanley G.|title=A History of Fascism, 1914\u20131945|year=1996|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0299148742|ref=Payne_1996|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780299148744}}</ref> \n* The [[4th of August Regime]] in [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] under [[Ioannis Metaxas]] (1936\u20131941) (The Metaxist regime was not fully fascist however adopted many fascist characteristics with the [[National Youth Organisation (Greece)|EON]] being an example of this.

However all regimes listed presented fascist influence through authoritarianism, use of organised paramilitaries/youth movements loyal to the state, propaganda and rhetoric that opposed [[liberalism]], [[individualism]], [[democracy]], [[communism]], etc, and built their economies around [[fascist corporatism|corporatism]]. These are all elements of governing popularised by Mussolini. The use of the Roman Salute and coloured shirt uniforms used by most of these regimes also shows how the aesthetics established by the National Fascist Party became adopted throughout Europe.\n\nThere were multiple regimes in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] that were influenced by fascism. These include the [[National Christian Party]] under [[Octavian Goga]] (1938), [[National Renaissance Front|Party of the Nation]] under [[Ion Gigurtu]] (1940) and the [[National Legionary State]] which was led by the [[Iron Guard]] under [[Horia Sima]] in conjunction with the Romanian military dictatorship under [[Ion Antonescu]] (1940-1941).

Far-right politicians like [[Alfred Hugenberg]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil-Robles y Qui\u00f1ones|Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil-Robles]] and [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]] represent fascism's influence on the right with these leaders adopting an ultra-nationalist and authoritarian rhetoric influenced by Mussolini and later Hitler's successes.\n\nThe nationalism espoused by these groups contrasted the internationalist focus of communism; there was little coordination between fascist movements prior to the Second World War however there was an attempt at unifying European fascists. The [[1934 Montreux Fascist conference]] was a meeting held by members of a number of European fascist parties and movements and was organised by the Comitati d'Azione per l'Universalit\u00e0 di Roma which received support from Mussolini. The first conference was open to many perspectives and failed to develop any unity amidst the many ideological conflicts among the delegates.  The second conference was equally ineffective and more meetings were attempted.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stanley G.

Parties, movements or politicians who carried the label \"fascist\" quickly became political pariahs with many nations across Europe banning any organisations or references relating to fascism and Nazism. With this came the rise of [[Neo-Fascism]], movements like the [[Italian Social Movement]], [[Socialist Reich Party]] and [[Union Movement]] attempted to continue fascism's legacy but failed to become mass movements.\n\nEuropean fascism influenced movements in the Americas. Both [[Fascism in North America|North America]] and [[Fascism in South America|South America]] would develop fascistic political groups rooted in the local European descended communities.  These included the [[National Socialist Movement of Chile|Chilean Nacistas]], [[Brazilian Integralist Action]], [[Nationalist Liberation Alliance|Argentine Civic Legion]], [[Revolutionary Union (Peru)|Peruvian Revolutionary Union]], [[National Synarchist Union]], [[Gold Shirts|Revolutionary Mexicanist Action]] and the [[Silver Legion of America]] along with figures like [[Pl\u00ednio Salgado]], [[Gustavo Barroso]], [[Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez von Mar\u00e9es|Gonz\u00e1lez von Mar\u00e9es]], [[Salvador Abascal]], [[Nicol\u00e1s Rodr\u00edguez Carrasco|Nicol\u00e1s Carrasco]], [[William Dudley Pelley]] and [[Adrien Arcand]]. Some historians also consider Argentine president [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] and his ideology, [[Peronism]] as being influenced by European fascism,<ref name=\"peronism\">Brennan, James P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AsuoVCbF7DgC&q=Fayt#v=snippet&q=Fayt&f=false ''Peronism and Argentina'']. Rowman & Littlefield. 1998.</ref> however, this has been disputed. Brazilian president, [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], and his corporate regime known as the [[Vargas Era|\"New State\"]] was also influenced by Mussolini's rule. European fascism was also influential in the European diaspora elsewhere in the world, in Australia [[Eric Campbell (political activist)|Eric Campbell's]] [[Centre Party (New South Wales)|Centre Party]] and the South African fascist movement, which included [[Oswald Pirow]], being examples of this.\n\n== Early relationship ==\nMussolini and [[Adolf Hitler]] were not always allies. While Mussolini wanted the expansion of fascist ideology throughout the world, he did not initially appreciate Hitler and the [[Nazi Party]]. Hitler was an early admirer of Mussolini and asked for Mussolini's guidance on how the Nazis could pull off their own [[March on Rome]].<ref>Smith, Denis Mack. 1983. ''Mussolini: A Biography.'' New York: Vintage Books. p172</ref> Mussolini did not respond to Hitler's requests as he did not have much interest in Hitler's movement and regarded Hitler to be somewhat crazy.<ref>Smith, Denis Mack. 1983. p172</ref> Mussolini did attempt to read ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' to find out what Hitler's Nazism was, but he was immediately disappointed, saying that ''Mein Kampf'' was \"a boring tome that I have never been able to read\" and claimed that Hitler's beliefs were \"little more than commonplace clich\u00e9s\".<ref>Smith. 1983. p172</ref>\n\nHitler and the Nazi Party in 1922 had praised the rise to power of Mussolini and sought a German-Italian alliance.<ref name=\"Christian Leitz P. 10\">Christian Leitz. ''Nazi Foreign Policy, 1933-1941: The Road to Global War''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: P. 10.</ref> Upon Mussolini's rise to power, the Nazis declared their admiration and emulation of the Italian Fascists, with Nazi member [[Hermann Esser]] in November 1922 saying that \"what a group of brave men in Italy have done, we can also do in Bavaria. We\u2019ve also got Italy\u2019s Mussolini: his name is Adolf Hitler\".<ref name=\"Christian Leitz P. 10\"/>\n\nThe second part of Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'' (\"The National Socialist Movement\", 1926) contains this passage: {{quote|I conceived the profoundest admiration for the great man south of the [[Alps]], who, full of ardent love for his people, made no pacts with the enemies of Italy, but strove for their annihilation by all ways and means. What will rank Mussolini among the great men of this earth is his determination not to share Italy with the [[Marxism|Marxists]], but to destroy [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalism]] and save the [[fatherland]] from it.|sign=Adolf Hitler, ''Mein Kampf'', p. 622}}\n\nIn a 1931 interview, Hitler spoke admirably about Mussolini, commending Mussolini's racial origins as being the same as that of Germans and claimed at the time that Mussolini was capable of building an [[Italian Empire]] that would outdo the [[Roman Empire]] and that he supported Mussolini's endeavors, saying: {{quote|They know that Benito Mussolini is constructing a colossal empire which will put the Roman Empire in the shade. We shall put up ... for his victories. Mussolini is a typical representative of our [[Alpine race]]...|Adolf Hitler, 1931.<ref>Richard Breiting, Adolf Hitler, \u00c9douard Calic (ed.). ''Secret conversations with Hitler:the two newly-discovered 1931 interviews''. John Day Co., 1971. Pp. 77.</ref>}}\n\nMussolini had personal reasons to oppose antisemitism as his longtime mistress and Fascist [[propaganda]] director [[Margherita Sarfatti]] was [[Jew]]ish. She had played an important role in the foundation of the fascist movement in Italy and promoting it to Italians and the world through supporting the arts. However, within the Italian fascist movement there were a minority who endorsed Hitler's antisemitism as [[Roberto Farinacci]], who was part of the far-right wing of the party.\n\nThere were also nationalist reasons why Germany and Italy were not immediate allies. [[Habsburg]] [[Austria]] (Hitler's birthplace) had an antagonistic relationship with Italy since it was formed, largely because [[Austria-Hungary]] had seized most of the territories once belonging to Italian states such as [[Venice]]. Italian [[irredentist]] claims sought the return of these lands to Italian rule (''[[Italia irredenta]]''). Although initially [[Neutral country|neutral]], Italy entered [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] against Germany and Austria-Hungary when promised several territories ([[Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol]], [[Trieste]], [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]]). After the war had ended, Italy was rewarded with these territories under the terms of the 1919 [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]].\n\nIn Germany and Austria, the annexation of Alto Adige/South Tyrol was controversial as the province was made up of a large majority of German speakers. While Hitler did not pursue this claim, many in the Nazi Party felt differently. In 1939, Mussolini and Hitler agreed on the [[South Tyrol Option Agreement]]. When Mussolini's government collapsed in 1943 and the [[Italian Social Republic]] was created, Alto Adige/South Tyrol was annexed to Nazi Greater Germany, but was restored to Italy after the war.\n\n== Racism ==\n{{see also|Italian Fascism and racism}}\nThe most striking difference is the [[Racism|racialist]] ideology which was the central priority of [[Nazism]], but not a priority of the other ideologies. Fascism was founded on the principle of [[nationalist]] [[wikt:unity|unity]] which opposed the divisionist [[Class conflict|class war]] ideologies of [[Socialism (Marxism)|Marxist socialism]] and [[communism]]; therefore, the majority of the regimes viewed racialism as counterproductive to unity, with Mussolini asserting: that \"[[National pride]] has no need of the delirium of race\".<ref>{{cite book  |last=Montagu |first=Ashley |title=Man's Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race|publisher=Rowman Altamira|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tkHqP3vgYi4C&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=%22+Nothing+will+ever+make+me+believe+that+biologically+pure+races+can+be+shown+to+exist+today%22&source=web&ots=ao7O_J0vr8&sig=22zZBSKlbcxbrBF1PXP3_PJygj0&hl=en |isbn=0-8039-4648-1}}</ref>\nNazism differed from Italian fascism in that it had a stronger emphasis on race in terms of social and economic policies. Though both ideologies denied the significance of the individual, Italian fascism saw the individual as subservient to the state whereas Nazism saw the individual as well as the state as ultimately subservient to the race.<ref>Grant, Moyra. Key Ideas in Politics. Nelson Thomas 2003. p. 21</ref> However, subservience to the Nazi state was also a requirement on the population. Mussolini's fascism held that cultural factors existed to serve the state and that it was not necessarily in the state's interest to interfere in cultural aspects of society. The only [[purpose of government]] in Mussolini's fascism was to uphold the state as supreme above all else, a concept which can be described as [[statolatry]].\n\nUnlike Hitler, Mussolini repeatedly changed his views on the issue of race according to the circumstances of the time. In 1921, Mussolini promoted the development of the Italian race such as when he said this: {{quote|text=The nation is not simply the sum of living individuals, nor the instrument of parties for their own ends, but an organism {{sic|comprised|hide=y|of}} the infinite series of generations of which the individuals are only transient elements; it is the supreme synthesis of all the material and immaterial values of the race.|sign=Benito Mussolini, 1921<ref>Gillette, Aaron. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy.'' London: Routledge. p. 39.</ref>}}\n\nLike Hitler, Mussolini publicly declared his support of a eugenics policy to improve the status of Italians in 1926 to the people of [[Reggio Emilia]]: {{quote|text=We need to create ourselves; we of this epoch and this generation, because it is up to us, I tell you, to make the face of this country unrecognizable in the next ten years. In ten years comrades, Italy will be unrecognizable! We will create a new Italian, an Italian that does not recognize the Italian of yesterday...we will create them according to our own imagination and likeness. | sign=Benito Mussolini, 1926<ref>Gillette. p. 39.</ref>}}\n\nIn a 1921 speech in [[Bologna]], Mussolini stated the following: \"Fascism was born [...] out of a profound, perennial need of this our [[Aryan]] and [[Mediterranean race]]\".<ref>Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 11.</ref><ref>Neocleous, Mark. ''Fascism''. Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA: University of Minnesota Press, 1997. p.&nbsp;35</ref> In this speech, Mussolini was referring to Italians as being the Mediterranean branch of the [[Aryan race]], Aryan in the meaning of people of an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] and culture.<ref>Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 39.</ref> However, Italian fascism initially strongly rejected the common [[Nordic race|Nordicist]] conception of the Aryan race that idealized \"pure\" Aryans as having certain physical traits that were defined as Nordic such as blond hair and blue eyes.<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 188\">Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 188.</ref> The antipathy by Mussolini and other Italian fascists to Nordicism was over the existence of the Mediterranean [[inferiority complex]] that had been instilled into Mediterraneans by the propagation of such theories by German and Anglo-Saxon Nordicists who viewed Mediterranean peoples as racially degenerate and thus inferior.<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 188\"/> Mussolini refused to allow Italy to return again to this inferiority complex.<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 188\"/>\n\nIn a private conversation with Emil Ludwig in 1932, Mussolini derided the concept of a biologically superior race and denounced racism as being a foolish concept. Mussolini did not believe that race alone was that significant. Mussolini viewed himself as a modern-day [[Roman Emperor]], the [[Italians]] as a [[cultural]] [[elite]] and he also wished to \"[[Italianisation|Italianise]]\" the parts of the [[Italian Empire]] which he had desired to build.<ref name=\"cultural\">{{cite news|url=http://jch.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/7/3/115|publisher=jch.sagepub.com|title=Mussolini's Cultural Revolution: Fascist or Nationalist?|date=8 January 2008}}</ref> A cultural superiority of Italians, rather than a view of racialism.<ref name=\"cultural\"/> Mussolini believed that the development of a race was insignificant in comparison to the development of a culture, but he did believe that a race could be improved through moral development, though he did not say that this would make a superior race: {{quote|Race! It is a feeling, not a reality: ninety-five percent, at least, is a feeling. Nothing will ever make me believe that biologically pure races can be shown to exist today. [...] National pride has no need of the delirium of race. Only a revolution and a decisive leader can improve a race, even if this is more a sentiment than a reality. But I repeat that a race can change itself and improve itself. I say that it is possible to change not only the somatic lines, the height, but really also the character. Influence of moral pressure can act deterministically also in the biological sense.| sign=Benito Mussolini, 1932.;<ref>Montagu, Ashley. Man's Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race|publisher=Rowman Altamira|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tkHqP3vgYi4C&printsec=frontcover</ref><ref name=\"Gillette. p42\">Gillette. p. 42.</ref>}}\n\nMussolini believed that a biologically superior race was not possible, but that a more developed culture's superiority over the less developed ones warranted the destruction of the latter, such as the culture of [[Ethiopia]] and the neighboring [[Slavs|Slavic cultures]], such as those in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]]. He took advantage of the fact that no undertaking with regard to the rights of [[minorities]] such as those that lived in [[Istria]] and [[Trieste]]'s surroundings was made in either the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Treaty of Rapallo]] or the [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Treaty of Rome]] and after 1924 [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Treaty of Rome]] these same treaties did not make any undertaking with regard to the rights of the minorities that lived in [[Rijeka]]. Croatian, Slovene, German and French [[toponyms]] were systematically Italianized.\n\nAgainst ethnic Slovenes, he imposed an especially violent [[fascist Italianization]] policy. To Italianize ethnic [[Slovenes|Slovene]] and [[Croatian people|Croatian]] children, Fascist Italy brought Italian teachers from [[Southern Italy]] to the ex Austro-Hungarian territories that had been given to Italy in exchange for its decision to join Great Britain in World War I such as Slovene Littoral and a big part of western [[Slovenia]] while Slovene and Croatian teachers, poets, writers, artists and clergy were exiled to [[Sardinia]] and [[Southern Italy]]. Acts of fascist violence were not hampered by the authorities, such as the burning down of the [[Narodni dom (Trieste)|Narodni dom]] (Community Hall of ethnic Slovenes in Trieste) in Trieste, which was carried out at night by fascists with the connivance of the police on 13 July 1920.\n\nAfter the complete destruction of all Slovene minority cultural, financial and other organizations and the continuation of violent fascist Italianization policies of ethnic cleansing, one of the first [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organizations in Europe, [[TIGR]], emerged in 1927, and it coordinated the Slovene resistance against Fascist Italy until it was dismantled by the fascist secret police in 1941, after which some ex-TIGR members joined the [[Slovene Partisans]].\n\nFor Mussolini, the inclusion of people in a fascist society depended upon their loyalty to the state. Meetings between Mussolini and [[Arab]] dignitaries from the colony of [[Libya]] convinced him that the Arab population was worthy enough to be given extensive civil rights and as a result, he allowed Muslims to join a [[Muslim]] section of the Fascist Party, namely the [[Muslim Association of the Lictor]].<ref>Sarti, Roland. 1974. ''The Ax Within: Italian Fascism in Action.'' New York: New Viewpoints. p190.</ref> However, under pressure from Nazi Germany the fascist regime eventually embraced a racist ideology, such as promoting the belief that Italy was settling Africa in order to create a white civilization there<ref>Sarti, 1974. p189.</ref> and it imposed five-year prison sentences on any Italians who were caught having sexual or marital relationships with native Africans.<ref>Sarti, 1974. p190.</ref> Against those colonial peoples who were not loyal, vicious campaigns of repression were waged such as in Ethiopia, where native Ethiopian settlements were burned to the ground by the Italian armed forces in 1937.<ref>Sarti, 1974. p191.</ref> Under fascism, native Africans were allowed to join the Italian armed forces as colonial troops and they also appeared in [[Propaganda of Fascist Italy|fascist propaganda]].<ref>http://www.germaniainternational.com/images/bookgijuinit13.jpg</ref><ref>http://www.germaniainternational.com/images/bookgijuinit14.jpg</ref>\n\nAt least in its overt ideology, the Nazi movement believed that the existence of a class-based society was a threat to its survival and as a result, it wanted to unify the racial element above the established classes, but the Italian fascist movement sought to preserve the class system and uphold it as the foundation of an established and desirable culture.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Nevertheless, the Italian fascists did not reject the concept of [[social mobility]] and a central tenet of the fascist state was [[meritocracy]], yet fascism also heavily based itself on [[corporatism]], which was supposed to supersede [[class conflict]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Despite these differences, Kevin Passmore (2002 p.&nbsp;62) observes: <blockquote>There are sufficient similarities between Fascism and Nazism to make it worthwhile by applying the concept of fascism to both. In Italy and Germany a movement came to power that sought to create national unity through the repression of national enemies and the incorporation of all classes and both genders into a permanently mobilized nation.<ref>[http://www.cf.ac.uk/hisar/people/kp/ http://www.cf.ac.uk/hisar/people/kp/]</ref></blockquote>\n\nNazi ideologues such as [[Alfred Rosenburg]] were highly skeptical of the Italian race and fascism, but he believed that the improvement of the Italian race was possible if major changes were made in order to convert it into an acceptable \"Aryan\" race and he also said that the Italian fascist movement would only succeed if it purified the Italian race into an Aryan one.<ref name=\"Gillette. p42\"/> Nazi theorists believed that the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|downfall of the Roman Empire]] was due to the interbreeding of different races which created a \"polluted\" Italian race which was inferior.<ref name=\"Gillette. p42\"/>\n\nHitler believed this and he also believed that Mussolini represented an attempt to revive the pure elements of the former Roman civilization, such as the desire to create a strong and aggressive Italian people. However, Hitler was still audacious enough when meeting Mussolini for the first time in 1934 to tell him that all Mediterranean peoples were \"tainted\" by \"Negro blood\" and thus in his racist view they were degenerate.<ref name=\"Gillette. p42\"/>\n\nRelations between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany were initially poor but they deteriorated even further after the assassination of Austria's fascist chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] by [[Austrian Nazis]] in 1934. Under Dollfuss Austria was a key ally of Mussolini and Mussolini was deeply angered by Hitler's attempt to take over Austria and he expressed it by angrily mocking Hitler's earlier remark on the impurity of the Italian race by declaring that a \"Germanic\" race did not exist and he also indicated that Hitler's repression of Germany's Jews proved that the Germans were not a pure race: {{quote|But which race? Does there exist a German race. Has it ever existed? Will it ever exist? Reality, myth, or hoax of theorists? (Another parenthesis: the theoretician of racism is a 100 percent Frenchman: Gobineau) Ah well, we respond, a Germanic race does not exist. Various movements. Curiosity. Stupor. We repeat. Does not exist. We don't say so. Scientists say so. Hitler says so. | sign=Benito Mussolini, 1934<ref>Gillette. p. 45.</ref>}}\n\n== Foreign affairs ==\n{{Nazism sidebar}}\nItalian Fascism was [[expansionist]] in its desires, looking to create a [[New Roman Empire]]. Nazi Germany was even more aggressive in expanding its borders in violation of the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]].  The Nazis murdered the [[Austrofascism|Austrofascist]] dictator Dollfuss, causing an uneasy relationship in Austria between fascism and Nazism at an early stage. [[Italian nationalism|Italian nationalist]] and [[Pan-Germanism|pan-German]] claims clashed over the issue of [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino|Tyrol]].\n\nIn the 1920s, Hitler with only a small Nazi party at the time wanted to form an alliance with Mussolini's regime as he recognized that his pan-German nationalism was seen as a threat by Italy. In Hitler's unpublished sequel to ''Mein Kampf'', he attempts to address concerns among Italian fascists about Nazism. In the book, Hitler puts aside the issue of Germans in Tyrol by explaining that overall Germany and Italy have more in common than not and that the Tyrol Germans must accept that it is in Germany's interests to be allied with Italy. Hitler claims that Germany, like Italy, was subjected to oppression by its neighbours and he denounces the Austrian Empire as having oppressed Italy from completing national unification just as France oppressed Germany from completing its national unification. Hitler's denunciation of Austria in the book is important because Italian fascists were skeptical about him due to the fact that he was born in Austria which Italy had considered to be its primary enemy for centuries and Italy saw Germany as an ally of Austria. By declaring that the Nazi movement was not interested in the territorial legacy of the Austrian Empire, this is a way to assure the Italian fascists that Hitler, the Nazi movement and Germany were not enemies of Italy.\n\nDespite public attempts of goodwill by Hitler towards Mussolini, Germany and Italy came into conflict in 1934 when Engelbert Dollfuss, the Austrofascist leader of Italy's ally Austria, was assassinated by Austrian Nazis on Hitler's orders in preparation for a planned [[Anschluss]] ([[annexation]] of Austria). Mussolini ordered troops to the Austrian-Italian border in readiness for war against Germany. Hitler backed down and defer plans to annex Austria.\n\nWhen Hitler and Mussolini first met, Mussolini referred to Hitler as \"a silly little monkey\" before the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] forced Mussolini into an agreement with Hitler. Mussolini also reportedly asked [[Pope Pius XII]] to [[excommunicate]] Hitler. From 1934 to [[1936]], Hitler continually attempted to win the support of Italy and the Nazi regime endorsed the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian invasion of Ethiopia]] (leading to [[Ethiopia|Ethiopia's]] annexation as [[Italian East Africa]]) while the [[League of Nations]] condemned Italian aggression. With other countries opposing Italy, the fascist regime had no choice but to draw closer to Nazi Germany. Germany joined Italy in supporting the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] under [[Francisco Franco]] with forces and supplies in the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nLater, Germany and Italy signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] committing the two regimes to oppose the [[Comintern]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[communism]]. By 1938, Mussolini allowed Hitler to carry out Anschluss in exchange for official German renunciation of claims to Tyrol. Mussolini supported the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|annexation]] of the [[Sudetenland]] during the [[Munich Agreement]] talks later the same year.\n\nIn 1939, the [[Pact of Steel]] was signed, officially creating an alliance of Germany and Italy. The Nazi official newspaper ''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' published articles extolling the mutually benefit of the alliance: {{quote|Firmly bound together through the inner unity of their ideologies and the comprehensive solidarity of their interests, the German and the Italian people are determined also in future to stand side by side and to strive with united effort for the securing of their [[Lebensraum]] [living space] and the maintenance of peace.|sign=''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' (May 23, 1939)}}\n\nHitler and Mussolini recognized commonalities in their politics and the second part of Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'' (\"The National Socialist Movement\", 1926) contains this passage: {{quote|I conceived the profoundest admiration for the great man south of the [[Alps]], who, full of ardent love for his people, made no pacts with the enemies of Italy, but strove for their annihilation by all ways and means. What will rank Mussolini among the great men of this earth is his determination not to share Italy with the [[Marxism|Marxists]], but to destroy [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalism]] and save the [[fatherland]] from it.|sign=''Mein Kampf'' (p. 622)}}\n\nBoth regimes despised [[French Third Republic|France]] (seen as an enemy which held territories claimed by both Germany and Italy) and [[Yugoslavia]] (seen by the Nazis as a racially degenerate Slavic state and holding lands such as [[Dalmatia]] claimed by the Italian fascists). Fascist territorial claims on Yugoslav territory meant that Mussolini saw the destruction of Yugoslavia as essential for Italian expansion. Hitler viewed Slavs as racially inferior, but he did not see importance in an immediate invasion of Yugoslavia, instead focusing on the threat from the Soviet Union.\n\nMussolini favored using the extremist [[Croatian people|Croatian]] nationalist [[Usta\u0161e]] as a useful tool to tear down Yugoslavia, led by the [[Serb]]s and with a Serbian [[dynasty]], the [[House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]]. In 1941, the Italian military campaign in [[Greece]] (the [[Greco-Italian War]], called the [[Battle of Greece]] for the period after the German intervention) was failing. Hitler reluctantly began the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] with the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]]. German, Italian, [[Bulgaria]]n, [[Hungary during World War II|Hungarian]] and Croatian [[Insurgency|insurgents]] (under the Axis [[Puppet state|puppet]] [[Independent State of Croatia]]) decisively defeated Yugoslavia.\n\nIn the aftermath, with the exception of Serbia and [[Vardar Macedonia]], most of Yugoslavia was reshaped based on Italian fascist foreign policy objectives. Mussolini demanded and received much of Dalmatia from the Croats in exchange for supporting the independence of Croatia. Mussolini's policy of creating an independent Croatia prevailed over Hitler's anti-Slavism and eventually, the Nazis and the Ustashe regime of Croatia would develop closer bonds due to the Ustashe's brutal effectiveness at suppressing Serb dissidents.\n\nThe question of religion also poses considerable conflicting differences as some forms of fascism, particularly the [[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Fatherland Front]] and [[National Union (Portugal)|National Union]] that were devoutly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]. The [[Religious aspects of Nazism|occultist and pagan]] elements of Nazi ideology were very hostile to the traditional Christianity found in the vast majority of fascist movements of the 20th century.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]''\n* [[Falange]]\n* [[Fascism in Africa]]\n* [[Fascism in Asia]]\n* [[Fascism in North America]]\n* [[Fascism in South America]]\n* [[Jingoism]]\n* [[National syndicalism]]\n* [[Radical right (Europe)|Radical right]]\n* [[Syndicalism]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Atkins, Stephen E.

Bosepandi ([[Sivakarthikeyan]]) and Kodi ([[Soori (actor)|Soori]]) are two friends who are the leaders of a group called Varuthapadadha Valibar Sangam. One day, Bosepandi falls in love with Kalyani ([[Bindu Madhavi]]) who is a teacher at a school. Bosepandi writes a love letter for her but wants someone to go give it to her so that's when he finds Lathapandi. Lathapandi gives the letter to her teacher and tricks Bosepandi into believing many things.\n\nSivanandi fixes a marriage for Lathapandi but she is not willing to marry because she is very young and she wants to study further. Despite her attempts, nothing stops her marriage. Her marriage was posted on a billboard and Bosepandi and Kodi decide to stop it. They go to the police station and threaten the police that they will go to the commissioner. The police talks to Sivanandi and makes him stop the marriage. One day, Lathapandi delivers the news to Bosepandi that Kalyani is getting married. He decides to move on in life, so he arranges for a Dindigul programme to happen in his area. He sees Lathapandi in a sari and immediately falls in love with her. The same night, the police reveals to Sivanandi that the person who stopped Lathapandi's marriage was Bosepandi.\n\nA day later he tells her about his love for her but she ignores him and says no. Bosepandi walks away listening to a sad song when a gang comes and bashes him. He later finds out that it was Sivanandi's gang who hit him. So Bosepandi and Kodi decide to steal what Sivanandi considers his 'soul' and that is his gun. Bosepandi and Kodi steal the gun and run away and cause a lot of trouble. Bosepandi then tells Lathapandi that he will return the gun if she comes to their friends marriage and so he returns the gun without anyone knowing. Lathapandi in return, goes to that marriage and takes lots of photos with Bosepandi. Her mother warns her that this is not correct and she should stop it. Sivanandi's cow falls into a well when he goes out of town so Bosepandi helps to get it out. That night he stays with Lathapandi in her house and they see Sivanandi sleepwalking. After that, they wake up in the morning and they see Sivanandi walking again. This time he is awake but Bosepandi thinks he's sleepwalking again and so he tells Sivanandi about liking his daughter. Once he finds out that he is indeed awake, he runs out of that house.\n\nSivanandi then makes Lathapandi promise that she will only marry the guy who Sivanandi tells her to marry and so she does promise her dad. They fix a marriage for Lathapandi but on the night before her marriage, she decides to run away with Bosepandi. When running away at night, they see Sivanandi and he tells them to run away and gives them some money so that they never come back. Sivanandi wants Bosepandi and Lathapandi to run away because he doesn't want Lathapandi to marry the guy he has chosen for her and he can't stop her marriage because he has too much respect in his village. He watches them get married and then he walks home with blood on his shirt (the blood is of a goat that he killed) and lies to everyone that he killed his daughter because of his reputation. Bosepandi and Lathapandi return though and ruin Sivanandi's plans and Bosepandi stated that he returned because his father offered him more money. The film ends with Sivanandi and Bosepandi laughing happily.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Sivakarthikeyan]] as Bosepandi M.A M.Phil, President of Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam\n* [[Sathyaraj]] as Sivanaandi, Bosepandi's rival\n* [[Sri Divya]] as Lathapandi, Bosepandi's love interest\n* [[Soori (actor)|Soori]] as Kodi, Bosepandi's friend and Secretary of Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam\n* [[Soundararaja]] as Pullichathanni, Sangam member\n* Shalu Shammu as Kodi's lover, Lathapandi's friend\n* [[Rajendran]] as Coolmayi, Sivanandi's enemy and Bosepandi's uncle\n* [[Sriranjini (Tamil actress)|Sriranjini]] as Dhanalakshmi, Lathapandi's mother\n* [[Swaminathan]] as Lawyer Veerasamy, advocate of Sangam \n* [[Elango Kumaravel]] as constable\n* [[Yaar Kannan]] as Bosepandi's father\n* [[Dhandapani]] as Sivanandi's sidekick\n* Subramaniyapuram Raja as Sivanandi's sidekick\n* Hello Kanthaswamy as Sivanandi's sidekick\n* [[Vinodhini Vaidyanathan]] as Inspector Bharathi\n* [[Joe Malloori]] as Police Inspector\n* [[Bindu Madhavi]] as Kalyani (Special Appearance)\n{{colend}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| longtype   = to Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam\n| artist     = [[D.

Bosepandi ([[Sivakarthikeyan]]) and Kodi ([[Soori (actor)|Soori]]) are two friends who are the leaders of a group called Varuthapadadha Valibar Sangam. One day, Bosepandi falls in love with Kalyani ([[Bindu Madhavi]]) who is a teacher at a school. Bosepandi writes a love letter for her but wants someone to go give it to her so that's when he finds Lathapandi. Lathapandi gives the letter to her teacher and tricks Bosepandi into believing many things.\n\nSivanandi fixes a marriage for Lathapandi but she is not willing to marry because she is very young and she wants to study further. Despite her attempts, nothing stops her marriage. Her marriage was posted on a billboard and Bosepandi and Kodi decide to stop it. They go to the police station and threaten the police that they will go to the commissioner. The police talks to Sivanandi and makes him stop the marriage. One day, Lathapandi delivers the news to Bosepandi that Kalyani is getting married. He decides to move on in life, so he arranges for a Dindigul programme to happen in his area. He sees Lathapandi in a sari and immediately falls in love with her. The same night, the police reveals to Sivanandi that the person who stopped Lathapandi's marriage was Bosepandi.\n\nA day later he tells her about his love for her but she ignores him and says no. Bosepandi walks away listening to a sad song when a gang comes and bashes him. He later finds out that it was Sivanandi's gang who hit him. So Bosepandi and Kodi decide to steal what Sivanandi considers his 'soul' and that is his gun. Bosepandi and Kodi steal the gun and run away and cause a lot of trouble. Bosepandi then tells Lathapandi that he will return the gun if she comes to their friends marriage and so he returns the gun without anyone knowing. Lathapandi in return, goes to that marriage and takes lots of photos with Bosepandi. Her mother warns her that this is not correct and she should stop it. Sivanandi's cow falls into a well when he goes out of town so Bosepandi helps to get it out. That night he stays with Lathapandi in her house and they see Sivanandi sleepwalking. After that, they wake up in the morning and they see Sivanandi walking again. This time he is awake but Bosepandi thinks he's sleepwalking again and so he tells Sivanandi about liking his daughter. Once he finds out that he is indeed awake, he runs out of that house.\n\nSivanandi then makes Lathapandi promise that she will only marry the guy who Sivanandi tells her to marry and so she does promise her dad. They fix a marriage for Lathapandi but on the night before her marriage, she decides to run away with Bosepandi. When running away at night, they see Sivanandi and he tells them to run away and gives them some money so that they never come back. Sivanandi wants Bosepandi and Lathapandi to run away because he doesn't want Lathapandi to marry the guy he has chosen for her and he can't stop her marriage because he has too much respect in his village. He watches them get married and then he walks home with blood on his shirt (the blood is of a goat that he killed) and lies to everyone that he killed his daughter because of his reputation. Bosepandi and Lathapandi return though and ruin Sivanandi's plans and Bosepandi stated that he returned because his father offered him more money. The film ends with Sivanandi and Bosepandi laughing happily.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Sivakarthikeyan]] as Bosepandi M.A M.Phil, President of Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam\n* [[Sathyaraj]] as Sivanaandi, Bosepandi's rival\n* [[Sri Divya]] as Lathapandi, Bosepandi's love interest\n* [[Soori (actor)|Soori]] as Kodi, Bosepandi's friend and Secretary of Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam\n* [[Soundararaja]] as Pullichathanni, Sangam member\n* Shalu Shammu as Kodi's lover, Lathapandi's friend\n* [[Rajendran]] as Coolmayi, Sivanandi's enemy and Bosepandi's uncle\n* [[Sriranjini (Tamil actress)|Sriranjini]] as Dhanalakshmi, Lathapandi's mother\n* [[Swaminathan]] as Lawyer Veerasamy, advocate of Sangam \n* [[Elango Kumaravel]] as constable\n* [[Yaar Kannan]] as Bosepandi's father\n* [[Dhandapani]] as Sivanandi's sidekick\n* Subramaniyapuram Raja as Sivanandi's sidekick\n* Hello Kanthaswamy as Sivanandi's sidekick\n* [[Vinodhini Vaidyanathan]] as Inspector Bharathi\n* [[Joe Malloori]] as Police Inspector\n* [[Bindu Madhavi]] as Kalyani (Special Appearance)\n{{colend}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| longtype   = to Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam\n| artist     = [[D.
