Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=Cities>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html Wilder's Brigade Mounted Infantry Living History Society]</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrote to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities/>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref name=Leigh>[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/ \"Colonel Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade,\" Phil Leigh, ''New York Times'' 25 Dec 2012]</ref><ref name=Disaster>[https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm \"Battle of Chickamauga: Colonel John Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade Prevented Total Disaster,\" Hubert Jordan, ''America\u2019s Civil War'', Jul 1997]</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon used a seven rimfire-cartridge tubular magazine that came through the butt. This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>. His troops moved out toward Liberty, Bellbuckle, and Hoover's Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref name=\"Sunderland, Hoover's Gap\">Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref name=Lightning/>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS Chickamauga]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had deployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref name=Disaster/>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=Cities>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html Wilder's Brigade Mounted Infantry Living History Society]</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrote to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities/>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref name=Leigh>[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/ \"Colonel Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade,\" Phil Leigh, ''New York Times'' 25 Dec 2012]</ref><ref name=Disaster>[https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm \"Battle of Chickamauga: Colonel John Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade Prevented Total Disaster,\" Hubert Jordan, ''America\u2019s Civil War'', Jul 1997]</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon used a seven rimfire-cartridge tubular magazine that came through the butt. This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>.

Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref name=Lightning/>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS Chickamauga]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had deployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref name=Disaster/>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W.

Known for visual style and dynamic live performances, Underworld have influenced a wide range of artists and been featured in soundtracks and scores for films, television, and the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early years ===\nHyde and Smith began their musical partnership in Cardiff in 1979 with the [[Kraftwerk]] and [[reggae]]-inspired sounds of The Screen Gemz.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hugh|first1=Montgomery|title=How We Met: Rick Smith &amp; Karl Hyde|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/how-we-met-rick-smith-amp-karl-hyde-2130458.html|website=[[The Independent (UK)]]|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Dorian|first1=Lynskey|title=Underworld's Dubnobass ... 20 years on|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/09/karl-hyde-rick-smith-underworld-1994-album-dubnobasswithmyheadman|website=[[The Guardian (UK)]]|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref> They were joined by The Screen Gemz' [[Bass guitar|bass]] player Alfie Thomas, [[drum]]mer Bryn Burrows, and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboardist]] John Warwicker in forming a proto-[[electroclash]]/[[New wave music|new wave]] band whose name was a graphic squiggle, which was subsequently given the pronunciation [[Freur]]. The band signed to [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]], released 1983's ''[[Doot-Doot]]'', and disbanded in 1986 after followup ''[[Get Us out of Here]]'' was withheld.<ref>{{cite web|title=Freur |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/freur-mn0000987643/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, Hyde, Smith, Thomas, Burrows and bass player Baz Allen formed a band under the name Underworld (named after a [[Underworld (1985 film)|Clive Barker-scripted film]] which was scored by Freur),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/09/karl-hyde-rick-smith-underworld-1994-album-dubnobasswithmyheadman |title=Underworld's Dubnobass ... 20 years on |last1=Lynskey |first1=Dorian |date=9 October 2014 |website=[[Theguardian.com]]|accessdate=9 October 2014}}</ref> which tried a more guitar-orientated [[funk]]y [[electropop]] sound. The band signed to [[Sire Records]] and released the album ''[[Underneath the Radar]]'' in 1988 and, following the departure of Burrows, the album ''[[Change the Weather]]'' in 1989. This version of the band disbanded in 1990 and is supposedly regarded as a separate entity by the band's members to the one which would go on to release ''Dubnobasswithmyheadman'' (this album is therefore frequently referred to as being a debut). The Underworld of the ''Underneath the Radar'' and ''Change the Weather'' period is sometimes also referred to as being \"Underworld Mk1\".\n\n=== Underworld Mk2 ===\n{{Listen\n|filename=Underworld Rez.ogg\n|title=\"Rez\"\n|description=The band's 1993 dance anthem, \"Rez\".\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nAfter a break\u2014to concentrate on, among other things, art/design project [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]]\u2014Hyde and Smith recruited DJ [[Darren Emerson]] and after several minor releases and remixes as Lemon Inter<!--This is the intentional spelling of the band name with one 'r'-->upt and Steppin' Razor readopted the Underworld moniker. They produced danceable [[techno]] as a trio (\"Underworld Mk2\").\n\nThe addition of Emerson completed Underworld's techno/rock fusion and seemed to eliminate the pop elements in the original duo's work. Their first album, ''[[Dubnobasswithmyheadman]]'', was considered more accessible than the group's earlier material and crossed a large spectrum of dance music. The signature Hyde lyrics were in place: poetic, hypnotic and whispered; mixing conventional song writing with the use of [[Found art|found material]] from overheard conversations, answering machine recordings and the like. Hyde had been the lead singer in Underworld Mk1 but the original Hyde/Smith dance material was lyric-free as was most of the electronic music emerging from the aftermath of [[acid house]].\n\n=== The ''Trainspotting'' breakthrough ===\nThe band's 1996 album, ''[[Second Toughest in the Infants]]'', was their second studio album with Emerson and achieved a degree of commercial success, due in part to its release coinciding with that of the film ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''. The film featured \"Dark & Long (Dark Train)\", as well as the band's most commercially successful track to date, \"[[Born Slippy.NUXX]]\", which was originally released only as a B-side of a single and does not appear on the ''Second Toughest'' album. The single and the album showed Underworld maturing as a trio, mixing elements of [[techno]], [[House music|house]], [[drum and bass]] and [[experimental music]].\n\"Born Slippy.NUXX\" is one of Underworld's best-known tracks and is celebrated as one of the greatest dance tracks of the decade. It was originally released in 1995 as a B-side to \"[[Born Slippy]]\" but failed to catch on until it was included in ''Trainspotting''. The track has since sold over a million copies and appeared on countless [[Compilation album|compilations]], [[Mashup (music)|mashups]] and [[remix]]es.\n\n=== ''Beaucoup Fish'' era ===\nAfter the release of fifth studio album ''[[Beaucoup Fish]]'' in 1999, Hyde declared in his interviews that he had sorted out earlier problems with [[alcoholism]] but all the members admitted that the sessions had been fraught with problems, with the individual members working in their own studios and only communicating via mixes of the raw material passed back and forth on [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]]. After the release of the album a large number of mixes of the album tracks seemed to surface on singles, magazine promotional CDs and similar ephemeral formats perhaps indicating the number of revisions the tracks had gone through to get to the point where they were acceptable to all three. The album's name derives from a sample of a Cajun fisherman in Louisiana on the track \"[[Jumbo (song)|Jumbo]]\". The band originally wanted to call the album ''Tonight, Matthew, I'm going to be Underworld'' (a catchphrase used by contestants on the UK [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] programme [[Stars in Their Eyes]]) but were convinced by their record company, [[Junior Boy's Own]], that the name would not be easily understood outside the UK. Finally, after all the singles had been released, a box set, ''[[Beaucoup Fish Singles]]'', which was a retrospective of all 4 singles came out.\n\nUnderworld embarked on a well-received tour in 1999, which resulted in a live CD and DVD drawn from several dates on the tour. Called ''[[Everything, Everything (album)|Everything, Everything]]'', the project captured the live Underworld experience very faithfully. A companion DVD was released separately soon after the album's release. The DVD features live footage of the band mixed with videography and artistic effects by the design group [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]]. The DVD also features several songs not on the album: \"Moaner\", \"Puppies\", \"Kittens\" and \"Rowla\". The disco scene in ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' features Underworld's 1993 hit \"Rez\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259711/soundtrack|title=Vanilla Sky (2001) |website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Back to a duo ===\nAfter the release and promotion of ''Everything, Everything'', Emerson decided to leave Underworld to focus on his solo projects and record label. Hyde and Smith decided to continue as a duo. They recorded a new album, ''[[A Hundred Days Off]]'', released to general approval. Despite its status as the band's first studio album since Emerson's departure, its general sound and feel was, perhaps surprisingly for many Underworld fans, not dissimilar to the previous albums on which Emerson had had input. In 2003, a 2-disc anthology entitled ''1992\u20132002'' was released. This was the first appearance on an album of previously unavailable single tracks and B-sides, such as \"Bigmouth\", \"[[Spikee]]\", \"Dirty\" and \"8 Ball\". While touring in the summer and autumn of 2005, the duo was joined on stage by Darren Price, a DJ and producer who had remixed Underworld releases in the past.\n\nDuring their tour, they released a 3-CD set ''[[Live in Tokyo 25th November 2005|Live in Tokyo]]'', which was sold after the concert in Japan and later sold online. In late 2005, they released two compilations of new songs with accompanying photographs on Underworld Live, in a series entitled ''[[Riverrun (Underworld project)|Riverrun]]''. These were only released online, with no physical release (except for a promo CD). On 5 June 2006, they released their third installment, and on 10 July 2006, they released ''The Misterons Mix'', a special retrospective mix composed of ''Riverrun'' tracks, as an exclusive free download for customers that had purchased all three ''Riverrun'' releases.\n\nIn September 2006, Underworld released five limited edition (10,000 copies each) [[12\"]] vinyl releases, containing remixes of various ''Riverrun'' tracks. These tracks were also made available for purchase by digital download on the [[Beatport]] website. Later in 2006, the band teamed up with [[Gabriel Yared]] to compose the music score to [[Anthony Minghella]]'s film ''[[Breaking and Entering (film)|Breaking and Entering]]''. [[Breaking and Entering (soundtrack)|The soundtrack]] was released in the UK on 6 November, and in the USA on 5 December.\n\n=== ''Oblivion with Bells''===\n[[File:Underworldlivenewyork2007 crop.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Underworld performing \"[[Jumbo (song)|Jumbo]]\" in [[Central Park]], [[New York City]], 2007.]]\nUnderworld's seventh studio album, ''[[Oblivion with Bells]]'', was released on 16 October 2007.

Approximately 30 masked Greek anarchists stormed the stadium while the [[Beastie Boys]] were performing. Rick Smith was one of the people injured in the ensuing violence and he was taken to a nearby Athens hospital for treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/underworld-dj-injured-in-riot-r157510.htm|title=UNDERWORLD DJ INJURED IN RIOT|accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref> On 19 October 2007, Underworld cancelled the remaining dates of their European tour due to illness in the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26653_0_2_0_C|title=Underworld cancel tour after severe illness member|accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref> The tour was picked up again on 28 January 2008, with a concert in Cologne, followed by 16 dates in Europe, including some festivals.\n\nOn 8 August 2008, Underworld appeared at the [[All Points West Music & Arts Festival]] in [[Liberty State Park]], New Jersey. [[Radiohead]] dedicated their final song \"[[Everything in its Right Place]]\" to Underworld with a special remix. Karl Hyde appeared with [[Brian Eno]] on the final day of the Eno-curated Luminous Festival at Sydney Opera House. \"Pure Scenius\" consisted of three live improvised performances on the same day, featuring Eno, Hyde, Australian improv trio [[The Necks]], electronic artist [[Jon Hopkins]] and guitarist [[Leo Abrahams]].\n\nUnderworld has released two new series via their underworldlive.com site, in mp3 and WAV formats. The tracks are 020202, and the phonestrap/autotrader series. On 3 July 2009, Underworld debuted a new song tentatively titled \"Between Stars\" at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. Shortly before that, a post was made on the band's diary page showing a piece of paper with the song's first verse on it. On 8 August 2009, a show at Los Angeles' Forum was cancelled in circumstances similar to those that led to the group cancelling the show in Athens two years prior. Some of the crowd were climbing down the seats and onto the main floor, a potential safety hazard. The group apologized on their website for having the show called off.\n\nOn 8 March 2010 [[Mark Knight (musician)|Mark Knight]] and [[D. Ramirez]] released the single \"Downpipe\", which featured vocal contributions from Underworld's Karl Hyde. The song, released on Mark Knight's Toolroom Records label, has a music video featuring the \"Playhouse\", a lighting setup on Liberty Hall, the tallest building in [[Dublin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbghaUtVfJg|title=Downpipe music video|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n===''Barking''===\nOn 13 May 2010, the band released a track called \"Scribble\" for download on the band's site. The track shares elements with \"[[Live in Tokyo 25th November 2005|You Do Scribble]]\", an unreleased song which they featured many times since 2005 in their live performance shows. The track is a collaboration with [[High Contrast]], a [[drum and bass]] [[DJ]] also from Cardiff. On 14 May, the full version of \"Scribble\" was featured on [[Pete Tong]]'s [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] radio show, declaring it as [[Essential Selection|Essential New Tune]] of the week.<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC Radio 1 \u2013 Pete Tong |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ww0v |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822183839/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ww0v |archivedate=22 August 2015 }}</ref> The group also released a video clip for \"Scribble\" on [[YouTube]].

The album was available from the band's website and was packaged with the exhibition catalogue. In December 2010 it was announced that Underworld would reunite with ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'' director Danny Boyle to write the musical score for his production of [[Frankenstein (2011 play)|Frankenstein]] at the [[Royal National Theatre]]. The production was broadcast as a part of [[National Theatre Live]] on 17 March 2011, with a soundtrack release on Underworld's website in March 2011. In February 2011 Underworld confirmed that they would play a huge London summer show on Saturday 27 August on Clapham Common as headliners of South West Four.\n\n=== ''Anthology,'' the Olympics and solo projects ===\nIn November 2011, Underworld announced two new compilations, ''A Collection'' and ''1992\u20132012 Anthology''. ''A Collection'' features many of the band's biggest tracks alongside recent collaborations with High Contrast featuring [[Ti\u00ebsto]] & Underworld (\"The First Note Is Silent\"), Mark Knight & D. Ramirez (\"Downpipe\") and [[Brian Eno]] (\"Beebop Hurry\"). ''1992\u20132012 Anthology'' is a 3-disc set and is a refreshed and revisited version of ''1992\u20132002'' with more material, unreleased tracks and rarities to go some way to completing the picture of the first two decades of Underworld.\n\nIn December 2011, Underworld were chosen to direct the music for the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], reprising their partnership with filmmaker and ceremony director [[Danny Boyle]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hanna |first=Laurie |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/music/2011/12/07/underworld-to-create-london-2012-opening-ceremony-music-115875-23616597/ |title=Underworld to create London 2012 opening ceremony music \u2013 Mirror Online |website=Mirror.co.uk |date=7 December 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> The band also contributed two original tracks for the opening ceremony: \"[[And I Will Kiss]]\" (ft.

But it also serves as an outlet for experimentation, new releases, and spontaneous creativity. The first new song released as part of the World of Underworld, \"Brilliant Yes That Would Be\", was recorded and mixed just days before it was released.

Prominent former members include [[Darren Emerson]], from 1991 to 2001, and Darren Price, as part of the live band from 2005 to 2016.\n\nAfter performing as a [[funk]] and [[synth-pop]] band, resulting in two albums between 1988 and 1989, Underworld gained prominence, after reshaping in 1993, into the [[progressive house]] and [[techno]] band and releasing seven subsequent albums, including ''[[Dubnobasswithmyheadman]]'' (1994), ''[[Second Toughest in the Infants]]'' (1996), and the 1996 single \"[[Born Slippy .NUXX]]\". Known for visual style and dynamic live performances, Underworld have influenced a wide range of artists and been featured in soundtracks and scores for films, television, and the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early years ===\nHyde and Smith began their musical partnership in Cardiff in 1979 with the [[Kraftwerk]] and [[reggae]]-inspired sounds of The Screen Gemz.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hugh|first1=Montgomery|title=How We Met: Rick Smith &amp; Karl Hyde|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/how-we-met-rick-smith-amp-karl-hyde-2130458.html|website=[[The Independent (UK)]]|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Dorian|first1=Lynskey|title=Underworld's Dubnobass ... 20 years on|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/09/karl-hyde-rick-smith-underworld-1994-album-dubnobasswithmyheadman|website=[[The Guardian (UK)]]|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref> They were joined by The Screen Gemz' [[Bass guitar|bass]] player Alfie Thomas, [[drum]]mer Bryn Burrows, and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboardist]] John Warwicker in forming a proto-[[electroclash]]/[[New wave music|new wave]] band whose name was a graphic squiggle, which was subsequently given the pronunciation [[Freur]]. The band signed to [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]], released 1983's ''[[Doot-Doot]]'', and disbanded in 1986 after followup ''[[Get Us out of Here]]'' was withheld.<ref>{{cite web|title=Freur |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/freur-mn0000987643/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, Hyde, Smith, Thomas, Burrows and bass player Baz Allen formed a band under the name Underworld (named after a [[Underworld (1985 film)|Clive Barker-scripted film]] which was scored by Freur),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/09/karl-hyde-rick-smith-underworld-1994-album-dubnobasswithmyheadman |title=Underworld's Dubnobass ... 20 years on |last1=Lynskey |first1=Dorian |date=9 October 2014 |website=[[Theguardian.com]]|accessdate=9 October 2014}}</ref> which tried a more guitar-orientated [[funk]]y [[electropop]] sound. The band signed to [[Sire Records]] and released the album ''[[Underneath the Radar]]'' in 1988 and, following the departure of Burrows, the album ''[[Change the Weather]]'' in 1989. This version of the band disbanded in 1990 and is supposedly regarded as a separate entity by the band's members to the one which would go on to release ''Dubnobasswithmyheadman'' (this album is therefore frequently referred to as being a debut). The Underworld of the ''Underneath the Radar'' and ''Change the Weather'' period is sometimes also referred to as being \"Underworld Mk1\".\n\n=== Underworld Mk2 ===\n{{Listen\n|filename=Underworld Rez.ogg\n|title=\"Rez\"\n|description=The band's 1993 dance anthem, \"Rez\".\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nAfter a break\u2014to concentrate on, among other things, art/design project [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]]\u2014Hyde and Smith recruited DJ [[Darren Emerson]] and after several minor releases and remixes as Lemon Inter<!--This is the intentional spelling of the band name with one 'r'-->upt and Steppin' Razor readopted the Underworld moniker. They produced danceable [[techno]] as a trio (\"Underworld Mk2\").\n\nThe addition of Emerson completed Underworld's techno/rock fusion and seemed to eliminate the pop elements in the original duo's work. Their first album, ''[[Dubnobasswithmyheadman]]'', was considered more accessible than the group's earlier material and crossed a large spectrum of dance music. The signature Hyde lyrics were in place: poetic, hypnotic and whispered; mixing conventional song writing with the use of [[Found art|found material]] from overheard conversations, answering machine recordings and the like. Hyde had been the lead singer in Underworld Mk1 but the original Hyde/Smith dance material was lyric-free as was most of the electronic music emerging from the aftermath of [[acid house]].\n\n=== The ''Trainspotting'' breakthrough ===\nThe band's 1996 album, ''[[Second Toughest in the Infants]]'', was their second studio album with Emerson and achieved a degree of commercial success, due in part to its release coinciding with that of the film ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''. The film featured \"Dark & Long (Dark Train)\", as well as the band's most commercially successful track to date, \"[[Born Slippy.NUXX]]\", which was originally released only as a B-side of a single and does not appear on the ''Second Toughest'' album. The single and the album showed Underworld maturing as a trio, mixing elements of [[techno]], [[House music|house]], [[drum and bass]] and [[experimental music]].\n\"Born Slippy.NUXX\" is one of Underworld's best-known tracks and is celebrated as one of the greatest dance tracks of the decade. It was originally released in 1995 as a B-side to \"[[Born Slippy]]\" but failed to catch on until it was included in ''Trainspotting''. The track has since sold over a million copies and appeared on countless [[Compilation album|compilations]], [[Mashup (music)|mashups]] and [[remix]]es.\n\n=== ''Beaucoup Fish'' era ===\nAfter the release of fifth studio album ''[[Beaucoup Fish]]'' in 1999, Hyde declared in his interviews that he had sorted out earlier problems with [[alcoholism]] but all the members admitted that the sessions had been fraught with problems, with the individual members working in their own studios and only communicating via mixes of the raw material passed back and forth on [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]]. After the release of the album a large number of mixes of the album tracks seemed to surface on singles, magazine promotional CDs and similar ephemeral formats perhaps indicating the number of revisions the tracks had gone through to get to the point where they were acceptable to all three. The album's name derives from a sample of a Cajun fisherman in Louisiana on the track \"[[Jumbo (song)|Jumbo]]\". The band originally wanted to call the album ''Tonight, Matthew, I'm going to be Underworld'' (a catchphrase used by contestants on the UK [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] programme [[Stars in Their Eyes]]) but were convinced by their record company, [[Junior Boy's Own]], that the name would not be easily understood outside the UK. Finally, after all the singles had been released, a box set, ''[[Beaucoup Fish Singles]]'', which was a retrospective of all 4 singles came out.\n\nUnderworld embarked on a well-received tour in 1999, which resulted in a live CD and DVD drawn from several dates on the tour. Called ''[[Everything, Everything (album)|Everything, Everything]]'', the project captured the live Underworld experience very faithfully. A companion DVD was released separately soon after the album's release. The DVD features live footage of the band mixed with videography and artistic effects by the design group [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]]. The DVD also features several songs not on the album: \"Moaner\", \"Puppies\", \"Kittens\" and \"Rowla\". The disco scene in ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' features Underworld's 1993 hit \"Rez\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259711/soundtrack|title=Vanilla Sky (2001) |website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Back to a duo ===\nAfter the release and promotion of ''Everything, Everything'', Emerson decided to leave Underworld to focus on his solo projects and record label. Hyde and Smith decided to continue as a duo. They recorded a new album, ''[[A Hundred Days Off]]'', released to general approval. Despite its status as the band's first studio album since Emerson's departure, its general sound and feel was, perhaps surprisingly for many Underworld fans, not dissimilar to the previous albums on which Emerson had had input. In 2003, a 2-disc anthology entitled ''1992\u20132002'' was released. This was the first appearance on an album of previously unavailable single tracks and B-sides, such as \"Bigmouth\", \"[[Spikee]]\", \"Dirty\" and \"8 Ball\". While touring in the summer and autumn of 2005, the duo was joined on stage by Darren Price, a DJ and producer who had remixed Underworld releases in the past.\n\nDuring their tour, they released a 3-CD set ''[[Live in Tokyo 25th November 2005|Live in Tokyo]]'', which was sold after the concert in Japan and later sold online. In late 2005, they released two compilations of new songs with accompanying photographs on Underworld Live, in a series entitled ''[[Riverrun (Underworld project)|Riverrun]]''. These were only released online, with no physical release (except for a promo CD). On 5 June 2006, they released their third installment, and on 10 July 2006, they released ''The Misterons Mix'', a special retrospective mix composed of ''Riverrun'' tracks, as an exclusive free download for customers that had purchased all three ''Riverrun'' releases.\n\nIn September 2006, Underworld released five limited edition (10,000 copies each) [[12\"]] vinyl releases, containing remixes of various ''Riverrun'' tracks. These tracks were also made available for purchase by digital download on the [[Beatport]] website. Later in 2006, the band teamed up with [[Gabriel Yared]] to compose the music score to [[Anthony Minghella]]'s film ''[[Breaking and Entering (film)|Breaking and Entering]]''. [[Breaking and Entering (soundtrack)|The soundtrack]] was released in the UK on 6 November, and in the USA on 5 December.\n\n=== ''Oblivion with Bells''===\n[[File:Underworldlivenewyork2007 crop.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Underworld performing \"[[Jumbo (song)|Jumbo]]\" in [[Central Park]], [[New York City]], 2007.]]\nUnderworld's seventh studio album, ''[[Oblivion with Bells]]'', was released on 16 October 2007.

Approximately 30 masked Greek anarchists stormed the stadium while the [[Beastie Boys]] were performing. Rick Smith was one of the people injured in the ensuing violence and he was taken to a nearby Athens hospital for treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/underworld-dj-injured-in-riot-r157510.htm|title=UNDERWORLD DJ INJURED IN RIOT|accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref> On 19 October 2007, Underworld cancelled the remaining dates of their European tour due to illness in the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26653_0_2_0_C|title=Underworld cancel tour after severe illness member|accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref> The tour was picked up again on 28 January 2008, with a concert in Cologne, followed by 16 dates in Europe, including some festivals.\n\nOn 8 August 2008, Underworld appeared at the [[All Points West Music & Arts Festival]] in [[Liberty State Park]], New Jersey. [[Radiohead]] dedicated their final song \"[[Everything in its Right Place]]\" to Underworld with a special remix. Karl Hyde appeared with [[Brian Eno]] on the final day of the Eno-curated Luminous Festival at Sydney Opera House. \"Pure Scenius\" consisted of three live improvised performances on the same day, featuring Eno, Hyde, Australian improv trio [[The Necks]], electronic artist [[Jon Hopkins]] and guitarist [[Leo Abrahams]].\n\nUnderworld has released two new series via their underworldlive.com site, in mp3 and WAV formats. The tracks are 020202, and the phonestrap/autotrader series. On 3 July 2009, Underworld debuted a new song tentatively titled \"Between Stars\" at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. Shortly before that, a post was made on the band's diary page showing a piece of paper with the song's first verse on it. On 8 August 2009, a show at Los Angeles' Forum was cancelled in circumstances similar to those that led to the group cancelling the show in Athens two years prior. Some of the crowd were climbing down the seats and onto the main floor, a potential safety hazard. The group apologized on their website for having the show called off.\n\nOn 8 March 2010 [[Mark Knight (musician)|Mark Knight]] and [[D. Ramirez]] released the single \"Downpipe\", which featured vocal contributions from Underworld's Karl Hyde. The song, released on Mark Knight's Toolroom Records label, has a music video featuring the \"Playhouse\", a lighting setup on Liberty Hall, the tallest building in [[Dublin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbghaUtVfJg|title=Downpipe music video|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n===''Barking''===\nOn 13 May 2010, the band released a track called \"Scribble\" for download on the band's site. The track shares elements with \"[[Live in Tokyo 25th November 2005|You Do Scribble]]\", an unreleased song which they featured many times since 2005 in their live performance shows. The track is a collaboration with [[High Contrast]], a [[drum and bass]] [[DJ]] also from Cardiff. On 14 May, the full version of \"Scribble\" was featured on [[Pete Tong]]'s [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] radio show, declaring it as [[Essential Selection|Essential New Tune]] of the week.<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC Radio 1 \u2013 Pete Tong |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ww0v |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822183839/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ww0v |archivedate=22 August 2015 }}</ref> The group also released a video clip for \"Scribble\" on [[YouTube]].

The album was available from the band's website and was packaged with the exhibition catalogue. In December 2010 it was announced that Underworld would reunite with ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'' director Danny Boyle to write the musical score for his production of [[Frankenstein (2011 play)|Frankenstein]] at the [[Royal National Theatre]]. The production was broadcast as a part of [[National Theatre Live]] on 17 March 2011, with a soundtrack release on Underworld's website in March 2011. In February 2011 Underworld confirmed that they would play a huge London summer show on Saturday 27 August on Clapham Common as headliners of South West Four.\n\n=== ''Anthology,'' the Olympics and solo projects ===\nIn November 2011, Underworld announced two new compilations, ''A Collection'' and ''1992\u20132012 Anthology''.

Ramirez (\"Downpipe\") and [[Brian Eno]] (\"Beebop Hurry\"). ''1992\u20132012 Anthology'' is a 3-disc set and is a refreshed and revisited version of ''1992\u20132002'' with more material, unreleased tracks and rarities to go some way to completing the picture of the first two decades of Underworld.\n\nIn December 2011, Underworld were chosen to direct the music for the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], reprising their partnership with filmmaker and ceremony director [[Danny Boyle]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hanna |first=Laurie |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/music/2011/12/07/underworld-to-create-london-2012-opening-ceremony-music-115875-23616597/ |title=Underworld to create London 2012 opening ceremony music \u2013 Mirror Online |website=Mirror.co.uk |date=7 December 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> The band also contributed two original tracks for the opening ceremony: \"[[And I Will Kiss]]\" (ft.

But it also serves as an outlet for experimentation, new releases, and spontaneous creativity.

[[Foot racing]] had become popular in [[England]] by the 17th century, when [[footman|footmen]] would race and their masters would wager on the result.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} By the 19th century \"[[pedestrianism]]\", as it was called, had become extremely popular and the best times recorded in the period were by professionals.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Even after professional foot racing died out, it was not until 1915 that the professional record of 4:12{{frac|3|4}} (set by [[Walter George (athlete)|Walter George]] in 1886) was surpassed by an amateur.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nProgression of the mile record accelerated in the 1930s as [[newsreel]] coverage greatly popularized the sport, making stars out of milers such as [[Jules Ladoum\u00e8gue]], [[Jack Lovelock]], and [[Glenn Cunningham (runner)|Glenn Cunningham]]. In the 1940s, Swedes [[Arne Andersson]] and [[Gunder H\u00e4gg]] lowered the record to just over four minutes (4:01.4) while racing was curtailed during World War II in the combatant countries.  After the war,  [[John Landy]] of Australia and Britain's [[Roger Bannister]] vied to be the first to break the fabled [[four-minute mile]] barrier. Roger Bannister did it first on May 6, 1954, and John Landy followed 46 days later. By the end of the 20th century, the record had been lowered to the time of 3:43.13 run by [[Hicham El Guerrouj]] of [[Morocco]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iaaf.org/statistics/records/gender=M/allrecords/discipline=MILE/index.html |title=International Association of Athletics Federations |publisher=IAAF |date= |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n\nOn the women's side, the first sub-5:00 mile was achieved by Britain's [[Diane Leather]] 23 days after Bannister's first sub-4:00 mile. However, the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) did not recognize women's records for the distance until 1967, when [[Anne Smith (middle-distance runner)|Anne Smith]] of Britain ran 4:37.0. The current women's world record, pending ratification, is 4:12.33 by [[Sifan Hassan]], set on July 12, 2019.\n\n==Men==\n<timeline>\n#>\nThe chart is clipped at 3:20 (200 seconds), and magnified by 3 (three pixels height equal 1 second)\n<#\nImageSize  = width:700 height:300 # The width can be changed without much harm (remember to change the PlotArea below too)\nPlotArea   = width:650 height:280 left:25 bottom:20\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:1850 till:2000\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:10 start:1850\n\nColors=\n  id:grid value: gray(0.5)\n\nLineData=\n  width: 0.1\n  color: grid\n  from: start till: end atpos: 30\n  from: start till: end atpos: 60\n  from: start till: end atpos: 90\n  from: start till: end atpos: 120\n  from: start till: end atpos: 150\n  from: start till: end atpos: 180\n  from: start till: 01/01/1960 atpos: 210\n  from: start till: 01/01/1960 atpos: 240\n  from: start till: end atpos: 270\nTextData=\n  pos:(0,30) text: \"3:30\"\n  pos:(0,60) text: \"3:40\"\n  pos:(0,90) text: \"3:50\"\n  pos:(0,120) text: \"4:00\"\n  pos:(0,150) text: \"4:10\"\n  pos:(0,180) text: \"4:20\"\n  pos:(0,210) text: \"4:30\"\n  pos:(0,240) text: \"4:40\"\n  pos:(0,270) text: \"4:50\"\n\nTextData=\n  fontsize: M\n  pos:(520,250)  textcolor: blue text: Amateurs\n  pos:(520,220)  textcolor: red text: Professionals\n  pos:(520,190)  textcolor: orange text: IAAF\n\nLineData=\n  width: 0.2\n  color: red\n  at: 26/07/1852 tillpos: 204\n  at: 28/09/1857 tillpos: 204\n  at: 12/07/1858 tillpos: 189\n  at: 27/10/1860 tillpos: 186.75\n  at: 11/07/1863 tillpos: 185.25\n  at: 23/04/1864 tillpos: 181.5\n  at: 19/08/1865 tillpos: 171.75\n  at: 19/08/1865 tillpos: 171.75\n  at: 14/05/1881 tillpos: 168.6\n  at: 23/08/1886 tillpos: 158.25\n\nLineData=\n  width: 0.2\n  color: blue\n  at: 02/09/1852 tillpos: 276.0\n  at: 03/11/1858 tillpos: 255.0\n  at: 15/11/1858 tillpos: 255.0\n  at: 24/11/1859 tillpos: 240.0\n  at: 23/05/1862 tillpos: 219.0\n  at: 10/03/1868 tillpos: 208.8\n  at: 03/04/1868 tillpos: 206.4\n  at: 31/03/1873 tillpos: 205.8\n  at: 30/05/1874 tillpos: 198.0\n  at: 19/06/1875 tillpos: 193.5\n  at: 16/08/1880 tillpos: 189.6\n  at: 03/06/1882 tillpos: 178.2\n  at: 21/06/1884 tillpos: 175.2\n  at: 26/08/1893 tillpos: 173.4\n  at: 06/07/1895 tillpos: 171.0\n  at: 28/08/1895 tillpos: 166.8\n  at: 27/05/1911 tillpos: 154.2\nLineData=\n  width: 0.2\n  color: orange\n  at: 31/05/1913 tillpos: 163.2\n  at: 16/07/1915 tillpos: 157.8\n  at: 23/08/1923 tillpos: 151.2\n  at: 04/10/1931 tillpos: 147.6\n  at: 15/07/1933 tillpos: 142.8\n  at: 16/06/1934 tillpos: 140.4\n  at: 28/08/1937 tillpos: 139.2\n  at: 01/07/1942 tillpos: 138.6\n  at: 10/07/1942 tillpos: 138.6\n  at: 04/09/1942 tillpos: 133.8\n  at: 01/07/1943 tillpos: 127.8\n  at: 18/07/1944 tillpos: 124.8\n  at: 17/07/1945 tillpos: 124.2\n  at: 06/05/1954 tillpos: 118.2\n  at: 21/06/1954 tillpos: 114.0\n  at: 19/07/1957 tillpos: 111.6\n  at: 06/08/1958 tillpos: 103.5\n  at: 27/01/1962 tillpos: 103.2\n  at: 17/11/1964 tillpos: 102.3\n  at: 09/06/1965 tillpos: 100.8\n  at: 17/07/1966 tillpos: 93.9\n  at: 23/06/1967 tillpos: 93.3\n  at: 17/05/1975 tillpos: 93.0\n  at: 12/08/1975 tillpos: 88.2\n  at: 17/07/1979 tillpos: 87.0\n  at: 01/07/1980 tillpos: 86.4\n  at: 19/08/1981 tillpos: 85.59\n  at: 26/08/1981 tillpos: 85.2\n  at: 28/08/1981 tillpos: 81.99\n  at: 27/07/1985 tillpos: 78.96\n  at: 05/09/1993 tillpos: 73.17\n  at: 07/07/1999 tillpos: 69.39\n\n</timeline>\n\n=== Pre-IAAF ===\n\n===Professionals===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Time !!Athlete !!Nationality !!Date !!Venue\n|-\n|'''4:28'''|| [[Charles Westhall]] || {{GBR}} || 26 July 1855|| [[London]] \n|-\n|'''4:28'''|| [[Thomas Horspool]] || {{GBR}} || 28 September 1857 || [[Manchester]]\n|-\n|'''4:23'''|| Thomas Horspool || {{GBR}} || 12 July 1858|| Manchester \n|-\n|'''4:22{{frac|1|4}}'''|| [[Siah Albison]] || {{GBR}} || 27 October 1860|| Manchester\n|-\n|'''4:21{{frac|3|4}}'''|| [[William Lang (British athlete)|William Lang]]|| {{GBR}} || 11 July 1863 || Manchester\n|-\n|'''4:20{{frac|1|2}}'''|| Edward Mills|| {{GBR}} || 23 April 1864 || Manchester\n|-\n|'''4:20'''|| Edward Mills|| {{GBR}} || 25 June 1864|| Manchester \n|-\n|'''4:17{{frac|1|4}}'''|| William Lang|| {{GBR}} || 19 August 1865|| Manchester \n|-\n|'''4:17{{frac|1|4}}'''|| William Richards|| {{GBR}} || 19 August 1865|| Manchester\n|-\n|'''4:16{{frac|1|5}}'''|| [[William Cummings (athlete)|William Cummings]] || {{GBR}} || 14 May 1881|| Preston\n|-\n|'''4:12{{frac|3|4}}'''|| [[Walter George (athlete)|Walter George]]|| {{GBR}} || 23 August 1886|| London \n|}\n\n===Amateurs===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Time !!Athlete !!Nationality !!Date !!Venue\n|-\n|'''4:55'''|| [[J.

In his work ''Art of Thought'', published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:\n:(i) ''[[Preparation (principle)|preparation]]'' (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),\n:(ii) ''incubation'' (where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening),\n:(iii) ''intimation'' (the creative person gets a \"feeling\" that a solution is on its way),\n:(iv) ''illumination'' or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its [[preconscious]] processing into conscious awareness);\n:(v) ''verification'' (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).\nWallas' model is often treated as four stages, with \"intimation\" seen as a sub-stage.\n\nWallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the [[evolution]]ary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments.

This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.\n\n=== Conceptual blending ===\n{{Main|Conceptual blending}}\nIn ''[[The Act of Creation]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]] introduced the concept of ''bisociation'' \u2014 that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference.<ref name=\"Koestler64\">{{cite book |author=Koestler, A. |title=The Act of Creation |year=1964 |authorlink=Arthur Koestler |isbn=978-0-330-73116-4 |publisher=Pan Books |location=London}}</ref> This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with [[metaphor]], [[analogy]], and [[structure mapping]] have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label [[conceptual blending]].\n\n=== Honing theory ===\nHoning theory, developed principally by psychologist [[Liane Gabora]], posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.\n\nA central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state.<ref>Gabora, L. & Saab, A. (2011). Creative interference and states of potentiality in analogy problem solving. ''Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society''. July 20\u201323, 2011, Boston MA.</ref> Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly \u2018mutating\u2019 predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel \u2018half-baked\u2019. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.\n\nHoning theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even though in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.\n\n=== Everyday imaginative thought ===\nIn everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think \"if only...\".<ref>Roese, N. J. & Olson, J. M. (1995). ''What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking''. Mahwah, New Jersey: Erlbaum</ref> Their [[counterfactual thinking]] is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes.<ref>Markman, K. Klein, W. & Suhr, E. (eds) (2009).

It makes use of the results of divergent thinking tests (see below) by processing them further. It gives more weight to ideas that are radically different from other ideas in the response.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Allan|date=2004|title=The creativity quotient: An objective scoring of ideational fluency|journal=Creativity Research Journal|volume=16|issue=4|pages=415\u2013419|doi=10.1080/10400410409534552}}</ref>\n\n=== Psychometric approach ===\n[[J. P. Guilford]]'s group,<ref name=\"Guilford67\" /> which pioneered the modern [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:\n* Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.\n* Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.\n* Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.\n* Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.\n* Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)\n* Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events (e.g. loss of gravity)\n\nOriginally, Guilford was trying to create a model for intellect as a whole, but in doing so also created a model for creativity. Guilford made an important assumption for creative research: creativity isn't one abstract concept. \u00a0The idea that creativity is a category rather than one single concept opened up the ability for other researchers to look at creativity with a whole new perspective.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|last2=Grigorenko|first2=Elena L.|date=8 June 2010|title=Guilford's Structure of Intellect Model and Model of Creativity: Contributions and Limitations|journal= Creativity Research Journal|volume=13|issue=3\u20134|pages=309\u2013316|doi=10.1207/s15326934crj1334_08|issn=1040-0419}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guilford|first=J.

Ideational fluency, or the ability rapidly to produce a variety of ideas that fulfill stated requirements;\n#: b. Associational fluency, or the ability to generate a list of words, each of which is associated with a given word; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n#: c.

Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual \u2018sells high\u2019 by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment.

High creativity will result when an individual is: intrinsically motivated, possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking, and is working in a highly creative environment.\n*Amusement Park Theoretical Model.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baer | first1 = J. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J.

The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels, intelligence plays a key role:\n**To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements (e.g., time/transport to go to the park). Initial requirements (like intelligence) are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement (intelligence), then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour.\n**Secondly are the subcomponents \u2013 general thematic areas \u2013 that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit (e.g. a zoo or a water park), these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative (e.g. poetry).\n**Thirdly, there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit e.g. waterpark, you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, there are many different types (e.g. free verse, riddles, sonnet, etc.) that have to be selected from.\n**Lastly, there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark.\n\n=== Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs ===\nThis possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.\n\n''Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs''\n\n*Renzulli's Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Renzulli | first1 = J.

Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins<ref>Perkins, D. N. (1981) The mind\u2019s best work. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> referred to this as the \u2018nothing-special\u2019 view.\n\nWeisberg & Alba<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weisberg | first1 = R.

The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.\n\n=== Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets ===\nIn this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.\n\nGetzels and Jackson<ref name=\"Getzels, J. W. 1962\" /> administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered (by the school) IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was ''r'' = .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.\n\nHowever, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan<ref name=\"Wallach, M. A. 1965\" /> highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McNemar | first1 = O | year = 1964 | title = Lost: Our Intelligence?

A. 1965\" /> administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity). Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average ''r'' = .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average ''r'' = .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated ''r'' = .09.\n\n== Neuroscience ==\nThe [[neuroscience]] of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour. It has been addressed<ref name=\"NeuroPsychiatry\">[http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf Kenneth M Heilman, MD, Stephen E. Nadeau, MD, and David Q. Beversdorf, MD. \"Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms\" Neurocase (2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319130652/http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf |date=2009-03-19 }}</ref> in the article \"Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms.\" The authors write that \"creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected.\" Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:\n* they have a high level of specialized knowledge,\n* they are capable of [[divergent thinking]] mediated by the [[frontal lobe]].\n* and they are able to modulate [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[norepinephrine]] in their frontal lobe.\n\nThus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] that is most important for creativity.\n\nThis article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, [[mood disorder|mood]] and [[substance dependence|addiction disorders]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].\n\nIn 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the [[temporal lobe]]s, and [[dopamine]] from the [[limbic system]]. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general [[arousal]] and goal directed behaviors and reduce [[latent inhibition]], and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Flaherty AW | year = 2005 | title = Frontotemporal and dopaminergic control of idea generation and creative drive | url = | journal = J Comp Neurol | volume = 493 | issue = 1| pages = 147\u201353 | pmid = 16254989 | pmc = 2571074 | doi=10.1002/cne.20768}}</ref>  A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other [[default mode network]] functions.<ref name=PMID_26003860>{{ cite journal |last1 = Mayseless |first1 = Naama |last2 = Eran |first2 = Ayelet |last3 = Shamay-Tsoory |first3 = Simone G |year = 2015 |title = Generating original ideas: The neural underpinning of originality. |journal = NeuroImage |quote = These results are in line with the dual model of creativity, according to which original ideas are a product of the interaction between a system that generates ideas and a control system that evaluates these ideas. |lay-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26003860 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.030|pmid = 26003860 |pages = 232\u20139 |volume = 116 }}</ref>\n\n=== Working memory and the cerebellum ===\nVandervert<ref>Vandervert 2003a, 2003b; Vandervert, Schimpf & Liu, 2007</ref> described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the [[cerebellum]] collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of [[working memory]] (responsible for processing all thought<ref>Miyake & Shah, 1999</ref>) are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum.<ref>Schmahmann, 1997, 2004</ref> The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain<ref>Andersen, Korbo & Pakkenberg, 1992.</ref>) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes<ref>Miller & Cohen, 2001</ref> where creative and innovative thoughts arise.<ref>Vandervert, 2003a</ref> (Apparently, creative insight or the \"aha\" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.<ref>Jung-Beeman, Bowden, Haberman, Frymiare, Arambel-Liu, Greenblatt, Reber & Kounios, 2004</ref>)\n\nAccording to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in \"forward\" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC).<ref>Imamizu, Kuroda, Miyauchi, Yoshioka & Kawato, 2003</ref> New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion,<ref>Schmahmann, 2004,</ref> Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the [[child prodigy]], and thought in general.\n\nEssentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem.<ref>Vandervert, in press-a</ref> Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans.<ref>Vandervert, 2011, in press-b</ref> Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology.<ref>Vandervert & Vandervert-Weathers, 2013</ref> Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive \"mental prototyping\" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the [[Khan Academy]]. The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On Vandervert et al. \"Working memory cerebellum, and creativity\" | url = | journal = Creat.

Isen|Alice Isen]], positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:\n# Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association;\n# Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem;\n# Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity.\n\n[[Barbara Fredrickson]] in her [[broaden-and-build]] model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.\n\nAccording to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).\n\nVarious meta-analyses, such as Baas et al.

Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own [[sensory system|sensory]] inputs. The agent can use a [[black box]] optimization method such as [[reinforcement learning]] to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future [[reward system|reward]] signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhuber's [[Loss function|objective function]] to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model \"wow-effects.\" This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an [[artificial neural network]] or some other [[machine learning]] device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present \"wow-effect\" due to sudden improvements in [[data compression]] or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the [[action selector]]. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are \"boring\" by nature (providing no reward). Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.\n\nAccording to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and [[comedian]]s.<ref>Video of [[J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber]]'s keynote at the 2011 Winter Intelligence Conference, Oxford: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnbZzcruGu0 Universal AI and Theory of Fun and Creativity.

[[bipolar disorder]]) and [[Major depressive disorder|depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[Major depressive disorder|unipolar disorder]]). In ''Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament'', [[Kay Redfield Jamison]] summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in [[writer]]s, [[poet]]s, and [[artist]]s. She also explores research that identifies [[mood disorder]]s in such famous writers and artists as [[Ernest Hemingway]] (who shot himself after [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroconvulsive treatment]]), [[Virginia Woolf]] (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer [[Robert Schumann]] (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed [[Visual arts|visual artist]] [[Michelangelo]]. \n\nA study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no overall overrepresentation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kyaga | first1 = S. | last2 = Lichtenstein | first2 = P. | last3 = Boman | first3 = M. | last4 = Hultman | first4 = C. | last5 = L\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m | first5 = N. | last6 = Land\u00e9n | first6 = M. | title = Creativity and mental disorder: Family study of 300 000 people with severe mental disorder | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.085316 | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 199 | issue = 5 | pages = 373\u2013379 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21653945| pmc = }}</ref>\n\nAnother study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses.

A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are four \"Creativity Profiles\" that can help produce growth, innovation, speed, etc.<ref>(DeGraff, Lawrence 2002)</ref>\n:(i) ''Incubate'' (Long-term Development)\n:(ii) ''Imagine'' (Breakthrough Ideas)\n:(iii) ''Improve'' (Incremental Adjustments)\n:(iv) ''Invest'' (Short-term Goals)\n\nResearch by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at [[Manchester Business School]] has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each\n\n: (i) \"Idea Generation\" (Fluency, Originality, Incubation and Illumination)\n: (ii) \"Personality\" (Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity)\n: (iii) \"Motivation\" (Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Achievement)\n: (iv) \"Confidence\" (Producing, Sharing and Implementing)\n\nThis model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling.<ref>(Batey & Irwing, 2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710161255/http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |archivedate=2011-07-10 }}</ref>\n\nAn important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Nijstad B. A. |author2=De Dreu C. K. | year = 2002 | title = Creativity and Group Innovation | url = | journal = Applied Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 400\u2013406 | doi = 10.1111/1464-0597.00984 }}</ref>\n\nOne characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is what is called ''divergent production''. ''Divergent production'' is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation.<ref>(Guilford, 1950)</ref> One way of measuring ''divergent production'' is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking.<ref>(Torrance, 1974, 1984)</ref> The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.\n\nOther researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.<ref>(Christiaans & Venselaar, 2007)</ref>\n\nThe aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.<ref>(Amabile, 1996; Prabhu et al., 2008)</ref>\n\nFrom a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people.<ref>(Feist, 1998, 1999; Prabhu et al., 2008; Zhang & Sternberg, 2009)</ref> Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity.\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society.<ref>(Campbell, 1960)</ref>\n\nIn studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.<ref>(Gardner, 1993a, Policastro & Gardner, 1999)</ref>\n\nAnother theory of creative people is the ''investment theory of creativity''. This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the ''investment'' sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This ''investment theory of creativity'' views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.<ref>(Sternberg & Lubart, 1991, 1995, 1996)</ref>\n\n== Malevolent creativity ==\n{{Main|Malevolent creativity}}\nSo called ''malevolent creativity'' is associated with the \"dark side\" of creativity.<ref name=\"The dark side of creativity\">{{cite journal | last1 = McLaren | first1 = R.

Malevolent creativity should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas malevolent creativity is explicitly malevolently motivated. While it is often associated with criminal behaviour, it can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying, cheating and betrayal.<ref name=\"Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016\">{{cite journal | last1 = Hao | first1 = N | last2 = Tang | first2 = M | last3 = Yang | first3 = J | last4 = Wang | first4 = Q | last5 = Runco | first5 = MA | year = 2016 | title = A New Tool to Measure Malevolent Creativity: The Malevolent Creativity Behavior Scale | url = | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 682 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00682 | pmid = 27242596 | pmc = 4870273 }}</ref>\n\n===Crime===\nMalevolent creativity is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism. As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, and studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.<ref>Aggression: A social psychological analysis.\nBerkowitz, Leonard\nNew York, NY, US: McGraw-Hill Aggression: A social psychological analysis. (1962). xv 361 pp</ref>\n\n===Predictive factors===\nAlthough everyone shows some levels of malevolent creativity under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards it have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. While malevolent creativity appears to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions, personality, particularly aggressiveness, is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researchers Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of malevolent creativity, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving.  The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with malevolent creativity.<ref name=\"The dark side of creativity\"/> Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those high in implicit aggression, even if they were high in impulsiveness, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression controlled an individual's expression of malevolent creativity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = D.

The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity.]]\n\nIt has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself \u2014 how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.\n\nAmabile<ref name=\"Amabile98\">(Amabile, 1998; Sullivan and Harper, 2009)</ref> argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed:\n* Expertise (technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge),\n* Creative thinking skills (how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems),\n* and Motivation (especially [[intrinsic motivation]]).\n\nThere are two types of motivation:\n* [[Motivation|extrinsic motivation]] \u2013 [[Externality|external]] factors, for example [[threat]]s of being fired or money as a reward,\n* [[intrinsic motivation]] \u2013 comes from inside an individual, satisfaction, enjoyment of work, etc.\n\nSix managerial practices to encourage motivation are:\n* Challenge \u2013 matching people with the right assignments;\n* Freedom \u2013 giving people [[autonomy]] choosing means to achieve goals;\n* [[Resource]]s \u2013 such as time, money, space, etc. There must be balance fit among resources and people;\n* Work group features \u2013 [[Cultural diversity|diverse]], supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help, and recognize each other's talents;\n* [[Supervisor]]y encouragement \u2013 recognitions, cheering, praising;\n* Organizational support \u2013 value emphasis, information sharing, [[collaboration]].\n\nNonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations.<ref name=\"Nonaka91\">(Nonaka, 1991)</ref> In particular, he emphasized the role that [[tacit knowledge]] has to play in the creative process.\n\nIn business, [[originality]] is not enough.

It is essential for innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Mart\u00edn, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear.<ref>Leal, S. y Urrea J. \"Ingenio y Pasi\u00f3n\" (2013), Lid Publishers (Spanish) and Forbes India Magazine http://forbesindia.com/article/ie/new-trends-in-innovation-management/33905/1#ixzz2iiuuDxVq</ref>\n\nSimilarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture, as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | last1 = Woodman | first1 = R.

There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses (e.g. Burton-Jones, 1999; Drucker, 1999), economics (e.g. Cortada, 1998; Reich, 2001; Florida, 2003), education (e.g. Farrell and Fenwick, 2007; Brown, Lauder and Ashton, 2011), human resource management (e.g. Davenport, 2005), knowledge and organizational management (Alvesson, 2004; Defillippi, Arthur and Lindsay, 2006; Orr, Nutley, Russell, Bain, Hacking and Moran, 2016), sociology, psychology, and knowledge economy-related sectors \u2013 especially information technology (IT) software (e.g. O\u2019Riain, 2004; Nerland, 2008) and advertising (e.g. Grabher, 2004; Lury, 2004) (Loo, 2017).\n\nLoo (2017) studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors. It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England, Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives. Specifically, the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting (in advertising), and systems software developing and software programme managing.\n\nThe study offers a conceptual framework (Loo, 2017, p.&nbsp;49) of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles, and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics (e.g. Reich, 2001; Quah, 2002), management (e.g. ,Drucker, 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; von Hippel, 2006), sociology (e.g. Zuboff, 1988; Bell, 1973; Lash and Urry, 1994; Castells, 2000; Knorr Cetina, 2005),  and psychology (e.g. Gardner, 1984; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Sternberg, Kaufman and Pretz, 2004). The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work.  These workers apply their cognitive abilities, creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science, technology, or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities \u2013 e.g. a medium, product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education, training and \u2018encultured environments\u2019 are necessary for the performance of these creative activities. Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person, seeking novelty when reviewing a situation (Gardner, 1993), and creating something that is different and novel, i.e. a \u2018variation\u2019 on the idea of existing ideas in a domain (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives.\n\nThis investigation identifies a definition of creative work, three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example, for a creative director in the advertising industry, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens, and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector, and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition to the creative applications, creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for one's job is generic. For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities (e.g. literature), the creative arts (e.g. painting and music) and technical-related know-how (e.g. mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences). In the IT software, technical knowledge of computer languages (e.g. C++) is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager, as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers.\n\nThere are three types of work. One is intra-sectoral (e.g. \u2018general sponge\u2019 and \u2019in tune with the zeitgeist\u2019 [advertising], and \u2018power of expression\u2019 and \u2018sensitivity\u2019 [IT software]). The second is inter-sectoral (e.g. \u2018integration of advertising activities\u2019 [advertising], and \u2018autonomous decentralized systems\u2019 [ADS] [IT software]). The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors (e.g. \u2018three-dimensional trust\u2019 and \u2018green credentials\u2019 [advertising], and \u2018collaboration with HEIs and industry\u2019 and \u2018ADS system in the Tokyo train operator\u2019 [IT software]).\n\nThe necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information, communications and electronic technologies (ICET) infrastructure, training, work environment and education.\n\nThis investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities, arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure, delivery approaches and assessments. At a macro level, governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities, outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising. This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working, offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development (formally and informally), and foster an environment, which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation.\n\n=== Team composition ===\nDiversity between team members\u2019 backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = A different perspective: The multiple effects of deep level diversity on group creativity | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 5| pages = 822\u2013832 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.04.004}}</ref> Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal | last1 = Paletz | first1 = S.

Some economists (such as [[Paul Romer]]) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and creative products are protected by [[intellectual property]] laws.\n\n[[Mark A. Runco]] and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a \"[[Behavioral economics|psychoeconomic]]\" model of creativity.<ref name=\"RubRunc1992\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90021-Q|last=Rubenson|first=Daniel L.|author2=Runco, Mark |authorlink2=Mark A.

In his 2002 book, ''The Rise of the Creative Class'', [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]] popularized the notion that regions with \"3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance\" also have high concentrations of [[creative professional]]s and tend to have a higher level of economic development.\n\n==Fostering creativity==\n{{Main|Creativity techniques}}\n\nSeveral different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the [[Psychology|psychological]]-cognitive, such as [[Alex Faickney Osborn|Osborn]]-[[Sid Parnes|Parnes]] [[Creative problem-solving|Creative Problem Solving Process]], [[Synectics]], science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and [[Edward de Bono]]'s [[lateral thinking]]; to the highly structured, such as [[TRIZ]] (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist [[Genrich Altshuller]]), and Computer-Aided [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]].\n\nDaniel Pink, in his 2005 book ''A Whole New Mind'', repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this ''conceptual age'', we will need to foster and encourage ''right-directed thinking'' (representing creativity and emotion) over ''left-directed thinking'' (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/lives-the-brain/201004/creativity-the-brain-and-evolution|title=Creativity, the Brain, and Evolution|website=Psychology Today}}</ref>\n\nNickerson<ref name=\"Nickerson99handbook\">{{cite book|last=Nickerson|first=R.

The created item may be intangible (such as an [[idea]], a [[scientific theory]], a [[musical composition]], or a [[joke]]) or a physical object (such as an [[invention]], a printed [[Literature|literary work]], or a [[painting]]).\n\nScholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines, primarily [[psychology]], [[business studies]], and [[cognitive science]], but also [[education]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], [[philosophy]] (particularly [[philosophy of science]]), [[theology]], [[sociology]], [[linguistics]],  and [[economics]], covering  the relations between creativity and general [[intelligence]], personality type, mental and neural processes, mental health, or [[artificial intelligence]]; the potential for fostering creativity through education and training; the fostering of creativity for national economic benefit, and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe English word ''creativity'' comes from the [[Latin]] term ''creare,'' \"to create, make\": its [[Morphological derivation|derivational suffixes]] also come from Latin. The word \"create\" appeared in English as early as the 14th century, notably in Chaucer, to indicate divine creation<ref name=\"RuncoAlbert\">{{cite book|last=Runco|first=Mark A.|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9|author2=Albert, Robert S.|editor=[[James C.

The dominant factors are usually identified as \"the four Ps\" \u2014 process, product, person, and place (according to [[James Melvin Rhodes|Mel Rhodes]]).<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 20342603|title = An Analysis of Creativity|journal = The Phi Delta Kappan|volume = 42|issue = 7|pages = 305\u2013310|last1 = Rhodes|first1 = Mel|year = 1961}}</ref> A focus on ''process'' is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as [[J. P. Guilford|Guilford]]), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]) are primarily theories of creative process.

In his work ''Art of Thought'', published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:\n:(i) ''[[Preparation (principle)|preparation]]'' (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),\n:(ii) ''incubation'' (where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening),\n:(iii) ''intimation'' (the creative person gets a \"feeling\" that a solution is on its way),\n:(iv) ''illumination'' or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its [[preconscious]] processing into conscious awareness);\n:(v) ''verification'' (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).\nWallas' model is often treated as four stages, with \"intimation\" seen as a sub-stage.\n\nWallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the [[evolution]]ary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments.

This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]]).\n\nThe EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely:\n# The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge; \n# The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks; \n# The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge; \n# The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing;\n# The iterative (and possibly bidirectional) processing. \nA computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION cognitive architecture]] and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.\n\n=== Conceptual blending ===\n{{Main|Conceptual blending}}\nIn ''[[The Act of Creation]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]] introduced the concept of ''bisociation'' \u2014 that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference.<ref name=\"Koestler64\">{{cite book |author=Koestler, A. |title=The Act of Creation |year=1964 |authorlink=Arthur Koestler |isbn=978-0-330-73116-4 |publisher=Pan Books |location=London}}</ref> This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with [[metaphor]], [[analogy]], and [[structure mapping]] have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label [[conceptual blending]].\n\n=== Honing theory ===\nHoning theory, developed principally by psychologist [[Liane Gabora]], posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.\n\nA central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state.<ref>Gabora, L. & Saab, A. (2011). Creative interference and states of potentiality in analogy problem solving. ''Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society''. July 20\u201323, 2011, Boston MA.</ref> Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly \u2018mutating\u2019 predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel \u2018half-baked\u2019. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.\n\nHoning theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even though in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.\n\n=== Everyday imaginative thought ===\nIn everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think \"if only...\".<ref>Roese, N. J. & Olson, J. M. (1995). ''What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking''. Mahwah, New Jersey: Erlbaum</ref> Their [[counterfactual thinking]] is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes.<ref>Markman, K. Klein, W. & Suhr, E. (eds) (2009).

P. Guilford]]'s group,<ref name=\"Guilford67\" /> which pioneered the modern [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:\n* Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.\n* Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.\n* Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.\n* Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.\n* Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)\n* Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events (e.g. loss of gravity)\n\nOriginally, Guilford was trying to create a model for intellect as a whole, but in doing so also created a model for creativity. Guilford made an important assumption for creative research: creativity isn't one abstract concept. \u00a0The idea that creativity is a category rather than one single concept opened up the ability for other researchers to look at creativity with a whole new perspective.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|last2=Grigorenko|first2=Elena L.|date=8 June 2010|title=Guilford's Structure of Intellect Model and Model of Creativity: Contributions and Limitations|journal= Creativity Research Journal|volume=13|issue=3\u20134|pages=309\u2013316|doi=10.1207/s15326934crj1334_08|issn=1040-0419}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guilford|first=J.

Ideational fluency, or the ability rapidly to produce a variety of ideas that fulfill stated requirements;\n#: b. Associational fluency, or the ability to generate a list of words, each of which is associated with a given word; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n#: c.

Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual \u2018sells high\u2019 by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.\n*Amabile's Componential Model of Creativity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Amabile | first1 = T.

The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels, intelligence plays a key role:\n**To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements (e.g., time/transport to go to the park). Initial requirements (like intelligence) are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement (intelligence), then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour.\n**Secondly are the subcomponents \u2013 general thematic areas \u2013 that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit (e.g. a zoo or a water park), these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative (e.g. poetry).\n**Thirdly, there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit e.g. waterpark, you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, there are many different types (e.g. free verse, riddles, sonnet, etc.) that have to be selected from.\n**Lastly, there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark.\n\n=== Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs ===\nThis possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.\n\n''Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs''\n\n*Renzulli's Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Renzulli | first1 = J.

Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins<ref>Perkins, D. N. (1981) The mind\u2019s best work. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> referred to this as the \u2018nothing-special\u2019 view.\n\nWeisberg & Alba<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weisberg | first1 = R.

The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.\n\n=== Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets ===\nIn this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.\n\nGetzels and Jackson<ref name=\"Getzels, J. W. 1962\" /> administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered (by the school) IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was ''r'' = .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.\n\nHowever, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan<ref name=\"Wallach, M. A. 1965\" /> highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills.

A. 1965\" /> administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity). Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average ''r'' = .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average ''r'' = .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated ''r'' = .09.\n\n== Neuroscience ==\nThe [[neuroscience]] of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour. It has been addressed<ref name=\"NeuroPsychiatry\">[http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf Kenneth M Heilman, MD, Stephen E. Nadeau, MD, and David Q. Beversdorf, MD. \"Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms\" Neurocase (2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319130652/http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf |date=2009-03-19 }}</ref> in the article \"Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms.\" The authors write that \"creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected.\" Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:\n* they have a high level of specialized knowledge,\n* they are capable of [[convergent and divergent production|divergent thinking]] mediated by the [[frontal lobe]].\n* and they are able to modulate [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[norepinephrine]] in their frontal lobe.\n\nThus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] that is most important for creativity.\n\nThis article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, [[mood disorder|mood]] and [[substance dependence|addiction disorders]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].\n\nIn 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the [[temporal lobe]]s, and [[dopamine]] from the [[limbic system]]. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general [[arousal]] and goal directed behaviors and reduce [[latent inhibition]], and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Flaherty AW | year = 2005 | title = Frontotemporal and dopaminergic control of idea generation and creative drive | url = | journal = J Comp Neurol | volume = 493 | issue = 1| pages = 147\u201353 | pmid = 16254989 | pmc = 2571074 | doi=10.1002/cne.20768}}</ref>  A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other [[default mode network]] functions.<ref name=PMID_26003860>{{ cite journal |last1 = Mayseless |first1 = Naama |last2 = Eran |first2 = Ayelet |last3 = Shamay-Tsoory |first3 = Simone G |year = 2015 |title = Generating original ideas: The neural underpinning of originality. |journal = NeuroImage |quote = These results are in line with the dual model of creativity, according to which original ideas are a product of the interaction between a system that generates ideas and a control system that evaluates these ideas. |lay-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26003860 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.030|pmid = 26003860 |pages = 232\u20139 |volume = 116 }}</ref>\n\n=== Working memory and the cerebellum ===\nVandervert<ref>Vandervert 2003a, 2003b; Vandervert, Schimpf & Liu, 2007</ref> described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the [[cerebellum]] collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of [[working memory]] (responsible for processing all thought<ref>Miyake & Shah, 1999</ref>) are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum.<ref>Schmahmann, 1997, 2004</ref> The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain<ref>Andersen, Korbo & Pakkenberg, 1992.</ref>) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes<ref>Miller & Cohen, 2001</ref> where creative and innovative thoughts arise.<ref>Vandervert, 2003a</ref> (Apparently, creative insight or the \"aha\" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.<ref>Jung-Beeman, Bowden, Haberman, Frymiare, Arambel-Liu, Greenblatt, Reber & Kounios, 2004</ref>)\n\nAccording to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in \"forward\" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC).<ref>Imamizu, Kuroda, Miyauchi, Yoshioka & Kawato, 2003</ref> New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion,<ref>Schmahmann, 2004,</ref> Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the [[child prodigy]], and thought in general.\n\nEssentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem.<ref>Vandervert, in press-a</ref> Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans.<ref>Vandervert, 2011, in press-b</ref> Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology.<ref>Vandervert & Vandervert-Weathers, 2013</ref> Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive \"mental prototyping\" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the [[Khan Academy]]. The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On Vandervert et al. \"Working memory cerebellum, and creativity\" | url = | journal = Creat.

As noted in [[voting behavior]], the term \"affect\" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making.<ref name=Winkielman2007>{{Citation\n | title = Affective Influence on Judgments and Decisions: Moving Towards Core Mechanisms\n | last1 = Winkielman | first1 = P.\n | last2 = Knutson | first2 = B.\n | year = 2007\n | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 11 | number = 2 | pages = 179\u2013192 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.11.2.179\n | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/05cae5c1d17492926fd1951a3e1d1bfe4046687a }}</ref>\n\n=== Positive affect relations ===\nAccording to [[Alice M. Isen|Alice Isen]], positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:\n# Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association;\n# Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem;\n# Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity.\n\n[[Barbara Fredrickson]] in her [[broaden-and-build]] model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.\n\nAccording to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).\n\nVarious meta-analyses, such as Baas et al. (2008) of 66 studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mark A.

Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own [[sensory system|sensory]] inputs. The agent can use a [[black box]] optimization method such as [[reinforcement learning]] to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future [[reward system|reward]] signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhuber's [[Loss function|objective function]] to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model \"wow-effects.\" This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an [[artificial neural network]] or some other [[machine learning]] device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present \"wow-effect\" due to sudden improvements in [[data compression]] or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the [[action selector]]. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are \"boring\" by nature (providing no reward). Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.\n\nAccording to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and [[comedian]]s.<ref>Video of [[J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber]]'s keynote at the 2011 Winter Intelligence Conference, Oxford: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnbZzcruGu0 Universal AI and Theory of Fun and Creativity.

[[bipolar disorder]]) and [[Major depressive disorder|depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[Major depressive disorder|unipolar disorder]]). In ''Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament'', [[Kay Redfield Jamison]] summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in [[writer]]s, [[poet]]s, and [[artist]]s. She also explores research that identifies [[mood disorder]]s in such famous writers and artists as [[Ernest Hemingway]] (who shot himself after [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroconvulsive treatment]]), [[Virginia Woolf]] (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer [[Robert Schumann]] (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed [[Visual arts|visual artist]] [[Michelangelo]]. \n\nA study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no overall overrepresentation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kyaga | first1 = S. | last2 = Lichtenstein | first2 = P. | last3 = Boman | first3 = M. | last4 = Hultman | first4 = C. | last5 = L\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m | first5 = N. | last6 = Land\u00e9n | first6 = M. | title = Creativity and mental disorder: Family study of 300 000 people with severe mental disorder | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.085316 | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 199 | issue = 5 | pages = 373\u2013379 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21653945| pmc = }}</ref>\n\nAnother study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses.

A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are four \"Creativity Profiles\" that can help produce growth, innovation, speed, etc.<ref>(DeGraff, Lawrence 2002)</ref>\n:(i) ''Incubate'' (Long-term Development)\n:(ii) ''Imagine'' (Breakthrough Ideas)\n:(iii) ''Improve'' (Incremental Adjustments)\n:(iv) ''Invest'' (Short-term Goals)\n\nResearch by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at [[Manchester Business School]] has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each\n\n: (i) \"Idea Generation\" (Fluency, Originality, Incubation and Illumination)\n: (ii) \"Personality\" (Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity)\n: (iii) \"Motivation\" (Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Achievement)\n: (iv) \"Confidence\" (Producing, Sharing and Implementing)\n\nThis model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling.<ref>(Batey & Irwing, 2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710161255/http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |archivedate=2011-07-10 }}</ref>\n\nAn important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Nijstad B. A. |author2=De Dreu C. K. | year = 2002 | title = Creativity and Group Innovation | url = | journal = Applied Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 400\u2013406 | doi = 10.1111/1464-0597.00984 }}</ref>\n\nOne characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is what is called ''divergent production''. ''Divergent production'' is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation.<ref>(Guilford, 1950)</ref> One way of measuring ''divergent production'' is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking.<ref>(Torrance, 1974, 1984)</ref> The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.\n\nOther researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.<ref>(Christiaans & Venselaar, 2007)</ref>\n\nThe aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.<ref>(Amabile, 1996; Prabhu et al., 2008)</ref>\n\nFrom a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people.<ref>(Feist, 1998, 1999; Prabhu et al., 2008; Zhang & Sternberg, 2009)</ref> Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity.\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society.<ref>(Campbell, 1960)</ref>\n\nIn studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.<ref>(Gardner, 1993a, Policastro & Gardner, 1999)</ref>\n\nAnother theory of creative people is the ''investment theory of creativity''. This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the ''investment'' sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This ''investment theory of creativity'' views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.<ref>(Sternberg & Lubart, 1991, 1995, 1996)</ref>\n\n== Malevolent creativity ==\n{{Main|Malevolent creativity}}\nSo called ''malevolent creativity'' is associated with the \"dark side\" of creativity.<ref name=\"The dark side of creativity\">{{cite journal | last1 = McLaren | first1 = R.

Malevolent creativity should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas malevolent creativity is explicitly malevolently motivated. While it is often associated with criminal behaviour, it can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying, cheating and betrayal.<ref name=\"Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016\">{{cite journal | last1 = Hao | first1 = N | last2 = Tang | first2 = M | last3 = Yang | first3 = J | last4 = Wang | first4 = Q | last5 = Runco | first5 = MA | year = 2016 | title = A New Tool to Measure Malevolent Creativity: The Malevolent Creativity Behavior Scale | url = | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 682 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00682 | pmid = 27242596 | pmc = 4870273 }}</ref>\n\n===Crime===\nMalevolent creativity is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism. As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, and studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.<ref>Aggression: A social psychological analysis.\nBerkowitz, Leonard\nNew York, NY, US: McGraw-Hill Aggression: A social psychological analysis. (1962). xv 361 pp</ref>\n\n===Predictive factors===\nAlthough everyone shows some levels of malevolent creativity under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards it have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. While malevolent creativity appears to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions, personality, particularly aggressiveness, is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researchers Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of malevolent creativity, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving.  The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with malevolent creativity.<ref name=\"The dark side of creativity\"/> Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those high in implicit aggression, even if they were high in impulsiveness, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression controlled an individual's expression of malevolent creativity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = D.

The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity.]]\n\nIt has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself \u2014 how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.\n\nAmabile<ref name=\"Amabile98\">(Amabile, 1998; Sullivan and Harper, 2009)</ref> argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed:\n* Expertise (technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge),\n* Creative thinking skills (how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems),\n* and Motivation (especially [[intrinsic motivation]]).\n\nThere are two types of motivation:\n* [[Motivation|extrinsic motivation]] \u2013 [[Externality|external]] factors, for example [[threat]]s of being fired or money as a reward,\n* [[intrinsic motivation]] \u2013 comes from inside an individual, satisfaction, enjoyment of work, etc.\n\nSix managerial practices to encourage motivation are:\n* Challenge \u2013 matching people with the right assignments;\n* Freedom \u2013 giving people [[autonomy]] choosing means to achieve goals;\n* [[Resource]]s \u2013 such as time, money, space, etc. There must be balance fit among resources and people;\n* Work group features \u2013 [[Cultural diversity|diverse]], supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help, and recognize each other's talents;\n* [[Supervisor]]y encouragement \u2013 recognitions, cheering, praising;\n* Organizational support \u2013 value emphasis, information sharing, [[collaboration]].\n\nNonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations.<ref name=\"Nonaka91\">(Nonaka, 1991)</ref> In particular, he emphasized the role that [[tacit knowledge]] has to play in the creative process.\n\nIn business, [[originality]] is not enough. The idea must also be appropriate\u2014useful and [[Cause of action|actionable]].<ref>Amabile, T. M. (1998). \"How to kill creativity\". Harvard Business Review</ref><ref>Siltala, R. 2010.

According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to [[innovation]] process and [[competitive intelligence]] to creative workers.\n\nCreativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace. It is essential for innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Mart\u00edn, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear.<ref>Leal, S. y Urrea J. \"Ingenio y Pasi\u00f3n\" (2013), Lid Publishers (Spanish) and Forbes India Magazine http://forbesindia.com/article/ie/new-trends-in-innovation-management/33905/1#ixzz2iiuuDxVq</ref>\n\nSimilarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture, as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | last1 = Woodman | first1 = R.

(2017) Creative Working in the Knowledge Economy. Abingdon, Oxfordshire: Routledge Ltd. {{ISBN|9781138211391}}; {{ISBN|9781315453095}}. https://www.routledge.com/Creative-Working-in-the-Knowledge-Economy/Loo/p/book/9781138211391</ref> on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page. It offers connections with the sections on the \u2018\u201dFour C\u201d model\u2019, \u2018Theories of creative processes\u2019, \u2018Creativity as a subset of intelligence\u2019, \u2018Creativity and personality\u2019, and \u2018In organisations\u2019 It is the last section that the investigation addresses.\n\nResearch studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels: macro, meso and micro. Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension. Meso studies focus on organisations. Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses (e.g. Burton-Jones, 1999; Drucker, 1999), economics (e.g. Cortada, 1998; Reich, 2001; Florida, 2003), education (e.g. Farrell and Fenwick, 2007; Brown, Lauder and Ashton, 2011), human resource management (e.g. Davenport, 2005), knowledge and organizational management (Alvesson, 2004; Defillippi, Arthur and Lindsay, 2006; Orr, Nutley, Russell, Bain, Hacking and Moran, 2016), sociology, psychology, and knowledge economy-related sectors \u2013 especially information technology (IT) software (e.g. O\u2019Riain, 2004; Nerland, 2008) and advertising (e.g. Grabher, 2004; Lury, 2004) (Loo, 2017).\n\nLoo (2017) studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors. It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England, Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives. Specifically, the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting (in advertising), and systems software developing and software programme managing.\n\nThe study offers a conceptual framework (Loo, 2017, p.&nbsp;49) of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles, and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics (e.g. Reich, 2001; Quah, 2002), management (e.g. ,Drucker, 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; von Hippel, 2006), sociology (e.g. Zuboff, 1988; Bell, 1973; Lash and Urry, 1994; Castells, 2000; Knorr Cetina, 2005),  and psychology (e.g. Gardner, 1984; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Sternberg, Kaufman and Pretz, 2004). The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work.  These workers apply their cognitive abilities, creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science, technology, or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities \u2013 e.g. a medium, product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education, training and \u2018encultured environments\u2019 are necessary for the performance of these creative activities. Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person, seeking novelty when reviewing a situation (Gardner, 1993), and creating something that is different and novel, i.e. a \u2018variation\u2019 on the idea of existing ideas in a domain (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives.\n\nThis investigation identifies a definition of creative work, three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example, for a creative director in the advertising industry, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens, and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector, and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition to the creative applications, creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for one's job is generic. For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities (e.g. literature), the creative arts (e.g. painting and music) and technical-related know-how (e.g. mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences). In the IT software, technical knowledge of computer languages (e.g. C++) is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager, as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers.\n\nThere are three types of work. One is intra-sectoral (e.g. \u2018general sponge\u2019 and \u2019in tune with the zeitgeist\u2019 [advertising], and \u2018power of expression\u2019 and \u2018sensitivity\u2019 [IT software]). The second is inter-sectoral (e.g. \u2018integration of advertising activities\u2019 [advertising], and \u2018autonomous decentralized systems\u2019 [ADS] [IT software]). The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors (e.g. \u2018three-dimensional trust\u2019 and \u2018green credentials\u2019 [advertising], and \u2018collaboration with HEIs and industry\u2019 and \u2018ADS system in the Tokyo train operator\u2019 [IT software]).\n\nThe necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information, communications and electronic technologies (ICET) infrastructure, training, work environment and education.\n\nThis investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities, arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure, delivery approaches and assessments. At a macro level, governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities, outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising. This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working, offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development (formally and informally), and foster an environment, which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation.\n\n=== Team composition ===\nDiversity between team members\u2019 backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = A different perspective: The multiple effects of deep level diversity on group creativity | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 5| pages = 822\u2013832 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.04.004}}</ref> Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal | last1 = Paletz | first1 = S.

Some economists (such as [[Paul Romer]]) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and creative products are protected by [[intellectual property]] laws.\n\n[[Mark A. Runco]] and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a \"[[Behavioral economics|psychoeconomic]]\" model of creativity.<ref name=\"RubRunc1992\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90021-Q|last=Rubenson|first=Daniel L.|author2=Runco, Mark |authorlink2=Mark A.

In his 2002 book, ''The Rise of the Creative Class'', [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]] popularized the notion that regions with \"3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance\" also have high concentrations of [[creative professional]]s and tend to have a higher level of economic development.\n\n==Fostering creativity==\n{{Main|Creativity techniques}}\n\nSeveral different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the [[Psychology|psychological]]-cognitive, such as [[Alex Faickney Osborn|Osborn]]-[[Sid Parnes|Parnes]] [[Creative problem-solving|Creative Problem Solving Process]], [[Synectics]], science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and [[Edward de Bono]]'s [[lateral thinking]]; to the highly structured, such as [[TRIZ]] (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist [[Genrich Altshuller]]), and Computer-Aided [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]].\n\nDaniel Pink, in his 2005 book ''A Whole New Mind'', repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this ''conceptual age'', we will need to foster and encourage ''right-directed thinking'' (representing creativity and emotion) over ''left-directed thinking'' (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/lives-the-brain/201004/creativity-the-brain-and-evolution|title=Creativity, the Brain, and Evolution|website=Psychology Today}}</ref>\n\nNickerson<ref name=\"Nickerson99handbook\">{{cite book|last=Nickerson|first=R.
