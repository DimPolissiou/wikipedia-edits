The aim of the service was to \"top up\" [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] customers by providing additional content and services through encrypted TV channels unavailable to other viewers.\n\nThe service offered a variety of content from various providers through 'TV Favourites', and old and low-budget movies from [[NBCUniversal]] through [[PictureBox Films|PictureBox Movies]], all of which could be viewed [[Video on demand|on demand]]. Top Up TV formerly offered live premium sports channels including [[ESPN (UK)|ESPN]], [[Sky Sports|Sky Sports 1]] and [[Sky Sports|Sky Sports 2]]. The service could be received by equipment having a built-in [[Conditional-access module|card slot]]: a [[DVB-T]] [[set-top box]], a [[Digital video recorder|recorder]] or an [[Integrated digital television|integrated television receiver]].\n\nAs of July 2013, there were approximately 200,000 subscribers.\n\nAt the end of 2013, Top Up TV ceased broadcasting and sold its subscriber business to [[BSkyB|Sky]].\n\n==TV Favourites==\nLaunched in December 2006 as Top Up TV Anytime, the service offered [[video on demand]] content from many channels. In 2009, Top Up TV Anytime was rebranded as TV Favourites, as Top Up TV no longer needed the Anytime brand to differentiate its on-demand service from its previous linear service. The service was only accessible through a Top Up TV DVB-T DVR set top box. Content was available by pressing the Top Up TV button on the remote whilst watching a TV channel or perusing the EPG. Over time, channels like [[Sky Living|Living]] and [[Home (TV channel)|Home]] were phased out, replaced by programmes from the [[BBC]], [[Warner Bros. Television]] and [[The Walt Disney Company]]. The channel icons displayed on the Top Up TV EPG changed from being the logo of their respective channel in favour of a uniform genre list.\n\nProviders that were available at the time were:\n\n'''Comedy/Drama'''\n*[[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]]\n*[[American Broadcasting Company|United States drama from ABC]]\n\n'''Factual'''\n*[[Crime & Investigation Network (Europe)|Crime & Investigation Network]]\n*[[History (European TV channel)|History Channel]]\n*[[Home (TV channel)|Home]]\n\n==PictureBox==\n{{Main|PictureBox Films}}\nPictureBox was a movies service in which around 28 old and low-budget movies were downloaded to the subscriber's Top Up TV [[Freeview+]] box every night for a monthly fee. Movies offered were from the [[NBCUniversal]] library. Seven films were available at any one time, with titles being refreshed nightly. The service launched in October 2006 and was the first premium add-on available to Top Up TV customers. Top Up TV was the first platform in the world to host the service along with its TV programmes spin-off, TV Box.\n\n==Discontinued channels and services==\n'''Entertainment, factual and comedy'''\n*[[Animal Planet (UK TV channel)|Animal Planet]] \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV]] \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[Comedy Central (UK and Ireland)|Paramount Comedy]] \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[Syfy (UK and Ireland)|Syfy]] \u2013 On-demand content\n*Life and Times \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[Universal Channel (UK and Ireland)|Hallmark Channel]] \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[Sky Living|Living]] \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[Discovery Channel (UK and Ireland)|Discovery Channel]] \u2013 Original channel and on-demand content\n*[[Discovery Real Time]] \u2013 Original channel and on-demand content\n*[[BBC Worldwide|BBC Programmes]] \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[CBS]] \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[Time Warner|Warner TV]] \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[NBCUniversal|TV Box (NBCUniversal)]]\n*[[National Geographic Channel (UK)]]\n\n'''News and sport'''\n*[[Bloomberg Television]] \u2013 Original live channel and on-demand content\n*[[Eurosport|British Eurosport]] \u2013 Original live channel and on-demand content\n*Sports Xtra \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[Setanta Sports 1 & 2|Setanta Sports 1]] \u2013 Premium sport channel, closed due to [[Administration (law)|administration]] and subsequently closed down\n\n'''Film'''\n*[[Turner Classic Movies (UK & Ireland)|Turner Classic Movies (TCM)]] \u2013 Original live channel and on-demand content\n\n'''Kids'''\n*[[Toonami (UK & Ireland)|Toonami]]\n*[[Boomerang (UK & Ireland)|Boomerang]]\n*[[Cartoon Network (UK and Ireland)|Cartoon Network]]\n*[[Cartoon Network Too]]\n*[[Nickelodeon (UK and Ireland)|Nickelodeon]]\n*[[Disney Channel (UK and Ireland)|Disney Channel]]\n\n===ESPN===\n{{Main|ESPN (UK)}}\nESPN was a premium sport channel offering [[Premier League]] football, among other sports, for a monthly fee. The channel could be accessed through a [[conditional-access module]] (CAM), set top box with a slot, an [[Integrated digital television|IDTV]] with a slot or through a Top Up TV Freeview+ box. It replaced [[Setanta Sports 1 & 2|Setanta Sports 1]] when its parent company went into administration and was closed. Because this channel time-shared with the downloads for the TV Favourites service, it was barred from broadcasting 24 hours a day. Between Setanta Sports 1 closing and ESPN launching, [[ESPN America]] filled airtime whilst carriage negotiations were ongoing. The channel is still offered by [[BT TV]] under their [[BT Sport]] package.\n\n===Sky Sports===\n{{Main|Sky Sports}}\nSky Sports 1 and 2 were also offered as of 2 August 2010 as [[Ofcom]]'s pay-TV review saw the channels being offered under a wholesale must offer (WMO) agreement which effectively forces [[BSkyB]] to offer these channels to its competitors. Using capacity which BT secured and used to offer the same channels to its [[Bt vision|BT Vision]] subscribers, Top Up TV also offered these two channels to its subscribers which officially launched on 2 August 2010. Top Up TV had been able to offer Sky Sports 1 & 2, and ESPN via a conditional-access module from October 2011.<ref>{{cite web |last=Love |first=Ryan |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/news/a331773/sky-sports-espn-to-become-available-on-top-up-tv-cam.html |title=Sky Sports, ESPN to become available on Top Up TV CAM |publisher=Digitalspy.co.uk |date=2011-07-26 |accessdate=2016-09-08}}</ref> This was possible only via [[CI+]] compatible IDTVs and set-top boxes.\n\n==Equipment==\nTop Up TV offered its services over a range of devices. The Top Up TV Freeview+ DTR's offered all services from Top Up TV. All Top Up TV set-top boxes and [[Conditional-access module|CAM]]'s allowed access to [[ESPN (UK)|ESPN]] whilst the CI+ CAM and approved set-top boxes allowed viewers to subscribe to [[Sky Sports]] and ESPN. A viewing smartcard (viewing card) is used to unlock customers' services. Top Up TV used the [[Nagravision]] Merlin (NagraVision 3) encryption since a card swap in 2008. Previously programmes were encrypted by MediaGuard SECA2, a more secure version of the encryption system of previous digital terrestrial incumbent [[ITV Digital]]. All Top Up TV set top boxes and DTR's were required to have at least an 8-day EPG, similar to the requirement for normal Freeview boxes.\n\n===Top Up TV Freeview+ box (DTR)===\n{{Main|Thomson DTI 6300-16}}\nA range of Top Up TV Freeview+ digital TV recorders, also known as DTRs, automatically records programmes broadcast overnight, which the user can then watch on-demand. The first generation box was manufactured by Thomson \u2013 [[Thomson DTI 6300-16]] containing a 160GB HDD. Higher capacity boxes were introduced later on with the Thomson DTI 6300\u201325, effectively the [[Thomson DTI 6300-16]] with a 250GB HDD. Different manufacturer's equipment such as Luxor, Bush, Sharp, Wharfdale and a new Thomson box were available from retailers such as Argos and ASDA. These newer boxes contain varying degrees of capacity ranging from 160GB to 500GB.\n\nIncluded in the packaging was a Top Up TV bespoke remote control and [[SCART]] lead, a signal improvement kit, an RF lead and a power cable. Printed materials include the Top Up TV welcome pack, a remote control codes guide and an instruction manual. The rear of the box had two SCART sockets, two [[tuner (television)|tuner]]s, an [[S-Video]] output, analogue [[RCA connector|phono]] output and Digital Audio output. It featured a powered but functionless [[USB]] port on the front or rear of the DTR.\n\n===Set-top box (STB)===\nInitially, Top Up TV made use of [[set-top box]]es with viewing card slots to offer a linear pay TV service. At launch, only ex-[[ITV Digital]] boxes were available, but new boxes were soon produced, bearing the \"Top Up TV Ready\" logo. Since the unavoidable move towards [[Video on demand|on demand]], the live channel hours were reduced and eventually closed.\n\nAll previous \"Top Up TV Ready\" set-top boxes with viewing card slots were later only able to receive ESPN. With the launch of Sky Sports in 2010, BSkyB insisted that the viewing [[smart card]] must be paired to the set-top box. Whilst Top Up TV Freeview+ DTR's have this facility using the CAN number, few other set-top boxes offered this facility and had to be approved by Top Up TV. These approved boxes included the i-CAN Freeview HD Box, the Top Up TV T215 and Sagem IDT68 and IDT72.\n\n===Conditional-access module (CAM)===\nA [[conditional-access module]] can be inserted into a CI slot mostly found on modern [[Integrated digital television|IDTV]]s to enable decryption of encrypted services. Whilst Top Up TV offered a branded CAM, only ESPN could be received. This is due to BSkyB having concerns with the security of these modules meaning Sky Sports 1 and Sky Sports 2 are not available.\n\nCI+ CAMs were due to become available to overcome such security concerns, offering access to Sky Sports and ESPN from August 2011, but there were delays to the launch due to Top Up TV having difficulties trying to identify compatible devices. These devices finally appeared in October 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topuptv.com/ciplus/ |title=www.topuptv.com is coming soon! |publisher=Topuptv.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-08}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe company was founded by two former [[BSkyB]] executives, David Chance and Ian West. The management team currently consists of Chance as chairman and [[Nick Markham]] as chief executive officer. Top Up TV is 20% owned by [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] and restructured during 2006, with the original company liquidated under Members Voluntary Liquidation under the name Minds1. The owner of [[Access Industries]], [[Len Blavatnik]], is said to have purchased a 70% stake in January 2007.\n\nAccording to the official Registre de Commerce et des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the accounts lodged by Top Up TV Europe S.a.r.l. in 2010 indicated costs of \u20ac38 million, debts of \u20ac23 million and ongoing losses of \u20ac21 million.\n\n===2004\u201306: Launch and early years===\nTop Up TV, as ''Newincco 166 Ltd'', attempted to make an application for the [[Multiplexing|multiplex]] licence bid for multiplex D on the DTT service in 2002 as a joint application with [[Carlton Television|Carlton]], [[Granada Television|Granada]] and [[Channel 4]], trading as the Digital Terrestrial Alliance (DTA). The company were prepared to offer a \"viable\" and \"lite-pay\" service, which would have provided a large number of [[free to air]] channels and a few pay-TV ones.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/uploads/Freeview_Plus.pdf |title=Regulator Archives |publisher=Ofcom |date= |accessdate=2016-09-08}}</ref> The bid was unsuccessful, and the licence was instead awarded to the BBC, BSkyB and [[Crown Castle]], which later became [[National Grid Wireless]].\n\nAfter the turn-down of a multiplex bid, Top Up TV turned to [[public service broadcasting|public service broadcasters]] [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] and [[Channel 4]] to gain capacity on the platform. On [[S4C Digital Networks|multiplex A]], Top Up TV were granted four long-term streams (one of which previously hosted [[TV Travel Shop]]), and on [[Digital 3&4|multiplex 2]], were granted one short-term stream from Channel 4. They came up with a time-shared system which allowed 10 pay-TV channels to be broadcast in the space of five television streams, two of which were allotted \"empty\" space, which later became [[ABC1 (United Kingdom)|ABC1]] and [[Teachers' TV]]. The sixth stream was used as a temporary measure (as of the short-term contract with Channel 4), and hosted pay-per-view channels [[Xtraview]] and [[Red Hot TV (UK)|Red Hot]].\n\nTop Up TV focused less on the premium services which were prominent of [[ITV Digital]] prior to 2002. By 2005, eleven channels were available on the service but were all timeshared. Overnight this dropped to as few as two channels (from the main package), in order to make space for premium [[sex industry|adult entertainment]] channels.\n\nFrom its launch in 2004, Alice Beer ran an Information Programme viewable by the channel placeholders and the Top Up TV Sampler channel at the time about the service. From March 2004, Top Up TV provided a package of 10 timeshared TV channels which was joined by an eleventh in 2005: [[UKTV Gold]], [[UKTV Style]], [[UKTV Food]], [[Discovery Channel (UK)|Discovery Channel]], [[Discovery Home & Leisure (UK)|Discovery Home & Leisure]], [[Turner Classic Movies (UK)|TCM]], [[E4 (channel)|E4]], [[Bloomberg Television|Bloomberg]], [[Cartoon Network (UK)|Cartoon Network]] and [[Boomerang (UK & Ireland)|Boomerang]]. On 27 May 2005, E4 left Top Up TV to become a [[free-to-air]] channel and was replaced by [[Eurosport|British Eurosport]] which began broadcasting on the platform on 1 June 2005. [[Toonami (UK)|Toonami]] also joined the line-up. Discovery Home & Leisure was rebranded Discovery Real Time. In its first year of operation, the company made losses of \u00a37 million. The original service broke even at 250,000 subscribers (according to some sources) around the Time Top Up TV Anytime was announced. This figure fell significantly short of the claimed potential subscriber numbers of 650,000 as set out in the original Freeview Plus proposal document, due to the differing market in 2004 and increasing temptation from Sky (who acquired ITV Digital's customer details) and Cable TV companies.\n\nTop Up TV provided additional services such as [[Xtraview]] which offered Top Up TV channels on a per-day basis, but closed down after Channel 4 wanted the stream back for its own use. This was replaced by Top Up TV Pay As You Go which later closed. Top Up TV Active was an interactive advertising service that replace the off-air MHEG screens on Channel 107; it also featured an audio version of QuizWorld.\n\nIn August 2005, [[Setanta Sports]] broadcast live pay-per-view [[Scottish Premier League]] matches in conjunction with Top Up TV. The service used Top Up TV's Xtraview technology. Originally this was only available to viewers in Scotland, but was made available nationwide in early 2006.\n\nSince 9 February 2007, all but two live channels on the service had been replaced with the push video-on-demand service, as the original package was slowly being phased out. However, premium sports can still be accessed on a live basis. The Xtraview access control system is still in use today for [[TelevisionX]].\n\n===2006\u201313: On-demand and premium sports===\nOn 30 August 2006, Top Up TV announced that it was to launch a new service known as Top Up TV Anytime. The new service required a Top Up TV Anytime DTR, effectively a digital terrestrial television recorder, which allows access to on demand and encrypted channels. The original service, following Anytime's launch, was later mostly phased out, being reduced to two live non-sport channels, [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]] and [[Home (TV channel)|Home]]. Existing channels of the original service at launch closed down or had their hours reduced before being phased out completely. Existing channels along with new channels such as [[Living (channel)|Living]] and [[Disney Channel (UK & Ireland)|Disney Channel]] joined the new service and began offering content on an on-demand basis. PictureBox Movies launched as a premium movies add-on in October 2006.<ref>{{cite web |last=Welsh |first=James |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a37176/top-up-announces-movies-on-demand-service.html |title=Top Up announces movies on demand service |publisher=Digitalspy.co.uk |date=2006-09-18 |accessdate=2016-09-08}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 2006, [[Inview Technology]] launched the world's first push-VOD service for Top Up TV.<ref name=Inview>{{cite web|last=Technology|first=Inview|title=History|url=http://inview.tv/about/history|work=Top Up TV|publisher=Inview Technology|accessdate=9 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212080719/http://inview.tv/about/history|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 February 2007, Top Up TV's per-per-view Scottish Premier League matches were discontinued, when the [[Setanta Sports 1 & 2|Setanta Sports]] channel was to be made available on Top Up TV by a separate subscription, until the Setanta Sports channel ceased broadcasting in June 2009 after the company went bust.\n\nIn 2009, Top Up TV Anytime was rebranded into TV Favourites, spawning PictureBox and the newly launched ESPN into viewing packs available as part of TV Favourites or available separately. Monday 2 August 2010 saw Sky Sports 1 and Sky Sports 2 launch through Top Up TV.<ref>{{cite web|last=Laughlin |first=Andrew |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a254780/sky-sports-1-2-go-live-on-top-up-tv.html |title=Sky Sports 1, 2 go live on Top Up TV |publisher=Digitalspy.co.uk |date=2010-08-02 |accessdate=2016-09-08}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, four streams were used to distribute the TV Favourites service, but the fourth stream was taken off air on 11 January 2010. The third stream was pulled from air roughly ten months later. The first stream under the name of \"Top Up TV Anytime 1\" in the EPG timeshared with ESPN, and the second stream under the name of \"Top Up TV Anytime 3\" in the EPG timeshared with Home, Gold, and Television X.\n\n===2013: Loss of sports and closure===\nIn June 2013, following the acquisition of ESPN by BT and the announcement of the removal of Sky Sports 1 & 2 from the Digital Terrestrial Television ([[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]]) network by BT, Top Up TV began sending letters to their customers stating that their premium sports package(s) would be discontinued. Sky Sports 1 & 2 were removed on 1 July, and ESPN on 1 August.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Briel |url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2013/06/05/top-up-tv-ends-sports-channels/ |title=Top Up TV ends sports channels |publisher=Broadbandtvnews.com |date=2013-06-05 |accessdate=2016-09-08}}</ref>\n\nIn September, Top Up TV sent customers on the TV Favourites and PictureBox packages letters informing them that the service would cease broadcasting on 31 October 2013 and that all remaining subscriptions will cease automatically. TUTV advised that the hardware will continue to work as a Freeview decoder. This brought the period of uncertainty about TUTV's future to an end.\n\nOn 31 October, Top Up TV placed a notice on their website stating that they had ceased broadcasting. The company sold their subscriber business to [[BSkyB|Sky]] where new subscribers to Sky could get up to 50% off for a year if they went through Top Up TV. Until June 2015, the company continued to run conditional access to the Freeview platform<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.topuptv.com/main/business.html|title=Top Up TV Technical Support Advisory Service|website=Top Up TV|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222223706/http://www.topuptv.com/main/business.html|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> which BT used to broadcast BT Sports 1 and 2.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]\n* [[YouView]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Media in the United Kingdom|television}}\n{{CATV}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Top Up Tv}}\n[[Category:Companies established in 2004]]\n[[Category:Companies disestablished in 2015]]\n[[Category:Digital television in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Pay television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=September 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2014}}\n{{Use British English|date=April 2014}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name = Top Up TV\n| logo = [[File:Top Up TV.svg|200px]]\n| type = Limited company\n| foundation = March 2004\n| defunct = June 2015\n| key_people = David Chance, [[Nick Markham]]\n| industry = Pay TV\n| products = Pay TV services programming\n| homepage = [http://www.topuptv.com www.topuptv.com]\n}}\n\n'''Top Up TV''' was a [[pay television|pay TV]] service in the United Kingdom which launched in March 2004, operating on the digital terrestrial television platform.

The channel icons displayed on the Top Up TV EPG changed from being the logo of their respective channel in favour of a uniform genre list.\n\nProviders that were available at the time were:\n\n'''Comedy/Drama'''\n*[[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]]\n*[[American Broadcasting Company|United States drama from ABC]]\n\n'''Factual'''\n*[[Crime & Investigation Network (Europe)|Crime & Investigation Network]]\n*[[History (European TV channel)|History Channel]]\n*[[Home (TV channel)|Home]]\n\n==PictureBox==\n{{Main|PictureBox Films}}\nPictureBox was a movies service in which around 28 old and low-budget movies were downloaded to the subscriber's Top Up TV [[Freeview+]] box every night for a monthly fee. Movies offered were from the [[NBCUniversal]] library. Seven films were available at any one time, with titles being refreshed nightly. The service launched in October 2006 and was the first premium add-on available to Top Up TV customers. Top Up TV was the first platform in the world to host the service along with its TV programmes spin-off, TV Box.\n\n==Discontinued channels and services==\n'''Entertainment, factual and comedy'''\n*[[Animal Planet (UK TV channel)|Animal Planet]] \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV]] \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[Comedy Central (UK and Ireland)|Paramount Comedy]] \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[Syfy (UK and Ireland)|Syfy]] \u2013 On-demand content\n*Life and Times \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[Universal Channel (UK and Ireland)|Hallmark Channel]] \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[Sky Living|Living]] \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[Discovery Channel (UK and Ireland)|Discovery Channel]] \u2013 Original channel and on-demand content\n*[[Discovery Real Time]] \u2013 Original channel and on-demand content\n*[[BBC Worldwide|BBC Programmes]] \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[CBS]] \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[Time Warner|Warner TV]] \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[NBCUniversal|TV Box (NBCUniversal)]]\n*[[National Geographic Channel (UK)]]\n\n'''News and sport'''\n*[[Bloomberg Television]] \u2013 Original live channel and on-demand content\n*[[Eurosport|British Eurosport]] \u2013 Original live channel and on-demand content\n*Sports Xtra \u2013 On-demand content\n*[[Setanta Sports 1 & 2|Setanta Sports 1]] \u2013 Premium sport channel, closed due to [[Administration (law)|administration]] and subsequently closed down\n\n'''Film'''\n*[[Turner Classic Movies (UK & Ireland)|Turner Classic Movies (TCM)]] \u2013 Original live channel and on-demand content\n\n'''Kids'''\n*[[Toonami (UK & Ireland)|Toonami]]\n*[[Boomerang (UK & Ireland)|Boomerang]]\n*[[Cartoon Network (UK and Ireland)|Cartoon Network]]\n*[[Cartoon Network Too]]\n*[[Nickelodeon (UK and Ireland)|Nickelodeon]]\n*[[Disney Channel (UK and Ireland)|Disney Channel]]\n\n===ESPN===\n{{Main|ESPN (UK)}}\nESPN was a premium sport channel offering [[Premier League]] football, among other sports, for a monthly fee. The channel could be accessed through a [[conditional-access module]] (CAM), set top box with a slot, an [[Integrated digital television|IDTV]] with a slot or through a Top Up TV Freeview+ box. It replaced [[Setanta Sports 1 & 2|Setanta Sports 1]] when its parent company went into administration and was closed. Because this channel time-shared with the downloads for the TV Favourites service, it was barred from broadcasting 24 hours a day. Between Setanta Sports 1 closing and ESPN launching, [[ESPN America]] filled airtime whilst carriage negotiations were ongoing. The channel is still offered by [[BT TV]] under their [[BT Sport]] package.\n\n===Sky Sports===\n{{Main|Sky Sports}}\nSky Sports 1 and 2 were also offered as of 2 August 2010 as [[Ofcom]]'s pay-TV review saw the channels being offered under a wholesale must offer (WMO) agreement which effectively forces [[BSkyB]] to offer these channels to its competitors. Using capacity which BT secured and used to offer the same channels to its [[Bt vision|BT Vision]] subscribers, Top Up TV also offered these two channels to its subscribers which officially launched on 2 August 2010. Top Up TV had been able to offer Sky Sports 1 & 2, and ESPN via a conditional-access module from October 2011.<ref>{{cite web |last=Love |first=Ryan |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/news/a331773/sky-sports-espn-to-become-available-on-top-up-tv-cam.html |title=Sky Sports, ESPN to become available on Top Up TV CAM |publisher=Digitalspy.co.uk |date=2011-07-26 |accessdate=2016-09-08}}</ref> This was possible only via [[CI+]] compatible IDTVs and set-top boxes.\n\n==Equipment==\nTop Up TV offered its services over a range of devices. The Top Up TV Freeview+ DTR's offered all services from Top Up TV. All Top Up TV set-top boxes and [[Conditional-access module|CAM]]'s allowed access to [[ESPN (UK)|ESPN]] whilst the CI+ CAM and approved set-top boxes allowed viewers to subscribe to [[Sky Sports]] and ESPN. A viewing smartcard (viewing card) is used to unlock customers' services. Top Up TV used the [[Nagravision]] Merlin (NagraVision 3) encryption since a card swap in 2008. Previously programmes were encrypted by MediaGuard SECA2, a more secure version of the encryption system of previous digital terrestrial incumbent [[ITV Digital]]. All Top Up TV set top boxes and DTR's were required to have at least an 8-day EPG, similar to the requirement for normal Freeview boxes.\n\n===Top Up TV Freeview+ box (DTR)===\n{{Main|Thomson DTI 6300-16}}\nA range of Top Up TV Freeview+ digital TV recorders, also known as DTRs, automatically records programmes broadcast overnight, which the user can then watch on-demand. The first generation box was manufactured by Thomson \u2013 [[Thomson DTI 6300-16]] containing a 160GB HDD. Higher capacity boxes were introduced later on with the Thomson DTI 6300-25, effectively the [[Thomson DTI 6300-16]] with a 250GB HDD. Different manufacturer's equipment such as Luxor, Bush, Sharp, Wharfdale and a new Thomson box were available from retailers such as Argos and ASDA. These newer boxes contain varying degrees of capacity ranging from 160GB to 500GB.\n\nIncluded in the packaging was a Top Up TV bespoke remote control and [[SCART]] lead, a signal improvement kit, an RF lead and a power cable. Printed materials include the Top Up TV welcome pack, a remote control codes guide and an instruction manual. The rear of the box had two SCART sockets, two [[tuner (television)|tuner]]s, an [[S-Video]] output, analogue [[RCA connector|phono]] output and Digital Audio output. It featured a powered but functionless [[USB]] port on the front or rear of the DTR.\n\n===Set-top box (STB)===\nInitially, Top Up TV made use of [[set-top box]]es with viewing card slots to offer a linear pay TV service. At launch, only ex-[[ITV Digital]] boxes were available, but new boxes were soon produced, bearing the \"Top Up TV Ready\" logo. Since the unavoidable move towards [[Video on demand|on demand]], the live channel hours were reduced and eventually closed.\n\nAll previous \"Top Up TV Ready\" set-top boxes with viewing card slots were later only able to receive ESPN. With the launch of Sky Sports in 2010, BSkyB insisted that the viewing [[smart card]] must be paired to the set-top box. Whilst Top Up TV Freeview+ DTR's have this facility using the CAN number, few other set-top boxes offered this facility and had to be approved by Top Up TV. These approved boxes included the i-CAN Freeview HD Box, the Top Up TV T215 and Sagem IDT68 and IDT72.\n\n===Conditional-access module (CAM)===\nA [[conditional-access module]] can be inserted into a CI slot mostly found on modern [[Integrated digital television|IDTV]]s to enable decryption of encrypted services. Whilst Top Up TV offered a branded CAM, only ESPN could be received. This is due to BSkyB having concerns with the security of these modules meaning Sky Sports 1 and Sky Sports 2 are not available.\n\nCI+ CAMs were due to become available to overcome such security concerns, offering access to Sky Sports and ESPN from August 2011, but there were delays to the launch due to Top Up TV having difficulties trying to identify compatible devices. These devices finally appeared in October 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topuptv.com/ciplus/ |title=www.topuptv.com is coming soon! |publisher=Topuptv.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-08}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe company was founded by two former [[BSkyB]] executives, David Chance and Ian West. The management team currently consists of Chance as chairman and [[Nick Markham]] as chief executive officer. Top Up TV is 20% owned by [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] and restructured during 2006, with the original company liquidated under Members Voluntary Liquidation under the name Minds1. The owner of [[Access Industries]], [[Len Blavatnik]], is said to have purchased a 70% stake in January 2007.\n\nAccording to the official Registre de Commerce et des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the accounts lodged by Top Up TV Europe S.a.r.l. in 2010 indicated costs of \u20ac38 million, debts of \u20ac23 million and ongoing losses of \u20ac21 million.\n\n===2004\u201306: Launch and early years===\nTop Up TV, as ''Newincco 166 Ltd'', attempted to make an application for the [[Multiplexing|multiplex]] licence bid for multiplex D on the DTT service in 2002 as a joint application with [[Carlton Television|Carlton]], [[Granada Television|Granada]] and [[Channel 4]], trading as the Digital Terrestrial Alliance (DTA). The company were prepared to offer a \"viable\" and \"lite-pay\" service, which would have provided a large number of [[free to air]] channels and a few pay-TV ones.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/uploads/Freeview_Plus.pdf |title=Regulator Archives |publisher=Ofcom |date= |accessdate=2016-09-08}}</ref> The bid was unsuccessful, and the licence was instead awarded to the BBC, BSkyB and [[Crown Castle]], which later became [[National Grid Wireless]].\n\nAfter the turn-down of a multiplex bid, Top Up TV turned to [[public service broadcasting|public service broadcasters]] [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] and [[Channel 4]] to gain capacity on the platform. On [[S4C Digital Networks|multiplex A]], Top Up TV were granted four long-term streams (one of which previously hosted [[TV Travel Shop]]), and on [[Digital 3&4|multiplex 2]], were granted one short-term stream from Channel 4. They came up with a time-shared system which allowed 10 pay-TV channels to be broadcast in the space of five television streams, two of which were allotted \"empty\" space, which later became [[ABC1 (United Kingdom)|ABC1]] and [[Teachers' TV]]. The sixth stream was used as a temporary measure (as of the short-term contract with Channel 4), and hosted pay-per-view channels [[Xtraview]] and [[Red Hot TV (UK)|Red Hot]].\n\nTop Up TV focused less on the premium services which were prominent of [[ITV Digital]] prior to 2002. By 2005, eleven channels were available on the service but were all timeshared. Overnight this dropped to as few as two channels (from the main package), in order to make space for premium [[sex industry|adult entertainment]] channels.\n\nFrom its launch in 2004, Alice Beer ran an Information Programme viewable by the channel placeholders and the Top Up TV Sampler channel at the time about the service. From March 2004, Top Up TV provided a package of 10 timeshared TV channels which was joined by an eleventh in 2005: [[UKTV Gold]], [[UKTV Style]], [[UKTV Food]], [[Discovery Channel (UK)|Discovery Channel]], [[Discovery Home & Leisure (UK)|Discovery Home & Leisure]], [[Turner Classic Movies (UK)|TCM]], [[E4 (channel)|E4]], [[Bloomberg Television|Bloomberg]], [[Cartoon Network (UK)|Cartoon Network]] and [[Boomerang (UK & Ireland)|Boomerang]]. On 27 May 2005, E4 left Top Up TV to become a [[free-to-air]] channel and was replaced by [[Eurosport|British Eurosport]] which began broadcasting on the platform on 1 June 2005. [[Toonami (UK)|Toonami]] also joined the line-up. Discovery Home & Leisure was rebranded Discovery Real Time. In its first year of operation, the company made losses of \u00a37 million. The original service broke even at 250,000 subscribers (according to some sources) around the Time Top Up TV Anytime was announced. This figure fell significantly short of the claimed potential subscriber numbers of 650,000 as set out in the original Freeview Plus proposal document, due to the differing market in 2004 and increasing temptation from Sky (who acquired ITV Digital's customer details) and Cable TV companies.\n\nTop Up TV provided additional services such as [[Xtraview]] which offered Top Up TV channels on a per-day basis, but closed down after Channel 4 wanted the stream back for its own use. This was replaced by Top Up TV Pay As You Go which later closed. Top Up TV Active was an interactive advertising service that replace the off-air MHEG screens on Channel 107; it also featured an audio version of QuizWorld.\n\nIn August 2005, [[Setanta Sports]] broadcast live pay-per-view [[Scottish Premier League]] matches in conjunction with Top Up TV. The service used Top Up TV's Xtraview technology. Originally this was only available to viewers in Scotland, but was made available nationwide in early 2006.\n\nSince 9 February 2007, all but two live channels on the service had been replaced with the push video-on-demand service, as the original package was slowly being phased out. However, premium sports can still be accessed on a live basis. The Xtraview access control system is still in use today for [[TelevisionX]].\n\n===2006\u201313: On-demand and premium sports===\nOn 30 August 2006, Top Up TV announced that it was to launch a new service known as Top Up TV Anytime. The new service required a Top Up TV Anytime DTR, effectively a digital terrestrial television recorder, which allows access to on demand and encrypted channels. The original service, following Anytime's launch, was later mostly phased out, being reduced to two live non-sport channels, [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]] and [[Home (TV channel)|Home]]. Existing channels of the original service at launch closed down or had their hours reduced before being phased out completely. Existing channels along with new channels such as [[Living (channel)|Living]] and [[Disney Channel (UK & Ireland)|Disney Channel]] joined the new service and began offering content on an on-demand basis. PictureBox Movies launched as a premium movies add-on in October 2006.<ref>{{cite web |last=Welsh |first=James |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a37176/top-up-announces-movies-on-demand-service.html |title=Top Up announces movies on demand service |publisher=Digitalspy.co.uk |date=2006-09-18 |accessdate=2016-09-08}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 2006, [[Inview Technology]] launched the world\u2019s first push-VOD service for Top Up TV.<ref name=Inview>{{cite web|last=Technology|first=Inview|title=History|url=http://inview.tv/about/history|work=Top Up TV|publisher=Inview Technology|accessdate=9 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212080719/http://inview.tv/about/history|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> \n\nOn 11 February 2007, Top Up TV's per-per-view Scottish Premier League matches were discontinued, when the [[Setanta Sports 1 & 2|Setanta Sports]] channel was to be made available on Top Up TV by a separate subscription, until the Setanta Sports channel ceased broadcasting in June 2009 after the company went bust.\n\nIn 2009, Top Up TV Anytime was rebranded into TV Favourites, spawning PictureBox and the newly launched ESPN into viewing packs available as part of TV Favourites or available separately. Monday 2 August 2010 saw Sky Sports 1 and Sky Sports 2 launch through Top Up TV.<ref>{{cite web|last=Laughlin |first=Andrew |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a254780/sky-sports-1-2-go-live-on-top-up-tv.html |title=Sky Sports 1, 2 go live on Top Up TV |publisher=Digitalspy.co.uk |date=2010-08-02 |accessdate=2016-09-08}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, four streams were used to distribute the TV Favourites service, but the fourth stream was taken off air on 11 January 2010. The third stream was pulled from air roughly ten months later. The first stream under the name of \"Top Up TV Anytime 1\" in the EPG timeshared with ESPN, and the second stream under the name of \"Top Up TV Anytime 3\" in the EPG timeshared with Home, Gold, and Television X.\n\n===2013: Loss of sports and closure===\nIn June 2013, following the acquisition of ESPN by BT and the announcement of the removal of Sky Sports 1 & 2 from the Digital Terrestrial Television ([[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]]) network by BT, Top Up TV began sending letters to their customers stating that their premium sports package(s) would be discontinued. Sky Sports 1 & 2 were removed on 1 July, and ESPN on 1 August.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Briel |url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2013/06/05/top-up-tv-ends-sports-channels/ |title=Top Up TV ends sports channels |publisher=Broadbandtvnews.com |date=2013-06-05 |accessdate=2016-09-08}}</ref>\n\nIn September, Top Up TV sent customers on the TV Favourites and PictureBox packages letters informing them that the service would cease broadcasting on 31 October 2013 and that all remaining subscriptions will cease automatically. TUTV advised that the hardware will continue to work as a Freeview decoder. This brought the period of uncertainty about TUTV's future to an end.\n\nOn 31 October, Top Up TV placed a notice on their website stating that they had ceased broadcasting. The company sold their subscriber business to [[BSkyB|Sky]] where new subscribers to Sky could get up to 50% off for a year if they went through Top Up TV. Until June 2015, the company continued to run conditional access to the Freeview platform<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.topuptv.com/main/business.html|title=Top Up TV Technical Support Advisory Service|website=Top Up TV|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222223706/http://www.topuptv.com/main/business.html|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> which BT used to broadcast BT Sports 1 and 2.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]\n* [[YouView]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Media in the United Kingdom|television}}\n{{CATV}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Top Up Tv}}\n[[Category:Companies established in 2004]]\n[[Category:Companies disestablished in 2015]]\n[[Category:Digital television in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Pay television]]\n", "name_user": "J947", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's, 6300-25 \u2192 6300\u201325", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Up_TV"}

The Council's principal tasks are to:\n\n* analyse global environment and development problems and report on these, \n* review and evaluate national and international research in the field of global change,\n* provide early warning of new issue areas,\n* identify gaps in research and to initiate new research,\n* monitor and assess national and international policies for the achievement of sustainable development,\n* elaborate recommendations for action and research and\n* raise public awareness and heighten the media profile of global change issues.\n\nThe WBGU also comments on current events, such as the [[United Nations Climate Change conference]]s (e.g., in Paris 2015), the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (Rio+20), the adoption of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (2015),<ref>http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-8-2014-sdg/</ref> the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development [[Habitat III]]<ref>http://www.wbgu.de/fileadmin/templates/dateien/veroeffentlichungen/weitere/statement_habitat_2016.pdf</ref> (2016) or Germany's [[G20]] presidency in 2017.<ref>http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2016-g20/</ref>\n\n==Reports==\n\n===Flagship Reports===\n\n====Towards our Common Digital Future (2019)<ref>[http://www.wbgu.de/fr2019 Flagship report 2019], \u201eTowards our Common Digital Future\u201c</ref>====\nWithout creative political action, digital change will further accelerate resource and energy consumption, and exacerbate damage to the environment and the climate. It is therefore an urgent political task to create the conditions needed to place digitalization at the service of sustainable development; this is one of the key messages of the report \"Towards our Common Digital Future\" [LINK]. In the short term, the aim is to harmonize digitalization with the global sustainability goals agreed in 2015 (SDGs, Agenda 2030) and the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. New technologies should be used specifically and comprehensively to give people access to basic services such as healthcare, education, energy and (environmental) information and to prevent environmental degradation. Examples include promoting the energy-system transformation using intelligent energy networks, reducing vehicular traffic in cities by means of shared mobility (which makes owning a car superfluous), and using digital technologies to promote a [[circular economy]]. In addition, precautions must already be taken today to deal with the profound societal upheavals that will accompany digitalization in the medium term. Examples include the foreseeable radical structural change on the labour markets, the replacement of real-world experiences in virtual spaces, the manifold impacts of artificial intelligence on education, science and democracy, and the challenge of democratically restricting the surveillance potential of new technologies. According to the WBGU's new report, all digital changes should be geared towards the common good and improving people's quality of life. Finally, another issue is preparing for possible long-term upheavals. For example, in human-machine interaction, risks to human integrity are already recognizable today. This concerns, for example, sensitive neuro-data or neuro-prostheses, whose ethical aspects have been insufficiently taken into account up to now. In the age of digitalization, it is necessary to redefine our understanding of 'human development\u2018.\n\n====Humanity on the move: The transformative power of cities (2016)<ref>[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2016-urbanization/ Flagship report 2016], \u201eHumanity on the move: The transformative power of cities\u201c</ref>====\nThe momentum of urbanization and its impacts are so massive that we must face up to this trend. In view of the existing cognitive, technical, economic and institutional path dependencies, a policy of business as usual \u2013 i.e. an unstructured, quasi-automatic urbanization \u2013 would lead to a non-sustainable \u2018world cities society\u2019. Only if cities and urban societies are sufficiently empowered can they make use of the opportunities for sustainability and successfully follow the urban transformation pathways. The success or failure of the Great Transformation will be decided in the cities. The WBGU discusses the relevant conditions for the success of this transformation in this report.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Governing the Marine Heritage (2013)<ref>[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2013-oceans/ Flagship report 2013], \u201eWorld in Transition: Governing the Marine Heritage.\u201c</ref>====\nDespite numerous international treaties and voluntary commitments, the seas are still being massively overfished, polluted and increasingly exploited as the Earth's last resort. In view of the oceans\u2019 poor condition, the WBGU developed a long-term vision of the conservation and sustainable use of the blue continent: All marine zones with the exception of territorial waters should be declared as common heritage of mankind. In order to move closer to this ultimate goal for [[ocean governance]], the WBGU also gives recommendations for action that link up with ongoing political processes, especially for two focal themes: food ([[sustainable fisheries]] and [[aquaculture]]) and energy from the sea. The report shows that sustainable stewardship of the oceans is urgently necessary, that the seas can be incorporated into a transformation towards a low-carbon, sustainable society, and that such a transformation can achieve substantial benefits worldwide both for a sustainable energy supply and for food security.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 A Social Contract for Sustainability (2011)<ref>[http://www.wbgu.de/wbgu_jg2011_en/ Flagship report 2011], \u201eWorld in Transition: A Social Contract for Sustainability.\u201c</ref>====\n\nIn this report, the WBGU explains the reasons for the desperate need for a post-fossil economic strategy, yet it also concludes that the transition to sustainability is achievable, and presents ten concrete packages of measures to accelerate the imperative restructuring. If the transformation really is to succeed, we have to enter into a social contract for innovation, in the form of a new kind of discourse between governments and citizens, both within and beyond the boundaries of the nation state.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Future Bioenergy and Sustainable Land Use (2008)<ref>[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2008-bioenergy/ Flagship report 2008], \u201eWorld in Transition: Future Bioenergy and Sustainable Land Use.\u201c</ref>====\nIn view of the major opportunities and risks associated with it, and the complexity of the subject, bioenergy policy has in a short time become a challenging political task for regulators and planners \u2013 a task which can only be accomplished through worldwide cooperation and the creation of an international framework. WBGU's central message is that use should be made of the sustainable potential of bioenergy which can be tapped all over the world, provided that risks to sustainability are excluded. In particular, the use of bioenergy must not endanger food security or the goals of nature conservation and climate change mitigation.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013  Climate Change as a Security Risk (2007)<ref name=\"Flagship report 2007\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2007-security/ Flagship report 2007] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216130144/http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2007-security/ |date=2017-12-16 }}, \u201eWorld in Transition: Climate Change as a Security Risk.\u201c</ref>====\nWithout resolute counteraction, climate change will overstretch many societies\u2019 adaptive capacities within the coming decades. This could result in destabilization and violence, jeopardizing national and international security to a new degree. However, climate change could also unite the international community, provided that it recognizes climate change as a threat to humankind and soon sets the course for the avoidance of dangerous anthropogenic climate change by adopting a dynamic and globally coordinated climate policy. If it fails to do so, climate change will draw ever-deeper lines of division and conflict in international relations, triggering numerous conflicts between and within countries over the distribution of resources, especially water and land, over the management of migration, or over compensation payments between the countries mainly responsible for climate change and those countries most affected by its destructive effects. That is the backdrop against which WBGU, in this flagship report, summarizes the state-of-the-art of science on the subject of \u201cClimate Change as a Security Risk\u201d. It is based on the findings of research into environmental conflicts, the causes of war, and of climate impact research. It appraises past experience but also ventures to cast a glance far into the future in order to assess the likely impacts of climate change on societies, nation-states, regions and the international system.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Fighting Poverty through Environmental Policy (2004)<ref name=\"Flagship report 2004\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2004-poverty/ Flagship report 2004], \u201eWorld in Transition: Fighting Poverty through Environmental Policy.\u201c</ref>====\nAt the start of the 21st century, fighting poverty and protecting the environment are two of the most urgent challenges facing the international community. Narrowing the massive disparities in the satisfaction of basic needs and distribution of prosperity must be a primary objective. Extreme poverty, such as that prevailing above all in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and South Asia, is the most obvious manifestation of the untenable imbalance in the world's social system. The recommendations for action set out in this report are based on an analysis of the systemic links between poverty (income poverty, disease, malnutrition, and lack of education, social stability and social capital) and environmental changes (climate change, lack of water resources, [[water pollution]], [[soil degradation]], loss of [[biological diversity]] and resources, and air pollution). The manifestations of and interactions between poverty and environmental problems are investigated in their various forms. This type of integrated analysis is nothing new; what is new, however, is the consistent linking of a holistic approach with the following key questions: which institutional arrangements offer ways of coping with these problems, and where must gaps be closed? To this end, WBGU has evaluated major international political processes and developed recommendations on policy coherence. It also presents various recommendations on further research to identify the strategic gaps in theoretical and practical knowledge.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Towards Sustainable Energy Systems (2003)<ref name=\"Flagship report 2003\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2003-energy/ Flagship report 2003], \u201eWorld in Transition: Towards Sustainable Energy Systems.\u201c</ref>====\nThe report underscores the urgent need to transform global energy systems so that the world's population has access to energy based on renewable sources. This is necessary in order to protect the global climate and to liberate 2.4&nbsp;billion people in developing countries from energy poverty. Such an approach would also yield a peace dividend by reducing dependence upon regionally concentrated oil reserves. The scientists stress that such a reconfiguration of energy systems is feasible and fundable if rapid and resolute action is taken in the coming two decades. To this end, they propose a roadmap with specific milestones.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 New Structures for Global Environmental Policy (2000)<ref name=\"Flagship report 2001\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2000-institutions/ Flagship report 2000], \u201eWorld in Transition: New Structures for Global Environmental Policy.\u201c</ref>====\nToday, more than 900 bi- and multilateral environmental treaties are in force. Nonetheless, the most pressing problems of global change remain unresolved, some are even intensifying. The international institutional and organisational architecture has proven too weak to provide effective and efficient responses to these challenges. In this situation, the WBGU has developed a vision for reforming the United Nations in the environmental arena. It terms this the \u2018Earth Alliance\u2019, comprising three interlocking realms. First, to provide authority in the assessment of environmental problems, the WBGU proposes establishing an independent body whose task is to provide timely warning of particularly risk-laden developments in the sphere of global change \u2013 Earth Assessment. Second, the report gives recommendations for redesigning the organisational core of global environmental policy \u2013 [[Earth Organisation]]. This revolves around the step-wise establishment of an International Environmental Organisation, building on the existing [[United Nations Environment Programme]] as its initial nucleus. Third, the WBGU highlights new avenues for financing global environmental policy \u2013 Earth Funding.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013  Conservation and Sustainable Use of the Biosphere (1999)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1999\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1999-biosphere/ Flagship report 1999], \u201eWorld in Transition: Conservation and Sustainable Use of the Biosphere.\u201c</ref>====\nBiodiversity - the planet's natural capital - is undergoing a dramatic collapse: its 'Sixth Extinction'. The losses, which are due to human activities and overexploitation of the biosphere, are irreversible. They are undermining the basis of future wellbeing and prosperity - including genetic resources and food production, climate stability, and coastal and soil protection. This volume presents an authoritative and alarming analysis of the state of the biosphere. The WBGU shows that the time remaining for remedial action is disappearing fast and sets out a range of initiatives to be undertaken at different levels. The main recommendations are:\n- protecting 10-20 per cent of the global land area\n- an 'Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity' to provide scientific advice\n- conservation of the diversity of cultivated as well as wild plant species\n- extending bioregional management and nature sponsorship\n- greater multilateral co-operation and implementation of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Strategies for Managing Global Environmental Risks (1998)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1998\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1998-global-risks/ Flagship report 1998], \u201eWorld in Transition: Strategies for Managing Global Environmental Risks.\u201c</ref>====\nGlobal risk potentials and their interplay with economic, social and ecological processes of change have emerged as a challenge to the international community. Never before has human intervention in nature assumed global dimensions. This has been driven on the one hand by a growing global population, particularly in developing countries, and on the other hand by rising human demands in conjunction with specific patterns of production and consumption, above all in industrialised countries. By presenting this report, the WBGU hopes to contribute constructively to an effective, efficient and objective management of the risks of global change. The approach taken by the WBGU is first to classify globally relevant risks and then to assign to these classes of risk both established and innovative risk assessment strategies and risk management tools. On this basis, management priorities can be set. However, the WBGU notes that it is impossible to safeguard against all global risks, particularly as exploiting opportunities will always entail taking risks.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Ways Towards Sustainable Management of Freshwater Resources (1997)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1997\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1997-water/ Flagship report 1997], \u201eWorld in Transition: Ways Towards Sustainable Management of Freshwater Resources.\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe global water crisis is expected to become more severe in the near future. The WBGU presents an analysis of specific regions that are presently most affected by water shortages, and regions that will be particularly threatened by future water crises. In line with its past reports on global change, the WBGU examines three major \"syndromes of global change\" that are strongly linked to the worldwide water crisis. Based on this analysis, explicit recommendations for future research and for political action are presented.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 The Research Challenge  (1996)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1996\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1996-research/ Flagship report 1996], \u201eWorld in Transition: The Research Challenge.\u201c</ref>====\nDevelopment and environment problems have reached such alarming dimensions that the very survival of humanity is now subject to critical and unprecedented threats. So far, the scientific community has failed to deliver strategic responses adequate to this situation. Analyses produced by the separate disciplines are similarly inadequate due to the complexity of the problems involved and the intricate interlinkages between them. In this report, the WBGU criticizes Germany's global change research community for its lack of international orientation, its bias towards individual disciplines and for its weaknesses in translating scientific results into a form readily accessible to policymakers. The WBGU identifies alternatives for restructuring the research landscape, focusing primarily on a new \"Syndrome Approach\" for global change research. By applying this tool, scientists can systematically describe and analyze the \"diseases\" afflicting the Earth System, and thus elaborate response options. The 16 most important syndromes, or \"clinical profiles\" of Planet Earth were identified.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Ways Towards Global Environmental Solutions (1995)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1995\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1995-global-policy/ Flagship report 1995], \u201eWorld in Transition: Ways Towards Global Environmental Solutions.\u201c</ref>====\nIn many areas of global change solutions are not at sight. However, dedicated and immediate action could, in principle, avert irreversible or disastrous damage to the global environment. Whether these steps will actually be taken will have to be seen, since substantial efforts and significant reorientations at the local, national and global level are necessary.\n\nTwo aspects have to be considered: on the one hand, at the societal level, the prerequisites for solving global environmental problems have to be improved. These measures present a challenge to nations and societies as a whole, where nongovernmental organisations could also play an important role. On the other hand, at the governmental level, international agreements must be formulated or intensified and enforced by suitable measures.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 The Threat to Soils (1994)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1994\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1994-soils/ Flagship report 1994], \u201eWorld in Transition: The Threat to Soils.\u201c</ref>====\nSoils form an essential basis for humanity, but have received too little attention to date. In differing respects, human activities in many parts of the world lead to various levels of soil degradation, from declining fertility to irreversible destruction. Many local processes culminate to form a global environmental trend that must be counteracted by political action as a matter of urgency. The fact that the slow destruction of soils is a process barely perceptible to human senses has meant in turn that this topic is dealt with in the environmental debate as a somewhat marginal issue. Therefore, the threat to soils must be accorded much greater significance on the environmental agenda - improved legal frameworks must be created, both nationally and internationally, for soils as an environmental asset. The report is divided into two sections. The first section (standard section) presents and comments on new developments in various fields of Global Change. The second section of the report (focus section) deals with the global threat to soils. The WBGU emphasises that, in view of the seriousness of the soil problems outlined in this report, a new efficient institutional framework should now be established. For this reason the German Federal Government should decide in principle whether a differentiated \"Soil Declaration\" suffices or whether a global \"Soil Convention\" has to be striven for. This report provides the relevant arguments for both instruments. Global soil protection must obtain a similar attention on the international agenda as has been achieved for climate policy.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013  Basic Structure of Global People-Environment Interactions (1993)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1993\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1993-people-environment/ Flagship report 1993], \u201eWorld in Transition: Basic Structure of Global People-Environment Interactions.\u201c</ref>====\nIn this report, the WBGU endeavours to provide a holistic analysis of the Earth System, whereby the central focus is directed at the principal interactions between nature and society. The aim here is to demonstrate the complexity of environmental problems, on the one hand, and to create, on the other, the analytical basis for assessing the impact of current trends on the system as a whole. The most serious global problems and major global trends in the estimation of the WBGU are:\n\n* Growth of the world's population\n* Long-term changes in the composition of the atmosphere\n* Loss of biodiversity\n* Degradation and loss of soils\n\nConcluding its report, the WBGU lays particular emphasis on three general recommendations:\n- German development aid should be increased to 1% of the GNP, whereby the term 'developing countries' should be redefined to include the states of Eastern Europe.\n- With respect to the instruments discussed in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the WBGU recommends that negotiations concerning a certificate scheme for reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions should be started, with the aim of achieving its international implementation. Parallel to the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that would then occur, efforts should be made to increase the financial transfers for the protection of the tropical forests.\n- Programmes should be developed aiming at sensitising citizens to global environmental problems and promoting environmentally friendly behaviour.\n\n===Special Reports===\n\n====Development and justice through transformation: The Four Big \u2018I\u2019s  (2016)<ref name=\"Special Report 2016\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2016-g20/ Special report 2016], \u201eDevelopment and justice through transformation: The Four Big \u2018I\u2019s \u201c</ref>====\n2015 saw a historic double success for sustainability and climate policy. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the Paris Agreement on climate protection establish a system of ambitious policy goals for the world. The group of twenty major industrialized and emerging economies (G20) now needs to resolutely advance implementation of both agreements, seizing the opportunity of this \u2018Great Transformation\u2019 to sustainability as a unique modernization project that could offer substantial economic development opportunities. Complete decarbonization of the world economy, which is necessary to avoid the gravest climate risks, can only be achieved by profoundly transforming energy systems and other high-emissions infrastructures. This transformation could inspire Innovation and channel Investment into sustainability and climate protection, and into the kinds of sustainable Infrastructures that need to be established and expanded. At the same time, the transformation could combat inequality and promote Inclusion within societies and globally, thus becoming an equity project.\n\n====Climate Protection as a World Citizen Movement (2014)<ref name=\"Special Report 2014\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2014-climate-protection/ Special report 2014], \u201eClimate Protection as a World Citizen Movement\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) makes it unmistakably clear: unacceptable climatic consequences, which are likely to escalate beyond the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C guard rail, can only be avoided if further increases in greenhouse-gas concentrations are halted as soon as possible. The WBGU therefore recommends reducing CO2 emissions from fossil fuels to zero by 2070 at the latest. This policy goal is both ambitious and incisive, because 'the zero target must be reached' by every country, every municipality, every company and every citizen if the world as a whole is to become climate-neutral. However, the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C line can only be held if a large proportion of stakeholders \u2013 especially the OECD countries \u2013 start reducing their emissions much earlier. Global society as a whole has only a very limited carbon budget at its disposal; emissions should therefore peak by 2020 if possible, or in the third decade at the latest. In this report the WBGU outlines a two-pronged strategy for global climate protection based on interaction between multilateralism and civil society. To achieve this, on the one hand the Paris Climate Agreement targeted for late 2015 should exhibit certain characteristics set out by the WBGU. In particular, a process should be agreed to ensure compliance with the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C guard rail. On the other hand, all social actors should make their specific contributions towards decarbonization. In this way, an intricate responsibility architecture for the future of our planet can emerge in which vertical delegating and horizontal engagement are not contradictions, but complementary factors that reinforce each other.\n\n====Solving the climate dilemma: The budget approach (2009)<ref name=\"Special Report 2009\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2009-budget-approach/ Special report 2009], \u201eSolving the climate dilemma: The budget approach.\u201c</ref>====\n\nAt their meeting in the Italian city of L\u2019Aquila in July 2009, the heads of state and governments of the G8 countries and the [[Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate]] (MEF), whose members include India, Brazil and China, acknowledged the importance that [[global warming]] must not exceed the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C guard rail if dangerous climate change is to be avoided. WBGU views this as an extremely important step towards the adoption of a binding international agreement which establishes a well-founded target for global climate protection. The task now is to build on this consensus and reach agreement, at [[Copenhagen]], on a follow-up treaty to the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which is due to expire in 2012. This new international agreement should translate the relevant scientific knowledge into a fair and practicable global strategy to combat global warming. So far, however, the lack of unanimity between the countries involved in the negotiating process has meant that there is no clear leitmotif pointing the way towards such an agreement.\n\n====The Future Oceans: Warming Up, Rising High, Turning Sour (2006)<ref name=\"Special report 2006\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2006-the-future-oceans/ Special report 2006], \u201eThe Future Oceans \u2013 Warming Up, Rising High, Turning Sour.\u201c</ref>====\nLatest research findings show that failure to check mankind's emissions of carbon dioxide will have severe consequences for the world's oceans. The marine environment is doubly affected: continuing warming and ongoing acidification both pose threats. In combination with over-fishing, these two threats are further jeopardizing already weakened fish stocks. Sea-level rise is exposing coastal regions to mounting flood and hurricane risks. To keep the adverse effects on human society and ecosystems within manageable limits, it will be essential to adopt new coastal protection approaches, designate marine protected areas and agree on ways to deal with refugees from endangered coastal areas. All such measures, however, can only succeed if global warming and ocean acidification are combated vigorously. Ambitious climate protection is therefore a key precondition to successful marine conservation and coastal protection.\n\n====Climate Protection Strategies for the 21st Century. Kyoto and Beyond (2003)<ref name=\"Special report 2003\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2003-kyoto-and-beyond/ Special report 2003], \u201eClimate Protection Strategies for the 21st Century. Kyoto and Beyond.\u201c</ref>====\nWith this special report, the WBGU provides recommendations for future negotiations within the context of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), particularly relating to the Kyoto Protocol to the Convention. The report centres on three questions:\n*What is \u2018dangerous climate change\u2019 within the meaning of Article 2 of the UNFCCC?\n*Which socio-economically and technologically viable pathways are available to prevent such dangerous climate change?\n*How can all countries be integrated equitably within a system of emissions reduction commitments?\nThe report concentrates on the potentials to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide, this being the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas. The analysis focuses, on the one hand, on the economic and technological potentials to reduce energy and industry related emissions and, on the other hand, on the relevance of biological sinks of carbon dioxide and the options to preserve them. Finally, based on this analysis, the report contains specific recommendations on ways to shape political and economic instruments in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.\n\n====Charging the Use of Global Commons (2002)<ref name=\"Special report 2002\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2002-charging-the-use/ Special report 2002], \u201eCharging the Use of Global Commons.\u201c</ref>====\nGlobal common resources like international airspace and the high seas are in danger of overexploitation because the users need not bear the full social costs of their actions. The CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions of international aviation and of shipping are not subject to the quantitative reduction obligations of the Kyoto Protocol. Imposing user charges can close this regulatory gap and induce environment-related incentive effects to reduce environmental damage. Moreover, additional financial resources are generated, which should be earmarked for the protection and conservation of global common goods. In this special report, the WBGU makes recommendations for a politically viable implementation of the concept of global user charges for three specific areas of application:\n*   Charges on the use of airspace by aviation,\n*   Charges on the use of the oceans by shipping,\n*   Payments for non utilisation obligations.\n\n====Environment and Ethics (1999)<ref name=\"Special report 1999\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-1999-environment-and-ethics/ Special report 1999], \u201eEnvironment and Ethics.\u201c</ref>====\nShould people be allowed to do everything they want? Should humankind be allowed to use nature and the environment completely for its own ends? More and more people are questioning the limits of human intervention in nature. What is ethically allowed and what should be prohibited? The WBGU offers some answers to these difficult questions. At the same time it has drawn up a number of principles, which should not be violated, even where there are big economical gains. In addition, in a democratic and culturally diverse society it is the task of ethics to lay down generally binding criteria for balancing between nature-related and, for example, economic matters. With these tools of ethical and economic criteria the [[Federal Government of Germany]] could support the interests of environmental protection at the international level.\n\n====The Accounting of Biological Sinks and Sources Under the Kyoto Protocol: A Step Forwards or Backwards for Global Environmental Protection? (1998)<ref name=\"Special report 1998\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-1998-kyoto/ Special report 1998], \u201eThe Accounting of Biological Sinks and Sources Under the Kyoto Protocol: A Step Forwards or Backwards for Global Environmental Protection?.\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe WBGU assesses the Kyoto Protocol with respect to the accounting of biological sources and sinks. In principle, the WBGU supports the idea of linking climate protection and the conservation of sinks. However, the WBGU considers the form in which biological sources and sinks are accounted in the Kyoto Protocol to be inadequate and in need of improvement if the objectives of climate protection and biodiversity conservation are both to be served. The present accounting approach can lead to incentives with negative impacts upon climate protection, biodiversity conservation and soil protection. In addition, many uncertainties and imponderables attach to the reduction in net emissions that is achievable by means of terrestrial sinks. Even slight climate changes can lead to sinks becoming sources. Over the long run, fossil fuel emissions can not be compensated for by the terrestrial biosphere. The WBGU analyses the provisions of the Kyoto-Protocol and presents the state of knowledge on the source and sink potentials of terrestrial ecosystems and on the existing uncertainties and unresolved issues. This forms the basis for an assessment of the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol as well as for recommendations for the interpretation and concrete application of these provisions.\n\n====Targets for Climate Protection 1997<ref name=\"Special report 1997\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-1997-climate-protection/ Special report 1997], \u201eTargets for Climate Protection.\u201c</ref>====\nThis statement was issued on the occasion of the Third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the Climate Convention, FCCC), and contains recommendations on the commitments to be agreed upon in a protocol to the Convention. According to the \"Berlin Mandate\" adopted at the first Conference of the Parties, the commitments of the industrialized countries listed in Annex I of the Climate Convention are to be strengthened by setting quantified limitation and reduction objectives within specified time frames for their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These measures are aimed at achieving the ultimate objective of the FCCC, namely a \"stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\".\n\n====Scenario for the derivation of global CO<sub>2</sub>-reduction targets and implementation strategies (1995)<ref name=\"Special report 1995\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-1995-co2-reduction/ Special report 1995], \u201eScenario for the derivation of global CO<sub>2</sub>-reduction targets and implementation strategies.\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe WBGU derives a global CO<sub>2</sub> reduction target by using an \"inverse scenario\" based on simplified models for climate dynamics and [[The Carbon Cycle|the carbon cycle]]. By first analysing the maximum stress levels caused by climate change that one can assume to be ecologically and economically bearable, a \"tolerance window\" for the future climatic development is deduced. In a further step, the set of admissible emission profiles is determined, i.e., those global CO<sub>2</sub> emission functions which keep the climate system within the demarcated window. Among the so-defined family of emission options a specific strategy is finally singled out by feasibility criteria. The WBGU believes that such an integrated assessment of the climate change problem in the \"backwards mode\" has several advantages in comparison with the straightforward approach. It has to be emphasised, however, that the analysis employs a number of assumptions and approximations and therefore has the character of a \"[[Gedankenexperiment]]\".\n\n===Policy Papers===\n\n====A European Way to our Common Digital Future<ref name=\"Policy Paper 11, 2019\">[https://www.wbgu.de/en/publications/publication/pp11-2019 Policy Paper 11, 2019], \u201eA European Way to our Common Digital Future\u201c</ref>====\nParticularly during its presidency of the Council of the EU in 2020, Germany should build upon the Green Deal announced by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and work towards a close integration of digital change and sustainability. The new EU Parliament and the new European Commission should also pursue this goal. To this end the WBGU presents 7 cornerstones of a European way to a common digital future:\n\n# Integrate the opportunities and risks of digitalization into EU sustainability policy: The EU needs an implementation strategy for the SDGs that also places digital technologies at the service of sustainability and addresses its risks. In the same way, digitalization should be embedded in the 8th Environmental Action Programme from 2021 onwards. \n# Actively shape digital policy in line with sustainability goals: Ecological and social aimsthat can be reached through digitalization shouldbe pursued with equal emphasis, e.g. via the European Digital Agenda, the European Commission\u2019s Strategy for Artificial Intelligence (AI), or measures within the framework of the Digital Europe programme. Negative (side) effects should be identified and minimized at an early stage.\n# Involve the private sector more in the provision of data: Up to now, EU data policy has concentrated on the protection of personal data and the use of data from public authorities. This does not go far enough: accessibility to, and the re-use of (non-personal) private-sector data should also be improved in order to create data that can be used for the common good and digitalized (knowledge) assets. \n# Develop and apply artificial intelligence in a sustainable way: The EU should be consistent in following its value-based approach in the application and development of AI systems: fundamental rights, human dignity, environmental and sustainability principles are the normative foundation of the EU and non-negotiable. There is an urgent need for (framework) legislation on the development and handling of AI, since ethical guidelines and debates alone are not enough to ensure a corresponding development and application. In addition, research on explainable and secure, i.e. reliably verified and validated, AI should be promoted and used to ensure trustworthy, fair and accountable procedures.\n# Ensure access to digital commons and basic services through public-service information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures: Individual inclusion, personal development, environmental protection, fair competition and a functioning digital public sphere require access to data and services such as cloud services, mobility platforms or a search index. Their almost exclusively private-sector provision is not always in the interests of the common good. The EU\u2019s task should be to create or ensure public-service digital and digitalized infrastructures to make data and information accessible for the common good and to offer alternative (basic) services under public law.\n# Gear EU research policy and promotion of innovations consistently towards sustainability goals: Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) should be applied as an overarching concept of European research and innovation policy in order to explicitly embed the orientation towards sustainability goals and to avoid unintended impacts. The high levels of protection of the environment, consumers and occupational health and safety in the EU must not be weakened by the innovation principle currently under discussion. Horizon Europe\u2019s missions should aim to integrate digital change and the Transformation towards Sustainability and strengthen transformative and transformation research. \n# European digitalization model as a priority in foreign policy: The EU should also promote the integration of sustainability and digitalization internationally. It should initiate a summit on \u2018Sustainability in the Digital Age\u2019, e.g. for 2022, symbolically 30 years after the Earth Summit in Rio, to set the course for the necessary continuation of the sustainability agenda until 2030 and beyond.\n\n\n====Digital Momentum for the UN Sustainability Agenda in the 21st Century<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2019\">[https://www.wbgu.de/en/publications/publication/pp10-2019 Policy Paper 2019], \u201eDigital Momentum for the UN Sustainability Agenda in the 21st Century\u201c</ref>====\n\nGlobal digital change should be designed to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda with its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Up to now, hopes that digitalization would make a contribution to achieving these goals has not materialized. Only if digital change and the Transformation towards Sustainability are constructively interlinked can we make progress with environmental protection, climate-change mitigation and human development. The WBGU would like to introduce into the discussion four ideas directly related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). First: promote a global (environmental) awareness among people worldwide by providing a stronger future-proof education. The focus should be on enabling people to actively shape digital change and the Transformation towards Sustainability. Open data relating to sustainability and virtual learning environments are important elements for experiencing ecosystems. In concrete terms, an integrated programme for future-proof education should be developed, UN processes should be opened up to citizen-science projects, and an International Information Union should be founded to collect, process and publish sustainability-related data. Second, establish a digitally enhanced circular economy. The transition from linear and resource-intensive value chains to a near-complete circular economy is a key component of the Transformation towards Sustainability. Digital data acquisition and processing offer great potential for this. Environmentally harmful emissions and resource depletion should be recorded across all sectors of the economy and value chains, and greater efforts should be made to implement the 3Rs strategy (reduce, reuse, recycle) at the international level. Third, modernize sustainability policy itself by using digital solutions. Digitally enhanced governance can help improve the transparency of political actions, as well as the participation and worldwide networking of political actors. Coordination within the UN system should be intensified by establishing a 'UN Digitalization Initiative'; a 'UN Framework Convention on Digital Sustainability and Sustainable Digitalization' should be negotiated; and a globally uniform set of indicators for the SDGs should be developed to facilitate the comparability and verifiability of national reports. Fourth, further develop the global sustainability agenda beyond 2030 against the background of the opportunities and risks of the Digital Age. The UN should prepare for these future challenges in good time. The WBGU recommends convening a UN summit on 'Sustainability in the Digital Age' in 2022 \u2013 30 years after the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro \u2013 to set the course for continuing the sustainability agenda beyond 2030. A key outcome could be the adoption of a charter entitled 'Towards Our Common Digital Future'.\n\n====Just & In\u2013Time Climate Policy: Four Initiatives for Fairness (2018){{nnbsp}}<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2018\">{{cite book\n | author = WBGU\n | title = Just & in-time climate policy: four initiatives for a fair transformation \u2014 Policy paper 9\n | date = 20 July 2018\n | publisher = Scientific Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU)\n | location = Berlin, Germany\n | isbn = 978-3-936191-86-8\n | url = https://www.wbgu.de/fileadmin/user_upload/wbgu.de/templates/dateien/veroeffentlichungen/politikpapiere/pp2018-pp9/wbgu_policypaper_9.pdf\n | access-date = 2018-12-02\n}}  Translation from German.\n</ref>====\nLimiting global warming to well below 2&nbsp;\u00b0C requires the rapid decarbonization of the global economy. If this enterprise fails, we will jeopardize the life-support systems of future generations. The longer the transformation towards climate compatibility is delayed, the more severe the risks and damage will be for a growing number of people. The transformation requirements and the damage caused by climate change have an unequal temporal, geographical and social distribution \u2013 as do the respective possibilities for dealing with them. The WBGU therefore proposes a just & in-time transformation that takes into account all people affected, empowers them, holds those responsible for climate change accountable, and creates both global and national prospects for the future. The WBGU proposes that the German Federal Government should promote four exemplary initiatives of a just & in-time climate policy targeting (1) the people affected by the structural change towards climate compatibility (e.g. in coal-mining regions), (2) the legal rights of people harmed by climate change, (3) the dignified migration of people who lose their native countries due to climate change, and (4) the creation of financing instruments for just & in-time transformation processes.\n\n====Human progress within planetary guard rails. A contribution to the SDG debate (2014)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2014\">[https://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-8-2014-sdg/ Policy Paper 2014], \u201eHuman progress within planetary guard rails. A contribution to the SDG debate\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe year 2015 has special importance for the transformation towards sustainable development. New Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are then supposed to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The aim is to offer a new orientation for political action in the coming decades. The WBGU recommends orienting the new catalogue of goals towards the key message of the 1992 Earth Summit: that development and environmental protection must be considered together and do not contradict each other. The SDGs should not be reduced to poverty eradication, but must address all dimensions of sustainable development. In particular, global environmental change must be incorporated, otherwise even poverty eradication will become impossible. Up to now, too little attention has been paid to this link in the ongoing discourse on SDGs. Although many reports mention the concept of planetary guard rails or planetary boundaries, they do not back this up with specific targets. The WBGU presents recommendations on how guard rails for global environmental problems should be incorporated in the SDG catalogue and operationalized by means of corresponding targets.\n\n====Financing the Global Energy-System Transformation (2012)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2012\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policypaper-7/ Policy Paper 2012], \u201eFinancing the Global Energy System Transformation\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe world faces the challenge of a global transformation to sustainable energy systems. Substantial up-front investments are needed to improve energy efficiency and switch to renewable energies. At the same time, these investments offer great opportunities, because strategic innovations can be triggered and new markets can develop in the course of the transformation process. Savings on the cost of fossil fuels in conventional technologies could completely offset the investment in renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency by as early as 2040. The private capital needed for the transformation is available and can be mobilised if a suitable political framework is put into place. A corresponding regulatory policy should be introduced to make such investment more attractive for the private sector. The WBGU advocates a proactive state that integrates energy, environmental and climate policy; this could reduce existing investment risks by developing a stable, long-term transformative regulatory framework. At the same time, policy makers should expand the opportunities for participation. Germany is currently leading this transformation, both in terms of technological innovations and in the creation of a suitable policy framework. Our country is able to give the world an example of how the [[Energiewende]] (energy-system transformation) can generate more, not less prosperity.\n\n====Climate Policy Post-Copenhagen: A Three-Level Strategy for Success (2010)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2010\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policypaper-6/ Policy Paper 2010], \u201eClimate policy post-Copenhagen: Action at three levels offers prospect of success.\u201c</ref>====\n\nInternational climate policy post-Copenhagen is in crisis. There is currently no prospect of the comprehensive and binding UN climate treaty \u2013 the outcome hoped for at the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference \u2013 being achieved within the foreseeable future. However, in order to keep the global mean temperature rise below 2&nbsp;\u00b0C by the end of the century, a resolute course must be set in the international climate process within the next few years. The WBGU recommends that in order to revitalise the multilateral climate process, policy-makers and civil society in Europe take on a self-confident leading role in global alliances with selected \u2018climate pioneer\u2019 countries and that more intensive support be provided for civil society initiatives. The aim of establishing a binding international regime to limit CO<sub>2</sub> emissions \u2013 based, for example, on the WBGU's own budget approach and similar approaches now also being discussed in China and India \u2013 must remain in place. The following recommendations are directed primarily towards the German Government in light of its role in the international arena, particularly within [[the European Union]] (EU), at intergovernmental level via its bilateral and multilateral cooperation, and in the United Nations context.\n\n====New impetus for climate policy: Making the most of Germany's dual presidency (2007)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2007\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-5/ Policy Paper 2007], \u201eNew impetus for climate policy: Making the most of Germany's dual presidency.\u201c</ref>====\n\nIf dangerous climate change is still to be avoided, a reversal of current trends must be achieved within the next ten years, and greenhouse gas emissions worldwide must be halved by 2050 compared with a 1990 baseline. However, there is a widening gap between the action that is urgently needed and current climate policy. The WBGU is therefore convinced that a new climate policy dynamic is required worldwide and that Germany's double presidency of the European Union and P of G8 offers a dual opportunity to drive climate protection forward. The WBGU's core messages are:\n*Climate protection is both worthwhile and feasible: Investing in climate protection is economically efficient, as the costs of effective climate protection are far lower than the costs of inaction.\n*Further development of the UN climate convention: A consensus on the mitigation target must be forged and enshrined in the convention. To this end, the WBGU recommends the adoption of a global temperature guard rail limiting the rise in near-surface air temperature to a maximum of 2&nbsp;\u00b0C relative to the pre-industrial value \u2013 equivalent to stabilizing the concentration of greenhouse gases below 450 ppm CO2eq.\n*Making the most of the G8 Summit at Heiligendamm: Fresh initiatives from the heads of state and government are required to inject new life into the faltering climate process.\n*Reaffirming the European Union's leading role: The European Union should expand its leading role in international climate protection.\n\n====Development needs Environmental Protection: Recommendations for the Millennium + 5 Summit (2005)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2005\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-4/ Policy Paper 2005], \u201eDevelopment needs Environmental Protection: Recommendations for the Millennium + 5 Summit.\u201c</ref>====\nThe Millennium + 5 Summit will review progress towards the achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) and take stock of the United Nations' capacity to act. The Summit offers the opportunity to set a new course in international poverty reduction and initiate a reform of the UN. If the MDGs fail, international cooperation will be plunged into crisis. Yet the current poverty debate tends to overlook the environmental problems which exacerbate poverty in many developing countries. The international community should therefore remind itself of the message sent out by the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992: environmental and development policies are inextricably linked. WBGU's core recommendations are:\n*Linking poverty reduction with environmental policy: The MDGs cannot be achieved without environmental protection measures. Environmental policy is therefore a prerequisite for development and must be a key element in any long-term poverty reduction strategy. Conversely, the global environment cannot be protected without development policy.\n*Forging strategic partnerships with anchor countries: Due to their size and dynamic economies, developing countries such as China, Brazil and India play a key role both in global environmental changes and in poverty reduction. The strategic foci of development cooperation with these countries must be placed accordingly.\n*Reforming the development and environment policy architecture: The division of labour in international development policy should be improved and the fragmentation of the multilateral development and environment institutions overcome. In the medium term, a new Council on Global Development and Environment should replace the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC).\n*Increasing the funding commitments: The international community should invest more intensively in poverty reduction and environmental protection: the costs of inaction would be significantly higher. As well as increasing funds committed to development cooperation, new financing instruments, such as charges for the use of global common goods, should be introduced.\n\n====Renewable energies for sustainable development: Impulses for renewables 2004<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2004\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-3/ Policy Paper 2004], \u201eRenewable energies for sustainable development: Impulses for renewables.\u201c</ref>====\n\nEnergy is a key theme for future world development. Worldwide energy demand is mounting rapidly, particularly in the developing and newly industrialising countries, which seek to catch up with the level of economic development attained by industrialised countries. The great challenge now is to meet this energy demand in a sustainable manner. However, sustainable development will be inconceivable without a deep-seated reconfiguration of worldwide energy systems. One goal in this context must be to protect natural life-support systems and, in particular, to prevent dangerous anthropogenic perturbation of the climate system. If the present path continues and rising energy demand is met mainly from fossil sources, this would trigger intolerable global climate change with high consequential costs, and would thus also jeopardize economic development. A second necessary goal is to eradicate energy poverty in developing countries in order that these countries can make use of development opportunities. It is essential that 2.4&nbsp;billion people gain access to modern forms of energy so that they can shake off the yoke of energy poverty. To attain these two goals, energy systems need to be turned towards sustainability. To that end, efficiency must be improved at all levels of the energy system, and fossil energy sources must be substituted by renewable ones. The potential of renewable energies, above all solar energy, is almost unlimited and can be harnessed sustainably. Energy system transformation towards sustainability is thus the first step into the solar age. However, without rapid and resolute international policy support, the expansion of renewable energy sources will not be able to develop the necessary dynamics in time. The International Conference for Renewable Energies (renewables 2004) held in Bonn 2004 is a milestone for this process.\n\n====Charging the Use of Global Commons (2002)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2002\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-2/ Policy Paper 2002], \u201eCharging the Use of Global Commons.\u201c</ref>====\nIn this policy paper, the WBGU summarizes the key findings of its special report on user charges within the framework of global sustainability policy, and makes recommendations for a politically viable implementation of the concept of global user charges for three specific areas of application:\n*  Charges on the use of airspace by aviation,\n*  Charges on the use of the oceans by shipping,\n*  Payments for non utilization obligations.\n\n====The Johannesburg Opportunity: Key Elements of a Negotiation Strategy (2001)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2001\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-1/ Policy Paper 2001], \u201eThe Johannesburg Opportunity: Key Elements of a Negotiation Strategy.\u201c</ref>====\nJohannesburg in South Africa is a symbolically important venue for the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD). No other continent has been affected worse by the impacts of global change and exhibits in such representative form the critical environmental and socioeconomic situation facing many developing countries. At the same time, the host nation epitomizes new hopes and beginnings following the radical changes it has undergone in recent years. A new beginning is necessary at the international level, too, given the further deterioration in the state of the global environment since the 1992 [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro. New problems have arisen and the most critical remain unsolved. The WSSD to be held in September 2002 in Johannesburg provides the international community with yet another opportunity to set the future direction of international environment and development policy. In the run-up to this event, the WBGU would like to focus the attention of the Federal Government of Germany on some crucial issues where decisions in Johannesburg could help to eliminate critical shortcomings in current environment and development policy. A great deal has been achieved in the field of global environmental policymaking since 1992, in particular the international conventions and treaties dealing with a range of global environmental problems such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, desertification, or the impacts of persistent organic pollutants. In the view of the WBGU, the Johannesburg summit should therefore refrain from detailed negotiations on these topics. However, it must be possible to provide new ideas and inspiration, to close gaps and loopholes, and to take the various conventions a stage further\n\n== Quotes about WBGU reports ==\n\n\"The reports of the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) are an indispensable reference and resource on global environmental change policies. Every scientist, decision-maker and institution concerned with the pressing issue of environment and development should have them.\"\n\nProf. Dr. [[Klaus T\u00f6pfer]], Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 1998-2006\n\n\"Humanity on the move: Unlocking the transformative power of cities, is a notable breath of fresh air at a time when shallow platitudes seem the order of the day. It is bold, meticulously crafted through argument (as opposed to assertion) and evidence, and rooted in a highly original conceptual framework that is both global in scope and differentiated. The report asserts the centrality of cultural and institutional change and does not shy away from being specific and programmatic at a moment when it seems that political discourses are increasingly disconnected from our highly fractious, unsustainable, violent and intolerant times. I recommend it as compulsory reading in the strongest possible terms.\"\n\nProfessor [[Edgar Pieterse]], Director \u2013 African Centre for Cities (University of Cape Town) & Chairperson of the Cities Alliance Think Tank.\n\n\u201eThe new WBGU-Study \u201eA Social Contract for Sustainability\u201d appears at a time in which people around the world are increasingly committed to creating a future that is both sustainable and climate-safe. The study shows that such a future will only be possible if governments, business and  civil society collectively set the right course, making the most of regional, national and global cooperation. An important call to cross-cutting integrated action, the book deserves wide recognition.\u201c\n\n[[Christiana Figueres]], Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (2010-2016)\n\n\"The geopolitical world is changing beyond recognition. The challenge of ensuring that in the future people can live better than today, while doing so within the Planetary Boundaries has yet to be met.  Markets and the environment are increasingly globalized.  Social protection and the search for equity are not, though there are interesting signs of change.  There are many international institutions, but few are global.  We have known for some time the necessary individual solutions required for the transition.  Now, the WBGU report `World in Transition \u2013 A Social Contract for Sustainability\u00b4 offers us extremely interesting ideas on how we can bring all this together collectively through a new social contract that is global, equitable and green, and requires a new kind of global citizenship: the first steps toward a global political project for global sustainability.\"\n\n[[Janos Pasztor]], Executive Secretary UN Secretary-General's High-level Panel on Global Sustainability 2010-12\n\n\u201cThe `World in Transition \u2013 Governing the Marine Heritage\u00b4 report presents a thought provoking look at crucial aspects of oceans governance. It resonates strongly with our thinking in the World Bank and among the partners of the Global Partnership for Oceans. Nation states, civil society and industry need to work together to support more sustainable and productive ocean use. This report makes a valuable contribution to global thinking on how best we might secure a sustainable future from healthy oceans.\u201d\n\n[[Rachel Kyte]], Vice President, Sustainable Development, The World Bank (2014-2015)\n\n\"Biofuels have been represented by some as a silver bullet to the climate change threat, and by others as a fatal mistake set to destroy forests and increase hunger; they are neither. Sane and sensibly developed they offer a chance to reduce emissions, generate employment and diversify rural livelihoods. But widespread commercialisation without proper sustainability standards could prove a disaster, causing more environmental and human harm than good. The new WBGU report shows that a sustainable use of bioenergy is possible and outlines how opportunities can be exploited while at the same time minimizing risks. The report thus offers policy-makers valuable guidance for a sustainable bioenergy policy.\"\n\n[[Achim Steiner]], Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (2006-2016)\n\n\"With Climate Change as a Security Risk, WBGU has compiled a flagship report on an issue that quite rightly is rising rapidly up the international political agenda. The authors pull no punches on the likelihood of increasing tensions and conflicts in a climatically constrained world and spotlight places where possible conflicts may flare up in the 21st century unless climate change is checked. The report makes it clear that climate policy is preventative security policy.\"\n\n[[Achim Steiner]], Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (2006-2016)\n\n\u201eWith its interdisciplinary approach, providing a complex and systematic analysis of the poverty-environment nexus, WBGU's latest report breaks new ground. Indira Gandhi's old, convenient maxim was 'Poverty is the biggest polluter'. Put forward at the 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm, it has been sorely misused ever since to override environmental precaution and prioritize economic development strategies instead. The new WBGU report maps out a way to shape a coherent environment and development policy. This report revitalizes the Rio spirit and gives it a robust scientific base\u201c\n\n[[Ernst Ulrich von Weizs\u00e4cker]], Member of the German Bundestag 1998-2005.\n\n\"The publication of 'World in Transition: Towards Sustainable Energy Systems' is timely indeed. The World Summit on Sustainable Development gave great attention to this challenge, but failed to agree on a quantitative, time-bound target for the introduction of renewable energy sources. The German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) has now produced a report with a global focus; this is essential in view of the global impacts of climatic changes. The report provides a convincing long-term analysis; this, too, is essential, for global energy policies must take a long-term perspective, over a time frame of 50 to 100 years, while providing concrete guidance for decision makers to be implemented now. There is an urgent need to identify paths by which to secure energy supply for the 2.4 billion people who still depend upon traditional biomass, while keeping clearly in view the need to combine this challenge with the prevention of perilous climatic changes. Our one world must close the gap between industrialized countries\u2019 surfeit and developing countries\u2019 poverty. Policies will need to consider both the broader environmental and specific climate exigencies.

In the short term, the aim is to harmonize digitalization with the global sustainability goals agreed in 2015 (SDGs, Agenda 2030) and the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. New technologies should be used specifically and comprehensively to give people access to basic services such as healthcare, education, energy and (environmental) information and to prevent environmental degradation. Examples include promoting the energy-system transformation using intelligent energy networks, reducing vehicular traffic in cities by means of shared mobility (which makes owning a car superfluous), and using digital technologies to promote a [[circular economy]]. In addition, precautions must already be taken today to deal with the profound societal upheavals that will accompany digitalization in the medium term. Examples include the foreseeable radical structural change on the labour markets, the replacement of real-world experiences in virtual spaces, the manifold impacts of artificial intelligence on education, science and democracy, and the challenge of democratically restricting the surveillance potential of new technologies. According to the WBGU's new report, all digital changes should be geared towards the common good and improving people's quality of life. Finally, another issue is preparing for possible long-term upheavals. For example, in human-machine interaction, risks to human integrity are already recognizable today. This concerns, for example, sensitive neuro-data or neuro-prostheses, whose ethical aspects have been insufficiently taken into account up to now. In the age of digitalization, it is necessary to redefine our understanding of 'human development\u2018.\n\n====Humanity on the move: The transformative power of cities (2016)<ref>[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2016-urbanization/ Flagship report 2016], \u201eHumanity on the move: The transformative power of cities\u201c</ref>====\nThe momentum of urbanization and its impacts are so massive that we must face up to this trend. In view of the existing cognitive, technical, economic and institutional path dependencies, a policy of business as usual \u2013 i.e. an unstructured, quasi-automatic urbanization \u2013 would lead to a non-sustainable \u2018world cities society\u2019. Only if cities and urban societies are sufficiently empowered can they make use of the opportunities for sustainability and successfully follow the urban transformation pathways. The success or failure of the Great Transformation will be decided in the cities. The WBGU discusses the relevant conditions for the success of this transformation in this report.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Governing the Marine Heritage (2013)<ref>[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2013-oceans/ Flagship report 2013], \u201eWorld in Transition: Governing the Marine Heritage.\u201c</ref>====\nDespite numerous international treaties and voluntary commitments, the seas are still being massively overfished, polluted and increasingly exploited as the Earth's last resort. In view of the oceans\u2019 poor condition, the WBGU developed a long-term vision of the conservation and sustainable use of the blue continent: All marine zones with the exception of territorial waters should be declared as common heritage of mankind. In order to move closer to this ultimate goal for [[ocean governance]], the WBGU also gives recommendations for action that link up with ongoing political processes, especially for two focal themes: food ([[sustainable fisheries]] and [[aquaculture]]) and energy from the sea. The report shows that sustainable stewardship of the oceans is urgently necessary, that the seas can be incorporated into a transformation towards a low-carbon, sustainable society, and that such a transformation can achieve substantial benefits worldwide both for a sustainable energy supply and for food security.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 A Social Contract for Sustainability (2011)<ref>[http://www.wbgu.de/wbgu_jg2011_en/ Flagship report 2011], \u201eWorld in Transition: A Social Contract for Sustainability.\u201c</ref>====\n\nIn this report, the WBGU explains the reasons for the desperate need for a post-fossil economic strategy, yet it also concludes that the transition to sustainability is achievable, and presents ten concrete packages of measures to accelerate the imperative restructuring. If the transformation really is to succeed, we have to enter into a social contract for innovation, in the form of a new kind of discourse between governments and citizens, both within and beyond the boundaries of the nation state.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Future Bioenergy and Sustainable Land Use (2008)<ref>[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2008-bioenergy/ Flagship report 2008], \u201eWorld in Transition: Future Bioenergy and Sustainable Land Use.\u201c</ref>====\nIn view of the major opportunities and risks associated with it, and the complexity of the subject, bioenergy policy has in a short time become a challenging political task for regulators and planners \u2013 a task which can only be accomplished through worldwide cooperation and the creation of an international framework. WBGU's central message is that use should be made of the sustainable potential of bioenergy which can be tapped all over the world, provided that risks to sustainability are excluded. In particular, the use of bioenergy must not endanger food security or the goals of nature conservation and climate change mitigation.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013  Climate Change as a Security Risk (2007)<ref name=\"Flagship report 2007\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2007-security/ Flagship report 2007] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216130144/http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2007-security/ |date=2017-12-16 }}, \u201eWorld in Transition: Climate Change as a Security Risk.\u201c</ref>====\nWithout resolute counteraction, climate change will overstretch many societies\u2019 adaptive capacities within the coming decades. This could result in destabilization and violence, jeopardizing national and international security to a new degree. However, climate change could also unite the international community, provided that it recognizes climate change as a threat to humankind and soon sets the course for the avoidance of dangerous anthropogenic climate change by adopting a dynamic and globally coordinated climate policy. If it fails to do so, climate change will draw ever-deeper lines of division and conflict in international relations, triggering numerous conflicts between and within countries over the distribution of resources, especially water and land, over the management of migration, or over compensation payments between the countries mainly responsible for climate change and those countries most affected by its destructive effects. That is the backdrop against which WBGU, in this flagship report, summarizes the state-of-the-art of science on the subject of \u201cClimate Change as a Security Risk\u201d. It is based on the findings of research into environmental conflicts, the causes of war, and of climate impact research. It appraises past experience but also ventures to cast a glance far into the future in order to assess the likely impacts of climate change on societies, nation-states, regions and the international system.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Fighting Poverty through Environmental Policy (2004)<ref name=\"Flagship report 2004\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2004-poverty/ Flagship report 2004], \u201eWorld in Transition: Fighting Poverty through Environmental Policy.\u201c</ref>====\nAt the start of the 21st century, fighting poverty and protecting the environment are two of the most urgent challenges facing the international community. Narrowing the massive disparities in the satisfaction of basic needs and distribution of prosperity must be a primary objective. Extreme poverty, such as that prevailing above all in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and South Asia, is the most obvious manifestation of the untenable imbalance in the world's social system. The recommendations for action set out in this report are based on an analysis of the systemic links between poverty (income poverty, disease, malnutrition, and lack of education, social stability and social capital) and environmental changes (climate change, lack of water resources, [[water pollution]], [[soil degradation]], loss of [[biological diversity]] and resources, and air pollution). The manifestations of and interactions between poverty and environmental problems are investigated in their various forms. This type of integrated analysis is nothing new; what is new, however, is the consistent linking of a holistic approach with the following key questions: which institutional arrangements offer ways of coping with these problems, and where must gaps be closed? To this end, WBGU has evaluated major international political processes and developed recommendations on policy coherence. It also presents various recommendations on further research to identify the strategic gaps in theoretical and practical knowledge.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Towards Sustainable Energy Systems (2003)<ref name=\"Flagship report 2003\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2003-energy/ Flagship report 2003], \u201eWorld in Transition: Towards Sustainable Energy Systems.\u201c</ref>====\nThe report underscores the urgent need to transform global energy systems so that the world's population has access to energy based on renewable sources. This is necessary in order to protect the global climate and to liberate 2.4&nbsp;billion people in developing countries from energy poverty. Such an approach would also yield a peace dividend by reducing dependence upon regionally concentrated oil reserves. The scientists stress that such a reconfiguration of energy systems is feasible and fundable if rapid and resolute action is taken in the coming two decades. To this end, they propose a roadmap with specific milestones.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 New Structures for Global Environmental Policy (2000)<ref name=\"Flagship report 2001\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2000-institutions/ Flagship report 2000], \u201eWorld in Transition: New Structures for Global Environmental Policy.\u201c</ref>====\nToday, more than 900 bi- and multilateral environmental treaties are in force. Nonetheless, the most pressing problems of global change remain unresolved, some are even intensifying. The international institutional and organisational architecture has proven too weak to provide effective and efficient responses to these challenges. In this situation, the WBGU has developed a vision for reforming the United Nations in the environmental arena. It terms this the \u2018Earth Alliance\u2019, comprising three interlocking realms. First, to provide authority in the assessment of environmental problems, the WBGU proposes establishing an independent body whose task is to provide timely warning of particularly risk-laden developments in the sphere of global change \u2013 Earth Assessment. Second, the report gives recommendations for redesigning the organisational core of global environmental policy \u2013 [[Earth Organisation]]. This revolves around the step-wise establishment of an International Environmental Organisation, building on the existing [[United Nations Environment Programme]] as its initial nucleus. Third, the WBGU highlights new avenues for financing global environmental policy \u2013 Earth Funding.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013  Conservation and Sustainable Use of the Biosphere (1999)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1999\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1999-biosphere/ Flagship report 1999], \u201eWorld in Transition: Conservation and Sustainable Use of the Biosphere.\u201c</ref>====\nBiodiversity - the planet's natural capital - is undergoing a dramatic collapse: its 'Sixth Extinction'. The losses, which are due to human activities and overexploitation of the biosphere, are irreversible. They are undermining the basis of future wellbeing and prosperity - including genetic resources and food production, climate stability, and coastal and soil protection. This volume presents an authoritative and alarming analysis of the state of the biosphere. The WBGU shows that the time remaining for remedial action is disappearing fast and sets out a range of initiatives to be undertaken at different levels. The main recommendations are:\n- protecting 10-20 per cent of the global land area\n- an 'Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity' to provide scientific advice\n- conservation of the diversity of cultivated as well as wild plant species\n- extending bioregional management and nature sponsorship\n- greater multilateral co-operation and implementation of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Strategies for Managing Global Environmental Risks (1998)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1998\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1998-global-risks/ Flagship report 1998], \u201eWorld in Transition: Strategies for Managing Global Environmental Risks.\u201c</ref>====\nGlobal risk potentials and their interplay with economic, social and ecological processes of change have emerged as a challenge to the international community. Never before has human intervention in nature assumed global dimensions. This has been driven on the one hand by a growing global population, particularly in developing countries, and on the other hand by rising human demands in conjunction with specific patterns of production and consumption, above all in industrialised countries. By presenting this report, the WBGU hopes to contribute constructively to an effective, efficient and objective management of the risks of global change. The approach taken by the WBGU is first to classify globally relevant risks and then to assign to these classes of risk both established and innovative risk assessment strategies and risk management tools. On this basis, management priorities can be set. However, the WBGU notes that it is impossible to safeguard against all global risks, particularly as exploiting opportunities will always entail taking risks.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Ways Towards Sustainable Management of Freshwater Resources (1997)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1997\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1997-water/ Flagship report 1997], \u201eWorld in Transition: Ways Towards Sustainable Management of Freshwater Resources.\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe global water crisis is expected to become more severe in the near future. The WBGU presents an analysis of specific regions that are presently most affected by water shortages, and regions that will be particularly threatened by future water crises. In line with its past reports on global change, the WBGU examines three major \"syndromes of global change\" that are strongly linked to the worldwide water crisis. Based on this analysis, explicit recommendations for future research and for political action are presented.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 The Research Challenge  (1996)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1996\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1996-research/ Flagship report 1996], \u201eWorld in Transition: The Research Challenge.\u201c</ref>====\nDevelopment and environment problems have reached such alarming dimensions that the very survival of humanity is now subject to critical and unprecedented threats. So far, the scientific community has failed to deliver strategic responses adequate to this situation. Analyses produced by the separate disciplines are similarly inadequate due to the complexity of the problems involved and the intricate interlinkages between them. In this report, the WBGU criticizes Germany's global change research community for its lack of international orientation, its bias towards individual disciplines and for its weaknesses in translating scientific results into a form readily accessible to policymakers. The WBGU identifies alternatives for restructuring the research landscape, focusing primarily on a new \"Syndrome Approach\" for global change research. By applying this tool, scientists can systematically describe and analyze the \"diseases\" afflicting the Earth System, and thus elaborate response options. The 16 most important syndromes, or \"clinical profiles\" of Planet Earth were identified.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Ways Towards Global Environmental Solutions (1995)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1995\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1995-global-policy/ Flagship report 1995], \u201eWorld in Transition: Ways Towards Global Environmental Solutions.\u201c</ref>====\nIn many areas of global change solutions are not at sight. However, dedicated and immediate action could, in principle, avert irreversible or disastrous damage to the global environment. Whether these steps will actually be taken will have to be seen, since substantial efforts and significant reorientations at the local, national and global level are necessary.\n\nTwo aspects have to be considered: on the one hand, at the societal level, the prerequisites for solving global environmental problems have to be improved. These measures present a challenge to nations and societies as a whole, where nongovernmental organisations could also play an important role. On the other hand, at the governmental level, international agreements must be formulated or intensified and enforced by suitable measures.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 The Threat to Soils (1994)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1994\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1994-soils/ Flagship report 1994], \u201eWorld in Transition: The Threat to Soils.\u201c</ref>====\nSoils form an essential basis for humanity, but have received too little attention to date. In differing respects, human activities in many parts of the world lead to various levels of soil degradation, from declining fertility to irreversible destruction. Many local processes culminate to form a global environmental trend that must be counteracted by political action as a matter of urgency. The fact that the slow destruction of soils is a process barely perceptible to human senses has meant in turn that this topic is dealt with in the environmental debate as a somewhat marginal issue. Therefore, the threat to soils must be accorded much greater significance on the environmental agenda - improved legal frameworks must be created, both nationally and internationally, for soils as an environmental asset. The report is divided into two sections. The first section (standard section) presents and comments on new developments in various fields of Global Change. The second section of the report (focus section) deals with the global threat to soils. The WBGU emphasises that, in view of the seriousness of the soil problems outlined in this report, a new efficient institutional framework should now be established. For this reason the German Federal Government should decide in principle whether a differentiated \"Soil Declaration\" suffices or whether a global \"Soil Convention\" has to be striven for. This report provides the relevant arguments for both instruments. Global soil protection must obtain a similar attention on the international agenda as has been achieved for climate policy.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013  Basic Structure of Global People-Environment Interactions (1993)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1993\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1993-people-environment/ Flagship report 1993], \u201eWorld in Transition: Basic Structure of Global People-Environment Interactions.\u201c</ref>====\nIn this report, the WBGU endeavours to provide a holistic analysis of the Earth System, whereby the central focus is directed at the principal interactions between nature and society. The aim here is to demonstrate the complexity of environmental problems, on the one hand, and to create, on the other, the analytical basis for assessing the impact of current trends on the system as a whole. The most serious global problems and major global trends in the estimation of the WBGU are:\n\n* Growth of the world's population\n* Long-term changes in the composition of the atmosphere\n* Loss of biodiversity\n* Degradation and loss of soils\n\nConcluding its report, the WBGU lays particular emphasis on three general recommendations:\n- German development aid should be increased to 1% of the GNP, whereby the term 'developing countries' should be redefined to include the states of Eastern Europe.\n- With respect to the instruments discussed in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the WBGU recommends that negotiations concerning a certificate scheme for reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions should be started, with the aim of achieving its international implementation. Parallel to the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that would then occur, efforts should be made to increase the financial transfers for the protection of the tropical forests.\n- Programmes should be developed aiming at sensitising citizens to global environmental problems and promoting environmentally friendly behaviour.\n\n===Special Reports===\n\n====Development and justice through transformation: The Four Big \u2018I\u2019s  (2016)<ref name=\"Special Report 2016\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2016-g20/ Special report 2016], \u201eDevelopment and justice through transformation: The Four Big \u2018I\u2019s \u201c</ref>====\n2015 saw a historic double success for sustainability and climate policy. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the Paris Agreement on climate protection establish a system of ambitious policy goals for the world. The group of twenty major industrialized and emerging economies (G20) now needs to resolutely advance implementation of both agreements, seizing the opportunity of this \u2018Great Transformation\u2019 to sustainability as a unique modernization project that could offer substantial economic development opportunities. Complete decarbonization of the world economy, which is necessary to avoid the gravest climate risks, can only be achieved by profoundly transforming energy systems and other high-emissions infrastructures. This transformation could inspire Innovation and channel Investment into sustainability and climate protection, and into the kinds of sustainable Infrastructures that need to be established and expanded. At the same time, the transformation could combat inequality and promote Inclusion within societies and globally, thus becoming an equity project.\n\n====Climate Protection as a World Citizen Movement (2014)<ref name=\"Special Report 2014\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2014-climate-protection/ Special report 2014], \u201eClimate Protection as a World Citizen Movement\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) makes it unmistakably clear: unacceptable climatic consequences, which are likely to escalate beyond the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C guard rail, can only be avoided if further increases in greenhouse-gas concentrations are halted as soon as possible. The WBGU therefore recommends reducing CO2 emissions from fossil fuels to zero by 2070 at the latest. This policy goal is both ambitious and incisive, because 'the zero target must be reached' by every country, every municipality, every company and every citizen if the world as a whole is to become climate-neutral. However, the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C line can only be held if a large proportion of stakeholders \u2013 especially the OECD countries \u2013 start reducing their emissions much earlier. Global society as a whole has only a very limited carbon budget at its disposal; emissions should therefore peak by 2020 if possible, or in the third decade at the latest. In this report the WBGU outlines a two-pronged strategy for global climate protection based on interaction between multilateralism and civil society. To achieve this, on the one hand the Paris Climate Agreement targeted for late 2015 should exhibit certain characteristics set out by the WBGU. In particular, a process should be agreed to ensure compliance with the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C guard rail. On the other hand, all social actors should make their specific contributions towards decarbonization. In this way, an intricate responsibility architecture for the future of our planet can emerge in which vertical delegating and horizontal engagement are not contradictions, but complementary factors that reinforce each other.\n\n====Solving the climate dilemma: The budget approach (2009)<ref name=\"Special Report 2009\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2009-budget-approach/ Special report 2009], \u201eSolving the climate dilemma: The budget approach.\u201c</ref>====\n\nAt their meeting in the Italian city of L\u2019Aquila in July 2009, the heads of state and governments of the G8 countries and the [[Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate]] (MEF), whose members include India, Brazil and China, acknowledged the importance that [[global warming]] must not exceed the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C guard rail if dangerous climate change is to be avoided. WBGU views this as an extremely important step towards the adoption of a binding international agreement which establishes a well-founded target for global climate protection. The task now is to build on this consensus and reach agreement, at [[Copenhagen]], on a follow-up treaty to the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which is due to expire in 2012. This new international agreement should translate the relevant scientific knowledge into a fair and practicable global strategy to combat global warming. So far, however, the lack of unanimity between the countries involved in the negotiating process has meant that there is no clear leitmotif pointing the way towards such an agreement.\n\n====The Future Oceans: Warming Up, Rising High, Turning Sour (2006)<ref name=\"Special report 2006\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2006-the-future-oceans/ Special report 2006], \u201eThe Future Oceans \u2013 Warming Up, Rising High, Turning Sour.\u201c</ref>====\nLatest research findings show that failure to check mankind's emissions of carbon dioxide will have severe consequences for the world's oceans. The marine environment is doubly affected: continuing warming and ongoing acidification both pose threats. In combination with over-fishing, these two threats are further jeopardizing already weakened fish stocks. Sea-level rise is exposing coastal regions to mounting flood and hurricane risks. To keep the adverse effects on human society and ecosystems within manageable limits, it will be essential to adopt new coastal protection approaches, designate marine protected areas and agree on ways to deal with refugees from endangered coastal areas. All such measures, however, can only succeed if global warming and ocean acidification are combated vigorously. Ambitious climate protection is therefore a key precondition to successful marine conservation and coastal protection.\n\n====Climate Protection Strategies for the 21st Century. Kyoto and Beyond (2003)<ref name=\"Special report 2003\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2003-kyoto-and-beyond/ Special report 2003], \u201eClimate Protection Strategies for the 21st Century. Kyoto and Beyond.\u201c</ref>====\nWith this special report, the WBGU provides recommendations for future negotiations within the context of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), particularly relating to the Kyoto Protocol to the Convention. The report centres on three questions:\n*What is \u2018dangerous climate change\u2019 within the meaning of Article 2 of the UNFCCC?\n*Which socio-economically and technologically viable pathways are available to prevent such dangerous climate change?\n*How can all countries be integrated equitably within a system of emissions reduction commitments?\nThe report concentrates on the potentials to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide, this being the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas. The analysis focuses, on the one hand, on the economic and technological potentials to reduce energy and industry related emissions and, on the other hand, on the relevance of biological sinks of carbon dioxide and the options to preserve them. Finally, based on this analysis, the report contains specific recommendations on ways to shape political and economic instruments in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.\n\n====Charging the Use of Global Commons (2002)<ref name=\"Special report 2002\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2002-charging-the-use/ Special report 2002], \u201eCharging the Use of Global Commons.\u201c</ref>====\nGlobal common resources like international airspace and the high seas are in danger of overexploitation because the users need not bear the full social costs of their actions. The CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions of international aviation and of shipping are not subject to the quantitative reduction obligations of the Kyoto Protocol. Imposing user charges can close this regulatory gap and induce environment-related incentive effects to reduce environmental damage. Moreover, additional financial resources are generated, which should be earmarked for the protection and conservation of global common goods. In this special report, the WBGU makes recommendations for a politically viable implementation of the concept of global user charges for three specific areas of application:\n*   Charges on the use of airspace by aviation,\n*   Charges on the use of the oceans by shipping,\n*   Payments for non utilisation obligations.\n\n====Environment and Ethics (1999)<ref name=\"Special report 1999\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-1999-environment-and-ethics/ Special report 1999], \u201eEnvironment and Ethics.\u201c</ref>====\nShould people be allowed to do everything they want? Should humankind be allowed to use nature and the environment completely for its own ends? More and more people are questioning the limits of human intervention in nature. What is ethically allowed and what should be prohibited? The WBGU offers some answers to these difficult questions. At the same time it has drawn up a number of principles, which should not be violated, even where there are big economical gains. In addition, in a democratic and culturally diverse society it is the task of ethics to lay down generally binding criteria for balancing between nature-related and, for example, economic matters. With these tools of ethical and economic criteria the [[Federal Government of Germany]] could support the interests of environmental protection at the international level.\n\n====The Accounting of Biological Sinks and Sources Under the Kyoto Protocol: A Step Forwards or Backwards for Global Environmental Protection? (1998)<ref name=\"Special report 1998\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-1998-kyoto/ Special report 1998], \u201eThe Accounting of Biological Sinks and Sources Under the Kyoto Protocol: A Step Forwards or Backwards for Global Environmental Protection?.\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe WBGU assesses the Kyoto Protocol with respect to the accounting of biological sources and sinks. In principle, the WBGU supports the idea of linking climate protection and the conservation of sinks. However, the WBGU considers the form in which biological sources and sinks are accounted in the Kyoto Protocol to be inadequate and in need of improvement if the objectives of climate protection and biodiversity conservation are both to be served. The present accounting approach can lead to incentives with negative impacts upon climate protection, biodiversity conservation and soil protection. In addition, many uncertainties and imponderables attach to the reduction in net emissions that is achievable by means of terrestrial sinks. Even slight climate changes can lead to sinks becoming sources. Over the long run, fossil fuel emissions can not be compensated for by the terrestrial biosphere. The WBGU analyses the provisions of the Kyoto-Protocol and presents the state of knowledge on the source and sink potentials of terrestrial ecosystems and on the existing uncertainties and unresolved issues. This forms the basis for an assessment of the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol as well as for recommendations for the interpretation and concrete application of these provisions.\n\n====Targets for Climate Protection 1997<ref name=\"Special report 1997\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-1997-climate-protection/ Special report 1997], \u201eTargets for Climate Protection.\u201c</ref>====\nThis statement was issued on the occasion of the Third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the Climate Convention, FCCC), and contains recommendations on the commitments to be agreed upon in a protocol to the Convention. According to the \"Berlin Mandate\" adopted at the first Conference of the Parties, the commitments of the industrialized countries listed in Annex I of the Climate Convention are to be strengthened by setting quantified limitation and reduction objectives within specified time frames for their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These measures are aimed at achieving the ultimate objective of the FCCC, namely a \"stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\".\n\n====Scenario for the derivation of global CO<sub>2</sub>-reduction targets and implementation strategies (1995)<ref name=\"Special report 1995\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-1995-co2-reduction/ Special report 1995], \u201eScenario for the derivation of global CO<sub>2</sub>-reduction targets and implementation strategies.\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe WBGU derives a global CO<sub>2</sub> reduction target by using an \"inverse scenario\" based on simplified models for climate dynamics and [[The Carbon Cycle|the carbon cycle]]. By first analysing the maximum stress levels caused by climate change that one can assume to be ecologically and economically bearable, a \"tolerance window\" for the future climatic development is deduced. In a further step, the set of admissible emission profiles is determined, i.e., those global CO<sub>2</sub> emission functions which keep the climate system within the demarcated window. Among the so-defined family of emission options a specific strategy is finally singled out by feasibility criteria. The WBGU believes that such an integrated assessment of the climate change problem in the \"backwards mode\" has several advantages in comparison with the straightforward approach. It has to be emphasised, however, that the analysis employs a number of assumptions and approximations and therefore has the character of a \"[[Gedankenexperiment]]\".\n\n===Policy Papers===\n\n====A European Way to our Common Digital Future<ref name=\"Policy Paper 11, 2019\">[https://www.wbgu.de/en/publications/publication/pp11-2019 Policy Paper 11, 2019], \u201eA European Way to our Common Digital Future\u201c</ref>====\nParticularly during its presidency of the Council of the EU in 2020, Germany should build upon the Green Deal announced by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and work towards a close integration of digital change and sustainability. The new EU Parliament and the new European Commission should also pursue this goal. To this end the WBGU presents 7 cornerstones of a European way to a common digital future:\n\n# Integrate the opportunities and risks of digitalization into EU sustainability policy: The EU needs an implementation strategy for the SDGs that also places digital technologies at the service of sustainability and addresses its risks. In the same way, digitalization should be embedded in the 8th Environmental Action Programme from 2021 onwards. \n# Actively shape digital policy in line with sustainability goals: Ecological and social aimsthat can be reached through digitalization shouldbe pursued with equal emphasis, e.g. via the European Digital Agenda, the European Commission\u2019s Strategy for Artificial Intelligence (AI), or measures within the framework of the Digital Europe programme. Negative (side) effects should be identified and minimized at an early stage.\n# Involve the private sector more in the provision of data: Up to now, EU data policy has concentrated on the protection of personal data and the use of data from public authorities. This does not go far enough: accessibility to, and the re-use of (non-personal) private-sector data should also be improved in order to create data that can be used for the common good and digitalized (knowledge) assets. \n# Develop and apply artificial intelligence in a sustainable way: The EU should be consistent in following its value-based approach in the application and development of AI systems: fundamental rights, human dignity, environmental and sustainability principles are the normative foundation of the EU and non-negotiable. There is an urgent need for (framework) legislation on the development and handling of AI, since ethical guidelines and debates alone are not enough to ensure a corresponding development and application. In addition, research on explainable and secure, i.e. reliably verified and validated, AI should be promoted and used to ensure trustworthy, fair and accountable procedures.\n# Ensure access to digital commons and basic services through public-service information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures: Individual inclusion, personal development, environmental protection, fair competition and a functioning digital public sphere require access to data and services such as cloud services, mobility platforms or a search index. Their almost exclusively private-sector provision is not always in the interests of the common good. The EU\u2019s task should be to create or ensure public-service digital and digitalized infrastructures to make data and information accessible for the common good and to offer alternative (basic) services under public law.\n# Gear EU research policy and promotion of innovations consistently towards sustainability goals: Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) should be applied as an overarching concept of European research and innovation policy in order to explicitly embed the orientation towards sustainability goals and to avoid unintended impacts. The high levels of protection of the environment, consumers and occupational health and safety in the EU must not be weakened by the innovation principle currently under discussion. Horizon Europe\u2019s missions should aim to integrate digital change and the Transformation towards Sustainability and strengthen transformative and transformation research. \n# European digitalization model as a priority in foreign policy: The EU should also promote the integration of sustainability and digitalization internationally. It should initiate a summit on \u2018Sustainability in the Digital Age\u2019, e.g. for 2022, symbolically 30 years after the Earth Summit in Rio, to set the course for the necessary continuation of the sustainability agenda until 2030 and beyond.\n\n\n====Digital Momentum for the UN Sustainability Agenda in the 21st Century<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2019\">[https://www.wbgu.de/en/publications/publication/pp10-2019 Policy Paper 2019], \u201eDigital Momentum for the UN Sustainability Agenda in the 21st Century\u201c</ref>====\n\nGlobal digital change should be designed to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda with its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Up to now, hopes that digitalization would make a contribution to achieving these goals has not materialized. Only if digital change and the Transformation towards Sustainability are constructively interlinked can we make progress with environmental protection, climate-change mitigation and human development. The WBGU would like to introduce into the discussion four ideas directly related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). First: promote a global (environmental) awareness among people worldwide by providing a stronger future-proof education. The focus should be on enabling people to actively shape digital change and the Transformation towards Sustainability. Open data relating to sustainability and virtual learning environments are important elements for experiencing ecosystems. In concrete terms, an integrated programme for future-proof education should be developed, UN processes should be opened up to citizen-science projects, and an International Information Union should be founded to collect, process and publish sustainability-related data. Second, establish a digitally enhanced circular economy. The transition from linear and resource-intensive value chains to a near-complete circular economy is a key component of the Transformation towards Sustainability. Digital data acquisition and processing offer great potential for this. Environmentally harmful emissions and resource depletion should be recorded across all sectors of the economy and value chains, and greater efforts should be made to implement the 3Rs strategy (reduce, reuse, recycle) at the international level. Third, modernize sustainability policy itself by using digital solutions. Digitally enhanced governance can help improve the transparency of political actions, as well as the participation and worldwide networking of political actors. Coordination within the UN system should be intensified by establishing a 'UN Digitalization Initiative'; a 'UN Framework Convention on Digital Sustainability and Sustainable Digitalization' should be negotiated; and a globally uniform set of indicators for the SDGs should be developed to facilitate the comparability and verifiability of national reports. Fourth, further develop the global sustainability agenda beyond 2030 against the background of the opportunities and risks of the Digital Age. The UN should prepare for these future challenges in good time. The WBGU recommends convening a UN summit on 'Sustainability in the Digital Age' in 2022 \u2013 30 years after the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro \u2013 to set the course for continuing the sustainability agenda beyond 2030. A key outcome could be the adoption of a charter entitled 'Towards Our Common Digital Future'.\n\n====Just & In\u2013Time Climate Policy: Four Initiatives for Fairness (2018){{nnbsp}}<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2018\">{{cite book\n | author = WBGU\n | title = Just & in-time climate policy: four initiatives for a fair transformation \u2014 Policy paper 9\n | date = 20 July 2018\n | publisher = Scientific Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU)\n | location = Berlin, Germany\n | isbn = 978-3-936191-86-8\n | url = https://www.wbgu.de/fileadmin/user_upload/wbgu.de/templates/dateien/veroeffentlichungen/politikpapiere/pp2018-pp9/wbgu_policypaper_9.pdf\n | access-date = 2018-12-02\n}}  Translation from German.\n</ref>====\nLimiting global warming to well below 2&nbsp;\u00b0C requires the rapid decarbonization of the global economy. If this enterprise fails, we will jeopardize the life-support systems of future generations. The longer the transformation towards climate compatibility is delayed, the more severe the risks and damage will be for a growing number of people. The transformation requirements and the damage caused by climate change have an unequal temporal, geographical and social distribution \u2013 as do the respective possibilities for dealing with them. The WBGU therefore proposes a just & in-time transformation that takes into account all people affected, empowers them, holds those responsible for climate change accountable, and creates both global and national prospects for the future. The WBGU proposes that the German Federal Government should promote four exemplary initiatives of a just & in-time climate policy targeting (1) the people affected by the structural change towards climate compatibility (e.g. in coal-mining regions), (2) the legal rights of people harmed by climate change, (3) the dignified migration of people who lose their native countries due to climate change, and (4) the creation of financing instruments for just & in-time transformation processes.\n\n====Human progress within planetary guard rails. A contribution to the SDG debate (2014)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2014\">[https://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-8-2014-sdg/ Policy Paper 2014], \u201eHuman progress within planetary guard rails. A contribution to the SDG debate\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe year 2015 has special importance for the transformation towards sustainable development. New Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are then supposed to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The aim is to offer a new orientation for political action in the coming decades. The WBGU recommends orienting the new catalogue of goals towards the key message of the 1992 Earth Summit: that development and environmental protection must be considered together and do not contradict each other. The SDGs should not be reduced to poverty eradication, but must address all dimensions of sustainable development. In particular, global environmental change must be incorporated, otherwise even poverty eradication will become impossible. Up to now, too little attention has been paid to this link in the ongoing discourse on SDGs. Although many reports mention the concept of planetary guard rails or planetary boundaries, they do not back this up with specific targets. The WBGU presents recommendations on how guard rails for global environmental problems should be incorporated in the SDG catalogue and operationalized by means of corresponding targets.\n\n====Financing the Global Energy-System Transformation (2012)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2012\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policypaper-7/ Policy Paper 2012], \u201eFinancing the Global Energy System Transformation\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe world faces the challenge of a global transformation to sustainable energy systems. Substantial up-front investments are needed to improve energy efficiency and switch to renewable energies. At the same time, these investments offer great opportunities, because strategic innovations can be triggered and new markets can develop in the course of the transformation process. Savings on the cost of fossil fuels in conventional technologies could completely offset the investment in renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency by as early as 2040. The private capital needed for the transformation is available and can be mobilised if a suitable political framework is put into place. A corresponding regulatory policy should be introduced to make such investment more attractive for the private sector. The WBGU advocates a proactive state that integrates energy, environmental and climate policy; this could reduce existing investment risks by developing a stable, long-term transformative regulatory framework. At the same time, policy makers should expand the opportunities for participation. Germany is currently leading this transformation, both in terms of technological innovations and in the creation of a suitable policy framework. Our country is able to give the world an example of how the [[Energiewende]] (energy-system transformation) can generate more, not less prosperity.\n\n====Climate Policy Post-Copenhagen: A Three-Level Strategy for Success (2010)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2010\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policypaper-6/ Policy Paper 2010], \u201eClimate policy post-Copenhagen: Action at three levels offers prospect of success.\u201c</ref>====\n\nInternational climate policy post-Copenhagen is in crisis. There is currently no prospect of the comprehensive and binding UN climate treaty \u2013 the outcome hoped for at the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference \u2013 being achieved within the foreseeable future. However, in order to keep the global mean temperature rise below 2&nbsp;\u00b0C by the end of the century, a resolute course must be set in the international climate process within the next few years. The WBGU recommends that in order to revitalise the multilateral climate process, policy-makers and civil society in Europe take on a self-confident leading role in global alliances with selected \u2018climate pioneer\u2019 countries and that more intensive support be provided for civil society initiatives. The aim of establishing a binding international regime to limit CO<sub>2</sub> emissions \u2013 based, for example, on the WBGU's own budget approach and similar approaches now also being discussed in China and India \u2013 must remain in place. The following recommendations are directed primarily towards the German Government in light of its role in the international arena, particularly within [[the European Union]] (EU), at intergovernmental level via its bilateral and multilateral cooperation, and in the United Nations context.\n\n====New impetus for climate policy: Making the most of Germany's dual presidency (2007)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2007\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-5/ Policy Paper 2007], \u201eNew impetus for climate policy: Making the most of Germany's dual presidency.\u201c</ref>====\n\nIf dangerous climate change is still to be avoided, a reversal of current trends must be achieved within the next ten years, and greenhouse gas emissions worldwide must be halved by 2050 compared with a 1990 baseline. However, there is a widening gap between the action that is urgently needed and current climate policy. The WBGU is therefore convinced that a new climate policy dynamic is required worldwide and that Germany's double presidency of the European Union and P of G8 offers a dual opportunity to drive climate protection forward. The WBGU's core messages are:\n*Climate protection is both worthwhile and feasible: Investing in climate protection is economically efficient, as the costs of effective climate protection are far lower than the costs of inaction.\n*Further development of the UN climate convention: A consensus on the mitigation target must be forged and enshrined in the convention. To this end, the WBGU recommends the adoption of a global temperature guard rail limiting the rise in near-surface air temperature to a maximum of 2&nbsp;\u00b0C relative to the pre-industrial value \u2013 equivalent to stabilizing the concentration of greenhouse gases below 450 ppm CO2eq.\n*Making the most of the G8 Summit at Heiligendamm: Fresh initiatives from the heads of state and government are required to inject new life into the faltering climate process.\n*Reaffirming the European Union's leading role: The European Union should expand its leading role in international climate protection.\n\n====Development needs Environmental Protection: Recommendations for the Millennium + 5 Summit (2005)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2005\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-4/ Policy Paper 2005], \u201eDevelopment needs Environmental Protection: Recommendations for the Millennium + 5 Summit.\u201c</ref>====\nThe Millennium + 5 Summit will review progress towards the achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) and take stock of the United Nations' capacity to act. The Summit offers the opportunity to set a new course in international poverty reduction and initiate a reform of the UN. If the MDGs fail, international cooperation will be plunged into crisis. Yet the current poverty debate tends to overlook the environmental problems which exacerbate poverty in many developing countries. The international community should therefore remind itself of the message sent out by the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992: environmental and development policies are inextricably linked. WBGU's core recommendations are:\n*Linking poverty reduction with environmental policy: The MDGs cannot be achieved without environmental protection measures. Environmental policy is therefore a prerequisite for development and must be a key element in any long-term poverty reduction strategy. Conversely, the global environment cannot be protected without development policy.\n*Forging strategic partnerships with anchor countries: Due to their size and dynamic economies, developing countries such as China, Brazil and India play a key role both in global environmental changes and in poverty reduction. The strategic foci of development cooperation with these countries must be placed accordingly.\n*Reforming the development and environment policy architecture: The division of labour in international development policy should be improved and the fragmentation of the multilateral development and environment institutions overcome. In the medium term, a new Council on Global Development and Environment should replace the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC).\n*Increasing the funding commitments: The international community should invest more intensively in poverty reduction and environmental protection: the costs of inaction would be significantly higher. As well as increasing funds committed to development cooperation, new financing instruments, such as charges for the use of global common goods, should be introduced.\n\n====Renewable energies for sustainable development: Impulses for renewables 2004<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2004\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-3/ Policy Paper 2004], \u201eRenewable energies for sustainable development: Impulses for renewables.\u201c</ref>====\n\nEnergy is a key theme for future world development. Worldwide energy demand is mounting rapidly, particularly in the developing and newly industrialising countries, which seek to catch up with the level of economic development attained by industrialised countries. The great challenge now is to meet this energy demand in a sustainable manner. However, sustainable development will be inconceivable without a deep-seated reconfiguration of worldwide energy systems. One goal in this context must be to protect natural life-support systems and, in particular, to prevent dangerous anthropogenic perturbation of the climate system. If the present path continues and rising energy demand is met mainly from fossil sources, this would trigger intolerable global climate change with high consequential costs, and would thus also jeopardize economic development. A second necessary goal is to eradicate energy poverty in developing countries in order that these countries can make use of development opportunities. It is essential that 2.4&nbsp;billion people gain access to modern forms of energy so that they can shake off the yoke of energy poverty. To attain these two goals, energy systems need to be turned towards sustainability. To that end, efficiency must be improved at all levels of the energy system, and fossil energy sources must be substituted by renewable ones. The potential of renewable energies, above all solar energy, is almost unlimited and can be harnessed sustainably. Energy system transformation towards sustainability is thus the first step into the solar age. However, without rapid and resolute international policy support, the expansion of renewable energy sources will not be able to develop the necessary dynamics in time. The International Conference for Renewable Energies (renewables 2004) held in Bonn 2004 is a milestone for this process.\n\n====Charging the Use of Global Commons (2002)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2002\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-2/ Policy Paper 2002], \u201eCharging the Use of Global Commons.\u201c</ref>====\nIn this policy paper, the WBGU summarizes the key findings of its special report on user charges within the framework of global sustainability policy, and makes recommendations for a politically viable implementation of the concept of global user charges for three specific areas of application:\n*  Charges on the use of airspace by aviation,\n*  Charges on the use of the oceans by shipping,\n*  Payments for non utilization obligations.\n\n====The Johannesburg Opportunity: Key Elements of a Negotiation Strategy (2001)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2001\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-1/ Policy Paper 2001], \u201eThe Johannesburg Opportunity: Key Elements of a Negotiation Strategy.\u201c</ref>====\nJohannesburg in South Africa is a symbolically important venue for the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD). No other continent has been affected worse by the impacts of global change and exhibits in such representative form the critical environmental and socioeconomic situation facing many developing countries. At the same time, the host nation epitomizes new hopes and beginnings following the radical changes it has undergone in recent years. A new beginning is necessary at the international level, too, given the further deterioration in the state of the global environment since the 1992 [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro. New problems have arisen and the most critical remain unsolved. The WSSD to be held in September 2002 in Johannesburg provides the international community with yet another opportunity to set the future direction of international environment and development policy. In the run-up to this event, the WBGU would like to focus the attention of the Federal Government of Germany on some crucial issues where decisions in Johannesburg could help to eliminate critical shortcomings in current environment and development policy. A great deal has been achieved in the field of global environmental policymaking since 1992, in particular the international conventions and treaties dealing with a range of global environmental problems such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, desertification, or the impacts of persistent organic pollutants. In the view of the WBGU, the Johannesburg summit should therefore refrain from detailed negotiations on these topics. However, it must be possible to provide new ideas and inspiration, to close gaps and loopholes, and to take the various conventions a stage further\n\n== Quotes about WBGU reports ==\n\n\"The reports of the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) are an indispensable reference and resource on global environmental change policies. Every scientist, decision-maker and institution concerned with the pressing issue of environment and development should have them.\"\n\nProf. Dr. [[Klaus T\u00f6pfer]], Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 1998-2006\n\n\"Humanity on the move: Unlocking the transformative power of cities, is a notable breath of fresh air at a time when shallow platitudes seem the order of the day. It is bold, meticulously crafted through argument (as opposed to assertion) and evidence, and rooted in a highly original conceptual framework that is both global in scope and differentiated. The report asserts the centrality of cultural and institutional change and does not shy away from being specific and programmatic at a moment when it seems that political discourses are increasingly disconnected from our highly fractious, unsustainable, violent and intolerant times. I recommend it as compulsory reading in the strongest possible terms.\"\n\nProfessor [[Edgar Pieterse]], Director \u2013 African Centre for Cities (University of Cape Town) & Chairperson of the Cities Alliance Think Tank.\n\n\u201eThe new WBGU-Study \u201eA Social Contract for Sustainability\u201d appears at a time in which people around the world are increasingly committed to creating a future that is both sustainable and climate-safe. The study shows that such a future will only be possible if governments, business and  civil society collectively set the right course, making the most of regional, national and global cooperation. An important call to cross-cutting integrated action, the book deserves wide recognition.\u201c\n\n[[Christiana Figueres]], Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (2010-2016)\n\n\"The geopolitical world is changing beyond recognition. The challenge of ensuring that in the future people can live better than today, while doing so within the Planetary Boundaries has yet to be met.  Markets and the environment are increasingly globalized.  Social protection and the search for equity are not, though there are interesting signs of change.  There are many international institutions, but few are global.  We have known for some time the necessary individual solutions required for the transition.  Now, the WBGU report `World in Transition \u2013 A Social Contract for Sustainability\u00b4 offers us extremely interesting ideas on how we can bring all this together collectively through a new social contract that is global, equitable and green, and requires a new kind of global citizenship: the first steps toward a global political project for global sustainability.\"\n\n[[Janos Pasztor]], Executive Secretary UN Secretary-General's High-level Panel on Global Sustainability 2010-12\n\n\u201cThe `World in Transition \u2013 Governing the Marine Heritage\u00b4 report presents a thought provoking look at crucial aspects of oceans governance. It resonates strongly with our thinking in the World Bank and among the partners of the Global Partnership for Oceans. Nation states, civil society and industry need to work together to support more sustainable and productive ocean use. This report makes a valuable contribution to global thinking on how best we might secure a sustainable future from healthy oceans.\u201d\n\n[[Rachel Kyte]], Vice President, Sustainable Development, The World Bank (2014-2015)\n\n\"Biofuels have been represented by some as a silver bullet to the climate change threat, and by others as a fatal mistake set to destroy forests and increase hunger; they are neither. Sane and sensibly developed they offer a chance to reduce emissions, generate employment and diversify rural livelihoods. But widespread commercialisation without proper sustainability standards could prove a disaster, causing more environmental and human harm than good. The new WBGU report shows that a sustainable use of bioenergy is possible and outlines how opportunities can be exploited while at the same time minimizing risks. The report thus offers policy-makers valuable guidance for a sustainable bioenergy policy.\"\n\n[[Achim Steiner]], Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (2006-2016)\n\n\"With Climate Change as a Security Risk, WBGU has compiled a flagship report on an issue that quite rightly is rising rapidly up the international political agenda. The authors pull no punches on the likelihood of increasing tensions and conflicts in a climatically constrained world and spotlight places where possible conflicts may flare up in the 21st century unless climate change is checked. The report makes it clear that climate policy is preventative security policy.\"\n\n[[Achim Steiner]], Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (2006-2016)\n\n\u201eWith its interdisciplinary approach, providing a complex and systematic analysis of the poverty-environment nexus, WBGU's latest report breaks new ground. Indira Gandhi's old, convenient maxim was 'Poverty is the biggest polluter'. Put forward at the 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm, it has been sorely misused ever since to override environmental precaution and prioritize economic development strategies instead. The new WBGU report maps out a way to shape a coherent environment and development policy. This report revitalizes the Rio spirit and gives it a robust scientific base\u201c\n\n[[Ernst Ulrich von Weizs\u00e4cker]], Member of the German Bundestag 1998-2005.\n\n\"The publication of 'World in Transition: Towards Sustainable Energy Systems' is timely indeed. The World Summit on Sustainable Development gave great attention to this challenge, but failed to agree on a quantitative, time-bound target for the introduction of renewable energy sources. The German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) has now produced a report with a global focus; this is essential in view of the global impacts of climatic changes. The report provides a convincing long-term analysis; this, too, is essential, for global energy policies must take a long-term perspective, over a time frame of 50 to 100 years, while providing concrete guidance for decision makers to be implemented now. There is an urgent need to identify paths by which to secure energy supply for the 2.4 billion people who still depend upon traditional biomass, while keeping clearly in view the need to combine this challenge with the prevention of perilous climatic changes. Our one world must close the gap between industrialized countries\u2019 surfeit and developing countries\u2019 poverty. Policies will need to consider both the broader environmental and specific climate exigencies. I recommend this book very warmly to everyone concerned with global energy issues.\"\n\n[[Klaus T\u00f6pfer]], Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) from 1998-2006.\n\n==Public Relations and Events (Selection)==\nIn May 2012, WBGU hosted  a high-level international Symposium \u201eTowards Low-Carbon Prosperity: National Strategies and International Partnerships\u201c in Berlin.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized Sept. 15, 1915, as an exclusively CGG formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The GG, HRH, Duke of Connaught (& also Col. of the Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for men began Oct. 23, 1915.       \n\n=== Mobilization & England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|Empress of Britain]] on April 23rd, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5th, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27th at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 16') and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year.  During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and 4 drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13th, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.   \n\n=== First Actions & Casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel|Battle of Mount Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF|1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment) CEF]]. Of these members, 177281 Private John Leitch, (Later KIA 9 April, 1917), would distinguish himself with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win a Military Medal for bravery in the field on 21st of December, 1916.  The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced & indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning Aug. 18, 1916 in the Ypres area.\u00a0 Their first casualties, 2 wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26th, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA.  On September 16th, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 35 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.<br />\n\n==Unit distinctions==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:    \n\n*'''CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit\u00a0within the Canadian Corps.'''\n\n*'''The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada.''' (The other 2 were R.C.R., and P.P.C.L.I.)\n\n*'''The 87th Battalion was the only active Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War.''' ''The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77<sup>th</sup> Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF.\u00a0 The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4<sup>th</sup> & 7<sup>th</sup> \u2019Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF.\u00a0 But these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.''\n\n*'''Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by HM King George V in 1919 as a permanent distinction''' in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.<br />\n\n==Officers Commanding==\n\n*Lieut.-Col.

King Edward VIII unveiled it on 26 July 1936 in the presence of French President Albert Lebrun and a crowd of over 50,000 people, including 6,200 attendees from Canada. Following an extensive multi-year restoration, Queen Elizabeth II re-dedicated the monument on 9 April 2007 at a ceremony commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle. 18 original 87th Battalion (CGG) members participated in the 1936 Vimy Ridge pilgrimage.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized Sept. 15, 1915, as an exclusively CGG formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The GG, HRH, Duke of Connaught (& also Col. of the Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for men began Oct. 23, 1915.       \n\n=== Mobilization & England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|Empress of Britain]] on April 23rd, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5th, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27th at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 16') and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year.  During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and 4 drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13th, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.   \n\n=== First Actions & Casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel|Battle of Mount Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF|1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment) CEF]]. Of these members, Private John Leitch (177281) would distinguish himself with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win a Military Medal for bravery in the field on 21st of December, 1916.  The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced & indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning Aug. 18, 1916 in the Ypres area.\u00a0 Their first casualties, 2 wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26th, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA.  On September 16th, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 35 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.<br />\n\n==Unit distinctions==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:    \n\n*'''CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit\u00a0within the Canadian Corps.'''\n\n*'''The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada.''' (The other 2 were R.C.R., and P.P.C.L.I.)\n\n*'''The 87th Battalion was the only active Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War.''' ''The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77<sup>th</sup> Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF.\u00a0 The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4<sup>th</sup> & 7<sup>th</sup> \u2019Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF.\u00a0 But these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.''\n\n*'''Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by HM King George V in 1919 as a permanent distinction''' in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.<br />\n\n==Officers Commanding==\n\n*Lieut.-Col.

Keys would not allow it; \"they already had set the monster loose\", she recalled. \"Once I started producing my own stuff there wasn't any going back.\"<ref name=\"Pareles\"/> Keys stated that Columbia had the \"wrong vision\" for her. \"They didn't want me to be an individual, didn't really care\", Keys concluded. \"They just wanted to put me in a box.\"<ref name=\"Guardian 01\"/> Control over her creative process was \"everything\" to Keys.<ref name=\"NPR\"/>\n\nKeys had wanted to leave Columbia since they began \"completely disrespecting [her] musical creativity\".<ref name=\"Oprah\"/> Leaving Columbia was \"a hell of a fight\", she recalled. \"Out of spite, they were threatening to keep everything I'd created even though they hated it.
