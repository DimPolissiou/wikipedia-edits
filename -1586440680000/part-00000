In addition, many otherwise mundane organic materials can also be dispersed into a dangerous dust cloud, such as [[grain]], [[flour]], [[starch]], [[sugar]], [[powdered milk]], [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[coffee]], and [[pollen]]. [[Powdered metal]]s (such as [[aluminum]], [[magnesium]], and [[titanium]]) can form explosive suspensions in air, if finely divided.\n\nExplosive dust can arise from activities such as transporting grain, and [[grain silo]]s have often been demolished violently. Mining of coal leads to [[coal dust]], and [[flour mill]]s likewise have large amounts of flour dust as a result of milling. A gigantic explosion of flour dust destroyed a mill in Minnesota on May 2, 1878, killing 18 workers at the [[Washburn A Mill]] and another four in adjacent buildings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mnopedia.org/event/1878-washburn-mill-explosion |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408222412/http://www.mnopedia.org/event/1878-washburn-mill-explosion |archivedate=2014-04-08 }}</ref> A similar problem occurs in [[sawmill]]s and other places dedicated to [[woodworking]].\n\nSince the advent of industrial production\u2013scale [[metal powder]]\u2013based [[3D printing|additive manufacturing]] (AM) in the 2010s, there is growing need for more information and experience with preventing dust explosions and fires from the traces of excess metal powder sometimes left over after laser [[sintering]] or other fusion methods.<ref name=\"Simpson_2017-08-17\">{{Citation |last=Simpson |first=Timothy W. |date=2017-08-17 |title=Will My AM Part Explode?

Enclosed paper mill areas subject to such dangers commonly maintain [[humidifier|very high air humidities]] to reduce the chance of airborne paper dust explosions.\n\nIn [[special effects]] [[pyrotechnics]], [[lycopodium powder]] <ref name=ONE/> and [[non-dairy creamer]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detonationfilms.com/Fireball_demo.htm|title=Detonation Films - Why Coffee Creamer?|accessdate= March 20, 2011}}</ref> are two common means of producing safe, controlled fire effects.\n\nTo support rapid combustion, the dust must consist of very small particles with a high [[Surface-area-to-volume ratio|surface area to volume ratio]], thereby making the collective or combined surface area of all the particles very large in comparison to a dust of larger particles. [[Dust]] is defined as [[Powder (substance)|powders]] with particles less than about 500 micrometres in diameter, but finer dust will present a much greater hazard than coarse particles by virtue of the larger total surface area of all the particles.\n\n=== Concentration ===\nBelow a certain value, the [[Flammability limit#Lower explosive limit|lower explosive limit]] (LEL), there is insufficient dust to support the combustion at the rate required for an explosion.<ref name=bartec/> A combustible concentration at or below 25% of the LEL is considered safe.<ref>NFPA 69 8.3.1</ref> Similarly, if the [[Air\u2013fuel ratio|fuel to air ratio]] increases above the [[Flammability limit#Upper explosive limit|upper explosive limit]] (UEL), there is insufficient oxidant to permit combustion to continue at the necessary rate.\n\nDetermining the minimum explosive concentration or maximum explosive concentration of dusts in air is difficult, and consulting different sources can lead to quite different results. Typical explosive ranges in air are from few dozens grams/m<sup>3</sup> for the minimum limit, to few kg/m<sup>3</sup> for the maximum limit.  For example, the LEL for sawdust has been determined to be between 40 and 50 grams/m<sup>3</sup>.<ref>https://powderprocess.net/Safety/Dust_Explosion_Concentration.html</ref> It depends on many factors including the type of material used.\n\n=== Oxidant ===\nTypically, normal atmospheric oxygen can be sufficient to support a dust explosion if the other necessary conditions are also present. High-oxygen or pure oxygen environments are considered to be especially hazardous, as are strong oxidizing gases such as [[chlorine]] and [[fluorine]]. Also, particulate suspensions of compounds with a high oxidative potential, such as [[peroxide]]s, [[chlorate]]s, [[nitrate]]s, [[perchlorate]]s, and [[dichromate]]s, can increase risk of an explosion if combustible materials are also present.\n\n=== Sources of ignition ===\nThere are many sources of ignition, and a naked flame need not be the only one: over one half of the dust explosions in Germany in 2005 were from non-flame sources.<ref name=bartec>[http://bartec.de/homepage/eng/downloads/produkte/staubexschutz/Dust_Ex.pdf !StaubEx_0805_e.pdf<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Common sources of ignition include:\n* [[electrostatic discharge]] (e.g. an improperly installed [[conveyor belt]], which can act like a [[Van de Graaff generator]])\n* [[friction]] \n* [[electrical arcing]] from machinery or other equipment\n* hot surfaces (e.g. overheated [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]])\n* [[fire]]\n* self-ignition\n\nHowever, it is often difficult to determine the exact source of ignition when investigating after an explosion. When a source cannot be found, ignition will often be attributed to [[static electricity]]. Static charges can be generated by external sources, or can be internally generated by friction at the surfaces of particles themselves as they collide or move past one another.\n\n== Mechanism ==\nDusts have a very large surface area compared to their mass. Since burning can only occur at the surface of a solid or liquid, where it can react with oxygen, this causes dusts to be much more flammable than bulk materials. For example, a {{convert|1|kg}} sphere of a combustible material with a density of 1 g/cm<sup>3</sup> would be about {{convert|12.4|cm|in}} in diameter, and have a surface area of {{convert|0.048|m2}}. However, if it were broken up into spherical dust particles 50 [[\u00b5m]] in diameter (about the size of [[flour]] particles) it would have a surface area of {{convert|120|m2}}. This greatly-increased surface area allows the material to burn much faster, and the extremely small mass of each particle allows them to catch on fire with much less energy than the bulk material, as there is no heat loss to conduction within the material.\n\nWhen this mixture of fuel and air is ignited, especially in a confined space such as a warehouse or silo, a significant increase in pressure is created, often more than sufficient to demolish the structure. Even materials that are traditionally thought of as nonflammable (such as aluminum), or slow burning (such as wood), can produce a powerful explosion when finely divided, and can be ignited by even a small spark.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Demonstration of an open-air dust explosion\">\nFile:Dust explosion 00.jpg|Experimental setup\nFile:Dust explosion 01.jpg|Finely-ground [[flour]] is dispersed\nFile:Dust explosion 02.jpg|Cloud of flour is ignited\nFile:Dust explosion 03.jpg|Fireball spreads rapidly\nFile:Dust explosion 04.jpg|Intense [[radiant heat]] has nothing to ignite here\nFile:Dust explosion 05.jpg|Fireball and superheated gases rise\nFile:Dust explosion 06.jpg|Aftermath of explosion, with unburned flour on the ground\n</gallery>\n\n==Effects==\nA dust explosion can cause major damage to structures, equipment, and personnel from violent overpressure or shockwave effects. Flying objects and debris can cause further damage. Intense [[radiant heat]] from a fireball can ignite the surroundings, or cause severe [[skin burn]]s in unprotected persons. In a tightly enclosed space, the sudden depletion of oxygen can cause [[asphyxiation]].  Where the dust is carbon based (such as in a coal mine), incomplete combustion may cause large amounts of [[carbon monoxide]] (the miners' [[after-damp]]) to be created.  This can cause more deaths than the original explosion as well as hindering rescue attempts.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Murray | first1=Charles Edward Robertson | last2=Wilberforce | first2=Daniel | last3=Ritchie | first3=David | date=1903 | title=Mount Kembla Colliery Disaster 31 July 1902 \u2013 Report of the Royal Commission, together with minutes of evidence and exhibits | publisher=New South Wales Legislative Assembly | url=https://ro.uow.edu.au/hcp/2/ | accessdate=19 May 2019|p=xxxvi}}</ref><ref>{{citation  | last = Roberts  | first = H C W  | title = Report on the causes of, and circumstances attending, the explosion which occurred at Easington Colliery, County Durham, on the 29th May, 1951.  | date = September 1952  | publisher = Her Majesty's Stationery Office  | location = London  | series = Cmd 8646  | hdl = 1842/5365 | pp = 9, 39\u201340}}</ref>\n\n== Protection and mitigation ==\n[[File:\"Save Lives, Save Food- Save Property. Prevent Dust Explosions...Keep your mill and elevator free from dust and dirt.... - NARA - 512690.tif|thumb|upright|This American poster during World War I warned about grain dust explosions]]\nMuch research has been carried out in Europe and elsewhere to understand how to control these dangers, but dust explosions still occur. The alternatives for making processes and plants safer depend on the industry.\n\nIn the [[coal mining]] industry, a [[methane explosion]] can initiate a [[coal dust]] explosion, which can then engulf an entire mine pit. As a precaution, incombustible stone dust may be spread along mine roadways, or stored in trays hanging from the roof, to dilute the coal dust stirred up by a [[shockwave]] to the point where it cannot burn. Mines may also be sprayed with water to inhibit ignition.\n\nSome industries exclude oxygen from dust-raising  processes, a precaution known as \"inerting\". Typically this uses [[nitrogen]], [[carbon dioxide]], or [[argon]], which are incombustible gases which can displace oxygen. The same method is also used in large storage tanks where flammable vapors can accumulate. However, use of oxygen-free gases brings a risk of [[asphyxiation]] of the workers. Workers who need illumination in enclosed spaces where a dust explosion is a high risk often use lamps designed for [[Underwater diving|underwater divers]], as they have no risk of producing an open spark due to their sealed waterproof design.\n\nGood housekeeping practices, such as eliminating build-up of combustible dust deposits that could be disturbed and lead to a secondary explosion, also help mitigate the problem.\n\nBest engineering control measures which can be found in the [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA) Combustible Dust Standards<ref>http://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards</ref> include:\n* Wetting\n* Oxidant concentration reduction \n* Deflagration venting\n* Deflagration pressure containment\n* Deflagration suppression\n* Deflagration venting through a dust retention and flame-arresting device\n\n== Notable incidents ==\n<!-- >>>> NOTE TO EDITORS <<<<\nDo NOT add an entry to the table without *either* a Wikilink to an existing article covering the incident *or* a footnote reference directly documenting the incident.

A gigantic explosion of flour dust destroyed a mill in Minnesota on May 2, 1878, killing 18 workers at the [[Washburn A Mill]] and another four in adjacent buildings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mnopedia.org/event/1878-washburn-mill-explosion |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408222412/http://www.mnopedia.org/event/1878-washburn-mill-explosion |archivedate=2014-04-08 }}</ref> A similar problem occurs in [[sawmill]]s and other places dedicated to [[woodworking]].\n\nSince the advent of industrial production\u2013scale [[metal powder]]\u2013based [[3D printing|additive manufacturing]] (AM) in the 2010s, there is growing need for more information and experience with preventing dust explosions and fires from the traces of excess metal powder sometimes left over after laser [[sintering]] or other fusion methods.<ref name=\"Simpson_2017-08-17\">{{Citation |last=Simpson |first=Timothy W. |date=2017-08-17 |title=Will My AM Part Explode? Not if you're careful. Parts built from metallic powder require extra precautions |journal=[[Modern Machine Shop]] |url=https://www.mmsonline.com/columns/will-my-am-part-explode |postscript=.}}</ref> For example, in [[machining]] operations downstream of the AM build, excess powder liberated from porosities in the support structures can be exposed to sparks from the cutting interface.<ref name=\"Simpson_2017-08-17\"/> Efforts are underway not only to build this knowledgebase within the industry but also to share it with local fire departments, who do periodic fire-safety inspections of businesses in their districts and who can expect to answer alarms at shops or plants where AM is now part of the production mix.<ref name=\"Simpson_2017-08-17\"/> \n\nAlthough not strictly a dust, paper particles emitted during processing - especially rolling, unrolling, calendaring/slitting, and sheet-cutting - are also known to pose an explosion hazard. Enclosed paper mill areas subject to such dangers commonly maintain [[humidifier|very high air humidities]] to reduce the chance of airborne paper dust explosions.\n\nIn [[special effects]] [[pyrotechnics]], [[lycopodium powder]] <ref name=ONE/> and [[non-dairy creamer]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detonationfilms.com/Fireball_demo.htm|title=Detonation Films - Why Coffee Creamer?|accessdate= March 20, 2011}}</ref> are two common means of producing safe, controlled fire effects.\n\nTo support rapid combustion, the dust must consist of very small particles with a high [[Surface-area-to-volume ratio|surface area to volume ratio]], thereby making the collective or combined surface area of all the particles very large in comparison to a dust of larger particles. [[Dust]] is defined as [[Powder (substance)|powders]] with particles less than about 500 micrometres in diameter, but finer dust will present a much greater hazard than coarse particles by virtue of the larger total surface area of all the particles.\n\n=== Concentration ===\nBelow a certain value, the [[Flammability limit#Lower explosive limit|lower explosive limit]] (LEL), there is insufficient dust to support the combustion at the rate required for an explosion.<ref name=bartec/> A combustible concentration at or below 25% of the LEL is considered safe.<ref>NFPA 69 8.3.1</ref> Similarly, if the [[Air\u2013fuel ratio|fuel to air ratio]] increases above the [[Flammability limit#Upper explosive limit|upper explosive limit]] (UEL), there is insufficient oxidant to permit combustion to continue at the necessary rate.\n\nDetermining the minimum explosive concentration or maximum explosive concentration of dusts in air is difficult, and consulting different sources can lead to quite different results. Typical explosive ranges in air are from few dozens grams/m<sup>3</sup> for the minimum limit, to few kg/m<sup>3</sup> for the maximum limit.  For example, the LEL for sawdust has been determined to be between 40 and 50 grams/m<sup>3</sup>.<ref>https://powderprocess.net/Safety/Dust_Explosion_Concentration.html</ref> It depends on many factors including the type of material used.\n\n=== Oxidant ===\nTypically, normal atmospheric oxygen can be sufficient to support a dust explosion if the other necessary conditions are also present. High-oxygen or pure oxygen environments are considered to be especially hazardous, as are strong oxidizing gases such as [[chlorine]] and [[fluorine]]. Also, particulate suspensions of compounds with a high oxidative potential, such as [[peroxide]]s, [[chlorate]]s, [[nitrate]]s, [[perchlorate]]s, and [[dichromate]]s, can increase risk of an explosion if combustible materials are also present.\n\n=== Sources of ignition ===\nThere are many sources of ignition, and a naked flame need not be the only one: over one half of the dust explosions in Germany in 2005 were from non-flame sources.<ref name=bartec>[http://bartec.de/homepage/eng/downloads/produkte/staubexschutz/Dust_Ex.pdf !StaubEx_0805_e.pdf<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Common sources of ignition include:\n* [[electrostatic discharge]] (e.g. an improperly installed [[conveyor belt]], which can act like a [[Van de Graaff generator]])\n* [[friction]] \n* [[electrical arcing]] from machinery or other equipment\n* hot surfaces (e.g. overheated [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]])\n* [[fire]]\n* self-ignition\n\nHowever, it is often difficult to determine the exact source of ignition when investigating after an explosion. When a source cannot be found, ignition will often be attributed to [[static electricity]]. Static charges can be generated by external sources, or can be internally generated by friction at the surfaces of particles themselves as they collide or move past one another.\n\n== Mechanism ==\nDusts have a very large surface area compared to their mass. Since burning can only occur at the surface of a solid or liquid, where it can react with oxygen, this causes dusts to be much more flammable than bulk materials. For example, a {{convert|1|kg}} sphere of a combustible material with a density of 1 g/cm<sup>3</sup> would be about {{convert|12.4|cm|in}} in diameter, and have a surface area of {{convert|0.048|m2}}. However, if it were broken up into spherical dust particles 50 [[\u00b5m]] in diameter (about the size of [[flour]] particles) it would have a surface area of {{convert|120|m2}}. This greatly-increased surface area allows the material to burn much faster, and the extremely small mass of each particle allows them to catch on fire with much less energy than the bulk material, as there is no heat loss to conduction within the material.\n\nWhen this mixture of fuel and air is ignited, especially in a confined space such as a warehouse or silo, a significant increase in pressure is created, often more than sufficient to demolish the structure. Even materials that are traditionally thought of as nonflammable (such as aluminum), or slow burning (such as wood), can produce a powerful explosion when finely divided, and can be ignited by even a small spark.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Demonstration of an open-air dust explosion\">\nFile:Dust explosion 00.jpg|Experimental setup\nFile:Dust explosion 01.jpg|Finely-ground [[flour]] is dispersed\nFile:Dust explosion 02.jpg|Cloud of flour is ignited\nFile:Dust explosion 03.jpg|Fireball spreads rapidly\nFile:Dust explosion 04.jpg|Intense [[radiant heat]] has nothing to ignite here\nFile:Dust explosion 05.jpg|Fireball and superheated gases rise\nFile:Dust explosion 06.jpg|Aftermath of explosion, with unburned flour on the ground\n</gallery>\n\n==Effects==\nA dust explosion can cause major damage to structures, equipment, and personnel from violent overpressure or shockwave effects. Flying objects and debris can cause further damage. Intense [[radiant heat]] from a fireball can ignite the surroundings, or cause severe [[skin burn]]s in unprotected persons. In a tightly enclosed space, the sudden depletion of oxygen can cause [[asphyxiation]].  Where the dust is carbon based (such as in a coal mine), incomplete combustion may cause large amounts of [[carbon monoxide]] (the miners' [[after-damp]]) to be created.  This can cause more deaths than the original explosion as well as hindering rescue attempts.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Murray | first1=Charles Edward Robertson | last2=Wilberforce | first2=Daniel | last3=Ritchie | first3=David | date=1903 | title=Mount Kembla Colliery Disaster 31 July 1902 \u2013 Report of the Royal Commission, together with minutes of evidence and exhibits | publisher=New South Wales Legislative Assembly | url=https://ro.uow.edu.au/hcp/2/ | accessdate=19 May 2019|p=xxxvi}}</ref><ref>{{citation  | last = Roberts  | first = H C W  | title = Report on the causes of, and circumstances attending, the explosion which occurred at Easington Colliery, County Durham, on the 29th May, 1951.  | date = September 1952  | publisher = Her Majesty's Stationery Office  | location = London  | series = Cmd 8646  | hdl = 1842/5365 | pp = 9, 39\u201340}}</ref>\n\n== Protection and mitigation ==\n[[File:\"Save Lives, Save Food- Save Property. Prevent Dust Explosions...Keep your mill and elevator free from dust and dirt.... - NARA - 512690.tif|thumb|upright|This American poster during World War I warned about grain dust explosions]]\nMuch research has been carried out in Europe and elsewhere to understand how to control these dangers, but dust explosions still occur. The alternatives for making processes and plants safer depend on the industry.\n\nIn the [[coal mining]] industry, a [[methane explosion]] can initiate a [[coal dust]] explosion, which can then engulf an entire mine pit. As a precaution, incombustible stone dust may be spread along mine roadways, or stored in trays hanging from the roof, to dilute the coal dust stirred up by a [[shockwave]] to the point where it cannot burn. Mines may also be sprayed with water to inhibit ignition.\n\nSome industries exclude oxygen from dust-raising  processes, a precaution known as \"inerting\". Typically this uses [[nitrogen]], [[carbon dioxide]], or [[argon]], which are incombustible gases which can displace oxygen. The same method is also used in large storage tanks where flammable vapors can accumulate. However, use of oxygen-free gases brings a risk of [[asphyxiation]] of the workers. Workers who need illumination in enclosed spaces where a dust explosion is a high risk often use lamps designed for [[Underwater diving|underwater divers]], as they have no risk of producing an open spark due to their sealed waterproof design.\n\nGood housekeeping practices, such as eliminating build-up of combustible dust deposits that could be disturbed and lead to a secondary explosion, also help mitigate the problem.\n\nBest engineering control measures which can be found in the [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA) Combustible Dust Standards<ref>http://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards</ref> include:\n* Wetting\n* Oxidant concentration reduction \n* Deflagration venting\n* Deflagration pressure containment\n* Deflagration suppression\n* Deflagration venting through a dust retention and flame-arresting device\n\n== Notable incidents ==\n<!-- >>>> NOTE TO EDITORS <<<<\nDo NOT add an entry to the table without *either* a Wikilink to an existing article covering the incident *or* a footnote reference directly documenting the incident.

Built in the early 19th century, it still functions as a lighthouse and is managed by [[Trinity House]] (England's [[General Lighthouse Authority]]). In 1910 it was one of the first Trinity House lighthouses to be [[automated]].<ref name=\"Jones2014\">{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Robin |title=Lighthouses of the North East Coast |date=2014 |publisher=Halsgrove |location=Wellington, Somerset |page=28}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nFarne Lighthouse was one of a pair built on Inner Farne by the [[Corporation of Trinity House]] in 1811, both of which were designed by [[Daniel Asher Alexander|Daniel Alexander]] to replace an earlier coal-burning light which had been established on the island by Captain John Blackett in 1778.\n\nFarne Lighthouse (originally named '''Farne High Lighthouse''') is a cylindrical white tower, {{convert|13|m|abbr=on}} tall with a [[lighthouse keeper]]'s cottage attached to its base. It was initially provided with a revolving array of seven [[Argand lamp]]s and reflectors, which displayed a single white flash every 30 seconds. In 1910 it was converted to run automatically on [[acetylene]] (manufactured in an adjacent producer plant and controlled by a [[sun valve]]);<ref name=\"trinityhouse\" /> a new fixed [[Fresnel lens|optic]] was installed in the lantern and a red [[Sector light|sector]] was added to the main light to indicate lines of approach that were hazardous for shipping.<ref name=\"WWL\">{{cite web |title=Farne Lighthouse |url=http://www.worldwidelighthouses.com/Lighthouses/English-Lighthouses/Trinity-House-Owned/Farne |website=Worldwide Lighthouses |accessdate=26 February 2019}}</ref> (That same year saw the nearby [[Bamburgh Lighthouse]] established, with a [[sector light]] that worked in conjunction with the Inner Farne light.<ref name=\"WWL\" />) This arrangement largely remains in place, except that in 1996 the light was converted from acetylene to solar powered operation.<ref name=\"trinityhouse\">{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |year= |url=http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses/lighthouse_list/farne.html |title=Farne Lighthouse |publisher=Trinity House |access-date= |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310222521/http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses/lighthouse_list/farne.html |archive-date=10 March 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe other lighthouse on the island ('''Farne Low Lighthouse''') was an octagonal tower, {{convert|8|m|abbr=on}} tall, placed {{convert|150|m|abbr=on}} away from the first, close to the north-west tip of the island.

It was initially provided with a revolving array of seven [[Argand lamp]]s and reflectors, which displayed a single white flash every 30 seconds.

By that time the project had attracted several other contributors on [[GitHub]], and was receiving over 300 page hits per day.\n\nOn December 24, 2010, Ashkenas announced the release of stable 1.0.0 to [[Hacker News]], the site where the project was announced for the first time.<ref>Hacker News. [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2037801 CoffeeScript 1.0.0 announcement] posted by Jeremy Ashkenas on Dec 24, 2010</ref><ref>Hacker News. [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1014080 Original CoffeeScript announcement] posted by Jeremy Ashkenas on Dec 24, 2009</ref>\n\nOn September 18, 2017, version 2.0.0 was introduced,<ref>coffeescript.org [http://coffeescript.org/announcing-coffeescript-2/ Announcing CoffeeScript 2]</ref> which \"aims to bring CoffeeScript into the modern JavaScript era, closing gaps in compatibility with JavaScript while preserving the clean syntax that is CoffeeScript\u2019s hallmark.\"\n\n== Syntax ==\nAlmost everything is an expression in CoffeeScript, for example <code>if</code>, <code>switch</code> and <code>for</code> expressions (which have no return value in JavaScript) return a value. As in [[Perl]], these control statements also have postfix versions; for example, <code>if</code> can also be written in <code> consequent if condition</code> form.\n\nMany unnecessary parentheses and braces can be omitted; for example, blocks of code can be denoted by indentation instead of braces, function calls are implicit, and object literals are often detected automatically.\n\nTo compute the [[body mass index]], one may do (here in [[JavaScript]]):\n\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\nconst mass = 72\nconst height = 1.78\nconst BMI = mass / height ** 2\nif (18.5 < BMI && BMI < 25) { alert('You are healthy!') }\n</source>\n\nWith CoffeeScript the interval is directly described:\n\n<source lang=\"coffeescript\">\nmass = 72\nheight = 1.78\nBMI = mass / height**2\nalert 'You are healthy!' if 18.5 < BMI < 25\n</source>\n\nTo compute the [[greatest common divisor]] of two integers with the [[euclidean algorithm]], in JavaScript one usually needs a ''while'' loop:\n\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\ngcd = (x, y) => {\n  do {\n    z = x % y\n    x = y\n    y = z\n  } while (y !== 0)\n  return x\n}\n</source>\n\nWhereas in CoffeeScript one can use <code>until</code> and destructuring assignment<ref>CoffeeScript calls this \"[[pattern matching]]\", which is a non-standard use of that term.</ref> instead:\n<source lang=\"coffeescript\">\ngcd = (x, y) ->\n  [x, y] = [y, x%y] until y is 0\n  x\n</source>\n\nAny ''for'' loop can be replaced by a [[list comprehension]]; so that to compute the squares of the positive odd numbers smaller than ten (i.e. numbers whose remainder modulo 2 is 1), one can do:\n\n<source lang=\"coffeescript\">\nalert n*n for n in [1..10] when n%2 is 1\n</source>\n\nAlternatively, there is:\n\n<source lang=\"coffeescript\">\nalert n*n for n in [1..10] by 2\n</source>\n\nA [[linear search]] can be implemented with a one-liner using the when keyword:\n\n<source lang=\"coffeescript\">\nnames = [\"Ivan\", \"Joanna\", \"Nikolay\", \"Mihaela\"]\nlinearSearch = (searchName) -> alert(name) for name in names when name is searchName\n</source>\n\nThe <code>for ... in</code> syntax allows looping over arrays while the <code>for ... of</code> syntax allows looping over objects.\n\nThe <code>?</code> keyword quickly checks if a variable is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code> :\n<source lang=\"coffeescript\">\npersonCheck = ->\n  if not person? then alert(\"No person\") else alert(\"Have person\")\nperson = null\npersonCheck()\nperson = \"Ivan\"\npersonCheck()\n</source>\n\nThis would alert \"No person\" if the variable is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code> and \"Have person\" if there is something there.\n\nA common JavaScript snippet using the [[jQuery]] library is:\n\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\n$(document).ready(function() {\n  // Initialization code goes here\n})\n</source>\n\nOr even just:\n\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\n$(function() {\n  // Initialization code goes here\n})\n</source>\n\nIn CoffeeScript, the <code>function</code> keyword is replaced by the <code>-></code> symbol, and indentation is used instead of curly braces, as in other [[off-side rule]] languages such as Python and Haskell.  Also, parentheses can usually be omitted, using indentation level instead to denote a function or block. Thus, the CoffeeScript equivalent of the snippet above is:\n\n<!-- Ruby is probably the most similar language that GeSHi supports -->\n<source lang=\"coffeescript\">\n$(document).ready ->\n  # Initialization code goes here\n</source>\n\nOr just:\n\n<source lang=\"coffeescript\">\n$ ->\n  # Initialization code goes here\n</source>\n\nRuby-style string interpolation is included in CoffeeScript. Double-quoted strings allow for interpolated values, using #{ ... }, and single-quoted strings are literal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official CoffeeScript Page|url=http://coffeescript.org|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n<source lang=\"coffeescript\">\nauthor = \"Wittgenstein\"\nquote  = \"A picture is a fact. -- #{ author }\"\n\nsentence = \"#{ 22 / 7 } is a decent approximation of \u03c0\"\n</source>\n\nCoffeeScript has been criticized for its unusual scoping\nrules.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2011/12/22/implicit-scoping-in-coffeescript/\n|title=The Problem with Implicit Scoping in CoffeeScript\n|accessdate=2018-10-13\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://donatstudios.com/CoffeeScript-Madness\n|title=CoffeeScript's Scoping is Madness\n|accessdate=2018-10-13\n}}</ref> In particular, it completely disallows [[variable shadowing]] which makes reasoning about code more difficult and\nerror-prone in some basic programming patterns established\nby and taken for granted since [[procedural programming]]\nprinciples were defined.\n\nFor example, with the following code snippet in JavaScript\none does not have to look outside the <code>{}</code>-block to know for\nsure that no possible <code>foo</code> variable in the outer scope can be\nincidentally overridden:\n\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\n  // ...\n  function baz() {\n    var foo = \"bar\"\n    console.log(`foo = ${foo}`)\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n</source>\n\nIn CoffeeScript there is no way to tell if the scope of a variable\nis limited to a block or not without looking outside the block.\n\n== Development and distribution ==\n\nThe CoffeeScript compiler has been [[self-hosting (compilers)|self-hosting]] since version 0.5 and is available as a [[Node.js]] utility; however, the core compiler does not rely on Node.js and can be run in any [[JavaScript]] environment.<ref>[https://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/#installation CoffeeScript] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427060308/http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/ |date=2012-04-27 }}.

The js2coffee<ref>{{cite web |url=http://js2.coffee |title=js2coffee|last=Sta Cruz|first= Rico|accessdate=11 May 2014}}</ref> site provides bi-directional translation.\n\n== Latest additions ==\n* Source maps allow users to de-bug their CoffeeScript code directly, supporting CoffeeScript tracebacks on run time errors.\n* CoffeeScript supports a form of [[Literate Programming]], using the <code>.coffee.md</code> or <code>.litcoffee</code> file extension. This allows CoffeeScript source code to be written in [[Markdown]].  The compiler will treat any indented blocks (Markdown's way of indicating source code) as code, and ignore the rest as comments.\n\n== Extensions ==\nIced CoffeeScript is a superset of CoffeeScript which adds two new keywords: <code>await</code> and <code>defer</code>.

By that time the project had attracted several other contributors on [[GitHub]], and was receiving over 300 page hits per day.\n\nOn December 24, 2010, Ashkenas announced the release of stable 1.0.0 to [[Hacker News]], the site where the project was announced for the first time.<ref>Hacker News. [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2037801 CoffeeScript 1.0.0 announcement] posted by Jeremy Ashkenas on Dec 24, 2010</ref><ref>Hacker News. [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1014080 Original CoffeeScript announcement] posted by Jeremy Ashkenas on Dec 24, 2009</ref>\n\nOn September 18, 2017, version 2.0.0 was introduced,<ref>coffeescript.org [http://coffeescript.org/announcing-coffeescript-2/ Announcing CoffeeScript 2]</ref> which \"aims to bring CoffeeScript into the modern JavaScript era, closing gaps in compatibility with JavaScript while preserving the clean syntax that is CoffeeScript\u2019s hallmark.\"\n\n== Syntax ==\nAlmost everything is an expression in CoffeeScript, for example <code>if</code>, <code>switch</code> and <code>for</code> expressions (which have no return value in JavaScript) return a value. As in [[Perl]], these control statements also have postfix versions; for example, <code>if</code> can also be written in <code> consequent if condition</code> form.\n\nMany unnecessary parentheses and braces can be omitted; for example, blocks of code can be denoted by indentation instead of braces, function calls are implicit, and object literals are often detected automatically.\n\nTo compute the [[body mass index]], one may do (here in [[JavaScript]]):\n\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\nconst mass = 72\nconst height = 1.78\nconst BMI = mass / height ** 2\nif (18.5 < BMI && BMI < 25) { alert('You are healthy!') }\n</source>\n\nWith CoffeeScript the interval is directly described:\n\n<source lang=\"coffeescript\">\nmass = 72\nheight = 1.78\nBMI = mass / height**2\nalert 'You are healthy!' if 18.5 < BMI < 25\n</source>\n\nTo compute the [[greatest common divisor]] of two integers with the [[euclidean algorithm]], in JavaScript one usually needs a ''while'' loop:\n\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\ngcd = (x, y) => {\n  do {\n    z = x % y\n    x = y\n    y = z\n  } while (y !== 0)\n  return x\n}\n</source>\n\nWhereas in CoffeeScript one can use <code>until</code> and destructuring assignment<ref>CoffeeScript calls this \"[[pattern matching]]\", which is a non-standard use of that term.</ref> instead:\n<source lang=\"coffeescript\">\ngcd = (x, y) ->\n  [x, y] = [y, x%y] until y is 0\n  x\n</source>\n\nAny ''for'' loop can be replaced by a [[list comprehension]]; so that to compute the squares of the positive odd numbers smaller than ten (i.e. numbers whose remainder modulo 2 is 1), one can do:\n\n<source lang=\"coffeescript\">\nalert n*n for n in [1..10] when n%2 is 1\n</source>\n\nAlternatively, there is:\n\n<source lang=\"coffeescript\">\nalert n*n for n in [1..10] by 2\n</source>\n\nA [[linear search]] can be implemented with a one-liner using the when keyword:\n\n<source lang=\"coffeescript\">\nnames = [\"Ivan\", \"Joanna\", \"Nikolay\", \"Mihaela\"]\nlinearSearch = (searchName) -> alert(name) for name in names when name is searchName\n</source>\n\nThe <code>for ... in</code> syntax allows looping over arrays while the <code>for ... of</code> syntax allows looping over objects.\n\nThe <code>?</code> keyword quickly checks if a variable is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code> :\n<source lang=\"coffeescript\">\npersonCheck = ->\n  if not person? then alert(\"No person\") else alert(\"Have person\")\nperson = null\npersonCheck()\nperson = \"Ivan\"\npersonCheck()\n</source>\n\nThis would alert \"No person\" if the variable is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code> and \"Have person\" if there is something there.\n\nA common JavaScript snippet using the [[jQuery]] library is:\n\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\n$(document).ready(function() {\n  // Initialization code goes here\n})\n</source>\n\nOr even just:\n\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\n$(function() {\n  // Initialization code goes here\n})\n</source>\n\nIn CoffeeScript, the <code>function</code> keyword is replaced by the <code>-></code> symbol, and indentation is used instead of curly braces, as in other [[off-side rule]] languages such as Python and Haskell.  Also, parentheses can usually be omitted, using indentation level instead to denote a function or block. Thus, the CoffeeScript equivalent of the snippet above is:\n\n<!-- Ruby is probably the most similar language that GeSHi supports -->\n<source lang=\"coffeescript\">\n$(document).ready ->\n  # Initialization code goes here\n</source>\n\nOr just:\n\n<source lang=\"coffeescript\">\n$ ->\n  # Initialization code goes here\n</source>\n\nRuby-style string interpolation is included in CoffeeScript. Double-quoted strings allow for interpolated values, using #{ ... }, and single-quoted strings are literal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official CoffeeScript Page|url=http://coffeescript.org|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n<source lang=\"coffeescript\">\nauthor = \"Wittgenstein\"\nquote  = \"A picture is a fact. -- #{ author }\"\n\nsentence = \"#{ 22 / 7 } is a decent approximation of \u03c0\"\n</source>\n\nCoffeeScript has been criticized for its unusual scoping\nrules.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2011/12/22/implicit-scoping-in-coffeescript/\n|title=The Problem with Implicit Scoping in CoffeeScript\n|accessdate=2018-10-13\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://donatstudios.com/CoffeeScript-Madness\n|title=CoffeeScript's Scoping is Madness\n|accessdate=2018-10-13\n}}</ref> In particular, it completely disallows [[variable shadowing]] which makes reasoning about code more difficult and\nerror-prone in some basic programming patterns established\nby and taken for granted since [[procedural programming]]\nprinciples were defined.\n\nFor example, with the following code snippet in JavaScript\none does not have to look outside the <code>{}</code>-block to know for\nsure that no possible <code>foo</code> variable in the outer scope can be\nincidentally overridden:\n\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\n  // ...\n  function baz() {\n    var foo = \"bar\"\n    console.log(`foo = ${foo}`)\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n</source>\n\nIn CoffeeScript there is no way to tell if the scope of a variable\nis limited to a block or not without looking outside the block.\n\n== Development and distribution ==\n\nThe CoffeeScript compiler has been [[self-hosting (compilers)|self-hosting]] since version 0.5 and is available as a [[Node.js]] utility; however, the core compiler does not rely on Node.js and can be run in any [[JavaScript]] environment.<ref>[https://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/#installation CoffeeScript] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427060308/http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/ |date=2012-04-27 }}.

The plugin uses the [[Rhino (JavaScript engine)|Rhino]] JavaScript engine written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe official site at CoffeeScript.org has a \"Try CoffeeScript\" button in the menu bar; clicking it opens a modal window in which users can enter CoffeeScript, see the JavaScript output, and run it directly in the browser. The js2coffee<ref>{{cite web |url=http://js2.coffee |title=js2coffee|last=Sta Cruz|first= Rico|accessdate=11 May 2014}}</ref> site provides bi-directional translation.\n\n== Latest additions ==\n* Source maps allow users to de-bug their CoffeeScript code directly, supporting CoffeeScript tracebacks on run time errors.\n* CoffeeScript supports a form of [[Literate Programming]], using the <code>.coffee.md</code> or <code>.litcoffee</code> file extension. This allows CoffeeScript source code to be written in [[Markdown]].  The compiler will treat any indented blocks (Markdown's way of indicating source code) as code, and ignore the rest as comments.\n\n== Extensions ==\n[[Iced CoffeeScript]] is a superset of CoffeeScript which adds two new keywords: <code>await</code> and <code>defer</code>. These additions simplify asynchronous control flow, making the code to look more like a [[procedural programming]] language, eliminating the call-back chain.
