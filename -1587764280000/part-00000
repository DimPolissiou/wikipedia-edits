Rasik [[Sant (religion)|sants]] have mentioned her as a descension of the Supreme Goddess, source of the Infinite [[Lakshmi]], the original form of Yogamaya and Hladini [[Shakti]] (Power of Divine Love) which is the main power of the Godhead Shri Krishna.\n\nRadha is worshipped in India, particularly by [[Gaudiya Vaishnavas]], Vaishnavas in West Bengal, [[Bangladesh]] Manipur, and Odisha. Elsewhere, she is revered in the [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]] and movements linked to [[Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]].<ref name=hawleyxiii/><ref name=dalal321/>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Sanskrit term R\u0101dh\u0101 ([[Sanskrit]]: \u0930\u093e\u0927\u093e) means \"prosperity, success\".<ref name=mmwradha>Monier Monier-Williams, [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0900/mw__0909.html R\u0101dh\u0101], Sanskrit-English Dictionary with Etymology, Oxford University Press, page 876</ref><ref name=sen434>Sukumar Sen (1943), \"Etymology of the name Radha-Krishana,\" Indian Linguistics, Vol. 8, pp. 434\u2013435</ref> It is a common word and name found in various contexts in the ancient and medieval texts of India.\n\nRadha is the name of the ''gopi'' who is the beloved of [[Krishna]]. Both Radha and Krishna are the main characters of the ''[[Gita Govinda]]'' by Jayadeva Gosvami.<ref name=mmwradha/>\n\nHit Harivansh's and Swami Haridas' books consider Radha the main deity. Here, Radha is not an avatar of Laxmi but a form of Bhagavan Shri Krishna Himself. In the ''Devi Bhagavat'' and ''Brahma Vaivarta Purana,'' Radha is given as the source of infinite Laxmis, Gopis, and the mother of infinite souls.\n\nThe ''Narada-pancaratra'' states, \"Radha is Gokulesvari, the full embodiment of spontaneous love and the personification of mahabhava [the highest spiritual state]. Bhagavan Sri Krishna, who is the supreme Isvara of all existence and the God among gods, is attained by Her mercy. Sri Radha is Krsna\u2019s internal potency, and She performs worship of Her most beloved Sri Krsna with the entire wealth of Her devotion and service.\"\n\nIn ''Sammohana-tantra,'' Durga Devi says, \"The name Durga, by which I am known, is Her name. The qualities for which I am famous are Her qualities. The majesty with which I am resplendent is Her majesty. That Maha-Laksmi, Sri Radha, is nondifferent from Sri Krsna. She is His dearmost sweetheart and the crest-jewel of His beloveds.\"\n\nIn Caitanya Charitamrta (Adi-Lila 4.56), Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami says, \"''Radha Krishna Ek Atma, Dui Dui Dehadari, Anyaoone Vilase Rasasvadana Kori\".'' This means that both Radha and Krishna are one soul who take the form of two individual bodies so that they can cherish different mood of love (rasa).<ref>Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami, [https://vrajvrindavan.com/radha/ R\u0101dh\u0101], ''[[Chaitanya Charitamrita|Caitanya Caritamrta]]'' Adi-Lila 4.56</ref>\n\nJagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj elaborately described the virtue of Radha and has given a brief description of Shri Radha in his lectures and ''Kirtans''. He has said, \"She is the Supreme Goddess and is worshipped by everyone including Godhead Shri Krishna himself and that's why she is called '''Radha,''' which means \"one who is the form of worship.\"\n\nThe term is related to R\u0101dha ([[Sanskrit]]: \u0930\u093e\u0927), which means \"kindness, any gift but particularly the gift of affection, success, wealth\".<ref name=mmwradha/> The word appears in the [[Veda|Vedic]] literature as well as the [[Itihasa|Epics]], but is elusive.<ref name=miller655>{{cite journal | last=Miller | first=Barbara Stoler | title=R\u0101dh\u0101: Consort of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's Vernal Passion | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | publisher=American Oriental Society | volume=95 | issue=4 | year=1975 | pages=655\u2013671 | doi=10.2307/601022 }}</ref>\n\nR\u0101dhik\u0101 refers to an endearing form of gopi Radha.<ref name=mmwradha/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Radha and Krishna by DHURANDHAR MV.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Radha with Krishna, a 1915 painting.]]\nRadha is an important goddess in the [[Vaishnavism]] traditions of Hinduism.

The traditions that venerate her explain this is because she is the secret treasure hidden within the Upanishads, Puranas, and Tantra.

This is found in sculpture such as those discovered in [[Maharashtra]], and in texts such as ''[[Shiva Purana]]'' and ''[[Brahmavaivarta Purana]]''.<ref name=pradhan207/> In these texts, this ''ardhanari'' is sometimes referred to as ''Ardharadhavenudhara [[murti]]'', and it symbolizes the complete union and inseparability of Radha and Krishna.<ref name=pradhan207>Shrikant Pradhan (2008), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/42931207 A UNIQUE IMAGE OF \"ARDHARADHAVENUDHARAMURTI: OR \"ARDHANARI KRISHNA\"], Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute, Vol. 68/69 (2008\u20132009), pp. 207\u2013213</ref>\n\nBirthplace of Radha is actually Raval which is near Gokul but is often said to be Barsana where she lived after her marriage. It is in Barsana that the Lathmar Holi is practised depicting the episode of Krishna going to Barsana and then running away escaping the beating from the womenfolk of Barsana.

Other [[gopi]]s are usually considered to be self-willing maidservants (Sevika) of Radha. Radharani's superiority is seen in Krishna's flute, which repeats the name Radha. Between Radha and Rukmini, Radha is superior.\n\nRadha's connection to Krishna is of two types: ''svakiya-rasa'' (married relationship) and ''parakiya-rasa'' (a relationship signified with eternal mental \"love\"). The Gaudiya tradition focuses upon ''parakiya-rasa'' as the highest form of love, wherein Radha and Krishna share thoughts even through separation. The love the gopis feel for Krishna is also described in this esoteric manner as the highest platform of spontaneous love of God, and not of a sexual nature.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Nimbarka===\n\n[[Nimbarka]] was the first well known [[Vaishnava]] scholar whose theology centered on goddess Radha.<ref name=Singh2004>{{cite journal | author = Singh, K.B. | year = 2004 | title = Manipur Vaishnavism: A Sociological Interpretat1on | journal = Sociology of Religion in India | isbn = 978-0-7619-9781-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2cIOqGcvHqoC&pg=PA125 | accessdate = 2008-05-03}}</ref><ref name=Kinsley1972>{{cite journal | author = Kinsley, D. | year = 2010 | title = Without Krsna There Is No Song | journal = History of Religions | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | page = 149 | url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&sa=G&oi=qs&q=nimbarka+radha+first+author:d-sarma | accessdate = 2008-05-03 | doi = 10.1086/462672}} \"Nimbarka seems to have been the first well-known religious leader to regard Radha as central to his worship (thirteenth century)\"</ref>\n\n==Temples==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Prem Mandir - Vrindaban 2013-02-22 4834.JPG\n| width1 = 250\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Radha Krishna Statue at Gokarneshwor Mahadev Temple Premises, Gokarna, Kathmandu.jpg\n| width2 = 110\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left:Radha-Krishna ''Prem Mandir'' (Love Temple) in Vrindavan, [[Uttar Pradesh]]; Right: Krishna-Radha in Gokarneshwar temple, [[Nepal]].\n}}\nRadha and Krishna are the focus of temples in the Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Vallabhacharya, Chandidas and other traditions of Vaishnavism.<ref name=dalal321/> She is typically shown standing immediately next to Krishna.<ref name=dalal321/> Some important Radha temples are:\n*[[Barsana]] and [[Vrindavan]] in [[Mathura District]], Northern India contain a large number of temples dedicated to both Radha and Krishna, including the Radhavallabh Temple.<ref>[http://www.radhavallabh.com Radhavallabh Temple]</ref> Sri Sri Radha Parthasarathi Mandir in [[Delhi]] is also the Radha krishna Temple.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.radha.name/images-gallery/temples-worldwide-without-india/asia-without-India|title=Asia and India ISKCON temples|work=Radha}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n |url          = http://m.dandavats.com/?p=6770\n |work         = Dandavats\n |title        = Archived copy\n |access-date  = 29 July 2015\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150626112447/http://m.dandavats.com/?p=6770\n |archive-date = 26 June 2015\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n* The [[Radha Madhav Dham#Shree Raseshwari Radha Rani Temple|Shree Raseshwari Radha Rani Temple]] at [[Radha Madhav Dham]] in [[Austin, Texas]], USA, established by [[Jagadguru Kripalu Maharaj|Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj]], is one of the largest Hindu Temple complexes in the [[Western Hemisphere]],<ref name=\"hua\">''[http://hua.edu/media/mediasupportfiles/newsletters_brochures/HU-Newsletter-7-03.pdf Vedic Foundation Inaugurated at Barsana Dham, Austin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818030758/http://hua.edu/media/mediasupportfiles/newsletters_brochures/HU-Newsletter-7-03.pdf |date=18 August 2011 }}''.

Both Radha and Krishna are the main characters of the ''[[Gita Govinda]]'' by Jayadeva Gosvami.<ref name=mmwradha/>\n\nHit Harivansh's and Swami Haridas' books consider Radha the main deity. Here, Radha is not an avatar of Laxmi but a form of Bhagavan Shri Krishna Himself. In the ''Devi Bhagavat'' and ''Brahma Vaivarta Purana,'' Radha is given as the source of infinite Laxmis, Gopis, and the mother of infinite souls.\n\nThe ''Narada-pancaratra'' states, \"Radha is Gokulesvari, the full embodiment of spontaneous love and the personification of mahabhava [the highest spiritual state]. Bhagavan Sri Krishna, who is the supreme Isvara of all existence and the God among gods, is attained by Her mercy. Sri Radha is Krsna\u2019s internal potency, and She performs worship of Her most beloved Sri Krsna with the entire wealth of Her devotion and service.\"\n\nIn ''Sammohana-tantra,'' Durga Devi says, \"The name Durga, by which I am known, is Her name. The qualities for which I am famous are Her qualities. The majesty with which I am resplendent is Her majesty. That Maha-Laksmi, Sri Radha, is nondifferent from Sri Krsna. She is His dearmost sweetheart and the crest-jewel of His beloveds.\"\n\nIn Caitanya Charitamrta (Adi-Lila 4.56), Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami says, \"''Radha Krishna Ek Atma, Dui Dui Dehadari, Anyaoone Vilase Rasasvadana Kori\".'' This means that both Radha and Krishna are one soul who take the form of two individual bodies so that they can cherish different mood of love (rasa).<ref>Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami, [https://vrajvrindavan.com/radha/ R\u0101dh\u0101], ''[[Chaitanya Charitamrita|Caitanya Caritamrta]]'' Adi-Lila 4.56</ref>\n\nJagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj elaborately described the virtue of Radha and has given a brief description of Shri Radha in his lectures and ''Kirtans''.

Other [[gopi]]s are usually considered to be self-willing maidservants (Sevika) of Radha. Radharani's superiority is seen in Krishna's flute, which repeats the name Radha. Between Radha and Rukmini, Radha is superior.\n\nRadha's connection to Krishna is of two types: ''svakiya-rasa'' (married relationship) and ''parakiya-rasa'' (a relationship signified with eternal mental \"love\"). The Gaudiya tradition focuses upon ''parakiya-rasa'' as the highest form of love, wherein Radha and Krishna share thoughts even through separation. The love the gopis feel for Krishna is also described in this esoteric manner as the highest platform of spontaneous love of God, and not of a sexual nature.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Nimbarka===\n\n[[Nimbarka]] was the first well known [[Vaishnava]] scholar whose theology centered on goddess Radha.<ref name=Singh2004>{{cite journal | author = Singh, K.B. | year = 2004 | title = Manipur Vaishnavism: A Sociological Interpretat1on | journal = Sociology of Religion in India | isbn = 978-0-7619-9781-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2cIOqGcvHqoC&pg=PA125 | accessdate = 2008-05-03}}</ref><ref name=Kinsley1972>{{cite journal | author = Kinsley, D. | year = 2010 | title = Without Krsna There Is No Song | journal = History of Religions | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | page = 149 | url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&sa=G&oi=qs&q=nimbarka+radha+first+author:d-sarma | accessdate = 2008-05-03 | doi = 10.1086/462672}} \"Nimbarka seems to have been the first well-known religious leader to regard Radha as central to his worship (thirteenth century)\"</ref>\n\n==Temples==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Prem Mandir - Vrindaban 2013-02-22 4834.JPG\n| width1 = 250\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Radha Krishna Statue at Gokarneshwor Mahadev Temple Premises, Gokarna, Kathmandu.jpg\n| width2 = 110\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left:Radha-Krishna ''Prem Mandir'' (Love Temple) in Vrindavan, [[Uttar Pradesh]]; Right: Krishna-Radha in Gokarneshwar temple, [[Nepal]].\n}}\nRadha and Krishna are the focus of temples in the Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Vallabhacharya, Chandidas and other traditions of Vaishnavism.<ref name=dalal321/> She is typically shown standing immediately next to Krishna.<ref name=dalal321/> Some important Radha temples are:\n*[[Barsana]] and [[Vrindavan]] in [[Mathura District]], Northern India contain a large number of temples dedicated to both Radha and Krishna, including the Radhavallabh Temple.<ref>[http://www.radhavallabh.com Radhavallabh Temple]</ref> Sri Sri Radha Parthasarathi Mandir in [[Delhi]] is also the Radha krishna Temple.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.radha.name/images-gallery/temples-worldwide-without-india/asia-without-India|title=Asia and India ISKCON temples|work=Radha}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n |url          = http://m.dandavats.com/?p=6770\n |work         = Dandavats\n |title        = Archived copy\n |access-date  = 29 July 2015\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150626112447/http://m.dandavats.com/?p=6770\n |archive-date = 26 June 2015\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n* The [[Radha Madhav Dham#Shree Raseshwari Radha Rani Temple|Shree Raseshwari Radha Rani Temple]] at [[Radha Madhav Dham]] in [[Austin, Texas]], USA, established by [[Jagadguru Kripalu Maharaj|Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj]], is one of the largest Hindu Temple complexes in the [[Western Hemisphere]],<ref name=\"hua\">''[http://hua.edu/media/mediasupportfiles/newsletters_brochures/HU-Newsletter-7-03.pdf Vedic Foundation Inaugurated at Barsana Dham, Austin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818030758/http://hua.edu/media/mediasupportfiles/newsletters_brochures/HU-Newsletter-7-03.pdf |date=18 August 2011 }}''.
