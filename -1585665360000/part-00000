Tramlink then follows the former [[Woodside and South Croydon Railway]] (W&SCR) to reach the current Addiscombe tram stop, adjacent to the site of the demolished [[Bingham Road railway station]]. It continues along the former railway route to near Sandilands where Tramlink curves sharply towards Sandilands tram stop. Another route from Sandilands tram stop curves sharply on to the W&SCR before passing through Park Hill (or Sandilands) tunnels and to the site of [[Coombe Road railway station]] after which it curves away across [[Lloyd Park (Croydon)|Lloyd Park]].\n\nTramlink follows the former [[West Croydon to Wimbledon Line]], which was first opened in 1855 and closed on 31 May 1997 to allow for conversion into Tramlink.<ref>{{Cite journal |year=2002 |journal=[[Railway Magazine]] |volume=148 |page=51 |issn=0033-8923}}</ref> Within this section, from near Phipps Bridge to near Reeves Corner, Tramlink follows the [[Surrey Iron Railway]], giving Tramlink a claim to one of the world's oldest railway alignments \u2013 {{gbmapscaled|TQ273680|300|Tramway Path}} beside Mitcham tram stop.

The colour of the cars was changed to green, and the brand name was changed from Croydon Tramlink to simply Tramlink.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/latestnews/s-green-Tramlink/article-385546-detail/article.html|title=It's green for go at Tramlink|last=Kottegoda|first=Maheesha|date=9 October 2008|work=Croydon Advertiser|accessdate=10 October 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009215248/http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/latestnews/s-green-Tramlink/article-385546-detail/article.html|archivedate=9 October 2008}}</ref> These refurbishments were completed in early 2009.\n\n==Current system==\n\n===Stops===\n[[File:Croydon Tramlink Addiscombe Road.jpg|thumb|right|Tram 2530 leaving Croydon on an [[Elmers End station|Elmers End]] service in 2004]]\n\nThe tram stops have low platforms, {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} above rail level. They are unstaffed and had automated ticket machines that are no longer in use due to TfL making trams cashless. In general, access between the platforms involves crossing the tracks by pedestrian level crossing.\nThere are 39 stops, most being {{convert|32.2|m|abbr=on}} long. They are virtually level with the doors and are all wider than {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}}. This allows [[wheelchair]]s, [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|prams]], [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|pushchairs]] and the elderly to board the tram easily with no steps. In street sections, the stop is integrated with the pavement.\n\nTramlink uses some former main-line stations on the Wimbledon\u2013West Croydon and Elmers End\u2013Coombe Lane stretches of line. The railway platforms have been demolished and rebuilt to Tramlink specifications, except at Elmers End and Wimbledon where the track level was raised to meet the higher main-line platforms to enable [[cross-platform interchange]].\n\nThirty-eight stops opened in the phased introduction of tram services in May 2000. [[Centrale tram stop]] in Tamworth Road opened on 10 December 2005, increasing journey times slightly. As turnround times were already quite tight this raised the issue of buying an extra tram to maintain punctuality. Partly for this reason but also to take into account the planned restructuring of services (subsequently introduced in July 2006), TfL issued tenders for a new tram. However, nothing resulted from this.\n\nAll stops have disabled access, raised paving, CCTV, a Passenger Help Point, a Passenger Information Display (PID), litter bins, a ticket machine, a noticeboard and lamp-posts, and most also have seats and a shelter.\n\nThe PIDs display the destinations and expected arrival times of the next two trams. They can also display any message the controllers want to display, such as information on delays or even safety instructions for vandals to stop putting rubbish or other objects onto the track.\n\n===Routes===\n[[File:Tramlink Route 2 at Beckenham Junction.jpg|thumb|Tram 2545 in original livery at [[Beckenham Junction]] in 2001.]]\n[[File:Tramlink-Tram2536-03.jpg|thumb|Tram 2536 in the second livery at [[Morden Road tram stop|Morden Road]], heading towards Wimbledon in 2006.]]\n[[File:Tram at Reeves Corner, Croydon - geograph.org.uk - 1238898.jpg|thumb|A tram leaving Croydon towards Wimbledon, going past [[Reeves Corner]] in 2009.]]\n[[File:Au Morandarte Flickr Tramlink 2558 on Route 1, East Croydon (9756077682).jpg|thumb|Tram 2558 at [[East Croydon]] in 2013.]]\n\nTramlink has been shown on the principal [[tube map]] since 1 June 2016, having previously appeared only on the [[Tube map#Official versions of the Tube map|\"London Connections\" map]].\n\nWhen Tramlink first opened it had three routes: Line 1 (yellow) from [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] to [[Elmers End station|Elmers End]], Line 2 (red) from Croydon to [[Beckenham Junction station|Beckenham Junction]], and Line 3 (green) from Croydon to [[New Addington tram stop|New Addington]].<ref name=\"Tramlink p 10\">''Tramlink: Your top 10 questions answered\u2026'' Poster, 1995.</ref> On 23 July 2006 the network was restructured, with Route 1 from Elmers End to Croydon, Route 2 from Beckenham Junction to Croydon and Route 3 from New Addington to Wimbledon. In June 2012 Route 4 from Therapia Lane to Elmers End was introduced. On Monday 4 April 2016, Route 4 was extended from Therapia Lane to Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Transport for London]]|title=Tram-endous boost for travellers|url=https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/news-articles/tram-endous-boost-for-travellers|date=4 April 2016|access-date=19 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513142204/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/news-articles/tram-endous-boost-for-travellers|archive-date=13 May 2016 }}</ref>\n\nOn 25 February 2018, the network and timetables were restructured again for more even and reliable services.

However, in the final masterplan planning application approved by Croydon Council and the Mayor of London, commitment by the Croydon Partnership to partially funding the loop was withdrawn, leading TfL and Croydon Council to review the affordability of the scheme.<ref>https://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/news/croydon-news/doubt-cast-over-funding-croydon-1387988</ref> In May 2018, it was announced a third of the cost for Elmers End improvements would be funded from the TfL Growth Fund, with work proposed to start later in the year.<ref>http://www.metro-report.com/news/single-view/view/london-tram-enhancements-included-in-growth-fund.html</ref>\n\n====Phase B====\nAn increase in capacity westwards from Croydon centre could support housing growth at industrial and commercial areas in the Wandle Valley area; this could help fund the schemes through a housing levy, although this would require changes in planning allocation from both Croydon and Sutton councils.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> To achieve this, dual-tracking between Beddington Lane and Mitcham Junction and a second platform at Wimbledon was completed in November 2015, allowing for an initial 50% increase in capacity when the network was extended to Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite press release |url= https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |title= Wimbledon tram stop reopens with new platform |author= Transport for London |website= tfl.gov.uk |accessdate= 9 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170729054724/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |archivedate= 29 July 2017 }}</ref> To further increase capacity by ~150%, a series of bottlenecks are proposed to be either resolved or avoided: as well as dual-tracking of line at Phipps Bridge and on the Wandle Flyover (between Reeves Corner and Wandle Park), a new route has been proposed between a spur in [[South Wimbledon tube station|South Wimbledon]] or [[Colliers Wood tube station|Colliers Wood]] and a reversing loop in Old Town, Croydon to avoid constraints at Wimbledon station and in Croydon.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This line could provide connections to the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification and the Northern Line, as well as supporting connections to the proposed [[London Overground#Future acquisitions|South London Metro]] at Mitcham Junction and West Croydon.<ref name=\"london.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The new service could initially run between Morden Road and Croydon before being extended to the new spur.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> New stops would be built in South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood and in Old Town (initially proposed as Frith Road), as well as an additional platform at Reeves Corner for westward services.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This plan may be in service by 2023.<ref name=\"gov.uk\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 July 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425134041/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |archivedate=25 April 2017  }}</ref>\n\n====Phase C====\nA 25% increase in capacity could be achieved by the introduction of another passing loop on the Beckenham Junction branch; the extra services could either be fed through Croydon centre or around the Dingwall Loop; this could be in place by 2027.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/> Furthermore, if extra capacity is required, tram stops could be lengthened to serve either longer trams or two trams coupled together on services between Wimbledon and Beckenham Junction or Elmers End; however, the expense required as well as issues from lengthening stops in the Croydon centre may prevent this.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThis would be in place by 2029.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/>\n\n====Other developments====\nThese developments could see an increase in fleet from 30 to up to 80 trams (depending on whether longer trams or coupled trams are used). As such, an increase in depot and stabling capacity across the whole 15-year plan is also required; an enlargement of the current Therapia Lane site as well as sites near the Elmers End and Harrington Road tram stops have been shortlisted.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> Furthermore, plans for increases in capacity at Wimbledon are supported long-term with the redesign of the station as part of plans of Crossrail 2 and at East Croydon as part of plans for an upgrade of the [[Brighton Main Line]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThe plan also is designed to accommodate the long-term aim of extending services to Crystal Palace.\n\n===Sutton to Wimbledon (Sutton Link)===\nThe only Tramlink extension actively being pursued by the Mayor of London and TfL, as of 2018, is a new line between Sutton and Wimbledon ([[Sutton Link]]). Depending on the route chosen, this could support Opportunity Areas at Wimbledon and Sutton, the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification, the Morden Housing Zone, and intensification along the route at Rose Hill. The extension aims to support the delivery of at least 10,000 homes and thousands of jobs.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/new_london_plan_december_2017.pdf</ref> A further extension to the new London Cancer Hub on the same site of the [[The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust|Royal Marsden Hospital]] and [[Institute of Cancer Research]] in [[Belmont, Sutton|Belmont]] has also been proposed as a long-term part of the development.<ref>https://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200547/business/1514/the_london_cancer_hub/7</ref>\n\nIn the London 2050 infrastructure plan, an extension of the Tramlink to Sutton was given a medium priority with a timescale of 2030.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Transport%20Supporting%20Paper_3.pdf</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, Mayor [[Boris Johnson]] affirmed that there is a reasonable business case for Tramlink to cover the Wimbledon - Sutton corridor. A map has been released showing the planned route. It would leave the existing route just to the east of Morden Road and head along the A24 and A297 to Rosehill Roundabout, then the B2230 through Sutton town centre, ending at the station. A loop via St Helier Hospital and a possible extension to Royal Marsden Hospital also were proposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|title=Boris tells City Hall there is 'reasonable business case' for extending tram route to Sutton|website=Your Local Guardian|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120504/http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, a proposed \u00a3320m scheme for a new line to connect Wimbledon to Sutton via Morden was made and brought to consultation jointly by the London Boroughs of Merton and Sutton. The consultation aimed to gauge support for the extension, as well as for different routes proposed.<ref>https://www.opportunitysutton.org/wp-content/uploads/Tramlink_Report_FINAL1.pdf</ref> The consultation offered three choices of northern terminus (Wimbledon, South Wimbledon on-street, South Wimbledon off-street), with or without the loop serving St Helier's Hospital directly, and for the Sutton loop to either run entirely around the Sutton gyratory or divert north along the High Street. The results overwhelmingly supported the extension, with majorities supporting the northern terminus at Wimbledon, including a loop to serve St Helier's Hospital, and running entirely around the gyratory. Although \u00a3100m from TfL was initially secured in the draft 2016/17 budget,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonguardian.co.uk/news/14345323.TfL_commits___100m_to_extending_tram_network_from_Wimbledon_to_Sutton/|title=TfL commits \u00a3100m to extending tram network from Wimbledon to Sutton|website=Sutton Guardian}}</ref> this was subsequently reallocated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/100million-tram-link-between-croydon-and-sutton-in-doubt-as-mayor-of-london-shelves-funding/story-29969181-detail/story.html|title=Why Croydon's tram network may now not be extended to Sutton|date=10 December 2016}}</ref> The current Mayor of London, [[Sadiq Khan]] remains committed to the project however, and has called on the council to raise the shortfall in funding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonguardian.co.uk/news/14504564.Sadiq_Khan__Tram_extension_is_a_priority____but_don_t_hold_your_breath_/|title=Sadiq Khan: Tram extension is a priority - 'but don't hold your breath'|website=Sutton Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonguardian.co.uk/news/15043498._Show_more_ambition___Sutton_to_review_tram_extension_funding_as_Mayor_calls_on_council_to_pledge_more_money/|title='Show more ambition': Sutton to review tram extension funding as Mayor calls on council to pledge more money|website=Sutton Guardian}}</ref> It has been announced \u00a370m from the Mayor's Growth Fund had been allocated to the extension with a potential further \u00a330m being available in the next Tfl Business plan, subject to an acceptable business case and funding package being reached by 2020.<ref>http://content.tfl.gov.uk/pic-20171212-item08-growth-fund.pdf</ref><ref>https://moderngov.sutton.gov.uk/documents/s61496/Sutton%20Tram%20Update%20Report.pdf</ref> An additional \u00a350m has also been offered by the London Boroughs of Merton and Sutton.<ref>https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/14345323.tfl-commits-100m-to-extending-tram-network-from-wimbledon-to-sutton/</ref>\n\nAt the end of 2018, a TfL consultation opened on proposals for rapid transit between Sutton and Merton.<ref name=\"consultations.tfl.gov.uk\">https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/trams/sutton-link/</ref> The consultation proposed three potential routes:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!#!! Northern terminus!! Route\n|-\n|1 || [[South Wimbledon tube station]] || From South Wimbledon tube station along Morden Road (A24), interchange with [[Morden Road tram stop]], through [[Morden]] (300m from [[Morden tube station]], through Rose Hill and St Helier, follows Sutton gyratory\n|-\n|2 || [[Colliers Wood tube station]] || From Colliers Wood tube station along Church Road, interchange with [[Belgrave Walk tram stop]], along Morden Road (A239), through Rose Hill and St Helier, follows Sutton gyratory\n|-\n|3 || [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] ||Along [[Sutton Loop Line]] from Wimbledon, diverts from line at Collingwood Road before West Sutton, follows Sutton gyratory\n|}\n\nIt has been proposed that Routes 1 or 2 would cost \u00a3425m as a segregated tram line, but also could be delivered at \u00a3275m as a bus rapid transit (BRT) route. Also, both routes 1 and 2 had potential for a direct link between [[Wimbledon station]] (with route 2 the easier route) and a potential loop for a direct connection with [[St Helier Hospital]]. Route 3 however has only been proposed to be delivered as a tram route at \u00a3300m, with [[Thameslink]] services terminating at [[West Sutton railway station|West Sutton]] and Wimbledon. Services on the intermediate stations would however be more frequent as a tram service than currently. Work could begin in 2022, with aim for completing in 2025.<ref>https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/16832779.routes-for-the-wimbledon-sutton-tramlink-extension-revealed/</ref> Services to Wimbledon regardless of route would however be postponed several years to co-ordinate with Crossrail 2 works, due to the low capacity on tram platforms in the station and to limit disruption.\n\nIn February 2020, TfL announced their preference for a north\u2013south tramway between Colliers Wood and Sutton town centre for \u00a3425m on the condition of securing additional funding.<ref name=\"consultations.tfl.gov.uk\"/>\n\n===Projected extensions===\nThe Mayor's Transport Strategy for London states that extensions to the network could be developed at relatively modest cost where there is potential demand from existing and new development to support concentrated passenger movements, and where Tramlink technology might be cost effective. Proposal 4D7 says that \"The Mayor will explore the potential for extending the Tramlink network where doing so could help meet the objectives of the Transport Strategy cost effectively\"<ref>[http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/transport/pdf/final_ch04d.pdf London Dockland and Croydon Tramlink Extensions] {{webarchive |url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090713203635/http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/transport/pdf/final_ch04d.pdf |date=13 July 2009 }}</ref> and sought initial views on the viability of a number of extensions by summer 2002.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Extension!!

Beyond Purley, an extension to [[Coulsdon]] will be investigated. As this would be close to the [[M23 motorway]], a possibility would be the construction of a [[park and ride]] site. Finding a good alignment will be more difficult south of Purley, where Brighton Road is the [[A23 road|A23 trunk road]].<ref name=\"spext\"/>\n\nTo the north of Croydon, it is proposed to use a highway alignment based on London Road. To the south of [[Thornton Heath Pond]], the use of a shared carriageway is a possibility. North of this point the road becomes the A23 again, but there are likely to be some opportunities for [[trambaan]] type segregation to [[Norbury]] and between Norbury and Streatham, although Norbury is a pinch point.

It began operation in 2000, the first tram system in London since 1952.

Tramlink then follows the former [[Woodside and South Croydon Railway]] (W&SCR) to reach the current Addiscombe tram stop, adjacent to the site of the demolished [[Bingham Road railway station]]. It continues along the former railway route to near Sandilands where Tramlink curves sharply towards Sandilands tram stop. Another route from Sandilands tram stop curves sharply on to the W&SCR before passing through Park Hill (or Sandilands) tunnels and to the site of [[Coombe Road railway station]] after which it curves away across [[Lloyd Park (Croydon)|Lloyd Park]].\n\nTramlink follows the former [[West Croydon to Wimbledon Line]], which was first opened in 1855 and closed on 31 May 1997 to allow for conversion into Tramlink.<ref>{{Cite journal |year=2002 |journal=[[Railway Magazine]] |volume=148 |page=51 |issn=0033-8923}}</ref> Within this section, from near Phipps Bridge to near Reeves Corner, Tramlink follows the [[Surrey Iron Railway]], giving Tramlink a claim to one of the world's oldest railway alignments \u2013 {{gbmapscaled|TQ273680|300|Tramway Path}} beside Mitcham tram stop.

In 2007 that payment was \u00a34m, with an annual increase in rate.<ref name=tfln7741>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/7741.aspx|title=TfL announces plans to take over Tramlink services|accessdate=18 March 2008 |publisher=[[Transport for London]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080412011803/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/7741.aspx |archivedate = 12 April 2008}}</ref> FirstGroup will continue to operate the service until 2030.<ref>[https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/what-we-do/london-trams London Trams] Transport for London</ref><ref>News in Brief ''Railway Gazette International'' August 2008 page 479</ref>\n\nIn October 2008 TfL introduced a new livery, using the blue, white and green of the routes on TfL maps, to distinguish the trams from buses operating in the area. The colour of the cars was changed to green, and the brand name was changed from Croydon Tramlink to simply Tramlink.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/latestnews/s-green-Tramlink/article-385546-detail/article.html|title=It's green for go at Tramlink|last=Kottegoda|first=Maheesha|date=9 October 2008|work=Croydon Advertiser|accessdate=10 October 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009215248/http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/latestnews/s-green-Tramlink/article-385546-detail/article.html|archivedate=9 October 2008}}</ref> These refurbishments were completed in early 2009.\n\n==Current system==\n\n===Stops===\n[[File:Croydon Tramlink Addiscombe Road.jpg|thumb|right|Tram 2530 leaving Croydon on an [[Elmers End station|Elmers End]] service in 2004]]\n\nThe tram stops have low platforms, {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} above rail level. They are unstaffed and had automated ticket machines that are no longer in use due to TfL making trams cashless. In general, access between the platforms involves crossing the tracks by pedestrian level crossing.\nThere are 39 stops, most being {{convert|32.2|m|abbr=on}} long. They are virtually level with the doors and are all wider than {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}}. This allows [[wheelchair]]s, [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|prams]], [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|pushchairs]] and the elderly to board the tram easily with no steps. In street sections, the stop is integrated with the pavement.\n\nTramlink uses some former main-line stations on the Wimbledon\u2013West Croydon and Elmers End\u2013Coombe Lane stretches of line. The railway platforms have been demolished and rebuilt to Tramlink specifications, except at Elmers End and Wimbledon where the track level was raised to meet the higher main-line platforms to enable [[cross-platform interchange]].\n\nThirty-eight stops opened in the phased introduction of tram services in May 2000. [[Centrale tram stop]] in Tamworth Road opened on 10 December 2005, increasing journey times slightly. As turnround times were already quite tight this raised the issue of buying an extra tram to maintain punctuality. Partly for this reason but also to take into account the planned restructuring of services (subsequently introduced in July 2006), TfL issued tenders for a new tram. However, nothing resulted from this.\n\nAll stops have disabled access, raised paving, CCTV, a Passenger Help Point, a Passenger Information Display (PID), litter bins, a ticket machine, a noticeboard and lamp-posts, and most also have seats and a shelter.\n\nThe PIDs display the destinations and expected arrival times of the next two trams. They can also display any message the controllers want to display, such as information on delays or even safety instructions for vandals to stop putting rubbish or other objects onto the track.\n\n===Routes===\n[[File:Tramlink Route 2 at Beckenham Junction.jpg|thumb|Tram 2545 in original livery at [[Beckenham Junction]] in 2001.]]\n[[File:Tramlink-Tram2536-03.jpg|thumb|Tram 2536 in the second livery at [[Morden Road tram stop|Morden Road]], heading towards Wimbledon in 2006.]]\n[[File:Tram at Reeves Corner, Croydon - geograph.org.uk - 1238898.jpg|thumb|A tram leaving Croydon towards Wimbledon, going past [[Reeves Corner]] in 2009.]]\n[[File:Au Morandarte Flickr Tramlink 2558 on Route 1, East Croydon (9756077682).jpg|thumb|Tram 2558 at [[East Croydon]] in 2013.]]\n\nTramlink has been shown on the principal [[tube map]] since 1 June 2016, having previously appeared only on the [[Tube map#Official versions of the Tube map|\"London Connections\" map]].\n\nWhen Tramlink first opened it had three routes: Line 1 (yellow) from [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] to [[Elmers End station|Elmers End]], Line 2 (red) from Croydon to [[Beckenham Junction station|Beckenham Junction]], and Line 3 (green) from Croydon to [[New Addington tram stop|New Addington]].<ref name=\"Tramlink p 10\">''Tramlink: Your top 10 questions answered\u2026'' Poster, 1995.</ref> On 23 July 2006 the network was restructured, with Route 1 from Elmers End to Croydon, Route 2 from Beckenham Junction to Croydon and Route 3 from New Addington to Wimbledon. In June 2012 Route 4 from Therapia Lane to Elmers End was introduced. On Monday 4 April 2016, Route 4 was extended from Therapia Lane to Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Transport for London]]|title=Tram-endous boost for travellers|url=https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/news-articles/tram-endous-boost-for-travellers|date=4 April 2016|access-date=19 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513142204/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/news-articles/tram-endous-boost-for-travellers|archive-date=13 May 2016 }}</ref>\n\nOn 25 February 2018, the network and timetables were restructured again for more even and reliable services.

However, in the final masterplan planning application approved by Croydon Council and the Mayor of London, commitment by the Croydon Partnership to partially funding the loop was withdrawn, leading TfL and Croydon Council to review the affordability of the scheme.<ref>https://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/news/croydon-news/doubt-cast-over-funding-croydon-1387988</ref> In May 2018, it was announced a third of the cost for Elmers End improvements would be funded from the TfL Growth Fund, with work proposed to start later in the year.<ref>http://www.metro-report.com/news/single-view/view/london-tram-enhancements-included-in-growth-fund.html</ref>\n\n====Phase B====\nAn increase in capacity westwards from Croydon centre could support housing growth at industrial and commercial areas in the Wandle Valley area; this could help fund the schemes through a housing levy, although this would require changes in planning allocation from both Croydon and Sutton councils.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> To achieve this, dual-tracking between Beddington Lane and Mitcham Junction and a second platform at Wimbledon was completed in November 2015, allowing for an initial 50% increase in capacity when the network was extended to Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite press release |url= https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |title= Wimbledon tram stop reopens with new platform |author= Transport for London |website= tfl.gov.uk |accessdate= 9 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170729054724/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |archivedate= 29 July 2017 }}</ref> To further increase capacity by ~150%, a series of bottlenecks are proposed to be either resolved or avoided: as well as dual-tracking of line at Phipps Bridge and on the Wandle Flyover (between Reeves Corner and Wandle Park), a new route has been proposed between a spur in [[South Wimbledon tube station|South Wimbledon]] or [[Colliers Wood tube station|Colliers Wood]] and a reversing loop in Old Town, Croydon to avoid constraints at Wimbledon station and in Croydon.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This line could provide connections to the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification and the Northern Line, as well as supporting connections to the proposed [[London Overground#Future acquisitions|South London Metro]] at Mitcham Junction and West Croydon.<ref name=\"london.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The new service could initially run between Morden Road and Croydon before being extended to the new spur.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> New stops would be built in South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood and in Old Town (initially proposed as Frith Road), as well as an additional platform at Reeves Corner for westward services.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This plan may be in service by 2023.<ref name=\"gov.uk\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425134041/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |archivedate=25 April 2017  }}</ref>\n\n====Phase C====\nA 25% increase in capacity could be achieved by the introduction of another passing loop on the Beckenham Junction branch; the extra services could either be fed through Croydon centre or around the Dingwall Loop; this could be in place by 2027.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/> Furthermore, if extra capacity is required, tram stops could be lengthened to serve either longer trams or two trams coupled together on services between Wimbledon and Beckenham Junction or Elmers End; however, the expense required as well as issues from lengthening stops in the Croydon centre may prevent this.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThis would be in place by 2029.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/>\n\n====Other developments====\nThese developments could see an increase in fleet from 30 to up to 80 trams (depending on whether longer trams or coupled trams are used). As such, an increase in depot and stabling capacity across the whole 15-year plan is also required; an enlargement of the current Therapia Lane site as well as sites near the Elmers End and Harrington Road tram stops have been shortlisted.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> Furthermore, plans for increases in capacity at Wimbledon are supported long-term with the redesign of the station as part of plans of Crossrail 2 and at East Croydon as part of plans for an upgrade of the [[Brighton Main Line]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThe plan also is designed to accommodate the long-term aim of extending services to Crystal Palace.\n\n===Sutton to Wimbledon (Sutton Link)===\nThe only Tramlink extension actively being pursued by the Mayor of London and TfL, as of 2018, is a new line between Sutton and Wimbledon ([[Sutton Link]]). Depending on the route chosen, this could support Opportunity Areas at Wimbledon and Sutton, the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification, the Morden Housing Zone, and intensification along the route at Rose Hill. The extension aims to support the delivery of at least 10,000 homes and thousands of jobs.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/new_london_plan_december_2017.pdf</ref> A further extension to the new London Cancer Hub on the same site of the [[The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust|Royal Marsden Hospital]] and [[Institute of Cancer Research]] in [[Belmont, Sutton|Belmont]] has also been proposed as a long-term part of the development.<ref>https://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200547/business/1514/the_london_cancer_hub/7</ref>\n\nIn the London 2050 infrastructure plan, an extension of the Tramlink to Sutton was given a medium priority with a timescale of 2030.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Transport%20Supporting%20Paper_3.pdf</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, Mayor [[Boris Johnson]] affirmed that there is a reasonable business case for Tramlink to cover the Wimbledon - Sutton corridor. A map has been released showing the planned route. It would leave the existing route just to the east of Morden Road and head along the A24 and A297 to Rosehill Roundabout, then the B2230 through Sutton town centre, ending at the station. A loop via St Helier Hospital and a possible extension to Royal Marsden Hospital also were proposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|title=Boris tells City Hall there is 'reasonable business case' for extending tram route to Sutton|website=Your Local Guardian|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120504/http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, a proposed \u00a3320m scheme for a new line to connect Wimbledon to Sutton via Morden was made and brought to consultation jointly by the London Boroughs of Merton and Sutton. The consultation aimed to gauge support for the extension, as well as for different routes proposed.<ref>https://www.opportunitysutton.org/wp-content/uploads/Tramlink_Report_FINAL1.pdf</ref> The consultation offered three choices of northern terminus (Wimbledon, South Wimbledon on-street, South Wimbledon off-street), with or without the loop serving St Helier's Hospital directly, and for the Sutton loop to either run entirely around the Sutton gyratory or divert north along the High Street. The results overwhelmingly supported the extension, with majorities supporting the northern terminus at Wimbledon, including a loop to serve St Helier's Hospital, and running entirely around the gyratory. Although \u00a3100m from TfL was initially secured in the draft 2016/17 budget,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonguardian.co.uk/news/14345323.TfL_commits___100m_to_extending_tram_network_from_Wimbledon_to_Sutton/|title=TfL commits \u00a3100m to extending tram network from Wimbledon to Sutton|website=Sutton Guardian}}</ref> this was subsequently reallocated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/100million-tram-link-between-croydon-and-sutton-in-doubt-as-mayor-of-london-shelves-funding/story-29969181-detail/story.html|title=Why Croydon's tram network may now not be extended to Sutton|date=10 December 2016}}</ref> The current Mayor of London, [[Sadiq Khan]] remains committed to the project however, and has called on the council to raise the shortfall in funding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonguardian.co.uk/news/14504564.Sadiq_Khan__Tram_extension_is_a_priority____but_don_t_hold_your_breath_/|title=Sadiq Khan: Tram extension is a priority - 'but don't hold your breath'|website=Sutton Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonguardian.co.uk/news/15043498._Show_more_ambition___Sutton_to_review_tram_extension_funding_as_Mayor_calls_on_council_to_pledge_more_money/|title='Show more ambition': Sutton to review tram extension funding as Mayor calls on council to pledge more money|website=Sutton Guardian}}</ref> It has been announced \u00a370m from the Mayor's Growth Fund had been allocated to the extension with a potential further \u00a330m being available in the next Tfl Business plan, subject to an acceptable business case and funding package being reached by 2020.<ref>http://content.tfl.gov.uk/pic-20171212-item08-growth-fund.pdf</ref><ref>https://moderngov.sutton.gov.uk/documents/s61496/Sutton%20Tram%20Update%20Report.pdf</ref> An additional \u00a350m has also been offered by the London Boroughs of Merton and Sutton.<ref>https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/14345323.tfl-commits-100m-to-extending-tram-network-from-wimbledon-to-sutton/</ref>\n\nAt the end of 2018, a TfL consultation opened on proposals for rapid transit between Sutton and Merton.<ref name=\"consultations.tfl.gov.uk\">https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/trams/sutton-link/</ref> The consultation proposed three potential routes:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!#!! Northern terminus!! Route\n|-\n|1 || [[South Wimbledon tube station]] || From South Wimbledon tube station along Morden Road (A24), interchange with [[Morden Road tram stop]], through [[Morden]] (300m from [[Morden tube station]], through Rose Hill and St Helier, follows Sutton gyratory\n|-\n|2 || [[Colliers Wood tube station]] || From Colliers Wood tube station along Church Road, interchange with [[Belgrave Walk tram stop]], along Morden Road (A239), through Rose Hill and St Helier, follows Sutton gyratory\n|-\n|3 || [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] ||Along [[Sutton Loop Line]] from Wimbledon, diverts from line at Collingwood Road before West Sutton, follows Sutton gyratory\n|}\n\nIt has been proposed that Routes 1 or 2 would cost \u00a3425m as a segregated tram line, but also could be delivered at \u00a3275m as a bus rapid transit (BRT) route. Also, both routes 1 and 2 had potential for a direct link between [[Wimbledon station]] (with route 2 the easier route) and a potential loop for a direct connection with [[St Helier Hospital]]. Route 3 however has only been proposed to be delivered as a tram route at \u00a3300m, with [[Thameslink]] services terminating at [[West Sutton railway station|West Sutton]] and Wimbledon. Services on the intermediate stations would however be more frequent as a tram service than currently. Work could begin in 2022, with aim for completing in 2025.<ref>https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/16832779.routes-for-the-wimbledon-sutton-tramlink-extension-revealed/</ref> Services to Wimbledon regardless of route would however be postponed several years to co-ordinate with Crossrail 2 works, due to the low capacity on tram platforms in the station and to limit disruption.\n\nIn February 2020, TfL announced their preference for a north\u2013south tramway between Colliers Wood and Sutton town centre for \u00a3425m on the condition of securing additional funding.<ref name=\"consultations.tfl.gov.uk\"/>\n\n===Projected extensions===\nThe Mayor's Transport Strategy for London states that extensions to the network could be developed at relatively modest cost where there is potential demand from existing and new development to support concentrated passenger movements, and where Tramlink technology might be cost effective. Proposal 4D7 says that \"The Mayor will explore the potential for extending the Tramlink network where doing so could help meet the objectives of the Transport Strategy cost effectively\"<ref>[http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/transport/pdf/final_ch04d.pdf London Dockland and Croydon Tramlink Extensions] {{webarchive |url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090713203635/http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/transport/pdf/final_ch04d.pdf |date=13 July 2009 }}</ref> and sought initial views on the viability of a number of extensions by summer 2002.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Extension!!

Beyond Purley, an extension to [[Coulsdon]] will be investigated. As this would be close to the [[M23 motorway]], a possibility would be the construction of a [[park and ride]] site. Finding a good alignment will be more difficult south of Purley, where Brighton Road is the [[A23 road|A23 trunk road]].<ref name=\"spext\"/>\n\nTo the north of Croydon, it is proposed to use a highway alignment based on London Road. To the south of [[Thornton Heath Pond]], the use of a shared carriageway is a possibility. North of this point the road becomes the A23 again, but there are likely to be some opportunities for [[trambaan]] type segregation to [[Norbury]] and between Norbury and Streatham, although Norbury is a pinch point.

Fleming based the character on a number of people he knew who commanded sections of British intelligence. M has appeared in the novels by Fleming and seven continuation authors, as well as appearing in twenty-four films. In the [[Eon Productions]] [[James Bond in film|series of films]], M has been portrayed by four actors: [[Bernard Lee]], [[Robert Brown (British actor)|Robert Brown]], [[Judi Dench]] and [[Ralph Fiennes]], the incumbent; in the two independent productions, M was played by [[John Huston]], [[David Niven]] and [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Vice Admiral Godfrey WWII IWM A 20777.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Rear Admiral [[John Henry Godfrey]], Fleming's superior at the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] and a basis for M.]]\nFleming based much of M's character on [[Rear Admiral]] [[John Henry Godfrey|John Godfrey]], who was Fleming's superior at the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] during the [[Second World War]].

In the final novel of the series, ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'', M's full identity is revealed as [[Vice Admiral]] Sir Miles Messervy [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]];{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=74}} Messervy had been appointed to head of MI6 after his predecessor had been assassinated at his desk.{{sfn|Griswold|2006|p=47}}\n\nA naval theme runs throughout Fleming's description of M and his surroundings, and his character was described by journalist and Bond scholar [[Ben Macintyre]] as \"every inch the naval martinet\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=74}} Macintyre also notes that in his study of Fleming's work, [[Kingsley Amis]] outlined the way Fleming had described M's voice, being: angry (three times); brutal, cold (seven times); curt, dry (five times); gruff (seven times); stern, testy (five times).{{sfn|Amis|1966|p=75}}\n\nOver the course of twelve novels and two collections of short stories, Fleming provided a number of details relating to M's background and character.  In ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' it is revealed that M's pay as head of the Secret Service is \u00a36,500 a year, (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|6500|1963}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} pounds{{inflation-fn|UK|df=yes}}) \u00a31,500 of which comes from retired naval pay.{{sfn|Amis|1966|p=39}} Although his pay is good for the 1950s and 1960s, it is never explained how M received or can afford his membership at [[Blades Club|Blades]], an upscale private club for gentlemen he frequents in London to gamble and dine. Blades has a restricted membership of only 200 gentlemen and all must be able to show \u00a3100,000 (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|100000|1963}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} pounds{{inflation-fn|UK|df=yes}}) in cash or [[gilt-edged securities]].{{sfn|Comentale|Watt|Willman|2005|p=153}} Kingsley Amis noted in his study, ''[[The James Bond Dossier]]'', that on M's salary his membership of the club would have been puzzling.{{sfn|Amis|1966|p=39}} As a personal favour to M, the staff at Blades keeps a supply of cheap red wine [[Algerian wine|from Algeria]] on hand but does not include it on the wine list. M refers to it as \"Infuriator\" and tends only to drink it in moderate quantities unless he is in a very bad mood.{{sfn|Lejeune|1979|p=63}}\n\nThe academic Paul Stock argues that M's office is a metonym for England and a stable point from which Bond departs on a mission, whilst he sees M as being an iconic representative of England and Englishness.{{sfn|Stock|2009|p=251}}\n\nIn the first post-Fleming book, ''[[Colonel Sun]]'', M is kidnapped from Quarterdeck, his home, and Bond goes to great lengths to rescue him.{{sfn|Lane|Simpson|2002|p=65}} The later continuation books, written by [[John Gardner (thriller writer)|John Gardner]], retain Sir Miles Messervy as M, who protects Bond from the new, less aggressive climate in the Secret Service, saying that at some point Britain will need \"a blunt instrument\".{{sfn|Lane|Simpson|2002|p=71}} In Gardner's final novel, [[COLD (novel)|''COLD'']], M is kidnapped and rescued by Bond and finishes the book by retiring from MI6.{{sfn|Simpson|2002|p=61}} Continuation Bond author [[Raymond Benson]]'s 1998 novel ''[[The Facts of Death]]'' continued Messervy's retirement, where he still resides in Quarterdeck.{{sfn|Simpson|2002|p=63}} The book also introduces a new M, Barbara Mawdsley.{{sfn|Lane|Simpson|2002|p=81}}\n\n==Films==\n===Eon Productions films===\n====Bernard Lee: 1962\u20131979====\n[[File:Bernard lee.jpg|thumb|right|Bernard Lee, who played M from 1962 to 1979]]\nM was played by [[Bernard Lee]] from the first Bond film, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', until ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' (1979).{{sfn|Rubin|2003|p=256}}  In ''Dr. No,'' M refers to his record of reducing the number of operative casualties since taking the job, implying someone else held the job recently before him.

Earlier in the film, the department had been referred to as MI6 by a radio operator.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=11}}\n\nA number of Bond scholars have noted that Lee's interpretation of the character was in line with the original literary representation; Cork and Stutz observed that Lee was \"very close to Fleming's version of the character\",{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=154}} while Rubin commented on the serious, efficient, no-nonsense authority figure.{{sfn|Rubin|2003|p=227-228}} Smith and Lavington, meanwhile, remarked that Lee was \"the very incarnation of Fleming's crusty admiral.\"{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=15}}\n\nLee died of cancer in January 1981, four months into the filming of ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' and before any of his scenes could be filmed.<ref name=\"Times (1981)\">{{cite news|title=Obituary: Mr Bernard Lee|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=19 January 1981|page=12}}</ref> Out of respect, no new actor was hired to assume the role and, instead, the script was re-written so that the character is said to be on leave, with his lines given to either his Chief of Staff [[Bill Tanner]] or the Minister of Defence, [[Sir Frederick Gray]].{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=98}} Later films referred to Lee's tenure as head of the service, with a painting of him as M in [[MI6]]'s Scottish headquarters during the 1999 instalment ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]''.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=154}}\n\n;Featured in:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:225px;\"\n| style=\"width:300pt;\"|\n* ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962)\n* ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' (1963)\n* ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964)\n* ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965)\n* ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1967)\n* ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' (1969)\n| style=\"width:300pt;\"|\n* ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1971)\n* ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1973)\n* ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' (1974)\n* ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' (1979)\n|}\n* The likeness of Lee was used in the 2005 James Bond video game adaptation of ''[[From Russia with Love (video game)|James Bond 007: From Russia with Love]]'' for the role of M by [[EA Games]].<ref>{{cite web|title=From Russia With Love Tech Info |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/from-russia-with-love/techinfo/ |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc |accessdate=30 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514082010/http://uk.gamespot.com/from-russia-with-love/techinfo/ |archivedate=14 May 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\n====Robert Brown: 1983\u20131989====\n[[File:Robert brown.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Brown, who played M from 1983 to 1989]]\nAfter Lee's death in 1981, the producers hired actor [[Robert Brown (British actor)|Robert Brown]] to play M in ''[[Octopussy]]''. At the time of that film's release, the general thought was that this was the same M whom Lee had played, but was now being played by Brown, in the same way that Roger Moore and George Lazenby had replaced Sean Connery. Brown, however, had previously played Admiral Hargreaves, [[Flag Officer Submarines]], in the 1977 film, ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' and Bond scholars Steven Jay Rubin, John Cork, and Collin Stutz all consider Admiral Hargreaves would have been appointed to the role of M, rather than Brown playing either the same M as Lee, or even a different character altogether.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=154-155}}{{sfn|Rubin|2003|p=178}}\n\nPfeiffer and Worrall considered that whilst Brown looks perfect, the role had been softened from that of Lee;{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=136}} they also considered him \"far too avuncular\",{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=155}} although in ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' they remarked that he came across as being very effective as he removed Bond's [[Licence to kill (concept)|double-0 licence]].{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=165}} Continuation author Raymond Benson agrees, noting that the M role was \"once again under written, and Brown is not allowed the opportunity to explore and reveal his character traits\";{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=236-137}} Benson also considered the character to be \"too nice\".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=137}}\n\n;Featured in:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:225px;\"\n| style=\"width:300pt;\"|\n* ''[[Octopussy]]'' (1983)\n* ''[[A View to a Kill]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' (1987)\n* ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' (1989)\n|}\n\n====Judi Dench: 1995\u20132015====\n[[File:M by Judi Dench.jpg|thumb|right|Judi Dench, who played M from 1995 to 2015]]\nAfter the long period between ''Licence to Kill'' and ''[[GoldenEye]]'', the producers brought in [[Judi Dench|Dame Judi Dench]] to take over as the new M replacing Robert Brown.

In this new continuity, M has worked for MI6 for some time, at one point muttering, \"Christ, I miss the Cold War\".{{sfn|McKay|2008|p=353}} According to ''[[Skyfall]]'', M was previously in charge of MI6's operations in Hong Kong during the 1990s.

(literary character)|James Bond]] book and [[James Bond filmography|film]] series; the character is the Head of the [[Secret Intelligence Service]]\u2014also known as MI6\u2014and is Bond's superior. Fleming based the character on a number of people he knew who commanded sections of British intelligence. M has appeared in the novels by Fleming and seven continuation authors, as well as appearing in twenty-four films. In the [[Eon Productions]] [[James Bond in film|series of films]], M has been portrayed by four actors: [[Bernard Lee]], [[Robert Brown (British actor)|Robert Brown]], [[Judi Dench]] and [[Ralph Fiennes]], the incumbent; in the two independent productions, M was played by [[John Huston]], [[David Niven]] and [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Vice Admiral Godfrey WWII IWM A 20777.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Rear Admiral [[John Henry Godfrey]], Fleming's superior at the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] and a basis for M.]]\nFleming based much of M's character on [[Rear Admiral]] [[John Henry Godfrey|John Godfrey]], who was Fleming's superior at the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] during the [[Second World War]].

At the time of that film's release, the general thought was that this was the same M whom Lee had played, but was now being played by Brown, in the same way that Roger Moore and George Lazenby had replaced Sean Connery. Brown, however, had previously played Admiral Hargreaves, [[Flag Officer Submarines]], in the 1977 film, ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' and Bond scholars Steven Jay Rubin, John Cork, and Collin Stutz all consider Admiral Hargreaves would have been appointed to the role of M, rather than Brown playing either the same M as Lee, or even a different character altogether.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=154-155}}{{sfn|Rubin|2003|p=178}}\n\nPfeiffer and Worrall considered that whilst Brown looks perfect, the role had been softened from that of Lee;{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=136}} they also considered him \"far too avuncular\",{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=155}} although in ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' they remarked that he came across as being very effective as he removed Bond's [[Licence to kill (concept)|double-0 licence]].{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=165}} Continuation author Raymond Benson agrees, noting that the M role was \"once again under written, and Brown is not allowed the opportunity to explore and reveal his character traits\";{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=236-137}} Benson also considered the character to be \"too nice\".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=137}}\n\n;Featured in:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:225px;\"\n| style=\"width:300pt;\"|\n* ''[[Octopussy]]'' (1983)\n* ''[[A View to a Kill]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' (1987)\n* ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' (1989)\n|}\n\n====Judi Dench: 1995\u20132015====\n[[File:M by Judi Dench.jpg|thumb|right|Judi Dench, who played M from 1995 to 2015]]\nAfter the long period between ''Licence to Kill'' and ''[[GoldenEye]]'', the producers brought in [[Judi Dench|Dame Judi Dench]] to take over as the new M replacing Robert Brown.

Her ability to run MI6 has been questioned on more than once; in ''Casino Royale'', she is the subject of a review when Bond is caught shooting an unarmed prisoner and blowing up a foreign embassy on camera; in ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'', the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] orders her to personally withdraw Bond from the field in [[Bolivia]] and to stop any investigations into Dominic Greene's [[eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]] organisation; and in ''Skyfall'', she is the subject of a [[public inquiry]] when MI6 loses a computer hard drive containing the identities of undercover agents around the world.<ref name=\"SightAndSound-Miller\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/film-week-skyfall|last=Miller|first=Henry K.|title=Film of the week: Skyfall|date=26 October 2012|work=[[Sight & Sound]]|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref> ''Skyfall'' marks Dench's seventh appearance as M, where she is targeted by former MI6 agent [[Raoul Silva]], whom she turned over to the Chinese in order to save six other agents.

His teaching of Aesthetic Realism spanned almost four decades and included thousands of extemporaneous lectures on poetry, the arts and sciences, religion, economics, and national ethics, as well as lessons to individuals and general classes which showed that questions of everyday life are aesthetic and ethical.\n\nHis lecture on the poetry of [[William Carlos Williams]], which Williams attended, is published in ''The Williams-Siegel Documentary'' and his lectures on Henry James's ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'' were edited into a critical consideration titled ''James and the Children''.\nSiegel's philosophy, and his statement, \"The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites\", has influenced artists, scientists, and educators.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Kranz|editor-first=Sheldon|title=Aesthetic Realism: We Have Been There: Six Artists on the Siegel Theory of Opposites|year=1969|publisher=Definition Press|location=New York|isbn=0910492115|display-editors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Perey|first=Arnold|title=The Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel as Teaching Method in Anthropology |journal=Anthropology & Education Quarterly|volume=7| number=4|date=1976|publisher=Wiley|pages=46\u201348| jstor=3216520|doi=10.1525/aeq.1976.7.4.05x1663y}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Green| first=Edward|title=Aesthetic Realism and the Need for a Philosophic Musicology|journal=International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music|volume= 36|number= 2 (Dec. 2005)|publisher=Croatian Musicological Society|pages= 227\u2013248|jstor=30032170}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author1=Monendra Grover|author2=Dwijesh Mishra|author3=Rajesh Kumar| author4=Sudhir Srivastava|title=Computation, Mathematics or Aesthetic Realism: Revisiting the foundations of modern biology and agriculture| journal=International Journal of Current Research and Academic Review|volume=2|number=8|location=New Delhi, India| issn=2347-3215|pages=175\u2013177}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\nBorn in [[Dvinsk]], [[Latvia]], Siegel emigrated to the United States in 1905 with his parents, Mendel and Sarah (Einhorn) Siegel. The family settled in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], where Siegel attended [[Baltimore City College]] and joined the speech and debate team now referred to as the [[Bancroft/Carrollton-Wight Literary Societies]]. He contributed to the senior publication ''The Green Bag'' and graduated in 1919. In 1922, together with V.F. Calverton [George Goetz], he co-founded ''The Modern Quarterly,'' a magazine in which his earliest essays appeared, including \"The Scientific Criticism\" (Vol. I, No. 1, March 1923) and \"The Equality of Man\" (Vol. I, No. 3, December 1923).<ref>{{cite book|last=Siegel|first=Eli|title=''The Modern Quarterly Beginnings of Aesthetic Realism 1922-1923''|year=1997|publisher=Definition Press|location=New York|isbn=0-910492-35-2}}</ref>\n\nIn 1925, his \"Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana\" was selected from four thousand anonymously submitted poems<ref>Editors' Note, ''The Nation'' Vol. 120, No. 3110, page 148 (February 11, 1925): \"there were 4,000 manuscripts submitted to the poetry contest.\"</ref> as the winner of ''The Nation's'' esteemed poetry prize.<ref>Mark Van Doren in ''Prize Poems, 1913-1929'' page 19 (NY: Charles Boni, 1930): \"The ''Nation'' prize ... was always a spectacle to be looked forward to, and the fame which came to certain poems like Stephen Vincent Benet's \"King David\" and Eli Siegel's \"Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana\" was an interesting index of the importance attributed by the lay public to poetry.\"</ref>  The magazine's editors described it as \"the most passionate and interesting poem which came in\u2014a poem recording through magnificent rhythms a profound and important and beautiful vision of the earth on which afternoons and men have always existed.\"<ref>Editors Oswald Garrison Villard, Lewis S.

The author's innovative technique in this long, free-verse poem tended to polarize commentators, with much of the polemic taking the form of parody.<ref>Deborah A. Straub in ''Contemporary Authors:'' \"Siegel immediately became the focus of a literary controversy. His innovative technique and unorthodox approach to his material tended to polarize reviewers' reactions to the poem; as [[Michael Kernan|[Michael] Kernan]] remarked [in the ''Washington Post'', 8/16/78], \"some critics loved it, others were outraged.\"</ref><ref>Alexander Laing in \"The Nation and its Poets,\" page 212. ''The Nation'', Vol. 201, No. 8 (September 20, 1965): \"The vigor of ''The Nation's'' influence was demonstrated in an immediate editorial uproar across the country ... Much of it assumed the form of raucous parody ... This is notable because the award to Siegel helped to dramatize, for a large audience, a transition in the perception of literary values which at this midpoint of the 1920s was already evident, although still arcane. If ''The Nation's'' choice, 'Hot Afternoons,' is thought of as nothing more than a catalyst, the magazine's willingness to stand up for the unorthodox in poetry was symbolically important.\"</ref> \"In Hot Afternoons\", Siegel later explained, \"I tried to take many things that are thought of usually as being far apart and foreign and to show, in a beautiful way, that they aren't so separate and that they do have a great deal to do with one another.\"<ref>Deborah A. Straub, ''Contemporary Authors:'' \"Siegel composed \"Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana\" with this principle in mind, taking \"many things that are thought of usually as being far apart and foreign and [showing], in a beautiful way, that they aren't so separate and that they do have a great deal to do with each other.\"</ref><ref>Corbett & Boldt: Modern American Poetry, page 144.

After moving to New York City, he became a member of the [[Greenwich Village]] poets, famous for his dramatic readings of \"Hot Afternoons\" and other poems. His two-word poem, ''One Question'',  won recognition in 1925 as the shortest poem in the English language.<ref>[http://www.aestheticrealism.net/Balt-Sun-Hiaasen-02.htm ''Baltimore Sun'', April 25, 2002]</ref>  It appeared in the ''Literary Review'' of the ''[[New York Evening Post]]'' :\n\n{{poemquote|''One Question''\nI&nbsp;\u2014\nWhy?}}\n\nFor several years in the 1930s Siegel served as master of ceremonies for regular poetry readings that were well known for combining poetry and jazz.<ref>J. Dosbriora Irwin, \"Village Portraits\", in ''Greenwich Village Weekly News'' May 1933, Number 33, page 3: \"Someone told me, a few days ago, that, to-date, Eli Siegel was the most popular man on what may be termed the left wing of the Village. This is no doubt true, but Eli Siegel, as I know him, is not a politician ... He is too utterly true and too sincere to lobby, handshake or praise.  Eli Siegel has another mission in life than to be popular amongst men.  That mission is to be true to himself, to his soul, to his work. Hence he gains respect, which is ever so much more important than popularity.  I do not mean by this that Eli Siegel shuts himself into an Ivory Tower ... no ... not exactly. He has actually many friends and his friendship is just the human exchange to give and take that real friendship should be.  But because he is a little finer, a little more idealistic, more sincere than most, and because work means to him a little more, one classes him amidst the rather superior beings one is privileged to meet here and there through life, and that one can, perhaps like or love, despise or envy, but always must respect.\n ... Also, he composes the delicate or violent, the sentimental or humorous poems he recites evenings, and prepares the highly documented literary lectures he delivers at the Sam Johnson. For Eli Siegel is a past master at entertaining, at holding the interest of an audience, also at gathering about him men and women of talent and at encouraging them in the field of their particular endeavours. Despite the genius of his profound mind, Eli Siegel is not egoistic, but sensitive to all beauty, appreciative of all artistic expressions.</ref> He was also a regular reviewer for [[Scribners|''Scribner's'']] magazine and the ''[[New York Evening Post]]'' Literary Review. In 1938, Siegel began teaching poetry classes with the view that \"what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life\". In 1941, students in these classes asked him to give individual lessons in which they might learn about their own lives. These were the first Aesthetic Realism lessons.<ref>Deborah A. Straub in Contemporary Authors: \"Siegel continued to be preoccupied with studying and teaching the new philosophy of life and art he had begun to develop in the 1920s and 1930s.

Baird would later become Secretary of the Society for Aesthetic Realism, and also a musicologist and poet in her own right.[https://aestheticrealism.net/poetry/Baird_Biography.htm]\n\nIn 1946, at Steinway Hall in New York City, Siegel began giving weekly lectures in which he presented the philosophy he first called Aesthetic Analysis (later, Aesthetic Realism) \"a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier\".<ref>Donald Kirkley in \"Poet Outlines a Philosophy,\" Baltimore Sun, August 2, 1946: \"More than 160 persons ... attended the introductory talk. Subsequent lectures will be given weekly at Steinway Hall. Tonight's theme was \"Self and World.\" In it, Mr. Siegel affirmed his belief that \"aesthetic analysis can be of help to everybody.\" It is, he said, 'a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier.'\"</ref>\nFrom 1941 to 1978, he gave many thousand lectures on [[poetry]], history, [[economics]]\u2014a wide variety of the [[arts]] and [[sciences]]. And he gave thousands of individual Aesthetic Realism lessons to men, women, and children. In these lessons the way of seeing the world based on aesthetics\u2014which is Aesthetic Realism\u2014was taught.\n\nIn 1951, William Carlos Williams read Siegel's \"Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana\" again, and wrote to Martha Baird: \"Everything we most are compelled to do is in that one poem.\" Siegel, he wrote, \"belongs in the very first rank of our living artists\".<ref>William Carlos Williams, ''Something to Say'', ed J.

He wrote:\n<blockquote>I can't tell you how important Siegel's work is in the light of my present understanding of the modern poem. He belongs in the very first rank of our living artists.</blockquote>\nAnd Williams added:\n<blockquote>The other side of the picture is the extreme resentment that a fixed, sclerotic mind feels confronting this new.

His Translations of Baudelaire and his commentaries on them rank him with the most understanding of the Baudelaire critics in any language.\" (March 23, 1969) [https://web.archive.org/web/20050414121710/http://www.elisiegel.net/poetry/Review-Rexroth-NYT.htm]<br>\n\nIn ''[[Contemporary Authors]]'' Ellen Reiss, Aesthetic Realism Chairman of Education, stated (in a book published by Definition Press, said Foundation's publishing arm):\n<blockquote>Eli Siegel's work, which in time became Aesthetic Realism, was the cause of some of the largest praise, the largest love in persons, and also the largest resentment \u2026<br>\n\nIn writing an entry about [him] for ''Contemporary Authors'', you are somewhat in the position you would be writing an entry on the poet John Keats in 1821. That is, if you were to rely on what was said of Keats by most established critics (critics now remembered principally for their injustice to one of the greatest English writers), you would present the author of `Ode to a Nightingale' as a presumptuous `Cockney poet' whose works were `driveling idiocy.' In writing about Eli Siegel [now], you are writing about a contemporary who is great; who all his life met what William Carlos Williams described him as meeting, `the extreme resentment that a fixed, sclerotic mind feels confronting this new'; who now, after his death, is beginning, just barely beginning, to be seen with something like fairness.</blockquote>\nHuntington Cairns, Secretary of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C., described Siegel's place in the understanding of aesthetics\u2014the branch of philosophy which studies beauty\u2014as follows:\n<blockquote>I believe that Eli Siegel was a genius. He did for aesthetics what [[Ethics_(Spinoza)|Spinoza]] did for ethics. [http://www.aestheticrealism.org/Press-Articles-on-Aesthetic-Realism/Balt-Evening-Sun-Bready.htm]</blockquote>\nDonald Kirkley wrote in the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' (1944) reporting on Siegel's reaction to his 1925 national fame,\n<blockquote>Baltimore friends close to him at the time will testify to a certain integrity and steadfastness of purpose which distinguished Mr. Siegel ... He refused to exploit a flood of publicity which was enough to float any man to financial comfort ...[https://web.archive.org/web/20041215210935/http://www.elisiegelcollection.net/Lectures-in-TRO/Tro1335.htm]</blockquote>\nAnd William Carlos Williams also wrote,\n<blockquote>Only today do I realize how important that poem [''Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana''] is in the history of our development as a cultural entity. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050414090805/http://www.elisiegel.net/poetry/WilliamsLetter1951.htm]</blockquote>\n\nIn 2002 the city of Baltimore placed a plaque in Druid Hill Park to commemorate the centennial of Eli Siegel's birth.

This is no doubt true, but Eli Siegel, as I know him, is not a politician ... He is too utterly true and too sincere to lobby, handshake or praise.  Eli Siegel has another mission in life than to be popular amongst men.  That mission is to be true to himself, to his soul, to his work. Hence he gains respect, which is ever so much more important than popularity.  I do not mean by this that Eli Siegel shuts himself into an Ivory Tower ... no ... not exactly. He has actually many friends and his friendship is just the human exchange to give and take that real friendship should be.  But because he is a little finer, a little more idealistic, more sincere than most, and because work means to him a little more, one classes him amidst the rather superior beings one is privileged to meet here and there through life, and that one can, perhaps like or love, despise or envy, but always must respect.\n ... Also, he composes the delicate or violent, the sentimental or humorous poems he recites evenings, and prepares the highly documented literary lectures he delivers at the Sam Johnson. For Eli Siegel is a past master at entertaining, at holding the interest of an audience, also at gathering about him men and women of talent and at encouraging them in the field of their particular endeavours. Despite the genius of his profound mind, Eli Siegel is not egoistic, but sensitive to all beauty, appreciative of all artistic expressions.</ref> He was also a regular reviewer for [[Scribners|''Scribner's'']] magazine and the ''[[New York Evening Post]]'' Literary Review. In 1938, Siegel began teaching poetry classes with the view that \"what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life\". In 1941, students in these classes asked him to give individual lessons in which they might learn about their own lives. These were the first Aesthetic Realism lessons.<ref>Deborah A. Straub in Contemporary Authors: \"Siegel continued to be preoccupied with studying and teaching the new philosophy of life and art he had begun to develop in the 1920s and 1930s.

Baird would later become Secretary of the Society for Aesthetic Realism, and also a musicologist and poet in her own right.[https://aestheticrealism.net/poetry/Baird_Biography.htm]\n\nIn 1946, at Steinway Hall in New York City, Siegel began giving weekly lectures in which he presented the philosophy he first called Aesthetic Analysis (later, Aesthetic Realism) \"a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier\".<ref>Donald Kirkley in \"Poet Outlines a Philosophy,\" Baltimore Sun, August 2, 1946: \"More than 160 persons ... attended the introductory talk. Subsequent lectures will be given weekly at Steinway Hall. Tonight's theme was \"Self and World.\" In it, Mr. Siegel affirmed his belief that \"aesthetic analysis can be of help to everybody.\" It is, he said, 'a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier.'\"</ref>\nFrom 1941 to 1978, he gave many thousand lectures on [[poetry]], history, [[economics]]\u2014a wide variety of the [[arts]] and [[sciences]]. And he gave thousands of individual Aesthetic Realism lessons to men, women, and children. In these lessons the way of seeing the world based on aesthetics\u2014which is Aesthetic Realism\u2014was taught.\n\nIn 1951, William Carlos Williams read Siegel's \"Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana\" again, and wrote to Martha Baird: \"Everything we most are compelled to do is in that one poem.\" Siegel, he wrote, \"belongs in the very first rank of our living artists\".<ref>William Carlos Williams, ''Something to Say'', ed J.

He called it \"the operation so disastrous to me\".  As a result, he lost the use of his feet and was unable to sleep. According to Ellen Reiss, Aesthetic Realism Chairman of Education, the operation was \"the cause of his dying 5-1/2 months later\".<ref>Ellen Reiss, \"Always:Love of Reality,\" ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known,'' #1626 (3 November 2004) URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.net/tro/tro1626.html.</ref>\n\n==Aesthetic Realism==\n\nThe basis of Aesthetic Realism is the principle, \"The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites.\"[http://www.aestheticrealism.org/es-expl.htm] In the book ''Aesthetic Realism: We Have Been There'', six working artists explain this principle in life and their own craft. Reviewing them, the ''[[Library Journal]]'' tells us: \"[[Heraclitus]], [[Aristotle]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Hegel]], and even [[Martin Buber]] have posited [[contraries]] and [[wikt:polarity|polarities]] in their philosophies. Siegel, however, seems to be the first to demonstrate that 'all beauty is the making one of the permanent opposites in reality'.\" (September 1, 1969) [http://www.definitionpress.org/WHBT-Review-LJ.htm]\n\nThe ethics Siegel taught\u2014\"the art of enjoying justice\"\u2014includes this definition of ''good will'': \"The desire to have something else stronger and more beautiful, for this desire makes oneself stronger and more beautiful.\" Good will is necessary, he stated, for a person to like him\u2013 or herself: \"This desire is the fundamental thing in human consciousness.\" (''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known'', issue no. 121)\n\nThe Aesthetic Realism Foundation continues to teach the philosophy that Siegel founded.

He wrote:\n<blockquote>I can't tell you how important Siegel's work is in the light of my present understanding of the modern poem. He belongs in the very first rank of our living artists.</blockquote>\nAnd Williams added:\n<blockquote>The other side of the picture is the extreme resentment that a fixed, sclerotic mind feels confronting this new. It shows itself by the violent opposition Siegel received from the \"authorities\" whom I shall not dignify by naming and after that by neglect. ...<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20050414090805/http://www.elisiegel.net/poetry/WilliamsLetter1951.htm \"Something to Say\", ed. by J.E.B.

His Translations of Baudelaire and his commentaries on them rank him with the most understanding of the Baudelaire critics in any language.\" (March 23, 1969) [https://web.archive.org/web/20050414121710/http://www.elisiegel.net/poetry/Review-Rexroth-NYT.htm]<br>\n\nIn ''[[Contemporary Authors]]'' Ellen Reiss, Aesthetic Realism Chairman of Education, stated (in a book published by Definition Press, said Foundation's publishing arm):\n<blockquote>Eli Siegel's work, which in time became Aesthetic Realism, was the cause of some of the largest praise, the largest love in persons, and also the largest resentment \u2026<br>\n\nIn writing an entry about [him] for ''Contemporary Authors'', you are somewhat in the position you would be writing an entry on the poet John Keats in 1821. That is, if you were to rely on what was said of Keats by most established critics (critics now remembered principally for their injustice to one of the greatest English writers), you would present the author of `Ode to a Nightingale' as a presumptuous `Cockney poet' whose works were `driveling idiocy.' In writing about Eli Siegel [now], you are writing about a contemporary who is great; who all his life met what William Carlos Williams described him as meeting, `the extreme resentment that a fixed, sclerotic mind feels confronting this new'; who now, after his death, is beginning, just barely beginning, to be seen with something like fairness.</blockquote>\nHuntington Cairns, Secretary of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C., described Siegel's place in the understanding of aesthetics\u2014the branch of philosophy which studies beauty\u2014as follows:\n<blockquote>I believe that Eli Siegel was a genius. He did for aesthetics what [[Ethics_(Spinoza)|Spinoza]] did for ethics. [http://www.aestheticrealism.org/Press-Articles-on-Aesthetic-Realism/Balt-Evening-Sun-Bready.htm]</blockquote>\nDonald Kirkley wrote in the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' (1944) reporting on Siegel's reaction to his 1925 national fame,\n<blockquote>Baltimore friends close to him at the time will testify to a certain integrity and steadfastness of purpose which distinguished Mr. Siegel ... He refused to exploit a flood of publicity which was enough to float any man to financial comfort ...[https://web.archive.org/web/20041215210935/http://www.elisiegelcollection.net/Lectures-in-TRO/Tro1335.htm]</blockquote>\nAnd William Carlos Williams also wrote,\n<blockquote>Only today do I realize how important that poem [''Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana''] is in the history of our development as a cultural entity. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050414090805/http://www.elisiegel.net/poetry/WilliamsLetter1951.htm]</blockquote>\n\nIn 2002 the city of Baltimore placed a plaque in Druid Hill Park to commemorate the centennial of Eli Siegel's birth.

Q (standing for [[Quartermaster]]), like [[M (James Bond)|M]], is a job title rather than a name. He is the head of Q Branch (or later Q Division), the fictional [[research and development]] division of the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Service]]. The use of letters as [[pseudonyms]] for senior officers in the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] was started by its first director Captain Sir [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming|Mansfield George Smith-Cumming]] (1859\u20131923) who signed himself with a C written in green ink.<ref>Judd, Alan, ''The Quest for C: Mansfield Cumming and the founding of the British Secret Service''</ref>\n\nQ has appeared in 21 of the 24 [[Eon Productions]]'s James Bond films, the exceptions being ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'', [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|the 2006 ''Casino Royale'']] and ''[[Quantum of Solace]]''. The character was also featured in both non-Eon Bond films, [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|''Casino Royale'']] (1967) and ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (1983).\n\n==Novels==\nThe character Q never appears in the novels by the author [[Ian Fleming]], where only Q and the Q Branch are mentioned;<ref name=\"Griswold (2006)\">{{Cite book|last=Griswold|first=John|title= Ian Fleming's James Bond: Annotations And Chronologies for Ian Fleming's Bond Stories |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uariyzldrJwC&lpg=PA2&dq=Ian%20Fleming's%20James%20Bond%3A%20Annotations%20And%20Chronologies%20For%20Ian%20Fleming's%20Bond%20Stories&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=[[AuthorHouse]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4259-3100-1|pages=25\u201326}}</ref> although Q does appear in the novelisations by [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]], and the later novels by [[John Gardner (British writer)|John Gardner]] and [[Raymond Benson]] who adopted Eon's decision to combine the character with Major Boothroyd, the armourer from ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr. No]]''.\n\nIn John Gardner's novels, the post of Q is taken over by Ann Reilly (called Q'ute by her colleagues). She also forms a relationship with Bond. It is supposed that she held the post for a short while only, because Raymond Benson's novels return Boothroyd to the post without explanation.\n\n[[Charles Fraser-Smith]] is widely credited as the inspiration for Q<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13918865.300-review-careful-carruthers-that-paper-clip-is-loaded-.html |title=Careful Carruthers That Paper Clip Is Loaded |magazine=[[New Scientist]]|date=14 August 1993 |accessdate=2 May 2012}}</ref> due to the spy gadgets he built for the [[Special Operations Executive]].  These were called Q-devices, after the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[World War I]] [[Q-ship]]s. In the Fleming novels there are frequent references to Q and Q Branch with phrases like \"see Q for any equipment you need\" (''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'') and \"Q Branch would handle all of that\" (''[[Diamonds Are Forever (novel)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''), with a reference to \"Q's craftsmen\" in ''[[From Russia, with Love (novel)|From Russia, with Love]]''.\n\n===Major Boothroyd===\nIn the sixth novel, ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr. No]]'', the service [[armourer]] Major Boothroyd appears for the first time. Fleming named the character after [[Geoffrey Boothroyd]], a firearms expert who lived in [[Glasgow]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Macintyre|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben Macintyre|title=Was Ian Fleming the real 007?|newspaper=The Times|date=5 April 2008|url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3652410.ece|accessdate=8 April 2008}}</ref> who had written to the novelist suggesting that Bond was not using the best firearms available.\n\n===Ann Reilly===\nBoothroyd is also referenced occasionally in the Bond novels of [[John Gardner (thriller writer)|John Gardner]], but the author preferred instead to focus on a new character, Ann Reilly, who is introduced in the first Gardner novel, ''[[Licence Renewed]]'' and promptly dubbed \"Q'ute\" by Bond.\n\n==Films==\nMajor Boothroyd appears in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' and in the script of ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]''. [[Desmond Llewelyn]] stated that, although he was credited as playing \"Major Boothroyd\" in the latter film, his name as said by [[M (James Bond)|M]] was replaced with \"the equipment officer\", as director [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]] stated that Boothroyd was a different character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.follyfoot-tv.co.uk/jott/des_inter/des_interveiw.htm |title=Desmond Llewelyn |publisher=Follyfoot-tv.co.uk |date=19 December 1999 |accessdate=2 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217053521/http://www.follyfoot-tv.co.uk/jott/des_inter/des_interveiw.htm |archivedate=February 17, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nBeginning in [[Guy Hamilton]]'s ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' and in each film thereafter Major Boothroyd is most often referred to as Q; however, in ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' (1977) he is referred to once again as Major Boothroyd in dialogue.{{sfn|Chapman|2000|p=293}}\n\nIn most films in which Q appears, he is restricted to a \"behind the scenes\" involvement, either based in London or in secret bases out in the field. Two notable exceptions in which Q becomes directly involved in Bond's missions occur in ''[[Octopussy]]'', in which Q actually participates in field work\u2014including the final battle against the villain's henchmen\u2014and ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' in which he joins Bond in the field after 007 goes rogue.\n\n===Eon Productions===\n\n====Peter Burton: 1962 (as \"Major Boothroyd\")====\nIn the first film, ''Dr. No'', Boothroyd is played by [[Peter Burton]] in only one scene, in which he replaces Bond's .25 ACP Beretta 418 pistol with the signature .32 [[Walther PPK]] handgun. He is referred to by M as \"the armourer,\" and later as Major Boothroyd. Scheduling conflicts prevented Burton from reprising the role in ''From Russia with Love'', although he made two later uncredited appearances in Bond films, first as an RAF officer in ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965) and later as a secret agent in the satirical ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aveleyman.com/ActorCredit.aspx?ActorID=2414|title=Peter Burton|website=www.aveleyman.com}}</ref>\n\n====Desmond Llewelyn: 1963\u20131999====\nBeginning with ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'', Desmond Llewelyn portrayed the character in every official film except ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' until his death in 1999. In the 1977 film ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', as Q delivered the underwater Lotus, Major Anya Amasova/Agent XXX ([[Barbara Bach]]) greets Q as \"Major Boothroyd\".\n\nStarting with ''Goldfinger'', the notion that Bond and Q would have an often strained relationship with each other was introduced by Guy Hamilton; it continued in the series thereafter.   While briefing Bond on the gadgets that he is going to use on his mission, Q often expresses irritation and impatience at Bond's short attention span, often telling him to \"pay attention, 007\", and Bond's playful lack of respect for his equipment, telling the agent, \"I ''never'' joke about my work, 007\". In ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', Bond can be heard muttering \"Oh no\" when Q joins him in the [[Bahamas]].  A [[running gag]] appeared in later films where  Q's prized gadget  would be destroyed in a mishap often caused by necessity or Bond's recklessness \u2013 examples include the Glastron jet boat in ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' (Bond sends it over the [[Iguazu Falls]] to escape pursuit by Jaws), the Aston Martin Vantage in ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' (Bond is forced to prime its self-destruct device in order to evade the Czech police forces), and the [[BMW Z8]] in ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' \u2013 which is cut in half by a helicopter buzz-saw.\n\nHowever, on occasion, Q has shown a warm and fatherly concern for 007's welfare, such as at Bond's wedding in ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', when he assures Bond that he is available if Bond ever requires his help. Q has also assisted Bond in a more active role in his missions in ''[[Octopussy (film)|Octopussy]]'', remaining to aid Bond in person even after another ally is killed, and ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' saw him travel to assist Bond while he is officially on leave from MI6 even after Bond has resigned from MI6 to pursue his own vendetta. He frequently refers to Bond as \"007\", rather than by his name. In ''[[GoldenEye]]'', Q shares a joke with Bond for the first time, and in ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' when he reveals his plan to retire, Bond is saddened at the prospect.

(The ''Die Another Day'' DVD reveals that Bond initially saw R as an 'interloper', only awarding the proper title of 'Q' after R has proven himself.)\n\nAccording to an interview on the ''Die Another Day'' DVD, [[Pierce Brosnan]] was very glad to rename Cleese's character 'Q', rather than 'R', because his native Irish accent made it difficult to pronounce 'R' with a convincing English accent.\n\nIn the 007 video game, ''[[James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing]]'', Cleese's Q has an assistant, Miss Nagai, portrayed by [[Misaki Ito]].\n\n'''Featured in'''\n\nFilms:\n*''[[The World Is Not Enough]]''  (1999) (as R)\n*''[[Die Another Day]]''  (2002) (as Q)\n\nVideo games;\n*''[[007: The World Is Not Enough (Nintendo 64)|007: The World Is Not Enough]]'' (2000) (as R)\n*''[[007 Racing]]'' (2000) (as R)\n*''[[Agent Under Fire]]'' (2001) (as R)\n*''[[James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing|Everything or Nothing]]'' (2004)\n*''007 [[Scene It]]'' (board game)\n\n====Ben Whishaw: 2012\u2013present====\n[[File:Ben Whishaw as Q.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ben Whishaw]], the incumbent actor in the role|alt=]]\nThe character of Q did not appear in 2006's ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' or its sequel, ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' (2008).

Q is demonstrated to be highly knowledgeable on the subject of computer security to the point where he designed some of the most sophisticated security protocols in existence. However, he is also somewhat short-sighted; while engrossed in the puzzle of a security system set up by [[Raoul Silva]], the film's main antagonist, he is unaware that he is inadvertently facilitating Silva's escape from MI6 custody until Silva actually escapes.  As with Desmond Llewelyn's Q, he also gets frustrated with Bond's knack for damaging or destroying the gadgets \u2013 at the end of ''Skyfall'' the [[Aston Martin DB5]] is burned out in the final showdown with Silva.\n\nIn ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', Q assists Bond on his mission, similar to Q's assistance to Bond in 1989's ''[[Licence to Kill]]''. Q meets Bond in Austria where he outruns [[SPECTRE]] agents after a ring he eventually decodes, revealing the organisation's existence. Q returns to London to assist [[Miss Moneypenny]] and M in foiling corrupt MI6 bureaucrat Max Denbeigh's launch of the Nine Eyes intelligence network. At the end he provides Bond with his remodelled Aston Martin DB5.

In sharp contrast to the personality of Q in EON film series, Algy hopes to hear about \"Lots of sex and violence\" from James Bond following his mission.

Q (standing for [[Quartermaster]]), like [[M (James Bond)|M]], is a job title rather than a name. He is the head of Q Branch (or later Q Division), the fictional [[research and development]] division of the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Service]]. The use of letters as [[pseudonyms]] for senior officers in the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] was started by its first director Captain Sir [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming|Mansfield George Smith-Cumming]] (1859\u20131923) who signed himself with a C written in green ink.<ref>Judd, Alan, ''The Quest for C: Mansfield Cumming and the founding of the British Secret Service''</ref>\n\nQ has appeared in 21 of the 24 [[Eon Productions]]'s James Bond films, the exceptions being ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'', [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|the 2006 ''Casino Royale'']] and ''[[Quantum of Solace]]''. The character was also featured in both non-Eon Bond films, [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|''Casino Royale'']] (1967) and ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (1983).\n\n==Novels==\nThe character Q never appears in the novels by the author [[Ian Fleming]], where only Q and the Q Branch are mentioned;<ref name=\"Griswold (2006)\">{{Cite book|last=Griswold|first=John|title= Ian Fleming's James Bond: Annotations And Chronologies for Ian Fleming's Bond Stories |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uariyzldrJwC&lpg=PA2&dq=Ian%20Fleming's%20James%20Bond%3A%20Annotations%20And%20Chronologies%20For%20Ian%20Fleming's%20Bond%20Stories&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=[[AuthorHouse]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4259-3100-1|pages=25\u201326}}</ref> although Q does appear in the novelisations by [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]], and the later novels by [[John Gardner (British writer)|John Gardner]] and [[Raymond Benson]] who adopted Eon's decision to combine the character with Major Boothroyd, the armourer from ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr. No]]''.\n\nIn John Gardner's novels, the post of Q is taken over by Ann Reilly (called Q'ute by her colleagues). She also forms a relationship with Bond. It is supposed that she held the post for a short while only, because Raymond Benson's novels return Boothroyd to the post without explanation.\n\n[[Charles Fraser-Smith]] is widely credited as the inspiration for Q<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13918865.300-review-careful-carruthers-that-paper-clip-is-loaded-.html |title=Careful Carruthers That Paper Clip Is Loaded |magazine=[[New Scientist]]|date=14 August 1993 |accessdate=2 May 2012}}</ref> due to the spy gadgets he built for the [[Special Operations Executive]].  These were called Q-devices, after the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[World War I]] [[Q-ship]]s. In the Fleming novels there are frequent references to Q and Q Branch with phrases like \"see Q for any equipment you need\" (''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'') and \"Q Branch would handle all of that\" (''[[Diamonds Are Forever (novel)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''), with a reference to \"Q's craftsmen\" in ''[[From Russia, with Love (novel)|From Russia, with Love]]''.\n\n===Major Boothroyd===\nIn the sixth novel, ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr. No]]'', the service [[armourer]] Major Boothroyd appears for the first time. Fleming named the character after [[Geoffrey Boothroyd]], a firearms expert who lived in [[Glasgow]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Macintyre|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben Macintyre|title=Was Ian Fleming the real 007?|newspaper=The Times|date=5 April 2008|url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3652410.ece|accessdate=8 April 2008}}</ref> who had written to the novelist suggesting that Bond was not using the best firearms available.\n\n===Ann Reilly===\nBoothroyd is also referenced occasionally in the Bond novels of [[John Gardner (thriller writer)|John Gardner]], but the author preferred instead to focus on a new character, Ann Reilly, who is introduced in the first Gardner novel, ''[[Licence Renewed]]'' and promptly dubbed \"Q'ute\" by Bond.\n\n==Films==\nMajor Boothroyd appears in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' and in the script of ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]''. [[Desmond Llewelyn]] stated that, although he was credited as playing \"Major Boothroyd\" in the latter film, his name as said by [[M (James Bond)|M]] was replaced with \"the equipment officer\", as director [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]] stated that Boothroyd was a different character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.follyfoot-tv.co.uk/jott/des_inter/des_interveiw.htm |title=Desmond Llewelyn |publisher=Follyfoot-tv.co.uk |date=19 December 1999 |accessdate=2 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217053521/http://www.follyfoot-tv.co.uk/jott/des_inter/des_interveiw.htm |archivedate=February 17, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nBeginning in [[Guy Hamilton]]'s ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' and in each film thereafter Major Boothroyd is most often referred to as Q; however, in ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' (1977) he is referred to once again as Major Boothroyd in dialogue.{{sfn|Chapman|2000|p=293}}\n\nIn most films in which Q appears, he is restricted to a \"behind the scenes\" involvement, either based in London or in secret bases out in the field. Two notable exceptions in which Q becomes directly involved in Bond's missions occur in ''[[Octopussy]]'', in which Q actually participates in field work\u2014including the final battle against the villain's henchmen\u2014and ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' in which he joins Bond in the field after 007 goes rogue.\n\n===Eon Productions===\n\n====Peter Burton: 1962 (as \"Major Boothroyd\")====\nIn the first film, ''Dr. No'', Boothroyd is played by [[Peter Burton]] in only one scene, in which he replaces Bond's .25 ACP Beretta 418 pistol with the signature .32 [[Walther PPK]] handgun. He is referred to by M as \"the armourer,\" and later as Major Boothroyd. Scheduling conflicts prevented Burton from reprising the role in ''From Russia with Love'', although he made two later uncredited appearances in Bond films, first as an RAF officer in ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965) and later as a secret agent in the satirical ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aveleyman.com/ActorCredit.aspx?ActorID=2414|title=Peter Burton|website=www.aveleyman.com}}</ref>\n\n====Desmond Llewelyn: 1963\u20131999====\nBeginning with ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'', Desmond Llewelyn portrayed the character in every official film except ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' until his death in 1999. In the 1977 film ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', as Q delivered the underwater Lotus, Major Anya Amasova/Agent XXX ([[Barbara Bach]]) greets Q as \"Major Boothroyd\".\n\nStarting with ''Goldfinger'', the notion that Bond and Q would have an often strained relationship with each other was introduced by Guy Hamilton; it continued in the series thereafter.   While briefing Bond on the gadgets that he is going to use on his mission, Q often expresses irritation and impatience at Bond's short attention span, often telling him to \"pay attention, 007\", and Bond's playful lack of respect for his equipment, telling the agent, \"I ''never'' joke about my work, 007\". In ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', Bond can be heard muttering \"Oh no\" when Q joins him in the [[Bahamas]].  A [[running gag]] appeared in later films where  Q's prized gadget  would be destroyed in a mishap often caused by necessity or Bond's recklessness \u2013 examples include the Glastron jet boat in ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' (Bond sends it over the [[Iguazu Falls]] to escape pursuit by Jaws), the Aston Martin Vantage in ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' (Bond is forced to prime its self-destruct device in order to evade the Czech police forces), and the [[BMW Z8]] in ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' \u2013 which is cut in half by a helicopter buzz-saw.\n\nHowever, on occasion, Q has shown a warm and fatherly concern for 007's welfare, such as at Bond's wedding in ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', when he assures Bond that he is available if Bond ever requires his help. Q has also assisted Bond in a more active role in his missions in ''[[Octopussy (film)|Octopussy]]'', remaining to aid Bond in person even after another ally is killed, and ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' saw him travel to assist Bond while he is officially on leave from MI6 even after Bond has resigned from MI6 to pursue his own vendetta. He frequently refers to Bond as \"007\", rather than by his name. In ''[[GoldenEye]]'', Q shares a joke with Bond for the first time, and in ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' when he reveals his plan to retire, Bond is saddened at the prospect. Q signs off with \"Now pay attention, 007,\" and then offers some words of advice:\n<blockquote>Q: \"I've always tried to teach you two things: First, never let them see you bleed.\"\n<br />Bond: \"And the second?\"<br />Q: \"Always have an escape plan.\"&nbsp;\u2013 before he is lowered out of view.</blockquote>\nThis was the final film appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as Q in the James Bond series, although he would revive the role once again as Q in a [[Heineken]] commercial, a TV cross-promotion for ''The World Is Not Enough''. Llewelyn died in a car crash just weeks after the film's release. Between films he also starred as Q in various commercials for a diversity of products and companies. These included Bond collectable merchandise, [[ITV (TV network)|TV3]], [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]] motorcars, [[LG]] video recorders, [[Highland Superstores]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] credit cards, and [[Reach toothbrush|Reach]] electric toothbrushes, the latter of which featured Q briefing himself in the mirror.\n\n'''Featured in'''\n\nFilms:\n*''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]''  (1963)\n*''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''  (1964)\n*''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''  (1965)\n*''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]''  (1967)\n*''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''  (1969)\n*''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''  (1971)\n*''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]''  (1974)\n*''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]''  (1977)\n*''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]''  (1979)\n*''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]''  (1981)\n*''[[Octopussy]]''  (1983)\n*''[[A View to a Kill]]''  (1985)\n*''[[The Living Daylights]]''  (1987)\n*''[[Licence to Kill]]''  (1989)\n*''[[GoldenEye]]''  (1995)\n*''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]''  (1997)\n*''[[The World Is Not Enough]]''  (1999)\n\nVideo games:\n*''[[Tomorrow Never Dies (video game)|Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' (1999) (Likeness only, voiced by [[Miles Anderson]])\n*''[[007: The World Is Not Enough (Nintendo 64)|007: The World Is Not Enough]]'' (2000) (Likeness only, [[Nintendo 64]] version only, voiced by [[Miles Anderson]])\n*''[[007 Racing]]'' (2000) (Archival footage, voiced by [[Miles Anderson]])\n*''[[James Bond 007: Nightfire]]'' (2002) (Likeness only, voiced by [[Gregg Berger]])\n*''[[James Bond 007: From Russia with Love]]'' (2005) (Likeness only, voiced by [[Phil Proctor]])\n\nLlewelyn also portrays Q in the Eon Productions-produced 1967 TV special ''[[Welcome to Japan, Mr. Bond]]'', as well as portraying Q in the documentary ''Highly Classified: The World of 007'', which is included on the ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' Ultimate Edition DVD.

His real name was never revealed, but he was initially credited as \"R\" in ''The World Is Not Enough'', stemming from a joke in which Bond asks the elder Q: \"If you're Q, does that make him R?\"\n\nBetween films, Cleese was still referred to as \"R\" in the [[video games]] ''[[007: The World Is Not Enough (Nintendo 64)|007: The World is Not Enough]]'' (2000), ''[[007 Racing]]'' (2000) and ''[[Agent Under Fire]]'' (2001). He was officially referred to as \"Q\" in ''Die Another Day'' (2002) following Llewelyn's death in 1999.

As with Desmond Llewelyn's Q, he also gets frustrated with Bond's knack for damaging or destroying the gadgets \u2013 at the end of ''Skyfall'' the [[Aston Martin DB5]] is burned out in the final showdown with Silva.\n\nIn ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', Q assists Bond on his mission, similar to Q's assistance to Bond in 1989's ''[[Licence to Kill]]''. Q meets Bond in Austria where he outruns [[SPECTRE]] agents after a ring he eventually decodes, revealing the organisation's existence. Q returns to London to assist [[Miss Moneypenny]] and M in foiling corrupt MI6 bureaucrat Max Denbeigh's launch of the Nine Eyes intelligence network. At the end he provides Bond with his remodelled Aston Martin DB5. He is the first Q who is younger than James Bond.\n\n'''Featured in'''\nFilms:\n*''[[Skyfall]]'' (2012)\n*''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015)\n*''[[No Time to Die]]'' (2020)\n\n===Non-Eon films===\n\n====Geoffrey Bayldon: 1967====\nIn the 1967 version of ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'', Q is portrayed by [[Geoffrey Bayldon]], but instead of outfitting James Bond, he provides gadgets for [[Evelyn Tremble]] (who is portrayed by [[Peter Sellers]]). In the film, Q is assisted by Fordyce ([[John Wells (satirist)|John Wells]]). The sequence parodies the regular series' outfitting, and features Q presenting Tremble with an elaborate [[bullet-proof vest]], laden with preposterous features (\"a [[Beretta]] in the buttonhole, and a cute little mini-gun in the gusset\").\n\n'''Featured in'''\n*''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (1967)\n\n====Alec McCowen: 1983====\nIn the 1983 film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', Bond received his gadgets from a man (played by [[Alec McCowen]]) he referred as Algernon and Algy. His opening line is \"Nice to know old Q can still surprise you 00s,\" indicating that Q is an [[unseen character]]. In sharp contrast to the personality of Q in EON film series, Algy hopes to hear about \"Lots of sex and violence\" from James Bond following his mission. In the closing credits, he is named as \"Q Algy\". Q Branch itself is depicted as underfunded and ramshackle compared to the high-tech surroundings of the Eon films.\n\n'''Featured in'''\n*''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (1983)\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of James Bond allies]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{James Bond characters|state=autocollapse}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Q}}\n[[Category:James Bond characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional quartermasters]]\n[[Category:Fictional engineers]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\n[[Category:Fictional SIS agents]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1958]]\n[[Category:Characters in British novels of the 20th century]]\n\n[[de:Figuren aus James-Bond-Filmen#Q]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toFrom Russia with Love(link skipped; link changed toFrom Russia with Love (video game)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)"}

The Board of Supervisors form of government was terminated as a result of a class action lawsuit brought by Troy attorney Marvin I. Honig on behalf of his wife, Nedda, during March 1968.  Mr. Honig brought this lawsuit to declare that the Board of Supervisors, as constituted, violated the \"one man, one vote\" principal declared by the United States Supreme Court.  Mr. Honig's motive in bringing the lawsuit was to punish the Rensselaer County Republican Party chairman and certain members of the Board of Supervisors for defaulting on an agreement with him. The NY Supreme Court ruled in Honig's favor, and ordered the creation of a legislative body.  Several plans were offered, but a plan proposed by Honig was adopted by the Court, and its decision was affirmed by the Appellate Division and Court of Appeals.  The first \"Honig Plan\" was drawn to favor of the Democratic party, which had not had control of the county government in decades.  That plan, which controlled the 1969 election, resulted in the Democrat's winning control of the new Rensselaer County Legislature.  Thereafter, following a change of leadership in the Republican party, Honig brought a new plan, drawn to favor Republican candidates, to the court, which adopted his revised plan.  The second \"Honig Plan\" was affirmed by the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeals.  The Republican candidates won back the County Legislature in the 1971 election, and Honig became the Renssselaer County Attorney, a position he held for well over a decade.  A full explanation of the creation of the Rensselaer County Legislature can be found at http://nassau-stories.blogspot.com/2006/04/reapportionment.html. See also: The Troy Record, July 8, 1971, page 1.\n\nIn 1970, the Rensselaer County Legislature was created, which elected Edward J. \"Ned\" Quinn as Chairman. The Chairman served as the equivalent to an executive until the office of [[County Executive]] was created in 1972. Since its creation, Democrats have never won the office, although they controlled the Legislature until 1994. One notable candidate for Executive was [[Edward Pattison]] who was later elected to Congress, and whose son Mark served two terms as Mayor of [[Troy, New York|Troy]]. The current county executive-elect is Steve McLaughlin (R).  Legislative authority is vested in the County Legislature, which consists of 20 members representing 17 different communities, separated into six districts. The current composition of the Legislature is as follows (11 Republicans, 5 Democrats and 4 Conservatives that caucus with the Republicans):\n\nDistrict 1 \u2013 [[Troy, New York|Troy]]:\n* {{Party shading/Coalition/block}} Cindy Doran (C)\n* {{Party shading/Democratic/block}} Mark Fleming (D)\n* {{Party shading/Democratic/block}} Peter Grimm (D), '''Minority Leader'''\n* {{Party shading/Democratic/block}} Edward Manny (D)\n* {{Party shading/Democratic/block}} Gary Pavlic (D)\n* {{Party shading/Democratic/block}} Leonard Welcome (D)\n\nDistrict 2 \u2013 [[North Greenbush]], [[East Greenbush (town), New York|East Greenbush]], and [[Poestenkill (town), New York|Poestenkill]]:\n* {{Party shading/Republican/block}} Robert W.

The Board of Supervisors form of government was terminated as a result of a class action lawsuit brought by Troy attorney Marvin I. Honig on behalf of his wife, Nedda, during March 1968.  Mr. Honig brought this lawsuit to declare that the Board of Supervisors, as constituted, violated the \"one man, one vote\" principal declared by the United States Supreme Court.  Mr. Honig's motive in bringing the lawsuit was to punish the Rensselaer County Republican Party chairman and certain members of the Board of Supervisors for defaulting on an agreement with him. The NY Supreme Court ruled in Honig's favor, and ordered the creation of a legislative body.  Several plans were offered, but a plan proposed by Honig was adopted by the Court, and its decision was affirmed by the Appellate Division and Court of Appeals.  The first \"Honig Plan\" was drawn to favor of the Democratic party, which had not had control of the county government in decades.  That plan, which controlled the 1969 election, resulted in the Democrat's winning control of the new Rensselaer County Legislature.  Thereafter, following a change of leadership in the Republican party, Honig brought a new plan, drawn to favor Republican candidates, to the court, which adopted his revised plan.  The second \"Honig Plan\" was affirmed by the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeals.  The Republican candidates won back the County Legislature in the 1971 election, and Honig became the Renssselaer County Attorney, a position he held for well over a decade.  A full explanation of the creation of the Rensselaer County Legislature can be found at http://nassau-stories.blogspot.com/2006/04/reapportionment.html. See also: The Troy Record, July 8, 1971, page 1.\n\nIn 1970, the Rensselaer County Legislature was created, which elected Edward J. \"Ned\" Quinn as Chairman. The Chairman served as the equivalent to an executive until the office of [[County Executive]] was created in 1972. Since its creation, Democrats have never won the office, although they controlled the Legislature until 1994. One notable candidate for Executive was [[Edward Pattison]] who was later elected to Congress, and whose son Mark served two terms as Mayor of [[Troy, New York|Troy]].

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place.

Democracies who don't pay attention to these activities \u2013 and take measures to guard against them \u2013 risk becoming tethered to hyper-modern authoritarian states and losing their sovereignty in the process.\"<ref name=\"Haaretz\"/>\n\n==== Digital sovereignty ====\nHastie frames questions to do with the provision of information networks as a matter of sovereignty, which must be defended.

In an interview about his wartime experiences, he said:<blockquote> For me, it proved that culture and geography (are) decisive in the formation of societies and political institutions. Building lasting, trusted institutions takes time, generations of stewardship and public virtue.<ref name=\"Whinnett\"/></blockquote>\n Looking at Australia, Hastie believes that it is local institutions that provide civic foundations of \"accountability, freedom and democracy.\"<ref name=\"First Speech\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.andrewhastie.com.au/first_speech|title=First Speech|website=Andrew Hastie MP|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> He argued in his first speech that the first of these institutions is the family, which \"is central to a healthy society\"<ref name=\"First Speech\"/> but also extends to sporting clubs, service clubs, churches and local businesses.<ref name=\"First Speech\"/> In one op-ed, Hastie went even further, suggesting that community groups, or \"pre-political institutions\" are finally more important than governments:<blockquote> \"More powerful than the political levers of government are grassroots volunteer movements and pre-political institutions...

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].

The title, contributed by his wife, refers to his earlier statement that he would \"never again\" return to the role. Although the film performed well at the box office, it was plagued with production problems: strife between the director and producer, financial problems, the Fleming estate trustees' attempts to halt the film, and Connery's wrist being broken by fight choreographer, [[Steven Seagal]]. As a result of his negative experiences during filming, Connery became unhappy with the major studios and did not make any films for two years. Following the successful European production ''[[The Name of the Rose (film)|The Name of the Rose]]'' (1986), for which he won a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award, Connery's interest in more commercial material was revived. That same year, a supporting role in ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'' showcased his ability to play older mentors to younger leads, which became a recurring role in many of his later films.

In an attempt to put his economic and social theories into practice, Cabet led his followers to the United States of America in 1848, where the Icarians established a series of [[egalitarian]] [[Commune (intentional community)|communes]] in the states of Texas, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, and California. The movement split several times due to factional disagreements.\n\nThe last community of Icarians, located a few miles outside [[Corning, Iowa]], disbanded voluntarily in 1898. The 46 years of tenure at this location made the Corning Icarian Colony one of the longest-lived non-religious communal living experiments in US history.{{sfn |''What is America\u2019s French Icarian Village?''}}\n\n==History==\n=== Cabet as radical French politician ===\n[[File:Louis Philippe I, King of the French by Winterhalter (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Louis Philippe I, the moderate conservative Orl\u00e9anist king who replaced the extreme conservative Charles X following the revolution of 1830.]]\n\n[[\u00c9tienne Cabet]] was born in [[Dijon]], France in 1788 to a middle-class family of artisans.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=77}} Cabet attended a [[Roman Catholic]] secondary school and continued his education, ultimately earning a [[Doctorate of Law]] degree in 1812.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=77}} Cabet was not inclined towards jurisprudence, however, preferring the rough and tumble of politics and journalism. Following the fall of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1815, Cabet became active in the struggle against conservative [[theocracy|theocratic]] [[monarchism]], participating in political groups which espoused a constitutional and [[republicanism|republican]] form of government under monarchical leadership.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=77}}\n\nIn 1820 Cabet moved to Paris, the political center of the French nation.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=77}} There he continued to participate in secret revolutionary societies, at considerable personal risk.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=121}} It ultimately took a decade for this underground political effort to bear fruit when in July 1830 revolution erupted seeking the fundamental change of the conservative regime which had gained power in the [[Bourbon Restoration]] following the fall of Napoleon.\n\nThis [[July Revolution|Revolution of 1830]] in a matter of a few frenzied days forced the abdication of the conservative monarch [[Charles X]] and returned constitutional government to France. Cabet played a leading role in the revolution as a leading member of the so-called \"Insurrection Committee,\" activity for which he was recognized with appointment as Attorney-General for [[Corsica]] following the coronation of [[Louis Philippe]] as king.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=121}}\n\nHistorian [[Morris Hillquit]] has argued that the posting of Cabet to Corsica was a calculated \"shrewd move on the part of the government\" to remove a prominent radical critic from the political hothouse of Paris \"under the guise of a reward for his services during the revolution.\"{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=121}} Be that as it may, despite his employment as a government functionary in Corsica, Cabet moved into criticism of the new [[Orl\u00e9anist|Orl\u00e9anist regime]] for its conservatism and half-measures with respect to constitutional rule and the democratic rights of the people. This brought about Cabet's prompt removal from office by the new regime in Paris, at whose pleasure Cabet served.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=121}}\nFollowing his dismissal as Corsican Attorney-General, Cabet turned his hand to writing, authoring a four volume history of the [[French Revolution]]. He also remained active in politics and was elected as a deputy to the lower chamber of the National Assembly in 1834.{{sfn |Shaw |1884 |p=7}} Cabet emerged as a fierce opponent of the new conservative regime and a potential revolutionary leader, drawing the attention of the regime and its repressive mechanism.{{sfn |Shaw |1884 |p=7}} In an effort to eliminate the dangerous democratic agitator, Cabet was given the choice of two years' imprisonment or five years in foreign exile.{{sfn |Shaw |1884 |pp=7\u20138}} He decided upon the latter punishment and immediately went into exile in England.{{sfn |Shaw |1884 |p=8}}\n\nDuring his five years of English exile, Cabet dedicated himself to philosophical and economic study, carefully considering the relationship between political structures and economic welfare throughout history.{{sfn |Shaw |1884 |p=9}} Cabet's findings were later summarized thus by one of his acolytes:\n\n{{quote|Studying, pondering the history of all ages and countries, he at length arrived at the conclusion that mere political reforms are powerless to give to society the ... welfare which it obstinately seeks. ... He found at all epochs the same phenomena: society sundered in twain; on one side a minority, cruel, idle, arrogant, usurping exclusive enjoyment of the products of a majority, passive, toiling, ignorant, who remained wholly destitute. ... To change all this, to find the means of preventing one portion of humanity from being eternally the prey of the other \u2014 such was his desire, the goal of all his efforts.<ref>A. Sauva, ''Icarie.'' Quoted in {{harvnb|Shaw|1884 |p=9}}</ref>}}\n\nCabet turned to the idea of reorganization of society on a communal basis \u2014 known as \"Communism\" in the terminology of the day. His ideas for the modification of society closely paralleled those of a man he met in English exile, [[Robert Owen]].{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=122}}\n\n===''Voyage en Icarie''===\n[[File:Voyage-en-Icarie-1848.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Title page of the 1848 Fifth Edition of Cabet's ''Voyage en Icarie.'' The symmetrical layout includes a group of slogans summing up Cabet's philosophy.{{sfn |Shaw |1884 |p=16}}]]\n\nIn 1839, his five years' exile in England completed, Cabet returned to his native France. Upon his return he began writing a book to expound his economic and social ideas, following the example of [[Thomas More]] and using the form of an [[allegory|allegorical novel]] which allowed not only the exposition of the ideal form of administration but an opportunity for cloaked criticism of the existing regime.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=122}}\n\nThe result of Cabet's writing was published in 1840 as ''Voyage en Icarie'' (Voyage to Icaria). A rough translation by Cabet was serialized in Icarian periodicals of the 1850s; an additional translation by academic specialist Robert Sutton has been deposited with the Library of Congress, although it remains unpublished.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=92}} a basic plot outline was published by Morris Hillquit in 1903:\n\n{{quote|Lord Carisdall, a young English nobleman, has by chance learned of the existence of a remote and isolated country known as Icaria. The unusual mode of life, habits, and form of government of the Icarians excite his lordship's curiosity, and he decides to visit their country. ''Voyage en Icarie'' purports to be a journal in which our traveler records his remarkable experiences and discoveries in the strange country.\n\nThe first part of the book contains a glowing account of the blessings of the cooperative system of industry of the Icarians, their varied occupations and accomplishments, comfortable mode of life, admirable system of education, high morality, political freedom, equality of sexes, and general happiness. The second part contains a history of Icaria. It appears that the social order of the country had been similar to that prevailing in the rest of the world, until 1782, when the great national hero, Icar, after a successful revolution, established the system of communism.\n\nThis recital gives Cabet the opportunity for a scathing criticism of the faults of the present social structure, and also to outline his favorite measures for the transition from that system to the new regime.\n\n... The last part of the book is devoted to the history of development of the idea of communism, and contains a summary of the views of almost all known writers on the subject, from Plato down to the famous utopians of the early part of the 19th Century.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |pp=122\u2013123}}}}\n\nAlthough regarded today as a \"plodding melodrama\"{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=83}} in which the reader was inundated with \"tedious details of incidental aspects of Icarian life,\"{{sfn |Sutton |1994 |p=28}} Cabet's book was well received by readers of his day, with the principles it outlined viewed by many as a blueprint for advancement from a disappointing present to a glorious future.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=123}} Multiple editions of the book followed in quick succession and with public interest awakened Cabet quickly made the transition from author to builder of a practical movement to advance the communal ideas which he had expounded.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=123}} In March 1841 Cabet launched a monthly magazine, ''Le Populaire,'' as well as an annual ''Icarian Almanac'' to help propagandize and organize the new political movement's supporters.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=123}}\n\nSo-called \"Icarianism\" attracted numerous supporters in such French cities as [[Reims]], [[L\u00e9on, Landes|Leon]], [[Nantes]], [[Toulouse]], and [[Toulon]], with Cabet claiming the existence of 50,000 adherents of his ideas by the end of 1843.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=79}} These supporters began to see Cabet as a political messiah and sought to implement the leader's ideas in a practical setting.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=79}} It was gradually decided in this period that France did not present a favorable economic, political, or social environment for the implementation of the Icarian ideas; instead, the United States of America was chosen as a more fitting site for colonization \u2013 a nation with vast expanses of relatively inexpensive land and a democratic political tradition.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=79}}\n\nIn May 1847, Cabet's organ ''Le Populaire'' carried a lengthy article entitled \"Allons en Icarie\" (Let Us Go to Icaria), detailing the proposal to establish an American colony based upon the Icarian political and economic ideals and calling for those committed to building an artisanal and agrarian community to volunteer.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=79}} The wheels were thus set in motion for the formation of what was intended to be a prosperous and enviable collective entity.\n\n===Colonization begins===\nCabet believed that at least 10,000 or 20,000 working men would immediately enlist in the American colonization scheme, with the number soon swelling to a million skilled workers and artisans.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=124}} Towns and huge cities bursting with industry would shortly follow, with accompanying schools and cultural facilities assuring the good life for a happy and fulfilled community.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=124}} Announcement of the plan was met with enthusiasm, and offers of participation along with gifts of money, seeds, farm implements, clothing, books, and other valuable and useful items began to flow in.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=124}}\n\nCabet gave himself the task of choosing a precise location for colonization. Cabet turned to his friend Robert Owen for advice, traveling to London in September 1847 to consult with his British co-thinker.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=124}} Owen recommended colonization in the new American state of Texas, a location reckoned to possess vast tracts of unoccupied land which would be as inexpensive as it was plentiful.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=79}} Cabet made contact with a Texas land agent, The Peters Company, which agreed to present to Owen title for 1 million acres of land so long as it was colonized by July 1, 1848.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=125}}\n\n== Icarian settlements ==\n===Denton County, Texas===\n[[File:Icarian-lands.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Icarian colonists found themselves contractually forced to settle non-contiguous 320 acre half sections of land (dark squares), with 320 acre half sections retained by the land development company, and alternating 640 acre tracts retained by the state of Texas. (It proved impossible to homestead even these lands by the July 1, 1848 deadline.){{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |pp=126\u2013127}}]]\n\nOn February 3, 1848 a so-called \"advance guard\" of 69 Icarians departed from [[Le Havre]], France for a new life in Texas, leaving aboard the sailing ship ''Rome.''{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=125}} These were to proceed to the port of [[New Orleans]] and to make their way from there to the designated area in Texas, which was represented as being in close proximity to the [[Red River of the South|Red River]].{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=126}} The advance guard arrived in America on March 27, 1848.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=125}}\n\nThey were quick to discover that they had been deceived and that the actual lands designated for colonization were fully 25 miles away from the Red River; moreover, colony lands were not contiguous, but rather were separated into a checkerboard fashion,{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=281}} alternating state and private lands, making integrated communal life not possible.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=126}} Moreover, instead of the promised 1 million acres, actual contractual terms of the land distribution provided for the distribution of 320 acres of land to 3,125 individuals or families who each had to construct a log cabin and occupy their allotment by the deadline date of July 1, 1848.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=126}} With only 69 hands available for the construction, there was little hope for construction of more than about 30 cabins by the deadline.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=127}} The promised 1&nbsp;million acres was thereby transformed into perhaps 10,000. By 1849, only 281 Icarians stayed loyal to Cabet and remained to rebuild, whereas the rest went back to France.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=281}}\n\nThe party could only proceed by boat to [[Shreveport]]. A wagon was obtained and loaded it with provisions for a difficult overland trek via the [[Bonham Trail]] to a resting place halfway to the final destination. The first group of 25 men departed on April 8, followed in a second wagon by 14 others shortly thereafter.{{sfn |Sutton |1994 |p=57}} Both wagons broke down en route and the 39 Icarians were forced to proceed in small groups, packing what they could on their backs. It was not until April 21 that they arrived at their resting place, still more than a hundred difficult miles from their goal.{{sfn |Sutton |1994 | =58}}\n\nOnly 27 intrepid French settlers were able to make the final leg of the trip from the farm designated as a resting place to their new Texan utopia, a site located in today's [[Denton County, Texas|Denton County]] in Texas (northwest of [[Dallas]]).{{sfn |Sutton |1994 |p=58}} The small group arrived June 2, 1848,{{sfn |Sutton |1994 |p=58}} and immediately began a frenzied effort to construct dwellings in order to stake their land claims, attempting at the same time to plow and farm the prairie.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=127}} Virtually no time remained to meet the terms of the land concession. The hot summer sun began to bake the ground. Poorly fed, poorly housed, overworked and exhausted, the Icarian colonists next fell victim to an outbreaks of [[cholera]] and [[malaria]], illnesses which killed four and sickened the rest.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=128}} Making a bad situation still worse, the one medical doctor in the company broke down into a state of insanity and deserted his fellows.{{sfn |Sutton |1994 |p=58}}\n\nBack home in France, the [[French Revolution of 1848|Revolution of 1848]] had long been in full swing and King Louis Philippe overthrown. The necessity of emigration to achieve democratic reforms seemed less compelling and the volunteers for Icarian colonization in America melted away.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=128}} Some 1500 settlers were planned for the next wave of settlers; only 19 made the trip, of whom barely more than half ever made it to Texas to join the beleaguered \"advance guard\" in their Sisyphian task.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=128}}\n\nThe grim reality of their situation now clear, the Texas colonization venture was written off as a total loss by the participants and the survivors divided into small groups to make their way back to Shreveport and from there to New Orleans.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=128}} Four more died en route.{{sfn |Sutton |1994 |p=58}} Finally arriving in New Orleans late in 1848, the Texas pioneers were met by several hundred colonization enthusiasts from France, who had been slowly congregating in that city.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=128}} Their mood was grim.\n\nNews of the Texas catastrophe reached Cabet in France and on December 13, 1848, he set out from [[Liverpool]] for America in an attempt to shore up the project.{{sfn |Icarian Community |1880 |p=6}} After landing in New York, he shipped out again for New Orleans, disembarking there on January 19, 1849.{{sfn |Sutton |1994 |p=56}} Cabet found his supporters in disarray, \"in the deplorable spirit of a defeated army,\" to borrow words from an official history by the group.{{sfn |Icarian Community |1880 |p=6}} A portion of the prospective colonists sought to abandon the project and to return to France; others sought to continue the colonization project in a more suitable locale.{{sfn |Icarian Community |1880 |p=6}}\n\nOn January 21 the colonists held a general meeting to decide their fate. Cabet declared that if a majority sought to return home to France, he would support the decision \u2014 although with all the costs absorbed in the previous year such a move would have meant financial disaster for all.{{sfn |Sutton |1994 |p=61}} A small majority of 280 decided to continue with the colonization project if a more suitable locale was found; 200 sought to return.{{sfn |Sutton |1994 |p=61}} A formal split of the Icarians along these lines immediately followed, the first of three great factional rifts which would split the movement.\n\nAn amount of money was pared from the treasury to send the 200 disaffected Icarians home to [[Le Havre]].<ref group=note>Contemporary scholar Robert P. Sutton records this amount as 86,000 francs, or about $3,000 {{harv |Sutton |1994 |p=61}}, while the ''Brief History of Icaria'' records the figure as $5,000 {{harv|Icarian Community |1880 |p=6}}.</ref> Once back in France, many of the former Icarian colonists initiated legal proceedings against Cabet for fraud \u2013 charges which he was ultimately forced home to answer.{{sfn |Sutton |1994 |p=61}}\n\nThe majority, consisting of about 280 people, joined Cabet in setting out for the [[Mississippi River]] town of [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], located in [[Hancock County, Illinois]], where the Icarian experiment finally began in earnest.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=129}}\n\n===Nauvoo, Illinois===\n[[File:Nauvoo3b24766u.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Mississippi River town of Nauvoo, Illinois as it appeared circa 1855, during the time of its occupation by Icarian colonists.]]\nNauvoo was founded in 1839 for the gathering of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]]. Even though [[Joseph Smith]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], was [[death of Joseph Smith|killed]] in 1844, by 1845 Nauvoo had grown to a community of about 15,000 people \u2013 dwarfing the city of Chicago, which had only about 8,000 inhabitants at that time.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=129}} Under threat of continuing violence from the surrounding communities and following a [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]], most of the [[Latter-day Saints]], under [[Brigham Young]] left in 1846 for [[Salt Lake City]], Utah, the current headquarters of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. The Latter-day Saints later sold their land to the Icarians in 1849.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=282}}\n\nNauvoo would become the first permanent Icarian Community, the Icarians immediately adopting the charter and structure described in Cabet's ''Voyage en Icarie''. The structure included an annually elected president and one officer each to administrate finance, farming, industry, and education.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=282}} New members were admitted by a majority approval vote by the adult males, after living in the commune for four months, forfeiting all personal property, and pledging $80.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=282}} Nonetheless, visitors were welcome to stay as long as they wished in a hotel.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=283}}\n\nEvery family used the same amount of space (two rooms in an apartment building), and were allowed the same amount of furniture.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=282}} After the age of four, children lived apart from their parents at a boarding school, and visited families only on Sundays. This was done to foster a love for the community \"without developing special affection for parents\" from a young age,{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=283}} theoretically instrumental to the smooth working of a Utopian society. Sundays were not what would be a typical religious Sunday; the Icarians practiced no religion,{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=283}} but there were days people voluntarily gathered in a fellowship called \"Cours icarien\" to discuss Cabet's writings and Christian morals and ethics.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=283}}\n[[File:Historic Nauvoo marker P6081267.jpg|thumb|left|Historic Nauvoo marker near the Nauvoo Temple]]\nBecause long-term celibacy was viewed askance by the community, marriage was the norm. Divorce was acceptable under the assumption individuals would remarry soon.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=283}}\n\nWith the basic need of shelter immediately settled, a short period of energetic growth and relative prosperity followed. Farmland was rented, a saw mill and flour mill opened, workshops established, and schools and a theater founded.<ref name=Brief7>''Brief History of Icaria,'' pg. 7.</ref> A periodical press was launched, publishing in French, English, and German, and an office was established in Paris to recruit adherents for the American colony.<ref name=Brief7 /> The Nauvoo cultural life thrived. The Icarians held regular band concerts and theatre productions. Their library consisted of an extensive collection, ranging from reference works to applied science to popular novels, all in English and French, and totaling over 4,000 volumes.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=283}} By 1855 there would be more than 500 participants in the Icarian project.{{sfn |Icarian Community |1880 |p=6}}\n\nPolitical disagreements and personal animosities would lead to the second major split of the Icarians in America. \u00c9tienne Cabet began in America in 1849 with the authority of the sect's unquestioned leader, status which was freely granted to him by those inspired to action by the man's writings.<ref name=Brief7 /> This individual status as supreme decision-maker stood in marked contradiction to the democratic ideals of the community, however. Cabet himself realized as much and in 1850 he proposed a constitution which provided for an elected President and an elected board of directors, which would supplant the absolute, personal authority of the unitary leader.<ref name=Brief7 /> This system functioned effectively for a time.\n\nIn 1852, a lawsuit was filed in Paris against Cabet by a number of dissident former Icarians, who claimed their property was obtained by him by means of fraud. Cabet returned to France for 18 months to fight these charges. When he returned to America, Cabet began to push through a series of restrictive rules, including the prohibition of talking in workshops, banning the use of tobacco or alcohol, and other regulations which were unpopular with some members of the community. He also moved to reestablish his own personal decision-making authority over the entire community, proposing in December 1855 to revise the constitution to provide for a powerful President elected to a four-year term.<ref name=Brief7 /> This President, under Cabet's new scheme, would have the ability to control all aspects of the community's government.<ref name=Brief7 />\n[[File:Icarians (1849-1856) P6081245.jpg|thumb|200px|Temple Block map, Nauvoo Icarians (1849-1856)]]\nThis position by Cabet was anathema to a majority of the Icarian cooperators, who were deeply inspired and influenced by the history and traditions of the Great French Revolution and its democratic ideals. Cabet's position was deeply held by him as essential to the preservation of the community's moral fiber, however, and in his position he was staunchly supported by \"a strong minority.\"<ref name=Brief7 />\n\nThe factional battle continued for a year between the Dissidents, led by [[Alexis Armel Marchand]] and [[Jean Baptist Gerard]],{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=284}} and the Cabetists, finally resolving itself in a formal split.<ref name=Brief7 /> The Cabetists were expelled, and Cabet led about 170 of his followers out of Nauvoo in October 1856, heading downstream along the Mississippi to the bustling metropolis of [[St. Louis]] to establish a new colony in that vicinity.\n\nShattered by the loss of about 40% of its members and no longer able to raise financial support in France, the Nauvoo colony of the majority faction ultimately encountered financial difficulties and was forced to disband in 1860. Many of the participants of the defunct Nauvoo colony would join the parallel Icarian colony in Iowa.\n\nOne legacy still continues in Nauvoo. Emile and Annette Baxte joined the Icarians in 1855 and then left in 1857 and founded Baxter's Vineyards and Winery. It has been operated by several generations of the family and is Illinois' oldest winery.{{sfn |Soland |2017 |p=65}}{{sfn |''Baxter's Vineyards & Winery 2013''}}\n\n===Cheltenham, Missouri===\n\nThe Icarians who had left Nauvoo owing to their support of personal leadership of Cabet and his restrictive behavioral agenda arrived in St. Louis on November 6, 1856. In an ironic twist of fate, the leader for whom they had executed the split of Icaria in Nauvoo, \u00c9tienne Cabet, died just two days later. The new leader became a thirty-two-year-old lawyer named [[Benjamin Mercadier]].{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=284}}\n\nOn February 15, 1858, a group of 151 Icarians took possession of a few hundred acres in [[Cheltenham, St. Louis]], Missouri. These Cabetists used Cabet's money and put down $500 on a $25,000 mortgage for thirty-nine acres and three buildings southwest of this city.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=284}} Adjusting to a new area and new locals was difficult, but the Icarians adopted a constitution, a replica of the Nauvoo one, worked in the city, and enrolled their children into the local public schools.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=284}} The colony quickly fell into various arguments. During the Civil War, many young men joined the Union cause. By 1864, only about twenty residents remained on the property. For the rest of the people, epidemics of dysentery and cholera occurred in the warmer months.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=284}} Because the Icarians could not meet the mortgage payments, in March 1864, Ars\u00e8ne Sauva returned the keys to the property to St. Louis banker Thomas Allen (from whom the property had been purchased in 1858), leaving a large debt. That same year, most members left the community, and the Cheltenham Icaria was no longer extant.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=284}}\n\nIn 1872, the buildings went into a state of disrepair, and in 1875, a fire destroyed the buildings on this property, removing the last evidence of the Icarian colony.\n\n===Corning, Iowa===\n[[File:Icarian Colony from the southest corner -2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|French Icarian colony being rebuilt as a living history site near Corning, Iowa. Seen are replicas of the great hall and the community's 1860 schoolhouse.]]\n\nIn 1852, Icarians purchased land in [[Adams County, Iowa]] to form a new permanent settlement, and Icarians began settling southwest of [[Queen City, Iowa|Queen City]] in 1853. In 1860, when the Nauvoo colony went bankrupt, many members of the community moved to the new site in Iowa. The settlers arrived with nothing but their skills along with $20,000 of debt. Their land was that of {{convert|4000|acre|km2}} where they first found shelter in mud hovels and then in crudely built log cabins. The colony near what became [[Corning, Iowa]] was granted a charter of incorporation by the [[state of Iowa]] in 1860. The community prospered during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] by selling food at good prices, and they were able to pay their collective debt by 1870.\n\nIn the spring of 1874 the Icarian colony near Corning was visited by [[Charles_Nordhoff_(journalist)|Charles Nordhoff]], who was travelling the United States doing investigative research on such communities in preparation for writing a book.{{sfn |Nordhoff |1875 |p=337}} At that time Nordhoff found a two-story building, 60 feet by 24, which served as a collective dining hall, washhouse, and school{{sfn |Nordhoff |1875 |p=337}} About a dozen cheaply built frame houses sheltered the colonists, who at the time included about 65 members in 11 families.{{sfn |Nordhoff |1875 |p=336}} Most of those in the community were of French ethnicity, and French was the language spoken by the colonists, although among their number were included \"one American, one Swiss, a Swede, a Spaniard, and two Germans.\"{{sfn |Nordhoff |1875 |p=337}}\n\nNordhoff wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The children look remarkably healthy, and on Sunday were dressed with great taste. The living is still of the plainest. In the common dining-hall they assemble in groups at the tables, which were without a cloth, and they drink out of tin cups, and pour their water from tin cans. 'It is very plain,' said one to me; 'but we are independent \u2014 no man's servants \u2014 and we are content.'{{sfn |Nordhoff |1875 |p=337}}</blockquote>\n\nNordhoff noted that the Iowa colony sold to the market about 2,500 pounds of wool annually, as well as cattle and hogs and the product of its manufacturing facilities.{{sfn |Nordhoff |1875 |p=337}} The group continued to operate under an elaborate constitution written by Cabet, \"which lays down with great care the equality and brotherhood of mankind, and the duty of holding all things in common; abolishes servitude or service (or servants); commands marriage, under penalties; provides for education; and requires that the majority shall rule.\"{{sfn |Nordhoff |1875 |pp=337\u2013338}}\nGovernance was based upon weekly meetings of all adults each Saturday, with a President elected annually as formal head of the colony but officers for the conduct of meetings elected each week.{{sfn |Nordhoff |1875 |p=338}} In addition to the President there were four elected directors, in charge of agriculture, clothing, industry, and construction, respectively.{{sfn |Nordhoff |1875 |p=338}}\n\nNordhoff noted that the community had no formal religious observances.{{sfn |Nordhoff |1875 |p=338}} Instead, \"Sunday is a day of rest from labor, when the young men go out with guns, and the society sometimes has theatrical representations, or music, or some kind of amusement.

The \"''vieux icariens''\" were against allowing women the right to vote, but the \"''jeunes icariens''\" were in favor. By a vote of 31\u201317, the entire community voted against the franchise for women. After that, the ''jeunes icariens'' moved to a new site on the same property about one mile southeast. The move was done by moving eight frame houses from the original colony.{{sfn |Gauthier |1992 |pp=91\u201392}} The ''vieux icariens'' community was no longer viable and was forced to disband due to bankruptcy in 1878.

The group bought the 885-acre Bluxome ranch on the Russian River, which included vineyards, orchards, and arable land.{{sfn |Shaw |1884 |pp=139\u2013143}} Originally named Speranza, after Leroux's review ''L'Esperance'', the community gained remaining members of Young Icaria and became Icaria-Speranza.{{sfn |Gauthier |1992 |p=93}}\nAt its height, the settlement had an estimated population of 55 individuals.{{sfn |Ross |National Icarian Heritage Society |1989 |p=21}} This settlement disbanded in 1886.

Those who passed a probationary period of four months would be allowed to move to the permanent colony in Iowa.\n\n===Equality===\nThe Icarians lived in communal dwellings of dormitories that shared central living and dining areas. All families lived in two equal rooms in an apartment building and had the same kind of furniture. Children were raised in a communal [[day care|creche]], not just by their own parents. Tasks were divided among the group; one might be a seamstress and never need to cook.\n\n===Housing===\nWhen the Icarians first arrived at Nauvoo on March 15, 1849, they purchased a number of buildings, grounds, houses, cattle and the burned-out Mormon Temple which they intended to use as an academy or school.\n\nAfter all purchases and repairs were done, the Nauvoo Icarian village consisted of a dwelling of individual apartments, two schools (one for girls and the other for boys), two infirmaries, a pharmacy, a large community kitchen with dining hall, a bakery, a butchery, and a room for laundry facilities. Soon thereafter, a steam-powered flour mill, a distillery, pigsty and sawmill were added. A local coal mine was worked for fuel.\n\n===Work===\n[[File:Icarian Colony cemetery plaque.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Plaque at the Icarian cemetery at the ''jeune icariens'' community listing those who died here from 1878 to 1898; erected by the state of Iowa in 1992.]]\n\nAll work was divided by sex. Men worked as tailors, masons, wheelwrights, shoemakers, mechanics, blacksmiths, carpenters, tanners, and butchers. Women worked as cooks, seamstresses, washerwomen and ironers.\n\nTo earn money, the Icarians established commerce with the outside world by a small store outside St. Louis. Here they sold their handmade shoes, boots and dresses, and also sold items made by the mills and distillery.\n\n===Religion===\nThe Icarians believed in a higher power and had a ten-section principle that briefly stated what they thought was needed in a perfect society.\n\nThe religion of choice should have an understanding of the following:\n*Evil, Misfortune\t\n*Intelligence\n*Causes of Evil\n*God and Perfection\n*Destiny of Humanity, Happiness\n*Sociability\n*Perfectibility\n*The Remedy\n*God, Father of the Human Race\t\n\nAt eighteen years of age, the Icarians were instructed on world religions. Marriage in the community was highly encouraged, almost insisted upon. Divorce was allowed; however, members were encouraged to remarry as soon as possible.\n\nCabet's book ''Vrai christianisme'' (''True Christianity'') was often read from and formed the dominant influence on religious thought, though it was not intended as a specific instruction on religious observances. In the Iowa colony, the Icarians adopted the practice of an informal religious gathering known as the \"Cours Icariens\" (\"Icarian Course\") on Sunday afternoons. In addition to reading from ''Vrai christianisme'' and other books, these gatherings included quiet games and conversation.\n\n=== Culture ===\nCulture in Icaria was the second highest priority, second only to education. The community held several concerts and theatrical productions for the entertainment of its members, performing works such as \"The Salamander\", \"Death to the Rats\", \"Six Heads in a Hat\", or \"Fisherman's Daughter\".\n\nIn Nauvoo, there was a library of over 4,000 books, the biggest in Illinois at the time. The community also distributed a biweekly newspaper titled ''Colonie Icarienne''.\n\nThe most important holidays were February 3, the anniversary of the First Departure of Icarians from France, and July 4, the summer festival. On July 4, the refectory was decorated with garlands and boughs; cardboard signs declared \"Equality\", \"Freedom\", and \"Unity\", and banners had quotations like \"All for Each; Each for All\", \"To Each According to Their Needs\", and \"First Right is to Live; First Duty is to Work\". They raised the American flag and played the \"Star Spangled Banner\" and \"America\". They travelled into Corning to watch the Fourth of July parade, but they remained apart from the anglophone Americans. At the end of the day, they returned to Icaria (three miles east) for a banquet, dance, and theatrical presentation. Icarians also celebrated Christmas, New Year's Day, and the ''Fete du Mais'', a fall harvest corn festival similar to Thanksgiving.\n\n=== Women's rights ===\nMen and women were given equal participation opportunities in weekly community assemblies, voting on admissions, constitutional changes, and the election of the officer in charge of clothing and lodging.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |last=Cabet |first=\u00c9tienne |title=Ce que je ferais si j'avais cinq cent mille dollars |publisher=Service Commun de Documentation de l'Universit\u00e9 de Poitiers |location=Poitiers |year=2009 |orig-year=1854 |isbn=9782370760722 |oclc=864436728 |language=fr}}\n*{{cite book |last=Cabet |first=\u00c9tienne |title=Colonie ou r\u00e9publique Icarienne dans les Etats-Unis d'Am\u00e9rique : son histoire |location=Paris |publisher=Chez l'auteur |year=1855 |oclc=85798566  |language=fr}}\n*{{cite book |author=Icarian Community |last2=Cabet |first2=\u00c9tienne |title=Conditions of admission |location=Nauvoo, IL, US |publisher=Icarian Printing Establishment |year=1854 |oclc=54271194}}\n*{{cite book |last=Cabet |first=\u00c9tienne |title=Opinion icarienne sur le mariage : organisation icarienne, naturalisation |location=Paris |publisher=Auteur |year=1855 |id={{OCLC|255287992|457217473|29620127}} |language=fr}}\n*{{cite web |last=Cabet |first=\u00c9tienne |title=Voyage en Icarie : roman philosophique et social |location=Paris |publisher=J.

In an attempt to put his economic and social theories into practice, Cabet led his followers to the United States of America in 1848, where the Icarians established a series of [[egalitarian]] [[Commune (intentional community)|communes]] in the states of Texas, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, and California. The movement split several times due to factional disagreements.\n\nThe last community of Icarians, located a few miles outside [[Corning, Iowa]], disbanded voluntarily in 1898. The 46 years of tenure at this location made the Corning Icarian Colony one of the longest-lived non-religious communal living experiments in US history.{{sfn |''What is America\u2019s French Icarian Village?''}}\n\n==History==\n=== Cabet as radical French politician ===\n[[File:Louis Philippe I, King of the French by Winterhalter (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Louis Philippe I, the moderate conservative Orl\u00e9anist king who replaced the extreme conservative Charles X following the revolution of 1830.]]\n\n[[\u00c9tienne Cabet]] was born in [[Dijon]], France in 1788 to a middle-class family of artisans.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=77}} Cabet attended a [[Roman Catholic]] secondary school and continued his education, ultimately earning a [[Doctorate of Law]] degree in 1812.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=77}} Cabet was not inclined towards jurisprudence, however, preferring the rough and tumble of politics and journalism. Following the fall of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1815, Cabet became active in the struggle against conservative [[theocracy|theocratic]] [[monarchism]], participating in political groups which espoused a constitutional and [[republicanism|republican]] form of government under monarchical leadership.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=77}}\n\nIn 1820 Cabet moved to Paris, the political center of the French nation.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=77}} There he continued to participate in secret revolutionary societies, at considerable personal risk.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=121}} It ultimately took a decade for this underground political effort to bear fruit when in July 1830 revolution erupted seeking the fundamental change of the conservative regime which had gained power in the [[Bourbon Restoration]] following the fall of Napoleon.\n\nThis [[July Revolution|Revolution of 1830]] in a matter of a few frenzied days forced the abdication of the conservative monarch [[Charles X]] and returned constitutional government to France. Cabet played a leading role in the revolution as a leading member of the so-called \"Insurrection Committee,\" activity for which he was recognized with appointment as Attorney-General for [[Corsica]] following the coronation of [[Louis Philippe]] as king.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=121}}\n\nHistorian [[Morris Hillquit]] has argued that the posting of Cabet to Corsica was a calculated \"shrewd move on the part of the government\" to remove a prominent radical critic from the political hothouse of Paris \"under the guise of a reward for his services during the revolution.\"{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=121}} Be that as it may, despite his employment as a government functionary in Corsica, Cabet moved into criticism of the new [[Orl\u00e9anist|Orl\u00e9anist regime]] for its conservatism and half-measures with respect to constitutional rule and the democratic rights of the people. This brought about Cabet's prompt removal from office by the new regime in Paris, at whose pleasure Cabet served.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=121}}\nFollowing his dismissal as Corsican Attorney-General, Cabet turned his hand to writing, authoring a four volume history of the [[French Revolution]]. He also remained active in politics and was elected as a deputy to the lower chamber of the National Assembly in 1834.{{sfn |Shaw |1884 |p=7}} Cabet emerged as a fierce opponent of the new conservative regime and a potential revolutionary leader, drawing the attention of the regime and its repressive mechanism.{{sfn |Shaw |1884 |p=7}} In an effort to eliminate the dangerous democratic agitator, Cabet was given the choice of two years' imprisonment or five years in foreign exile.{{sfn |Shaw |1884 |pp=7\u20138}} He decided upon the latter punishment and immediately went into exile in England.{{sfn |Shaw |1884 |p=8}}\n\nDuring his five years of English exile, Cabet dedicated himself to philosophical and economic study, carefully considering the relationship between political structures and economic welfare throughout history.{{sfn |Shaw |1884 |p=9}} Cabet's findings were later summarized thus by one of his acolytes:\n\n{{quote|Studying, pondering the history of all ages and countries, he at length arrived at the conclusion that mere political reforms are powerless to give to society the ... welfare which it obstinately seeks. ... He found at all epochs the same phenomena: society sundered in twain; on one side a minority, cruel, idle, arrogant, usurping exclusive enjoyment of the products of a majority, passive, toiling, ignorant, who remained wholly destitute. ... To change all this, to find the means of preventing one portion of humanity from being eternally the prey of the other \u2014 such was his desire, the goal of all his efforts.<ref>A. Sauva, ''Icarie.'' Quoted in {{harvnb|Shaw|1884 |p=9}}</ref>}}\n\nCabet turned to the idea of reorganization of society on a communal basis \u2014 known as \"Communism\" in the terminology of the day. His ideas for the modification of society closely paralleled those of a man he met in English exile, [[Robert Owen]].{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=122}}\n\n===''Voyage en Icarie''===\n[[File:Voyage-en-Icarie-1848.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Title page of the 1848 Fifth Edition of Cabet's ''Voyage en Icarie.''

Upon his return he began writing a book to expound his economic and social ideas, following the example of [[Thomas More]] and using the form of an [[allegory|allegorical novel]] which allowed not only the exposition of the ideal form of administration but an opportunity for cloaked criticism of the existing regime.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=122}}\n\nThe result of Cabet's writing was published in 1840 as ''Voyage en Icarie'' (Voyage to Icaria). A rough translation by Cabet was serialized in Icarian periodicals of the 1850s; an additional translation by academic specialist Robert Sutton has been deposited with the Library of Congress, although it remains unpublished.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=92}} a basic plot outline was published by Morris Hillquit in 1903:\n\n{{quote|Lord Carisdall, a young English nobleman, has by chance learned of the existence of a remote and isolated country known as Icaria. The unusual mode of life, habits, and form of government of the Icarians excite his lordship's curiosity, and he decides to visit their country. ''Voyage en Icarie'' purports to be a journal in which our traveler records his remarkable experiences and discoveries in the strange country.\n\nThe first part of the book contains a glowing account of the blessings of the cooperative system of industry of the Icarians, their varied occupations and accomplishments, comfortable mode of life, admirable system of education, high morality, political freedom, equality of sexes, and general happiness. The second part contains a history of Icaria. It appears that the social order of the country had been similar to that prevailing in the rest of the world, until 1782, when the great national hero, Icar, after a successful revolution, established the system of communism.\n\nThis recital gives Cabet the opportunity for a scathing criticism of the faults of the present social structure, and also to outline his favorite measures for the transition from that system to the new regime.\n\n... The last part of the book is devoted to the history of development of the idea of communism, and contains a summary of the views of almost all known writers on the subject, from Plato down to the famous utopians of the early part of the 19th Century.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |pp=122\u2013123}}}}\n\nAlthough regarded today as a \"plodding melodrama\"{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=83}} in which the reader was inundated with \"tedious details of incidental aspects of Icarian life,\"{{sfn |Sutton |1994 |p=28}} Cabet's book was well received by readers of his day, with the principles it outlined viewed by many as a blueprint for advancement from a disappointing present to a glorious future.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=123}} Multiple editions of the book followed in quick succession and with public interest awakened Cabet quickly made the transition from author to builder of a practical movement to advance the communal ideas which he had expounded.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=123}} In March 1841 Cabet launched a monthly magazine, ''Le Populaire,'' as well as an annual ''Icarian Almanac'' to help propagandize and organize the new political movement's supporters.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=123}}\n\nSo-called \"Icarianism\" attracted numerous supporters in such French cities as [[Reims]], [[L\u00e9on, Landes|Leon]], [[Nantes]], [[Toulouse]], and [[Toulon]], with Cabet claiming the existence of 50,000 adherents of his ideas by the end of 1843.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=79}} These supporters began to see Cabet as a political messiah and sought to implement the leader's ideas in a practical setting.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=79}} It was gradually decided in this period that France did not present a favorable economic, political, or social environment for the implementation of the Icarian ideas; instead, the United States of America was chosen as a more fitting site for colonization \u2013 a nation with vast expanses of relatively inexpensive land and a democratic political tradition.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=79}}\n\nIn May 1847, Cabet's organ ''Le Populaire'' carried a lengthy article entitled \"Allons en Icarie\" (Let Us Go to Icaria), detailing the proposal to establish an American colony based upon the Icarian political and economic ideals and calling for those committed to building an artisanal and agrarian community to volunteer.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=79}} The wheels were thus set in motion for the formation of what was intended to be a prosperous and enviable collective entity.\n\n===Colonization begins===\nCabet believed that at least 10,000 or 20,000 working men would immediately enlist in the American colonization scheme, with the number soon swelling to a million skilled workers and artisans.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=124}} Towns and huge cities bursting with industry would shortly follow, with accompanying schools and cultural facilities assuring the good life for a happy and fulfilled community.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=124}} Announcement of the plan was met with enthusiasm, and offers of participation along with gifts of money, seeds, farm implements, clothing, books, and other valuable and useful items began to flow in.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=124}}\n\nCabet gave himself the task of choosing a precise location for colonization. Cabet turned to his friend Robert Owen for advice, traveling to London in September 1847 to consult with his British co-thinker.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=124}} Owen recommended colonization in the new American state of Texas, a location reckoned to possess vast tracts of unoccupied land which would be as inexpensive as it was plentiful.{{sfn |Roberts |1991 |p=79}} Cabet made contact with a Texas land agent, The Peters Company, which agreed to present to Owen title for 1 million acres of land so long as it was colonized by July 1, 1848.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=125}}\n\n== Icarian settlements ==\n===Denton County, Texas===\n[[File:Icarian-lands.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Icarian colonists found themselves contractually forced to settle non-contiguous 320 acre half sections of land (dark squares), with 320 acre half sections retained by the land development company, and alternating 640 acre tracts retained by the state of Texas.

Even though [[Joseph Smith]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], was [[death of Joseph Smith|killed]] in 1844, by 1845 Nauvoo had grown to a community of about 15,000 people \u2013 dwarfing the city of Chicago, which had only about 8,000 inhabitants at that time.{{sfn |Hillquit |1903 |p=129}} Under threat of continuing violence from the surrounding communities and following a [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]], most of the [[Latter-day Saints]], under [[Brigham Young]] left in 1846 for [[Salt Lake City]], Utah, the current headquarters of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. The Latter-day Saints later sold their land to the Icarians in 1849.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=282}}\n\nNauvoo would become the first permanent Icarian Community, the Icarians immediately adopting the charter and structure described in Cabet's ''Voyage en Icarie''. The structure included an annually elected president and one officer each to administrate finance, farming, industry, and education.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=282}} New members were admitted by a majority approval vote by the adult males, after living in the commune for four months, forfeiting all personal property, and pledging $80.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=282}} Nonetheless, visitors were welcome to stay as long as they wished in a hotel.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=283}}\n\nEvery family used the same amount of space (two rooms in an apartment building), and were allowed the same amount of furniture.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=282}} After the age of four, children lived apart from their parents at a boarding school, and visited families only on Sundays. This was done to foster a love for the community \"without developing special affection for parents\" from a young age,{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=283}} theoretically instrumental to the smooth working of a Utopian society. Sundays were not what would be a typical religious Sunday; the Icarians practiced no religion,{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=283}} but there were days people voluntarily gathered in a fellowship called \"Cours icarien\" to discuss Cabet's writings and Christian morals and ethics.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=283}}\n[[File:Historic Nauvoo marker P6081267.jpg|thumb|left|Historic Nauvoo marker near the Nauvoo Temple]]\nBecause long-term celibacy was viewed askance by the community, marriage was the norm. Divorce was acceptable under the assumption individuals would remarry soon.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=283}}\n\nWith the basic need of shelter immediately settled, a short period of energetic growth and relative prosperity followed. Farmland was rented, a saw mill and flour mill opened, workshops established, and schools and a theater founded.<ref name=Brief7>''Brief History of Icaria,'' pg. 7.</ref> A periodical press was launched, publishing in French, English, and German, and an office was established in Paris to recruit adherents for the American colony.<ref name=Brief7 /> The Nauvoo cultural life thrived.

Cabet himself realized as much and in 1850 he proposed a constitution which provided for an elected President and an elected board of directors, which would supplant the absolute, personal authority of the unitary leader.<ref name=Brief7 /> This system functioned effectively for a time.\n\nIn 1852, a lawsuit was filed in Paris against Cabet by a number of dissident former Icarians, who claimed their property was obtained by him by means of fraud. Cabet returned to France for 18 months to fight these charges. When he returned to America, Cabet began to push through a series of restrictive rules, including the prohibition of talking in workshops, banning the use of tobacco or alcohol, and other regulations which were unpopular with some members of the community. He also moved to reestablish his own personal decision-making authority over the entire community, proposing in December 1855 to revise the constitution to provide for a powerful President elected to a four-year term.<ref name=Brief7 /> This President, under Cabet's new scheme, would have the ability to control all aspects of the community's government.<ref name=Brief7 />\n[[File:Icarians (1849-1856) P6081245.jpg|thumb|200px|Temple Block map, Nauvoo Icarians (1849-1856)]]\nThis position by Cabet was anathema to a majority of the Icarian cooperators, who were deeply inspired and influenced by the history and traditions of the Great French Revolution and its democratic ideals. Cabet's position was deeply held by him as essential to the preservation of the community's moral fiber, however, and in his position he was staunchly supported by \"a strong minority.\"<ref name=Brief7 />\n\nThe factional battle continued for a year between the Dissidents, led by [[Alexis Armel Marchand]] and [[Jean Baptist Gerard]],{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=284}} and the Cabetists, finally resolving itself in a formal split.<ref name=Brief7 /> The Cabetists were expelled, and Cabet led about 170 of his followers out of Nauvoo in October 1856, heading downstream along the Mississippi to the bustling metropolis of [[St. Louis]] to establish a new colony in that vicinity.\n\nShattered by the loss of about 40% of its members and no longer able to raise financial support in France, the Nauvoo colony of the majority faction ultimately encountered financial difficulties and was forced to disband in 1860. Many of the participants of the defunct Nauvoo colony would join the parallel Icarian colony in Iowa.\n\nOne legacy still continues in Nauvoo. Emile and Annette Baxte joined the Icarians in 1855 and then left in 1857 and founded Baxter's Vineyards and Winery.

In an ironic twist of fate, the leader for whom they had executed the split of Icaria in Nauvoo, \u00c9tienne Cabet, died just two days later. The new leader became a thirty-two-year-old lawyer named [[Benjamin Mercadier]].{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=284}}\n\nOn February 15, 1858, a group of 151 Icarians took possession of a few hundred acres in [[Cheltenham, St. Louis]], Missouri.

During the Civil War, many young men joined the Union cause. By 1864, only about twenty residents remained on the property. For the rest of the people, epidemics of dysentery and cholera occurred in the warmer months.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=284}} Because the Icarians could not meet the mortgage payments, in March 1864, Ars\u00e8ne Sauva returned the keys to the property to St. Louis banker Thomas Allen (from whom the property had been purchased in 1858), leaving a large debt. That same year, most members left the community, and the Cheltenham Icaria was no longer extant.{{sfn |Pitzer |Boyer |1997 |p=284}}\n\nIn 1872, the buildings went into a state of disrepair, and in 1875, a fire destroyed the buildings on this property, removing the last evidence of the Icarian colony.\n\n===Corning, Iowa===\n[[File:Icarian Colony from the southest corner -2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|French Icarian colony being rebuilt as a living history site near Corning, Iowa.

In 1860, when the Nauvoo colony went bankrupt, many members of the community moved to the new site in Iowa. The settlers arrived with nothing but their skills along with $20,000 of debt. Their land was that of {{convert|4000|acre|km2}} where they first found shelter in mud hovels and then in crudely built log cabins. The colony near what became [[Corning, Iowa]] was granted a charter of incorporation by the [[state of Iowa]] in 1860. The community prospered during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] by selling food at good prices, and they were able to pay their collective debt by 1870.\n\nIn the spring of 1874 the Icarian colony near Corning was visited by [[[[Charles_Nordhoff_(journalist)|Charles Nordhoff]]]], who was travelling the United States doing investigative research on such communities in preparation for writing a book.{{sfn |Nordhoff |1875 |p=337}} At that time Nordhoff found a two-story building, 60 feet by 24, which served as a collective dining hall, washhouse, and school{{sfn |Nordhoff |1875 |p=337}} About a dozen cheaply built frame houses sheltered the colonists, who at the time included about 65 members in 11 families.{{sfn |Nordhoff |1875 |p=336}} Most of those in the community were of French ethnicity, and French was the language spoken by the colonists, although among their number were included \"one American, one Swiss, a Swede, a Spaniard, and two Germans.\"{{sfn |Nordhoff |1875 |p=337}}\n\nNordhoff wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The children look remarkably healthy, and on Sunday were dressed with great taste.

Here they sold their handmade shoes, boots and dresses, and also sold items made by the mills and distillery.\n\n===Religion===\nThe Icarians believed in a higher power and had a ten-section principle that briefly stated what they thought was needed in a perfect society.\n\nThe religion of choice should have an understanding of the following:\n*Evil, Misfortune\t\n*Intelligence\n*Causes of Evil\n*God and Perfection\n*Destiny of Humanity, Happiness\n*Sociability\n*Perfectibility\n*The Remedy\n*God, Father of the Human Race\t\n\nAt eighteen years of age, the Icarians were instructed on world religions. Marriage in the community was highly encouraged, almost insisted upon. Divorce was allowed; however, members were encouraged to remarry as soon as possible.\n\nCabet's book ''Vrai christianisme'' (''True Christianity'') was often read from and formed the dominant influence on religious thought, though it was not intended as a specific instruction on religious observances. In the Iowa colony, the Icarians adopted the practice of an informal religious gathering known as the \"Cours Icariens\" (\"Icarian Course\") on Sunday afternoons. In addition to reading from ''Vrai christianisme'' and other books, these gatherings included quiet games and conversation.\n\n=== Culture ===\nCulture in Icaria was the second highest priority, second only to education. The community held several concerts and theatrical productions for the entertainment of its members, performing works such as \"The Salamander\", \"Death to the Rats\", \"Six Heads in a Hat\", or \"Fisherman's Daughter\".\n\nIn Nauvoo, there was a library of over 4,000 books, the biggest in Illinois at the time. The community also distributed a biweekly newspaper titled ''Colonie Icarienne''.\n\nThe most important holidays were February 3, the anniversary of the First Departure of Icarians from France, and July 4, the summer festival. On July 4, the refectory was decorated with garlands and boughs; cardboard signs declared \"Equality\", \"Freedom\", and \"Unity\", and banners had quotations like \"All for Each; Each for All\", \"To Each According to Their Needs\", and \"First Right is to Live; First Duty is to Work\". They raised the American flag and played the \"Star Spangled Banner\" and \"America\". They travelled into Corning to watch the Fourth of July parade, but they remained apart from the anglophone Americans. At the end of the day, they returned to Icaria (three miles east) for a banquet, dance, and theatrical presentation. Icarians also celebrated Christmas, New Year's Day, and the ''Fete du Mais'', a fall harvest corn festival similar to Thanksgiving.\n\n=== Women's rights ===\nMen and women were given equal participation opportunities in weekly community assemblies, voting on admissions, constitutional changes, and the election of the officer in charge of clothing and lodging.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |last=Cabet |first=\u00c9tienne |title=Ce que je ferais si j'avais cinq cent mille dollars |publisher=Service Commun de Documentation de l'Universit\u00e9 de Poitiers |location=Poitiers |year=2009 |orig-year=1854 |isbn=9782370760722 |oclc=864436728 |language=fr}}\n*{{cite book |last=Cabet |first=\u00c9tienne |title=Colonie ou r\u00e9publique Icarienne dans les Etats-Unis d'Am\u00e9rique : son histoire |location=Paris |publisher=Chez l'auteur |year=1855 |oclc=85798566  |language=fr}}\n*{{cite book |author=Icarian Community |last2=Cabet |first2=\u00c9tienne |title=Conditions of admission |location=Nauvoo, IL, US |publisher=Icarian Printing Establishment |year=1854 |oclc=54271194}}\n*{{cite book |last=Cabet |first=\u00c9tienne |title=Opinion icarienne sur le mariage : organisation icarienne, naturalisation |location=Paris |publisher=Auteur |year=1855 |id={{OCLC|255287992|457217473|29620127}} |language=fr}}\n*{{cite web |last=Cabet |first=\u00c9tienne |title=Voyage en Icarie : roman philosophique et social |location=Paris |publisher=J.

The Management System (Open Source) states that it leverages [[Evidence-based practice|evidenced based research]], but in reality, all research can fall victim to some of the below effects.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rosenzweig, Philip M.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/896890481|title=The halo effect ... and the eight other business delusions that deceive managers|date=2014|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-1-4767-8403-8|oclc=896890481}}</ref>\n\n# ''The Halo Effect:'' the [[Halo effect|cognitive bias]] in which the perception of one quality is contaminated by a more readily available quality (for example good-looking people being rated as more intelligent).In the context of business, observers think they are making judgements of a company's customer-focus, quality of leadership or other virtues, but their judgement is contaminated by indicators of company performance such as [[share price]] or [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]]. [[Correlations]] of, for example, customer-focus with business success then become meaningless, because success was the basis for the measure of customer focus.\n# ''The Delusion of Correlation and Causality:'' mistakenly thinking that [[Correlation is not causation|correlation is causation]].\n# ''The Delusion of Single Explanations:'' arguments that factor X improves performance by 40% and factor Y improves by another 40%, so both at once will result in an 80% improvement. The fallacy is that X and Y might be very strongly correlated. E.g. X might improve performance by causing Y.\n# ''The Delusion of Connecting the Winning Dots:'' looking only at successful companies and finding their common features, without comparing them against unsuccessful companies.\n# ''The Delusion of Rigorous Research:'' Some authors boast of the amount of data that they have collected, as though that in itself made the conclusions of the research valid.\n# ''The Delusion of Lasting Success:'' the \"secrets of success\" books imply that lasting success is achievable, if only managers will follow their recommended approach. Rosenzweig argues that truly lasting success (outperforming the market for more than a generation) never happens in business.\n# ''The Delusion of Absolute Performance:'' market performance is down to what competitors do as well as what the company itself does. A company can do everything right and yet still fall behind.\n# ''The Delusion of the Wrong End of the Stick:'' getting cause the wrong way round. E.g. successful companies have a Corporate Social Responsibility policy.
