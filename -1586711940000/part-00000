DC Comics</ref>\n\n====Alternate versions of Black Bison====\nBlack Bison appears in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''{{'}}s prequel comic series.\n\n====Black Bison in other media====\nA female version of Black Bison named '''Mina Chaytan''' appears in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', played by Chelsea Kurtz. She gained her power from being on the bus that was hit by dark matter when the Flash escapes the Speed Force due to the [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]]'s plans and begins targeting collectors of Native American artifacts. She was defeated by Team Flash and remanded to Iron Heights Penitentiary. In the episode \"True Colors\", [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Black Bison|Black Bison]] is among the metahuman inmates at Iron Heights Penitentiary that Warden Wolfe planned to sell to Blacksmith. When Warden Wolfe outs Barry's true identity to Blacksmith, [[Dwarfstar]], [[Hazard (DC Comics)|Hazard]], [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Kilg%re|Kilg%re]] and Black Bison, they prepare to attack, only for the Thinker to arrive and absorb the powers of the four metahumans while killing them.\n\n===Blackout===\n{{Comics character list header\n|name = Blackout\n|CBDBid =\n|GCDid = Farooq\n}}\n'''Blackout''' ('''Farooq''') is a [[metahuman]] who can harness [[electricity]]. He makes his first appearance in ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' (vol. 2) #1 (July 2011). In the alternate timeline created by the events of Flashpoint, Blackout is recruited by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] into a team of superheroes whose mission was to end the Amazon-Atlantean war, which had devastated Europe and caused millions of human casualties. To that end, the team was assigned to take down both [[Aquaman|Emperor Aquaman]] and [[Wonder Woman]].\n\nAnother new recruit, the [[Outsider (comics)|Outsider]], revealed during a meeting with [[Batman]] that he had been hunting Blackout so he could use his abilities to power India. This manhunt resulted in the loss of Blackout's girlfriend and his departure from school. Blackout has since voiced his reluctance to be part of the same team with his worst enemy.\n\n====Blackout in other media====\n'''Farooq Gibran'''/Blackout appears in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', portrayed by actor [[Michael Reventar]]. One time Farooq Gibran was out with friends when the [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] particle accelerator exploded and electrocuted him. He survives and later finds out he has the ability to siphon electrical energy. In the episode \"Power Outage\", he decides to take out revenge on [[Eobard Thawne|Harrison Wells]] for the particle accelerator's activation. He is confronted by the Flash and drains the speedster's speed. He later attacks S.T.A.R. Labs, kills Girder and attacks Wells. However, the Flash was able to get the speed back and kill him. Blackout was mentioned by Barry Allen in the ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' episode \"[[Worlds Finest]]\".\n\n===Blackrock===\n'''Blackrock''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. Blackrock is a recurring enemy of [[Superman]] first appearing in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #458 (April 1976).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=32-33}}</ref>\n\nBlackrock was the creation of '''Dr. Peter Silverstone''' in an attempt to increase ratings for the United Broadcasting [[television network]]. Silverstone hypnotized UB President Sam Tanner and later Tanner's nephew, Les Vegas, to fill the role. A third Blackrock (an energy construct) was created by Tanner's command not much later.\n\nHowever, it is known that eventually Silverstone assumed the mantle of Blackrock himself, using a powerful stone that could metabolize electromagnetic energy into energy to achieve flight, energy blasts and superhuman strength, and fought Superman several times. This rock, while a technological artifact, has the appearance of a polished [[Gemstone|gem]] that is as black as [[coal]]. It was appropriately dubbed the Blackrock.\n\nThe Post-''Crisis'' version was stated (in ''Batman/Superman'' adventures) to be a symbiotic alien life form, rather than a creation of Dr. Silverstone. Its appearance and abilities are approximately the same.\n\nSilverstone is the only Pre-''Crisis'' user of the stone that has been mentioned in Post-''Crisis'' continuity. Overuse of the Blackrock's powers blinded Silverstone and left him insane. He was found sitting muttering to himself and watching constant television shows in an apartment owned by an ex-convict named '''Samuel Benjamin''', who beat Silverstone to death with the Blackrock and took it for himself. Despite its power, his inexperience with the Blackrock led to his defeat and Superman took the stone and threw it towards the Sun.<ref>''Superman'' #218 (August 2005)</ref>\n\nA short time later, [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]], disguised as [[Lex Luthor]], dispatched [[Bizarro]] to retrieve the Blackrock from the Sun<ref>''Superman'' #222 (December 2005)</ref> before passing it on to a South American woman named '''Lucia''',<ref>''Superman'' #223 (January 2006)</ref> a drug smuggler and revolutionary who had been jailed by Superman before. Her intense feelings of hatred towards the Man of Steel matched those of the Blackrock and she proved particularly adept in using it. However, her skills were not enough to defeat Superman and the Blackrock withdrew into itself.<ref>''Superman'' #224 (February 2006)</ref>\n\nIt was eventually shown that the Blackrock had been kept by Superman, who eventually locked it away in his Fortress of Solitude. The Blackrock eventually escaped and bonded with [[Plastic Man]]. Shortly after, the Blackrock was removed from Plastic Man and found its way into the hands of [[Batman]], who shortly afterwards decided he needed its powers to help him stop a currently-rampaging Superman (Superman had fallen under the influence of [[Despero]] as he attempted to turn Earth's alien heroes against humans). Although it remained on Batman after Superman threw off Despero's influence, Superman was able to force it to leave Batman by threatening to kill him, informing the Blackrock that he knew Batman would rather die than live like this.\n\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Blackrock is '''Bradley Glenn''', an ex-con who was hired to star in a [[reality television]] show called ''Badass Nation'' about the life of a supervillain.<ref>''Superman: Lois and Clark'' #5 (April 2016)</ref> The TV company provided him with powered armor and a fictional backstory about finding it in a crashed spacecraft. They intended to film him tearing up a bridge that was scheduled for demolition, but the crew neglected to ensure that the bridge had been closed to traffic and the Pre-''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' Superman had to intervene.<ref>''Superman: Lois and Clark'' #6 (May 2016)</ref>\n\nThe Post-''Crisis'' wielders of the Blackrock seem to have developed differing powers based on their personalities. All seem to have possessed superhuman strength and endurance, flight and energy projection abilities. The Blackrock also has the ability to absorb ambient energy to empower its wielder. Dr. Silverstone seemed most adept at using its ability to process information from TV and radio signals. Samuel Benjamin was particularly skilled at using it to boost his own physical strength and toughness. Lucia's abilities seemed to be an amalgamation of her predecessors', but she seemed to prefer using its energy projection abilities and discovered a way to use it to drain Superman's power.\n\nWhile the stone had bonded to [[Plastic Man]], he was not shown using its abilities much.\n\n[[Batman]] used it in much the same way that Lucia did; however, Batman showed more of a preference for physical combat than Lucia did.\n\n[[Jimmy Olsen]] and several other humans were bonded to the Blackrocks when a shower of them rained down on Earth. These people showed some level of superhuman abilities similar to those demonstrated by Lucia, etc. but it was not shown if they were as strong as he was.\n\nBradley Glenn's armor enabled him to leap great distances and an energy field around one gauntlet gave him a powerful punch.\n\n===Blackwing===\n'''Blackwing''' ('''Charles \"Charlie\" Bullock''') is a fictional [[superhero]] from [[DC Comics]]. He was created by Paul Levitz, Joe Staton and Joey Cavalieri.\n\nThe character was chronologically introduced in ''Adventure Comics'' #464 (April 1979), but was unnamed in that comic. He was, however, named in his next appearance in ''Wonder Woman'' #281 (April 1981) and later, became Blackwing in ''Wonder Woman'' #297 (August 1982). Also, worth to note, the original story in ''Adventure Comics'' was intended for ''All Star Comics'' #75. Charlie was drawn as a teen in that story, but his next appearance (only three years later) depicts him as a young adult who graduated from law school.\n\nIn his mid-teens, Charles Bullock was searching for a direction in life. The teenager found it after he helped fight off street punks alongside Wildcat (Ted Grant) and was invited to join him at his gym. Charlie attended law school and later became a junior partner and top-notch researcher to the law firm called Cranston, Grayson and Wayne. When a criminal named Karnage broke into the office looking for his boss, Arthur Cranston, this, and another event, led him to become the costumed hero Blackwing. Although his first outing as a crime fighter proved unsuccessful when he was captured by the costumed villain Boa's gang, Blackwing managed to contribute in freeing the [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)]] from Boa's giant snake and recorded some evidence that was used to put the mastermind and his men away.\n\nSince then, Blackwing has never appeared again in any other published story.\n\n===Vera Black===\n{{Comics character list header\n|name = Vera Black\n|CBDBid = 2534\n}}\n'''Vera Black''' is a British psionic cyborg in the [[DC Universe]].\n\nThe character, created by [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]] and [[Doug Mahnke]], first appeared in ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #100 (August 2004).<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/208041/\n|title=JLA #100\n|publisher=The Grand Comics Database\n|accessdate=2012-05-29\n}}</ref> The storyline set up the limited series ''[[Justice League Elite]]'' which consisted of 12 issues published between 2004\u20132005.\n\nWithin the context of the stories, Vera Black is the sister of [[Manchester Black]]. As children their parents would often fight and Manchester would take her out to play to avoid them. As his idea of \"play\" became killing sprees, Vera's perspective became twisted.{{issue|date=May 2012}} When her brother dies after attempting to destroy [[Superman]], she has her ruined arms, lost in an untold childhood incident, replaced with cybernetic prostheses which can configure into any weapon she desires, initially contemplating revenge on Superman before she decides to be better than her brother.\n\nHer new abilities result in her leading the remnants of the [[The Elite (DC Comics)|Elite]] and tacitly working with the [[Justice League]]. This leads to the League, encouraged by the [[Wally West|Flash]], asking her to lead a new team with the intention that she will handle [[black ops]] missions that the League cannot due to what they represent to the public, primarily involving hunting down and eliminating metahuman threats before they go public. Starting with [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Coldcast|Coldcast]] and [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Menagerie|Menagerie]], she adds Flash, [[Manitou Raven]], [[Major Disaster]], [[Green Arrow]] and [[Cassandra Cain|Kasumi]] to the team. She also enlists [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Naif al-Sheikh|Naif al-Sheikh]] to keep the team in check and serve as a liaison to the governments of the world.\n\n====Equipment of Vera Black====\nVera's cybernetic arms have the capacity to transform into an almost unlimited variety of melee, projectile and beam weapons. They also incorporate camouflage technology relying on optics, as well as altering sense perception in others.\n\n====Vera Black in other media====\nVera Black appears in the direct-to-DVD animated feature ''[[Superman vs. The Elite]]'', voiced by [[Marcella Lentz-Pope]] as an adult and by [[Tara Strong]] as a girl in a flashback sequence.\n\n===Block===\n'''Block''' is a young Maori woman living in Melbourne, Australia, the woman dubbed the '''Human Block''' was once inexplicably struck by lightning and survived the incident. Unknown to her, this similar event had happened to many other individuals throughout time and was in fact the Speed Force imbuing her with speed-related abilities. In her then-present time\u20141957\u2014Block acted as a side show attraction in a carnival, the prize of $1,000 going to whoever could move her, which was failed by many, as she had manipulated her body density. One drunken man staggered onto the stage to accept her challenge, making her move by insulting her Maori heritage rather than physically moving her. Angered, she immediately struck out at him and instigated a small brawl, tearing through the crowd before someone hastily drew their firearm on her and shot, only to find that not even bullets affected her. Before the now-turned mob could attack her, Zoom, accompanied by his newly recruited acolytes the Folded Man and Magali, appeared and teleported her outside of the carnival grounds. Being offered the chance to embrace her abilities and live as a godlike being after mastering them, she did not hesitate to join Zoom and his quest to kill the \"evil\" Flash. Along with the other Acolytes, she would train for what would be an unknown amount of time to kill the Flash, facing off with Zoom in his place. It is unknown how long this training took place, as they stated that, over the course of centuries, this team trained to take on the Flash and when they reached older age, Magali would revert them back to their original ages when joining. Unknown to Block, Zoom is actually the one to have orchestrated her joining him to begin with, appearing to the drunk man who challenged her, while convincing him that the way to make her move was to attack her heritage, as he had been keeping close watch on her for some time.\n\n====Powers and abilities of Block====\nBeing imbued with the Speed Force, Block has the unique ability to slow down her atoms. In doing this, they become denser than steel and grant her invulnerability, super-strength and immobility. She can possibly slow down other speedsters, if not other people as well, through physical touch, as she stopped the Top's ability to spin and was able to hold Zoom in place in a headlock. After training centuries with Zoom, she is a deadly fighter. Recently, she was able to stop the molecules around herself to make the air unbreakable.\n\n====Block in other media====\nBlock appears in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' season 5 episode \"Blocked\" portrayed by [[Erin Cummings]]. '''Vanessa Jansen''', nicknamed \"Block\" by [[Cisco Ramon]], was a [[metahuman]] weapons dealer working for the East Street Skulls gang. Vanessa Jansen worked as a weapons dealer for the East Street Skulls gang, but was betrayed. She was subsequently arrested and sent to [[Iron Heights]] for four years. Through unknown means, Jansen acquired metahuman powers, which allowed her to create boxes of dense air. When Jansen got out of Iron Heights, either by escape or release, she took revenge on Bobby Moretti and killed him with her metahuman powers. She then robbed Bobby's warehouse of guns, planning to sell them. However, the buyer turned out to be Bobby's older brother, Bruno Moretti. He attempted to kill her out of revenge for Bobby's death, only for Jansen to save herself with her powers. She then tried to save Bruno, but was stopped by [[XS (comics)|XS]], who saved him instead. XS then tried to capture her, but Jansen trapped her in a block of dense air, causing the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] to come out and confront her. Jansen threw XS into the air, forcing the Flash to save her, allowing Jansen to escape. Later, Jansen attempted to sell the weapons again, but was once again confronted by Bruni. Bruni arrived with backup, threatening to kill Jansen if she did not return the guns. They opened fire on her, but she shielded herself from the bullets using her powers. The Flash and XS took out the weapon dealers and confronted her again. The Flash repeatedly sped around as Jansen tried to hit him, eventually tiring her out. Jansen was able to trap him in a block while he was distracted and caused it to start shrinking. However, XS battled Jansen, tiring her out once again. XS then used the opportunity to put Jansen in power-dampening handcuffs. Suddenly, when Elongated Man and Vibe arrived to help arrest her, Cicada's dagger pierced through Jansen's chest. XS sped her to the hospital, but Jansen died of her injuries on the way there.\n\n===Billy Numerous===\n'''Billy Numerous''' (voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]) was specifically created for the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series and did not have a previous appearance in the mainstream comics. However, he has since made the jump to these with his first appearance in the DC Universe in ''[[Catwoman]]'' #78 (April 2008), now known as '''Repro'''.\n\nBilly Numerous (real name '''William \"Billy\" Strayer''') is a former student of the [[H.I.V.E.]] Academy and an enemy of the [[Teen Titans]]. Numerous first appeared as a student of the H.I.V.E Academy, where his power of self-duplication was subtly hinted at. After the H.I.V.E. was destroyed during [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]'s confrontation with [[Brother Blood]], Numerous and most of the other students went freelance. Later, Numerous engaged in a robbing spree all across Jump City and he stole anything he and his innumerable clones could get his (their) collective hands on. His power thoroughly confounded the Titans, especially Cyborg, who became all the more obsessed in catching him. Finally, however, Cyborg realized that there was another way of catching Numerous. He and the other Titans confronted Numerous in the old stadium where he had stashed his loot, seemingly with numerous copies of themselves. In order to bring them down, Numerous created even more clones of himself, but finally pushed his powers too far. The resulting reabsorption of each of his clones caused a massive physical and mental shock, stunning him and enabling his capture. To add insult to injury, the Titans' copies were not actual clones, but merely holographic projections created and controlled by Cyborg.\n\nAt some point, Numerous entered [[Jinx (comics)|Jinx]]'s H.I.V.E. Five and was also recruited into the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. As one of the Five, he participated in the attempted capture of [[Kid Flash]], but even his numerous clones were unable to stop the super-speedster. Later, when the Brotherhood executed its worldwide strike against young superheroes, he and [[Gizmo (DC Comics)|Gizmo]] were sent to capture Kole and Gnarrk in their subterranean retreat, but both heroes escaped them. When the remnants of the Titans under [[Beast Boy]] later attacked the Brotherhood's headquarters, Numerous and most of his H.I.V.E. Five teammates tried to run, but were intercepted by Kid Flash\u2014and aghast to see that Jinx had switched sides and joined up with him. Moments later, they were all swept away by one of Jinx's hexes and carted off by Kid Flash for flash-freeze treatment.\n \nIn ''[[Catwoman]]'' #78 (April 2008), a character based on Billy Numerous named '''Repro''' appears. The small-time crook known as Repro was operating in [[Gotham City]] during the time when many of the city's criminals disappeared for a short time. He was one of the only two criminals left in the city, with the other being the Thief. Repro was a young and inexperienced criminal who only did small-time criminal activities, just enough to stay off the radar of big-time crime fighters. After a confrontation with Catwoman where he thought he had shot her in the chest, he hastily departed and ran to the Thief to tell him about it. He was, in turn, shot in the chest and killed by the Thief, who then dumped his body in an alley to cover up the murder.\n\n====Billy Numerous in other media====\n* Billy Numerous appears in the ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' tie-in comics. He appears as a background villain and member of the H.I.V.E. Five in this comic adaptation of the animated television series. He engages in various petty crimes and attempts at one point to join a new iteration of the team being organised by Psimon and Dr. Light. He fails the test, along with dozens of other villains.\n* Billy Numerous appears in ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' as a minor supporting villain in several episodes throughout the series, typically in association with other H.I.V.E. Five members. He makes his first appearance in the episode \"Super Robin\". He is voiced by [[Scott Menville]] and also appears in the series' tie-in comics.\n\n===Bolphunga===\n{{Comics character list header\n|name = Bolphunga\n|CBDBid = 13140\n|GCDid = Bolphunga\n}}\n'''Bolphunga''' is an extraterrestrial bounty hunter in the [[DC Universe]].\n\nThe character, created by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]], first appeared in ''[[Green Lantern (comic book)|Green Lantern]]'' (vol. 2) #188 (May 1985).<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/39966/\n|title=Green Lantern #188\n|publisher=The Grand Comics Database\n|accessdate=2012-05-30\n}}</ref>\n\nWithin the context of the stories, Bolphunga the Unrelenting has a love of destruction and plots to make a name for himself by challenging the most feared and mysterious beings in creation, fixating on [[Green Lantern]]s.

Condiment King first appeared where he attacked a rooftop restaurant to rob it, only to end up fighting Batman.

They removed his mask, revealing him to be a stand-up comedian named '''Buddy Standler'''. Batman and Alfred Pennyworth watched the news, where it was mentioned that a hospitalized Buddy Standler had no memory of the restaurant attack and that the restaurant is suing the TV studio where Buddy Standler's TV show is broadcast for the damages that Condiment King did to the restaurant. Batman discovered that Buddy Standler was brainwashed by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] (using the [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]]'s devices), whom he and fellow comedians Harry Loomis (who Joker brainwashed into being Pack Rat) and Lisa Lorraine (who Joker brainwashed into being Mighty Mom) had unwittingly spurned the previous year at a comedian contest.

Damien returns in season two as a recurring character, one of the two secondary antagonists alongside Malcolm Merlyn and a member of the [[Legion of Doom]]. He also serves as an archenemy to [[Sara Lance]], Laurel Lance's sister and the Legends' leader. Although initially hesitant to work with [[Eobard Thawne]], he quickly joins forces upon learning of his future death and the failure of his plans from Sara. Together with Eobard, his future/former accomplice the Dark Archer and the rest of the Legion of Doom, he works to find the fabled [[Holy Lance|Spear of Destiny]] in order to change his fate. After they succeed, Damien makes himself mayor of Star City and regains his magical artifact. However, the Legends manage to travel back in time to stop the Legion's success. Eobard also travels back to warn the past Legion, so Damien sets out with the Legion to stop the Legends in a final battle. Using swords and a futuristic gun courtesy of Eobard, Damien eventually kills the future counterpart of [[Citizen Steel]] before engaging in hand-to-hand combat with Sara. Sara manages to overpower him and knock him out. After the Legion is defeated, the Legends return each member of the Legion to their respective place in the timeline and wipe their memories of time travel, so Damien ends up dying in 2016 as before. In season three, Damien is the secondary antagonist and is resurrected from his death by his time-displaced daughter Nora Darhk with his memories restored and resumes his feud with Sara, the Legends and their allies. He later encounters [[Gorilla Grodd]] upon saving him from the napalm bombing during the [[Vietnam War]] and claims to have time traveling technology that will let Grodd time travel at will. It is revealed that his alliance with Mallus is intended to ensure Mallus' release from his prison dimension by causing temporal aberrations that will weaken it, but this effort is complicated when tension arises between Damien and his daughter over their differing approaches to their relationship. Damien, after being convinced by Steel and the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] that his daughter will cease to exist if Mallus is set free, decides to help the Legends stop Mallus from taking Nora's body, but ends up taking Nora's place and is killed by Mallus in the season three finale. In season five, Astra Logue grants Damien a second chance at life. He was supposed cause misery, but instead went to go see Nora. She had to hide the fact of her current status by stating that Constantine is her husband and that Sara and Ava are now her henchmen. Everything unraveled when the ring that Ray placed in a chocolate mousse. Nora's latest charge wishes them all into an episode of ''Mr. Parker's Cul-De-Sac'' (a parody of ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'') where they all worked out their issues in the most unlikeliest of ways. Afterwards, Damien allows Nora to marry Ray. After talking to Sara what Astra wanted him to do, Damien briefly borrowed the Hellsword previously used by [[Genghis Khan]] and stabbed himself.\n\n===Dex-Starr===\n'''Dex-Starr''' is an abandoned stray blue [[Cat|domestic cat]] from Earth, adopted by a woman in Brooklyn who names him Dexter. During a break-in, Dex-Starr scratched the burglar before his owner was killed and he was evicted by the police. Homeless, he was grabbed by two street thugs and thrown off the Brooklyn Bridge, but the rage that he felt caught the attention of a [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Red|red power ring]] and it came to him before he hit the water. As a member of the [[Red Lantern Corps]], wearing his red power ring around his tail, he killed the two thugs and slept on their skulls, proclaiming himself to be a \"good kitty\" using thoughts expressed in simple sentences. He was described by [[Geoff Johns]] in an interview with ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' as \"the most sadistic and malicious\" of the Red Lanterns. Originally intended as a joke by Shane Davis, he began being featured more prominently due to positive reception. Dex-Starr frequently travels with Atrocitus, with his vengeful quest centering on finding the burglar that murdered his owner. Dex-Starr gained the ability to create constructs after drinking the blood of Rankorr and, unbeknownst to his fellow Red Lanterns, he used his newfound ability to save [[Atrocitus]] from certain death after the former leader of the Red Lanterns saw his red power ring being taken by [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0}}</ref>{{rp|89}}\n\n====Dex-Starr in other media====\n* Dex-Starr appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]''.

Operating from London, England, Dodger will steal and/or sell anything from information to advanced technology.\n\nAt one point he came into possession of what appeared to be an alien spacecraft. Recognizing that the vehicle's stealth capabilities made it a lucrative commodity, he began leasing the vessel to various underworld figures, including the [[League of Assassins]]. When the vessel in question was linked to an assassination attempt against [[Green Arrow (Connor Hawke)|Connor Hawke]], the [[Green Arrow]] and the [[Black Canary]] began investigating its activity. The trail led them to London where they (along with [[Speedy (Mia Dearden)|Mia \"Speedy\" Dearden]]) engaged in combat with Dodger at a local pub. Although Dodger proved to be an able-bodied physical combatant, \"Team Arrow\" subdued him and he told them about the League of Assassins.\n\nWhen pressed for more information, Dodger was unwilling to cooperate, so the Green Arrow and the Black Canary dropped him from the belly of a cargo plane suspended by a bungee cord until he agreed to give them better intelligence. He took them to his secret lair and triangulated the last location of the stealth ship he had leased.\n\nThe Green Arrow and the Black Canary then persuaded him to accompany them on the search, which brought them to a castle in Leichestershire, England. They evaded several traps and finally discovered a cryogenics tube containing the compressed form of former Justice Leaguer [[Plastic Man]].\n\nDodger continued to work alongside \"Team Arrow\" and fought a team of metahumans who claimed to represent the League of Assassins. Dodger contributed very little to the battle; however, he did manage to distract one of them long enough for [[Batman]] to subdue him. Dodger continued adventuring with the group, battled foes and completed the adventure along with the team.\n\nAfter settling their business with the League of Assassins, Dodger accompanied \"Team Arrow\" back to the United States, where he struck up a romantic relationship with Mia Dearden. Mia has now left the States and traveled to London to continue this relationship.\n\n====Dodger in other media====\nDodger appears in the TV series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' portrayed by [[James Callis]]. Appearing in the 15th episode \"Dodger,\" he is a British jewel thief who robs valuable jewels from wealthy occupants and sells them at a high price. Unlike the comics, this iteration of the character uses hostages with bomb collars to steal for him, rather than alien technology. He also uses a high voltage stun-stick as a weapon, which renders victims unconscious. His real name is '''Winnick Norton''', a reference to the original creators of the character, [[Judd Winick]] and [[Mike Norton]]. He is defeated by Oliver and John Diggle when he is taken out with his own \"shocker\" after Oliver causes his car to crash, using an arrow as a dagger, and is arrested by a SCPD unit afterwards. In the ''Arrow: Season 2.5'' tie-in comic, Norton escapes from prison and begins operating out of Bludhaven as part of a mercenary group called the Renegades. He and other members kidnap [[Felicity Smoak]] on the orders of [[Brother Blood|Clinton Hogue]], reminiscent how he kidnapped her earlier in \"Dodger\". Norton and other members are defeated by Oliver Queen, [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy Harper]] and [[Huntress (comics)|Helena Bertinelli]], leaving them bound and tipping off the police so they could arrest them.\n\n===Dominus===\n{{For|the [[Marvel Comics]] villain|Dominus (Marvel Comics)}}\n'''Dominus''' is a [[fictional character]] and a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] who first appeared in ''Action Comics'' #747.

During this time, he fell in love with his peer, Ahti. However, he was driven mad by jealousy when Ahti ascended past him and assumed the mantle of Kismet, Illuminator of All Realities.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nStudying infernal forbidden magic in an attempt to gain the power to challenge his former lover and rob her of the power of Kismet, Tuoni's assault was reflected by Kismet's divine energies and his body was incinerated. Despite Tuoni's deceit, the [[omnibenevolent]] Kismet showed him mercy and shunted his shattered, still-living body into the [[Phantom Zone]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nWithin the [[Phantom Zone]], Tuoni encountered a holographic projection of [[Superman]]'s long-dead [[Kryptonian]] ancestor, Kem-L, who was able to use his own ancient variety of [[arcane]] [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] science to rebuild the former holy man as a [[psionic]], cosmic phantasm known as \"Dominus\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=75-76}}</ref>\n\nIn this new all-powerful form, Dominus escaped the Zone via Superman's [[Fortress of Solitude]] and attacked [[Earth]]. Attempting to find Kismet to steal her cosmic powers, he was opposed by Superman. Swearing vengeance, Dominus [[telepathy|telepathically]] entered Superman's mind and preyed on one of the Man of Steel's greatest weaknesses; his fear of failing the people of [[Earth]].\n\nUsing [[mind control]], Dominus convinced Superman to take control of Earth and build the [[Superman robots]] to police the planet 24 hours a day, seven days a week forever. In another battle, Dominus used his reality-warping powers to become Superman, using the Superman robots to search for Kismet while Superman was disguised as one of his own robots and later as Dominus.\n\nDuring his captivity in these other forms Superman improved on his use of ''Torquasm Vo'', an ancient Kryptonian warrior discipline technique where the warrior can control what they think. Superman and Dominus then engaged in a mental-physical battle with Dominus using any stray thought of Superman to reshape reality. The battle ends with Superman banishing Dominus to the [[Phantom Zone]].\n\nDominus uses his \"Continuum Control\" to alter reality and his \"Control\" to make people unaware that the change occurred. He can actually create more than one simultaneous reality, each one attacking a specific character's mental attributes. Dominus' realities were also inspired by other times in Superman's publishing history (the 1940s, 1960s and 1970s) and \"The Superman of 2965\u20132966\" story involving Muto.<ref>''Superman'' #181 (Nov. 1965)</ref><ref>''Action Comics'' #338\u2013339 (June\u2013July 1966)</ref>\n\n====Dominus behind the scenes====\nIn a 1981 DC Treasury Special called ''Superman and his Fortress of Solitude'', the Pre-''Crisis'' [[Lex Luthor]] posed as a red-armored alien named Dominus as part of an elaborate ruse aimed at destroying the Man of Steel.\n\n===Dreadnought===\nThe '''Dreadnought''' is a fictional character in [[DC Comics]] appearing in ''[[The New 52]]'' continuity. He serves as an agent of the [[H.I.V.E.]], along with [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Psiphon|Psiphon]]. He appears in ''Superboy'' (vol. 4) #20, where he is sent by the H.I.V.E. to [[New York City]] to apprehend [[Doctor Psycho]], who had escaped from a H.I.V.E. facility, and [[Superboy]], whose psionic powers were of interest to the H.I.V.E. The two characters teamed up and managed to defeat the H.I.V.E. soldiers. The Dreadnought was sent flying by Superboy and landed in the [[Hudson River]].\n\nThe Dreadnought has undergone genetic modifications by the H.I.V.E. that mutated him into a giant purple humanoid beast with metallic armor and large black horns protruding from his head. He has superhuman strength and durability, which enables him to hold his own against even Superboy.\n\n===Carl Draper===\n'''Carl Draper''' is a fictional character in [[DC Comics]], an enemy of [[Superman]]. He has gone by the names the '''Master Jailer''', '''Kator''', '''Deathtrap''', the '''Locksmith''' and '''Castellan'''. Draper made his first appearance in ''Superman'' #331 (Jan. 1979), written by [[Martin Pasko]] and drawn by [[Curt Swan]] and [[Frank Chiaramonte]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.supermanartists.comics.org/superwhoswho/Superframe.htm |title=supermanwho |publisher=Supermanartists.comics.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232751/http://www.supermanartists.comics.org/superwhoswho/Superframe.htm |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn the Pre-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' comics, '''Carl \"Moosie\" Draper''' grew up in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] (see ''Kator'' below). Draper was an overweight clumsy teenager whom most of the other kids never noticed or made fun of and was in love with [[Lana Lang]], who had eyes only for [[Superboy]], much to Draper's resentment. As an adult, Draper underwent a self-imposed self-improvement regimen, including exercise and cosmetic surgery, to overcome his physical shortcomings. He became an expert locksmith and architect, designing an inescapable prison for supervillains called \"Mount Olympus\". Impressed by the achievement, Superman augmented the prison's security by placing it on an antigravity platform. Initially dubbed \"Draper's Island\" by Superman, it was informally renamed \"Superman Island\" by the adult Lana\u2014with whom Draper remained smitten, just as she remained lovestruck by Superman. It was the latter name, plus the novelty of the floating platform, that caught public attention, diverting recognition from Draper himself. This proved the final straw for Draper, who snapped and became the costumed supervillain the '''Master Jailer'''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=238-239}}</ref> He attacked Superman and kidnapped Lana under that name.

Kator, however, developed an [[artificial intelligence]] and almost killed the Boy of Steel before being destroyed (in ''New Adventures of Superboy'' #18). However, the robot apparently gave Draper its identity and powers before being destroyed. Draper (as the new Kator) then engages Superboy in combat. However, Jonathan Kent presses the safety switch on the \"cutoff\" device, which removes \"Kator's\" superpowers from Draper, and Superboy removes the memory of Draper ever being Kator.<ref>{{cite web|author=DarkMark |url=http://darkmark6.tripod.com/superboyind3.htm |title=Superboy index, part 3 |publisher=Darkmark6.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://obscure.dcuguide.com/m.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520042837/http://obscure.dcuguide.com/m.htm |archivedate=2006-05-20 }}</ref>\n\nIn the Post-''Crisis'' comics, Carl Draper first appeared in ''Adventures of Superman'' #517 (Nov. 1994). This was during the \"Dead Again\" storyline, when Superman was suspected of being an impostor after his body was found still in his tomb (from ''[[The Death of Superman]]'' storyline). Draper was hired by [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] to design a holding cell for [[Conduit (comics)|Conduit]], when his daughter, Carla, asked him if he could build a prison that could hold even Superman. Draper initially designed a trap that only the real Superman could escape from, explaining this to Superman by way of a hologram of a costumed figure named '''Deathtrap'''. However, when Superman escaped the trap, Draper became obsessed with proving that he ''could'' capture the real thing. Of note, this version of Draper was dressed in casual wear, only getting an updated costume with chain-based attacks later.\n\nDraper made several other attempts to capture Superman, often programming the Deathtrap hologram in advance so he could publicly be elsewhere. On one occasion, in ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel]]'' #43 (April 1995), he programmed Deathtrap to appear during a Draper Security press conference and display how Draper's devices were being \"subverted\", thus both removing suspicion from him and acting as an advertisement for the company.\n\nIn ''Action Comics'' #739, Superman (in his blue energy form) was captured in an \"energy hobble\" by Deathtrap, now calling himself the '''Locksmith'''. At the end of the story, it was revealed to the reader that his daughter, Carla Draper, was running the hologram this time and that her father was unaware of this. The now costumed-Master Jailer was one of the villains along with [[Neutron (comics)|Neutron]] controlled by [[Manchester Black]] in the 2002 storyline \"Ending Battle\"; however, it was not clear that it was, in fact, Draper.\n\nCarl Draper appears in ''[[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]'' #17 (Oct. 2007). At some point, Checkmate discovered his multiple identities and used this to force him into becoming a security consultant, protecting Checkmate itself from attack. In the issue, he prevents numerous assaults on Checkmate headquarters and is promoted to head of security with the title '''Castellan'''. Although he has not told his superiors, he strongly suspects that Carla is involved in the attacks.

The first Hyena debuted in ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'' #4 (September 1978) and was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Al Milgrom]]. The second Hyena debuted in ''[[Firestorm (comics)|The Fury of Firestorm]]'' #10 (March 1983) and was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Pat Broderick]].\n\nBoth werehyenas had problems with authority and resented Firestorm for interfering in their [[Feud|vendettas]]. The unique feature of the Hyenas was that they turned into werehyena forms whenever they were under great emotional stress, not only when there was a [[full moon]]. This meant that they could attack foes in broad daylight and that they would revert into their human forms when their emotional tension was relieved.\n\nThe first Hyena, '''Summer Day''', joined the [[Peace Corps]] as a result of relational issues with her father and was turned into a werehyena as a result of an accident in [[Africa]]. Taking the name the Hyena, Summer returned to America and began attacking both criminals and police officers. A result of her condition is a steadily progressing madness.<ref>As seen in ''Flash'' #304</ref>\n\nThe second Hyena, '''Doctor Jivan Shi''', was a [[psychiatrist]] whom Summer Day had fallen in love with while he was attempting to treat her werehyena condition. One night, as Summer and Jivan were embracing, Summer transformed into the Hyena and infected Jivan with the werehyena curse. Professor Stein noted that being the Hyena seemed to have warped Jivan Shi's mind.<ref>As seen in ''The Fury of Firestorm'' #11</ref> According to ''The Fury of Firestorm'' #10\u201313, the madness suffered by the werehyenas is one's bestial side taking over, coupled with an exaggeration of negative emotions.\n\nIn ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', [[Deadshot]] killed one of the Hyenas after a prison breakout<ref>''[[Villains United]]'' #3</ref> and the other appeared as a member of the [[Injustice League]] in ''[[One Year Later]]'' before being shot and killed by [[Parademon]]s that were attacking the villains' camp.<ref name=\"As seen in Salvation Run #6\">As seen in ''Salvation Run'' #6</ref>\n\nA pack of at least five new werehyenas, presumably suffering from the same curse as Summer and Jivan, were seen in San Francisco some time after the death of their remaining predecessor. They were promptly defeated and permanently returned to human form, thanks to [[Zatanna]], [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] and [[Black Canary]].<ref>''Zatanna'' #2</ref>\n\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the werehyenas are reintroduced as mercenaries who received special drugs that gave superstrength and velocity, with the side effect of a constant laugh.<ref>''The Fury of Firestorm'' #2</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline as part of ''[[The New 52]]'', the Summer Day version of the Hyena appears as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. The Crime Syndicate sent the Hyena with [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Black Bison|Black Bison]], [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Multiplex|Multiplex]], [[Plastique (comics)|Plastique]] and [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Typhoon|Typhoon]] to finish Gorilla Grodd's job. The villains were defeated by the Rogues, since one of the targets was the hospital that was treating Captain Cold's sister.<ref name=\"Rogues 1\"/>\n\n==I==\n===Invisible Hood===\nThe '''Invisible Hood''' is the name of two [[fictional]] [[superhero]]es in the [[DC Universe]].

He first appeared in ''[[Smash Comics]]'' #1 (August 1939), and was created by [[Art Pinajian]]. Pinajian illustrated the story under the pseudonym \"Art Gordon\".\n\nYears after the character was acquired by [[DC Comics]], a [[Retroactive continuity|retroactive]] fictional history was developed.\n\nA modern version of the Invisible Hood debuts in ''Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters'' #5. He assists the group in escaping from [[S.H.A.D.E.]], an evil governmental organization with control of the [[White House]]. In issue #6, it is revealed that he is '''Ken Thurston''', the great-grandson of the original [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Invisible Hood and that he is using the same hood that the original Invisible Hood had used. Uncle Sam had used telepathy to direct Ken to the hood. Later, Ken is killed by the traitorous [[Ray (comics)#Stan Silver|Ray (Stan Silver)]], just as he is about to leave the superhero profession.<ref>''Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters'' #7 (May 1, 2008)</ref>\n\n====Equipment of Invisible Hood====\nBoth Kent and Ken Thurston have no superpowers, but they wear a chemically treated hood and cloak that grants them invisibility.\n\n===Isis (Selina Kyle's cat)===\nCreators: Sean Catherine Derek, Laren Bright, Jules Dennis and Richard Mueller. First appearance: ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'': \"The Cat and the Claw: Part I\" (September 1992). Abilities: Stealth.\n\n'''Isis''' is [[Selina Kyle]]'s pet cat. She often used Isis to reach narrow places and to retrieve valuable objects without the need of doing so herself. When Selina was taken to prison, Isis ran away looking for her. Isis got lost and was found on the streets by [[Doctor Milo]], who used the cat for one of his twisted experiments. Selina found Isis, but the cat had been infected with a virus that made her more aggressive and contagious to people. Selina feared she had lost Isis forever, but [[Batman]] delivered Isis back to her, completely cured and safe. Isis was voiced by [[Frank Welker]] for most of the character's appearances. She was voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]] for the animated web series ''[[Gotham Girls]]''.\n\n====Isis in other media====\n* Isis appears in ''[[Krypto the Superdog]]'', voiced by [[Kathleen Barr]].

When he and his gang members invaded the gymnasium of Garfield High School and attacked Jefferson Pierce, Earl Clifford came to his defense and helped to fight them off. [[Tobias Whale]] hears of what happened and orders Toledo to make an example out of Earl. Joey Toledo led his men into attacking Earl, where the altercation led to Earl getting struck by a car. Joey then had his goons suspend his dead body from the basketball net in the gymnasium. With help from [[Peter Gambi]], Jefferson Pierce becomes Black Lightning, where he beats up Joey Toledo's men. Afterwards, Black Lightning grabs Joey and pressures him to tell him everything there is to know about the 100. He tells him to meet him at Garfield High's gymnasium at midnight.

He is killed by a disguised Peter Gambi during his raid to make it look like [[#Lady Eve|Lady Eve]] ordered the hit.\n\n==K==\n===Adeline Kane===\n'''Adeline Kane''', formerly '''Adeline Wilson''', is best known as both the leader of the criminal organization the [[H.I.V.E.]] and the ex-wife of Slade Wilson, a.k.a. [[Deathstroke|Deathstroke the Terminator]]. An enemy of the [[Teen Titans]], Adeline makes her first appearance in ''New Teen Titans'' #34 (August 1983). She was brought up as a wealthy jet-setting playgirl, despite being trained by a father who had worked with Chinese guerrilla forces. But, after a traumatic first marriage at 19, she joined the U.S. military, where she met, trained, and married Slade Wilson. After Slade left the military, Slade and Adeline took up the socialite lifestyle Adeline had been raised into.\n\nUnbeknownst to her, Slade was using his hunting trips to gain clients for his mercenary side job, which resulted in the kidnapping and near-death of their younger son, [[Jericho (comics)|Joseph]]. Enraged and betrayed by Slade's prioritization of Deathstroke's honor code over their son's well-being, Adeline shot her husband and, when he survived, served him with divorce papers.\n\nGrant, who had idolized his father, rebelled against his mother and ran away to New York, where he ran into the Titans and ended up dying due to his alliance with the H.I.V.E. Slade vowed to pick up his dead son's contract against the Teen Titans; Adeline promptly interfered; she blamed Slade for Grant's death. Due to Adeline's intervention, Joseph, who had been working with her, joined the Titans as Jericho.\n\nJoseph eventually became possessed by the spirits of Azarath. Begging his father to kill him in order to prevent the corrupted spirits from achieving their purpose, Adeline's only remaining son died at her husband's hand. Adeline found this out from one of her Searchers Inc. agents, rather than from Slade himself, which merely cemented her long-held grudge against her ex-husband.\n\nSlade, however, held no grudge against her, keeping an eye out for her safety and attempting to aid her when he thought he could get away with it; e.g., when Adeline had been abducted by her first husband Morel, a.k.a. Count Tavolera, who had poisoned her in an attempt to force her to work with him to discover her ancestor Josiah Kane's treasure.\n\nTo save Adeline's life, Slade gave her some of his own serum-altered blood. This ended up driving her crazy; Slade's genotype had a unique mutation which enabled him to effectively metabolize his serum. Other less fortunate people either died or went insane.\n\nFor a time, Adeline went underground, slowly losing more and more of her normal cognitive abilities, though none of her tactical skills. She eventually turned herself into the H.I.V.E. Mistress, in her madness focusing on superheroes as the reason for her sons' death and creating a plan to kill all the superheroes that she could.\n\nHer plot ultimately resulted in her death. [[Vandal Savage]] put a team together to take advantage of Adeline's plan, intending to take her immortal blood to create a sort of Fountain of Youth potion. With her throat cut, unable to die and yet unable to fully heal, Adeline regained her sanity briefly and pleaded with Slade (who had learned of her involvement and arrived to try and save her) to kill her and reunite her with their children. However, because he still had feelings for her no matter what she had done, he was unable to comply with her request, so [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]] killed her instead.\n\n====Adeline Kane in other media====\nAdeline makes her live-action debut in the second season of ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'' portrayed by [[Mayko Nguyen]].\n\n===Kilg%re===\n*Creators: [[Mike Baron]] and Jackson Guice\n*First appearance: ''[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'' (vol. 2) #3 (August 1987)\n\n'''Kilg%re''' was an electro-mechano-organic intelligence that needed electro-life to survive. It consumed its entire home planet in the Pleides sector and then moved on into space. It was attacked by something known as Meta#sker and placed into a vibrational limbo. Somehow, it found its way to the flats near Salt Lake City on Earth. It could only be seen by people traveling at high speeds, such as an F-15 pilot or the Flash. The Flash unknowingly released it from the limbo it was imprisoned in and it followed him to S.T.A.R. Labs and took over its electrical systems. Kilg%re found the number of machines on Earth ideal for its survival, but humans it deemed distractions and planned to destroy them. It delivered an ultimatum: abandon North America by 12:00 noon on May 10 or be destroyed. During a battle with the Flash in Salt Lake City, it turned out all the power in the country. The Flash sought the help of Cyborg, who used the Titans' satellite to relay the message to the governments of the world to shut down all power in order to kill Kilg%re. This scared it out of the power grid and it weaved a giant mechanical snake across the Utah flats, trying to complete a circuit by catching up with the cloned body of S.T.A.R. Labs' Dr. Schmitz in order to survive. However, the Flash outraced it, supposedly killing it. After Kilg%re's defeat at the hands of the Flash he appeared to be destroyed, but resurfaced in the form of a sentient computer mind hidden in a self-created computer operating system in a deep cave. When [[Maxwell Lord]] was spelunking one day, his then-president had fallen deep into the cave where Kilg%re lay dormant. Sensing a human life, Kilg%re decided to help coax Max into further succeeding his own plans, as well as Max's subconscious plans of self-actualization. To do this, Kilg%re decided to help Max start the new Justice League and grow the group into becoming more international. Kilg%re served in a behind-the-scenes role, constantly coaxing and manipulating Max into furthering his plans, such as gaining money, power and cutting-edge technology to give Kilg%re a stronger machine to inhabit. Through such advantages, Kilg%re and Max were able to create a better duplicate of the Justice League signal device, begin a recruitment drive and find willing villains, gaining additional muscle such as Booster Gold and a new Ace android. Kilg%re grew impatient and decided to start using bigger ideas, such as inciting an international incident to distract Justice League International. To do this, he found hidden technologies designed as a monitoring device by Metron. He launched the satellite, which was only defeated by Mister Miracle because he was used to New God technology. A serious mishap occurred during the Millenium event, in which the Manhunters took over the bodies of those they deemed were close enough to major figures to do damage. One of these Manhunters took over the body of the secretary of Max and, when she delivered coffee to him, she shot him four times. Rushing to Max's safety, Kilg%re promptly eliminated the threat by combining some of his technology with Max in order to save his life and kill the Manhunter. Max eventually learned of Kilg%re's tampering when half of Kilg%re was destroyed by the construct falling through the building that housed Kilg%re. In Kilg%re's fleeting moments, he threw another series of visions designed to tamper with Max's thoughts and implant Kilg%re into another larger system. Max refused and destroyed what was left of Kilg%re's last computing body. Doing so removed the cyborg self-repairing systems in Max's body, which landed him in the hospital. Kilg%re, however, was not completely destroyed.\n\nKilg%re appeared in ''[[DC Rebirth]]''{{'}}s ''[[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]'' #01, 02 and 18 and ''The Flash/[[Speed Buggy]] Special'' #1.\n\n====Powers and abilities of Kilg%re====\nKilg%re has a robot body, electrokinesis, electronic interaction, electronic disruption, electronic constructs, and superhuman speed.\n\n====Kilg%re in other media====\n* A different depiction of Kilg%re appears in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', portrayed by [[Dominic Burgess]].

Ramsey was one of the 12 passengers on the bus which was hit by dark matter when the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash/Barry Allen]] escaped the Speed Force, becoming a metahuman who can control and manipulate technology. In the episode \"Mixed Signals\", Ramsey, taking the name \"Kilg%re\", used his powers to take revenge on his former teammates, killing one and nearly doing the same to the others, until he was stopped by Team Flash and remanded to Iron Heights. In the episode \"True Colors\", Kilg%re is among the metahuman inmates at Iron Heights Penitentiary that Warden Wolfe planned to sell to Blacksmith. When Warden Wolfe outs Barry's true identity to Blacksmith, [[Dwarfstar]], [[Hazard (DC Comics)|Hazard]], Kilg%re, and [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Black Bison|Black Bison]], they prepare to attack, only for the Thinker to arrive and absorb the powers of the four metahumans while killing them.\n* Kilg%re appears in the tie-in comic ''[[Justice League Adventures]]'' #28.\n* Kilg%re appears in the tie-in comic ''[[Green Lantern: The Animated Series]]'' #14.\n\n===King Cobra===\nThere have been at least two different characters named the '''King Cobra''' in [[DC Comics]].\n\n====Batman villain====\nThe King Cobra is a mob boss in Gotham City who wears a green snake costume.

Batman visited Kirigi when he recognized some of the moves done by the League of Assassins members that Kirigi taught him.\n\n====Kirigi in other media====\nKirigi appears in the video game ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', voiced by [[Kaiji Tang]]. He is featured in the \"Initiation\" DLC challenge map. Before he becomes Batman, Bruce Wayne approaches his dojo in the mountains of North Korea and asks Kirigi to train him. Kirigi lets him train with him and his students for a while out of pity and later tests him to see if he is worthy. Depending on how the player operates Bruce Wayne during this performance, there are three different endings after Bruce Wayne defeats [[Lady Shiva]]. If the player completes the challenge map with less than nine medals, Kirigi states that Bruce is the best foreigner that he has trained, yet he does not say much. Kirigi then sends Bruce to find a bucket and broom in order to clean the latrines. If the player completes the challenge map with nine or more medals, Kirigi is impressed with Bruce's progress, yet states that he still has a lot to learn. For the time being, Kirigi then sends Bruce to find a rag in order to clean the floors. If the player completes the challenge map with all 15 medals, Kirigi states to Bruce that he is impressed and, at the same time, also states that he is rarely impressed. Upon telling Bruce that he has gained his dojo's respect and proven himself worthy, Kirigi states that he will be given the information that he seeks. Bruce is sent to the kitchen by Kirigi to prepare tea for him and all of Kirigi's students, where there is much to discuss.\n\n===Komodo===\n{{Comics character list header\n|name = Komodo\n|CBDBid =\n|GCDid = Simon+Lacroix\n}}\n'''Komodo''' ('''Simon Lacroix''') first appears in ''[[Green Arrow]]'' (vol. 5) #17 (April 2013).<ref>''Green Arrow'' (vol. 5) #17 (April 2013)</ref><ref name=\"Guide\" />{{rp|170}} He was created by writer [[Jeff Lemire]] and artist [[Andrea Sorrentino]].

She also has ties to [[Peter Gambi]]. Lady Eve is later murdered by Tobias' men as part of a plan to frame Black Lightning and also avenging [[#Joey Toledo|Joey Toledo]] when Peter Gambi left the blame of his death on Lady Eve's group. It was later revealed that she was an old friend of Lazarus Prime who taught him some of her tricks. [[Technocrat (comics)|Baron]] later found her picture on Gambi's computer when trying to find out who tried to have Gambi killed. Lady Eve was shown to be revived offscreen and is the head of the Ultimate O business where she starts to develop some competition with Lala and the remnants of the 100.\n\n===Lillian Luthor===\n'''Lillian Luthor''' (portrayed by [[Alisen Down]]) was the mother of Alexander Luthor and Julian Luthor, as well as the wife of [[Lionel Luthor]].\n\n====''Smallville''====\nLillian had a long and prolific role in the TV series ''[[Smallville]]''.\n\nLillian came from a wealthy family. How she met Lionel is unclear, but they were married sometime before the 1980s. By all accounts, Lillian was a caring, beautiful and sophisticated person, as well as comments made by Lex and Lionel have indicated that she had a spirited personality, had ambitions of her own and often stood up to Lionel.\n\nEventually, Lillian began to wonder about the special projects that Lionel had. She searched for answers and found something called \"Veritas\". However, Alexander saw her going through his father's briefcase, so Lillian asked him not to tell anyone. When Lionel found out, he immediately blamed Alexander and forced him to tell the truth. When Alexander did, Lillian insisted Lionel explain what Veritas was, but Lionel knocked her to the floor instead and warned her not to look into his projects again. Lillian felt angered and disgusted by Alexander's betrayal.\n\nSometime later, Lillian became ill with a heart condition that worsened over the rest of her life. Lionel hired a nurse named Rachel Dunleavy to assist her. Rachel and Lionel subsequently had an affair, resulting in the birth of Lionel's illegitimate son, Lucas. It is unclear whether Lillian knew of the affair or the child.\n\nLillian was helped by a nanny, Pamela Jenkins, who Alexander regarded as a second mother. Lionel was often absent from home and Lillian insisted that he take Alexander on one of his business trips to Smallville during the meteor shower of 1989. Lionel's resulting shame and constant critique of Alexander bothered Lillian greatly.\n\nSometime in the early 1990s, Lionel insisted that they have another child, an idea that Lillian was highly opposed to, presumably because of her poor health. However, when Alexander was 11, Lillian became pregnant again. She insisted that Alexander be allowed to come home for school from Excelsior Academy and Lionel complied. Her pregnancy was strenuous and Lillian was bedridden for much of it. On Alexander's disastrous 12th birthday (which no one attended), Lillian gave him a lead box allegedly made from the armor of St. George, which he kept into adulthood and later gave to Clark Kent.\n\nAfter baby Julian's birth, Lillian descended into a deep case of postpartum depression, refusing to hold the child and crying perpetually. One evening, Lionel sent the baby's nanny home and insisted that Lillian bond with the child. Lillian expressed her concern that Lionel would pit the two boys against each other and announced that she wanted a divorce, a threat that she had apparently made many times and that Lionel had called \"tiresome\".\n\nOn returning home from work one night, Lionel discovered Alexander in the baby's nursery. Alexander immediately apologized and confessed to accidentally killing Julian while trying to stop him from crying. Lionel erupted into a fierce rage and struck Alexander. Their relationship never recovered, even after he became an adult. It was not until years later, after receiving experimental therapy to recall repressed memories, that he remembered that Lillian had in fact smothered the baby during one of her delusions, hoping to spare him from Lionel's maltreatment. Alexander took the blame, correctly assuming that his father would cover it up in order to protect his sole heir, although he would probably be less inclined to do so for his wife.\n\nSometime before her death Lillian, along with Lex and Lionel, went to a ranch in Montana to spend time together. During that time, a snake spooked Lillian's horse, prompting Lionel to save her and wait on her until she was better.\n\nAfter Julian's death, Lillian's health rapidly deteriorated and she died several months later in the spring of 1993 when Alexander was 13. He later confessed to Clark that he was in denial about her impending death and spent the time researching treatments and doctors instead of being with her. Lex also told Lana Lang that he was away at boarding school when Lillian died and found out about her passing from reporters who had sneaked into his school.\n\nLillian left her shares of LuthorCorp to her son and Pamela.\n\nLillian's death was extremely influential in the adult Lex's life. He had visions of his mother on many occasions. When Lex was shot and ended up in a coma, he had a near-death experience. In it, Lillian visited him and showed Lex an alternate life of happiness that he could have if he would simply walk away from Lionel and LuthorCorp. However, at the end of the vision, Lana (his dream wife) suffered complications during childbirth. Because of Lex's lack of resources and estrangement from his father, he was unable to transfer Lana to a better facility and she died: this led Lex to believe that Lana died because he lacked enough money and power: with these, everything else in life could be secured. As a result, Lex ignored his mother's warning and continued his lifestyle of deceit and corruption. After realizing this, Lillian was seen in the reflection of a hospital window crying over her son's choice.\n\nWhen Lex was injected with the Limbo drug, which placed its users in a state of \"clinical death\", he met Lillian again, who told him that she was angry with him for ignoring her advice.\n\nWhen Lex was shot and went into a coma, Clark Kent and Lionel used a machine that allowed Clark to enter Lex's mind in order to find Lois Lane and Kara Kent. In Lex's mind, Clark met a young version of Lex and the two hid from a psychotic and murderous adult Lex. In the memory featuring Lillian snooping in Lionel's briefcase, Clark witnessed Lionel's verbal and physical abuse of both Lex and Lillian, as well as watched Lex try to help his mother up, but Lillian uncharacteristically told him that he had done enough and walked away from him.\n\n====Lillian Luthor in comics====\nIn DC Comics, Lex Luthor's mother is named '''Arlene Luthor'''. In later incarnations, her name was changed to '''\"Leticia\"''' even though she remained unnamed in most of her appearances.\n\n====Lillian Luthor in other media====\nLillian Luthor (known as '''the Doctor''') appears in ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', portrayed by [[Brenda Strong]]. Dr. Lillian Luthor is a scientist, the leader of [[Project Cadmus]], the wife of the late Lionel Luthor, the mother of [[Lex Luthor]] and the adoptive mother of [[Lena Luthor]].\n\n===Lunkhead===\nLunkhead is an enemy of [[Batman]] who became an inmate at [[Arkham Asylum]]. Lunkhead was clearly stupid, but exhibited massive strength; he made an enemy of [[Ventriloquist (comics)#Arnold Wesker|Arnold Wesker]] when he smashed Wesker's companion \"Scarface\". He was sacrificed to the devil by a pack of demons, along with many others, when the Ventriloquist threw his voice to make it seem as though Lunkhead was volunteering to be thrown into the fiery pit with the rest of the damned.\n\n====Lunkhead in other media====\n* Lunkhead appears in ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', voiced by [[JB Blanc]]. He is a reformed criminal who was beaten into a coma for two months by Batman. He was part of a therapy program in [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] alongside Margaret Sorrow. Lunkhead was released and has been a reformed criminal. Lieutenant [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] asks him about Margaret, bribing him with chocolate.\n* Lunkhead appears in the ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'' episode \"A Dark Knight: One of My Three Soups\", portrayed by Hank Strong. This version is an African-American [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] and had known Jerome Valeska's uncle Zachary Trumble. When he showed up to assist Zachary, Jerome spilled some soup on him. Upon Bruce Wayne arriving, he fought against Lunkhead and defeated him.\n\n==M==\n===Matches Malone===\n{{Comics character list header\n| debut = ''Batman'' #242\n| debutmo = June\n| debutyr = 1972\n| creators = [[Dennis O'Neil]], [[Irv Novick]], [[Dick Giordano]]\n| name = Matches Malone\n| CBDBid = 9795\n| GCDid = Matches+Malone\n}}\n'''Matches Malone''' was originally a Gotham gang boss who [[Batman]] attempted to recruit to help him take down [[Ra's al Ghul]]. When he was accidentally killed by a ricocheting bullet that was meant for Batman, Batman began to impersonate him to use his underworld contacts and to fool Ra's.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=9780345501066 |pages=245-247}}</ref>\n\nPost-''Crisis'', he was a relatively small-time arsonist with his brother Carver and who came to [[Gotham City]] early on in [[Batman]]'s career, attracting Batman's attention when Carver was apparently murdered. Although Matches was the prime suspect, there was no concrete evidence to make the charges stick and Matches was released, only for Batman to subsequently find what appeared to be Matches' dead body in another fire, apparently a suicide. However, Batman never reported the death; at the time, he had been attempting to establish a criminal alias for himself to help him gather information, but the exclusive nature of the criminal sects meant that no one would recruit someone that they had not heard of, prompting him to adopt Matches' identity and use it for his own.\n\nHowever, years later, Batman learned the truth about what had happened. Carver's death had actually been a suicide prompted by his guilt over a fire that he and Matches had started that resulted in the death of a homeless man resting in the building they had torched, with Matches making the body look like a murder victim because he was ashamed of his brother's suicide. Subsequently, deciding to escape Batman stalking him for the crime, Matches used the body of their earlier victim to fake his own death, with Batman being so eager to establish his criminal alias that he never took the time to definitively confirm the body's identity. After operating underground for years by committing low-end robberies, Matches returned to Gotham after hearing reports of 'his' activities, only to be shot by [[Ventriloquist (comics)#Arnold Wesker|Scarface]] for 'his' recent betrayal, surviving long enough to simply confess his role in events to Batman and [[Nightwing]] before dying, with his last request being that Batman bury him next to his brother Carver.\n\nHaving destroyed Scarface in 'revenge' for Matches' death, Batman commented to Nightwing later on that he continued using the Matches identity because, in the years he had spent playing Matches, he had come to recognize that Matches was not an evil man, but had done some bad things that he never had the chance to make up for, regarding his use of Matches' name as a chance to give Matches some absolution.\n\nThe \"Matches Malone\" identity indirectly caused the events of ''[[Batman: War Games]]''; after she was fired as Robin, [[Stephanie Brown (character)|Stephanie Brown]] attempted to implement an old plan of Batman's that would allow him to take control of the city's criminal organisations, hoping that this would impress Batman enough to convince him to take her back. Unfortunately, she was unaware that Batman's agent who was meant to take control of the meeting, Matches Malone, was actually Batman himself, resulting in tensions between the crime families flaring up and most of them being killed in the subsequent stand-off, leading into the subsequent gang wars and Stephanie's own apparent death.\n\nIn ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' comic book series, Batman uses the Matches Malone guise against the False Face Society and a backstory reveals Malone was a low-level enforcer for [[Rupert Thorne]] who agreed to become a snitch for Batman and [[Commissioner Gordon]] against Thorne. But, when Malone began skimming cash from Thorne, he was shot to death by \"two Chicago triggers\" who go by the monikers Dapper (for always dressing well) and Cricket (for his short wiry build). Upon finding the dying Malone and being told that his killers went to a well-known Chinese restaurant, Batman removed his glasses\u2014and was shocked by what Malone looked like. Batman took Malone's guise, defeated the two hitmen and sent them to prison, and has used the guise ever since.\n\n====Matches Malone in other media====\n* The character, renamed '''Matthew \"Matches\" Malone''', is used in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' as an alias by [[Batman]] (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]). In the episode \"[[Chill of the Night!]]\", Batman uses the name variation during a trip to the past with the [[Phantom Stranger]] to see [[Thomas Wayne]] and [[Martha Wayne]] years before their deaths and unaware that Malone is their grown son. In the episode \"The Mask of Matches Malone!\", Batman gets amnesia while in his Matches Malone persona and believes himself to actually be a gangster.\n* The character appears, renamed '''Patrick \"Matches\" Malone''', in the live-action ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'' TV series, portrayed by Danny Schoch in his first masked appearance and by [[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]] in the second appearance. This version is a philosophical hitman-for-hire who is one of Gotham City's deadliest murderers and was an old partner of [[Mutants (DC Comics)|Mutants]] leader Terence \"Cupcake\" Shaw. He is the masked man in shiny shoes who killed Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne in front of Bruce Wayne and [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]] (who was watching from the highest part of the fire escape), taking [[Joe Chill]]'s place in the comics and most adaptations. This has led Detective [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] into finding him in order to bring to justice. [[Silver St. Cloud]] revealed the killer's identity to be Patrick. When Bruce finally confronts Patrick, Patrick stated that he was tired of doing bad things, while barely recalling if he killed Bruce's parents and Bruce decides not to kill Patrick. Using the gun that Bruce left behind, Patrick committed suicide by the time Gordon caught up with Bruce. Gordon and [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] were left wondering who could have hired Malone to kill Thomas and Martha (which was eventually revealed to be [[Hugo Strange]]).\n\n===Menagerie===\n{{Infobox comics character| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| image=\n| caption=Sonja shapeshifting, art by [[Doug Mahnke]]\n| character_name=Menagerie\n| real_name=Pamela<br>Sonja\n| publisher=[[DC Comics]]\n| debut='''Pamela:''' ''Action Comics'' #[[What's So Funny About Truth, Justice & the American Way?|775]] (March 2001)<br>'''Sonja:''' ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #100 (August 2004)\n| creators= [[Joe Kelly (writer)|Joe Kelly]] and [[Doug Mahnke]]\n| alliances=[[Justice League]]<br/>[[The Elite (DC Comics)|The Elite]]\n| aliases=\n| powers=Controls symbiotic alien parasites\n}}\n'''Menagerie''' is a name shared by two [[anti-hero]]ines in the [[DC Universe]], both members of [[The Elite (DC Comics)|the Elite]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=241}}</ref> The two are [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] sisters who are linked with a [[symbiotic]] alien weapon cr\u00e8che called symbeasts.

While the origins of her powers are unclear in ''Action Comics'' #775, [[Manchester Black]] states that the rogue [[Men in Black]] (from the [[Department of Extranormal Operations]]) once picked up the dregs of society, turning them into weapons and selling them off to the highest alien bidder. Black recruits Pam to be a member of the Elite. This group takes it upon themselves to \"free the Earth of scum\". They come into conflict with [[Superman]] during their first mission and Superman disables them following a showdown on Jupiter's moon, Io. The Elite are delivered into custody, but soon released by President [[Lex Luthor]].<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #593\u2013594</ref> During an assassination attempt on Luthor, Menagerie reveals to Superman that the Elite are acting against their wills.

As Sister Superior she convinces Pamela's sister, Sonja, to assume control of the alien cache as the second Menagerie. Vera then approaches the [[Justice League|JLA]] with a proposition to form a sort of [[black op]]s JLA team: [[Justice League Elite]].<ref>''JLA'' #100</ref> Sonja's hatred of Manchester Black becomes a hatred of the Elite. Sonja sees this as her opportunity to kill Vera's dream, so she plays along and joins the team. In their first mission, Menagerie secretly coaxes [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Coldcast|Coldcast]] into killing the foreign terrorist dictator, Hi-Shan Bhat.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #1\u20133</ref> Menagerie lays low during the fallout and puts effort into her personal relationship with Coldcast. The two become lovers and are drawn together by their shared affection for Pamela. Then, while most of the Elite goes underground, Vera is finally fully overtaken by the disembodied Manchester Black.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #4\u20137</ref>\n\nWhile Black threatens Earth with a [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|Fourth World]] god, Menagerie goes missing and Coldcast is arrested by the JLA for Bhat's murder. Coldcast confesses to the murder and is taken to the Slab prison. There he is visited by the spirit of the recently departed [[Manitou Raven]], who frees him from Menagerie's control.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #10\u201311</ref> Coldcast is exonerated and the team tracks Sonja to Costa Rica. She is taken into JLA custody, deprived of the aliens, and begins a gradual separation that they hope will sever her connection to the symbeasts.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #12</ref>\n\n====Powers and abilities of Menagerie====\nThe symbeasts can be assembled to shift over the host to form various shapes and weapons such as claws, spikes or whips. Most commonly, they form around the body and take the form of wings, enabling Menagerie to fly. She can also instruct them to take other forms, or detach from her body and operate independently. One creature has a bite that can force its victims to tell the truth. According to Vera Black, there is also a creature among the creche that can create bio-electric bursts. Menagerie has acidic blood as well and Sonja often allows herself to get hurt by her opponents as a combat tactic.\n\n====Menagerie in other media====\nMenagerie appears in ''[[Superman vs. The Elite]]'', voiced by [[Melissa Disney]].\n\nA variation of the Pamela version of Menagerie appears in her self-titled ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' episode portrayed by Jessica Meraz. In this show, '''Pamela Ferrer''' is a jewel thief who got bonded to a snake-like alien, transforming her into Menagerie. After she killed her partner Chuck and some other people, Menagerie was confronted by Supergirl, the Martian Manhunter, Brainiac 5, and [[Alex Danvers]]. Their fight attracted the attention of the Children of Liberty. When Menagerie planned to rob the masquerade ball, she encountered [[Nia Nal]] and Supergirl and George Lockwood show up. While she did manage to subdue Supergirl, the snake-like alien on Menagerie was beheaded by George. President Baker made an example out of Menagerie and had her incarcerated. While in her cell, Menagerie received a pleasing letter from Manchester Black.

He is killed when [[Valentina Vostok]] (as Firestorm) becomes unstable, causing a nuclear explosion at Koshmar.\n\n===Preus===\n'''Preus''' is a [[fictional]] [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] who first appeared in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #625 (April 2004) and was created by [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]] and [[Talent Caldwell]].<ref name=aos625>''Adventures of Superman'' #625 (April 2004)</ref>\n\nFor years, '''Sergeant Preus''' had proudly served the Citizen's Patrol Corps, a police force that kept the peace in [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] under the [[Kryptonian]] banner of El, their \"creator\".<ref name=aos625/> Due to the compression of time, more than a century had passed inside the bottle city (compared to only a handful of years outside it) during which Preus and his fellow Kandorians had come to worship \"The [[Superman]]\" as their \"god in heaven\" above. The Corpsman was also a devout [[xenophobia|xenophobe]], who dispensed justice against \"non-K\" (Kryptonian) dissidents that threatened their way of life, especially a citizen named [[Kal-El]], who forever tainted Paradise when he seemingly murdered several Kandorians.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=319}}</ref>\n\nPreus swore a solemn oath to make the murderer pay, not realizing that Kal-El was actually the Superman that he and the others had worshiped for so long.<ref>''Action Comics'' #813 (May 2004)</ref> He was also unaware that the \"victims\" were constructs created by an alien telepath, [[Lyla (comics)|Lyla]], who had brainwashed Kal-El into believing that Kandor was a never-exploded [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]].<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #626 (May 2004)</ref> Eventually shattering the illusion, Superman escaped Kandor and confronted Lyla back in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. Preus followed them, but exposure to [[Earth]]'s air and yellow sun drastically affected him, giving him strange, new powers equal to Superman's while amplifying his already-unbalanced [[Racism|racist]] views.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #202\u2013203 (April\u2013May 2004)</ref>\n\nConvinced that Kal-El had defiled the legacy of \"The Superman\", Preus swore to assume that responsibility himself and that all of the impure would die by his hand. His [[xenophobia]] led him to a group of [[White supremacy|white supremacists]] in the American desert, who he forced into worshiping him and his views. However, in time, the people of \"God's Peake\" (as the camp was called) came to worship Preus as their cult leader. His increasing prominence eventually led both the [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Jimmy Olsen]] to investigate, only to have both of them captured by Preus and his men.<ref>''Action Comics'' #821 (January 2005)</ref>\n\nThis forced a confrontation with Superman, who, at the time, was dealing with the effects of [[Gog (DC Comics)|Gog]]'s synthetic yellow [[kryptonite]], which had significantly aged and weakened Superman in a short period of time. So weakened, Superman was barely able to deal with Preus' legions alone and quickly found himself outclassed by the (at the time) much more vital Preus.<ref>''Action Comics'' #822 (February 2005)</ref>\n\nA last-ditch gambit using kryptonite to try and weaken Preus failed, as Preus revealed a previously unknown resistance to kryptonite. However, he was finally defeated when Superman attacked and destroyed a key portion of Preus' armor, rendering him unconscious. Afterwards, Preus was injured from that attack and had to be hospitalized. His current whereabouts are unknown. He was last seen as a weakened Superman tried to fly him to [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] for treatment. Preus disappeared after Superman was engaged by an army of Gogs.<ref>''Action Comics'' #825 (May 2005)</ref>\n\n====Powers and abilities of Preus====\nPreus possesses powers similar to those of Superman, such as superhuman strength and speed, flight, invulnerability, X-ray vision and enhanced senses. Unlike Superman, Preus can fire beams of black energy from his eyes that strike a target with intense heat and force. Preus also does not share Superman's vulnerability to [[kryptonite]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Psiphon===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity.

Despite proving to be formidable opponents, both Psiphon and the Dreadnought were defeated when Doctor Psycho and Superboy teamed up to take them down. Psiphon was knocked out by Superboy with just a flick of his finger.\n\n====Powers and abilities of Psiphon====\nHaving undergone genetic modifications by the H.I.V.E., Psiphon, as his name implies, has the ability to drain the energy of a psi-powered individual and feed it to the Dreadnought to increase his strength.\n\n===Puppeteer===\n{{Redirect|Puppeteer (comics)|the Marvel Comics character|Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|other uses|Puppet Master (disambiguation){{!}}Puppet Master}}\n{{Comics character list header\n| debut = ''[[Green Lantern]]'' (vol. 2) #1 (July\u2013Aug. 1960)\n| creators = [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]], [[Gil Kane]]\n| alias = Jordan Weir\n| abilities = \"Hypno-ray\" device that allows mind control\n}}\n\nThe '''Puppeteer''', originally known as the '''Puppet Master''', is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]].

Williams II]].\n\n'''Mr. Auerbach''' (first appearance in ''Flash'' (vol. 2) #238 (May 2008)), was the son of a media mogul whose holdings included the cable news network KN News. He pursued a career in journalism, hoping to work his way up in his father's company. While working on a story, he met Edwar Martinez, who was capable of sensing the fears in others and making them a reality.\nAuerbach eventually was put in charge of KN News, where he had a hand in determining much of the content that the network covered.\n\nHe also led a double life as the villain '''Spin'''. He kept Edwar captive in the basement of the news building, hooking him up to machines and forcing him to watch news coverage. In this setting, Spin was able to channel and direct Edwar's amazing ability.\n\nHis first caper was robbing a Faberg\u00e9 egg from a local auction. He created a distraction by summoning earthquakes, which had been in the public's mind due to a recent quake in [[Hub City (comics)|Hub City]].\n\nHe took advantage of a comment made on television by the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] expressing his financial woes. After the citizens of [[Keystone City]] started to feel some doubt about their local hero, Spin lured him to the Keystone City Salamanders stadium and forced him to steal many valuables from the fans there. This causes a massive public outcry against the Flash, which Spin enhances with his powers, even turning the original Flash against his successor.\n\nWhen Spin and Edwar realized that the Flash had identified the source of the disturbances as emanating from KN News, he used his abilities to summon [[Gorilla Grodd]] to Keystone, the Rogue which Edwar sensed would make the speedster most anxious. Grodd, however, was not pleased with his sudden teleportation and a massive battle ensued. In the chaos, Edwar was released from his machinery and his powers went completely out of control, causing citizens to act out nearly every situation being mentioned in the media.\n\n====Equipment of Spin====\nSpin has a vast array of equipment set up in the basement of the KN News building, where he keeps Edwar Martinez. By forcing Edwar to watch news coverage, he is able to direct and control Edwar's ability to sense specific anxieties in the public consciousness and turn them into reality.\n\nSpin wears a costume with a television screen for a face. Usually static appears on the screen, but when channeling Edwar's powers, the face of his victim or a phrase describing his actions may appear. He can summon this costume by uttering the words \"Load theme\".\n\n====Spin in other media====\nIn ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' [[The Flash (season 5)|season five]], a female version of Spin named '''[[Spencer Young]]''' (portrayed by Kiana Madeira) appears as a young millennial with a blog app dedicated to metahumans. She used to work with [[Iris West]] and now has a rivalry with her competing blog. During the Enlightenment, Young's cellphone was hit with debris from [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]]'s satellite, turning it into meta-tech capable of controlling people's minds. After [[Nora West-Allen|XS]] appears in Central City, Young decides to make her blog more popular by creating headlines starring her and reporting them seconds before they happen. Her plan is eventually thwarted by the Flash and she is remanded to Iron Heights. In that same episode, it is shown that Spin and XS are attracted to each other. In the episode \"Gone Rogue\", Spin's cellphone is stolen by XS and given to [[Bug-Eyed Bandit|Brie Larvan]] as a new way for her to control her robotic bees.\n\n===Stalnoivolk===\n{{Comics character list header\n|debut = ''[[Firestorm the Nuclear Man]]'' #67\n|debutmo = January\n|debutyr = 1988\n|creators = [[John Ostrander]] and [[Joe Brozowski]]\n|abilities = Superhuman strength, durability and longevity\n|alias = Ivan Illyich Gort\n|name = Stalnoivolk\n|CBDBid = 7837\n|GCDid = Stalnoivolk\n}}\n'''Stalnoivolk''' ({{lang|ru|\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043a}} or \"Steel Wolf\") is a [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Universe]].\n\nThe character, created by [[John Ostrander]] and [[Joe Brozowski]], first appeared in ''[[Firestorm the Nuclear Man]]'' #67 (January 1988).\n\nWithin the context of the stories, Ivan Illyich Gort is a Russian born in the 1900s who underwent government experiments during [[World War II]].

In this new timeline, the '''Starling''' is introduced as part of the relaunch of ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' as a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant and markswoman who has been friends with the [[Black Canary]] since they worked undercover together at the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]'s Iceberg Lounge. She is later chosen by the Black Canary to help reform the Birds of Prey, but later betrays the group.\n\n====Starling in other media====\n* The character later appears in the TV series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' as '''Evelyn Crawford Sharp''', played by Madison McLaughlin. Introduced in season four, she emerges as an impostor Black Canary following Laurel Lance's death. She was a star gymnast before her family became a [[H.I.V.E.]] test subject, leaving Evelyn as the only survivor. Knowing her idol had just died, she briefly took up the identity in her crusade against her parents' killer, more precisely his wife, before giving it up to save her hero's reputation as [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] under the guise, as Green Arrow advised her to do. In season five, Evelyn is recruited by Oliver to train and join Green Arrow's team of vigilantes, taking the codename '''Artemis''' (unlike the comic book version, who calls herself the Starling). Later, she betrays the team to [[Adrian Chase|Prometheus]] as a brief double agent upon learning of Oliver's past as the Hood. Apparently, she regrets to Oliver for betrayal during his captivity by Adrian who seemingly kills her, but this was revealed to be a deception in order to break Oliver psychologically. She later releases Black Siren (Laurel's Earth Two counterpart) and both of them, along with [[Talia al Ghul]], kidnap all members of Team Arrow, including police captain Quentin Lance and Oliver's son William, and take them to Lian Yu island in order to force Oliver into releasing Adrian from jail. Evelyn is seen keeping captured prisoners Thea, Felicity, Curtis and William's mother Samantha in cages with Talia. Oliver and his army of former enemies release the prisoners from the cages, but [[Digger Harkness]] betrays them. Evelyn is defeated and put in a cage, but Oliver promises to come back for her after the reckoning. Her fate is unknown, since Chase detonated the island with explosives and there is no sign or trace that she escaped from the island.\n** In the ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' episode \"Doomworld\", Evelyn Sharp's Artemis mask can be seen in a glass display case alongside other vigilantes' masks inside Damien Darhk's office, who has become Star City's mayor after he and the Legion of Doom changed reality.\n\n===Sy Borgman===\n'''Sy Borgman''' is a retired wheelchair-bound U.S. agent with some cybernetic enhancements and an ally of [[Harley Quinn]] that first appeared in ''Harley Quinn'' (vol. 2) #2 (March 2014)\n\n====Sy Borgman in other media====\nSy Borgman appears in the ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]'' TV series voiced by [[Jason Alexander]].

[[Killer Frost|Caitlin Snow]] invites him to fuse with Dr. Stein, considering him the 'better' candidate due to his scientific background, even though [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Jefferson Jackson|Jax Jackson]] seems like a closer genetic match. Henry is upset when the fusion fails; however, the fusion does awaken an uncontrollable nuclear power within him which comes out when he is angry (which has caused him to have a criminal history).

She blamed this predicament on Luthor and left the team.\n\nWeeks later, she had stopped using the Sharp and her friend and former teammate, [[Natasha Irons]], convinced Luthor to let her back on the team. She hoped to one day move on to become a member of the [[Teen Titans]] and become the new [[Kid Flash]].

Its appearance and abilities are approximately the same.\n\nSilverstone is the only Pre-''Crisis'' user of the stone that has been mentioned in Post-''Crisis'' continuity. Overuse of the Blackrock's powers blinded Silverstone and left him insane. He was found sitting muttering to himself and watching constant television shows in an apartment owned by an ex-convict named '''Samuel Benjamin''', who beat Silverstone to death with the Blackrock and took it for himself. Despite its power, his inexperience with the Blackrock led to his defeat and Superman took the stone and threw it towards the Sun.<ref>''Superman'' #218 (August 2005)</ref>\n\nA short time later, [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]], disguised as [[Lex Luthor]], dispatched [[Bizarro]] to retrieve the Blackrock from the Sun<ref>''Superman'' #222 (December 2005)</ref> before passing it on to a South American woman named '''Lucia''',<ref>''Superman'' #223 (January 2006)</ref> a drug smuggler and revolutionary who had been jailed by Superman before. Her intense feelings of hatred towards the Man of Steel matched those of the Blackrock and she proved particularly adept in using it. However, her skills were not enough to defeat Superman and the Blackrock withdrew into itself.<ref>''Superman'' #224 (February 2006)</ref>\n\nIt was eventually shown that the Blackrock had been kept by Superman, who eventually locked it away in his Fortress of Solitude. The Blackrock eventually escaped and bonded with [[Plastic Man]]. Shortly after, the Blackrock was removed from Plastic Man and found its way into the hands of [[Batman]], who shortly afterwards decided he needed its powers to help him stop a currently-rampaging Superman (Superman had fallen under the influence of [[Despero]] as he attempted to turn Earth's alien heroes against humans). Although it remained on Batman after Superman threw off Despero's influence, Superman was able to force it to leave Batman by threatening to kill him, informing the Blackrock that he knew Batman would rather die than live like this.\n\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Blackrock is '''Bradley Glenn''', an ex-con who was hired to star in a [[reality television]] show called ''Badass Nation'' about the life of a supervillain.<ref>''Superman: Lois and Clark'' #5 (April 2016)</ref> The TV company provided him with powered armor and a fictional backstory about finding it in a crashed spacecraft. They intended to film him tearing up a bridge that was scheduled for demolition, but the crew neglected to ensure that the bridge had been closed to traffic and the Pre-''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' Superman had to intervene.<ref>''Superman: Lois and Clark'' #6 (May 2016)</ref>\n\nThe Post-''Crisis'' wielders of the Blackrock seem to have developed differing powers based on their personalities. All seem to have possessed superhuman strength and endurance, flight and energy projection abilities. The Blackrock also has the ability to absorb ambient energy to empower its wielder. Dr. Silverstone seemed most adept at using its ability to process information from TV and radio signals. Samuel Benjamin was particularly skilled at using it to boost his own physical strength and toughness. Lucia's abilities seemed to be an amalgamation of her predecessors', but she seemed to prefer using its energy projection abilities and discovered a way to use it to drain Superman's power.\n\nWhile the stone had bonded to [[Plastic Man]], he was not shown using its abilities much.\n\n[[Batman]] used it in much the same way that Lucia did; however, Batman showed more of a preference for physical combat than Lucia did.\n\n[[Jimmy Olsen]] and several other humans were bonded to the Blackrocks when a shower of them rained down on Earth. These people showed some level of superhuman abilities similar to those demonstrated by Lucia, etc. but it was not shown if they were as strong as he was.\n\nBradley Glenn's armor enabled him to leap great distances and an energy field around one gauntlet gave him a powerful punch.\n\n===Blackwing===\n'''Blackwing''' ('''Charles \"Charlie\" Bullock''') is a fictional [[superhero]] from [[DC Comics]]. He was created by Paul Levitz, Joe Staton and Joey Cavalieri.\n\nThe character was chronologically introduced in ''Adventure Comics'' #464 (April 1979), but was unnamed in that comic. He was, however, named in his next appearance in ''Wonder Woman'' #281 (April 1981) and later, became Blackwing in ''Wonder Woman'' #297 (August 1982). Also, worth to note, the original story in ''Adventure Comics'' was intended for ''All Star Comics'' #75. Charlie was drawn as a teen in that story, but his next appearance (only three years later) depicts him as a young adult who graduated from law school.\n\nIn his mid-teens, Charles Bullock was searching for a direction in life. The teenager found it after he helped fight off street punks alongside Wildcat (Ted Grant) and was invited to join him at his gym. Charlie attended law school and later became a junior partner and top-notch researcher to the law firm called Cranston, Grayson and Wayne. When a criminal named Karnage broke into the office looking for his boss, Arthur Cranston, this, and another event, led him to become the costumed hero Blackwing. Although his first outing as a crime fighter proved unsuccessful when he was captured by the costumed villain Boa's gang, Blackwing managed to contribute in freeing the [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)]] from Boa's giant snake and recorded some evidence that was used to put the mastermind and his men away.\n\nSince then, Blackwing has never appeared again in any other published story.\n\n===Vera Black===\n{{Comics character list header\n|name = Vera Black\n|CBDBid = 2534\n}}\n'''Vera Black''' is a British psionic cyborg in the [[DC Universe]].\n\nThe character, created by [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]] and [[Doug Mahnke]], first appeared in ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #100 (August 2004).<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/208041/\n|title=JLA #100\n|publisher=The Grand Comics Database\n|accessdate=2012-05-29\n}}</ref> The storyline set up the limited series ''[[Justice League Elite]]'' which consisted of 12 issues published between 2004\u20132005.\n\nWithin the context of the stories, Vera Black is the sister of [[Manchester Black]]. As children their parents would often fight and Manchester would take her out to play to avoid them. As his idea of \"play\" became killing sprees, Vera's perspective became twisted.{{issue|date=May 2012}} When her brother dies after attempting to destroy [[Superman]], she has her ruined arms, lost in an untold childhood incident, replaced with cybernetic prostheses which can configure into any weapon she desires, initially contemplating revenge on Superman before she decides to be better than her brother.\n\nHer new abilities result in her leading the remnants of the [[The Elite (DC Comics)|Elite]] and tacitly working with the [[Justice League]]. This leads to the League, encouraged by the [[Wally West|Flash]], asking her to lead a new team with the intention that she will handle [[black ops]] missions that the League cannot due to what they represent to the public, primarily involving hunting down and eliminating metahuman threats before they go public. Starting with [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Coldcast|Coldcast]] and [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Menagerie|Menagerie]], she adds Flash, [[Manitou Raven]], [[Major Disaster]], [[Green Arrow]] and [[Cassandra Cain|Kasumi]] to the team. She also enlists [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Naif al-Sheikh|Naif al-Sheikh]] to keep the team in check and serve as a liaison to the governments of the world.\n\n====Equipment of Vera Black====\nVera's cybernetic arms have the capacity to transform into an almost unlimited variety of melee, projectile and beam weapons. They also incorporate camouflage technology relying on optics, as well as altering sense perception in others.\n\n====Vera Black in other media====\nVera Black appears in the direct-to-DVD animated feature ''[[Superman vs. The Elite]]'', voiced by [[Marcella Lentz-Pope]] as an adult and by [[Tara Strong]] as a girl in a flashback sequence.\n\n===Block===\n'''Block''' is a young Maori woman living in Melbourne, Australia, the woman dubbed the '''Human Block''' was once inexplicably struck by lightning and survived the incident. Unknown to her, this similar event had happened to many other individuals throughout time and was in fact the Speed Force imbuing her with speed-related abilities. In her then-present time\u20141957\u2014Block acted as a side show attraction in a carnival, the prize of $1,000 going to whoever could move her, which was failed by many, as she had manipulated her body density. One drunken man staggered onto the stage to accept her challenge, making her move by insulting her Maori heritage rather than physically moving her. Angered, she immediately struck out at him and instigated a small brawl, tearing through the crowd before someone hastily drew their firearm on her and shot, only to find that not even bullets affected her. Before the now-turned mob could attack her, Zoom, accompanied by his newly recruited acolytes the Folded Man and Magali, appeared and teleported her outside of the carnival grounds. Being offered the chance to embrace her abilities and live as a godlike being after mastering them, she did not hesitate to join Zoom and his quest to kill the \"evil\" Flash. Along with the other Acolytes, she would train for what would be an unknown amount of time to kill the Flash, facing off with Zoom in his place. It is unknown how long this training took place, as they stated that, over the course of centuries, this team trained to take on the Flash and when they reached older age, Magali would revert them back to their original ages when joining. Unknown to Block, Zoom is actually the one to have orchestrated her joining him to begin with, appearing to the drunk man who challenged her, while convincing him that the way to make her move was to attack her heritage, as he had been keeping close watch on her for some time.\n\n====Powers and abilities of Block====\nBeing imbued with the Speed Force, Block has the unique ability to slow down her atoms. In doing this, they become denser than steel and grant her invulnerability, super-strength and immobility. She can possibly slow down other speedsters, if not other people as well, through physical touch, as she stopped the Top's ability to spin and was able to hold Zoom in place in a headlock. After training centuries with Zoom, she is a deadly fighter. Recently, she was able to stop the molecules around herself to make the air unbreakable.\n\n====Block in other media====\nBlock appears in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' season 5 episode \"Blocked\" portrayed by [[Erin Cummings]]. '''Vanessa Jansen''', nicknamed \"Block\" by [[Cisco Ramon]], was a [[metahuman]] weapons dealer working for the East Street Skulls gang. Vanessa Jansen worked as a weapons dealer for the East Street Skulls gang, but was betrayed. She was subsequently arrested and sent to [[Iron Heights]] for four years. Through unknown means, Jansen acquired metahuman powers, which allowed her to create boxes of dense air. When Jansen got out of Iron Heights, either by escape or release, she took revenge on Bobby Moretti and killed him with her metahuman powers. She then robbed Bobby's warehouse of guns, planning to sell them. However, the buyer turned out to be Bobby's older brother, Bruno Moretti. He attempted to kill her out of revenge for Bobby's death, only for Jansen to save herself with her powers. She then tried to save Bruno, but was stopped by [[XS (comics)|XS]], who saved him instead. XS then tried to capture her, but Jansen trapped her in a block of dense air, causing the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] to come out and confront her. Jansen threw XS into the air, forcing the Flash to save her, allowing Jansen to escape. Later, Jansen attempted to sell the weapons again, but was once again confronted by Bruni. Bruni arrived with backup, threatening to kill Jansen if she did not return the guns. They opened fire on her, but she shielded herself from the bullets using her powers. The Flash and XS took out the weapon dealers and confronted her again. The Flash repeatedly sped around as Jansen tried to hit him, eventually tiring her out. Jansen was able to trap him in a block while he was distracted and caused it to start shrinking. However, XS battled Jansen, tiring her out once again. XS then used the opportunity to put Jansen in power-dampening handcuffs. Suddenly, when Elongated Man and Vibe arrived to help arrest her, Cicada's dagger pierced through Jansen's chest. XS sped her to the hospital, but Jansen died of her injuries on the way there.\n\n===Billy Numerous===\n'''Billy Numerous''' (voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]) was specifically created for the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series and did not have a previous appearance in the mainstream comics. However, he has since made the jump to these with his first appearance in the DC Universe in ''[[Catwoman]]'' #78 (April 2008), now known as '''Repro'''.\n\nBilly Numerous (real name '''William \"Billy\" Strayer''') is a former student of the [[H.I.V.E.]] Academy and an enemy of the [[Teen Titans]]. Numerous first appeared as a student of the H.I.V.E Academy, where his power of self-duplication was subtly hinted at. After the H.I.V.E. was destroyed during [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]'s confrontation with [[Brother Blood]], Numerous and most of the other students went freelance. Later, Numerous engaged in a robbing spree all across Jump City and he stole anything he and his innumerable clones could get his (their) collective hands on. His power thoroughly confounded the Titans, especially Cyborg, who became all the more obsessed in catching him. Finally, however, Cyborg realized that there was another way of catching Numerous. He and the other Titans confronted Numerous in the old stadium where he had stashed his loot, seemingly with numerous copies of themselves. In order to bring them down, Numerous created even more clones of himself, but finally pushed his powers too far. The resulting reabsorption of each of his clones caused a massive physical and mental shock, stunning him and enabling his capture. To add insult to injury, the Titans' copies were not actual clones, but merely holographic projections created and controlled by Cyborg.\n\nAt some point, Numerous entered [[Jinx (comics)|Jinx]]'s H.I.V.E. Five and was also recruited into the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. As one of the Five, he participated in the attempted capture of [[Kid Flash]], but even his numerous clones were unable to stop the super-speedster. Later, when the Brotherhood executed its worldwide strike against young superheroes, he and [[Gizmo (DC Comics)|Gizmo]] were sent to capture Kole and Gnarrk in their subterranean retreat, but both heroes escaped them. When the remnants of the Titans under [[Beast Boy]] later attacked the Brotherhood's headquarters, Numerous and most of his H.I.V.E. Five teammates tried to run, but were intercepted by Kid Flash\u2014and aghast to see that Jinx had switched sides and joined up with him. Moments later, they were all swept away by one of Jinx's hexes and carted off by Kid Flash for flash-freeze treatment.\n \nIn ''[[Catwoman]]'' #78 (April 2008), a character based on Billy Numerous named '''Repro''' appears. The small-time crook known as Repro was operating in [[Gotham City]] during the time when many of the city's criminals disappeared for a short time. He was one of the only two criminals left in the city, with the other being the Thief. Repro was a young and inexperienced criminal who only did small-time criminal activities, just enough to stay off the radar of big-time crime fighters. After a confrontation with Catwoman where he thought he had shot her in the chest, he hastily departed and ran to the Thief to tell him about it. He was, in turn, shot in the chest and killed by the Thief, who then dumped his body in an alley to cover up the murder.\n\n====Billy Numerous in other media====\n* Billy Numerous appears in the ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' tie-in comics. He appears as a background villain and member of the H.I.V.E. Five in this comic adaptation of the animated television series. He engages in various petty crimes and attempts at one point to join a new iteration of the team being organised by Psimon and Dr. Light. He fails the test, along with dozens of other villains.\n* Billy Numerous appears in ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' as a minor supporting villain in several episodes throughout the series, typically in association with other H.I.V.E. Five members.

The character was a throwback to the [[Adam West]] ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series in that he was whimsical and made many condiment-based puns. Condiment King first appeared where he attacked a rooftop restaurant to rob it, only to end up fighting Batman. Chased by Batman to the balcony of the restaurant he robbed, he slipped on some ketchup and fell off the balcony, where he was rendered unconscious upon landing on the police car that [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] and [[Renee Montoya]] were in. They removed his mask, revealing him to be a stand-up comedian named '''Buddy Standler'''. Batman and Alfred Pennyworth watched the news, where it was mentioned that a hospitalized Buddy Standler had no memory of the restaurant attack and that the restaurant is suing the TV studio where Buddy Standler's TV show is broadcast for the damages that Condiment King did to the restaurant.

Damien uses a magical artifact to employ telekinesis and can also drain the life energy of his foes if he makes physical contact with them. The only exception to this is [[Thea Queen]], who causes his life-force absorption ability to backfire due to being revived by the [[Lazarus Pit]]. Although a ruthless killer, when the Green Arrow saves his family from [[Anarky]], Damien allows [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] to leave, despite having a chance to kill him, out of appreciation for the actions. Damien's artifact is eventually destroyed by Vixen and he is prosecuted and sent to Iron Heights Penitentiary. But, after recruiting the [[Malcolm Merlyn|Dark Archer]], [[Brick (comics)|Brick]] and [[Murmur (DC Comics)|Murmur]], he eventually breaks out and murders the [[Black Canary|Black Canary (Laurel Lance)]]. After [[Anarky]] kills his wife and destroys the secret underground city in which Damien planned to survive the [[nuclear holocaust]] he wanted to cause, he becomes nihilistic and decides to destroy the world anyway. But, with help from [[Michael Holt (comics)|Mr. Terrific]] and the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]], Oliver's allies succeed in disabling all but one of the nuclear bombs (a city is destroyed by the successful nuke). Meanwhile, the Green Arrow leads the people of Star City in a rally against Damien and his army, with the outpour of hope nullifying Damien's powers. The two engage in a physical fight with Oliver overpowering him. Defeated, Damien taunts the Green Arrow, stating Oliver spared [[Slade Wilson]] after killing Oliver's mother. Oliver reminds him that he killed tens of thousands of innocent people, including Laurel, and states not having a choice before stabbing him with an arrow, killing him. He returned in season five as a manifestation from a [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominator]]'s mental simulation in the 100th episode ''[[Invasion!

Damien returns in season two as a recurring character, one of the two secondary antagonists alongside Malcolm Merlyn and a member of the [[Legion of Doom]]. He also serves as an archenemy to [[Sara Lance]], Laurel Lance's sister and the Legends' leader. Although initially hesitant to work with [[Eobard Thawne]], he quickly joins forces upon learning of his future death and the failure of his plans from Sara. Together with Eobard, his future/former accomplice the Dark Archer and the rest of the Legion of Doom, he works to find the fabled [[Holy Lance|Spear of Destiny]] in order to change his fate. After they succeed, Damien makes himself mayor of Star City and regains his magical artifact. However, the Legends manage to travel back in time to stop the Legion's success. Eobard also travels back to warn the past Legion, so Damien sets out with the Legion to stop the Legends in a final battle. Using swords and a futuristic gun courtesy of Eobard, Damien eventually kills the future counterpart of [[Citizen Steel]] before engaging in hand-to-hand combat with Sara. Sara manages to overpower him and knock him out. After the Legion is defeated, the Legends return each member of the Legion to their respective place in the timeline and wipe their memories of time travel, so Damien ends up dying in 2016 as before. In season three, Damien is the secondary antagonist and is resurrected from his death by his time-displaced daughter Nora Darhk with his memories restored and resumes his feud with Sara, the Legends and their allies. He later encounters [[Gorilla Grodd]] upon saving him from the napalm bombing during the [[Vietnam War]] and claims to have time traveling technology that will let Grodd time travel at will. It is revealed that his alliance with Mallus is intended to ensure Mallus' release from his prison dimension by causing temporal aberrations that will weaken it, but this effort is complicated when tension arises between Damien and his daughter over their differing approaches to their relationship. Damien, after being convinced by Steel and the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] that his daughter will cease to exist if Mallus is set free, decides to help the Legends stop Mallus from taking Nora's body, but ends up taking Nora's place and is killed by Mallus in the season three finale. In season five, Astra Logue grants Damien a second chance at life. He was supposed cause misery, but instead went to go see Nora. She had to hide the fact of her current status by stating that Constantine is her husband and that Sara and Ava are now her henchmen. Everything unraveled when the ring that Ray placed in a chocolate mousse. Nora's latest charge wishes them all into an episode of ''Mr. Parker's Cul-De-Sac'' (a parody of ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'') where they all worked out their issues in the most unlikeliest of ways. Afterwards, Damien allows Nora to marry Ray. After talking to Sara what Astra wanted him to do, Damien briefly borrowed the Hellsword previously used by [[Genghis Khan]] and stabbed himself.\n\n===Dex-Starr===\n'''Dex-Starr''' is an abandoned stray blue [[Cat|domestic cat]] from Earth, adopted by a woman in Brooklyn who names him Dexter.

Operating from London, England, Dodger will steal and/or sell anything from information to advanced technology.\n\nAt one point he came into possession of what appeared to be an alien spacecraft. Recognizing that the vehicle's stealth capabilities made it a lucrative commodity, he began leasing the vessel to various underworld figures, including the [[League of Assassins]]. When the vessel in question was linked to an assassination attempt against [[Green Arrow (Connor Hawke)|Connor Hawke]], the [[Green Arrow]] and the [[Black Canary]] began investigating its activity. The trail led them to London where they (along with [[Speedy (Mia Dearden)|Mia \"Speedy\" Dearden]]) engaged in combat with Dodger at a local pub. Although Dodger proved to be an able-bodied physical combatant, \"Team Arrow\" subdued him and he told them about the League of Assassins.\n\nWhen pressed for more information, Dodger was unwilling to cooperate, so the Green Arrow and the Black Canary dropped him from the belly of a cargo plane suspended by a bungee cord until he agreed to give them better intelligence. He took them to his secret lair and triangulated the last location of the stealth ship he had leased.\n\nThe Green Arrow and the Black Canary then persuaded him to accompany them on the search, which brought them to a castle in Leichestershire, England. They evaded several traps and finally discovered a cryogenics tube containing the compressed form of former Justice Leaguer [[Plastic Man]].\n\nDodger continued to work alongside \"Team Arrow\" and fought a team of metahumans who claimed to represent the League of Assassins. Dodger contributed very little to the battle; however, he did manage to distract one of them long enough for [[Batman]] to subdue him. Dodger continued adventuring with the group, battled foes and completed the adventure along with the team.\n\nAfter settling their business with the League of Assassins, Dodger accompanied \"Team Arrow\" back to the United States, where he struck up a romantic relationship with Mia Dearden. Mia has now left the States and traveled to London to continue this relationship.\n\n====Dodger in other media====\nDodger appears in the TV series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' portrayed by [[James Callis]]. Appearing in the 15th episode \"Dodger,\" he is a British jewel thief who robs valuable jewels from wealthy occupants and sells them at a high price. Unlike the comics, this iteration of the character uses hostages with bomb collars to steal for him, rather than alien technology. He also uses a high voltage stun-stick as a weapon, which renders victims unconscious. His real name is '''Winnick Norton''', a reference to the original creators of the character, [[Judd Winick]] and [[Mike Norton]]. He is defeated by Oliver and John Diggle when he is taken out with his own \"shocker\" after Oliver causes his car to crash, using an arrow as a dagger, and is arrested by a SCPD unit afterwards. In the ''Arrow: Season 2.5'' tie-in comic, Norton escapes from prison and begins operating out of Bludhaven as part of a mercenary group called the Renegades. He and other members kidnap [[Felicity Smoak]] on the orders of [[Brother Blood|Clinton Hogue]], reminiscent how he kidnapped her earlier in \"Dodger\". Norton and other members are defeated by Oliver Queen, [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy Harper]] and [[Huntress (comics)|Helena Bertinelli]], leaving them bound and tipping off the police so they could arrest them.\n\n===Dominus===\n{{For|the [[Marvel Comics]] villain|Dominus (Marvel Comics)}}\n'''Dominus''' is a [[fictional character]] and a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] who first appeared in ''Action Comics'' #747.

During this time, he fell in love with his peer, Ahti. However, he was driven mad by jealousy when Ahti ascended past him and assumed the mantle of Kismet, Illuminator of All Realities.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nStudying infernal forbidden magic in an attempt to gain the power to challenge his former lover and rob her of the power of Kismet, Tuoni's assault was reflected by Kismet's divine energies and his body was incinerated. Despite Tuoni's deceit, the [[omnibenevolent]] Kismet showed him mercy and shunted his shattered, still-living body into the [[Phantom Zone]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nWithin the [[Phantom Zone]], Tuoni encountered a holographic projection of [[Superman]]'s long-dead [[Kryptonian]] ancestor, Kem-L, who was able to use his own ancient variety of [[arcane]] [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] science to rebuild the former holy man as a [[psionic]], cosmic phantasm known as \"Dominus\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=75-76}}</ref>\n\nIn this new all-powerful form, Dominus escaped the Zone via Superman's [[Fortress of Solitude]] and attacked [[Earth]]. Attempting to find Kismet to steal her cosmic powers, he was opposed by Superman. Swearing vengeance, Dominus [[telepathy|telepathically]] entered Superman's mind and preyed on one of the Man of Steel's greatest weaknesses; his fear of failing the people of [[Earth]].\n\nUsing [[mind control]], Dominus convinced Superman to take control of Earth and build the [[Superman robots]] to police the planet 24 hours a day, seven days a week forever. In another battle, Dominus used his reality-warping powers to become Superman, using the Superman robots to search for Kismet while Superman was disguised as one of his own robots and later as Dominus.\n\nDuring his captivity in these other forms Superman improved on his use of ''Torquasm Vo'', an ancient Kryptonian warrior discipline technique where the warrior can control what they think. Superman and Dominus then engaged in a mental-physical battle with Dominus using any stray thought of Superman to reshape reality. The battle ends with Superman banishing Dominus to the [[Phantom Zone]].\n\nDominus uses his \"Continuum Control\" to alter reality and his \"Control\" to make people unaware that the change occurred. He can actually create more than one simultaneous reality, each one attacking a specific character's mental attributes. Dominus' realities were also inspired by other times in Superman's publishing history (the 1940s, 1960s and 1970s) and \"The Superman of 2965\u20132966\" story involving Muto.<ref>''Superman'' #181 (Nov. 1965)</ref><ref>''Action Comics'' #338\u2013339 (June\u2013July 1966)</ref>\n\n====Dominus behind the scenes====\nIn a 1981 DC Treasury Special called ''Superman and his Fortress of Solitude'', the Pre-''Crisis'' [[Lex Luthor]] posed as a red-armored alien named Dominus as part of an elaborate ruse aimed at destroying the Man of Steel.\n\n===Dreadnought===\nThe '''Dreadnought''' is a fictional character in [[DC Comics]] appearing in ''[[The New 52]]'' continuity. He serves as an agent of the [[H.I.V.E.]], along with [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Psiphon|Psiphon]]. He appears in ''Superboy'' (vol. 4) #20, where he is sent by the H.I.V.E. to [[New York City]] to apprehend [[Doctor Psycho]], who had escaped from a H.I.V.E. facility, and [[Superboy]], whose psionic powers were of interest to the H.I.V.E. The two characters teamed up and managed to defeat the H.I.V.E. soldiers. The Dreadnought was sent flying by Superboy and landed in the [[Hudson River]].\n\nThe Dreadnought has undergone genetic modifications by the H.I.V.E. that mutated him into a giant purple humanoid beast with metallic armor and large black horns protruding from his head. He has superhuman strength and durability, which enables him to hold his own against even Superboy.\n\n===Carl Draper===\n'''Carl Draper''' is a fictional character in [[DC Comics]], an enemy of [[Superman]]. He has gone by the names the '''Master Jailer''', '''Kator''', '''Deathtrap''', the '''Locksmith''' and '''Castellan'''. Draper made his first appearance in ''Superman'' #331 (Jan. 1979), written by [[Martin Pasko]] and drawn by [[Curt Swan]] and [[Frank Chiaramonte]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.supermanartists.comics.org/superwhoswho/Superframe.htm |title=supermanwho |publisher=Supermanartists.comics.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232751/http://www.supermanartists.comics.org/superwhoswho/Superframe.htm |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn the Pre-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' comics, '''Carl \"Moosie\" Draper''' grew up in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] (see ''Kator'' below). Draper was an overweight clumsy teenager whom most of the other kids never noticed or made fun of and was in love with [[Lana Lang]], who had eyes only for [[Superboy]], much to Draper's resentment. As an adult, Draper underwent a self-imposed self-improvement regimen, including exercise and cosmetic surgery, to overcome his physical shortcomings. He became an expert locksmith and architect, designing an inescapable prison for supervillains called \"Mount Olympus\". Impressed by the achievement, Superman augmented the prison's security by placing it on an antigravity platform. Initially dubbed \"Draper's Island\" by Superman, it was informally renamed \"Superman Island\" by the adult Lana\u2014with whom Draper remained smitten, just as she remained lovestruck by Superman. It was the latter name, plus the novelty of the floating platform, that caught public attention, diverting recognition from Draper himself. This proved the final straw for Draper, who snapped and became the costumed supervillain the '''Master Jailer'''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=238-239}}</ref> He attacked Superman and kidnapped Lana under that name.

Kator, however, developed an [[artificial intelligence]] and almost killed the Boy of Steel before being destroyed (in ''New Adventures of Superboy'' #18). However, the robot apparently gave Draper its identity and powers before being destroyed. Draper (as the new Kator) then engages Superboy in combat. However, Jonathan Kent presses the safety switch on the \"cutoff\" device, which removes \"Kator's\" superpowers from Draper, and Superboy removes the memory of Draper ever being Kator.<ref>{{cite web|author=DarkMark |url=http://darkmark6.tripod.com/superboyind3.htm |title=Superboy index, part 3 |publisher=Darkmark6.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://obscure.dcuguide.com/m.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520042837/http://obscure.dcuguide.com/m.htm |archivedate=2006-05-20 }}</ref>\n\nIn the Post-''Crisis'' comics, Carl Draper first appeared in ''Adventures of Superman'' #517 (Nov. 1994). This was during the \"Dead Again\" storyline, when Superman was suspected of being an impostor after his body was found still in his tomb (from ''[[The Death of Superman]]'' storyline). Draper was hired by [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] to design a holding cell for [[Conduit (comics)|Conduit]], when his daughter, Carla, asked him if he could build a prison that could hold even Superman. Draper initially designed a trap that only the real Superman could escape from, explaining this to Superman by way of a hologram of a costumed figure named '''Deathtrap'''. However, when Superman escaped the trap, Draper became obsessed with proving that he ''could'' capture the real thing. Of note, this version of Draper was dressed in casual wear, only getting an updated costume with chain-based attacks later.\n\nDraper made several other attempts to capture Superman, often programming the Deathtrap hologram in advance so he could publicly be elsewhere. On one occasion, in ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel]]'' #43 (April 1995), he programmed Deathtrap to appear during a Draper Security press conference and display how Draper's devices were being \"subverted\", thus both removing suspicion from him and acting as an advertisement for the company.\n\nIn ''Action Comics'' #739, Superman (in his blue energy form) was captured in an \"energy hobble\" by Deathtrap, now calling himself the '''Locksmith'''. At the end of the story, it was revealed to the reader that his daughter, Carla Draper, was running the hologram this time and that her father was unaware of this. The now costumed-Master Jailer was one of the villains along with [[Neutron (comics)|Neutron]] controlled by [[Manchester Black]] in the 2002 storyline \"Ending Battle\"; however, it was not clear that it was, in fact, Draper.\n\nCarl Draper appears in ''[[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]'' #17 (Oct. 2007). At some point, Checkmate discovered his multiple identities and used this to force him into becoming a security consultant, protecting Checkmate itself from attack. In the issue, he prevents numerous assaults on Checkmate headquarters and is promoted to head of security with the title '''Castellan'''. Although he has not told his superiors, he strongly suspects that Carla is involved in the attacks.

He turned vigilante, hunting down and lynching several escapees until he was thwarted by Kara; in overview his methods were overzealous, as he even murdered aliens that were not violent and wanted peaceful lives.

Joey then had his goons suspend his dead body from the basketball net in the gymnasium. With help from [[Peter Gambi]], Jefferson Pierce becomes Black Lightning, where he beats up Joey Toledo's men. Afterwards, Black Lightning grabs Joey and pressures him to tell him everything there is to know about the 100. He tells him to meet him at Garfield High's gymnasium at midnight. When Black Lightning goes to meet with Joey Toledo, he was caught by surprise when Joey had brought [[Merlyn (DC Comics)|Merlyn the Dark Archer]] with him to kill Black Lightning.

He is killed by a disguised Peter Gambi during his raid to make it look like [[#Lady Eve|Lady Eve]] ordered the hit.\n\n==K==\n===Adeline Kane===\n'''Adeline Kane''', formerly '''Adeline Wilson''', is best known as both the leader of the criminal organization the [[H.I.V.E.]] and the ex-wife of Slade Wilson, a.k.a. [[Deathstroke|Deathstroke the Terminator]]. An enemy of the [[Teen Titans]], Adeline makes her first appearance in ''New Teen Titans'' #34 (August 1983). She was brought up as a wealthy jet-setting playgirl, despite being trained by a father who had worked with Chinese guerrilla forces. But, after a traumatic first marriage at 19, she joined the U.S. military, where she met, trained, and married Slade Wilson. After Slade left the military, Slade and Adeline took up the socialite lifestyle Adeline had been raised into.\n\nUnbeknownst to her, Slade was using his hunting trips to gain clients for his mercenary side job, which resulted in the kidnapping and near-death of their younger son, [[Jericho (comics)|Joseph]]. Enraged and betrayed by Slade's prioritization of Deathstroke's honor code over their son's well-being, Adeline shot her husband and, when he survived, served him with divorce papers.\n\nGrant, who had idolized his father, rebelled against his mother and ran away to New York, where he ran into the Titans and ended up dying due to his alliance with the H.I.V.E. Slade vowed to pick up his dead son's contract against the Teen Titans; Adeline promptly interfered; she blamed Slade for Grant's death. Due to Adeline's intervention, Joseph, who had been working with her, joined the Titans as Jericho.\n\nJoseph eventually became possessed by the spirits of Azarath. Begging his father to kill him in order to prevent the corrupted spirits from achieving their purpose, Adeline's only remaining son died at her husband's hand. Adeline found this out from one of her Searchers Inc. agents, rather than from Slade himself, which merely cemented her long-held grudge against her ex-husband.\n\nSlade, however, held no grudge against her, keeping an eye out for her safety and attempting to aid her when he thought he could get away with it; e.g., when Adeline had been abducted by her first husband Morel, a.k.a. Count Tavolera, who had poisoned her in an attempt to force her to work with him to discover her ancestor Josiah Kane's treasure.\n\nTo save Adeline's life, Slade gave her some of his own serum-altered blood. This ended up driving her crazy; Slade's genotype had a unique mutation which enabled him to effectively metabolize his serum. Other less fortunate people either died or went insane.\n\nFor a time, Adeline went underground, slowly losing more and more of her normal cognitive abilities, though none of her tactical skills. She eventually turned herself into the H.I.V.E. Mistress, in her madness focusing on superheroes as the reason for her sons' death and creating a plan to kill all the superheroes that she could.\n\nHer plot ultimately resulted in her death. [[Vandal Savage]] put a team together to take advantage of Adeline's plan, intending to take her immortal blood to create a sort of Fountain of Youth potion. With her throat cut, unable to die and yet unable to fully heal, Adeline regained her sanity briefly and pleaded with Slade (who had learned of her involvement and arrived to try and save her) to kill her and reunite her with their children. However, because he still had feelings for her no matter what she had done, he was unable to comply with her request, so [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]] killed her instead.\n\n====Adeline Kane in other media====\nAdeline makes her live-action debut in the second season of ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'' portrayed by [[Mayko Nguyen]].\n\n===Kilg%re===\n*Creators: [[Mike Baron]] and Jackson Guice\n*First appearance: ''[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'' (vol. 2) #3 (August 1987)\n\n'''Kilg%re''' was an electro-mechano-organic intelligence that needed electro-life to survive. It consumed its entire home planet in the Pleides sector and then moved on into space. It was attacked by something known as Meta#sker and placed into a vibrational limbo. Somehow, it found its way to the flats near Salt Lake City on Earth. It could only be seen by people traveling at high speeds, such as an F-15 pilot or the Flash. The Flash unknowingly released it from the limbo it was imprisoned in and it followed him to S.T.A.R. Labs and took over its electrical systems. Kilg%re found the number of machines on Earth ideal for its survival, but humans it deemed distractions and planned to destroy them. It delivered an ultimatum: abandon North America by 12:00 noon on May 10 or be destroyed. During a battle with the Flash in Salt Lake City, it turned out all the power in the country. The Flash sought the help of Cyborg, who used the Titans' satellite to relay the message to the governments of the world to shut down all power in order to kill Kilg%re. This scared it out of the power grid and it weaved a giant mechanical snake across the Utah flats, trying to complete a circuit by catching up with the cloned body of S.T.A.R. Labs' Dr. Schmitz in order to survive. However, the Flash outraced it, supposedly killing it. After Kilg%re's defeat at the hands of the Flash he appeared to be destroyed, but resurfaced in the form of a sentient computer mind hidden in a self-created computer operating system in a deep cave. When [[Maxwell Lord]] was spelunking one day, his then-president had fallen deep into the cave where Kilg%re lay dormant. Sensing a human life, Kilg%re decided to help coax Max into further succeeding his own plans, as well as Max's subconscious plans of self-actualization. To do this, Kilg%re decided to help Max start the new Justice League and grow the group into becoming more international. Kilg%re served in a behind-the-scenes role, constantly coaxing and manipulating Max into furthering his plans, such as gaining money, power and cutting-edge technology to give Kilg%re a stronger machine to inhabit. Through such advantages, Kilg%re and Max were able to create a better duplicate of the Justice League signal device, begin a recruitment drive and find willing villains, gaining additional muscle such as Booster Gold and a new Ace android. Kilg%re grew impatient and decided to start using bigger ideas, such as inciting an international incident to distract Justice League International. To do this, he found hidden technologies designed as a monitoring device by Metron. He launched the satellite, which was only defeated by Mister Miracle because he was used to New God technology. A serious mishap occurred during the Millenium event, in which the Manhunters took over the bodies of those they deemed were close enough to major figures to do damage. One of these Manhunters took over the body of the secretary of Max and, when she delivered coffee to him, she shot him four times. Rushing to Max's safety, Kilg%re promptly eliminated the threat by combining some of his technology with Max in order to save his life and kill the Manhunter. Max eventually learned of Kilg%re's tampering when half of Kilg%re was destroyed by the construct falling through the building that housed Kilg%re. In Kilg%re's fleeting moments, he threw another series of visions designed to tamper with Max's thoughts and implant Kilg%re into another larger system. Max refused and destroyed what was left of Kilg%re's last computing body. Doing so removed the cyborg self-repairing systems in Max's body, which landed him in the hospital. Kilg%re, however, was not completely destroyed.\n\nKilg%re appeared in ''[[DC Rebirth]]''{{'}}s ''[[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]'' #01, 02 and 18 and ''The Flash/[[Speed Buggy]] Special'' #1.\n\n====Powers and abilities of Kilg%re====\nKilg%re has a robot body, electrokinesis, electronic interaction, electronic disruption, electronic constructs, and superhuman speed.\n\n====Kilg%re in other media====\n* A different depiction of Kilg%re appears in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', portrayed by [[Dominic Burgess]].

Ramsey was one of the 12 passengers on the bus which was hit by dark matter when the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash/Barry Allen]] escaped the Speed Force, becoming a metahuman who can control and manipulate technology. In the episode \"Mixed Signals\", Ramsey, taking the name \"Kilg%re\", used his powers to take revenge on his former teammates, killing one and nearly doing the same to the others, until he was stopped by Team Flash and remanded to Iron Heights. In the episode \"True Colors\", Kilg%re is among the metahuman inmates at Iron Heights Penitentiary that Warden Wolfe planned to sell to Blacksmith. When Warden Wolfe outs Barry's true identity to Blacksmith, [[Dwarfstar]], [[Hazard (DC Comics)|Hazard]], Kilg%re, and [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Black Bison|Black Bison]], they prepare to attack, only for the Thinker to arrive and absorb the powers of the four metahumans while killing them.\n* Kilg%re appears in the tie-in comic ''[[Justice League Adventures]]'' #28.\n* Kilg%re appears in the tie-in comic ''[[Green Lantern: The Animated Series]]'' #14.\n\n===King Cobra===\nThere have been at least two different characters named the '''King Cobra''' in [[DC Comics]].\n\n====Batman villain====\nThe King Cobra is a mob boss in Gotham City who wears a green snake costume.

The character, created by [[James Owsley]] and [[Jim Aparo]], first appeared in ''Batman'' #431 (March 1989). Within the context of the stories, Kirigi taught [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]] the art of [[ninjitsu]] when Bruce approached him for martial arts training. He was later hired by [[Ra's al Ghul]] to train members of the [[League of Assassins]] in ninjitsu. Batman visited Kirigi when he recognized some of the moves done by the League of Assassins members that Kirigi taught him.\n\n====Kirigi in other media====\nKirigi appears in the video game ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', voiced by [[Kaiji Tang]]. He is featured in the \"Initiation\" DLC challenge map. Before he becomes Batman, Bruce Wayne approaches his dojo in the mountains of North Korea and asks Kirigi to train him. Kirigi lets him train with him and his students for a while out of pity and later tests him to see if he is worthy. Depending on how the player operates Bruce Wayne during this performance, there are three different endings after Bruce Wayne defeats [[Lady Shiva]]. If the player completes the challenge map with less than nine medals, Kirigi states that Bruce is the best foreigner that he has trained, yet he does not say much. Kirigi then sends Bruce to find a bucket and broom in order to clean the latrines. If the player completes the challenge map with nine or more medals, Kirigi is impressed with Bruce's progress, yet states that he still has a lot to learn. For the time being, Kirigi then sends Bruce to find a rag in order to clean the floors. If the player completes the challenge map with all 15 medals, Kirigi states to Bruce that he is impressed and, at the same time, also states that he is rarely impressed. Upon telling Bruce that he has gained his dojo's respect and proven himself worthy, Kirigi states that he will be given the information that he seeks. Bruce is sent to the kitchen by Kirigi to prepare tea for him and all of Kirigi's students, where there is much to discuss.\n\n===Komodo===\n{{Comics character list header\n|name = Komodo\n|CBDBid =\n|GCDid = Simon+Lacroix\n}}\n'''Komodo''' ('''Simon Lacroix''') first appears in ''[[Green Arrow]]'' (vol. 5) #17 (April 2013).<ref>''Green Arrow'' (vol. 5) #17 (April 2013)</ref><ref name=\"Guide\" />{{rp|170}} He was created by writer [[Jeff Lemire]] and artist [[Andrea Sorrentino]]. Komodo was once Robert Queen's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and was part of Robert's expedition to find the \"Arrow Totem\", which was said to bring enlightenment. Seeking this enlightenment for himself, Lacroix betrayed and murdered Robert, but could not find the Totem. Consumed by his desire for the Totem's enlightenment, Lacroix strove to destroy Oliver Queen and the Green Arrow and became the masked archer \"Komodo\". Through his company Stellmoor International, he works on behalf of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], a shadowy secret society of warriors from different weapon disciplines, which he wants to rule.<ref>''Green Arrow'' (vol. 5) #24</ref> Komodo travels with his equally deadly \"daughter\" [[Emiko Queen|Emiko]], who, in fact, is the daughter of Robert Queen and the archer [[Shado (DC Comics)|Shado]].

Barr]] and [[Alan Davis]], making her first appearance in ''Batman and the Outsiders'' #24 (Aug. 1985).\n\nLittle is known about Lady Eve's past, but she first met the terrorist cult leader [[Kobra (DC Comics)|Kobra (Jeffrey Burr)]] in [[Egypt]] where she nursed him back to health. In gratitude, Kobra offered Eve to join him in exchange for a better life. She accepted and eventually became Kobra's lover, as well as a high-ranking member of the Kobra Cult. She and Kobra once hatched a plot to brainwash top officials of the [[U.S. Army]] and steal a satellite defense program to blackmail the [[United States government]], but [[Batman]] and the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] eventually stopped them both.<ref>''Batman and the Outsiders'' #25\u201327 (Sept.-Nov. 1985)</ref>\n\nLady Eve would later assemble a second incarnation of [[Strike Force Kobra]].

Lady Eve was shown to be revived offscreen and is the head of the Ultimate O business where she starts to develop some competition with Lala and the remnants of the 100.\n\n===Lillian Luthor===\n'''Lillian Luthor''' (portrayed by [[Alisen Down]]) was the mother of Alexander Luthor and Julian Luthor, as well as the wife of [[Lionel Luthor]].\n\n====''Smallville''====\nLillian had a long and prolific role in the TV series ''[[Smallville]]''.\n\nLillian came from a wealthy family. How she met Lionel is unclear, but they were married sometime before the 1980s. By all accounts, Lillian was a caring, beautiful and sophisticated person, as well as comments made by Lex and Lionel have indicated that she had a spirited personality, had ambitions of her own and often stood up to Lionel.\n\nEventually, Lillian began to wonder about the special projects that Lionel had. She searched for answers and found something called \"Veritas\". However, Alexander saw her going through his father's briefcase, so Lillian asked him not to tell anyone. When Lionel found out, he immediately blamed Alexander and forced him to tell the truth. When Alexander did, Lillian insisted Lionel explain what Veritas was, but Lionel knocked her to the floor instead and warned her not to look into his projects again. Lillian felt angered and disgusted by Alexander's betrayal.\n\nSometime later, Lillian became ill with a heart condition that worsened over the rest of her life. Lionel hired a nurse named Rachel Dunleavy to assist her. Rachel and Lionel subsequently had an affair, resulting in the birth of Lionel's illegitimate son, Lucas. It is unclear whether Lillian knew of the affair or the child.\n\nLillian was helped by a nanny, Pamela Jenkins, who Alexander regarded as a second mother. Lionel was often absent from home and Lillian insisted that he take Alexander on one of his business trips to Smallville during the meteor shower of 1989. Lionel's resulting shame and constant critique of Alexander bothered Lillian greatly.\n\nSometime in the early 1990s, Lionel insisted that they have another child, an idea that Lillian was highly opposed to, presumably because of her poor health. However, when Alexander was 11, Lillian became pregnant again. She insisted that Alexander be allowed to come home for school from Excelsior Academy and Lionel complied. Her pregnancy was strenuous and Lillian was bedridden for much of it. On Alexander's disastrous 12th birthday (which no one attended), Lillian gave him a lead box allegedly made from the armor of St. George, which he kept into adulthood and later gave to Clark Kent.\n\nAfter baby Julian's birth, Lillian descended into a deep case of postpartum depression, refusing to hold the child and crying perpetually. One evening, Lionel sent the baby's nanny home and insisted that Lillian bond with the child. Lillian expressed her concern that Lionel would pit the two boys against each other and announced that she wanted a divorce, a threat that she had apparently made many times and that Lionel had called \"tiresome\".\n\nOn returning home from work one night, Lionel discovered Alexander in the baby's nursery. Alexander immediately apologized and confessed to accidentally killing Julian while trying to stop him from crying. Lionel erupted into a fierce rage and struck Alexander. Their relationship never recovered, even after he became an adult. It was not until years later, after receiving experimental therapy to recall repressed memories, that he remembered that Lillian had in fact smothered the baby during one of her delusions, hoping to spare him from Lionel's maltreatment. Alexander took the blame, correctly assuming that his father would cover it up in order to protect his sole heir, although he would probably be less inclined to do so for his wife.\n\nSometime before her death Lillian, along with Lex and Lionel, went to a ranch in Montana to spend time together. During that time, a snake spooked Lillian's horse, prompting Lionel to save her and wait on her until she was better.\n\nAfter Julian's death, Lillian's health rapidly deteriorated and she died several months later in the spring of 1993 when Alexander was 13. He later confessed to Clark that he was in denial about her impending death and spent the time researching treatments and doctors instead of being with her. Lex also told Lana Lang that he was away at boarding school when Lillian died and found out about her passing from reporters who had sneaked into his school.\n\nLillian left her shares of LuthorCorp to her son and Pamela.\n\nLillian's death was extremely influential in the adult Lex's life. He had visions of his mother on many occasions. When Lex was shot and ended up in a coma, he had a near-death experience. In it, Lillian visited him and showed Lex an alternate life of happiness that he could have if he would simply walk away from Lionel and LuthorCorp. However, at the end of the vision, Lana (his dream wife) suffered complications during childbirth. Because of Lex's lack of resources and estrangement from his father, he was unable to transfer Lana to a better facility and she died: this led Lex to believe that Lana died because he lacked enough money and power: with these, everything else in life could be secured. As a result, Lex ignored his mother's warning and continued his lifestyle of deceit and corruption. After realizing this, Lillian was seen in the reflection of a hospital window crying over her son's choice.\n\nWhen Lex was injected with the Limbo drug, which placed its users in a state of \"clinical death\", he met Lillian again, who told him that she was angry with him for ignoring her advice.\n\nWhen Lex was shot and went into a coma, Clark Kent and Lionel used a machine that allowed Clark to enter Lex's mind in order to find Lois Lane and Kara Kent. In Lex's mind, Clark met a young version of Lex and the two hid from a psychotic and murderous adult Lex. In the memory featuring Lillian snooping in Lionel's briefcase, Clark witnessed Lionel's verbal and physical abuse of both Lex and Lillian, as well as watched Lex try to help his mother up, but Lillian uncharacteristically told him that he had done enough and walked away from him.\n\n====Lillian Luthor in comics====\nIn DC Comics, Lex Luthor's mother is named '''Arlene Luthor'''. In later incarnations, her name was changed to '''\"Leticia\"''' even though she remained unnamed in most of her appearances.\n\n====Lillian Luthor in other media====\nLillian Luthor (known as '''the Doctor''') appears in ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', portrayed by [[Brenda Strong]]. Dr. Lillian Luthor is a scientist, the leader of [[Project Cadmus]], the wife of the late Lionel Luthor, the mother of [[Lex Luthor]] and the adoptive mother of [[Lena Luthor]].\n\n===Lunkhead===\nLunkhead is an enemy of [[Batman]] who became an inmate at [[Arkham Asylum]]. Lunkhead was clearly stupid, but exhibited massive strength; he made an enemy of [[Ventriloquist (comics)#Arnold Wesker|Arnold Wesker]] when he smashed Wesker's companion \"Scarface\". He was sacrificed to the devil by a pack of demons, along with many others, when the Ventriloquist threw his voice to make it seem as though Lunkhead was volunteering to be thrown into the fiery pit with the rest of the damned.\n\n====Lunkhead in other media====\n* Lunkhead appears in ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', voiced by [[JB Blanc]]. He is a reformed criminal who was beaten into a coma for two months by Batman. He was part of a therapy program in [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] alongside Margaret Sorrow. Lunkhead was released and has been a reformed criminal. Lieutenant [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] asks him about Margaret, bribing him with chocolate.\n* Lunkhead appears in the ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'' episode \"A Dark Knight: One of My Three Soups\", portrayed by Hank Strong. This version is an African-American [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] and had known Jerome Valeska's uncle Zachary Trumble. When he showed up to assist Zachary, Jerome spilled some soup on him. Upon Bruce Wayne arriving, he fought against Lunkhead and defeated him.\n\n==M==\n===Matches Malone===\n{{Comics character list header\n| debut = ''Batman'' #242\n| debutmo = June\n| debutyr = 1972\n| creators = [[Dennis O'Neil]], [[Irv Novick]], [[Dick Giordano]]\n| name = Matches Malone\n| CBDBid = 9795\n| GCDid = Matches+Malone\n}}\n'''Matches Malone''' was originally a Gotham gang boss who [[Batman]] attempted to recruit to help him take down [[Ra's al Ghul]]. When he was accidentally killed by a ricocheting bullet that was meant for Batman, Batman began to impersonate him to use his underworld contacts and to fool Ra's.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=9780345501066 |pages=245-247}}</ref>\n\nPost-''Crisis'', he was a relatively small-time arsonist with his brother Carver and who came to [[Gotham City]] early on in [[Batman]]'s career, attracting Batman's attention when Carver was apparently murdered. Although Matches was the prime suspect, there was no concrete evidence to make the charges stick and Matches was released, only for Batman to subsequently find what appeared to be Matches' dead body in another fire, apparently a suicide. However, Batman never reported the death; at the time, he had been attempting to establish a criminal alias for himself to help him gather information, but the exclusive nature of the criminal sects meant that no one would recruit someone that they had not heard of, prompting him to adopt Matches' identity and use it for his own.\n\nHowever, years later, Batman learned the truth about what had happened. Carver's death had actually been a suicide prompted by his guilt over a fire that he and Matches had started that resulted in the death of a homeless man resting in the building they had torched, with Matches making the body look like a murder victim because he was ashamed of his brother's suicide. Subsequently, deciding to escape Batman stalking him for the crime, Matches used the body of their earlier victim to fake his own death, with Batman being so eager to establish his criminal alias that he never took the time to definitively confirm the body's identity. After operating underground for years by committing low-end robberies, Matches returned to Gotham after hearing reports of 'his' activities, only to be shot by [[Ventriloquist (comics)#Arnold Wesker|Scarface]] for 'his' recent betrayal, surviving long enough to simply confess his role in events to Batman and [[Nightwing]] before dying, with his last request being that Batman bury him next to his brother Carver.\n\nHaving destroyed Scarface in 'revenge' for Matches' death, Batman commented to Nightwing later on that he continued using the Matches identity because, in the years he had spent playing Matches, he had come to recognize that Matches was not an evil man, but had done some bad things that he never had the chance to make up for, regarding his use of Matches' name as a chance to give Matches some absolution.\n\nThe \"Matches Malone\" identity indirectly caused the events of ''[[Batman: War Games]]''; after she was fired as Robin, [[Stephanie Brown (character)|Stephanie Brown]] attempted to implement an old plan of Batman's that would allow him to take control of the city's criminal organisations, hoping that this would impress Batman enough to convince him to take her back. Unfortunately, she was unaware that Batman's agent who was meant to take control of the meeting, Matches Malone, was actually Batman himself, resulting in tensions between the crime families flaring up and most of them being killed in the subsequent stand-off, leading into the subsequent gang wars and Stephanie's own apparent death.\n\nIn ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' comic book series, Batman uses the Matches Malone guise against the False Face Society and a backstory reveals Malone was a low-level enforcer for [[Rupert Thorne]] who agreed to become a snitch for Batman and [[Commissioner Gordon]] against Thorne. But, when Malone began skimming cash from Thorne, he was shot to death by \"two Chicago triggers\" who go by the monikers Dapper (for always dressing well) and Cricket (for his short wiry build). Upon finding the dying Malone and being told that his killers went to a well-known Chinese restaurant, Batman removed his glasses\u2014and was shocked by what Malone looked like. Batman took Malone's guise, defeated the two hitmen and sent them to prison, and has used the guise ever since.\n\n====Matches Malone in other media====\n* The character, renamed '''Matthew \"Matches\" Malone''', is used in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' as an alias by [[Batman]] (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]). In the episode \"[[Chill of the Night!]]\", Batman uses the name variation during a trip to the past with the [[Phantom Stranger]] to see [[Thomas Wayne]] and [[Martha Wayne]] years before their deaths and unaware that Malone is their grown son. In the episode \"The Mask of Matches Malone!\", Batman gets amnesia while in his Matches Malone persona and believes himself to actually be a gangster.\n* The character appears, renamed '''Patrick \"Matches\" Malone''', in the live-action ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'' TV series, portrayed by Danny Schoch in his first masked appearance and by [[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]] in the second appearance. This version is a philosophical hitman-for-hire who is one of Gotham City's deadliest murderers and was an old partner of [[Mutants (DC Comics)|Mutants]] leader Terence \"Cupcake\" Shaw. He is the masked man in shiny shoes who killed Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne in front of Bruce Wayne and [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]] (who was watching from the highest part of the fire escape), taking [[Joe Chill]]'s place in the comics and most adaptations. This has led Detective [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] into finding him in order to bring to justice. [[Silver St. Cloud]] revealed the killer's identity to be Patrick. When Bruce finally confronts Patrick, Patrick stated that he was tired of doing bad things, while barely recalling if he killed Bruce's parents and Bruce decides not to kill Patrick. Using the gun that Bruce left behind, Patrick committed suicide by the time Gordon caught up with Bruce. Gordon and [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] were left wondering who could have hired Malone to kill Thomas and Martha (which was eventually revealed to be [[Hugo Strange]]).\n\n===Menagerie===\n{{Infobox comics character| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| image=\n| caption=Sonja shapeshifting, art by [[Doug Mahnke]]\n| character_name=Menagerie\n| real_name=Pamela<br>Sonja\n| publisher=[[DC Comics]]\n| debut='''Pamela:''' ''Action Comics'' #[[What's So Funny About Truth, Justice & the American Way?|775]] (March 2001)<br>'''Sonja:''' ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #100 (August 2004)\n| creators= [[Joe Kelly (writer)|Joe Kelly]] and [[Doug Mahnke]]\n| alliances=[[Justice League]]<br/>[[The Elite (DC Comics)|The Elite]]\n| aliases=\n| powers=Controls symbiotic alien parasites\n}}\n'''Menagerie''' is a name shared by two [[anti-hero]]ines in the [[DC Universe]], both members of [[The Elite (DC Comics)|the Elite]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=241}}</ref> The two are [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] sisters who are linked with a [[symbiotic]] alien weapon cr\u00e8che called symbeasts. Menagerie appears in ''[[Superman vs. The Elite]]'', voiced by [[Melissa Disney]] and ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', played by Jessica Meraz.\n\nPamela first appears in ''Action Comics'' #[[What's so funny about Truth, Justice & the American Way?|775]] (March 2001). While the origins of her powers are unclear in ''Action Comics'' #775, [[Manchester Black]] states that the rogue [[Men in Black]] (from the [[Department of Extranormal Operations]]) once picked up the dregs of society, turning them into weapons and selling them off to the highest alien bidder. Black recruits Pam to be a member of the Elite. This group takes it upon themselves to \"free the Earth of scum\". They come into conflict with [[Superman]] during their first mission and Superman disables them following a showdown on Jupiter's moon, Io. The Elite are delivered into custody, but soon released by President [[Lex Luthor]].<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #593\u2013594</ref> During an assassination attempt on Luthor, Menagerie reveals to Superman that the Elite are acting against their wills.

Upon Black's apparent death, his sister, [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Vera Black|Vera Black]], takes it upon herself to clear the family name and reassembles the Elite as a force for good. As Sister Superior she convinces Pamela's sister, Sonja, to assume control of the alien cache as the second Menagerie. Vera then approaches the [[Justice League|JLA]] with a proposition to form a sort of [[black op]]s JLA team: [[Justice League Elite]].<ref>''JLA'' #100</ref> Sonja's hatred of Manchester Black becomes a hatred of the Elite. Sonja sees this as her opportunity to kill Vera's dream, so she plays along and joins the team. In their first mission, Menagerie secretly coaxes [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Coldcast|Coldcast]] into killing the foreign terrorist dictator, Hi-Shan Bhat.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #1\u20133</ref> Menagerie lays low during the fallout and puts effort into her personal relationship with Coldcast. The two become lovers and are drawn together by their shared affection for Pamela. Then, while most of the Elite goes underground, Vera is finally fully overtaken by the disembodied Manchester Black.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #4\u20137</ref>\n\nWhile Black threatens Earth with a [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|Fourth World]] god, Menagerie goes missing and Coldcast is arrested by the JLA for Bhat's murder. Coldcast confesses to the murder and is taken to the Slab prison. There he is visited by the spirit of the recently departed [[Manitou Raven]], who frees him from Menagerie's control.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #10\u201311</ref> Coldcast is exonerated and the team tracks Sonja to Costa Rica. She is taken into JLA custody, deprived of the aliens, and begins a gradual separation that they hope will sever her connection to the symbeasts.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #12</ref>\n\n====Powers and abilities of Menagerie====\nThe symbeasts can be assembled to shift over the host to form various shapes and weapons such as claws, spikes or whips. Most commonly, they form around the body and take the form of wings, enabling Menagerie to fly. She can also instruct them to take other forms, or detach from her body and operate independently. One creature has a bite that can force its victims to tell the truth. According to Vera Black, there is also a creature among the creche that can create bio-electric bursts. Menagerie has acidic blood as well and Sonja often allows herself to get hurt by her opponents as a combat tactic.\n\n====Menagerie in other media====\nMenagerie appears in ''[[Superman vs. The Elite]]'', voiced by [[Melissa Disney]].\n\nA variation of the Pamela version of Menagerie appears in her self-titled ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' episode portrayed by Jessica Meraz. In this show, '''Pamela Ferrer''' is a jewel thief who got bonded to a snake-like alien, transforming her into Menagerie. After she killed her partner Chuck and some other people, Menagerie was confronted by Supergirl, the Martian Manhunter, Brainiac 5, and [[Alex Danvers]]. Their fight attracted the attention of the Children of Liberty. When Menagerie planned to rob the masquerade ball, she encountered [[Nia Nal]] and Supergirl and George Lockwood show up. While she did manage to subdue Supergirl, the snake-like alien on Menagerie was beheaded by George. President Baker made an example out of Menagerie and had her incarcerated. While in her cell, Menagerie received a pleasing letter from Manchester Black.

Unfortunately, that same fire destroyed most of his body, and he was forced to wear a containment suit in order to prevent himself from destroying everything he touched. The Russian government then maneuvered him into position to be one of its premier heroes, placing him into a battle against the original [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], who was then calling for complete nuclear disarmament.\n\nThe battle raged for a time between the two heroes, until a nuclear weapon was dropped on the duo while they fought in the Nevada desert. From that debacle arose a new Firestorm, in which Mikhail played a crucial role, along with the original two members of the Firestorm Matrix, Martin Stein and [[Ronnie Raymond]]. He continued as a member of Firestorm in another incarnation, as an Elemental, but was eventually removed from the Firestorm Matrix so that Martin alone could bear the powers. Ronnie and Mikhail returned to their homes, de-powered.\n\nDuring the \"In My Father's House\" storyline in the most recent ''Firestorm'' series, it was revealed that Mikhail is, in fact, once again in control of his former abilities. He was re-powered by a nuclear test gone wrong in Russia.

At Koshmar, Arkadin tortures Palmer and Rory in order to get Stein to divulge his knowledge of Firestorm.

Arkadin attempts to contain the prisoners, but [[Leonard Snart (Arrowverse)|Leonard Snart]] pushes him into a cell with a prisoner named Boris, who proceeds to beat him up.

His [[xenophobia]] led him to a group of [[White supremacy|white supremacists]] in the American desert, who he forced into worshiping him and his views. However, in time, the people of \"God's Peake\" (as the camp was called) came to worship Preus as their cult leader. His increasing prominence eventually led both the [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Jimmy Olsen]] to investigate, only to have both of them captured by Preus and his men.<ref>''Action Comics'' #821 (January 2005)</ref>\n\nThis forced a confrontation with Superman, who, at the time, was dealing with the effects of [[Gog (DC Comics)|Gog]]'s synthetic yellow [[kryptonite]], which had significantly aged and weakened Superman in a short period of time. So weakened, Superman was barely able to deal with Preus' legions alone and quickly found himself outclassed by the (at the time) much more vital Preus.<ref>''Action Comics'' #822 (February 2005)</ref>\n\nA last-ditch gambit using kryptonite to try and weaken Preus failed, as Preus revealed a previously unknown resistance to kryptonite. However, he was finally defeated when Superman attacked and destroyed a key portion of Preus' armor, rendering him unconscious. Afterwards, Preus was injured from that attack and had to be hospitalized. His current whereabouts are unknown. He was last seen as a weakened Superman tried to fly him to [[S.T.A.R.

Preus disappeared after Superman was engaged by an army of Gogs.<ref>''Action Comics'' #825 (May 2005)</ref>\n\n====Powers and abilities of Preus====\nPreus possesses powers similar to those of Superman, such as superhuman strength and speed, flight, invulnerability, X-ray vision and enhanced senses. Unlike Superman, Preus can fire beams of black energy from his eyes that strike a target with intense heat and force. Preus also does not share Superman's vulnerability to [[kryptonite]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Psiphon===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity.

The group was responsible for many vampire concentration camps as they attempted to exterminate all the vampires in Markovia. Nina was able to survive their efforts and escaped to America. This left her with a deep distrust of humans, who she called \"breathers\" or \"normals\".\n\nAfter making it to America, she was captured by R-Complex, a government agency that subjected her to numerous experiments. She was eventually rescued by the efforts of Arnold Burnsteel and Fate. The pair also freed Fang, Slither, and Gross-Out. Burnsteel suggested the group form a band to serve as cover while they try to outrun R-Complex agents.\n\nThe Scream Queen met Catwoman on one occasion. The pair battled Graveyard Shift members and an elder vampire in Gotham City. Nina was forced to kill the vampire to save Catwoman's life.

Williams II]].\n\n'''Mr. Auerbach''' (first appearance in ''Flash'' (vol. 2) #238 (May 2008)), was the son of a media mogul whose holdings included the cable news network KN News. He pursued a career in journalism, hoping to work his way up in his father's company. While working on a story, he met Edwar Martinez, who was capable of sensing the fears in others and making them a reality.\nAuerbach eventually was put in charge of KN News, where he had a hand in determining much of the content that the network covered.\n\nHe also led a double life as the villain '''Spin'''. He kept Edwar captive in the basement of the news building, hooking him up to machines and forcing him to watch news coverage. In this setting, Spin was able to channel and direct Edwar's amazing ability.\n\nHis first caper was robbing a Faberg\u00e9 egg from a local auction. He created a distraction by summoning earthquakes, which had been in the public's mind due to a recent quake in [[Hub City (comics)|Hub City]].\n\nHe took advantage of a comment made on television by the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] expressing his financial woes. After the citizens of [[Keystone City]] started to feel some doubt about their local hero, Spin lured him to the Keystone City Salamanders stadium and forced him to steal many valuables from the fans there. This causes a massive public outcry against the Flash, which Spin enhances with his powers, even turning the original Flash against his successor.\n\nWhen Spin and Edwar realized that the Flash had identified the source of the disturbances as emanating from KN News, he used his abilities to summon [[Gorilla Grodd]] to Keystone, the Rogue which Edwar sensed would make the speedster most anxious. Grodd, however, was not pleased with his sudden teleportation and a massive battle ensued. In the chaos, Edwar was released from his machinery and his powers went completely out of control, causing citizens to act out nearly every situation being mentioned in the media.\n\n====Equipment of Spin====\nSpin has a vast array of equipment set up in the basement of the KN News building, where he keeps Edwar Martinez. By forcing Edwar to watch news coverage, he is able to direct and control Edwar's ability to sense specific anxieties in the public consciousness and turn them into reality.\n\nSpin wears a costume with a television screen for a face. Usually static appears on the screen, but when channeling Edwar's powers, the face of his victim or a phrase describing his actions may appear. He can summon this costume by uttering the words \"Load theme\".\n\n====Spin in other media====\nIn ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' [[The Flash (season 5)|season five]], a female version of Spin named '''[[Spencer Young]]''' (portrayed by Kiana Madeira) appears as a young millennial with a blog app dedicated to metahumans. She used to work with [[Iris West]] and now has a rivalry with her competing blog. During the Enlightenment, Young's cellphone was hit with debris from [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]]'s satellite, turning it into meta-tech capable of controlling people's minds. After [[Nora West-Allen|XS]] appears in Central City, Young decides to make her blog more popular by creating headlines starring her and reporting them seconds before they happen. Her plan is eventually thwarted by the Flash and she is remanded to Iron Heights. In that same episode, it is shown that Spin and XS are attracted to each other. In the episode \"Gone Rogue\", Spin's cellphone is stolen by XS and given to [[Bug-Eyed Bandit|Brie Larvan]] as a new way for her to control her robotic bees.\n\n===Stalnoivolk===\n{{Comics character list header\n|debut = ''[[Firestorm the Nuclear Man]]'' #67\n|debutmo = January\n|debutyr = 1988\n|creators = [[John Ostrander]] and [[Joe Brozowski]]\n|abilities = Superhuman strength, durability and longevity\n|alias = Ivan Illyich Gort\n|name = Stalnoivolk\n|CBDBid = 7837\n|GCDid = Stalnoivolk\n}}\n'''Stalnoivolk''' ({{lang|ru|\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043a}} or \"Steel Wolf\") is a [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Universe]].\n\nThe character, created by [[John Ostrander]] and [[Joe Brozowski]], first appeared in ''[[Firestorm the Nuclear Man]]'' #67 (January 1988).\n\nWithin the context of the stories, Ivan Illyich Gort is a Russian born in the 1900s who underwent government experiments during [[World War II]].

She is later chosen by the Black Canary to help reform the Birds of Prey, but later betrays the group.\n\n====Starling in other media====\n* The character later appears in the TV series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' as '''Evelyn Crawford Sharp''', played by Madison McLaughlin. Introduced in season four, she emerges as an impostor Black Canary following Laurel Lance's death. She was a star gymnast before her family became a [[H.I.V.E.]] test subject, leaving Evelyn as the only survivor. Knowing her idol had just died, she briefly took up the identity in her crusade against her parents' killer, more precisely his wife, before giving it up to save her hero's reputation as [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] under the guise, as Green Arrow advised her to do. In season five, Evelyn is recruited by Oliver to train and join Green Arrow's team of vigilantes, taking the codename '''Artemis''' (unlike the comic book version, who calls herself the Starling). Later, she betrays the team to [[Adrian Chase|Prometheus]] as a brief double agent upon learning of Oliver's past as the Hood. Apparently, she regrets to Oliver for betrayal during his captivity by Adrian who seemingly kills her, but this was revealed to be a deception in order to break Oliver psychologically. She later releases Black Siren (Laurel's Earth Two counterpart) and both of them, along with [[Talia al Ghul]], kidnap all members of Team Arrow, including police captain Quentin Lance and Oliver's son William, and take them to Lian Yu island in order to force Oliver into releasing Adrian from jail. Evelyn is seen keeping captured prisoners Thea, Felicity, Curtis and William's mother Samantha in cages with Talia.

It was found by, and bonded to, '''Matvei Rodor''', a [[black market]]eer. Rodor is in conflict with a corrupt [[Moscow]] prosecutor named Soliony and agrees to the Zuggernaut's offer of help in exchange for being its host.\n\nReturning to Moscow, they attack Soliony, who has been interrogating [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Pozhar|Mikhail Arkadin]].

She is beautiful, is married to a charismatic young politician ([[Kim Joo-hyuk]]), and her adolescent daughter who used to be a troublesome child is now doing better at school. Her husband, Kim Jong-chan decides to run for office against the powerful incumbent, No Jae-soon ([[Kim Eui-sung]]). A few days before the elections, Yeon-hong and Jong-chan's daughter, Kim Min-jin ([[Shin Ji-hoon]]) goes missing. At first, they assume she has run off to seek their attention as she had done before. However, Yeon-hong soon finds out that the friend Min-jin said she was going to meet does not exist. Then Yeon-hong learns from the school her daughter attends that she had an eccentric friend named Choi Mi-ok ({{ill|Kim So-hee (actress)|lt=Kim So-hee|ko|\uae40\uc18c\ud76c (2000\ub144)}}) and they were both bullied by their classmates. \n\nWhile questioning Mi-ok, Yeon-hong notices the girl is wearing an expensive watch that looks like her daughter's despite coming from a poor family. Yeon-hong becomes suspicious and tells this to Jong-chan. However, her husband is more preoccupied with his campaign. Yeon-hong then hacks into her daughter's email account and finds leaked examination papers sent by a young female teacher at her school. Yeon-hong knows the teacher since she once invited Jong-chan to the school as a guest speaker. The teacher eventually admits she leaked the papers but only to help Min-jin and Mi-ok improve their grades so that they can become popular to avoid getting bullied.\n\nAs the police detectives fail to find any leaks, a desperate Yeon-hong goes to a shaman to find her daughter. However, it is all too late when the police finds Min-jin's dead body in the woods. A traumatized Yeon-hong blames her husband for their daughter's murder to get the city's sympathy vote since he refuses to tell the detectives where he and his driver were during the night Min-jin went missing. Despite his daughter's murder, Jong-chan is convinced by his party's president to continue his campaign. \n\nYeon-hong continues with her own investigation and finds an abandoned building where Min-jin and Mi-ok would practice their music. Yeon-hong convinces the police to hypnotize her but it is not helpful. They then run a lie detector test on her which reveals she is lying when she denies burying Min-jin's body but passes when she confesses that she did not kill her best friend. It is then revealed that Mi-ok is actually the daughter of Jong-chan's driver. Yeon-hong theorizes that Mi-ok was jealous of Min-jin for being rich and killed her out of jealousy. However, she has no evidence to prove it. Yeon-hong then breaks into Min-jin and Mi-ok's secret hideout and finds money hidden away in a bag. When Mi-ok shows up, Yeon-hong captures her and forces her to tell the truth about Min-jin's murder. \n\nMi-ok finally reveals that she and Min-jin became best friends after discovering they both shared the same taste in music. Min-jin then starts to suspect their teacher is having an affair. They then give the teacher a car air freshener with a hidden camera inside, which records the teacher having wild sex in her car with her secret lover. Min-jin and Mi-ok then uses the recordings to blackmail their teacher for exam papers. Since Mi-ok's family is poor, Min-jin then blackmails the teacher for money. One night, the two girls are out playing in the rain when a car runs over Min-jun while Mi-ok is hiding in the bushes. While the driver exits the car to take a photo of Min-jun's dead body, Mi-ok sneaks into the car and runs over the killer as well. She then carries Min-jin's body away and buries it in the woods after taking the contract killer's phone with her. Mi-ok is sure her teacher arranged for her and Min-jun to be killed. Yeon-hong takes the phone and is shown hatching a plan to kill the person who sent the contract killer to murder her daughter.\n\nLater that day over dinner, Yeon-hong tells her husband that although No Jae-son most likely had nothing to do with their daughter's death, he must use the sympathy vote to win the election. Later that night, while her husband is celebrating his victory, Yeon-hong calls up the person who hired the contract killer and forces them to come to the scene of the crime or else she will leak the sex video onto the net. The person then shows up and it is not the teacher, but Jong-chan. Through flashbacks, we see that the man the teacher was having an affair with is none other than Jong-chan. After Min-jin blackmailed her teacher, the teacher told Jong-chan she is being blackmailed by two of her own students but does not tell him it is his own daughter and her best friend. Jong-chan unwittingly hired the contract killer to murder his own daughter. Yeon-hong ties her husband up and beats him in anger. She then uploads his sex video onto the internet as he watches helplessly.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Son Ye-jin]] as Kim Yeon-hong\n* [[Kim Joo-hyuk]] as Kim Jong-chan\n* Kim So-hee as Choi Mi-ok\n* [[Shin Ji-hoon]] as Kim Min-jin\n* [[Choi Yu-hwa]] as Son So-ra\n* [[Kim Min-jae (actor, born 1979)|Kim Min-jae]] as Secretary-general\n* Park Jin-woo as Chauffeur Choi\n* Moon Young-dong as Detective Nam\n* [[Kim Eui-sung]] as No Jae-soon\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Award\n!scope=\"col\"| Category\n!scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n!scope=\"col\"| Result\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=3|[[25th Buil Film Awards]]\n|Best Actress\n|[[Son Ye-jin]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|Best Director\n|rowspan=2|[[Lee Kyoung-mi]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|Best New Director\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=3|36th [[Korean Association of Film Critics Awards]]\n|Ten Best Films of the Year\n|''The Truth Beneath''\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|Best Director\n|[[Lee Kyoung-mi]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Best Actress\n|rowspan=3|[[Son Ye-jin]] \n| {{won}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |3rd Korean Film Producers Association Awards\n| {{won}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=2|17th Women in Film Korea Festival\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|Best Screenplay\n|[[Lee Kyoung-mi]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |11th Paris Korean Film Festival\n|Audience Award\n|rowspan=2|''The Truth Beneath''\n| {{won}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=2|17th [[Busan Film Critics Awards]]\n|Best Film\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Best Actress\n|rowspan=2|[[Son Ye-jin]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=2|22nd [[Chunsa Film Awards]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sedaily.com/NewsView/1OG24GWOR0|title=\u20182017 \ucd98\uc0ac\uc601\ud654\uc0c1\u2019 \ub098\ud64d\uc9c4, \ucd5c\uc6b0\uc218\uac10\ub3c5\uc0c1\u2026\ud558\uc815\uc6b0\u00b7\uc190\uc608\uc9c4 \ub0a8\ub140\uc8fc\uc5f0\uc0c1|date=25 May 2017|work=SE Daily}}</ref>\n|{{won}} \n|-\n|Best Screenplay\n|rowspan=2|[[Lee Kyoung-mi]]\n|{{won}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |31st [[Fribourg International Film Festival]]\n|Grand Prix\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{hancinema film|The_Truth_Beneath}}\n*{{IMDb title|tt5768474}}\n*{{kmdb film|15269|The Truth Beneath}}\n*''[http://movie.naver.com/movie/bi/mi/basic.nhn?code=125802 The Truth Beneath]'' at [[Naver|Naver Movies]] {{in lang|ko}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Truth Beneath}}\n[[Category:South Korean films]]\n[[Category:South Korean thriller films]]\n[[Category:2016 films]]\n[[Category:2010s thriller films]]\n[[Category:CJ Entertainment films]]\n\n\n{{SouthKorea-film-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n| name           = The Truth Beneath\n| image          = The Truth Beneath (\ube44\ubc00\uc740 \uc5c6\ub2e4).jpg\n| alt            = \n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| film name      = {{Film name\n| hangul         = \ube44\ubc00\uc740 \uc5c6\ub2e4\n| hanja          = \n| rr             = Bimileun Eopda}}\n| director       = [[Lee Kyoung-mi]]\n| producer       = Kim Yun-ho<br />Lee Mi-young\n| writer         = Lee Kyoung-mi<br />[[Park Chan-wook]]\n| based on       = \n| starring       = [[Son Ye-jin]]<br />[[Kim Joo-hyuk]]\n| music          = Jang Young-gyu\n| cinematography = Ju Sung-lim\n| editing        = [[Park Gok-ji]]\n| studio         = Film Train \n| distributor    = [[CJ Entertainment]]\n| released       = {{film date|2016|06|23}}\n| runtime        = 102 minutes\n| country        = South Korea\n| language       = Korean\n| budget         = \n| gross          = {{USD|1.9 million}}<ref name=\"the-numbers\">{{cite web|url=https://the-numbers.com/movie/Bi-mil-eun-Eop-da-%28South-Korea-2016%29#tab=summary|publisher=the-numbers.com|title=Bimileun Eopda (2016) - Financial Information|accessdate=2017-02-17}}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''The Truth Beneath''''' ({{ko-hhrm|\ube44\ubc00\uc740 \uc5c6\ub2e4||Bimileun Eopda}}, lit. \"There Is No Secret\") is a 2016 South Korean [[thriller film]] directed by [[Lee Kyoung-mi]], her second directorial outing after 2008's ''[[Crush and Blush]]''.

She performed many songs written by Vietnamese composer [[Tr\u1ecbnh C\u00f4ng S\u01a1n]] and rose to fame in the 1960s. Her last name was changed to Nguy\u1ec5n following her marriage to South Vietnam journalist Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng \u0110oan in 1975.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life===\nKh\u00e1nh Ly was born to a traditional family and grew up in [[Hanoi]]. As a child, she would fall asleep to her father's soothing voice. His serenades planted inside her a love for music, which grew stronger every day against her family's wishes. In 1954, at the age of 9, she entered a small contest in the city of Hanoi singing Th\u01a1 Ng\u00e2y; she did not win.\n\nBy 1956, she accompanied her mother to the southern regions of Vietnam. At the end of that very same year, she secretly entered a children's talent-search contest produced by Ph\u00e1p-\u00c1 production at Norodom Stage in Saigon. Mai traveled to the contest by sneaking into the back of transport trucks and hitching a ride from \u0110\u00e0 L\u1ea1t City to Saigon. She won second prize singing Pham Duy's famous song, Ng\u00e0y Tr\u1edf V\u1ec1. Mai lost to child-star Qu\u1ed1c Th\u1eafng who would also later become an iconic figure in the music world. She was only 11.\n\n===1962\u20131966: Debut===\nMai's musical career did not officially begin until she debuted at Club Anh V\u0169 on B\u00f9i Vi\u1ec7n Street in Saigon when she was only 17 (1962). At this point, she adopted the stage name Kh\u00e1nh Ly, a combination of Kh\u00e1nh K\u1ef5 and Y\u00eau Ly, both are characters from [[Chronicles of the Eastern Zhou Kingdoms]], her favorite novel. By the end of 1962, she relocated to \u0110\u00e0 L\u1ea1t and stayed there for four years performing at various clubs and resorts. Night after night, she serenaded lovers, tourists, and the youths of Vietnam.\nOn a rainy night in 1964, she met Tr\u1ecbnh C\u00f4ng S\u01a1n (TCS), at that time a young composer and a teacher at a school in B\u1ea3o L\u1ed9c. They became fast friends. Fascinated by her seductive voice, Trinh had asked her on several occasions to accompany him in his performances in Saigon. Still in love with the romantic hills of Da Lat, she declined.\n\n===1967\u20131975: Diva of Saigon===\nDuring a trip to [[Saigon]] in 1967, she ran into Tr\u1ecbnh on the busy streets of L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4n. After several serenades and coffee at a small shop called Qu\u00e1n V\u0103n, the legacy of Kh\u00e1nh Ly and Tr\u1ecbnh C\u00f4ng S\u01a1n had begun.\nWithin the next several decades, Kh\u00e1nh Ly and Tr\u1ecbnh C\u00f4ng S\u01a1n sang together at small coffee shops, clubs, and even on the steps of V\u0103n Khoa University in Saigon (a liberal arts school). During the escalation of an unwanted and bloody war, his anti-war lyrics in the Yellow-Skin Songs and her luring voice appealed to those who grew weary of the battles and bloodshed; their plea for peace propelled them to the top. From the educating fields of large universities to the unknown and endless farm lands, she was heard, known, and hailed as \"N\u1eef Ho\u00e0ng Ch\u00e2n \u0110\u1ea5t\" or \"N\u1eef Ho\u00e0ng S\u00e2n C\u1ecf.\" Together, Kh\u00e1nh Ly and Tr\u1ecbnh C\u00f4ng S\u01a1n took the Vietnamese music world by storm. Their phenomenal fame gave her the chance to be the first Vietnamese woman to headline her own show. During the late 1960s to early 1970s, she also collaborated with multiple production companies and played a large part on the recorded tracks from famous videos such as the Ph\u1ea1m M\u1ea1nh C\u01b0\u01a1ng Program, Tr\u01b0\u1eddng S\u01a1n Centre, S\u01a1n Ca Productions, Ho\u1ea1 Mi, Jo Marcel Productions, etc.\n\nUp until her emigration in 1975, Kh\u00e1nh Ly achieved unproportional fame around the world. She opened Club Kh\u00e1nh Ly on T\u1ef1 Do Street in Saigon along with a small shop named H\u1ed9i Qu\u00e1n C\u00e2y Tre, a gathering place for musicians and students alike. In addition, she was sponsored by the Vietnamese government to hold performances in Europe in order to promote the worldwide collaboration of the rising generation of Vietnamese students (\"N\u1ed1i V\u00f2ng Tay L\u1edbn\"). She also performed in the United States, Canada, and Japan at Osaka Fair in response to the invitation from Nippon Columbia Label (a large production company). Here, she recorded an album, featuring [[Tr\u1ecbnh C\u00f4ng S\u01a1n]]'s songs [[Di\u1ec5m X\u01b0a]] and [[Ca Dao M\u1eb9]] (sang in both languages), which went gold shortly after its debut. These songs became top hits in Japan and remained so for several decades. Kh\u00e1nh Ly was the first Vietnamese singer to achieve international fame.\n\n===1975\u2013present: Continue career after [[The Fall of Saigon]]===\nIn 1975, Kh\u00e1nh Ly, along with thousands of Vietnamese refugees, crossed the Pacific Ocean and settled in America. Like many, she struggled to find jobs on American soil to provide for her four children. Even though the first few years were difficult, Kh\u00e1nh Ly's renowned status did not fade from the music world. Within the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Khanh Ly was invited back to Japan on numerous occasions by [[Nippon Columbia Label]], [[Toci Film]], and Japanese largest television station to record and perform. Her second record with Nippon Columbia (1979) went gold short after its release; there were 2 million copies sold in Japan alone. Her third and final album with Nippon also featured classic hits such as Wandering Man. In addition, both Toci Film and Japanese largest television station featured her voice in the theme song to several movies and television series regarding Vietnam's culture as well as the \"Boat People\" phenomenon; her most notable recording was \"L\u1eddi Ru Cho \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng\" in 1987, music by Japanese artist Hako and words by former newspaper editor and Kh\u00e1nh Ly's husband, Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng Do\u00e3n. She was also featured in the Asian Music Festival held in Japan along with famous singers from Korea, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the South Pacific. Her fame in Japan continued to escalate when she was named one of the top 10 most famous people along the same line as Gandhi, Gucci, Martin Luther King Jr.s wife, among others. In 1996, Japan's television station NKH and famous producer Hideo Kado produced a short 50-minute documentary about the life of Kh\u00e1nh Ly which aired on 29 April 1997, 22 years from the day she left Saigon. In September of that year, [[NKH]] also published a 270-page biography about Kh\u00e1nh Ly.\n\nIn the later part of the 1980s and early 1990s, Kh\u00e1nh Ly traveled vigorously and performed in Russia, the Czech Republic, Poland, and in a concert in East Germany after the Berlin Wall was taken down in 1989. Being a devout Catholic, she also sang at many church-sponsored events in which her most memorable performance was at the Canonization of 117 Vietnamese Priests in Vatican City (1988) where she met Pope John Paul II. In 1992, during the World's Youth Festival in Denver Colorado, Kh\u00e1nh Ly had the honor of meeting the Pope for a second time. In 1996, she, several other renowned singers, and songwriter Tr\u1ea7m T\u1eef Thi\u00eang hosted a Charity Concert in order to raise money to build houses/shelters for 2000 Vietnamese refugees in the Philippines. They raised 2 million dollars, enough to establish a Vietnamese Village on a small island off of the coast of the Philippines.\n\nNow she is living comfortably with her husband, former newspaper editor/writer Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng Do\u00e3n in Cerritos, California, recording for Th\u00fay Nga-Paris by Night, Asia, May Productions, etc., touring the world, and co-owns her own production company, Kh\u00e1nh Ly Productions, which has produced more than 30 CDs, 4 videos, and several DVDs to date. Aside from her paid performances, she is also writing weekly columns for various Vietnamese newspaper and magazines throughout the world (H\u1ed3n Vi\u1ec7t, V\u0103n Ngh\u1ec7 T\u1ef1 Do, V\u0103n Ngh\u1ec7 Magazine, Th\u1eddi B\u00e1o, B\u00e1o Mai, etc.). Kh\u00e1nh Ly has also devoted the majority of her time to humanitarian acts and charitable organizations for Vietnamese orphans as well as Vietnamese refugees around the world.\nFor the past six decades, Kh\u00e1nh Ly has left a breathtaking legacy that she has written and is still writing for the next generation of Vietnam. She found music boldly, imprinted in history an irreplaceable voice that knows no parallel, and dazzled the world with her graceful, witty, and humble personality. For someone who is the voice of generations, she has only one simple wish:\n\"To breathe my last breath on the stage which gave me life....\"\nOn 9 May 2014, she had her first concert in [[Vietnam National Convention Center]], [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]] at which she performed many famous songs of hers to thousands of fans.\n\n==Personal life==\nShe was married the first time to [[Minh Di]] and had two children with him. Her second marriage was to [[Mai B\u00e1 Tr\u1ea1c]], a soldier of [[South Vietnam]] and they had a daughter. After his death in 1975, Kh\u00e1nh Ly moved on with [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng \u0110oan]], a Vietnamese journalist.

She performed many songs written by Vietnamese composer [[Tr\u1ecbnh C\u00f4ng S\u01a1n]] and rose to fame in the 1960s. Her last name was changed to Nguy\u1ec5n following her marriage to South Vietnam journalist Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng \u0110oan in 1975.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life===\nKh\u00e1nh Ly was born to a traditional family and grew up in [[Hanoi]]. As a child, she would fall asleep to her father's soothing voice. His serenades planted inside her a love for music, which grew stronger every day against her family's wishes. In 1954, at the age of 9, she entered a small contest in the city of Hanoi singing Th\u01a1 Ng\u00e2y; she did not win.\n\nBy 1956, she accompanied her mother to the southern regions of Vietnam. At the end of that very same year, she secretly entered a children's talent-search contest produced by Ph\u00e1p-\u00c1 production at Norodom Stage in Saigon. Mai traveled to the contest by sneaking into the back of transport trucks and hitching a ride from \u0110\u00e0 L\u1ea1t City to Saigon. She won second prize singing Pham Duy's famous song, Ng\u00e0y Tr\u1edf V\u1ec1. Mai lost to child-star Qu\u1ed1c Th\u1eafng who would also later become an iconic figure in the music world. She was only 11.\n\n===1962\u20131966: Debut===\nMai's musical career did not officially begin until she debuted at Club Anh V\u0169 on B\u00f9i Vi\u1ec7n Street in Saigon when she was only 17 (1962). At this point, she adopted the stage name Kh\u00e1nh Ly, a combination of Kh\u00e1nh K\u1ef5 and Y\u00eau Ly, both are characters from [[Chronicles of the Eastern Zhou Kingdoms]], her favorite novel. By the end of 1962, she relocated to \u0110\u00e0 L\u1ea1t and stayed there for four years performing at various clubs and resorts. Night after night, she serenaded lovers, tourists, and the youths of Vietnam.\nOn a rainy night in 1964, she met Tr\u1ecbnh C\u00f4ng S\u01a1n (TCS), at that time a young composer and a teacher at a school in B\u1ea3o L\u1ed9c. They became fast friends. Fascinated by her seductive voice, Trinh had asked her on several occasions to accompany him in his performances in Saigon. Still in love with the romantic hills of Da Lat, she declined.\n\n===1967\u20131975: Diva of Saigon===\nDuring a trip to [[Saigon]] in 1967, she ran into Tr\u1ecbnh on the busy streets of L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4n. After several serenades and coffee at a small shop called Qu\u00e1n V\u0103n, the legacy of Kh\u00e1nh Ly and Tr\u1ecbnh C\u00f4ng S\u01a1n had begun.\nWithin the next several decades, Kh\u00e1nh Ly and Tr\u1ecbnh C\u00f4ng S\u01a1n sang together at small coffee shops, clubs, and even on the steps of V\u0103n Khoa University in Saigon (a liberal arts school). During the escalation of an unwanted and bloody war, his anti-war lyrics in the Yellow-Skin Songs and her luring voice appealed to those who grew weary of the battles and bloodshed; their plea for peace propelled them to the top. From the educating fields of large universities to the unknown and endless farm lands, she was heard, known, and hailed as \"N\u1eef Ho\u00e0ng Ch\u00e2n \u0110\u1ea5t\" or \"N\u1eef Ho\u00e0ng S\u00e2n C\u1ecf.\" Together, Kh\u00e1nh Ly and Tr\u1ecbnh C\u00f4ng S\u01a1n took the Vietnamese music world by storm. Their phenomenal fame gave her the chance to be the first Vietnamese woman to headline her own show. During the late 1960s to early 1970s, she also collaborated with multiple production companies and played a large part on the recorded tracks from famous videos such as the Ph\u1ea1m M\u1ea1nh C\u01b0\u01a1ng Program, Tr\u01b0\u1eddng S\u01a1n Centre, S\u01a1n Ca Productions, Ho\u1ea1 Mi, Jo Marcel Productions, etc.\n\nUp until her emigration in 1975, Kh\u00e1nh Ly achieved unproportional fame around the world. She opened Club Kh\u00e1nh Ly on T\u1ef1 Do Street in Saigon along with a small shop named H\u1ed9i Qu\u00e1n C\u00e2y Tre, a gathering place for musicians and students alike. In addition, she was sponsored by the Vietnamese government to hold performances in Europe in order to promote the worldwide collaboration of the rising generation of Vietnamese students (\"N\u1ed1i V\u00f2ng Tay L\u1edbn\"). She also performed in the United States, Canada, and Japan at Osaka Fair in response to the invitation from Nippon Columbia Label (a large production company). Here, she recorded an album, featuring [[Tr\u1ecbnh C\u00f4ng S\u01a1n]]'s songs [[Di\u1ec5m X\u01b0a]] and [[Ca Dao M\u1eb9]] (sang in both languages), which went gold shortly after its debut. These songs became top hits in Japan and remained so for several decades. Kh\u00e1nh Ly was the first Vietnamese singer to achieve international fame.\n\n===1975\u2013present: Continue career after [[The Fall of Saigon]]===\nIn 1975, Kh\u00e1nh Ly, along with thousands of Vietnamese refugees, crossed the Pacific Ocean and settled in America. Like many, she struggled to find jobs on American soil to provide for her four children. Even though the first few years were difficult, Kh\u00e1nh Ly's renowned status did not fade from the music world. Within the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Khanh Ly was invited back to Japan on numerous occasions by [[Nippon Columbia Label]], [[Toci Film]], and Japanese largest television station to record and perform. Her second record with Nippon Columbia (1979) went gold short after its release; there were 2 million copies sold in Japan alone. Her third and final album with Nippon also featured classic hits such as Wandering Man. In addition, both Toci Film and Japanese largest television station featured her voice in the theme song to several movies and television series regarding Vietnam's culture as well as the \"Boat People\" phenomenon; her most notable recording was \"L\u1eddi Ru Cho \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng\" in 1987, music by Japanese artist Hako and words by former newspaper editor and Kh\u00e1nh Ly's husband, Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng Do\u00e3n. She was also featured in the Asian Music Festival held in Japan along with famous singers from Korea, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the South Pacific. Her fame in Japan continued to escalate when she was named one of the top 10 most famous people along the same line as Gandhi, Gucci, Martin Luther King Jr.s wife, among others. In 1996, Japan's television station NKH and famous producer Hideo Kado produced a short 50-minute documentary about the life of Kh\u00e1nh Ly which aired on 29 April 1997, 22 years from the day she left Saigon. In September of that year, [[NKH]] also published a 270-page biography about Kh\u00e1nh Ly.\n\nIn the later part of the 1980s and early 1990s, Kh\u00e1nh Ly traveled vigorously and performed in Russia, the Czech Republic, Poland, and in a concert in East Germany after the Berlin Wall was taken down in 1989. Being a devout Catholic, she also sang at many church-sponsored events in which her most memorable performance was at the Canonization of 117 Vietnamese Priests in Vatican City (1988) where she met Pope John Paul II. In 1992, during the World's Youth Festival in Denver Colorado, Kh\u00e1nh Ly had the honor of meeting the Pope for a second time. In 1996, she, several other renowned singers, and songwriter Tr\u1ea7m T\u1eef Thi\u00eang hosted a Charity Concert in order to raise money to build houses/shelters for 2000 Vietnamese refugees in the Philippines. They raised 2 million dollars, enough to establish a Vietnamese Village on a small island off of the coast of the Philippines.\n\nNow she is living comfortably with her husband, former newspaper editor/writer Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng Do\u00e3n in Cerritos, California, recording for Th\u00fay Nga-Paris by Night, Asia, May Productions, etc., touring the world, and co-owns her own production company, Kh\u00e1nh Ly Productions, which has produced more than 30 CDs, 4 videos, and several DVDs to date. Aside from her paid performances, she is also writing weekly columns for various Vietnamese newspaper and magazines throughout the world (H\u1ed3n Vi\u1ec7t, V\u0103n Ngh\u1ec7 T\u1ef1 Do, V\u0103n Ngh\u1ec7 Magazine, Th\u1eddi B\u00e1o, B\u00e1o Mai, etc.).

Even here, there is the distinction between old [[mosque]] buildings that have been in continuous use as mosques, and those that have been converted to other purposes; and between buildings that have been in continuous use as mosques and those that were shuttered for many decades. In terms of congregations, they are distinguished between early established congregations that have been in continuous existence, and early congregations that ceased to exist. Note that the major regions, such as Africa and Eurasia, are sorted alphabetically, whereas the minor regions, such as Northeast and Northwest Africa in Africa, and Arabia and South Asia in Eurasia, are sorted by the dates in which their first mosques were reportedly established, more or less, barring those that are mentioned by name in the [[Quran]].\n\nTo be listed here a site must:\n*be the oldest mosque in a country, large city (top 50), or oldest of its type (denomination, architectural, etc.);\n*be the oldest congregation of its type (denomination).\n\n== Mentioned in the Quran ==\nThe following are treated as the oldest mosques or [[Haram (site)|sanctuaries]]<ref name=\"Michigan C 1986\">{{cite book |author=Michigan Consortium for Medieval and Early Modern Studies |editor1=Goss, V.

Even here, there is the distinction between old [[mosque]] buildings that have been in continuous use as mosques, and those that have been converted to other purposes; and between buildings that have been in continuous use as mosques and those that were shuttered for many decades. In terms of congregations, they are distinguished between early established congregations that have been in continuous existence, and early congregations that ceased to exist. Note that the major regions, such as Africa and Eurasia, are sorted alphabetically, whereas the minor regions, such as Northeast and Northwest Africa in Africa, and Arabia and South Asia in Eurasia, are sorted by the dates in which their first mosques were reportedly established, more or less, barring those that are mentioned by name in the [[Quran]].\n\nTo be listed here a site must:\n*be the oldest mosque in a country, large city (top 50), or oldest of its type (denomination, architectural, etc.);\n*be the oldest congregation of its type (denomination).\n\n== Mentioned in the Quran ==\nThe following are treated as the oldest mosques or [[Haram (site)|sanctuaries]]<ref name=\"Michigan C 1986\">{{cite book |author=Michigan Consortium for Medieval and Early Modern Studies |editor1=Goss, V.

Despite Judy being the academy valedictorian, Chief Bogo doubts her potential and delegates her to parking duty. On her first day, she is hustled by a con artist fox duo, Nick Wilde and Finnick.\n\nJudy abandons parking duty to arrest Duke Weaselton, a weasel who stole a bag of [[crocus]] bulbs known as ''Midnicampum Holicithias''. As she is reprimanded by Bogo, an otter named Mrs. Otterton enters Bogo's office pleading for someone to find her husband Emmitt, one of fourteen predators who have gone missing. Bogo is forced to let a volunteering Judy take the case when Assistant Mayor Dawn Bellwether praises the assignment and informs Mayor Leodore Lionheart. He gives Judy 48 hours to find Emmitt on the condition that she must resign if she fails.\n\nDeducing that Nick was the last to see Emmitt, Judy blackmails him into assisting her by covertly recording his confession of [[tax evasion]]. They track Otterton to a limousine owned by crime boss Mr. Big, who reveals Otterton went \"savage\"\u2014reverted to a [[Feral animal|feral state]]\u2014and attacked his chauffeur Manchas. At his home, Manchas mentions Otterton yelled about \"Night Howlers\" before the attack. Manchas himself then turns savage and chases the pair. Judy saves Nick by trapping Manchas and calls the ZPD for help, but Manchas disappears before they arrive. Bogo demands Judy's resignation, but Nick defends Judy, reminding Bogo that she has 10 more hours to solve the case. After leaving on a [[gondola lift]], Nick tells his story about his childhood dream to join the junior ranger scouts, in which he has been tormented by them on his first day, due to being a fox.\n\nJudy and Nick then travel to the City Hall to access to the city's traffic cameras. They discover Manchas was captured by wolves, who Judy surmises are the \"Night Howlers\". They locate the missing predators\u2014who have all turned savage\u2014imprisoned at Cliffside Asylum, where Lionheart is secretly imprisoning them while attempting to determine the cause of their behavior. Judy records a video of Lionheart discussing the plot with her cell phone and reports him to the ZPD; Lionheart and the asylum staff are arrested for false imprisonment, and Bellwether becomes the new mayor.\n\nJudy, praised for solving the case, asks Nick to join the ZPD as her partner. At her following press conference, however, Judy suggests that the cause of the savage behavior is predator biology, as predators are the only ones going savage; in anger, Nick rejects Judy's offer and abandons her. Hateful speech and discrimination against predators runs rampant throughout Zootopia. Wracked with guilt for the consequences of her words, Judy resigns from the ZPD and returns to Bunnyburrow.\n\nBack home, Judy learns from her parents and Gideon Grey, a fox that bullied her as a child, but is now a pie salesman to her family's business, that the Night Howlers are actually the crocus bulbs Weaselton stole, and they contain a [[neurotoxin]] that has severe [[Psychoactive drug|psychotropic effects]] on mammals. After returning to Zootopia and tearfully reconciling with Nick, the pair confront Weaselton, who is pressured by Mr. Big and reveals that the bulbs he stole were meant for a [[Sheep|ram]] named Doug. They find Doug in a laboratory hidden in the city subway developing a drug made from Night Howlers, which he has been shooting at predators with a [[Tranquillizer gun|dart gun]].\n\nJudy and Nick obtain the serum as evidence, but before they can reach the ZPD, Bellwether confronts them in the Natural History Museum, revealing herself as the mastermind behind a prey-[[Supremacism|supremacist]] conspiracy to frame predators as dangerous and savage. Bellwether retrieves the evidence after Nick refuses to abandon an injured Judy. She shoots Nick with a serum pellet to make him attack Judy and fakes a call to the ZPD, but the pellets she is using are revealed to have been replaced with blueberries by Nick. Judy then baits Bellwether into openly declaring her role in the attacks and records the confession just as Bogo and his deputies arrive at the scene.\n\nBellwether is arrested for her treachery, while Lionheart publicly denies knowledge of her plot and defends his imprisonment of the savage predators as a necessary precaution to maintain public safety, quoting that he did 'the wrong thing for the right reason'. The savage animals are cured and Judy rejoins the ZPD. Nick graduates from the Zootopia Police Academy as the city's first fox police officer and becomes Judy's partner.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=}}\n*[[Ginnifer Goodwin]] as Judy Hopps, an optimistic rabbit from Bunnyburrow who is a newly appointed member of the Zootopia Police Department assigned to the 1st Precinct.<ref name=THRGoodwinJoins>{{cite news|last1=Kit |first1=Borys |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ginnifer-goodwin-joins-jason-bateman-793927 |title=Ginnifer Goodwin Joins Jason Bateman in Disney Animation's 'Zootopia' (Exclusive) |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=May 6, 2015 |accessdate=May 6, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002407/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ginnifer-goodwin-joins-jason-bateman-793927 |archivedate=May 9, 2015 }}</ref>\n**Della Saba voices a younger Judy Hopps.\n*[[Jason Bateman]] as Nick Wilde, a sly [[red fox]] who is a small-time con artist.<ref name=THRGoodwinJoins /><ref name=THRBateman />\n**[[Kath Soucie]] voices a younger Nick Wilde.\n*[[Idris Elba]] as Chief Bogo, an [[African buffalo]] who is the [[Chief of police|police chief]] of the Zootopia Police Department's 1st Precinct.<ref name=DeadlineCast>{{cite web|last1=Pedersen |first1=Erik |title=Disney's 'Zootopia' Cages Idris Elba, J.K.

Therefore, the studio's IT engineers developed the fur-controlling software \"iGroom\", which gave character designers precise control over the brushing, shaping and shading of fur and made it possible to create a variety of eccentric character styles for each animal. The software was also able to control an unseen \"imaginary\" under-layer that gave fur a degree of plushness not seen before. This feature was used to create characters like Officer Clawhauser, who has a big head that is entirely made of spotted fur. Characters with noteworthy numbers of strands of hair or fur included both of the two lead characters, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, who each had around 2.5 million hairs; a giraffe with nine million strands of fur; a gerbil with 480,000 strands; and a rodent with more strands of hair than the 400,000 that were on [[Elsa (Disney)|Elsa]]'s head in ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.<ref name=\"Engadget\"/>\n\n''Zootopia'' was the second time Disney used the Hyperion renderer, which they had first used on ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]''. A new fur paradigm was added to the renderer to facilitate the creation of realistic images of the animals' dense fur. Nitro, a real-time display application developed since the making of ''Wreck-It Ralph'', was used to make the fur more consistent, intact and subtle much more quickly, as opposed to the previous practice of having to predict how the fur would work while making and looking at silhouettes or poses for the character. The tree-and-plant generator Bonsai, first used in ''Frozen'', was used to make numerous variations of trees with very detailed foliage.<ref name = \"Engadget\"/>\n\n''Zootopia'' was produced in makeshift quarters in a giant warehouse in [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles|North Hollywood]] (together with ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'') while Disney Animation's headquarters in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] was being renovated.<ref name=\"Snetiker\">{{cite news|last1=Snetiker |first1=Marc |title=Moana directors Ron Clements, John Musker talk four decades Disney movies |url=http://ew.com/article/2016/11/24/moana-disney-ron-clements-john-musker/ |accessdate=January 13, 2017 |work=Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Time Inc. |date=November 24, 2016 |location=New York |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118114500/http://ew.com/article/2016/11/24/moana-disney-ron-clements-john-musker/ |archivedate=January 18, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nOn May 6, 2015, Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin were announced as having been cast, respectively in the roles of Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps.<ref name=THRGoodwinJoins/> The filmmakers chose Bateman because they wanted an actor who could bring \"a funny yet heartfelt side\" with \"a wily, dry-witted sort of voice\". Bateman described his character as \"a crafty, sarcastic schemer\", remarking on the role's similarity to many other roles he had done since he was 12.

The lawsuit claims that Goldman (in 2000 and 2009) pitched a concept to Disney for a live-action film titled ''Looney'', which was about a socially awkward animator who creates a self-inspired TV cartoon called ''Zootopia''. Disney twice rejected the pitch, but Goldman accused the company of copying the name, themes, settings, and character tropes. Filed with the lawsuit was a graphic of early concept artwork of characters that are claimed to appear similar to major characters from the film, including Nick Wilde, Judy Hopps, Flash, and Chief Bogo.

Despite Judy being the academy valedictorian, Chief Bogo doubts her potential and delegates her to parking duty. On her first day, she is hustled by a con artist fox duo, Nick Wilde and Finnick.\n\nJudy abandons parking duty to arrest Duke Weaselton, a weasel who stole a bag of [[crocus]] bulbs known as ''Midnicampum Holicithias''. As she is reprimanded by Bogo, an otter named Mrs. Otterton enters Bogo's office pleading for someone to find her husband Emmitt, one of fourteen predators who have gone missing. Bogo is forced to let a volunteering Judy take the case when Assistant Mayor Dawn Bellwether praises the assignment and informs Mayor Leodore Lionheart. He gives Judy 48 hours to find Emmitt on the condition that she must resign if she fails.\n\nDeducing that Nick was the last to see Emmitt, Judy blackmails him into assisting her by covertly recording his confession of [[tax evasion]]. They track Otterton to a limousine owned by crime boss Mr. Big, who reveals Otterton went \"savage\"\u2014reverted to a [[Feral animal|feral state]]\u2014and attacked his chauffeur Manchas. At his home, Manchas mentions Otterton yelled about \"Night Howlers\" before the attack. Manchas himself then turns savage and chases the pair. Judy saves Nick by trapping Manchas and calls the ZPD for help, but Manchas disappears before they arrive. Bogo demands Judy's resignation, but Nick defends Judy, reminding Bogo that she has 10 more hours to solve the case. After leaving on a [[gondola lift]], Nick tells his story about his childhood dream to join the junior ranger scouts, in which he has been tormented by them on his first day, due to being a fox.\n\nJudy and Nick then travel to the City Hall to access to the city's traffic cameras. They discover Manchas was captured by wolves, who Judy surmises are the \"Night Howlers\". They locate the missing predators\u2014who have all turned savage\u2014imprisoned at Cliffside Asylum, where Lionheart is secretly imprisoning them while attempting to determine the cause of their behavior. Judy records a video of Lionheart discussing the plot with her cell phone and reports him to the ZPD; Lionheart and the asylum staff are arrested for false imprisonment, and Bellwether becomes the new mayor.\n\nJudy, praised for solving the case, asks Nick to join the ZPD as her partner. At her following press conference, however, Judy suggests that the cause of the savage behavior is predator biology, as predators are the only ones going savage; in anger, Nick rejects Judy's offer and abandons her. Hateful speech and discrimination against predators runs rampant throughout Zootopia. Wracked with guilt for the consequences of her words, Judy resigns from the ZPD and returns to Bunnyburrow.\n\nBack home, Judy learns from her parents and Gideon Grey, a fox that bullied her as a child, but is now a pie salesman to her family's business, that the Night Howlers are actually the crocus bulbs Weaselton stole, and they contain a [[neurotoxin]] that has severe [[Psychoactive drug|psychotropic effects]] on mammals. After returning to Zootopia and tearfully reconciling with Nick, the pair confront Weaselton, who is pressured by Mr. Big and reveals that the bulbs he stole were meant for a [[Sheep|ram]] named Doug. They find Doug in a laboratory hidden in the city subway developing a drug made from Night Howlers, which he has been shooting at predators with a [[Tranquillizer gun|dart gun]].\n\nJudy and Nick obtain the serum as evidence, but before they can reach the ZPD, Bellwether confronts them in the Natural History Museum, revealing herself as the mastermind behind a prey-[[Supremacism|supremacist]] conspiracy to frame predators as dangerous and savage. Bellwether retrieves the evidence after Nick refuses to abandon an injured Judy. She shoots Nick with a serum pellet to make him attack Judy and fakes a call to the ZPD, but the pellets she is using are revealed to have been replaced with blueberries by Nick. Judy then baits Bellwether into openly declaring her role in the attacks and records the confession just as Bogo and his deputies arrive at the scene.\n\nBellwether is arrested for her treachery, while Lionheart publicly denies knowledge of her plot and defends his imprisonment of the savage predators as a necessary precaution to maintain public safety, quoting that he did 'the wrong thing for the right reason'. The savage animals are cured and Judy rejoins the ZPD. Nick graduates from the Zootopia Police Academy as the city's first fox police officer and becomes Judy's partner.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=}}\n*[[Ginnifer Goodwin]] as Judy Hopps, an optimistic rabbit from Bunnyburrow who is a newly appointed member of the Zootopia Police Department assigned to the 1st Precinct.<ref name=THRGoodwinJoins>{{cite news|last1=Kit |first1=Borys |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ginnifer-goodwin-joins-jason-bateman-793927 |title=Ginnifer Goodwin Joins Jason Bateman in Disney Animation's 'Zootopia' (Exclusive) |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=May 6, 2015 |accessdate=May 6, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002407/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ginnifer-goodwin-joins-jason-bateman-793927 |archivedate=May 9, 2015 }}</ref>\n**Della Saba voices a younger Judy Hopps.\n*[[Jason Bateman]] as Nick Wilde, a sly [[red fox]] who is a small-time con artist.<ref name=THRGoodwinJoins /><ref name=THRBateman />\n**[[Kath Soucie]] voices a younger Nick Wilde.\n*[[Idris Elba]] as Chief Bogo, an [[African buffalo]] who is the [[Chief of police|police chief]] of the Zootopia Police Department's 1st Precinct.<ref name=DeadlineCast>{{cite web|last1=Pedersen |first1=Erik |title=Disney's 'Zootopia' Cages Idris Elba, J.K.

Therefore, the studio's IT engineers developed the fur-controlling software \"iGroom\", which gave character designers precise control over the brushing, shaping and shading of fur and made it possible to create a variety of eccentric character styles for each animal. The software was also able to control an unseen \"imaginary\" under-layer that gave fur a degree of plushness not seen before. This feature was used to create characters like Officer Clawhauser, who has a big head that is entirely made of spotted fur. Characters with noteworthy numbers of strands of hair or fur included both of the two lead characters, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, who each had around 2.5 million hairs; a giraffe with nine million strands of fur; a gerbil with 480,000 strands; and a rodent with more strands of hair than the 400,000 that were on [[Elsa (Disney)|Elsa]]'s head in ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.<ref name=\"Engadget\"/>\n\n''Zootopia'' was the second time Disney used the Hyperion renderer, which they had first used on ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]''. A new fur paradigm was added to the renderer to facilitate the creation of realistic images of the animals' dense fur. Nitro, a real-time display application developed since the making of ''Wreck-It Ralph'', was used to make the fur more consistent, intact and subtle much more quickly, as opposed to the previous practice of having to predict how the fur would work while making and looking at silhouettes or poses for the character. The tree-and-plant generator Bonsai, first used in ''Frozen'', was used to make numerous variations of trees with very detailed foliage.<ref name = \"Engadget\"/>\n\n''Zootopia'' was produced in makeshift quarters in a giant warehouse in [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles|North Hollywood]] (together with ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'') while Disney Animation's headquarters in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] was being renovated.<ref name=\"Snetiker\">{{cite news|last1=Snetiker |first1=Marc |title=Moana directors Ron Clements, John Musker talk four decades Disney movies |url=http://ew.com/article/2016/11/24/moana-disney-ron-clements-john-musker/ |accessdate=January 13, 2017 |work=Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Time Inc. |date=November 24, 2016 |location=New York |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118114500/http://ew.com/article/2016/11/24/moana-disney-ron-clements-john-musker/ |archivedate=January 18, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nOn May 6, 2015, Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin were announced as having been cast, respectively in the roles of Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps.<ref name=THRGoodwinJoins/> The filmmakers chose Bateman because they wanted an actor who could bring \"a funny yet heartfelt side\" with \"a wily, dry-witted sort of voice\".

The lawsuit claims that Goldman (in 2000 and 2009) pitched a concept to Disney for a live-action film titled ''Looney'', which was about a socially awkward animator who creates a self-inspired TV cartoon called ''Zootopia''. Disney twice rejected the pitch, but Goldman accused the company of copying the name, themes, settings, and character tropes. Filed with the lawsuit was a graphic of early concept artwork of characters that are claimed to appear similar to major characters from the film, including Nick Wilde, Judy Hopps, Flash, and Chief Bogo.

They are supplemented on the field with an advanced [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] system called ISAC.\n\nBy the beginning of ''The Division 2'', most government and military personnel have evacuated Washington D.C., which has descended into lawlessness. The [[White House]] is controlled by local Division agents and a coalition of first responders called the Joint Task Force (JTF), working to protect civilians and reestablish order. However, most of Washington D.C. has been carved into territories controlled by three competing militias: the Hyenas, a loose coalition of gangs, criminals, and anarchists taking advantage of the chaos for amusement and profit; the Outcasts, fanatical survivors of severe quarantines during the onset of the pandemic, seeking revenge on those they believe responsible for their imprisonment and eventual infection; and the True Sons, a highly organized and ruthless group of disgruntled JTF, [[US Armed Forces]], and paramilitary [[Mutiny|mutineers]] led by Colonel Antwon Ridgeway, who believes that security can only be restored through brutal [[authoritarianism]].\n\nAdditionally, the Acting [[President of the United States]], Andrew Ellis, is considered missing or [[killed in action]] since [[Air Force One]] crash landed near [[Capitol Hill]].\n\n=== Plot ===\nSeven months after the Green Poison outbreak, several Division agents are defending a civilian settlement from a bandit attack when the SHD Network, the system controlling their advanced technology and nationwide communications, suddenly shuts down. The Player's Agent receives a Division distress call from Washington D.C. as a new and larger force begins to attack the settlement. At a fellow agent's urging, they abandon the battle to respond to the call. The Agent arrives in Washington D.C. to find the Division and JTF's local base of operations, the White House, under attack by the Hyenas. After repelling the attack, the Agent is briefed by Manny Ortega, the city's Division controller. The Agent learns that most of the country\u2019s leadership is either dead or missing and the city is mostly controlled by three hostile factions: the Hyenas, the Outcasts, and the True Sons. Ortega instructs the Agent to work with fellow agent Alani Kelso to assist civilian settlements, liberate the city, and restore the SHD network.\n\nOrtega and Kelso uncover information that a cure to Green Poison might be located somewhere in the city, and that President Ellis may have survived the crash of [[Air Force One]] but is being held prisoner. Kelso is reluctant to waste time and resources to find Ellis, but Ortega points out that his security clearance may be needed to access the cure. The Agent eventually discovers Ellis and rescues him from Hyena custody. Ellis confirms that [[Antivirals|broad spectrum antivirals]] to cure not just Green Poison, but all viral infections, exist. However he can only access them with a special briefcase currently held in the True Sons' heavily fortified base at the [[United States Capitol]]. After the Agent repairs the SHD Network, reconnecting Division agents across the country, Ellis vows to restore the United States, no matter the cost. With the tide turning against them, the Hyenas, True Sons, and Outcasts retreat to their final strongholds. With the help of civilian militias and the JTF, the Agent assaults the strongholds and eliminates the leadership of most of the factions, with the Outcasts\u2019 leader Emelline Shaw disappearing during the assault on her stronghold on Roosevelt Island, while recovering Ellis' briefcase from the Capital.\n\nAs the Agent and the Division celebrate their victory, a new faction, the technologically advanced [[private military company]] Black Tusk, invades the city. Many of D.C.'s landmarks are quickly seized and Ellis suddenly goes missing with his briefcase, forcing the Agent to head out to find Ellis and repel the Black Tusk. The Agent eventually learns that Black Tusk supplied weapons to the gangs of D.C. and were responsible for sabotaging the SHD network, Ellis has been working with the Black Tusks all along, and that Ellis's predecessor, President Mendez, did not commit suicide as previously believed, but was assassinated by his own Secret Service detail on Black Tusk's orders. Thanks to Ellis, Black Tusk gains possession of the broad spectrum antivirals, planning to transport them out of the city. The Agent successfully raids Black Tusk's stronghold at [[Tidal Basin]], retrieving the antivirals and preventing a missile strike on the White House, although Ellis\u2019 location remains unknown.\n\n===Downloadable content===\n\n=====Episode 1 \u2013 D.C. Outskirts: Expedition=====\nFurther investigation reveals that Outcast leader, Emelline Shaw, survived the Division's assault at the aforementioned stronghold, and that she is currently at her new hideout at the Manning National Zoo. After fighting their way through the Zoo, the Agent manages to destroy Shaw\u2019s heavily armed monorail car and kill her.\n\nThe Agent then joins a large JTF task force in an attack on Camp White Oaks, a heavily wooded former presidential retreat north of DC, which has since been taken over by Black Tusk, with the objective of locating and capturing President Ellis. The main assault force is annihilated when the bridge they are crossing is destroyed by Black Tusk and the remaining team is eventually overrun while trying to secure the main helipad to prevent Ellis\u2019 escape, leaving the Agent to continue the mission alone. The Agent manages to reach the helipad too late as Ellis is evacuated by Black Tusk helicopter, disappearing for the second time.\n\nMeanwhile, the Agent is then sent on an expedition to Kenly College to investigate the recent disappearance of a JTF Squad, where the Outcasts have taken over the campus and severed communications.  There, the Agent removes the Outcasts securing stolen supplies at the College Library, infiltrates the Metro Station and water treatment facility underneath, and destroys the outcast base in the Student Union building.\n\n====Episode 2 \u2013 Pentagon: The Last Castle====\nThe Agent is sent to investigate [[the Pentagon]] after the Division detects heavy Black Tusk activity at the facility. Upon reaching the site, the Agent discovers that Black Tusk is setting up a massive drilling operation in order to access the DARPA laboratories underneath the Pentagon, which hold numerous experimental technologies. The Agent sabotages the drilling operation to delay Black Tusk before stealing data from their servers to figure out what they are after. It is revealed that Black Tusk are after a [[perfusion]] [[bioreactor]], capable of mass producing the antivirals the Division possesses.\n\nThe Agent proceeds into the DARPA lab to find Black Tusk attempting to smuggle the bioreactor out through the tunnel network beneath the Pentagon. The Agent is able to seize the bioreactor and transport it to a nearby helipad, eliminating Black Tusk forces so that the bioreactor can be extracted. Kelso congratulates the Agent, stating that even though they don't have staff qualified to operate the bioreactor yet, they are one step closer to ending the threat of Green Poison.\n\n==== Episode 3 \u2013 Coney Island: The Hunt ====\nThe Agent is sent to the ruins of [[Coney Island]] to rescue Vitaly Tchernenko, a virologist kidnapped by rogue Division agent Aaron Keener during the events of the previous game. Keener intends to hand Tchernenko over to Black Tusk at Coney Island in exchange for assistance with an unknown project. The Agent is tasked with rescuing Tchernenko to ensure his knowledge doesn't fall into Black Tusk's hands, and enlist his help in creating a vaccine. The Agent successfully infiltrates Black Tusk's defenses and has Tchernenko evacuated to Washington D.C.\n\nIt becomes apparent that Keener never intended to allow Black Tusk to leave with Tchernenko, as the island comes under attack by The Cleaners, a gang of deranged former [[DSNY]] workers that aims to violently purge any potential sources and carriers of the virus. Keener informed The Cleaners of Tchernenko's whereabouts, inciting them to attack Black Tusk so they can kill him. The Agent is forced to fight their way through the Cleaners and Black Tusk while hunting for Keener. After the Agent kills the Black Tusk's commander, Keener hijacks the video feed from a Division drone to gloat at the Agent about his successful [[Betrayal#Double cross|double cross]], escape, and ominous project.\n\n=== Expansion ===\n\n==== Warlords of New York ====\nThe Agent and Alani Kelso helicopter into New York City, answering a distress call from Faye Lau, leader of local Division operations. They find the JTF and Division's base in [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] devastated by a biological weapon deployed by Keener and his allies. The weapon is a newly engineered, instantaneously lethal, derivative of Green Poison called Eclipse. The Agent, Kelso, Lau, and JTF leader Roy Benitez regroup at Haven, a civilian settlement run by Paul Rhodes. \n\nAs Keener's whereabouts are unknown, the group decides to go after his [[Lieutenant|lieutenants]], who act as [[Warlord|warlords]] in four [[Lower Manhattan]] neighborhoods. Keener's warlords are fellow rogue agents convinced or coerced to work for him alongside local gangs: Theo Parnell, an engineering and computer systems expert stationed inside [[The Tombs]] of [[Civic Center, Manhattan|Civic Center]]; Vivian Conley, a chemical engineering expert who commands the Cleaners gang from a wrecked oil tanker in [[Two Bridges, Manhattan|Two Bridges]]; Javier Kajika, a covert and guerilla warfare expert based underneath [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]]; and James Dragov, a heavy weapons expert who commands the Rikers gang from the [[New York Stock Exchange|Stock Exchange]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].\n\nThe Agent eliminates the four warlords and recovers intelligence placing Keener on [[Liberty Island]]. The Agent and Kelso commandeer a ferry to Liberty Island, but are attacked by Black Tusk who have suddenly arrived in Manhattan to attack Keener as well. The Agent single-handily fights off Black Tusk to reach Keener's base inside the [[Statue of Liberty Museum]], discovering a [[Surface-to-surface missile|surface to surface missile]] system capable of delivering Eclipse payloads. Keener plans to launch a missile at Manhattan, killing everyone to enable the rise of a new society. The agent successfully destroys the system and defeats Keener in battle. A mortally wounded Keener activates a signal on his modified Division wristwatch before dying.\n\nKeener's signal activates ANNA, an AI analogue to ISAC developed by Parnell to network and coordinate rogue Division agents across the country. It's also revealed that Lau betrayed the Division to ally with Black Tusk at some point, and was their reason for arriving in Manhattan after Keener's location was known. Lau tells Bardon Schaeffer, Black Tusk's leader in Washington D.C., that Keener's rogue agent network will help them end the Division. Back in Haven, Rhodes and Benitez thank and congratulate the Agent, but lament Lau's betrayal. Kelso informs the Agent of a rogue agent cell activated in Washington D.C..\n\n== Development ==\nThe game was developed by [[Massive Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2018/03/08/division-2-currently-works-massive-entertainment/|title=The Division 2 is currently in the works at Massive Entertainment, more to come at E3 2018|first=Stephany |last=Nunneley|work=[[VG 247]]|date=March 8, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> Evaluating the feedback from players regarding the [[Tom Clancy's The Division|first game]], Massive Entertainment planned to include more game content at launch and improve the endgame.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-on-how-the-division-2-will-be-better-than-/1100-6459041/|title=Ubisoft On How The Division 2 Will Be Better Than The Division 1|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=May 18, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> The game's endgame development was prioritized by Massive Entertainment after hearing players' complaints from the first game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/11/e3-2018-the-division-2s-developer-says-first-games-post-launch-response-was-a-nightmare|title=E3 2018: The Division 2's Developer Says First Game's Post-launch Response Was A Nightmare|first=Terri|last=Schwartz|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 11, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> The developers have said that the game's main campaign will take around 40 hours to beat, making it twice as long as the original game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameskinny.com/wk543/the-division-2-how-long-is-the-campaign|title=The Division 2: How Long is the Campaign?|first=William|last=Parks|work=[[GameSkinny]]|date=January 20, 2019|accessdate=March 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe game was announced on March 9, 2018, by Ubisoft, with the first gameplay footage being premiered at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018]] in June 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-division-2-will-release-within-a-year-ubisoft-confirms/|title=The Division 2 will release within the next 12 months, Ubisoft confirms|first=Samuel|last=Horti|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=May 12, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> At the Expo, Ubisoft confirmed that the game will be released on March 15, 2019 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2018/03/08/division-2-currently-works-massive-entertainment/ | title = The Division 2 is currently in the works at Massive Entertainment, more to come at E3 2018 | first=  Stephany | last = Nunnelly | date = March 8, 2018 | accessdate = March 8, 2018 | work = [[VG247]] }}</ref> A [[Software release life cycle#Beta|private beta]] was launched prior to the game's release.

Green Poison became a pandemic, resulting in casualties and chaos on a global scale. Facing imminent social collapse, the United States government activated a contingent of domestic [[sleeper agents]] called the Strategic Homeland Division (SHD), or simply \"The Division\", to preserve order and continuity of government. Division agents leverage advanced technology and wide autonomy to deal with threats as they see fit. They are supplemented on the field with an advanced [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] system called ISAC.\n\nBy the beginning of ''The Division 2'', most government and military personnel have evacuated Washington D.C., which has descended into lawlessness. The [[White House]] is controlled by local Division agents and a coalition of first responders called the Joint Task Force (JTF), working to protect civilians and reestablish order. However, most of Washington D.C. has been carved into territories controlled by three competing militias: the Hyenas, a loose coalition of gangs, criminals, and anarchists taking advantage of the chaos for amusement and profit; the Outcasts, fanatical survivors of severe quarantines during the onset of the pandemic, seeking revenge on those they believe responsible for their imprisonment and eventual infection; and the True Sons, a highly organized and ruthless group of disgruntled JTF, [[US Armed Forces]], and paramilitary [[Mutiny|mutineers]] led by Colonel Antwon Ridgeway, who believes that security can only be restored through brutal [[authoritarianism]].\n\nAdditionally, the Acting [[President of the United States]], Andrew Ellis, is considered missing or [[killed in action]] since [[Air Force One]] crash landed near [[Capitol Hill]].\n\n=== Plot ===\nSeven months after the Green Poison outbreak, several Division agents are defending a civilian settlement from a bandit attack when the SHD Network, the system controlling their advanced technology and nationwide communications, suddenly shuts down. The Player's Agent receives a Division distress call from Washington D.C. as a new and larger force begins to attack the settlement. At a fellow agent's urging, they abandon the battle to respond to the call. The Agent arrives in Washington D.C. to find the Division and JTF's local base of operations, the White House, under attack by the Hyenas. After repelling the attack, the Agent is briefed by Manny Ortega, the city's Division controller. The Agent learns that most of the country\u2019s leadership is either dead or missing and the city is mostly controlled by three hostile factions: the Hyenas, the Outcasts, and the True Sons. Ortega instructs the Agent to work with fellow agent Alani Kelso to assist civilian settlements, liberate the city, and restore the SHD network.\n\nOrtega and Kelso uncover information that a cure to Green Poison might be located somewhere in the city, and that President Ellis may have survived the crash of [[Air Force One]] but is being held prisoner. Kelso is reluctant to waste time and resources to find Ellis, but Ortega points out that his security clearance may be needed to access the cure. The Agent eventually discovers Ellis and rescues him from Hyena custody. Ellis confirms that [[Antivirals|broad spectrum antivirals]] to cure not just Green Poison, but all viral infections, exist. However he can only access them with a special briefcase currently held in the True Sons' heavily fortified base at the [[United States Capitol]]. After the Agent repairs the SHD Network, reconnecting Division agents across the country, Ellis vows to restore the United States, no matter the cost. With the tide turning against them, the Hyenas, True Sons, and Outcasts retreat to their final strongholds. With the help of civilian militias and the JTF, the Agent assaults the strongholds and eliminates the leadership of most of the factions, with the Outcasts\u2019 leader Emelline Shaw disappearing during the assault on her stronghold on Roosevelt Island, while recovering Ellis' briefcase from the Capital.\n\nAs the Agent and the Division celebrate their victory, a new faction, the technologically advanced [[private military company]] Black Tusk, invades the city. Many of D.C.'s landmarks are quickly seized and Ellis suddenly goes missing with his briefcase, forcing the Agent to head out to find Ellis and repel the Black Tusk. The Agent eventually learns that Black Tusk supplied weapons to the gangs of D.C. and were responsible for sabotaging the SHD network, Ellis has been working with the Black Tusks all along, and that Ellis's predecessor, President Mendez, did not commit suicide as previously believed, but was assassinated by his own Secret Service detail on Black Tusk's orders. Thanks to Ellis, Black Tusk gains possession of the broad spectrum antivirals, planning to transport them out of the city. The Agent successfully raids Black Tusk's stronghold at [[Tidal Basin]], retrieving the antivirals and preventing a missile strike on the White House, although Ellis\u2019 location remains unknown.\n\n===Downloadable content===\n\n=====Episode 1 \u2013 D.C. Outskirts: Expedition=====\nFurther investigation reveals that Outcast leader, Emelline Shaw, survived the Division's assault at the aforementioned stronghold, and that she is currently at her new hideout at the Manning National Zoo. After fighting their way through the Zoo, the Agent manages to destroy Shaw\u2019s heavily armed monorail car and kill her.\n\nThe Agent then joins a large JTF task force in an attack on Camp White Oaks, a heavily wooded former presidential retreat north of DC, which has since been taken over by Black Tusk, with the objective of locating and capturing President Ellis. The main assault force is annihilated when the bridge they are crossing is destroyed by Black Tusk and the remaining team is eventually overrun while trying to secure the main helipad to prevent Ellis\u2019 escape, leaving the Agent to continue the mission alone. The Agent manages to reach the helipad too late as Ellis is evacuated by Black Tusk helicopter, disappearing for the second time.\n\nMeanwhile, the Agent is then sent on an expedition to Kenly College to investigate the recent disappearance of a JTF Squad, where the Outcasts have taken over the campus and severed communications.  There, the Agent removes the Outcasts securing stolen supplies at the College Library, infiltrates the Metro Station and water treatment facility underneath, and destroys the outcast base in the Student Union building.\n\n====Episode 2 \u2013 Pentagon: The Last Castle====\nThe Agent is sent to investigate [[the Pentagon]] after the Division detects heavy Black Tusk activity at the facility. Upon reaching the site, the Agent discovers that Black Tusk is setting up a massive drilling operation in order to access the DARPA laboratories underneath the Pentagon, which hold numerous experimental technologies. The Agent sabotages the drilling operation to delay Black Tusk before stealing data from their servers to figure out what they are after. It is revealed that Black Tusk are after a [[perfusion]] [[bioreactor]], capable of mass producing the antivirals the Division possesses.\n\nThe Agent proceeds into the DARPA lab to find Black Tusk attempting to smuggle the bioreactor out through the tunnel network beneath the Pentagon. The Agent is able to seize the bioreactor and transport it to a nearby helipad, eliminating Black Tusk forces so that the bioreactor can be extracted. Kelso congratulates the Agent, stating that even though they don't have staff qualified to operate the bioreactor yet, they are one step closer to ending the threat of Green Poison.\n\n==== Episode 3 \u2013 Coney Island: The Hunt ====\nThe Agent is sent to the ruins of [[Coney Island]] to rescue Vitaly Tchernenko, a virologist kidnapped by rogue Division agent Aaron Keener during the events of the previous game. Keener intends to hand Tchernenko over to Black Tusk at Coney Island in exchange for assistance with an unknown project. The Agent is tasked with rescuing Tchernenko to ensure his knowledge doesn't fall into Black Tusk's hands, and enlist his help in creating a vaccine. The Agent successfully infiltrates Black Tusk's defenses and has Tchernenko evacuated to Washington D.C.\n\nIt becomes apparent that Keener never intended to allow Black Tusk to leave with Tchernenko, as the island comes under attack by The Cleaners, a gang of deranged former [[DSNY]] workers that aims to violently purge any potential sources and carriers of the virus. Keener informed The Cleaners of Tchernenko's whereabouts, inciting them to attack Black Tusk so they can kill him. The Agent is forced to fight their way through the Cleaners and Black Tusk while hunting for Keener. After the Agent kills the Black Tusk's commander, Keener hijacks the video feed from a Division drone to gloat at the Agent about his successful [[Betrayal#Double cross|double cross]], escape, and ominous project.\n\n=== Expansion ===\n\n==== Warlords of New York ====\nThe Agent and Alani Kelso helicopter into New York City, answering a distress call from Faye Lau, leader of local Division operations. They find the JTF and Division's base in [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] devastated by a biological weapon deployed by Keener and his allies. The weapon is a newly engineered, instantaneously lethal, derivative of Green Poison called Eclipse. The Agent, Kelso, Lau, and JTF leader Roy Benitez regroup at Haven, a civilian settlement run by Paul Rhodes. \n\nAs Keener's whereabouts are unknown, the group decides to go after his [[Lieutenant|lieutenants]], who act as [[Warlord|warlords]] in four [[Lower Manhattan]] neighborhoods. Keener's warlords are fellow rogue agents convinced or coerced to work for him alongside local gangs: Theo Parnell, an engineering and computer systems expert stationed inside [[The Tombs]] of [[Civic Center, Manhattan|Civic Center]]; Vivian Conley, a chemical engineering expert who commands the Cleaners gang from a wrecked oil tanker in [[Two Bridges, Manhattan|Two Bridges]]; Javier Kajika, a covert and guerilla warfare expert based underneath [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]]; and James Dragov, a heavy weapons expert who commands the Rikers gang from the [[New York Stock Exchange|Stock Exchange]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].\n\nThe Agent eliminates the four warlords and recovers intelligence placing Keener on [[Liberty Island]]. The Agent and Kelso commandeer a ferry to Liberty Island, but are attacked by Black Tusk who have suddenly arrived in Manhattan to attack Keener as well. The Agent single-handily fights off Black Tusk to reach Keener's base inside the [[Statue of Liberty Museum]], discovering a [[Surface-to-surface missile|surface to surface missile]] system capable of delivering Eclipse payloads. Keener plans to launch a missile at Manhattan, killing everyone to enable the rise of a new society. The agent successfully destroys the system and defeats Keener in battle. A mortally wounded Keener activates a signal on his modified Division wristwatch before dying.\n\nKeener's signal activates ANNA, an AI analogue to ISAC developed by Parnell to network and coordinate rogue Division agents across the country. It's also revealed that Lau betrayed the Division to ally with Black Tusk at some point, and was their reason for arriving in Manhattan after Keener's location was known.
