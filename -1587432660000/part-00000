It was the only physical single from ''I'm Not Dead'' to miss the top five on the [[ARIA Singles Chart]], on which it reached its peak in late January 2007, but it was very popular on radio. Two weeks before this, \"[[Who Knew]]\" (the second ''I'm Not Dead'' single) had re-entered the chart and \"[[U + Ur Hand]]\" was still on the chart, which meant that three singles by Pink were in the top fifty (as of January 21, 2007).  On the [[UK Singles Chart]] it was Pink's lowest peaking single at the time, and the first ''I'm Not Dead'' single to miss the top ten.\n\n\"Nobody Knows\" reached number 17 in [[Germany]] and number 74 on the [[Eurochart Hot 100 Singles]] chart. Although it reached the top 40 on the majority of charts on which it appeared, it was not as successful as the album's preceding singles. In [[Canada]] the song was released to radio in mid-January shortly after the success of \"U + Ur Hand\"; in [[Belgium]] \"[[Dear Mr. President (Pink song)|Dear Mr. President]]\" was the fourth single from the album.\n\n==Use in singing competitions==\n\nThe song enjoys great popularity within contestants of TV singing competitions.\n\nThe song was used in 2007 by [[Natalie Gauci]] as her Top 3 performance during [[Australian Idol (season 5)|Australian Idol's Season 5]].\n\nThe song was sung in 2009 by [[Rachel Adedeji]] [[The_X_Factor_(UK_series_6)|sixth series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]''\n\nIt was covered in [[The_X_Factor_(UK_series_7)#Week_3_.2823.2F24_October.29|week 3]] of the [[The_X_Factor_(UK_series_7)|seventh series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' by the boyband [[One Direction]] in 2010. \n\nIn 2011, [[LeRoy Bell]] of ''[[The X Factor USA]]'''s first season covered the song during [[The X Factor (US season 1)|Top 17 Performance]]. It was also covered by [[Jade Richards]] as well as [[Amelia Lily Oliver]] for Bootcamp Stage 2 during [[The_X_Factor_(UK_series_8)|eight series]] of ''The X Factor UK.''\n\nMost recently, it was covered by Jessica Espinoza during her audition for the [[The X Factor USA (season 2)|second season]] of ''The X Factor USA''.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] was shot in [[London]] by director [[Jake Nava]]. The first scene features Pink in a hotel room (shot in [[The May Fair]] hotel) staring out of a window to London at night, that changes to sunrise. She then watches TV but finds there's hardly anything on apart from a melting snowman and puts her head under her pillow before accessing her laptop computer. During the video she messes up the room by throwing everything around, and she is later seen sitting in the [[fetal position]] in a shower. Another scene shows Pink walking down a street, past a couple in love and some drunken men.

It was released on November 20, 2006 in Britain and Ireland and during January 2007 in [[Australia]] and Europe. The song recorded significant digital sales in 2012 with the release of P!nk's sixth album ''[[The Truth About Love (Pink album)|The Truth About Love]]'' but never made a Hot 100 debut.\n\n== Composition and critical reception ==\n\"Nobody Knows\" was written by Pink and co-written and produced by [[Billy Mann]]. The song is a [[ballad|piano-ballad]] and deals with her feelings of [[depression (mood)|depression]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E0DB1330F930A35757C0A9609C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=Critic's Choice: New CD's | first=Jon | last=Pareles | date=April 3, 2006 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> The song received positive reviews.

It was the only physical single from ''I'm Not Dead'' to miss the top five on the [[ARIA Singles Chart]], on which it reached its peak in late January 2007, but it was very popular on radio. Two weeks before this, \"[[Who Knew]]\" (the second ''I'm Not Dead'' single) had re-entered the chart and \"[[U + Ur Hand]]\" was still on the chart, which meant that three singles by Pink were in the top fifty (as of January 21, 2007).  On the [[UK Singles Chart]] it was Pink's lowest peaking single at the time, and the first ''I'm Not Dead'' single to miss the top ten.\n\n\"Nobody Knows\" reached number 17 in [[Germany]] and number 74 on the [[Eurochart Hot 100 Singles]] chart. Although it reached the top 40 on the majority of charts on which it appeared, it was not as successful as the album's preceding singles. In [[Canada]] the song was released to radio in mid-January shortly after the success of \"U + Ur Hand\"; in [[Belgium]] \"[[Dear Mr. President (Pink song)|Dear Mr. President]]\" was the fourth single from the album.\n\n==Use in singing competitions==\n\nThe song enjoys great popularity within contestants of TV singing competitions.\n\nThe song was used in 2007 by [[Natalie Gauci]] as her Top 3 performance during [[Australian Idol (season 5)|Australian Idol's Season 5]].\n\nThe song was sung in 2009 by [[Rachel Adedeji]] [[The_X_Factor_(UK_series_6)|sixth series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]''\n\nIt was covered in [[The_X_Factor_(UK_series_7)#Week_3_.2823.2F24_October.29|week 3]] of the [[The_X_Factor_(UK_series_7)|seventh series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' by the boyband [[One Direction]] in 2010. \n\nIn 2011, [[LeRoy Bell]] of ''[[The X Factor USA]]'''s first season covered the song during [[The X Factor (US season 1)|Top 17 Performance]]. It was also covered by [[Jade Richards]] as well as [[Amelia Lily Oliver]] for Bootcamp Stage 2 during [[The_X_Factor_(UK_series_8)|eight series]] of ''The X Factor UK.''\n\nMost recently, it was covered by Jessica Espinoza during her audition for the [[The X Factor USA (season 2)|second season]] of ''The X Factor USA''.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] was shot in [[London]] by director [[Jake Nava]]. The first scene features Pink in a hotel room (shot in [[The May Fair]] hotel) staring out of a window to London at night, that changes to sunrise. She then watches TV but finds there's hardly anything on apart from a melting snowman and puts her head under her pillow before accessing her laptop computer. During the video she messes up the room by throwing everything around, and she is later seen sitting in the [[fetal position]] in a shower. Another scene shows Pink walking down a street, past a couple in love and some drunken men. The video ends with Pink singing to an empty auditorium, pretending to do a real performance.\n\n==Track listings and formats==\n*'''CD Single'''\n# \"Nobody Knows\" [Album Version] - 3:57\n# \"Words\" - 3:06\n\n*'''Promo CD Single'''\n# \"Nobody Knows\" - 3:59\n\n==Charts==\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Turani attended [[Kashgar University|Kashgar Teacher's College]] and graduated from the Department of Physics in July 1983. Turani came to the United States on August 12, 1988 and became the first Uyghur political asylee. In 1995, Turani established the East Turkistan National Freedom Center (ETNFC), a non-profit human rights organization based in Washington DC. He is the first person to start the [[East Turkistan independence movement]] in the United States. In 2004, Turani and other prominent Uyghur independence activists set up the East Turkistan Government in Exile (ETGIE) and Turani was elected as the first Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bovingdon |first1=Gardner |title=The Uyghurs: Strangers in Their Own Land |year=2010 |publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York |pages=150\u2013151 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westernstandard.ca/website/article.php?id=2542&start=1 |title=The Uyghur pawn |first=Kevin |last=Steel |date=2007-05-21 |work=[[Western Standard]] |page=2 |accessdate=2012-01-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020225351/http://www.westernstandard.ca/website/article.php?id=2542&start=1 |archive-date=October 20, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Activism==\n===East Turkistan National Freedom Center===\nAs the president of the East Turkistan National Freedom Center, Turani organized demonstrations, conferences and cultural events, concerning the situation of East Turkistan.

Later that month, Turani and representatives of occupied Tibet and Inner Mongolia organized an Independence Walk from the Chinese embassy in Washington D.C. to the [[United Nations]] in New York City. At the end of the two-week walk, Turani spoke in front of the United Nations headquarters, addressing the Chinese human rights violations in East Turkistan since 1949.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZgH_Df7O64 UN Speech by Anwar Yusuf Turani (Part 1), April 25, 1996]</ref>\n\nIn June 1997, along with the support of the [[Tibetan Independence Movement]], Turani cut one of the five stars from the national flag of China in front of the United Nations.

The [[Samurai cinema|samurai films]] of [[Akira Kurosawa]] was another inspiration, and ''Star Wars'' protagonist [[Han Solo]] also influenced the character's portrayal. The Mandalorian is voiced and primarily portrayed by [[Pedro Pascal]]. Favreau approached him for the role, and fellow actor [[Oscar Isaac]] urged Pascal to accept the part.\n\nPascal was working on multiple projects at the same time as ''The Mandalorian'', so he does not appear in every episode. Actor Brendan Wayne and stunt performer [[Lateef Crowder dos Santos|Lateef Crowder]] portray the character when Pascal is unavailable. The Mandalorian's costume was created by [[Legacy Effects]] and bears similarities to ''Star Wars'' character [[Boba Fett]], though the ''Mandalorian'' filmmakers deliberately sought to establish differences between the two costumes. The costume presented challenges for the actors portraying the Mandalorian, and the physicality of the character is very important for the performance because small gestures appear much more exaggerated when the costume is worn.\n\nThe dynamic between the Mandalorian and the Child embody a theme of parenting and fatherhood prevalent throughout ''The Mandalorian''. The character and Pascal's performance have received generally positive reviews, with negative reviews criticizing the fact that Pascal's face is constantly concealed by the costume.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Backstory===\nThe Mandalorian's real name is Din Djarin, though that is not revealed until, \"[[Chapter 8: Redemption]]\", the first-season finale of ''[[The Mandalorian]]''.<ref name=\"Elvy1228\">{{cite news |last=Elvy |first=Craig |title=The Mandalorian Explained: Real Name, Face Under Mask, Origin & Backstory |work=[[Screen Rant]] |date=December 28, 2019 |url=https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-name-face-story-din-djarin-explained/ |accessdate=March 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200213202404/https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-name-face-story-din-djarin-explained/ |archive-date=February 13, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> Aspects of the character's backstory are provided gradually over the course of the season.

It feels sometimes like not too much is left to the imagination in terms of what's there.\"<ref name=\"Thorne1111\" />\n\nThe use of this filming technology, rather than a traditional green screen backdrop, allowed the ''Mandalorian'' filmmakers to avoid challenges that would be associated with the reflection of the green screen against the Mandalorian's reflective helmet and armor costume.<ref name=\"Holben0206\" /> Imagery was projected onto 360-degree [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] walls, which not only provided photorealistic sets for the actors to perform against, but also allowed the reflections that appeared on the Mandalorian's cosutme to reflect the setting around him as if it were a real-world location.<ref name=\"Holben0206\" /> [[Cinematographer]] [[Greig Fraser]] said: \"When you're dealing with a reflective subject like the Mandalorian, the world outside the camera frame is often more important than the world you see in the camera\u2019s field of view. What's behind the camera is reflected in the actor's helmet and costume, and that\u2019s crucial to selling the illusion that he's in that environment.\"<ref name=\"Holben0206\" /> A long, narrow band of white near the top of the LED wall served an additional purpose of providing a backlight look on the Mandalorian's helmet. The filmmakers would also occasionally request additional lighting be projected onto the wall of the set, so that it would reflect onto the Mandalorian's costume and provide additional definition to the character's shape.<ref name=\"Holben0206\" /> Fraser said filming the chrome helmet of the Mandalorian in particular is a challenge because its sharp edges can \"quickly look video-like\" if the lens on the camera is too sharp. This problem was resolved via the use of full-frame Ultra Vista anamoprhic lenses by [[Panavision]] that were modified to provide a softer sharpness. These lenses were too soft for human faces, so different filming techniques were used on unmasked characters than those used for the Mandalorian.<ref name=\"Holben0206\" />\n\nUpon first accepting the role, Pascal thought the large amount of enthusiasm among ''Star Wars'' fans would prove intimidating, but he later said it ultimately supported his performance: \"As a cast member, to have that kind of support to life you into it, is such an essential component \u2013 more so than anything I've done before.\"<ref name=\"Young0205-36\">{{Harvnb|Young|2020|p=36}}</ref> Pascal felt Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni shielded him and the rest of the cast and crew from the pressures that might otherwise have been associated with filming the first live-action ''Star Wars'' series and one of the first shows for the [[Disney+]] streaming service, instead creating an environment where they could focus on the work.<ref>{{cite AV media |author-last=Pascal |author-first=Pedro |author-link=Pedro Pascal |date=August 24, 2019 |title=The Mandalorian |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |medium=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_Xn-MPB-bI |access-date=March 10, 2020 |time=2:02\u20132:14 |quote=You'd think that we felt a lot of pressure but somehow Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau shielded us from that and made it just this environment where we could just come and create and play and work really, really, really hard. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200305000623/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_Xn-MPB-bI |archive-date=March 5, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> Favreau felt the Mandalorian character worked well and was very engaging despite not being seen behind the costume, noting that many beloved ''Star Wars'' characters lack [[anthropomorphism]], citing [[R2-D2]] as an example.<ref name=\"Hibberd0905\" /> Gina Carano said Pascal tries to convey his own doubts and vulnerabilities as an actor through his performances, which she felt ultimately makes the Mandalorian more relatable. She said: \"You want to know who is this guy underneath here. You can feel his personality, you want to know more about him. He's so sexy.\"<ref>{{cite podcast |last=Carano |first=Gina |author-link=Gina Carano |url=https://open.spotify.com/episode/3GWZ11CceJM0masVigxleM?si=KfmoDCmETgOtZ51kSrtg_A |title=Still Watching: The Mandalorian \u2014 \"Chapter Four: Sanctuary\" with Gina Carano |publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=November 29, 2019 |access-date=January 29, 2020 |time=56:02\u201356:45 |quote=Pedro, he said something earlier to me, he said, 'I play my characters how I feel sometimes.'

So he's very vulnerable in a beautiful way. So when he puts on this Mandalorian costume you can kind of feel a little bit of that vulnerability which is such a great contrast, and it just makes him that much more mysterious. You want to know who is this guy underneath here. You can feel his personality, you want to know more about him. He's so sexy.}}</ref> Favreau paid close attention to minor details about the Mandalorian character, including one instance in which he felt the Mandalorian's boots did not have the appropriate level of frost on them for scenes on an icy planet, so he had them modified to include more frost.<ref>{{harvnb|Pascal|Breznican|2019|loc=62:51\u201363:35 Pascal: \"Jon is a freak.

And then I walk into my dressing room and the boots had been worked on and they looked exactly what my boots would've looked like after walking through a blizzard in New York City.\"}}</ref>\n\nPascal said because the character speaks so seldom, he had to recall his acting school lessons to convey the character's emotions simply with \"posture and gesture\".<ref name=\"Thorne1111\" /><ref name=\"Pascal5016\">{{harvnb|Pascal|Breznican|2019|loc=50:16\u201351:03 I'm not going to lie, it's really strange, but not altogether new.

I remember doing commedia dell'arte and an entire portion of this one play where I had to do it in a mask and in very, very animated and exaggerated way, use your body to tell the story. This is very much like that but in the opposite tone of economical movements.}}</ref> Pascal called this a very detail-oriented process,<ref>{{harvnb|Pascal|Breznican|2019|loc=47:10\u201347:35 Pascal: \"It's been a really interesting improvisation in terms of figuring out what his posture is, how he moves, how he walks, how he communicates, how he makes a point, and how the voice exists under the mask. It's very detail-oriented.\"}}</ref> noting that small gestures had a large emotive impact, requiring vigilance about each subtle movement.<ref>{{harvnb|Pascal|Breznican|2019|loc=51:46\u201352:20 Pascal: \"That's like the dominant thing about it is figuring all of those details out, and all of the tricks or habits really that you develop, the way that you hold your head or, like, fidgets don't really work with this character so you have to be hyper vigilant bout that stuff. it's exhausting.\"}}</ref> Pascal said his past stage acting experience also helped with this, including his performances in works of [[commedia dell'arte]], in which he wore masks and delivered performances in animated and exaggerated ways to convey emotions. He said portraying the Mandalorian was similar, but \"in the opposite tone of economical movements\".<ref name=\"Pascal5016\" /> Deborah Chow said physicality was extremely important in working with the character, and that they needed to develop a physical language for the Mandalorian: \"All his movement is intentional. There's no fidgeting or relaxing, so that any time, even if he makes a small move or turns his head, it becomes meaningful. We couldn't do it with his face or with his eyes.\"<ref name=\"Itzkoff1122\" /> Much of that physicality was dictated by the costume itself and the weight distribution necessary to move in it.<ref>{{harvnb|Pascal|Breznican|2019|loc=49:44\u201350:16 Breznican: \"How much of your physicality is dictated by the costume, by the weight of it, by the boots, by the armor you're wearing on your body? Sometimes restriction is good, it helps you find a character.\" Pascal: \"I would say only about 100%. It's all about weight distribution and using the design of the costume to share the character.\"}}</ref> Brendan Wayne said the type of walk they wanted for the Mandalorian came naturally to him, so much so that when Pascal struggled with it, the filmmakers would suggest he seek Wayne's input.<ref name=\"MillerWayne\" /> Pascal tried to match his vocal performance to the body language, and his recordings were often tweaked in [[post-production]] to achieve this.<ref>{{harvnb|Pascal|Breznican|2019|loc=47:49\u201348:03 Pascal: \"Once we capture the body language on camera, and obviously the voice being specifically connected to that body language, but then we can fine tune it, we can change it in post.\"}}</ref>\n\nPascal was working on multiple projects at the same time as ''The Mandalorian'', so he did not appear in every episode.<ref name=\"MillerWayne\" /> He was not present for the filming of \"Chapter 4: Sanctuary\" at all because he was in rehearsals for a production of ''[[King Lear]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].

Mandalorian feels a connection and parental bond with the Child because of his own childhood, when he was orphaned by the deaths of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorians as a \"foundling\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Nevertheless, fatherhood was not a role the Mandalorian was initially seeking, and he makes repeated early attempts to avoid this responsibility.<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> He first does so in \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", when he leaves the Child with the Client,<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> and then again in \"Chapter 4\" Sanctuary\", when he plans to leave the Child with Omera, a protective mother on the planet Sorgan who is willing to take the Child into her own family.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> The Mandalorian does not fully commit to the role of fatherhood until the first-season finale, \"Chapter 8: Redemption\", when the Child himself is also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\" and the Mandalorian is formally declared to be his father figure.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\n[[Anthony Breznican]] of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the series: \"There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no spit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a parent\u2019s psyche like a dentist\u2019s drill shredding a soft, pink nerve.\"<ref name=\"Breznican1126\" /> Likewise, ''[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]'' writer Kathryn VanArendonk said the show ignores or does not address many parenting details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what the Child eats, when he goes him to sleep, and whether he wears diapers. She wrote: \"''The Mandalorian'' is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a very particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff.\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> VanAnderonk described this as a [[wish fulfillment]] fantasy for parents or prospective parents: \"a vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that\u2019s left are archetypes: the parent, the child\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nGina Carano feels the Child brings a warmth to a series that acts as a counterbalance to the Mandalorian himself, who otherwise acts aloof and unemotional. Carano believes in this way, the Child \"raises the emotional level and the stakes\" of the series.<ref name=\"Breznican1126\">{{cite news |last=Breznican |first=Anthony |title=Baby Yoda Has Conquered the World |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=November 26, 2019 |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/the-mandalorian-star-wars-baby-yoda |accessdate=January 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127163301/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/the-mandalorian-star-wars-baby-yoda |archive-date=November 27, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Breznican echoed this sentiment: \"There is an emotional transference happening here.

Orphaned as a young child, he was adopted into the [[Mandalorian]] culture and became a [[bounty hunter]] and warrior. Originally hired to capture an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] infant known as \"[[The Child (Star Wars)|The Child]]\", the Mandalorian instead protects the Child from a remnant of the fallen [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]].\n\n''The Mandalorian'' creator and [[showrunner]] [[Jon Favreau]] created the character, partially inspired by [[Clint Eastwood]] and his [[Man with No Name]] character in the [[Spaghetti Western]] films directed by [[Sergio Leone]]. The [[Samurai cinema|samurai films]] of [[Akira Kurosawa]] was another inspiration, and ''Star Wars'' protagonist [[Han Solo]] also influenced the character's portrayal. The Mandalorian is voiced and primarily portrayed by [[Pedro Pascal]]. Favreau approached him for the role, and fellow actor [[Oscar Isaac]] urged Pascal to accept the part.\n\nPascal was working on multiple projects at the same time as ''The Mandalorian'', so he does not appear in every episode. Actor Brendan Wayne and stunt performer [[Lateef Crowder dos Santos|Lateef Crowder]] portray the character when Pascal is unavailable. The Mandalorian's costume was created by [[Legacy Effects]] and bears similarities to ''Star Wars'' character [[Boba Fett]], though the ''Mandalorian'' filmmakers deliberately sought to establish differences between the two costumes. The costume presented challenges for the actors portraying the Mandalorian, and the physicality of the character is very important for the performance because small gestures appear much more exaggerated when the costume is worn.\n\nThe dynamic between the Mandalorian and the Child embody a theme of parenting and fatherhood prevalent throughout ''The Mandalorian''. The character and Pascal's performance have received generally positive reviews, with negative reviews criticizing the fact that Pascal's face is constantly concealed by the costume.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Backstory===\nThe Mandalorian's real name is Din Djarin, though that is not revealed until, \"[[Chapter 8: Redemption]]\", the first-season finale of ''[[The Mandalorian]]''.<ref name=\"Elvy1228\">{{cite news |last=Elvy |first=Craig |title=The Mandalorian Explained: Real Name, Face Under Mask, Origin & Backstory |work=[[Screen Rant]] |date=December 28, 2019 |url=https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-name-face-story-din-djarin-explained/ |accessdate=March 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200213202404/https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-name-face-story-din-djarin-explained/ |archive-date=February 13, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> Aspects of the character's backstory are provided gradually over the course of the season.

It feels sometimes like not too much is left to the imagination in terms of what's there.\"<ref name=\"Thorne1111\" />\n\nThe use of this filming technology, rather than a traditional green screen backdrop, allowed the ''Mandalorian'' filmmakers to avoid challenges that would be associated with the reflection of the green screen against the Mandalorian's reflective helmet and armor costume.<ref name=\"Holben0206\" /> Imagery was projected onto 360-degree [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] walls, which not only provided photorealistic sets for the actors to perform against, but also allowed the reflections that appeared on the Mandalorian's cosutme to reflect the setting around him as if it were a real-world location.<ref name=\"Holben0206\" /> [[Cinematographer]] [[Greig Fraser]] said: \"When you're dealing with a reflective subject like the Mandalorian, the world outside the camera frame is often more important than the world you see in the camera\u2019s field of view. What's behind the camera is reflected in the actor's helmet and costume, and that\u2019s crucial to selling the illusion that he's in that environment.\"<ref name=\"Holben0206\" /> A long, narrow band of white near the top of the LED wall served an additional purpose of providing a backlight look on the Mandalorian's helmet. The filmmakers would also occasionally request additional lighting be projected onto the wall of the set, so that it would reflect onto the Mandalorian's costume and provide additional definition to the character's shape.<ref name=\"Holben0206\" /> Fraser said filming the chrome helmet of the Mandalorian in particular is a challenge because its sharp edges can \"quickly look video-like\" if the lens on the camera is too sharp. This problem was resolved via the use of full-frame Ultra Vista anamoprhic lenses by [[Panavision]] that were modified to provide a softer sharpness. These lenses were too soft for human faces, so different filming techniques were used on unmasked characters than those used for the Mandalorian.<ref name=\"Holben0206\" />\n\nUpon first accepting the role, Pascal thought the large amount of enthusiasm among ''Star Wars'' fans would prove intimidating, but he later said it ultimately supported his performance: \"As a cast member, to have that kind of support to life you into it, is such an essential component \u2013 more so than anything I've done before.\"<ref name=\"Young0205-36\">{{Harvnb|Young|2020|p=36}}</ref> Pascal felt Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni shielded him and the rest of the cast and crew from the pressures that might otherwise have been associated with filming the first live-action ''Star Wars'' series and one of the first shows for the [[Disney+]] streaming service, instead creating an environment where they could focus on the work.<ref>{{cite AV media |author-last=Pascal |author-first=Pedro |author-link=Pedro Pascal |date=August 24, 2019 |title=The Mandalorian |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |medium=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_Xn-MPB-bI |access-date=March 10, 2020 |time=2:02\u20132:14 |quote=You'd think that we felt a lot of pressure but somehow Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau shielded us from that and made it just this environment where we could just come and create and play and work really, really, really hard. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200305000623/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_Xn-MPB-bI |archive-date=March 5, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> Favreau felt the Mandalorian character worked well and was very engaging despite not being seen behind the costume, noting that many beloved ''Star Wars'' characters lack [[anthropomorphism]], citing [[R2-D2]] as an example.<ref name=\"Hibberd0905\" /> Gina Carano said Pascal tries to convey his own doubts and vulnerabilities as an actor through his performances, which she felt ultimately makes the Mandalorian more relatable. She said: \"You want to know who is this guy underneath here. You can feel his personality, you want to know more about him. He's so sexy.\"<ref>{{cite podcast |last=Carano |first=Gina |author-link=Gina Carano |url=https://open.spotify.com/episode/3GWZ11CceJM0masVigxleM?si=KfmoDCmETgOtZ51kSrtg_A |title=Still Watching: The Mandalorian \u2014 \"Chapter Four: Sanctuary\" with Gina Carano |publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=November 29, 2019 |access-date=January 29, 2020 |time=56:02\u201356:45 |quote=Pedro, he said something earlier to me, he said, 'I play my characters how I feel sometimes.'

So he's very vulnerable in a beautiful way. So when he puts on this Mandalorian costume you can kind of feel a little bit of that vulnerability which is such a great contrast, and it just makes him that much more mysterious. You want to know who is this guy underneath here. You can feel his personality, you want to know more about him. He's so sexy.}}</ref> Favreau paid close attention to minor details about the Mandalorian character, including one instance in which he felt the Mandalorian's boots did not have the appropriate level of frost on them for scenes on an icy planet, so he had them modified to include more frost.<ref>{{harvnb|Pascal|Breznican|2019|loc=62:51\u201363:35 Pascal: \"Jon is a freak.

And then I walk into my dressing room and the boots had been worked on and they looked exactly what my boots would've looked like after walking through a blizzard in New York City.\"}}</ref>\n\nPascal said because the character speaks so seldom, he had to recall his acting school lessons to convey the character's emotions simply with \"posture and gesture\".<ref name=\"Thorne1111\" /><ref name=\"Pascal5016\">{{harvnb|Pascal|Breznican|2019|loc=50:16\u201351:03 I'm not going to lie, it's really strange, but not altogether new.

I remember doing commedia dell'arte and an entire portion of this one play where I had to do it in a mask and in very, very animated and exaggerated way, use your body to tell the story. This is very much like that but in the opposite tone of economical movements.}}</ref> Pascal called this a very detail-oriented process,<ref>{{harvnb|Pascal|Breznican|2019|loc=47:10\u201347:35 Pascal: \"It's been a really interesting improvisation in terms of figuring out what his posture is, how he moves, how he walks, how he communicates, how he makes a point, and how the voice exists under the mask. It's very detail-oriented.\"}}</ref> noting that small gestures had a large emotive impact, requiring vigilance about each subtle movement.<ref>{{harvnb|Pascal|Breznican|2019|loc=51:46\u201352:20 Pascal: \"That's like the dominant thing about it is figuring all of those details out, and all of the tricks or habits really that you develop, the way that you hold your head or, like, fidgets don't really work with this character so you have to be hyper vigilant bout that stuff. it's exhausting.\"}}</ref> Pascal said his past stage acting experience also helped with this, including his performances in works of [[commedia dell'arte]], in which he wore masks and delivered performances in animated and exaggerated ways to convey emotions. He said portraying the Mandalorian was similar, but \"in the opposite tone of economical movements\".<ref name=\"Pascal5016\" /> Deborah Chow said physicality was extremely important in working with the character, and that they needed to develop a physical language for the Mandalorian: \"All his movement is intentional. There's no fidgeting or relaxing, so that any time, even if he makes a small move or turns his head, it becomes meaningful. We couldn't do it with his face or with his eyes.\"<ref name=\"Itzkoff1122\" /> Much of that physicality was dictated by the costume itself and the weight distribution necessary to move in it.<ref>{{harvnb|Pascal|Breznican|2019|loc=49:44\u201350:16 Breznican: \"How much of your physicality is dictated by the costume, by the weight of it, by the boots, by the armor you're wearing on your body? Sometimes restriction is good, it helps you find a character.\" Pascal: \"I would say only about 100%. It's all about weight distribution and using the design of the costume to share the character.\"}}</ref> Brendan Wayne said the type of walk they wanted for the Mandalorian came naturally to him, so much so that when Pascal struggled with it, the filmmakers would suggest he seek Wayne's input.<ref name=\"MillerWayne\" /> Pascal tried to match his vocal performance to the body language, and his recordings were often tweaked in [[post-production]] to achieve this.<ref>{{harvnb|Pascal|Breznican|2019|loc=47:49\u201348:03 Pascal: \"Once we capture the body language on camera, and obviously the voice being specifically connected to that body language, but then we can fine tune it, we can change it in post.\"}}</ref>\n\nPascal was working on multiple projects at the same time as ''The Mandalorian'', so he did not appear in every episode.<ref name=\"MillerWayne\" /> He was not present for the filming of \"Chapter 4: Sanctuary\" at all because he was in rehearsals for a production of ''[[King Lear]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].

Mandalorian feels a connection and parental bond with the Child because of his own childhood, when he was orphaned by the deaths of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorians as a \"foundling\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Nevertheless, fatherhood was not a role the Mandalorian was initially seeking, and he makes repeated early attempts to avoid this responsibility.<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> He first does so in \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", when he leaves the Child with the Client,<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> and then again in \"Chapter 4\" Sanctuary\", when he plans to leave the Child with Omera, a protective mother on the planet Sorgan who is willing to take the Child into her own family.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> The Mandalorian does not fully commit to the role of fatherhood until the first-season finale, \"Chapter 8: Redemption\", when the Child himself is also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\" and the Mandalorian is formally declared to be his father figure.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\n[[Anthony Breznican]] of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the series: \"There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no spit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a parent\u2019s psyche like a dentist\u2019s drill shredding a soft, pink nerve.\"<ref name=\"Breznican1126\" /> Likewise, ''[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]'' writer Kathryn VanArendonk said the show ignores or does not address many parenting details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what the Child eats, when he goes him to sleep, and whether he wears diapers. She wrote: \"''The Mandalorian'' is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a very particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff.\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> VanAnderonk described this as a [[wish fulfillment]] fantasy for parents or prospective parents: \"a vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that\u2019s left are archetypes: the parent, the child\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nGina Carano feels the Child brings a warmth to a series that acts as a counterbalance to the Mandalorian himself, who otherwise acts aloof and unemotional. Carano believes in this way, the Child \"raises the emotional level and the stakes\" of the series.<ref name=\"Breznican1126\">{{cite news |last=Breznican |first=Anthony |title=Baby Yoda Has Conquered the World |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=November 26, 2019 |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/the-mandalorian-star-wars-baby-yoda |accessdate=January 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127163301/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/the-mandalorian-star-wars-baby-yoda |archive-date=November 27, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Breznican echoed this sentiment: \"There is an emotional transference happening here.

And if you\u2019ve undergone chemotherapy and come out the other side, it\u2019s very real to you.  Or maybe it\u2019s the pain of those who have lost loved ones; suddenly, or recently, unexpectedly or over a long period of time, some dying. But the in-breath is... you find some place on the planet in your personal life or something you know about, and you breathe in with the wish that those human beings or those mistreated animals or whoever it is, that they could be free of that suffering, and you breathe in with the longing to remove their suffering.  \n\nAnd then you send out \u2013 just relax out... send enough space so that peoples\u2019 hearts and minds feel big enough to live with their discomfort, their fear, their anger or their despair, or their physical or mental anguish. But you can also breathe out for those who have no food and drink, you can breathe out food and drink. For those who are homeless, you can breathe out/send them shelter.  For those who are suffering in any way, you can send out safety, comfort.  \n\nSo in the in-breath you breathe in with the wish to take away the suffering and breathe out with the wish to send comfort and happiness to the same people, animals, nations, or whatever it is you decide.\n\nDo this for an individual, or do this for large areas, and if you do this with more than one subject in mind, that\u2019s fine\u2026 breathing in as fully as you can, radiating out as widely as you can.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n \"Tonglen Meditation\" |publisher=[[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwqlurCvXuM|date=Jul 24, 2009|accessdate=September 10, 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nWhile this might seem like an outrageous thing to do \u2013 breathe in suffering and breathe out joy, part of the practice is to work with habitual patterns of mind and \"develop the psychological attitude of exchanging oneself for others,\" as [[Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa|Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche]] writes in ''Training the Mind and Cultivating Kindness''. \n\nTaking onto oneself the suffering of others and giving happiness and success to all sentient beings seems a heavy task, especially for a beginner in the practice.<ref name=\"views\"/> It might be appropriate to start out with smaller issues, like working with oneself to increase one's own well-being, increasing harmony in the family, open one's own mind to communicate better with other people or just finding more peace in doing the necessary daily chores. This is an area where it might be easier to experience some success in order to be able to go on with taking on the unhappiness or conflicts among other people, even though the principal aim is to develop one's own selfless and empathic qualities more than or at least as much as creating a real difference for others.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tonglen|url=http://www.interluderetreat.com/meditate/tonglen.htm|publisher=Interlude: An Internet Retreat|accessdate=September 10, 2015}}</ref> The principle of taking in the suffering or disharmony on the in-breath and spreading an antidote of joy, harmony or peace of mind (or whatever might be needed in the specific case) on the out-breath is the same as described above. It is also a good option to use a small pause after the in-breath to convert the suffering or disharmony to the positive antidote which is to be breathed out.\n\nTaking on suffering does not really mean to burden oneself with the misery of the world, but rather to acknowledge its existence and accept it.
