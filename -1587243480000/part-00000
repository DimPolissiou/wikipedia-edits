Recurring characters include the aforementioned cowboys, [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]], [[Spaniards]], [[Mexicans]], bandits, lawmen, [[bounty hunter]]s, [[Outlaw (stock character)#American Western|outlaws]], [[gambling|gamblers]], soldiers (especially mounted cavalry, such as [[buffalo soldiers]]), and settlers (farmers, ranchers, and townsfolk).

The popularity of Westerns continued to grow in the 1940s, with the release of films such as ''[[The Ox-Bow Incident]]'' (1943), ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946), ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' (1948), and ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' (1948). The 1950s have been described as the \"Golden Age of the Western,\" and saw the release of films such as ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' (1950), ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953), ''[[Wichita (1955 film)|Wichita]]'' (1955),  ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), and ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959). Notable Western films released in the 1960s include ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), and ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William.

Fear of the mysterious.\"]]\nThe Western genre sometimes portrays the conquest of the wilderness and the subordination of nature in the name of civilization or the confiscation of the territorial rights of the original, Native American, inhabitants of the frontier.<ref name=\"kimnewman\">{{cite book| last=Newman | first=Kim | title=Wild West Movies | publisher=Bloomsbury | year=1990}}</ref>  The Western depicts a society organized around codes of [[honor]] and personal, direct or private justice\u2013\"frontier justice\"\u2013dispensed by gunfights. These honor codes are often played out through depictions of feuds or individuals seeking personal [[revenge]] or [[wikt:retribution|retribution]] against someone who has wronged them (e.g., ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' has revenge and retribution as its main themes). This Western depiction of personal justice contrasts sharply with justice systems organized around rationalistic, abstract law that exist in cities, in which [[social order]] is maintained predominately through relatively impersonal institutions such as [[courtroom]]s. The popular perception of the Western is a story that centers on the life of a semi-nomadic wanderer, usually a [[cowboy]] or a [[gunfighter]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/>  A showdown or [[Duel#Colonial North America and United States|duel]] at high noon featuring two or more gunfighters is a stereotypical scene in the popular conception of Westerns.\n\nIn some ways, such protagonists may be considered the literary descendants of the [[Knight-errant|knights errant]] which stood at the center of earlier extensive genres such as the [[King Arthur|Arthurian Romances]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/> Like the cowboy or gunfighter of the Western, the knight errant of the earlier European tales and poetry was wandering from place to place on his horse, fighting villains of various kinds and bound to no fixed social structures, but only to their own innate code of honor. And like knights errant, the heroes of Westerns frequently rescue [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]]. Similarly, the wandering protagonists of Westerns share many characteristics with the [[ronin]] in modern Japanese culture.\n\nThe Western typically takes these elements and uses them to tell simple morality tales, although some notable examples (e.g. the later Westerns of [[John Ford]] or [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[Unforgiven]]'', about an old hired killer) are more morally ambiguous. Westerns often stress the harshness and isolation of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape. Western films generally have specific settings such as isolated ranches, Native American villages, or small frontier towns with a saloon. Oftentimes, these settings appear deserted and without much structure. Apart from the wilderness, it is usually the saloon that emphasizes that this is the [[Wild West]]: it is the place to go for music (raucous piano playing), women (often [[prostitute]]s), gambling (draw poker or five card stud), drinking (beer or whiskey), brawling and shooting. In some Westerns, where civilization has arrived, the town has a church, a general store, a bank and a school; in others, where frontier rules still hold sway, it is, as [[Sergio Leone]] said, \"where life has no value\".\n\n==Film==\n\n===Characteristics===\n[[File:Gary Cooper 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gary Cooper]] in ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'']]\nThe [[American Film Institute]] defines Western films as those \"set in the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle and the demise of the [[Frontier Thesis|new frontier]].\"<ref>{{cite web| title=America's 10 Greatest Films in 10 Classic Genres| url= http://www.afi.com/10top10/ | publisher=[[American Film Institute]] | accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>  The term ''Western'', used to describe a narrative film genre, appears to have originated with a July 1912 article in ''Motion Picture World'' magazine.<ref>McMahan, Alison; ''Alice Guy Blache: Lost Visionary of the Cinema''; New York: Continuum, 2002; 133</ref> Most of the characteristics of Western films were part of 19th-century popular [[Western fiction]] and were firmly in place before film became a popular art form.<ref>Henry Nash Smith, ''Virgin Land: The American West as Symbol and Myth'', Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1950.</ref>  Western films commonly feature protagonists such as cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, who are often depicted as semi-nomadic wanderers who wear [[Stetson]] hats, [[Kerchief|bandanna]]s, spurs, and [[buckskins]], use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survival\u2013and as a means to settle disputes using \"frontier justice\". Protagonists ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nWestern films were enormously popular in the [[silent film]] era (1894-1927). With the advent of sound in 1927-28, the major Hollywood studios rapidly abandoned Westerns,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/magazine/11schatz.html, ''New York Times Magazine''] (November 10, 2007).</ref> leaving the genre to smaller studios and producers. These smaller organizations churned out countless low-budget features and serials in the 1930s. By the late 1930s, the Western film was widely regarded as a \"pulp\" genre in Hollywood, but its popularity was dramatically revived in 1939 by major studio productions such as ''[[Dodge City (film)|Dodge City]]'' starring [[Errol Flynn]], ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' with [[Tyrone Power]], ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' with [[Joel McCrea]], ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' featuring [[James Stewart]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and the release of John Ford's landmark Western adventure ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', which became one of the biggest hits of the year. Released through United Artists, ''Stagecoach'' made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream screen star in the wake of a decade of headlining [[B Westerns]]. Wayne had been introduced to the screen ten years earlier as the [[leading man]] in director [[Raoul Walsh]]'s [[widescreen]] ''[[The Big Trail]]'', which failed at the box office, due in part to exhibitors' inability to switch over to widescreen during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. After the Western's renewed commercial successes in the late 1930s, the popularity of the Western continued to rise until its peak in the 1950s, when the number of Western films produced outnumbered all other genres combined.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William.

While early Eurocentric Westerns frequently portray the \"Injuns\" as dishonorable villains, the later and more culturally neutral Westerns gave Native Americans a more sympathetic treatment.  Other recurring themes of Westerns include Western treks (e.g. ''The Big Trail'') or perilous journeys (e.g. ''Stagecoach'') or groups of bandits terrorising small towns such as in ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''.\n\nEarly Westerns were mostly filmed in the studio, as in other early Hollywood films, but when location shooting became more common from the 1930s, producers of Westerns used desolate corners of [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], or [[Wyoming]]. These settings gave filmmakers the ability to depict vast plains, looming mountains and epic canyons. Productions were also filmed on location at [[movie ranches]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nOften, the vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop; it becomes a character in the film. After the early 1950s, various wide screen formats such as [[Cinemascope]] (1953) and [[VistaVision]] used the expanded width of the screen to display spectacular Western landscapes. [[John Ford]]'s use of [[Monument Valley]] as an expressive landscape in his films from ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) to ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1965) \"present us with a mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West, embodied most memorably in Monument Valley, with its buttes and mesas that tower above the men on horseback, whether they be settlers, soldiers, or Native Americans\".<ref name=\"Cowie 2004\"/>\n\n===Subgenres===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Dan Duryea in Along Came Jones trailer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dan Duryea]] in ''[[Along Came Jones (film)|Along Came Jones]]'' (1945)]]\nAuthor and screenwriter [[Frank Gruber]] described seven plots for Westerns:<ref>Gruber, Frank  ''The Pulp Jungle'' Sherbourne Press, 1967</ref><ref name=\"cgw199010\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |title=No Soft Soap About New And Improved Computer Games |work=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1990 |accessdate=16 November 2013 |page=80 |type=editorial |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233126/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |archivedate=2 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\n# ''Union Pacific story''.

So you see scenes that are like gunfighters squaring off, like [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Lee Van Cleef]]\u2014we have [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] and others like that.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.local-iq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3019&Itemid=56 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403091323/http://www.local-iq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3019&Itemid=56 |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 April 2013 |title=Contemporary Western: An interview with Vince Gilligan |date=27 March 2013 |publisher=[[Local iQ]] |work=News |accessdate=31 May 2013 |place=United States }}</ref>\n\nThe precursor to these{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} was the radio series ''[[Tales of the Texas Rangers]]'' (1950\u20131952), with [[Joel McCrea]], a contemporary detective drama set in Texas, featuring many of the characteristics of traditional Westerns.\n\n====Electric Western====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Zachariah.jpg|right|thumbnail|''[[Zachariah (film)|Zachariah]]'' (1971)]] -->\nThe 1971 film ''[[Zachariah (film)|Zachariah]]'' starring [[John Rubinstein]], [[Don Johnson]] and [[Pat Quinn (actress)|Pat Quinn]] was billed as the \"first electric Western.\"<ref name=NYT/> The film featured multiple performing [[musical ensemble|rock bands]] in an otherwise [[American frontier|American West]] setting.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D05E3DE163BE53BBC4D51DFB766838A669EDE|title=Zachariah (1970) Screen: 'Zachariah,' an Odd Western|authorlink=Roger Greenspun|author=Greenspun, Roger|date=January 25, 1971}}</ref>\n\n''Zachariah'' featured appearances and music supplied by rock groups from the 1970s, including the [[James Gang]]<ref name=NYT/> and [[Country Joe and the Fish]] as \"The Cracker Band.\"<ref name=NYT/> Fiddler [[Doug Kershaw]] had a musical cameo<ref name=NYT/> as does [[Elvin Jones]] as a gunslinging drummer named Job Cain.<ref name=NYT/>\n\nThe [[independent film]] ''Hate Horses'' starring [[Dominique Swain]], [[Ron Thompson (actor)|Ron Thompson]] and [[Paul Dooley]] billed itself as the \"second electric Western.\"<ref>{{cite video|work=[[YouTube]]|date=2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgTXHXiP7lk|title=Hate Horses - Official Trailer}}</ref>\n\n====Epic Western====\nThe epic Western is a subgenre of the Western that emphasizes the story of the American Old West on a grand scale. Many epic Westerns are commonly set during a turbulent time, especially a war, as in Sergio Leone's ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), set during the American Civil War, or Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), set during the Mexican Revolution. One of the grandest films in this genre is Leone's ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), which shows many operatic conflicts centered on control of a town while utilizing wide scale shots on Monument Valley locations against a broad running time. Other notable examples include ''[[The Iron Horse (film)|The Iron Horse]]'' (1924), ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946), ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), ''[[Cimarron (1960 film)|Cimarron]]'' (1960), [[How the West Was Won (film)|''How the West Was Won'']] (1962), ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'' (1971), ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990), ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' (2007), ''[[Django Unchained]]'' (2012) and  ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'' (2015).\n\n====Euro-Western====\nEuro-Westerns are Western genre films made in [[Western Europe]]. The term can sometimes, but not necessarily, include the [[Spaghetti Western]] subgenre (see below). One example of a Euro Western is the Anglo-Spanish film ''[[Savage Guns (1961 film)|The Savage Guns]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]). Several Euro-Western films, nicknamed Sauerkraut Westerns<ref>{{cite book|page= 118 |authors=Brookeman, Christopher & British Film Institute |title=The BFI Companion to the Western|publisher= A. Deutsch|date= 1993}}</ref> because they were made in [[Germany]] and shot in [[Yugoslavia]], were derived from stories by novelist [[Karl May]] and were [[Karl May film adaptations|film adaptations of May's work]]. Some new Euro-Westerns emerged in the 2010s, including [[Kristian Levring]]'s [[The Salvation (film)|''The Salvation'']], [[Martin Koolhoven]]'s [[Brimstone (2016 film)|''Brimstone'']], and [[Andreas Prochaska]]'s ''[[The Dark Valley]]''.\n\n====Fantasy Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nFantasy Westerns mixed in [[fantasy]] settings and themes, and may include fantasy mythology as background. Some famous examples are [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Stand]]'' and [[The Dark Tower series|''The Dark Tower'' series]] of novels, the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] comics series ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'', and [[Keiichi Sigsawa]]'s light novel series, ''[[Kino's Journey]]'', illustrated by [[Kouhaku Kuroboshi]].\n\n====Florida Western====\n[[Florida Western]]s, also known as Cracker Westerns, are set in [[Florida]] during the [[Second Seminole War]]. An example is ''[[Distant Drums]]'' (1951) starring [[Gary Cooper]].\n\n====Greek Western====\nAccording to the naming conventions after [[Spaghetti Western]], in Greece is also referred to as \"fasolada Western\" (Greek: \u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 = bean soup, i.e. the so called national dish of Greece).

Another example is ''The Ghoul Goes West'', an unproduced [[Ed Wood]] film to star [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Dracula]] in the Old West.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Recent examples include the films ''[[Near Dark]]'' (1987) directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]] which tells the story about a human falling in love with a [[vampire]], ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'' (1996) by [[Robert Rodriguez]] deals with outlaws battling vampires across the border, ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998) by [[John Carpenter]] tells about a group of vampires and vampire hunters looking for an ancient relic in the west, ''[[Ravenous (1999 film)|Ravenous]]'' (1999), which deals with cannibalism at a remote US army outpost; ''[[The Burrowers]]'' (2008), about a band of trackers who are stalked by the titular creatures; and ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'' (2012). ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'' (2010), an expansion to ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game in this genre, telling the tale of a [[zombie]] outbreak in the [[Old West]]. ''[[Bone Tomahawk]]'' (2016) one of the most recent entries in the genre received wide critical acclaim for its chilling tale of cannibalism but, like many other movies in the genre, it wasn't a commercial success.\n\n==== Indo Western ====\nThe first Western films made in India \u2013 ''Mosagaalaku Mosagaadu'' (1970), made in Telugu, ''Mappusakshi'' (Malayalam),{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''[[Ganga (1972 film)|Ganga]]'' (1972), and ''Jakkamma'' (Tamil){{citation needed|date=April 2015}} - were based on Classic Westerns. ''[[Thazhvaram]]'' (1990), the Malayalam film directed by [[Bharathan]] and written by noted writer [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], perhaps most resembles the Spaghetti Westerns in terms of production and cinematic techniques. Earlier Spaghetti Westerns laid the groundwork for such films as ''[[Adima Changala]]'' (1971) starring [[Prem Nazir]], a hugely popular \"zapata Spaghetti Western film in Malayalam, and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) ''[[Khote Sikkay]]'' (1973)  and ''[[Thai Meethu Sathiyam]]'' (1978) are notable Curry Westerns. ''[[Kodama Simham]]'' (1990), a Telugu action film starring [[Chiranjeevi]] and [[Mohan Babu]] was one more addition to the Indo Western genre and fared well at the box office. It was also the first South Indian movie to be dubbed in English as ''Hunters of the Indian Treasure''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |title=Hunters of the Indian Treasure |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205013433/https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |archivedate=2017-02-05 }}</ref>\n\n''[[Takkari Donga]]'' (2002), starring Telugu Maheshbabu, was applauded by critics but an average runner at box office. ''[[Quick Gun Murugun]]'' (2009), an Indian comedy film which spoofs Indian Western movies, is based on a character created for television promos at the time of the launch of the music network Channel [V] in 1994, which had cult following.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/society-the-arts/story/19941015-channel-v-film-funny-irreverent-and-slightly-crazy-809809-1999-11-30|title=Quick Gun Murugan: Channel V comes up with funny, irreverent and slightly crazy film|last=November 30|first=AMIT AGARWAL|last2=October 15|first2=1999 ISSUE DATE|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15|last3=July 24|first3=1994UPDATED|last4=Ist|first4=2013 12:00|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403110409/https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/society-the-arts/story/19941015-channel-v-film-funny-irreverent-and-slightly-crazy-809809-1999-11-30|archive-date=2019-04-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''[[Irumbukkottai Murattu Singam]]'' (2010), a Western adventure comedy film, based on cowboy movies and paying homages to the [[John Wayne]], [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Jaishankar]], was made in Tamil. [[Laal Kaptaan]] (2019) is an Indo western starring [[Saif Ali Khan]] which is set during of rise of [[British Empire]] in India.\n\n====Martial arts Western (Wuxia Western)====\nWhile many of these mash-ups (e.g., ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971) and its sequel ''[[The Trial of Billy Jack]]'' (1974)) are cheap exploitation films, others are more serious dramas such as the ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' TV series, which ran from 1972 to 1975. Comedy examples include the [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Owen Wilson]] collaboration ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'' (2000). Further sub-divisions of this subgenre include ''[[Ninja]] Westerns'' and ''[[Samurai]] Westerns'' (incorporating [[samurai cinema]] themes), such as ''[[Red Sun]]'' (1971) with [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Toshiro Mifune]].\n\n====Meat pie Western====\n{{main|Meat pie Western}} \nThe Meat pie Western (a slang term which plays on the Italo-western moniker \"[[Spaghetti Western]]\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51588737 |title=Hollywood|work=The Australian Women's Weekly|date= November 4, 1981|page= 157|first=John-Michael|last=Howson|accessdate= December 28, 2011}}</ref>) is a Western-style movie or TV series set in Australia, especially the [[Australian Outback]] or the [[The bush#Australia|Australian Bush]].<ref name=AusF>{{cite book|last=Ross Cooper|first=Andrew Pike|title=Australian Film 1900-1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-0195507843|page=310}}</ref> Films such as ''[[Rangle River]]'' (1936), ''[[The Kangaroo Kid (1950 film)|The Kangaroo Kid]]'' (1950),''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'' (1960), ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' (1970), ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]'' (1982)  and ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005) are all representative of the genre.<ref name=DT2018>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/australian-meat-pie-westerns-have-been-around-for-more-than-a-century/news-story/220b01591983bdbc46fef9cacd5fa925?nk=d2a04456400b3ffd92de3375f1b5fc9e-1558436137|publisher=Daily Telegraph|work=Daily Telegraph|date=21 January 2018|title=Australian 'meat pie' westerns have been around for more than a century|first=Troy|last=Lennon|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Northwestern====\nThe [[Northern (genre)|Northern genre]] is a subgenre of Westerns taking place in [[Alaska]] or [[Western Canada]]. Examples include several versions of the [[Rex Beach]] novel, ''[[The Spoilers (Beach novel)|The Spoilers]]'' (including 1930's ''[[The Spoilers (1930 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Gary Cooper, and 1942's ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Marlene Dietrich, [[Randolph Scott]] and Wayne); ''[[The Far Country]]'' (1954) with James Stewart; ''[[North to Alaska]]'' (1960) with Wayne;  ''[[Death Hunt]]'' (1981) with [[Charles Bronson]]; and ''[[The Grey Fox]]'' (1983) with [[Richard Farnsworth]].\n\n====Ostern====\n{{main|Ostern}}\n[[Ostern]]s, also known as \"Red Western\"s, are produced in [[Eastern Europe]]. They were popular in Communist Eastern European countries and were a particular favorite of [[Joseph Stalin]],<nowiki>   and usually portrayed the </nowiki>[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] sympathetically, as oppressed people fighting for their rights, in contrast to American Westerns of the time, which frequently portrayed the Indians as villains. Osterns frequently featured [[Romani people|Gypsies]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people in the role of the Indians, due to the shortage of authentic Indians in Eastern Europe.\n\n[[Gojko Miti\u0107]] portrayed righteous, kind-hearted, and charming Indian [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] (e.g., in ''[[The Sons of the Great Mother Bear|Die S\u00f6hne der gro\u00dfen B\u00e4rin]]'' (1966) directed by [[Josef Mach]]). He became honorary chief of the [[Sioux]] tribe, when he visited the United States in the 1990s and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe one of his films. American actor and singer [[Dean Reed]], an expatriate who lived in [[East Germany]], also starred in several Ostern films.\n\n====Pornographic Western====\nThe most rare of the Western subgenres, pornographic Westerns use the Old West as a background for stories primarily focused on erotica. The three major examples of the porn Western film are [[Russ Meyer]]'s [[nudie-cutie]] ''[[Wild Gals of the Naked West]]'' (1962), and the hardcore ''[[A Dirty Western]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sweet Savage (1979 film)|Sweet Savage]]'' (1979). ''Sweet Savage'' starred [[Aldo Ray]], a veteran actor who had appeared in traditional Westerns, in a non-sex role. Among videogames, ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'' (1982) is an infamous example, considered to be one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games of all time]].\n\n====Ramen Western====\nFirst used in the publicity of the film [[Tampopo]]. the term 'Ramen Western' is play on words using a national dish as a prefix like [[Spaghetti Western]] or Meat Pie Western. The term is used to describe Western style films set in Asia. Examples include ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Weird]]'' and ''[[Sukiyaki Western Django]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ramen Western|url=http://www.criminalelement.com/ramen-westerns-far-east-meets-old-west/|website=criminalelement.com|date=2011-08-16}}</ref>\n\n====Revisionist Western====\nAfter the early 1960s, many American filmmakers began to question and change many traditional elements of Westerns, and to make [[Revisionist Western]]s that encouraged audiences to question the simple hero-versus-villain dualism and the morality of using violence to test one's character or to prove oneself right. This is shown in Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). One major revision was the increasingly positive representation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who had been treated as \"savages\" in earlier films. Examples of such revisionist Westerns include ''[[Ride the High Country]]'' (1962), [[Richard Harris]]' ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' (1970), ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Soldier Blue]] (1970),'' ''[[Man in the Wilderness]]'' (1971), ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990) and ''[[Dead Man]]'' (1995). A few earlier Revisionist Westerns gave women more powerful roles, such as ''[[Westward the Women]]'' (1951) starring [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]].  Another earlier work encompassed all these features, ''[[The Last Wagon (1956 film)|The Last Wagon]]'' (1956). In it, [[Richard Widmark]] played a white man raised by [[Comanche]]s and persecuted by [[white people|whites]], with [[Felicia Farr]] and [[Susan Kohner]] playing young women forced into leadership roles.\n\n====Science fiction Western====\nThe [[science fiction Western]] places [[science fiction]] elements within a traditional Western setting. Examples include ''[[Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter]]'' (1965), ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'' (1969) featuring cowboys and dinosaurs. [[John Jakes]]'s \"Six Gun Planet\" takes place on a future planet colonized by people consciously seeking to recreate the Old West (with cowboys riding robot horses...) [https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Wheels_Six_Gun_Planet.html?id=Q6OGZprSGtcC&redir_esc=y]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The movie ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' (1973) and its sequel ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Wild Wild West]]'' (1999), ''[[Cowboys & Aliens]]'' (2011), and the TV series [[Westworld (TV series)|''Westworld'']] (2016, based on the movie). ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game that follows this format, with futuristic technology and genetic mutations placed among the Western themes and desert sprawl of the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave Wasteland]].\n\n====Space Western====\nThe [[Space Western|Space Western or Space Frontier]] is a subgenre of [[science fiction]] which uses the themes and [[trope (literature)|trope]]s of Westerns within science fiction stories. Subtle influences may include exploration of lawless frontiers in [[Deep space exploration|deep space]], while more overt influences may feature literal [[Space Cowboy (disambiguation)|cowboys in outer space]] who use [[ray gun]]s and ride robotic horses. Examples include the American television series ''[[BraveStarr]]'' (which aired original episodes from September 1987 to February 1988) and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' (created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002), and the films ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980), which is a remake of ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''; ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' (1981), which is a remake of ''[[High Noon]]''; and ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'' (2005, based on the ''Firefly'' TV series). Another example is the Japanese anime series ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]''. The classic Western genre has also been a major influence on science fiction films such as the original ''[[Star Wars: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' movie of 1977, with 2018's ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' and 2019's ''[[Star Wars: The Mandalorian]]'' more directly featuring Western tropes. Famously [[Gene Roddenberry]] pitched the concept of the TV show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' as a \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars.\"\n\n====Spaghetti Western====\n{{main|Spaghetti Western|Zapata Western}}\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, a revival of the Western emerged in [[Italy]] with the \"[[Spaghetti Westerns]]\" also known as \"Italo-Westerns\". The most famous of them is ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), the third film of the [[Dollars Trilogy]].  Many of these films are low-budget affairs, shot in locations (for example, the Spanish desert [[Province of Almer\u00eda|region of Almer\u00eda]]) chosen for their inexpensive crew and production costs as well as their similarity to landscapes of the [[Southwestern United States]]. Spaghetti Westerns were characterized by the presence of more action and violence than the Hollywood Westerns. Also, the protagonists usually acted out of more selfish motives (money or revenge being the most common) than in the classical Westerns.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frayling, Christopher |title=Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone|publisher=IB Tauris|date= 1998}}</ref> Some Spaghetti Westerns demythologized the American Western tradition, and some films from the genre are considered [[revisionist Western]]s.\n[[File:Clint Eastwood - 1960s.JPG|thumb|[[Clint Eastwood]] as the ambiguously-named protagonist of the [[Dollars Trilogy]] (marketed as \"the [[Man with No Name]]\") in a publicity image of ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', a film by [[Sergio Leone]].]]\n\nThe Western films directed by [[Sergio Leone]] were felt by some to have a different tone than the Hollywood Westerns.<ref name=TG/> Veteran American actors [[Charles Bronson]], [[Lee Van Cleef]] and [[Clint Eastwood]]<ref name=TG/> became famous by starring in Spaghetti Westerns, although the films also provided a showcase for other noted actors such as [[James Coburn]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Klaus Kinski]], and [[Jason Robards]].

It is a more rare Western, as most focus during warm weather or areas where it doesn't snow. Popular films of this subgenre are [[Sergio Corbucci|Sergio Corbucci's]] ''[[ The Great Silence ]]'' (1968) and [[Quentin Tarantino|Quentin Tarantino's]] ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' (2015).\n\n====Weird Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nThe [[Weird Western]] subgenre blends elements of a classic Western with other elements. ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' television series, television movies, and 1999 film adaptation blend the Western with [[steampunk]]. The ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' franchise also blends the Western with superhero elements. The film ''[[Western Religion (film)|Western Religion]]'' (2015), by writer and director [[James O'Brien (filmmaker)|James O'Brien]], introduces the devil into a traditional wild west setting. The ''[[Old Man Logan]]'' (2008-2009) graphic novel combines the elements of superhero and post-apocalyptic fiction with Western.\n\n===Genre studies===\n[[File:Tommixgunslinger.jpg|[[Tom Mix]] in ''Mr. Logan, U.S.A.'', c. 1919|thumb]]\n\nIn the 1960s academic and critical attention to cinema as a legitimate art form emerged. With the increased attention, [[film theory]] was developed to attempt to understand the significance of film. From this environment emerged (in conjunction with the literary movement) an enclave of critical studies called [[genre studies]]. This was primarily a semantic and structuralist approach to understanding how similar films convey meaning.\n\nOne of the results of genre studies is that some{{who|date=April 2013}} have argued that \"Westerns\" need not take place in the American West or even in the 19th century, as the codes can be found in other types of films. For example, a very typical Western plot is that an eastern lawman heads west, where he matches wits and trades bullets with a gang of outlaws and thugs, and is aided by a local lawman who is well-meaning but largely ineffective until a critical moment when he redeems himself by saving the hero's life. This description can be used to describe any number of Westerns, but also other films such as ''[[Die Hard]]'' (itself a loose reworking of High Noon) and [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', which are frequently cited examples of films that do not take place in the American West but have many themes and characteristics common to Westerns. Likewise, films set in the [[American Old West]] may not necessarily be considered \"Westerns.\"\n\n===Influences===\nBeing period drama pieces, both the Western and [[Samurai cinema|samurai genre]] influenced each other in style and themes throughout the years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cowboys and Shoguns: The American Western, Japanese Jidaigeki, and Cross-Cultural Exchange |url=http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |website=Digitalcommons.uri.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929002901/http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |archivedate=2015-09-29 }}</ref> ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' was a remake of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Seven Samurai]]'', and ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' was a remake of Kurosawa's ''[[Yojimbo (movie)|Yojimbo]]'', which itself was inspired by ''[[Red Harvest]]'', an American detective novel by [[Dashiell Hammett]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=New DVDs: 'Films of Kenneth Anger' and 'Samurai Classics'|first=Dave|last=Kehr|date=January 23, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/movies/homevideo/23dvd.html?_r=0}}</ref> Kurosawa was influenced by American Westerns and was a fan of the genre, most especially [[John Ford]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Crogan |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |title=Translating Kurosawa |work=Senses of Cinema |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003194402/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |archivedate=2009-10-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |title=Star Wars Origins |publisher=Far Cry from the Original Site |first=Justine |last=Shaw |accessdate=December 20, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103145347/http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |archivedate=November 3, 2015 }} December 14, 2015</ref>\n\nDespite the [[Cold War]], the Western was a strong influence on Eastern Bloc cinema, which had its own take on the genre, the so-called \"[[Red Western]]\" or \"Ostern\". Generally these took two forms: either straight Westerns shot in the Eastern Bloc, or action films involving the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian civil war|civil war]] and the [[Basmachi]] rebellion.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nAn offshoot of the Western genre is the \"post-apocalyptic\" Western, in which a future society, struggling to rebuild after a major catastrophe, is portrayed in a manner very similar to the 19th-century frontier. Examples include ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' and the ''[[Mad Max]]'' [[Mad Max (franchise)|series]], and the computer game series ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]''. Many elements of space travel series and films borrow extensively from the conventions of the Western genre. This is particularly the case in the [[space Western]] subgenre of science fiction. [[Peter Hyams]]' ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' transferred the plot of ''[[High Noon]]'' to Io, moon of Jupiter. [[Gene Roddenberry]], the creator of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series, pitched his show as \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars\" early on, but admitted later that this was more about getting it produced in a time that loved Western-themed TV series than about its actual content.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} ''[[The Book of Eli]]'' depicts the post apocalypse as a Western with large knives.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nMore recently, the [[space opera]] series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' used an explicitly Western theme for its portrayal of frontier worlds. [[Anime]] shows like ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[Trigun]]'' and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' have been similar mixes of science fiction and Western elements. The [[science fiction Western]] can be seen as a subgenre of either Westerns or science fiction. Elements of Western films can be found also in some films belonging essentially to other genres. For example, ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'' is a war film, but action and characters are Western-like. The British film ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'' set during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] has sometimes been compared to a Western, even though it is set in [[South Africa]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:John Wayne in Wake of the Red Witch trailer.jpg|left|thumb|<center>[[John Wayne]] (1948)</center>]]\n\nThe character played by [[Humphrey Bogart]] in [[film noir|noir]] films such as ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''\u2014an individual bound only by his own private code of honor\u2014has a lot in common with the classic Western hero. In turn, the Western has also explored noir elements, as with the films ''[[Pursued]]'' and ''[[Sugar Creek (film)|Sugar Creek]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn many of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s books, the settlement of other planets is depicted in ways explicitly modeled on American settlement of the West. For example, in his ''[[Tunnel in the Sky]]'' settlers set out to the planet \"New Canaan\", via an [[interstellar teleporter]] portal across the galaxy, in [[Conestoga wagon]]s, their captain sporting mustaches and a little goatee and riding a [[Palomino]] horse\u2014with Heinlein explaining that the colonists would need to survive on their own for some years, so horses are more practical than machines.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' is a series of seven books that meshes themes of Westerns, [[high fantasy]], [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]]. The protagonist [[Roland of Gilead|Roland Deschain]] is a gunslinger whose image and personality are largely inspired by the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" from [[Sergio Leone]]'s films. In addition, the [[superhero]] [[fantasy]] genre has been described as having been derived from the cowboy hero, only powered up to omnipotence in a primarily urban setting. The Western genre has been parodied on a number of occasions, famous examples being ''[[Support Your Local Sheriff!]]'', ''[[Cat Ballou]]'', [[Mel Brooks]]'s ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', and ''[[Rustler's Rhapsody]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' films use many elements of a Western, and Lucas has said he intended for ''Star Wars'' to revitalize cinematic mythology, a part the Western once held. The [[Jedi]], who take their name from [[Jidaigeki]], are modeled after samurai, showing the influence of Kurosawa. The character [[Han Solo]] dressed like an archetypal gunslinger, and the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina is much like an Old West saloon.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/cover_story/2015/12/star_wars_is_a_pastiche_how_george_lucas_combined_flash_gordon_westerns.html|title=Star Wars Is a Postmodern Masterpiece|last=Wickman|first=Forrest|date=2015-12-13|work=Slate|access-date=2019-11-14|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, films such as ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', which plucked actor [[Sam Elliott]] out of the Old West and into a Los Angeles bowling alley, and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', about a Southern-boy-turned-gigolo in New York (who disappoints a client when he doesn't measure up to Gary Cooper), transplanted Western themes into modern settings for both purposes of parody and homage.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert |last=Silva |url=http://blogs.amctv.com/future-of-classic/2009/05/cowboys-in-non-westerns.php |publisher=Not From 'Round Here...

The first critically recognized Western was ''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]'' (1902) by [[Owen Wister]].{{cite web |url=https://wildwestliving.com/blogs/news/wild-west-literature |title=Classic Wild West Literature }} Other well-known writers of Western fiction include [[Zane Grey]], from the early 1900s, [[Ernest Haycox]], [[Luke Short]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], from the mid 20th century. Many writers better known in other genres, such as [[Leigh Brackett]], [[Elmore Leonard]], and [[Larry McMurtry]], have also written Western novels. The genre's popularity peaked in the 1960s, due in part to the shuttering of many pulp magazines, the popularity of [[Television Westerns|televised Westerns]], and the rise of the spy novel. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside of a few Western states, now only carry a small number of Western novels and short story collections.<ref>{{cite book|author=McVeigh, Stephen |title=The American Western|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|date= 2007}}</ref>\n\nLiterary forms that share similar themes include stories of the [[American frontier]], the [[gaucho literature]] of [[Argentina]], and tales of the settlement of the [[Australian Outback]].\n\n==Television==\n{{Main|Westerns on television|List of Westerns on television}}\n[[File:James Garner Jack Kelly Maverick 1959.JPG|right|thumb|[[James Garner]] and [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]] in ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957)]]\n[[Television Westerns]] are a subgenre of the Western. When television became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s, TV Westerns quickly became an audience favorite.<ref>Gary A. Yoggy, ''Riding the Video Range: The Rise and Fall of the Western on Television'' (McFarland & Company, 1995)</ref> Beginning with re-broadcasts of existing films, a number of movie cowboys had their own TV shows. As demand for the Western increased, new stories and stars were introduced. A number of long-running [[TV Western]]s became classics in their own right, such as: ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'' (1949-1957), ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'' (1955-1961), ''[[Cheyenne (TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' (1955-1962), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' (1955-1975),  ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957-1962), ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]'' (1957-1963), ''[[Wagon Train]]'' (1957-1965), ''[[Sugarfoot]]'' (1957-1961), ''[[The Rifleman]]'' (1958-1963), ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' (1959-1966), ''[[Bonanza]]'' (1959-1973),  ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' (1962-1971), and ''[[The Big Valley]]'' (1965-1969).

(editor) ''The Box: An Oral History of Television''</ref> Traditional Westerns died out in the late 1960s as a result of network changes in [[demographic targeting]] along with pressure from parental television groups. Future entries in the genre would incorporate elements from other genera, such as crime drama and mystery whodunit elements. Western shows from the 1970s included ''[[Hec Ramsey]]'', ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams]]'', and the short-lived but highly-acclaimed ''[[How the West Was Won (TV series)]]'' that originated from a miniseries with the same name. In the 1990s and 2000s, hour-long Westerns and slickly packaged made-for-TV movie Westerns were introduced, such as: ''[[Lonesome Dove (film)|Lonesome Dove]]'' (1989) and ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''. As well, new elements were once again added to the Western formula, such as the Western-[[science fiction]] show ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002. ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' was a critically acclaimed Western series which aired on [[HBO]] from 2004 through 2006. [[Hell on Wheels (TV series)|''Hell on Wheels'']], a fictionalized story of the construction of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] for five seasons between 2011 and 2016. ''[[Longmire (TV series)|Longmire]]'' was a Western series that centers on [[Walt Longmire]], a sheriff in fictional Absaroka County, [[Wyoming]]. Originally aired on the [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] network from 2012 to 2014 it was picked up by [[Netflix]] in 2015 until the show's conclusion in 2017. \n\n[[File:Wild West 1908.jpg|thumb|300px|\"As Wild felled one of the redskins by a blow from the butt of his revolver, and sprang for the one with the tomahawk, the chief's daughter suddenly appeared.

American West-oriented art is sometimes referred to as \"Western Art\" by Americans. This relatively new category of art includes paintings, sculptures, and sometimes Native American crafts. Initially, subjects included exploration of the Western states and cowboy themes. [[Frederic Remington]] and [[Charles M. Russell]] are two artists who captured the \"Wild West\" on canvas.<ref>{{cite news|author=Buscombe, Edward |title=Painting the Legend: Frederic Remington and the Western|work=Cinema Journal|date=1984|pages= 12\u201327}}</ref> Some art museums, such as the [[Buffalo Bill Center of the West]] in Wyoming and the [[Autry National Center]] in Los Angeles, feature American Western Art.<ref>{{cite book|author=Goetzmann, William H. |title=The West of the Imagination|location=New York|publisher= Norton|date= 1986}}</ref>\n\n==Other media==\nThe popularity of Westerns extends beyond films, literature, television, and visual art to include numerous other media forms.\n\n===Anime and manga===\nWith [[anime]] and [[manga]], the genre tends towards the [[Science fiction Western]] [e.g., ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' (1998 anime), ''[[Trigun]]'' (1995-2007 manga), and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' (1996-1999 manga)]. Although contemporary Westerns also appear, such as ''[[K\u014dya no Sh\u014dnen Isamu]]'', a 1971 [[sh\u014dnen]] manga about a boy with a Japanese father and a Native American mother, or ''[[El Cazador de la Bruja]]'', a 2007 anime television series set in modern-day Mexico. Part 7 of the manga series ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' is based in the American Western setting. The story follows racers in a transcontinental horse race, the \"Steel Ball Run\" race.\n\n===Comics===\n[[Western comics]] have included serious entries, (such as the classic comics of the late 1940s and early 1950s (namely ''[[Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'', ''[[Rawhide Kid]]'', and ''[[Red Ryder]]'') or more modern ones as [[Blueberry (comics)|Blueberry]]), cartoons, and parodies (such as ''[[Cocco Bill]]'' and ''[[Lucky Luke]]''). In the 1990s and 2000s, Western comics leaned toward the [[Weird West]] subgenre, usually involving supernatural monsters, or Christian iconography as in ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]''. However, more traditional Western comics are found throughout this period (e.g., ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' and ''[[Loveless (comics)|Loveless]]'').\n\n===Games===\nWestern [[arcade game]]s, [[computer game]]s, [[role-playing game]]s, and [[video games]] are often either straightforward Westerns or Western Horror hybrids.  Some Western themed-computer games include ''[[The Oregon Trail (1971 video game)|The Oregon Trail]]'' (1971), ''[[Mad Dog McCree]]'' (1990), ''[[Sunset Riders]]'' (1991), ''[[Outlaws (1997 video game)|Outlaws]]'' (1997), ''[[Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive|Desperados]]'' series (2001\u2013), ''[[Red Dead Revolver]]'' (2004), ''[[Gun (video game)|Gun]]'' (2005), ''[[Call of Juarez]]'' (2007), ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018). Other video games adapt the [[Science fiction Western]] or [[Weird West]] subgenres such as ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' (1997), ''[[Gunman Chronicles]]'' (2000), ''[[Darkwatch]]'' (2005), the [[Borderlands (series)|''Borderlands'' series]] (2009\u2013)'', [[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010), and ''[[Hard West]]'' (2015).\n\n===Radio dramas===\nWestern [[radio drama]]s were very popular from the 1930s to the 1960s.  Some popular shows include ''[[Lone Ranger#Original radio series|The Lone Ranger]]'' (first broadcast in 1933), ''[[The Cisco Kid#Radio|The Cisco Kid]]'' (first broadcast in 1942), ''[[Dr. Sixgun]]'' (first broadcast in 1954), ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel#Radio show|Have Gun\u2013Will Travel]]'' (first broadcast in 1958), and ''[[Gunsmoke#Radio series|Gunsmoke]]'' (first broadcast in 1952).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otrwesterns.com |website=otrwesterns.com |title=Old Time Radio Westerns |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319172946/http://www.otrwesterns.com/ |archivedate=2011-03-19 }}</ref>\n\n===Web series===\nWesterns have been showcased in short episodic web series.

Western films first became well-attended in the 1930s. [[John Ford]]'s landmark Western film ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) became one of the biggest hits of that year, and made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream movie star. The popularity of Westerns continued to grow in the 1940s, with the release of films such as ''[[The Ox-Bow Incident]]'' (1943), ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946), ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' (1948), and ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' (1948). The 1950s have been described as the \"Golden Age of the Western,\" and saw the release of films such as ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' (1950), ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953), ''[[Wichita (1955 film)|Wichita]]'' (1955),  ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), and ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959). Notable Western films released in the 1960s include ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), and ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William.

Fear of the mysterious.\"]]\nThe Western genre sometimes portrays the conquest of the wilderness and the subordination of nature in the name of civilization or the confiscation of the territorial rights of the original, Native American, inhabitants of the frontier.<ref name=\"kimnewman\">{{cite book| last=Newman | first=Kim | title=Wild West Movies | publisher=Bloomsbury | year=1990}}</ref>  The Western depicts a society organized around codes of [[honor]] and personal, direct or private justice\u2013\"frontier justice\"\u2013dispensed by gunfights. These honor codes are often played out through depictions of feuds or individuals seeking personal [[revenge]] or [[wikt:retribution|retribution]] against someone who has wronged them (e.g., ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' has revenge and retribution as its main themes). This Western depiction of personal justice contrasts sharply with justice systems organized around rationalistic, abstract law that exist in cities, in which [[social order]] is maintained predominately through relatively impersonal institutions such as [[courtroom]]s. The popular perception of the Western is a story that centers on the life of a semi-nomadic wanderer, usually a [[cowboy]] or a [[gunfighter]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/>  A showdown or [[Duel#Colonial North America and United States|duel]] at high noon featuring two or more gunfighters is a stereotypical scene in the popular conception of Westerns.\n\nIn some ways, such protagonists may be considered the literary descendants of the [[Knight-errant|knights errant]] which stood at the center of earlier extensive genres such as the [[King Arthur|Arthurian Romances]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/> Like the cowboy or gunfighter of the Western, the knight errant of the earlier European tales and poetry was wandering from place to place on his horse, fighting villains of various kinds and bound to no fixed social structures, but only to their own innate code of honor. And like knights errant, the heroes of Westerns frequently rescue [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]]. Similarly, the wandering protagonists of Westerns share many characteristics with the [[ronin]] in modern Japanese culture.\n\nThe Western typically takes these elements and uses them to tell simple morality tales, although some notable examples (e.g. the later Westerns of [[John Ford]] or [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[Unforgiven]]'', about an old hired killer) are more morally ambiguous. Westerns often stress the harshness and isolation of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape. Western films generally have specific settings such as isolated ranches, Native American villages, or small frontier towns with a saloon. Oftentimes, these settings appear deserted and without much structure. Apart from the wilderness, it is usually the saloon that emphasizes that this is the [[Wild West]]: it is the place to go for music (raucous piano playing), women (often [[prostitute]]s), gambling (draw poker or five card stud), drinking (beer or whiskey), brawling and shooting. In some Westerns, where civilization has arrived, the town has a church, a general store, a bank and a school; in others, where frontier rules still hold sway, it is, as [[Sergio Leone]] said, \"where life has no value\".\n\n==Film==\n\n===Characteristics===\n[[File:Gary Cooper 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gary Cooper]] in ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'']]\nThe [[American Film Institute]] defines Western films as those \"set in the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle and the demise of the [[Frontier Thesis|new frontier]].\"<ref>{{cite web| title=America's 10 Greatest Films in 10 Classic Genres| url= http://www.afi.com/10top10/ | publisher=[[American Film Institute]] | accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>  The term ''Western'', used to describe a narrative film genre, appears to have originated with a July 1912 article in ''Motion Picture World'' magazine.<ref>McMahan, Alison; ''Alice Guy Blache: Lost Visionary of the Cinema''; New York: Continuum, 2002; 133</ref> Most of the characteristics of Western films were part of 19th-century popular [[Western fiction]] and were firmly in place before film became a popular art form.<ref>Henry Nash Smith, ''Virgin Land: The American West as Symbol and Myth'', Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1950.</ref>  Western films commonly feature protagonists such as cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, who are often depicted as semi-nomadic wanderers who wear [[Stetson]] hats, [[Kerchief|bandanna]]s, spurs, and [[buckskins]], use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survival\u2013and as a means to settle disputes using \"frontier justice\". Protagonists ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nWestern films were enormously popular in the [[silent film]] era (1894-1927). With the advent of sound in 1927-28, the major Hollywood studios rapidly abandoned Westerns,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/magazine/11schatz.html, ''New York Times Magazine''] (November 10, 2007).</ref> leaving the genre to smaller studios and producers. These smaller organizations churned out countless low-budget features and serials in the 1930s. By the late 1930s, the Western film was widely regarded as a \"pulp\" genre in Hollywood, but its popularity was dramatically revived in 1939 by major studio productions such as ''[[Dodge City (film)|Dodge City]]'' starring [[Errol Flynn]], ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' with [[Tyrone Power]], ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' with [[Joel McCrea]], ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' featuring [[James Stewart]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and the release of John Ford's landmark Western adventure ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', which became one of the biggest hits of the year. Released through United Artists, ''Stagecoach'' made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream screen star in the wake of a decade of headlining [[B Westerns]]. Wayne had been introduced to the screen ten years earlier as the [[leading man]] in director [[Raoul Walsh]]'s [[widescreen]] ''[[The Big Trail]]'', which failed at the box office, due in part to exhibitors' inability to switch over to widescreen during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. After the Western's renewed commercial successes in the late 1930s, the popularity of the Western continued to rise until its peak in the 1950s, when the number of Western films produced outnumbered all other genres combined.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William.

While early Eurocentric Westerns frequently portray the \"Injuns\" as dishonorable villains, the later and more culturally neutral Westerns gave Native Americans a more sympathetic treatment.  Other recurring themes of Westerns include Western treks (e.g. ''The Big Trail'') or perilous journeys (e.g. ''Stagecoach'') or groups of bandits terrorising small towns such as in ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''.\n\nEarly Westerns were mostly filmed in the studio, as in other early Hollywood films, but when location shooting became more common from the 1930s, producers of Westerns used desolate corners of [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], or [[Wyoming]]. These settings gave filmmakers the ability to depict vast plains, looming mountains and epic canyons. Productions were also filmed on location at [[movie ranches]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nOften, the vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop; it becomes a character in the film. After the early 1950s, various wide screen formats such as [[Cinemascope]] (1953) and [[VistaVision]] used the expanded width of the screen to display spectacular Western landscapes. [[John Ford]]'s use of [[Monument Valley]] as an expressive landscape in his films from ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) to ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1965) \"present us with a mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West, embodied most memorably in Monument Valley, with its buttes and mesas that tower above the men on horseback, whether they be settlers, soldiers, or Native Americans\".<ref name=\"Cowie 2004\"/>\n\n===Subgenres===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Dan Duryea in Along Came Jones trailer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dan Duryea]] in ''[[Along Came Jones (film)|Along Came Jones]]'' (1945)]]\nAuthor and screenwriter [[Frank Gruber]] described seven plots for Westerns:<ref>Gruber, Frank  ''The Pulp Jungle'' Sherbourne Press, 1967</ref><ref name=\"cgw199010\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |title=No Soft Soap About New And Improved Computer Games |work=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1990 |accessdate=16 November 2013 |page=80 |type=editorial |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233126/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |archivedate=2 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\n# ''Union Pacific story''.

So you see scenes that are like gunfighters squaring off, like [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Lee Van Cleef]]\u2014we have [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] and others like that.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.local-iq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3019&Itemid=56 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403091323/http://www.local-iq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3019&Itemid=56 |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 April 2013 |title=Contemporary Western: An interview with Vince Gilligan |date=27 March 2013 |publisher=[[Local iQ]] |work=News |accessdate=31 May 2013 |place=United States }}</ref>\n\nThe precursor to these{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} was the radio series ''[[Tales of the Texas Rangers]]'' (1950\u20131952), with [[Joel McCrea]], a contemporary detective drama set in Texas, featuring many of the characteristics of traditional Westerns.\n\n====Electric Western====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Zachariah.jpg|right|thumbnail|''[[Zachariah (film)|Zachariah]]'' (1971)]] -->\nThe 1971 film ''[[Zachariah (film)|Zachariah]]'' starring [[John Rubinstein]], [[Don Johnson]] and [[Pat Quinn (actress)|Pat Quinn]] was billed as the \"first electric Western.\"<ref name=NYT/> The film featured multiple performing [[musical ensemble|rock bands]] in an otherwise [[American frontier|American West]] setting.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D05E3DE163BE53BBC4D51DFB766838A669EDE|title=Zachariah (1970) Screen: 'Zachariah,' an Odd Western|authorlink=Roger Greenspun|author=Greenspun, Roger|date=January 25, 1971}}</ref>\n\n''Zachariah'' featured appearances and music supplied by rock groups from the 1970s, including the [[James Gang]]<ref name=NYT/> and [[Country Joe and the Fish]] as \"The Cracker Band.\"<ref name=NYT/> Fiddler [[Doug Kershaw]] had a musical cameo<ref name=NYT/> as does [[Elvin Jones]] as a gunslinging drummer named Job Cain.<ref name=NYT/>\n\nThe [[independent film]] ''Hate Horses'' starring [[Dominique Swain]], [[Ron Thompson (actor)|Ron Thompson]] and [[Paul Dooley]] billed itself as the \"second electric Western.\"<ref>{{cite video|work=[[YouTube]]|date=2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgTXHXiP7lk|title=Hate Horses - Official Trailer}}</ref>\n\n====Epic Western====\nThe epic Western is a subgenre of the Western that emphasizes the story of the American Old West on a grand scale. Many epic Westerns are commonly set during a turbulent time, especially a war, as in Sergio Leone's ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), set during the American Civil War, or Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), set during the Mexican Revolution. One of the grandest films in this genre is Leone's ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), which shows many operatic conflicts centered on control of a town while utilizing wide scale shots on Monument Valley locations against a broad running time. Other notable examples include ''[[The Iron Horse (film)|The Iron Horse]]'' (1924), ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946), ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), ''[[Cimarron (1960 film)|Cimarron]]'' (1960), [[How the West Was Won (film)|''How the West Was Won'']] (1962), ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'' (1971), ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990), ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' (2007), ''[[Django Unchained]]'' (2012) and  ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'' (2015).\n\n====Euro-Western====\nEuro-Westerns are Western genre films made in [[Western Europe]]. The term can sometimes, but not necessarily, include the [[Spaghetti Western]] subgenre (see below). One example of a Euro Western is the Anglo-Spanish film ''[[Savage Guns (1961 film)|The Savage Guns]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]). Several Euro-Western films, nicknamed Sauerkraut Westerns<ref>{{cite book|page= 118 |authors=Brookeman, Christopher & British Film Institute |title=The BFI Companion to the Western|publisher= A. Deutsch|date= 1993}}</ref> because they were made in [[Germany]] and shot in [[Yugoslavia]], were derived from stories by novelist [[Karl May]] and were [[Karl May film adaptations|film adaptations of May's work]]. Some new Euro-Westerns emerged in the 2010s, including [[Kristian Levring]]'s [[The Salvation (film)|''The Salvation'']], [[Martin Koolhoven]]'s [[Brimstone (2016 film)|''Brimstone'']], and [[Andreas Prochaska]]'s ''[[The Dark Valley]]''.\n\n====Fantasy Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nFantasy Westerns mixed in [[fantasy]] settings and themes, and may include fantasy mythology as background. Some famous examples are [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Stand]]'' and [[The Dark Tower series|''The Dark Tower'' series]] of novels, the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] comics series ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'', and [[Keiichi Sigsawa]]'s light novel series, ''[[Kino's Journey]]'', illustrated by [[Kouhaku Kuroboshi]].\n\n====Florida Western====\n[[Florida Western]]s, also known as Cracker Westerns, are set in [[Florida]] during the [[Second Seminole War]]. An example is ''[[Distant Drums]]'' (1951) starring [[Gary Cooper]].\n\n====Greek Western====\nAccording to the naming conventions after [[Spaghetti Western]], in Greece is also referred to as \"fasolada Western\" (Greek: \u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 = bean soup, i.e. the so called national dish of Greece).

Another example is ''The Ghoul Goes West'', an unproduced [[Ed Wood]] film to star [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Dracula]] in the Old West.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Recent examples include the films ''[[Near Dark]]'' (1987) directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]] which tells the story about a human falling in love with a [[vampire]], ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'' (1996) by [[Robert Rodriguez]] deals with outlaws battling vampires across the border, ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998) by [[John Carpenter]] tells about a group of vampires and vampire hunters looking for an ancient relic in the west, ''[[Ravenous (1999 film)|Ravenous]]'' (1999), which deals with cannibalism at a remote US army outpost; ''[[The Burrowers]]'' (2008), about a band of trackers who are stalked by the titular creatures; and ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'' (2012). ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'' (2010), an expansion to ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game in this genre, telling the tale of a [[zombie]] outbreak in the [[Old West]]. ''[[Bone Tomahawk]]'' (2016) one of the most recent entries in the genre received wide critical acclaim for its chilling tale of cannibalism but, like many other movies in the genre, it wasn't a commercial success.\n\n==== Indo Western ====\nThe first Western films made in India \u2013 ''Mosagaalaku Mosagaadu'' (1970), made in Telugu, ''Mappusakshi'' (Malayalam),{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''[[Ganga (1972 film)|Ganga]]'' (1972), and ''Jakkamma'' (Tamil){{citation needed|date=April 2015}} - were based on Classic Westerns. ''[[Thazhvaram]]'' (1990), the Malayalam film directed by [[Bharathan]] and written by noted writer [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], perhaps most resembles the Spaghetti Westerns in terms of production and cinematic techniques. Earlier Spaghetti Westerns laid the groundwork for such films as ''[[Adima Changala]]'' (1971) starring [[Prem Nazir]], a hugely popular \"zapata Spaghetti Western film in Malayalam, and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) ''[[Khote Sikkay]]'' (1973)  and ''[[Thai Meethu Sathiyam]]'' (1978) are notable Curry Westerns. ''[[Kodama Simham]]'' (1990), a Telugu action film starring [[Chiranjeevi]] and [[Mohan Babu]] was one more addition to the Indo Western genre and fared well at the box office. It was also the first South Indian movie to be dubbed in English as ''Hunters of the Indian Treasure''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |title=Hunters of the Indian Treasure |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205013433/https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |archivedate=2017-02-05 }}</ref>\n\n''[[Takkari Donga]]'' (2002), starring Telugu Maheshbabu, was applauded by critics but an average runner at box office. ''[[Quick Gun Murugun]]'' (2009), an Indian comedy film which spoofs Indian Western movies, is based on a character created for television promos at the time of the launch of the music network Channel [V] in 1994, which had cult following.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/society-the-arts/story/19941015-channel-v-film-funny-irreverent-and-slightly-crazy-809809-1999-11-30|title=Quick Gun Murugan: Channel V comes up with funny, irreverent and slightly crazy film|last=November 30|first=AMIT AGARWAL|last2=October 15|first2=1999 ISSUE DATE|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15|last3=July 24|first3=1994UPDATED|last4=Ist|first4=2013 12:00|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403110409/https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/society-the-arts/story/19941015-channel-v-film-funny-irreverent-and-slightly-crazy-809809-1999-11-30|archive-date=2019-04-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''[[Irumbukkottai Murattu Singam]]'' (2010), a Western adventure comedy film, based on cowboy movies and paying homages to the [[John Wayne]], [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Jaishankar]], was made in Tamil. [[Laal Kaptaan]] (2019) is an Indo western starring [[Saif Ali Khan]] which is set during of rise of [[British Empire]] in India.\n\n====Martial arts Western (Wuxia Western)====\nWhile many of these mash-ups (e.g., ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971) and its sequel ''[[The Trial of Billy Jack]]'' (1974)) are cheap exploitation films, others are more serious dramas such as the ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' TV series, which ran from 1972 to 1975. Comedy examples include the [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Owen Wilson]] collaboration ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'' (2000). Further sub-divisions of this subgenre include ''[[Ninja]] Westerns'' and ''[[Samurai]] Westerns'' (incorporating [[samurai cinema]] themes), such as ''[[Red Sun]]'' (1971) with [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Toshiro Mifune]].\n\n====Meat pie Western====\n{{main|Meat pie Western}} \nThe Meat pie Western (a slang term which plays on the Italo-western moniker \"[[Spaghetti Western]]\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51588737 |title=Hollywood|work=The Australian Women's Weekly|date= November 4, 1981|page= 157|first=John-Michael|last=Howson|accessdate= December 28, 2011}}</ref>) is a Western-style movie or TV series set in Australia, especially the [[Australian Outback]] or the [[The bush#Australia|Australian Bush]].<ref name=AusF>{{cite book|last=Ross Cooper|first=Andrew Pike|title=Australian Film 1900-1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-0195507843|page=310}}</ref> Films such as ''[[Rangle River]]'' (1936), ''[[The Kangaroo Kid (1950 film)|The Kangaroo Kid]]'' (1950),''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'' (1960), ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' (1970), ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]'' (1982)  and ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005) are all representative of the genre.<ref name=DT2018>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/australian-meat-pie-westerns-have-been-around-for-more-than-a-century/news-story/220b01591983bdbc46fef9cacd5fa925?nk=d2a04456400b3ffd92de3375f1b5fc9e-1558436137|publisher=Daily Telegraph|work=Daily Telegraph|date=21January 2018|title=Australian 'meat pie' westerns have been around for more than a century|first=Troy|last=Lennon|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Northwestern====\nThe [[Northern (genre)|Northern genre]] is a subgenre of Westerns taking place in [[Alaska]] or [[Western Canada]]. Examples include several versions of the [[Rex Beach]] novel, ''[[The Spoilers (Beach novel)|The Spoilers]]'' (including 1930's ''[[The Spoilers (1930 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Gary Cooper, and 1942's ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Marlene Dietrich, [[Randolph Scott]] and Wayne); ''[[The Far Country]]'' (1954) with James Stewart; ''[[North to Alaska]]'' (1960) with Wayne;  ''[[Death Hunt]]'' (1981) with [[Charles Bronson]]; and ''[[The Grey Fox]]'' (1983) with [[Richard Farnsworth]].\n\n====Ostern====\n{{main|Ostern}}\n[[Ostern]]s, also known as \"Red Western\"s, are produced in [[Eastern Europe]]. They were popular in Communist Eastern European countries and were a particular favorite of [[Joseph Stalin]],<nowiki>   and usually portrayed the </nowiki>[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] sympathetically, as oppressed people fighting for their rights, in contrast to American Westerns of the time, which frequently portrayed the Indians as villains. Osterns frequently featured [[Romani people|Gypsies]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people in the role of the Indians, due to the shortage of authentic Indians in Eastern Europe.\n\n[[Gojko Miti\u0107]] portrayed righteous, kind-hearted, and charming Indian [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] (e.g., in ''[[The Sons of the Great Mother Bear|Die S\u00f6hne der gro\u00dfen B\u00e4rin]]'' (1966) directed by [[Josef Mach]]). He became honorary chief of the [[Sioux]] tribe, when he visited the United States in the 1990s and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe one of his films. American actor and singer [[Dean Reed]], an expatriate who lived in [[East Germany]], also starred in several Ostern films.\n\n====Pornographic Western====\nThe most rare of the Western subgenres, pornographic Westerns use the Old West as a background for stories primarily focused on erotica. The three major examples of the porn Western film are [[Russ Meyer]]'s [[nudie-cutie]] ''[[Wild Gals of the Naked West]]'' (1962), and the hardcore ''[[A Dirty Western]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sweet Savage (1979 film)|Sweet Savage]]'' (1979). ''Sweet Savage'' starred [[Aldo Ray]], a veteran actor who had appeared in traditional Westerns, in a non-sex role. Among videogames, ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'' (1982) is an infamous example, considered to be one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games of all time]].\n\n====Ramen Western====\nFirst used in the publicity of the film [[Tampopo]]. the term 'Ramen Western' is play on words using a national dish as a prefix like [[Spaghetti Western]] or Meat Pie Western. The term is used to describe Western style films set in Asia. Examples include ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Weird]]'' and ''[[Sukiyaki Western Django]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ramen Western|url=http://www.criminalelement.com/ramen-westerns-far-east-meets-old-west/|website=criminalelement.com|date=2011-08-16}}</ref>\n\n====Revisionist Western====\nAfter the early 1960s, many American filmmakers began to question and change many traditional elements of Westerns, and to make [[Revisionist Western]]s that encouraged audiences to question the simple hero-versus-villain dualism and the morality of using violence to test one's character or to prove oneself right. This is shown in Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). One major revision was the increasingly positive representation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who had been treated as \"savages\" in earlier films. Examples of such revisionist Westerns include ''[[Ride the High Country]]'' (1962), [[Richard Harris]]' ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' (1970), ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Soldier Blue]] (1970),'' ''[[Man in the Wilderness]]'' (1971), ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990) and ''[[Dead Man]]'' (1995). A few earlier Revisionist Westerns gave women more powerful roles, such as ''[[Westward the Women]]'' (1951) starring [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]].  Another earlier work encompassed all these features, ''[[The Last Wagon (1956 film)|The Last Wagon]]'' (1956). In it, [[Richard Widmark]] played a white man raised by [[Comanche]]s and persecuted by [[white people|whites]], with [[Felicia Farr]] and [[Susan Kohner]] playing young women forced into leadership roles.\n\n====Science fiction Western====\nThe [[science fiction Western]] places [[science fiction]] elements within a traditional Western setting. Examples include ''[[Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter]]'' (1965), ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'' (1969) featuring cowboys and dinosaurs. [[John Jakes]]'s \"Six Gun Planet\" takes place on a future planet colonized by people consciously seeking to recreate the Old West (with cowboys riding robot horses...) [https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Wheels_Six_Gun_Planet.html?id=Q6OGZprSGtcC&redir_esc=y]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The movie ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' (1973) and its sequel ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Wild Wild West]]'' (1999), ''[[Cowboys & Aliens]]'' (2011), and the TV series [[Westworld (TV series)|''Westworld'']] (2016, based on the movie). ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game that follows this format, with futuristic technology and genetic mutations placed among the Western themes and desert sprawl of the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave Wasteland]].\n\n====Space Western====\nThe [[Space Western|Space Western or Space Frontier]] is a subgenre of [[science fiction]] which uses the themes and [[trope (literature)|trope]]s of Westerns within science fiction stories. Subtle influences may include exploration of lawless frontiers in [[Deep space exploration|deep space]], while more overt influences may feature literal [[Space Cowboy (disambiguation)|cowboys in outer space]] who use [[ray gun]]s and ride robotic horses. Examples include the American television series ''[[BraveStarr]]'' (which aired original episodes from September 1987 to February 1988) and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' (created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002), and the films ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980), which is a remake of ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''; ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' (1981), which is a remake of ''[[High Noon]]''; and ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'' (2005, based on the ''Firefly'' TV series). Another example is the Japanese anime series ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]''. The classic Western genre has also been a major influence on science fiction films such as the original ''[[Star Wars: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' movie of 1977, with 2018's ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' and 2019's ''[[Star Wars: The Mandalorian]]'' more directly featuring Western tropes. Famously [[Gene Roddenberry]] pitched the concept of the TV show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' as a \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars.\"\n\n====Spaghetti Western====\n{{main|Spaghetti Western|Zapata Western}}\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, a revival of the Western emerged in [[Italy]] with the \"[[Spaghetti Westerns]]\" also known as \"Italo-Westerns\". The most famous of them is ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), the third film of the [[Dollars Trilogy]].  Many of these films are low-budget affairs, shot in locations (for example, the Spanish desert [[Province of Almer\u00eda|region of Almer\u00eda]]) chosen for their inexpensive crew and production costs as well as their similarity to landscapes of the [[Southwestern United States]]. Spaghetti Westerns were characterized by the presence of more action and violence than the Hollywood Westerns. Also, the protagonists usually acted out of more selfish motives (money or revenge being the most common) than in the classical Westerns.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frayling, Christopher |title=Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone|publisher=IB Tauris|date= 1998}}</ref> Some Spaghetti Westerns demythologized the American Western tradition, and some films from the genre are considered [[revisionist Western]]s.\n[[File:Clint Eastwood - 1960s.JPG|thumb|[[Clint Eastwood]] as the ambiguously-named protagonist of the [[Dollars Trilogy]] (marketed as \"the [[Man with No Name]]\") in a publicity image of ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', a film by [[Sergio Leone]].]]\n\nThe Western films directed by [[Sergio Leone]] were felt by some to have a different tone than the Hollywood Westerns.<ref name=TG/> Veteran American actors [[Charles Bronson]], [[Lee Van Cleef]] and [[Clint Eastwood]]<ref name=TG/> became famous by starring in Spaghetti Westerns, although the films also provided a showcase for other noted actors such as [[James Coburn]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Klaus Kinski]], and [[Jason Robards]].

It is a more rare Western, as most focus during warm weather or areas where it doesn't snow. Popular films of this subgenre are [[Sergio Corbucci|Sergio Corbucci's]] ''[[ The Great Silence ]]'' (1968) and [[Quentin Tarantino|Quentin Tarantino's]] ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' (2015).\n\n====Weird Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nThe [[Weird Western]] subgenre blends elements of a classic Western with other elements. ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' television series, television movies, and 1999 film adaptation blend the Western with [[steampunk]]. The ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' franchise also blends the Western with superhero elements. The film ''[[Western Religion (film)|Western Religion]]'' (2015), by writer and director [[James O'Brien (filmmaker)|James O'Brien]], introduces the devil into a traditional wild west setting. The ''[[Old Man Logan]]'' (2008-2009) graphic novel combines the elements of superhero and post-apocalyptic fiction with Western.\n\n===Genre studies===\n[[File:Tommixgunslinger.jpg|[[Tom Mix]] in ''Mr. Logan, U.S.A.'', c. 1919|thumb]]\n\nIn the 1960s academic and critical attention to cinema as a legitimate art form emerged. With the increased attention, [[film theory]] was developed to attempt to understand the significance of film. From this environment emerged (in conjunction with the literary movement) an enclave of critical studies called [[genre studies]]. This was primarily a semantic and structuralist approach to understanding how similar films convey meaning.\n\nOne of the results of genre studies is that some{{who|date=April 2013}} have argued that \"Westerns\" need not take place in the American West or even in the 19th century, as the codes can be found in other types of films. For example, a very typical Western plot is that an eastern lawman heads west, where he matches wits and trades bullets with a gang of outlaws and thugs, and is aided by a local lawman who is well-meaning but largely ineffective until a critical moment when he redeems himself by saving the hero's life. This description can be used to describe any number of Westerns, but also other films such as ''[[Die Hard]]'' (itself a loose reworking of High Noon) and [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', which are frequently cited examples of films that do not take place in the American West but have many themes and characteristics common to Westerns. Likewise, films set in the [[American Old West]] may not necessarily be considered \"Westerns.\"\n\n===Influences===\nBeing period drama pieces, both the Western and [[Samurai cinema|samurai genre]] influenced each other in style and themes throughout the years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cowboys and Shoguns: The American Western, Japanese Jidaigeki, and Cross-Cultural Exchange |url=http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |website=Digitalcommons.uri.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929002901/http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |archivedate=2015-09-29 }}</ref> ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' was a remake of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Seven Samurai]]'', and ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' was a remake of Kurosawa's ''[[Yojimbo (movie)|Yojimbo]]'', which itself was inspired by ''[[Red Harvest]]'', an American detective novel by [[Dashiell Hammett]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=New DVDs: 'Films of Kenneth Anger' and 'Samurai Classics'|first=Dave|last=Kehr|date=January 23, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/movies/homevideo/23dvd.html?_r=0}}</ref> Kurosawa was influenced by American Westerns and was a fan of the genre, most especially [[John Ford]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Crogan |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |title=Translating Kurosawa |work=Senses of Cinema |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003194402/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |archivedate=2009-10-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |title=Star Wars Origins |publisher=Far Cry from the Original Site |first=Justine |last=Shaw |accessdate=December 20, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103145347/http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |archivedate=November 3, 2015 }} December 14, 2015</ref>\n\nDespite the [[Cold War]], the Western was a strong influence on Eastern Bloc cinema, which had its own take on the genre, the so-called \"[[Red Western]]\" or \"Ostern\". Generally these took two forms: either straight Westerns shot in the Eastern Bloc, or action films involving the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian civil war|civil war]] and the [[Basmachi]] rebellion.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nAn offshoot of the Western genre is the \"post-apocalyptic\" Western, in which a future society, struggling to rebuild after a major catastrophe, is portrayed in a manner very similar to the 19th-century frontier. Examples include ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' and the ''[[Mad Max]]'' [[Mad Max (franchise)|series]], and the computer game series ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]''. Many elements of space travel series and films borrow extensively from the conventions of the Western genre. This is particularly the case in the [[space Western]] subgenre of science fiction. [[Peter Hyams]]' ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' transferred the plot of ''[[High Noon]]'' to Io, moon of Jupiter. [[Gene Roddenberry]], the creator of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series, pitched his show as \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars\" early on, but admitted later that this was more about getting it produced in a time that loved Western-themed TV series than about its actual content.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} ''[[The Book of Eli]]'' depicts the post apocalypse as a Western with large knives.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nMore recently, the [[space opera]] series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' used an explicitly Western theme for its portrayal of frontier worlds. [[Anime]] shows like ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[Trigun]]'' and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' have been similar mixes of science fiction and Western elements. The [[science fiction Western]] can be seen as a subgenre of either Westerns or science fiction. Elements of Western films can be found also in some films belonging essentially to other genres. For example, ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'' is a war film, but action and characters are Western-like. The British film ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'' set during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] has sometimes been compared to a Western, even though it is set in [[South Africa]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:John Wayne in Wake of the Red Witch trailer.jpg|left|thumb|<center>[[John Wayne]] (1948)</center>]]\n\nThe character played by [[Humphrey Bogart]] in [[film noir|noir]] films such as ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''\u2014an individual bound only by his own private code of honor\u2014has a lot in common with the classic Western hero. In turn, the Western has also explored noir elements, as with the films ''[[Pursued]]'' and ''[[Sugar Creek (film)|Sugar Creek]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn many of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s books, the settlement of other planets is depicted in ways explicitly modeled on American settlement of the West. For example, in his ''[[Tunnel in the Sky]]'' settlers set out to the planet \"New Canaan\", via an [[interstellar teleporter]] portal across the galaxy, in [[Conestoga wagon]]s, their captain sporting mustaches and a little goatee and riding a [[Palomino]] horse\u2014with Heinlein explaining that the colonists would need to survive on their own for some years, so horses are more practical than machines.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' is a series of seven books that meshes themes of Westerns, [[high fantasy]], [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]]. The protagonist [[Roland of Gilead|Roland Deschain]] is a gunslinger whose image and personality are largely inspired by the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" from [[Sergio Leone]]'s films. In addition, the [[superhero]] [[fantasy]] genre has been described as having been derived from the cowboy hero, only powered up to omnipotence in a primarily urban setting. The Western genre has been parodied on a number of occasions, famous examples being ''[[Support Your Local Sheriff!]]'', ''[[Cat Ballou]]'', [[Mel Brooks]]'s ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', and ''[[Rustler's Rhapsody]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' films use many elements of a Western, and Lucas has said he intended for ''Star Wars'' to revitalize cinematic mythology, a part the Western once held. The [[Jedi]], who take their name from [[Jidaigeki]], are modeled after samurai, showing the influence of Kurosawa. The character [[Han Solo]] dressed like an archetypal gunslinger, and the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina is much like an Old West saloon.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/cover_story/2015/12/star_wars_is_a_pastiche_how_george_lucas_combined_flash_gordon_westerns.html|title=Star Wars Is a Postmodern Masterpiece|last=Wickman|first=Forrest|date=2015-12-13|work=Slate|access-date=2019-11-14|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, films such as ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', which plucked actor [[Sam Elliott]] out of the Old West and into a Los Angeles bowling alley, and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', about a Southern-boy-turned-gigolo in New York (who disappoints a client when he doesn't measure up to Gary Cooper), transplanted Western themes into modern settings for both purposes of parody and homage.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert |last=Silva |url=http://blogs.amctv.com/future-of-classic/2009/05/cowboys-in-non-westerns.php |publisher=Not From 'Round Here...

The first critically recognized Western was ''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]'' (1902) by [[Owen Wister]].{{cite web |url=https://wildwestliving.com/blogs/news/wild-west-literature |title=Classic Wild West Literature }} Other well-known writers of Western fiction include [[Zane Grey]], from the early 1900s, [[Ernest Haycox]], [[Luke Short]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], from the mid 20th century. Many writers better known in other genres, such as [[Leigh Brackett]], [[Elmore Leonard]], and [[Larry McMurtry]], have also written Western novels. The genre's popularity peaked in the 1960s, due in part to the shuttering of many pulp magazines, the popularity of [[Television Westerns|televised Westerns]], and the rise of the spy novel. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside of a few Western states, now only carry a small number of Western novels and short story collections.<ref>{{cite book|author=McVeigh, Stephen |title=The American Western|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|date= 2007}}</ref>\n\nLiterary forms that share similar themes include stories of the [[American frontier]], the [[gaucho literature]] of [[Argentina]], and tales of the settlement of the [[Australian Outback]].\n\n==Television==\n{{Main|Westerns on television|List of Westerns on television}}\n[[File:James Garner Jack Kelly Maverick 1959.JPG|right|thumb|[[James Garner]] and [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]] in ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957)]]\n[[Television Westerns]] are a subgenre of the Western. When television became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s, TV Westerns quickly became an audience favorite.<ref>Gary A. Yoggy, ''Riding the Video Range: The Rise and Fall of the Western on Television'' (McFarland & Company, 1995)</ref> Beginning with re-broadcasts of existing films, a number of movie cowboys had their own TV shows. As demand for the Western increased, new stories and stars were introduced. A number of long-running [[TV Western]]s became classics in their own right, such as: ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'' (1949-1957), ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'' (1955-1961), ''[[Cheyenne (TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' (1955-1962), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' (1955-1975),  ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957-1962), ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]'' (1957-1963), ''[[Wagon Train]]'' (1957-1965), ''[[Sugarfoot]]'' (1957-1961), ''[[The Rifleman]]'' (1958-1963), ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' (1959-1966), ''[[Bonanza]]'' (1959-1973),  ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' (1962-1971), and ''[[The Big Valley]]'' (1965-1969).

(editor) ''The Box: An Oral History of Television''</ref> Traditional Westerns died out in the late 1960s as a result of network changes in [[demographic targeting]] along with pressure from parental television groups. Future entries in the genre would incorporate elements from other genera, such as crime drama and mystery whodunit elements. Western shows from the 1970s included ''[[Hec Ramsey]]'', ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams]]'', and the short-lived but highly-acclaimed ''[[How the West Was Won (TV series)]]'' that originated from a miniseries with the same name. In the 1990s and 2000s, hour-long Westerns and slickly packaged made-for-TV movie Westerns were introduced, such as: ''[[Lonesome Dove (film)|Lonesome Dove]]'' (1989) and ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''. As well, new elements were once again added to the Western formula, such as the Western-[[science fiction]] show ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002. ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' was a critically acclaimed Western series which aired on [[HBO]] from 2004 through 2006. [[Hell on Wheels (TV series)|''Hell on Wheels'']], a fictionalized story of the construction of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] for five seasons between 2011 and 2016. ''[[Longmire (TV series)|Longmire]]'' was a Western series that centers on [[Walt Longmire]], a sheriff in fictional Absaroka County, [[Wyoming]]. Originally aired on the [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] network from 2012 to 2014 it was picked up by [[Netflix]] in 2015 until the show's conclusion in 2017. \n\n[[File:Wild West 1908.jpg|thumb|300px|\"As Wild felled one of the redskins by a blow from the butt of his revolver, and sprang for the one with the tomahawk, the chief's daughter suddenly appeared.

I will save her!'\" (1908)]]\n\n==Visual art==\n{{Main|Artists of the American West}}\nA number of visual artists focused their work on representations of the [[American Old West]]. American West-oriented art is sometimes referred to as \"Western Art\" by Americans. This relatively new category of art includes paintings, sculptures, and sometimes Native American crafts. Initially, subjects included exploration of the Western states and cowboy themes. [[Frederic Remington]] and [[Charles M. Russell]] are two artists who captured the \"Wild West\" on canvas.<ref>{{cite news|author=Buscombe, Edward |title=Painting the Legend: Frederic Remington and the Western|work=Cinema Journal|date=1984|pages= 12\u201327}}</ref> Some art museums, such as the [[Buffalo Bill Center of the West]] in Wyoming and the [[Autry National Center]] in Los Angeles, feature American Western Art.<ref>{{cite book|author=Goetzmann, William H. |title=The West of the Imagination|location=New York|publisher= Norton|date= 1986}}</ref>\n\n==Other media==\nThe popularity of Westerns extends beyond films, literature, television, and visual art to include numerous other media forms.\n\n===Anime and manga===\nWith [[anime]] and [[manga]], the genre tends towards the [[Science fiction Western]] [e.g., ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' (1998 anime), ''[[Trigun]]'' (1995-2007 manga), and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' (1996-1999 manga)]. Although contemporary Westerns also appear, such as ''[[K\u014dya no Sh\u014dnen Isamu]]'', a 1971 [[sh\u014dnen]] manga about a boy with a Japanese father and a Native American mother, or ''[[El Cazador de la Bruja]]'', a 2007 anime television series set in modern-day Mexico. Part 7 of the manga series ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' is based in the American Western setting. The story follows racers in a transcontinental horse race, the \"Steel Ball Run\" race.\n\n===Comics===\n[[Western comics]] have included serious entries, (such as the classic comics of the late 1940s and early 1950s (namely ''[[Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'', ''[[Rawhide Kid]]'', and ''[[Red Ryder]]'') or more modern ones as [[Blueberry (comics)|Blueberry]]), cartoons, and parodies (such as ''[[Cocco Bill]]'' and ''[[Lucky Luke]]''). In the 1990s and 2000s, Western comics leaned toward the [[Weird West]] subgenre, usually involving supernatural monsters, or Christian iconography as in ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]''. However, more traditional Western comics are found throughout this period (e.g., ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' and ''[[Loveless (comics)|Loveless]]'').\n\n===Games===\nWestern [[arcade game]]s, [[computer game]]s, [[role-playing game]]s, and [[video games]] are often either straightforward Westerns or Western Horror hybrids.  Some Western themed-computer games include ''[[The Oregon Trail (1971 video game)|The Oregon Trail]]'' (1971), ''[[Mad Dog McCree]]'' (1990), ''[[Sunset Riders]]'' (1991), ''[[Outlaws (1997 video game)|Outlaws]]'' (1997), ''[[Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive|Desperados]]'' series (2001\u2013), ''[[Red Dead Revolver]]'' (2004), ''[[Gun (video game)|Gun]]'' (2005), ''[[Call of Juarez]]'' (2007), ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018). Other video games adapt the [[Science fiction Western]] or [[Weird West]] subgenres such as ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' (1997), ''[[Gunman Chronicles]]'' (2000), ''[[Darkwatch]]'' (2005), the [[Borderlands (series)|''Borderlands'' series]] (2009\u2013)'', [[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010), and ''[[Hard West]]'' (2015).\n\n===Radio dramas===\nWestern [[radio drama]]s were very popular from the 1930s to the 1960s.  Some popular shows include ''[[Lone Ranger#Original radio series|The Lone Ranger]]'' (first broadcast in 1933), ''[[The Cisco Kid#Radio|The Cisco Kid]]'' (first broadcast in 1942), ''[[Dr. Sixgun]]'' (first broadcast in 1954), ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel#Radio show|Have Gun\u2013Will Travel]]'' (first broadcast in 1958), and ''[[Gunsmoke#Radio series|Gunsmoke]]'' (first broadcast in 1952).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otrwesterns.com |website=otrwesterns.com |title=Old Time Radio Westerns |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319172946/http://www.otrwesterns.com/ |archivedate=2011-03-19 }}</ref>\n\n===Web series===\nWesterns have been showcased in short episodic web series.

However, space travel is described as restricted to military personnel and scientists despite its conveniences. The story goes on to describe an interplanetary war, started in 2041AD, with Earth involved. In 2044AD, Galactic Command (GALCOM) is formed to maintain law and order amongst planets. The Gammulan race opposes the alliance and war is waged between GALCOM and Gammulans.\n\nThe player takes the role of a recruit assigned to defend the GALCOM consortium of planets against Gammulans. The events of the game begin with GALCOM diplomatic craft developing a navigational malfunction and straying into Gammulan territory. GALCOM supreme commander Stranix reports a Sphinx class battlecruiser intentionally destroyed by a Gammulan orbital defence system, with no survivors; meanwhile, a team of Renegade class interceptors ambushes a Gammulan starfighter in GALCOM space.\n\n==Gameplay==\n*Free Flight: Player freely cruises the galaxy and learns the large array of controls and computer interfaces without fear of attack by alien craft or pirates.\n*Advanced Campaign Mode: In this mode the game is dynamic, and changes can occur rapidly and often through political and military influences.\n*Xtreme Carnage Combat Simulator: It is a combat simulator that allows the player to gain experience in combat operations, both planetbound and in free flight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesfirst.com/reviews/matt/Battlec/battlec.htm|title=Battlecruiser 3000 A.D.|website=www.gamesfirst.com|accessdate=4 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n[[Derek Smart]] began his game development career in the late 1980s, with a vision of creating an all-encompassing space simulation game, featuring strategy elements along with space, planetary, air and ground combat.<ref name=Loonygames>{{cite web|url=http://www.loonygames.com/content/1.27/guest/index5.php|title=loonygames' Guest Editorial: Derek Smart|accessdate=2006-12-05}}</ref> Smart became a notable personality in the video game world during the early 1990s, even before releasing his software debut. Smart became known to the then-nascent online gaming world through discussions taking place on [[Usenet]] about the game, his development efforts, and many other topics.\n\nThe game first appeared on the cover of ''[[Strategy Plus]]'' in 1992. Shortly afterwards, [[Three-Sixty Pacific]] obtained the rights. It held the rights for a year and went out of business shortly afterwards. 3000AD, Inc. then signed the rights with [[Mission Studios]]. Mission Studios also signed a distribution deal with [[Interplay Productions]] for its products. The game was showcased in 1994 winter and 1994 summer in CES under the Interplay Affiliated label brand. However, due to financial constraints, an agreement was reached which allowed 3000AD, Inc. to seek a new publisher. [[Intracorp]] bid for the rights to publish the game; with a disagreement over source code release, the deal never progressed beyond a letter of intent. The game appeared in E3 1995, then Intracorp went bankrupt shortly afterwards. [[Take-Two Interactive]] bought the publishing rights to the game from Mission Studios in 1995, and released v1.00 of the game,<ref name=Take2SECFiling>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/946581/0000891554-98-000123.txt|title=Take2 SEC 1998 10KSB Filing| date=1998-02-06}}</ref> with GameTek (UK) publishing the game in 1997.<ref name=Loonygames/>\n\nIn Take-Two Interactive's SEC filings on February 10, 1997, the company stated that ''Battlecruiser 3000AD'' accounted for 14.2% of revenue for the fiscal year ending October 31, 1996.<ref name=Take2SECFiling /> The filing also stated that Take-Two Interactive \"made advances in the aggregate amount of approximately $618,000\" for the title.<ref name=Take2SECFiling />\n\n== Versions ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center; width: 70%;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!style=\"background: #ececec;\"|Title\n| style=\"background:#ececec;\"|Released\n| style=\"background:#ececec;\"|Publisher\n|-\n!style=\"background: #ececec;\"| ''Battlecruiser 3000AD'' (U.S.)\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| 1996\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| [[Take-Two Interactive]]\n|-\n!style=\"background: #ececec;\"| ''Battlecruiser 3000AD'' (UK)\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| 1997\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| [[GameTek]]\n|-\n!style=\"background: #ececec;\"| ''Battlecruiser 3000AD'' v2.0\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| 1999\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]]\n|-\n!style=\"background: #ececec;\"| ''Battlecruiser Millennium''\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| 2001\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| [[Dreamcatcher Games]]\n|-\n!style=\"background: #ececec;\"| ''Battlecruiser Millennium Gold''\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| 2003\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| 3000 AD\n|}\n\n===''Battlecruiser 3000AD v2.0''===\n\nDevelopment of version 2.0 of the game continued throughout 1998, and [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]] announced that it would publish an improved version (dubbed ''Battlecruiser 3000AD v2.0'') through its Value Product Division.<ref name=\"Interplay\">{{cite news|url=http://interplay.com/press/bc3000ad.html|publisher=Interplay|title=Press Release: Interplay Value Products Division to distribute Battlecruiser 3000AD v2.0|date=1998-08-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818014813/http://interplay.com/press/bc3000ad.html|archivedate=2000-08-18}}</ref> Unlike the previous product, only a Windows version was supported.\n\n3D acceleration is supported only through 3dfx hardware.

This galaxy does not include a map. All the new scenarios included in this game take place in this new galaxy.

The full map now includes 96 starbases, 14,408 military bases and 71 star stations in total.\n*20 new Instant Action scenarios with a variety of missions ranging from easy to extremely hard, which brings the total number of Instant Action scenarios to 45.\n*One new ACM scenario (Broken Arrow?) with multi-branch scenarios which can either end up being 11 or 15 missions depending on the resolution of certain missions. In the GameStop exclusive version of the game, there is yet another ACM scenario. The total number of ACM scenarios is five depending on version.\n\nThe developer originally intended to introduce multiplayer feature when making the original ''Battlecruiser Millennium'' back in late 1999, but due to unforeseen circumstances, this feature was dropped in the initial product. The product was to use the RTIME Interactive Networking Engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/13/battlecruiser-3020-ad-gets-support-from-rtime|title=Battlecruiser 3020 AD Gets Support From RTIME|first=I.

However, this claim has been criticised as highly improbable by other game designers. In one article in a computer games magazine, Keith Zabalaoui, former [[NASA]] programmer and one of the designers of the [[Close Combat (series)|''Close Combat'']] series of strategy games, was quoted as saying, \"I have a hard time believing it's in there... the concept of training <nowiki>[neural nets]</nowiki> to do the complex tasks required in a game is inconceivable.

However, space travel is described as restricted to military personnel and scientists despite its conveniences. The story goes on to describe an interplanetary war, started in 2041AD, with Earth involved. In 2044AD, Galactic Command (GALCOM) is formed to maintain law and order amongst planets. The Gammulan race opposes the alliance and war is waged between GALCOM and Gammulans.\n\nThe player takes the role of a recruit assigned to defend the GALCOM consortium of planets against Gammulans. The events of the game begin with GALCOM diplomatic craft developing a navigational malfunction and straying into Gammulan territory. GALCOM supreme commander Stranix reports a Sphinx class battlecruiser intentionally destroyed by a Gammulan orbital defence system, with no survivors; meanwhile, a team of Renegade class interceptors ambushes a Gammulan starfighter in GALCOM space.\n\n==Gameplay==\n*Free Flight: Player freely cruises the galaxy and learns the large array of controls and computer interfaces without fear of attack by alien craft or pirates.\n*Advanced Campaign Mode: In this mode the game is dynamic, and changes can occur rapidly and often through political and military influences.\n*Xtreme Carnage Combat Simulator: It is a combat simulator that allows the player to gain experience in combat operations, both planetbound and in free flight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesfirst.com/reviews/matt/Battlec/battlec.htm|title=Battlecrusier 3000 A.D.|website=www.gamesfirst.com|accessdate=4 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n[[Derek Smart]] began his game development career in the late 1980s, with a vision of creating an all-encompassing space simulation game, featuring strategy elements along with space, planetary, air and ground combat.<ref name=Loonygames>{{cite web|url=http://www.loonygames.com/content/1.27/guest/index5.php|title=loonygames' Guest Editorial: Derek Smart|accessdate=2006-12-05}}</ref> Smart became a notable personality in the video game world during the early 1990s, even before releasing his software debut. Smart became known to the then-nascent online gaming world through discussions taking place on [[Usenet]] about the game, his development efforts, and many other topics.\n\nThe game first appeared on the cover of ''[[Strategy Plus]]'' in 1992. Shortly afterwards, [[Three-Sixty Pacific]] obtained the rights. It held the rights for a year and went out of business shortly afterwards. 3000AD, Inc. then signed the rights with [[Mission Studios]]. Mission Studios also signed a distribution deal with [[Interplay Productions]] for its products. The game was showcased in 1994 winter and 1994 summer in CES under the Interplay Affiliated label brand. However, due to financial constraints, an agreement was reached which allowed 3000AD, Inc. to seek a new publisher. [[Intracorp]] bid for the rights to publish the game; with a disagreement over source code release, the deal never progressed beyond a letter of intent. The game appeared in E3 1995, then Intracorp went bankrupt shortly afterwards. [[Take-Two Interactive]] bought the publishing rights to the game from Mission Studios in 1995, and released v1.00 of the game,<ref name=Take2SECFiling>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/946581/0000891554-98-000123.txt|title=Take2 SEC 1998 10KSB Filing| date=1998-02-06}}</ref> with GameTek (UK) publishing the game in 1997.<ref name=Loonygames/>\n\nIn Take-Two Interactive's SEC filings on February 10, 1997, the company stated that ''Battlecruiser 3000AD'' accounted for 14.2% of revenue for the fiscal year ending October 31, 1996.<ref name=Take2SECFiling /> The filing also stated that Take-Two Interactive \"made advances in the aggregate amount of approximately $618,000\" for the title.<ref name=Take2SECFiling />\n\n== Versions ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center; width: 70%;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!style=\"background: #ececec;\"|Title\n| style=\"background:#ececec;\"|Released\n| style=\"background:#ececec;\"|Publisher\n|-\n!style=\"background: #ececec;\"| ''Battlecruiser 3000AD'' (U.S.)\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| 1996\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| [[Take-Two Interactive]]\n|-\n!style=\"background: #ececec;\"| ''Battlecruiser 3000AD'' (UK)\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| 1997\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| [[GameTek]]\n|-\n!style=\"background: #ececec;\"| ''Battlecruiser 3000AD'' v2.0\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| 1999\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]]\n|-\n!style=\"background: #ececec;\"| ''Battlecruiser Millennium''\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| 2001\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| [[Dreamcatcher Games]]\n|-\n!style=\"background: #ececec;\"| ''Battlecruiser Millennium Gold''\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| 2003\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"| 3000 AD\n|}\n\n===''Battlecruiser 3000AD v2.0''===\n\nDevelopment of version 2.0 of the game continued throughout 1998, and [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]] announced that it would publish an improved version (dubbed ''Battlecruiser 3000AD v2.0'') through its Value Product Division.<ref name=\"Interplay\">{{cite news|url=http://interplay.com/press/bc3000ad.html|publisher=Interplay|title=Press Release: Interplay Value Products Division to distribute Battlecruiser 3000AD v2.0|date=1998-08-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818014813/http://interplay.com/press/bc3000ad.html|archivedate=2000-08-18}}</ref> Unlike the previous product, only a Windows version was supported.\n\n3D acceleration is supported only through 3dfx hardware.

In the GameStop exclusive version of the game, there is yet another ACM scenario. The total number of ACM scenarios is five depending on version.\n\nThe developer originally intended to introduce multiplayer feature when making the original ''Battlecruiser Millennium'' back in late 1999, but due to unforeseen circumstances, this feature was dropped in the initial product. The product was to use the RTIME Interactive Networking Engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/13/battlecruiser-3020-ad-gets-support-from-rtime|title=Battlecruiser 3020 AD Gets Support From RTIME|first=I.

However, this claim has been criticised as highly improbable by other game designers. In one article in a computer games magazine, Keith Zabalaoui, former [[NASA]] programmer and one of the designers of the [[Close Combat (series)|''Close Combat'']] series of strategy games, was quoted as saying, \"I have a hard time believing it's in there... the concept of training <nowiki>[neural nets]</nowiki> to do the complex tasks required in a game is inconceivable.

G. Bhandarkar]], and others. In 1888, he obtained a medical degree with honors and entered into [[Public service|government service]]. After that, he worked as a [[medic]] in several hospitals across South India and as a medical lecturer. He also served as a magistrate during the [[British rule]] in Malabar.\n\nGopalan married Kallat Kausallyaammal on 30&nbsp;December 1894. According to the rituals involved, this was the first Brahmo wedding. Ramakrishna Gobal Bhandhakar, a Brahmo leader and social reformer at that time, conducted the wedding at the Madras Brahmo Samaj. Several Brahmo leaders presided over the wedding. Kallat Kausallyaammal was a supporter of Gopalan and assisted his social reform activities.\n\nGopalan worked as a doctor, chief surgeon, and [[Chief physician|superintendent]] at several hospitals in [[South India]], including in [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]], [[Tiruchirappalli|Tiruchirapalli]], [[Madurai]], [[Chennai]], [[Mysore]], and [[Bangalore]] ([[Bowring & Lady Curzon Hospitals]]). He returned to Kerala in 1896 and joined [[Kuthiravattam Mental Hospital|Calicut Lunatic asylum]] (now the Kuthiravattom Mental Hospital) as its first superintendent. Meanwhile, [[caste]] and [[racial discrimination]], evil practices, beliefs, and social injustices were prevalent in Kerala, and atrocities against women and children were at their peak.

A Brahmomandir was also constructed in 1928 at: Poonthoppu, Kommady, Alappuzha (now Grihalakshmi Gandhi Smaraka Seva Sangam) with the donation by a [[landlord]] ([[Jenmi]]) of Alleppey, named Mangalath Cochoumini Channar. Channar was once a strict follower of [[Narayana Guru|Sree Narayana Guru]], but was later influenced by the reform activities of Gopalan and Brahmo Samaj. His daughter, Mangalath Cochoumini Mandhakinibai, spearheaded the reform activities at Alappuzha Brahmosamaj and was married to Gopalan's third son, Devadath Ayathan. This was the first Brahmo wedding conducted at Alappuzha Brahmo Samaj, which ignited the custom of Misra Vivaham all over South Kerala.\n\n== Social reform activities ==\nIn the year 1900, Gopalan along with his wife Kallat Kausallyaammal initiated the [[Sugunavardhini Movement]] and extended his social reform activities. Through this movement, he worked to foster human values in children,attract children to do social activities, protect the rights of women, and provide free education to girls and marginalized sections of society, especially the [[Harijan]] communities in Kerala, that were then ill-treated by the higher castes, such as the [[Brahmin]]s and the [[Nair]]s. He established the Lady Chandhawarkar Elementary School intends to educate girls and the underprivileged section of society. Weekly meetings were conducted at his home, Santhi Ashram. Women, children, and people from all walks of life gathered there to share their sorrows with Gopalan and Kausallyaammal, who worked to address them. After the sad demise of Kallat Kausallyaammal, her daughter-in-law M.C. Mandhakinibai Devadath, took over the baton to unite women and the lower sections of the community to help them assert their social rights. It was Mandakinibai Devadath who first proposed The concept of \"women's organization\".\n\n[[Narayana Guru|Sree Narayana Guru]] arrived in Malabar during the time when Ayyathan Gopalan was going through a period of vigorous campaigns among the lower sections of Malabar for the upliftment of the underprivileged people and social reforms. After seeing the reform activities of Gopalan, he said,\"Everything's done here, I have nothing new to do\". Gopalan, though averse to idolatry and temple building, did not join with Guru. Sensing the social relevance of the [[Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam|Sree Narayana movement]], Ayyathan did not oppose it either. Gopalan realized that social reform was his way of life and did not take part in the national movement or agitations.Unlike the [[Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam|Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP)]], which had been established by Narayana Guru<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sreenarayanaguru.in/|title=narayana guru|website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Narayana Guru; \u1e62\u0101j\u012b, K.

According to the rituals involved, this was the first Brahmo wedding. Ramakrishna Gobal Bhandhakar, a Brahmo leader and social reformer at that time, conducted the wedding at the Madras Brahmo Samaj. Several Brahmo leaders presided over the wedding. Kallat Kausallyaammal was a supporter of Gopalan and assisted his social reform activities.\n\nGopalan worked as a doctor, chief surgeon, and [[Chief physician|superintendent]] at several hospitals in [[South India]], including in [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]], [[Tiruchirappalli|Tiruchirapalli]], [[Madurai]], [[Chennai]], [[Mysore]], and [[Bangalore]] ([[Bowring & Lady Curzon Hospitals]]).

A Brahmomandir was also constructed in 1928 at: Poonthoppu, Kommady, Alappuzha (now Grihalakshmi Gandhi Smaraka Seva Sangam) with the donation by a [[landlord]] ([[Jenmi]]) of Alleppey, named Mangalath Cochoumini Channar. Channar was once a strict follower of [[Narayana Guru|Sree Narayana Guru]], but was later influenced by the reform activities of Gopalan and Brahmo Samaj. His daughter, Mangalath Cochoumini Mandhakinibai, spearheaded the reform activities at Alappuzha Brahmosamaj and was married to Gopalan's third son, Devadath Ayathan. This was the first Brahmo wedding conducted at Alappuzha Brahmo Samaj, which ignited the custom of Misra Vivaham all over South Kerala.\n\n== Social reform activities ==\nIn the year 1900, Gopalan along with his wife Kallat Kausallyaammal initiated the [[Sugunavardhini Movement]] and extended his social reform activities. Through this movement, he worked to foster human values in children,attract children to do social activities, protect the rights of women, and provide free education to girls and marginalized sections of society, especially the [[Harijan]] communities in Kerala, that were then ill-treated by the higher castes, such as the [[Brahmin]]s and the [[Nair]]s. He established the Lady Chandhawarkar Elementary School intends to educate girls and the underprivileged section of society. Weekly meetings were conducted at his home, Santhi Ashram. Women, children, and people from all walks of life gathered there to share their sorrows with Gopalan and Kausallyaammal, who worked to address them. After the sad demise of Kallat Kausallyaammal, her daughter-in-law M.C. Mandhakinibai Devadath, took over the baton to unite women and the lower sections of the community to help them assert their social rights. It was Mandakinibai Devadath who first proposed The concept of \"women's organization\".\n\n[[Narayana Guru|Sree Narayana Guru]] arrived in Malabar during the time when Ayyathan Gopalan was going through a period of vigorous campaigns among the lower sections of Malabar for the upliftment of the underprivileged people and social reforms. After seeing the reform activities of Gopalan, he said,\"Everything's done here, I have nothing new to do\". Gopalan, though averse to idolatry and temple building, did not join with Guru. Sensing the social relevance of the [[Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam|Sree Narayana movement]], Ayyathan did not oppose it either. Gopalan realized that social reform was his way of life and did not take part in the national movement or agitations.Unlike the [[Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam|Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP)]], which had been established by Narayana Guru<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sreenarayanaguru.in/|title=narayana guru|website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Narayana Guru; \u1e62\u0101j\u012b, K.
