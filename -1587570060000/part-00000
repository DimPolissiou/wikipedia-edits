He has produced the hip hop groups [[The Pharcyde]] and The Wascals.\n==Early life==\nJ-Swift was born '''Juan Manuel Martinez''' in 1971 in Madrid, Spain. His Afro-Cuban father was a [[salsa music|salsa]] bandleader and multi-instrumentalist. In 1974 the family headed to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], settling in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]]. At age six, J-Swift enrolled in a piano conservatory, quickly proving to be a prodigy. The all-rap radio station [[KDAY]] introduced him to hip-hop in the early '80s, and the first record he ever got was by [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]].\n\n==Career==\nAround 1988 J-Swift met [[R&B]] musician [[Reggie Andrews]], producer of [[Dazz Band]]'s 1982 funk hit \"Let It Whip.\" After J-Swift composed three [[new jack swing]]-style songs to get his attention, Andrews suggested that he concentrate on writing and producing, and set him up with a recording studio (complete with a then-state-of-the-art Akai MPC60) at South Central Unit (SCU), an after-school program for disadvantaged young talent. This gave J the opportunity to submit songs to A&M Record's Rondor Music publishing, while additional work came via BMI's Cheryl Dickerson.

With Reggie Andrews' record collection at their disposal, J-Swift and [[The Pharcyde]] crafted a three-song demo in '91 and subsequently a hip-hop classic, 1992's [[Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde]]. Featuring the hit single ''[[Passin' Me By]]'', Pharcyde's debut went certified Gold. Disputes over production and credits caused a rift between J and the group (although they would later reunite on The Pharcyde's \"Trust\" remix in 2000, not to mention several J-Swift-produced tracks on [[Fatlip]]'s 2005 solo debut [[The Loneliest Punk]], and Fatlip and [[Tre Hardson]]'s 2007 holiday song \"All I Want for Xmas\").\n\nWith his own \"Fat House Productions\" acts [[Jazzyfatnastees]] and Quinton, J-Swift signed an ill-fated million dollar deal with [[Tommy Boy Records]] in 1993.

However, he warded off sin from her flesh and blood so that she became the mother of a pure child, not poisoned by sin as we are.

Luther claimed that though Mary possessed many virtues, she could not intercede for sinners. He claimed that the evidence for Mary's powers as a mediatrix was a result of improper translation of the Annunciation. Instead, Luther believed that Mary's lack of power to intercede is seen in her praising God and his blessings, not in taking credit for herself.<ref>Kreitzer,\"Luther Regarding the Virgin Mary\"</ref>\n\n===Development of doctrine===\nThe term \"Mariology\", although used by some Lutherans across liberal-conservative lines, was not originally a term coined by Lutherans. Today, some Lutherans prefer not to use the term \"Mariology\" to describe their own Marian doctrine because they are concerned the term implies an acceptance of the concept of [[development of doctrine]].<ref>{{harvp|Jackson|2007|p=244}}</ref> Additionally, some Lutherans only use the term in an external sense, such as describing Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, or Anglican teachings concerning Mary.<ref>{{harvp|Dhalenne|1954|p=1}}</ref>\n\n==Veneration==\n[[File:StPierreJeuneP156.JPG|thumb|A statue of Mary in the Lutheran church of [[Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune Protestant Church|Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune]], Strasbourg]]\nLuther composed a number of venerational poems, which focus on Mary's virginity. He also translated old devotional Latin hymns on Mary into German. They express in various ways the incarnation of God through a virgin:\n{{Poemquote|''The virgin body was pregnant, but she remained pure''\n''Here comes the saviour of the gentiles''\n''Divine grace from heaven came over the virgin'' and others.<ref name=\"B\u00e4umer_190\"/>{{Request quotation|date=July 2015}}}}\n\nThe Lutheran views on the veneration of Mary were interpreted differently by different theologians over time. Key is his interpretation of the Magnificat of Mary, which to some is a relic of the Catholic past, but to others a clear indication that he maintained a Marian piety.<ref name=\"B\u00e4umer_191\"/> Luther states in his Magnificat that one should pray to Mary, so God would give and do, through her will, what we ask. But, he adds, it is God's work alone.<ref name=\"B\u00e4umer_191\"/> Some interpret his Magnificat as a personal supplication to Mary, but not as a prayerful request for mediation. An important indicator of Luther's views on the veneration of Mary are not only his writings but also approved practices of Lutherans during his lifetime. The singing of the Magnificat in Latin was maintained in many German Lutheran communities. The Church Order (Kirchenordnung) of Brandenburg, Bugenhagen Braunschweig and other cities and districts decreed by the royal heads of the Lutheran Church maintained three [[Marian feast days]] to be observed as public holidays.<ref name=\"B\u00e4umer_191\"/>{{Request quotation|date=July 2015}} It is known that Martin Luther approved of this. He also approved of keeping Marian paintings and statues in the Churches.<ref name=\"B\u00e4umer_190\"/> He also advocated the use of the pre-Trent version of the [[Hail Mary]] (that is, \"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\") as a sign of reverence for and devotion to the Blessed Virgin.<ref>''Luther's Works'', 10 II, 407\u2013409</ref> The 1522 ''Betb\u00fcchlein'' (Prayer Book) retained the Ave Maria.<ref name=\"Johnson2015\">{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Maxwell E. |title=The Church in Act: Lutheran Liturgical Theology in Ecumenical Conversation |date=2015 |publisher=Fortress Press |isbn=978-1-4514-9668-0 |language=English}}</ref>\n\n==Comparison to Roman Catholic and Reformed views==\nLuther came to criticize Roman Catholics for blurring the distinction between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is manifested in human beings and religious service offered to them and other mere creatures. In some instances he considered the Roman Catholic practice of making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be [[idolatry]].<ref>''Augsburg Confession XXI 2''</ref>\n\n:\"Furthermore, how will you endure [the Romanists'] terrible idolatries? It was not enough that they venerated the saints and praised God in them, but they actually made them into gods. They put that noble child, the mother Mary, right into the place of Christ. They fashioned Christ into a judge and thus devised a tyrant for anguished consciences, so that all comfort and confidence was transferred from Christ to Mary, and then everyone turned from Christ to his particular saint. Can anyone deny this? Is it not true?\"<ref>''Luther's Works'', 47:45; cf. also {{harvp|Anderson|Stafford|Burgess|1992|p=29}}</ref>\n\nThis distinction separates Lutheran views from [[Roman Catholic Mariology]]. It is also significant in the context of Roman Catholic claims that modern Protestants deserted Luther's Mariology. Roman Catholics and Protestants may have held some similar views on Mary in the 16th century, but for Luther it was a \"passive\" Mariology, while for Roman Catholics it was \"active\" in suggesting devout veneration (\"''hyperdulia''\") and constant prayers for [[intercession]]. Questions have been raised as to whether the Marian views of Martin Luther could bring separated Christians closer together. There seems to be scepticism on both sides.<ref>{{harvp|D\u00fcfel|1968|p=}}{{Page needed|date=May 2017}}</ref> The eighth \"Lutherans and Catholics in Dialogue\" addressed these issues.\n\nThroughout Luther's life, he called Mary by the title Theotokos, Mother of God,<ref>''Luther's Works'', 21:346</ref>{{Request quotation|date=July 2015}}. Martin Luther as well as [[Martin Chemnitz]], \"the other Martin\" of early Lutheranism, are said to have prayed the pre-Trent Hail Mary, and very likely other suddenly-ex-Catholic Lutheran priests who were contemporaries of the two Martins likewise did. Modern Lutheran synods usually reject or at least do not actively recommend the practice of directly addressing Mary and other saints in prayers of admiration or petition as part of their religious worship of God.<ref>{{harvp|Wright|1989|p=}}{{Page needed|date=May 2017}}</ref>\n\nLutherans defended various Marian doctrines, such as the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]], in order to distinguish and distance themselves from the Reformed (Calvinists).<ref name=\"Heal2007\">{{cite book |last1=Heal |first1=Bridget |title=The Cult of the Virgin Mary in Early Modern Germany: Protestant and Catholic Piety, 1500-1648 |date=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-87103-7 |language=English}}</ref> When a Reformed preacher came to Saint Bartholomew's Lutheran Church in 1589 and preached against images, the Lutheran Church Fathers responded by placing a statue of the Virgin Mary on the high altar of the church, causing the preacher to retire to a quieter parish.<ref name=\"Heal2007\"/> In general, Calvinist iconoclasm \"provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs\" in Germany and \"antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox\" in the Baltic region.<ref name=\"Marshall2009\">{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=The Reformation|date=22 October 2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|isbn=9780191578885|page=114|quote=Iconoclastic incidents during the Calvinist 'Second Reformation' in Germany provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs, while Protestant image-breaking in the Baltic region deeply antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox, a group with whom reformers might have hoped to make common cause.}}</ref> At Saint Marien Church in Danzig, Lutheran clergy retained sacred artwork depicting the Coronation of the Virgin Mary and lit candles beside it during the period of Calvinist dominance in the region.<ref name=\"Heal2007\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n* [[John Calvin's views on Mary]]\n* [[Mariology of Petrus Canisius]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Marian doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church]]\n* [[History of Roman Catholic Mariology]]\n* [[Ecumenical meetings and documents on Mary]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|24em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|32em}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Anderson |editor1-first=H.

However, he warded off sin from her flesh and blood so that she became the mother of a pure child, not poisoned by sin as we are.

But the Virgin Mary, though without grace in the first conception, was full of grace in the second ... whereas other human beings are conceived in sin, in soul as well as in body, and Christ was conceived without sin in soul as well as in body, the Virgin Mary was conceived in body without grace but in soul full of grace.\"<ref>{{harvp|Anderson|Stafford|Burgess|1992|p=238}}</ref>\n\nLuther later rejected the stance of Mary as a mediator between Christ and humanity. Luther claimed that though Mary possessed many virtues, she could not intercede for sinners. He claimed that the evidence for Mary's powers as a mediatrix was a result of improper translation of the Annunciation. Instead, Luther believed that Mary's lack of power to intercede is seen in her praising God and his blessings, not in taking credit for herself.<ref>Kreitzer,\"Luther Regarding the Virgin Mary\"</ref>\n\n===Development of doctrine===\nThe term \"Mariology\", although used by some Lutherans across liberal-conservative lines, was not originally a term coined by Lutherans. Today, some Lutherans prefer not to use the term \"Mariology\" to describe their own Marian doctrine because they are concerned the term implies an acceptance of the concept of [[development of doctrine]].<ref>{{harvp|Jackson|2007|p=244}}</ref> Additionally, some Lutherans only use the term in an external sense, such as describing Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, or Anglican teachings concerning Mary.<ref>{{harvp|Dhalenne|1954|p=1}}</ref>\n\n==Veneration==\n[[File:StPierreJeuneP156.JPG|thumb|A statue of Mary in the Lutheran church of [[Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune Protestant Church|Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune]], Strasbourg]]\nLuther composed a number of venerational poems, which focus on Mary's virginity. He also translated old devotional Latin hymns on Mary into German. They express in various ways the incarnation of God through a virgin:\n{{Poemquote|''The virgin body was pregnant, but she remained pure''\n''Here comes the saviour of the gentiles''\n''Divine grace from heaven came over the virgin'' and others.<ref name=\"B\u00e4umer_190\"/>{{Request quotation|date=July 2015}}}}\n\nThe Lutheran views on the veneration of Mary were interpreted differently by different theologians over time. Key is his interpretation of the Magnificat of Mary, which to some is a relic of the Catholic past, but to others a clear indication that he maintained a Marian piety.<ref name=\"B\u00e4umer_191\"/> Luther states in his Magnificat that one should pray to Mary, so God would give and do, through her will, what we ask. But, he adds, it is God's work alone.<ref name=\"B\u00e4umer_191\"/> Some interpret his Magnificat as a personal supplication to Mary, but not as a prayerful request for mediation. An important indicator of Luther's views on the veneration of Mary are not only his writings but also approved practices of Lutherans during his lifetime. The singing of the Magnificat in Latin was maintained in many German Lutheran communities. The Church Order (Kirchenordnung) of Brandenburg, Bugenhagen Braunschweig and other cities and districts decreed by the royal heads of the Lutheran Church maintained three [[Marian feast days]] to be observed as public holidays.<ref name=\"B\u00e4umer_191\"/>{{Request quotation|date=July 2015}} It is known that Martin Luther approved of this. He also approved of keeping Marian paintings and statues in the Churches.<ref name=\"B\u00e4umer_190\"/> He also advocated the use of the pre-Trent version of the [[Hail Mary]] (that is, \"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\") as a sign of reverence for and devotion to the Blessed Virgin.<ref>''Luther's Works'', 10 II, 407\u2013409</ref> The 1522 ''Betb\u00fcchlein'' (Prayer Book) retained the Ave Maria.<ref name=\"Johnson2015\">{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Maxwell E. |title=The Church in Act: Lutheran Liturgical Theology in Ecumenical Conversation |date=2015 |publisher=Fortress Press |isbn=978-1-4514-9668-0 |language=English}}</ref>\n\n==Comparison to Roman Catholic and Reformed views==\nLuther came to criticize Roman Catholics for blurring the distinction between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is manifested in human beings and religious service offered to them and other mere creatures. In some instances he considered the Roman Catholic practice of making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be [[idolatry]].<ref>''Augsburg Confession XXI 2''</ref>\n\n:\"Furthermore, how will you endure [the Romanists'] terrible idolatries? It was not enough that they venerated the saints and praised God in them, but they actually made them into gods. They put that noble child, the mother Mary, right into the place of Christ. They fashioned Christ into a judge and thus devised a tyrant for anguished consciences, so that all comfort and confidence was transferred from Christ to Mary, and then everyone turned from Christ to his particular saint. Can anyone deny this? Is it not true?\"<ref>''Luther's Works'', 47:45; cf. also {{harvp|Anderson|Stafford|Burgess|1992|p=29}}</ref>\n\nThis distinction separates Lutheran views from [[Roman Catholic Mariology]]. It is also significant in the context of Roman Catholic claims that modern Protestants deserted Luther's Mariology. Roman Catholics and Protestants may have held some similar views on Mary in the 16th century, but for Luther it was a \"passive\" Mariology, while for Roman Catholics it was \"active\" in suggesting devout veneration (\"''hyperdulia''\") and constant prayers for [[intercession]]. Questions have been raised as to whether the Marian views of Martin Luther could bring separated Christians closer together. There seems to be scepticism on both sides.<ref>{{harvp|D\u00fcfel|1968|p=}}{{Page needed|date=May 2017}}</ref> The eighth \"Lutherans and Catholics in Dialogue\" addressed these issues.\n\nThroughout Luther's life, he called Mary by the title Theotokos, Mother of God,<ref>''Luther's Works'', 21:346</ref>{{Request quotation|date=July 2015}}. Martin Luther as well as [[Martin Chemnitz]], \"the other Martin\" of early Lutheranism, are said to have prayed the pre-Trent Hail Mary, and very likely other suddenly-ex-Catholic Lutheran priests who were contemporaries of the two Martins likewise did. Modern Lutheran synods usually reject or at least do not actively recommend the practice of directly addressing Mary and other saints in prayers of admiration or petition as part of their religious worship of God.<ref>{{harvp|Wright|1989|p=}}{{Page needed|date=May 2017}}</ref>\n\nLutherans defended various Marian doctrines, such as the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]], in order to distinguish and distance themselves from the Reformed (Calvinists).<ref name=\"Heal2007\">{{cite book |last1=Heal |first1=Bridget |title=The Cult of the Virgin Mary in Early Modern Germany: Protestant and Catholic Piety, 1500-1648 |date=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-87103-7 |language=English}}</ref> When a Reformed preacher came to Saint Bartholomew's Lutheran Church in 1589 and preached against images, the Lutheran Church Fathers responded by placing a statue of the Virgin Mary on the high altar of the church, causing the preacher to retire to a quieter parish.<ref name=\"Heal2007\"/> In general, Calvinist iconoclasm \"provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs\" in Germany and \"antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox\" in the Baltic region.<ref name=\"Marshall2009\">{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=The Reformation|date=22 October 2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|isbn=9780191578885|page=114|quote=Iconoclastic incidents during the Calvinist 'Second Reformation' in Germany provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs, while Protestant image-breaking in the Baltic region deeply antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox, a group with whom reformers might have hoped to make common cause.}}</ref> At Saint Marien Church in Danzig, Lutheran clergy retained sacred artwork depicting the Coronation of the Virgin Mary and lit candles beside it during the period of Calvinist dominance in the region.<ref name=\"Heal2007\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n* [[John Calvin's views on Mary]]\n* [[Mariology of Petrus Canisius]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Marian doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church]]\n* [[History of Roman Catholic Mariology]]\n* [[Ecumenical meetings and documents on Mary]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|24em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|32em}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Anderson |editor1-first=H.

The name of the city, originally '''Pleskov''' (historic Russian spelling {{lang|ru|\u041f\u043b\u0463\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044a}}, ''Pl\u011bskov''), may be loosely translated as \"[the town] of [[:wikt:purling|purling]] waters\". It was historically known in English as '''Plescow'''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bacon|first1=George A|title=The Academy: A Journal of Secondary Education, Volume 4|date=1889|pages=403}}</ref> Its earliest mention comes in 903, which records that [[Igor of Kiev]] married a local lady, [[Olga of Kiev|St.&nbsp;Olga]].{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Pskovians sometimes take this year as the city's foundation date, and in 2003 a great jubilee took place to celebrate Pskov's 1,100th anniversary.\n\nThe first prince of Pskov was [[Vladimir the Great]]'s youngest son [[Sudislav]]. Once imprisoned by his brother [[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]], he was not released until the latter's death several decades later. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the town adhered politically to the [[Novgorod Republic]]. In 1241, it was taken by the [[Teutonic Knights]], but [[Alexander Nevsky]] recaptured it several months later during a legendary campaign dramatized in [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s 1938 [[Alexander Nevsky (film)|movie]] [[Alexander Nevsky (film)|''Alexander Nevsky'']].\n\nIn order to secure their independence from the knights, the Pskovians elected a [[Lithuania]]n prince, named [[Daumantas of Pskov|Daumantas]], a Roman Catholic converted to Orthodox faith and known in Russia as Dovmont, as their military leader and prince in 1266. Having fortified the town, Daumantas routed the Teutonic Knights at [[Battle of Wesenberg (1268)|Rakvere]] and overran much of Estonia. His remains and sword are preserved in the local [[Kremlin (fortification)|kremlin]], and the core of the citadel, erected by him, still bears the name of \"Dovmont's town\".\n[[File:Pskov asv07-2018 Kremlin Daumantas Town img4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pskov Krom|Krom]] (or Kremlin) in Pskov]]\n\n===Pskov Republic===\n{{Main|Pskov Republic}}\n\nBy the 14th century, the town functioned as the capital of a [[Pskov Republic|de facto sovereign republic]]. Its most powerful force was the merchants who brought the town into the [[Hanseatic League]]. Pskov's independence was formally recognized by Novgorod in 1348. Several years later, the [[veche]] promulgated a law code (called the [[Pskov Judicial Charter|Pskov Charter]]), which was one of the principal sources of the [[Sudebnik of 1497|all-Russian law code]] issued in 1497.\n\nFor Russia, the [[Pskov Republic]] was a bridge towards [[Europe]]; for Europe, it was a western outpost of Russia. Already in the 13th century German merchants were present in ''Zapskovye'' area of Pskov and the [[Hanseatic League]] had a trading post in the same area in the first half of 16th century which moved to ''Zavelichye'' after a fire in 1562.<ref>{{cite book |title= The German Hansa|last= Dollinger|first= Philippe|authorlink= Philippe Dollinger|year= 1999 |publisher= Psychology Press|isbn= 9780415190732|pages= 105}}</ref><ref name = PskovHansa>\u0410\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0447\u0435\u0435\u0432 \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447, [http://hansarus.org/uploads/Files/FINAL_Pskov_Hansa.pdf \u041f\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0413\u0430\u043d\u0437\u0430 \u0432 \u044d\u043f\u043e\u0445\u0443 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c\u044f], \u041e\u041e\u041e \u00ab\u0414\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0439\u043d \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u00bb, 2012 {{in lang|ru}}</ref> The wars with [[Livonian War|Livonian Order, Poland-Lithuania]] and Sweden interrupted the trade but it was maintained until the 17th century, with Swedish merchants gaining the upper hand eventually.<ref name = PskovHansa/>\n\nThe importance of the city made it the subject of numerous sieges throughout its history. The [[Pskov Krom]] (or Kremlin) withstood twenty-six sieges in the 15th century alone. At one point, five stone walls ringed it, making the city practically impregnable. A local school of [[icon]]-painting flourished, and the local masons were considered the best in Russia. Many peculiar features of [[Russian architecture]] were first introduced in Pskov.\n[[File:BrullovKP OsadaPskovPolGTG.jpg|thumb|left|''Siege of Pskov by [[Stephen B\u00e1thory]]'', by [[Karl Bryullov]]]]\n\nFinally, in 1510, the city fell to [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite]] forces.<ref name=\"nyt79\">Maclean, Fitzroy (March 18, 1979). [https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/18/archives/pskov-a-journey-into-russias-past-pskov-an-old-russian-city.html Pskov: A Journey Into Russia's Past], ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>  The deportation of noble families to [[Moscow]] under Ivan IV in 1570 is a subject of [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s [[opera]] ''[[The Maid of Pskov|Pskovityanka]]'' (1872). As the second largest city of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, Pskov still attracted enemy armies. Most famously, it withstood [[Siege of Pskov|a prolonged siege]] by a 50,000-strong [[Poland|Polish]] army during the final stage of the [[Livonian War]] (1581\u20131582). The king of Poland [[Stephen B\u00e1thory]] undertook some thirty-one attacks to storm the city, which was defended mainly by civilians. Even after one of the city walls was broken, the Pskovians managed to fill the gap and repel the attack. \"It's amazing how the city reminds me of Paris\", wrote one of the Frenchmen present at B\u00e1thory's siege.\n\n===Modern history===\n[[Peter the Great]]'s conquest of [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] during the [[Great Northern War]] in the early 18th century spelled the end of Pskov's traditional role as a vital border fortress and a key to Russia's interior. As a consequence, the city's importance and well-being declined dramatically, although it served as a seat of separate [[Pskov Governorate]] since 1777.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Pskov became the center of much activity behind the [[front line|lines.]] It was at a railroad siding in Pskov, aboard the imperial train, that [[Tsar Nicholas II]] signed the manifesto announcing his abdication in March 1917, and after the Russo-German [[Brest-Litovsk]] Peace Conference (December&nbsp;22, 1917 \u2013 March&nbsp;3, 1918), the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]] invaded the area. Pskov was also occupied by the [[Estonia]]n army between 25 May 1919 and 28 August 1919 during the [[Estonian War of Independence]] when Bu\u0142ak-Ba\u0142achowicz became the military administrator of Pskov. He personally ceded most of his responsibilities to a democratically elected municipal duma and focused on both cultural and economical recovery of the war-impoverished city. He also put an end to censorship of press and allowed for creation of several socialist associations and newspapers.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nUnder the Soviet government, large parts of the city were rebuilt, many ancient buildings, particularly churches, were demolished to give space for new constructions. During [[World War II]], the medieval citadel provided little protection against modern artillery of Wehrmacht, and Pskov suffered substantial damage during the [[Nazi Germany|German]] occupation from July&nbsp;9, 1941 until July&nbsp;23, 1944. A huge portion of the population died during the war, and Pskov has since struggled to regain its traditional position as a major industrial and cultural center of Western Russia.\n\n==Administrative and municipal status==\nPskov is the [[administrative center]] of the [[oblast]]{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} and, within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it also serves as the administrative center of [[Pskovsky District]],{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} even though it is not a part of it.<ref name=\"Ref414\">Law #833-oz</ref> As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the '''[[City of federal subject significance|City]] of Pskov'''\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Pskov Oblast|districts]].<ref name=\"Ref414\" /> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the City of Pskov is incorporated as '''Pskov Urban Okrug'''.<ref name=\"Ref863\">Law #419-oz.</ref>\n\n==Landmarks and sights==\n[[File:Pskov Krom.jpg|thumb|left|Pskov Krom, view from the [[Velikaya River]]]]\n{{Infobox UNESCO World Heritage Site\n| WHS           = Churches of the Pskov School of Architecture\n| image         = Pskov asv07-2018 various76 John the Baptist Cathedral.jpg\n| caption       = The mid-12th-century cathedral of St.&nbsp;John.

Its medieval [[citadel]] is called either the Krom or the Kremlin. Within its walls rises the {{convert|256|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[Trinity Cathedral in Pskov|Trinity Cathedral]], founded in 1138 and rebuilt in the 1690s. The cathedral contains the tombs of saint princes [[Vsevolod of Pskov|Vsevolod]] (died in 1138) and [[Daumantas of Pskov|Dovmont]] (died in 1299). Other ancient cathedrals adorn the [[Mirozhsky Monastery]] (completed by 1152), famous for its 12th-century [[fresco]]es, St.&nbsp;John's (completed by 1243), and the Snetogorsky monastery (built in 1310 and stucco-painted in 1313).\n\nPskov is exceedingly rich in tiny, squat, picturesque churches, dating mainly from the 15th and the 16th centuries. There are many dozens of them, the most notable being St.&nbsp;Basil's on the Hill (1413), St.&nbsp;Kozma and Demian's near the Bridge (1463), St.&nbsp;George's from the Downhill (1494), Assumption from the Ferryside (1444, 1521), and St.&nbsp;Nicholas' from Usokha (1536). The 17th-century residential architecture is represented by merchant [[mansion]]s, such as the Salt House, the Pogankin Palace, and the Trubinsky mansion.\n\nAmong the sights in the vicinity of Pskov are [[Izborsk]], a seat of [[Rurik]]'s brother in the 9th century and one of the most formidable fortresses of medieval Russia; the [[Pskov Monastery of the Caves]], the oldest continually functioning monastery in Russia (founded in the mid-15th century) and a magnet for pilgrims from all over the country; the 16th-century [[Krypetsky Monastery]]; [[Yelizarov Convent]], which used to be a great cultural and literary center of medieval Russia; and [[Mikhaylovskoye Museum Reserve|Mikhaylovskoye]], a family home of [[Alexander Pushkin]] where he wrote some of the best known lines in the [[Russian language]]. The national poet of Russia is buried in the ancient cloister at the Holy Mountains nearby. Unfortunately, the area presently has only a minimal [[tourist]] [[infrastructure]], and the historic core of Pskov requires serious investments to realize its great tourist potential.\n\nOn 7 July 2019, the Churches of the Pskov School of Architecture was inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2005/|title=Six cultural sites added to UNESCO's World Heritage List|website=UNESCO|date=7 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe [[climate]] of Pskov is [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with maritime influences due to the city's relative proximity to the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Gulf of Finland]]; with relative soft (for Russia) but long winter (usually five months per year) and warm summer.

The name of the city, originally '''Pleskov''' (historic Russian spelling {{lang|ru|\u041f\u043b\u0463\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044a}}, ''Pl\u011bskov''), may be loosely translated as \"[the town] of [[:wikt:purling|purling]] waters\". It was historically known in English as '''Plescow'''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bacon|first1=George A|title=The Academy: A Journal of Secondary Education, Volume 4|date=1889|pages=403}}</ref> Its earliest mention comes in 903, which records that [[Igor of Kiev]] married a local lady, [[Olga of Kiev|St.&nbsp;Olga]].{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Pskovians sometimes take this year as the city's foundation date, and in 2003 a great jubilee took place to celebrate Pskov's 1,100th anniversary.\n\nThe first prince of Pskov was [[Vladimir the Great]]'s youngest son [[Sudislav]]. Once imprisoned by his brother [[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]], he was not released until the latter's death several decades later. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the town adhered politically to the [[Novgorod Republic]]. In 1241, it was taken by the [[Teutonic Knights]], but [[Alexander Nevsky]] recaptured it several months later during a legendary campaign dramatized in [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s 1938 [[Alexander Nevsky (film)|movie]] [[Alexander Nevsky (film)|''Alexander Nevsky'']].\n\nIn order to secure their independence from the knights, the Pskovians elected a [[Lithuania]]n prince, named [[Daumantas of Pskov|Daumantas]], a Roman Catholic converted to Orthodox faith and known in Russia as Dovmont, as their military leader and prince in 1266. Having fortified the town, Daumantas routed the Teutonic Knights at [[Battle of Wesenberg (1268)|Rakvere]] and overran much of Estonia. His remains and sword are preserved in the local [[Kremlin (fortification)|kremlin]], and the core of the citadel, erected by him, still bears the name of \"Dovmont's town\".\n[[File:Pskov asv07-2018 Kremlin Daumantas Town img4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pskov Krom|Krom]] (or Kremlin) in Pskov]]\n\n===Pskov Republic===\n{{Main|Pskov Republic}}\n\nBy the 14th century, the town functioned as the capital of a [[Pskov Republic|de facto sovereign republic]]. Its most powerful force was the merchants who brought the town into the [[Hanseatic League]]. Pskov's independence was formally recognized by Novgorod in 1348. Several years later, the [[veche]] promulgated a law code (called the [[Pskov Judicial Charter|Pskov Charter]]), which was one of the principal sources of the [[Sudebnik of 1497|all-Russian law code]] issued in 1497.\n\nFor Russia, the [[Pskov Republic]] was a bridge towards [[Europe]]; for Europe, it was a western outpost of Russia. Already in the 13th century German merchants were present in ''Zapskovye'' area of Pskov and the [[Hanseatic League]] had a trading post in the same area in the first half of 16th century which moved to ''Zavelichye'' after a fire in 1562.<ref>{{cite book |title= The German Hansa|last= Dollinger|first= Philippe|authorlink= Philippe Dollinger|year= 1999 |publisher= Psychology Press|isbn= 9780415190732|pages= 105}}</ref><ref name = PskovHansa>\u0410\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0447\u0435\u0435\u0432 \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447, [http://hansarus.org/uploads/Files/FINAL_Pskov_Hansa.pdf \u041f\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0413\u0430\u043d\u0437\u0430 \u0432 \u044d\u043f\u043e\u0445\u0443 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c\u044f], \u041e\u041e\u041e \u00ab\u0414\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0439\u043d \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u00bb, 2012 {{in lang|ru}}</ref> The wars with [[Livonian War|Livonian Order, Poland-Lithuania]] and Sweden interrupted the trade but it was maintained until the 17th century, with Swedish merchants gaining the upper hand eventually.<ref name = PskovHansa/>\n\nThe importance of the city made it the subject of numerous sieges throughout its history. The [[Pskov Krom]] (or Kremlin) withstood twenty-six sieges in the 15th century alone. At one point, five stone walls ringed it, making the city practically impregnable. A local school of [[icon]]-painting flourished, and the local masons were considered the best in Russia. Many peculiar features of [[Russian architecture]] were first introduced in Pskov.\n[[File:BrullovKP OsadaPskovPolGTG.jpg|thumb|left|''Siege of Pskov by [[Stephen B\u00e1thory]]'', by [[Karl Bryullov]]]]\n\nFinally, in 1510, the city fell to [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite]] forces.<ref name=\"nyt79\">Maclean, Fitzroy (March 18, 1979). [https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/18/archives/pskov-a-journey-into-russias-past-pskov-an-old-russian-city.html Pskov: A Journey Into Russia's Past], ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>  The deportation of noble families to [[Moscow]] under Ivan IV in 1570 is a subject of [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s [[opera]] ''[[The Maid of Pskov|Pskovityanka]]'' (1872). As the second largest city of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, Pskov still attracted enemy armies. Most famously, it withstood [[Siege of Pskov|a prolonged siege]] by a 50,000-strong [[Poland|Polish]] army during the final stage of the [[Livonian War]] (1581\u20131582). The king of Poland [[Stephen B\u00e1thory]] undertook some thirty-one attacks to storm the city, which was defended mainly by civilians. Even after one of the city walls was broken, the Pskovians managed to fill the gap and repel the attack. \"It's amazing how the city reminds me of Paris\", wrote one of the Frenchmen present at B\u00e1thory's siege.\n\n===Modern history===\n[[Peter the Great]]'s conquest of [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] during the [[Great Northern War]] in the early 18th century spelled the end of Pskov's traditional role as a vital border fortress and a key to Russia's interior. As a consequence, the city's importance and well-being declined dramatically, although it served as a seat of separate [[Pskov Governorate]] since 1777.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Pskov became the center of much activity behind the [[front line|lines.]] It was at a railroad siding in Pskov, aboard the imperial train, that [[Tsar Nicholas II]] signed the manifesto announcing his abdication in March 1917, and after the Russo-German [[Brest-Litovsk]] Peace Conference (December&nbsp;22, 1917 \u2013 March&nbsp;3, 1918), the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]] invaded the area. Pskov was also occupied by the [[Estonia]]n army between 25 May 1919 and 28 August 1919 during the [[Estonian War of Independence]] when Bu\u0142ak-Ba\u0142achowicz became the military administrator of Pskov. He personally ceded most of his responsibilities to a democratically elected municipal duma and focused on both cultural and economical recovery of the war-impoverished city. He also put an end to censorship of press and allowed for creation of several socialist associations and newspapers.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nUnder the Soviet government, large parts of the city were rebuilt, many ancient buildings, particularly churches, were demolished to give space for new constructions. During [[World War II]], the medieval citadel provided little protection against modern artillery of Wehrmacht, and Pskov suffered substantial damage during the [[Nazi Germany|German]] occupation from July&nbsp;9, 1941 until July&nbsp;23, 1944. A huge portion of the population died during the war, and Pskov has since struggled to regain its traditional position as a major industrial and cultural center of Western Russia.\n\n==Administrative and municipal status==\nPskov is the [[administrative center]] of the [[oblast]]{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} and, within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it also serves as the administrative center of [[Pskovsky District]],{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} even though it is not a part of it.<ref name=\"Ref414\">Law #833-oz</ref> As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the '''[[City of federal subject significance|City]] of Pskov'''\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Pskov Oblast|districts]].<ref name=\"Ref414\" /> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the City of Pskov is incorporated as '''Pskov Urban Okrug'''.<ref name=\"Ref863\">Law #419-oz.</ref>\n\n==Landmarks and sights==\n[[File:Pskov Krom.jpg|thumb|left|Pskov Krom, view from the [[Velikaya River]]]]\n{{Infobox UNESCO World Heritage Site\n| WHS           = Churches of the Pskov School of Architecture\n| image         = Pskov asv07-2018 various76 John the Baptist Cathedral.jpg\n| caption       = The mid-12th-century cathedral of St.&nbsp;John.

Its medieval [[citadel]] is called either the Krom or the Kremlin. Within its walls rises the {{convert|256|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[Trinity Cathedral in Pskov|Trinity Cathedral]], founded in 1138 and rebuilt in the 1690s. The cathedral contains the tombs of saint princes [[Vsevolod of Pskov|Vsevolod]] (died in 1138) and [[Daumantas of Pskov|Dovmont]] (died in 1299). Other ancient cathedrals adorn the [[Mirozhsky Monastery]] (completed by 1152), famous for its 12th-century [[fresco]]es, St.&nbsp;John's (completed by 1243), and the Snetogorsky monastery (built in 1310 and stucco-painted in 1313).\n\nPskov is exceedingly rich in tiny, squat, picturesque churches, dating mainly from the 15th and the 16th centuries. There are many dozens of them, the most notable being St.&nbsp;Basil's on the Hill (1413), St.&nbsp;Kozma and Demian's near the Bridge (1463), St.&nbsp;George's from the Downhill (1494), Assumption from the Ferryside (1444, 1521), and St.&nbsp;Nicholas' from Usokha (1536). The 17th-century residential architecture is represented by merchant [[mansion]]s, such as the Salt House, the Pogankin Palace, and the Trubinsky mansion.\n\nAmong the sights in the vicinity of Pskov are [[Izborsk]], a seat of [[Rurik]]'s brother in the 9th century and one of the most formidable fortresses of medieval Russia; the [[Pskov Monastery of the Caves]], the oldest continually functioning monastery in Russia (founded in the mid-15th century) and a magnet for pilgrims from all over the country; the 16th-century [[Krypetsky Monastery]]; [[Yelizarov Convent]], which used to be a great cultural and literary center of medieval Russia; and [[Mikhaylovskoye Museum Reserve|Mikhaylovskoye]], a family home of [[Alexander Pushkin]] where he wrote some of the best known lines in the [[Russian language]]. The national poet of Russia is buried in the ancient cloister at the Holy Mountains nearby. Unfortunately, the area presently has only a minimal [[tourist]] [[infrastructure]], and the historic core of Pskov requires serious investments to realize its great tourist potential.\n\nOn 7 July 2019, the Churches of the Pskov School of Architecture was inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2005/|title=Six cultural sites added to UNESCO's World Heritage List|website=UNESCO|date=7 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe [[climate]] of Pskov is [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with maritime influences due to the city's relative proximity to the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Gulf of Finland]]; with relative soft (for Russia) but long winter (usually five months per year) and warm summer.
