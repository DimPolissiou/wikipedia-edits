A number of factors such as stretching supply lines and the reinforcement of Allied military power (both in Morocco and Egypt) turned the tide in the favour of the Allies, and his forces were routed in the [[Battle of Tunisia]] in 1943. Before he could counterattack, German high command reassigned him to defend the [[Atlantic Wall]]. Rommel failed to stop the [[invasion of Normandy|allied invasion of Normandy]]. Though typically linked to the assassination of Hitler, Rommel probably did not take part in the [[July 20 plot]] as he did not want future generations to think that the Axis lost the war due to backstabbing.

A clock is a complex mechanical contraption made of a variety of materials and with many small moving parts <ref>Historical Clocks, 2012. Retrieved from: http://publish.illinois.edu/cuhistoricalclocks/preservation/</ref>. Even in perfect conditions lubricants deteriorate, particularly after three years. Clocks should be examined and re-lubricated every three years.  After five years, and certainly no longer than eight years, the whole movement is advised to be dismantled and \u2018cleaned\u2019 if excessive wear and expensive attention is to be avoided <ref name=ICON/> <ref>ICON, (2006).

[[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:06, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nVisual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. \n:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''\n:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock\u2019s history, as \u201c[...] various \u201cdirt\u201d or \u201csalt\u201d deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth//moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as \u201cthe abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of \u201csandpaper [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined \u201c[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> \n:b. '''Winding and setting'''\n:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.\n\n== Agents of Deterioration ==\n\nDamage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused. Agents of Deterioration  (AOD) are ten primary categories of threats to heritage objects. These agents of deterioration can occur while an object is in storage, on display, undergoing conservation, or during transportation of the object. <ref name=Canadian>{{cite web |last1=Canadian Conservation Institute |title=Agents of Deterioration |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration.html |website=Government of Canada}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical Force ===\n\nPhysical force is any impact, shock, vibration, pressure or abrasion that causes damage to an object. One of the most common causes of physical force damage occurs when handling the object. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\nClocks are complex functional objects; many have moveable working parts. Most commonly, these delicate inner-workings are metal, but clocks can be made of any number of materials, from wood to precious metals like silver and gold. They can have enamel inlays or delicate carvings and be a variety of sizes from small watches to large grandfather clocks or clock towers. Each clock is susceptible to physical damage. \n\nAny excessive physical force will break, damage, splinter the clock frame or easily shatter the glass of the object. Any excessive physical force will also injure the mechanics inside the clock which are critical to its operation. When a clock is in the custody of a professional institution such as a museum, proper barriers and monitored security are of the wood clocks greatly reduce this risk.Some common sources of physical force damage to clocks are:\n\n:a. '''Mishandling'''\n:The failure of a handler to remove loose items from their person can result in these items striking a clock\u2019s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving \u201cunsightly and potentially damaging marks.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a clock \u201c[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.\n:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''\n:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as \u201c[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily\u201d,<ref name=ICON /> as well as by turning the key one too many times. \n:In terms of improper hand setting, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand in an attempt to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.<ref name=ICON /> Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, \u201cRather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.\u201d <ref name=ICON />\n:c. '''Unstable storage or display''' \n:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock\u2019s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human caused accidents occur.\n\n=== Theft and Vandalism ===\n\nSome clocks are constructed out of precious materials that are a source of temptation for theft. They can be small enough to easily steal. If they are on display in a historic home that does not have conventional display cases for example, large clocks could be vandalize by visitors. \nWhile a minimal concern for most wood clocks, as they are rarely stolen in a burglary, a valuable historic clock may be more susceptible to theft.  With regard to vandalism, any public place runs a risk for any object being vandalized. In the case of wood clocks, slashing the wood, smashing the glass, or graffiti would be the most common problems for a public institution.   Obviously, high security, cameras, inspections after crowds leave, especially for highly coveted antique wood clocks would be required in any professional institution.\n\n=== Disassociation  ===\n\nThe disassociation agent of deterioration refers to the separation or loss of individual parts of an object. This is possible in clocks, especially during cleaning or maintenance when the clock has to be disassembled. \u201cClocks can consist of up to five hundred individual components\u201d <ref>{{cite web |last1=The Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material (AICCM) |title=Machinery, clocks and scientific equipment. |url=https://aiccm.org.au/things-we-conserve/machinery-clocks-scientific}}</ref>, so preventive conservation can be complex for these objects. Any one of those components can be lost or misplaced, resulting in damage to the object as a whole. If the part is critical, the clock may no longer run.\n\n=== Environmental Conditions ===\n\n\n'''Incorrect Relative Humidity'''\n\nThe variety of materials used in clocks, can be sensitive to fluctuations in humidity. \u201cA stable and appropriate relative humidity and temperature should be maintained to prevent parts from rusting, corrosion, darkening of silvers, and lubricants from drying out\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\">{{cite web |title=Preventative Conservation Workshop 2017 Part III: Clocks of Staatsburgh |url=http://staatsburghstatehistoricsite.blogspot.com/2017/10/preventative-conservation-workshop-2017.html |website=Staatsburgh State Historic Site}}</ref>. Humidity that is too damp can deform organic materials or corrode metals found in clocks (National Park Service, 2012). Dehydration from humidity levels that are too low are also a problem with clock materials. Fluctuating humidity leads to swelling and shrinking that can \u201cloosen the joints of organic components\u201d.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{cite web |title=The Museum Handbook Part I: Museum Collections |url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/MHI.pdf |website=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\nThe moisture in the air will impact the physical structure of the wood being a vascular material.  High humidity can cause warping, rotting, mold and fungus to the wood clock and can corrode the metal pieces of the clock. Wood clock must be kept in climate-controlled rooms for optimal preservation. A humidity ranges between 35%-60% is optimal for wood clock. \n\nIncorrect relative humidity can cause the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed, resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally.<ref name=Canadian/>\n\n\n'''Incorrect Temperature'''\n\nThe amount of water in the air and temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. \u201c[...] extremes in temperature and humidity\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near \"a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements.\" <ref name=ICON />\n\nClocks, regardless of the materials they are made of, are susceptible to damage from incorrect temperatures. Like light, temperature that is too high can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials <ref name=\"NPS\"/>. In some instances, the heat from the fire contribute to faster deterioration in mantel clocks <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>.\n\nWith wood clocks, temperature is critical to conservation and preservation. Extreme heat and freezing temperature will significantly damage the wood\u2019s surface.  Incorrect temperatures or uncontrolled climates wood clocks may be stored in, can rapidly deteriorate the condition of the wood. Moderate temperatures in the range of 68 to 75 (f) degrees is recommended. \n\nIncorrect temperature causes the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\n\n'''Pests'''\n\nDepending on the materials the clock is made of, pests may be attracted to it. This is especially true for wooden clocks, since many pests feed on organic materials like wood. Even for clocks that are made entirely of metal, spiders can cause problems because \u201ctheir webs attract dust and can clog a clock\u2019s movement\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nMany pests, rodents and insects burrow or feast on wood; wood clocks are very susceptible to infestations. Inspecting the wood clocks for droppings or signs of animal activity is highly advised.  Consistent pest control is critical to mitigate this issue.  \n\nShould a clock feature a wooden case, pests could be an issue. Woodboring insects may infest a clock if it is left in a vulnerable environment which supports the insects and allows them access <ref name=Canadian/>. Given that a wooden case can be the external structure of a clock, this is something monitor for aesthetic and functional reasons.\n\nPests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:\n:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''<!--intentional link to DAB page-->- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such \u201c[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n\n'''Light: Infrared and Ultraviolet'''\n\nOver-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways. Heat from a light source can cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.<ref name=Fahey /> Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration \u201c[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or \u201calligatored\u201d appearance.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\nMany of the materials used in clocks are prone to light damage, both ultraviolet and infrared. Visible light damage can cause discoloration and deterioration. Exposure to infrared can increase the temperature of the wood, this can cause increased oxidation, which causing damage to the wood\u2019s surface and develop irregular markings. \n\nUltraviolet light can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials like wood.<ref name=\"NPS\"/> Exposure to direct sunlight (UV) over long periods of time will damage the wood by warping, fading, dry-rotting, and cause damage to the wood structure.Exposure to both can ruin, alter, damage or color any stains or finishing on the wood clock as well.\n\n\n'''Pollutants'''\n\n[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]\nContaminants themselves vary and come into contact with a clock by way of various means. The following are two such examples:  \n:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock\u2019s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. \n:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.\n\nDust and other airborne abrasives can build up inside clocks and impeded and wear down their mechanisms. In the case of mantel clocks that have been displayed above fireplaces, these abrasives include soot. Other pollutants can cause oxidization and tarnishing in metal clocks. The cleaning agents used to remove pollutants can result in a chemical reaction with previously used lubricants or cleaning agents or with the materials of the clock. Excessive cleaning can \u201ccause more issues like over-drying of bearings and stress corrosion cracking of brass that is exposed to ammonia solution\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nAny elements which can corrode, degrade, or alter the condition of an object would adversely affect wood clocks. Chemicals, smoke, heat, gases, extreme sunlight are big concerns. The wood used in many wood clocks are very porous, and easily absorb the elements around their environment and affect the integrity of the wood. Well-sealed/insulated rooms mitigate pollutant damages.\n\nThe mechanisms within clocks are highly sensitive to external matter like oils from fingertips or dust, so much so, that it can cause the machine to malfunction if it gets into the wrong area <ref name=\"Moss\"/>. For static displays, the functionality of a clock is not always necessary, but limiting the introduction of organic matter through mishandling will prevent unnecessary decay over the life of the clock.\n\n=== Catastrophic Damage  ===\n\n'''Fire'''\n\nClocks are highly vulnerable to fire, being a wood object, they will turn into cinders quickly if exposed to fire and possible errant embers if near a fireplace.  It is not advised to place a wood clock too close to any fireplace or wood burning stove, heater, or pilot light.\nMany clocks are small enough that evacuating them during an emergency could be possible. Large clocks that belong to buildings, like clock towers, may survive fire and could possibly be restored. \n\n'''Water'''\n\nThe metal and wood components of many clocks are extremely susceptible to water damage. Because of the complexity of these objects, they are very challenging to dry if such damage occurs. Water damage is one of the greatest agents of deterioration for a wood clock; water warps, swells and rots the wood. It is extremely difficult if at all possible, depending upon the severity of the water damage to repair or restore the wood on the clock to its correct condition. Often times with salvaging warped or rotted wood, it has to be replaced entirely, if the original wood materials are available. Water damage also causes corrosion to the internal mechanisms of the clock.  Address any sign of water damage anything, or anywhere near a wood clock to mitigate this issue. \n\n=== Specific Types of Clock Damage ===\nDamage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.\n\n==== Wood damage ====\nDue to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.<ref name=Fahey /> Such changes in character from the wood's original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include \u201c[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives.\" <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Metal damage ====\nSimilar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This \u201c[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Finish or paint damage ====\nFinish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock's surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products \u201ccan actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.\n\n==== Interior or clockwork damage ====\nClockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.\n\n==== Improper cleaning and polishing ====\nMany cleaners and polishers contain properties that \u201c[...] have been proven to age poorly.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Resultantly, the use of such cleaners and polishers can prove detrimental. The use of ammonia based cleaning products for example on brass clock components can lead to an irreversible form of damage called [[Stress Corrosion Cracking]].<ref name=Moss /> Depending on the type of metal on which it is used, a metallic brush employed to apply cleaning products not only can create the proper conditions for corrosion, but can \u201c[...] remove any protective oxide layers even with careful use.\u201d <ref name=Moss />\n\n==== Improper lubrication ====\nAttempts by non-professionals to lubricate or repair clockwork can lead to serious damage and loss of clock functionality. A lubricant applied without first cleaning and polishing clockwork to remove the previous lubricant and contaminants can result in wear rather than prevent it.<ref name=Moss /> The combination of the newly applied lubricant with the previous lubricant often results in \u201c[...] an unwanted chemical reaction between the two lubricants [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> A careless lubricant choice can result in the use of inappropriate or \"Poor-quality oil\" on clockwork, which \"can become sticky leading to mechanical problems.\" <ref name=Fahey /> The inexperience of a non-professional can also lead to \u201cthe use of too much oil, or oil in the wrong place\u201d <ref name=ICON /> during attempts to lubricate clockwork. The application of too much of a lubricant can be damaging because it \u201c[...] usually causes the lubrication to run out of the bearing and by capillary action will cause the bearing to go dry.\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Totally ignoring the lubrication needs of clockwork can be jeopardizing not only because of lubricant degradation, but because of the acidic nature of the organic lubricants often used in antique clocks.<ref name=Moss />\n\n== Conservation and restoration ==\nInterventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.\n\n=== Conservators ===\n\nA [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to \u201c[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as \u201cSometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].\u201d <ref name=NAWCC>{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.\n\n=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===\n[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]].

Conservation experts advise clocks need to be serviced regularly. A clock is a complex mechanical contraption made of a variety of materials and with many small moving parts <ref>Historical Clocks, 2012. Retrieved from: http://publish.illinois.edu/cuhistoricalclocks/preservation/</ref>. Even in perfect conditions lubricants deteriorate, particularly after three years. Clocks should be examined and re-lubricated every three years.  After five years, and certainly no longer than eight years, the whole movement is advised to be dismantled and \u2018cleaned\u2019 if excessive wear and expensive attention is to be avoided <ref>ICON, (2006). Care and Conservation of Clocks. Retrieved from: \thttps://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_clocks.pdf </ref>. [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:06, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nVisual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. \n:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''\n:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock\u2019s history, as \u201c[...] various \u201cdirt\u201d or \u201csalt\u201d deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth//moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as \u201cthe abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of \u201csandpaper [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined \u201c[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> \n:b. '''Winding and setting'''\n:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.\n\n== Agents of Deterioration ==\n\nDamage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused. Agents of Deterioration  (AOD) are ten primary categories of threats to heritage objects. These agents of deterioration can occur while an object is in storage, on display, undergoing conservation, or during transportation of the object. <ref name=Canadian>{{cite web |last1=Canadian Conservation Institute |title=Agents of Deterioration |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration.html |website=Government of Canada}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical Force ===\n\nPhysical force is any impact, shock, vibration, pressure or abrasion that causes damage to an object. One of the most common causes of physical force damage occurs when handling the object. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\nClocks are complex functional objects; many have moveable working parts. Most commonly, these delicate inner-workings are metal, but clocks can be made of any number of materials, from wood to precious metals like silver and gold. They can have enamel inlays or delicate carvings and be a variety of sizes from small watches to large grandfather clocks or clock towers. Each clock is susceptible to physical damage. \n\nAny excessive physical force will break, damage, splinter the clock frame or easily shatter the glass of the object. Any excessive physical force will also injure the mechanics inside the clock which are critical to its operation. When a clock is in the custody of a professional institution such as a museum, proper barriers and monitored security are of the wood clocks greatly reduce this risk.Some common sources of physical force damage to clocks are:\n\n:a. '''Mishandling'''\n:The failure of a handler to remove loose items from their person can result in these items striking a clock\u2019s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving \u201cunsightly and potentially damaging marks.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a clock \u201c[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.\n:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''\n:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as \u201c[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily\u201d,<ref name=ICON /> as well as by turning the key one too many times. \n:In terms of improper hand setting, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand in an attempt to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.<ref name=ICON /> Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, \u201cRather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.\u201d <ref name=ICON />\n:c. '''Unstable storage or display''' \n:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock\u2019s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human caused accidents occur.\n\n=== Theft and Vandalism ===\n\nSome clocks are constructed out of precious materials that are a source of temptation for theft. They can be small enough to easily steal. If they are on display in a historic home that does not have conventional display cases for example, large clocks could be vandalize by visitors. \nWhile a minimal concern for most wood clocks, as they are rarely stolen in a burglary, a valuable historic clock may be more susceptible to theft.  With regard to vandalism, any public place runs a risk for any object being vandalized. In the case of wood clocks, slashing the wood, smashing the glass, or graffiti would be the most common problems for a public institution.   Obviously, high security, cameras, inspections after crowds leave, especially for highly coveted antique wood clocks would be required in any professional institution.\n\n=== Disassociation  ===\n\nThe disassociation agent of deterioration refers to the separation or loss of individual parts of an object. This is possible in clocks, especially during cleaning or maintenance when the clock has to be disassembled. \u201cClocks can consist of up to five hundred individual components\u201d <ref>{{cite web |last1=The Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material (AICCM) |title=Machinery, clocks and scientific equipment. |url=https://aiccm.org.au/things-we-conserve/machinery-clocks-scientific}}</ref>, so preventive conservation can be complex for these objects. Any one of those components can be lost or misplaced, resulting in damage to the object as a whole. If the part is critical, the clock may no longer run.\n\n=== Environmental Conditions ===\n\n\n'''Incorrect Relative Humidity'''\n\nThe variety of materials used in clocks, can be sensitive to fluctuations in humidity. \u201cA stable and appropriate relative humidity and temperature should be maintained to prevent parts from rusting, corrosion, darkening of silvers, and lubricants from drying out\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\">{{cite web |title=Preventative Conservation Workshop 2017 Part III: Clocks of Staatsburgh |url=http://staatsburghstatehistoricsite.blogspot.com/2017/10/preventative-conservation-workshop-2017.html |website=Staatsburgh State Historic Site}}</ref>. Humidity that is too damp can deform organic materials or corrode metals found in clocks (National Park Service, 2012). Dehydration from humidity levels that are too low are also a problem with clock materials. Fluctuating humidity leads to swelling and shrinking that can \u201cloosen the joints of organic components\u201d.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{cite web |title=The Museum Handbook Part I: Museum Collections |url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/MHI.pdf |website=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\nThe moisture in the air will impact the physical structure of the wood being a vascular material.  High humidity can cause warping, rotting, mold and fungus to the wood clock and can corrode the metal pieces of the clock. Wood clock must be kept in climate-controlled rooms for optimal preservation. A humidity ranges between 35%-60% is optimal for wood clock. \n\nIncorrect relative humidity can cause the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed, resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally.<ref name=Canadian/>\n\n\n'''Incorrect Temperature'''\n\nThe amount of water in the air and temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. \u201c[...] extremes in temperature and humidity\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near \"a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements.\" <ref name=ICON />\n\nClocks, regardless of the materials they are made of, are susceptible to damage from incorrect temperatures. Like light, temperature that is too high can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials <ref name=\"NPS\"/>. In some instances, the heat from the fire contribute to faster deterioration in mantel clocks <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>.\n\nWith wood clocks, temperature is critical to conservation and preservation. Extreme heat and freezing temperature will significantly damage the wood\u2019s surface.  Incorrect temperatures or uncontrolled climates wood clocks may be stored in, can rapidly deteriorate the condition of the wood. Moderate temperatures in the range of 68 to 75 (f) degrees is recommended. \n\nIncorrect temperature causes the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\n\n'''Pests'''\n\nDepending on the materials the clock is made of, pests may be attracted to it. This is especially true for wooden clocks, since many pests feed on organic materials like wood. Even for clocks that are made entirely of metal, spiders can cause problems because \u201ctheir webs attract dust and can clog a clock\u2019s movement\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nMany pests, rodents and insects burrow or feast on wood; wood clocks are very susceptible to infestations. Inspecting the wood clocks for droppings or signs of animal activity is highly advised.  Consistent pest control is critical to mitigate this issue.  \n\nShould a clock feature a wooden case, pests could be an issue. Woodboring insects may infest a clock if it is left in a vulnerable environment which supports the insects and allows them access <ref name=Canadian/>. Given that a wooden case can be the external structure of a clock, this is something monitor for aesthetic and functional reasons.\n\nPests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:\n:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''<!--intentional link to DAB page-->- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such \u201c[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n\n'''Light: Infrared and Ultraviolet'''\n\nOver-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways. Heat from a light source can cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.<ref name=Fahey /> Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration \u201c[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or \u201calligatored\u201d appearance.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\nMany of the materials used in clocks are prone to light damage, both ultraviolet and infrared. Visible light damage can cause discoloration and deterioration. Exposure to infrared can increase the temperature of the wood, this can cause increased oxidation, which causing damage to the wood\u2019s surface and develop irregular markings. \n\nUltraviolet light can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials like wood.<ref name=\"NPS\"/> Exposure to direct sunlight (UV) over long periods of time will damage the wood by warping, fading, dry-rotting, and cause damage to the wood structure.Exposure to both can ruin, alter, damage or color any stains or finishing on the wood clock as well.\n\n\n'''Pollutants'''\n\n[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]\nContaminants themselves vary and come into contact with a clock by way of various means. The following are two such examples:  \n:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock\u2019s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. \n:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.\n\nDust and other airborne abrasives can build up inside clocks and impeded and wear down their mechanisms. In the case of mantel clocks that have been displayed above fireplaces, these abrasives include soot. Other pollutants can cause oxidization and tarnishing in metal clocks. The cleaning agents used to remove pollutants can result in a chemical reaction with previously used lubricants or cleaning agents or with the materials of the clock. Excessive cleaning can \u201ccause more issues like over-drying of bearings and stress corrosion cracking of brass that is exposed to ammonia solution\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nAny elements which can corrode, degrade, or alter the condition of an object would adversely affect wood clocks. Chemicals, smoke, heat, gases, extreme sunlight are big concerns. The wood used in many wood clocks are very porous, and easily absorb the elements around their environment and affect the integrity of the wood. Well-sealed/insulated rooms mitigate pollutant damages.\n\nThe mechanisms within clocks are highly sensitive to external matter like oils from fingertips or dust, so much so, that it can cause the machine to malfunction if it gets into the wrong area <ref name=\"Moss\"/>. For static displays, the functionality of a clock is not always necessary, but limiting the introduction of organic matter through mishandling will prevent unnecessary decay over the life of the clock.\n\n=== Catastrophic Damage  ===\n\n'''Fire'''\n\nClocks are highly vulnerable to fire, being a wood object, they will turn into cinders quickly if exposed to fire and possible errant embers if near a fireplace.  It is not advised to place a wood clock too close to any fireplace or wood burning stove, heater, or pilot light.\nMany clocks are small enough that evacuating them during an emergency could be possible. Large clocks that belong to buildings, like clock towers, may survive fire and could possibly be restored. \n\n'''Water'''\n\nThe metal and wood components of many clocks are extremely susceptible to water damage. Because of the complexity of these objects, they are very challenging to dry if such damage occurs. Water damage is one of the greatest agents of deterioration for a wood clock; water warps, swells and rots the wood. It is extremely difficult if at all possible, depending upon the severity of the water damage to repair or restore the wood on the clock to its correct condition. Often times with salvaging warped or rotted wood, it has to be replaced entirely, if the original wood materials are available. Water damage also causes corrosion to the internal mechanisms of the clock.  Address any sign of water damage anything, or anywhere near a wood clock to mitigate this issue. \n\n=== Specific Types of Clock Damage ===\nDamage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.\n\n==== Wood damage ====\nDue to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.<ref name=Fahey /> Such changes in character from the wood's original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include \u201c[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives.\" <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Metal damage ====\nSimilar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This \u201c[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Finish or paint damage ====\nFinish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock's surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products \u201ccan actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.\n\n==== Interior or clockwork damage ====\nClockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.\n\n==== Improper cleaning and polishing ====\nMany cleaners and polishers contain properties that \u201c[...] have been proven to age poorly.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Resultantly, the use of such cleaners and polishers can prove detrimental. The use of ammonia based cleaning products for example on brass clock components can lead to an irreversible form of damage called [[Stress Corrosion Cracking]].<ref name=Moss /> Depending on the type of metal on which it is used, a metallic brush employed to apply cleaning products not only can create the proper conditions for corrosion, but can \u201c[...] remove any protective oxide layers even with careful use.\u201d <ref name=Moss />\n\n==== Improper lubrication ====\nAttempts by non-professionals to lubricate or repair clockwork can lead to serious damage and loss of clock functionality. A lubricant applied without first cleaning and polishing clockwork to remove the previous lubricant and contaminants can result in wear rather than prevent it.<ref name=Moss /> The combination of the newly applied lubricant with the previous lubricant often results in \u201c[...] an unwanted chemical reaction between the two lubricants [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> A careless lubricant choice can result in the use of inappropriate or \"Poor-quality oil\" on clockwork, which \"can become sticky leading to mechanical problems.\" <ref name=Fahey /> The inexperience of a non-professional can also lead to \u201cthe use of too much oil, or oil in the wrong place\u201d <ref name=ICON /> during attempts to lubricate clockwork. The application of too much of a lubricant can be damaging because it \u201c[...] usually causes the lubrication to run out of the bearing and by capillary action will cause the bearing to go dry.\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Totally ignoring the lubrication needs of clockwork can be jeopardizing not only because of lubricant degradation, but because of the acidic nature of the organic lubricants often used in antique clocks.<ref name=Moss />\n\n== Conservation and restoration ==\nInterventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.\n\n=== Conservators ===\n\nA [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to \u201c[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as \u201cSometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].\u201d <ref name=NAWCC>{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.\n\n=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===\n[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]]. In starting the project, examination of the clock revealed that \"The automata and clock elements seem to be running, but struggling, and the music sounds as though it needs a few extra hands to help play its tune.\" <ref>{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=Anglesey Abbey\u2019s Pagoda Clock|url=http://westdeanconservation.com/2012/06/05/anglesey-abbeys-pagoda-clock/|date=5 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> The clock was then disassembled, and care was taken to document information about each of the over 600 components both textually and photographically, including measurements and where each component fits within the clock. \"After examination, each component was cleaned and dried, wrapped in acid-free tissue, and stored with the catalogue number.\" <ref>{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=The Pagoda Part 2|url=http://westdeanconservation.com/2012/06/28/the-pagoda-part-2/|date=28 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cultural Conservation-Restoration |state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Clocks]]\n[[Category:Conservation and restoration]]\n[[Hr:Konzervacija satova]]\n", "name_user": "LEHarrison", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMaintenance", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_and_restoration_of_clocks"}

The game is a sequel to ''[[Aliens versus Predator (1999 video game)|Aliens Versus Predator]]'' (1999); both games are based on the characters of the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' and ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'' [[media franchise]]s as well as the ''[[Alien vs. Predator (franchise)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' crossover series. It is set on the fictional planet LV-1201, which houses a vast series of ruins infested with [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Aliens]] that is routinely visited by a clan of [[Predator (fictional species)|Predators]] who hunt the creatures for sport.\n\nThe game is played from a [[First person perspective|first-person perspective]]. In the [[single-player]] mode, players control one of three characters, each with their own abilities and individual story modes. An [[online multiplayer]] mode, which allows players to play as one of four teams in competitive modes, is no longer officially supported and requires a community developed patch to enable multiplayer.\n\nAn [[expansion pack]] titled ''AliensVversus Predator 2: Primal Hunt'' was released in 2002. A \"Gold Edition\" of ''Aliens Versus Predator 2'' followed, combining both the original game and the expansion pack into a single package. There was never an ''Aliens versus Predator 3'' nor any plans for a sequel, but in 2010 Rebellion Developments made a reboot simply titled ''[[Aliens vs. Predator (2010 video game)|Aliens vs Predator]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\nLike its predecessor, ''Aliens Versus Predator 2'' allows the player to choose one of three characters: an [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]], [[Predator (alien)|Predator]], or human Colonial Marine. Each character has different objectives, abilities and weapons at their disposal. The single-player campaigns present the player with a conventional series of levels that are designed around the abilities of each character.\n\nAs the Colonial Marine, the player uses a number of weapons to combat Aliens and Predators. The Marine wears armor for protection, and uses an image intensifier, flashlight, and [[flare]]s to improve visibility in dark areas.\n\nWhen playing as the Predator, the player uses a variety of weapons from the ''Predator'' films such as wrist blades, a throwing disc, and shoulder-mounted energy weapons. The Predator is more durable than the human or the Alien and can survive falls from greater heights than the human. It can use a cloaking device to become invisible and several different modes of vision to help in the detection of enemies, including [[infrared]] vision and a mode sensitive to electrical systems. Unlike in the previous game, the Predator in ''Aliens Versus Predator 2'' recharges its energy supply using a personal item.\n\nAs an Alien the player can explore most of the game's environments freely, even climbing across walls and ceilings. However, the Alien has no weapons and must use its claws, tail, and jaws to attack enemies. The player can also use a form of [[animal echolocation|echolocation]] in dark areas and can detect [[pheromone]]s to discern human or Predator enemies. The Alien can drop from any height without injury and is the fastest of the three player characters.\n\n===Multiplayer===\n''Aliens Versus Predator 2'' has several multiplayer modes which can be played through an internet or Local Area Network connection. In each game the player chooses one of four teams to play as: The Aliens, Predators, Marines, or corporate mercenaries (called \"Iron Bears\" in the game's storyline). Each team has unique abilities, advantages, and disadvantages. The Aliens are able to scale walls and ceilings and the Predators can become invisible, while the two human teams have a large array of heavy weapons as well as motion trackers.\n\nThere are six different multiplayer \"modes\" played on a number of \"maps\". \"Deathmatch\" mode is a free-for-all match in which the player's goal is to accumulate the highest number of kills. \"Team Deathmatch\" has the same goal except that the player is teamed with other players of the same species (or faction, in the case of the Colonial Marines and the Corporate Mercenaries). In \"Hunt\" there are two teams, one designated as the \"hunter\" and the other as the \"prey\"; the hunters accumulate points by killing the prey, while the prey can themselves become hunters by killing members of the hunter team. \"Survivor\" mode designates all players as \"defenders\" at the start; if a player is killed they become a \"mutant\" and can then earn points by killing defenders. Defenders gain points by staying alive without becoming mutants. \"Overrun\" is a timed match between two teams that is similar to \"Survivor\" except that each player has a finite number of lives; at the end of the round points are awarded based on the number of surviving members on each team. \"Evacuation\" is another two-team match with a finite number of lives, in which one team is designated as the \"attackers\" and the other as \"defenders\". The attacking team wins by killing all of the defenders, while the defending team wins by locating the map's evacuation point and having at least one member survive within it for ten seconds.\n\nIn November 2008, Sierra Entertainment shut down the master server browser for the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bit-tech.net/news/gaming/sierra-shuts-down-21-game-servers/1/ |title=Sierra shuts down servers for 21 games |last=Martin |first=Joe |date=October 9, 2008 |website=[[Bit Gamer]] |publisher=Bit-Tech |accessdate=February 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\nThe story of ''Aliens Versus Predator 2'' largely takes place in the year 2231, approximately 109 years after the events of ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' and 52 years after the events of both ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' and ''[[Alien 3]]''. Humanity has established an outpost on the planet LV-1201, which was found after the Weyland-Yutani Corporation traced the flight telemetry of the original derelict ship featured in ''Alien''. The planet was found to have\nextraterrestrial ruins of similar make and was a breeding ground for [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Xenomorphs]]. The research colony consisted of two major installations: the Primary Operations Complex (POC), designed with the same \"shake and bake\" architecture seen at Hadley's Hope in ''Aliens''; and the Forward Observation Pods, a set of four (originally five) scientific research facilities suspended over a canyon by a network of trellises, with an internal design style reminiscent of the Nostromo from ''Alien''. A garrison of corporate mercenaries known as the Iron Bears, led by the mercenary general Vassili Rykov, provides security while Dr. Aaron Eisenberg runs the science division.\n\nAt approximately 5:18 AM, on November 25, 2230, a lone Xenomorph (the player character in the game's Alien storyline) escaped from its confinement and caused significant collateral damage in a fight with an invading [[Predator (fictional species)|Predator]]. Referred to in-game as \"The Incident\", the fight resulted in the Primary Operations Complex being overrun with Xenomorphs. Since the POC was the communications link between the Forward Observation Pods and the rest of the galaxy, this leaves the survivors at the Pods stranded and unable to call for help. Six weeks later, the Colonial Marines are sent to investigate what happened.\n\nIt is later established in the [[expansion pack]] ''Aliens Versus Predator 2: Primal Hunt'' that LV-1201 was also once the location of a [[Predator (fictional species)|Predator]] hunting ground, where the Predators hunt Xenomorphs for sport. In ''Primal Hunt'', a lone Predator survivor from a previous botched hunt unwittingly caused a Xenomorph outbreak in Pod 5 while trying to alert other members of its kind to its location. The Iron Bears were forced to destroy Pod 5, while a lone Predator ship intercepted the call. The Alien storyline, which is the earliest point in the main game, picks up about five weeks after this catastrophe occurred.\n\n===Plot===\nThe three story lines in ''Aliens Versus Predator 2'' intersect and impact one another, unlike the preceding game. \n\n====Marine====\nIn January 2231, on board the ''USS Verloc'', the ship is carrying a small contingent of the U.S.C.M (United States Colonial Marines) to planet LV-1201. The Primary Operations Complex (POC), one of the main Weyland-Yutani facilities on the LV-1201, is missing contact with the rest of the pods for the last 6 weeks, and the Marines are to rescue survivors and secure the facility until the larger USCM 6th Battalion arrives.\n\nTwo dropships are deployed to the Primary Operations Complex, but they are separated by hurricane winds and one is damaged and forced to make an emergency landing outside the POC. Sergeant Hall and Red Team are sent to restore power, and White Team is sent to restore security control. Harrison, Shugi, and Blackwell are sent to clear the North Landing Bay and ensure that the wind shear radar is up. However, Harrison is immediately separated from the rest of his team and loses contact with them. He manages to restore power to the North Landing Bay and reactivate the landing beacon on his own, and the dropship immediately lands there. Harrison is then sent to the nearest security office to activate the POC's automated defenses. He succeeds, but accidentally wakes up the POC's alien inhabitants in the process. Red Team becomes pinned down in Yard Four. Dropship One takes off without Harrison, who is ordered to rendezvous with Hall's team; once he gets there, he is informed that Hall has been taken by the aliens. He attempts to rescue her, but by the time he finds her, she has already been impregnated with a Chestburster. She dies as Harrison finds her.\n\nThe Marines attempt to reach the Pods via the tunnel network connecting them to the POC. Harrison is sent ahead to deactivate tunnel security so the Marines' APCs can proceed through. However, in an attempt to prevent espionage, the facility's Internal Security Protocol Chief had tied the network security layer into the node protocol; as a result, the collapse of the network's data layer forces the Forward Pods to reboot their entire security system and leaving them vulnerable for 15 minutes. During this time, Aliens attack the Pods and six of the Iron Bears are killed before the Marines manage to arrive at the Pods.\n\nWhen the Marines reach the Pods, both Eisenberg and Rykov give the strike team a false assignment in order to conceal the fate of the people who died in the POC. To facilitate this, the pair have Harrison isolated and imprisoned while he attempts to establish a communication link with the Verloc.  Harrison escapes with the remote aid of a woman named Tomiko, an assemblyman's daughter.  Harrison is instructed to recover a data disk containing evidence of Eisenberg's illegal activities in exchange for reuniting him with his platoon.\n\nHarrison finds several members of White Team, but they are all killed by Xenomorphs and Predators before Harrison can activate the landing beacon for an incoming dropship. Harrison manages to kill a Predator himself before reaching the dropship. Tomiko transmits the coordinates of an old entry site to the Hive, and Harrison, now in his own Exosuit, proceeds after his fellow Marines whom Rykov has stranded.  Harrison's Exosuit is damaged during a fall, and he must proceed the rest of the way on foot. He locates his team in a massive chamber where the fossilized remains of an Engineer reside. A Xenomorph Queen attacks the squad, but Harrison is able to repel the Queen so that he and the rest of the Marines can escape via dropship. The Queen tries to stop them, but the dropship bombards her with missiles, killing her.\n\nAs the dropship puts distance between itself and the Hive, Tomiko overloads the fusion reactors in the Pods, destroying them and killing herself to save the marines. When the Marines return to the Verloc, Major McCain recommends abandoning any further rescue or salvage attempts on LV-1201, as they depart back to [[Earth]].\n\n====Predator====\nOn the night of July 3, 2211, a Weyland-Yutani research facility on the planet Korari came under attack by at least one Predator. A young Rykov, who was a Marine at the time, was among the survivors, but suffered a major injury to his back; he was honorably discharged from the Marines and began working as a mercenary shortly thereafter.\n\nBy November 2230, several predators have arrived at LV-1201; their arrival is brought to the attention of Rykov himself, who is now providing private security for the Weyland-Yutani installation there. The hunt lasts for at least a week, during which time one Predator self-destructs after losing in combat to an Alien (\"the Incident\") and two more are captured by the Iron Bears. Pursuing his captured clan-mates into the Forward Observation Pods, the player character eventually succumbs to electro-magnetic pulse grenades which render his equipment useless and result in his capture.\n\nRykov places the Predator in a lab where it remains in stasis for over five weeks. It is revealed that this Predator is responsible for Rykov's injuries and his burning desire for revenge. Saved from being impregnated with a Xenomorph and inadvertently released by Corporal Harrison, the Predator powers through a horde of humans, reclaims his equipment and sets off in pursuit of General Rykov.\n\nAfter escaping aboard a corporate dropship, the Predator fights through the Alien infested caves and tunnels beneath the pods and eventually manages to signal his clan using human technology to broadcast the signal to them. The Predator clan promptly arrive and re-arm the Predator, who then sets off to finish Rykov.\n\nFollowing Rykov, now encased in an Exosuit, deep into the Xenomorph Hive, the Predator fights his way into the heart of the Hive for a climatic battle with General Rykov. Overcoming his enemy, the Predator rips through Rykov's body, and claims his spine as his trophy after 19 years of chase. The Predator reunites with his clan and departs the planet in order to pursue the ''U.S.S. Verloc''.\n\n====Alien====\nOn November 2230, a day before the Incident at the POC, Dr. Eisenberg is discussing some of the facility's problems with a co-worker. Those problems include the loss of Pod 5 weeks earlier, missing artifacts, and unauthorized research conducted by Eisenberg, while the oversight committee is getting worried about the illegal activities and the loss of the facility staff on Pod 5, as the Weyand-Yutani Corporation is worried about being able to cover-up the research on the LV-1201 any longer. Eisenberg continues research regardless of liability.\n\nMeanwhile, a shipping crate hiding a Xenomorph egg is delivered to the colony, where an accident awakens the egg and releases the Facehugger. The Facehugger leaves the ship through a series of umbilical ductworks and begins to track an irritable guard, Cisco, through the POC. When Cisco retires to his quarters for a nap, the Facehugger springs on him and infects him.\n\nIn due time, a player-controlled Chestburster hatches, killing Cisco, while the Facehugger hides under Cisco's desk and soon after dies hidden. It flees through an open window and proceeds through the POC until it feeds on a group of captive cats. After feeding on the cats, the chestburster grows into a full Alien drone. When the guards find him, he goes berserk and murders them.\n\nThe alien fights its way through the POC, releasing other Xenomorphs being kept as test subjects along the way. It reaches the lower levels, finally encountering a Predator that had been stalking it, probably believing it would make a suitable challenge. It fatally wounds the Predator, which activates its Self-Destruct Device, creating a large hole that facilitates the Xenomorph invasion into the POC. This invasion prompts the ''U.S.S. Verloc'''s deployment.\n\nSix weeks later, the alien infiltrates the Pods during a brief security failure caused by Corporal Harrison. As the Xenomorphs attack the Pods, they weaken the defenses and release an artificial hive in the process.\n\nEisenberg has taken advantage of the Marines' arrival to initiate the Large Mass Specimen Extraction, a project to capture the Xenomorph Empress. As part of the plan, combat synthetics have wired explosive charges throughout the tunnels of the Hive. After leaving the Pods and armed with this information, the alien disables these explosives as it tracks the Empress.\n\nThe Empress is successfully captured, but the alien pursues her captors, including Eisenberg himself. It tracks them through an archaeological site, killing numerous guards, civilians, and Iron Bears mercenaries, to a dropship landing pad. It kills two Predators and sabotages the pad's support machinery, causing the dropship to crash. Furious, Eisenberg attacks the alien directly. The alien incapacitates Eisenberg and cocoons his artificial body to celebrate their victory.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = 85/100<ref name=MC>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/aliens-versus-predator-2 |title=Aliens Versus Predator 2 for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 8, 2013}}</ref>\n| Allgame = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=33706&tab=review |title=Aliens Versus Predator 2 - Review |last=White |first=Jason |website=[[AllGame]] |publisher=[[All Media Network]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115072002/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=33706&tab=review |archivedate=November 15, 2014 |url-status=dead |accessdate=August 6, 2016}}</ref>\n| CGW = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_211.pdf |title=Aliens Versus Predator 2 |last=Nguyen |first=Thierry |issue=211 |date=February 2002 |pages=84\u201385 |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}</ref>\n| EuroG = 6/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_avp2 |title=Aliens vs. Predator 2 |last=Bramwell |first=Tom |date=January 10, 2002 |website=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}</ref>\n| GI = 9.25/10<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200201/R03.0731.1727.30987.htm |title=Aliens Versus Predator 2 |last=Brogger |first=Kristian |issue=105 |date=January 2002 |page=92 |magazine=[[Game Informer]] |publisher=[[GameStop]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922191532/http://gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200201/R03.0731.1727.30987.htm |archivedate=September 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |accessdate=August 6, 2016}}</ref>\n| GamePro = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gamepro.com/computer/pc/games/reviews/18780.shtml |title=Aliens Versus Predator 2 Review for PC on GamePro.com |author=The D-Pad Destroyer |date=December 4, 2001 |website=[[GamePro]] |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG Entertainment]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050213233802/http://gamepro.com/computer/pc/games/reviews/18780.shtml |archivedate=February 13, 2005 |url-status=dead |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}</ref>\n| GameRev = B+<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/36126-aliens-vs-predator-2-review |title=Aliens Vs.

It was also included in the ''Gold Edition'' of ''Aliens Versus Predator 2'' released in May 2003, which bundled the original game and the expansion pack into a single package. ''Primal Hunt'' adds new weapons and multiplayer maps to the original game, as well as a single-player campaign which serves as a [[prequel]] to the storyline of ''Aliens Versus Predator 2''.\n\n===Gameplay===\nThe player is once again able to play as either a human, [[Predator (alien)|Predator]], or [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]] character, each with its own campaign and abilities. The plot lines of the three characters intersect and set up the events of the original game.\n\n===Plot===\nThe events of ''Primal Hunt'' are set on LV-1201, the same setting as the main game, but take place in earlier time periods. The stories of the Alien and Predator characters begin five hundred years before the events of  ''Aliens Versus Predator 2'' and continue in the year 2230, approximately six weeks before the events of the main game, which is also the time period of the human character's story. ''Primal Hunt'' revisits the Forward Observation Pods of the research facility and explains the destruction of Pod 5.\n\n====Marine/Mercenary====\nMajor Dunya, a female member of the Weyland-Yutani [[private military contractor]] known as the \"Iron Bears\", is stationed on LV-1201. She is ordered by her superior officer, General Rykov, to retrieve an artifact from a location known as the \"Zeta Site\" which houses part of a Xenomorph hive as well as technology from an alien race (the race of the \"space jockey\" found by the ''Nostromo'' crew in ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''). The player battles xenomorphs through the Zeta Site, retrieves the artifact, and returns to find that Aliens have infiltrated Pod 5. A Predator steals the artifact and the player defends the cargo area from Aliens until the pod is evacuated. Rykov then destroys the pod's supports, sending it crashing into the valley floor below.\n\n====Predator====\nIn the early 18th century (in Earth time), 500 years before the incident, a Predator spacecraft encounters the planet LV-1201 for the first time and the player Predator is sent there to hunt. The player battles numerous creatures before discovering that Xenomorphs also inhabit the planet. The player tracks the Aliens to their hive and activates an artifact which has the power to repel the Aliens. The game then shifts forward eight months, by which time the Predators have established a camp around the artifact. The player Predator descends into the hive in search of the Alien queen, but the artifact is deactivated and the camp is overrun by Aliens. While repairing a stasis field around a group of Alien eggs the Predator is attacked by a [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Facehugger|facehugger]] and the two are caught in the field and trapped in stasis for five hundred years.\n\nThe Predator awakens when Dunya deactivates the artifact, and the player tracks her to the research facility's Forward Observation Pods and breaks into Pod 5, inadvertently allowing the Aliens into the pod. The player retrieves the artifact and sends a signal to other Predators who are nine weeks away. The Predator is then killed by the Alien embryo bursting through his ribcage.\n\n====Predalien====\nThe Predalien character's story also begins 500 years earlier. The player begins by controlling a facehugger, exploring the Alien hive and Predator camp in search of a host. The facehugger attacks the Predator, but both become trapped in the stasis field. The game then shifts forward five hundred years to the chestburster emerging from the Predator inside Pod 5. The creature is an Alien/Predator hybrid, called the \"Predalien\" in the game, and the player controls it and searches for food until it grows into an adult. The player then battles human guards in search of the artifact, but is interrupted when Rykov destroys the pod's supports. The player must then battle several android guards in armored exosuits in order to escape the pod with other Aliens before it falls into the valley below.\n\n===Reception===\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = 55/100<ref name=Metacritic>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/aliens-versus-predator-2-primal-hunt-expansion-pack |title=Aliens Versus Predator 2: Primal Hunt Expansion Pack for PC Reviews |website=Metacritic |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=March 8, 2013}}</ref>\n| CGW = {{Rating|2.5|5}}<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_220.pdf |title=Aliens Versus Predator 2: Primal Hunt |last=Babler |first=Jason |issue=220 |date=November 2002 |page=118 |magazine=Computer Gaming World |publisher=Ziff Davis |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}</ref>\n| GI = 8/10<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200210/R03.0731.1827.19392.htm |title=Aliens Versus Predator 2: Primal Hunt |last=Brogger |first=Kristian |issue=114 |date=October 2002 |page=93 |magazine=Game Informer |publisher=GameStop |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041114011206/http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200210/R03.0731.1827.19392.htm |archivedate=November 14, 2004 |url-status=dead |accessdate=August 6, 2016}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 5.5/10<ref name=GameSpot>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aliens-vs-predator-2-primal-hunt-review/1900-2877990/ |title=Aliens vs. Predator 2 -

The game is a sequel to ''[[Aliens versus Predator (1999 video game)|Aliens versus Predator]]'' (1999); both games are based on the characters of the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' and ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'' [[media franchise]]s as well as the ''[[Alien vs. Predator (franchise)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' crossover series. It is set on the fictional planet LV-1201, which houses a vast series of ruins infested with [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Aliens]] that is routinely visited by a clan of [[Predator (fictional species)|Predators]] who hunt the creatures for sport.\n\nThe game is played from a [[First person perspective|first-person perspective]]. In the [[single-player]] mode, players control one of three characters, each with their own abilities and individual story modes. An [[online multiplayer]] mode, which allows players to play as one of four teams in competitive modes, is no longer officially supported and requires a community developed patch to enable multiplayer.\n\nAn [[expansion pack]] titled ''Aliens versus Predator 2: Primal Hunt'' was released in 2002. A \"Gold Edition\" of ''Aliens versus Predator 2'' followed, combining both the original game and the expansion pack into a single package. There was never an ''Aliens versus Predator 3'' nor any plans for a sequel, but in 2010 Rebellion Developments made a reboot simply titled ''[[Aliens vs. Predator (2010 video game)|Aliens vs Predator]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\nLike its predecessor, ''Aliens versus Predator 2'' allows the player to choose one of three characters: an [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]], [[Predator (alien)|Predator]], or human Colonial Marine. Each character has different objectives, abilities and weapons at their disposal. The single-player campaigns present the player with a conventional series of levels that are designed around the abilities of each character.\n\nAs the Colonial Marine, the player uses a number of weapons to combat Aliens and Predators. The Marine wears armor for protection, and uses an image intensifier, flashlight, and [[flare]]s to improve visibility in dark areas.\n\nWhen playing as the Predator, the player uses a variety of weapons from the ''Predator'' films such as wrist blades, a throwing disc, and shoulder-mounted energy weapons. The Predator is more durable than the human or the Alien and can survive falls from greater heights than the human. It can use a cloaking device to become invisible and several different modes of vision to help in the detection of enemies, including [[infrared]] vision and a mode sensitive to electrical systems. Unlike in the previous game, the Predator in ''Aliens versus Predator 2'' recharges its energy supply using a personal item.\n\nAs an Alien the player can explore most of the game's environments freely, even climbing across walls and ceilings. However, the Alien has no weapons and must use its claws, tail, and jaws to attack enemies. The player can also use a form of [[animal echolocation|echolocation]] in dark areas and can detect [[pheromone]]s to discern human or Predator enemies. The Alien can drop from any height without injury and is the fastest of the three player characters.\n\n===Multiplayer===\n''Aliens versus Predator 2'' has several multiplayer modes which can be played through an internet or Local Area Network connection. In each game the player chooses one of four teams to play as: The Aliens, Predators, Marines, or corporate mercenaries (called \"Iron Bears\" in the game's storyline). Each team has unique abilities, advantages, and disadvantages. The Aliens are able to scale walls and ceilings and the Predators can become invisible, while the two human teams have a large array of heavy weapons as well as motion trackers.\n\nThere are six different multiplayer \"modes\" played on a number of \"maps\". \"Deathmatch\" mode is a free-for-all match in which the player's goal is to accumulate the highest number of kills. \"Team Deathmatch\" has the same goal except that the player is teamed with other players of the same species (or faction, in the case of the Colonial Marines and the Corporate Mercenaries). In \"Hunt\" there are two teams, one designated as the \"hunter\" and the other as the \"prey\"; the hunters accumulate points by killing the prey, while the prey can themselves become hunters by killing members of the hunter team. \"Survivor\" mode designates all players as \"defenders\" at the start; if a player is killed they become a \"mutant\" and can then earn points by killing defenders. Defenders gain points by staying alive without becoming mutants. \"Overrun\" is a timed match between two teams that is similar to \"Survivor\" except that each player has a finite number of lives; at the end of the round points are awarded based on the number of surviving members on each team. \"Evacuation\" is another two-team match with a finite number of lives, in which one team is designated as the \"attackers\" and the other as \"defenders\". The attacking team wins by killing all of the defenders, while the defending team wins by locating the map's evacuation point and having at least one member survive within it for ten seconds.\n\nIn November 2008, Sierra Entertainment shut down the master server browser for the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bit-tech.net/news/gaming/sierra-shuts-down-21-game-servers/1/ |title=Sierra shuts down servers for 21 games |last=Martin |first=Joe |date=October 9, 2008 |website=[[Bit Gamer]] |publisher=Bit-Tech |accessdate=February 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\nThe story of ''Aliens versus Predator 2'' largely takes place in the year 2231, approximately 109 years after the events of ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' and 52 years after the events of both ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' and ''[[Alien 3]]''. Humanity has established an outpost on the planet LV-1201, which was found after the Weyland-Yutani Corporation traced the flight telemetry of the original derelict ship featured in ''Alien''. The planet was found to have\nextraterrestrial ruins of similar make and was a breeding ground for [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Xenomorphs]]. The research colony consisted of two major installations: the Primary Operations Complex (POC), designed with the same \"shake and bake\" architecture seen at Hadley's Hope in ''Aliens''; and the Forward Observation Pods, a set of four (originally five) scientific research facilities suspended over a canyon by a network of trellises, with an internal design style reminiscent of the Nostromo from ''Alien''. A garrison of corporate mercenaries known as the Iron Bears, led by the mercenary general Vassili Rykov, provides security while Dr. Aaron Eisenberg runs the science division.\n\nAt approximately 5:18 AM, on November 25, 2230, a lone Xenomorph (the player character in the game's Alien storyline) escaped from its confinement and caused significant collateral damage in a fight with an invading [[Predator (fictional species)|Predator]]. Referred to in-game as \"The Incident\", the fight resulted in the Primary Operations Complex being overrun with Xenomorphs. Since the POC was the communications link between the Forward Observation Pods and the rest of the galaxy, this leaves the survivors at the Pods stranded and unable to call for help. Six weeks later, the Colonial Marines are sent to investigate what happened.\n\nIt is later established in the [[expansion pack]] ''Aliens versus Predator 2: Primal Hunt'' that LV-1201 was also once the location of a [[Predator (fictional species)|Predator]] hunting ground, where the Predators hunt Xenomorphs for sport. In ''Primal Hunt'', a lone Predator survivor from a previous botched hunt unwittingly caused a Xenomorph outbreak in Pod 5 while trying to alert other members of its kind to its location. The Iron Bears were forced to destroy Pod 5, while a lone Predator ship intercepted the call. The Alien storyline, which is the earliest point in the main game, picks up about five weeks after this catastrophe occurred.\n\n===Plot===\nThe three story lines in Aliens versus Predator 2 intersect and impact one another, unlike the preceding game. \n\n====Marine====\nIn January 2231, on board the ''USS Verloc'', the ship is carrying a small contingent of the U.S.C.M (United States Colonial Marines) to planet LV-1201. The Primary Operations Complex (POC), one of the main Weyland-Yutani facilities on the LV-1201, is missing contact with the rest of the pods for the last 6 weeks, and the Marines are to rescue survivors and secure the facility until the larger USCM 6th Battalion arrives.\n\nTwo dropships are deployed to the Primary Operations Complex, but they are separated by hurricane winds and one is damaged and forced to make an emergency landing outside the POC. Sergeant Hall and Red Team are sent to restore power, and White Team is sent to restore security control. Harrison, Shugi, and Blackwell are sent to clear the North Landing Bay and ensure that the wind shear radar is up. However, Harrison is immediately separated from the rest of his team and loses contact with them. He manages to restore power to the North Landing Bay and reactivate the landing beacon on his own, and the dropship immediately lands there. Harrison is then sent to the nearest security office to activate the POC's automated defenses. He succeeds, but accidentally wakes up the POC's alien inhabitants in the process. Red Team becomes pinned down in Yard Four. Dropship One takes off without Harrison, who is ordered to rendezvous with Hall's team; once he gets there, he is informed that Hall has been taken by the aliens. He attempts to rescue her, but by the time he finds her, she has already been impregnated with a Chestburster. She dies as Harrison finds her.\n\nThe Marines attempt to reach the Pods via the tunnel network connecting them to the POC. Harrison is sent ahead to deactivate tunnel security so the Marines' APCs can proceed through. However, in an attempt to prevent espionage, the facility's Internal Security Protocol Chief had tied the network security layer into the node protocol; as a result, the collapse of the network's data layer forces the Forward Pods to reboot their entire security system and leaving them vulnerable for 15 minutes. During this time, Aliens attack the Pods and six of the Iron Bears are killed before the Marines manage to arrive at the Pods.\n\nWhen the Marines reach the Pods, both Eisenberg and Rykov give the strike team a false assignment in order to conceal the fate of the people who died in the POC. To facilitate this, the pair have Harrison isolated and imprisoned while he attempts to establish a communication link with the Verloc.  Harrison escapes with the remote aid of a woman named Tomiko, an assemblyman's daughter.  Harrison is instructed to recover a data disk containing evidence of Eisenberg's illegal activities in exchange for reuniting him with his platoon.\n\nHarrison finds several members of White Team, but they are all killed by Xenomorphs and Predators before Harrison can activate the landing beacon for an incoming dropship. Harrison manages to kill a Predator himself before reaching the dropship. Tomiko transmits the coordinates of an old entry site to the Hive, and Harrison, now in his own Exosuit, proceeds after his fellow Marines whom Rykov has stranded.  Harrison's Exosuit is damaged during a fall, and he must proceed the rest of the way on foot. He locates his team in a massive chamber where the fossilized remains of an Engineer reside. A Xenomorph Queen attacks the squad, but Harrison is able to repel the Queen so that he and the rest of the Marines can escape via dropship. The Queen tries to stop them, but the dropship bombards her with missiles, killing her.\n\nAs the dropship puts distance between itself and the Hive, Tomiko overloads the fusion reactors in the Pods, destroying them and killing herself to save the marines. When the Marines return to the Verloc, Major McCain recommends abandoning any further rescue or salvage attempts on LV-1201, as they depart back to [[Earth]].\n\n====Predator====\nOn the night of July 3, 2211, a Weyland-Yutani research facility on the planet Korari came under attack by at least one Predator. A young Rykov, who was a Marine at the time, was among the survivors, but suffered a major injury to his back; he was honorably discharged from the Marines and began working as a mercenary shortly thereafter.\n\nBy November 2230, several predators have arrived at LV-1201; their arrival is brought to the attention of Rykov himself, who is now providing private security for the Weyland-Yutani installation there. The hunt lasts for at least a week, during which time one Predator self-destructs after losing in combat to an Alien (\"the Incident\") and two more are captured by the Iron Bears. Pursuing his captured clan-mates into the Forward Observation Pods, the player character eventually succumbs to electro-magnetic pulse grenades which render his equipment useless and result in his capture.\n\nRykov places the Predator in a lab where it remains in stasis for over five weeks. It is revealed that this Predator is responsible for Rykov's injuries and his burning desire for revenge. Saved from being impregnated with a Xenomorph and inadvertently released by Corporal Harrison, the Predator powers through a horde of humans, reclaims his equipment and sets off in pursuit of General Rykov.\n\nAfter escaping aboard a corporate dropship, the Predator fights through the Alien infested caves and tunnels beneath the pods and eventually manages to signal his clan using human technology to broadcast the signal to them. The Predator clan promptly arrive and re-arm the Predator, who then sets off to finish Rykov.\n\nFollowing Rykov, now encased in an Exosuit, deep into the Xenomorph Hive, the Predator fights his way into the heart of the Hive for a climatic battle with General Rykov. Overcoming his enemy, the Predator rips through Rykov's body, and claims his spine as his trophy after 19 years of chase. The Predator reunites with his clan and departs the planet in order to pursue the ''U.S.S. Verloc''.\n\n====Alien====\nOn November 2230, a day before the Incident at the POC, Dr. Eisenberg is discussing some of the facility's problems with a co-worker. Those problems include the loss of Pod 5 weeks earlier, missing artifacts, and unauthorized research conducted by Eisenberg, while the oversight committee is getting worried about the illegal activities and the loss of the facility staff on Pod 5, as the Weyand-Yutani Corporation is worried about being able to cover-up the research on the LV-1201 any longer. Eisenberg continues research regardless of liability.\n\nMeanwhile, a shipping crate hiding a Xenomorph egg is delivered to the colony, where an accident awakens the egg and releases the Facehugger. The Facehugger leaves the ship through a series of umbilical ductworks and begins to track an irritable guard, Cisco, through the POC. When Cisco retires to his quarters for a nap, the Facehugger springs on him and infects him.\n\nIn due time, a player-controlled Chestburster hatches, killing Cisco, while the Facehugger hides under Cisco's desk and soon after dies hidden. It flees through an open window and proceeds through the POC until it feeds on a group of captive cats. After feeding on the cats, the chestburster grows into a full Alien drone. When the guards find him, he goes berserk and murders them.\n\nThe alien fights its way through the POC, releasing other Xenomorphs being kept as test subjects along the way. It reaches the lower levels, finally encountering a Predator that had been stalking it, probably believing it would make a suitable challenge. It fatally wounds the Predator, which activates its Self-Destruct Device, creating a large hole that facilitates the Xenomorph invasion into the POC. This invasion prompts the ''U.S.S. Verloc'''s deployment.\n\nSix weeks later, the alien infiltrates the Pods during a brief security failure caused by Corporal Harrison. As the Xenomorphs attack the Pods, they weaken the defenses and release an artificial hive in the process.\n\nEisenberg has taken advantage of the Marines' arrival to initiate the Large Mass Specimen Extraction, a project to capture the Xenomorph Empress. As part of the plan, combat synthetics have wired explosive charges throughout the tunnels of the Hive. After leaving the Pods and armed with this information, the alien disables these explosives as it tracks the Empress.\n\nThe Empress is successfully captured, but the alien pursues her captors, including Eisenberg himself. It tracks them through an archaeological site, killing numerous guards, civilians, and Iron Bears mercenaries, to a dropship landing pad. It kills two Predators and sabotages the pad's support machinery, causing the dropship to crash. Furious, Eisenberg attacks the alien directly. The alien incapacitates Eisenberg and cocoons his artificial body to celebrate their victory.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = 85/100<ref name=MC>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/aliens-versus-predator-2 |title=Aliens Versus Predator 2 for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 8, 2013}}</ref>\n| Allgame = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=33706&tab=review |title=Aliens Versus Predator 2 - Review |last=White |first=Jason |website=[[AllGame]] |publisher=[[All Media Network]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115072002/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=33706&tab=review |archivedate=November 15, 2014 |url-status=dead |accessdate=August 6, 2016}}</ref>\n| CGW = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_211.pdf |title=Aliens Versus Predator 2 |last=Nguyen |first=Thierry |issue=211 |date=February 2002 |pages=84\u201385 |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}</ref>\n| EuroG = 6/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_avp2 |title=Aliens vs. Predator 2 |last=Bramwell |first=Tom |date=January 10, 2002 |website=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}</ref>\n| GI = 9.25/10<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200201/R03.0731.1727.30987.htm |title=Aliens Versus Predator 2 |last=Brogger |first=Kristian |issue=105 |date=January 2002 |page=92 |magazine=[[Game Informer]] |publisher=[[GameStop]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922191532/http://gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200201/R03.0731.1727.30987.htm |archivedate=September 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |accessdate=August 6, 2016}}</ref>\n| GamePro = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gamepro.com/computer/pc/games/reviews/18780.shtml |title=Aliens Versus Predator 2 Review for PC on GamePro.com |author=The D-Pad Destroyer |date=December 4, 2001 |website=[[GamePro]] |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG Entertainment]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050213233802/http://gamepro.com/computer/pc/games/reviews/18780.shtml |archivedate=February 13, 2005 |url-status=dead |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}</ref>\n| GameRev = B+<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/36126-aliens-vs-predator-2-review |title=Aliens Vs.

It was also included in the ''Gold Edition'' of ''Aliens versus Predator 2'' released in May 2003, which bundled the original game and the expansion pack into a single package. ''Primal Hunt'' adds new weapons and multiplayer maps to the original game, as well as a single-player campaign which serves as a [[prequel]] to the storyline of ''Aliens versus Predator 2''.\n\n===Gameplay===\nThe player is once again able to play as either a human, [[Predator (alien)|Predator]], or [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]] character, each with its own campaign and abilities. The plot lines of the three characters intersect and set up the events of the original game.\n\n===Plot===\nThe events of ''Primal Hunt'' are set on LV-1201, the same setting as the main game, but take place in earlier time periods. The stories of the Alien and Predator characters begin five hundred years before the events of  ''Aliens versus Predator 2'' and continue in the year 2230, approximately six weeks before the events of the main game, which is also the time period of the human character's story. ''Primal Hunt'' revisits the Forward Observation Pods of the research facility and explains the destruction of Pod 5.\n\n====Marine/Mercenary====\nMajor Dunya, a female member of the Weyland-Yutani [[private military contractor]] known as the \"Iron Bears\", is stationed on LV-1201. She is ordered by her superior officer, General Rykov, to retrieve an artifact from a location known as the \"Zeta Site\" which houses part of a Xenomorph hive as well as technology from an alien race (the race of the \"space jockey\" found by the ''Nostromo'' crew in ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''). The player battles xenomorphs through the Zeta Site, retrieves the artifact, and returns to find that Aliens have infiltrated Pod 5. A Predator steals the artifact and the player defends the cargo area from Aliens until the pod is evacuated. Rykov then destroys the pod's supports, sending it crashing into the valley floor below.\n\n====Predator====\nIn the early 18th century (in Earth time), 500 years before the incident, a Predator spacecraft encounters the planet LV-1201 for the first time and the player Predator is sent there to hunt. The player battles numerous creatures before discovering that Xenomorphs also inhabit the planet. The player tracks the Aliens to their hive and activates an artifact which has the power to repel the Aliens. The game then shifts forward eight months, by which time the Predators have established a camp around the artifact. The player Predator descends into the hive in search of the Alien queen, but the artifact is deactivated and the camp is overrun by Aliens. While repairing a stasis field around a group of Alien eggs the Predator is attacked by a [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Facehugger|facehugger]] and the two are caught in the field and trapped in stasis for five hundred years.\n\nThe Predator awakens when Dunya deactivates the artifact, and the player tracks her to the research facility's Forward Observation Pods and breaks into Pod 5, inadvertently allowing the Aliens into the pod. The player retrieves the artifact and sends a signal to other Predators who are nine weeks away. The Predator is then killed by the Alien embryo bursting through his ribcage.\n\n====Predalien====\nThe Predalien character's story also begins 500 years earlier. The player begins by controlling a facehugger, exploring the Alien hive and Predator camp in search of a host. The facehugger attacks the Predator, but both become trapped in the stasis field. The game then shifts forward five hundred years to the chestburster emerging from the Predator inside Pod 5. The creature is an Alien/Predator hybrid, called the \"Predalien\" in the game, and the player controls it and searches for food until it grows into an adult.

This enables a member who desires to do so to pattern his opening play after a famous player.\n*Guess-the-Move is a chess training tool where members play through a database game and try to predict the following move, receiving points for correctly choosing those moves actually played.\n*The ChessBookie Game is a free gambling simulation using play money (\"chessbucks\") to predict the outcomes of games in major tournaments. Real time leaderboards track the top predictors.

This enables a member who desires to do so to pattern his opening play after a famous player.\n*Guess-the-Move is a chess training tool where members play through a database game and try to predict the following move, receiving points for correctly choosing those moves actually played.\n*The ChessBookie Game is a free gambling simulation using play money (\"chessbucks\") to predict the outcomes of games in major tournaments. Real time leaderboards track the top predictors. Winners receive various prizes, such as site memberships, gift certificates, chess books and supplies.\n\n==Criticism==\nIn 2013, [[Chesscafe.com]] columnist and chess historian [[Olimpiu G.

Serializability is a property of a transaction [[Schedule (computer science)|schedule]] (history). It relates to the ''[[Isolation (database systems)|isolation]]'' property of a [[database transaction]].\n:'''Serializability''' of a schedule means equivalence (in the outcome, the database state, data values) to a ''serial schedule'' (i.e., sequential with no transaction overlap in time) with the same transactions. It is the major criterion for the correctness of concurrent transactions' schedule, and thus supported in all general purpose database systems.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n:'''The rationale behind serializability''' is the following:\n:If each transaction is correct by itself, i.e., meets certain integrity conditions, then a schedule that comprises any ''serial'' execution of these transactions is correct (its transactions still meet their conditions): \"Serial\" means that transactions do not overlap in time and cannot interfere with each other, i.e, complete ''isolation'' between each other exists. Any order of the transactions is legitimate, if no dependencies among them exist, which is assumed (see comment below). As a result, a schedule that comprises any execution (not necessarily serial) that is equivalent (in its outcome) to any serial execution of these transactions, is correct.\n\nSchedules that are not serializable are likely to generate erroneous outcomes. Well known examples are with transactions that debit and credit accounts with money: If the related schedules are not serializable, then the total sum of money may not be preserved. Money could disappear, or be generated from nowhere. This and violations of possibly needed other [[invariant (computer science)|invariant]] preservations are caused by one transaction writing, and \"stepping on\" and erasing what has been written by another transaction before it has become permanent in the database. It does not happen if serializability is maintained.\n\nIf any specific order between some transactions is requested by an application, then it is enforced independently of the underlying serializability mechanisms. These mechanisms are typically indifferent to any specific order, and generate some unpredictable [[partial order]] that is typically compatible with multiple serial orders of these transactions. This partial order results from the scheduling orders of concurrent transactions' data access operations, which depend on many factors.\n\nA major characteristic of a database transaction is ''[[Atomicity (database systems)|atomicity]]'', which means that it either ''commits'', i.e., all its operations' results take effect in the database, or ''aborts'' (rolled-back), all its operations' results do not have any effect on the database (\"all or nothing\" semantics of a transaction). In all real systems transactions can abort for many reasons, and serializability by itself is not sufficient for correctness. Schedules also need to possess the ''[[Schedule (computer science)#Recoverable|recoverability]]'' (from abort) property. '''Recoverability''' means that committed transactions have not read data written by aborted transactions (whose effects do not exist in the resulting database states). While serializability is currently compromised on purpose in many applications for better performance (only in cases when application's correctness is not harmed), compromising recoverability would quickly violate the database's integrity, as well as that of transactions' results external to the database. A schedule with the recoverability property (a ''recoverable'' schedule) \"recovers\" from aborts by itself, i.e., aborts do not harm the integrity of its committed transactions and resulting database. This is false without recoverability, where the likely integrity violations (resulting incorrect database data) need special, typically manual, corrective actions in the database.\n\nImplementing recoverability in its general form may result in ''cascading aborts'': Aborting one transaction may result in a need to abort a second transaction, and then a third, and so on. This results in a waste of already partially executed transactions, and may result also in a performance penalty. '''[[Avoiding cascading aborts]]''' (ACA, or Cascadelessness) is a special case of recoverability that exactly prevents such phenomena. Often in practice a special case of ACA is utilized: '''[[Schedule (computer science)#Strict|Strictness]]'''. Strictness allows efficient database recovery from failure.\n\nNote that the ''recoverability'' property is needed even if no database failure occurs and no database ''recovery'' from failure is needed. It is, rather, needed to correctly automatically handle aborts, which may be unrelated to database failure and recovery from failure.\n\n===Relaxing serializability===\n\nIn many applications, unlike with finances, absolute correctness is not needed. For example, when retrieving a list of products according to specification, in most cases it does not matter much if a product, whose data was updated a short time ago, does not appear in the list, even if it meets the specification. It will typically appear in such a list when tried again a short time later. Commercial databases provide concurrency control with a whole range of [[isolation (computer science)#Isolation levels|isolation levels]] which are in fact (controlled) serializability violations in order to achieve higher performance. Higher performance means better transaction execution rate and shorter average transaction response time (transaction duration). ''[[Snapshot isolation]]'' is an example of a popular, widely utilized efficient relaxed serializability method with many characteristics of full serializability, but still short of some, and unfit in many situations.\n\nAnother common reason nowadays for [[Serializability#Distributed serializability|distributed serializability]] relaxation (see below) is the requirement of [[availability]] of [[internet]] products and [[Internet service provider|services]]. This requirement is typically answered by large-scale data [[Replication (computer science)|replication]]. The straightforward solution for synchronizing replicas' updates of the same database object is including all these updates in a single atomic [[distributed transaction]]. However, with many replicas such a transaction is very large, and may span enough of a number of several [[computer]]s and [[computer network|networks]] that some of them are likely to be unavailable. Thus such a transaction is likely to end with abort and miss its purpose.<ref name=Gray1996>{{cite conference\n |author     = Gray, J.\n |author2    = Helland, P.\n |author3-link = Patrick O'Neil\n |author3    = O\u2019Neil, P.\n |author4-link = Dennis Shasha\n |author4    = Shasha, D.\n |year       = 1996\n |title      = The dangers of replication and a solution\n |conference = Proceedings of the 1996 [[ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data]]\n |pages      = 173\u2013182\n |url        = ftp://ftp.research.microsoft.com/pub/tr/tr-96-17.pdf\n |doi        = 10.1145/233269.233330\n|author-link = Jim Gray (computer scientist)\n }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\nConsequently, [[Optimistic replication]] (Lazy replication) is often utilized (e.g., in many products and services by [[Google]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Yahoo]], and the like), while serializability is relaxed and compromised for [[eventual consistency]]. Again, in this case, relaxation is done only for applications that are not expected to be harmed by this technique.\n\nClasses of schedules defined by ''relaxed serializability'' properties either contain the serializability class, or are incomparable with it.\n\n==View and conflict serializability ==\n\nMechanisms that enforce serializability need to execute in [[Real-time computing|real time]], or almost in real time, while transactions are running at high rates. In order to meet this requirement, special cases of serializability, sufficient conditions for serializability which can be enforced effectively, are utilized.\n\nTwo major types of serializability exist: ''view-serializability'', and ''conflict-serializability''. View-serializability matches the general definition of serializability given above. Conflict-serializability is a broad special case, i.e., any schedule that is conflict-serializable is also view-serializable, but not necessarily the opposite. Conflict-serializability is widely utilized because it is easier to determine and covers a substantial portion of the view-serializable schedules. Determining view-serializability of a schedule is an [[NP-complete]] problem (a class of problems with only difficult-to-compute, excessively time-consuming known solutions).\n\n:'''View-serializability''' of a schedule is defined by equivalence to a serial schedule (no overlapping transactions) with the same transactions, such that respective transactions in the two schedules read and write the same data values (\"view\" the same data values).\n\n:'''Conflict-serializability''' is defined by equivalence to a serial schedule (no overlapping transactions) with the same transactions, such that both schedules have the same sets of respective chronologically ordered pairs of conflicting operations (same precedence relations of respective conflicting operations).\n\nOperations upon data are ''read'' or ''write'' (a write: either ''insert'' or ''modify'' or ''delete''). Two operations are ''conflicting'' if they are of different transactions, upon the same datum (data item), and at least one of them is ''write''. Each such pair of conflicting operations has a ''conflict type'': it is either a ''read\u2013write'', or ''write\u2013read'', or a ''write\u2013write'' conflict. The transaction of the second operation in the pair is said to be ''in conflict'' with the transaction of the first operation. A more general definition of conflicting operations (also for complex operations, which may each consist of several \"simple\" read/write operations) requires that they are [[noncommutative]] (changing their order also changes their combined result). Each such operation needs to be atomic by itself (using proper system support) in order to be considered an operation for a commutativity check. For example, read\u2013read operations are commutative (unlike read\u2013write and the other possibilities) and thus read\u2013read is not a conflict. Another more complex example: the operations ''increment'' and ''decrement'' of a ''counter'' are both ''write'' operations (both modify the counter), but do not need to be considered conflicting (write-write conflict type) since they are commutative (thus increment\u2013decrement is not a conflict; e.g., already has been supported in the old [[IBM Information Management System|IBM's IMS \"fast path\"]]). Only precedence (time order) in pairs of conflicting (non-commutative) operations is important when checking equivalence to a serial schedule, since different schedules consisting of the same transactions can be transformed from one to another by changing orders between different transactions' operations (different transactions' interleaving), and since changing orders of commutative operations (non-conflicting) does not change an overall operation sequence result, i.e., a schedule outcome (the outcome is preserved through order change between non-conflicting operations, but typically not when conflicting operations change order). This means that if a schedule can be transformed to any serial schedule without changing orders of conflicting operations (but changing orders of non-conflicting, while preserving operation order inside each transaction), then the outcome of both schedules is the same, and the schedule is conflict-serializable by definition.\n\nConflicts are the reason for blocking transactions and delays (non-materialized conflicts), or for aborting transactions due to serializability violation prevention. Both possibilities reduce performance. Thus reducing the number of conflicts, e.g., by commutativity (when possible), is a way to increase performance.\n\nA transaction can issue/request a conflicting operation and be ''in conflict'' with another transaction while its conflicting operation is delayed and not executed (e.g., blocked by a [[Lock (computer science)|lock]]). Only executed (''materialized'') conflicting operations are relevant to ''conflict serializability'' (see more below).\n\n==Enforcing conflict serializability==\n\n===Testing conflict serializability===\n\nSchedule compliance with conflict serializability can be tested with the [[precedence graph]] (''serializability graph'', ''serialization graph'', ''conflict graph'') for committed transactions of the schedule. It is the [[directed graph]] representing precedence of transactions in the schedule, as reflected by precedence of conflicting operations in the transactions.\n\n:In the '''[[precedence graph]]'''  transactions are nodes and precedence relations are directed edges. There exists an edge from a first transaction to a second transaction, if the second transaction is ''in conflict'' with the first (see Conflict serializability above), and the conflict is '''materialized''' (i.e., if the requested conflicting operation is actually executed: in many cases a requested/issued conflicting operation by a transaction is delayed and even never executed, typically by a [[Lock (computer science)|lock]] on the operation's object, held by another transaction, or when writing to a transaction's temporary private workspace and materializing, copying to the database itself, upon commit; as long as a requested/issued conflicting operation is not executed upon the database itself, the conflict is '''non-materialized'''; non-materialized conflicts are not represented by an edge in the precedence graph).\n\n:'''Comment:''' In many text books only ''committed transactions'' are included in the precedence graph. Here all transactions are included for convenience in later discussions.\n\nThe following observation is a '''key characterization of conflict serializability''':\n\n:A schedule is ''conflict-serializable'' [[if and only if]] its precedence graph of ''committed transactions'' (when only ''committed'' transactions are considered) is ''[[directed acyclic graph|acyclic]]''. This means that a cycle consisting of committed transactions only is generated in the (general) precedence graph, if and only if conflict-serializability is violated.\n\nCycles of committed transactions can be prevented by aborting an ''undecided'' (neither committed, nor aborted) transaction on each cycle in the precedence graph of all the transactions, which can otherwise turn into a cycle of committed transactions (and a committed transaction cannot be aborted). One transaction aborted per cycle is both required and sufficient in number to break and eliminate the cycle (more aborts are possible, and can happen under some mechanisms, but are unnecessary for serializability). The probability of cycle generation is typically low, but, nevertheless, such a situation is carefully handled, typically with a considerable amount of overhead, since correctness is involved. Transactions aborted due to serializability violation prevention are ''restarted'' and executed again immediately.\n\nSerializability-enforcing mechanisms typically do not maintain a precedence graph as a data structure, but rather prevent or break cycles implicitly (e.g., SS2PL below).\n\n===Common mechanism\u2009\u2014\u2009SS2PL===\n{{main|Two-phase locking}}\n\n''Strong strict two-phase locking'' (SS2PL) is a common mechanism utilized in database systems since their early days in the 1970s (the \"SS\" in the name SS2PL is newer, though) to enforce both conflict serializability and ''[[Schedule (computer science)#Strict|strictness]]'' (a special case of recoverability which allows effective database recovery from failure) of a schedule. Under this mechanism, each datum is locked by a transaction before its accessing it (in any read or write operation): the item is marked by and associated with a ''[[lock (computer science)|lock]]'' of a certain type depending on the operation being performed (and the specific transaction implementation; various models with different lock types exist; in some models, locks may change type during the transaction's life). As a result, access by another transaction may be blocked, typically upon a conflict (the lock delays or completely prevents the conflict from being materialized and be reflected in the precedence graph by blocking the conflicting operation), depending on lock type and the other transaction's access operation type. Employing an SS2PL mechanism means that all locks on data on behalf of a transaction are released only after the transaction has ended (either committed or aborted).\n\nSS2PL is the name of the resulting schedule property as well, which is also called ''rigorousness''. SS2PL is a special case ([[proper subset]]) of [[Two-phase locking]] (2PL)\n\nMutual blocking between transactions results in a ''deadlock'', where execution of these transactions is stalled and no completion can be reached. Thus deadlocks need to be resolved to complete these transactions' execution and release related computing resources. A deadlock is a reflection of a potential cycle in the precedence graph that would occur without the blocking when conflicts are materialized. A deadlock is resolved by aborting a transaction involved with such a potential cycle and breaking the cycle. It is often detected using a ''[[wait-for graph]]'' (a graph of conflicts blocked by locks from being materialized; it can be also defined as the graph of non-materialized conflicts; conflicts not materialized are not reflected in the precedence graph and do not affect serializability), which indicates which transaction is \"waiting for\" the release of one of more locks by which other transaction or transactions, and a cycle in this graph means a deadlock. Aborting one transaction per cycle is sufficient to break the cycle. Transactions aborted due to deadlock resolution are ''restarted'' and executed again immediately.\n\n===Other enforcing techniques===\n\nOther known mechanisms include:\n* [[Precedence graph]] (or Serializability graph, Conflict graph) cycle elimination\n* [[Two-phase locking]] (2PL)\n* [[Timestamp-based concurrency control|Timestamp ordering]] (TO)\n* [[Snapshot isolation#Making Snapshot Isolation Serializable|Serializable snapshot isolation]]<ref name=Cahill08>Michael J. Cahill, Uwe R\u00f6hm, Alan D. Fekete (2008): [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1376690  \"Serializable isolation for snapshot databases\"], ''Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data'', pp. 729-738, Vancouver, Canada, June 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-60558-102-6}} (SIGMOD 2008 best paper award)</ref> (SerializableSI)\n\nThe above (conflict) serializability techniques in their general form do not provide recoverability. Special enhancements are needed for adding recoverability.\n\n====Optimistic versus pessimistic techniques====\n\nConcurrency control techniques are of three major types:\n# ''Pessimistic'': In Pessimistic concurrency control, a transaction blocks the data access operations of other transactions upon conflicts, and conflicts are ''non-materialized'' until blocking is removed. This is done to ensure that operations that may violate serializability (and in practice also recoverability) do not occur.\n# ''Optimistic'': In [[Optimistic concurrency control]], the data access operations of other transactions are not blocked upon conflicts, and conflicts are immediately ''materialized''. When the transaction reaches the ''ready'' state, i.e., its ''running'' state has been completed, possible serializability (and in practice also recoverability) violation by the transaction's operations (relative to other running transactions) is checked: if violation has occurred, the transaction is typically ''aborted'' (sometimes aborting ''another'' transaction to handle serializability violation is preferred). Otherwise, it is ''committed''.\n# ''Semi-optimistic'': Mechanisms that mix blocking in certain situations with not blocking in other situations and employ both materialized and non-materialized conflicts\n\nThe main differences between the technique types is the conflict types that are generated by them. A pessimistic method blocks a transaction operation upon conflict and generates a non-materialized conflict, while an optimistic method does not block and generates a materialized conflict. A semi-optimistic method generates both conflict types. Both conflict types are generated by the chronological orders in which transaction operations are invoked, independently of the type of conflict. A cycle of committed transactions (with materialized conflicts) in the ''[[precedence graph]]'' (conflict graph) represents a serializability violation, and should be avoided for maintaining serializability. A cycle of (non-materialized) conflicts in the ''[[wait-for graph]]'' represents a deadlock situation, which should be resolved by breaking the cycle. Both cycle types result from conflicts and should be broken. Under any technique type, conflicts should be detected and considered, with similar overhead for both materialized and non-materialized conflicts (typically by using mechanisms like locking, while either blocking for locks or not blocking but recording conflict for materialized conflicts). In a blocking method, typically a [[context switch]]ing occurs upon conflict, with (additional) incurred overhead. Otherwise, blocked transactions' related computing resources remain idle, unutilized, which may be a worse alternative. When conflicts do not occur frequently, optimistic methods typically have an advantage. With different transaction loads (mixes of transaction types) one technique type (i.e., either optimistic or pessimistic) may provide better performance than the other.\n\nUnless schedule classes are ''inherently blocking'' (i.e., they cannot be implemented without data-access operations blocking; e.g., 2PL, SS2PL and SCO above; see chart), they can also be implemented using optimistic techniques (e.g., Serializability, Recoverability).\n\n====Serializable multi-version concurrency control====\n\n:See also [[Multiversion concurrency control]] (partial coverage) and [[Snapshot isolation#Serializable Snapshot Isolation|Serializable Snapshot Isolation]] in [[Snapshot isolation]]\n\n'''Multi-version concurrency control''' (MVCC) is a common way today to increase concurrency and performance by generating a new version of a database object each time the object is written and allowing transactions' read operations of several last relevant versions (of each object), depending on scheduling method. MVCC can be combined with all the serializability techniques listed above (except SerializableSI, which is originally MVCC-based). It is utilized in most general-purpose DBMS products.\n\nMVCC is especially popular nowadays through the ''relaxed serializability'' (see above) method ''[[Snapshot isolation]]'' (SI) which provides better performance than most known serializability mechanisms (at the cost of possible serializability violation in certain cases). [[Snapshot isolation#Making Snapshot Isolation Serializable|SerializableSI]], which is an efficient enhancement of SI to make it serializable, is intended to provide an efficient serializable solution. [[Snapshot isolation#Making Snapshot Isolation Serializable|SerializableSI has been analyzed]]<ref name=Cahill08/><ref name=fekete2009>Alan Fekete (2009), [http://www.it.usyd.edu.au/~fekete/teaching/serializableSI-Fekete.pdf \"Snapshot Isolation and Serializable Execution\"], Presentation, Page 4, 2009, The university of Sydney (Australia). Retrieved 16 September 2009</ref> via a general theory of MVCC\n\n==Distributed serializability==\n\n===Overview===\n\n'''Distributed serializability''' is the serializability of a schedule of a transactional [[distributed system]] (e.g., a [[distributed database]] system). Such a system is characterized by ''[[distributed transaction]]s'' (also called ''global transactions''), i.e., transactions that span computer processes (a process abstraction in a general sense, depending on computing environment; e.g., [[operating system]]'s [[Thread (computer science)|thread]]) and possibly network nodes. A distributed transaction comprises more than one of several ''local sub-transactions'' that each has states as described above for a [[Serializability#Database transaction|database transaction]]. A local sub-transaction comprises a single process, or more processes that typically fail together (e.g., in a single [[processor core]]). Distributed transactions imply a need for an [[atomic commit]] protocol to reach consensus among its local sub-transactions on whether to commit or abort. Such protocols can vary from a simple (one-phase) handshake among processes that fail together to more sophisticated protocols, like [[Two-phase commit protocol|two-phase commit]], to handle more complicated cases of failure (e.g., process, node, communication, etc. failure). Distributed serializability is a major goal of [[distributed concurrency control]] for correctness. With the proliferation of the [[Internet]], [[cloud computing]], [[grid computing]], and small, portable, powerful computing devices (e.g., [[smartphone]]s,) the need for effective distributed serializability techniques to ensure correctness in and among distributed applications seems to increase.\n\nDistributed serializability is achieved by implementing distributed versions of the known centralized techniques.<ref name=Bernstein87 /><ref name=Weikum01 /> Typically, all such distributed versions require utilizing conflict information (of either materialized or non-materialized conflicts, or, equivalently, transaction precedence or blocking information; conflict serializability is usually utilized) that is not generated locally, but rather in different processes, and remote locations. Thus information distribution is needed (e.g., precedence relations, lock information, timestamps, or tickets). When the distributed system is of a relatively small scale and message delays across the system are small, the centralized concurrency control methods can be used unchanged while certain processes or nodes in the system manage the related algorithms. However, in a large-scale system (e.g., ''grid'' and ''cloud''), due to the distribution of such information, a substantial performance penalty is typically incurred, even when distributed versions of the methods (vs. the centralized ones) are used, primarily due to computer and communication [[latency (engineering)|latency]]. Also, when such information is distributed, related techniques typically do not scale well. A well-known example with respect to scalability problems is a [[distributed lock manager]], which distributes lock (non-materialized conflict) information across the distributed system to implement locking techniques.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Two-phase locking|Strong strict two-phase locking]] (SS2PL or Rigorousness).\n*[[Snapshot isolation#Making Snapshot Isolation Serializable|Making snapshot isolation serializable]]<ref name=Cahill08 /> in [[Snapshot isolation]].\n*[[Global serializability]], where the ''Global serializability problem'' and its proposed solutions are described.\n* [[Linearizability]], a more general concept in [[concurrent computing]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{more footnotes|date=November 2011}}\n<!--Supposed sources for most of the material about centralized (vs. distributed) serializability:-->\n*[[Phil Bernstein|Philip A.

Serializability is the major correctness criterion for concurrent transactions' executions{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. It is considered the highest level of [[isolation (computer science)|isolation]] between [[Database transaction|transactions]], and plays an essential role in [[concurrency control]]. As such it is supported in all general purpose database systems. ''[[Two-phase locking|Strong strict two-phase locking]]'' (SS2PL) is a popular serializability mechanism utilized in most of the database systems (in various variants) since their early days in the 1970s.\n\n'''Serializability theory''' provides the formal framework to reason about and analyze serializability and its techniques.

Serializability is a property of a transaction [[Schedule (computer science)|schedule]] (history). It relates to the ''[[Isolation (database systems)|isolation]]'' property of a [[database transaction]].\n:'''Serializability''' of a schedule means equivalence (in the outcome, the database state, data values) to a ''serial schedule'' (i.e., sequential with no transaction overlap in time) with the same transactions. It is the major criterion for the correctness of concurrent transactions' schedule, and thus supported in all general purpose database systems.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n:'''The rationale behind serializability''' is the following:\n:If each transaction is correct by itself, i.e., meets certain integrity conditions, then a schedule that comprises any ''serial'' execution of these transactions is correct (its transactions still meet their conditions): \"Serial\" means that transactions do not overlap in time and cannot interfere with each other, i.e, complete ''isolation'' between each other exists. Any order of the transactions is legitimate, if no dependencies among them exist, which is assumed (see comment below). As a result, a schedule that comprises any execution (not necessarily serial) that is equivalent (in its outcome) to any serial execution of these transactions, is correct.\n\nSchedules that are not serializable are likely to generate erroneous outcomes. Well known examples are with transactions that debit and credit accounts with money: If the related schedules are not serializable, then the total sum of money may not be preserved. Money could disappear, or be generated from nowhere. This and violations of possibly needed other [[invariant (computer science)|invariant]] preservations are caused by one transaction writing, and \"stepping on\" and erasing what has been written by another transaction before it has become permanent in the database. It does not happen if serializability is maintained.\n\nIf any specific order between some transactions is requested by an application, then it is enforced independently of the underlying serializability mechanisms. These mechanisms are typically indifferent to any specific order, and generate some unpredictable [[partial order]] that is typically compatible with multiple serial orders of these transactions. This partial order results from the scheduling orders of concurrent transactions' data access operations, which depend on many factors.\n\nA major characteristic of a database transaction is ''[[Atomicity (database systems)|atomicity]]'', which means that it either ''commits'', i.e., all its operations' results take effect in the database, or ''aborts'' (rolled-back), all its operations' results do not have any effect on the database (\"all or nothing\" semantics of a transaction). In all real systems transactions can abort for many reasons, and serializability by itself is not sufficient for correctness. Schedules also need to possess the ''[[Schedule (computer science)#Recoverable|recoverability]]'' (from abort) property. '''Recoverability''' means that committed transactions have not read data written by aborted transactions (whose effects do not exist in the resulting database states). While serializability is currently compromised on purpose in many applications for better performance (only in cases when application's correctness is not harmed), compromising recoverability would quickly violate the database's integrity, as well as that of transactions' results external to the database. A schedule with the recoverability property (a ''recoverable'' schedule) \"recovers\" from aborts by itself, i.e., aborts do not harm the integrity of its committed transactions and resulting database. This is false without recoverability, where the likely integrity violations (resulting incorrect database data) need special, typically manual, corrective actions in the database.\n\nImplementing recoverability in its general form may result in ''cascading aborts'': Aborting one transaction may result in a need to abort a second transaction, and then a third, and so on. This results in a waste of already partially executed transactions, and may result also in a performance penalty. '''[[Avoiding cascading aborts]]''' (ACA, or Cascadelessness) is a special case of recoverability that exactly prevents such phenomena. Often in practice a special case of ACA is utilized: '''[[Schedule (computer science)#Strict|Strictness]]'''. Strictness allows efficient database recovery from failure.\n\nNote that the ''recoverability'' property is needed even if no database failure occurs and no database ''recovery'' from failure is needed. It is, rather, needed to correctly automatically handle aborts, which may be unrelated to database failure and recovery from failure.\n\n===Relaxing serializability===\n\nIn many applications, unlike with finances, absolute correctness is not needed. For example, when retrieving a list of products according to specification, in most cases it does not matter much if a product, whose data was updated a short time ago, does not appear in the list, even if it meets the specification. It will typically appear in such a list when tried again a short time later. Commercial databases provide concurrency control with a whole range of [[isolation (computer science)#Isolation levels|isolation levels]] which are in fact (controlled) serializability violations in order to achieve higher performance. Higher performance means better transaction execution rate and shorter average transaction response time (transaction duration). ''[[Snapshot isolation]]'' is an example of a popular, widely utilized efficient relaxed serializability method with many characteristics of full serializability, but still short of some, and unfit in many situations.\n\nAnother common reason nowadays for [[Serializability#Distributed serializability|distributed serializability]] relaxation (see below) is the requirement of [[availability]] of [[internet]] products and [[Internet service provider|services]]. This requirement is typically answered by large-scale data [[Replication (computer science)|replication]]. The straightforward solution for synchronizing replicas' updates of the same database object is including all these updates in a single atomic [[distributed transaction]]. However, with many replicas such a transaction is very large, and may span enough of a number of several [[computer]]s and [[computer network|networks]] that some of them are likely to be unavailable. Thus such a transaction is likely to end with abort and miss its purpose.<ref name=Gray1996>{{cite conference\n |author     = Gray, J.\n |author2    = Helland, P.\n |author3-link = Patrick O'Neil\n |author3    = O\u2019Neil, P.\n |author4-link = Dennis Shasha\n |author4    = Shasha, D.\n |year       = 1996\n |title      = The dangers of replication and a solution\n |conference = Proceedings of the 1996 [[ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data]]\n |pages      = 173\u2013182\n |url        = ftp://ftp.research.microsoft.com/pub/tr/tr-96-17.pdf\n |doi        = 10.1145/233269.233330\n|author-link = Jim Gray (computer scientist)\n }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\nConsequently, [[Optimistic replication]] (Lazy replication) is often utilized (e.g., in many products and services by [[Google]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Yahoo]], and the like), while serializability is relaxed and compromised for [[eventual consistency]]. Again, in this case, relaxation is done only for applications that are not expected to be harmed by this technique.\n\nClasses of schedules defined by ''relaxed serializability'' properties either contain the serializability class, or are incomparable with it.\n\n==View and conflict serializability ==\n\nMechanisms that enforce serializability need to execute in [[Real-time computing|real time]], or almost in real time, while transactions are running at high rates. In order to meet this requirement, special cases of serializability, sufficient conditions for serializability which can be enforced effectively, are utilized.\n\nTwo major types of serializability exist: ''view-serializability'', and ''conflict-serializability''. View-serializability matches the general definition of serializability given above. Conflict-serializability is a broad special case, i.e., any schedule that is conflict-serializable is also view-serializable, but not necessarily the opposite. Conflict-serializability is widely utilized because it is easier to determine and covers a substantial portion of the view-serializable schedules. Determining view-serializability of a schedule is an [[NP-complete]] problem (a class of problems with only difficult-to-compute, excessively time-consuming known solutions).\n\n:'''View-serializability''' of a schedule is defined by equivalence to a serial schedule (no overlapping transactions) with the same transactions, such that respective transactions in the two schedules read and write the same data values (\"view\" the same data values).\n\n:'''Conflict-serializability''' is defined by equivalence to a serial schedule (no overlapping transactions) with the same transactions, such that both schedules have the same sets of respective chronologically ordered pairs of conflicting operations (same precedence relations of respective conflicting operations).\n\nOperations upon data are ''read'' or ''write'' (a write: either ''insert'' or ''modify'' or ''delete''). Two operations are ''conflicting'' if they are of different transactions, upon the same datum (data item), and at least one of them is ''write''. Each such pair of conflicting operations has a ''conflict type'': It is either a ''read-write'', or ''write-read'', or a ''write-write'' conflict. The transaction of the second operation in the pair is said to be ''in conflict'' with the transaction of the first operation. A more general definition of conflicting operations (also for complex operations, which may each consist of several \"simple\" read/write operations) requires that they are [[noncommutative]] (changing their order also changes their combined result). Each such operation needs to be atomic by itself (using proper system support) in order to be considered an operation for a commutativity check. For example, read-read operations are commutative (unlike read-write and the other possibilities) and thus read-read is not a conflict. Another more complex example: the operations ''increment'' and ''decrement'' of a ''counter'' are both ''write'' operations (both modify the counter), but do not need to be considered conflicting (write-write conflict type) since they are commutative (thus increment-decrement is not a conflict; e.g., already has been supported in the old [[IBM Information Management System|IBM's IMS \"fast path\"]]). Only precedence (time order) in pairs of conflicting (non-commutative) operations is important when checking equivalence to a serial schedule, since different schedules consisting of the same transactions can be transformed from one to another by changing orders between different transactions' operations (different transactions' interleaving), and since changing orders of commutative operations (non-conflicting) does not change an overall operation sequence result, i.e., a schedule outcome (the outcome is preserved through order change between non-conflicting operations, but typically not when conflicting operations change order). This means that if a schedule can be transformed to any serial schedule without changing orders of conflicting operations (but changing orders of non-conflicting, while preserving operation order inside each transaction), then the outcome of both schedules is the same, and the schedule is conflict-serializable by definition.\n\nConflicts are the reason for blocking transactions and delays (non-materialized conflicts), or for aborting transactions due to serializability violation prevention. Both possibilities reduce performance. Thus reducing the number of conflicts, e.g., by commutativity (when possible), is a way to increase performance.\n\nA transaction can issue/request a conflicting operation and be ''in conflict'' with another transaction while its conflicting operation is delayed and not executed (e.g., blocked by a [[Lock (computer science)|lock]]). Only executed (''materialized'') conflicting operations are relevant to ''conflict serializability'' (see more below).\n\n==Enforcing conflict serializability==\n\n===Testing conflict serializability===\n\nSchedule compliance with conflict serializability can be tested with the [[precedence graph]] (''serializability graph'', ''serialization graph'', ''conflict graph'') for committed transactions of the schedule. It is the [[directed graph]] representing precedence of transactions in the schedule, as reflected by precedence of conflicting operations in the transactions.\n\n:In the '''[[precedence graph]]'''  transactions are nodes and precedence relations are directed edges. There exists an edge from a first transaction to a second transaction, if the second transaction is ''in conflict'' with the first (see Conflict serializability above), and the conflict is '''materialized''' (i.e., if the requested conflicting operation is actually executed: in many cases a requested/issued conflicting operation by a transaction is delayed and even never executed, typically by a [[Lock (computer science)|lock]] on the operation's object, held by another transaction, or when writing to a transaction's temporary private workspace and materializing, copying to the database itself, upon commit; as long as a requested/issued conflicting operation is not executed upon the database itself, the conflict is '''non-materialized'''; non-materialized conflicts are not represented by an edge in the precedence graph).\n\n:'''Comment:''' In many text books only ''committed transactions'' are included in the precedence graph. Here all transactions are included for convenience in later discussions.\n\nThe following observation is a '''key characterization of conflict serializability''':\n\n:A schedule is ''conflict-serializable'' [[if and only if]] its precedence graph of ''committed transactions'' (when only ''committed'' transactions are considered) is ''[[directed acyclic graph|acyclic]]''. This means that a cycle consisting of committed transactions only is generated in the (general) precedence graph, if and only if conflict-serializability is violated.\n\nCycles of committed transactions can be prevented by aborting an ''undecided'' (neither committed, nor aborted) transaction on each cycle in the precedence graph of all the transactions, which can otherwise turn into a cycle of committed transactions (and a committed transaction cannot be aborted). One transaction aborted per cycle is both required and sufficient in number to break and eliminate the cycle (more aborts are possible, and can happen under some mechanisms, but are unnecessary for serializability). The probability of cycle generation is typically low, but, nevertheless, such a situation is carefully handled, typically with a considerable amount of overhead, since correctness is involved. Transactions aborted due to serializability violation prevention are ''restarted'' and executed again immediately.\n\nSerializability-enforcing mechanisms typically do not maintain a precedence graph as a data structure, but rather prevent or break cycles implicitly (e.g., SS2PL below).\n\n===Common mechanism\u2009\u2014\u2009SS2PL===\n{{main|Two-phase locking}}\n\n''Strong strict two-phase locking'' (SS2PL) is a common mechanism utilized in database systems since their early days in the 1970s (the \"SS\" in the name SS2PL is newer, though) to enforce both conflict serializability and ''[[Schedule (computer science)#Strict|strictness]]'' (a special case of recoverability which allows effective database recovery from failure) of a schedule. Under this mechanism, each datum is locked by a transaction before its accessing it (in any read or write operation): the item is marked by and associated with a ''[[lock (computer science)|lock]]'' of a certain type depending on the operation being performed (and the specific transaction implementation; various models with different lock types exist; in some models, locks may change type during the transaction's life). As a result, access by another transaction may be blocked, typically upon a conflict (the lock delays or completely prevents the conflict from being materialized and be reflected in the precedence graph by blocking the conflicting operation), depending on lock type and the other transaction's access operation type. Employing an SS2PL mechanism means that all locks on data on behalf of a transaction are released only after the transaction has ended (either committed or aborted).\n\nSS2PL is the name of the resulting schedule property as well, which is also called ''rigorousness''. SS2PL is a special case ([[proper subset]]) of [[Two-phase locking]] (2PL)\n\nMutual blocking between transactions results in a ''deadlock'', where execution of these transactions is stalled and no completion can be reached. Thus deadlocks need to be resolved to complete these transactions' execution and release related computing resources. A deadlock is a reflection of a potential cycle in the precedence graph that would occur without the blocking when conflicts are materialized. A deadlock is resolved by aborting a transaction involved with such a potential cycle and breaking the cycle. It is often detected using a ''[[wait-for graph]]'' (a graph of conflicts blocked by locks from being materialized; it can be also defined as the graph of non-materialized conflicts; conflicts not materialized are not reflected in the precedence graph and do not affect serializability), which indicates which transaction is \"waiting for\" the release of one of more locks by which other transaction or transactions, and a cycle in this graph means a deadlock. Aborting one transaction per cycle is sufficient to break the cycle. Transactions aborted due to deadlock resolution are ''restarted'' and executed again immediately.\n\n===Other enforcing techniques===\n\nOther known mechanisms include:\n* [[Precedence graph]] (or Serializability graph, Conflict graph) cycle elimination\n* [[Two-phase locking]] (2PL)\n* [[Timestamp-based concurrency control|Timestamp ordering]] (TO)\n* [[Snapshot isolation#Making Snapshot Isolation Serializable|Serializable snapshot isolation]]<ref name=Cahill08>Michael J.

Special enhancements are needed for adding recoverability.\n\n====Optimistic versus pessimistic techniques====\n\nConcurrency control techniques are of three major types:\n# ''Pessimistic'': In Pessimistic concurrency control, a transaction blocks the data access operations of other transactions upon conflicts, and conflicts are ''non-materialized'' until blocking is removed. This is done to ensure that operations that may violate serializability (and in practice also recoverability) do not occur.\n# ''Optimistic'': In [[Optimistic concurrency control]], the data access operations of other transactions are not blocked upon conflicts, and conflicts are immediately ''materialized''. When the transaction reaches the ''ready'' state, i.e., its ''running'' state has been completed, possible serializability (and in practice also recoverability) violation by the transaction's operations (relative to other running transactions) is checked: if violation has occurred, the transaction is typically ''aborted'' (sometimes aborting ''another'' transaction to handle serializability violation is preferred). Otherwise, it is ''committed''.\n# ''Semi-optimistic'': Mechanisms that mix blocking in certain situations with not blocking in other situations and employ both materialized and non-materialized conflicts\n\nThe main differences between the technique types is the conflict types that are generated by them. A pessimistic method blocks a transaction operation upon conflict and generates a non-materialized conflict, while an optimistic method does not block and generates a materialized conflict. A semi-optimistic method generates both conflict types. Both conflict types are generated by the chronological orders in which transaction operations are invoked, independently of the type of conflict. A cycle of committed transactions (with materialized conflicts) in the ''[[precedence graph]]'' (conflict graph) represents a serializability violation, and should be avoided for maintaining serializability. A cycle of (non-materialized) conflicts in the ''[[wait-for graph]]'' represents a deadlock situation, which should be resolved by breaking the cycle. Both cycle types result from conflicts and should be broken. Under any technique type, conflicts should be detected and considered, with similar overhead for both materialized and non-materialized conflicts (typically by using mechanisms like locking, while either blocking for locks or not blocking but recording conflict for materialized conflicts). In a blocking method, typically a [[context switch]]ing occurs upon conflict, with (additional) incurred overhead. Otherwise, blocked transactions' related computing resources remain idle, unutilized, which may be a worse alternative. When conflicts do not occur frequently, optimistic methods typically have an advantage. With different transaction loads (mixes of transaction types) one technique type (i.e., either optimistic or pessimistic) may provide better performance than the other.\n\nUnless schedule classes are ''inherently blocking'' (i.e., they cannot be implemented without data-access operations blocking; e.g., 2PL, SS2PL and SCO above; see chart), they can also be implemented using optimistic techniques (e.g., Serializability, Recoverability).\n\n====Serializable multi-version concurrency control====\n\n:See also [[Multiversion concurrency control]] (partial coverage) and [[Snapshot isolation#Serializable Snapshot Isolation|Serializable Snapshot Isolation]] in [[Snapshot isolation]]\n\n'''Multi-version concurrency control''' (MVCC) is a common way today to increase concurrency and performance by generating a new version of a database object each time the object is written and allowing transactions' read operations of several last relevant versions (of each object), depending on scheduling method. MVCC can be combined with all the serializability techniques listed above (except SerializableSI, which is originally MVCC-based). It is utilized in most general-purpose DBMS products.\n\nMVCC is especially popular nowadays through the ''relaxed serializability'' (see above) method ''[[Snapshot isolation]]'' (SI) which provides better performance than most known serializability mechanisms (at the cost of possible serializability violation in certain cases). [[Snapshot isolation#Making Snapshot Isolation Serializable|SerializableSI]], which is an efficient enhancement of SI to make it serializable, is intended to provide an efficient serializable solution. [[Snapshot isolation#Making Snapshot Isolation Serializable|SerializableSI has been analyzed]]<ref name=Cahill08/><ref name=fekete2009>Alan Fekete (2009), [http://www.it.usyd.edu.au/~fekete/teaching/serializableSI-Fekete.pdf \"Snapshot Isolation and Serializable Execution\"], Presentation, Page 4, 2009, The university of Sydney (Australia). Retrieved 16 September 2009</ref> via a general theory of MVCC\n\n==Distributed serializability==\n\n===Overview===\n\n'''Distributed serializability''' is the serializability of a schedule of a transactional [[distributed system]] (e.g., a [[distributed database]] system). Such a system is characterized by ''[[distributed transaction]]s'' (also called ''global transactions''), i.e., transactions that span computer processes (a process abstraction in a general sense, depending on computing environment; e.g., [[operating system]]'s [[Thread (computer science)|thread]]) and possibly network nodes. A distributed transaction comprises more than one of several ''local sub-transactions'' that each has states as described above for a [[Serializability#Database transaction|database transaction]]. A local sub-transaction comprises a single process, or more processes that typically fail together (e.g., in a single [[processor core]]). Distributed transactions imply a need for an [[atomic commit]] protocol to reach consensus among its local sub-transactions on whether to commit or abort. Such protocols can vary from a simple (one-phase) handshake among processes that fail together to more sophisticated protocols, like [[Two-phase commit protocol|two-phase commit]], to handle more complicated cases of failure (e.g., process, node, communication, etc. failure). Distributed serializability is a major goal of [[distributed concurrency control]] for correctness. With the proliferation of the [[Internet]], [[cloud computing]], [[grid computing]], and small, portable, powerful computing devices (e.g., [[smartphone]]s,) the need for effective distributed serializability techniques to ensure correctness in and among distributed applications seems to increase.\n\nDistributed serializability is achieved by implementing distributed versions of the known centralized techniques.<ref name=Bernstein87 /><ref name=Weikum01 /> Typically, all such distributed versions require utilizing conflict information (of either materialized or non-materialized conflicts, or, equivalently, transaction precedence or blocking information; conflict serializability is usually utilized) that is not generated locally, but rather in different processes, and remote locations. Thus information distribution is needed (e.g., precedence relations, lock information, timestamps, or tickets). When the distributed system is of a relatively small scale and message delays across the system are small, the centralized concurrency control methods can be used unchanged while certain processes or nodes in the system manage the related algorithms. However, in a large-scale system (e.g., ''grid'' and ''cloud''), due to the distribution of such information, a substantial performance penalty is typically incurred, even when distributed versions of the methods (vs. the centralized ones) are used, primarily due to computer and communication [[latency (engineering)|latency]]. Also, when such information is distributed, related techniques typically do not scale well. A well-known example with respect to scalability problems is a [[distributed lock manager]], which distributes lock (non-materialized conflict) information across the distributed system to implement locking techniques.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Two-phase locking|Strong strict two-phase locking]] (SS2PL or Rigorousness).\n*[[Snapshot isolation#Making Snapshot Isolation Serializable|Making snapshot isolation serializable]]<ref name=Cahill08 /> in [[Snapshot isolation]].\n*[[Global serializability]], where the ''Global serializability problem'' and its proposed solutions are described.\n* [[Linearizability]], a more general concept in [[concurrent computing]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{more footnotes|date=November 2011}}\n<!--Supposed sources for most of the material about centralized (vs. distributed) serializability:-->\n*[[Phil Bernstein|Philip A.
