In 2012, he was named the centennial poet for New Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|title=Levi Romero|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/levi-romero|publisher=The Poetry Foundation|accessdate=April 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Early life==\nRomero was born in [[Dixon, New Mexico]], located in the [[Embudo Valley]].  He enrolled at [[Espa\u00f1ola Valley High School]] in [[Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico]]. He soon transferred to Pe\u00f1asco High School in [[Penasco, New Mexico]]. Romero ultimately graduated from [[Menaul School|Menaul Boarding School]] in [[Albuquerque]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} After graduating from Menaul, Romero attended the University of New Mexico, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in Architecture in 1994 and Master of Architecture in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/levi-romero|title=Levi Romero|date=December 22, 2017|publisher=Poetry Foundation|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=December 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nRomero has described his upbringing as \"communal,\" noting that the families who inhabited the valley often shared child-rearing duties and other familial responsibilities. Romero's first language was [[New Mexican Spanish]]. He subsequently learned English in elementary school. Romero has stated that though he considers himself [[Chicano]], he prefers the term ''Nuevom\u00e9xicano'', or \"New Mexican.\" Further, the ''[[Manito dialect|manito]]'' dialect, which is central to the region of Northern New Mexico, colors the bulk of the language seen of Romero's work.<ref>{{cite web|title=Levi Romero|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/levi-romero|website=poetryfoundation.org|publisher=The Poetry Foundation|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Poetry==\nRomero writes almost entirely in free-verse form. He writes his poems in both English and Spanish. His first full book of poetry (''In the Gathering of Silence'') was published in 1996. By 2010, Romero continued to write on the side while working as a visiting Research Scholar in the School of Architecture and Planning at UNM.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Poetry of Remembrance: New and Rejected Works|url=http://www.unmpress.com/books.php?ID=11931689408421&Page=book|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe cultural and geographical landscapes of the Embudo Valley influences many of Romero's early and later works.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rootsworld.com/reviews/romero09.shtml|title=Levi Romero \u2013 Poet of Languages, Lowriders, and the People: RootsWorld|last=Rootsworld|website=rootsworld.com|access-date=December 27, 2017}}</ref> A notable example is his poem \"Tres Copas de Chanate Black and Sweet,\" which features characteristics of Romero's hometown and the surrounding area. A portion of the poem reads:\n<blockquote>                                                                                                       \"pickup trucks once danced\n\ninto the Royal Fork restaurant parking lot\n\nfrom Gallup and Farmington\n\nslipping through the honeydew\n\nsweetness of ripening September\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Romero|first1=Levi|title=In the Gathering of Silence|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=0-931122-84-8|pages=4}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nA concept that Romero frequently deals with in his poetry is [[counterculture]], primarily that which exists in the Southwest. The primary counterculture Romero examines is the [[lowrider]] (lowcura in Spanish). The lowrider tradition is known as a cultural marker in not only the Embudo Valley where Romero grew up, but in multiple places across the Southwest. In brief, the [[lowrider]] can be reasonably described as someone who modifies classic cars such that the body of the vehicle rides very close to the ground. Romero considers low-riding as a vehicle through which to express one's identity. This can be seen in the poem \"Wheels,\" which was published in the Gathering of Silence. A particular aspect Romero touches on is the so-called enchantment of the low-ride.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Steinberg|first1=David|title=New book on lowrider culture focuses on colorful cars and their equally colorful owners|url=https://www.abqjournal.com/877771/going-2.html|work=Albuquerque Journal|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref> He writes: \n                                                                                                           <blockquote>\n\"how can I tell you\n\nbaby, oh honey, you'll\n\nnever know the ride\n\nthe ride of a lowered chevy\n\nslithering through the \n                                                                                                                   blue dotted night along\n\nRiverside Drive Espa\u00f1ola.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Romero|first1=Levi|title=In the Gathering of Silence|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=0-931122-84-8|pages=8}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nRomero also derives inspiration from the everyday and the commonplace.

In 2012, he was named the centennial poet for New Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|title=Levi Romero|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/levi-romero|publisher=The Poetry Foundation|accessdate=April 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Early life==\nRomero was born in [[Dixon, New Mexico]], located in the [[Embudo Valley]].  He enrolled at [[Espa\u00f1ola Valley High School]] in [[Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico]]. He soon transferred to Pe\u00f1asco High School in [[Penasco, New Mexico]]. Romero ultimately graduated from [[Menaul School|Menaul Boarding School]] in [[Albuquerque]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} After graduating from Menaul, Romero attended the University of New Mexico, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in Architecture in 1994 and Master of Architecture in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/levi-romero|title=Levi Romero|date=December 22, 2017|publisher=Poetry Foundation|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=December 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nRomero has described his upbringing as \"communal,\" noting that the families who inhabited the valley often shared child-rearing duties and other familial responsibilities. Romero's first language was [[New Mexican Spanish]]. He subsequently learned English in elementary school. Romero has stated that though he considers himself [[Chicano]], he prefers the term ''Nuevom\u00e9xicano'', or \"New Mexican.\" Further, the ''[[Manito dialect|manito]]'' dialect, which is central to the region of Northern New Mexico, colors the bulk of the language seen of Romero's work.<ref>{{cite web|title=Levi Romero|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/levi-romero|website=poetryfoundation.org|publisher=The Poetry Foundation|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Poetry==\nRomero writes almost entirely in free-verse form. He writes his poems in both English and Spanish. His first full book of poetry (''In the Gathering of Silence'') was published in 1996. By 2010, Romero continued to write on the side while working as a visiting Research Scholar in the School of Architecture and Planning at UNM.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Poetry of Remembrance: New and Rejected Works|url=http://www.unmpress.com/books.php?ID=11931689408421&Page=book|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe cultural and geographical landscapes of the Embudo Valley influences many of Romero's early and later works.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rootsworld.com/reviews/romero09.shtml|title=Levi Romero \u2013 Poet of Languages, Lowriders, and the People: RootsWorld|last=Rootsworld|website=rootsworld.com|access-date=December 27, 2017}}</ref> A notable example is his poem \"Tres Copas de Chanate Black and Sweet,\" which features characteristics of Romero's hometown and the surrounding area. A portion of the poem reads:\n<blockquote>                                                                                                       \"pickup trucks once danced\n\ninto the Royal Fork restaurant parking lot\n\nfrom Gallup and Farmington\n\nslipping through the honeydew\n\nsweetness of ripening September\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Romero|first1=Levi|title=In the Gathering of Silence|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=0-931122-84-8|pages=4}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nA concept that Romero frequently deals with in his poetry is [[counterculture]], primarily that which exists in the Southwest. The primary counterculture Romero examines is the [[lowrider]] (lowcura in Spanish). The lowrider tradition is known as a cultural marker in not only the Embudo Valley where Romero grew up, but in multiple places across the Southwest. In brief, the [[lowrider]] can be reasonably described as someone who modifies classic cars such that the body of the vehicle rides very close to the ground. Romero considers low-riding as a vehicle through which to express one's identity. This can be seen in the poem \"Wheels,\" which was published in in the Gathering of Silence. A particular aspect Romero touches on is the so-called enchantment of the low-ride.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Steinberg|first1=David|title=New book on lowrider culture focuses on colorful cars and their equally colorful owners|url=https://www.abqjournal.com/877771/going-2.html|work=Albuquerque Journal|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref> He writes: \n                                                                                                           <blockquote>\n\"how can I tell you\n\nbaby, oh honey, you'll\n\nnever know the ride\n\nthe ride of a lowered chevy\n\nslithering through the \n                                                                                                                   blue dotted night along\n\nRiverside Drive Espa\u00f1ola.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Romero|first1=Levi|title=In the Gathering of Silence|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=0-931122-84-8|pages=8}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nRomero also derives inspiration from the everyday and the commonplace. Many of his poems feature snippets of conversation from strangers or interactions that might otherwise seem unimportant. For example, \"Corner of 5th & Central, featured in ''A Poetry of Remembrance'', takes place on a street corner. Romero writes:\n\n                                                                                                                   <blockquote>\"I am on the corner of 5th & Central\n\nalbuquerque, new mexico\n\nunited states of America\n\nnorthern hemisphere\n\nthe planet is divided up into four quadrants\n\nhow I got started carving?\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Romero|first1=Levi|title=A Poetry of Remembrance|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=978-0-8263-4510-3|pages=105}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n== Documentary work==\nRomero has cultivated an active interest in filmmaking in addition to his poetry.
