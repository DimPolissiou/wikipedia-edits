The name derives from an obscure law known as the ''Jus Devolutionis'', used by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] to claim they 'devolved' to him by right of marriage to [[Maria Theresa of Spain]].\n\nThe French encountered minimal resistance, but Louis was more concerned to assert his inheritance rights in the Spanish Empire, and returned much of his gains in the May 1668 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]]. The terms were agreed by [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]] in January 1668, reinforced by the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] and the [[Dutch Republic]].\n\nThe conflict marked the end of the long-standing Franco-Dutch alliance, and was the first of the French wars of expansion that dominated Europe for the next 50 years.\n\n==Background==\nAs part of the 1659 [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] that ended the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635\u20131659)|Franco-Spanish War]], [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] married [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], eldest daughter of [[Philip IV of Spain]]. Despite being weakened by nearly a century of conflict, the [[Spanish Empire]] remained a huge global confederation. To prevent its acquisition by [[Kingdom of France|France]], Maria Theresa renounced her inheritance rights; in return, Louis was promised a dowry of 500,000 gold [[French \u00e9cu|\u00e9cus]], a huge sum that was never paid.{{sfn|Wolf|1968|p=117}}\n\nWhen [[Cardinal Mazarin]] died in 1661, Louis took control of the state and initiated an expansionist policy.{{sfn|Lynn|1996|p=6}} [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], his Finance Minister, argued French economic growth required the [[Spanish Netherlands]], implying conflict with [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]] and the [[Dutch Republic]], a long-term French ally. The 1648 [[Peace of M\u00fcnster]] that confirmed Dutch independence also gave [[Amsterdam]] control of trade through North-West Europe, by permanently closing the [[Scheldt]] estuary. Retaining this monopoly was a Dutch priority.{{sfn|Israel|1990|pp=197-199}}\n\nBy 1663, Louis concluded the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] would never voluntarily agree to his demands and began plans to seize the Spanish Netherlands, although negotiations continued to avoid raising suspicions.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=3}} As required by the 1662 Franco-Dutch Treaty of Paris, France entered the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in July 1665, providing an excuse for their military build up; Louis also calculated this made it harder for the Dutch to oppose him.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=298}} In September, Philip died, leaving his four year old son [[Charles II of Spain|Charles]] as king, and his widow [[Mariana of Austria]] as regent. If Charles died, Leopold would inherit the Spanish Empire.{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=311-312}}\n[[File:Detail of Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se d'Autriche by Nocret.jpg|thumb|left|[[Maria Theresa of Spain]], whose unpaid dowry was used to justify the war]]\nFrench lawyers argued as the dowry remained unpaid, Maria Theresa's renunciation was invalid, and her rights \"devolved\" to Louis under the ''Jus Devolutionis'', an obscure law restricting inheritance to children from a first marriage. On this basis, he claimed most of the Spanish Netherlands, including [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]], the towns of [[Cambrai]], Antwerp and [[Mechelen]], [[Upper Guelders]], the counties of [[County of Namur|Namur]], [[County of Artois|Artois]] and [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], and related possessions.{{sfn|Wolf|1962|p=316}} It was dismissed by Leopold and Mariana, since it applied only in Brabant, Namur and Hainault and concerned private property, not feudal rights but gave Louis a legal justification.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=33-34}}\n\nAware of French intentions, Mariana's government sought to end the [[Portuguese Restoration War]], agree an alliance with England, and break the Franco-Dutch relationship.

Another 9,000 under [[Aumont family|Antoine de Rochebaron]] prepared to advance up the Lys, via [[Kortrijk]] and [[Oudenaarde]]; [[Fran\u00e7ois de Cr\u00e9quy|de Cr\u00e9quy]] and 6,000 light cavalry were based at [[Sierck-les-Bains]], securing their flank against an attack from Germany.

Despite spending the enormous sum of 1.5 million [[escudos]] on her daughter's wedding, Mariana managed to increase the forces available to him from 11,000 in mid 1666 to 27,000 by April 1667.{{sfn|Mitchell|2019|pp=34-36}}\n\nAlthough insufficient to defend every position, the Spanish did not need to do so. Given time, it was accepted even the strongest fortifications would fall and their primary purpose was to delay, while the defenders mobilised reserves or found a diplomatic solution. Capturing towns was relatively easy, holding them far harder, since every garrison weakened the field army; over the next century, the French confronted this strategic dilemma time and again in this theatre.{{sfn|Afflerbach|Strachan|2012|p=159}}\n[[File:Diksmuide - Polders - IJzer.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Yser]] river, in [[Plain of Flanders|Maritime Flanders]]; a good example of the geography in this area]]\nTurenne's first objective was [[Charleroi]], a key Spanish supply base; Castel Rodrigo could not hold it and withdrew to [[Brussels]], first destroying its fortifications. On 2 June, [[Charles de Montsaulnin, Comte de Montal|De Montal]] was appointed French governor and given a garrison of 3,000, while [[Vauban]] began rebuilding its defences. By the end of July, Rochebaron had captured [[Tournai]], Kortrijk and Oudenaarde; Turenne advanced on [[Dendermonde]], intending to take Antwerp.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=301}}\n\nOn 31 July, peace treaties were signed at Breda and the Dutch began discussions with England and Spain on creating a diplomatic alliance against France. At the same time, Castel Rodrigo opened the water defences, flooding the land and bringing the French advance to a halt.

Ordered to cut off his retreat, [[Bernardin Gigault de Bellefonds|Bellefonds]] and de Cr\u00e9quy inflicted nearly 2,000 casualties; in early 1668, Louis created both [[List of Marshals of France#Louis XIV, 1643\u20131715|Marshals of France]].{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=303}} On 12 September, Turenne captured [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] but although his troops suffered relatively few battle casualties, sickness was a far bigger problem; in early October, campaigning ended for the winter.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=304}}\n\n===Negotiations; winter 1667/1668===\n[[File:Johan de Witt 1652.jpg|thumb|right|[[Johan de Witt]], Dutch [[Grand Pensionary]]; he had to persuade Louis to withdraw, while keeping him as an ally]]\nOn 31 July 1667, the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] ended the Anglo-Dutch War and negotiations began on a common front against France.{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=311}} This was driven by the [[States of Zeeland]], supported by [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|Sir William Temple]], English ambassador in [[the Hague]] and [[Brussels]], and Francois-Paul de Lisola, Leopold's representative in London.{{sfn|Goldie|Levillain|2018|p=5}}\n\nDe Witt summarised the Dutch dilemma as follows; 'to abandon Spain is to make France a present of the Netherlands, to take on her defence alone is folly.'{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=111}} Although he and Charles preferred France, the vast majority of their countrymen did not, which meant they had to satisfy domestic opinion by making Louis retreat, but remain friends. According to the French [[Simon Arnauld, Marquis de Pomponne|ambassador in Sweden]], Charles quickly recognised this was almost impossible, and focused on ensuring Louis blamed De Witt.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=6}}\n\nFrom April 1667 to June 1668, Franco-Dutch trade declined by 30%, due to the imposition of French tariffs.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=155}} Combined with the prospect of France as a neighbour, this led to widespread support for an Anglo-Dutch alliance among [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|Orangists]], the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] and the general populace.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=7}} In England, [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] and [[City of London Corporation|business]] wanted peace, while most preferred Spain for strategic and commercial reasons, including chief minister [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]]; an Anglo-Dutch alliance in support of Spain seemed the ideal solution. Finally, it allowed Charles to keep Parliament happy, while demonstrating Dutch unreliability and thus increasing the price Louis would pay for his support in the [[Secret Treaty of Dover|1670 Treaty of Dover]].{{sfn|Hutton|1986|pp=299-300}} \n\nIn September, De Witt promised to ensure Spain accepted French terms for ending the war, but Louis insisted he commit to enforcing them if needed. When Mariana refused, he persuaded the [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States of Holland]] to pass resolutions on 10 December and 14 January 1668, approving military action against Spain. This was strongly resisted by the other provinces, and the Orangist opposition in Holland.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=4}}\n[[File:Louis-xiv-lebrunl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], ca 1661]]\nWhen Philip died in 1665, Spain's only ally was Leopold; by 1668, their diplomats had built relationships with the Orangists, England, and traditional French supporters like Sweden and Brandenburg. In September 1667, [[Afonso VI of Portugal]] was deposed by his brother [[Peter II of Portugal|Pedro]], who opened discussions on ending the Restoration war.{{sfn|Mitchell|2019|p=47}} The 1667 agreement with France was annulled and on 13 February 1668, Spain recognised Portuguese independence with the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1668)|Treaty of Lisbon]].{{sfn|Newitt|2004|p=228}}\n\nTo fund the 1668 campaign, Castel-Rodrigo agreed a loan of 2 million guilders from the Amsterdam financial markets; as security, the Dutch would be allowed to occupy Bruges, Ostend and Damme. The prospect of peace with Portugal meant Mariana could reject these conditions; she sent Castel-Rodrigo [[Letter of credit|letters of credit]] for 600,000 escudos and one million bars of silver. This allowed him to begin recruiting, while Brandenburg agreed to supply 12,000 troops.{{sfn|Mitchell|2019|pp=50-52}}\n\nOn 20 January, Louis and Leopold signed a Partition Treaty, agreeing the division of the Spanish Empire if Charles of Spain died; this included the terms given to De Witt in September.{{sfn|Davenport| Paullin|1917|p=144,152}} The [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] was signed by England and the Republic on 23 January, the third member, [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], formally joining on 5 May, three days after Aix-la-Chapelle.{{sfn|Davenport| Paullin|1917|p=166}} It contained a pact of mutual defence, an agreement to ensure Spain accepted French terms, and secret clauses, including military action against France if Louis reneged on this promise.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|pp=8-10}}\n\nRuvigny, French ambassador in London, received a copy within days, allegedly from Arlington, which he passed onto Lionne.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=12}} Writing ten years later, largely to justify the subsequent [[Franco-Dutch War]], Louis claimed it was a calculated insult by the 'ungrateful Dutch nation', but his reaction at the time was far more moderate.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|p=23}} The French recognised the military clause was largely unenforceable; as Turenne observed, 'the Dutch have more ill-will than power, the English neither troops or money'.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|p=26}} Lionne also pointed out the Alliance's guarantee applied to both sides, obliging Spain to comply with French terms 'without it costing us a sou.'{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=156}}\n\n===February 1668; the campaign in Franche-Comt\u00e9===\n{{Location map many|France Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9|caption = Modern department of Bourgogne (left) and Franche-Comt\u00e9 (right); key locations 1668 campaign |border = black|width =300|float = right|relief=yes|\n|label  = Besan\u00e7on   |pos = right|lat_deg =47|lat_min  = 14|lon_deg  = 6|lon_min = 1\n|label2 = Dole       |pos2 = right |lat2_deg=47|lat2_min = 05|lon2_deg = 5|lon2_min = 30\n|label3 = Gray       |pos3 = right |lat3_deg=47|lat3_min  =27|lon3_deg = 5|lon3_min = 36\n|label4 = Vesoul     |pos4 = right|lat4_deg=47|lat4_min  =37|lon4_deg = 6|lon4_min = 10\n|label5 = Salins-les-Bains|pos5 = bottom|lat5_deg  =46|lat5_min  =57|lon5_deg  = 5|lon5_min = 53\n|label6  = Dijon     |pos6 = top |lat6_deg  =47|lat6_min=19|lon6_deg = 5|lon6_min = 01\n|label7  = Nevers    |pos7 = right  |lat7_deg  =47|lat7_min=00|lon7_deg = 3|lon7_min = 10\n|label8  = Auxonne   |pos8 = left   |lat8_deg  =47|lat8_min  =12|lon8_deg  = 5|lon8_min = 23\n}}\nThroughout his career, Louis sought to improve his position prior to negotiations; in September, he decided to occupy [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]]. It was almost impossible for Spain to defend, while its governor, the Marquis de Yenne, had fewer than 2,000 men to hold the entire province.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=305}} French armies also benefitted from vastly superior logistics, allowing them to open campaigns before their opponents were ready. The invasion was planned for early February, normally considered impractical for troop movements, adding the factor of surprise to superior numbers.{{sfn|Lynn|1996|p=112}}\n\nThe operation was commanded by the [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9|Prince de Cond\u00e9]]. Once France's leading general, he fought against Louis during the 1648 to 1653 [[Fronde]], then with Spain until 1659; this was his first command since returning from exile in 1660. Franche-Comt\u00e9 was considered part of [[Burgundy]], his family's traditional power base and his selection demonstrated royal control over an area with a long history as an independent state.{{sfn|Swann|2003|p=44}}\n\nTo keep his opponents guessing, Louis announced plans to double the army to 134,000 and leaked details of a proposed 1668 campaign. Led by himself and Turenne, 66,000 men would complete the conquest of the Spanish Netherlands; a subsidiary force under [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe of Orl\u00e9ans]] would attack [[Catalonia]], with Cond\u00e9 in the [[Three Bishoprics]] to deter an attack from Germany.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|pp=20-21}}\n\nThis provided cover for assembling troops and supplies in [[Dijon]]; by early February, Cond\u00e9 had 12,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry concentrated near [[Auxonne]]. He divided the army into two columns, the other led by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], and entered Franche-Comt\u00e9 on 4 February.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=305}} [[Free City of Besan\u00e7on|Besan\u00e7on]] and [[Salins-les-Bains]] surrendered on 7 February, after which Cond\u00e9 and Luxembourg moved onto [[Dole, Jura|Dole]], where they were joined by Louis on 9 February. His presence resulted in a largely unnecessary assault, which cost the French between 400 to 500 casualties, their only significant losses of the campaign. Dole surrendered on 14 February, followed by the provincial capital of [[Gray, Haute-Sa\u00f4ne|Gray]] on 19th; Louis was back in [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|Saint-Germain]] on 24th.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=306}}\n\n===May 1668; Northern Catalonia===\nOn the southern front, the Spanish took the initiative; the [[Gaspar T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n, 5th Duke de Osuna|Duke of Osuna]], [[Viceroy of Catalonia]], invaded the [[Upper Cerdanya]] with 2,300 infantry and 200 cavalry.{{sfn|Espino L\u00f3pez|1997|p=9}} Weak French defences allowed him to capture 55 villages in the region, although irregular local ''[[miquelets]]'' combined with the French military in resisting the invasion.{{sfn|Espino L\u00f3pez|1999|p=266}} Spanish incursions continued until 1669, forcing the French to fortify the border.{{sfn|Jan\u00e9 Checa|2003|p=454}}\n\n===Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle===\nWith the largest army in Europe, Turenne, Cond\u00e9 and Orl\u00e9ans argued for continuing the war. Lionne, Colbert and Le Tellier recommended peace, primarily on financial grounds; the 1660s was a period of significant economic decline, and war was expensive. France was unprepared for a naval war against the Dutch and English, and while Colbert had initiated policies aimed at reducing its dependence on Dutch shipping for transporting goods, this would take time.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=153-154}} In addition to those already contracted with Brandenburg, [[Charles V, Duke of Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]] offered Mariana another 8,000 men. {{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=163}}\n\nIn February, seven year old Charles was reported to be suffering from [[smallpox]], an often fatal disease; his death would give Louis a good chance of achieving his objectives without fighting. The combination decided him on peace; on 25 April, the Treaty of Saint Germain, between France, England and the Republic, finalised terms, which were then incorporated into the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], signed by Spain and France on 2 May.{{sfn|Lesaffer}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Map Peace of Aix la Chapelle (English).png|thumb|left|French gains by Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle: Louis returned [[Cambrai]], [[Aire-sur-la-Lys|Aire]] and [[Saint-Omer]], but retained the rest]]\nFrance withdrew from Franche-Comt\u00e9 and the Spanish Netherlands, with the exception of eleven towns and their surrounding areas. Lille, [[Armenti\u00e8res]], [[Bergues]] and [[Douai]] were considered essential to reinforce France's vulnerable northern border and remain French to this day. The retention of Tournai, Oudenarde, Courtrai, [[Veurne]], [[Binche]], Charleroi and [[Ath]] made future offensives much easier, as demonstrated in 1672.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=165}}\n\nFrom a military perspective, France strengthened its northern border, and [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]] began work on the defence line that became known as the ''Ceinture de fer''. Possession of towns like Charleroi and Tournai facilitated future campaigns through the control of vital routes into the Spanish Netherlands, but they were easily isolated and required expensive garrisons.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|p=31}}\n\nThe political results were mixed; in the Partition Treaty, Leopold recognised Louis' right to inherit part of the Spanish Empire, much to the anger of Spain. However, Louis' expansionist ambitions sparked discussions on an anti-French coalition, culminating in the formation of the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|1689 Grand Alliance]].{{sfn|Young|2004|p=220}}\n\nThe role of the Triple Alliance in the peace is debated by modern historians, including [[Herbert H. Rowen|Herbert Rowen]], \"arguably the most important English-speaking historian of the Dutch Republic since [[John Lothrop Motley]]\".{{sfn|Harline |1999}} Its real significance was aligning English and Dutch objectives, despite the brief interruption in 1672 of the deeply unpopular [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]; the Dutch viewed Aix-la-Chapelle as a diplomatic triumph.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=163-167}}\n\nConcern over French ambitions also revived the Orangist party, increasing internal political conflict with De Witt's Republican faction. One result was the deliberate neglect of the Dutch army, generally seen as bolstering the power of the [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]]; this had catastrophic repercussions in 1672.{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=312-316}}\n\nLouis went to war in 1667 because he believed the Dutch would never voluntarily agree the concessions required.

The name derives from an obscure law known as the ''Jus Devolutionis'', used by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] to claim they 'devolved' to him by right of marriage to [[Maria Theresa of Spain]].\n\nThe French encountered minimal resistance, but Louis was more concerned to assert his inheritance rights in the Spanish Empire, and returned much of his gains in the May 1668 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]]. The terms were agreed by [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]] in January 1668, reinforced by the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] and the [[Dutch Republic]].\n\nThe conflict marked the end of the long-standing Franco-Dutch alliance, and was the first of the French wars of expansion that dominated Europe for the next 50 years.\n\n==Background==\nAs part of the 1659 [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] that ended the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635\u20131659)|Franco-Spanish War]], [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] married [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], eldest daughter of [[Philip IV of Spain]]. Despite being weakened by nearly a century of conflict, the [[Spanish Empire]] remained a huge global confederation. To prevent its acquisition by [[Kingdom of France|France]], Maria Theresa renounced her inheritance rights; in return, Louis was promised a dowry of 500,000 gold [[French \u00e9cu|\u00e9cus]], a huge sum that was never paid.{{sfn|Wolf|1968|p=117}}\n\nWhen [[Cardinal Mazarin]] died in 1661, Louis took control of the state and initiated an expansionist policy.{{sfn|Lynn|1996|p=6}} [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], his Finance Minister, argued French economic growth required the [[Spanish Netherlands]], implying conflict with [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]] and the [[Dutch Republic]], a long-term French ally. The 1648 [[Peace of M\u00fcnster]] that confirmed Dutch independence also gave [[Amsterdam]] control of trade through North-West Europe, by permanently closing the [[Scheldt]] estuary. Retaining this monopoly was a Dutch priority.{{sfn|Israel|1990|pp=197-199}}\n\nBy 1663, Louis concluded the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] would never voluntarily agree to his demands and began plans to seize the Spanish Netherlands, although negotiations continued to avoid raising suspicions.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=3}} As required by the 1662 Franco-Dutch Treaty of Paris, France entered the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in July 1665, providing an excuse for their military build up; Louis also calculated this made it harder for the Dutch to oppose him.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=298}} In September, Philip died, leaving his four year old son [[Charles II of Spain|Charles]] as king, and his widow [[Mariana of Austria]] as regent. If Charles died, Leopold would inherit the Spanish Empire.{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=311-312}}\n[[File:Detail of Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se d'Autriche by Nocret.jpg|thumb|left|[[Maria Theresa of Spain]], whose unpaid dowry was used to justify the war]]\nFrench lawyers argued as the dowry remained unpaid, Maria Theresa's renunciation was invalid, and her rights \"devolved\" to Louis under the ''Jus Devolutionis'', an obscure law restricting inheritance to children from a first marriage. On this basis, he claimed most of the Spanish Netherlands, including [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]], the towns of [[Cambrai]], Antwerp and [[Mechelen]], [[Upper Guelders]], the counties of [[County of Namur|Namur]], [[County of Artois|Artois]] and [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], and related possessions.{{sfn|Wolf|1962|p=316}} It was dismissed by Leopold and Mariana, since it applied only in Brabant, Namur and Hainault and concerned private property, not feudal rights but gave Louis a legal justification.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=33-34}}\n\nAware of French intentions, Mariana's government sought to end the [[Portuguese Restoration War]], agree an alliance with England, and break the Franco-Dutch relationship. Louis countered with the 1667 [[Treaty of Lisbon (1667)|Treaty of Lisbon]], a ten year alliance with Portugal, and paid potential opponents like [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] to remain neutral.{{sfn|Lynn|1996|p=36}} Leopold was occupied with the [[Great Turkish War]], while Foreign Minister [[Hugues de Lionne]] also extended the anti-Austrian [[League of the Rhine]] until 1668.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=95-96}}\n\nOn 8 May, every French ambassador in Europe read out a declaration, claiming Louis was taking possession of lands that rightfully belonged to him. In mid-May, talks to end the Anglo-Dutch War opened in [[Breda]] between the Republic, [[Denmark-Norway]], France and England; shortly before, [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] learned Louis and Charles had secretly agreed terms in advance, increasing the pressure on the Dutch not to oppose French aims.{{sfn|Gooskens|2016|p=69}}\n\nThe imminence of war ended Spain's reluctance to accept Portuguese sovereignty; the Anglo-Spanish [[Treaty of Madrid (1667)|Treaty of Madrid]], signed on 23 May, granted England substantial commercial privileges, in return for help in ending the war with Portugal.{{sfn|Fisher|Savelle|1967|pp=66-70}}\n\n==War==\n===May to September 1667; the Spanish Netherlands===\n{{Location map many|Belgium|caption = The Spanish Netherlands, 1667 campaign; note modern Franco-Belgian boundary, blue lines indicate rivers|relief=yes|border = black| width = 300| float = right\n|label = Oudenaarde|pos=right  |lat_deg=50|lat_min =51|lon_deg = 3|lon_min = 36\n|label3 =Antwerp |pos3= top|lat3_deg=51|lat3_min = 13|lon3_deg = 4|lon3_min = 24\n|label4 =Tournai |pos4=right|lat4_deg=50|lat4_min = 36|lon4_deg = 3|lon4_min = 23\n|label5= Charleroi|pos5=bottom|lat5_deg=50|lat5_min = 24|lon5_deg = 4|lon5_min = 26\n|label6 = Lille  |pos6=left|lat6_deg=50|lat6_min =38 |lon6_deg = 3 |lon6_min = 03\n|label7= Namur|pos7 = right|lat7_deg = 50|lat7_min = 28| lon7_deg = 4|lon7_min = 52\n|label8 = Maastricht|pos8 = right|lat8_deg = 50 | lat8_min = 51 | lon8_deg = 5 | lon8_min = 41\n|label9 = M\u00e9zi\u00e8res|pos9 = left|lat9_deg = 49 | lat9_min =46 | lon9_deg =4 | lon9_min = 43\n|label10 = Sierck|pos10 = bottom|lat10_deg = 49 | lat10_min =26 | lon10_deg =6 | lon10_min = 21\n|label11 = Kortrijk|pos11 = left|lat11_deg=50|lat11_min=50|lon11_deg =3 | lon11_min = 16\n|label12 = Brussels|pos12 = right|lat12_deg=50|lat12_min=41|lon12_deg =4 | lon12_min = 21\n|label13 = Dendermonde|pos13 = left|lat13_deg=51|lat13_min=02|lon13_deg =4 | lon13_min = 06\n|label14 = Aalst|pos14 = right|lat14_deg=50|lat14_min=56|lon14_deg =4 |lon14_min = 02\n}}\nAlso referred to as [[Flanders]], the Spanish Netherlands was a compact area, dominated by canals and rivers. Until the advent of railways in the 19th century, goods and supplies were largely transported by water; campaigns in this theatre focused on control of strongpoints along rivers such as the [[Lys (river)|Lys]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse]].{{sfn|Childs|1991|pp=32-33}}\n\nAfter 1659, a series of military reforms initiated by [[Michel Le Tellier]] made the French army more professional, while improving its logistic support.{{sfn|Rowlands|2010|p=147}} This allowed them to put larger numbers in the field, for longer periods; by 1667, the army had an authorised strength of 80,000, of whom 51,000 were deployed for the campaign.{{sfn|Lynn|1996|p=106}}\n\n[[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]] was appointed supreme commander; his main force of 35,000 men and the artillery train were concentrated around [[Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res|M\u00e9zi\u00e8res]], on the River Meuse. Another 9,000 under [[Aumont family|Antoine de Rochebaron]] prepared to advance up the Lys, via [[Kortrijk]] and [[Oudenaarde]]; [[Fran\u00e7ois de Cr\u00e9quy|de Cr\u00e9quy]] and 6,000 light cavalry were based at [[Sierck-les-Bains]], securing their flank against an attack from Germany. Accompanied by Louis and his entourage, the French crossed the border on 24 May.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|pp=299-300}}\n\nAware of these preparations, Spanish governor [[Francisco de Moura, 3rd Marquis of Castel Rodrigo|Castel Rodrigo]] urgently requested additional funds from Madrid. Despite spending the enormous sum of 1.5 million [[escudos]] on her daughter's wedding, Mariana managed to increase the forces available to him from 11,000 in mid 1666 to 27,000 by April 1667.{{sfn|Mitchell|2019|pp=34-36}}\n\nAlthough insufficient to defend every position, the Spanish did not need to do so. Given time, it was accepted even the strongest fortifications would fall and their primary purpose was to delay, while the defenders mobilised reserves or found a diplomatic solution. Capturing towns was relatively easy, holding them far harder, since every garrison weakened the field army; over the next century, the French confronted this strategic dilemma time and again in this theatre.{{sfn|Afflerbach|Strachan|2012|p=159}}\n[[File:Diksmuide - Polders - IJzer.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Yser]] river, in [[Plain of Flanders|Maritime Flanders]]; a good example of the geography in this area]]\nTurenne's first objective was [[Charleroi]], a key Spanish supply base; Castel Rodrigo could not hold it and withdrew to [[Brussels]], first destroying its fortifications. On 2 June, [[Charles de Montsaulnin, Comte de Montal|De Montal]] was appointed French governor and given a garrison of 3,000, while [[Vauban]] began rebuilding its defences. By the end of July, Rochebaron had captured [[Tournai]], Kortrijk and Oudenaarde; Turenne advanced on [[Dendermonde]], intending to take Antwerp.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=301}}\n\nOn 31 July, peace treaties were signed at Breda and the Dutch began discussions with England and Spain on creating a diplomatic alliance against France. At the same time, Castel Rodrigo opened the water defences, flooding the land and bringing the French advance to a halt. Turenne withdrew and on 10 August [[Siege of Lille (1667)|besieged Lille]], capital of the [[Walloons|Walloon region]] and an important commercial centre.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=301}}\n\nThe garrison were allowed to withdraw after surrendering on 28 August; three days later, [[John Gaspar Ferdinand de Marchin, Comte de Granville|de Marchin]] and a Spanish relief force of 12,000 ran into a French cavalry detachment on the Bruges road. Ordered to cut off his retreat, [[Bernardin Gigault de Bellefonds|Bellefonds]] and de Cr\u00e9quy inflicted nearly 2,000 casualties; in early 1668, Louis created both [[List of Marshals of France#Louis XIV, 1643\u20131715|Marshals of France]].{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=303}} On 12 September, Turenne captured [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] but although his troops suffered relatively few battle casualties, sickness was a far bigger problem; in early October, campaigning ended for the winter.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=304}}\n\n===Negotiations; winter 1667/1668===\n[[File:Johan de Witt 1652.jpg|thumb|right|[[Johan de Witt]], Dutch [[Grand Pensionary]]; he had to persuade Louis to withdraw, while keeping him as an ally]]\nOn 31 July 1667, the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] ended the Anglo-Dutch War and negotiations began on a common front against France.{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=311}} This was driven by the [[States of Zeeland]], supported by [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|Sir William Temple]], English ambassador in [[the Hague]] and [[Brussels]], and Francois-Paul de Lisola, Leopold's representative in London.{{sfn|Goldie|Levillain|2018|p=5}}\n\nDe Witt summarised the Dutch dilemma as follows; 'to abandon Spain is to make France a present of the Netherlands, to take on her defence alone is folly.'{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=111}} Although he and Charles preferred France, the vast majority of their countrymen did not, which meant they had to satisfy domestic opinion by making Louis retreat, but remain friends. According to the French [[Simon Arnauld, Marquis de Pomponne|ambassador in Sweden]], Charles quickly recognised this was almost impossible, and focused on ensuring Louis blamed De Witt.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=6}}\n\nFrom April 1667 to June 1668, Franco-Dutch trade declined by 30%, due to the imposition of French tariffs.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=155}} Combined with the prospect of France as a neighbour, this led to widespread support for an Anglo-Dutch alliance among [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|Orangists]], the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] and the general populace.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=7}} In England, [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] and [[City of London Corporation|business]] wanted peace, while most preferred Spain for strategic and commercial reasons, including chief minister [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]]; an Anglo-Dutch alliance in support of Spain seemed the ideal solution. Finally, it allowed Charles to keep Parliament happy, while demonstrating Dutch unreliability and thus increasing the price Louis would pay for his support in the [[Secret Treaty of Dover|1670 Treaty of Dover]].{{sfn|Hutton|1986|pp=299-300}} \n\nIn September, De Witt promised to ensure Spain accepted French terms for ending the war, but Louis insisted he commit to enforcing them if needed. When Mariana refused, he persuaded the [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States of Holland]] to pass resolutions on 10 December and 14 January 1668, approving military action against Spain. This was strongly resisted by the other provinces, and the Orangist opposition in Holland.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=4}}\n[[File:Louis-xiv-lebrunl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], ca 1661]]\nWhen Philip died in 1665, Spain's only ally was Leopold; by 1668, their diplomats had built relationships with the Orangists, England, and traditional French supporters like Sweden and Brandenburg. In September 1667, [[Afonso VI of Portugal]] was deposed by his brother [[Peter II of Portugal|Pedro]], who opened discussions on ending the Restoration war.{{sfn|Mitchell|2019|p=47}} The 1667 agreement with France was annulled and on 13 February 1668, Spain recognised Portuguese independence with the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1668)|Treaty of Lisbon]].{{sfn|Newitt|2004|p=228}}\n\nTo fund the 1668 campaign, Castel-Rodrigo agreed a loan of 2 million guilders from the Amsterdam financial markets; as security, the Dutch would be allowed to occupy Bruges, Ostend and Damme. The prospect of peace with Portugal meant Mariana could reject these conditions; she sent Castel-Rodrigo [[Letter of credit|letters of credit]] for 600,000 escudos and one million bars of silver. This allowed him to begin recruiting, while Brandenburg agreed to supply 12,000 troops.{{sfn|Mitchell|2019|pp=50-52}}\n\nOn 20 January, Louis and Leopold signed a Partition Treaty, agreeing the division of the Spanish Empire if Charles of Spain died; this included the terms given to De Witt in September.{{sfn|Davenport| Paullin|1917|p=144,152}} The [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] was signed by England and the Republic on 23 January, the third member, [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], formally joining on 5 May, three days after Aix-la-Chapelle.{{sfn|Davenport| Paullin|1917|p=166}} It contained a pact of mutual defence, an agreement to ensure Spain accepted French terms, and secret clauses, including military action against France if Louis reneged on this promise.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|pp=8-10}}\n\nRuvigny, French ambassador in London, received a copy within days, allegedly from Arlington, which he passed onto Lionne.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=12}} Writing ten years later, largely to justify the subsequent [[Franco-Dutch War]], Louis claimed it was a calculated insult by the 'ungrateful Dutch nation', but his reaction at the time was far more moderate.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|p=23}} The French recognised the military clause was largely unenforceable; as Turenne observed, 'the Dutch have more ill-will than power, the English neither troops or money'.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|p=26}} Lionne also pointed out the Alliance's guarantee applied to both sides, obliging Spain to comply with French terms 'without it costing us a sou.'{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=156}}\n\n===February 1668; the campaign in Franche-Comt\u00e9===\n{{Location map many|France Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9|caption = Modern department of Bourgogne (left) and Franche-Comt\u00e9 (right); key locations 1668 campaign |border = black|width =300|float = right|relief=yes|\n|label  = Besan\u00e7on   |pos = right|lat_deg =47|lat_min  = 14|lon_deg  = 6|lon_min = 1\n|label2 = Dole       |pos2 = right |lat2_deg=47|lat2_min = 05|lon2_deg = 5|lon2_min = 30\n|label3 = Gray       |pos3 = right |lat3_deg=47|lat3_min  =27|lon3_deg = 5|lon3_min = 36\n|label4 = Vesoul     |pos4 = right|lat4_deg=47|lat4_min  =37|lon4_deg = 6|lon4_min = 10\n|label5 = Salins-les-Bains|pos5 = bottom|lat5_deg  =46|lat5_min  =57|lon5_deg  = 5|lon5_min = 53\n|label6  = Dijon     |pos6 = top |lat6_deg  =47|lat6_min=19|lon6_deg = 5|lon6_min = 01\n|label7  = Nevers    |pos7 = right  |lat7_deg  =47|lat7_min=00|lon7_deg = 3|lon7_min = 10\n|label8  = Auxonne   |pos8 = left   |lat8_deg  =47|lat8_min  =12|lon8_deg  = 5|lon8_min = 23\n}}\nThroughout his career, Louis sought to improve his position prior to negotiations; in September, he decided to occupy [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]]. It was almost impossible for Spain to defend, while its governor, the Marquis de Yenne, had fewer than 2,000 men to hold the entire province.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=305}} French armies also benefitted from vastly superior logistics, allowing them to open campaigns before their opponents were ready. The invasion was planned for early February, normally considered impractical for troop movements, adding the factor of surprise to superior numbers.{{sfn|Lynn|1999|p=112}}\n\nThe operation was commanded by the [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9|Prince de Cond\u00e9]]. Once France's leading general, he fought against Louis during the 1648 to 1653 [[Fronde]], then with Spain until 1659; this was his first command since returning from exile in 1660. Franche-Comt\u00e9 was considered part of [[Burgundy]], his family's traditional power base and his selection demonstrated royal control over an area with a long history as an independent state.{{sfn|Swann|2003|p=44}}\n\nTo keep his opponents guessing, Louis announced plans to double the army to 134,000 and leaked details of a proposed 1668 campaign. Led by himself and Turenne, 66,000 men would complete the conquest of the Spanish Netherlands; a subsidiary force under [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe of Orl\u00e9ans]] would attack [[Catalonia]], with Cond\u00e9 in the [[Three Bishoprics]] to deter an attack from Germany.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|pp=20-21}}\n\nThis provided cover for assembling troops and supplies in [[Dijon]]; by early February, Cond\u00e9 had 12,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry concentrated near [[Auxonne]]. He divided the army into two columns, the other led by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], and entered Franche-Comt\u00e9 on 4 February.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=305}} [[Free City of Besan\u00e7on|Besan\u00e7on]] and [[Salins-les-Bains]] surrendered on 7 February, after which Cond\u00e9 and Luxembourg moved onto [[Dole, Jura|Dole]], where they were joined by Louis on 9 February. His presence resulted in a largely unnecessary assault, which cost the French between 400 to 500 casualties, their only significant losses of the campaign. Dole surrendered on 14 February, followed by the provincial capital of [[Gray, Haute-Sa\u00f4ne|Gray]] on 19th; Louis was back in [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|Saint-Germain]] on 24th.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=306}}\n\n===May 1668; Northern Catalonia===\nOn the southern front, the Spanish took the initiative; the [[Gaspar T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n, 5th Duke de Osuna|Duke of Osuna]], [[Viceroy of Catalonia]], invaded the [[Upper Cerdanya]] with 2,300 infantry and 200 cavalry.{{sfn|Espino L\u00f3pez|1997|p=9}} Weak French defences allowed him to capture 55 villages in the region, although irregular local ''[[miquelets]]'' combined with the French military in resisting the invasion.{{sfn|Espino L\u00f3pez|1999|p=266}} Spanish incursions continued until 1669, forcing the French to fortify the border.{{sfn|Jan\u00e9 Checa|2003|p=454}}\n\n===Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle===\nWith the largest army in Europe, Turenne, Cond\u00e9 and Orl\u00e9ans argued for continuing the war. Lionne, Colbert and Le Tellier recommended peace, primarily on financial grounds; the 1660s was a period of significant economic decline, and war was expensive. France was unprepared for a naval war against the Dutch and English, and while Colbert had initiated policies aimed at reducing its dependence on Dutch shipping for transporting goods, this would take time.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=153-154}} In addition to those already contracted with Brandenburg, [[Charles V, Duke of Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]] offered Mariana another 8,000 men. {{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=163}}\n\nIn February, seven year old Charles was reported to be suffering from [[smallpox]], an often fatal disease; his death would give Louis a good chance of achieving his objectives without fighting. The combination decided him on peace; on 25 April, the Treaty of Saint Germain, between France, England and the Republic, finalised terms, which were then incorporated into the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], signed by Spain and France on 2 May.{{sfn|Lesaffer}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Map Peace of Aix la Chapelle (English).png|thumb|left|French gains by Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle: Louis returned [[Cambrai]], [[Aire-sur-la-Lys|Aire]] and [[Saint-Omer]], but retained the rest]]\nFrance withdrew from Franche-Comt\u00e9 and the Spanish Netherlands, with the exception of eleven towns and their surrounding areas. Lille, [[Armenti\u00e8res]], [[Bergues]] and [[Douai]] were considered essential to reinforce France's vulnerable northern border and remain French to this day. The retention of Tournai, Oudenarde, Courtrai, [[Veurne]], [[Binche]], Charleroi and [[Ath]] made future offensives much easier, as demonstrated in 1672.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=165}}\n\nFrom a military perspective, France strengthened its northern border, and [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]] began work on the defence line that became known as the ''Ceinture de fer''. Possession of towns like Charleroi and Tournai facilitated future campaigns through the control of vital routes into the Spanish Netherlands, but they were easily isolated and required expensive garrisons.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|p=31}}\n\nThe political results were mixed; in the Partition Treaty, Leopold recognised Louis' right to inherit part of the Spanish Empire, much to the anger of Spain. However, Louis' expansionist ambitions sparked discussions on an anti-French coalition, culminating in the formation of the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|1689 Grand Alliance]].{{sfn|Young|2004|p=220}}\n\nThe role of the Triple Alliance in the peace is debated by modern historians, including [[Herbert H. Rowen|Herbert Rowen]], \"arguably the most important English-speaking historian of the Dutch Republic since [[John Lothrop Motley]]\".{{sfn|Harline |1999}} Its real significance was aligning English and Dutch objectives, despite the brief interruption in 1672 of the deeply unpopular [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]; the Dutch viewed Aix-la-Chapelle as a diplomatic triumph.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=163-167}}\n\nConcern over French ambitions also revived the Orangist party, increasing internal political conflict with De Witt's Republican faction. One result was the deliberate neglect of the Dutch army, generally seen as bolstering the power of the [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]]; this had catastrophic repercussions in 1672.{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=312-316}}\n\nLouis went to war in 1667 because he believed the Dutch would never voluntarily agree the concessions required. He now decided capturing the Spanish Netherlands required him to first defeat the Republic, and began planning the [[Franco-Dutch War]].{{sfn|Lynn|1996|pp=109-110}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|editor-last1=Afflerbach |editor-first1=Holger |editor-last2=Strachan |editor-first2=Hew |title=How Fighting Ends: A History of Surrender| date=2012|publisher=OUP|isbn=978-0199693627|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Childs|first1=John|title=The Nine Years' War and the British Army, 1688-1697: The Operations in the Low Countries|date=1991|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0719089964|ref=harv|edition=2013}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Clodfelter |first1=Micheal (sic) |title=Warfare and Armed Conflicts: A Statistical Encyclopedia of Casualty and Other Figures, 1494-2007 |date=2008 |publisher=McFarland & Co |isbn=978-0786433193 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|editor1-last=Davenport|editor1-first=Frances Gardiner|editor2-last=Paullin|editor2-first=Charles Oscar|title=European Treaties Bearing on the History of the United States and Its Dependencies, Vol. 2: 1650-1697|date=1917|publisher=Forgotten Books|isbn=978-0483158924|edition=2018|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=De P\u00e9rini |first1=Hard\u00ff |title=Batailles fran\u00e7aises, 1660-1700, Volume IV|date=1896 |publisher=Ernest Flammarion, Paris |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Espino L\u00f3pez|first=Antonio|title=El servicio de armas aragon\u00e9s durante el reinado de Carlos II: la defensa de Catalu\u00f1a, 1665-1697|journal=Revista de historia Jer\u00f3nimo Zurita|volume=72|year=1997|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Espino L\u00f3pez|first=Antonio|title=es Catalu\u00f1a durante el reinado de Carlos II : pol\u00edtica y guerra en la frontera catalana, 1679-1697]|year=1999|publisher=Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Fisher|first1=Margaret Anne|last2=Savelle|first2=Max|title=The origins of American diplomacy: the international history of Angloamerica, 1492-1763 American diplomatic history series Authors|date=1967|publisher=Macmillan|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Geyl |first1=P |title=Johan de Witt, Grand Pensionary of Holland, 1653\u201372 |journal=History |date=1936 |volume=20 |issue=80|ref=harv |jstor=24401084}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Goldie |first1=M |last2=Levillain|first2= Charles-Edouard |title=Francois-Paul de Lisola and English Opposition to Louis XIV |journal=Historical Journal |date=2018 |ref=harv |doi=10.17863/CAM.35128}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Gooskens |first1=Frans |title=Sweden and the Treaty of Breda in 1667 \u2013 Swedish diplomats help to end naval warfare between the Dutch Republic and England |date=2016 |publisher=De Oranje-boom; Historical and Archeology Circle of the City and Country of Breda |url=https://sjohistoriskasamfundet.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/forum-navale-74-frans-gooskens.pdf|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Harline |first1=Craig |title=Herbert H.

Duran was later convicted of attempting to assassinate [[President of the United States|United States president]] [[Bill Clinton]] and sentenced to 40 years in prison.\n\n== Details ==\nOn Saturday October 29, 1994, dressed in a trench coat, Duran approached the fence overlooking the north lawn of the White House and fired a [[7.62\u00d739mm]] [[SKS]] [[semi-automatic rifle]] (Chinese-made copy [[SKS#Variants|Type 56]])<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Public Report of the White House Security Review\n | url = http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/ustreas/usss/t1pubrpt.html\n | date = c. 1995\n | accessdate = September 5, 2009\n}}</ref> at a group of men wearing dark business suits on the White House lawn. Two nearby boys claimed they had remarked aloud just before the shooting that one of the men looked like Clinton. [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents immediately began running across the lawn, with their guns drawn, when citizens Harry Rakosky, Ken Davis, and Robert Haines tackled Duran and pinned his arms until he could be subdued. Clinton was reportedly inside watching a football game at the time of the shooting and was not harmed. The incident followed just six weeks after [[Frank Eugene Corder]] crashed a [[Cessna]] into the White House south lawn and prompted debate about closing off traffic on that area of [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]]. No one was injured in the assassination attempt.\n\n== Trial ==\nThe most important charges in the two-week trial were attempted murder of the president and four counts of assaulting a federal officer (the Secret Service agents). Duran had served prison time previously, convicted of aggravated assault with a vehicle in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], and therefore, beyond the attempted murder of the President he was also charged with illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The other charges were use of an assault weapon during a crime of violence, destruction of U.S. property, and interstate transportation of a firearm with intent to commit a felony.\n\nDuran pleaded not guilty and mounted an [[insanity defense]], claiming that he was trying to save the world by destroying an alien \"mist\", connected by an [[umbilical cord]] to an alien in the [[Colorado]] mountains.  Prosecutors stated he was faking insanity and called more than 60 witnesses to testify that Duran hated government in general and President Clinton in particular.

Duran was later convicted of attempting to assassinate [[President of the United States|United States president]] [[Bill Clinton]] and sentenced to 40 years in prison.\n\n== Details ==\nOn Saturday October 29, 1994, dressed in a trench coat, Duran approached the fence overlooking the north lawn of the White House and fired a [[7.62\u00d739mm]] [[SKS]] [[semi-automatic rifle]] (Chinese-made copy [[SKS#Variants|Type 56]])<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Public Report of the White House Security Review\n | url = http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/ustreas/usss/t1pubrpt.html\n | date = c. 1995\n | accessdate = September 5, 2009\n}}</ref> at a group of men wearing dark business suits on the White House lawn. Two nearby boys claimed they had remarked aloud just before the shooting that one of the men looked like Clinton. [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents immediately began running across the lawn, with their guns drawn, when citizens Harry Rakosky, Ken Davis, and Robert Haines tackled Duran and pinned his arms until he could be subdued. Clinton was reportedly inside watching a football game at the time of the shooting and was not harmed. The incident followed just six weeks after [[Frank Eugene Corder]] crashed a [[Cessna]] into the White House south lawn and prompted debate about closing off traffic on that area of [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]]. No one was injured in the assassination attempt.\n\n== Trial ==\nThe most important charges in the two-week trial were attempted murder of the president and four counts of assaulting a federal officer (the Secret Service agents). Duran had served prison time previously, convicted of aggravated assault with a vehicle in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], and therefore, beyond the attempted murder of the President he was also charged with illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The other charges were use of an assault weapon during a crime of violence, destruction of U.S. property, and interstate transportation of a firearm with intent to commit a felony.\n\nDuran pleaded not guilty and mounted an [[insanity defense]], claiming that he was trying to save the world by destroying an alien \"mist\", connected by an [[umbilical cord]] to an alien in the [[Colorado]] mountains.  Prosecutors stated he was faking insanity and called more than 60 witnesses to testify that Duran hated government in general and President Clinton in particular.  The jury deliberated for under five hours to reject the insanity defense and arrive at the guilty verdict.<ref>{{cite news|title=Duran Convicted Of Trying to Kill President Clinton|url=http://www.prop1.org/park/pave/950405wp.htm|author=Locy, Toni|work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=April 5, 1995|access-date=September 5, 2009}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2013}}, Duran is serving his sentence at the medium-security [[Federal Correctional Institution, Florence|Federal Correctional Institution]] at [[Florence Federal Correctional Complex]] in [[Florence, Colorado]].

It was very successful in the SCCA F modified class on the west coast. Miles raced the \"Flying Shingle\" at Palm Springs in late March, finishing first overall against veteran driver Cy Yedor, also in an MG Special, and novice driver, actor [[James Dean]] in a [[Porsche 356]] Speedster. Miles was later disqualified on a technical infraction because his fenders were too wide, thus allowing Yedor and Dean to get 'bumped up' to first and second. During 1956, Miles raced John von Neumann's [[Porsche 550]] Spyder at most of the Cal Club and SCCA events.<ref>{{cite book|last=Raskin|first=Lee|title=James Dean: At Speed|year=2005|publisher=David Bull|location=Phoenix, Ariz.|isbn=978-1893618497|page=70}}</ref>\n\nFor the 1957 season (in co-operation with Otto Zipper), Miles engineered the installation of a Porsche 550S engine and transmission in a 1956 [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]] chassis and body. It was the second successful race car to be known on the West Coast as \"the Pooper\", the first being an early 1950s Cooper chassis and body powered by a Porsche 356 power train that was built and campaigned by [[Pete Lovely]] of Tacoma, Washington. The resulting car dominated the F Modified class of SCCA on the west coast in the 1957 and 1958 seasons with Miles driving.\n\nDue to his great skill and talent, both as a driver and mechanical engineer, Miles was a key member of the [[Carroll Shelby|Shelby]]/[[AC Cobra|Cobra]] race team in the early 1960s. Miles described himself this way:<ref>Baime, A.J.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PqhXAwAAQBAJ Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans]'', p. 214 (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2010).</ref>\n<blockquote>I am a mechanic. That has been the direction of my entire vocational life. Driving is a hobby, a relaxation for me, like golfing is to others.  I should like to drive a Formula One machine, not for the grand prize, but just to see what it is like.  I should think it would be jolly good fun!</blockquote>\n\nWith a very pronounced Brummie accent (from his hometown of Birmingham, renowned for car manufacturing) combined with a seemingly obscure and sardonic sense of humour, he was affectionately known by his American racing crew as \"Teddy Teabag\" (for his tea drinking) or \"Sidebite\" (as he talked out of the side of his mouth). He played a key role in the development and success of the racing versions of the [[AC Cobra#AC 289 Sports|Shelby Cobra 289]] in SCCA, USRRC and FIA sports car racing between 1962 and 1965 as well as the [[Shelby Daytona|Daytona Coupe]] and 427 versions of the Cobra and the [[Ford GT40|Ford GT (GT40)]].\n\nHe became the chief test driver of [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby-American]] in 1963.<ref name=passaic />\n\nMiles had a \"reputation for courtesy on the track\" and was sometimes called the \"[[Stirling Moss]] of the West Coast\".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Biographical Sketches of Drivers|last=Canadian Racing Drivers Association|date=1964|work=Player's 200 Media Kit}}</ref> While a member of the AC-Cobra Ford Team, Miles entered a [[Lotus 23]] in the 1964 Player's 200 at [[Mosport]]. [[File:Ford GT40 (rear).jpg|thumb|right|GT40 Mk II rear]]\n\nIn 1965, he shared a [[Ford GT40#Mk II|Ford GT Mk.II]] with [[Bruce McLaren]] at the [[1965 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]] but retired with gearbox trouble. Earlier in the year, also with McLaren, he had finished second at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]].\n\nThe next year he won the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], sharing the Ford GT Mk.II with [[Lloyd Ruby]], and then won the [[12 Hours of Sebring]]. Several months later, sharing the drive with [[Denny Hulme]], Miles was leading the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans]], but [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] executive Leo Beebe, desiring a publicity photo of three of their cars crossing the finish line together, instructed [[Carroll Shelby]] to order him to slow down, which Shelby agreed to. Accordingly, the next car from Ford driven by Bruce McLaren/[[Chris Amon]] and the third-place car from Ford drew up, and they cruised to the line together.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39146340/hartford_courant/|title=McLaren, Amon Win at LeMans|newspaper=Hartford Courant|location=Hartford, Connecticut|date=20 June 1966|page=21|via=Newspapers.com|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> The French race officials, after initially agreeing to Ford's dead-heat \"photo-finish\", reneged during the final hour of the race. After first declaring Ken Miles and Denny Hulme the winner, the decision was reversed. Since the Ford driven by McLaren/Amon who finished #2 had started some 20 yards behind the Miles/Hulme #1 Car, it had travelled a further distance, and Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon were declared the winners.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39146062/daily_independent_journal/|title=Fords Humiliate Mighty Ferraris in Le Mans Race|agency=Associated Press|date=20 June 1966|newspaper=Daily Independent Journal|location=San Rafael, California|via=Newspapers.com|page=29}}</ref> Miles was denied the unique achievement of winning Sebring, Daytona, and Le Mans in the same year.\n\nKiss her successor to the all-conquering Ford GT40 Mk.II and, despite reliability problems, showed potential in the springtime Le Mans trials. After the death of [[Walt Hansgen]] in a J-car Ford while testing at Le Mans in April, the decision was made to shelve the J-car and focus on the proven Mk IIs, and little development was done for the rest of the 1966 World Sports Car Championship season. Finally, in August 1966, Shelby American resumed testing and development work with Miles serving as primary test driver. The J-car featured a breadvan-shaped rear section that experimented with [[Kammback]] aerodynamic theories, as well as a revolutionary (but untested) honeycomb panel design that was supposed to both lighten and stiffen the car, but the design remained unproved with high-speed prototype sports cars.\n\nAfter almost a day of testing at Riverside International Raceway in the brutally hot Southern California desert summer weather, Miles approached the end of the track's {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}}, downhill back straight at top speed (200-plus mph) when the car suddenly looped, flipped, crashed and caught fire. The car broke into pieces and ejected Miles, killing him instantly. The car had suffered precisely the sort of crash damage the honeycomb construction was designed to prevent. As a result, the aerodynamics of the J-car were greatly modified to correct the rear-end lift generated at race speeds. Ford officials, under pressure after the second of two fatal accidents in the program in five months, also ordered a NASCAR-style steel tube rollover cage to be installed in future versions of the car.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The death of 47-year-old Miles, following that of 46-year-old Hansgen, led Ford to favour younger drivers in subsequent race entries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} The significantly revised J-car, renamed the [[Ford GT40#Mk IV|Ford Mk IV]], won the only two races in which it was entered: the 1967 Sebring (Fla.) 12 Hours, and the [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. The steel roll cage in the Mk IV (mandated as a direct result of Miles's death) probably saved the life of [[Mario Andretti]], who crashed violently during the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans but escaped.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nMiles is interred at the Abbey of the Psalms Mausoleum of the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]].\n\n==Awards and honours==\nMiles was posthumously inducted into the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 2001.<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/ken-miles.html Ken Miles] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref>\n\n==Racing record==\n===USAC Road Racing Championship results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

It was very successful in the SCCA F modified class on the west coast. Miles raced the \"Flying Shingle\" at Palm Springs in late March, finishing first overall against veteran driver Cy Yedor, also in an MG Special, and novice driver, actor [[James Dean]] in a [[Porsche 356]] Speedster. Miles was later disqualified on a technical infraction because his fenders were too wide, thus allowing Yedor and Dean to get 'bumped up' to first and second. During 1956, Miles raced John von Neumann's [[Porsche 550]] Spyder at most of the Cal Club and SCCA events.<ref>{{cite book|last=Raskin|first=Lee|title=James Dean: At Speed|year=2005|publisher=David Bull|location=Phoenix, Ariz.|isbn=978-1893618497|page=70}}</ref>\n\nFor the 1957 season (in co-operation with Otto Zipper), Miles engineered the installation of a Porsche 550S engine and transmission in a 1956 [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]] chassis and body. It was the second successful race car to be known on the West Coast as \"the Pooper\", the first being an early 1950s Cooper chassis and body powered by a Porsche 356 power train that was built and campaigned by [[Pete Lovely]] of Tacoma, Washington. The resulting car dominated the F Modified class of SCCA on the west coast in the 1957 and 1958 seasons with Miles driving.\n\nDue to his great skill and talent, both as a driver and mechanical engineer, Miles was a key member of the [[Carroll Shelby|Shelby]]/[[AC Cobra|Cobra]] race team in the early 1960s. Miles described himself this way:<ref>Baime, A.J.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PqhXAwAAQBAJ Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans]'', p. 214 (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2010).</ref>\n<blockquote>I am a mechanic. That has been the direction of my entire vocational life. Driving is a hobby, a relaxation for me, like golfing is to others.  I should like to drive a Formula One machine, not for the grand prize, but just to see what it is like.  I should think it would be jolly good fun!</blockquote>\n\nWith a very pronounced Brummie accent (from his hometown of Birmingham, renowned for car manufacturing) combined with a seemingly obscure and sardonic sense of humour, he was affectionately known by his American racing crew as \"Teddy Teabag\" (for his tea drinking) or \"Sidebite\" (as he talked out of the side of his mouth). He played a key role in the development and success of the racing versions of the [[AC Cobra#AC 289 Sports|Shelby Cobra 289]] in SCCA, USRRC and FIA sports car racing between 1962 and 1965 as well as the [[Shelby Daytona|Daytona Coupe]] and 427 versions of the Cobra and the [[Ford GT40|Ford GT (GT40)]].\n\nHe became the chief test driver of [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby-American]] in 1963.<ref name=passaic />\n\nMiles had a \"reputation for courtesy on the track\" and was sometimes called the \"[[Stirling Moss]] of the West Coast\".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Biographical Sketches of Drivers|last=Canadian Racing Drivers Association|date=1964|work=Player's 200 Media Kit}}</ref> While a member of the AC-Cobra Ford Team, Miles entered a [[Lotus 23]] in the 1964 Player's 200 at [[Mosport]]. [[File:Ford GT40 (rear).jpg|thumb|right|GT40 Mk II rear]]\n\nIn 1965, he shared a [[Ford GT40#Mk II|Ford GT Mk.II]] with [[Bruce McLaren]] at the [[1965 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]] but retired with gearbox trouble. Earlier in the year, also with McLaren, he had finished second at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]].\n\nThe next year he won the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], sharing the Ford GT Mk.II with [[Lloyd Ruby]], and then won the [[12 Hours of Sebring]]. Several months later, sharing the drive with [[Denny Hulme]], Miles was leading the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans]], but [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] executive Leo Beebe, desiring a publicity photo of three of their cars crossing the finish line together, instructed [[Carroll Shelby]] to order him to slow down, which Shelby agreed to. Accordingly, the next car from Ford driven by Bruce McLaren/[[Chris Amon]] and the third-place car from Ford drew up, and they cruised to the line together.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39146340/hartford_courant/|title=McLaren, Amon Win at LeMans|newspaper=Hartford Courant|location=Hartford, Connecticut|date=20 June 1966|page=21|via=Newspapers.com|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> The French race officials, after initially agreeing to Ford's dead-heat \"photo-finish\", reneged during the final hour of the race. After first declaring Ken Miles and Denny Hulme the winner, the decision was reversed. Since the Ford driven by McLaren/Amon who finished #2 had started some 20 yards behind the Miles/Hulme #1 Car, it had travelled a further distance, and Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon were declared the winners.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39146062/daily_independent_journal/|title=Fords Humiliate Mighty Ferraris in Le Mans Race|agency=Associated Press|date=20 June 1966|newspaper=Daily Independent Journal|location=San Rafael, California|via=Newspapers.com|page=29}}</ref> Miles was denied the unique achievement of winning Sebring, Daytona, and Le Mans in the same year.\n\n==Death==\nThe Ford J-car was intended to be the successor to the all-conquering Ford GT40 Mk.II and, despite reliability problems, showed potential in the springtime Le Mans trials. After the death of [[Walt Hansgen]] in a J-car Ford while testing at Le Mans in April, the decision was made to shelve the J-car and focus on the proven Mk IIs, and little development was done for the rest of the 1966 World Sports Car Championship season. Finally, in August 1966, Shelby American resumed testing and development work with Miles serving as primary test driver. The J-car featured a breadvan-shaped rear section that experimented with [[Kammback]] aerodynamic theories, as well as a revolutionary (but untested) honeycomb panel design that was supposed to both lighten and stiffen the car, but the design remained unproved with high-speed prototype sports cars.\n\nAfter almost a day of testing at Riverside International Raceway in the brutally hot Southern California desert summer weather, Miles approached the end of the track's {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}}, downhill back straight at top speed (200-plus mph) when the car suddenly looped, flipped, crashed and caught fire. The car broke into pieces and ejected Miles, killing him instantly. The car had suffered precisely the sort of crash damage the honeycomb construction was designed to prevent. As a result, the aerodynamics of the J-car were greatly modified to correct the rear-end lift generated at race speeds. Ford officials, under pressure after the second of two fatal accidents in the program in five months, also ordered a NASCAR-style steel tube rollover cage to be installed in future versions of the car.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The death of 47-year-old Miles, following that of 46-year-old Hansgen, led Ford to favour younger drivers in subsequent race entries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} The significantly revised J-car, renamed the [[Ford GT40#Mk IV|Ford Mk IV]], won the only two races in which it was entered: the 1967 Sebring (Fla.) 12 Hours, and the [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. The steel roll cage in the Mk IV (mandated as a direct result of Miles's death) probably saved the life of [[Mario Andretti]], who crashed violently during the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans but escaped.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nMiles is interred at the Abbey of the Psalms Mausoleum of the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]].\n\n==Awards and honours==\nMiles was posthumously inducted into the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 2001.<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/ken-miles.html Ken Miles] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref>\n\n==Racing record==\n===USAC Road Racing Championship results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

Maryon effectively had two careers. He practiced and taught sculpture until retiring in 1939, then worked as a conservator with the [[British Museum]] from 1944 until 1961. He is best known for his work on the [[Sutton Hoo]] [[Ship burial|ship-burial]], which lead to his appointment as an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]].\n\nBy his mid-twenties Maryon had attended three art schools, apprenticed in silversmithing with [[Charles Robert Ashbee|C. R. Ashbee]], and worked in [[Henry Wilson (architect)|Henry Wilson]]'s workshop. From 1900 to 1904 he served as the director of the Keswick School of Industrial Art, where he designed and exhibited numerous [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] works. After moving to the [[University of Reading]] and then [[Colleges of Durham University#Colleges in Newcastle (Armstrong College and King's College)|Durham University]], he taught sculpture, metalwork, modelling, casting, and anatomy until 1939; he also designed the [[University of Reading War Memorial]], among other commissions. Maryon published two books while teaching, including the standard ''Metalwork and Enamelling'', and more than a dozen articles. He frequently led archaeological digs, and in 1935 discovered one of the oldest gold ornaments known in Britain while excavating the [[Kirkhaugh cairns]].\n\nIn 1944 Maryon was brought out of retirement to work on the Sutton Hoo finds. His responsibilities included restoring the shield, the drinking horns, and the iconic [[Sutton Hoo helmet]], which proved academically and culturally influential. Maryon's work, much of which was revised in the 1970s, created credible renderings upon which subsequent research relied; likewise, one of his papers coined the term ''[[pattern welding]]'' to describe a method employed on the Sutton Hoo sword to strengthen and decorate iron and steel. The initial work ended in 1950, and Maryon turned to other matters. He proposed a widely publicised theory in 1953 on the construction of the [[Colossus of Rhodes]], influencing [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and others, and restored the Roman [[Emesa helmet]] in 1955. He left the museum in 1961, a year after his official retirement, and began an around-the-world trip lecturing and researching [[Chinese magic mirror]]s.\n\nMaryon is remembered as one of the finest conservators who combined deep technical, artistic, and historical understandings of the objects he worked on. His works remain influential, particularly ''Metalwork and Enamelling'', which remains in print more than a century after its first publication.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHerbert James Maryon was born in London on 9 March 1874.{{sfn|Mapping Sculpture|2011a}}{{sfn|Who Was Who|2014}} He was the third of six surviving children born to John Simeon Maryon, a tailor,{{sfn|Kelly's Directory|1891|p=1176}} and Louisa Maryon (n\u00e9e Church).{{sfn|Maryon|1895|pp=9\u201310}}{{sfn|England Census|1891}}{{sfn|England Birth Index|1874}} He had an older brother, John Ernest, and an older sister, [[Edith Maryon|Louisa Edith]], the latter of whom preceded him in his vocation as a sculptor. Another brother and three sisters were born after him\u2014in order, George Christian, Flora Mabel, Mildred Jessie, and Violet Mary\u2014although Flora Maryon, born in 1878, died in her second year.{{sfn|Maryon|1895|p=10}} According to a pedigree compiled by John Ernest Maryon,{{sfn|Maryon|1897}} the Maryons traced back to the de Marinis family, a branch of which left Normandy for England around the 12th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Maryon|1895|p=1}}\n\nAfter receiving his general education at [[The John Lyon School|The Lower School of John Lyon]],{{sfn|Institution of Mechanical Engineers|1918}} Herbert Maryon studied from 1896 to 1900 at the Polytechnic (probably [[University of Westminster|Regent Street]]), [[Slade School of Fine Art|The Slade]], [[Saint Martin's School of Art]], and, under the tutelage of [[Alexander Fisher (painter)|Alexander Fisher]]{{sfn|Bruce|2001|p=54}} and [[William Lethaby]],{{sfn|''International Studio''|1908|p=342}} the [[Central School of Art and Design|Central School of Arts and Crafts]].{{sfn|Mapping Sculpture|2011a}}{{sfn|Institution of Mechanical Engineers|1918}} Under Fisher in particular, Maryon learned [[Vitreous enamel|enamelling]].{{sfn|Bruce|2001|p=54}} Maryon further received a one-year silversmithing apprenticeship in 1898, at [[Charles Robert Ashbee|C. R. Ashbee]]'s Essex House Guild of Handicrafts,{{sfn|Institution of Mechanical Engineers|1918}}{{sfn|Mapping Sculpture|2011a}}{{sfn|Ashbee|1908|p=256}} and worked for a period of time in [[Henry Wilson (architect)|Henry Wilson]]'s workshop.{{sfn|Bruce|2001|p=54}}{{sfn|Mapping Sculpture|2011b}} At some point, though perhaps later, Maryon also worked in the workshop of [[George Frampton]],{{sfn|British Museum Comedy statue}} and was taught by [[Robert Catterson Smith]].{{sfn|Maryon|1912|p=viii}}\n\n== Sculpture ==\n[[File:Herbert Maryon - Winged Victory.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour photograph Herbert Maryon's sculpture Winged Victory|''Winged Victory'' by Herbert Maryon]]\n{{see also|Works of Herbert Maryon}}\nFrom 1900 until 1939, Maryon held various positions teaching sculpture, design, and metalwork.{{sfn|Mapping Sculpture|2011a}} During this time, and while still in school beforehand, he created and exhibited many of his own works.{{sfn|Mapping Sculpture|2011a}} At the end of 1899 he displayed a silver cup and a shield of arms with silver [[cloisonn\u00e9]] at the sixth exhibition of the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]], an event held at the [[New Gallery (London)|New Gallery]] that also included a work by his sister Edith.{{sfn|Arts & Crafts Exhibition Catalogue|1899|pp=19, 49, 91, 136}} The exhibition was reviewed by [[The Studio (magazine)|''The International Studio'']], with Maryon's work singled out as \"agreeable\".{{sfn|H.|1899|pp=269\u2013270}}\n\n=== Keswick School of Industrial Art, 1900\u20131904 ===\nIn March 1900 Maryon became the first director of the [[Keswick School of Industrial Art]].{{sfn|Bruce|2001|pp=54, 137}}{{sfn|Crouch|Barnes|p=6}}{{sfn|England Census|1901a}} The school had been opened by Edith and [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]] in 1884, amid the emergence of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]].{{sfn|Bruce|2001|p=6}} It offered classes in drawing, design, woodcarving, and metalwork, and melded commercial with artistic purposes; the school sold items such as trays, frames, tables, and clock-cases, and developed a reputation for quality.{{sfn|Bruce|2001|pp=38\u201339}} Already by May a reviewer for ''The Studio'' of an exhibition at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] commented that a group of silver tableware by the school was \"a welcome departure towards finer craftsmanship\".{{sfn|Wood|1900a|p=85}}{{sfn|Wood|1900b|p=85}} Two of Maryon's designs, she wrote, \"were singularly good\u2014a knocker, executed by Jeremiah Richardson, and a copper casket made by Thomas Spark and ornamented by Thomas Clark and the designer\".{{sfn|Wood|1900a|p=85}}{{sfn|Wood|1900b|p=85}}{{refn|group=note|The casket was auctioned in 2005 by Penrith Farmers\u2019 & Kidd\u2019s, with an estimate of \u00a3800 to \u00a31,200.{{sfn|''Cumberland & Westmorland Herald''|2005}}{{sfn|The Salesroom|2005}}}} She described the casket's lock as \"enamelled in pearly blue and white\", and giving \"a dainty touch of colour to a form almost bare of ornament, but beautiful in its proportions and lines\".{{sfn|Wood|1900a|p=85}}{{sfn|Wood|1900b|p=85}} At the following year's exhibition three more works by the school were singled out for praise, including a [[loving cup]] by Maryon.{{sfn|Gregory|1901|p=139}}\n\nUnder Maryon's leadership the Keswick School expanded the breadth and range of its designs, and he executed several significant commissions.{{sfn|Bruce|2001|p=65}} His best works, wrote a historian of the school, \"drew their inspiration from the nature of the material and his deep understanding of its technical limits\".{{sfn|Bruce|2001|p=65}} They also tended to be in metal.{{sfn|Bruce|2001|p=65}} Items like ''Bryony'', a tray centre showing tangled growth concealed within a geometric framework, continued the school's tradition of [[Repouss\u00e9 and chasing|repouss\u00e9]] work of naturalistic interpretations of flowers, while evoking the vine-like wallpapers of [[William Morris]].{{sfn|Bruce|2001|pp=65, 69}} These themes were particularly expressed in a 1901 plaque memorialising [[Bernard Gilpin]], unveiled in [[St Cuthbert's Church, Kentmere|St Cuthbert's Church]], [[Kentmere]]; described by the art historian Sir [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] as \"Arts and Crafts, almost [[Art Nouveau]]\", the bronze tablet on oak is framed by trees with entwined roots and influenced by a [[Viking art|Norse]] and [[Celtic art|Celtic]] aesthetic.{{sfn|Bruce|2001|pp=65, 60}}{{sfn|''Northern Counties Magazine''|1901|p=55}} Three other commissions in silver\u2014a loving cup, a processional cross, and a challenge shield\u2014were completed towards the end of Maryon's tenure and the school and featured in ''The Studio'' and its international counterpart.{{sfn|''The Studio''|1905}}{{sfn|''International Studio''|1906}} The cup was commissioned by the [[Cumberland County Council, England|Cumberland County Council]] for presentation to {{HMS|Cumberland|1902|6}}, and was termed a \"tour de force\".{{sfn|Bruce|2001|pp=74, 76\u201377}}\n\n[[File:Memorial to Bernard Gilpin in Kentmere Church.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour photograph of a memorial plaque to Bernard Gilpin|1901 memorial to Bernard Gilpin, designed by Maryon, in [[St Cuthbert's Church, Kentmere|St Cuthbert's Church]]]]\nParticularly in more utilitarian works, Maryon's designs at the Keswick School tended to emphasise form over design.{{sfn|Bruce|2001|pp=65, 68\u201369}}{{sfn|''The International Studio''|1903|p=211}} As he would write a decade later, \"[o]ver-insistence on technique, craftsmanship which proclaims 'How clever am I!' quite naturally elbows out artistic feeling.

There exist many photographs of the ship, taken from many angles, and they provide much information as to its structure and general appearance. But has anything been done to preserve the actual form of the vessel--full size?<br>The Viking ships in their museum in Scandinavia are most impressive, for they are surviving representatives of the actual vessels which played so great a part in the early history of Western Europe. The Sutton Hoo ship is our only representative in this class. I believe that all the timbers have perished, but the form remains--traced in the earth.<br>That form could be preserved in a plaster cast. I have given some thought to the making of large casts for I have done figures up to 18 feet in height. The work could be done in the following manner: a light steel girder would be constructed, running the full length of the ship, but built in quite short sections. This would not rise above the level of the gunwale at any point but would follow the general curve of the central section of the vessel. It would extend right down to the keel, and would support all the lateral frames. The outer skin, which would preserve the actual external form of the vessel, would be of the usual canvas and plaster work. It would be cast in sections, each perhaps extending along five feet of the length and from keel to gunwale on one side. All sections would be assembled by bolting the frames together. Any roughness of surface due to accidental irregularities in the existing earth matrix could be removed. If it were desired to illustrate the inner structure of the vessel also, I think that that might be shown by constructing a wooden model on a reduced scale.<br>Such a cast as that suggested above would be a very important document for the history of the time and it would provide a valuable introduction to Sutton Hoo's splendid array of furnishings.\"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=228\u2013229}}}}Such an operation was not carried out at the time, largely due to time constraints imposed by World War II\u2014impending during the original 1939 excavation, and in full swing by the time of Maryon's letter.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=170}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=229}} When an impression was taken during the 1965\u201369 Sutton Hoo excavations,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1968}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=170\u2013174}}{{sfn|van Geersdaele|1969}}{{sfn|van Geersdaele|1970}} much the same methods that Maryon proposed were adopted.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=229}}}} Nearly four years after his letter, in the dying days of World War II and the finds removed (or about to be removed) from safekeeping in the [[Aldwych tube station]],{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=xxxvii}} he was assigned what [[Rupert Bruce-Mitford]], who succeeded Kendrick's post in 1954,{{sfn|Biddle|2015|p=76}}{{sfn|''The Times''|1994}} termed \"the real headaches \u2013 notably the crushed shield, helmet and drinking horns\".{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1989a}} Composed in large part of iron, wood and horn, these items had decayed in the 1,300&nbsp;years since their burial and left only fragments behind;

A subsurface sample of the moulding \"suggest[ed] that the original metal was tin,\" (Maryon's theory) while a surface sample showed an \"\u03b5-copper/tin compound (Cu3Sn)\" and thus suggested instead, because of a similar process observed on the shield, \"that the surface of a bronze alloy containing at least 62% of copper had been coated with tin and heated.\"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=226\u2013227}} Additionally, a surface sample taken near the crest had a trace of mercury, suggestive of a fire-gilding process that requires a temperature at least 128 \u00b0C above the melting point of tin.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=227}} An alloy containing at least 20% copper would thus be needed to sufficiently raise the melting point of the tin during the gilding process, a reality further inconsistent with the results of the subsurface sample of moulding.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=227}} As to swageing, \"if the strips [of moulding] were of high tin alloy throughout, swageing would be impossible as copper/tin alloys containing more than 20% of tin are very brittle\", while an alloy containing less than 25% tin would no longer replicate the white colour of the helmet.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=227}} Although the subsurface sample supports Maryon's theory of swaged tin\u2014though not of universally gilded mouldings, which as reflected in the 1973 replica helmet were only found next to the crest\u2014it contradicts the theory suggested by the surface sample, i.e., a copper alloy with a high tin content that was not swaged.}} \"It was only because there was a first restoration that could be constructively criticized\", noted the conservation scholar [[Chris Caple]], \"that there was the impetus and improved ideas available for a second restoration\";{{sfn|Caple|2000|p=133}} similarly, minor [[Sutton Hoo helmet#Errors|errors in the second reconstruction]] were discovered while forging the 1973 [[Royal Armouries]] replica.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=181}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974b|p=285}} In executing a first reconstruction that was reversible and retained evidence by being only lightly cleaned,{{sfn|Caple|2000|p=134}} Maryon's true contribution to the Sutton Hoo helmet was in creating a credible first rendering that allowed for the critical examination leading to the second, current, reconstruction.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1983a|p=xliii}}\n\n=== After Sutton Hoo ===\n[[File:Maryon - Dal\u00ed Colossus.png|thumb|alt=A black and white drawing of the Colossus of Rhodes from Herbert Maryon's 1954 paper, next to a Salvador Dal\u00ed's 1954 rendering of the Colossus|A paper read by Maryon in December 1953 likely influenced [[The Colossus of Rhodes (Dal\u00ed)|Salvador Dal\u00ed's 1954 rendering of the Colossus]].

E. L. Haynes|Denys Haynes]], then the Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the British Museum,{{sfn|Williams|1994}}{{sfn|Monuments Men Foundation}} suggested that Maryon's theory of hammered bronze plates relied on an errant translation of a primary source.{{sfn|Haynes|1957|p=311}}{{refn|group=note|Maryon used [[Johann Caspar von Orelli]]'s translation of [[Philo of Byzantium]], which Haynes argued \"is frequently misleading\".{{sfn|Haynes|1957|p=311}} Using [[Rudolf Hercher]]'s translation, Haynes suggested that \"\u0388\u03c0\u03b9\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd is a key word for the whole of Philo's description.

It is contrasted with \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 'to place upon', which would imply that the casting was done at a distance. Since in 'casting upon' the molten metal which was to form the new part would presumably have come into direct contact with the existing part, fusion (i.e. 'casting on' in the technical sense) would probably have resulted.\"{{sfn|Haynes|1957|p=311}} Yet the amount of bronze Philo claimed the Colossus to have been made from\u2014500 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]]\u2014would not be enough for a statue that was cast, leading Haynes to argue that the figure had been corrupted.{{sfn|Haynes|1957|p=312 & n.4}}{{sfn|Dickie|1996|p=251}} Haynes thus effectively conceded that if the 500-talent figure was correct, Maryon had a point.{{sfn|Dickie|1996|p=251}}}} Maryon's view was nevertheless influential, likely shaping [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'s 1954 surrealist imagining of the statue, [[The Colossus of Rhodes (Dal\u00ed)|''The Colossus of Rhodes'']]. \"Not only the pose,\" wrote de Callata\u00ff, \"but even the hammered plates of Maryon's theory find [in Dal\u00ed's painting] a clear and very powerful expression.\"{{sfn|de Callata\u00ff|2006|p=54}}\n\n== Later years ==\n[[File:Herbert Maryon.png|thumb|alt=Black and white photograph of Herbert Maryon|Maryon, {{circa}} 1950s or 1960s]]\n\nMaryon finally left the British Museum in 1961,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1965}} a year after his official retirement.{{sfn|Schweppe|1965a}} He donated a number of items to the museum, including plaster maquettes by George Frampton of Comedy and Tragedy, used for the memorial to Sir [[W.

Maryon effectively had two careers. He practiced and taught sculpture until retiring in 1939, then worked as a conservator with the [[British Museum]] from 1944 until 1961. He is best known for his work on the [[Sutton Hoo]] [[Ship burial|ship-burial]], which lead to his appointment as an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]].\n\nBy his mid-twenties Maryon had attended three art schools, apprenticed in silversmithing with [[Charles Robert Ashbee|C. R. Ashbee]], and worked in [[Henry Wilson (architect)|Henry Wilson]]'s workshop. From 1900 to 1904 he served as the director of the Keswick School of Industrial Art, where he designed and exhibited numerous [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] works. After moving to the [[University of Reading]] and then [[Colleges of Durham University#Colleges in Newcastle (Armstrong College and King's College)|Durham University]], he taught sculpture, metalwork, modelling, casting, and anatomy until 1939; he also designed the [[University of Reading War Memorial]], among other commissions. Maryon published two books while teaching, including the standard ''Metalwork and Enamelling'', and more than a dozen articles. He frequently led archaeological digs, and in 1935 discovered one of the oldest gold ornaments known in Britain while excavating the [[Kirkhaugh cairns]].\n\nIn 1944 Maryon was brought out of retirement to work on the Sutton Hoo finds. His responsibilities included restoring the shield, the drinking horns, and the iconic [[Sutton Hoo helmet]], which proved academically and culturally influential. Maryon's work, much of which was revised in the 1970s, created credible renderings upon which subsequent research relied; likewise, one of his papers coined the term ''[[pattern welding]]'' to describe a method employed on the Sutton Hoo sword to strengthen and decorate iron and steel. The initial work ended in 1950, and Maryon turned to other matters. He proposed a widely publicised theory in 1953 on the construction of the [[Colossus of Rhodes]], influencing [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and others, and restored the Roman [[Emesa helmet]] in 1955. He left the museum in 1961, a year after his official retirement, and began an around-the-world trip lecturing and researching [[Chinese magic mirror]]s.\n\nMaryon is remembered as one of the finest conservators who combined deep technical, artistic, and historical understandings of the objects he worked on. His works remain influential, particularly ''Metalwork and Enamelling'', which remains in print more than a century after its first publication.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHerbert James Maryon was born in London on 9 March 1874.{{sfn|Mapping Sculpture|2011a}}{{sfn|Who Was Who|2014}} He was the third of six surviving children born to John Simeon Maryon, a tailor,{{sfn|Kelly's Directory|1891|p=1176}} and Louisa Maryon (n\u00e9e Church).{{sfn|Maryon|1895|pp=9\u201310}}{{sfn|England Census|1891}}{{sfn|England Birth Index|1874}} He had an older brother, John Ernest, and an older sister, [[Edith Maryon|Louisa Edith]], the latter of whom preceded him in his vocation as a sculptor. Another brother and three sisters were born after him\u2014in order, George Christian, Flora Mabel, Mildred Jessie, and Violet Mary\u2014although Flora Maryon, born in 1878, died in her second year.{{sfn|Maryon|1895|p=10}} According to a pedigree compiled by John Ernest Maryon,{{sfn|Maryon|1897}} the Maryons traced back to the de Marinis family, a branch of which left Normandy for England around the 12th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Maryon|1895|p=1}}\n\nAfter receiving his general education at [[The John Lyon School|The Lower School of John Lyon]],{{sfn|Institution of Mechanical Engineers|1918}} Herbert Maryon studied from 1896 to 1900 at the Polytechnic (probably [[University of Westminster|Regent Street]]), [[Slade School of Fine Art|The Slade]], [[Saint Martin's School of Art]], and, under the tutelage of [[Alexander Fisher (painter)|Alexander Fisher]]{{sfn|Bruce|2001|p=54}} and [[William Lethaby]],{{sfn|''International Studio''|1908|p=342}} the [[Central School of Art and Design|Central School of Arts and Crafts]].{{sfn|Mapping Sculpture|2011a}}{{sfn|Institution of Mechanical Engineers|1918}} Under Fisher in particular, Maryon learned [[Vitreous enamel|enamelling]].{{sfn|Bruce|2001|p=54}} Maryon further received a one-year silversmithing apprenticeship in 1898, at [[Charles Robert Ashbee|C.

There exist many photographs of the ship, taken from many angles, and they provide much information as to its structure and general appearance. But has anything been done to preserve the actual form of the vessel--full size?<br>The Viking ships in their museum in Scandinavia are most impressive, for they are surviving representatives of the actual vessels which played so great a part in the early history of Western Europe. The Sutton Hoo ship is our only representative in this class. I believe that all the timbers have perished, but the form remains--traced in the earth.<br>That form could be preserved in a plaster cast. I have given some thought to the making of large casts for I have done figures up to 18 feet in height. The work could be done in the following manner: a light steel girder would be constructed, running the full length of the ship, but built in quite short sections. This would not rise above the level of the gunwale at any point but would follow the general curve of the central section of the vessel. It would extend right down to the keel, and would support all the lateral frames. The outer skin, which would preserve the actual external form of the vessel, would be of the usual canvas and plaster work. It would be cast in sections, each perhaps extending along five feet of the length and from keel to gunwale on one side. All sections would be assembled by bolting the frames together.

A subsurface sample of the moulding \"suggest[ed] that the original metal was tin,\" (Maryon's theory) while a surface sample showed an \"\u03b5-copper/tin compound (Cu3Sn)\" and thus suggested instead, because of a similar process observed on the shield, \"that the surface of a bronze alloy containing at least 62% of copper had been coated with tin and heated.\"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=226\u2013227}} Additionally, a surface sample taken near the crest had a trace of mercury, suggestive of a fire-gilding process that requires a temperature at least 128 \u00b0C above the melting point of tin.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=227}} An alloy containing at least 20% copper would thus be needed to sufficiently raise the melting point of the tin during the gilding process, a reality further inconsistent with the results of the subsurface sample of moulding.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=227}} As to swageing, \"if the strips [of moulding] were of high tin alloy throughout, swageing would be impossible as copper/tin alloys containing more than 20% of tin are very brittle\", while an alloy containing less than 25% tin would no longer replicate the white colour of the helmet.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=227}} Although the subsurface sample supports Maryon's theory of swaged tin\u2014though not of universally gilded mouldings, which as reflected in the 1973 replica helmet were only found next to the crest\u2014it contradicts the theory suggested by the surface sample, i.e., a copper alloy with a high tin content that was not swaged.}} \"It was only because there was a first restoration that could be constructively criticized\", noted the conservation scholar [[Chris Caple]], \"that there was the impetus and improved ideas available for a second restoration\";{{sfn|Caple|2000|p=133}} similarly, minor [[Sutton Hoo helmet#Errors|errors in the second reconstruction]] were discovered while forging the 1973 [[Royal Armouries]] replica.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=181}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974b|p=285}} In executing a first reconstruction that was reversible and retained evidence by being only lightly cleaned,{{sfn|Caple|2000|p=134}} Maryon's true contribution to the Sutton Hoo helmet was in creating a credible first rendering that allowed for the critical examination leading to the second, current, reconstruction.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1983a|p=xliii}}\n\n=== After Sutton Hoo ===\n[[File:Maryon - Dal\u00ed Colossus.png|thumb|alt=A black and white drawing of the Colossus of Rhodes from Herbert Maryon's 1954 paper, next to a Salvador Dal\u00ed's 1954 rendering of the Colossus|A paper read by Maryon in December 1953 likely influenced [[The Colossus of Rhodes (Dal\u00ed)|Salvador Dal\u00ed's 1954 rendering of the Colossus]].

Haynes|Denys Haynes]], then the Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the British Museum,{{sfn|Williams|1994}}{{sfn|Monuments Men Foundation}} suggested that Maryon's theory of hammered bronze plates relied on an errant translation of a primary source.{{sfn|Haynes|1957|p=311}}{{refn|group=note|Maryon used [[Johann Caspar von Orelli]]'s translation of [[Philo of Byzantium]], which Haynes argued \"is frequently misleading\".{{sfn|Haynes|1957|p=311}} Using [[Rudolf Hercher]]'s translation, Haynes suggested that \"\u0388\u03c0\u03b9\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd is a key word for the whole of Philo's description.

Gargano's match with Almas at TakeOver: Philadelphia was highly acclaimed, earning five stars from [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]] journalist [[Dave Meltzer]], making it the first match in NXT history to receive a five-star rating, as well as WWE's sixth overall and the first one since [[John Cena]] vs. [[CM Punk]] at the [[Money in the Bank (2011)|2011 Money in the Bank]] pay-per-view.

Leela was a [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] of the [[Fourth Doctor]] and a regular in the programme from 1977 to 1978. Writer [[Chris Boucher]] named her after the Palestinian hijacker [[Leila Khaled]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaldorcity.com/people/cbinterview_1992.html|title=1992 Interview with Chris Boucher|publisher=}}</ref> Leela appeared in 9 stories (40 episodes).\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Television===\nLeela was the daughter of Sole. She first appears in the 1977 serial ''[[The Face of Evil]]''. She is a warrior of the savage Sevateem tribe, who were amongst the descendants of the crew of an [[Earth]] starship from The Mordee Expedition that crash-landed on an unnamed planet in the far future. The tribe's name is a corruption of \"survey team\". The Doctor at this point was content to travel alone, but Leela barged into the [[TARDIS]] and continued to accompany him on his journeys.\n\nThough a primitive, Leela was highly intelligent, grasping advanced concepts easily and translating them into terms she could cope with. Despite the Doctor's attempts at \"civilizing\" her, Leela was strong-willed enough to continue in her ways. She usually dressed in animal skins, and was armed with a knife or a set of poisonous Janis thorns, which she did not hesitate to use on people who threatened her, much to the Doctor's disapproval.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/companions/page20.shtml|title=BBC - Doctor Who - Classic Series  - Companions - Leela|publisher=}}</ref> She often demonstrated a highly accurate sense of danger.\n\nIn her travels with the Doctor, Leela faced [[The Robots of Death|killer robots]], [[Talons of Weng-Chiang|murderous homunculi]], [[Horror of Fang Rock|the Rutan Host]], and the [[Sontaran]] invasion of the Doctor's home planet of [[Gallifrey]]. During this final adventure, ''[[The Invasion of Time]]'', she meets and falls in love with Andred, a native Gallifreyan, and decides to stay behind to be with him. The first [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]] remains with her.<ref>http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2011/07/a-companion-to-the-doctors-companions-leela</ref> This exit for her character was created after Jameson announced her intention to leave the show.\n\nFollowing her departure she was mentioned in the series on two subsequent occasions. In [[Full Circle (Doctor Who)|Full Circle]], when the Doctor believes he has returned to Gallifrey, he admits, \"I'm so looking forward to seeing how Leela and Andred are getting on\". When he finally does arrive on Gallifrey in [[Arc of Infinity]], he asks after her: \"Tell me, what of my former companion Leela?\" The Doctor is told she is \"well and very happy\", to which he responds \"I was so sorry to miss her wedding\".\n\n===Other media===\nLouise Jameson reprised the role of Leela on screen in the 1993 charity special ''[[Dimensions in Time]]''.\n\nLeela's life on Gallifrey has been explored in various [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media. In the [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel ''[[Lungbarrow]]'', by Marc Platt, Leela and Andred are expecting a child, the first naturally conceived baby on Gallifrey for millennia. When the Doctor learns this, he asks her to name it after him; Platt explained that this was meant to suggest a [[time loop]] in which the hybrid child goes on to become [[The Other (Doctor Who)|the Other]] and subsequently the Doctor, explaining his half-human parentage in the 1996 TV film.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=Benjamin | date=31 May 2001 |title=The Fall of the Gold House of Usher |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=305 |page=30}}</ref>\n\nJameson has voiced the character in six series of [[Big Finish Productions]] audio plays set on Gallifrey, alongside [[Lalla Ward]] as [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] and [[John Leeson]] as K-9. In the [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#Gallifrey|''Gallifrey'' audio series]], Leela acts as Romana's bodyguard, advisor and friend. Being in the presence of Time Lord biology extends Leela's lifespan, keeping her relatively youthful. However, if she ever left them, she would quickly age to death. In ''Gallifrey'', Leela and Andred separate after Andred fakes his death to infiltrate the Celestial Intervention Agency (he regenerates and impersonates a man who attempted to kill him, not considering how his actions would affect Leela). Andred is subsequently killed and Leela is blinded during a Gallifreyan civil war, which also results in her version of K9 (the original) being destroyed. She is then taken out of time, to avoid her perishing with the rest of Gallifrey. She follows Romana through several alternative universes, regaining vision in one eye by ingesting vampire blood, her unique physiology allowing her to be physically enhanced by it without experiencing the negative mental side effects. She eventually returns to her original universe with Romana in time to save their Gallifrey.\n\nIn 2011, Leela joined the cast of the second series of ''[[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#Jago .26 Litefoot|Jago & Litefoot]]'', where she is sent by Romana to investigate breaks in time in Victorian London. The same year, Jameson reprised the role of Leela alongside Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor for a series of audio dramas for Big Finish. These dramas began to be released in January 2012 and are adaptations of stories planned for the TV but never produced, as well as original storylines set in the gap between ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' and ''Horror of Fang Rock''. Leela has also appeared in several [[Past Doctor Adventures]], including four novels by [[Chris Boucher]] pairing her with the Fourth Doctor, whom she also appears with in [[Phillip Reeve]]'s 2013 short story \"The Roots of Evil\" (which sees the Fourth Doctor and Leela deal with the aftermath of a situation created by the [[Eleventh Doctor]]).\n\nSeemingly surviving the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], Leela features in a trilogy of ''[[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#The Companion Chronicles|Companion Chronicles]]'' audio stories in which she ages a year per day without the Time Lords. In ''[[The Catalyst (Doctor Who audio)|The Catalyst]]'', an elderly Leela is interrogated by a Z'Nai warrior to learn what secrets she may know of a legendary \"lost world\" (presumably Gallifrey), and tells stories of her past to a child imprisoned in the room. In her final audio, ''[[The Time Vampire]]'', she recalls how K9 flew into the Time Vortex and she had a vision of an \"ancient\" woman. Once her tale is told and she feels ready to die, K9 suddenly appears before her, frees her and guides her soul to its next stage.\n\nIn 2017, Jameson appeared as Leela alongside [[John Hurt]] as the [[War Doctor]], the [[Retroactive continuity|retroactive]] 'ninth' Doctor who fought in the Time War, in the [[The War Doctor (audio drama series)|''War Doctor'' audio series]]. In this audio, Leela is stated to have been lost in an early battle in the Time War, but was actually struck by a Disruptor Dalek, intended to erase her from all alternate timelines, only for unspecified factors \u2013 hinted to be Leela's strength of will \u2013 to draw Leela back to this universe, but now forced to endure the memories of every possible alternate path her life might have taken and no way to determine which one is true. After helping Leela seal a dimensional rift, the War Doctor is able to use the TARDIS to bring Leela's memories back into order.<ref>{{cite serial |title=[[The War Doctor (audio drama series)|The War Doctor]]: The Lady of Obsidian |episode= |url= |series=Doctor Who: Special Releases |serieslink=List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#The War Doctor|first=Andrew (writer) |last=Smith|authorlink=Andrew Smith (Doctor Who writer) |first2=Nicholas (director) |last2=Briggs |authorlink2=Nicholas Briggs |network= |station= |publisher=[[Big Finish Productions]] |city= |date=February 2017 |season= |number= |minutes= |transcript= |transcripturl=}}</ref>\n\nLater in 2017, Jameson as Leela appeared in the Fifth Doctor audio ''[[Time in Office]]''; when the Fifth Doctor is recalled to Gallifrey to take on the role as President to stabilize Gallifrey's tenuous political situation after [[Borusa]]'s deceptions (\"[[The Five Doctors]]\"), Leela assists his current companion [[Tegan Jovanka]] in finding a loophole that allows her to stay on Gallifrey with him, essentially acting as the Doctor's bodyguard and advisor until he returns to his travels.\n\n==Characterisation==\n\n===Conception===\nThe character of Leela was first conceived by producer [[Philip Hinchcliffe]] and script editor [[Robert Holmes (scriptwriter)|Robert Holmes]]. They wanted a companion in the mould of [[George Bernard Shaw|George Bernard Shaw's]] [[Pygmalion (play)|Eliza Doolittle]]: a bright but unsophisticated primitive who would learn from the Doctor.  Writer [[Chris Boucher]] had submitted a story proposal titled ''The Mentor Conspiracy'' which featured a character named Leela, fitting Hinchcliffe's and Holmes's ideas.\n\nAlthough ''The Mentor Conspiracy'' was not produced, Boucher reused the character of Leela for ''The Day God Went Mad'' (later renamed to ''The Face of Evil''), seeing her as a mixture of [[Emma Peel]] from ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' and Leila Khaled.<ref>{{cite news |first=Katharine |last=Viner |title='I made the ring from a bullet and the pin of a hand grenade' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,428510,00.html |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2001-10-26 |accessdate=2007-03-18 }}</ref> Boucher was asked to write two endings to ''Face'', one in which Leela left with the Doctor, and one in which  she stayed behind.  The decision to have Leela become a companion was made soon after. An oft-repeated story (also stated in the DVD commentary to ''[[The Robots of Death]]'') is that Leela's skimpy leather outfits were very popular with the \"dads\", which kept them watching the programme.\n\n===Casting===\nAccording to the official DVD release of the story ''The Face of Evil'' in 2012,<ref>Doctor Who: The Face of Evil. BBC DVD/2Entertain. {{ISBN|0-7806-8517-2}}</ref> [[Louise Jameson]] won the role of Leela over 26 other hopeful actresses auditioned between 10 and 25 August 1976. [[Emily Richard]] was producer [[Philip Hinchcliffe]]'s first choice, but when she proved unavailable, [[Celia Foxe]], [[Colette Gleeson]], [[Elaine Donnelly (actress)|Elaine Donnelly]], [[Gail Grainger]], [[Belinda Sinclair]], [[Ann Pennington (model)|Ann Pennington]], [[Sally Geeson]], [[Pamela Salem]], [[Carol Leader]], [[Heather Tobias]], [[Marilyn Galsworthy]], [[Katherine Fahey]], Deborah Fairfax, [[Irene Gorst]], [[Kay Korda]], Lois Hantz, [[Belinda Low]], [[Gail Harrison]], [[Michelle Newell]], Philippa Vazey, [[Sue Jones-Davies]], [[Lydia Lisel]], [[Janet Edis]], [[Susan Wooldridge]] and [[Carol Drinkwater]] were all seen for the part. The latter five actresses were shortlisted with Louise Jameson and all recalled. Auditions took place in batches of eight actresses, with Jameson amongst the first batch. As [[Tom Baker]] was not available for her audition, director [[Pennant Roberts]] played the part of the Doctor. Jameson was given the role on 26 August 1976. Despite not being on the final shortlist, Pamela Salem won a small voice role in Leela's debut story, ''[[The Face of Evil]]'',<ref>https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/doctor-who-the-nearly-leelas/</ref> followed by a substantial part in the next story ''[[The Robots of Death]]''.\n\nAlthough Jameson's eyes are naturally blue, as Leela she initially wore red [[contact lens]]es to make them brown. However, the contact lenses severely limited her vision, and producer [[Graham Williams (television producer)|Graham Williams]] promised her she could stop wearing them. To explain the change in-story, writer [[Terrance Dicks]] wrote a scene in the 1977 serial ''[[Horror of Fang Rock]]'' in which Leela's eyes suffer \"pigment dispersal\" and turn blue after viewing the explosion of the [[Rutan Host|Rutan]] ship.\n\n[[Tom Baker]] disliked Leela's character concept because he felt that she was too violent.<ref name=\"30Years\">{{cite book|last=Rigelsford|first=Adrian|title=The Doctors: 30 Years of Time Travel|publisher=Boxtree|location=London|year=1994|chapter=The Vortex of Immensity|isbn=0-7522-0959-0|page=111}}</ref>  Jameson reports that he was cold to her for the first several stories they did together.<ref name=\"FangRock\">{{cite video| people = Jameson, Louise (Episode commentary)| title = Horror of Fang Rock| medium = DVD| publisher = BBC DVD|date = 2005}}</ref> Eventually, during the filming of ''Horror of Fang Rock'', she insisted on multiple takes of a scene in which he repeatedly entered the scene early, thereby upstaging her.

Leela was a [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] of the [[Fourth Doctor]] and a regular in the programme from 1977 to 1978. Writer [[Chris Boucher]] named her after the Palestinian hijacker [[Leila Khaled]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaldorcity.com/people/cbinterview_1992.html|title=1992 Interview with Chris Boucher|publisher=}}</ref> Leela appeared in 9 stories (40 episodes).\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Television===\nLeela was the daughter of Sole. She first appears in the 1977 serial ''[[The Face of Evil]]''. She is a warrior of the savage Sevateem tribe, who were amongst the descendants of the crew of an [[Earth]] starship from The Mordee Expedition that crash-landed on an unnamed planet in the far future. The tribe's name is a corruption of \"survey team\". The Doctor at this point was content to travel alone, but Leela barged into the [[TARDIS]] and continued to accompany him on his journeys.\n\nThough a primitive, Leela was highly intelligent, grasping advanced concepts easily and translating them into terms she could cope with. Despite the Doctor's attempts at \"civilizing\" her, Leela was strong-willed enough to continue in her ways. She usually dressed in animal skins, and was armed with a knife or a set of poisonous Janis thorns, which she did not hesitate to use on people who threatened her, much to the Doctor's disapproval.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/companions/page20.shtml|title=BBC - Doctor Who - Classic Series  - Companions - Leela|publisher=}}</ref> She often demonstrated a highly accurate sense of danger.\n\nIn her travels with the Doctor, Leela faced [[The Robots of Death|killer robots]], [[Talons of Weng-Chiang|murderous homunculi]], [[Horror of Fang Rock|the Rutan Host]], and the [[Sontaran]] invasion of the Doctor's home planet of [[Gallifrey]]. During this final adventure, ''[[The Invasion of Time]]'', she meets and falls in love with Andred, a native Gallifreyan, and decides to stay behind to be with him. The first [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]] remains with her.<ref>http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2011/07/a-companion-to-the-doctors-companions-leela</ref> This exit for her character was created after Jameson announced her intention to leave the show.\n\nFollowing her departure she was mentioned in the series on two subsequent occasions. In [[Full Circle (Doctor Who)|Full Circle]], when the Doctor believes he has returned to Gallifrey, he admits, \"I'm so looking forward to seeing how Leela and Andred are getting on\". When he finally does arrive on Gallifrey in [[Arc of Infinity]], he asks after her: \"Tell me, what of my former companion Leela?\" The Doctor is told she is \"well and very happy\", to which he responds \"I was so sorry to miss her wedding\".\n\n===Other media===\nLouise Jameson reprised the role of Leela on screen in the 1993 charity special ''[[Dimensions in Time]]''.\n\nLeela's life on Gallifrey has been explored in various [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media. In the [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel ''[[Lungbarrow]]'', by Marc Platt, Leela and Andred are expecting a child, the first naturally conceived baby on Gallifrey for millennia. When the Doctor learns this, he asks her to name it after him; Platt explained that this was meant to suggest a [[time loop]] in which the hybrid child goes on to become [[The Other (Doctor Who)|the Other]] and subsequently the Doctor, explaining his half-human parentage in the 1996 TV film.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=Benjamin | date=31 May 2001 |title=The Fall of the Gold House of Usher |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=305 |page=30}}</ref>\n\nJameson has voiced the character in six series of [[Big Finish Productions]] audio plays set on Gallifrey, alongside [[Lalla Ward]] as [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] and [[John Leeson]] as K-9. In the [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#Gallifrey|''Gallifrey'' audio series]], Leela acts as Romana's bodyguard, advisor and friend. Being in the presence of Time Lord biology extends Leela's lifespan, keeping her relatively youthful. However, if she ever left them, she would quickly age to death. In ''Gallifrey'', Leela and Andred separate after Andred fakes his death to infiltrate the Celestial Intervention Agency (he regenerates and impersonates a man who attempted to kill him, not considering how his actions would affect Leela). Andred is subsequently killed and Leela is blinded during a Gallifreyan civil war, which also results in her version of K9 (the original) being destroyed. She is then taken out of time, to avoid her perishing with the rest of Gallifrey. She follows Romana through several alternative universes, regaining vision in one eye by ingesting vampire blood, her unique physiology allowing her to be physically enhanced by it without experiencing the negative mental side effects. She eventually returns to her original universe with Romana in time to save their Gallifrey.\n\nIn 2011, Leela joined the cast of the second series of ''[[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#Jago .26 Litefoot|Jago & Litefoot]]'', where she is sent by Romana to investigate breaks in time in Victorian London. The same year, Jameson reprised the role of Leela alongside Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor for a series of audio dramas for Big Finish. These dramas began to be released in January 2012 and are adaptations of stories planned for the TV but never produced, as well as original storylines set in the gap between ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' and ''Horror of Fang Rock''. Leela has also appeared in several [[Past Doctor Adventures]], including four novels by [[Chris Boucher]] pairing her with the Fourth Doctor, whom she also appears with in [[Phillip Reeve]]'s 2013 short story \"The Roots of Evil\" (which sees the Fourth Doctor and Leela deal with the aftermath of a situation created by the [[Eleventh Doctor]]).\n\nSeemingly surviving the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], Leela features in a trilogy of ''[[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#The Companion Chronicles|Companion Chronicles]]'' audio stories in which she ages a year per day without the Time Lords. In ''[[The Catalyst (Doctor Who audio)|The Catalyst]]'', an elderly Leela is interrogated by a Z'Nai warrior to learn what secrets she may know of a legendary \"lost world\" (presumably Gallifrey), and tells stories of her past to a child imprisoned in the room. In her final audio, ''[[The Time Vampire]]'', she recalls how K9 flew into the Time Vortex and she had a vision of an \"ancient\" woman. Once her tale is told and she feels ready to die, K9 suddenly appears before her, frees her and guides her soul to its next stage.\n\nIn 2017, Jameson appeared as Leela alongside [[John Hurt]] as the [[War Doctor]], the [[Retroactive continuity|retroactive]] 'ninth' Doctor who fought in the Time War, in the [[The War Doctor (audio drama series)|''War Doctor'' audio series]]. In this audio, Leela is stated to have been lost in an early battle in the Time War, but was actually struck by a Disruptor Dalek, intended to erase her from all alternate timelines, only for unspecified factors \u2013 hinted to be Leela's strength of will \u2013 to draw Leela back to this universe, but now forced to endure the memories of every possible alternate path her life might have taken and no way to determine which one is true. After helping Leela seal a dimensional rift, the War Doctor is able to use the TARDIS to bring Leela's memories back into order.<ref>{{cite serial |title=[[The War Doctor (audio drama series)|The War Doctor]]: The Lady of Obsidian |episode= |url= |series=Doctor Who: Special Releases |serieslink=List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#The War Doctor|first=Andrew (writer) |last=Smith|authorlink=Andrew Smith (Doctor Who writer) |first2=Nicholas (director) |last2=Briggs |authorlink2=Nicholas Briggs |network= |station= |publisher=[[Big Finish Productions]] |city= |date=February 2017 |season= |number= |minutes= |transcript= |transcripturl=}}</ref>\n\nLater in 2017, Jameson as Leela appeared in the Fifth Doctor audio ''[[Time in Office]]''; when the Fifth Doctor is recalled to Gallifrey to take on the role as President to stabilize Gallifrey's tenuous political situation after [[Borusa]]'s deceptions (\"[[The Five Doctors]]\"), Leela assists his current companion [[Tegan Jovanka]] in finding a loophole that allows her to stay on Gallifrey with him, essentially acting as the Doctor's bodyguard and advisor until he returns to his travels.\n\n==Characterisation==\n\n===Conception===\nThe character of Leela was first conceived by producer [[Philip Hinchcliffe]] and script editor [[Robert Holmes (scriptwriter)|Robert Holmes]]. They wanted a companion in the mould of [[George Bernard Shaw|George Bernard Shaw's]] [[Pygmalion (play)|Eliza Doolittle]]: a bright but unsophisticated primitive who would learn from the Doctor.  Writer [[Chris Boucher]] had submitted a story proposal titled ''The Mentor Conspiracy'' which featured a character named Leela, fitting Hinchcliffe's and Holmes's ideas.\n\nAlthough ''The Mentor Conspiracy'' was not produced, Boucher reused the character of Leela for ''The Day God Went Mad'' (later renamed to ''The Face of Evil''), seeing her as a mixture of [[Emma Peel]] from ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' and Leila Khaled.<ref>{{cite news |first=Katharine |last=Viner |title='I made the ring from a bullet and the pin of a hand grenade' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,428510,00.html |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2001-10-26 |accessdate=2007-03-18 }}</ref> Boucher was asked to write two endings to ''Face'', one in which Leela left with the Doctor, and one in which  she stayed behind.  The decision to have Leela become a companion was made soon after. An oft-repeated story (also stated in the DVD commentary to ''[[The Robots of Death]]'') is that Leela's skimpy leather outfits were very popular with the \"dads\", which kept them watching the programme.\n\n===Casting===\nAccording to the official DVD release of the story ''The Face of Evil'' in 2012,<ref>Doctor Who: The Face of Evil. BBC DVD/2Entertain. {{ISBN|0-7806-8517-2}}</ref> [[Louise Jameson]] won the role of Leela over 26 other hopeful actresses auditioned between 10 and 25 August 1976. [[Emily Richard]] was producer [[Philip Hinchcliffe]]'s first choice, but when she proved unavailable, [[Celia Foxe]], [[Colette Gleeson]], [[Elaine Donnelly (actress)|Elaine Donnelly]], [[Gail Grainger]], [[Belinda Sinclair]], [[Ann Pennington (model)|Ann Pennington]], [[Sally Geeson]], [[Pamela Salem]], [[Carol Leader]], [[Heather Tobias]], [[Marilyn Galsworthy]], [[Katherine Fahey]], Deborah Fairfax, [[Irene Gorst]], [[Kay Korda]], Lois Hantz, [[Belinda Low]], [[Gail Harrison]], [[Michelle Newell]], Philippa Vazey, [[Sue Jones-Davies]], [[Lydia Lisel]], [[Janet Edis]], [[Susan Wooldridge]] and [[Carol Drinkwater]] were all seen for the part. The latter five actresses were shortlisted with Louise Jameson and all recalled. Auditions took place in batches of eight actresses, with Jameson amongst the first batch. As [[Tom Baker]] was not available for her audition, director [[Pennant Roberts]] played the part of the Doctor. Jameson was given the role on 26 August 1976. Despite not being on the final shortlist, Pamela Salem won a small voice role in Leela's debut story, ''[[The Face of Evil]]'',<ref>https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/doctor-who-the-nearly-leelas/</ref> followed by a substantial part in the next story ''[[The Robots of Death]]''.\n\nAlthough Jameson's eyes are naturally blue, as Leela she initially wore red [[contact lens]]es to make them brown. However, the contact lenses severely limited her vision, and producer [[Graham Williams (television producer)|Graham Williams]] promised her she could stop wearing them. To explain the change in-story, writer [[Terrance Dicks]] wrote a scene in the 1977 serial ''[[Horror of Fang Rock]]'' in which Leela's eyes suffer \"pigment dispersal\" and turn blue after viewing the explosion of the [[Rutan Host|Rutan]] ship.\n\n[[Tom Baker]] disliked Leela's character concept because he felt that she was too violent.<ref name=\"30Years\">{{cite book|last=Rigelsford|first=Adrian|title=The Doctors: 30 Years of Time Travel|publisher=Boxtree|location=London|year=1994|chapter=The Vortex of Immensity|isbn=0-7522-0959-0|page=111}}</ref>  Jameson reports that he was cold to her for the first several stories they did together.<ref name=\"FangRock\">{{cite video| people = Jameson, Louise (Episode commentary)| title = Horror of Fang Rock| medium = DVD| publisher = BBC DVD|date = 2005}}</ref> Eventually, during the filming of ''Horror of Fang Rock'', she insisted on multiple takes of a scene in which he repeatedly entered the scene early, thereby upstaging her.

The 2020 championship was canceled due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=bettersay /><ref name=wisconsinsay /><ref name=cornellsay />\n\n==Origins==\nThe NCAA Championship of Women's Ice Hockey began in 2001, although several universities had had women's teams established since the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1965, the first collegiate women's ice hockey team in the United States was created at [[Brown University]]. In February 1966, the team, named the \"Pembroke Pandas\", played its first match. Their opponents were the Walpole Brooms, a non-collegiate team. The women's ice hockey program of [[Cornell University]] began in 1971. The Big Red team competed in its first match in 1972, which it won 4\u20133, against Scarborough. In 1972, they played eight matches and lost half, including two defeats against the Pembroke Pandas. [[Yale University]] made its debut in women's hockey on December 9, 1975. The [[University of Minnesota-Duluth]], the [[University of New Hampshire]], and the rest [[Ivy League]] have similar histories.<ref name=\"Michael McKinley 2006, pp 237\">Michael McKinley, Hockey A People's History, McClelland & Stewart ltd 2006, pp 237\u2013238. {{ISBN|978-0-7710-5769-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Brown University would host the first ever Ivy League women's ice hockey tournament. Competitors in the tournament included Princeton, Yale, and Cornell, which won the tournament. Women's ice hockey continued growth and acceptance continued through the early 1980s.<ref name=\"Michael McKinley 2006, pp 237\"/> In 1984, the [[Providence Friars]] won the inaugural [[ECAC Hockey|ECAC]] women's ice hockey championship.\n\nIn the 1997\u201398 season, the American Women's College Hockey Alliance (AWCHA) made its debut. It was financed by the [[United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee|United States Olympic Committee]].<ref>[http://hometeamsonline.com/teams/default.asp?u=AKGIRLS&t=c&s=hockey&p=custom&pagename=About%20GirlsWomens%27%20Hockey About Girls/Womens' (sic) Hockey]</ref> This allowed for the first national women's ice hockey championship to occur, which was won by New Hampshire. The 1997\u201398 season also saw the creation of the [[Patty Kazmaier Award]], designed to recognize the most remarkable women's collegiate ice hockey player every season. The AWCHA also conducted championships in 1999 and 2000, which were won by Harvard and Minnesota respectively.\n\nDuring the 1999\u20132000 season, [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association|WCHA]] joined the ECAC in an attempt to make women's ice hockey an NCAA sanctioned sport. In August 2000, the [[NCAA]] announced that it would set up a national division of women's ice hockey with a national championship at the end of every season, starting with the 2000\u201301 season. The [[Minnesota\u2013Duluth Bulldogs women's ice hockey|Minnesota\u2013Duluth Bulldogs]] won the inaugural tournament and, by extension, championship 4\u20132 against the [[St. Lawrence Skating Saints women's ice hockey|St. Lawrence Skating Saints]].\n\n==NCAA Division I Women's Ice Hockey==\n{{main|NCAA Division I Women's Hockey conferences and teams}}\nIn all, 41 schools in the United States, ranging from the Midwest to the East Coast, sponsor varsity women's hockey at the National Collegiate (Divisions I and II) level. Five National Collegiate conferences are currently recognized by the NCAA\u2014[[College Hockey America]], [[ECAC Hockey]], [[Hockey East]], [[New England Women's Hockey Alliance]], and the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]].\n\nWith a 30+ game schedule, competing for conference and national championships, NCAA Division I women's hockey has a demanding and challenging season.\n\n==Format==\nUnder NCAA rules, Division II schools are allowed to compete as Division I members in sports that offer championships only in Divisions I and III.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D111.pdf |title=Bylaw 20.4.1.2 Divisions II and III Members\u2014Classification of a Sport in Division I |work=2010\u201311 NCAA Division I Manual |publisher=NCAA |format=PDF |page=333 |accessdate=October 6, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D111.pdf |title=Bylaw 20.8.2 Division II Options When No Division II Championship Is Conducted |work=2010\u201311 NCAA Division I Manual |publisher=NCAA |format=PDF |page=338 |accessdate=October 6, 2010}}</ref> As there is no Division II championship for women's ice hockey, this rule applies to the tournament. The official name of the \"Division I\" tournament is the '''National Collegiate Women's Ice Hockey Championship''', which reflects the NCAA's formal terminology for championship events that are open to schools from multiple divisions.\n\nThis tournament is a [[single elimination]] competition of eight teams. The semi-finals and finals are called the \"Women's Frozen Four.\" This moniker is similar to the name used by the [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship]]. The term is derived from the term \"[[Final four]].\"\n\nThe [[Patty Kazmaier Award]] ceremony takes place annually during Women's Frozen Four weekend.\n\n==History==\nAlthough many schools from many conferences have been competitive, the first 13 championships were won by only three different schools all originating from the WCHA: Minnesota-Duluth, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. In 2014, the WCHA's hold on the championship was finally broken when Clarkson defeated Minnesota. The ECAC, from which Clarkson originated, has easily been the second most competitive conference, with appearances in eight national title games, including the first five. [[Hockey East]] has had three title game appearances, twice by Boston University and once by Boston College, and [[College Hockey America|CHA]] has had one title appearance, by Mercyhurst in 2009. The 2020 championship was cancelled due to the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic|ongoing coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=bettersay>https://www.theicegarden.com/2020/3/12/21177404/ncaa-womens-hockey-national-tournament-canceled-covid-19-coronavirus</ref><ref name=wisconsinsay>https://madison.com/wsj/sports/college/hockey/after-season-ends-in-ncaa-cancellation-badgers-women-s-hockey/article_28d1649b-cc2f-5e0b-a8ab-a146d1037900.html</ref><ref name=cornellsay>https://cornellsun.com/2020/03/12/ncaa-cancels-hockey-tournaments-ending-top-ranked-cornell-hockey-teams-seasons/</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|'''Year'''||'''Champion'''||'''Score'''||'''Runner-up'''||'''City'''||'''Arena'''\n|-\n|[[2001 NCAA Division I Women's Ice Hockey Tournament|2001]]||[[Minnesota\u2013Duluth Bulldogs women's ice hockey|Minnesota\u2013Duluth]] ||4\u20132||[[St. Lawrence Saints women's ice hockey|St. Lawrence]]||[[Minneapolis|Minneapolis, MN]]||[[Mariucci Arena]]\n|-\n|[[2002 NCAA Division I Women's Ice Hockey Tournament|2002]]||[[Minnesota\u2013Duluth Bulldogs women's ice hockey|Minnesota\u2013Duluth (2)]]||3\u20132||[[Brown Bears women's ice hockey|Brown]]||[[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham, NH]]||[[Whittemore Center]]\n|-\n|[[2003 NCAA Division I Women's Ice Hockey Tournament|2003]]||[[Minnesota\u2013Duluth Bulldogs women's ice hockey|Minnesota\u2013Duluth (3)]]||4\u20133 <small>(2OT)</small>||[[Harvard Crimson women's ice hockey|Harvard]]||[[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth, MN]]||[[Duluth Entertainment Convention Center|DECC Arena]]\n|-\n|[[2004 NCAA Division I Women's Ice Hockey Tournament|2004]]||[[Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey|Minnesota]]||6\u20132||[[Harvard Crimson women's ice hockey|Harvard]]||[[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence, RI]]||[[Dunkin' Donuts Center]] \n|-\n|[[2005 NCAA Division I Women's Ice Hockey Tournament|2005]]||[[Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey|Minnesota (2)]]||4\u20133||[[Harvard Crimson women's ice hockey|Harvard]]||Durham, NH||Whittemore Center\n|-\n|[[2006 NCAA Division I Women's Ice Hockey Tournament|2006]]||[[Wisconsin Badgers women's ice hockey|Wisconsin]]||3\u20130||[[Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey|Minnesota]]||Minneapolis, MN||Mariucci Arena\n|-\n|[[2007 NCAA Division I Women's Ice Hockey Tournament|2007]]||[[Wisconsin Badgers women's ice hockey|Wisconsin (2)]]|| 4\u20131 ||[[Minnesota\u2013Duluth Bulldogs women's ice hockey|Minnesota\u2013Duluth]]||[[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid, NY]]||[[Herb Brooks Arena]]\n|-\n|[[2008 NCAA Division I Women's Ice Hockey Tournament|2008]]||[[Minnesota\u2013Duluth Bulldogs women's ice hockey|Minnesota\u2013Duluth (4)]]|| 4\u20130 ||[[Wisconsin Badgers women's ice hockey|Wisconsin]]||Duluth, MN||DECC Arena\n|-\n|[[2009 NCAA Division I Women's Ice Hockey Tournament|2009]]||[[Wisconsin Badgers women's ice hockey|Wisconsin (3)]]|| 5\u20130 ||[[Mercyhurst Lakers women's ice hockey|Mercyhurst]]||[[Boston|Boston, MA]]||[[Agganis Arena]]\n|-\n|[[2010 NCAA Division I Women's Ice Hockey Tournament|2010]]||[[Minnesota\u2013Duluth Bulldogs women's ice hockey|Minnesota\u2013Duluth (5)]]|| 3\u20132 <small>(3OT)</small>|| [[Cornell Big Red women's ice hockey|Cornell]] ||Minneapolis, MN||[[Ridder Arena]]\n|-\n|[[2011 NCAA Division I Women's Ice Hockey Tournament|2011]]||[[Wisconsin Badgers women's ice hockey|Wisconsin (4)]]|| 4\u20131 || [[Boston University Terriers women's ice hockey|Boston University]] ||[[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie, PA]]||[[Erie Insurance Arena]]\n|-\n|[[2012 NCAA Division I Women's Ice Hockey Tournament|2012]]||[[Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey|Minnesota (3)]]|| 4\u20132 || [[Wisconsin Badgers women's ice hockey|Wisconsin]]||Duluth, MN||[[AMSOIL Arena]]\n|-\n|[[2013 NCAA Division I Women's Ice Hockey Tournament|2013]]||[[Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey|Minnesota (4)]]||6\u20133||[[Boston University Terriers women's ice hockey|Boston University]]||Minneapolis, MN||Ridder Arena\n|-\n|[[2014 NCAA Division I Women's Ice Hockey Tournament|2014]] || [[Clarkson Golden Knights women's ice hockey|Clarkson]] || 5\u20134 || [[Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey|Minnesota]]|| [[Hamden, Connecticut|Hamden, CT]] ||[[People's United Center]]\n|-\n|[[2015 NCAA National Collegiate Women's Ice Hockey Tournament|2015]] || [[Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey|Minnesota (5)]] || 4\u20131 || [[Harvard Crimson women's ice hockey|Harvard]]|| Minneapolis, MN || Ridder Arena<ref name=\"2015-2016-2017-2018\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.uscho.com/2013/12/11/boston-tampa-chicago-st-paul-get-upcoming-mens-frozen-fours/ |title=Boston, Tampa, Chicago, St. Paul get upcoming men\u2019s Frozen Fours |author=<!--Staff writer(s);

The 2020 championship was cancelled duo the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=bettersay /><ref name=wisconsinsay /><ref name=cornellsay />\n\n==Origins==\nThe NCAA Championship of Women's Ice Hockey began in 2001, although several universities had had women's teams established since the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1965, the first collegiate women's ice hockey team in the United States was created at [[Brown University]]. In February 1966, the team, named the \"Pembroke Pandas\", played its first match. Their opponents were the Walpole Brooms, a non-collegiate team. The women's ice hockey program of [[Cornell University]] began in 1971. The Big Red team competed in its first match in 1972, which it won 4\u20133, against Scarborough. In 1972, they played eight matches and lost half, including two defeats against the Pembroke Pandas. [[Yale University]] made its debut in women's hockey on December 9, 1975. The [[University of Minnesota-Duluth]], the [[University of New Hampshire]], and the rest [[Ivy League]] have similar histories.<ref name=\"Michael McKinley 2006, pp 237\">Michael McKinley, Hockey A People's History, McClelland & Stewart ltd 2006, pp 237\u2013238. {{ISBN|978-0-7710-5769-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Brown University would host the first ever Ivy League women's ice hockey tournament. Competitors in the tournament included Princeton, Yale, and Cornell, which won the tournament. Women's ice hockey continued growth and acceptance continued through the early 1980s.<ref name=\"Michael McKinley 2006, pp 237\"/> In 1984, the [[Providence Friars]] won the inaugural [[ECAC Hockey|ECAC]] women's ice hockey championship.\n\nIn the 1997\u201398 season, the American Women's College Hockey Alliance (AWCHA) made its debut. It was financed by the [[United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee|United States Olympic Committee]].<ref>[http://hometeamsonline.com/teams/default.asp?u=AKGIRLS&t=c&s=hockey&p=custom&pagename=About%20GirlsWomens%27%20Hockey About Girls/Womens' (sic) Hockey]</ref> This allowed for the first national women's ice hockey championship to occur, which was won by New Hampshire. The 1997\u201398 season also saw the creation of the [[Patty Kazmaier Award]], designed to recognize the most remarkable women's collegiate ice hockey player every season. The AWCHA also conducted championships in 1999 and 2000, which were won by Harvard and Minnesota respectively.\n\nDuring the 1999\u20132000 season, [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association|WCHA]] joined the ECAC in an attempt to make women's ice hockey an NCAA sanctioned sport. In August 2000, the [[NCAA]] announced that it would set up a national division of women's ice hockey with a national championship at the end of every season, starting with the 2000\u201301 season. The [[Minnesota\u2013Duluth Bulldogs women's ice hockey|Minnesota\u2013Duluth Bulldogs]] won the inaugural tournament and, by extension, championship 4\u20132 against the [[St. Lawrence Skating Saints women's ice hockey|St. Lawrence Skating Saints]].\n\n==NCAA Division I Women's Ice Hockey==\n{{main|NCAA Division I Women's Hockey conferences and teams}}\nIn all, 41 schools in the United States, ranging from the Midwest to the East Coast, sponsor varsity women's hockey at the National Collegiate (Divisions I and II) level. Five National Collegiate conferences are currently recognized by the NCAA\u2014[[College Hockey America]], [[ECAC Hockey]], [[Hockey East]], [[New England Women's Hockey Alliance]], and the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]].\n\nWith a 30+ game schedule, competing for conference and national championships, NCAA Division I women's hockey has a demanding and challenging season.\n\n==Format==\nUnder NCAA rules, Division II schools are allowed to compete as Division I members in sports that offer championships only in Divisions I and III.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D111.pdf |title=Bylaw 20.4.1.2 Divisions II and III Members\u2014Classification of a Sport in Division I |work=2010\u201311 NCAA Division I Manual |publisher=NCAA |format=PDF |page=333 |accessdate=October 6, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D111.pdf |title=Bylaw 20.8.2 Division II Options When No Division II Championship Is Conducted |work=2010\u201311 NCAA Division I Manual |publisher=NCAA |format=PDF |page=338 |accessdate=October 6, 2010}}</ref> As there is no Division II championship for women's ice hockey, this rule applies to the tournament. The official name of the \"Division I\" tournament is the '''National Collegiate Women's Ice Hockey Championship''', which reflects the NCAA's formal terminology for championship events that are open to schools from multiple divisions.\n\nThis tournament is a [[single elimination]] competition of eight teams. The semi-finals and finals are called the \"Women's Frozen Four.\" This moniker is similar to the name used by the [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship]]. The term is derived from the term \"[[Final four]].\"\n\nThe [[Patty Kazmaier Award]] ceremony takes place annually during Women's Frozen Four weekend.\n\n==History==\nAlthough many schools from many conferences have been competitive, the first 13 championships were won by only three different schools all originating from the WCHA: Minnesota-Duluth, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. In 2014, the WCHA's hold on the championship was finally broken when Clarkson defeated Minnesota. The ECAC, from which Clarkson originated, has easily been the second most competitive conference, with appearances in eight national title games, including the first five. [[Hockey East]] has had three title game appearances, twice by Boston University and once by Boston College, and [[College Hockey America|CHA]] has had one title appearance, by Mercyhurst in 2009.

She returned a year later to Nicaragua for three years and published two books about the experience. The first, ''Death Dreams & Dancing in Nicaragua'', is a travel memoir which also provides a case study to demonstrate the importance of radio education for impoverished communities.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Arnove|first=Robert|title=Comparative Education: The Dialectic of the Global and the Local|publisher=Rowan & Littlefield|year=2013|isbn=978-1442217768|location=|pages=216}}</ref> Her second book, ''Dar la palabra al pueblo,'' was about teaching communication. Written in Spanish, it was published by the Iberoamericana Universidad, Mexico.  \n\nIn 1995, after returning to Australia, she co-authored the book ''Australians against racism: Testimonies from the anti-apartheid movement in Australia.'' In 2012 she co-authored a monograph, ''Journalism at the Speed of Bytes: Australian Newspapers in the 21st Century,'' about job losses among Australian journalists brought by the disruption of digital media. \n\nO'Donnell has co-presented submissions to Australian government inquiries into the media and journalism, including [[Raymond Finkelstein|Hon R Finklestein']]<nowiki/>s 2012 inquiry into media regulation, the 2017 Future of Public Interest Journalism Inquiry, and in 2018 the Select Committee on the Future of Work and Workers. \n\nO'Donnell is a member of:\n\n*[[International Communication Association]] (ICA)\n*International Association for Media and Communication Research (IAMCR)\n* Journalism Education and Research Association of Australia (JERAA)<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n<br />\n=== Australian Research Council ===\nO'Donnell was funded by the [[Australian Research Council]] (ARC) in 2009 as Lead Chief Investigator into the future of newspapers, along with Associate Professor David McKnight, from [[University of New South Wales]].
