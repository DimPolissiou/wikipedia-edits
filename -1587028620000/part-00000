This comparatively slow growth caused stockholders to complain that the company was not reaching profitability fast enough to justify their investment or even survive in the long-term. The [[dot-com bubble]] burst at the start of the 21st century and destroyed many e-companies in the process, but Amazon survived and moved forward beyond the tech crash to become a huge player in online sales. The company finally turned its first profit in the fourth quarter of 2001: $0.00 (i.e., 1\u00a2 per share), on revenues of more than $1 billion\n. This [[profit margin]], though extremely modest, proved to skeptics that Bezos' unconventional [[business model]] could succeed.<ref>{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Spector |title=Amazon.com: Get Big Fast |year=2002}}</ref>\n\n== 2010 to present ==\nIn 2011, Amazon had 30,000 full-time employees in the US, and by the end of 2016, it had 180,000 employees.\n\nIn 2014, Amazon launched its first ever smartphone, the [[Fire Phone]].  The Fire Phone was meant to deliver media streaming options but the venture failed, resulting in Amazon registering a $170 million loss.  This would also lead to the Fire Phone production being stopped the following year.  In August of the same year Amazon would finalize the acquisition of Twitch, a social video gaming streaming site for $970 million.  This new acquisition would be integrated to the game production division of Amazon.\n\n[[File:Day 1 Tower Seattle WA Jan 17.jpg|thumb|[[Day 1 (building)|Day 1 building]] in Seattle]]\nIn June 2017, Amazon announced that it would acquire [[Whole Foods]], a high-end [[supermarket]] [[chain store|chain]] with over 400 stores, for $13.4 billion.<ref name=\"WF\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/16/investing/amazon-buying-whole-foods/index.html |title=Amazon is buying Whole Foods for $13.7 billion |last1=La Monica |first1=Paul |last2=Isidore |first2=Chris |website=CNN Money |publisher=[[CNNMoney]] |accessdate=June 16, 2017}}</ref> The acquisition was seen by media experts as a move to strengthen its physical holdings and challenge [[Walmart]]'s supremacy as a brick and mortar retailer.
