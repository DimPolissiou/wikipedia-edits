It was founded in 1894 as the '''Elkhart Institute of Science, Industry and the Arts''', and is affiliated with [[Mennonite Church USA]]. The college is [[school accreditation|accredited]] by the ]]Higher Learning Commission]]. Goshen has an enrollment of 950 students.<ref name=\"GC Quick Facts\" /> While Goshen maintains a distinctive liberal Mennonite worldview, it admits students of all religions. [[Mennonite]]s make up 43 percent of the student body.<ref name=\"GC Quick Facts\" />\n\nGoshen College is home to ''[[The Mennonite Quarterly Review]]'' and the [[Mennonite Historical Library]], a research library compiling one of the world's most comprehensive collection of [[Anabaptist]] and Mennonite primary source material.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = American Historical Association| title = Mennonite Historical Library| encyclopedia = American Historical Association Archives Wiki| date = 2013-05-17| url = http://archiveswiki.historians.org/index.php/Mennonite_Historical_Library}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe history of Goshen College (or Goshen, as it is commonly known) is intertwined with that of the history of Mennonites in America,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} and so Goshen's history is best told in the context of this broader history.{{according to whom|date=August 2016}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} \"Old\" Mennonites had traditionally been suspicious of higher education, but by the late 19th century, opinion started to change.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Decades earlier, [[mainline Protestant]] church denominations had begun to found colleges across America, with the hope of developing well-trained clergy for their congregations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} As more \"Old\" Mennonites sent their children to other Christian colleges, they realized that, without a college of their own, many of their youth would leave the church.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Thus, prompted in part as a reaction to mainline Christianity, the \"Old\" Mennonites started the Elkhart Institute in [[Elkhart, Indiana]] in August 1894, to prepare Mennonite youth for college.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Today,{{when|date=April 2017}} Goshen is open to everyone, but this earlier vision and its historical relationship with the Mennonite Church remains visible: it is home to ''[[The Mennonite Quarterly Review]]'', [[Mennonite Historical Library]], [[Mennonite Church USA Archives]], including Mennonite Central Committee archives, offices of \"The Mennonite\", and it has numerous alumni connections with the broader Mennonite Church.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nGoshen was the first Mennonite school of higher education in North America to confer a four-year degree.{{according to whom|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}<ref>[[Bethel College (Kansas)|Bethel College]], which was incorporated in 1887 and opened at its present site in 1893, is older, but did not originally grant four-year degrees.{{Original research inline|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}</ref>  H.A. Mumaw, a practicing physician, first led the small operation; in 1894, a group of 15 \"Old\" Mennonite ministers and laymen started a corporation that they named the Elkhart Institute association.<ref>Schlabach, Theron F: ''Peace, Faith, Nation: Mennonites and Amish in Nineteenth Century America'', page 300. Herald Press, 1988</ref>  The first diploma was awarded in 1898.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Lured by businessmen to relocate several miles away to [[Goshen, Indiana]], the Institute moved in September 1903 and added a junior college course list, renaming itself Goshen College.{{when|date=April 2017}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} By 1906, the Mennonite Board of Education had taken control of the college, dissolving the Elkhart Institute Association.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} A complete college course was established in 1908, and the first Bachelor of Arts degrees were conferred in 1910.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} After 1910, most of Goshen's students were enrolled in college courses. From 1914 to 1919, partly out of response to its constituents, Goshen College attempted a \"School of Agriculture,\" which sought to prepare Mennonite young people to return to their rural communities; the hope was that such a program would spark a technological revolution among some of the farmers, but it was never a success and was cut after [[World War I]], five years after it began.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The college-prep academy program of Goshen College was discontinued in 1935.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe school was closed during the 1923\u20131924 school year by the Mennonite Board of Education but reopened the following year. One of many factors in closing the college was denominational tension due to [[Liberal Christianity|modernist]] and [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christian]] theologies of the 1920s and their impact on Mennonite theology at the school.<ref>Juhnke, James C: ''Vision, Doctrine, War: Mennonite Identity and Organization in America 1890\u20131930'', page 128. Herald Press, 1989</ref> In response to this crisis, many of Goshen's faculty and dozens of students, angry with the Mennonite Board of Education's decision, relocated to [[Bluffton University|Bluffton College]]. As part of the larger ongoing reaction against liberalism through the early 20th century, [[Hesston College]] and [[Eastern Mennonite University|Eastern Mennonite School]] were formed among \"Old\" Mennonites, although staunch traditionalists realized that no higher education was particularly safe.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nWhen the institution was reopened, it was marked by the new leadership of president [[Sanford Calvin Yoder|S.C. Yoder]] and dean [[Harold S. Bender|Noah Oyer,]] who manifested outstanding abilities. His character was one marked by simplicity, modesty, and refinement, as well as unusual wisdom and insight. Under his leadership the educational program of the College developed rapidly, and much of the strength of the present college program is due to his untiring and wise endeavors. After dean Oyer\u2019s untimely passing in 1931, Harold Bender became dean. He was a man whose influence upon the \"Old\" Mennonites was significant for much of the 20th century. Bender carefully piloted the stormy waters of theology by stating that [[Mennonitism]] was not [[liberalism]]. Bender later went on to say that [[fundamentalism]] also contributed to problems with theology and created ''[[The Anabaptist Vision]]'', a \"third way\" that sought to spell out the direction for the future Mennonite Church. More than arguing doctrine, Bender and a younger group of intellectuals at Goshen College sought to shape the Mennonite faith that was more ideological than institutional. The goal was to articulate a faith that could stand the test of academic scrutiny in broader society while carefully upholding traditional beliefs of the church. Out of this ideology, Bender started ''[[The Mennonite Quarterly Review]]''. Throughout this time, Goshen remained the epicenter of \"Old\" Mennonite theology and higher education, and became known as the \"Goshen Historical Renaissance\".<ref>Toews, Paul: ''Mennonites in American Society, 1930\u20131970: Modernity and the Persistence of Religious Community'', page 88. Herald Press, 1996</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s, Goshen was one of the [[Mennonite Central Committee]]'s key places to form a \"relief training school\" that helped to train volunteers for unpaid jobs in the [[Civilian Public Service]], an alternative to the Army. Many Mennonites chose the civilian service alternative because of their beliefs regarding Biblical pacifism and nonresistance.  Although the young women pacifists were not liable to the draft, they volunteered for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs to demonstrate their patriotism; many worked in mental hospitals.<ref>Rachel Waltner Goossen, ''Women Against the Good War: Conscientious Objection and Gender on the American Home Front, 1941\u20131947'' (1997) pp 98-111</ref>\n\nIn 1980, the college was granted care of [[Merry Lea Environmental Center|Merry Lea Environmental Learning Center]], a {{convert|1150|acre|km2|adj=mid}} nature preserve that now offers Goshen's master's degree in Environmental Science.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 1993, Harold and Wilma Good, longtime friends of the college, left their estate to Goshen. The estate was estimated at roughly $28 million, the majority in stock of the [[Smuckers|J.M. Smucker Company]]. Wilma was a daughter of the company's founder. The college sold the stock and added the funds to its endowment, more than doubling it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mennoweekly.org/JUNE/06-19-06/ENDOWMENTS06-19.html |title=Mennonite college endowments lag behind |publisher=Mennonite Weekly Review |year=2006 |accessdate=2008-03-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021020/http://www.mennoweekly.org/JUNE/06-19-06/ENDOWMENTS06-19.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe campus experienced a building boom in the later half of the 1990s through the present, with an estimated $30 million in new or renovated structures on campus. This included the addition of the Roman Gingerich Recreation-Fitness Center, the Music Center, the Connector, and the renovation of all dormitories. The college is currently working on a new campus master plan and strategic plan that will define the college's priorities for the years ahead. Today, more than 20,000 Goshen College alumni have been counted, residing in more than 85 countries. The Goshen campus has flourished from less than {{convert|50|acre|m2}} to {{convert|135|acre|km2}} with 18 major buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goshen.edu/aboutgc/history.php |title=History of Goshen College |publisher=Goshen College |accessdate=2008-03-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225641/http://www.goshen.edu/aboutgc/history.php |archivedate=2007-09-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Academics ==\nGoshen College offers 41 majors and 47 minors for undergraduates.<ref name=\"Majors and Minors\">{{cite web|title=Majors and Minors|url=http://www.goshen.edu/academics/majors-minors/|publisher=Goshen College|accessdate=4 October 2011}}</ref>  Some of the most popular programs are nursing, biology, business, communication, education, [[American Sign Language]] and environmental science.

To fulfill the requirement, students will either spend a semester abroad or complete an intercultural experience in the [[United States]].  Goshen College's ''Study-Service Term'' (SST) is a program which approximately 80 percent of students participate in to complete their intercultural study requirement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goshen.edu/sst/intercultural-requirement/|title=Study-Service Term \u2013 Intercultural Requirement|publisher=Goshen College|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}</ref> Students typically study the language and culture for six weeks, usually in the capital city, then do some sort of service work in a more remote area for the remaining six weeks.

CAC also hosts \"Hour After\" shows, where talented students on campus perform music, comedy, or dancing for the audience.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==== International students ====\nThe International Students Club (ISC) hosts the Coffeehouse every year, an event during which international students demonstrate their artistic talents. Students are also given the opportunity, through Global Citizenship, to individually talk about their culture, and have it published by the Goshen College newspaper.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==== Intramural athletics ====\nIntramural athletics are also offered.  Throughout the year, students can participate in the coed sports of outdoor soccer, volleyball, sand volleyball, kickball, touch football, ultimate frisbee, and wiffleball, as well as basketball, indoor soccer, and 3-on-3 basketball.<ref>{{cite web|title=Intramurals|url=https://www.goshen.edu/campuslife/intramurals/|website=Goshen College|publisher=Goshen College|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Media ===\n\nGoshen College has its own school newspaper, ''The Record'' and its own radio station, [[WGCS]], branded as 91.1FM The Globe. On March 12, 2011, The Globe was named the Best College Station in the Nation, winning first place at the 71st Annual Conference of the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (IBS) in New York City. On March 2, 2013, The Globe was again named Best College Station in the Nation, making it the first college to win the award twice. Since then, 91.1 the Globe has been awarded \"Radio Station of the Year\" by the Indiana Association of State Broadcasters six time, their most recent in March of 2020.\nGlobe Media also produces a monthly news show, \"The Globe News Report\", which covers campus and community news, along with a weekly sports show, \"The Globe Sports Corner\", covering Goshen College Athletics. It has also been involved in several larger projects, including the broadcast of the school's annual Festival of Carols on [[WNIT (TV)|WNIT]]. In the summer of 2011, the Goshen College communication department launched FiveCore Media, a video production company aimed at providing services for both on-campus and off-campus clients. Globe Media also produces a weekly sports show, \"The Globe Sports Corner\", featuring athlete and coaches interviews, along with an in-depth story highlighting athletes and teams across campus.\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n[[File:Goshen College Music Center.JPG|thumb|250px|left|The Goshen College Music Center]]\nGoshen College students have a variety of shows to attend in the Music Center's Sauder Concert Hall or Rieth Recital Hall or the Umble Center, Goshen's theater. With the addition of the Music Center to campus, the college has offered a Performing Arts Series of nationally renowned artists from across the country. Previous guests include [[Garrison Keillor]] and [[A Prairie Home Companion]], [[Indigo Girls]], [[The Wailin' Jennys]], [[Nickel Creek]], [[Colm Wilkinson]], [[Chanticleer (ensemble)|Chanticleer]], [[Canadian Brass]], [[Tokyo String Quartet]], [[Seraphic Fire]], and [[Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra]] with [[Wynton Marsalis]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n=== Spiritual life ===\nBecause Goshen is a Christian college, spirituality plays an important part of campus life.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}  Although Goshen maintains that people of different faiths are welcome to the college, the school emphasizes [[Judeo-Christian]] values in regard to operation, justice, and teaching. All faculty members at the school are Christian, with at least eighty percent adhering to Mennonite convictions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}  The college holds convocations or chapels every Wednesday, with occasional special events, such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Students are required to attend half of these services per semester.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nGoshen College operates a campus ministries team, headed by the campus pastor. The team includes an assistant campus minister and student leaders who help guide and plan spiritual life on campus for the school year. Activities include managing the network of Goshen's small groups, spiritual friendship, leading campus worship, and planning chapels. Campus worship night is a voluntary praise and reflection time held every Wednesday night. Students also hold a [[Taiz\u00e9]] prayer service once a month on Sunday nights at 9:00. Because service is an important aspect of Christian faith, volunteerism ties in with spiritual life on campus.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n=== Volunteerism ===\nEvery September, Goshen College participates in an activity called Celebrate Service Day (CSD). Students team with professors and administrative faculty and go out into the larger Goshen community for a day of service. First-year students go with their colloquium advisers, while other students go with their dormitory floor or small group. Aside from CSD, many students donate their time to work at local kindergartens, elementary schools, hospitals, and nursing homes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n== Athletics ==\nGoshen College athletic teams are known as the \"Maple Leafs,\" chosen due to the city of Goshen being referred to as ''\"The Maple City.\"''{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nGoshen is a member of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] and competes in the [[Crossroads League]] (formerly known as the [[Mid-Central College Conference]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Name and Logo|url=http://www.crossroadsleague.com/f/Name_and_Logo.php|website=Crossroads League|publisher=Crossroads League|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref>).

Started in the 1970s, SGH offers students the opportunity to live in a house arrangement, with common kitchen and living spaces. The purpose of SGH is for students to develop another living experience alternative to dormitory life. This same idea was carried out with the construction of the Apartments. Goshen College maintains that SGH living is a privilege, and students must apply as a group to live in a residence.

In 2006, the maple tree was removed because of disease rotting the hardwood and was replaced by a new tree, now the official maple tree of Goshen.

Herald Press, 1988</ref>  The first diploma was awarded in 1898.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Lured by businessmen to relocate several miles away to [[Goshen, Indiana]], the Institute moved in September 1903 and added a junior college course list, renaming itself Goshen College.{{when|date=April 2017}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} By 1906, the Mennonite Board of Education had taken control of the college, dissolving the Elkhart Institute Association.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} A complete college course was established in 1908, and the first Bachelor of Arts degrees were conferred in 1910.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} After 1910, most of Goshen's students were enrolled in college courses. From 1914 to 1919, partly out of response to its constituents, Goshen College attempted a \"School of Agriculture,\" which sought to prepare Mennonite young people to return to their rural communities; the hope was that such a program would spark a technological revolution among some of the farmers, but it was never a success and was cut after [[World War I]], five years after it began.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The college-prep academy program of Goshen College was discontinued in 1935.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe school was closed during the 1923\u20131924 school year by the Mennonite Board of Education but reopened the following year. One of many factors in closing the college was denominational tension due to [[Liberal Christianity|modernist]] and [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christian]] theologies of the 1920s and their impact on Mennonite theology at the school.<ref>Juhnke, James C: ''Vision, Doctrine, War: Mennonite Identity and Organization in America 1890\u20131930'', page 128. Herald Press, 1989</ref> In response to this crisis, many of Goshen's faculty and dozens of students, angry with the Mennonite Board of Education's decision, relocated to [[Bluffton University|Bluffton College]]. As part of the larger ongoing reaction against liberalism through the early 20th century, [[Hesston College]] and [[Eastern Mennonite University|Eastern Mennonite School]] were formed among \"Old\" Mennonites, although staunch traditionalists realized that no higher education was particularly safe.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nWhen the institution was reopened, it was marked by the new leadership of president [[Sanford Calvin Yoder|S.C. Yoder]] and dean [[Harold S. Bender|Noah Oyer,]] who manifested outstanding abilities. His character was one marked by simplicity, modesty, and refinement, as well as unusual wisdom and insight. Under his leadership the educational program of the College developed rapidly, and much of the strength of the present college program is due to his untiring and wise endeavors. After dean Oyer\u2019s untimely passing in 1931, Harold Bender became dean. He was a man whose influence upon the \"Old\" Mennonites was significant for much of the 20th century. Bender carefully piloted the stormy waters of theology by stating that [[Mennonitism]] was not [[liberalism]]. Bender later went on to say that [[fundamentalism]] also contributed to problems with theology and created ''[[The Anabaptist Vision]]'', a \"third way\" that sought to spell out the direction for the future Mennonite Church. More than arguing doctrine, Bender and a younger group of intellectuals at Goshen College sought to shape the Mennonite faith that was more ideological than institutional. The goal was to articulate a faith that could stand the test of academic scrutiny in broader society while carefully upholding traditional beliefs of the church. Out of this ideology, Bender started ''[[The Mennonite Quarterly Review]]''. Throughout this time, Goshen remained the epicenter of \"Old\" Mennonite theology and higher education, and became known as the \"Goshen Historical Renaissance\".<ref>Toews, Paul: ''Mennonites in American Society, 1930\u20131970: Modernity and the Persistence of Religious Community'', page 88. Herald Press, 1996</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s, Goshen was one of the [[Mennonite Central Committee]]'s key places to form a \"relief training school\" that helped to train volunteers for unpaid jobs in the [[Civilian Public Service]], an alternative to the Army. Many Mennonites chose the civilian service alternative because of their beliefs regarding Biblical pacifism and nonresistance.  Although the young women pacifists were not liable to the draft, they volunteered for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs to demonstrate their patriotism; many worked in mental hospitals.<ref>Rachel Waltner Goossen, ''Women Against the Good War: Conscientious Objection and Gender on the American Home Front, 1941\u20131947'' (1997) pp 98-111</ref>\n\nIn 1980, the college was granted care of [[Merry Lea Environmental Center|Merry Lea Environmental Learning Center]], a {{convert|1150|acre|km2|adj=mid}} nature preserve that now offers Goshen's master's degree in Environmental Science.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 1993, Harold and Wilma Good, longtime friends of the college, left their estate to Goshen. The estate was estimated at roughly $28 million, the majority in stock of the [[Smuckers|J.M. Smucker Company]]. Wilma was a daughter of the company's founder. The college sold the stock and added the funds to its endowment, more than doubling it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mennoweekly.org/JUNE/06-19-06/ENDOWMENTS06-19.html |title=Mennonite college endowments lag behind |publisher=Mennonite Weekly Review |year=2006 |accessdate=2008-03-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021020/http://www.mennoweekly.org/JUNE/06-19-06/ENDOWMENTS06-19.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe campus experienced a building boom in the later half of the 1990s through the present, with an estimated $30 million in new or renovated structures on campus.

Activities include managing the network of Goshen's small groups, spiritual friendship, leading campus worship, and planning chapels. Campus worship night is a voluntary praise and reflection time held every Wednesday night. Students also hold a [[Taiz\u00e9]] prayer service once a month on Sunday nights at 9:00. Because service is an important aspect of Christian faith, volunteerism ties in with spiritual life on campus.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n=== Volunteerism ===\nEvery September, Goshen College participates in an activity called Celebrate Service Day (CSD). Students team with professors and administrative faculty and go out into the larger Goshen community for a day of service.

Goshen College maintains that SGH living is a privilege, and students must apply as a group to live in a residence. An application board consisting of resident directors, spiritual life, and physical plant review all potential candidates in the spring for the next school year. Each group must create a housing plan, division of responsibility, show examples of volunteerism, and a commitment to better the Goshen campus, as well as resolve conflict.

Open D or open E, which is the same thing \u2013 same intervals \u2013 but it would be slackened down some for D. Then there was a capo on it, to get that really tight sound. And there was another guitar over the top of that, but tuned to [[Nashville tuning (high strung)|Nashville tuning]]. I learned that from somebody in [[George Jones]]' band in San Antonio in 1964. The high-strung guitar was an acoustic, too. Both acoustics were put through a Philips cassette recorder.

Surprised, Jagger asked what it was and Richards responded: \"Oh, that's Jack \u2013 that's jumpin' Jack.\"<ref name=\"seetoy\">A ''jumping jack'' is an old-fashioned toy \u2013 see [[Jumping jack (toy)]].</ref> The lyrics evolved from there.<ref name=\"tioos-jjf\"/><ref name=\"fourflicks\">{{cite video |people=The Rolling Stones |title=Four Flicks |medium=DVD |publisher=Warner Music Vision |date=2003 }}</ref> Humanities scholar [[Camille Paglia]]<ref>[[Camille Paglia|Paglia, Camille]].

The first Rolling Stones album on which the song appeared was their 1969 compilation album, ''[[Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)]]'', one year after the single was released. Since then, it has appeared on numerous Stones compilations, including ''[[Hot Rocks 1964\u20131971]]'' (1971), ''30 Greatest Hits'' (1977), ''[[Singles Collection: The London Years]]'' (1989), ''[[Forty Licks]]'' (2002), ''[[GRRR!]]'' (2012) and ''Stray Cats'', a collection of singles and rarities included as part of ''[[The Rolling Stones in Mono]]'' box set (2016).\n\nThe Rolling Stones have played \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" during every tour since its release.

Unlike most of that show, Jones is heard clearly, mixing with Richards's lead throughout the song. The intro is not usually played in concert and instead the song begins with the main riff. The open E or open D tuning of the rhythm guitar on the studio recording has also not been replicated in concert (with the possible exception of the 1968 [[NME]] awards show, no recording of which has ever surfaced). In the performance filmed for ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' in December 1968, Richards used standard tuning; and ever since the band's appearance at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] on 5 July 1969, he has played it in [[open G tuning]] with a [[capo]] on the fourth fret. Richards is particularly fond of the song's main riff, often crediting it as his favorite among all of his most revered guitar riffs.\n\nIn March 2005, [[Q magazine|''Q'' magazine]] placed \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" at number 2 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' rated the song 124th on its list of the ''[[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]''.

perceived by some as the band's return to their [[blues]] roots after the [[baroque pop]] and [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]] heard on their preceding albums, ''[[Aftermath (The Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966), ''[[Between the Buttons]]'' (1967) and especially ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]'' (1967).<ref name=allmusic>{{Allmusic |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |class=song

To date, it is the band's most-performed song: the band has played it over 1,100 times in concert.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rolling Stones Tour Statistics|url=https://www.setlist.fm/stats/the-rolling-stones-bd6ad22.html |accessdate=13 October 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Inspiration and recording==\nWritten by [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]], recording on \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" began during the ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' sessions of 1968. Regarding the song's distinctive sound, guitarist Richards has said:\n\n{{quote|I used a [[Gibson Hummingbird]] acoustic tuned to [[Open D tuning|open D]], six string. Open D or open E, which is the same thing \u2013 same intervals \u2013 but it would be slackened down some for D. Then there was a capo on it, to get that really tight sound. And there was another guitar over the top of that, but tuned to [[Nashville tuning (high strung)|Nashville tuning]]. I learned that from somebody in [[George Jones]]' band in San Antonio in 1964. The high-strung guitar was an acoustic, too. Both acoustics were put through a Philips cassette recorder. Just jam the mic right in the guitar and play it back through an extension speaker.<ref name=\"tioos-jjf\">{{cite web |last=McPherson |first=Ian |title=Track Talk: Jumpin' Jack Flash |url=http://www.timeisonourside.com/SOJumpin.html |accessdate=22 June 2007 }}</ref>}}\n\nRichards has stated that he and Jagger wrote the lyrics while staying at Richards' country house, when they were awoken one morning by the clumping footsteps of his gardener Jack Dyer walking past the window. Surprised, Jagger asked what it was and Richards responded: \"Oh, that's Jack \u2013 that's jumpin' Jack.\"<ref name=\"seetoy\">A ''jumping jack'' is an old-fashioned toy \u2013 see [[Jumping jack (toy)]].</ref> The lyrics evolved from there.<ref name=\"tioos-jjf\"/><ref name=\"fourflicks\">{{cite video |people=The Rolling Stones |title=Four Flicks |medium=DVD |publisher=Warner Music Vision |date=2003 }}</ref> Humanities scholar [[Camille Paglia]]<ref>[[Camille Paglia|Paglia, Camille]].

It's about having a hard time and getting out. Just a metaphor for getting out of all the acid things.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Wenner |first=Jann S. |authorlink=Jann Wenner |date=14 December 1995 |title=Jagger Remembers: Mick's most comprehensive interview ever |work=Rolling Stone |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/mick_jagger_remembers/page/2/}}</ref> And in a 1968 interview, Brian Jones described it as \"getting back to ... the funky, essential essence\" following the psychedelia of ''Their Satanic Majesties Request''.<ref name=pc54>{{Pop Chronicles |54| 2|Mick Jagger & Brian Jones}}</ref>\n\nIn his autobiography, ''Stone Alone'', [[Bill Wyman]] has said that he came up with the song's distinctive main guitar riff on a piano without being credited for it.<ref name=\"tioos-jjf\"/> In ''Rolling with the Stones,'' Wyman credits Jagger with vocals, Richards with guitar and bass guitar, Brian Jones with guitar, Charlie Watts with drums and himself with organ on the track with producer Jimmy Miller adding backing vocals.\n\nAccording to the book ''Keith Richards: The Biography'' by [[Victor Bockris]], the line \"I was born in a crossfire hurricane\", was written by Richards, and refers to his being born amid the bombing and air raid sirens of [[Dartford]], England, in 1943 during World War II.\n\n==Personnel==\n'''Single version'''\n{{col-begin|width=69%}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''The Rolling Stones'''\n* [[Mick Jagger]] \u2013 lead vocals, backing vocals, [[maraca]]s\n* [[Keith Richards]] \u2013 lead guitar, acoustic guitar, bass guitar, backing vocals\n* [[Brian Jones]] - rhythm guitar\n* [[Bill Wyman]] \u2013 [[Hammond organ]]\n* [[Charlie Watts]] \u2013 drums\n{{col-2}}\n'''Additional personnel'''\n* [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] \u2013 piano\n* [[Jimmy Miller]] \u2013 backing vocals\n{{col-end}}\n\n'''Live version from ''Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!'''''\n* Mick Jagger \u2013 lead vocals\n* Keith Richards \u2013 electric guitar, backing vocals\n* [[Mick Taylor]] \u2013 electric guitar\n* Bill Wyman \u2013 bass guitar\n* Charlie Watts \u2013 drums\n\n\"'''Child of the Moon'''\"\n{{col-begin|width=69%}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''The Rolling Stones'''\n* Mick Jagger \u2013 lead vocals, backing vocals\n* Keith Richards \u2013 electric guitars, backing vocals\n* Brian Jones \u2013 [[soprano saxophone]], [[Mellotron]]\n* Bill Wyman \u2013 bass guitar\n* Charlie Watts \u2013 drums\n{{col-2}}\n'''Additional personnel'''\n* [[Nicky Hopkins]] \u2013 piano, organ\n* [[Jimmy Miller]] \u2013 backing vocals\n* [[Rocky Dijon]] \u2013 percussion\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Release and aftermath==\nReleased on 24 May 1968, \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" (backed with \"Child of the Moon\") reached the top of the [[UK Singles Chart]]<ref name=\"500 Number One Hits\"/> and peaked at number three in the United States.

The first Rolling Stones album on which the song appeared was their 1969 compilation album, ''[[Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)]]'', one year after the single was released. Since then, it has appeared on numerous Stones compilations, including ''[[Hot Rocks 1964\u20131971]]'' (1971), ''30 Greatest Hits'' (1977), ''[[Singles Collection: The London Years]]'' (1989), ''[[Forty Licks]]'' (2002), ''[[GRRR!]]'' (2012) and ''Stray Cats'', a collection of singles and rarities included as part of ''[[The Rolling Stones in Mono]]'' box set (2016).\n\nThe Rolling Stones have played \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" during every tour since its release.

The Rolling Stones in Concert|Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!]]'' (recorded 1969, released 1970), ''[[Love You Live]]'' (recorded 1976, released 1977), ''[[Flashpoint (album)|Flashpoint]]'' (recorded 1990, released 1991), ''[[Shine a Light (The Rolling Stones album)|Shine a Light]]'' (recorded 2006, released 2008), ''[[Hyde Park Live]]'' (2013), ''[[Stripped (The Rolling Stones album)#Totally Stripped|Totally Stripped]]'' (recorded 1995, released 2016), and ''[[The Rolling Stones: Havana Moon|Havana Moon]]'' (2016), as well as, notably, ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus (album)|The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' (recorded 1968, released 1996), featuring the only released live performance of the song with [[Brian Jones]]. Unlike most of that show, Jones is heard clearly, mixing with Richards's lead throughout the song. The intro is not usually played in concert and instead the song begins with the main riff. The open E or open D tuning of the rhythm guitar on the studio recording has also not been replicated in concert (with the possible exception of the 1968 [[NME]] awards show, no recording of which has ever surfaced). In the performance filmed for ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' in December 1968, Richards used standard tuning; and ever since the band's appearance at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] on 5 July 1969, he has played it in [[open G tuning]] with a [[capo]] on the fourth fret. Richards is particularly fond of the song's main riff, often crediting it as his favorite among all of his most revered guitar riffs.\n\nIn March 2005, [[Q magazine|''Q'' magazine]] placed \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" at number 2 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' rated the song 124th on its list of the ''[[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]''.

At Computer Terminal Corporation (later renamed [[Datapoint|Datapoint Corporation]]), he co-created the architecture that was ultimately implemented in the first successful computer microprocessor, the [[Intel 8008]]. Subsequently, Computer Terminal Corporation created the first personal computer, the [[Datapoint 2200]] programmable terminal.\n\n==Early life==\nVictor Dale Poor was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], the son of Pinckney Peyton Poor and Leona Lucille Poor (''n\u00e9e'' Mallory). With a passion for radio, he built his own transceiver from collected discarded pieces, and qualified on [[amateur radio]] in 1951 (callsign W6JSO).\n\nAfter high school, Poor joined the [[United States Navy]]. While attending electronics training at the [[Treasure Island (California)|Treasure Island Naval Base]] in 1952, he met his wife, Florence, in a church in [[San Francisco]].<ref name=FlorToday/> On completing his training the couple married in November 1952, and he was then assigned to [[Ford Island]] naval base, [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]].<ref name=FlorToday/>\n\n==Career==\nOn leaving the Navy in 1955, Poor joined the telecommunications technology team at [[Stromberg-Carlson]] in [[San Diego, California]]. Trained in computer programming, he wrote his first programme in 1956 for the [[UNIVAC 1103]].<ref name=FlorToday/> Recruited by [[Raytheon]], the couple then moved to [[Massachusetts]]. Although Poor did not attend college, he took electronics training classes both in the Navy and at Raytheon. A quick learner, he soon knew more than his instructors and began teaching classes himself.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|last=Markoff|first=John|title=Victor Poor, Who Helped Create Early Intel Chips, Dies at 79|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/technology/victor-poor-intel-computer-chip-innovator-dies-at-79.html?_r=1|accessdate=20 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nPoor then moved to [[Maryland]] to help form radio and telegraph equipment manufacturer Frederick Electronics.<ref name=FlorToday/> Quickly made an executive, he developed the idea of adapting [[radioteletype]] (RTTY) machines to send data wirelessly. These were then sold to both the [[United States Army]] and later commercial media customers, such as the [[Associated Press]], to send affiliated news reports as data around the world.<ref name=HBeam/>\n\n===Computer engineering===\nPoor continued his research and development, trying to develop a method for sending photographs and pictures wirelessly. In 1969 while working his notice period from Frederick Electronics,<ref name=FlorToday/> during the [[Thanksgiving]] holiday, Poor and fellow amateur radio colleague [[Harry Pyle]] produced the underlying architecture of the modern microprocessor on a living room floor. They then asked fellow radio amateur Jonathan Schmidt to write the accompanying communications software. Pitching the idea to both [[Texas Instruments]] and [[Intel]], the partnership developed the [[Intel 8008]], the forerunner of the microprocessor chips found in today's personal and computing devices.<ref name=FlorToday/><ref name=HBeam/><ref>{{cite news|last=Port|first=Otis|title=Whose Brainchild Was The Brain Chip?|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1996/50/b3505100.htm|accessdate=2012-08-18|newspaper=Business Week Archives|date=9 December 1996 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827161521/http://www.businessweek.com/1996/50/b3505100.htm |archive-date=2006-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Dara|first=Kerr|title=Early chip engineer Victor Poor dies at 79|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57496097-93/early-chip-engineer-victor-poor-dies-at-79/|work=Internet and Media News|publisher=CNET|accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Thomson|first=Iain|title=Processor pioneer Victor Poor dies of cancer at 79: Modest designer of Intel's first integrated processors|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/08/20/victor_poor_obituary/|publisher=The Register|accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1969, Poor joined start-up computer company Computer Terminal Corporation as Technical Director in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. Founded by two former [[NASA]] engineers, Phil Ray and Gus Roche, they asked him to approach Intel to see how much of his design could fit onto a computer chip. Pitching a $100,000 proposal to place the architecture onto silicon and into production, the project became the [[Intel 8008]] master chip, the world's first 8-bit microprocessor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gale Directory of Company Histories: Datapoint Corporation|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/datapoint|publisher=Answers.com|accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> Poor and Pyle then developed the [[instruction set architecture]] which enabled Ray and Roche to design and develop the mass-produced programmable [[Datapoint 2200]] [[computer terminal]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Lamont |last=Wood |url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=printArticleBasic&articleId=9111341 |title=Forgotten PC history: The true origins of the personal computer |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814215757/http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=printArticleBasic&articleId=9111341 |archivedate=2008-08-14 |website=Computerworld |date=8 August 2008}}</ref> As a result of the success of this product, the company changed its name to [[Datapoint]]. Datapoint remained one generation ahead of Intel until the [[Intel 80286]].\n\nOverseeing the development of [[ARCNET]] by lead ARCNET architect [[John Murphy (engineer)|John Murphy]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Horak |first1=Ray |title=Webster's New World Telecom Dictionary |date=2008 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=047177457X |page=37 }}</ref> an early [[local area network]], Poor stayed with Datapoint until 1984, after they had lost their technical microchip lead to [[IBM]] and been bought out by [[corporate raider]]s.<ref name=FlorToday/> He \"retired\" with his wife on the profits that he had made from the 15 year growth in Datapoint stock, deciding to go sailing. After sailing across the [[Atlantic Ocean]], they spent the first summer in the [[Mediterranean]] on the {{convert|50|foot}} [[Gulfstar Yachts|Gulfstar]] yacht ''Elsinore'', named after the location of the castle in [[Shakespeare]]\u2019s ''\"[[Hamlet]]\"''.<ref name=FlorToday/>\n\n===Amateur radio===\nThe challenges of communicating by radio while at sea (callsign W5SMM)<ref name=HBeam/> led Poor to develop software that integrates Internet with amateur radio to store and forward messages; this system is today part of a major amateur-supported emergency communications network.<ref name=Obit>{{cite news|title=Obituary|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/floridatoday/obituary.aspx?n=victor-poor&pid=159236051|accessdate=19 August 2012|newspaper=Florida Today|date=19 August 2012}}</ref>  While sailing, Poor wanted a better way to communicate with those around him. This led to him developing, in 1985, the original computer program, [[APlink]] (AMTOR-Packet Link). Then as part of a group of radio amateurs, acting as the architect Poor helped to developed what became [[Winlink]].<ref name=HBeam/> Both of these systems would automatically store and forward messages between amateur radio stations.<ref name=FlorToday/> With no one in the group able to take royalties due to the amateur radio regulations,<ref name=FlorToday/> the [[American Radio Relay League]] (ARRL) later adopted APlink for their National Traffic System (NTS) digital messages.<ref name=HBeam/>  The system was widely adopted by radio amateurs, the United States military, and state and local emergency preparedness teams. It was credited with being one of the few communications systems that worked in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.<ref name=NYT/>\n\n==Retirement==\nIn 1994, Poor was recruited as the President of Airnet, a spinoff from [[Harris Corporation]], based in [[Melbourne, Florida]]. Proposing to his wife that they would soon be home in San Antonio, at the end of his 2.5 year tenure they retired to [[Brevard County, Florida]] instead.<ref name=FlorToday>{{cite news|last=Ford|first=Andrew|title=Melbourne man played key role in early computer architecture|url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20120730/BUSINESS/307290009|accessdate=2012-08-17|newspaper=Florida Today|date=2012-07-28}}</ref>\n\nOn December 8, 2004, Gardner Hendrie and Len Shustek of the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]], recorded \"The Oral History of Victor Poor.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Oral History of Victor Poor |url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2012/06/102658337-05-01-acc.pdf|publisher=Computer History Museum|accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref>\n\nPoor's lifelong hobbies were operating amateur radio, flying airplanes, and sailing boats. Poor and his wife Florence loved to sail. Their earliest cruises were out of Corpus Christi, Texas, and included adventures to the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula. In 1984, the couple sailed their 50-ft sloop ''Elsinore'' across the Atlantic Ocean and toured the western Mediterranean Sea; between 1988 and 1990, they lived aboard a 37-ft catamaran ''Aransas Light'' and explored the coastlines of the Gulf of Mexico, the Bahamas, and the eastern seaboard as far north as Chesapeake Bay; between 1990 and 1994 they moved to a Diesel-powered 50-ft trawler ''Excalibur'' to sightsee along the Inland Waterway between Seattle, Washington, and Skagway, Alaska.<ref name=Obit/>\n\nIn May 2012, Poor was diagnosed with Stage IV pancreatic cancer.<ref

an American engineer and computer pioneer. At Computer Terminal Corporation (later renamed [[Datapoint|Datapoint Corporation]]), he co-created the architecture that was ultimately implemented in the first successful computer microprocessor, the [[Intel 8008]]. Subsequently, Computer Terminal Corporation created the first personal computer, the [[Datapoint 2200]] programmable terminal.\n\n==Early life==\nVictor Dale Poor was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], the son of Pinckney Peyton Poor and Leona Lucille Poor (''n\u00e9e'' Mallory). With a passion for radio, he built his own transceiver from collected discarded pieces, and qualified on [[amateur radio]] in 1951 (callsign W6JSO).\n\nAfter high school, Poor joined the [[United States Navy]]. While attending electronics training at the [[Treasure Island (California)|Treasure Island Naval Base]] in 1952, he met his wife, Florence, in a church in [[San Francisco]].<ref name=FlorToday/> On completing his training the couple married in November 1952, and he was then assigned to [[Ford Island]] naval base, [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]].<ref name=FlorToday/>\n\n==Career==\nOn leaving the Navy in 1955, Poor joined the telecommunications technology team at [[Stromberg-Carlson]] in [[San Diego, California]]. Trained in computer programming, he wrote his first programme in 1956 for the [[UNIVAC 1103]].<ref name=FlorToday/> Recruited by [[Raytheon]], the couple then moved to [[Massachusetts]]. Although Poor did not attend college, he took electronics training classes both in the Navy and at Raytheon. A quick learner, he soon knew more than his instructors and began teaching classes himself.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|last=Markoff|first=John|title=Victor Poor, Who Helped Create Early Intel Chips, Dies at 79|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/technology/victor-poor-intel-computer-chip-innovator-dies-at-79.html?_r=1|accessdate=20 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nPoor then moved to [[Maryland]] to help form radio and telegraph equipment manufacturer Frederick Electronics.<ref name=FlorToday/> Quickly made an executive, he developed the idea of adapting [[radioteletype]] (RTTY) machines to send data wirelessly. These were then sold to both the [[United States Army]] and later commercial media customers, such as the [[Associated Press]], to send affiliated news reports as data around the world.<ref name=HBeam/>\n\n===Computer engineering===\nPoor continued his research and development, trying to develop a method for sending photographs and pictures wirelessly. In 1969 while working his notice period from Frederick Electronics,<ref name=FlorToday/> during the [[Thanksgiving]] holiday, Poor and fellow amateur radio colleague [[Harry Pyle]] produced the underlying architecture of the modern microprocessor on a living room floor. They then asked fellow radio amateur Jonathan Schmidt to write the accompanying communications software. Pitching the idea to both [[Texas Instruments]] and [[Intel]], the partnership developed the [[Intel 8008]], the forerunner of the microprocessor chips found in today's personal and computing devices.<ref name=FlorToday/><ref name=HBeam/><ref>{{cite news|last=Port|first=Otis|title=Whose Brainchild Was The Brain Chip?|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1996/50/b3505100.htm|accessdate=2012-08-18|newspaper=Business Week Archives|date=9 December 1996 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827161521/http://www.businessweek.com/1996/50/b3505100.htm |archive-date=2006-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Dara|first=Kerr|title=Early chip engineer Victor Poor dies at 79|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57496097-93/early-chip-engineer-victor-poor-dies-at-79/|work=Internet and Media News|publisher=CNET|accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Thomson|first=Iain|title=Processor pioneer Victor Poor dies of cancer at 79: Modest designer of Intel's first integrated processors|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/08/20/victor_poor_obituary/|publisher=The Register|accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1969, Poor joined start-up computer company Computer Terminal Corporation as Technical Director in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. Founded by two former [[NASA]] engineers, Phil Ray and Gus Roche, they asked him to approach Intel to see how much of his design could fit onto a computer chip. Pitching a $100,000 proposal to place the architecture onto silicon and into production, the project became the [[Intel 8008]] master chip, the world\u2019s first 8-bit microprocessor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gale Directory of Company Histories: Datapoint Corporation|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/datapoint|publisher=Answers.com|accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> Poor and Pyle then developed the [[instruction set architecture]] which enabled Ray and Roche to design and develop the mass-produced programmable [[Datapoint 2200]] [[computer terminal]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Lamont |last=Wood |url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=printArticleBasic&articleId=9111341 |title=Forgotten PC history: The true origins of the personal computer |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814215757/http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=printArticleBasic&articleId=9111341 |archivedate=2008-08-14 |website=Computerworld |date=8 August 2008}}</ref> As a result of the success of this product, the company changed its name to [[Datapoint]].

This led to him developing, in 1985, the original computer program, [[APlink]] (AMTOR-Packet Link). Then as part of a group of radio amateurs, acting as the architect Poor helped to developed what became [[Winlink]].<ref name=HBeam/> Both of these systems would automatically store and forward messages between amateur radio stations.<ref name=FlorToday/> With no one in the group able to take royalties due to the amateur radio regulations,<ref name=FlorToday/> the [[American Radio Relay League]] (ARRL) later adopted APlink for their National Traffic System (NTS) digital messages.<ref name=HBeam/>  The system was widely adopted by radio amateurs, the United States military, and state and local emergency preparedness teams. It was credited with being one of the few communications systems that worked in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.<ref name=NYT/>\n\n==Retirement==\nIn 1994, Poor was recruited as the President of Airnet, a spinoff from [[Harris Corporation]], based in [[Melbourne, Florida]]. Proposing to his wife that they would soon be home in San Antonio, at the end of his 2.5 year tenure they retired to [[Brevard County, Florida]] instead.<ref name=FlorToday>{{cite news|last=Ford|first=Andrew|title=Melbourne man played key role in early computer architecture|url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20120730/BUSINESS/307290009|accessdate=2012-08-17|newspaper=Florida Today|date=2012-07-28}}</ref>\n\nOn December 8, 2004, Gardner Hendrie and Len Shustek of the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]], recorded \"The Oral History of Victor Poor.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Oral History of Victor Poor |url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2012/06/102658337-05-01-acc.pdf|publisher=Computer History Museum|accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref>\n\nPoor's lifelong hobbies were operating amateur radio, flying airplanes, and sailing boats. Poor and his wife Florence loved to sail. Their earliest cruises were out of Corpus Christi, Texas, and included adventures to the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula. In 1984, the couple sailed their 50-ft sloop ''Elsinore'' across the Atlantic Ocean and toured the western Mediterranean Sea; between 1988 and 1990, they lived aboard a 37-ft catamaran ''Aransas Light'' and explored the coastlines of the Gulf of Mexico, the Bahamas, and the eastern seaboard as far north as Chesapeake Bay; between 1990 and 1994 they moved to a Diesel-powered 50-ft trawler ''Excalibur'' to sightsee along the Inland Waterway between Seattle, Washington, and Skagway, Alaska.<ref name=Obit/>\n\nIn May 2012, Poor was diagnosed with Stage IV pancreatic cancer.<ref name=FlorToday/> On July 9, Poor was awarded the ARRL President's Award at the Platinum Coast Amateur Radio Society annual meeting, for a lifetime of achievements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vic Poor, W5SMM, Receives ARRL President\u2019s Award|url=http://www.arrl.org/news/vic-poor-w5smm-receives-arrl-president-s-award|publisher=ARRL, The National Association for Amateur Radio|accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> There have been only a handful of recipients of this prestigious award.<ref name=HBeam>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-297514005.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510133537/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-297514005.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 10, 2013|title=Vic Poor, W5SMM, Receives ARRL President's Award |publisher=States News Service |date=July 25, 2012|accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref>\n\nPoor died early on the morning of August 17, 2012, at William Childs Hospice House in [[Palm Bay, Florida]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20120818/BUSINESS/120817025/Victor-Poor-reluctant-visionary-dies-79|title=Victor Poor, reluctant visionary, dies at 79|publisher=FloridaToday.com|date=August 17, 2012|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Poor, Victor}}\n[[Category:People from Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:United States Navy personnel]]\n[[Category:American inventors]]\n[[Category:American electrical engineers]]\n[[Category:American electronics engineers]]\n[[Category:Computer hardware engineers]]\n[[Category:American businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Amateur radio people]]\n[[Category:People from Brevard County, Florida]]\n[[Category:Deaths from cancer]]\n[[Category:1933 births]]\n[[Category:2012 deaths]]\n[[Category:Engineers from California]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eComputer engineering:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Poor"}

Video games loosely based on ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' were also released for several platforms, and most obtained favourable reviews. \n==Plot==\nHarry is back at the [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#The Dursleys|Dursley's]] for the summer holidays, where he sees on Muggle television that a convict named [[Sirius Black]] has escaped from prison. After the Dursley's [[Aunt Marge]] personally insults Harry, Harry accidentally inflates her, then runs away from home, fearing expulsion from school. After being picked up by the [[Knight Bus]] and meeting [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#Stan Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]], he travels to the [[The Leaky Cauldron (pub)|Leaky Cauldron]], where [[Cornelius Fudge]], the [[Minister for Magic]], asks Harry to stay in [[Diagon Alley]] for his own protection. While there, he meets his best friends [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]]. \n\nBefore leaving for [[Hogwarts]], Harry learns from [[Arthur Weasley]] that Sirius Black is a convicted murderer from the wizarding world and that Black has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban to kill Harry. On the way to Hogwarts, a [[Dementor]] (an Azkaban prison guard that feeds on positive thoughts) boards the train, causing Harry to relive his parents' deaths before fainting. The new [[Defence against the dark arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher, [[Professor Lupin|Remus Lupin]], protects Harry, Ron, and Hermione from the Dementor. They later learn Dementors will be patrolling the school in an attempt to catch Black. Although Professor Lupin is popular with his students, the Potions master, [[Severus Snape|Snape]], seems to hate him.\n\nDuring a [[Quidditch]] match, Harry faints and falls off his [[broomstick]] after Dementors invade the field. Dumbledore did not want the dementors to enter Hogwarts and was furious. His [[Nimbus 2000]] is blown away and smashed by the [[Whomping Willow]], a violent tree in the grounds. Afterward, Professor Lupin teaches Harry how to defend himself from Dementors using the Patronus charm. Harry wants to be taught by Lupin because he made the dementors go away on the train to Hogwarts. Dumbledore used astero Moumentom To stop Harry From Crashing into the ground and mabye dieing.\n\nHarry uses [[The Marauder's Map]] (a map of Hogwarts marking all its inhabitants and secret tunnels given to him by the Weasely twins [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]]) for an unauthorized visit to the magical village of [[Hogsmeade]]. Harry overhears some of his teachers and Fudge and learns Black was a friend of Harry's parents, was made Harry's own godfather, and was entrusted with the secret of the Potters' whereabouts when they hid from Voldemort. However, he betrayed the Potters, leading to their murder by [[Voldemort]]'s hand. Finally, Black killed twelve [[Muggles]] and his former friend [[Death Eater: Peter Pettigrew]] before being taken to Azkaban on a false crime.\n\nRon and Hermione's friendship later suffers when Ron believes Hermione's cat, [[Crookshanks]], to have eaten his rat, [[Scabbers]]. Hermione also gets Harry's new anonymously given Christmas present, a top-of-the-range Firebolt broomstick, confiscated for fear it might be jinxed by Sirius Black. Hermione becomes severely stressed by her many classes, some of which seem to occur at the same time, a detail which she refuses to explain to Harry and Ron\n\nThroughout the year, Harry repeatedly sees a large black dog stalking him. His Divination teacher, [[Hogwarts_staff: Sybill_Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]], informs him that this is the Grim, an omen of death. During Harry's Divination exam at the end of the year, Trelawney goes into a trance and predicts that Voldemort's servant will escape and return to him.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Hagrid]]'s hippogriff [[Buckbeak]] is in danger of being executed by the Ministry of Magic after injuring [[Draco Malfoy]], who provoked Buckbeak. His father Lucius Malfoy tries to obtain justice for his son's injury. Despite Hermione's and Ron's efforts to defend the hippogriff, they and Harry seemingly hear Buckbeak executed as they leave Hagrid's hut. While visiting Hagrid's, however, Hermione discovers Scabbers hiding there. Hagrid gives scabbers back to Ron and Hermione tells Ron to apologize for blaming her cat for eating him. Then a rock is thrown to their direction\n\nScabbers escapes from Ron, who gives chase. The large black dog appears and attacks Ron, then drags him into a tunnel under the Whomping Willow. [[Crookshanks]] (who seems to be in league with the dog), Harry, and Hermione follow them through the tunnel and to the [[Shrieking Shack]], a haunted house in Hogsmeade. They discover that the dog is Sirius Black in animal form. Harry disarms Black and intends to kill him but finds he cannot.\n\nLupin enters and embraces Black as a friend. He explains that, although he believed Black to have betrayed the Potters, he realises now that it was Peter Pettigrew. He admits he is a werewolf and that, while at school, his friends (Black, Pettigrew, and Harry's father, [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]]) learned to transform into animals to keep Lupin company during his transformations. Lupin explains that Scabbers is Pettigrew in his animal form. Pettigrew faked his own death, framing Black for the murders, and has been hiding from Black since his escape from Azkaban.\n\nSnape, who still holds a childhood grudge against Lupin and his friends, arrives to apprehend Black but is knocked unconscious by Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who now believe Black to be innocent. Lupin and Black transform Pettigrew into human form and prepare to kill him, but Harry stops them because he feels his father would not have wanted it. He convinces Lupin and Black to send Pettigrew to Azkaban instead.\n\nAs they attempt to bring Pettigrew back to Hogwarts, the full moon transforms Lupin into a wolf. Lupin, not in his own mind, attacks them. In the confusion, Pettigrew transforms into a rat and escapes. Harry, Hermione, and Black are chased to the shore of the lake, where they are set upon by Dementors. They are rescued by a Patronus cast by a figure on the opposite shore, whom Harry thinks is his father.\n\nReawakening later in the hospital wing, Harry and Hermione are told that Black has been sentenced to have his soul sucked out by Dementors, a fate worse than death known as the Dementor's Kiss. [[Albus_Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] tells Harry and Hermione to use Hermione's [[time-turner]], a device she has been using to attend her simultaneous classes, to go back in time and save Buckbeak and Sirius. They rescue Buckbeak from execution and later watch themselves attacked by Dementors at the lake. Harry realises that the figure he saw was not his father but himself, and he casts the Patronus charm that drives away the Dementors. Harry and Hermione ride Buckbeak to the tower where Black is being held and break him out. Black escapes on Buckbeak.\n\nHarry and Hermione return to the hospital wing to close the timeline. Enraged by the escape of Black, Snape lets slip that Lupin is a werewolf, forcing him to resign. Harry returns to Kings Cross with his friends and receives a letter from Black, giving him permission to visit Hogsmeade next year. Which is accepeted Bye Minerva Mcgonagall.\n\n==Publication and reception==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (US cover).jpg|thumb|upright|Original 1999 US cover of ''Prisoner of Azkaban''{{ffdc|1=Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (US cover).jpg|log=2016 November 21}}]] -->\n\n===Pre-release history===\n''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' is the third book in the ''Harry Potter'' series.

Video games loosely based on ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' were also released for several platforms, and most obtained favourable reviews. \n==Plot==\nHarry is back at the [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#The Dursleys|Dursley's]] for the summer holidays, where he sees on Muggle television that a convict named [[Sirius Black]] has escaped from prison. After the Dursley's [[Aunt Marge]] personally insults Harry, Harry accidentally inflates her, then runs away from home, fearing expulsion from school. After being picked up by the [[Knight Bus]] and meeting [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#Stan Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]], he travels to the [[The Leaky Cauldron (pub)|Leaky Cauldron]], where [[Cornelius Fudge]], the [[Minister for Magic]], asks Harry to stay in [[Diagon Alley]] for his own protection. While there, he meets his best friends [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]]. \n\nBefore leaving for [[Hogwarts]], Harry learns from [[Arthur Weasley]] that Sirius Black is a convicted murderer from the wizarding world and that Black has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban to kill Harry. On the way to Hogwarts, a [[Dementor]] (an Azkaban prison guard that feeds on positive thoughts) boards the train, causing Harry to relive his parents' deaths before fainting. The new [[Defence against the dark arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher, [[Professor Lupin|Remus Lupin]], protects Harry, Ron, and Hermione from the Dementor. They later learn Dementors will be patrolling the school in an attempt to catch Black. Although Professor Lupin is popular with his students, the Potions master, [[Severus Snape|Snape]], seems to hate him.\n\nDuring a [[Quidditch]] match, Harry faints and falls off his [[broomstick]] after Dementors invade the field. Dumbledore did not want the dementors to enter Hogwarts and was furious. His [[Nimbus 2000]] is blown away and smashed by the [[Whomping Willow]], a violent tree in the grounds. Afterward, Professor Lupin teaches Harry how to defend himself from Dementors using the Patronus charm. Harry wants to be taught by Lupin because he made the dementors go away on the train to Hogwarts.\n\nHarry uses [[The Marauder's Map]] (a map of Hogwarts marking all its inhabitants and secret tunnels given to him by the Weasely twins [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]]) for an unauthorized visit to the magical village of [[Hogsmeade]]. Harry overhears some of his teachers and Fudge and learns Black was a friend of Harry's parents, was made Harry's own godfather, and was entrusted with the secret of the Potters' whereabouts when they hid from Voldemort. However, he betrayed the Potters, leading to their murder by [[Voldemort]]'s hand. Finally, Black killed twelve [[Muggles]] and his former friend [[Death Eater: Peter Pettigrew]] before being taken to Azkaban on a false crime.\n\nRon and Hermione's friendship later suffers when Ron believes Hermione's cat, [[Crookshanks]], to have eaten his rat, [[Scabbers]]. Hermione also gets Harry's new anonymously given Christmas present, a top-of-the-range Firebolt broomstick, confiscated for fear it might be jinxed by Sirius Black. Hermione becomes severely stressed by her many classes, some of which seem to occur at the same time, a detail which she refuses to explain to Harry and Ron\n\nThroughout the year, Harry repeatedly sees a large black dog stalking him. His Divination teacher, [[Hogwarts_staff: Sybill_Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]], informs him that this is the Grim, an omen of death. During Harry's Divination exam at the end of the year, Trelawney goes into a trance and predicts that Voldemort's servant will escape and return to him.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Hagrid]]'s hippogriff [[Buckbeak]] is in danger of being executed by the Ministry of Magic after injuring [[Draco Malfoy]], who provoked Buckbeak. His father Lucius Malfoy tries to obtain justice for his son's injury. Despite Hermione's and Ron's efforts to defend the hippogriff, they and Harry seemingly hear Buckbeak executed as they leave Hagrid's hut. While visiting Hagrid's, however, Hermione discovers Scabbers hiding there. Hagrid gives scabbers back to Ron and Hermione tells Ron to apologize for blaming her cat for eating him. Then a rock is thrown to their direction\n\nScabbers escapes from Ron, who gives chase. The large black dog appears and attacks Ron, then drags him into a tunnel under the Whomping Willow. [[Crookshanks]] (who seems to be in league with the dog), Harry, and Hermione follow them through the tunnel and to the [[Shrieking Shack]], a haunted house in Hogsmeade. They discover that the dog is Sirius Black in animal form. Harry disarms Black and intends to kill him but finds he cannot.\n\nLupin enters and embraces Black as a friend. He explains that, although he believed Black to have betrayed the Potters, he realises now that it was Peter Pettigrew. He admits he is a werewolf and that, while at school, his friends (Black, Pettigrew, and Harry's father, [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]]) learned to transform into animals to keep Lupin company during his transformations. Lupin explains that Scabbers is Pettigrew in his animal form. Pettigrew faked his own death, framing Black for the murders, and has been hiding from Black since his escape from Azkaban.\n\nSnape, who still holds a childhood grudge against Lupin and his friends, arrives to apprehend Black but is knocked unconscious by Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who now believe Black to be innocent. Lupin and Black transform Pettigrew into human form and prepare to kill him, but Harry stops them because he feels his father would not have wanted it. He convinces Lupin and Black to send Pettigrew to Azkaban instead.\n\nAs they attempt to bring Pettigrew back to Hogwarts, the full moon transforms Lupin into a wolf. Lupin, not in his own mind, attacks them. In the confusion, Pettigrew transforms into a rat and escapes. Harry, Hermione, and Black are chased to the shore of the lake, where they are set upon by Dementors. They are rescued by a Patronus cast by a figure on the opposite shore, whom Harry thinks is his father.\n\nReawakening later in the hospital wing, Harry and Hermione are told that Black has been sentenced to have his soul sucked out by Dementors, a fate worse than death known as the Dementor's Kiss. [[Albus_Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] tells Harry and Hermione to use Hermione's [[time-turner]], a device she has been using to attend her simultaneous classes, to go back in time and save Buckbeak and Sirius. They rescue Buckbeak from execution and later watch themselves attacked by Dementors at the lake. Harry realises that the figure he saw was not his father but himself, and he casts the Patronus charm that drives away the Dementors. Harry and Hermione ride Buckbeak to the tower where Black is being held and break him out. Black escapes on Buckbeak.\n\nHarry and Hermione return to the hospital wing to close the timeline.
