They were armed with a rifle Sek had stolen from Nee Soon camp. All five victims: Tay, his wife, their Filipino maid, Tay's daughter and her tutor were confined to a bedroom. They proceeded to rob Tay's family of their jewellery and cash out money from their bank accounts. While Nyu was guarding the victims, Sek decided to murder all five victims by escorting them one-by-one out of the bedroom in a bid to erase witnesses. Sek proceeded to struck Tay and his wife with a chair and strangled them. Sek also strangled their maid. In all, Sek murdered 3 people. Nyu discovered Sek's murder intentions only when he caught him in the act in another room. Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in. When Sek's repeated requests to open the door was denied by Nyu, Sek immediately fled. Nyu then released Tay's daughter and her tutor. Nyu fled to Malaysia before he surrendered and was extradited to Singapore. Sek was arrested at his sister's home on 29 July, where he attempted suicide when police were closing in on him. During the trial, when asked how he felt when strangling Tay's wife, Sek brought up an incident when he was nearly strangled by someone at the Singapore Boys\u2019 Home until he blacked out.

Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How also ruled that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. This amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment, so his life term was still a jail term of 20 years, and thus he would still be jailed for 38 years.<ref> {{cite web|title=oriental_hotel_murder|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1804_2011-04-04.html}} </ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|title=Former detective Richard Lim Beng Gee, 65, dies: 5 high-profile cases he helped crack / ASSAULT ON TWO JAPANESE TOURISTS IN 5-STAR HOTEL|last=Lee|first=Min Kok|date=2016-01-19|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012154609/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|archive-date=2019-10-12|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep9/367513|title=True Files S3|website=Toggle|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref>\n\n===1995===\n\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

He was charged with murder, but it was found and proven in the middle of the trial that Somsak was fully intoxicated at the time he killed Choochai due to him having consumed too much alcohol before the killing. The charge was then reduced to culpable homicide not amounting to murder; Somsak pleaded guilty and he was then sentenced to 10 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane.\n\n===2006===\n* 15 February 2006: In the first crime involving firearms since 2000, Tan Chor Jin, nicknamed the \"One-eyed Dragon\" forcefully entered the flat of Lim Hock Soon, a nightclub owner. He seized Lim's family valuables before tying up Lim, his wife, his daughter and Lim's maid. He then proceeded to shoot and kill Lim, where five of the six bullets hit Lim. He managed to flee the country with the help of his accomplice, Ho Yueh Keong. He was nabbed by the [[Royal Malaysian Police]] 10 days later at a hotel in Kuala Lumpur before being extradited back to Singapore on 1 March 2006. Initially charged with murder, his charge was amended to discharging of firearm. During the trial, Tan choose to be unrepresented. In one of his defence, he claimed that Lim was about to hit him with a chair and thus shot Lim in self-defence. But his defence fell flat when the prosecution noted that Lim was tied up and could not have lifted the chair. On 22 May 2007, he was found guilty and sentenced to hang. (Under Singapore law, offenders charged with unlawful discharge of firearms will be sentenced to death, even with no intention to kill.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/AOA1973|title=Arms Offences Act - Singapore Statutes Online|last=|first=|date=|website=sso.agc.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref> The Court of Appeal also dismissed Tan's appeal against his death sentence on 30 January 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tan Chor Jin v Public Prosecutor [2008] 4 SLR 306; [2008] SGCA 32|url=http://www.singaporelaw.sg/sglaw/laws-of-singapore/case-law/free-law/court-of-appeal-judgments/13530-tan-chor-jin-v-public-prosecutor-2008-4-slr-306-2008-sgca-32|website=SingaporeLaw.sg|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130170543/http://www.singaporelaw.sg/sglaw/laws-of-singapore/case-law/free-law/court-of-appeal-judgments/13530-tan-chor-jin-v-public-prosecutor-2008-4-slr-306-2008-sgca-32|archive-date=30 January 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He was subsequently executed on 9 January 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Teo|first1=Wan Gek|title=Donor 'designated kidney expressly' for Tang|newspaper=The Straits Times|location=Singapore|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/the+Straits+Times/Story/A1Story20090111-113780.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|date=11 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131175029/http://news.asiaone.com/News/the+Straits+Times/Story/A1Story20090111-113780.html|archive-date=31 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The suspected murderer who shocked Singapore|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2007/01/22/2003345842|accessdate=25 January 2015|agency=Taipei Times|date=22 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607153720/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2007/01/22/2003345842|archive-date=2014-06-07|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/guilty-as-charged-one-eyed-dragon-tan-chor-jin-shot-nightclub-owner|title=Guilty As Charged: 'One-eyed Dragon' Tan Chor Jin shot nightclub owner|last=Hoe|first=Pei Shan|date=2016-05-17|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref> His accomplice, Ho, was charged on 15 July 2015 for harbouring Tan out of Singapore.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alkhatib |first1=Shaffiq |url=https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore-news/man-charged-harbouring-one-eyed-dragon |title=Man charged with harbouring 'One-Eyed Dragon' |website=The New Paper |access-date=13 October 2019 |date=15 July 2015}}</ref> Ho pleaded guilty on 8 August 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hussain |first1=Amir |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/one-eyed-dragon-tan-chor-jins-accomplice-found-guilty-after-9-years-on-the |title='One-eyed Dragon' Tan Chor Jin's accomplice found guilty after 9 years on the run |website=The Straits Times |access-date=13 October 2019 |date=8 August 2016}}</ref> Two days later, he was sentenced to a 20-month jail term.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hussain |first1=Amir |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/one-eyed-dragon-tan-chor-jins-accomplice-jailed-20-months-after-9-years-on |title='One-eyed Dragon' Tan Chor Jin's accomplice jailed 20 months after 9 years on the run |website=The Straits Times |access-date=13 October 2019 |date=10 August 2016}}</ref>\n*June 2006: Lawyer David Rasif fled with S$11.3 million of his clients' money, one of the largest amount misappropriated by a rogue Singaporean lawyer.

They were armed with a rifle Sek had stolen from Nee Soon camp. All five victims: Tay, his wife, their Filipino maid, Tay's daughter and her tutor were confined to a bedroom. They proceeded to rob Tay's family of their jewellery and cash out money from their bank accounts. While Nyu was guarding the victims, Sek decided to murder all five victims by escorting them one-by-one out of the bedroom in a bid to erase witnesses. Sek proceeded to struck Tay and his wife with a chair and strangled them. Sek also strangled their maid. In all, Sek murdered 3 people. Nyu discovered Sek's murder intentions only when he caught him in the act in another room. Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in. When Sek's repeated requests to open the door was denied by Nyu, Sek immediately fled. Nyu then released Tay's daughter and her tutor. Nyu fled to Malaysia before he surrendered and was extradited to Singapore. Sek was arrested at his sister's home on 29 July, where he attempted suicide when police were closing in on him. During the trial, when asked how he felt when strangling Tay's wife, Sek brought up an incident when he was nearly strangled by someone at the Singapore Boys\u2019 Home until he blacked out.

Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How also ruled that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. This amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment, so his life term was still a jail term of 20 years, and thus he would still be jailed for 38 years.<ref> {{cite web|title=oriental_hotel_murder|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1804_2011-04-04.html}} </ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|title=Former detective Richard Lim Beng Gee, 65, dies: 5 high-profile cases he helped crack / ASSAULT ON TWO JAPANESE TOURISTS IN 5-STAR HOTEL|last=Lee|first=Min Kok|date=2016-01-19|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012154609/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|archive-date=2019-10-12|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep9/367513|title=True Files S3|website=Toggle|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref>\n\n===1995===\n\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

He was charged with murder, but it was found and proven in the middle of the trial that Somsak was fully intoxicated at the time he killed Choochai due to him having consumed too much alcohol before the killing. The charge was then reduced to culpable homicide not amounting to murder; Somsak pleaded guilty and he was then sentenced to 10 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane.\n\n===2006===\n* 15 February 2006: In the first crime involving firearms since 2000, Tan Chor Jin, nicknamed the \"One-eyed Dragon\" forcefully entered the flat of Lim Hock Soon, a nightclub owner. He seized Lim's family valuables before tying up Lim, his wife, his daughter and Lim's maid. He then proceeded to shoot and kill Lim, where five of the six bullets hit Lim. He managed to flee the country with the help of his accomplice, Ho Yueh Keong. He was nabbed by the [[Royal Malaysian Police]] 10 days later at a hotel in Kuala Lumpur before being extradited back to Singapore on 1 March 2006. Initially charged with murder, his charge was amended to discharging of firearm. During the trial, Tan choose to be unrepresented. In one of his defence, he claimed that Lim was about to hit him with a chair and thus shot Lim in self-defence. But his defence fell flat when the prosecution noted that Lim was tied up and could not have lifted the chair. On 22 May 2007, he was found guilty and sentenced to hang.

Though director [[David Ayer]] was initially set to return, he dropped out in December 2016 in favor of ''[[Gotham City Sirens#Film|Gotham City Sirens]]''. Warner Bros. considered multiple directors, including [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Daniel Espinosa]], before hiring [[Gavin O'Connor (filmmaker)|Gavin O'Connor]] in September 2017. However, O'Connor left the project a year later due to creative differences.

Though director [[David Ayer]] was initially set to return, he dropped out in December 2016 in favor of ''[[Gotham City Sirens#Film|Gotham City Sirens]]''. Warner Bros. considered multiple directors, including [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Daniel Espinosa]], before hiring [[Gavin O'Connor (filmmaker)|Gavin O'Connor]] in September 2017. However, O'Connor left the project a year later due to creative differences. In October 2018, [[James Gunn]], who at the time had been fired by [[The Walt Disney Company]] from directing the [[Marvel Studios]] film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3]]'', was hired to write the film, and signed on to direct in January 2019. Gunn looked to the 1980s ''Suicide Squad'' comics for inspiration and chose to focus on new characters rather than continue the 2016 film's narrative. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] in September 2019, and concluded in February 2020.\n\n''The Suicide Squad'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on August 6, 2021.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Margot Robbie]] as [[Harley Quinn|Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn]]: A crazed criminal and former [[psychiatrist]].<ref name=\"ElbaRobbie\" />\n* [[Viola Davis]] as [[Amanda Waller]]: The government official who organized the Suicide Squad and gives out the team's orders.<ref name=\"Davis\" />\n* [[Joel Kinnaman]] as [[Rick Flag]]:<ref name=\"CenaReidJoinCast\"/> The leader of the Suicide Squad.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hough |first1=Q.V. |title=Joel Kinnaman Returning As Rick Flag in James Gunn's Suicide Squad |url=https://screenrant.com/suicide-squad-2-joel-kinnaman-rick-flag-returning/ |website=[[Screen Rant]] |accessdate=July 23, 2019 |date=May 29, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Jai Courtney]] as [[Captain Boomerang|George \"Digger\" Harkness / Captain Boomerang]]: An unhinged thief who uses boomerangs as weapons.<ref name=\"Courtney\" />\n* [[David Dastmalchian]] as [[Polka-Dot Man|Abner Krill / Polka-Dot Man]]<ref name=\"Dastmalchian\">{{cite news |last1=Couch |first1=Aaron |last2=Kit |first2=Borys |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/suicide-squad-sequel-casts-david-dastmalchian-as-polka-dot-man-1205280 |title=James Gunn's 'The Suicide Squad' Casts 'Ant-Man' Actor David Dastmalchian (Exclusive) |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 29, 2019 |accessdate=April 29, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Daniela Melchior]] as [[Ratcatcher (comics)|Ratcatcher]]<ref name=\"Melchior cast\">{{cite web|last=Kroll|first=Justin|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/daniela-melchior-ratcatcher-suicide-squad-sequel-1203201879/|title=Newcomer Daniela Melchior Eyed for Ratcatcher Role in 'Suicide Squad' Sequel (Exclusive)|date=April 30, 2019|accessdate=June 1, 2019|work=Variety}}</ref>\n* [[Steve Agee]] as the voice of [[King Shark]]<ref name=\"Agee cast\">{{cite web |last1=D'Alessandro |first1=Anthony |title=Comedian Steve Agee Joining James Gunn\u2019s \u2018Suicide Squad\u2019 Gang |url=https://deadline.com/2019/08/suicide-squad-james-gunn-casts-steve-agee-king-shark-1202703447/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=August 24, 2019 |date=August 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, [[Idris Elba]], [[John Cena]], [[Storm Reid]],<ref name=\"CenaReidJoinCast\"/> [[Flula Borg]],<ref name=\"Borg cast\">{{cite web|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|url=https://deadline.com/2019/08/suicide-squad-james-gunn-flula-borg-joins-cast-1202671315/|title='Pitch Perfect 2's Flula Borg Joins James Gunn's 'The Suicide Squad'|date=August 19, 2019|accessdate=August 19, 2019|work=Deadline Hollywood}}</ref> [[Nathan Fillion]], [[Peter Capaldi]], [[Pete Davidson]], [[Alice Braga]], [[Sean Gunn]], [[Michael Rooker]], [[Taika Waititi]], [[Joaqu\u00edn Cos\u00edo]], Mayling Ng, [[Juan Diego Botto]], Tinashe Kajese, Julio Ruiz, and Jennifer Holland have been cast in undisclosed roles.<ref name=\"Fillion\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/08/suicide-squad-nathan-fillion-rookie-star-joins-cast-james-gunn-movie-1202702610/|title=Nathan Fillion Boarding James Gunn's 'The Suicide Squad'|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=August 25, 2019|accessdate=August 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Capaldi\">{{cite web|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|url=https://deadline.com/2019/09/suicide-squad-snl-pete-davidson-peter-capaldi-cast-james-gunn-dc-movie-1202709645/|title='Doctor Who's Peter Capaldi Joining James Gunn's 'The Suicide Squad'; Is 'SNL's Pete Davidson Next?|date=September 3, 2019|accessdate=September 3, 2019|website=Deadline Hollywood}}</ref><ref name=\"io9: Cast\">{{cite web |last1=Whitbrook |first1=James |title=Say Hello to the Very Disposable Stars of The Suicide Squad |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/say-hello-to-the-very-disposable-stars-of-the-suicide-s-1838105121 |website=[[io9]] |accessdate=September 13, 2019 |date=September 13, 2019}}</ref> Elba was originally cast as [[Deadshot|Floyd Lawton / Deadshot]], replacing [[Will Smith]] from the first film, but [[Warner Bros.]] and director [[James Gunn]] eventually decided to have him play a new character instead, allowing Smith the opportunity to return in a future film.<ref name=\"ElbaRobbie\" />\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:James Gunn (28557194032) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|James Gunn, writer and director of ''The Suicide Squad'']]\n\nIn March 2016, ahead of the release of ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'', [[Warner Bros.

The revolt had various causes, including the socio-economic and political tensions generated by the [[Black Death]] in the 1340s, the high taxes resulting from the conflict with France during the [[Hundred Years' War]], and instability within the local leadership of London. The final trigger for the revolt was the intervention of a royal official, [[John Bampton (Archdeacon of Lewes)|John Bampton]], in [[Essex]] on 30 May 1381. His attempts to collect unpaid [[poll tax]]es in [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]] ended in a violent confrontation, which rapidly spread across the south-east of the country. A wide spectrum of rural society, including many local artisans and village officials, rose up in protest, burning court records and opening the local [[gaol]]s. The rebels sought a reduction in taxation, an end to the system of [[unfree labour]] known as [[serfdom]], and the removal of the King's senior officials and law courts.\n\nInspired by the sermons of the radical cleric [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] and led by [[Wat Tyler]], a contingent of [[Kent]]ish rebels advanced on London. They were met at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] by representatives of the royal government, who unsuccessfully attempted to persuade them to return home. King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], then aged 14, retreated to the safety of the [[Tower of London]], but most of the royal forces were abroad or in northern England. On 13 June, the rebels entered London and, joined by many local townsfolk, attacked the gaols, destroyed the [[Savoy Palace]], set fire to law books and buildings in [[Temple, London|the Temple]], and killed anyone associated with the royal government. The following day, Richard met the rebels at [[Mile End]] and acceded to most of their demands, including the abolition of serfdom. Meanwhile, rebels entered the Tower of London, killing the [[Simon Sudbury|Lord Chancellor]] and the [[Robert Hales|Lord High Treasurer]], whom they found inside.\n\nOn 15 June, Richard left the city to meet Tyler and the rebels at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]]. Violence broke out, and Richard's party killed Tyler. Richard defused the tense situation long enough for London's mayor, [[William Walworth]], to gather a militia from the city and disperse the rebel forces. Richard immediately began to re-establish order in London and rescinded his previous grants to the rebels. The revolt had also spread into [[East Anglia]], where the [[University of Cambridge]] was attacked and many royal officials were killed. Unrest continued until the intervention of [[Henry Despenser]], who defeated a rebel army at the [[Battle of North Walsham]] on 25 or 26 June. Troubles extended north to [[York]], [[Beverley]] and [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], and as far west as [[Bridgwater]] in [[Somerset]]. Richard mobilised 4,000 soldiers to restore order. Most of the rebel leaders were tracked down and executed; by November, at least 1,500 rebels had been killed.\n\nThe Peasants' Revolt has been widely studied by academics. Late 19th-century historians used a range of sources from contemporary [[chroniclers]] to assemble an account of the uprising, and these were supplemented in the 20th century by research using court records and local archives. Interpretations of the revolt have shifted over the years. It was once seen as a defining moment in English history, but modern academics are less certain of its impact on subsequent social and economic history. The revolt heavily influenced the course of the Hundred Years' War, by deterring later Parliaments from raising additional taxes to pay for military campaigns in France. The revolt has been widely used in [[socialist]] literature, including by the author [[William Morris]], and remains a potent political symbol for the [[Left-wing politics|political left]], informing the arguments surrounding the introduction of the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] in the United Kingdom during the 1980s.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background and causes==\n\n===Economics===\n{{main|Consequences of the Black Death}}\n\nThe Peasants' Revolt was fed by the economic and social upheaval of the 14th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=22\u201323}}</ref> At the start of the century, the majority of English people worked in the countryside economy that fed the country's towns and cities and supported an extensive international trade.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|pp=1\u20133}}</ref> Across much of England, production was organised around [[manor]]s, controlled by local lords&nbsp;\u2013 including the [[gentry]] and the [[Religion in England|Church]]&nbsp;\u2013 and governed through a system of [[manorial court]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=14}}</ref> Some of the population were unfree [[serf]]s, who had to work on their lords' lands for a period each year, although the balance of free and unfree varied across England, and in the south-east there were relatively few serfs.<ref>{{harvnb|Postan|1975|p=172}}</ref> Some serfs were born unfree and could not leave their manors to work elsewhere without the consent of the local lord; others accepted limitations on their freedom as part of the tenure agreement for their farmland.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=14}}; {{harvnb|Postan|1975|p=172}}</ref> Population growth led to pressure on the available agricultural land, increasing the power of local landowners.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=249}}; {{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=15}}</ref>\n\nIn 1348 a plague known as the [[Black Death]] crossed from mainland Europe into England, rapidly killing an estimated 50 per cent of the population.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|pp=271\u2013272}}</ref> After an initial period of economic shock, England began to adapt to the changed economic situation.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|pp=273\u2013274}}</ref> The death rate among the peasantry meant that suddenly land was relatively plentiful and manpower in much shorter supply.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=65}}</ref> Labourers could charge more for their work and, in the consequent competition for labour, wages were driven sharply upwards.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=278}}</ref> In turn, the profits of landowners were eroded.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2000|pp=202\u2013203}}</ref> The trading, commercial and financial networks in the towns disintegrated.<ref>{{harvnb|Butcher|1987|p=86}}</ref>\n\nThe authorities responded to the chaos with emergency legislation; the [[Ordinance of Labourers 1349|Ordinance of Labourers]] was passed in 1349, and the [[Statute of Labourers 1351|Statute of Labourers]] in 1351.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=282}}</ref> These attempted to fix wages at pre-plague levels, making it a crime to refuse work or to break an existing contract, imposing fines on those who transgressed.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=282}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=69}}</ref> The system was initially enforced through special [[Judicial officer|Justices]] of Labourers and then, from the 1360s onwards, through the normal [[Justice of the peace|Justices of the Peace]], typically members of the local gentry.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|pp=282, 285}}</ref> Although in theory these laws applied to both labourers seeking higher wages and to employers tempted to outbid their competitors for workers, they were in practice applied only to labourers, and then in a rather arbitrary fashion.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|pp=282\u2013283}}</ref> The legislation was strengthened in 1361, with the penalties increased to include [[Human branding|branding]] and imprisonment.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=69}}</ref> The royal government had not intervened in this way before, nor allied itself with the local landowners in quite such an obvious or unpopular way.<ref name=\"Dyer 2009 285\">{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=285}}</ref>\n\nOver the next few decades, economic opportunities increased for the English peasantry.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=122}}</ref> Some labourers took up specialist jobs that would have previously been barred to them, and others moved from employer to employer, or became servants in richer households.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=279}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|pp=122\u2013123}}</ref> These changes were keenly felt across the south-east of England, where the London market created a wide range of opportunities for farmers and artisans.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2000|p=200}}</ref> Local lords had the right to prevent serfs from leaving their manors, but when serfs found themselves blocked in the manorial courts, many simply left to work illegally on manors elsewhere.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=122}}; {{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=278}}; {{harvnb|Postan|1975|p=172}}</ref> Wages continued to rise, and between the 1340s and the 1380s the purchasing power of rural labourers increased by around 40 percent.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=279}}</ref> As the wealth of the lower classes increased, Parliament brought in [[Statute Concerning Diet and Apparel 1363|fresh laws in 1363]] to prevent them from consuming expensive goods formerly only affordable by the elite. These [[sumptuary law]]s proved unenforceable, but the wider labour laws continued to be firmly applied.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|pp=283\u2013284}}; {{harvnb|Jones|2010|p=16}}</ref>\n\n===War and finance===\nAnother factor in the revolt of 1381 was the conduct of the war with France. In 1337 [[Edward III of England]] had pressed [[English claims to the French throne|his claims to the French throne]], beginning a long-running conflict that became known as the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Edward had initial successes, but his campaigns were not decisive. [[Charles V of France]] became more active in the conflict after 1369, taking advantage of his country's greater economic strength to commence cross-Channel raids on England.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=121}}; {{harvnb|Sumption|2009|pp=18, 53\u201360}}</ref> By the 1370s, England's armies on the continent were under huge military and financial pressure; the garrisons in [[Calais]] and [[Brest, France|Brest]] alone, for example, were costing \u00a336,000 a year to maintain, while military expeditions could consume \u00a350,000 in only six months.<ref>{{harvnb|Sumption|2009|pp=325\u2013327, 354\u2013355, 405}}; {{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=52}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|It is impossible to accurately compare 14th century and modern prices or incomes.

The revolt had various causes, including the socio-economic and political tensions generated by the [[Black Death]] in the 1340s, the high taxes resulting from the conflict with France during the [[Hundred Years' War]], and instability within the local leadership of London. The final trigger for the revolt was the intervention of a royal official, [[John Bampton (Archdeacon of Lewes)|John Bampton]], in [[Essex]] on 30 May 1381. His attempts to collect unpaid [[poll tax]]es in [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]] ended in a violent confrontation, which rapidly spread across the south-east of the country. A wide spectrum of rural society, including many local artisans and village officials, rose up in protest, burning court records and opening the local [[gaol]]s. The rebels sought a reduction in taxation, an end to the system of [[unfree labour]] known as [[serfdom]], and the removal of the King's senior officials and law courts.\n\nInspired by the sermons of the radical cleric [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] and led by [[Wat Tyler]], a contingent of [[Kent]]ish rebels advanced on London. They were met at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] by representatives of the royal government, who unsuccessfully attempted to persuade them to return home. King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], then aged 14, retreated to the safety of the [[Tower of London]], but most of the royal forces were abroad or in northern England. On 13 June, the rebels entered London and, joined by many local townsfolk, attacked the gaols, destroyed the [[Savoy Palace]], set fire to law books and buildings in [[Temple, London|the Temple]], and killed anyone associated with the royal government. The following day, Richard met the rebels at [[Mile End]] and acceded to most of their demands, including the abolition of serfdom. Meanwhile, rebels entered the Tower of London, killing the [[Simon Sudbury|Lord Chancellor]] and the [[Robert Hales|Lord High Treasurer]], whom they found inside.\n\nOn 15 June, Richard left the city to meet Tyler and the rebels at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]]. Violence broke out, and Richard's party killed Tyler. Richard defused the tense situation long enough for London's mayor, [[William Walworth]], to gather a militia from the city and disperse the rebel forces. Richard immediately began to re-establish order in London and rescinded his previous grants to the rebels. The revolt had also spread into [[East Anglia]], where the [[University of Cambridge]] was attacked and many royal officials were killed. Unrest continued until the intervention of [[Henry Despenser]], who defeated a rebel army at the [[Battle of North Walsham]] on 25 or 26 June. Troubles extended north to [[York]], [[Beverley]] and [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], and as far west as [[Bridgwater]] in [[Somerset]]. Richard mobilised 4,000 soldiers to restore order. Most of the rebel leaders were tracked down and executed; by November, at least 1,500 rebels had been killed.\n\nThe Peasants' Revolt has been widely studied by academics. Late 19th-century historians used a range of sources from contemporary [[chroniclers]] to assemble an account of the uprising, and these were supplemented in the 20th century by research using court records and local archives. Interpretations of the revolt have shifted over the years. It was once seen as a defining moment in English history, but modern academics are less certain of its impact on subsequent social and economic history. The revolt heavily influenced the course of the Hundred Years' War, by deterring later Parliaments from raising additional taxes to pay for military campaigns in France. The revolt has been widely used in [[socialist]] literature, including by the author [[William Morris]], and remains a potent political symbol for the [[Left-wing politics|political left]], informing the arguments surrounding the introduction of the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] in the United Kingdom during the 1980s.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background and causes==\n\n===Economics===\n{{main|Consequences of the Black Death}}\n\nThe Peasants' Revolt was fed by the economic and social upheaval of the 14th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=22\u201323}}</ref> At the start of the century, the majority of English people worked in the countryside economy that fed the country's towns and cities and supported an extensive international trade.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|pp=1\u20133}}</ref> Across much of England, production was organised around [[manor]]s, controlled by local lords&nbsp;\u2013 including the [[gentry]] and the [[Religion in England|Church]]&nbsp;\u2013 and governed through a system of [[manorial court]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=14}}</ref> Some of the population were unfree [[serf]]s, who had to work on their lords' lands for a period each year, although the balance of free and unfree varied across England, and in the south-east there were relatively few serfs.<ref>{{harvnb|Postan|1975|p=172}}</ref> Some serfs were born unfree and could not leave their manors to work elsewhere without the consent of the local lord; others accepted limitations on their freedom as part of the tenure agreement for their farmland.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|p=14}}; {{harvnb|Postan|1975|p=172}}</ref> Population growth led to pressure on the available agricultural land, increasing the power of local landowners.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=249}};

the [[Ordinance of Labourers 1349|Ordinance of Labourers]] was passed in 1349, and the [[Statute of Labourers 1351|Statute of Labourers]] in 1351.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=282}}</ref> These attempted to fix wages at pre-plague levels, making it a crime to refuse work or to break an existing contract, imposing fines on those who transgressed.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=282}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=69}}</ref> The system was initially enforced through special [[Judicial officer|Justices]] of Labourers and then, from the 1360s onwards, through the normal [[Justice of the peace|Justices of the Peace]], typically members of the local gentry.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|pp=282, 285}}</ref> Although in theory these laws applied to both labourers seeking higher wages and to employers tempted to outbid their competitors for workers, they were in practice applied only to labourers, and then in a rather arbitrary fashion.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|pp=282\u2013283}}</ref> The legislation was strengthened in 1361, with the penalties increased to include [[Human branding|branding]] and imprisonment.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=69}}</ref> The royal government had not intervened in this way before, nor allied itself with the local landowners in quite such an obvious or unpopular way.<ref name=\"Dyer 2009 285\">{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=285}}</ref>\n\nOver the next few decades, economic opportunities increased for the English peasantry.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=122}}</ref> Some labourers took up specialist jobs that would have previously been barred to them, and others moved from employer to employer, or became servants in richer households.<ref>{{harvnb|Dyer|2009|p=279}};

Edward had initial successes, but his campaigns were not decisive.

The idea was to upgrade the firepower, mobility and protection of the [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] to allow it to compete on the modern battlefield at a fraction of the cost of a modern [[main battle tank|main battle tank (MBT)]]. The first phase of the upgrade programme was completed in 1997. The second phase started in 1998 when HIT began development and testing of a new tank, a [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] re-built with over 50 modifications, resulting in three prototypes with slightly differing specifications (different fire-control systems, for example). Many systems originally developed for HIT's [[Al-Khalid]] MBT were incorporated. The prototypes underwent extensive testing by HIT and the [[Pakistan Army]], who selected the final version of the tank, dubbed Al-Zarrar.\n\nBy mid 2004, it was expected that 50 AL-Zarrar tanks would be exported to other countries.<ref>{{cite news|title=50 Al Zarrar tanks to be exported this year|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/77650/50-al-zarrar-tanks-to-be-exported-this-year|accessdate=31 July 2015|work=Dawn|date=15 January 2003}}</ref>\nThe '''Al-Zarrar''' is a modern [[main battle tank]] (MBT) developed and manufactured by [[Heavy Industries Taxila|Heavy Industries Taxila (HIT)]] of [[Pakistan]] for the [[Pakistan Army]]. \nAn upgraded variant of the Chinese [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] tank, the Al-Zarrar is cost-effective modern replacement for the [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] fleet of the [[Pakistan Army]]. Equipped with modern [[armament]], [[Fire-control system|fire control]] and ballistic protection, the Al-Zarrar upgrade is also offered by [[Heavy Industries Taxila|HIT]] to the armies of foreign countries to upgrade their [[T-54]]/[[T-55]] or [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] tanks to Al-Zarrar standard. 54 modifications made to the [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] make the Al-Zarrar effectively a new tank.\n\nThe Al-Zarrar development programme started in 1990. HIT began mass production of Al-Zarrar on 6 May 2003 under a renowned Project Manager, Engineer Mahmood Khan. First batch of 88 Al-Zarrar were delivered to the Pakistan Army on 26 February 2004. Delivery ceremony was graced by General Pervez Musharraf.\n\n==Design==\n[[Image:alzarar.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Al-Zarrar MBTs of the [[Pakistan Army]]'s 27th Cavalry regiment stationed at [[Kharian]].]]\n[[Image:alzarar27cav.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Al-Zarrar MBTs of the [[Pakistan Army]]'s 27th Cavalry regiment stationed at [[Kharian]].]]\n\n===Armament and fire-control===\nAl-Zarrar's primary armament is a 125&nbsp;mm [[smoothbore]] [[tank gun]] with an [[autofrettage]]d, chrome-plated gun barrel. It is capable of firing [[APFSDS]], [[HEAT]]-FS and [[High Explosive|HE]]-FS rounds as well as [[anti-tank guided missile]]s and a Pakistani [[depleted uranium|DU (depleted uranium)]] round, the 125&nbsp;mm Naiza. Naiza is capable of penetrating 550&nbsp;mm of RHA armour at a distance of 2&nbsp;km. Reloaded by a semi-automatic [[autoloader]], the gun has a dual-axis stabilization system and thermal imaging sights integrated into the fire-control system for the commander and gunner. The image stabilized fire-control system includes a [[laser range-finder]] for accurate range information and ballistics computer to improve accuracy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} An improved gun control system is also fitted.\n\nThe secondary armament consists of an external 12.7&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft machine gun mounted on the roof of the turret, which can be aimed and fired from inside the tank, and a 7.62&nbsp;mm [[Coaxial weapon|coaxial]] machine gun.\n\n===Mobility===\nThe Al-Zarrar  is powered by a liquid-cooled 12-cylinder [[diesel engine]], giving a power output of {{convert|730|hp|abbr=on}} and torque output of 305&nbsp;kg.m at 1300\u20131400&nbsp;rpm.

The idea was to upgrade the firepower, mobility and protection of the [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] to allow it to compete on the modern battlefield at a fraction of the cost of a modern [[main battle tank|main battle tank (MBT)]]. The first phase of the upgrade programme was completed in 1997. The second phase started in 1998 when HIT began development and testing of a new tank, a [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] re-built with over 50 modifications, resulting in three prototypes with slightly differing specifications (different fire-control systems, for example). Many systems originally developed for HIT's [[Al-Khalid]] MBT were incorporated. The prototypes underwent extensive testing by HIT and the [[Pakistan Army]], who selected the final version of the tank, dubbed Al-Zarrar.\n\nBy mid 2004, it was expected that 50 AL-Zarrar tanks would be exported to other countries.<ref>{{cite news|title=50 Al Zarrar tanks to be exported this year|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/77650/50-al-zarrar-tanks-to-be-exported-this-year|accessdate=31 July 2015|work=Dawn|date=15 January 2003}}</ref>\nThe '''Al-Zarrar''' is a modern [[main battle tank]] (MBT) developed and manufactured by [[Heavy Industries Taxila|Heavy Industries Taxila (HIT)]] of [[Pakistan]] for the [[Pakistan Army]]. \nAn upgraded variant of the Chinese [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] tank, the Al-Zarrar is cost-effective modern replacement for the [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] fleet of the [[Pakistan Army]]. Equipped with modern [[armament]], [[Fire-control system|fire control]] and ballistic protection, the Al-Zarrar upgrade is also offered by [[Heavy Industries Taxila|HIT]] to the armies of foreign countries to upgrade their [[T-54]]/[[T-55]] or [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] tanks to Al-Zarrar standard. 54 modifications made to the [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] make the Al-Zarrar effectively a new tank.\n\nThe Al-Zarrar development programme started in 1990. HIT began mass production of Al-Zarrar on 6 May 2003 under a renowned Project Manager, Engineer Mahmood Khan. First batch of 88 Al-Zarrar were delivered to the Pakistan Army on 26 February 2004. Delivery ceremony was graced by General Pervez Musharraf.\n\n==Design==\n[[Image:alzarar.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Al-Zarrar MBTs of the [[Pakistan Army]]'s 27th Cavalry regiment stationed at [[Kharian]].]]\n[[Image:alzarar27cav.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Al-Zarrar MBTs of the [[Pakistan Army]]'s 27th Cavalry regiment stationed at [[Kharian]].]]\n\n===Armament and fire-control===\nAl-Zarrar's primary armament is a 125&nbsp;mm [[smoothbore]] [[tank gun]] with an [[autofrettage]]d, chrome-plated gun barrel. It is capable of firing [[APFSDS]], [[HEAT]]-FS and [[High Explosive|HE]]-FS rounds as well as [[anti-tank guided missile]]s and a Pakistani [[depleted uranium|DU (depleted uranium)]] round, the 125&nbsp;mm Naiza. Naiza is capable of penetrating 550&nbsp;mm of RHA armour at a distance of 2&nbsp;km. Reloaded by a semi-automatic [[autoloader]], the gun has a dual-axis stabilization system and thermal imaging sights integrated into the fire-control system for the commander and gunner. The image stabilized fire-control system includes a [[laser range-finder]] for accurate range information and ballistics computer to improve accuracy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} An improved gun control system is also fitted.\n\nThe secondary armament consists of an external 12.7&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft machine gun mounted on the roof of the turret, which can be aimed and fired from inside the tank, and a 7.62&nbsp;mm [[Coaxial weapon|coaxial]] machine gun.\n\n===Mobility===\nThe Al-Zarrar  is powered by a liquid-cooled 12-cylinder [[diesel engine]], giving a power output of {{convert|730|hp|abbr=on}} and torque output of 305&nbsp;kg.m at 1300\u20131400&nbsp;rpm. A combat weight of 40 tonnes gives Al-Zarrar a [[power-to-weight ratio]] of 18.3&nbsp;hp/tonne and a top speed of 65&nbsp;km/h. \nCrew comfort is improved over the [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] by a modified [[torsion bar]] suspension system.\n\n===Protection===\nAl-Zarrar uses modular composite armour and [[explosive reactive armour]] to give improved protection from anti-tank missiles, mines and other weapons. \nThe Pakistani ATCOP LTS-1 laser threat warning system is fitted to inform the tank crew if the tank is targeted by a [[laser range-finder]] or [[laser designator]].
