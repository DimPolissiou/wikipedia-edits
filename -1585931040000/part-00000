It is the act of overseeing the organizational, day-to-day operations of a house or estate, and the managing of other domestic concerns. \nA person in charge of the homemaking, who is not employed outside the home, in the United States is called a '''homemaker''', a term for a [[housewife]] or a [[househusband]]. The term \"homemaker\", however, may also refer to a [[social worker]] who manages a household during the incapacity of the housewife or househusband.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/homemaker |title=homemaker - definition of homemaker by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}</ref>\n\nHousework is not always a lifetime commitment; many, for economic or personal reasons, return to the workplace. In previous decades, there were a number of mandatory courses for the young to learn the skills of homemaking.  In high school, courses included [[cooking]], [[nutrition]], [[home economics]], [[family and consumer science]] (FACS), and [[food and cooking hygiene]]. More recently, most of these courses have been abolished, and many youths in high school and college would likely study child development and the management of children's behavior.\n\n== Homemaking and marriage ==\n\n=== 19th century ===\nEarly 19th-century ideals required homemaking be the responsibility of the woman; \u201cthe wife is properly supposed to be the light and centre of the home.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35963?msg=welcome_stranger|title=Courtship and Marriage, and the Gentle Art of Home-Making|last=Swan|first=Annie S.|date=2011-04-25|language=English}}</ref> Traditional wives who stayed home and did not work were required by social ideals to create and maintain a peaceful space to provide to her husband and children. For women in a pre-modern environment, \u201cit is the duty and privilege and solemn responsibility, which make this art of home-making more interesting and important to her than any other art in the world.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> Author of these statements, Annie Swan was not alone in the late 1800s viewpoint that women were encouraged, if not required, to maintain the home solely themselves. In 1875, [[Harper's Bazaar|Harper\u2019s Bazaar]] published an article outlining the duties of a housewife and the esteemed respect those duties deserve: \u201cbut if one only staid to think how countless and how onerous those duties really are, more respect would be paid to the faithful effort to perform the, and an added reverence extended to the mother who is also the housekeeper.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=hearth;idno=4732809_1428_052|title=Home Economics Archive: Research, Tradition, History|website=hearth.library.cornell.edu|access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref> Although Harper\u2019s Bazaar recognizes that women do the majority of the work within the home, the article suggests that the work is detailed and at many times, difficult.\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThe 20th century began with similar homemaking roles as the 19th; however, the century concluded with a much different perception. In the late 1990s, [[marriage]] consisted in most cases of both wife and husband participating in homemaking. Darlene Pi\u00f1a and Vern Bengtson who are [[anthropologist]]s and professors at the [[University of Southern California]], extensively researched marriage dynamics and household labor in the late twentieth century. They concluded that \u201call wives benefit equally by their husbands\u2019 greater involvement in household labor.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pi\u00f1a|first=Darlene L.|last2=Bengtson|first2=Vern L.|date=1993|title=The Division of Household Labor and Wives' Happiness: Ideology, Employment, and Perceptions of Support|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=55|issue=4|pages=901\u2013912|doi=10.2307/352771|issn=0022-2445|jstor=352771}}</ref> The division of labor within the home promotes a healthy relationship between husband and wife. Concluding, that likelihood of increased happiness within marriage is vastly improved when homemaking is shared with the husband. West and Zimmerman, concluded an analysis of over 487 couples and found that \u201cwomen were rewarded for performing feminine behaviors, such as housework, whereas men receive positive reinforcement for engaging in masculine tasks, such breadwinning.\u201d<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Mattering and wives' perceived fairness of the division of household labor|issue=6|pages=976\u2013986|journal=Social Science Research|volume=39|doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2010.04.004|date=November 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast, a study performed by [[Adam Hochschild|Hochschild]] in 1989, concluded that even when wives contributed more than 50% of the household income they often still performed more household labor than their husbands. Hochschild\u2019s study directly debunked the previous theory that women performed housework because they contributed significantly less to household income. Instead, the results of the study indicated that even in marriage dynamics where women contributed more than half of the [[household income]], they still completed the vast majority of homemaking tasks.\n\nMarried women who are economically and emotionally dependent on their husbands are less likely to report the division of [[household]] labor as unfair. This significant group of married women felt that household labor reinforced their female gender identity and connection to femininity.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== 21st century ===\nSex and gender continue to shape the division of household responsibilities in the United States in the twenty-first century. According to the 2018 [[American Time Use Survey]], 84 percent of women and 69 percent of men reported that they spent some time performing household duties, which included \"housework, cooking, lawn care, or household management.\" Women reported spending an average of 2.6 hours a day on household activities, and men 2.0 hours. On a surveyed day, 49% percent of women and 20% of men reported doing housework.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.nr0.htm|title=American Time Use Survey Summary|website=www.bls.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-07-12}}</ref>\n\nMen and women's perception of household responsibilities differ. [[Pew Research Center]]'s 2014 [[Religious Landscape Study]] found that fathers were more likely than mothers to say that chores were evenly split between both partners (56% vs. 46%). When asked, 50% of mothers reported they handled more responsibilities around the house than their partners; only 12% of fathers reported they did more household tasks. Despite this difference in perception, a majority of married U.S. adults (56%) said that sharing household chores as \"very important\" to a successful marriage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/30/sharing-chores-a-key-to-good-marriage-say-majority-of-married-adults/|title=Sharing chores a key to good marriage, say majority of married adults|last=Geiger|first=A.

Brown and Sayaka Kawamura reported that the unequal distribution in housework was attributed mainly to time availability. They concluded: \u201cwives typically work fewer hours than their husbands, [so] they have more time available to perform household tasks.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Housekeeping==\n[[File:dyson.cleaner.dc07.arp.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[vacuum cleaner]]]]\n[[Housekeeping]] by the homemaker is the care and control of property, ensuring its maintenance and proper use and appearance. A [[home]] is a place of residence.<ref name=\"defhome\">{{cite dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/home |title='Home' - Definitions from Dictionary.com|dictionary=[[Dictionary.com]] |accessdate=2008-05-08}}</ref> In a private home a [[maid]] or [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] might be employed to do some of the housekeeping. Housework is work done by the act of housekeeping. Some housekeeping is housecleaning and some housekeeping is home chores. Home chores are housework that needs to be done at regular intervals,<ref>Gove, Philip et al. 1961. ''Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language'' Unabridged. Springfield, Massachusetts: G & C Merriam Company</ref> Housekeeping includes the budget and control of expenditures, preparing meals and buying food, paying the heat bill, and cleaning the house.<ref>Ansley, Clark et al. 1935. ''The Columbia Encyclopedia in One Volume''. Morningside Heights, NY: Columbia University Press.</ref>\n\n===Cooking===\n{{main|Cooking}}\n{{See also|List of food preparation utensils|Diet (nutrition)|Cuisine|Cookbook}}\nMost modern-day houses contain [[Sanitation|sanitary facilities]] and a means of [[Cooking|preparing food]]. A [[kitchen]] is a room or part of a room used by the Homemaker for [[cooking]], [[food preparation]] and food preservation. In the West, a modern kitchen is typically equipped with a [[stove]], an oven, a [[sink]] with hot and cold running water, a [[refrigerator]] and [[kitchen cabinet]]s. Many homemakers use a [[microwave oven]], a [[dishwasher]] and other electric appliances like [[blender]] and convection [[cooker]] and automatic appliances like [[rotimatic]] and automatic cookers. The main function of a kitchen is cooking or preparing food but it may also be used for [[dining]] and [[entertaining]].\n\n[[Cooking]] is the process of preparing [[food]] with or without [[heat]], making and selecting, measuring and combining ingredients in an ordered procedure for producing safe and edible food. The process encompasses a vast range of methods, tools and combinations of [[ingredient]]s to alter the [[flavor]], appearance, texture, or [[digestion|digestibility]] of food. Factors affecting the final outcome include the variability of ingredients, ambient conditions, [[tool]]s, and the skill of the individual doing the actual cooking.\n\nThe diversity of cooking worldwide is a reflection of the aesthetic, agricultural, economic, cultural, social and religious diversity throughout the nations, races, creeds and tribes across the globe. Applying heat to a food usually, though not always, [[chemistry|chemically]] transforms it, thus changing its flavor, texture, consistency, appearance, and nutritional properties. Methods of cooking that involve the boiling of [[liquid]] in a receptacle have been practised at least since the 10th millennium BC, with the introduction of [[pottery]].\n\n===Cleaning===\n[[Housecleaning]] by the homemaker is the systematic process of making a home neat and clean. This may be applied more broadly that just an individual home, or as a metaphor for a similar \"clean up\" process applied elsewhere such as a procedural reform. In the process of housecleaning general cleaning activities are completed, such as disposing of [[Waste|rubbish]], storing of belongings in regular places, cleaning dirty surfaces, [[dust]]ing and [[Vacuum cleaner|vacuuming]]. The details of this are various and complicated enough that many books have been published on the subject. How-to sites on the internet have many articles on housecleaning. Tools include the [[vacuum cleaner]], [[broom]] and [[mop]]. Supplies such as [[Detergent|cleaning solutions]] and sponges are sold in grocery stores and elsewhere. Professional cleaners can be hired for less frequent or specialist tasks such as cleaning blinds, rugs, and sofas. Professional services are also offered for the basic tasks. Safety is a consideration because some cleaning products are [[toxic]] and some cleaning tasks are physically demanding. ''[[Green cleaning]]'' refers to cleaning without causing pollution. The history of housecleaning has links to the advancement of technology.\n\nOutdoor housecleaning chores include removing leaves from rain gutters, washing windows, sweeping doormats, cleaning the pool, putting away lawn furniture, and taking out the trash.<ref>Smallin, Donna. 2006. ''Cleaning Plain & Simple''. Storey Publishing, North Adams, MA.</ref>\n\n===Laundry===\n{{see also|Ironing}}\n[[File:Waschvollautomat Constructa 1950er.jpg|thumb|left|A 1950s [[washing machine]]]]\n\n[[Laundry]] refers to the act of [[washing]] [[clothing]] and [[linen]]s, the place where that washing is done, and/or that which needs to be, is being, or has been laundered. Various chemicals may be used to increase the solvent power of water, such as the compounds in [[soaproot]] or yucca-root used by Native American tribes. [[Soap]], a compound made from [[lye]] (from wood-ash) and [[fat]], is an ancient and very common laundry aid. Modern [[washing machine]]s typically use powdered or liquid [[laundry detergent]] in place of more traditional soap. Once clean, the clothes have been wrung out \u2014 twisted to remove most of the water. Then they were hung up on poles or clotheslines to air dry, or sometimes just spread out on clean grass.\n\nWashing machines and dryers are now fixtures in homes around the world. In some parts of the world, including the USA, Canada, and Switzerland, [[apartment building]]s and [[dormitory|dormitories]] often have laundry rooms, where residents share washing machines and dryers. Usually the machines are set to run only when money is put in a [[Currency detector|coin slot]]. In other parts of the world, apartment buildings with laundry rooms are uncommon, and each apartment may have its own washing machine. Those without a machine at home or the use of a laundry room must either wash their clothes by hand or visit a commercial [[laundromat]].\n\nA [[clothes dryer]] is a household appliance that is used to remove moisture from a load of [[clothing]] and other [[textiles]], generally shortly after they are cleaned in a washing machine. Most dryers consist of a rotating [[drum]] called a tumbler through which heated air is circulated to [[evaporate]] the moisture from the load. The tumbler is rotated relatively slowly in order to maintain space between the articles in the load. In most cases, the tumbler is belt-driven by an [[induction motor]]. Using these machines may cause clothes to shrink, become less soft (due to loss of short soft fibers/ lint) and fade. For these reasons, as well as environmental concerns, many people use open air methods such as a [[clothes line]] and [[clotheshorse]].\n\n[[starch|Laundry starch]] is used in the [[laundry|laundering]] of [[clothing|clothes]]. Starch was widely used in [[Europe]] in the 16th and 17th centuries to stiffen the wide collars and [[Ruff (clothing)|ruffs]] of fine linen which surrounded the necks of the well-to-do. During the 19th century and early 20th century, it was stylish to stiffen the collars and sleeves of men's [[shirt]]s and the ruffles of girls' [[petticoat]]s by applying starch to them as the clean clothes were being [[ironing|ironed]]. Aside from the smooth, crisp edges it gave to clothing, it served practical purposes as well. [[dust|Dirt]] and [[sweat]] from a person's neck and wrists would stick to the starch rather than to the fibers of the clothing, and would easily wash away along with the starch. After each laundering, the starch would be reapplied. Today the product is sold in [[Aerosol spray|aerosol cans]] for home use. Kitchen starch used thickening agent for food can also be applied to laundered fabrics (requires boiling).\n\n==Maintenance==\n{{main|Maintenance, repair and operations}}\nHomemakers that follow [[predictive maintenance]] techniques determine the condition of in-service equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed. This approach offers cost savings over routine or time-based maintenance, because tasks are performed only when warranted. Homemakers that follow [[preventive maintenance]] methods ensure that household equipment and the house are in satisfactory operating condition by providing for inspection, detection, and correction of incipient failures either before they occur or before they develop into major defects.\n\n===Home maintenance===\n{{main|Home repair|Home improvement|Home automation| Handyman}}\n[[Home maintenance]] involves the diagnosis and resolution of problems in a home, and is related to home maintenance to avoid such problems. Many types of maintenance are \"[[Do it yourself]]\" (DIY) projects. Maintenance is not necessarily the same as [[home improvement]], although many improvements can result from repairs or maintenance. Often the costs of larger repairs will justify the alternative of investment in full-scale improvements. It may make just as much sense to upgrade a home system (with an improved one) as to repair it or incur ever-more-frequent and expensive maintenance for an inefficient, obsolete or dying system. For a DIY project, also useful is the established limits on time and money investments before a repair (or list of repairs) become overwhelming and discouraging, and less likely to ever be completed.\n\n===Lawn maintenance===\n{{main|Lawn care | Gardening}}\nHomemakers that have a lawn responsibility adhere to seasonal [[lawn care]] practices, which vary to some extent depending on the [[climate zone]] and type of [[grass]] that is grown (whether cool season or warm season varieties). Various recognized method used by homemakers in lawn care are observed in any area. In spring or early summer, homemakers seed, sod, or sprig a yard when the ground is warmer. In Summer lawn mowers are used at high cutting for cool season grass, and lower cutting for warm season lawns. In autumn, lawns are mown by homemakers at a lower height and thatch build-up that occurs in warm season grasses are removed.<ref>Lawn experts are divided in their opinions on this.</ref> Homemakers do add sandy [[loam]] and apply fertilizer, containing some type of wetting agent. Cool season lawns are planted in the autumn with adequate rainfall. Lawn care in the winter is minimal, requiring only light feedings of organic material, such as green-waste compost, and minerals to encourage earthworms and beneficial microbes.\n\n==Management==\nHousehold management by the homemaker is the act of overseeing the [[organizing (management)|organizational]], financial, and day-to-day operations of a house or estate. It differs from [[housekeeping]], which consists of the physical maintenance and cleaning of a house.\n\nAlso common in the U.S are homemaking parties which involve a group of people doing household work instead of hanging out with their friends.\n\n===House organization===\nHouse organization or home organization includes [[interior design]] to make the home aesthetically pleasing by arranging furniture, plants, blinds, and so forth.  [[De-cluttering]] means removing unnecessary things from the house.\n\n====De-cluttering====\nHousehold de-cluttering involves putting things in their proper place after they have been used.  \"Cleaning up your mess\" might involve removing glasses or eating utensils from the living room if you have eaten a meal there in front of the television.  If several people have done that over a few days and not removed their glasses, dishes and utensils from the living room, the living room is considered to be \"cluttered\" with dishes.  The dishes are out of place because they belong in the kitchen, washed and put away in the cupboards. That is the most common example of clutter in a modern American household.\n\nThere is another definition of clutter, which refers to having simply too many things and not enough room for all of it.  Sometimes as happens in Asian households, the items are necessary, but the home is simply too small, and ingenious methods are needed to organize everything to minimize unsightly clutter.  Removing unneeded or no longer necessary objects from a household or home is also an aspect of de-cluttering. Objects can be [[Gift|given away]] to friends or [[Charitable organization|charitable]] organizations, [[selling|sold]] as [[second-hand]], [[Recycling|recycled]] or [[Waste management|thrown away]].\n\nExtreme forms of an inability to de-clutter is a behavioral aspect of [[compulsive hoarding]]. On the other end, a society that relies overly much on generating and then disposing of [[waste]] is referred to as a [[throw-away society]].\n\n===Household purchasing===\n{{Main|Purchasing | Household budget | Shopping}}\nHousehold [[purchasing]] refers to homemaker's attempt to acquire goods or services to accomplish the goals of the household. Though there are several households that attempt to set standards in the purchasing process, processes can vary greatly between households. Typically the word \u201cpurchasing\u201d is not used interchangeably with the word \u201c[[procurement]]\u201d, since procurement typically includes other concepts. Home makers decide the market goods that the household will buy, such as the [[groceries]] which have been bought at a [[grocer]]'s.\n\nAnother important purchase handled by homemakers is the power source used for appliances. Home or other building heating may include boilers, [[furnace]]s, and [[water heating|water heaters]]. [[Compressed natural gas]] is used in [[rural]] homes without connections to [[plumbing|piped]]-in [[public utility]] services, or with portable [[Grill (cooking)|grills]]. However, due to being less economical than [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], LPG (Propane) is the dominant source of rural gas for natural gas-powered ranges and/or ovens, natural gas-heated [[clothes dryer]]s, [[HVAC|heating]]/[[air conditioning|cooling]] and [[central heating]]. The amount of usages is determined by factors such as [[natural gas prices]].\n\n===Servants===\n{{main|Maid|Butler|Domestic worker}}\nHomemakers may manage household workers or \"[[domestic worker]]s\".\n\n==Work strategies==\n{{main|Household|Employment}}\nIn [[sociology]], ''household work strategy'' is the [[division of labour]] between members of a household, whether implicit or the result of explicit decision\u2013making, with the alternatives weighed up in a simplified type of [[cost-benefit analysis]].<ref name=\"essex-pahl\">[http://www.essex.ac.uk/Sociology/people/staff/pahl.shtm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204011627/http://www.essex.ac.uk/Sociology/people/staff/pahl.shtm |date=December 4, 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"DivisionsLabour\">''Divisions of Labour'' Ray Pahl (1984)</ref> It is a plan for the relative deployment of household members' time between the three domains of [[employment]]:\n# in the ''[[market economy]]'', including home-based self-employment second jobs, in order to obtain money to buy goods and services in the market;\n# ''domestic production work'', such as cultivating a vegetable patch or raising chickens, purely to supply food to the household; and\n# ''domestic consumption work'' to provide goods and services directly within the household, such as cooking meals, child\u2013care, household repairs, or the manufacture of clothes and gifts.\nHousehold work strategies may vary over the life-cycle, as household members age, or with the economic environment; they may be imposed by one person or be decided collectively.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-householdworkstrategy.html|title=Household work strategy|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=2015-07-02}}</ref>\n\n==Household production==\n\"Household production\" is an economic category for activities including homemaking. It is defined as \"the production of the goods and services by the members of a household, for their own consumption, using their own capital and their own [[unpaid work|unpaid labor]]. Goods and services produced by households for their own use include accommodation, meals, clean clothes, and child care. The process of household production involves the transformation of purchased intermediate commodities into final consumption commodities. Households use their own capital and their own labor.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Ironmonger, D. |url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/mlb/wpaper/759.html |title=Household Production and the Household Economy |publisher=Ideas.repec.org |date=2000-02-02 |accessdate=2015-07-02}}</ref>\n\nThere are efforts to construct estimates of the value of household production in a way analogous to [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]], though the category is not usually included in GDP.<ref>U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. [https://www.bea.gov/help/faq/1297 Why isn't household production included in GDP?], bea.gov, April 2018</ref> Goods and services created by households are generally consumed within the same country, and hence contribute in a \"Domestic Consumption\" category in [[national accounts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/business-english/domestic-consumption|title=Domestic Consumption|publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org|accessdate=2015-07-02}}</ref>\n\n==Wages for housework==\nThe [[Wages for housework|International Wages for Housework Campaign]] was a global, social movement co-founded in 1972 in [[Padua]], Italy, by author and activist [[Selma James]]. The Campaign was formed to raise awareness of how housework and [[childcare]] are the base of all industrial work and to stake the claim that these unavoidable tasks should be compensated as paid, wage labor.<ref>{{cite journal|last=James|first=Selma|title=Is Transformation Possible?

These include:\n* [[Washing machine]]\n* [[Clothes dryer]]\n* [[Dishwasher]]\n* [[Sewing machine]]\n* [[Vacuum cleaner]]\n* [[Small electrics]] like the [[electric mixer]], [[blender]], [[toaster]], and [[coffee maker]]\n* [[Microwave oven]]\n* [[Refrigerator]], reducing the number of grocery trips or the amount of food preservation work to do\n\n[[Utilities]] can potentially eliminate work like gathering and chopping firewood, shovelling coal, fetching water from outdoors, and heating cold tap water.\n\nHistorian [[Ruth Schwartz Cowan]] estimated that homemakers in the 1800s performed about 50\u201360 hours of work per week, and that this is the same as the 1990s.  She says that, rather than reducing the amount of time devoted to housework, labor-saving devices have been used to make the same amount of time do more work, such as by vacuuming a rug instead of sweeping it, or washing fabrics more frequently.  Modern parents also more frequently transport their children to after-school activities, and doctors no longer make house calls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines//epi1088.htm |title=No. 1088: Housework |website=Uh.edu |date=2004-08-01 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Housing}}\n* [[Handyman]]\n* [[Home economics]]\n* [[Scientific management]]\n\n==References and sources==\n;References\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n;Sources\n* Lopata, H.

More recently, most of these courses have been abolished, and many youths in high school and college would likely study child development and the management of children's behavior.\n\n== Homemaking and marriage ==\n\n=== 19th century ===\nEarly 19th-century ideals required homemaking be the responsibility of the woman; \u201cthe wife is properly supposed to be the light and centre of the home.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35963?msg=welcome_stranger|title=Courtship and Marriage, and the Gentle Art of Home-Making|last=Swan|first=Annie S.|date=2011-04-25|language=English}}</ref> Traditional wives who stayed home and did not work were required by social ideals to create and maintain a peaceful space to provide to her husband and children. For women in a pre-modern environment, \u201cit is the duty and privilege and solemn responsibility, which make this art of home-making more interesting and important to her than any other art in the world.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> Author of these statements, Annie Swan was not alone in the late 1800s viewpoint that women were encouraged, if not required, to maintain the home solely themselves. In 1875, [[Harper's Bazaar|Harper\u2019s Bazaar]] published an article outlining the duties of a housewife and the esteemed respect those duties deserve: \u201cbut if one only staid to think how countless and how onerous those duties really are, more respect would be paid to the faithful effort to perform the, and an added reverence extended to the mother who is also the housekeeper.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=hearth;idno=4732809_1428_052|title=Home Economics Archive: Research, Tradition, History|website=hearth.library.cornell.edu|access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref> Although Harper\u2019s Bazaar recognizes that women do the majority of the work within the home, the article suggests that the work is detailed and at many times, difficult.\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThe 20th century began with similar homemaking roles as the 19th; however, the century concluded with a much different perception. In the late 1990s, [[marriage]] consisted in most cases of both wife and husband participating in homemaking. Darlene Pi\u00f1a and Vern Bengtson who are [[anthropologist]]s and professors at the [[University of Southern California]], extensively researched marriage dynamics and household labor in the late twentieth century. They concluded that \u201call wives benefit equally by their husbands\u2019 greater involvement in household labor.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pi\u00f1a|first=Darlene L.|last2=Bengtson|first2=Vern L.|date=1993|title=The Division of Household Labor and Wives' Happiness: Ideology, Employment, and Perceptions of Support|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=55|issue=4|pages=901\u2013912|doi=10.2307/352771|issn=0022-2445|jstor=352771}}</ref> The division of labor within the home promotes a healthy relationship between husband and wife. Concluding, that likelihood of increased happiness within marriage is vastly improved when homemaking is shared with the husband. West and Zimmerman, concluded an analysis of over 487 couples and found that \u201cwomen were rewarded for performing feminine behaviors, such as housework, whereas men receive positive reinforcement for engaging in masculine tasks, such breadwinning.\u201d<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Mattering and wives' perceived fairness of the division of household labor|issue=6|pages=976\u2013986|journal=Social Science Research|volume=39|doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2010.04.004|date=November 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast, a study performed by [[Adam Hochschild|Hochschild]] in 1989, concluded that even when wives contributed more than 50% of the household income they often still performed more household labor than their husbands. Hochschild\u2019s study directly debunked the previous theory that women performed housework because they contributed significantly less to household income. Instead, the results of the study indicated that even in marriage dynamics where women contributed more than half of the [[household income]], they still completed the vast majority of homemaking tasks.\n\nMarried women who are economically and emotionally dependent on their husbands are less likely to report the division of [[household]] labor as unfair. This significant group of married women felt that household labor reinforced their female gender identity and connection to femininity.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== 21st century ===\nSex and gender continue to shape the division of household responsibilities in the United States in the twenty-first century. According to the 2018 [[American Time Use Survey]], 84 percent of women and 69 percent of men reported that they spent some time performing household duties, which included \"housework, cooking, lawn care, or household management.\" Women reported spending an average of 2.6 hours a day on household activities, and men 2.0 hours. On a surveyed day, 49% percent of women and 20% of men reported doing housework.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.nr0.htm|title=American Time Use Survey Summary|website=www.bls.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-07-12}}</ref>\n\nMen and women's perception of household responsibilities differ. [[Pew Research Center]]'s 2014 [[Religious Landscape Study]] found that fathers were more likely than mothers to say that chores were evenly split between both partners (56% vs. 46%). When asked, 50% of mothers reported they handled more responsibilities around the house than their partners; only 12% of fathers reported they did more household tasks. Despite this difference in perception, a majority of married U.S. adults (56%) said that sharing household chores as \"very important\" to a successful marriage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/30/sharing-chores-a-key-to-good-marriage-say-majority-of-married-adults/|title=Sharing chores a key to good marriage, say majority of married adults|last=Geiger|first=A.

Brown and Sayaka Kawamura reported that the unequal distribution in housework was attributed mainly to time availability. They concluded: \u201cwives typically work fewer hours than their husbands, [so] they have more time available to perform household tasks.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Housekeeping==\n[[File:dyson.cleaner.dc07.arp.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[vacuum cleaner]]]]\n[[Housekeeping]] by the homemaker is the care and control of property, ensuring its maintenance and proper use and appearance. A [[home]] is a place of residence.<ref name=\"defhome\">{{cite dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/home |title='Home' - Definitions from Dictionary.com|dictionary=[[Dictionary.com]] |accessdate=2008-05-08}}</ref> In a private home a [[maid]] or [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] might be employed to do some of the housekeeping. Housework is work done by the act of housekeeping. Some housekeeping is housecleaning and some housekeeping is home chores. Home chores are housework that needs to be done at regular intervals,<ref>Gove, Philip et al. 1961. ''Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language'' Unabridged. Springfield, Massachusetts: G & C Merriam Company</ref> Housekeeping includes the budget and control of expenditures, preparing meals and buying food, paying the heat bill, and cleaning the house.<ref>Ansley, Clark et al. 1935. ''The Columbia Encyclopedia in One Volume''. Morningside Heights, NY: Columbia University Press.</ref>\n\n===Cooking===\n{{main|Cooking}}\n{{See also|List of food preparation utensils|Diet (nutrition)|Cuisine|Cookbook}}\nMost modern-day houses contain [[Sanitation|sanitary facilities]] and a means of [[Cooking|preparing food]]. A [[kitchen]] is a room or part of a room used by the Homemaker for [[cooking]], [[food preparation]] and food preservation. In the West, a modern kitchen is typically equipped with a [[stove]], an oven, a [[sink]] with hot and cold running water, a [[refrigerator]] and [[kitchen cabinet]]s. Many homemakers use a [[microwave oven]], a [[dishwasher]] and other electric appliances like [[blender]] and convection [[cooker]] and automatic appliances like [[rotimatic]] and automatic cookers. The main function of a kitchen is cooking or preparing food but it may also be used for [[dining]] and [[entertaining]].\n\n[[Cooking]] is the process of preparing [[food]] with or without [[heat]], making and selecting, measuring and combining ingredients in an ordered procedure for producing safe and edible food. The process encompasses a vast range of methods, tools and combinations of [[ingredient]]s to alter the [[flavor]], appearance, texture, or [[digestion|digestibility]] of food. Factors affecting the final outcome include the variability of ingredients, ambient conditions, [[tool]]s, and the skill of the individual doing the actual cooking.\n\nThe diversity of cooking worldwide is a reflection of the aesthetic, agricultural, economic, cultural, social and religious diversity throughout the nations, races, creeds and tribes across the globe. Applying heat to a food usually, though not always, [[chemistry|chemically]] transforms it, thus changing its flavor, texture, consistency, appearance, and nutritional properties. Methods of cooking that involve the boiling of [[liquid]] in a receptacle have been practised at least since the 10th millennium BC, with the introduction of [[pottery]].\n\n===Cleaning===\n[[Housecleaning]] by the homemaker is the systematic process of making a home neat and clean. This may be applied more broadly that just an individual home, or as a metaphor for a similar \"clean up\" process applied elsewhere such as a procedural reform. In the process of housecleaning general cleaning activities are completed, such as disposing of [[Waste|rubbish]], storing of belongings in regular places, cleaning dirty surfaces, [[dust]]ing and [[Vacuum cleaner|vacuuming]]. The details of this are various and complicated enough that many books have been published on the subject. How-to sites on the internet have many articles on housecleaning. Tools include the [[vacuum cleaner]], [[broom]] and [[mop]]. Supplies such as [[Detergent|cleaning solutions]] and sponges are sold in grocery stores and elsewhere. Professional cleaners can be hired for less frequent or specialist tasks such as cleaning blinds, rugs, and sofas. Professional services are also offered for the basic tasks. Safety is a consideration because some cleaning products are [[toxic]] and some cleaning tasks are physically demanding. ''[[Green cleaning]]'' refers to cleaning without causing pollution. The history of housecleaning has links to the advancement of technology.\n\nOutdoor housecleaning chores include removing leaves from rain gutters, washing windows, sweeping doormats, cleaning the pool, putting away lawn furniture, and taking out the trash.<ref>Smallin, Donna. 2006. ''Cleaning Plain & Simple''. Storey Publishing, North Adams, MA.</ref>\n\n===Laundry===\n{{see also|Ironing}}\n[[File:Waschvollautomat Constructa 1950er.jpg|thumb|left|A 1950s [[washing machine]]]]\n\n[[Laundry]] refers to the act of [[washing]] [[clothing]] and [[linen]]s, the place where that washing is done, and/or that which needs to be, is being, or has been laundered. Various chemicals may be used to increase the solvent power of water, such as the compounds in [[soaproot]] or yucca-root used by Native American tribes. [[Soap]], a compound made from [[lye]] (from wood-ash) and [[fat]], is an ancient and very common laundry aid. Modern [[washing machine]]s typically use powdered or liquid [[laundry detergent]] in place of more traditional soap. Once clean, the clothes have been wrung out \u2014 twisted to remove most of the water. Then they were hung up on poles or clotheslines to air dry, or sometimes just spread out on clean grass.\n\nWashing machines and dryers are now fixtures in homes around the world. In some parts of the world, including the USA, Canada, and Switzerland, [[apartment building]]s and [[dormitory|dormitories]] often have laundry rooms, where residents share washing machines and dryers. Usually the machines are set to run only when money is put in a [[Currency detector|coin slot]]. In other parts of the world, apartment buildings with laundry rooms are uncommon, and each apartment may have its own washing machine. Those without a machine at home or the use of a laundry room must either wash their clothes by hand or visit a commercial [[laundromat]].\n\nA [[clothes dryer]] is a household appliance that is used to remove moisture from a load of [[clothing]] and other [[textiles]], generally shortly after they are cleaned in a washing machine. Most dryers consist of a rotating [[drum]] called a tumbler through which heated air is circulated to [[evaporate]] the moisture from the load. The tumbler is rotated relatively slowly in order to maintain space between the articles in the load. In most cases, the tumbler is belt-driven by an [[induction motor]]. Using these machines may cause clothes to shrink, become less soft (due to loss of short soft fibers/ lint) and fade. For these reasons, as well as environmental concerns, many people use open air methods such as a [[clothes line]] and [[clotheshorse]].\n\n[[starch|Laundry starch]] is used in the [[laundry|laundering]] of [[clothing|clothes]]. Starch was widely used in [[Europe]] in the 16th and 17th centuries to stiffen the wide collars and [[Ruff (clothing)|ruffs]] of fine linen which surrounded the necks of the well-to-do. During the 19th century and early 20th century, it was stylish to stiffen the collars and sleeves of men's [[shirt]]s and the ruffles of girls' [[petticoat]]s by applying starch to them as the clean clothes were being [[ironing|ironed]]. Aside from the smooth, crisp edges it gave to clothing, it served practical purposes as well. [[dust|Dirt]] and [[sweat]] from a person's neck and wrists would stick to the starch rather than to the fibers of the clothing, and would easily wash away along with the starch. After each laundering, the starch would be reapplied. Today the product is sold in [[Aerosol spray|aerosol cans]] for home use. Kitchen starch used thickening agent for food can also be applied to laundered fabrics (requires boiling).\n\n==Maintenance==\n{{main|Maintenance, repair and operations}}\nHomemakers that follow [[predictive maintenance]] techniques determine the condition of in-service equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed. This approach offers cost savings over routine or time-based maintenance, because tasks are performed only when warranted. Homemakers that follow [[preventive maintenance]] methods ensure that household equipment and the house are in satisfactory operating condition by providing for inspection, detection, and correction of incipient failures either before they occur or before they develop into major defects.\n\n===Home maintenance===\n{{main|Home repair|Home improvement|Home automation| Handyman}}\n[[Home maintenance]] involves the diagnosis and resolution of problems in a home, and is related to home maintenance to avoid such problems. Many types of maintenance are \"[[Do it yourself]]\" (DIY) projects. Maintenance is not necessarily the same as [[home improvement]], although many improvements can result from repairs or maintenance. Often the costs of larger repairs will justify the alternative of investment in full-scale improvements. It may make just as much sense to upgrade a home system (with an improved one) as to repair it or incur ever-more-frequent and expensive maintenance for an inefficient, obsolete or dying system. For a DIY project, also useful is the established limits on time and money investments before a repair (or list of repairs) become overwhelming and discouraging, and less likely to ever be completed.\n\n===Lawn maintenance===\n{{main|Lawn care | Gardening}}\nHomemakers that have a lawn responsibility adhere to seasonal [[lawn care]] practices, which vary to some extent depending on the [[climate zone]] and type of [[grass]] that is grown (whether cool season or warm season varieties). Various recognized method used by homemakers in lawn care are observed in any area. In spring or early summer, homemakers seed, sod, or sprig a yard when the ground is warmer. In Summer lawn mowers are used at high cutting for cool season grass, and lower cutting for warm season lawns. In autumn, lawns are mown by homemakers at a lower height and thatch build-up that occurs in warm season grasses are removed.<ref>Lawn experts are divided in their opinions on this.</ref> Homemakers do add sandy [[loam]] and apply fertilizer, containing some type of wetting agent. Cool season lawns are planted in the autumn with adequate rainfall. Lawn care in the winter is minimal, requiring only light feedings of organic material, such as green-waste compost, and minerals to encourage earthworms and beneficial microbes.\n\n==Management==\nHousehold management by the homemaker is the act of overseeing the [[organizing (management)|organizational]], financial, and day-to-day operations of a house or estate. It differs from [[housekeeping]], which consists of the physical maintenance and cleaning of a house.\n\nAlso common in the U.S are homemaking parties which involve a group of people doing household work instead of hanging out with their friends.\n\n===House organization===\nHouse organization or home organization includes [[interior design]] to make the home aesthetically pleasing by arranging furniture, plants, blinds, and so forth.  [[De-cluttering]] means removing unnecessary things from the house.\n\n====De-cluttering====\nHousehold de-cluttering involves putting things in their proper place after they have been used.  \"Cleaning up your mess\" might involve removing glasses or eating utensils from the living room if you have eaten a meal there in front of the television.  If several people have done that over a few days and not removed their glasses, dishes and utensils from the living room, the living room is considered to be \"cluttered\" with dishes.  The dishes are out of place because they belong in the kitchen, washed and put away in the cupboards. That is the most common example of clutter in a modern American household.\n\nThere is another definition of clutter, which refers to having simply too many things and not enough room for all of it.  Sometimes as happens in Asian households, the items are necessary, but the home is simply too small, and ingenious methods are needed to organize everything to minimize unsightly clutter.  Removing unneeded or no longer necessary objects from a household or home is also an aspect of de-cluttering. Objects can be [[Gift|given away]] to friends or [[Charitable organization|charitable]] organizations, [[selling|sold]] as [[second-hand]], [[Recycling|recycled]] or [[Waste management|thrown away]].\n\nExtreme forms of an inability to de-clutter is a behavioral aspect of [[compulsive hoarding]]. On the other end, a society that relies overly much on generating and then disposing of [[waste]] is referred to as a [[throw-away society]].\n\n===Household purchasing===\n{{Main|Purchasing | Household budget | Shopping}}\nHousehold [[purchasing]] refers to homemaker's attempt to acquire goods or services to accomplish the goals of the household. Though there are several households that attempt to set standards in the purchasing process, processes can vary greatly between households. Typically the word \u201cpurchasing\u201d is not used interchangeably with the word \u201c[[procurement]]\u201d, since procurement typically includes other concepts. Home makers decide the market goods that the household will buy, such as the [[groceries]] which have been bought at a [[grocer]]'s.\n\nAnother important purchase handled by homemakers is the power source used for appliances. Home or other building heating may include boilers, [[furnace]]s, and [[water heater]]s. [[Compressed natural gas]] is used in [[rural]] homes without connections to [[plumbing|piped]]-in [[public utility]] services, or with portable [[Grill (cooking)|grills]]. However, due to being less economical than [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], LPG (Propane) is the dominant source of rural gas for natural gas-powered ranges and/or ovens, natural gas-heated [[clothes dryer]]s, [[HVAC|heating]]/[[air conditioning|cooling]] and [[central heating]]. The amount of usages is determined by factors such as [[natural gas prices]].\n\n===Servants===\n{{main|Maid|Butler|Domestic worker}}\nHomemakers may manage household workers or \"[[domestic worker]]s\".\n\n==Work strategies==\n{{main|Household|Employment}}\nIn [[sociology]], ''household work strategy'' is the [[division of labour]] between members of a household, whether implicit or the result of explicit decision\u2013making, with the alternatives weighed up in a simplified type of [[cost-benefit analysis]].<ref name=\"essex-pahl\">[http://www.essex.ac.uk/Sociology/people/staff/pahl.shtm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204011627/http://www.essex.ac.uk/Sociology/people/staff/pahl.shtm |date=December 4, 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"DivisionsLabour\">''Divisions of Labour'' Ray Pahl (1984)</ref> It is a plan for the relative deployment of household members' time between the three domains of [[employment]]:\n# in the ''[[market economy]]'', including home-based self-employment second jobs, in order to obtain money to buy goods and services in the market;\n# ''domestic production work'', such as cultivating a vegetable patch or raising chickens, purely to supply food to the household; and\n# ''domestic consumption work'' to provide goods and services directly within the household, such as cooking meals, child\u2013care, household repairs, or the manufacture of clothes and gifts.\nHousehold work strategies may vary over the life-cycle, as household members age, or with the economic environment; they may be imposed by one person or be decided collectively.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-householdworkstrategy.html|title=Household work strategy|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=2015-07-02}}</ref>\n\n==Household production==\n\"Household production\" is an economic category for activities including homemaking. It is defined as \"the production of the goods and services by the members of a household, for their own consumption, using their own capital and their own [[unpaid work|unpaid labor]]. Goods and services produced by households for their own use include accommodation, meals, clean clothes, and child care. The process of household production involves the transformation of purchased intermediate commodities into final consumption commodities.

[https://www.bea.gov/help/faq/1297 Why isn't household production included in GDP?], bea.gov, April 2018</ref> Goods and services created by households are generally consumed within the same country, and hence contribute in a \"Domestic Consumption\" category in [[national accounts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/business-english/domestic-consumption|title=Domestic Consumption|publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org|accessdate=2015-07-02}}</ref>\n\n==Wages for housework==\nThe [[Wages for housework|International Wages for Housework Campaign]] was a global, social movement co-founded in 1972 in [[Padua]], Italy, by author and activist [[Selma James]]. The Campaign was formed to raise awareness of how housework and [[childcare]] are the base of all industrial work and to stake the claim that these unavoidable tasks should be compensated as paid, wage labor.<ref>{{cite journal|last=James|first=Selma|title=Is Transformation Possible?

Inc|page=42|year=2008}}</ref> The demands for the Wages for Housework formally called for economic compensation for domestic work but also used these demands to more generally call attention to the affective labors of women, the reliance of capitalist economies on exploitative labor practices against women, and leisure inequality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nplusonemag.com/more-smiles-more-money|title=More Smiles? More Money|work=nplusonemag.com|accessdate=2015-07-02|date=2013-07-25}}</ref>\n\n== Effects of technology and advertising ==\n\n[[List of home appliances|Many home appliances]] have been invented that make housework faster or more effective compared to before the industrial revolution.  These include:\n* [[Washing machine]]\n* [[Clothes dryer]]\n* [[Dishwasher]]\n* [[Sewing machine]]\n* [[Vacuum cleaner]]\n* [[Small electrics]] like the [[electric mixer]], [[blender]], [[toaster]], and [[coffee maker]]\n* [[Microwave oven]]\n* [[Refrigerator]], reducing the number of grocery trips or the amount of food preservation work to do\n\n[[Utilities]] can potentially eliminate work like gathering and chopping firewood, shovelling coal, fetching water from outdoors, and heating cold tap water.\n\nHistorian [[Ruth Schwartz Cowan]] estimated that homemakers in the 1800s performed about 50\u201360 hours of work per week, and that this is the same as the 1990s.  She says that, rather than reducing the amount of time devoted to housework, labor-saving devices have been used to make the same amount of time do more work, such as by vacuuming a rug instead of sweeping it, or washing fabrics more frequently.  Modern parents also more frequently transport their children to after-school activities, and doctors no longer make house calls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines//epi1088.htm |title=No. 1088: Housework |website=Uh.edu |date=2004-08-01 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Housing}}\n* [[Handyman]]\n* [[Home economics]]\n* [[Scientific management]]\n\n==References and sources==\n;References\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n;Sources\n* Lopata, H.

Rock dismisses her as an immature child, but Jake says he is frustrated by his girlfriend Caroline's partying ways.\n\nOn the [[school bus|bus]] ride home, [[geek|geeky]] [[Ninth grade#United States|freshman]] Ted, who has a crush on Sam, repeatedly flirts with her only to have Sam reject him. \n\nAt home, Sam's day gets worse when she discovers she must sleep on the sofa because her grandparents and a [[Student exchange program|foreign exchange]] student named [[Long Duk Dong]] are all staying at the house for the wedding. Her grandparents also have forgotten her birthday and make Sam take Dong with her to a dance at school that night. \n\nAt the dance, Sam pines after Jake as he slow dances with Caroline while it doesn't take long for Dong to attract the large-breasted [[Jock (stereotype)|jock]], Marlene. Ted embarrasses Sam by dancing with her after bragging to his geek friends, Bryce and Cliff, that they are dating. When Sam runs away, the geeks bet Ted a dozen floppy disks that he can't get physical with Sam. Ted accepts, but Bryce and Cliff demand Sam's underpants as proof of his success. Jake, having seen Ted and Sam dance, asks Ted about Sam.\n\nTed finds Sam in the auto shop where she opens up to him about her family forgetting her birthday and her feelings for Jake. Ted tells her Jake asked about her and Sam excitedly asks if she should talk to Jake or wait for him to come to her. Ted, despite his feelings for Sam, encourages her to approach Jake. Before she leaves, Ted tells her about his bet and asks to borrow her [[panties]]. Later, in the boys bathroom, Bryce, Cliff, and Ted charge the other geeks one [[dollar]] to see Sam's underwear. \n\nAt Jake's house, Caroline and her friends have started a wild party.  Jake, angry with Caroline, retreats to his bedroom and tries calling Sam, but her grandparents yell at him for waking them up and tell him Sam isn't interested.  After the party ends, Jake is furious at the damage left behind. He finds Ted hiding under a glass coffee table after he angered some jocks by knocking over their beer can pyramid. Ted gives Jake Sam's underwear and tells him Sam is interested in him. Jake says he is tired of his relationship with Caroline and offers to let Ted drive a drunken Caroline home in his father's [[Rolls-Royce Corniche|Rolls Royce]].  \n\nThe next morning, Sam's mother apologizes to Sam for forgetting her birthday and everyone heads to the church for the wedding. Jake arrives at Sam's house where a hungover Dong miscommunicates that Sam is at church getting married. In the church parking lot, Jake finds Caroline and Ted making out in the back of his dad's banged-up Rolls. Jake and Caroline agree to break up, but remain friends. Jake then drives to the church just in time to meet an incredulous Sam after her sister's wedding.\n\nThat night at Jake's house, Jake gives Sam her underwear and a birthday cake with 16 candles on it.  He tells her to make a wish, but she says her wish already came true. The two kiss as the film fades to black.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Molly Ringwald]] as Samantha \"Sam\" Baker\n* [[Michael Schoeffling]] as Jake Ryan\n* [[Anthony Michael Hall]] as Ted, a.k.a. \"Farmer Ted\"\n* [[Paul Dooley]] as Jim Baker\n* [[Carlin Glynn]] as Brenda Baker\n* [[Justin Henry]] as Mike Baker\n* [[Haviland Morris]] as Caroline Mulford\n* [[Blanche Baker]] as Ginny Baker\n* [[Gedde Watanabe]] as [[Long Duk Dong]]\n* [[Edward Andrews]] as Grandpa Howard Baker\n* [[Billie Bird]] as Grandma Dorothy Baker\n* [[Carole Cook]] as Grandma Helen\n* [[Max Showalter]] as Grandpa Fred\n* [[Liane Curtis]] as Randy\n* [[John Cusack]] as Bryce\n* Darren Harris as Cliff (Wease)\n* Deborah Pollack as Marlene, a.k.a. \"Lumberjack\"\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Geek Girl\n* [[John Kapelos]] as Rudy Ryszczyk\n* [[Jami Gertz]] as Robin\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Reverend\n* [[Zelda Rubinstein]] as Organist\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] had asked his agent for headshots of young actresses, and among those he received were those of Molly Ringwald and [[Ally Sheedy]].

Plot summaries for films are usually between the required limit of 400-700 words. -->\n[[High school#United States|High school]] [[Tenth grade#United States|sophomore]] Samantha \"Sam\" Baker is hopeful her 16th birthday is the beginning of a great new year, but is shocked when her family forgets because her older, vain sister Ginny is getting married the next day. Her frustration is compounded by the fact that her crush, senior Jake Ryan, has no idea how she feels. \n\nAt school, she reveals her feelings about Jake in a \"sex quiz\" she tries to give her friend Randi which, unbeknownst to Sam, Jake intercepts.  Meanwhile, Jake asks his friend Rock about Sam, having noticed her looking at him in their independent study class. Rock dismisses her as an immature child, but Jake says he is frustrated by his girlfriend Caroline\u2019s partying ways.\n\nOn the [[school bus|bus]] ride home, [[geek|geeky]] [[Ninth grade#United States|freshman]] Ted, who has a crush on Sam, repeatedly flirts with her only to have Sam reject him. \n\nAt home, Sam's day gets worse when she discovers she must sleep on the sofa because her grandparents and a [[Student exchange program|foreign exchange]] student named [[Long Duk Dong]] are all staying at the house for the wedding. Her grandparents also have forgotten her birthday and make Sam take Dong with her to a dance at school that night. \n\nAt the dance, Sam pines after Jake as he slow dances with Caroline while it doesn't take long for Dong to attract the large-breasted [[Jock (stereotype)|jock]], Marlene. Ted embarrasses Sam by dancing with her after bragging to his geek friends, Bryce and Cliff, that they are dating. When Sam runs away, the geeks bet Ted a dozen floppy disks that he can't get physical with Sam. Ted accepts, but Bryce and Cliff demand Sam's underpants as proof of his success. Jake, having seen Ted and Sam dance, asks Ted about Sam.\n\nTed finds Sam in the auto shop where she opens up to him about her family forgetting her birthday and her feelings for Jake. Ted tells her Jake asked about her and Sam excitedly asks if she should talk to Jake or wait for him to come to her. Ted, despite his feelings for Sam, encourages her to approach Jake. Before she leaves, Ted tells her about his bet and asks to borrow her [[panties]]. Later, in the boys bathroom, Bryce, Cliff, and Ted charge the other geeks one [[dollar]] to see Sam's underwear. \n\nAt Jake\u2019s house, Caroline and her friends have started a wild party.  Jake, angry with Caroline, retreats to his bedroom and tries calling Sam, but her grandparents yell at him for waking them up and tell him Sam isn\u2019t interested.  After the party ends, Jake is furious at the damage left behind. He finds Ted hiding under a glass coffee table after he angered some jocks by knocking over their beer can pyramid. Ted gives Jake Sam's underwear and tells him Sam is interested in him. Jake says he is tired of his relationship with Caroline and offers to let Ted drive a drunken Caroline home in his father's [[Rolls-Royce Corniche|Rolls Royce]].  \n\nThe next morning, Sam's mother apologizes to Sam for forgetting her birthday and everyone heads to the church for the wedding. Jake arrives at Sam's house where a hungover Dong miscommunicates that Sam is at church getting married. In the church parking lot, Jake finds Caroline and Ted making out in the back of his dad's banged-up Rolls. Jake and Caroline agree to break up, but remain friends. Jake then drives to the church just in time to meet an incredulous Sam after her sister's wedding.\n\nThat night at Jake's house, Jake gives Sam her underwear and a birthday cake with 16 candles on it.  He tells her to make a wish, but she says her wish already came true. The two kiss as the film fades to black.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Molly Ringwald]] as Samantha \"Sam\" Baker\n* [[Michael Schoeffling]] as Jake Ryan\n* [[Anthony Michael Hall]] as Ted, a.k.a. \"Farmer Ted\"\n* [[Paul Dooley]] as Jim Baker\n* [[Carlin Glynn]] as Brenda Baker\n* [[Justin Henry]] as Mike Baker\n* [[Haviland Morris]] as Caroline Mulford\n* [[Blanche Baker]] as Ginny Baker\n* [[Gedde Watanabe]] as [[Long Duk Dong]]\n* [[Edward Andrews]] as Grandpa Howard Baker\n* [[Billie Bird]] as Grandma Dorothy Baker\n* [[Carole Cook]] as Grandma Helen\n* [[Max Showalter]] as Grandpa Fred\n* [[Liane Curtis]] as Randy\n* [[John Cusack]] as Bryce\n* Darren Harris as Cliff (Wease)\n* Deborah Pollack as Marlene, a.k.a. \"Lumberjack\"\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Geek Girl\n* [[John Kapelos]] as Rudy Ryszczyk\n* [[Jami Gertz]] as Robin\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Reverend\n* [[Zelda Rubinstein]] as Organist\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] had asked his agent for headshots of young actresses, and among those he received were those of Molly Ringwald and [[Ally Sheedy]].

This island is dangerous to touch at, owing to the rocky reefs which are level with the water and below the surface, almost along the whole length of the shore; between it and the mainland there are also numerous rocks and reefs, and slightly more to southward there is another small island.\n\nThis large island to which we have been unwilling to give a name, leaving this matter to the Honourable Lord Governor-General's pleasure, may be seen at 7 or 8 miles' distance out at sea in fine weather.

It was suggested that cats may be influencing the abundance of native fauna and if left uncontrolled, the cat population was likely to increase and could result in considerable damage to ground-nesting birds and heavy predation pressure on quokkas and reptile species.\n\nA [[feral cat]] monitoring and trapping campaign was conducted in November 2001 and 2002.

In 1996 Rottnest introduced the first public place [[recycling]] program in Western Australia. In 2000 the island won the 3R awards (reduce, reuse and recycle). A daily supply barge (the ''Spinifex'') makes a return trip from Fremantle, delivering supplies and removing rubbish.\n\nFor many years during the twentieth century, the water supply was rainwater harvested from several large bitumen sealed catchment areas behind Longreach Bay. In the 1970s freshwater was found underground and was used to supplement the rainfall supply.

Ritter plays the main character, Kim, who lives with her two roommates, Deena (Bosworth) and Laura (Bilson), in Los Angeles. Kim becomes pregnant after a one-night stand so she turns to her friends for help. ''Life Happens'' was released theatrically on April 13, 2012.\n\n==Plot==\nDeena ([[Kate Bosworth]]) and Kim ([[Krysten Ritter]]) each bring home a guy one night. Realizing they have no condoms, they go looking around in their house where Kim ultimately finds the last one, but Deena takes it and Kim has [[safe sex|unprotected sex]]. One year later, Kim is a single mother. She still lives with her two girlfriends, Deena and Laura ([[Rachel Bilson]]), while trying to juggle her son named Max. She takes Max to his father Mark (Coiro), but he announces that he is not interested in being a father. Kim brings Max along to work with her one-day, as a dog service company assistant to her youth-obsessed boss Francesca ([[Kristen Johnston]]). Francesca reprimands Kim for bringing Max with her and says that she would be fired if she does it again. Kim then takes Max to her grandfather ([[Seymour Cassel]]) who is currently living in a retirement home.\n\nMeanwhile, Deena tries to finish writing her book in a library and ends up hooking up with a guy. One night, as Kim works as a bouncer in one of Francesca's parties, she falls for a guy named Nicolas ([[Geoff Stults]]) who was with two of his friends, Henri ([[Justin Kirk]]) and Sergei ([[Jason Biggs]]), attending the party. That night, Francesca finally allows Kim to have a break and meet up with Nicolas who promised to buy her a drink earlier and they spend the night getting to know each other. They quickly form a relationship after Nicolas intently asks Francesca to have Kim take his dog in his house. Kim brings along Max with her yet again where she lies to Nicolas that Max is a child of one of her roommates and that she was just relied on to look after Max. Kim asks Deena to come with her on her date with Nicolas that evening where Deena agrees. Nicholas arrives along with his friend Henri, where they look to Deena as her roommate with the baby. Kim begs Deena to just go with the lie they have come up with where Deena responds that it wouldn't take long enough for them to know that Kim is the one with a baby. They have a double date where it seems that Deena and Henri are attracted to each other, although Henri dresses up in hippie clothing.\n\nThe next day, Deena seems promoted from her career as a writer when someone could recognize her from an article she wrote. Kim on the other hand, seems to be an underdog as Francesca wouldn't allow to invest in her own dog service business. Laura, the other roommate seems to be unstable as she has been shifting jobs every week. Kim asks her to take care of Max since she has a date with Nicholas that night, but tells her she can't. She then freaks out and calls Deena who isn't answering her calls. Finally, she asks a young boy to babysit Max for her. Nicolas and Kim have sex after their romantic date, but it is not long before Nicolas discovers Kim's secret when milk leaks out of her breasts. This leaves Nicholas upset and Kim leaves.\n\nOn her way home, she sees a paramedic leave and asks Deena what happened. Kim yells at Deena for not returning home early where Deena strikes back at her saying that Max is her responsibility and there is nothing that could excuse her behavior. Deena and Kim's friendship is compromised. Kim spends all day around the house and finally quits her job telling Francesca she never looked 21. The next day, Kim informs Deena that she has to move out of the house and focus her life on being a mother and as for Deena, her successful career. Kim buys a house and visits Mark who regrets everything he said about not being ready and he wants a shot of being a dad for once. Laura then enters a show competition and seems to be successful. Kim finally reconciles with Deena and Nicolas where they all play pool together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Krysten Ritter]] as Kim\n* [[Kate Bosworth]] as Deena\n* [[Rachel Bilson]] as Laura\n* [[Geoff Stults]] as Nicholas\n* [[Justin Kirk]] as Henri\n* [[Fallon Goodson]] as Jayde\n* [[Andrea Savage]] as Patti\n* [[Kristen Johnston]] as Francesca\n* [[Rhys Coiro]] as Marc\n* [[Jason Biggs]] as Sergei\n* [[Seymour Cassel]] as Pop Pop\n* [[Louis Silvers (actor)|Louis Silvers]] as Barry Robert Philips\n* [[Colin Egglesfield]] as Ivan #1\n* [[Ivan Shaw]] as Ivan #2\n* [[Jenny Mollen]] as Rita the Receptionist\n* [[Abby Brammell]] as Shiva the Yoga Teacher\n* [[Marguerite Moreau]] as Pauline\n* [[Lauren Conrad]] as Herself\n* [[Katie Morgan]] as Dr. Katie\n* [[Nic Novicki]] as Nurse Nic\n* [[Merrin Dungey]] as Hester\n* [[Laura Silverman]] as Ms. Crenshaw\n* [[Devan Leos]] as Billy\n* [[Milana Vayntrub]] as Tanya\n* [[Jon Heder]] as Wrong Number Caller\n* [[Brandon Quinn]] as Hot Jogger #2\n* [[Zachary & Connor Ross]] as Baby Max\n* [[Johann Urb]] as Jason\n\n==Development==\nIn an interview, Ritter described how she and Coiro came up with the movie's plot. \"Kat and I have been longtime friends.

The film stars Ritter, [[Kate Bosworth]], [[Kristen Johnston]], [[Geoff Stults]], [[Jason Biggs]], and [[Rachel Bilson]]. Ritter plays the main character, Kim, who lives with her two roommates, Deena (Bosworth) and Laura (Bilson), in Los Angeles. Kim becomes pregnant after a one-night stand so she turns to her friends for help. ''Life Happens'' was released theatrically on April 13, 2012.\n\n==Plot==\nDeena ([[Kate Bosworth]]) and Kim ([[Krysten Ritter]]) each bring home a guy one night. Realizing they have no condoms, they go looking around in their house where Kim ultimately finds the last one, but Deena takes it and Kim has [[safe sex|unprotected sex]]. One year later, Kim is a single mother. She still lives with her two girlfriends, Deena and Laura ([[Rachel Bilson]]), while trying to juggle her son named Max. She takes Max to his father Mark (Coiro), but he announces that he is not interested in being a father. Kim brings Max along to work with her one day, as a dog service company assistant to her youth-obsessed boss Francesca ([[Kristen Johnston]]). Francesca reprimands Kim for bringing Max with her and says that she would be fired if she does it again.

It is located in the valley of the [[Woluwe]] stream, to the east of the Woluwe Shopping Center. It is the municipality's oldest and biggest park.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Chateau Malou.jpg|right|thumb|A view of the park and the ch\u00e2teau from 1831]]\nThe park was established on the marshy, boggy field surrounding the banks of the Struybeek stream, a tributary of the [[Woluwe]]. In 1774 the park featured 7 fish ponds, a small hunting lodge called ''t'Speelgoet'' and a small reservoir. The gardens of the Speelgoet castle were laid out in the early 17th century by the hunting lodge's first known owners, a local family called Preud'homme.<ref>[http://www.woluwe1200.be/francais/base.asp Communal website of Woluwe St Lambert - Promenades in Woluwe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506124219/http://www.woluwe1200.be/francais/base.asp |date=2007-05-06 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1776, the local merchant and banker Lambert de Lamberts built his residence in the park, which was to be later renamed after [[Jules Malou]], the most famous of its residents. The ch\u00e2teau's successive owners transformed the formal gardens to the park's present form \u2013 a landscape largely covered by trees.\n\nThe municipality acquired the park in 1951. The remains of the previously large bogs or marshy areas can still be seen behind the [[Moulin Lindekemale|Lindekemale watermill]].\n\n==Situation==\nMalou Park lies to the east of {{lang|fr|Boulevard de la Woluwe|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Woluwelaan|italic=no}}, bordered from the north by {{lang|fr|Avenue Debecker|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Debeckerlaan|italic=no}}, from the south by {{lang|fr|Chauss\u00e9e Stockel|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Stokkelsesteenweg|italic=no}} and from the east by {{lang|fr|Chemin du Struybeken|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Struybekenweg|italic=no}}.\n\nThe park overlooks the valley of the [[Woluwe River|Woluwe]], which is a tributary of the large lake on the western side of the park.

It is located in the valley of the [[Woluwe]] stream, to the east of the Woluwe Shopping Center. It is the municipality's oldest and biggest park.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Chateau Malou.jpg|right|thumb|A view of the park and the ch\u00e2teau from 1831]]\nThe park was established on the marshy, boggy field surrounding the banks of the Struybeek stream, a tributary of the [[Woluwe]]. In 1774 the park featured 7 fish ponds, a small hunting lodge called ''t'Speelgoet'' and a small reservoir. The gardens of the Speelgoet castle were laid out in the early 17th century by the hunting lodge's first known owners, a local family called Preud'homme.<ref>[http://www.woluwe1200.be/francais/base.asp Communal website of Woluwe St Lambert - Promenades in Woluwe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506124219/http://www.woluwe1200.be/francais/base.asp |date=2007-05-06 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1776, the local merchant and banker Lambert de Lamberts built his residence in the park, which was to be later renamed after [[Jules Malou]], the most famous of its residents. The ch\u00e2teau's successive owners transformed the formal gardens to the park's present form \u2013 a landscape largely covered by trees.\n\nThe municipality acquired the park in 1951. The remains of the previously large bogs or marshy areas can still be seen behind the [[Moulin Lindekemale|Lindekemale watermill]].\n\n==Situation==\nMalou Park lies to the east of {{lang|fr|Boulevard de la Woluwe|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Woluwelaan|italic=no}}, bordered from the north by {{lang|fr|Avenue Debecker|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Debeckerlaan|italic=no}}, from the south by {{lang|fr|Chauss\u00e9e Stockel|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Stokkelsesteenweg|italic=no}} and from the east by {{lang|fr|Chemin du Struybeken|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Struybekenweg|italic=no}}.\n\nThe park overlooks the valley of the [[Woluwe River|Woluwe]], which is a tributary of the large lake on the western side of the park.

She gives herself the name \"Lady Bird\" and longs to attend a prestigious college in \"a city with culture\" somewhere on the east coast, despite her family's financial struggles. Her mother Marion often tells her that she is ungrateful for what she has. Lady Bird and her best friend Julie join their school theater program, where Lady Bird develops a crush on classmate Danny O'Neill. This grows into a romantic relationship, and Lady Bird disappoints Marion by spending her last Thanksgiving before graduation with Danny's wealthy family instead of her own. After the opening night of \"[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]],\" their relationship ends when Lady Bird and Julie discover her boyfriend kissing another boy in a bathroom stall.\n\nAt the behest of Marion, Lady Bird takes a job at a coffee shop; there, she meets Kyle, and they begin dating. Lady Bird abandons Julie and ditches tryouts for the new play to bond with Jenna Walton, a popular girl, and they vandalize a nun's car. As Lady Bird grows closer to Kyle and Jenna, she gradually deserts Julie, and she drops out of the theater program. She confronts Danny, but consoles him after he begins sobbing and expresses his struggle in [[coming out]], and they become friends again.\n\nAt a house party, while kissing, Kyle implies to Lady Bird that he has never had sex; he denies having said this when she later loses her virginity to him, which upsets her, and she cries in her mom's arms afterwards. When Lady Bird is suspended from school for speaking up at a pro-life assembly, Jenna tries to visit her at home, but discovers Lady Bird had claimed Danny's grandmother's house as hers. Lady Bird admits to the lie, and Jenna agrees to forgive her because of their mutual friendship with Kyle.\n\nLady Bird learns that her father Larry has lost his job and has been battling depression for years. She applies to East Coast colleges, despite Marion's insistence that the family cannot afford the fees, with the help of her father, who fills out her financial aid applications without Marion knowing. Lady Bird is accepted into [[UC Davis]], but is upset because she feels it is too close to home. Learning she is on the wait list for a New York college, she does not share the news with her mother, fearing her response. Lady Bird sets out for her prom with Kyle, Jenna, and Jenna's boyfriend Jonah, but the other three decide to go to a house party instead. Lady Bird originally agrees, then changes her mind and speaks up, saying she actually does want to go to prom. Lady Bird asks them to drop her off at Julie's apartment, where the two rekindle their friendship and go to the prom together.\n\nAfter graduation, Danny accidentally reveals Lady Bird's place on the wait list to Marion, who stops speaking to her daughter for the rest of the summer. On her eighteenth birthday, Lady Bird's father shares a cupcake with her, and she buys a pack of cigarettes, a [[Scratchcard|scratch-off ticket]], and an issue of ''[[Playgirl]]'' to celebrate reaching legal adulthood. Lady Bird learns she has been accepted into the New York college, and can afford tuition with financial aid with her father's help. Her parents take her to the airport, but Marion refuses to go inside to say goodbye. She has a change of heart and drives back, only to discover Lady Bird has already gone through security. She cries in her husband's arms, who consoles her that Lady Bird will come back.\n\nArriving in New York, Lady Bird finds several letters in her luggage; her mother had written and discarded them, but her father salvaged them. She begins using her birth name again, and is hospitalized after drinking heavily at a party. Leaving the hospital, she visits a [[Presbyterian]] church service and is moved to tears. She calls home and leaves an apologetic voicemail for her mother, thanking her for everything she has done for her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Saoirse Ronan]] as Christine \"Lady Bird\"{{efn|name=nickname|group=notes|The nickname does not derive from former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Lady Bird Johnson]], but the [[Mother Goose]] nursery rhyme [[Ladybird Ladybird]].<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=564579012|title=Greta Gerwig Explores Mother-Daughter Love (And Angst) In 'Lady Bird'|accessdate=November 26, 2017|date=November 16, 2017|author=Terry Gross}}</ref>}} McPherson\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as Marion McPherson\n* [[Tracy Letts]] as Larry McPherson\n* [[Lucas Hedges]] as Danny O'Neill\n* [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]] as Kyle Scheible\n* [[Beanie Feldstein]] as Julianne \"Julie\" Steffans\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Sister Sarah Joan\n* [[Stephen Henderson (actor)|Stephen McKinley Henderson]] as Father Leviatch\n* [[Odeya Rush]] as Jenna Walton\n* [[Jordan Rodrigues]] as Miguel McPherson\n* Marielle Scott as Shelly Yuhan\n* [[Andy Buckley]] as Uncle Matthew\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nGerwig spent years writing the screenplay.

She gives herself the name \"Lady Bird\" and longs to attend a prestigious college in \"a city with culture\" somewhere on the east coast, despite her family's financial struggles. Her mother Marion often tells her that she is ungrateful for what she has. Lady Bird and her best friend Julie join their school theater program, where Lady Bird develops a crush on classmate Danny O'Neill. This grows into a romantic relationship, and Lady Bird disappoints Marion by spending her last Thanksgiving before graduation with Danny's wealthy family instead of her own. After the opening night of \"[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]],\" their relationship ends when Lady Bird and Julie discover her boyfriend kissing another boy in a bathroom stall.\n\nAt the behest of Marion, Lady Bird takes a job at a coffee shop; there, she meets Kyle, and they begin dating. Lady Bird abandons Julie and ditches tryouts for the new play to bond with Jenna Walton, a popular girl, and they vandalize a nun's car. As Lady Bird grows closer to Kyle and Jenna, she gradually deserts Julie, and she drops out of the theater program. She confronts Danny, but consoles him after he begins sobbing and expresses his struggle in [[coming out]], and they become friends again.\n\nAt a house party, while kissing, Kyle implies to Lady Bird that he has never had sex; he denies having said this when she later loses her virginity to him, which upsets her, and she cries in her mom's arms afterwards. When Lady Bird is suspended from school for speaking up at a pro-life assembly, Jenna tries to visit her at home, but discovers Lady Bird had claimed Danny's grandmother's house as hers. Lady Bird admits to the lie, and Jenna agrees to forgive her because of their mutual friendship with Kyle.\n\nLady Bird learns that her father Larry has lost his job and has been battling depression for years. She applies to East Coast colleges, despite Marion's insistence that the family cannot afford the fees, with the help of her father, who fills out her financial aid applications without Marion knowing. Lady Bird is accepted into [[UC Davis]], but is upset because she feels it is too close to home. Learning she is on the wait list for a New York college, she does not share the news with her mother, fearing her response. Lady Bird sets out for her prom with Kyle, Jenna, and Jenna\u2019s boyfriend Jonah, but the other three decide to go to a house party instead. Lady Bird originally agrees, then changes her mind and speaks up, saying she actually does want to go to prom. Lady Bird asks them to drop her off at Julie's apartment, where the two rekindle their friendship and go to the prom together.\n\nAfter graduation, Danny accidentally reveals Lady Bird\u2019s place on the wait list to Marion, who stops speaking to her daughter for the rest of the summer. On her eighteenth birthday, Lady Bird's father shares a cupcake with her, and she buys a pack of cigarettes, a [[Scratchcard|scratch-off ticket]], and an issue of ''[[Playgirl]]'' to celebrate reaching legal adulthood. Lady Bird learns she has been accepted into the New York college, and can afford tuition with financial aid with her father's help. Her parents take her to the airport, but Marion refuses to go inside to say goodbye. She has a change of heart and drives back, only to discover Lady Bird has already gone through security. She cries in her husband's arms, who consoles her that Lady Bird will come back.\n\nArriving in New York, Lady Bird finds several letters in her luggage; her mother had written and discarded them, but her father salvaged them. She begins using her birth name again, and is hospitalized after drinking heavily at a party. Leaving the hospital, she visits a [[Presbyterian]] church service and is moved to tears. She calls home and leaves an apologetic voicemail for her mother, thanking her for everything she has done for her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Saoirse Ronan]] as Christine \"Lady Bird\"{{efn|name=nickname|group=notes|The nickname does not derive from former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Lady Bird Johnson]], but the [[Mother Goose]] nursery rhyme [[Ladybird Ladybird]].<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=564579012|title=Greta Gerwig Explores Mother-Daughter Love (And Angst) In 'Lady Bird'|accessdate=November 26, 2017|date=November 16, 2017|author=Terry Gross}}</ref>}} McPherson\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as Marion McPherson\n* [[Tracy Letts]] as Larry McPherson\n* [[Lucas Hedges]] as Danny O'Neill\n* [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]] as Kyle Scheible\n* [[Beanie Feldstein]] as Julianne \"Julie\" Steffans\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Sister Sarah Joan\n* [[Stephen Henderson (actor)|Stephen McKinley Henderson]] as Father Leviatch\n* [[Odeya Rush]] as Jenna Walton\n* [[Jordan Rodrigues]] as Miguel McPherson\n* Marielle Scott as Shelly Yuhan\n* [[Andy Buckley]] as Uncle Matthew\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nGerwig spent years writing the screenplay.

His wife, Julia, is driving them when they are struck by another vehicle, killing Julia. Recovering in the hospital, he attempts to purchase some candy from a [[vending machine]] which malfunctions. Davis drafts a complaint to the vending machine manufacturer that includes some venting of his personal experiences. This leads to a series of anonymous conversations with a customer service representative, Karen Moreno, in which they end up sharing details of each other's life burdens.  Karen appears to be the only one he talks to, though tells his stories in an understated and unemotional style.  He brings this same unemotional process to work, which he has returned to much earlier than anyone expected.  Davis does tell one other person, a fellow commuter train rider that he realizes that he didn't love Julia because he doesn't feel \"...sad, or pain, or hurt...\".\n\nDavis's changing emotional state causes him to behave erratically. He notices that he is being followed by a green [[station wagon]]. The only thing Davis seems to connect with is trying to understand what's inside things, using a small toolkit to dismantle his household appliances, his work computer, a bathroom stall&mdash;eventually telling Phil that he has an urge to dismantle a 120-year-old grandmother clock in Phil's office.\n\nKaren follows Davis, talking with him on his commuter train without revealing her identity. She mistakenly leaves some identification, and Davis is sufficiently moved to track her down at home, where she lives with her boyfriend and boss, Carl, and her 15-year old troublemaker son, Chris.  When Carl goes on a long business trip, Davis bunks at her house, where they develop a deep [[Platonic love|platonic]] friendship. Chris initially dislikes Davis, but later grows not only to like him but to help Davis cope, while Davis becomes his mentor in return.\n\nDavis joins his in-laws in funding a foundation in Julia's name that will award an annual scholarship; during interviews, Davis behaves disrespectfully towards one of the award candidates, and Phil asks him to sign a transfer of his beneficiary rights in Julia's $2.6 million life insurance policy, to the scholarship fund in her name. Davis purchases demolition tools from a hardware store (and, later, a bulldozer) and, with Chris's assistance, destroys his house. When Davis finds an ultrasound of Julia's from the previous year, he is devastated that she failed to inform him.\n\nA climactic night impacts everyone. Davis brings Karen to the party for the scholarship winner, greatly troubling Julia's parents. A young man makes an inappropriate advance on Karen, and she later laughs out loud when he is introduced as the scholarship winner. Davis announces to everyone that Julia had been pregnant and kept it secret. Julia's mother tells him his wife was seeing someone else, and the child was not his and she took her to get an abortion. Returning to Karen's house, Davis finds Carl has returned and is reading the letters Davis wrote to Karen. Carl beats on Davis, which pales compared to the homophobic swarm beating that Chris receives after coming out as gay.\n\nDavis visits his wife's grave and the green [[station wagon]] arrives and a man carrying flowers gets out of the car. He is Michael, the driver of the car that killed Julia. Davis forgives Michael and he experiences flashbacks of his wife and him together and he finally cries, bringing closure. He realizes he loved his wife.\n\nDavis has turned a corner.  He reconciles with Julia's parents, asking Phil to contribute to refurbishing a [[carousel]] &ndash; destined for demolition &ndash; as a memorial for Julia.\n\nDavis receives a letter from Chris saying that he is recovering from his beating, his mother has left Carl, and Davis must be at [[Chelsea Piers#Pier 54|Pier 54]] at a particular time, which results in Davis witnessing the demolition of some waterfront buildings across the [[North River (Hudson River)|Hudson River]].

Davis does tell one other person, a fellow commuter train rider that he realizes that he didn't love Julia because he doesn't feel \"...sad, or pain, or hurt...\".\n\nDavis's changing emotional state causes him to behave erratically. He notices that he is being followed by a green [[station wagon]]. The only thing Davis seems to connect with is trying to understand what's inside things, using a small toolkit to dismantle his household appliances, his work computer, a bathroom stall&mdash;eventually telling Phil that he has an urge to dismantle a 120-year-old grandmother clock in Phil's office.\n\nKaren follows Davis, talking with him on his commuter train without revealing her identity. She mistakenly leaves some identification, and Davis is sufficiently moved to track her down at home, where she lives with her boyfriend and boss, Carl, and her 15-year old troublemaker son, Chris.  When Carl goes on a long business trip, Davis bunks at her house, where they develop a deep [[Platonic love|platonic]] friendship. Chris initially dislikes Davis, but later grows not only to like him but to help Davis cope, while Davis becomes his mentor in return.\n\nDavis joins his in-laws in funding a foundation in Julia's name that will award an annual scholarship; during interviews, Davis behaves disrespectfully towards one of the award candidates, and Phil asks him to sign a transfer of his beneficiary rights in Julia's $2.6 million life insurance policy, to the scholarship fund in her name. Davis purchases demolition tools from a hardware store (and, later, a bulldozer) and, with Chris's assistance, destroys his house. When Davis finds an ultrasound of Julia's from the previous year, he is devastated that she failed to inform him.\n\nA climactic night impacts everyone. Davis brings Karen to the party for the scholarship winner, greatly troubling Julia's parents. A young man makes an inappropriate advance on Karen, and she later laughs out loud when he is introduced as the scholarship winner. Davis announces to everyone that Julia had been pregnant and kept it secret. Julia's mother tells him his wife was seeing someone else, and the child was not his and she took her to get an abortion. Returning to Karen's house, Davis finds Carl has returned and is reading the letters Davis wrote to Karen. Carl beats on Davis, which pales compared to the homophobic swarm beating that Chris receives after coming out as gay.\n\nDavis visits his wife's grave and the green [[station wagon]] arrives and a man carrying flowers gets out of the car. He is Michael, the driver of the car that killed Julia. Davis forgives Michael and he experiences flashbacks of his wife and him together and he finally cries, bringing closure. He realizes he loved his wife.\n\nDavis has turned a corner.  He reconciles with Julia's parents, asking Phil to contribute to refurbishing a [[carousel]] &ndash; destined for demolition &ndash; as a memorial for Julia.\n\nDavis receives a letter from Chris saying that he is recovering from his beating, his mother has left Carl, and Davis must be at [[Chelsea Piers#Pier 54|Pier 54]] at a particular time, which results in Davis witnessing the demolition of some waterfront buildings across the [[North River (Hudson River)|Hudson River]]. Chris watches Davis through binoculars from a nearby vantage point.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as Davis Mitchell, an [[investment banker]]\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Karen Moreno, a customer service representative and the interest of a grieving Davis\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as Phil Eastwood,<ref name=\"Cooper\" /> Davis\u2019s father in-law\n* [[Judah Lewis]] as Chris Moreno,<ref name=\"July2015Deadline\" /> Karen\u2019s son\n* [[C.J.
