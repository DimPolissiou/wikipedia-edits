He moved in a part-exchange deal valued at \u00a3650,000 which saw [[David Oldfield (footballer)|David Oldfield]] join Leicester.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F925A35F1761388&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 |title=Kendall admits that City's search for talent is incomplete |work=The Times |format=reprint |publisher=[[NewsBank]] |last1=Ross |first1=Ian |last2=Taylor |first2=Louise |date=9 January 1990 |accessdate=27 January 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Manchester City===\nClarke was unable to claim a regular place in the Manchester City side. While at [[Maine Road]] he was loaned to [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]], where he scored six goals in seven games, then to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] (three goals in nine matches), and then back to Wolves, where he was viewed as a potential partner for [[Steve Bull]]. However his first appearance for the club lasted just 20 minutes before he punctured a lung, returned to Manchester City, and on his return to fitness was not allowed out on loan again.<ref name=Indy19951202/>\n\n===Walsall===\nClarke's next move came in the summer of 1992 when he joined [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] in [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]]. He was the fourth of the brothers to play for Walsall, and the move meant he had played in all four divisions of the Football League. He was the club's top scorer in the [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393 season]] with 21 goals in 39 games, helping them to a [[Football League Two play-offs|playoff position]], but they were heavily defeated in the playoff semi-final by [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] and Clarke was sold to local rivals [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]], managed by former Wolves goalkeeper [[Fred Davies]].<ref name=Walsall>{{cite web |url=http://www.saddlers.premiumtv.co.uk/page/SaddlersAZ/0,,10428~910684,00.html |title=Ultimate Saddlers A-Z 4 |publisher=Walsall F.C |last=Edwards |first=Leigh |accessdate=26 January 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Shrewsbury Town===\nClarke spent two seasons at [[Gay Meadow]] having previously had a successful loan period at the club several years earlier. Clarke joined Shrewsbury from Walsall on the eve of The [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394 season]]. Clarke had a successful season finishing second top scorer with 18 goals, helping to bring the Division Three title and promotion to Division Two. Clarke was the youngest brother of [[Frank Clarke (footballer)|Frank Clarke]] whom had also played for [[Shrewsbury Town]] as a striker. The club released him at the end of the [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395 season]], he had scored 22 goals in 59 games.\n\n==Managerial career==\nClarke was appointed [[player-manager]]

He was the club's top scorer in the [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393 season]] with 21 goals in 39 games, helping them to a [[Football League Two play-offs|playoff position]], but they were heavily defeated in the playoff semi-final by [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] and Clarke was sold to local rivals [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]], managed by former Wolves goalkeeper [[Fred Davies]].<ref name=Walsall>{{cite web |url=http://www.saddlers.premiumtv.co.uk/page/SaddlersAZ/0,,10428~910684,00.html |title=Ultimate Saddlers A-Z 4 |publisher=Walsall F.C |last=Edwards |first=Leigh |accessdate=26 January 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Shrewsbury Town===\nClarke spent two seasons at [[Gay Meadow]] having previously had a successful loan period at the club several years earlier. Clarke joined Shrewsbury from Walsall on the eve of The [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394 season]]. Clarke had a successful season finishing second top scorer with 18 goals, helping to bring the Division Three title and promotion to Division Two. Clarke was the youngest brother of [[Frank Clarke (footballer)|Frank Clarke]] whom had also played for [[Shrewsbury Town]] as a striker. The club released him at the end of the [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395 season]], he had scored 22 goals in 59 games.\n\n==Managerial career==\nClarke was appointed [[player-manager]]

The core of placental villi contain mesenchymal cells and placental blood vessels that are directly connected to the fetus\u2019 circulation via the umbilical cord. This core is surrounded by two layers of trophoblasts, the [[cytotrophoblast]] and the [[syncytiotrophoblast]]. The cytotrophoblast is a layer of mono-nucleated cells that resides underneath the syncytiotrophoblast.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.embryology.ch/anglais/fplacenta/fecond03.html|title=The trophoblast|website=www.embryology.ch|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> The syncytiotrophoblast is composed of fused cytotrophoblasts which forms a layer that covers the placental surface.<ref name=\":0\" /> The syncytiotrophoblast is in direct contact with the maternal blood that reaches the placental surface. It then facilitates the exchange of nutrients, wastes and gases between the maternal and fetal systems.\n\nIn addition, cytotrophoblasts in the tips of villi can differentiate into another type of trophoblast called the extravillous trophoblast. Extravillous trophoblasts grow out from the placenta and penetrate into the decidualized uterus. This process is essential not only for physically attaching the placenta to the mother, but also for altering the vasculature in the uterus. This alteration allows an adequate blood supply to the growing fetus as pregnancy progresses. Some of these trophoblasts even replace the [[endothelial cells]] in the uterine spiral [[Artery|arteries]] as they remodel these vessels into wide bore conduits that are independent of maternal [[vasoconstriction]]. This ensures that the fetus receives a steady supply of blood, and the placenta is not subjected to fluctuations in oxygen that could cause it damage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lunghi|first=Laura|last2=Ferretti|first2=Maria E.|last3=Medici|first3=Silvia|last4=Biondi|first4=Carla|last5=Vesce|first5=Fortunato|date=2007-02-08|title=Control of human trophoblast function|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-7827-5-6|journal=Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology|volume=5|issue=1|pages=6|doi=10.1186/1477-7827-5-6|issn=1477-7827|pmc=1800852|pmid=17288592}}</ref>\n\n==Clinical significance==\nThe invasion of a specific type of trophoblast (extravillous trophoblast) into the maternal [[uterus]] is a vital stage in the establishment of [[pregnancy]].

This core is surrounded by two layers of trophoblasts, the [[cytotrophoblast]] and the [[syncytiotrophoblast]]. The cytotrophoblast is a layer of mono-nucleated cells that resides underneath the syncytiotrophoblast.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.embryology.ch/anglais/fplacenta/fecond03.html|title=The trophoblast|website=www.embryology.ch|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> The syncytiotrophoblast is composed of fused cytotrophoblasts which forms a layer that covers the placental surface.<ref name=\":0\" /> The syncytiotrophoblast is in direct contact with the maternal blood that reaches the placental surface. It then facilitates the exchange of nutrients, wastes and gases between the maternal and fetal systems. \n\nIn addition, cytotrophoblasts in the tips of villi can differentiate into another type of trophoblast called the extravillous trophoblast. Extravillous trophoblasts grow out from the placenta and penetrate into the decidualized uterus. This process is essential not only for physically attaching the placenta to the mother, but also for altering the vasculature in the uterus. This alteration allows an adequate blood supply to the growing fetus as pregnancy progresses. Some of these trophoblasts even replace the [[endothelial cells]] in the uterine spiral [[Artery|arteries]] as they remodel these vessels into wide bore conduits that are independent of maternal [[vasoconstriction]]. This ensures that the fetus receives a steady supply of blood, and the placenta is not subjected to fluctuations in oxygen that could cause it damage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lunghi|first=Laura|last2=Ferretti|first2=Maria E.|last3=Medici|first3=Silvia|last4=Biondi|first4=Carla|last5=Vesce|first5=Fortunato|date=2007-02-08|title=Control of human trophoblast function|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-7827-5-6|journal=Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology|volume=5|issue=1|pages=6|doi=10.1186/1477-7827-5-6|issn=1477-7827|pmc=PMC1800852|pmid=17288592}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n==Clinical significance==\nThe invasion of a specific type of trophoblast (extravillous trophoblast) into the maternal [[uterus]] is a vital stage in the establishment of [[pregnancy]].

The main components of the motor are the [[stator]] and [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]].<ref name=\"How Its Made Dream Cars Season 02 Episode 10 Tesla Model S\"/>\n\nThe motor construction begins when a robot unspools and winds over {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} of copper wire per motor. It then pulls the copper wire into a stack. The motor has three phases and so requires three coils of copper.<ref name=\"How Its Made Dream Cars Season 02 Episode 10 Tesla Model S\"/> A worker then lengthens and straightens each bundle of wire and inserts the hydraulic lift to transfer the motor to the next station.\n\nA worker insulates each bundle of copper wire in a plastic sleeve to prevent the bundles from touching one another.  The ends of the bundles are then snipped to the correct length. Lugs are added and crimped to form attachment points for the motor's three phases.<ref name=\"How Its Made Dream Cars Season 02 Episode 10 Tesla Model S\"/> A specialized automatic sewing machine then binds the coils together to keep them in place, the increased tightness of the binding provided by a robotic sewing machine increases the efficiency of the motor. The stator is then encased in a two part epoxy resin to help in evenly distributing the motor's heat. The stator is now complete and is inserted into a heated metal case, locking the stator inside as the case cools.<ref name=\"How Its Made Dream Cars Season 02 Episode 10 Tesla Model S\"/>\n\nA worker uses a hoisting system to insert the rotor inside the stator completing the construction of the motor.\n\n=====Additional drive unit components=====\nA worker then installs the differential and other sections of the gearbox, attaching it together using bolts.  An air leak test is then conducted. The three phase tripole [[power inverter]] is then installed onto the top of the motor to convert [[direct current]] from the battery into alternating current for the motor to use.

The main components of the motor are the [[stator]] and [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]].<ref name=\"How Its Made Dream Cars Season 02 Episode 10 Tesla Model S\"/>\n\nThe motor construction begins when a robot unspools and winds over {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} of copper wire per motor. It then pulls the copper wire into a stack. The motor has three phases and so requires three coils of copper.<ref name=\"How Its Made Dream Cars Season 02 Episode 10 Tesla Model S\"/> A worker then lengthens and straightens each bundle of wire and inserts the hydraulic lift to transfer the motor to the next station.\n\nA worker insulates each bundle of copper wire in a plastic sleeve to prevent the bundles from touching one another.  The ends of the bundles are then snipped to the correct length. Lugs are added and crimped to form attachment points for the motor's three phases.<ref name=\"How Its Made Dream Cars Season 02 Episode 10 Tesla Model S\"/> A specialized automatic sewing machine then binds the coils together to keep them in place, the increased tightness of the binding provided by a robotic sewing machine increases the efficiency of the motor. The stator is then encased in a two part epoxy resin to help in evenly distributing the motor's heat. The stator is now complete and is inserted into a heated metal case, locking the stator inside as the case cools.<ref name=\"How Its Made Dream Cars Season 02 Episode 10 Tesla Model S\"/>\n\nA worker uses a hoisting system to insert the rotor inside the stator completing the construction of the motor.\n\n=====Additional drive unit components=====\nA worker then installs the differential and other sections of the gearbox, attaching it together using bolts.  An air leak test is then conducted. The three phase tripole [[power inverter]] is then installed onto the top of the motor to convert [[direct current]] from the battery into alternating current for the motor to use. The motor then undergoes a series of automated tests taking 4 minutes to ensure correct function, and then is moved to the general assembly area to be installed into the car.<ref name=\"How Its Made Dream Cars Season 02 Episode 10 Tesla Model S\"/>\n\nThe power inverter is constructed from [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor]] (MOS) [[power transistor]]s. Early Tesla vehicles used MOS-controlled [[insulated-gate bipolar transistor]]s (IGBTs), which have been replaced by [[silicon carbide]] (SiC) [[power MOSFET]]s ([[MOSFET|MOS field-effect transistors]]) in later Tesla vehicles since 2018.<ref name=\"pntpower\">{{cite news |last1=Avron |first1=Alex |title=Is Tesla's production creating a SiC MOSFET shortage? |url=https://www.pntpower.com/is-teslas-production-creating-a-sic-mosfet-shortage/ |accessdate=21 December 2019 |work=PntPower |date=11 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Battery pack construction===\n[[File:Liion-18650-AA-battery.jpg|The Model S 85KWh battery pack uses 7,104 '[[18650]]' [[lithium-ion battery]] cells (right).

This mix of normal and transformed chloroplasts are defined to be \"[[Heteroplasmy|heteroplasmic]]\" chloroplast population.<ref name=\":132\" /> Stable gene expression of the introduced gene requires a \"[[Homoplasmy|homoplasmic]]\" population of transformed chloroplasts in the plant cells, where all the chloroplasts in the plant cell has successfully integrated the foreign genetic material.<ref name=\":132\" /> Typically, homoplasmicity can be achieved and identified through multiple rounds of selection on antibiotics.<ref name=\":132\" /> This is where the transformed plant tissue are grown repeatedly on agar plates that contain antibiotics like spectinomycin.<ref name=\":132\" /> Only plant cells that have successfully integrated the gene cassette as shown above will be able to express the antibiotic resistance selectable marker and therefore grow normally on agar plates containing antibiotics.<ref name=\":132\" /> Plant [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] that do not grow normally will have a bleached appearance as the spectinomycin antibiotic [[Inhibitor|inhibits]] the [[ribosome]] of the plant cell<ref name=\":132\" /> However, as heteroplasmic population of chloroplasts may still be able to grow on agar plates effectively, many rounds of antibiotic selection and regrowth are required to cultivate a plant tissue that is homoplasmic and stable.<ref name=\":132\" /> Generation of homoplasmic plant tissue is considered to be a major difficulty and incredibly time consuming.<ref name=\":0222\" />\n\n== Biological containment and agricultural coexistence ==\n[[File:Nicotiana Tobacco Plants 1909px.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nicotiana%20Tobacco%20Plants%201909px.jpg|thumb|Nicotiana Tobacco Plant]]\nGenetically modified plants must be safe for the environment and suitable for [[Co-existence of genetically modified and conventional crops and derived food and feed|coexistence with conventional and organic crops]]. A major hurdle for traditional nuclear genetically modified crops is posed by the potential [[outcrossing]] of the [[transgene]] via pollen movement. Initially it was thought that, plastid transformation, which yields transplastomic plants in which the pollen does not contain the transgene, not only increases biosafety, but also facilitates the coexistence of genetically modified, conventional and organic agriculture. Therefore, developing such crops was a major goal of research projects such as [[Co-Extra]] and Transcontainer.\n\nHowever, a study conducted on the [[Nicotiana|tabacco plant]] in 2007 has disproved this theory. Led by Ralph Bock from the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in Germany, researchers studied genetically modified tobacco in which the transgene was integrated in chloroplasts.<ref name=\":03222\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Ruf S, Karcher D, Bock R|date=April 2007|title=Determining the transgene containment level provided by chloroplast transformation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=104|issue=17|pages=6998\u20137002|doi=10.1073/pnas.0700008104|pmc=1849964|pmid=17420459}}</ref>  A transplatomic tabacco plant generated through chloroplast mediated transformation was bred with plants that were male sterile with an untouched chloroplast.<ref name=\":03222\" /> The transplastomic plants were engineered to have [[Antimicrobial resistance|resistance]] to the antibiotic [[spectinomycin]] and engineered to produce a [[Green fluorescent protein|fluorescent molecule]] (GFP).<ref name=\":03222\" /> Therefore, it was hypothesized that any offspring produced by from these two lines of tabacco plant should not be able to grow on spectinomycin or be fluorescent, as the genetic material in the chloroplast should not be able to transfer via pollen.<ref name=\":03222\" /> However, it was found that some of the seeds were resistant to the antibiotic and could germinate on spectinomycin agar plates.<ref name=\":03222\" /> Calculations showed that 1 out of every million [[pollen]] grains contained plastid genetic material, which would be hugely significant in an agricultural farm setting.<ref name=\":03222\" /> Because tobacco has a strong tendency towards self-fertilisation, the reliability of transplastomic plants is assumed to be even higher under field conditions. Therefore, the researchers believe that only one in 100,000,000 GM tobacco plants actually would transmit the transgene via pollen. Such values are more than satisfactory to ensure coexistence.

A major hurdle for traditional nuclear genetically modified crops is posed by the potential [[outcrossing]] of the [[transgene]] via pollen movement. Initially it was thought that, plastid transformation, which yields transplastomic plants in which the pollen does not contain the transgene, not only increases biosafety, but also facilitates the coexistence of genetically modified, conventional and organic agriculture. Therefore, developing such crops was a major goal of research projects such as [[Co-Extra]] and Transcontainer.\n\nHowever, a study conducted on the [[Nicotiana|tabacco plant]] in 2007 has disproved this theory. Led by Ralph Bock from the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in Germany, researchers studied genetically modified tobacco in which the transgene was integrated in chloroplasts.<ref name=\":03222\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Ruf S, Karcher D, Bock R|date=April 2007|title=Determining the transgene containment level provided by chloroplast transformation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=104|issue=17|pages=6998\u20137002|doi=10.1073/pnas.0700008104|pmc=1849964|pmid=17420459}}</ref>  A transplatomic tabacco plant generated through chloroplast mediated transformation was bred with plants that were male sterile with an untouched chloroplast.<ref name=\":03222\" /> The transplastomic plants were engineered to have [[Antimicrobial resistance|resistance]] to the antibiotic [[spectinomycin]] and engineered to produce a [[Green fluorescent protein|fluorescent molecule]] (GFP).<ref name=\":03222\" /> Therefore, it was hypothesized that any offspring produced by from these two lines of tabacco plant should not be able to grow on spectinomycin or be fluorescent, as the genetic material in the chloroplast should not be able to transfer via pollen.<ref name=\":03222\" /> However, it was found that some of the seeds were resistant to the antibiotic and could germinate on spectinomycin agar plates.<ref name=\":03222\" /> Calculations showed that 1 out of every million [[pollen]] grains contained plastid genetic material, which would be hugely significant in an agricultural farm setting.<ref name=\":03222\" />Because tobacco has a strong tendency towards self-fertilisation, the reliability of transplastomic plants is assumed to be even higher under field conditions.

The landscaping spectrum of squares stretches from those containing more [[hardscape]] constituting [[town square]]s (also known as city squares) to those containing planted [[communal gardens]], for which London is a major international exponent, known as [[garden square]]s.  \n\nA few in the capital of the [[United Kingdom]] such as [[Trafalgar Square]] were from the outset ''public'' open spaces in exactly the same way as other city squares worldwide, typically a ''plaza'', ''piazza'' and a ''platz'' in Spain, Italy and Germany. Most, however, were garden squares that were originally built as private communal gardens for use by the inhabitants of the surrounding houses. All types of the space are more prevalent in parts of London with high (urban) density. Some of these gardens are now open to the public, while others, for example around [[Notting Hill]], are railed (a form of fencing) and private.\n\nThe terminology has been loosely applied for over a century.  Some have irregular shape &mdash; three triangles and pentagon feature among those officially named ''Square''. Approbative and technical studies of garden squares commonly cover equivalent landscaped communal gardens not named as a ''Square'' many of which spaces have become small public parks &mdash; a diversity of descriptive names features at [[List of garden squares in London|the list of London's \"garden squares\"]].\n\n==Name and shape==\n\"Square\" is a generic term for neat, planned or set aside urban open spaces larger than a verge or pavement overlooked by buildings. In London elements of fields were set aside, a fact reflected in the name of the square [[London Fields]] and two later examples: [[Coram's Fields]] and [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]].  Some are not actually square, or even rectangular. One reason for this is the use of a local nickname for the street, park or garden in question. Another is that some older squares were irregularly shaped to begin with, or lost their original layout due to the city's many transformations, not least following the [[Great Fire of London]] and [[The Blitz]].\n\nThe street naming (or streetnaming) authority of each [[London Borough]] and the [[City of London Corporation]] by authority of an Act of 1939 imposes rules to authorise appropriate street names for new developments and for owners wishing to rename features.<ref>London Buildings Acts (Amendment) Act 1939, Part 2: Naming and Numbering of Streets and Buildings.</ref>  Commercial building and retained historic names apart, new residential squares must in many boroughs be \"for a square only\" &mdash; considered not well elongated but rectangular and to some extent open.<ref>[https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/sites/default/files/atoms/files/New%20Application%20Pack.pdf Street Naming application pack] Example policy list from Kensington and Chelsea, replacing similar earlier rule. Retrieved 2018-03-12</ref>  Billiter Square, EC3 and Millennium Square, SE1 in districts dominated by retail, commerce and offices are among many modern buildings (not beside a visible rectangular open space) which have alternative, higher built density, square features to their design, such as a courtyard or a square footprint.\n\nSome squares are paved ([[Granary Square]]); some grass and trees ([[Russell Square]]); many others diverse communal gardens. Most of those which are square have the word in their name and these are listed below; others more flexibly identified do not; such notable lists are commonly identified as [[List of garden squares in London|list of garden squares]] or \"estate gardens\", \"communal gardens\", \"formal gardens\" about which many books have been written. Increasingly, spaces are being constructed that are [[Privately owned public space|legally private, although in practice open to the public]] ([[Paternoster Square]]). \n\nThe [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]] contains over a hundred garden squares whose use is restricted to residents. The upkeep of these spaces (almost all named after their adjoining streets for example Square/Crescent/Gardens/Place) is partly paid for through a levy on top of residents' [[council tax]].<ref>[http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/gardensquares/general/default.asp \"Your garden square and you\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711162431/http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/gardensquares/general/default.asp |date=2006-07-11 }}, [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]], London, UK. URL accessed 20 June 2006.</ref> One instance is a [[lens (geometry)|lens]] (pointed oval), [[The Boltons]].\n\nToward the public end of the public/private continuum, London's growth has taken in [[village green]]s. A minority of these partly or wholly survive such as [[Newington Green]] to form council-run open spaces breaking up housing, road networks and/or retail streets. The categories of greens and garden squares become more well-visited scaled up, above an informal cut-off, being the today mainly government-run, characteristic [[parks and open spaces in London]] &mdash; less urban such land includes London's 26 [[list of common land in London|commons]] most of which were significantly reduced in size in the period of [[Inclosure]] and 16 country parks.\n\n==History==\n===Development of Squares===\nThe making of residential squares fell into decline in the early 20th century, one of the last notable such squares having been designed by [[Edwin Lutyens]] for [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]]. Numerous squares were in danger of filling in for further building. This was banned by the [[London Squares Act of 1931]].{{clarify|there is no matching statute listed in the Acts of Parl. of United Kingdom - which Part of which Act does this refer to?|date=March 2018}}<ref name=Phelps>Camilla Phelps, \"London opens its gates\".

The landscaping spectrum of squares stretches from those containing more [[hardscape]] constituting [[town square]]s (also known as city squares) to those containing planted [[communal gardens]], for which London is a major international exponent, known as [[garden square]]s.  \n\nA few in the capital of the [[United Kingdom]] such as [[Trafalgar Square]] were from the outset ''public'' open spaces in exactly the same way as other city squares worldwide, typically a ''plaza'', ''piazza'' and a ''platz'' in Spain, Italy and Germany. Most, however, were garden squares that were originally built as private communal gardens for use by the inhabitants of the surrounding houses. All types of the space are more prevalent in parts of London with high (urban) density. Some of these gardens are now open to the public, while others, for example around [[Notting Hill]], are railed (a form of fencing) and private.\n\nThe terminology has been loosely applied for over a century.  Some have irregular shape &mdash; three triangles and pentagon feature among those officially named ''Square''. Approbative and technical studies of garden squares commonly cover equivalent landscaped communal gardens not named as a ''Square'' many of which spaces have become small public parks &mdash; a diversity of descriptive names features at [[List of garden squares in London|the list of London's \"garden squares\"]].\n\n==Name and shape==\n\"Square\" is a generic term for neat, planned or set aside urban open spaces larger than a verge or pavement overlooked by buildings. In London elements of fields were set aside, a fact reflected in the name of the square [[London Fields]] and two later examples: [[Coram's Fields]] and [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]].  Some are not actually square, or even rectangular. One reason for this is the use of a local nickname for the street, park or garden in question. Another is that some older squares were irregularly shaped to begin with, or lost their original layout due to the city's many transformations, not least following the [[Great Fire of London]] and [[The Blitz]].\n\nThe street naming (or streetnaming) authority of each [[London Borough]] and the [[City of London Corporation]] by authority of an Act of 1939 imposes rules to authorise appropriate street names for new developments and for owners wishing to rename features.<ref>London Buildings Acts (Amendment) Act 1939, Part 2: Naming and Numbering of Streets and Buildings.</ref>  Commercial building and retained historic names apart, new residential squares must in many boroughs be \"for a square only\" &mdash; considered not well elongated but rectangular and to some extent open.<ref>[https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/sites/default/files/atoms/files/New%20Application%20Pack.pdf Street Naming application pack] Example policy list from Kensington and Chelsea, replacing similar earlier rule. Retrieved 2018-03-12</ref>  Billiter Square, EC3 and Millennium Square, SE1 in districts dominated by retail, commerce and offices are among many modern buildings (not beside a visible rectangular open space) which have alternative, higher built density, square features to their design, such as a courtyard or a square footprint.\n\nSome squares are paved ([[Granary Square]]); some grass and trees ([[Russell Square]]); many others diverse communal gardens. Most of those which are square have the word in their name and these are listed below; others more flexibly identified do not; such notable lists are commonly identified as [[List of garden squares in London|list of garden squares]] or \"estate gardens\", \"communal gardens\", \"formal gardens\" about which many books have been written. Increasingly, spaces are being constructed that are [[Privately owned public space|legally private, although in practice open to the public]] ([[Paternoster Square]]). \n\nThe [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]] contains over a hundred garden squares whose use is restricted to residents. The upkeep of these spaces (almost all named after their adjoining streets for example Square/Crescent/Gardens/Place) is partly paid for through a levy on top of residents' [[council tax]].<ref>[http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/gardensquares/general/default.asp \"Your garden square and you\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711162431/http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/gardensquares/general/default.asp |date=2006-07-11 }}, [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]], London, UK. URL accessed 20 June 2006.</ref> One instance is a [[lens (geometry)|lens]] (pointed oval), [[The Boltons]].\n\nToward the public end of the public/private continuum, London's growth has taken in [[village green]]s. A minority of these partly or wholly survive such as [[Newington Green]] to form council-run open spaces breaking up housing, road networks and/or retail streets. The categories of greens and garden squares become more well-visited scaled up, above an informal cut-off, being the today mainly government-run, characteristic [[parks and open spaces in London]] &mdash; less urban such land includes London's 26 [[list of common land in London|commons]] most of which were significantly reduced in size in the period of [[Inclosure]] and 16 country parks.\n\n==History==\n===Development of Squares===\nThe making of residential squares fell into decline in the early 20th century, one of the last notable such squares having been designed by [[Edwin Lutyens]] for [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]]. Numerous squares were in danger of filling in for further building. This was banned by the [[London Squares Act of 1931]].{{clarify|there is no matching statute listed in the Acts of Parl. of United Kingdom - which Part of which Act does this refer to?|date=March 2018}}<ref name=Phelps>Camilla Phelps, \"London opens its gates\". ''The English Garden'', June 2013, 97.</ref> In the last quarter of the 20th century a fashion for making office squares developed, a trend led by the [[Broadgate]] development. Developers such as London Square, [[Berkeley Homes]] and [[Taylor Wimpey]] (in the first two instances through their London subsidiaries) have built and set aside land in more than one of their 21st century London developments to create those of the residential type.<ref>[http://londonsquare.co.uk/developments/detail/fulham \"Square\"] Details of 21st century square, at Farm Lane, Fulham, London Square Group, 2018</ref><ref>[http://londonsquare.co.uk/developments/detail/teddington \"Square\"\"] Details of 21st century square at Waldegrave Road, Teddington, London Square Group, 2018</ref><ref>[http://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/new-homes/london/orpington/brunswick-square \"Brunswick Square, Orpington\"] Berkeley Homes Group, 2018</ref><ref>[https://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/new-homes/london/kensington/royal-warwick-square \"Royal Warwick Square, Kensington\"], Berkeley Homes Group, 2018</ref><ref>[http://www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/find-your-home/england/london/harrow/st-georges-square \"St George's Square, Sudbury Hill, Harrow\"] Taylor Wimpey, 2018</ref><ref>[http://www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/find-your-home/england/london/surbiton/tolworth-square \"Tolworth Square, Surbiton\"] Taylor Wimpey, 2018</ref> More broadly, [[mixed-use]] squares to give a focal area have become a resurgent planning design, reflected for instance in Times Square, [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] and [[Canada Square]], [[Canary Wharf]].\n\n===Viewings and events in private communal gardens===\n{{See also|List of garden squares in London}}\nSince 1998 many private squares (which term in that context takes in many other shapes of gardens between houses) temporarily open to the paying public: London's \"Open Garden Squares Weekend\", founded by Caroline Aldiss, takes place on the second weekend in June.<ref>Phelps, \"London opens its gates\". ''The English Garden'', June 2013, 95\u201398.</ref> The event is organised by the [[London Parks and Garden Trust]]. In 2013 over 200 gardens took part, including the garden of the [[Prime Minister]] at [[10 Downing Street]] and the Gardens of [[HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs]]. Other events in keynote squares coincide such as a World Archaeology Festival, [[Gordon Square]], Bloomsbury run by [[UCL Institute of Archaeology]].<ref>[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/calendar/articles/20130608 \"World Archaeology Festival 2013\"], UCL.</ref>\n\nThe parks can be categorised as public garden squares, private [[garden square]]s or other squares.\n\n===Social importance===\n[[File:Was that a dream by Cedric Le Borgne.jpg|thumb|An illuminated wire sculpture of a nightingale, displayed in London's [[Berkeley Square]] as part of [[:w:Lumiere festival|Lumiere London 2018]], an art festival.

Initially cultural use was mainly confined to novels and, to a lesser degree, fine art. \n\n\"[[It's a Long Way to Tipperary]]\" is a 1910s song featuring the line \"Farewell [[Leicester Square]]\". \"[[A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square]]\" is a romantic [[popular song|hit]] of 1940 with lyrics by [[Eric Maschwitz]] and music by [[Manning Sherwin]], sang that year separately by [[Ray Noble (musician)|Ray Noble]] and [[Vera Lynn]] and a theme of a film the next year, by [[Fritz Lang]]., ''[[Man Hunt (1941 film)|Man Hunt]]''.  In the 1956 song \"Why Can't The English?\" from the musical ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', Professor Henry Higgins laments, \"Hear them down in Soho Square/Dropping H's everywhere.\"\n\nDrama most notably includes the high-audience [[soap opera]] broadcast by the [[BBC]] running since 1985, ''[[EastEnders]]'' based on a semi-permanent set north of London's border, [[Albert Square]].

An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

Writers have implied a wide range of involvement, from the keeper of horses or supervisor of the woodcutters, to the full responsibility of not only the survey of the ten mile square but the design of the city as well.

An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the [[radius]]. This article is about circles in [[Euclidean geometry]], and, in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.\n\nSpecifically, a circle is a [[Simple polygon|simple]] closed [[curve]] that divides the plane into two [[Region (mathematics)|regions]]: an [[interior (topology)|interior]] and an [[exterior]]. In everyday use, the term \"circle\" may be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure, or to the whole figure including its interior; in strict technical usage, the circle is only the boundary and the whole figure is called a [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]].\n\nA circle may also be defined as a special kind of [[ellipse]] in which the two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] are coincident and the [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] is 0, or the two-dimensional shape enclosing the most area per unit perimeter squared, using [[calculus of variations]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}{{Clear}}<!--To avoid layout breaking when TOC is hidden-->\n\n==Euclid's definition==\n{{quotation|A circle is a plane figure bounded by one curved line, and such that all straight lines drawn from a certain point within it to the bounding line, are equal.

Two topological circles are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of [[Real coordinate space|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>]] upon itself (known as an [[ambient isotopy]]).\n\n==Terminology==\n* [[Annulus (mathematics)|Annulus]]: a ring-shaped object, the region bounded by two [[concentric]] circles.\n* [[Arc (geometry)|Arc]]: any [[Connected space|connected]] part of a circle. Specifying two end points of an arc and a center allows for two arcs that together make up a full circle.\n* [[Centre (geometry)|Centre]]: the point equidistant from all points on the circle.\n* [[Chord (geometry)|Chord]]: a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle, thus dividing a circle into two segments.\n* [[Circumference]]: the length of one circuit along the circle, or the distance around the circle.\n* [[Diameter]]: a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle and that passes through the centre; or the length of such a line segment. This is the largest distance between any two points on the circle. It is a special case of a chord, namely the longest chord for a given circle, and its length is twice the length of a radius.\n* [[Disk (mathematics)|Disc]]: the region of the plane bounded by a circle.\n* [[Lens (geometry)|Lens]]: the region common to (the intersection of) two overlapping discs.\n* Passant: a [[coplanar]] straight line that has no point in common with the circle.\n* [[Radius]]: a line segment joining the centre of a circle with any single point on the circle itself; or the length of such a segment, which is half (the length of) a diameter.\n* [[Circular sector|Sector]]: a region bounded by two radii of equal length with a common center and either of the two possible arcs, determined by this center and the endpoints of the radii.\n* [[Circular segment|Segment]]: a region bounded by a chord and one of the arcs connecting the chord's endpoints. The length of the chord imposes a lower boundary on the diameter of possible arcs. Sometimes the term ''segment'' is used only for regions not containing the center of the circle to which their arc belongs to.\n* [[Secant line|Secant]]: an extended chord, a coplanar straight line, intersecting a circle in two points.\n* [[Semicircle]]: one of the two possible arcs determined by the endpoints of a diameter, taking its midpoint as center. In non-technical common usage it may mean the interior of the  two dimensional region bounded by a diameter and one of its arcs, that is technically called a half-[[Disk (mathematics)|disc]]. A half-disc is a special case of a [[Circular segment|segment]], namely the largest one.\n* [[Tangent]]: a coplanar straight line that has one single point in common with a circle (\"touches the circle at this point\").\nAll of the specified regions may be considered as ''open'', that is, not containing their boundaries, or as ''closed'', including their respective boundaries.\n{{Clear}}\n{| style=\"float:left;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n|[[Image:CIRCLE LINES.svg|right|thumb|Chord, secant, tangent, radius, and diameter]]\n|[[Image:Circle slices.svg|right|thumb|Arc, sector, and segment]]\n|}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==History==\n[[Image:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|\nThe [[compass (drafting)|compass]] in this 13th-century manuscript is a symbol of God's act of [[Creation myth|Creation]].

However, this parameterisation works only if ''t'' is made to range not only through all reals but also to a point at infinity; otherwise, the leftmost point of the circle would be omitted.\n\n'''3-point-form '''<br>\nThe equation of the circle determined by three points <math>(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2),(x_3,y_3)</math> not on a line is obtained by a conversion of the [[Ellipse#Circles|''3-point-form of a circle's equation'']]\n::<math>\\frac{({\\color{green}x}-x_1)({\\color{green}x}-x_2)+({\\color{red}y}-y_1)({\\color{red}y}-y_2)}\n             {({\\color{red}y}-y_1)({\\color{green}x}-x_2)-({\\color{red}y}-y_2)({\\color{green}x}-x_1)}=\n        \\frac{(x_3-x_1)(x_3-x_2)+(y_3-y_1)(y_3-y_2)}\n             {(y_3-y_1)(x_3-x_2)-(y_3-y_2)(x_3-x_1)}.</math>\n\n'''Homogeneous form'''<br>\nIn [[homogeneous coordinates]], each [[conic section]] with the equation of a circle has the form\n:<math>x^2+y^2-2axz-2byz+cz^2 = 0.\\,</math>\n\nIt can be proven that a conic section is a circle exactly when it contains (when extended to the [[complex projective plane]]) the points ''I''(1: ''i'': 0) and ''J''(1:&nbsp;\u2212''i'':&nbsp;0). These points are called the [[circular points at infinity]].\n\n====Polar coordinates====\nIn [[polar coordinates]], the equation of a circle is:\n:<math>r^2 - 2 r r_0 \\cos(\\theta - \\phi) + r_0^2 = a^2\\,</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' is the radius of the circle, <math>(r, \\theta)</math> is the polar coordinate of a generic point on the circle, and <math>(r_0, \\phi)</math> is the polar coordinate of the centre of the circle (i.e., ''r''<sub>0</sub> is the distance from the origin to the centre of the circle, and ''\u03c6'' is the anticlockwise angle from the positive ''x''-axis to the line connecting the origin to the centre of the circle). For a circle centred on the origin, i.e. ''r''<sub>0</sub> = 0, this reduces to simply {{nowrap|''r'' {{=}} ''a''}}. When {{nowrap|''r''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''a''}}, or when the origin lies on the circle, the equation becomes\n:<math>r = 2 a\\cos(\\theta - \\phi).\\,</math>\n\nIn the general case, the equation can be solved for ''r'', giving\n:<math>r = r_0 \\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - r_0^2 \\sin^2(\\theta - \\phi)},</math>\nNote that without the \u00b1 sign, the equation would in some cases describe only half a circle.\n\n====Complex plane====\nIn the [[complex plane]], a circle with a centre at ''c'' and radius ''r'' has the equation:\n\n:<math>|z-c| = r\\,</math>.\n\nIn [[Parametric equation|parametric form]], this can be written:\n\n:<math>z = re^{it}+c</math>.\n\nThe slightly generalised equation\n:<math>pz\\overline{z} + gz + \\overline{gz} = q</math>\n\nfor real ''p'', ''q'' and complex ''g'' is sometimes called a [[generalised circle]]. This becomes the above equation for a circle with <math>p = 1,\\ g=-\\overline{c},\\ q=r^2-|c|^2</math>, since <math>|z-c|^2 = z\\overline{z}-\\overline{c}z-c\\overline{z}+c\\overline{c}</math>. Not all generalised circles are actually circles: a generalised circle is either a (true) circle or a [[line (geometry)|line]].\n\n===Tangent lines===\n{{Main article|Tangent lines to circles}}\nThe [[tangent line]] through a point ''P'' on the circle is perpendicular to the diameter passing through ''P''. If {{nowrap|P {{=}} (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>)}} and the circle has centre (''a'', ''b'') and radius ''r'', then the tangent line is perpendicular to the line from (''a'', ''b'') to (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>), so it has the form {{nowrap|(''x''<sub>1</sub> \u2212 ''a'')''x'' + (''y''<sub>1</sub> \u2013 ''b'')''y'' {{=}} ''c''}}. Evaluating at (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>) determines the value of ''c'' and the result is that the equation of the tangent is\n:<math>(x_1-a)x+(y_1-b)y = (x_1-a)x_1+(y_1-b)y_1\\,</math>\nor\n:<math>(x_1-a)(x-a)+(y_1-b)(y-b) = r^2.\\!\\ </math>\n\nIf {{nowrap|''y''<sub>1</sub> \u2260 ''b''}} then the slope of this line is\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x_1-a}{y_1-b}.</math>\n\nThis can also be found using [[implicit differentiation]].\n\nWhen the centre of the circle is at the origin then the equation of the tangent line becomes\n:<math>x_1x+y_1y = r^2,\\!\\ </math>\nand its slope is\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x_1}{y_1}.</math>\n\n==Properties==\n* The circle is the shape with the largest area for a given length of perimeter. (See [[Isoperimetric inequality]].)\n* The circle is a highly symmetric shape: every line through the centre forms a line of [[reflection symmetry]] and it has [[rotational symmetry]] around the centre for every angle. Its [[symmetry group]] is the [[orthogonal group]] O(2,''R''). The group of rotations alone is the [[circle group]] '''T'''.\n* All circles are [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]].\n** A circle's circumference and radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]].\n** The [[area (geometry)|area]] enclosed and the square of its radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]].\n** The [[mathematical constant|constants]] of proportionality are 2{{pi}} and {{pi}}, respectively.\n* The circle that is centred at the origin with radius 1 is called the [[unit circle]].\n** Thought of as a [[great circle]] of the [[unit sphere]], it becomes the [[Riemannian circle]].\n* Through any three points, not all on the same line, there lies a unique circle. In [[Cartesian coordinates]], it is possible to give explicit formulae for the coordinates of the centre of the circle and the radius in terms of the coordinates of the three given points. See [[circumcircle]].\n\n===Chord===\n* Chords are equidistant from the centre of a circle if and only if they are equal in length.\n* The [[perpendicular bisector]] of a chord passes through the centre of a circle; equivalent statements stemming from the uniqueness of the perpendicular bisector are:\n** A perpendicular line from the centre of a circle bisects the chord.\n** The [[line segment]] through the centre bisecting a chord is [[perpendicular]] to the chord.\n* If a central angle and an [[inscribed angle]] of a circle are subtended by the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle.\n* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then they are equal.\n* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on opposite sides of the chord, then they are [[supplementary angles|supplementary]].\n** For a [[cyclic quadrilateral]], the [[exterior angle]] is equal to the interior opposite angle.\n* An inscribed angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle (see [[Thales' theorem]]).\n* The diameter is the longest chord of the circle.\n** Among all the circles with a chord AB in common, the circle with minimal radius is the one with diameter AB.\n* If the [[Intersecting chords theorem|intersection of any two chords]] divides one chord into lengths ''a'' and ''b'' and divides the other chord into lengths ''c'' and ''d'', then {{nowrap|''ab'' {{=}} ''cd''}}.\n* If the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths ''a'' and ''b'' and divides the other chord into lengths ''c'' and ''d'', then {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''d''<sup>2</sup>}} equals the square of the diameter.<ref>Posamentier and Salkind, ''Challenging Problems in Geometry'', Dover, 2nd edition, 1996: pp. 104\u2013105, #4\u201323.</ref>\n* The sum of the squared lengths of any two chords intersecting at right angles at a given point is the same as that of any other two perpendicular chords intersecting at the same point, and is given by 8''r'' <sup>2</sup> \u2013 4''p'' <sup>2</sup> (where ''r'' is the circle's radius and ''p'' is the distance from the centre point to the point of intersection).<ref>''[[College Mathematics Journal]]'' 29(4), September 1998, p. 331, problem 635.</ref>\n* The distance from a point on the circle to a given chord times the diameter of the circle equals the product of the distances from the point to the ends of the chord.<ref>Johnson, Roger A., ''Advanced Euclidean Geometry'', Dover Publ., 2007.</ref>{{rp|p.71}}\n\n===Tangent===\n* A line drawn perpendicular to a radius through the end point of the radius lying on the circle is a tangent to the circle.\n* A line drawn perpendicular to a tangent through the point of contact with a circle passes through the centre of the circle.\n* Two tangents can always be drawn to a circle from any point outside the circle, and these tangents are equal in length.\n* If a tangent at ''A'' and a tangent at ''B'' intersect at the exterior point ''P'', then denoting the centre as ''O'', the angles \u2220''BOA'' and \u2220''BPA'' are [[Supplementary angles|supplementary]].\n* If ''AD'' is tangent to the circle at ''A'' and if ''AQ'' is a chord of the circle, then {{nowrap|\u2220''DAQ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}arc(''AQ'')}}.\n\n===Theorems===\n[[Image:Secant-Secant Theorem.svg|thumb|right|Secant-secant theorem]]\n{{See also|Power of a point}}\n* The chord theorem states that if two chords, ''CD'' and ''EB'', intersect at ''A'', then {{nowrap|''AC'' \u00d7 ''AD'' {{=}} ''AB'' \u00d7 ''AE''}}.\n* If two secants, ''AE'' and ''AD'', also cut the circle at ''B'' and ''C'' respectively, then {{nowrap|''AC'' \u00d7 ''AD'' {{=}} ''AB'' \u00d7 ''AE''}}. (Corollary of the chord theorem.)\n* {{anchor|Tangent-secant theorem}}A tangent can be considered a limiting case of a secant whose ends are coincident. If a [[tangent]] from an external point ''A'' meets the circle at ''F'' and a [[Secant line|secant]] from the external point ''A'' meets the circle at ''C'' and ''D'' respectively, then {{nowrap|''AF''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''AC'' \u00d7 ''AD''}}. (Tangent-secant theorem.)\n* The angle between a chord and the tangent at one of its endpoints is equal to one half the angle subtended at the centre of the circle, on the opposite side of the chord (Tangent Chord Angle).\n* If the angle subtended by the chord at the centre is 90 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] then {{nowrap|''\u2113'' {{=}} ''r'' {{radic|2}}}}, where ''\u2113'' is the length of the chord and ''r'' is the radius of the circle.\n* {{anchor|Secant-secant theorem}}If two secants are inscribed in the circle as shown at right, then the measurement of angle ''A'' is equal to one half the difference of the measurements of the enclosed arcs (<math>\\overset{\\frown}{DE}</math> and <math>\\overset{\\frown}{BC}</math>). That is, <math>2\\angle{CAB}= \\angle{DOE} - \\angle{BOC}</math> where ''O'' is the centre of the circle. (Secant-secant theorem.)\n\n===Inscribed angles===\n{{See also|Inscribed angle theorem}}\n[[Image:inscribed angle theorem.svg|thumb|200px|right|Inscribed angle theorem]]\nAn [[inscribed angle]] (examples are the blue and green angles in the figure) is exactly half the corresponding [[central angle]] (red). Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal. Angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary. In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a [[diameter]] is a [[right angle]] (since the central angle is 180 degrees).\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Sagitta===\n[[Image:circle Sagitta.svg|thumb|277px|right|The sagitta is the vertical segment.]]\n* The [[Sagitta (geometry)|sagitta]] (also known as the [[versine]]) is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the arc of the circle.\n* Given the length ''y'' of a chord, and the length ''x'' of the sagitta, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle that will fit around the two lines:\n:: <math>r=\\frac{y^2}{8x}+ \\frac{x}{2}.</math>\n\nAnother proof of this result, which relies only on two chord properties given above, is as follows. Given a chord of length ''y'' and with sagitta of length ''x'', since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know it is part of a diameter of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the \"missing\" part of the diameter is ({{nowrap|2''r'' \u2212 ''x''}}) in length. Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that ({{nowrap|2''r'' \u2212 ''x'')''x'' {{=}} (''y'' / 2)<sup>2</sup>}}. Solving for ''r'', we find the required result.\n\n==Compass and straightedge constructions==\n\nThere are many [[compass-and-straightedge construction]]s resulting in circles.\n\nThe simplest and most basic is the construction given the centre of the circle and a point on the circle. Place the fixed leg of the [[Compass (drawing tool)|compass]] on the centre point, the movable leg on the point on the circle and rotate the compass.\n\n=== Construction with given diameter ===\n* Construct the [[midpoint (geometry)|midpoint]] {{math|'''M'''}} of the diameter.\n* Construct the circle with centre {{math|'''M'''}} passing through one of the endpoints of the diameter (it will also pass through the other endpoint).\n\n[[File:Circunferencia 10.svg|thumb|Construct a circle through points A, B and C by finding the perpendicular bisectors (red) of the sides of the triangle (blue).

Stanley]], ''Excursions in Geometry'', Dover, 1969, 14\u201317.</ref> (The set of points where the distances are equal is the perpendicular bisector of segment ''AB'', a line.) That circle is sometimes said to be drawn ''about'' two points.\n\nThe proof is in two parts. First, one must prove that, given two foci ''A'' and ''B'' and a ratio of distances, any point ''P'' satisfying the ratio of distances must fall on a particular circle. Let ''C'' be another point, also satisfying the ratio and lying on segment ''AB''. By the [[angle bisector theorem]] the line segment ''PC'' will bisect the [[interior angle]] ''APB'', since the segments are similar:\n:<math>\\frac{AP}{BP} = \\frac{AC}{BC}.</math>\n\nAnalogously, a line segment ''PD'' through some point ''D'' on ''AB'' extended bisects the corresponding [[exterior angle]] ''BPQ'' where ''Q'' is on ''AP'' extended. Since the interior and exterior angles sum to 180 degrees, the angle ''CPD'' is exactly 90 degrees, i.e., a [[right angle]]. The set of points ''P'' such that angle ''CPD'' is a right angle forms a circle, of which ''CD'' is a diameter.\n\nSecond, see<ref>Altshiller-Court, Nathan, ''College Geometry'', Dover, 2007 (orig. 1952).</ref>{{rp|p.15}} for a proof that every point on the indicated circle satisfies the given ratio.\n\n===Cross-ratios===\nA closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the [[cross-ratio]] of points in the [[complex plane]]. If ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are as above, then the circle of Apollonius for these three points is the collection of points ''P'' for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one:\n:<math>|[A,B;C,P]| = 1.\\ </math>\n\nStated another way, ''P'' is a point on the circle of Apollonius if and only if the cross-ratio [''A'',''B'';''C'',''P''] is on the [[unit circle]] in the complex plane.\n\n==={{anchor|Generalized circles}} Generalised circles===\n{{See also|Generalised circle}}\nIf ''C'' is the [[midpoint]] of the segment ''AB'', then the collection of points ''P'' satisfying the Apollonius condition\n:<math>\\frac{|AP|}{|BP|} = \\frac{|AC|}{|BC|}</math>{{pad|1em}}\n\nis not a circle, but rather a line.\n\nThus, if ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points ''P'' satisfying the above equation is called a \"generalised circle.\" It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a [[line (geometry)|line]] is a generalised circle of infinite radius.\n\n==Inscription in or circumscription about other figures==\nIn every [[triangle]] a unique circle, called the [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle|incircle]], can be inscribed such that it is [[tangent]] to each of the three sides of the triangle.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Incircle.html Incircle \u2013 from Wolfram MathWorld] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121111333/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Incircle.html |date=2012-01-21 }}.

A polygon that is both cyclic and tangential is called a [[bicentric polygon]].\n\nA [[hypocycloid]] is a curve that is inscribed in a given circle by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle that rolls within and tangent to the given circle.\n\n==Limiting case of other figures==\nThe circle can be viewed as a [[Limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of each of various other figures:\n* A [[Cartesian oval]] is a set of points such that a [[weighted sum]] of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points ([[Focus (geometry)|foci]]) is a constant. An [[ellipse]] is the case in which the weights are equal. A circle is an ellipse with an [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of zero, meaning that the two foci coincide with each other as the centre of the circle. A circle is also a different special case of a Cartesian oval in which one of the weights is zero.\n* A [[superellipse]] has an equation of the form <math>\\left|\\frac{x}{a}\\right|^n\\! + \\left|\\frac{y}{b}\\right|^n\\! = 1</math> for positive ''a'', ''b'', and ''n''. A supercircle has {{nowrap|''b'' {{=}} ''a''}}. A circle is the special case of a supercircle in which {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2}}.\n* A [[Cassini oval]] is a set of points such that the product of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points is a constant. When the two fixed points coincide, a circle results.\n* A [[curve of constant width]] is a figure whose width, defined as the perpendicular distance between two distinct parallel lines each intersecting its boundary in a single point, is the same regardless of the direction of those two parallel lines. The circle is the simplest example of this type of figure.\n\n==In other ''p''-norms==\n[[Image:Vector-p-Norms qtl1.svg|thumb|right|Illustrations of [[unit circle]]s (see also [[superellipse]]) in different {{math|''p''}}-norms (every vector from the origin to the unit circle has a length of one, the length being calculated with length-formula of the corresponding {{math|''p''}}).]]\nDefining a circle as the set of points with a fixed distance from a point, different shapes can be considered circles under different definitions of distance. In [[p-norm|''p''-norm]], distance is determined by\n:<math> \\left\\| x \\right\\| _p = \\left( |x_1|^p + |x_2|^p + \\dotsb + |x_n|^p \\right) ^{1/p} .</math>\nIn Euclidean geometry, ''p'' = 2, giving the familiar\n:<math> \\left\\| x \\right\\| _2 = \\sqrt{ |x_1|^2 + |x_2|^2 + \\dotsb + |x_n|^2 } .</math>\n\nIn [[taxicab geometry]], ''p'' = 1. Taxicab circles are [[square (geometry)|squares]] with sides oriented at a 45\u00b0 angle to the coordinate axes. While each side would have length <math>\\sqrt{2}r</math> using a [[Euclidean metric]], where ''r'' is the circle's radius, its length in taxicab geometry is 2''r''. Thus, a circle's circumference is 8''r''. Thus, the value of a geometric analog to [[Pi|<math>\\pi </math>]] is 4 in this geometry. The formula for the unit circle in taxicab geometry is <math>|x| + |y| = 1</math> in [[Cartesian coordinates]] and\n\n:<math>r = \\frac{1}{| \\sin \\theta| + |\\cos\\theta|}</math>\n\nin [[polar coordinates]].\n\nA circle of radius 1 (using this distance) is the [[von Neumann neighborhood]] of its center.\n\nA circle of radius ''r'' for the [[Chebyshev distance]] ([[Lp space|L<sub>\u221e</sub> metric]]) on a plane is also a square with side length 2''r'' parallel to the coordinate axes, so planar Chebyshev distance can be viewed as equivalent by rotation and scaling to planar taxicab distance. However, this equivalence between L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>\u221e</sub> metrics does not generalize to higher dimensions.\n\n==Squaring the circle==\n{{main|Squaring the circle}}\n\n[[Squaring the circle]] is the problem, proposed by [[classical antiquity|ancient]] [[geometers]], of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with [[compass and straightedge]].\n\nIn 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the [[Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem]], which proves that [[pi]] ({{pi}}) is a [[transcendental number]], rather than an [[algebraic number|algebraic irrational number]]; that is, it is not the [[root of a function|root]] of any [[polynomial]] with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients.\n\n==Significance in art and symbolism==\nFrom the time of the earliest known civilisations \u2013 such as the Assyrians and ancient Egyptians, those in the Indus Valley and along the Yellow River in China, and the Western civilisations of ancient Greece and Rome during classical Antiquity \u2013 the circle has been used directly or indirectly in visual art to convey the artist\u2019s message and to express certain ideas.\nHowever, differences in worldview (beliefs and culture) had a great impact on artists\u2019 perceptions. While some emphasised the circle\u2019s perimeter to demonstrate their democratic manifestation, others focused on its centre to symbolise the concept of cosmic unity. In mystical doctrines, the circle mainly symbolises the infinite and cyclical nature of existence, but in religious traditions it represents heavenly bodies and divine spirits.\nThe circle signifies many sacred and spiritual concepts, including unity, infinity, wholeness, the universe, divinity, balance, stability and perfection, among others. Such concepts have been conveyed in cultures worldwide through the use of symbols, for example, a compass, a halo, the vesica piscis and its derivatives (fish, eye, aureole, mandorla, etc.), the ouroboros, the Dharma wheel, a rainbow, mandalas, rose windows and so forth. <ref>Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Charnier, [https://books.google.com/books?id=J9PNwQEACAAJ&dq=the+louvre+abu+dhabi+a+world+vision+of+art&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjVucfTpqHmAhWNwqYKHeSBBcMQ6AEwAXoECAMQAgl \"The Circle from East to West\"], ''The Louvre Abu Dhabi: A World Vision of Art'', October 29, 2019</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Affine sphere]]\n* [[Annulus (mathematics)]]\n* [[Apeirogon]]\n* [[Circle fitting]]\n* [[List of circle topics]]\n* [[Sphere]]\n* [[Three points determine a circle]]\n* [[Translation of axes]]\n\n===Specially named circles===\n* [[Unit circle]]\n* [[Apollonian circles]]\n* [[Chromatic circle]]\n* [[Ford circle]]\n* [[Circle of antisimilitude]]\n* [[Carlyle circle]]\n* [[Bankoff circle]]\n* [[Archimedes' twin circles]]\n* [[Archimedean circle]]\n* [[Johnson circles]]\n* [[Schoch circles]]\n* [[Woo circles]]\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n====Of a triangle====\n* [[Mandart circle]]\n* [[Spieker circle]]\n* [[Nine-point circle]]\n* [[Lemoine circle]]\n* [[Circumcircle]]\n* [[Incircle]]\n* [[Excircle]]\n* [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle#Other excircle properties|Apollonius circle of the excircles]]\n* [[Lester circle]]\n* [[Malfatti circles]]\n* [[Brocard circle]]\n* [[Orthocentroidal circle]]\n* [[Van Lamoen circle]]\n* [[Parry circle]]\n* [[Polar circle (geometry)]]\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n====Of certain quadrilaterals====\n* [[Eight-point circle]] of an orthodiagonal quadrilateral\n* [[Tangential quadrilateral|Incircle of a tangential quadrilateral]]\n* [[Cyclic quadrilateral|Circumcircle of a cyclic quadrilateral]]\n\n====Of certain polygons====\n* [[Cyclic polygon|Circumcircle of a cyclic polygon]]\n* [[Tangential polygon|Incircle of a tangential polygon]]\n\n====Of a conic section====\n* [[Director circle]]\n* [[Directrix circle]]\n\n====Of a sphere====\n* [[Great circle]]\n* [[Riemannian circle]]\n\n====Of a torus====\n* [[Villarceau circles]]\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |author=Pedoe, Dan |title=Geometry: a comprehensive course |publisher=Dover |year=1988}}\n* [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Curves/Circle.html \"Circle\" in The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons and category|Circles|Circles}}\n{{wikiquote|Circles}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Circle}}\n* {{springer|title=Circle|id=p/c022260}}\n* [[planetmath:4236|Circle (PlanetMath.org website)]]\n* {{MathWorld |urlname=Circle |title=Circle}}\n* {{cite web| url = http://www.mathopenref.com/tocs/circlestoc.html   | title = Interactive Java applets | quote = for the properties of and elementary constructions involving circles}}\n* {{cite web| url = http://www.mathwarehouse.com/geometry/circle/interactive-circle-equation.php  | title = Interactive Standard Form Equation of Circle | quote = Click and drag points to see standard form equation in action}}\n* {{cite web| url = http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/Munching/circle.shtml  | title = Munching on Circles | quote =  [[cut-the-knot]]}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Circles| ]]\n[[Category:Elementary shapes]]\n[[Category:Curves]]\n[[Category:Conic sections]]\n[[Category:Pi]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Simple curve of Euclidean geometry}}\n{{About|the shape and mathematical concept}}\n{{redirect2|360 degrees|360\u00b0}}\n{{Use British English|date=September 2016}}{{Infobox polygon\n|name       = Circle\n|image      = Circle-withsegments.svg\n|caption    = A circle (black), which is measured by its circumference (''C''), diameter (''D'') in cyan, and radius (''R'') in red; its centre (''O'') is in magenta.\n}}\n\nA '''circle''' is a [[shape]] consisting of all [[point (geometry)|points]] in a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] that are a given distance from a given point, the<!-- This article is written using British English \u2013 see WP:ENGVAR, Wikipedia articles should remain with the original variant 'center' is the American English spelling --> [[Centre (geometry)|centre]];<!--see comment before about 'center'--> equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]]. The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the [[radius]]. This article is about circles in [[Euclidean geometry]], and, in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.\n\nSpecifically, a circle is a [[Simple polygon|simple]] closed [[curve]] that divides the plane into two [[Region (mathematics)|regions]]: an [[interior (topology)|interior]] and an [[exterior]]. In everyday use, the term \"circle\" may be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure, or to the whole figure including its interior; in strict technical usage, the circle is only the boundary and the whole figure is called a [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]].\n\nA circle may also be defined as a special kind of [[ellipse]] in which the two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] are coincident and the [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] is 0, or the two-dimensional shape enclosing the most area per unit perimeter squared, using [[calculus of variations]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}{{Clear}}<!--To avoid layout breaking when TOC is hidden-->\n\n==Euclid's definition==\n{{quotation|A circle is a plane figure bounded by one curved line, and such that all straight lines drawn from a certain point within it to the bounding line, are equal.

Two topological circles are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of '''R'''<sup>3</sup> upon itself (known as an [[ambient isotopy]]).\n\n==Terminology==\n* [[Annulus (mathematics)|Annulus]]: a ring-shaped object, the region bounded by two [[concentric]] circles.\n* [[Arc (geometry)|Arc]]: any [[Connected space|connected]] part of a circle. Specifying two end points of an arc and a center allows for two arcs that together make up a full circle.\n* [[Centre (geometry)|Centre]]: the point equidistant from all points on the circle.\n* [[Chord (geometry)|Chord]]: a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle, thus dividing a circle into two segments.\n* [[Circumference]]: the length of one circuit along the circle, or the distance around the circle.\n* [[Diameter]]: a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle and that passes through the centre; or the length of such a line segment. This is the largest distance between any two points on the circle. It is a special case of a chord, namely the longest chord for a given circle, and its length is twice the length of a radius.\n* [[Disk (mathematics)|Disc]]: the region of the plane bounded by a circle.\n* [[Lens (geometry)|Lens]]: the region common to (the intersection of) two overlapping discs.\n* Passant: a [[coplanar]] straight line that has no point in common with the circle.\n* [[Radius]]: a line segment joining the centre of a circle with any single point on the circle itself; or the length of such a segment, which is half (the length of) a diameter.\n* [[Circular sector|Sector]]: a region bounded by two radii of equal length with a common center and either of the two possible arcs, determined by this center and the endpoints of the radii.\n* [[Circular segment|Segment]]: a region bounded by a chord and one of the arcs connecting the chord's endpoints. The length of the chord imposes a lower boundary on the diameter of possible arcs. Sometimes the term ''segment'' is used only for regions not containing the center of the circle to which their arc belongs to.\n* [[Secant line|Secant]]: an extended chord, a coplanar straight line, intersecting a circle in two points.\n* [[Semicircle]]: one of the two possible arcs determined by the endpoints of a diameter, taking its midpoint as center. In non-technical common usage it may mean the interior of the  two dimensional region bounded by a diameter and one of its arcs, that is technically called a half-[[Disk (mathematics)|disc]]. A half-disc is a special case of a [[Circular segment|segment]], namely the largest one.\n* [[Tangent]]: a coplanar straight line that has one single point in common with a circle (\"touches the circle at this point\").\nAll of the specified regions may be considered as ''open'', that is, not containing their boundaries, or as ''closed'', including their respective boundaries.\n{{Clear}}\n{| style=\"float:left;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n|[[Image:CIRCLE LINES.svg|right|thumb|Chord, secant, tangent, radius, and diameter]]\n|[[Image:Circle slices.svg|right|thumb|Arc, sector, and segment]]\n|}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==History==\n[[Image:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|\nThe [[compass (drafting)|compass]] in this 13th-century manuscript is a symbol of God's act of [[Creation myth|Creation]].

If the circle is centred at the origin (0, 0), then the equation simplifies to\n:<math>x^2 + y^2 = r^2.\\!\\ </math>\n\n'''Parametric form '''<br>\nThe equation can be written in [[parametric equation|parametric form]] using the [[trigonometric function]]s sine and cosine as\n:<math>x = a+r\\,\\cos t,\\,</math>\n:<math>y = b+r\\,\\sin t\\,</math>\nwhere ''t'' is a [[parametric variable]] in the range 0 to 2{{pi}}, interpreted geometrically as the [[angle]] that the ray from (''a'',&nbsp;''b'') to (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') makes with the positive ''x''-axis.\n\nAn alternative parametrisation of the circle is:\n:<math>x = a + r \\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}.\\,</math>\n:<math>y = b + r \\frac{2t}{1+t^2}\\,</math>\n\nIn this parameterisation, the ratio of ''t'' to ''r'' can be interpreted geometrically as the [[stereographic projection]] of the line passing through the centre parallel to the ''x''-axis (see [[Tangent half-angle substitution]]). However, this parameterisation works only if ''t'' is made to range not only through all reals but also to a point at infinity; otherwise, the leftmost point of the circle would be omitted.\n\n'''3-point-form '''<br>\nThe equation of the circle determined by three points <math>(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2),(x_3,y_3)</math> not on a line is obtained by a conversion of the [[Ellipse#Circles|''3-point-form of a circle's equation'']]\n::<math>\\frac{({\\color{green}x}-x_1)({\\color{green}x}-x_2)+({\\color{red}y}-y_1)({\\color{red}y}-y_2)}\n             {({\\color{red}y}-y_1)({\\color{green}x}-x_2)-({\\color{red}y}-y_2)({\\color{green}x}-x_1)}=\n        \\frac{(x_3-x_1)(x_3-x_2)+(y_3-y_1)(y_3-y_2)}\n             {(y_3-y_1)(x_3-x_2)-(y_3-y_2)(x_3-x_1)}.</math>\n\n'''Homogeneous form'''<br>\nIn [[homogeneous coordinates]], each [[conic section]] with the equation of a circle has the form\n:<math>x^2+y^2-2axz-2byz+cz^2 = 0.\\,</math>\n\nIt can be proven that a conic section is a circle exactly when it contains (when extended to the [[complex projective plane]]) the points ''I''(1: ''i'': 0) and ''J''(1:&nbsp;\u2212''i'':&nbsp;0). These points are called the [[circular points at infinity]].\n\n====Polar coordinates====\nIn [[polar coordinates]], the equation of a circle is:\n:<math>r^2 - 2 r r_0 \\cos(\\theta - \\phi) + r_0^2 = a^2\\,</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' is the radius of the circle, <math>(r, \\theta)</math> is the polar coordinate of a generic point on the circle, and <math>(r_0, \\phi)</math> is the polar coordinate of the centre of the circle (i.e., ''r''<sub>0</sub> is the distance from the origin to the centre of the circle, and ''\u03c6'' is the anticlockwise angle from the positive ''x''-axis to the line connecting the origin to the centre of the circle). For a circle centred on the origin, i.e. ''r''<sub>0</sub> = 0, this reduces to simply {{nowrap|''r'' {{=}} ''a''}}. When {{nowrap|''r''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''a''}}, or when the origin lies on the circle, the equation becomes\n:<math>r = 2 a\\cos(\\theta - \\phi).\\,</math>\n\nIn the general case, the equation can be solved for ''r'', giving\n:<math>r = r_0 \\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - r_0^2 \\sin^2(\\theta - \\phi)},</math>\nNote that without the \u00b1 sign, the equation would in some cases describe only half a circle.\n\n====Complex plane====\nIn the [[complex plane]], a circle with a centre at ''c'' and radius ''r'' has the equation:\n\n:<math>|z-c| = r\\,</math>.\n\nIn [[Parametric equation|parametric form]], this can be written:\n\n:<math>z = re^{it}+c</math>.\n\nThe slightly generalised equation\n:<math>pz\\overline{z} + gz + \\overline{gz} = q</math>\n\nfor real ''p'', ''q'' and complex ''g'' is sometimes called a [[generalised circle]]. This becomes the above equation for a circle with <math>p = 1,\\ g=-\\overline{c},\\ q=r^2-|c|^2</math>, since <math>|z-c|^2 = z\\overline{z}-\\overline{c}z-c\\overline{z}+c\\overline{c}</math>. Not all generalised circles are actually circles: a generalised circle is either a (true) circle or a [[line (geometry)|line]].\n\n===Tangent lines===\n{{Main article|Tangent lines to circles}}\nThe [[tangent line]] through a point ''P'' on the circle is perpendicular to the diameter passing through ''P''. If {{nowrap|P {{=}} (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>)}} and the circle has centre (''a'', ''b'') and radius ''r'', then the tangent line is perpendicular to the line from (''a'', ''b'') to (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>), so it has the form {{nowrap|(''x''<sub>1</sub> \u2212 ''a'')''x'' + (''y''<sub>1</sub> \u2013 ''b'')''y'' {{=}} ''c''}}. Evaluating at (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>) determines the value of ''c'' and the result is that the equation of the tangent is\n:<math>(x_1-a)x+(y_1-b)y = (x_1-a)x_1+(y_1-b)y_1\\,</math>\nor\n:<math>(x_1-a)(x-a)+(y_1-b)(y-b) = r^2.\\!\\ </math>\n\nIf {{nowrap|''y''<sub>1</sub> \u2260 ''b''}} then the slope of this line is\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x_1-a}{y_1-b}.</math>\n\nThis can also be found using [[implicit differentiation]].\n\nWhen the centre of the circle is at the origin then the equation of the tangent line becomes\n:<math>x_1x+y_1y = r^2,\\!\\ </math>\nand its slope is\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x_1}{y_1}.</math>\n\n==Properties==\n* The circle is the shape with the largest area for a given length of perimeter. (See [[Isoperimetric inequality]].)\n* The circle is a highly symmetric shape: every line through the centre forms a line of [[reflection symmetry]] and it has [[rotational symmetry]] around the centre for every angle. Its [[symmetry group]] is the [[orthogonal group]] O(2,''R''). The group of rotations alone is the [[circle group]] '''T'''.\n* All circles are [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]].\n** A circle's circumference and radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]].\n** The [[area (geometry)|area]] enclosed and the square of its radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]].\n** The [[mathematical constant|constants]] of proportionality are 2{{pi}} and {{pi}}, respectively.\n* The circle that is centred at the origin with radius 1 is called the [[unit circle]].\n** Thought of as a [[great circle]] of the [[unit sphere]], it becomes the [[Riemannian circle]].\n* Through any three points, not all on the same line, there lies a unique circle. In [[Cartesian coordinates]], it is possible to give explicit formulae for the coordinates of the centre of the circle and the radius in terms of the coordinates of the three given points. See [[circumcircle]].\n\n===Chord===\n* Chords are equidistant from the centre of a circle if and only if they are equal in length.\n* The [[perpendicular bisector]] of a chord passes through the centre of a circle; equivalent statements stemming from the uniqueness of the perpendicular bisector are:\n** A perpendicular line from the centre of a circle bisects the chord.\n** The [[line segment]] through the centre bisecting a chord is [[perpendicular]] to the chord.\n* If a central angle and an [[inscribed angle]] of a circle are subtended by the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle.\n* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then they are equal.\n* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on opposite sides of the chord, then they are [[supplementary angles|supplementary]].\n** For a [[cyclic quadrilateral]], the [[exterior angle]] is equal to the interior opposite angle.\n* An inscribed angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle (see [[Thales' theorem]]).\n* The diameter is the longest chord of the circle.\n** Among all the circles with a chord AB in common, the circle with minimal radius is the one with diameter AB.\n* If the [[Intersecting chords theorem|intersection of any two chords]] divides one chord into lengths ''a'' and ''b'' and divides the other chord into lengths ''c'' and ''d'', then {{nowrap|''ab'' {{=}} ''cd''}}.\n* If the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths ''a'' and ''b'' and divides the other chord into lengths ''c'' and ''d'', then {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''d''<sup>2</sup>}} equals the square of the diameter.<ref>Posamentier and Salkind, ''Challenging Problems in Geometry'', Dover, 2nd edition, 1996: pp. 104\u2013105, #4\u201323.</ref>\n* The sum of the squared lengths of any two chords intersecting at right angles at a given point is the same as that of any other two perpendicular chords intersecting at the same point, and is given by 8''r'' <sup>2</sup> \u2013 4''p'' <sup>2</sup> (where ''r'' is the circle's radius and ''p'' is the distance from the centre point to the point of intersection).<ref>''[[College Mathematics Journal]]'' 29(4), September 1998, p. 331, problem 635.</ref>\n* The distance from a point on the circle to a given chord times the diameter of the circle equals the product of the distances from the point to the ends of the chord.<ref>Johnson, Roger A., ''Advanced Euclidean Geometry'', Dover Publ., 2007.</ref>{{rp|p.71}}\n\n===Tangent===\n* A line drawn perpendicular to a radius through the end point of the radius lying on the circle is a tangent to the circle.\n* A line drawn perpendicular to a tangent through the point of contact with a circle passes through the centre of the circle.\n* Two tangents can always be drawn to a circle from any point outside the circle, and these tangents are equal in length.\n* If a tangent at ''A'' and a tangent at ''B'' intersect at the exterior point ''P'', then denoting the centre as ''O'', the angles \u2220''BOA'' and \u2220''BPA'' are [[Supplementary angles|supplementary]].\n* If ''AD'' is tangent to the circle at ''A'' and if ''AQ'' is a chord of the circle, then {{nowrap|\u2220''DAQ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}arc(''AQ'')}}.\n\n===Theorems===\n[[Image:Secant-Secant Theorem.svg|thumb|right|Secant-secant theorem]]\n{{See also|Power of a point}}\n* The chord theorem states that if two chords, ''CD'' and ''EB'', intersect at ''A'', then {{nowrap|''AC'' \u00d7 ''AD'' {{=}} ''AB'' \u00d7 ''AE''}}.\n* If two secants, ''AE'' and ''AD'', also cut the circle at ''B'' and ''C'' respectively, then {{nowrap|''AC'' \u00d7 ''AD'' {{=}} ''AB'' \u00d7 ''AE''}}.

(Tangent-secant theorem.)\n* The angle between a chord and the tangent at one of its endpoints is equal to one half the angle subtended at the centre of the circle, on the opposite side of the chord (Tangent Chord Angle).\n* If the angle subtended by the chord at the centre is 90 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] then {{nowrap|''\u2113'' {{=}} ''r'' {{radic|2}}}}, where ''\u2113'' is the length of the chord and ''r'' is the radius of the circle.\n* {{anchor|Secant-secant theorem}}If two secants are inscribed in the circle as shown at right, then the measurement of angle ''A'' is equal to one half the difference of the measurements of the enclosed arcs (<math>\\overset{\\frown}{DE}</math> and <math>\\overset{\\frown}{BC}</math>). That is, <math>2\\angle{CAB}= \\angle{DOE} - \\angle{BOC}</math> where ''O'' is the centre of the circle. (Secant-secant theorem.)\n\n===Inscribed angles===\n{{See also|Inscribed angle theorem}}\n[[Image:inscribed angle theorem.svg|thumb|200px|right|Inscribed angle theorem]]\nAn [[inscribed angle]] (examples are the blue and green angles in the figure) is exactly half the corresponding [[central angle]] (red). Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal. Angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary. In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a [[diameter]] is a [[right angle]] (since the central angle is 180 degrees).\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Sagitta===\n[[Image:circle Sagitta.svg|thumb|277px|right|The sagitta is the vertical segment.]]\n* The [[Sagitta (geometry)|sagitta]] (also known as the [[versine]]) is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the arc of the circle.\n* Given the length ''y'' of a chord, and the length ''x'' of the sagitta, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle that will fit around the two lines:\n:: <math>r=\\frac{y^2}{8x}+ \\frac{x}{2}.</math>\n\nAnother proof of this result, which relies only on two chord properties given above, is as follows. Given a chord of length ''y'' and with sagitta of length ''x'', since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know it is part of a diameter of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the \"missing\" part of the diameter is ({{nowrap|2''r'' \u2212 ''x''}}) in length. Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that ({{nowrap|2''r'' \u2212 ''x'')''x'' {{=}} (''y'' / 2)<sup>2</sup>}}. Solving for ''r'', we find the required result.\n\n==Compass and straightedge constructions==\n\nThere are many [[compass-and-straightedge construction]]s resulting in circles.\n\nThe simplest and most basic is the construction given the centre of the circle and a point on the circle. Place the fixed leg of the [[Compass (drawing tool)|compass]] on the centre point, the movable leg on the point on the circle and rotate the compass.\n\n=== Construction with given diameter ===\n* Construct the [[midpoint (geometry)|midpoint]] {{math|'''M'''}} of the diameter.\n* Construct the circle with centre {{math|'''M'''}} passing through one of the endpoints of the diameter (it will also pass through the other endpoint).\n\n[[File:Circunferencia 10.svg|thumb|Construct a circle through points A, B and C by finding the perpendicular bisectors (red) of the sides of the triangle (blue).

Stanley]], ''Excursions in Geometry'', Dover, 1969, 14\u201317.</ref> (The set of points where the distances are equal is the perpendicular bisector of segment ''AB'', a line.) That circle is sometimes said to be drawn ''about'' two points.\n\nThe proof is in two parts. First, one must prove that, given two foci ''A'' and ''B'' and a ratio of distances, any point ''P'' satisfying the ratio of distances must fall on a particular circle. Let ''C'' be another point, also satisfying the ratio and lying on segment ''AB''. By the [[angle bisector theorem]] the line segment ''PC'' will bisect the [[interior angle]] ''APB'', since the segments are similar:\n:<math>\\frac{AP}{BP} = \\frac{AC}{BC}.</math>\n\nAnalogously, a line segment ''PD'' through some point ''D'' on ''AB'' extended bisects the corresponding [[exterior angle]] ''BPQ'' where ''Q'' is on ''AP'' extended. Since the interior and exterior angles sum to 180 degrees, the angle ''CPD'' is exactly 90 degrees, i.e., a [[right angle]]. The set of points ''P'' such that angle ''CPD'' is a right angle forms a circle, of which ''CD'' is a diameter.\n\nSecond, see<ref>Altshiller-Court, Nathan, ''College Geometry'', Dover, 2007 (orig. 1952).</ref>{{rp|p.15}} for a proof that every point on the indicated circle satisfies the given ratio.\n\n===Cross-ratios===\nA closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the [[cross-ratio]] of points in the [[complex plane]]. If ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are as above, then the circle of Apollonius for these three points is the collection of points ''P'' for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one:\n:<math>|[A,B;C,P]| = 1.\\ </math>\n\nStated another way, ''P'' is a point on the circle of Apollonius if and only if the cross-ratio [''A'',''B'';''C'',''P''] is on the [[unit circle]] in the complex plane.\n\n==={{anchor|Generalized circles}} Generalised circles===\n{{See also|Generalised circle}}\nIf ''C'' is the [[midpoint]] of the segment ''AB'', then the collection of points ''P'' satisfying the Apollonius condition\n:<math>\\frac{|AP|}{|BP|} = \\frac{|AC|}{|BC|}</math>{{pad|1em}}\n\nis not a circle, but rather a line.\n\nThus, if ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points ''P'' satisfying the above equation is called a \"generalised circle.\" It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a [[line (geometry)|line]] is a generalised circle of infinite radius.\n\n==Inscription in or circumscription about other figures==\nIn every [[triangle]] a unique circle, called the [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle|incircle]], can be inscribed such that it is [[tangent]] to each of the three sides of the triangle.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Incircle.html Incircle \u2013 from Wolfram MathWorld] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121111333/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Incircle.html |date=2012-01-21 }}.

Mathworld.wolfram.com (2012-04-26). Retrieved on 2012-05-03.</ref> Every [[regular polygon]] and every triangle is a tangential polygon.\n\nA [[cyclic polygon]] is any convex polygon about which a [[circumcircle|circle can be circumscribed]], passing through each vertex. A well-studied example is the [[cyclic quadrilateral]]. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a cyclic polygon. A polygon that is both cyclic and tangential is called a [[bicentric polygon]].\n\nA [[hypocycloid]] is a curve that is inscribed in a given circle by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle that rolls within and tangent to the given circle.\n\n==Limiting case of other figures==\nThe circle can be viewed as a [[Limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of each of various other figures:\n* A [[Cartesian oval]] is a set of points such that a [[weighted sum]] of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points ([[Focus (geometry)|foci]]) is a constant. An [[ellipse]] is the case in which the weights are equal. A circle is an ellipse with an [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of zero, meaning that the two foci coincide with each other as the centre of the circle. A circle is also a different special case of a Cartesian oval in which one of the weights is zero.\n* A [[superellipse]] has an equation of the form <math>\\left|\\frac{x}{a}\\right|^n\\! + \\left|\\frac{y}{b}\\right|^n\\! = 1</math> for positive ''a'', ''b'', and ''n''. A supercircle has {{nowrap|''b'' {{=}} ''a''}}. A circle is the special case of a supercircle in which {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2}}.\n* A [[Cassini oval]] is a set of points such that the product of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points is a constant. When the two fixed points coincide, a circle results.\n* A [[curve of constant width]] is a figure whose width, defined as the perpendicular distance between two distinct parallel lines each intersecting its boundary in a single point, is the same regardless of the direction of those two parallel lines. The circle is the simplest example of this type of figure.\n\n==In other ''p''-norms==\n[[Image:Vector-p-Norms qtl1.svg|thumb|right|Illustrations of [[unit circle]]s (see also [[superellipse]]) in different {{math|''p''}}-norms (every vector from the origin to the unit circle has a length of one, the length being calculated with length-formula of the corresponding {{math|''p''}}).]]\nDefining a circle as the set of points with a fixed distance from a point, different shapes can be considered circles under different definitions of distance. In [[p-norm|''p''-norm]], distance is determined by\n:<math> \\left\\| x \\right\\| _p = \\left( |x_1|^p + |x_2|^p + \\dotsb + |x_n|^p \\right) ^{1/p} .</math>\nIn Euclidean geometry, ''p'' = 2, giving the familiar\n:<math> \\left\\| x \\right\\| _2 = \\sqrt{ |x_1|^2 + |x_2|^2 + \\dotsb + |x_n|^2 } .</math>\n\nIn [[taxicab geometry]], ''p'' = 1. Taxicab circles are [[square (geometry)|squares]] with sides oriented at a 45\u00b0 angle to the coordinate axes. While each side would have length <math>\\sqrt{2}r</math> using a [[Euclidean metric]], where ''r'' is the circle's radius, its length in taxicab geometry is 2''r''. Thus, a circle's circumference is 8''r''. Thus, the value of a geometric analog to [[Pi|<math>\\pi </math>]] is 4 in this geometry. The formula for the unit circle in taxicab geometry is <math>|x| + |y| = 1</math> in [[Cartesian coordinates]] and\n\n:<math>r = \\frac{1}{| \\sin \\theta| + |\\cos\\theta|}</math>\n\nin [[polar coordinates]].\n\nA circle of radius 1 (using this distance) is the [[von Neumann neighborhood]] of its center.\n\nA circle of radius ''r'' for the [[Chebyshev distance]] ([[Lp space|L<sub>\u221e</sub> metric]]) on a plane is also a square with side length 2''r'' parallel to the coordinate axes, so planar Chebyshev distance can be viewed as equivalent by rotation and scaling to planar taxicab distance. However, this equivalence between L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>\u221e</sub> metrics does not generalize to higher dimensions.\n\n==Squaring the circle==\n{{main|Squaring the circle}}\n\n[[Squaring the circle]] is the problem, proposed by [[classical antiquity|ancient]] [[geometers]], of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with [[compass and straightedge]].\n\nIn 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the [[Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem]], which proves that [[pi]] ({{pi}}) is a [[transcendental number]], rather than an [[algebraic number|algebraic irrational number]]; that is, it is not the [[root of a function|root]] of any [[polynomial]] with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients.\n\n==Significance in art and symbolism==\nFrom the time of the earliest known civilisations \u2013 such as the Assyrians and ancient Egyptians, those in the Indus Valley and along the Yellow River in China, and the Western civilisations of ancient Greece and Rome during classical Antiquity \u2013 the circle has been used directly or indirectly in visual art to convey the artist\u2019s message and to express certain ideas.\nHowever, differences in worldview (beliefs and culture) had a great impact on artists\u2019 perceptions. While some emphasised the circle\u2019s perimeter to demonstrate their democratic manifestation, others focused on its centre to symbolise the concept of cosmic unity. In mystical doctrines, the circle mainly symbolises the infinite and cyclical nature of existence, but in religious traditions it represents heavenly bodies and divine spirits.\nThe circle signifies many sacred and spiritual concepts, including unity, infinity, wholeness, the universe, divinity, balance, stability and perfection, among others. Such concepts have been conveyed in cultures worldwide through the use of symbols, for example, a compass, a halo, the vesica piscis and its derivatives (fish, eye, aureole, mandorla, etc.), the ouroboros, the Dharma wheel, a rainbow, mandalas, rose windows and so forth. <ref>Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Charnier, [https://books.google.com/books?id=J9PNwQEACAAJ&dq=the+louvre+abu+dhabi+a+world+vision+of+art&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjVucfTpqHmAhWNwqYKHeSBBcMQ6AEwAXoECAMQAgl \"The Circle from East to West\"], ''The Louvre Abu Dhabi: A World Vision of Art'', October 29, 2019</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Affine sphere]]\n* [[Annulus (mathematics)]]\n* [[Apeirogon]]\n* [[Circle fitting]]\n* [[List of circle topics]]\n* [[Sphere]]\n* [[Three points determine a circle]]\n* [[Translation of axes]]\n\n===Specially named circles===\n* [[Unit circle]]\n* [[Apollonian circles]]\n* [[Chromatic circle]]\n* [[Ford circle]]\n* [[Circle of antisimilitude]]\n* [[Carlyle circle]]\n* [[Bankoff circle]]\n* [[Archimedes' twin circles]]\n* [[Archimedean circle]]\n* [[Johnson circles]]\n* [[Schoch circles]]\n* [[Woo circles]]\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n====Of a triangle====\n* [[Mandart circle]]\n* [[Spieker circle]]\n* [[Nine-point circle]]\n* [[Lemoine circle]]\n* [[Circumcircle]]\n* [[Incircle]]\n* [[Excircle]]\n* [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle#Other excircle properties|Apollonius circle of the excircles]]\n* [[Lester circle]]\n* [[Malfatti circles]]\n* [[Brocard circle]]\n* [[Orthocentroidal circle]]\n* [[Van Lamoen circle]]\n* [[Parry circle]]\n* [[Polar circle (geometry)]]\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n====Of certain quadrilaterals====\n* [[Eight-point circle]] of an orthodiagonal quadrilateral\n* [[Tangential quadrilateral|Incircle of a tangential quadrilateral]]\n* [[Cyclic quadrilateral|Circumcircle of a cyclic quadrilateral]]\n\n====Of certain polygons====\n* [[Cyclic polygon|Circumcircle of a cyclic polygon]]\n* [[Tangential polygon|Incircle of a tangential polygon]]\n\n====Of a conic section====\n* [[Director circle]]\n* [[Directrix circle]]\n\n====Of a sphere====\n* [[Great circle]]\n* [[Riemannian circle]]\n\n====Of a torus====\n* [[Villarceau circles]]\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |author=Pedoe, Dan |title=Geometry: a comprehensive course |publisher=Dover |year=1988}}\n* [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Curves/Circle.html \"Circle\" in The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons and category|Circles|Circles}}\n{{wikiquote|Circles}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Circle}}\n* {{springer|title=Circle|id=p/c022260}}\n* [[planetmath:4236|Circle (PlanetMath.org website)]]\n* {{MathWorld |urlname=Circle |title=Circle}}\n* {{cite web| url = http://www.mathopenref.com/tocs/circlestoc.html   | title = Interactive Java applets | quote = for the properties of and elementary constructions involving circles}}\n* {{cite web| url = http://www.mathwarehouse.com/geometry/circle/interactive-circle-equation.php  | title = Interactive Standard Form Equation of Circle | quote = Click and drag points to see standard form equation in action}}\n* {{cite web| url = http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/Munching/circle.shtml  | title = Munching on Circles | quote =  [[cut-the-knot]]}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Circles| ]]\n[[Category:Elementary shapes]]\n[[Category:Curves]]\n[[Category:Conic sections]]\n[[Category:Pi]]\n", "name_user": "Comfr", "label": "safe", "comment": "+link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"}

Whilst at Grimsby he scored the winning [[golden goal]] in the 1998 [[Football League Trophy]] final. He also briefly played [[Premier League]] football for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and also played in [[the Football League]] for [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] and [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] as well as playing [[non-League football]] for [[Woking F.C.|Woking]], [[Grays Athletic F.C.|Grays Athletic]] and [[Fisher Athletic F.C.|Fisher Athletic]]. After retiring from football in 2004, Burnett went on to become manager with former clubs Grays and Fisher as well as a spell with [[Dulwich Hamlet F.C.|Dulwich Hamlet]] before returning to Leyton Orient as youth team manager.\n\n==Playing career==\nBurnett was born in [[Lambeth]], London and started out playing for [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] as a youngster, and represented England at youth level.<ref name=\"Hugman2002-03 65\"/> He soon earned himself a move to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], becoming one of [[Kenny Dalglish]]'s first signings but after a year with the Rovers he was transferred to [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] in 1993.\n\nIn 1995 Premiership newcomers [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] signed Burnett. But after only a season with the club he was sold to [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] following a short loan spell. His time in Yorkshire was a rather mixed one. He alternated between a deep-lying creative midfield role and that of a libero-style sweeper. Described as a flair player with much skill, he scored a wonder goal against Bradford City from just inside his own half in a League Cup tie, which proved to be his only goal for Huddersfield. At the time of his goal, the tie was balanced at 2\u20132 on aggregate. Burnett's goal in the 77th minute put Huddersfield through to the next round.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://skysports.stats.football365.com/1998/ENG/trn/ENGLC_1.html\n|title=Coca-Cola Cup 1997\u20131998 Season\n|publisher=Sky Sports\n|accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a clear out at Huddersfield, Burnett was loaned to [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] in 1998 and scored in his debut against [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] as the Mariners put their local rivals out of the [[Football League Trophy]].<ref name=\"WBAGTFCLegend\">{{cite web |url=http://www.grimsby-townfc.co.uk/news/article/wayne-burnett-a-gtfc-legend-2897792.aspx |publisher=Grimsby Town F.C. |title=Wayne Burnett - A GTFC Legend |date=12 January 2016 |accessdate=14 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt was in the same competition at [[Wembley Stadium]] against [[A.F.C.

Burnett was released by manager [[Paul Groves (footballer)|Paul Groves]] with the player sidelined for the majority of his time in his last season.\n\nBurnett dropped out of professional football and signed with [[Conference National]] club [[Woking F.C.|Woking]], but his time at his new club was short lived after a spat with the club's supporters. The incident happened in a Conference game in which Woking were trailing 2\u20130 with 20 minutes remaining. Burnett was brought on as a substitute but could not change the outcome of the game.

(U23's)\n}}\n'''Wayne Burnett''' (born 4 September 1971) is an English former [[Association football|footballer]] and manager of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] under-23's team.\n\nAs a player Burnett was a [[midfielder]] from 1989 until 2004 notably playing in [[the Football League]] for [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] and [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]]. Whilst at Grimsby he scored the winning [[golden goal]] in the 1998 [[Football League Trophy]] final. He also briefly played [[Premier League]] football for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and also played in [[the Football League]] for [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] and [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] as well as playing [[non-League football]] for [[Woking F.C.|Woking]], [[Grays Athletic F.C.|Grays Athletic]] and [[Fisher Athletic F.C.|Fisher Athletic]]. After retiring from football in 2004, Burnett went on to become manager with former clubs Grays and Fisher as well as a spell with [[Dulwich Hamlet F.C.|Dulwich Hamlet]] before returning to Leyton Orient as youth team manager.\n\n==Playing career==\nBurnett was born in [[Lambeth]], London and started out playing for [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] as a youngster, and represented England at youth level.<ref name=\"Hugman2002-03 65\"/> He soon earned himself a move to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], becoming one of [[Kenny Dalglish]]'s first signings but after a year with the Rovers he was transferred to [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] in 1993.\n\nIn 1995 Premiership newcomers [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] signed Burnett. But after only a season with the club he was sold to [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] following a short loan spell. His time in Yorkshire was a rather mixed one. He alternated between a deep-lying creative midfield role and that of a libero-style sweeper. Described as a flair player with much skill, he scored a wonder goal against Bradford City from just inside his own half in a League Cup tie, which proved to be his only goal for Huddersfield. At the time of his goal, the tie was balanced at 2\u20132 on aggregate. Burnett's goal in the 77th minute put Huddersfield through to the next round.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://skysports.stats.football365.com/1998/ENG/trn/ENGLC_1.html\n|title=Coca-Cola Cup 1997\u20131998 Season\n|publisher=Sky Sports\n|accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a clear out at Huddersfield, Burnett was loaned to [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] in 1998 and scored in his debut against [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] as the Mariners put their local rivals out of the [[Football League Trophy]].<ref name=\"WBAGTFCLegend\">{{cite web |url=http://www.grimsby-townfc.co.uk/news/article/wayne-burnett-a-gtfc-legend-2897792.aspx |publisher=Grimsby Town F.C. |title=Wayne Burnett - A GTFC Legend |date=12 January 2016 |accessdate=14 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt was in the same competition at [[Wembley Stadium]] against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] that Burnett scored the winning golden goal in the 1998 final and played in the promotion winning team in the play-off final a month later.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/99789.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Grimsby bounce back to Division 1 | date=24 May 1998 | accessdate=20 June 2015}}</ref> Burnett helped the Mariners to an impressive finish in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]], almost securing a play-off spot to the Premiership the following season.\n\nHe stayed with Grimsby until the summer of 2002, but was troubled by a persistent injury problem that made him miss chunks of the [[1999-2000 in English football|1999\u20132000]], [[2000-01 in English football|2000\u201301]] and [[2001-02 in English football|2001\u201302]] seasons. Burnett was released by manager [[Paul Groves (footballer)|Paul Groves]] with the player sidelined for the majority of his time in his last season.\n\nBurnett dropped out of professional football and signed with [[Conference National]] club [[Woking F.C.|Woking]], but his time at his new club was short lived after a spat with the club's supporters. The incident happened in a Conference game in which Woking were trailing 2\u20130 with 20 minutes remaining. Burnett was brought on as a substitute but could not change the outcome of the game. In a statement made to the ''[[Grimsby Telegraph]]'', Burnett claimed that Woking supporters had singled him out for abuse,<ref>[http://www.wokingfc.co.uk/news/article/1092/grays-athletic-v-woking/ Woking Football Club | News | GRAYS ATHLETIC v WOKING<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> stating that they expected him to come on and win the game for them because he was a professional footballer.
