The line was intended to protect Tunisia against an [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Italian]] invasion from its colony in [[Libya]]. The line occupied a point where the routes into Tunisia from the south converged, leading toward Mareth, with the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the east and mountains and a sand sea to the west.\n\nThe line ran along the north side of Wadi Zigzaou for about {{cvt|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} south-westwards from the [[Gulf of Gab\u00e8s]] to Cheguimi and the Djebel (mountain) Matmata on the Dahar plateau between the [[Grand Erg Oriental]] (Great Eastern Sand Sea) and the [[Matmata, Tunisia|Matmata]] hills. The [[Tebaga Gap]], between the Mareth line and the Great Eastern Sand Sea, a potential route by which an invader could outflank the Mareth line, was not surveyed until 1938.\n\nAfter the French [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]], the Mareth Line was demilitarised under the supervision of an Italo-German commission. Tunisia was occupied by [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces after [[Operation Torch]] in 1942 and the line was refurbished and extended by Axis engineers into a defensive position by building more defences between the line and Wadi Zeuss {{cvt|3.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south but French-built anti-tank gun positions were too small for Axis anti-tank guns which had to be sited elsewhere.\n\nThe [Battle of Medenine]] (6 March 1943) against the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] was a costly failure. At the [[Battle of the Mareth Line]] (16\u201331 March 1943) the Eighth Army was contained within the Mareth Line defences. An outflanking move west and north of the Mareth Line was followed by Operation Supercharge II which broke through the Axis defences of the [[Tebaga Gap]] and led them to retreat from the Mareth Line to [[Battle of Wadi Akarit|Wadi Akarit]]. Since 1943 the Mareth Line has become derelict and is commemorated at the [[Mareth Museum]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===French strategy===\nIn 1930s the defence of the [[French colonial empire]] (French Indochina, Pacific Islands, West Indies, African colonies and Syria\u2013Lebanon) was left to the [[French Foreign Legion]], colonial and \"native\" units, the {{lang|fr|[[Marine nationale]]}} (Navy) and the {{lang|fr|[[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]}} (Air Force). By the late 1930s, the Navy had only one aircraft carrier and the {{lang|fr|Arm\u00e9e de l'Air}} could spare only second-rate aircraft. [[French Algeria|Algeria]], [[French Protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]] and Tunisia provided much of the manpower of the {{lang|fr|[[Troupes coloniales|Arm\u00e9e coloniale]]}} and Tunisia, with the Italian colony of [[Italian Libya|Libya]] to the east, was excepted from the priority given to the defence of metropolitan France.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaufmann|1a2=Kaufmann|1y=2006|1p=89|2a1=Jackson|2y=2000|2pp=332\u2013333}}\n\nFrench plans for defence of Tunisia assumed that Italy would launch an overwhelming assault that France could not easily oppose. Italy was expected to launch attacks on [[Egypt]] and Tunisia as soon as war was declared, with the Italian Navy securing supply and blocking any substantial Anglo-French relief. With a force of six divisions, a fortress division and a cavalry division to defend Tunisia, the French army considered the construction of a \"[[Maginot Line]] in the desert\" ({{lang|fr|ligne Maginot du d\u00e9sert}}).{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=92}}\n\n===Geography===\n\nCentral Tunisia is dominated by the [[Atlas Mountains]], while the northern and southern portions are largely flat. The primary feature in the south is the Matmata Hills, a range running north-south roughly parallel to the Mediterranean coast. West of the hills, the land is the inhospitable [[Jebel Dahar]] and the Dehar region of desert beyond to the west, making the region between the hills and the coast the only easily traversed approach to northern Tunisia.{{sfn|Ford|2012|p=46}} A smaller line of hills runs east\u2013west along the northern edge of the Matmata range, further complicating this approach. At the far northern end of the Matmata Hills is the [[Tebaga Gap]]. From the Mediterranean the coastal plain rises gently to the Matmata Hills. The plain consists of gravels and sands, with salt flats between the sandy areas, which turn into bogs after light rain becoming impassable to wheeled vehicles. There are numerous wadis from the hills to the sea, including the bigger Wadi Zeuss and Wadi Zigzaou. Inland, the sources of the whe wadis are steep and rocky, widening near the coast, the beds having streams or muddy bottoms, with firmer areas traversable by vehicles.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=332}}\n\n===Plans===\n\n[[File:Tunisia Topography.png|thumb|upright=.75|{{center|Topographic map of Tunisia}}]]\nIn January 1934 planning began on the new fortifications; Infantry officers selected the sites for strongpoints to dominate the ground in front with overlapping fields of fire. In 1936, the French government provided funds for construction after Italy formed the [[Axis powers|Rome\u2013Berlin Axis]] with Germany, creating a greater threat to French security in North Africa.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}{{efn|The cost of the Mareth Line and its forward defences was similar to that of {{lang|fr|ouvrage of St Agnes}} in the Alps.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}}} The casemates designed for the line had much less concrete than comparable examples in France and had no {{lang|fr|[[wkt:fosse|foss\u00e9]]}} (gap) rather a stable door, in case the lower part was blocked by d\u00e9bris. In September 1936, during a meeting with General [[Alphonse Joseph Georges|Joseph Georges]], it was agreed that the fortification of the Mareth Line, Bizerte, Medenine, Ben Gardane and Foum Tathouine must be completed.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\nMedenine, Ben Gardane to the west and Foum Tathouine to the east, were south of the proposed line, Foum Tathouine being the place where the routes to Mareth passed through the bottleneck between the Matmata Mountains and the sea. The line was divided into eastern and western sectors with a main line of resistance and a reserve line about {{cvt|1.5|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} back. A {{lang|fr|secteur d\u00e9fensif}} (SD) was to be built on the rocky Dahar Plateau, which later became part of an SD across the Matmata Hills to [[Kebili]] on the edge of the [[Chott el Djerid]]. The chott and Chott El Fedjaj drained across Tunisia into Wadi Akarit, across Tunisia but Wadi Akarit was only sketchily fortified, the French concentrating on the Mareth Line {{cvt|50|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} south, to cover Gabes.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}} The gap between the Mareth Line and the Great Eastern Sand Sea, a potential route by which an invader could outflank the Mareth line, was not given consideration until 1938. General [[Georges Catroux]] and Colonel Gautsch surveyed the area and in their assessment predicted that three divisions could advance from the Libyan border to Ksar (fortified village) el Hallouf and Bir (well) Soltane in six days and then advance into the gaps either side of Djebel Melab and those between Djebel Tebaga and the Matmata Hills. {{sfnm|1a1=Kaufmann|1a2=Kaufmann|1y=2006|1p=89|2a1=Playfair|2y=2004|2p=333}}\n\n==The Mareth Line==\n\n[[File:Mareth Line Panel.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Mareth Line Panel}}]]\nThe Mareth Line consisted of casemates surrounded by barbed wire and built for all-round defence in the main and reserve lines, the obstacles being doubled on the fronts and sides. The strongpoints in the main line included flanking machine-gun casemates and anti-tank gun positions; in the reserve line artillery emplacements provided covering fire in the gaps between the strongpoints in the main line. Some of the flanking casemates for machine-guns covering the gaps were connected by galleries; strongpoints on the plain and in hills had anti-tank positions. An anti-tank obstacle of vertical rails was built along the front of the line and the sides of Wadi Zigzaou were steepened. Eight artillery casemates, forty infantry casemates or blockhouses and fifteen command posts were built. The eastern sector had twelve strongpoints in the main line and eleven in the reserve line. The western sector had eleven strongpoints in the main line and seven in the reserve line.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\nIn the Matmata hills, Ksar el Hallouf covered an anti-tank ditch which continued the position beyond the main line which ended on the foothills. An infantry position was dug into the Matmata hills at Ksar-el-Hallouf and in the Dahar beyond, a strongpoint at Bir Soltane had two 75 mm turrets, removed from [[Char 2C]] tanks built in 1918. At Ben Gardane an advanced position was built consisting of a square redoubt inside an anti-tank ditch with casemates on the flanks and concrete infantry shelters. Small triangular strongpoints at the corners were surrounded by anti-tank rail obstacles that continued around the position. The Mareth line was equipped with obsolescent 47 mm naval guns for anti-tank defence and some new [[25 mm Hotchkiss anti-tank gun|25 mm anti-tank guns]] and infantry small-arms. The artillery casemates with 75 mm guns and most of the blockhouses and casemates had embrasures for automatic weapons. In 1938 work the Mareth line was so important that work on coast defences was stopped and in 1939 the line was occupied by colonial divisions and some locally-raised units. After the outbreak of the war, a line of advanced positions ({{lang|fr|avant-postes}}) was built on high ground at Aram {{cvt|10|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} south of the main line.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\n==Second World War==\n\n===Demilitarisation 1940, Axis occupation 1943===\n\nThe [[Second World War]] began in 1939 but the Mareth Line was inactive from  1939 to 1940, as Italy remained neutral until a few days before the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]], after which, the line was demilitarised by an Italo-German commission. In November 1942, the British [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] ([[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]]) defeated {{lang|de|[[Panzer Army Africa|Panzerarmee Afrika]]}} at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] and the British [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] landed in French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]]. Axis forces occupied Tunisia in the [[Tunisia Campaign]] and from November 1942 to March 1943, the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} conducted a fighting retreat through Egypt and Libya, pursued by the Eighth Army. In March the Eighth Army reached the Libya\u2013Tunisia border and paused at Medenine to prepare to attack the Mareth Line. Axis engineers built an outpost zone from Wadi Zeuss {{cvt|3.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} back to the Mareth Line. Field fortifications were constructed at Sidi el Guelaa, south of Aram on the main road from Medinine to Mareth, around Aram and at Bahira. The Mareth Line was refurbished for occupation by the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} and by March 1943, more than {{convert|100|km|mi|order=flip}} of [[barbed wire]], 100,000 anti-tank mines and 70,000 anti-personnel mines had been laid, bunkers had been reinforced with concrete and armed with anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=334}} \n\n===Medenine and Mareth===\n\n{{main|Battle of Mareth}}\n\nThe Axis forces opposing the Eighth Army were renamed the [[First Army (Italy)|Italian 1st Army]] (General [[Giovanni Messe]]) on 23 February 1943 and attempted a spoiling attack, the Battle of Medenine ({{lang|de|Unternehmen Capri}}, Operation Capri). The attack was a costly failure and the Axis troops withdrew to the Mareth Line to await the British attack.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=324}} The Mareth Line was garrisoned by the [[136th Infantry Division Giovani Fascisti|136th Infantry Division \"Giovani Fascisti\"]] from the coast to Zarat, the [[101st Motorised Division Trieste|101st Motorised Division \"Trieste\"]] around Mareth and Aram, the [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light Division]] to the south of the \"Trieste\" Division, [[80th Infantry Division La Spezia (Airlanding)|80th Infantry Division \"La Spezia\"]] south of the 90th Light Division, [[16th Motorised Division Pistoia|16th Motorised Division \"Pistoia\"]] south of \"La Spezia\", the [[164th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|164th Light ''Afrika'' Division]] around Beni Kreddache and the [[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] with 32 operational tanks at Zerkine {{cvt|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} north-west of Mareth. In reserve were the [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Division]] south-west of Gab\u00e8s and the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] south-west of [[Sousse]] with 110 operational tanks. The line from Djebel Tebaga to Djebel Melab was held by the {{lang|it|Raggruppamento Sahariano}}.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=333}}{{efn|The {{lang|it|Raggruppamento Sahariano}} consisted of two battalions of Infantry Regiment 350, threee companies of the Novara Group, a Frontier Guard battalion, a battalion from the  \"Savona\" Division, a machine-gun battalion, four Saharan companies and nine troops of artillery.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=333}}}} The British survey of the Mareth Line, the positions of [[Zarat, Tunisia|Zarat]] sudest (Zaret South-West), Ouerzi, Ouerzi Ouest (Ouerzi West), Ouerzi Est (Ouerzi East), Ksiba Ouest and Ksiba Est being of particular interest, was assisted by General Marcel Rime-Bruneau, a former Chief of Staff of the Tunisian garrison and Captain Paul Mezan, the former Garrison Engineer of the Mareth Line.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=332}}\n\n===Battle of the Mareth Line===\n\n{{Main article|Battle of the Mareth Line}}\n\n[[File:Mareth line object.jpg|thumb|{{center|Infantry bunker of the Mareth Line}}]]\nOn 19 March 1943, the Eighth Army made a frontal assault against the Mareth Line in Operation Pugilist. The [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division|50th Northumbrian Infantry Division]] penetrated the Line near Zarat but was driven back by the [[33rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] and the{{lang|it|\"Giovani Fascisti\"}} on 22 March.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=362\u2013363}} Reconnaissance by the [[Long Range Desert Group]] had shown that the line could be outflanked. A force could pass through the southern Matmata Hills, reach the Tebaga Gap from the west and reach the coastal plain behind the Mareth Line. During Pugilist, Montgomery had sent the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] around the Matmata Hills but its attack was contained at the Tebaga Gap from 21 to 24 March. Montgomery sent the [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Armoured Division]] ([[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]]) to reinforce the attack at the Tebaga Gap. The British attacked again in [[Battle of the Mareth Line#Operation Supercharge II|Operation Supercharge II]] on 26 March and broke through the gap the next day. This success, combined with another frontal assault on the Mareth Line, made the position untenable; the Italian 1st Army escaped encirclement when the 1st Armoured Division was held up at El Hamma and the Axis forces retreated to [[Wadi Akarit]], {{convert|60|km|mi|order=flip}} to the north.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=337\u2013351}}\n\n==Post war==\nAfter the Battle of the Mareth Line, the defences were left to become derelict and are commemorated at the [[Mareth Museum]] at Gab\u00e8s.{{sfn|TT|2020|nopp=y}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to World War II |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2001 |editor-first=I.

With a force of six divisions, a fortress division and a cavalry division to defend Tunisia, the French army considered the construction of a \"[[Maginot Line]] in the desert\" ({{lang|fr|ligne Maginot du d\u00e9sert}}).{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=92}}\n\n===Geography===\n\nCentral Tunisia is dominated by the [[Atlas Mountains]], while the northern and southern portions are largely flat. The primary feature in the south is the Matmata Hills, a range running north-south roughly parallel to the Mediterranean coast. West of the hills, the land is the inhospitable [[Jebel Dahar]] and the Dehar region of desert beyond to the west, making the region between the hills and the coast the only easily traversed approach to northern Tunisia.{{sfn|Ford|2012|p=46}} A smaller line of hills runs east\u2013west along the northern edge of the Matmata range, further complicating this approach. At the far northern end of the Matmata Hills is the [[Tebaga Gap]]. From the Mediterranean the coastal plain rises gently to the Matmata Hills. The plain consists of gravels and sands, with salt flats between the sandy areas, which turn into bogs after light rain becoming impassable to wheeled vehicles. There are numerous wadis from the hills to the sea, including the bigger Wadi Zeuss and Wadi Zigzaou. Inland, the sources of the whe wadis are steep and rocky, widening near the coast, the beds having streams or muddy bottoms, with firmer areas traversable by vehicles.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=332}}\n\n===Plans===\n\n[[File:Tunisia Topography.png|thumb|upright=.75|{{center|Topographic map of Tunisia}}]]\nIn January 1934 planning began on the new fortifications; Infantry officers selected the sites for strongpoints to dominate the ground in front with overlapping fields of fire. In 1936, the French government provided funds for construction after Italy formed the [[Axis powers|Rome\u2013Berlin Axis]] with Germany, creating a greater threat to French security in North Africa.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}{{efn|The cost of the Mareth Line and its forward defences was similar to that of {{lang|fr|ouvrage of St Agnes}} in the Alps.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}}} The casemates designed for the line had much less concrete than comparable examples in France and had no {{lang|fr|[[wkt:fosse|foss\u00e9]]}} (gap) rather a stable door, in case the lower part was blocked by d\u00e9bris. In September 1936, during a meeting with General [[Alphonse Joseph Georges|Joseph Georges]], it was agreed that the fortification of the Mareth Line, Bizerte, Medenine, Ben Gardane and Foum Tathouine must be completed.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\nMedenine, Ben Gardane to the west and Foum Tathouine to the east, were south of the proposed line, Foum Tathouine being the place where the routes to Mareth passed through the bottleneck between the Matmata Mountains and the sea. The line was divided into eastern and western sectors with a main line of resistance and a reserve line about {{cvt|1.5|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} back. A {{lang|fr|secteur d\u00e9fensif}} (SD) was to be built on the rocky Dahar Plateau, which later became part of an SD across the Matmata Hills to [[Kebili]] on the edge of the [[Chott el Djerid]]. The chott and Chott El Fedjaj drained across Tunisia into Wadi Akarit, across Tunisia but Wadi Akarit was only sketchily fortified, the French concentrating on the Mareth Line {{cvt|50|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} south, to cover Gabes.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}} The gap between the Mareth Line and the Great Eastern Sand Sea, a potential route by which an invader could outflank the Mareth line, was not given consideration until 1938. General [[Georges Catroux]] and Colonel Gautsch surveyed the area and in their assessment predicted that three divisions could advance from the Libyan border to Ksar (fortified village) el Hallouf and Bir (well) Soltane in six days and then advance into the gaps either side of Djebel Melab and those between Djebel Tebaga and the Matmata Hills. {{sfnm|1a1=Kaufmann|1a2=Kaufmann|1y=2006|1p=89|2a1=Playfair|2y=2004|2p=333}}\n\n==The Mareth Line==\n\n[[File:Mareth Line Panel.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Mareth Line Panel}}]]\nThe Mareth Line consisted of casemates surrounded by barbed wire and built for all-round defence in the main and reserve lines, the obstacles being doubled on the fronts and sides. The strongpoints in the main line included flanking machine-gun casemates and anti-tank gun positions; in the reserve line artillery emplacements provided covering fire in the gaps between the strongpoints in the main line. Some of the flanking casemates for machine-guns covering the gaps were connected by galleries; strongpoints on the plain and in hills had anti-tank positions. An anti-tank obstacle of vertical rails was built along the front of the line and the sides of Wadi Zigzaou were steepened. Eight artillery casemates, forty infantry casemates or blockhouses and fifteen command posts were built. The eastern sector had twelve strongpoints in the main line and eleven in the reserve line. The western sector had eleven strongpoints in the main line and seven in the reserve line.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\nIn the Matmata hills, Ksar el Hallouf covered an anti-tank ditch which continued the position beyond the main line which ended on the foothills. An infantry position was dug into the Matmata hills at Ksar-el-Hallouf and in the Dahar beyond, a strongpoint at Bir Soltane had two 75 mm turrets, removed from [[Char 2C]] tanks built in 1918. At Ben Gardane an advanced position was built consisting of a square redoubt inside an anti-tank ditch with casemates on the flanks and concrete infantry shelters. Small triangular strongpoints at the corners were surrounded by anti-tank rail obstacles that continued around the position. The Mareth line was equipped with obsolescent 47 mm naval guns for anti-tank defence and some new [[25 mm Hotchkiss anti-tank gun|25 mm anti-tank guns]] and infantry small-arms. The artillery casemates with 75 mm guns and most of the blockhouses and casemates had embrasures for automatic weapons. In 1938 work the Mareth line was so important that work on coast defences was stopped and in 1939 the line was occupied by colonial divisions and some locally-raised units. After the outbreak of the war, a line of advanced positions ({{lang|fr|avant-postes}}) was built on high ground at Aram {{cvt|10|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} south of the main line.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\n==Second World War==\n\n===Demilitarisation 1940, Axis occupation 1943===\n\n\nThe [[Second World War]] began in 1939 but the Mareth Line was inactive from  1939 to 1940, as Italy remained neutral until a few days before the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]], after which, the line was demilitarised by an Italo-German commission. In November 1942, the British [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] ([[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]]) defeated {{lang|de|[[Panzer Army Africa|Panzerarmee Afrika]]}} at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] and the British [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] landed in French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]]. Axis forces occupied Tunisia in the [[Tunisia Campaign]] and from November 1942 to March 1943, the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} conducted a fighting retreat through Egypt and Libya, pursued by the Eighth Army. In March the Eighth Army reached the Libya\u2013Tunisia border and paused at Medenine to prepare to attack the Mareth Line. Axis engineers built an outpost zone from Wadi Zeuss {{cvt|3.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} back to the Mareth Line. Field fortifications were constructed at Sidi el Guelaa, south of Aram on the main road from Medinine to Mareth, around Aram and at Bahira. The Mareth Line was refurbished for occupation by the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} and by March 1943, more than {{convert|100|km|mi|order=flip}} of [[barbed wire]], 100,000 anti-tank mines and 70,000 anti-personnel mines had been laid, bunkers had been reinforced with concrete and armed with anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=334}}  \n\n===Medenine and Mareth===\n\n{{main|Battle of Mareth}} \n\nThe Axis forces opposing the Eighth Army were renamed the [[First Army (Italy)|Italian 1st Army]] (General [[Giovanni Messe]]) on 23 February 1943 and attempted a spoiling attack, the Battle of Medenine ({{lang|de|Unternehmen Capri}}, Operation Capri). The attack was a costly failure and the Axis troops withdrew to the Mareth Line to await the British attack.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=324}} The Mareth Line was garrisoned by the [[136th Infantry Division Giovani Fascisti|136th Infantry Division \"Giovani Fascisti\"]] from the coast to Zarat, the [[101st Motorised Division Trieste|101st Motorised Division \"Trieste\"]] around Mareth and Aram, the [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light Division]] to the south of the \"Trieste\" Division, [[80th Infantry Division La Spezia (Airlanding)|80th Infantry Division \"La Spezia\"]] south of the 90th Light Division, [[16th Motorised Division Pistoia|16th Motorised Division \"Pistoia\"]] south of \"La Spezia\", the [[164th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|164th Light ''Afrika'' Division]] around Beni Kreddache and the [[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] with 32 operational tanks at Zerkine {{cvt|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} north-west of Mareth. In reserve were the [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Division]] south-west of Gab\u00e8s and the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] south-west of [[Sousse]] with 110 operational tanks. The line from Djebel Tebaga to Djebel Melab was held by the {{lang|it|Raggruppamento Sahariano}}.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=333}}{{efn|The {{lang|it|Raggruppamento Sahariano}} consisted of two battalions of Infantry Regiment 350, threee companies of the Novara Group, a Frontier Guard battalion, a battalion from the  \"Savona\" Division, a machine-gun battalion, four Saharan companies and nine troops of artillery.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=333}}}} The British survey of the Mareth Line, the positions of [[Zarat, Tunisia|Zarat]] sudest (Zaret South-West), Ouerzi, Ouerzi Ouest (Ouerzi West), Ouerzi Est (Ouerzi East), Ksiba Ouest and Ksiba Est being of particular interest, was assisted by General Marcel Rime-Bruneau, a former Chief of Staff of the Tunisian garrison and Captain Paul Mezan, the former Garrison Engineer of the Mareth Line.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=332}}\n\n===Battle of the Mareth Line===\n\n{{Main article|Battle of the Mareth Line}}\n\n[[File:Mareth line object.jpg|thumb|{{center|Infantry bunker of the Mareth Line}}]]\nOn 19 March 1943, the Eighth Army made a frontal assault against the Mareth Line in Operation Pugilist. The [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division|50th Northumbrian Infantry Division]] penetrated the Line near Zarat but was driven back by the [[33rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] and the{{lang|it|\"Giovani Fascisti\"}} on 22 March.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=362\u2013363}} Reconnaissance by the [[Long Range Desert Group]] had shown that the line could be outflanked. A force could pass through the southern Matmata Hills, reach the Tebaga Gap from the west and reach the coastal plain behind the Mareth Line. During Pugilist, Montgomery had sent the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] around the Matmata Hills but its attack was contained at the Tebaga Gap from 21 to 24 March. Montgomery sent the [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Armoured Division]] ([[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]]) to reinforce the attack at the Tebaga Gap. The British attacked again in [[Battle of the Mareth Line#Operation Supercharge II|Operation Supercharge II]] on 26 March and broke through the gap the next day. This success, combined with another frontal assault on the Mareth Line, made the position untenable; the Italian 1st Army escaped encirclement when the 1st Armoured Division was held up at El Hamma and the Axis forces retreated to [[Wadi Akarit]], {{convert|60|km|mi|order=flip}} to the north.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=337\u2013351}}\n\n==Post war==\nAfter the Battle of the Mareth Line, the defences were left to become derelict and are commemorated at the [[Mareth Museum]] at Gab\u00e8s.{{sfn|TT|2020|nopp=y}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to World War II |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2001 |editor-first=I.

They are slightly smaller and have less pronounced pigments, as well as less developed limbs and ocelli than the atmobiotic species. Hemiedaphic species inhabit the lower litter layers of decomposing organic material. They are 1-2 millimeters in length, have dispersed pigmentation, shortened limbs, and a reduced number of ocelli. Euedaphic species inhabit upper mineral layers known as the humus horizon.

The midgut is surrounded by a network of muscles and lined with a monolayer of columnar or cuboidal cells. Its function is to mix and transport food from the lumen into the hindgut through contraction. Many species of syntrophic bacteria, archaea, and fungi are present in the lumen. These different digestive regions have varying pH to support specific enzymatic activities and microbial populations. The anterior portion of the midgut and hindgut is slightly acidic (with a pH of approximately 6.0) while the posterior midgut portion is slightly alkaline (with a pH of approximately 8.0). Between the midgut and hindgut is an alimentary canal called the pyloric region, which is a muscular sphincter.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Systematics and evolution ==\n[[File:Allacma fusca on rotting wood.ogv|thumb|''Allacma fusca'' ([[Symphypleona]]) on rotting wood]]\nTraditionally, the springtails were divided into the [[order (biology)|orders]] [[Arthropleona]], [[Symphypleona]], and occasionally also [[Neelipleona]].

The move was aimed at protecting Bermuda's reputation as a jurisdiction.<ref name=RoyalGazette09052008/> Bermuda also received around $22.5&nbsp;million as its share of $45&nbsp;million confiscated on 1 May 2008 from IPOC International Growth Fund in a criminal prosecution in the British Virgin Islands, where three IPOC-owned companies were domiciled.<ref name=RoyalGazette09052008/>\n\nIn July 2007, Altimo, which is owned by Mikhail Fridman's Alfa Group, won in its dispute with the IPOC International Growth Fund and received ownership of the 25.1% stake in MegaFon which was formerly owned by LV Finance.<ref name=Cision12022008>{{cite news |url=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/interview-with-altimo-ceo-alexey-reznikovich-published-on-dow-jones-535239991.html |title=Interview With Altimo CEO, Alexey Reznikovich |work=Cision |via=Dow Jones Newswires |location=[[Barcelona]] |last= |first= |date=12 February 2008 |access-date=18 March 2020 |archive-date=29 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629214846/https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/interview-with-altimo-ceo-alexey-reznikovich-published-on-dow-jones-535239991.html}}</ref><ref name=Middleton30072007>{{cite news |url=https://telecoms.com/320/altimo-vs-ipoc-its-all-over/ |title=Altimo vs. Ipoc: it\u2019s all over |work=telecom.com |last=Middleton |first=James |date=30 July 2007 |access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref> Both Altimo and IPOC International Growth Fund jointly decided to \"end all court actions and end legal claims against each other.\"<ref name=Duplicity/><ref name=Buckley30072007>{{cite news |url= |title=The Rise and Fall of IPOC |work=[[Financial Times]] |last=Buckley |first=L. |date=30 July 2007}}</ref><ref name=Reuters30112007>{{cite news |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/altimo-megafon/russias-altimo-says-megafon-dispute-resolved-idUKL3089982120071130 |title=Russia's Altimo says MegaFon dispute resolved |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=30 November 2007 |access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref> At that time, IPOC through its holdings in TeleComInvest held a 39.3% share of MegaFon and Alfa Group through Altimo held a 25.1% stake in MegaFon.<ref name=Middleton30072007/>\n\n==Other work==\nGalmond has also worked as a lawyer for companies associated with [[J\u00f3n \u00c1sgeir J\u00f3hannesson]]'s Icelandic conglomerate [[Baugur Group]].<ref name=Berlingske23062005>{{cite news |url=https://www.berlingske.dk/business/236-05-diskret-dansk-advokat-milliardaer |title=Diskret dansk advokat milliard\u00e6r: Den omstridte danske advokat i Rusland, J.P.

Cattle and sheep were more important in ritual sacrifices than in diet, suggesting that a new set of cults and rituals had spread eastward across the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe|Pontic-Caspian steppes]], with domesticated animals at the root of the proto-Indo-European conception of the universe.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=185\u2013186}} Anthony attributed the first and progressive domestication of horses, from taming to actually working with the animal, to that period. According to him, the Anatolian distinctive sub-family came from a first migration that established the Suvorovo culture (4500\u20134100) in the eastern Balkans, in the context of a progression of the Khvalynsk culture towards the [[Danube]], from which also emerged the Novodanilovka (4400\u20133800) and [[Sredny Stog culture|Late Sredny Stog]] (4000\u20133500) cultures.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=185\u2013186}} Copper, exotic ornamental shells and polished stone maces were exchanged across the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppes from [[Varna]], in the eastern Balkans, to Khvalynsk between 4500\u20134200 BCE.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|first=David W.|date=2019|title=Archaeology, Genetics, and Language in the Steppes: A Comment on Bomhard|url=https://www.academia.edu/39985565|journal=Journal of Indo-European Studies|language=en|volume=47|issue=1/2|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Late Khvalynsk/Repin (3900\u20133300) ===\nSteppe economies underwent a revolutionary change between 4200\u20133300 BCE, in a shift from a partial reliance on herding, when domesticated animals probably were used principally as a ritual currency for public sacrifices, to a later regular dietary dependence on cattle, and either sheep or goat meat and dairy products.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015|pp=}} The Late Khvalynsk and Repin cultures (3900\u20133300), associated with early (post-[[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]]) Proto-Indo-European, showed the first traces of cereal cultivation after 4000 BC, in the context of a slow and partial diffusion of farming from the Western parts of the steppes.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=304}} Around 3700\u20133300, a second migration wave of [[Tocharian languages|proto-Tocharian]] speakers towards [[South Siberia]] led to the [[Afanasievo culture]] (3300\u20132500).{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=264\u2013265, 308}}<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=lr62GwAACAAJ|title=The Tarim Mummies: Ancient China and the Mystery of the Earliest Peoples from the West|last=Mallory|first=J.

Yamnaya herders likely watched over their cattle and raided on horseback, while driving wagons for the bulk transport of water or food.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=330\u2013335}} Their chiefdoms had institutionalized differences in prestige and power, and the society was organized along patron-client reciprocity, a mutual exchange of gifts and favors between their patrons, the gods, and human clients.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=99}} The Yamnaya funeral sacrifice of wagons, carts, sheep, cattle, and horse was probably related to a cult of ancestors requiring specific rituals and prayers, a connection between language and cult that introduced late Proto-Indo-European to new speakers.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=304}} The language itself appeared as a [[Dialect continuum|dialectal continuum]] during this period.{{sfn|Bomhard|2019|p=3}} Proto-Indo-European likely ceased to be spoken after 2500 BC, as its various dialects were already distinct languages that spread across western Eurasia during the third wave of [[Indo-European migrations]],{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=51}} which had begun with the expansion of Usatovo people (associated with pre-[[Germanic languages|Germanic]]) towards southeastern Poland through the [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old European]] [[Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture|Tripolye culture]] around 3300 BCE, and with the migration of pre-[[Italo-Celtic]] speakers towards the [[Pannonian Basin]] in Central Europe around 3100\u20132800 BCE.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015|pp=}}{{sfn|Bomhard|2019|p=3}}\n\n== Social structure ==\n\n=== Class structure ===\nIt is generally agreed that Proto-Indo-European society was hierarchical, with some form of social ranking and various degrees of social status.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=17\u201319}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=336}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=284\u2013285}} It is unlikely however that they had a rigidly stratified structure, or [[Caste system in India|castes]] such as are found in historical India.{{Sfn|Della Volpe|1993|p=}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=430}} Some [[kurgan]] graves, larger than the average and necessitating a considerable number of people to be built, suggest a higher status given to some individuals, although this prestigious funeral was not necessarily reserved to the wealthiest person. Smiths in particular were given sumptuous graves, possibly due to the association of smithery to magic during the [[Bronze Age|early Bronze Age]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=336}} In general, such graves were mostly occupied by males in the eastern Don-Volga steppes, while they were more egalitarian in the western Dnieper-Donets region.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=331\u2013334}} There was a general distinction between free persons and slaves, typically prisoners of war or debtors unable to repay a debt.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=17}} The free part of society was composed of an elite class of priests, kings and warriors, along with the commoners,{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=17}} with each tribe following a chief (''*wi\u1e31pots'') sponsoring feasts and ceremonies and who was eventually immortalized in praise poetry.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=336}}[[File:Yamna03.jpg|thumb|215.994x215.994px|Yamnaya bone and canine ornaments.]]\n=== Kinship ===\nLinguistics has allowed for the reliable reconstruction of a large number of words relating to kinship relations. These all agree in exhibiting a [[patriarchal]], [[patrilocal]] and [[patrilineal]] social fabric.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=17\u201319}} Patrilocality is confirmed by lexical evidence, including the word *''{{PIE|h<sub>2</sub>u\u032fedh}}''-, \"to lead (away)\", being the word that denotes a male wedding a female, but not vice-versa.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=483}} Rights, possessions, and responsibilities were consequently reckoned to the father, and wives were to reside after marriage near the husband's family, after the payment of a bride-price.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=328}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}}\n\nThe *''dems-potis'' was the patriarch, the master of the household ({{PIE|''*domos''}}).{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}} Once established, the family lasted as long as the male stock of its founder endured, and clan or tribal founders were often portrayed as mythical beings stemming from a mythical past in Indo-European traditions.{{Sfn|Della Volpe|1993|p=}} In this form of kinship organization, the individual's genetic distance from the clan's founding ancestor determined his social status. But if he was able of exceptional prowess or virtue, the same individual could in his turn gain social prestige among the community and eventually found his own descent-group.{{Sfn|Della Volpe|1993|p=}} \n\nIn the reconstructed lexicon linking the individual to the clan, ''*h\u2084er\u00f3s'' meant a \"member of one\u2019s own group\", \"one who belongs to the community in contrast to an outsider\", which would give the Indo-Iranian term ''[[Aryan|\u00e1rya]]'' (an [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]]) and the Irish ''aire'' (\"noble, chief\").{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=209}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}} It is unlikely however that the word had an ethnic connotation, and we do not known if Proto-Indo-European speakers had a term to designate themselves as a group.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}} Another term, *''h\u2081leudhos'', meant \"people\", \"freemen\" in a more general way.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}}\n\n=== Patron-client ===\nProto-Indo-European had several words for \"leader\": *''tag\u00f3s'' was a general term derived from ''*t\u0101\u0306g-'' (\"set in place, arrange\"); *''h\u2083r\u1e17\u01f5s'' meant a ruler who also had religious functions, with the Roman [[Rex Sacrorum|rex sacrorum]] (\"king of the sacred\") as an heritage of the priestly function of the king; *''w(n\u0329)n\u00e1kts'' designated a \"lord\" and possessed a feminine equivalent,''*wn\u00e1ktih\u2090'' (a \"queen\"); while the ''*wi\u1e31pots'' (or ''*wi\u1e31-potis'') was the chief of the settlement ({{PIE|''*wei\u1e31s''}}),{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}} the seat of a tribe, clan or family.{{sfn|Beekes|2011|p=35}}\n\nPublic feasts sponsored by such patrons were a way for them to promote and secure a political hierarchy built on the unequal mobilization of labor and resources, by displaying their generosity towards the rest of the community. Rivals competed publicly through the size and complexity of their feasts, and alliances were confirmed by gift-giving and promises made during those public gatherings. The host of the feast was called the *''ghosti''-''potis'', the \"lord of the guests\", who honored the immortal gods and his mortal guests with gifts of food, drink, and poetry.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015|pp=}}\n\n=== Guest-host ===\nVertical power differences were partly balanced by horizontal mutual obligations of hospitality between guest and hosts.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015|pp=}} According to [[David W. Anthony]], the domestication of horses and the introduction of the wagon in the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe|Pontic-Caspian steppe]] between 4500 and 3500 BC led to an increase in mobility across the Yamnaya horizon, and eventually to the emergence of a guest-host political structure. As various herding clans began to move across the steppes, especially in harsh seasons, it became necessary to regulate local migrations on the territories of tribes which had likely restricted these obligations to their kins or co-residents (*''h\u2084er\u00f3s'') until then.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}} In Proto-Indo-European, the term *''gh\u00f3s-ti''-, whose original meaning must have been \"table companion\",<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garnier|first=Romain|author-link=Romain Garnier|date=2013|title=Le nom indo-europ\u00e9en de l'h\u00f4te|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7817/jameroriesoci.133.1.0057|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=133|issue=1|pages=57\u201369|doi=10.7817/jameroriesoci.133.1.0057|via=}}</ref> could either mean a ''host'' or a ''guest.''{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}} The connotation of an obligatory reciprocity between both guests and hosts has persisted in descendant [[Cognate|cognates]]: Latin ''hosp\u0113s'' (\"foreigner, guest; host\"), Old English ''\u0121iest'' (\"stranger, guest\"), or [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''gost\u012d'' (\"guest\") and ''gospod\u012d'' (\"master\").{{Sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=269}}\n\nGuests and hosts were indeed involved in a mutual and reciprocal relationship bound by oaths and sacrifices. The giving and receiving of favors was accompanied by a set of ritual actions that indebted the guest to show hospitality to his host at any time in the future. The obligation could even be heritable: [[Homer]]\u2019s warriors, [[Glaucus_of_Lycia|Glaukos]] and [[Diomedes]], stopped fighting and presented gifts to each other when they learned that their ''grandfathers'' had shared a guest-host relationship.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}}{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=19\u201320}} Violations of the guest-host obligations were immoral, illegal and unholy: in [[Early Irish law|Irish law]], refusing hospitality was deemed a crime as serious as murder. The killing of a guest was also greeted with a singular revulsion, as was the abuse of hospitality.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=19\u201320}}\n\n=== Legal system ===\nBecause of the archaic nature of traditional legal phraseology\u2014which preserves old forms and meaning for words\u2014and the necessity for legal sentences to be uttered precisely the same way each time to remain binding, it is possible to securely reconstruct some elements of the Proto-Indo-European legal system.{{Sfn|Watkins|1986|p=}}{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=21\u201322}} For instance, the word *''serk''- (\"to make a circle, complete\") designated a type of compensation where the father (or the master) had to either pay for the damages caused by his son (or slave), or surrender the perpetrator to the offended party. It is attested by a common legal and linguistic origin in both [[Roman law|Roman]] and [[Hittite laws]].{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=21\u201322}}\n\nLaw was apparently designed to preserve the \"order\" (''*h\u2090\u00e9rtus'') of the universe, with the underlying concept that harmony should be maintained, be it in the physical universe or the social world.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|p=345|1997}} There was however no public enforcement of justice in Proto-Indo-European society, nor was there formal courts as we know it today. Contractual obligations were protected by private individuals acting as sureties: they pledged to be responsible for payments of debts incurred by someone else if the latter defaulted. In case of litigation, one could either take matter into their own hands, for instance by barring someone from accessing their property to compel payment, or bring the case before judges (perhaps kings) that featured witnesses.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=21\u201322}} The word for \"oath\", ''*h\u2081\u00f3itos'', derives from the verb ''*h\u2081ei-'' (\"to go\"), after the practice of walking between slaughtered animals as part of taking an oath.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=277}}\n\nThe root ''*h\u2090\u00e9rtus'' (from ''*h\u2090er-'', \"to fit\") is associated with the concept of a [[Cosmos|cosmic order]], i.e. which is \"fitting, right, ordered\". It is one of most securely reconstructed Proto-Indo-European words, with cognates in most sub-families: [[Latin]] ''artus'' (\"joint\"); [[Middle High German]] ''art'' (\"innate feature, nature, fashion\"); [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''art\u00fas'' (\"arrangement\"), possibly ''[[arete]]'' (\"excellence\");<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beekes|first=Robert S.

Cattle and sheep were more important in ritual sacrifices than in diet, suggesting that a new set of cults and rituals had spread eastward across the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe|Pontic-Caspian steppes]], with domesticated animals at the root of the proto-Indo-European conception of the universe.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=185\u2013186}} Anthony attributed the first and progressive domestication of horses, from taming to actually working with the animal, to that period.

Yamnaya herders likely watched over their cattle and raided on horseback, while driving wagons for the bulk transport of water or food.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=330\u2013335}} Their chiefdoms had institutionalized differences in prestige and power, and the society was organized along patron-client reciprocity, a mutual exchange of gifts and favors between their patrons, the gods, and human clients.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=99}} The Yamnaya funeral sacrifice of wagons, carts, sheep, cattle, and horse was probably related to a cult of ancestors requiring specific rituals and prayers, a connection between language and cult that introduced late Proto-Indo-European to new speakers.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=304}} The language itself appeared as a [[Dialect continuum|dialectal continuum]] during this period.{{sfn|Bomhard|2019|p=3}} Proto-Indo-European likely ceased to be spoken after 2500 BC, as its various dialects were already distinct languages that spread across western Eurasia during the third wave of [[Indo-European migrations]],{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=51}} which had begun with the expansion of Usatovo people (associated with pre-[[Germanic languages|Germanic]]) towards southeastern Poland through the [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old European]] [[Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture|Tripolye culture]] around 3300 BCE, and with the migration of pre-[[Italo-Celtic]] speakers towards the [[Pannonian Basin]] in Central Europe around 3100\u20132800 BCE.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015|pp=}}{{sfn|Bomhard|2019|p=3}}\n\n== Social structure ==\n\n=== Class structure ===\nIt is generally agreed that Proto-Indo-European society was hierarchical, with some form of social ranking and various degrees of social status.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=17\u201319}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=336}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=284\u2013285}} It is unlikely however that they had a rigidly stratified structure, or [[Caste system in India|castes]] such as are found in historical India.{{Sfn|Della Volpe|1993|p=}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=430}} Some [[kurgan]] graves, larger than the average and necessitating a considerable number of people to be built, suggest a higher status given to some individuals, although this prestigious funeral was not necessarily reserved to the wealthiest person. Smiths in particular were given sumptuous graves, possibly due to the association of smithery to magic during the [[Bronze Age|early Bronze Age]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=336}} In general, such graves were mostly occupied by males in the eastern Don-Volga steppes, while they were more egalitarian in the western Dnieper-Donets region.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=331\u2013334}} There was a general distinction between free persons and slaves, typically prisoners of war or debtors unable to repay a debt.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=17}} The free part of society was composed of an elite class of priests, kings and warriors, along with the commoners,{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=17}} with each tribe following a chief (''*wi\u1e31pots'') sponsoring feasts and ceremonies and who was eventually immortalized in praise poetry.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=336}}[[File:Yamna03.jpg|thumb|215.994x215.994px|Yamnaya bone and canine ornaments.]]\n=== Kinship ===\nLinguistics has allowed for the reliable reconstruction of a large number of words relating to kinship relations. These all agree in exhibiting a [[patriarchal]], [[patrilocal]] and [[patrilineal]] social fabric.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=17\u201319}} Patrilocality is confirmed by lexical evidence, including the word *''{{PIE|h<sub>2</sub>u\u032fedh}}''-, \"to lead (away)\", being the word that denotes a male wedding a female, but not vice-versa.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=483}} Rights, possessions, and responsibilities were consequently reckoned to the father, and wives were to reside after marriage near the husband's family, after the payment of a bride-price.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=328}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}}\n\nThe *''dems-potis'' was the patriarch, the master of the household ({{PIE|''*domos''}}).{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}} Once established, the family lasted as long as the male stock of its founder endured, and clan or tribal founders were often portrayed as mythical beings stemming from a mythical past in Indo-European traditions.{{Sfn|Della Volpe|1993|p=}} In this form of kinship organization, the individual's genetic distance from the clan's founding ancestor determined his social status. But if he was able of exceptional prowess or virtue, the same individual could in his turn gain social prestige among the community and eventually found his own descent-group.{{Sfn|Della Volpe|1993|p=}} \n\nIn the reconstructed lexicon linking the individual to the clan, ''*h\u2084er\u00f3s'' meant a \"member of one\u2019s own group\", \"one who belongs to the community in contrast to an outsider\", which would give the Indo-Iranian term ''[[Aryan|\u00e1rya]]'' (an [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]]) and the Irish ''aire'' (\"noble, chief\").{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=209}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}} It is unlikely however that the word had an ethnic connotation, and we do not known if Proto-Indo-European speakers had a term to designate themselves as a group.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}} Another term, *''h\u2081leudhos'', meant \"people\", \"freemen\" in a more general way.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}}\n\n=== Patron-client ===\nProto-Indo-European had several words for \"leader\": *''tag\u00f3s'' was a general term derived from ''*t\u0101\u0306g-'' (\"set in place, arrange\"); *''h\u2083r\u1e17\u01f5s'' meant a ruler who also had religious functions, with the Roman [[Rex Sacrorum|rex sacrorum]] (\"king of the sacred\") as an heritage of the priestly function of the king; *''w(n\u0329)n\u00e1kts'' designated a \"lord\" and possessed a feminine equivalent,''*wn\u00e1ktih\u2090'' (a \"queen\"); while the ''*wi\u1e31pots'' (or ''*wi\u1e31-potis'') was the chief of the settlement ({{PIE|''*wei\u1e31s''}}),{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}} the seat of a tribe, clan or family.{{sfn|Beekes|2011|p=35}}\n\nPublic feasts sponsored by such patrons were a way for them to promote and secure a political hierarchy built on the unequal mobilization of labor and resources, by displaying their generosity towards the rest of the community. Rivals competed publicly through the size and complexity of their feasts, and alliances were confirmed by gift-giving and promises made during those public gatherings. The host of the feast was called the *''ghosti''-''potis'', the \"lord of the guests\", who honored the immortal gods and his mortal guests with gifts of food, drink, and poetry.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015|pp=}}\n\n=== Guest-host ===\nVertical power differences were partly balanced by horizontal mutual obligations of hospitality between guest and hosts.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015|pp=}} According to [[David W. Anthony]], the domestication of horses and the introduction of the wagon in the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe|Pontic-Caspian steppe]] between 4500 and 3500 BC led to an increase in mobility across the Yamnaya horizon, and eventually to the emergence of a guest-host political structure. As various herding clans began to move across the steppes, especially in harsh seasons, it became necessary to regulate local migrations on the territories of tribes which had likely restricted these obligations to their kins or co-residents (*''h\u2084er\u00f3s'') until then.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}} In Proto-Indo-European, the term *''gh\u00f3s-ti''-, whose original meaning must have been \"table companion\",<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garnier|first=Romain|author-link=Romain Garnier|date=2013|title=Le nom indo-europ\u00e9en de l'h\u00f4te|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7817/jameroriesoci.133.1.0057|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=133|issue=1|pages=57\u201369|doi=10.7817/jameroriesoci.133.1.0057|via=}}</ref> could either mean a ''host'' or a ''guest.''{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}} The connotation of an obligatory reciprocity between both guests and hosts has persisted in descendant [[Cognate|cognates]]: Latin ''hosp\u0113s'' (\"foreigner, guest; host\"), Old English ''\u0121iest'' (\"stranger, guest\"), or [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''gost\u012d'' (\"guest\") and ''gospod\u012d'' (\"master\").{{Sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=269}}\n\nGuests and hosts were indeed involved in a mutual and reciprocal relationship bound by oaths and sacrifices. The giving and receiving of favors was accompanied by a set of ritual actions that indebted the guest to show hospitality to his host at any time in the future. The obligation could even be heritable: [[Homer]]\u2019s warriors, [[Glaucus_of_Lycia|Glaukos]] and [[Diomedes]], stopped fighting and presented gifts to each other when they learned that their ''grandfathers'' had shared a guest-host relationship.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}}{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=19\u201320}} Violations of the guest-host obligations were immoral, illegal and unholy: in [[Early Irish law|Irish law]], refusing hospitality was deemed a crime as serious as murder. The killing of a guest was also greeted with a singular revulsion, as was the abuse of hospitality.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=19\u201320}}\n\n=== Legal system ===\nBecause of the archaic nature of traditional legal phraseology\u2014which preserves old forms and meaning for words\u2014and the necessity for legal sentences to be uttered precisely the same way each time to remain binding, it is possible to securely reconstruct some elements of the Proto-Indo-European legal system.{{Sfn|Watkins|1986|p=}}{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=21\u201322}} For instance, the word *''serk''- (\"to make a circle, complete\") designated a type of compensation where the father (or the master) had to either pay for the damages caused by his son (or slave), or surrender the perpetrator to the offended party. It is attested by a common legal and linguistic origin in both [[Roman law|Roman]] and [[Hittite laws]].{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=21\u201322}}\n\nLaw was apparently designed to preserve the \"order\" (''*h\u2090\u00e9rtus'') of the universe, with the underlying concept that harmony should be maintained, be it in the physical universe or the social world.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|p=345|1997}} There was however no public enforcement of justice in Proto-Indo-European society, nor was there formal courts as we know it today. Contractual obligations were protected by private individuals acting as sureties: they pledged to be responsible for payments of debts incurred by someone else if the latter defaulted. In case of litigation, one could either take matter into their own hands, for instance by barring someone from accessing their property to compel payment, or bring the case before judges (perhaps kings) that featured witnesses.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=21\u201322}} The word for \"oath\", ''*h\u2081\u00f3itos'', derives from the verb ''*h\u2081ei-'' (\"to go\"), after the practice of walking between slaughtered animals as part of taking an oath.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=277}}\n\nThe root ''*h\u2090\u00e9rtus'' (from ''*h\u2090er-'', \"to fit\") is associated with the concept of a [[Cosmos|cosmic order]], i.e. which is \"fitting, right, ordered\". It is one of most securely reconstructed Proto-Indo-European words, with cognates in most sub-families: [[Latin]] ''artus'' (\"joint\"); [[Middle High German]] ''art'' (\"innate feature, nature, fashion\"); [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''art\u00fas'' (\"arrangement\"), possibly ''[[arete]]'' (\"excellence\");<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beekes|first=Robert S.

Animals were slaughtered ({{PIE|''*g\u02b7\u02b0n\u0325t\u00f3s''}}) and dedicated to the gods ({{PIE|''*d\u00e9iwos''}}) in the hope of winning their favor.
