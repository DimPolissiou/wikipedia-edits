They are harassed by a cruel, [[Drug dealer|drug-dealer]] [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] named Saeed, who seizes the young man's prized car in exchange for money the father owes him. In a crime of opportunity, Arash steals a pair of diamond earrings from the wealthy young woman he works for, Shaydah.\n\nSaeed comes across a strange young woman in a [[chador]] at night. She seduces Saeed to take her back to his apartment. While there, she grows long [[fang]]s and first bites off his finger, then goes for his neck, killing him. As she leaves, she passes by Arash, who has come to offer the earrings for his car. He finds Saeed dead, and takes back his [[Lock and key|car keys]] along with a suitcase of drugs and cash. Arash decides to sell the drugs, allowing him to quit his job working for Shaydah. Later, he goes to a [[costume party]] at a [[Nightclub|night club]] dressed up as [[Count Dracula|Dracula]], where he is seduced by Shaydah into taking one of the [[MDMA|ecstasy]] pills he is selling. Under the influence, he is rejected by her, and ends up lost at night on the street.\n\nThe woman with the chador spends her time listening to music alone in her apartment, [[skateboarding]], or bedeviling pedestrians at night, until she comes across the lost Arash. He shows vulnerability and compassion, and she takes him to her home, where they listen to music, and she resists his exposed neck. They meet the next night, and she says that he does not know the terrible things she has done. He is unfazed, gives her the earrings and \u2013 at her request \u2013 pierces her ears with a [[safety pin]], but she eventually leaves.\n\nAtti, a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] who worked for Saeed, is followed at night by the woman, and they retreat to the prostitute's apartment. The woman gives Atti the payment Saeed owed her. They have a conversation during which the woman realizes that Atti no longer remembers what it is to desire. She leaves.\n\nSuffering from [[heroin withdrawal]], Hossein has an episode where he believes that Arash's cat is his dead wife. Infuriated by his father, Arash gives him drugs and money and throws him out, telling him to take the cat with him. Hossein goes to Atti and forces her to take heroin with him. They are found by the woman, who kills Hossein. After Atti helps her dispose of Hossein's body, she tells her to take the cat and leave.\n\nThe following morning, Arash discovers Hossein's body. Distressed, he runs to the apartment of the woman and begs her to run away with him. As she is gathering up her things, the cat appears and Arash realizes that she had something to do with his father's death. Arash and the woman drive off together but he pulls off to the side of the road, angry and undecided about what to do.

Enshrined in Articles 15 and 16 of the Indian Constitution, it allows the Indian government to set quotas to ensure any \"socially and educationally backward classes of citizens\" is properly represented in public life.  It is intended to realise the promise of equality enshrined in the [[Constitution of India]]. \n\nReservation is primarily given to 3 groups: [[Scheduled Caste and ScheduledGrou (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989|Scheduled]] Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes, abbreviated as SC, ST, and OBC respectively. These are groups that have faced social and economic discrimination in the past and/or the present and were severely underrepresented in public life. Today anyone whose forefathers belonged to ST/SC community gets the benefits of reservation irrespective of his socioeconomic status. Originally reservation was only given to SCs and STs but was later extended to OBCs in 1987 after the implementation of the [[Mandal Commission]] report.\n\nIt is observed that even after 70 years of reservation the backward classes haven't been benefitted the way they should have been and reservation keeps getting extended after every 10 years. One of the major reasons for this is no income cap on ST/SC reservations unlike OBC and EWS reservations where there is an income cap so that once a person is benefitted by reservation and is capable of earning a livelihood, he is no longer entitled to reservation.\nAs there is no concept of creamy layer in ST/SC reservations, even the son, grandson and great grand son of any other class A officer gets the benefits of reservation who himself got reservation. So the benefits get siphoned off by the effluent ST/SC's and are not able to percolate to the lower strata. Even the supreme court has directed the central government to introduce creamy layer concept in ST/SC reservation, but this is not possible because of vote bank politics. So reservation is necessary in a country like India but rules for availing it should be changed for the overall development of people of backward classes.\n\n== Terms ==\nThere are several groups who get reservations in India.\n\n* The first are the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Castes]] These communities were variously seen as at the bottom or \"underneath\" the [[Caste system in India|caste system]] in South Asia, below even the ''Sudra'' varna. These castes have hereditary professions considered impure by South Asian society, such as sewage cleaning, tannery, or washing clothes, and were thus considered ''polluted'' by other castes. They are subject to the practice of [[untouchability]], which takes the form of various social restrictions ranging from inability to touch other castes to inability to use the same water source or even live in the same area. Historically, and even now, they were barred from entering temples and other places of worship, and sometimes were not allowed to use the same roads. Today many of these castes, as well as following their traditional occupations, are also landless agricultural labourers. They are much more behind than all other castes on economic indicators like poverty or literacy. They make up around 220 million people, 17% of India's population.\n* The next group are the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribes]]. The definition of this group varies, but the criteria for a Scheduled Tribe \"indications of primitive traits, distinctive culture, geographical isolation, shyness of contact with the community at large, and backwardness.\" Most of these groups are considered [[Adivasi|Adivasis]], and the original inhabitants while others are nomadic tribes who were notified as \"criminal tribes\" under British rule. They range in modes of existence from subsistence agriculturalists who have had interaction between the outside world to hunter-gatherer groups still in the jungles. They have suffered from exploitation of their land by both ''zamindars'' and the British, and often the same social discrimination meted out to Dalits. However in the Northeast, many of the tribals are relatively better-off and interact much more with the outside world. They are around 100 million people, around 8% of the population. Examples include the [[Boro people|Bodo]], [[Gondi people|Gondi]], [[Banjara]], and [[Santal people|Santal]].\n* The third main group are the [[Other Backward Class|Other Backward Classes]]. They were not originally in the reservation scheme, but during the premiership of Moraji Desai, the Mandal Commission studied all the communitiesin India to find what castes were \"backward\" compared to the general population. Based on 1931 census data, they estimated 52% of India's population belonged to castes that were \"backward\" due to various socioeconomic factors like wealth or jobs performed. The possiblity for providing reservation to these people was allowed for in Article 14(4), which states the government can provide reservation to \"backward classes.\" Although the Centre maintains its own list of OBC's, comprising over 5,000 castes and subcastes, each state can create their own backward caste list for in-state reservations. Most OBCs are lower castes, were classfiied originally in the ''shudra'' varna, and have low ritual status. However there are other castes in the OBC list who, although ritually low, are economically dominant and in many cases are the enforcers of the caste hierarchy, including some Brahmin groups. In some states there is a divide between backward castes, who face some socioeconomic disadvantage and most backward or extremely backward castes, who face a high amount of social discrimination barely above Dalits in their status. In fact, unlike Scheduled Castes, OBCs do not have to be Hindu and many states give benefits to some Muslim and Christian communities. This list is most subject to change since the criteria is not as stringent, making it a list added to often by politicians to please certain sections of their voters.\n\nThose who are not a member of these groups are lumped together in the General category, sometimes called the Open category. These are made up of mostly high castes who do not qualify for reservations: most communities in the Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya varnas. However, seats listed for general category can be taken by anyone irrespective of reservation status.\n\n==History==\n\n===Before independence===\nQuota systems favouring certain castes and other communities existed before [[Independence of India|independence]] in several areas of [[British India]]. Demands for various forms of positive discrimination had been made, for example, in 1882 and 1891.<ref name=\"ILI Law Review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ili.ac.in/pdf/article_2.pdf|title=Rethinking Reservation in Higher Education in India|last=Laskar|first=Mehbubul Hassan|publisher=ILI Law Review|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425081633/http://www.ili.ac.in/pdf/article_2.pdf|archivedate=25 April 2012 |pages=29\u201330}}</ref> [[Shahu of Kolhapur|Shahu]], the Maharaja of the [[princely state]] of [[Kolhapur State|Kolhapur]], introduced reservation in favour of non-[[Brahmin]] and backward classes, much of which came into force in 1902. He provided free education to everyone and opened several hostels to make it easier for them to receive it. He also tried to ensure that people thus educated were suitably employed, and he appealed both for a class-free India and the abolition of [[untouchability]]. His 1902 measures created 50 percent reservation for backward communities.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\nOn 16 September 1921, the first [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]] government passed the first Communal Government Order (G. O. # 613), thereby becoming the first elected body in the Indian legislative history to legislate reservations, which have since become standard across the country.\n\nThe [[British Raj]] introduced elements of reservation in the [[Indian Councils Act 1909|Government of India Act of 1909]] and there were many other measures put in place prior to independence.<ref name=\"ILI Law Review\" /> A significant one emerged from the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conference of June 1932]], when the  Prime Minister of Britain, [[Ramsay MacDonald]], proposed the [[Communal Award]], according to which separate representation was to be provided for [[Muslims]], [[Sikhs]], [[Indian Christians]], [[Anglo-Indians]], and [[Europeans]]. The depressed classes, roughly corresponding to the STs and SCs, were assigned a number of seats to be filled by election from constituencies in which only they could vote, although they could also vote in other seats. The proposal was controversial: [[Mahatma Gandhi]] fasted in protest against it but many among the depressed classes, including their leader, [[B. R. Ambedkar]], favoured it. After negotiations, Gandhi reached an agreement with Ambedkar to have a single Hindu electorate, with [[Dalits]] having seats reserved within it. Electorates for other religions, such as Islam and Sikhism, remained separate. This became known as the [[Poona Pact]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Transfer of Power in India |first=V.

Enshrined in Articles 15 and 16 of the Indian Constitution, it allows the Indian government to set quotas to ensure any \"socially and educationally backward classes of citizens\" is properly represented in public life.  It is intended to realise the promise of equality enshrined in the [[Constitution of India]]. \n\nReservation is primarily given to 3 groups: [[Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989|Scheduled]] Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes, abbreviated as SC, ST, and OBC respectively. These are groups that have faced social and economic discrimination in the past and/or the present and were severely underrepresented in public life. Today anyone whose forefathers belonged to ST/SC community gets the benefits of reservation irrespective of his socioeconomic status. Originally reservation was only given to SCs and STs but was later extended to OBCs in 1987 after the implementation of the [[Mandal Commission]] report.\n\nIt is observed that even after 70 years of reservation the backward classes haven't been benefitted the way they should have been and reservation keeps getting extended after every 10 years. One of the major reasons for this is no income cap on ST/SC reservations unlike OBC and EWS reservations where there is an income cap so that once a person is benefitted by reservation and is capable of earning a livelihood, he is no longer entitled to reservation.\nAs there is no concept of creamy layer in ST/SC reservations, even the son, grandson and great grand son of any other class A officer gets the benefits of reservation who himself got reservation. So the benefits get siphoned off by the effluent ST/SC's and are not able to percolate to the lower strata. Even the supreme court has directed the central government to introduce creamy layer concept in ST/SC reservation, but this is not possible because of vote bank politics. So reservation is necessary in a country like India but rules for availing it should be changed for the overall development of people of backward classes.\n\n== Terms ==\nThere are several groups who get reservations in India.\n\n* The first are the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Castes]] These communities were variously seen as at the bottom or \"underneath\" the [[Caste system in India|caste system]] in South Asia, below even the ''Sudra'' varna. These castes have hereditary professions considered impure by South Asian society, such as sewage cleaning, tannery, or washing clothes, and were thus considered ''polluted'' by other castes. They are subject to the practice of [[untouchability]], which takes the form of various social restrictions ranging from inability to touch other castes to inability to use the same water source or even live in the same area. Historically, and even now, they were barred from entering temples and other places of worship, and sometimes were not allowed to use the same roads. Today many of these castes, as well as following their traditional occupations, are also landless agricultural labourers. They are much more behind than all other castes on economic indicators like poverty or literacy. They make up around 220 million people, 17% of India's population.\n* The next group are the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribes]]. The definition of this group varies, but the criteria for a Scheduled Tribe \"indications of primitive traits, distinctive culture, geographical isolation, shyness of contact with the community at large, and backwardness.\" Most of these groups are considered [[Adivasi|Adivasis]], and the original inhabitants while others are nomadic tribes who were notified as \"criminal tribes\" under British rule. They range in modes of existence from subsistence agriculturalists who have had interaction between the outside world to hunter-gatherer groups still in the jungles. They have suffered from exploitation of their land by both ''zamindars'' and the British, and often the same social discrimination meted out to Dalits. However in the Northeast, many of the tribals are relatively better-off and interact much more with the outside world. They are around 100 million people, around 8% of the population. Examples include the [[Boro people|Bodo]], [[Gondi people|Gondi]], [[Banjara]], and [[Santal people|Santal]].\n* The third main group are the [[Other Backward Class|Other Backward Classes]]. They were not originally in the reservation scheme, but during the premiership of Moraji Desai, the Mandal Commission studied all the communitiesin India to find what castes were \"backward\" compared to the general population. Based on 1931 census data, they estimated 52% of India's population belonged to castes that were \"backward\" due to various socioeconomic factors like wealth or jobs performed. The possiblity for providing reservation to these people was allowed for in Article 14(4), which states the government can provide reservation to \"backward classes.\" Although the Centre maintains its own list of OBC's, comprising over 5,000 castes and subcastes, each state can create their own backward caste list for in-state reservations. Most OBCs are lower castes, were classfiied originally in the ''shudra'' varna, and have low ritual status. However there are other castes in the OBC list who, although ritually low, are economically dominant and in many cases are the enforcers of the caste hierarchy, including some Brahmin groups. In some states there is a divide between backward castes, who face some socioeconomic disadvantage and most backward or extremely backward castes, who face a high amount of social discrimination barely above Dalits in their status. In fact, unlike Scheduled Castes, OBCs do not have to be Hindu and many states give benefits to some Muslim and Christian communities. This list is most subject to change since the criteria is not as stringent, making it a list added to often by politicians to please certain sections of their voters.\n\nThose who are not a member of these groups are lumped together in the General category, sometimes called the Open category. These are made up of mostly high castes who do not qualify for reservations: most communities in the Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya varnas. However, seats listed for general category can be taken by anyone irrespective of reservation status.\n\n==History==\n\n===Before independence===\nQuota systems favouring certain castes and other communities existed before [[Independence of India|independence]] in several areas of [[British India]]. Demands for various forms of positive discrimination had been made, for example, in 1882 and 1891.<ref name=\"ILI Law Review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ili.ac.in/pdf/article_2.pdf|title=Rethinking Reservation in Higher Education in India|last=Laskar|first=Mehbubul Hassan|publisher=ILI Law Review|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425081633/http://www.ili.ac.in/pdf/article_2.pdf|archivedate=25 April 2012 |pages=29\u201330}}</ref> [[Shahu of Kolhapur|Shahu]], the Maharaja of the [[princely state]] of [[Kolhapur State|Kolhapur]], introduced reservation in favour of non-[[Brahmin]] and backward classes, much of which came into force in 1902. He provided free education to everyone and opened several hostels to make it easier for them to receive it. He also tried to ensure that people thus educated were suitably employed, and he appealed both for a class-free India and the abolition of [[untouchability]]. His 1902 measures created 50 percent reservation for backward communities.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\nOn 16 September 1921, the first [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]] government passed the first Communal Government Order (G. O. # 613), thereby becoming the first elected body in the Indian legislative history to legislate reservations, which have since become standard across the country.\n\nThe [[British Raj]] introduced elements of reservation in the [[Indian Councils Act 1909|Government of India Act of 1909]] and there were many other measures put in place prior to independence.<ref name=\"ILI Law Review\" /> A significant one emerged from the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conference of June 1932]], when the  Prime Minister of Britain, [[Ramsay MacDonald]], proposed the [[Communal Award]], according to which separate representation was to be provided for [[Muslims]], [[Sikhs]], [[Indian Christians]], [[Anglo-Indians]], and [[Europeans]]. The depressed classes, roughly corresponding to the STs and SCs, were assigned a number of seats to be filled by election from constituencies in which only they could vote, although they could also vote in other seats. The proposal was controversial: [[Mahatma Gandhi]] fasted in protest against it but many among the depressed classes, including their leader, [[B. R. Ambedkar]], favoured it. After negotiations, Gandhi reached an agreement with Ambedkar to have a single Hindu electorate, with [[Dalits]] having seats reserved within it. Electorates for other religions, such as Islam and Sikhism, remained separate. This became known as the [[Poona Pact]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Transfer of Power in India |first=V.

This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]].

These were Newtown (now Outfield) and Bank (now Guardswell).<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance.

Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone).

They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms.

{"title_page": "Ramadan al-Shallash", "text_new": "[[File:Shallash and Jouvenel.jpg|thumb|right|Shallash (left) surrendering to High Commissioner [[Henry de Jouvenel]] (right) in January 1926]]\n\n'''Rama\u1e0d\u0101n P\u0101sh\u0101 al-Shall\u0101sh''' ({{lang-ar|\u0631\u0645\u0636\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u0644\u0627\u0634}}; 1879\u20131946) was a prominent rebel commander of the 1925 [[Great Syrian Revolt]] and, prior to that, a military officer in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Sharifian army|Sharifian]] armies.\n\nShallash became a captain in the Ottoman army, serving on the [[Italian invasion of Libya|Libyan]] and [[First Balkan War|Balkan]] fronts in 1911 and 1912, respectively. In 1916, he joined the [[Arab Revolt|Arab independence movement]] of [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Sharif Hussein]]. Three years later, he led efforts to ensure Deir ez-Zor and its environs become part of [[Arab Kingdom of Syria|Syria]]; to that end, he and his [[Bedouin]] fighters expelled the British from the city without apparent sanction from Hussein's son, Emir [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]]. He was consequently dismissed from Deir ez-Zor but continued his efforts nonetheless.\n\nAfter France toppled Faisal's government and took over Syria in 1920, Shallash moved to [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]]. He served as the intermediary between that country's emir and Faisal's brother, [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]], and the [[Hananu Revolt|northern Syrian revolt]] leader [[Ibrahim Hananu]]. With the launch of the Great Syrian Revolt, Shallash returned to command his own rebel band. He participated in the rebels' brief capture of [[Damascus]] and later led operations in the [[Anti-Lebanon Mountains]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nShallash was born in al-Shumaytiyah, [[Deir ez-Zor Governorate]], likely in 1879.<ref name=\"Provence211\">Provence 2011, p. 211.</ref> His autobiography states that he was born in 1869, but this was likely a typo.<ref>Provence, p. 223, n. 38.</ref> His father was the [[sheikh]] (chieftain) of the Al Bu Saraya (also spelled \"Albu Saray\"), a [[Bedouin]] tribe that inhabited the area around Deir ez-Zor.<ref name=\"Khoury108\">Khoury 1987, p. 108.</ref> Shallash graduated from [[Istanbul]]'s Military School for Bedouin Chiefs in 1898.<ref name=\"Provence211\"/> His five years of military schooling focused on Islamic education, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] culture and history, and basic reading and writing courses.<ref name=\"Provence212\">Provence 2011, p. 212.</ref> Historian Michael Provence holds that due to his older age and other factors, Shallash \"certainly would have needed the specialized remedial curriculum of the Tribal School\".<ref name=\"Provence212\"/> It was at the military academy that he likely met a number of [[Arab]] officers who later became his associates, including [[Yasin al-Hashimi]], [[Fawzi al-Qawuqji]], [[Sa'id al-'As]] and [[Jafar al-Askari|Ja'far al-Askari]].<ref name=\"Provence212\"/>\n\n==Military career==\n===Service with the Ottomans===\nAfter graduating, Shallash was made a ''y\u00fczba\u015f\u0131'' (captain) in the [[Ottoman Army (1861\u20131922)|Ottoman Army]]; this was a high rank for a new graduate and its attainment was due to the imperial favor shown to the sons of rural sheikhs in the military.<ref name=\"Provence212\"/> In 1911, he was sent to fight in [[Ottoman Libya|Libya]] against the [[Italian invasion of Libya|Italian invasion]]. There, he encountered the prominent Ottoman officers [[Aziz Ali al-Misri]], [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturk|Mustafa Kemal]] and [[Enver Pasha]].<ref name=\"Provence212\"/> After the Ottoman defeat in Libya, Shallash was reassigned to the [[First Balkan War|Balkan front]], where he commanded a unit of soldiers from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].<ref name=\"Provence212\"/> Sources are not clear about Shallash's service with the Ottomans during [[World War I]].<ref name=\"Provence212\"/>\n\n===Service with the Hashemites===\nShallash himself asserted that he defected from the Ottomans in 1916 to serve in the [[Sharifian army]] of the [[Hashemites|Hashemite]] leader [[Sharif Husayn]].<ref name=\"Provence212\"/><ref name=\"Moubayed393\"/> Accordingly, he fought at [[Medina]] during the [[Arab Revolt]] against the Ottomans.<ref name=\"Khoury108\"/> He served as a commander and a private [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] of Sharif Husayn until 1918, following the British-backed Sharifian conquest of [[Ottoman Syria]].<ref name=\"Moubayed393\">Moubayed 2006, p. 393.</ref> Sharif Husayn's son, Emir [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]] set up a rudimentary government in [[Damascus]] in October-November 1918 with the support of the allied and clandestine [[Arab nationalist]] societies, [[al-Fatat]] and [[Covenant Society|al-Ahd]].<ref name=\"Tauber365\">Tauber 1991, p. 365.</ref> Al-Shallash had been a member of the latter group, which mostly consisted of ex-Ottoman officers from the empire's Arab territories.<ref name=\"Tauber365\"/>\n\nIn late May 1919, Shallash returned to Deir ez-Zor to rally support for the Arab government in Damascus and stir opposition to British forces among the largest Bedouin tribes in the [[Upper Mesopotamia|Jazira]] region, the [[Shammar]] and [[`Anazzah]].<ref name=\"Tauber365\"/> He went as far north as [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Turkish]]-held [[Urfa]] to gather tribal allegiance for the Arab government and support for Damascus's annexation of the regions near British-held [[Iraq]].<ref name=\"Tauber365\"/> He received the support of several tribal sheikhs, but none agreed to accompany him back to Damascus to demonstrate their allegiance to Faisal, and many favored their regions becoming part of Iraq.<ref name=\"Tauber365\"/>\n\n===Actions in Deir ez-Zor===\n{{main|Occupation of Zor}}\n====Raid====\n\nSyria was slated to come under French rule as per the secret [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]] with the British, while the latter would control Iraq and Palestine. In September 1919, the British and French agreed that the former would withdraw its troops from Syria to make way for the French, who by then had only deployed along Syria's northern coastline and in [[Mount Lebanon]].<ref name=\"Tauber366\">Tauber 1991, p. 366.</ref> Faisal and the Arab nationalists were incensed at the division of Arab territories among the colonial powers, having been promised by the British independence in return for revolting against the Ottomans.<ref name=\"Tauber366\"/> The impending withdrawal of British forces prompted al-Ahd's central leadership to use the opportunity to annex Deir ez-Zor to Syria and the al-Ahd leadership chose Shallash to lead the Arab charge in Jazira.<ref name=\"Tauber366\"/> Al-Ahd's top leader and the chief of staff of the Arab Army of Syria, Yasin al-Hashimi, directed Ja'far al-Askari, the Arab governor of [[Aleppo Vilayet]], to appoint Shallash governor of the [[Raqqa District]], thereby giving him official cover for his operation in Deir ez-Zor.<ref name=\"Tauber366\"/> Al-Hashimi tasked Shallash with taking over the city, transferring to him some Iraqi officers and funds to gain the support of local Bedouin tribes.<ref name=\"Tauber366\"/>\n\nOn 12 November 1919, Shallash departed Damascus with one hundred camel-mounted troops to [[Raqqa]], from which [[Occupation of Zor|he set out eastward to Deir ez-Zor]] with forty troops in December.<ref name=\"Tauber366\"/> By then, the city was held by a British military governor, Captain Chamier. As Shallash prepared for his assault on Deir ez-Zor, he spurned tribal leaders in the vicinity to oppose the British and handed them a letter signed by Emir Zayd, Faisal's brother and placeholder while he was in Europe, that asked for them to assist Shallash, the \"military governor of the ''qada\u02bf'' [district] of the Raqqa region, the Khabur river, and the Euphrates\".<ref name=\"Tauber366\"/> Captain Chamier received intelligence of Shallash's activities and in response, arrested Deir ez-Zor's mayor on suspicion of collaboration with Shallash. Furthermore, on 10 December, Chamier requested support via telegraph from the British regional headquarters in [[Albu Kamal]] and [[Baghdad]].<ref name=\"Tauber366\"/> Shallash had the telegraph lines to Deir ez-Zor cut soon after.<ref name=\"Tauber367\">Tauber 1991, p. 367.</ref>\n\nOn 11 December, at 3:00 am, between 500 and 2,000 Bedouin tribesmen raided Deir ez-Zor, entering from its southern entrance, i.e. from the desert instead of the population centers to the east, west and north. The tribesmen were joined by townspeople and together they burned down the local British headquarters, and entered the town's hospital, two mosques and a church. Cash stored in the government house was seized, but the town [[bazaar]] was not looted. The tribesmen raided the local prison and freed its inmates. In the fighting, thirty rebels were killed and sixty wounded when a fuel tank was ignited and exploded near them at 5:00 am. Shallash did not command the tribesmen, but was on standby outside of Deir ez-Zor. Chamier and his relatively small group of officers and troops, along with sixty local gendarmes, barricaded themselves in their barracks. They had two armored cars and two machine guns. The armored car that was sent by Chamier to impose order inside Deir ez-Zor was neutralized. Meanwhile, about forty of the gendarmes defected and fled the barracks. At 10:00 am, the barracks came under rebel fire and Chamier's last machine gun was heavily damaged.<ref name=\"Tauber367\"/>\n\nWith supplies running out, Chamier was obliged to negotiate a truce with the townspeople and local sheikhs at the mayor's residence.<ref name=\"Tauber367\"/> Shallash entered the town later in the afternoon, declared the district's independence and raised the [[flag of the Arab Revolt|Arab flag]] over the British headquarters.<ref name=\"Tauber367\"/> He told Chamier that the people of Deir ez-Zor had requested his intervention and demanded the British withdraw.<ref name=\"Tauber367\"/> He also demanded that Syria's border be extended eastward toward [[Anah]].<ref name=\"Tauber367\"/> Chamier agreed as long Shallash guaranteed the safety of the Christian community and the Arabs who had served the British.<ref name=\"Tauber367\"/> Shallash held the British hostage pending an official  assurance that no punitive action would be taken against the city.<ref name=\"Tauber367\"/>\n\n====Further offensives and administration====\nIntent on making Albu Kamal a part of Syria, Shallash dispatched two [[column (military)|column]]s to drive the British out of that city.<ref name=\"Tauber369\">Tauber 1991, p. 369.</ref> On 13 December, they captured [[Mayadin]], before proceeding to Albu Kamal the next day. By then, its forty-man British garrison withdrew.<ref name=\"Tauber369\"/> Shallash invited the [[Dulaim]] tribal sheikhs to join in his efforts against the British, but they rejected and condemned him.<ref name=\"Tauber369\"/> Meanwhile, the tribal forces fought over plunder, weakening them and allowing the British to recapture the city with little resistance by 21 December.<ref name=\"Tauber369\"/> Mayadin remained under Shallash's control.<ref name=\"Tauber369\"/> \n\nThe tribal sheikhs around Deir ez-Zor were distributed funds by Shallash to keep their forces deployed in the city.<ref name=\"Tauber368\">Tauber 1991, p. 368.</ref> However, most of the sheikhs retreated to their encampments within a few days, leaving Shallash only with the soldiers he arrived with and Al Bu Saray tribesmen.<ref name=\"Tauber368\"/> A ten-man council of local dignitaries and sheikhs was formed to administer the city.<ref name=\"Tauber368\"/> Funding was provided by Turkish and other foreign donors. However, the local inhabitants grew resentful at Shallash's interference in their affairs.<ref name=\"Tauber368\"/> This, coupled with the threat of an opportunistic Turkish invasion of Deir ez-Zor due to the concentration of troops to the north, prompted Shallash to request British financial support to fend off such an invasion; to that end, he met with Chamier on 19 December.<ref name=\"Tauber368\"/> The British ultimately refused him assistance, and Faisal, having been informed of events, directed Emir Zayd to dissociate the Arab government from Shallash's actions and order his arrest.<ref name=\"Tauber368\"/> The British communicated that they had no interest in Deir ez-Zor and that the Arab government should deal with Shallash.<ref name=\"Tauber368\"/> On 25 December, Shallash agreed to release the British hostages after being guaranteed of no reprisals by the British.<ref name=\"Tauber369\"/>\n\n====Dismissal====\nShallash was not satisfied with the Arab\u2013British agreement that left Albu Kamal, [[Al-Qa'im (town)|al-Qa'im]] and Anah on the Iraqi side of the border.<ref name=\"Tauber372\">Tauber 1991, p. 372.</ref> He sent men to collect taxes, raid British-held parts of the Jazira and destroy British transport lines.<ref name=\"Tauber372\"/> He also threatened to kill the British commander in Albu Kamal should he not withdraw, and to take the fight to [[Mosul]] in the north. The British warned Shallash of major repercussions should he continue his campaign; Shallash responded on 11 January 1920 by ordering a raid against Albu Kamal.<ref name=\"Tauber372\"/> The British counterattacked and Shallash's men withdrew to Mayadin.<ref name=\"Tauber372\"/> The following day, the Arab government ordered Shallash's dismissal, whilst protesting Albu Kamal's exclusion from Syria.<ref name=\"Tauber372\"/> Al-Ahd and Emir Zayd agreed that [[Mawlud Mukhlis]] replace Shallash, and the former entered Deir ez-Zor on 17 January.<ref name=\"Tauber373\">Tauber 1991, p. 373.</ref> Shallash then left for [[Aleppo]].<ref name=\"Tauber373\"/>\n\nAngry at this perceived injustice, Shallash returned to Deir ez-Zor in March to incite against Mukhlis.<ref name=\"Tauber374\">Tauber 1991, p. 374.</ref> He used an incident where Mukhlis confiscated smuggled gold from a group of Syrian merchants to raise opposition against him. However, Shallash and his supporters were expelled and headed northward to their tribal encampment at [[al-Tibni]].<ref name=\"Tauber374\"/> There, he raised a 600-man force and continually agitated against Mukhlis.<ref name=\"Tauber374\"/> Later, Shallash was falsely implicated in an incident where disguised Iraqi officers robbed an Iraqi Jew in Deir ez-Zor.<ref name=\"Tauber374\"/> This prompted him to castigate and threaten Mukhlis; the latter was wary of Shallash and every time the latter visited his family in Deir ez-Zor, Mukhlis would remain home.<ref name=\"Tauber374\"/> Attempts by al-Ahd to mediate between Shallash and Mukhlis failed, but in June 1920 Faisal persuaded Shallash to consult with him in Damascus.<ref name=\"Tauber375\">Tauber 1991, p. 375.</ref> During the meeting, Shallash agreed to head a tribal delegation to [[Ibn Saud]], thus removing Shallash far from Deir ez-Zor.<ref name=\"Tauber375\"/>\n\n==Resistance against the French==\n===Early activities===\nThe French defeated the motley Arab Army at the [[Battle of Maysalun]] in July 1920, after which Faisal's government collapsed and the French took control of the country. In the meantime, the [[Hananu Revolt]] continued around Aleppo and Shallash had formed his own rebel band in the Jazira.<ref name=\"Khoury108\"/> However, he moved to British-held [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] in the aftermath of Maysalun to escape a French arrest warrant.<ref>Provence 2011, p. 219.</ref> From early 1921, he acted as an intermediary between [[Ibrahim Hananu]] and Emir [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]] of Transjordan.<ref name=\"Khoury108\"/> \n\n===Commander in the Great Syrian Revolt===\nShallash moved back to Syria in September 1925,<ref name=\"Provence99\">Provence 2005, p. 99.</ref> to join the [[Great Syrian Revolt]].<ref name=\"Provence220\">Provence 2011, p. 220.</ref> According to Provence, <blockquote>He [Shallash] fought in the revolt and mobilized peasants, nomads, and villagers throughout Syria with a complicated and apparently potent mix of nationalism, popular religious fervor, evocations of Arab honor, Kemalist enthusiasm, and class warfare against big landlords aligned with the French Mandatory government.<ref name=\"Provence220\"/></blockquote>\n\nShallash's forces formed one of the four main bands active in the greater Damascus region.<ref>Neep 2012, pp. 80\u201381.</ref><ref>Provence 2005, p. 110.</ref> He joined with Fawzi al-Qawuqji's band following the latter's [[1925 Hama uprising|defeat in Hama]] in early October.<ref name=\"Provence99\"/> Meanwhile, rebels in the [[Ghouta]] led by [[Hasan al-Kharrat]] and [[Nasib al-Bakri]] were poised to attack and capture Damascus from the French and requested backing from Qawuqji and the [[Druze]] warriors of [[Sultan al-Atrash]].<ref name=\"Provence10203\">Provence 2005, pp. 102\u2013103.</ref> Qawuqji and Shallash headed toward Damascus from Hama's eastern countryside, but Bakri and Kharrat launched their assault before they arrived.<ref name=\"Provence10203\"/> After Kharrat captured [[al-Shaghour]], he was joined by Shallash and twenty of his Bedouin horsemen; the combined force then seized the [[Azm Palace]], headquarters of High-Commissioner [[Maurice Sarrail]], who was absent at the time.<ref>Provence, p. 103.</ref> After the French aerial bombardment of Damascus, Shallash condemned the action, stating: \n\n<blockquote>With cannons and aeroplanes you bombed a large city like Damascus without any warning: this has turned all of Syria against you, and irritated the whole Muslim world and made you a laughing stock of Nations, because you forgot the simplest of international laws. ... If General Sarrail is a stupid idiot, is it not your duty to warn him of the damage you would suffer and the ill reputation which would result for France in the Orient? You have lost the confidence of the Muslims and the Christians in all of Syria. By your act of barbarism, you have given a powerful weapon to the Muslim world and to the Power which works against you.<ref>Neep 2012, p. 62.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Activities in the Anti-Lebanon Mountains===\nBy November, Shallash and his tribal fighters joined forces with Jum'a Sawsaq; the latter was the former ''[[mukhtar]]'' (headman) of [[Rankus]] and led a rebel band whose area of operations extended from [[an-Nabk]] southward to [[Zabadani]].<ref name=\"Provence116\">Provence 2005, p. 116.</ref> Their combined forces numbered between 600 and 1,000 Bedouin and peasant fighters, and both Shallash and Sawsaq declared themselves, with al-Atrash's sanction, joint commanders of a \"National Army\" brigade.<ref name=\"Provence116\"/> According to Provence, \"the French viewed this development with horror\" since the formation had the potential to attract a much larger following of nationalists and gain funding from pan-Arab associations.<ref name=\"Provence116\"/>\n\nThroughout November, Shallash secretly entered the villages of the [[Qalamoun Mountains]] at night to recruit fighters, attack [[gendarmes]], plunder local Mandate headquarters and the homes of French-friendly individuals.<ref name=\"Provence116\"/> He often called these villages to take up an armed struggle like that of Mustafa Kemal and comparing their respective villages to [[Ankara]] in 1920, the scene of Turkish anti-colonialist insurgency.<ref name=\"Provence116\"/> According to French intelligence reports, Shallash's calls were highly popular to both Muslim and Christian villagers.<ref name=\"Provence116\"/> One historian even suggests that he \"had become a kind of Robin Hood figure of the insurgency\" given his blend of \"patriotism and nationalism with a mix of social justice, popular religious fervor, and class warfare.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Great Syrian Revolt and the Rise of Arab Nationalism|last=Provence|first=Michael|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Austin|pages=134}}</ref>\n\n===Intra-rebel disputes and surrender===\nShallash surrendered to the French Mandatory authorities in 1926.<ref name=\"Provence220\"/> According to Shallash, \"plots and tricks forced him to surrender\".<ref name=\"Provence220\"/>\n\n==Later life and death==\nHe was held by the authorities in [[Beirut]] until 1937.<ref name=\"Provence220\"/> Shallash commanded another uprising against the French in Deir ez-Zor in support of the [[1941 Iraqi coup d'\u00e9tat|Rashid Ali coup in Baghdad]] in 1941.<ref name=\"Provence220\"/> However, the revolt was put down, and Shallash was captured.<ref name=\"Provence220\"/> He was jailed in Beirut again, and released in 1946, the year Syria became independent.<ref name=\"Provence220\"/> Shallash also died that year.<ref>Moubayed 2006, p. 394.</ref> A biography of Shallash, ''Ramadan al-Shallash: Ahad Abtal al-Tarikh al-Arabi'' [Ramadan Shallash: A Hero of Arab History], written by Fa'iz al-Shallash was published in [[Cairo]] in 2001.<ref>Neep 2012, p. 81, n. 53.</ref> \n\n==References==\n<div class=\"reflist4\" style=\"height: 220px;

In 1916, he joined the [[Arab Revolt|Arab independence movement]] of [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Sharif Hussein]]. Three years later, he led efforts to ensure Deir ez-Zor and its environs become part of [[Arab Kingdom of Syria|Syria]]; to that end, he and his [[Bedouin]] fighters expelled the British from the city without apparent sanction from Hussein's son, Emir [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]]. He was consequently dismissed from Deir ez-Zor but continued his efforts nonetheless.\n\nAfter France toppled Faisal's government and took over Syria in 1920, Shallash moved to [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]]. He served as the intermediary between that country's emir and Faisal's brother, [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]], and the [[Hananu Revolt|northern Syrian revolt]] leader [[Ibrahim Hananu]]. With the launch of the Great Syrian Revolt, Shallash returned to command his own rebel band. He participated in the rebels' brief capture of [[Damascus]] and later led operations in the [[Anti-Lebanon Mountains]]. He was accused by rebel leaders [[Nasib al-Bakri]] and [[Hasan al-Kharrat]] of plundering [[Ghouta]] villages and dismissed from command. Not long after, he surrendered to the French and encouraged his former comrades to do the same.\n\n==Early life and education==\nShallash was born in al-Shumaytiyah, [[Deir ez-Zor Governorate]], likely in 1879.<ref name=\"Provence211\">Provence 2011, p. 211.</ref> His autobiography states that he was born in 1869, but this was likely a typo.<ref>Provence, p. 223, n. 38.</ref> His father was the [[sheikh]] (chieftain) of the Al Bu Saraya (also spelled \"Albu Saray\"), a [[Bedouin]] tribe that inhabited the area around Deir ez-Zor.<ref name=\"Khoury108\">Khoury 1987, p. 108.</ref> Shallash graduated from [[Istanbul]]'s Military School for Bedouin Chiefs in 1898.<ref name=\"Provence211\"/> His five years of military schooling focused on Islamic education, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] culture and history, and basic reading and writing courses.<ref name=\"Provence212\">Provence 2011, p. 212.</ref> Historian Michael Provence holds that due to his older age and other factors, Shallash \"certainly would have needed the specialized remedial curriculum of the Tribal School\".<ref name=\"Provence212\"/> It was at the military academy that he likely met a number of [[Arab]] officers who later became his associates, including [[Yasin al-Hashimi]], [[Fawzi al-Qawuqji]], [[Sa'id al-'As]] and [[Jafar al-Askari|Ja'far al-Askari]].<ref name=\"Provence212\"/>\n\n==Military career==\n===Service with the Ottomans===\nAfter graduating, Shallash was made a ''y\u00fczba\u015f\u0131'' (captain) in the [[Ottoman Army (1861\u20131922)|Ottoman Army]]; this was a high rank for a new graduate and its attainment was due to the imperial favor shown to the sons of rural sheikhs in the military.<ref name=\"Provence212\"/> In 1911, he was sent to fight in [[Ottoman Libya|Libya]] against the [[Italian invasion of Libya|Italian invasion]]. There, he encountered the prominent Ottoman officers [[Aziz Ali al-Misri]], [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturk|Mustafa Kemal]] and [[Enver Pasha]].<ref name=\"Provence212\"/> After the Ottoman defeat in Libya, Shallash was reassigned to the [[First Balkan War|Balkan front]], where he commanded a unit of soldiers from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].<ref name=\"Provence212\"/> Sources are not clear about Shallash's service with the Ottomans during [[World War I]].<ref name=\"Provence212\"/>\n\n===Service with the Hashemites===\nShallash himself asserted that he defected from the Ottomans in 1916 to serve in the [[Sharifian army]] of the [[Hashemites|Hashemite]] leader [[Sharif Husayn]].<ref name=\"Provence212\"/><ref name=\"Moubayed393\"/> Accordingly, he fought at [[Medina]] during the [[Arab Revolt]] against the Ottomans.<ref name=\"Khoury108\"/> He served as a commander and a private [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] of Sharif Husayn until 1918, following the British-backed Sharifian conquest of [[Ottoman Syria]].<ref name=\"Moubayed393\">Moubayed 2006, p. 393.</ref> Sharif Husayn's son, Emir [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]] set up a rudimentary government in [[Damascus]] in October-November 1918 with the support of the allied and clandestine [[Arab nationalist]] societies, [[al-Fatat]] and [[Covenant Society|al-Ahd]].<ref name=\"Tauber365\">Tauber 1991, p. 365.</ref> Al-Shallash had been a member of the latter group, which mostly consisted of ex-Ottoman officers from the empire's Arab territories.<ref name=\"Tauber365\"/>\n\nIn late May 1919, Shallash returned to Deir ez-Zor to rally support for the Arab government in Damascus and stir opposition to British forces among the largest Bedouin tribes in the [[Upper Mesopotamia|Jazira]] region, the [[Shammar]] and [[`Anazzah]].<ref name=\"Tauber365\"/> He went as far north as [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Turkish]]-held [[Urfa]] to gather tribal allegiance for the Arab government and support for Damascus's annexation of the regions near British-held [[Iraq]].<ref name=\"Tauber365\"/> He received the support of several tribal sheikhs, but none agreed to accompany him back to Damascus to demonstrate their allegiance to Faisal, and many favored their regions becoming part of Iraq.<ref name=\"Tauber365\"/>\n\n===Actions in Deir ez-Zor===\n{{main|Occupation of Zor}}\n====Raid====\n\nSyria was slated to come under French rule as per the secret [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]] with the British, while the latter would control Iraq and Palestine. In September 1919, the British and French agreed that the former would withdraw its troops from Syria to make way for the French, who by then had only deployed along Syria's northern coastline and in [[Mount Lebanon]].<ref name=\"Tauber366\">Tauber 1991, p. 366.</ref> Faisal and the Arab nationalists were incensed at the division of Arab territories among the colonial powers, having been promised by the British independence in return for revolting against the Ottomans.<ref name=\"Tauber366\"/> The impending withdrawal of British forces prompted al-Ahd's central leadership to use the opportunity to annex Deir ez-Zor to Syria and the al-Ahd leadership chose Shallash to lead the Arab charge in Jazira.<ref name=\"Tauber366\"/> Al-Ahd's top leader and the chief of staff of the Arab Army of Syria, Yasin al-Hashimi, directed Ja'far al-Askari, the Arab governor of [[Aleppo Vilayet]], to appoint Shallash governor of the [[Raqqa District]], thereby giving him official cover for his operation in Deir ez-Zor.<ref name=\"Tauber366\"/> Al-Hashimi tasked Shallash with taking over the city, transferring to him some Iraqi officers and funds to gain the support of local Bedouin tribes.<ref name=\"Tauber366\"/>\n\nOn 12 November 1919, Shallash departed Damascus with one hundred camel-mounted troops to [[Raqqa]], from which [[Occupation of Zor|he set out eastward to Deir ez-Zor]] with forty troops in December.<ref name=\"Tauber366\"/> By then, the city was held by a British military governor, Captain Chamier. As Shallash prepared for his assault on Deir ez-Zor, he spurned tribal leaders in the vicinity to oppose the British and handed them a letter signed by Emir Zayd, Faisal's brother and placeholder while he was in Europe, that asked for them to assist Shallash, the \"military governor of the ''qada\u02bf'' [district] of the Raqqa region, the Khabur river, and the Euphrates\".<ref name=\"Tauber366\"/> Captain Chamier received intelligence of Shallash's activities and in response, arrested Deir ez-Zor's mayor on suspicion of collaboration with Shallash. Furthermore, on 10 December, Chamier requested support via telegraph from the British regional headquarters in [[Albu Kamal]] and [[Baghdad]].<ref name=\"Tauber366\"/> Shallash had the telegraph lines to Deir ez-Zor cut soon after.<ref name=\"Tauber367\">Tauber 1991, p. 367.</ref>\n\nOn 11 December, at 3:00 am, between 500 and 2,000 Bedouin tribesmen raided Deir ez-Zor, entering from its southern entrance, i.e. from the desert instead of the population centers to the east, west and north. The tribesmen were joined by townspeople and together they burned down the local British headquarters, and entered the town's hospital, two mosques and a church. Cash stored in the government house was seized, but the town [[bazaar]] was not looted. The tribesmen raided the local prison and freed its inmates. In the fighting, thirty rebels were killed and sixty wounded when a fuel tank was ignited and exploded near them at 5:00 am. Shallash did not command the tribesmen, but was on standby outside of Deir ez-Zor. Chamier and his relatively small group of officers and troops, along with sixty local gendarmes, barricaded themselves in their barracks. They had two armored cars and two machine guns. The armored car that was sent by Chamier to impose order inside Deir ez-Zor was neutralized. Meanwhile, about forty of the gendarmes defected and fled the barracks. At 10:00 am, the barracks came under rebel fire and Chamier's last machine gun was heavily damaged.<ref name=\"Tauber367\"/>\n\nWith supplies running out, Chamier was obliged to negotiate a truce with the townspeople and local sheikhs at the mayor's residence.<ref name=\"Tauber367\"/> Shallash entered the town later in the afternoon, declared the district's independence and raised the [[flag of the Arab Revolt|Arab flag]] over the British headquarters.<ref name=\"Tauber367\"/> He told Chamier that the people of Deir ez-Zor had requested his intervention and demanded the British withdraw.<ref name=\"Tauber367\"/> He also demanded that Syria's border be extended eastward toward [[Anah]].<ref name=\"Tauber367\"/> Chamier agreed as long Shallash guaranteed the safety of the Christian community and the Arabs who had served the British.<ref name=\"Tauber367\"/> Shallash held the British hostage pending an official  assurance that no punitive action would be taken against the city.<ref name=\"Tauber367\"/>\n\n====Further offensives and administration====\nIntent on making Albu Kamal a part of Syria, Shallash dispatched two [[column (military)|column]]s to drive the British out of that city.<ref name=\"Tauber369\">Tauber 1991, p. 369.</ref> On 13 December, they captured [[Mayadin]], before proceeding to Albu Kamal the next day. By then, its forty-man British garrison withdrew.<ref name=\"Tauber369\"/> Shallash invited the [[Dulaim]] tribal sheikhs to join in his efforts against the British, but they rejected and condemned him.<ref name=\"Tauber369\"/> Meanwhile, the tribal forces fought over plunder, weakening them and allowing the British to recapture the city with little resistance by 21 December.<ref name=\"Tauber369\"/> Mayadin remained under Shallash's control.<ref name=\"Tauber369\"/> \n\nThe tribal sheikhs around Deir ez-Zor were distributed funds by Shallash to keep their forces deployed in the city.<ref name=\"Tauber368\">Tauber 1991, p. 368.</ref> However, most of the sheikhs retreated to their encampments within a few days, leaving Shallash only with the soldiers he arrived with and Al Bu Saray tribesmen.<ref name=\"Tauber368\"/> A ten-man council of local dignitaries and sheikhs was formed to administer the city.<ref name=\"Tauber368\"/> Funding was provided by Turkish and other foreign donors. However, the local inhabitants grew resentful at Shallash's interference in their affairs.<ref name=\"Tauber368\"/> This, coupled with the threat of an opportunistic Turkish invasion of Deir ez-Zor due to the concentration of troops to the north, prompted Shallash to request British financial support to fend off such an invasion; to that end, he met with Chamier on 19 December.<ref name=\"Tauber368\"/> The British ultimately refused him assistance, and Faisal, having been informed of events, directed Emir Zayd to dissociate the Arab government from Shallash's actions and order his arrest.<ref name=\"Tauber368\"/> The British communicated that they had no interest in Deir ez-Zor and that the Arab government should deal with Shallash.<ref name=\"Tauber368\"/> On 25 December, Shallash agreed to release the British hostages after being guaranteed of no reprisals by the British.<ref name=\"Tauber369\"/>\n\n====Dismissal====\nShallash was not satisfied with the Arab\u2013British agreement that left Albu Kamal, [[Al-Qa'im (town)|al-Qa'im]] and Anah on the Iraqi side of the border.<ref name=\"Tauber372\">Tauber 1991, p. 372.</ref> He sent men to collect taxes, raid British-held parts of the Jazira and destroy British transport lines.<ref name=\"Tauber372\"/> He also threatened to kill the British commander in Albu Kamal should he not withdraw, and to take the fight to [[Mosul]] in the north. The British warned Shallash of major repercussions should he continue his campaign; Shallash responded on 11 January 1920 by ordering a raid against Albu Kamal.<ref name=\"Tauber372\"/> The British counterattacked and Shallash's men withdrew to Mayadin.<ref name=\"Tauber372\"/> The following day, the Arab government ordered Shallash's dismissal, whilst protesting Albu Kamal's exclusion from Syria.<ref name=\"Tauber372\"/> Al-Ahd and Emir Zayd agreed that [[Mawlud Mukhlis]] replace Shallash, and the former entered Deir ez-Zor on 17 January.<ref name=\"Tauber373\">Tauber 1991, p. 373.</ref> Shallash then left for [[Aleppo]].<ref name=\"Tauber373\"/>\n\nAngry at this perceived injustice, Shallash returned to Deir ez-Zor in March to incite against Mukhlis.<ref name=\"Tauber374\">Tauber 1991, p. 374.</ref> He used an incident where Mukhlis confiscated smuggled gold from a group of Syrian merchants to raise opposition against him. However, Shallash and his supporters were expelled and headed northward to their tribal encampment at [[al-Tibni]].<ref name=\"Tauber374\"/> There, he raised a 600-man force and continually agitated against Mukhlis.<ref name=\"Tauber374\"/> Later, Shallash was falsely implicated in an incident where disguised Iraqi officers robbed an Iraqi Jew in Deir ez-Zor.<ref name=\"Tauber374\"/> This prompted him to castigate and threaten Mukhlis; the latter was wary of Shallash and every time the latter visited his family in Deir ez-Zor, Mukhlis would remain home.<ref name=\"Tauber374\"/> Attempts by al-Ahd to mediate between Shallash and Mukhlis failed, but in June 1920 Faisal persuaded Shallash to consult with him in Damascus.<ref name=\"Tauber375\">Tauber 1991, p. 375.</ref> During the meeting, Shallash agreed to head a tribal delegation to [[Ibn Saud]], thus removing Shallash far from Deir ez-Zor.<ref name=\"Tauber375\"/>\n\n==Resistance against the French==\n===Early activities===\nThe French defeated the motley Arab Army at the [[Battle of Maysalun]] in July 1920, after which Faisal's government collapsed and the French took control of the country. In the meantime, the [[Hananu Revolt]] continued around Aleppo and Shallash had formed his own rebel band in the Jazira.<ref name=\"Khoury108\"/> However, he moved to British-held [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] in the aftermath of Maysalun to escape a French arrest warrant.<ref>Provence 2011, p. 219.</ref> From early 1921, he acted as an intermediary between [[Ibrahim Hananu]] and Emir [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]] of Transjordan.<ref name=\"Khoury108\"/> \n\n===Commander in the Great Syrian Revolt===\nShallash moved back to Syria in September 1925,<ref name=\"Provence99\">Provence 2005, p. 99.</ref> to join the [[Great Syrian Revolt]].<ref name=\"Provence220\">Provence 2011, p. 220.</ref> According to Provence, <blockquote>He [Shallash] fought in the revolt and mobilized peasants, nomads, and villagers throughout Syria with a complicated and apparently potent mix of nationalism, popular religious fervor, evocations of Arab honor, Kemalist enthusiasm, and class warfare against big landlords aligned with the French Mandatory government.<ref name=\"Provence220\"/></blockquote>\n\nShallash's forces formed one of the four main bands active in the greater Damascus region.<ref>Neep 2012, pp. 80\u201381.</ref><ref>Provence 2005, p. 110.</ref> He joined with Fawzi al-Qawuqji's band following the latter's [[1925 Hama uprising|defeat in Hama]] in early October.<ref name=\"Provence99\"/> Meanwhile, rebels in the [[Ghouta]] led by [[Hasan al-Kharrat]] and [[Nasib al-Bakri]] were poised to attack and capture Damascus from the French and requested backing from Qawuqji and the [[Druze]] warriors of [[Sultan al-Atrash]].<ref name=\"Provence10203\">Provence 2005, pp. 102\u2013103.</ref> Qawuqji and Shallash headed toward Damascus from Hama's eastern countryside, but Bakri and Kharrat launched their assault before they arrived.<ref name=\"Provence10203\"/> After Kharrat captured [[al-Shaghour]], he was joined by Shallash and twenty of his Bedouin horsemen; the combined force then seized the [[Azm Palace]], headquarters of High-Commissioner [[Maurice Sarrail]], who was absent at the time.<ref>Provence, p. 103.</ref> After the French aerial bombardment of Damascus, Shallash condemned the action, stating: \n\n<blockquote>With cannons and aeroplanes you bombed a large city like Damascus without any warning: this has turned all of Syria against you, and irritated the whole Muslim world and made you a laughing stock of Nations, because you forgot the simplest of international laws. ... If General Sarrail is a stupid idiot, is it not your duty to warn him of the damage you would suffer and the ill reputation which would result for France in the Orient? You have lost the confidence of the Muslims and the Christians in all of Syria. By your act of barbarism, you have given a powerful weapon to the Muslim world and to the Power which works against you.<ref>Neep 2012, p. 62.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Activities in the Anti-Lebanon Mountains===\nBy November, Shallash and his tribal fighters joined forces with Jum'a Sawsaq; the latter was the former ''[[mukhtar]]'' (headman) of [[Rankus]] and led a rebel band whose area of operations extended from [[an-Nabk]] southward to [[Zabadani]].<ref name=\"Provence116\">Provence 2005, p. 116.</ref> Their combined forces numbered between 600 and 1,000 Bedouin and peasant fighters, and both Shallash and Sawsaq declared themselves, with al-Atrash's sanction, joint commanders of a \"National Army\" brigade.<ref name=\"Provence116\"/> According to Provence, \"the French viewed this development with horror\" since the formation had the potential to attract a much larger following of nationalists and gain funding from pan-Arab associations.<ref name=\"Provence116\"/>\n\nThroughout November, Shallash secretly entered the villages of the [[Qalamoun Mountains]] at night to recruit fighters, attack [[gendarmes]], plunder local Mandate headquarters and the homes of French-friendly individuals.<ref name=\"Provence116\"/> He often called these villages to take up an armed struggle like that of Mustafa Kemal and comparing their respective villages to [[Ankara]] in 1920, the scene of Turkish anti-colonialist insurgency.<ref name=\"Provence116\"/> According to French intelligence reports, Shallash's calls were highly popular to both Muslim and Christian villagers.<ref name=\"Provence116\"/> One historian even suggests that he \"had become a kind of Robin Hood figure of the insurgency\" given his blend of \"patriotism and nationalism with a mix of social justice, popular religious fervor, and class warfare.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Great Syrian Revolt and the Rise of Arab Nationalism|last=Provence|first=Michael|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Austin|pages=134}}</ref>\n\n===Intra-rebel disputes and surrender===\nShallash surrendered to the French Mandatory authorities in 1926.<ref name=\"Provence220\"/> According to Shallash, \"plots and tricks forced him to surrender\".<ref name=\"Provence220\"/>\n\n==Later life and death==\nHe was held by the authorities in [[Beirut]] until 1937.<ref name=\"Provence220\"/> Shallash commanded another uprising against the French in Deir ez-Zor in support of the [[1941 Iraqi coup d'\u00e9tat|Rashid Ali coup in Baghdad]] in 1941.<ref name=\"Provence220\"/> However, the revolt was put down, and Shallash was captured.<ref name=\"Provence220\"/> He was jailed in Beirut again, and released in 1946, the year Syria became independent.<ref name=\"Provence220\"/> Shallash also died that year.<ref>Moubayed 2006, p. 394.</ref> A biography of Shallash, ''Ramadan al-Shallash: Ahad Abtal al-Tarikh al-Arabi'' [Ramadan Shallash: A Hero of Arab History], written by Fa'iz al-Shallash was published in [[Cairo]] in 2001.<ref>Neep 2012, p. 81, n. 53.</ref> \n\n==References==\n<div class=\"reflist4\" style=\"height: 220px;

Except for [[Euglenozoa]], they are all non-photosynthetic.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nMost excavates are unicellular, heterotrophic flagellates. Only the [[Euglenozoa]] are photosynthetic. In some (particularly anaerobic intestinal parasites), the mitochondria have been greatly reduced.<ref name=Ancestor/> They often lack \"classical\" [[mitochondria]]\u2014these organisms are often referred to as \"amitochondriate\", although most retain a mitochondrial organelle in greatly modified form (e.g. a [[hydrogenosome]] or [[mitosome]]). Among those with mitochondria, the mitochondrial [[crista]]e may be tubular, discoidal, or in some cases, laminar. Most excavates have two, four, or more [[flagellum|flagella]]<ref name=\"Simpson2003\" /> and many have a conspicuous ventral feeding groove with a characteristic [[ultrastructure]], supported by [[microtubule]]s (with the term \"excavate\" deriving from the organisms showing clear evidence of this \"excavated\" feeding groove).<ref name=\"Simpson1999\" /><ref name=\"pmid11931142\" /> However, various groups that lack these traits may be considered excavates based on genetic evidence (primarily phylogenetic trees of molecular sequences).<ref name=\"pmid11931142\"/>\n\nThe [[Acrasidae]] slime molds are the only excavates to exhibit limited multicellularity. Like other cellular [[slime molds]], they live most of their life as single cells, but will sometimes assemble into larger clusters.\n\n==Classification==\n{{See also|Eukaryote#Phylogeny|wikispecies:Excavata}}\nExcavates are classified into six major subdivisions at the phylum/class level. These are shown in the table below. An additional group, Malawimonadida (e.g. ''[[Malawimonas]]''), may also be included amongst excavates, though phylogenetic evidence is equivocal.\n{| class=wikitable\n! Kingdom/Superphylum !!

The oxymonad ''[[Monocercomonoides]]'' is reported to have completely lost homologous organelles.\n\n===Monophyly===\nExcavate relationships are still uncertain; it is possible that they are not a [[monophyletic]] group. The monophyly of the excavates is far from clear, although there seem to be several clades within the excavates that are monophyletic.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Evaluating Support for the Current Classification of Eukaryotic Diversity |author1=Laura Wegener Parfrey |author2=Erika Barbero |author3=Elyse Lasser |author4=Micah Dunthorn |author5=Debashish Bhattacharya |author6=David J Patterson |author7=Laura A Katz | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0020220 | journal = PLoS Genet. |year=2006| volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = e220 | pmid = 17194223 | pmc = 1713255 }}</ref>\n\nCertain excavates are often considered among the most primitive [[eukaryote]]s, based partly on their placement in many evolutionary trees. This could encourage proposals that excavates are a [[paraphyletic]] grade that includes the ancestors of other living eukaryotes. However, the placement of certain excavates as 'early branches' may be an analysis artifact caused by [[long branch attraction]], as has been seen with some other groups, for example, microsporidia.\n\n===Malawimonads===\nThe [[Malawimonas|malawimonads]] are generally considered to be members of Excavata owing to their typical excavate morphology, and phylogenetic affinity to other excavate groups in some molecular phylogenies. However, their position among eukaryotes remains elusive.<ref name=simpson/>.  \n\n===Ancyromonads===\n[[Ancyromonadida|Ancyromonads]] are small free-living cells with a narrow longitudinal groove down one side of the cell.  The ancyromonad groove is '''not''' used for 'suspension feeding', unlike in 'typical excavates' (e.g. malawimonads, jakobids, ''Trimastix'', ''Carpediemonas'', ''Kiperferlia'', etc).  Ancyromonads instead capture prokaryotes attached to surfaces. The phylogenetic placement of ancyromonads is poorly understood (in 2020), however some phylogenetic analyses place them as close relatives of malawimonads.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Matthew W|last2=Heiss|first2=Aaron A|last3=Kamikawa|first3=Ryoma|last4=Inagaki|first4=Yuji|last5=Yabuki|first5=Akinori|last6=Tice|first6=Alexander K|last7=Shiratori|first7=Takashi|last8=Ishida|first8=Ken-Ichiro|last9=Hashimoto|first9=Tetsuo|last10=Simpson|first10=Alastair|last11=Roger|first11=Andrew|date=2018-01-19|title=Phylogenomics Places Orphan Protistan Lineages in a Novel Eukaryotic Super-Group|journal=Genome Biology and Evolution|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=427\u2013433|doi=10.1093/gbe/evy014|issn=1759-6653|pmc=5793813|pmid=29360967}}</ref> Consequently, it is possible that ancyromonads are relevant for understand the evolution of 'true' excavates.\n\n===Cladogram===\nHere is a proposed cladogram for the positioning of the Excavata, with the Eukaryote root in the excavates, mainly following Cavalier-Smith.<ref name=\"Cavalier-Smith 275\u2013296\">{{Cite journal|last=Cavalier-Smith|first=Thomas|last2=Chao|first2=Ema E.|last3=Lewis|first3=Rhodri|date=2016-06-01|title=187-gene phylogeny of protozoan phylum Amoebozoa reveals a new class (Cutosea) of deep-branching, ultrastructurally unique, enveloped marine Lobosa and clarifies amoeba evolution|url= |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=99|pages=275\u2013296|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2016.03.023|pmid=27001604}}</ref><ref name=\"Derelle E693\u2013E699\">{{Cite journal|last=Derelle|first=Romain|last2=Torruella|first2=Guifr\u00e9|last3=Klime\u0161|first3=Vladim\u00edr|last4=Brinkmann|first4=Henner|last5=Kim|first5=Eunsoo|last6=Vl\u010dek|first6=\u010cestm\u00edr|last7=Lang|first7=B.

Only the [[Euglenozoa]] are photosynthetic. In some (particularly anaerobic intestinal parasites), the mitochondria have been greatly reduced.<ref name=Ancestor/> They often lack \"classical\" [[mitochondria]]\u2014these organisms are often referred to as \"amitochondriate\", although most retain a mitochondrial organelle in greatly modified form (e.g. a [[hydrogenosome]] or [[mitosome]]). Among those with mitochondria, the mitochondrial [[crista]]e may be tubular, discoidal, or in some cases, laminar. Most excavates have two, four, or more [[flagellum|flagella]]<ref name=\"Simpson2003\" /> and many have a conspicuous ventral feeding groove with a characteristic [[ultrastructure]], supported by [[microtubule]]s (with the term \"excavate\" deriving from the organisms showing clear evidence of this \"excavated\" feeding groove).<ref name=\"Simpson1999\" /><ref name=\"pmid11931142\" /> However, various groups that lack these traits may be considered excavates based on genetic evidence (primarily phylogenetic trees of molecular sequences).<ref name=\"pmid11931142\"/>\n\nThe [[Acrasidae]] slime molds are the only excavates to exhibit limited multicellularity. Like other cellular [[slime molds]], they live most of their life as single cells, but will sometimes assemble into larger clusters.\n\n==Classification==\n{{See also|Eukaryote#Phylogeny|wikispecies:Excavata}}\nExcavates are classified into six major subdivisions at the phylum/class level. These are shown in the table below. An additional group, Malawimonadida (e.g. ''[[Malawimonas]]''), may also be included amongst excavates, though phylogenetic evidence is equivocal.\n{| class=wikitable\n! Kingdom/Superphylum !!

The oxymonad ''[[Monocercomonoides]]'' is reported to have completely lost homologous organelles.\n\n===Monophyly===\nExcavate relationships are still uncertain; it is possible that they are not a [[monophyletic]] group. The monophyly of the excavates is far from clear, although there seem to be several clades within the excavates that are monophyletic.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Evaluating Support for the Current Classification of Eukaryotic Diversity |author1=Laura Wegener Parfrey |author2=Erika Barbero |author3=Elyse Lasser |author4=Micah Dunthorn |author5=Debashish Bhattacharya |author6=David J Patterson |author7=Laura A Katz | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0020220 | journal = PLoS Genet. |year=2006| volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = e220 | pmid = 17194223 | pmc = 1713255 }}</ref>\n\nCertain excavates are often considered among the most primitive [[eukaryote]]s, based partly on their placement in many evolutionary trees. This could encourage proposals that excavates are a [[paraphyletic]] grade that includes the ancestors of other living eukaryotes. However, the placement of certain excavates as 'early branches' may be an analysis artifact caused by [[long branch attraction]], as has been seen with some other groups, for example, microsporidia.\n\n===Malawimonads===\nThe [[Malawimonas|malawimonads]] are generally considered to be members of Excavata owing to their typical excavate morphology, and phylogenetic affinity to other excavate groups in some molecular phylogenies. However, their position among eukaryotes remains elusive.<ref name=simpson/>.  \n\n===Ancyromonads===\n[[Ancyromonadida|Ancyromonads]] are small free-living cells with a narrow longitudinal groove down one side of the cell.  The ancyromonad groove is '''not''' used for 'suspension feeding', unlike in 'typical excavates' (e.g. malawimonads, jakobids, ''Trimastix'', ''Carpediemonas'', ''Kiperferlia'', etc).  Ancyromonads instead capture prokaryotes attached to surfaces. The phylogenetic placement of ancyromonads is poorly understood (in 2020), however some phylogenetic analyses place them as close relatives of malawimonads.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Matthew W|last2=Heiss|first2=Aaron A|last3=Kamikawa|first3=Ryoma|last4=Inagaki|first4=Yuji|last5=Yabuki|first5=Akinori|last6=Tice|first6=Alexander K|last7=Shiratori|first7=Takashi|last8=Ishida|first8=Ken-Ichiro|last9=Hashimoto|first9=Tetsuo|last10=Simpson|first10=Alastair|last11=Roger|first11=Andrew|date=2018-01-19|title=Phylogenomics Places Orphan Protistan Lineages in a Novel Eukaryotic Super-Group|journal=Genome Biology and Evolution|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=427\u2013433|doi=10.1093/gbe/evy014|issn=1759-6653|pmc=5793813|pmid=29360967}}</ref> Consequently, it is possible that ancyromonads are relevant for understand the evolution of 'true' excavates.\n\n===Cladogram===\nHere is a proposed cladogram for the positioning of the Excavata, with the Eukaryote root in the excavates, mainly following Cavalier-Smith.<ref name=\"Cavalier-Smith 275\u2013296\">{{Cite journal|last=Cavalier-Smith|first=Thomas|last2=Chao|first2=Ema E.|last3=Lewis|first3=Rhodri|date=2016-06-01|title=187-gene phylogeny of protozoan phylum Amoebozoa reveals a new class (Cutosea) of deep-branching, ultrastructurally unique, enveloped marine Lobosa and clarifies amoeba evolution|url= |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=99|pages=275\u2013296|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2016.03.023|pmid=27001604}}</ref><ref name=\"Derelle E693\u2013E699\">{{Cite journal|last=Derelle|first=Romain|last2=Torruella|first2=Guifr\u00e9|last3=Klime\u0161|first3=Vladim\u00edr|last4=Brinkmann|first4=Henner|last5=Kim|first5=Eunsoo|last6=Vl\u010dek|first6=\u010cestm\u00edr|last7=Lang|first7=B.

His friend introduces him to cinematographer Anay ([[Manu Rishi]]). With Anay's help, Sachin becomes an assistant to director [[Ramesh Sippy]]. Sachin's family, who are [[Marathi people|Marathi]] Brahmins, rent Jessie Thekekuttu's ([[Amy Jackson]]) house. Jessie is from a conservative [[Malayali]] [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church|Syrian Catholic]] \"Nasrani\" family from [[Alappuzha]], Kerala, that lives upstairs. Sachin falls in love with Jessie the moment he meets her. Sachin tries to interact with Jessie, who is afraid of speaking to men around her strict father and ends up angering Jessie. Unable to hide his feelings for her any longer, Sachin confesses his love for her, to which she does not respond. A few days later, Sachin learns from his sister that Jessie has gone to Kerala to visit her grandmother. He, along with Anay, ends up in Kerala to look for her. After several days, he finds her, apologises and she introduces him to her family in Kerala as her \"classmate\". Jessie denies she has any feelings for him but agrees to be his friend. On the train journey back home, however, the two get closer and share a passionate kiss. Sachin is convinced Jessie loves him; the two meet several times and Jessie begins to admit that she also likes Sachin, but wants to refrain from any problems because she knows her father wouldn't give her hand in marriage to a Hindu. Consequently, due to various misunderstandings between Jessie's brother and Sachin, her parents learn of their supposed affair. They fix a match and schedule her wedding. The day arrives and midway through the ceremony, Jessie refuses to marry the groom, displeasing everyone in her family. Sachin, who had, without anyone's knowledge, come to Kerala to witness the wedding is ecstatic and secretly visits Jessie at her home. It is then that Jessie admits she has indeed fallen in love with him. Sachin and Jessie continue to love each other without the knowledge of their parents.\n\nAt this point of time, Sachin goes to Goa on a 40-day shoot, where he gets busy. Meanwhile, the topic of Jessie's marriage comes up again at her home when the guy whom she refused to marry earlier pays them a visit. Panicking, Jessie calls Sachin and tells him that she wants to elope with him. Sachin, who he is travelling through less than ideal places, tells Jessie to stay in Mumbai for now, and that soon he would be back and they can discuss. Jessie stops taking Sachin's calls and so he goes back one night to check on Jessie. He comes to know that Jessie has decided to break up, as the relationship is not peaceful due to her parents' disapproval. She says she has agreed to marry a boy of her parents' choice. When Sachin pleads her not to do it, she tells him that a time had come when she was willing to elope, but the moment was gone. She doesn't want Sachin to wait for her, as he has his dreams to fulfill. Sachin later comes to know that she is married and settled abroad.\n\nTwo years later, Sachin meets Samantha ([[Samantha Ruth Prabhu]]). She falls in love with him but is rejected by Sachin who hasn't yet gotten over Jessie. He then comes up with a script for his first film, which happens to be his very own love story. He calls upon an actor ([[Ashwin Kakumanu]]) as the film's protagonist, Samantha as the female lead and Anay as the film's cinematographer, and the film is eventually titled ''Jessie''. While shooting for the film in [[Taj Mahal]], he sees Jessie and she comes to speak with him. She admits that she is not married and is still in love with him, and he too says she is still in his heart. Sachin proposes yet again and they get married the same day. This is actually revealed to be the end scene in Sachin's film \u2013 which Sachin and Jessie in real life are watching together in the theatre. After the film ends, Jessie praises Sachin for his efforts and the latter agrees to drop her home, implying that they are reunited.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Prateik Babbar]] as Sachin Kulkarni\n* [[Amy Jackson]] as Jessie Thekkekuttu\n* [[Shruti Bapna]] as Sister\n* [[Manu Rishi]] as Anay\n* [[Sachin Khedekar]] as Anand Kulkarni\n* [[Samantha Ruth Prabhu]] in a cameo appearance as Samantha ''\"Sam\"'', an actress who plays the female lead role in Sachin's debut film, ''Jessie''\n* [[Ashwin Kakumanu]] in a cameo appearance as himself, an actor who plays the main lead in ''Jessie'', Sachin's debut film\n* [[Babu Antony]] as Joseph Thekkekutu\n* [[Lakshmi Ramakrishnan]] as Mrs. Thekkekuttu (Jessie's mother)\n* [[Sriranjini (Tamil actress)|Sriranjini]] as Mrs. Kulkarni (Sachin's mother)\n* [[Ramesh Sippy]] as himself\n* [[Subbalakshmi]]\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nGautham Menon started working on ''Ekk Deewana Tha'', the Hindi remake of his Tamil film ''[[Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa]]'', in 2011, and his Telugu simultaneous version ''[[Ye Maaya Chesave]]'', with Prateik Babbar and Amy Jackson in the lead roles (for the Hindi version). ''Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa'' (Tamil) and ''Ye Maaya Chesave'' (Telugu) were considered to have changed the images of their lead actor pairs [[Silambarasan Rajendar]]-[[Trisha Krishnan]] and [[Naga Chaitanya]]-[[Samantha Ruth Prabhu|Samantha]] respectively. Though, the Hindi remake initially had Trisha Krishnan and [[Samantha Ruth Prabhu]] reprising their role, the actress was unceremoniously dropped from the project after a photo shoot and replaced by [[Amy Jackson]], who shot to fame with the Tamil film ''[[Madrasapattinam]]''.\n\nGautham Menon was trying out a 'look shoot' at the same locations where he shot ''Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa'' and ''Ye Maaya Chesave'', including a popular seaside restaurant on ECR, Chennai. A source close to the director said, \"This shoot was just to get the 'feel' of the film. The actual shoot will take place in Mumbai from next month.\" According to the sources, A R Rahman's original tunes will be retained for ''Ekk Deewana Tha'' as well, while the film also features Gautham Menon's regular technical team, consisting of art director [[Rajeevan]] and editor [[Anthony Gonsalves]].\n\nNoted poet, story and screenplay specialist, Javed Akhtar recently was in Chennai, supervising the script and writing the lyrics for the film. A source close to the development said, \"Javed saab and Gautham hit it off well. The lyricist's inputs will be taken into consideration as Gautham is particular that his film should not come across as a routine South Indian remake.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-11-19/news-interviews/28263435_1_hindi-version-amy-jackson-gautham-vasudev-menon |title=VTV's Hindi version kicks off \u2013 Times of India |publisher=[[The Times of India]] |date=19 November 2010 |accessdate=2011-09-26}}</ref>\n\nAmy Jackson, playing a [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani]] Christian in the film, said that, \"I'm very kicked about working with Gautham Menon. I've seen VTV [''Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa''] at least 15 times. ''Ekk Deewana Tha'' is a perfect launch pad for me in [[Bollywood]].

His friend introduces him to cinematographer Anay ([[Manu Rishi]]). With Anay's help, Sachin becomes an assistant to director [[Ramesh Sippy]]. Sachin's family, who are [[Marathi people|Marathi]] Brahmins, rent Jessie Thekekuttu's ([[Amy Jackson]]) house. Jessie is from a conservative [[Malayali]] [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church|Syrian Catholic]] \"Nasrani\" family from [[Alappuzha]], Kerala, that lives upstairs. Sachin falls in love with Jessie the moment he meets her. Sachin tries to interact with Jessie, who is afraid of speaking to men around her strict father and ends up angering Jessie. Unable to hide his feelings for her any longer, Sachin confesses his love for her, to which she does not respond. A few days later, Sachin learns from his sister that Jessie has gone to Kerala to visit her grandmother. He, along with Anay, ends up in Kerala to look for her. After several days, he finds her, apologises and she introduces him to her family in Kerala as her \"classmate\". Jessie denies she has any feelings for him but agrees to be his friend. On the train journey back home, however, the two get closer and share a passionate kiss. Sachin is convinced Jessie loves him; the two meet several times and Jessie begins to admit that she also likes Sachin, but wants to refrain from any problems because she knows her father wouldn't give her hand in marriage to a Hindu. Consequently, due to various misunderstandings between Jessie's brother and Sachin, her parents learn of their supposed affair. They fix a match and schedule her wedding. The day arrives and midway through the ceremony, Jessie refuses to marry the groom, displeasing everyone in her family. Sachin, who had, without anyone's knowledge, come to Kerala to witness the wedding is ecstatic and secretly visits Jessie at her home. It is then that Jessie admits she has indeed fallen in love with him. Sachin and Jessie continue to love each other without the knowledge of their parents.\n\nAt this point of time, Sachin goes to Goa on a 40-day shoot, where he gets busy. Meanwhile, the topic of Jessie's marriage comes up again at her home when the guy whom she refused to marry earlier pays them a visit. Panicking, Jessie calls Sachin and tells him that she wants to elope with him. Sachin, who he is travelling through less than ideal places, tells Jessie to stay in Mumbai for now, and that soon he would be back and they can discuss. Jessie stops taking Sachin's calls and so he goes back one night to check on Jessie. He comes to know that Jessie has decided to break up, as the relationship is not peaceful due to her parents' disapproval. She says she has agreed to get married to a boy of her parents' choice. When Sachin pleads her not to do it, she tells him that a time had come when she was willing to elope, but the moment was gone. She doesn't want Sachin to wait for her, as he has his dreams to fulfill. Sachin later comes to know that she is married and settled abroad.\n\nTwo years later, Sachin meets Samantha ([[Samantha Ruth Prabhu]]). She falls in love with him but is rejected by Sachin who feels that he hasn't yet gotten over Jessie. He then comes up with a script for his first film, which happens to be his very own love story. He calls upon an actor ([[Ashwin Kakumanu]]) as the film's protagonist, Samantha as the female lead and Anay as the film's cinematographer, and the film is eventually titled ''Jessie''. While shooting for the film in [[Taj Mahal]], he sees Jessie and she comes to speak with him. She admits that she is not married and is still in love with him, and he too says she is still in his heart. Sachin proposes yet again and they get married the same day. This is actually revealed to be the end scene in Sachin's film \u2013 which Sachin and Jessie in real life are watching together in the theatre. After the film ends, Jessie praises Sachin for his efforts and the latter agrees to drop her home, implying that they are reunited.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Prateik Babbar]] as Sachin Kulkarni\n* [[Amy Jackson]] as Jessie Thekkekuttu\n* [[Shruti Bapna]] as Sister\n* [[Manu Rishi]] as Anay\n* [[Sachin Khedekar]] as Anand Kulkarni\n* [[Samantha Ruth Prabhu]] in a cameo appearance as Samantha ''\"Sam\"'', an actress who plays the female lead role in Sachin's debut film, ''Jessie''\n* [[Ashwin Kakumanu]] in a cameo appearance as himself, an actor who plays the main lead in ''Jessie'', Sachin's debut film\n* [[Babu Antony]] as Joseph Thekkekutu\n* [[Lakshmi Ramakrishnan]] as Mrs. Thekkekuttu (Jessie's mother)\n* [[Sriranjini (Tamil actress)|Sriranjini]] as Mrs. Kulkarni (Sachin's mother)\n* [[Ramesh Sippy]] as himself\n* [[Subbalakshmi]]\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nGautham Menon started working on ''Ekk Deewana Tha'', the Hindi remake of his Tamil film ''[[Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa]]'', in 2011, and his Telugu simultaneous version ''[[Ye Maaya Chesave]]'', with Prateik Babbar and Amy Jackson in the lead roles (for the Hindi version). ''Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa'' (Tamil) and ''Ye Maaya Chesave'' (Telugu) were considered to have changed the images of their lead actor pairs [[Silambarasan Rajendar]]-[[Trisha Krishnan]] and [[Naga Chaitanya]]-[[Samantha Ruth Prabhu|Samantha]] respectively. Though, the Hindi remake initially had Trisha Krishnan and [[Samantha Ruth Prabhu]] reprising their role, the actress was unceremoniously dropped from the project after a photo shoot and replaced by [[Amy Jackson]], who shot to fame with the Tamil film ''[[Madrasapattinam]]''.\n\nGautham Menon was trying out a 'look shoot' at the same locations where he shot ''Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa'' and ''Ye Maaya Chesave'', including a popular seaside restaurant on ECR, Chennai. A source close to the director said, \"This shoot was just to get the 'feel' of the film. The actual shoot will take place in Mumbai from next month.\" According to the sources, A R Rahman's original tunes will be retained for ''Ekk Deewana Tha'' as well, while the film also features Gautham Menon's regular technical team, consisting of art director [[Rajeevan]] and editor [[Anthony Gonsalves]].\n\nNoted poet, story and screenplay specialist, Javed Akhtar recently was in Chennai, supervising the script and writing the lyrics for the film. A source close to the development said, \"Javed saab and Gautham hit it off well. The lyricist's inputs will be taken into consideration as Gautham is particular that his film should not come across as a routine South Indian remake.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-11-19/news-interviews/28263435_1_hindi-version-amy-jackson-gautham-vasudev-menon |title=VTV's Hindi version kicks off \u2013 Times of India |publisher=[[The Times of India]] |date=19 November 2010 |accessdate=2011-09-26}}</ref>\n\nAmy Jackson, playing a [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani]] Christian in the film, said that, \"I'm very kicked about working with Gautham Menon.
