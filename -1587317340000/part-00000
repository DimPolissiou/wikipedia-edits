{"title_page": "Mainstream Rock (chart)", "text_new": "'''Mainstream Rock''' is a [[music chart]] in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine that ranks the most-played songs on [[mainstream rock]] radio stations in the United States, a category that combines the formats of [[active rock]] and [[heritage rock]]. The chart was launched in March 1981, as '''Rock Albums and Top Tracks''', after which the name changed first to '''Top Rock Tracks''', then to '''Album Rock Tracks''', and finally to its present title in 1996.\n\n==History==\nThe Rock Albums & Top Tracks charts were introduced in the March 21, 1981, issue of ''Billboard''. The 50- and 60-position charts ranked airplay on album rock radio stations in the United States.<ref name=bbrock>{{cite news | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/958877/album-rock-charts-celebrate-anniversaries | title = Album, Rock Charts Celebrate Anniversaries | first = Gary | last = Trust | work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date = March 23, 2010 | accessdate = June 13, 2013 | url-status = live | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140826141823/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/958877/album-rock-charts-celebrate-anniversaries | archivedate = August 26, 2014 }}</ref> Because [[album-oriented rock]] stations focused on playing tracks from albums rather than specifically released singles, these charts were designed to measure the airplay of any and all tracks from an album. Rock Albums was a survey of the top albums on American rock radio, while Top Tracks listed the top individual songs being played. Mike Harrison of ''Billboard'' explained that when major artists release albums, more than one song from the album can become popular at the same time.<ref name=bbrock /> The first number-one song on the Top Tracks chart was \"[[I Can't Stand It (song)|I Can't Stand It]]\" by [[Eric Clapton]].<ref name=bbrock />\n\nIn September 1984, the Rock Albums chart was discontinued and Top Tracks was renamed Top Rock Tracks.<ref name=Whitburn>{{cite book | first=Joel | last=Whitburn | authorlink=Joel Whitburn | year=2002 | title=Rock Tracks | isbn=0-89820-153-5 | page=9}}</ref> It reduced from a 60-song tally to 50 songs on October 20, 1984, following a major revamp to the magazine. Coinciding with an increase in its reporting panel of album rock stations in the United States, the name of the chart was changed again with the issue dated April 12, 1986, to Album Rock Tracks.<ref>{{cite journal |date=April 12, 1986 |title=''Billboard'' Announces Expanded Album Rock Chart Panel |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=98 |issue=15 |pages=10, 16 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yQEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> In November 1991, instead of reporting panels, ''Billboard'' changed its methodology of measuring airplay by using monitored airplay as provided by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]] to compile many of its charts. As a result, this data showed that many songs could spend months to over a year on the Album Rock Tracks chart. ''Billboard'' decided to drop to a 40-position chart (still its current format), and songs that fell out of the top 20 and after spending 20 weeks on the chart were moved to a new 10-position recurrent chart.<ref>{{cite journal |date=June 27, 1992 |title=Album Rock Chart Changes |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=104 |issue=26 |pages=67 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBAEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&lr=&rview=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> The recurrent chart was scrapped two years later, but not the methodology.\n\nTo differentiate between classic and alternative album rock radio formats, ''Billboard'' changed the name of the chart to Mainstream Rock Tracks beginning with issue dated April 13, 1996.<ref>{{cite journal |date=April 13, 1996 |title=Name Changed on Album Rock Tracks |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=108 |issue=15 |pages=6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_gwEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&lr=&rview=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> The Mainstream Rock Tracks chart did not appear in the print edition of ''Billboard'' from its issue dated August 2, 2003,<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 2, 2003 |first=Keith |last=Girard |title=The Evolution Continues |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=115 |issue=31 |pages=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MhEEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&lr=&rview=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> being accessible only through the magazine's subscription-based website, Billboard.biz. In late 2013, the chart was reintroduced to its primary website and magazine.\n\nWhen ''[[R&R (magazine)|R&R]]'' ceased publication in June 2009, ''Billboard'' incorporated its rock charts, Active Rock and Heritage Rock into its own publication.

The chart was launched in March 1981, as '''Rock Albums and Top Tracks''', after which the name changed first to '''Top Rock Tracks''', then to '''Album Rock Tracks''', and finally to its present title in 1996.\n\n==History==\nThe Rock Albums & Top Tracks charts were introduced in the March 21, 1981, issue of ''Billboard''. The 50- and 60-position charts ranked airplay on album rock radio stations in the United States.<ref name=bbrock>{{cite news | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/958877/album-rock-charts-celebrate-anniversaries | title = Album, Rock Charts Celebrate Anniversaries | first = Gary | last = Trust | work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date = March 23, 2010 | accessdate = June 13, 2013 | url-status = live | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140826141823/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/958877/album-rock-charts-celebrate-anniversaries | archivedate = August 26, 2014 }}</ref> Because [[album-oriented rock]] stations focused on playing tracks from albums rather than specifically released singles, these charts were designed to measure the airplay of any and all tracks from an album. Rock Albums was a survey of the top albums on American rock radio, while Top Tracks listed the top individual songs being played. Mike Harrison of ''Billboard'' explained that when major artists release albums, more than one song from the album can become popular at the same time.<ref name=bbrock /> The first number-one song on the Top Tracks chart was \"[[I Can't Stand It (song)|I Can't Stand It]]\" by [[Eric Clapton]].<ref name=bbrock />\n\nIn September 1984, the Rock Albums chart was discontinued and Top Tracks was renamed Top Rock Tracks.<ref name=Whitburn>{{cite book | first=Joel | last=Whitburn | authorlink=Joel Whitburn | year=2002 | title=Rock Tracks | isbn=0-89820-153-5 | page=9}}</ref> It reduced from a 60-song tally to 50 songs on October 20, 1984, following a major revamp to the magazine. Coinciding with an increase in its reporting panel of album rock stations in the United States, the name of the chart was changed again with the issue dated April 12, 1986, to Album Rock Tracks.<ref>{{cite journal |date=April 12, 1986 |title=''Billboard'' Announces Expanded Album Rock Chart Panel |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=98 |issue=15 |pages=10, 16 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yQEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> In November 1991, instead of reporting panels, ''Billboard'' changed its methodology of measuring airplay by using monitored airplay as provided by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]] to compile many of its charts. As a result, this data showed that many songs could spend months to over a year on the Album Rock Tracks chart. ''Billboard'' decided to drop to a 40-position chart (still its current format), and songs that fell out of the top 20 and after spending 20 weeks on the chart were moved to a new 10-position recurrent chart.<ref>{{cite journal |date=June 27, 1992 |title=Album Rock Chart Changes |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=104 |issue=26 |pages=67 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBAEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&lr=&rview=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> The recurrent chart was scrapped two years later, but not the methodology.\n\nTo differentiate between classic and alternative album rock radio formats, ''Billboard'' changed the name of the chart to Mainstream Rock Tracks beginning with issue dated April 13, 1996.<ref>{{cite journal |date=April 13, 1996 |title=Name Changed on Album Rock Tracks |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=108 |issue=15 |pages=6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_gwEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&lr=&rview=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> The Mainstream Rock Tracks chart did not appear in the print edition of ''Billboard'' from its issue dated August 2, 2003,<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 2, 2003 |first=Keith |last=Girard |title=The Evolution Continues |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=115 |issue=31 |pages=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MhEEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&lr=&rview=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> being accessible only through the magazine's subscription-based website, Billboard.biz. In late 2013, the chart was reintroduced to its primary website and magazine.\n\nWhen ''[[R&R (magazine)|R&R]]'' ceased publication in June 2009, ''Billboard'' incorporated its rock charts, Active Rock and Heritage Rock into its own publication.
