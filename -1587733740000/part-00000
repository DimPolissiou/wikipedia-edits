SpongeBob is portrayed as a [[na\u00efvety|na\u00efve]] and goofy [[sponge]] who works as a [[chef|fry cook]] at the [[Krusty Krab]], a [[fast food restaurant]] known for its signature burger, the [[Krabby Patty]]. He is characterized by his optimism and childlike attitude, and influenced by other comedic characters, including [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Pee-Wee Herman]]. He is voiced by actor and comedian [[Tom Kenny]].\n\nSpongeBob was created and designed by cartoonist and educator [[Stephen Hillenburg]]. The character's name is derived from \"Bob the Sponge\", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip ''The Intertidal Zone''. He originally drew it while teaching marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] during the 1980s. He began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the cancellation in 1996 of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', which he directed. The character's first appearance was in the pilot, \"[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]\", which premiered on May&nbsp;1, 1999.\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has garnered a positive response from media critics and achieved popularity with both children and adults and is frequently named as one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time. He has, however, been involved in controversy with some conservative social groups for allegedly promoting [[homosexuality]], although Hillenburg has described the character as \"asexual\".<ref name=accuse />\n\n==Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''==\nSpongeBob is a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic [[Aplysina fistularis|yellow tube sponge]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=[[The SpongeBob Musical]] |date=June 7, 2016 |last=[[Kyle Jarrow]] |type=Broadway musical |language=English |publisher=[[Tina Landau]] |quote=French Narrator: This fruit is home to one of the most fascinating sea creatures of all\u2014''[[Aplysina fistularis]]'', the yellow sponge.}}</ref> He resides in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom with other [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] aquatic creatures.

SpongeBob is portrayed as a [[na\u00efvety|na\u00efve]] and goofy [[sponge]] who works as a [[chef|fry cook]] at the [[Krusty Krab]], a [[fast food restaurant]] known for its signature burger, the [[Krabby Patty]]. He is characterized by his optimism and childlike attitude, and influenced by other comedic characters, including [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Pee-Wee Herman]]. He is voiced by actor and comedian [[Tom Kenny]].\n\nSpongeBob was created and designed by cartoonist and educator [[Stephen Hillenburg]]. The character's name is derived from \"Bob the Sponge\", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip ''The Intertidal Zone''. He originally drew it while teaching marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] during the 1980s. He began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the cancellation in 1996 of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', which he directed.

Whitten's Colonial home in Ipswitch, Massachusetts, that we toured at the beginning of last season. Then it was a burned wreck; now, a year later, it is impeccably restored. After Dick Silva talks about the fire, he leads a tour the ruins of the house. Then Steve meets with Dick and his wife Sandra to discuss their plans for the future, which are to rebuild on the same spot. Finally, we see the basement heating plant which investigators believe may have been the source of the fire.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=0af0ff\n|EpisodeNumber=21-02\n|Title=The Billerica House - 2\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 2, 1999}}\n|ShortSummary= We visit the Billerica Fire Dept. to hear what it was like to fight the Silva fire, and how it might have been prevented or at least kept more manageable. Back at the house, our host meets with the Silvas' insurance agent, who explains the benefits of having a \"guaranteed replacement cost\" endorsement on one's homeowner's policy - it provides for rebuilding after a complete loss. Public insurance adjuster (and former This Old House homeowner) Dick Benedetti shows us some of the process by which he is writing up the insurance claim for the Silvas. Architect Chris Dallmus begins to discuss the design of the new structure with homeowners Dick and Sandra Silva, while outside a perc test is run for the new septic system and landscape contractor Roger Cook takes an inventory of the plants that did and did not survive the fire.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=0af0ff\n|EpisodeNumber=21-03\n|Title=The Billerica House - 3\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 9, 1999}}\n|ShortSummary= Tom recounts the day the machines came to tear down Dick and Sandra's old house. All that's left is a hole in the ground. Arborist Matt Foti and his crew take down two 75-year-old Eastern white pines damaged by the fire and cut them into 2x10 planks on a mobile saw mill. An environmental testing crew arrives to take soil samples, as the fire department suspects fuel oil was spilled on site during the fire. If tests shows that concentrations are high enough, a mitigation will be required by the state's department of environmental protection. Another team arrives to re-establish the height of the water table, digging a hole by hand, to satisfy the town's building department that the foundation's proposed elevations legal. Architect Chris Dallmus shows us a model of the house-to-be, a four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath structure whose style Chris describes as \"village Victorian,\" modelled after some houses he found in Billerica's town center.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=0af0ff\n|EpisodeNumber=21-04\n|Title=The Billerica House - 4\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 16, 1999}}\n|ShortSummary= A full month after our last time on site, the foundation is just being completed, the construction schedule having fallen victim to a three-week soil cleanup process. With the complex, 30-corner foundation walls up, it's time for a proactive termite treatment beneath the slab, using a new class of chemical, that rather than acting as a barrier, allows termites to enter the treated zone unknowingly, upon which they die. Its continuing efficacy in the ground has been proven for seven years and counting. Before the slab is poured, the crew installs an underlayment of 2\" styrofoam insulation and a clip-in system for radiant heat - at half the price it was only a few years ago, Richard insists we put the tubing in every slab we pour, even if it isn't used right away. Then Steve takes viewers to a Florida house built by a major insurance company to showcase tips for loss mitigation - everything from sprinklers to kick-proof door jambs. Back at the site, the slab is poured, and homeowners Dick and Sandra Silva try to choose a brick veneer for the new foundation.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=0af0ff\n|EpisodeNumber=21-05\n|Title=The Billerica House - 5\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 23, 1999}}\n|ShortSummary= Homeowner Dick Silva gives a tour of the newly framed up first floor, and Tom Silva shows some of the hallmarks of a good framing system. In the basement, our master carpenter explains how the floor joists meet two steel beams to maximize headroom, while Steve and crew held a metal post in position. We then visit the Florida factory where the wooden I-beams used in the house's floor are made - 25 miles' worth a day.

Steve meets architect Stephen Holt, who shows a picture of the house looked 100 years ago. For inspiration, they visit a classic Shingle-style home, built in 1881 and lovingly maintained ever since. Back at the subject house, Richard Trethewey and Tom Silva pull up in their own boat to begin a mechanical exam of the house with our master carpenter.

He and his crew cut down a few trees that were threatening the house, have move a dozen or so rhododendrons and azaleas that are in the way of the new addition, and are preapring to move a 25-foot evergreen and a 20-foot dogwood by balling the roots and using a large excavator. Inside, architect Stephen Holt shows a model of the proposed renovation to homeowner David McCue and Steve. Essentially, he hopes to restore the building to its former architectural beauty on the outside, while overcoming some floorplan problems to make it work better for the McCues inside. Part of the interior rearrangement includes putting the kitchen front and center in the house, something that wouldn't have been found in the original Shingle style building. To prove it can be done, Holt takes David and Steve to a nearby house, of a similar vintage, where he accomplished just such a change for the client. Back at the house, our master carpenter and Tom work to gently dismantle and save one of the few original fragments left in the building: a marble and copper butler's sink.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=bc8f8f\n|EpisodeNumber=23-03\n|Title=The Manchester House - 3\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 6, 2001}}\n|ShortSummary=Steve sees the seaside public rotunda and \"chowder house\" our subject property looks out on, with Manchester Historical Society president John Huss as guide. At the house, nearly four dumpsters worth of gutting has occurred, and Steve, our master carpenter and Tom take a tour of the building to see what has been revealed of its renovation history and discuss what is planned for this job. Architect Stephen Holt and homeowner David McCue continue to discuss options available to give the McCues the feeling of space and light they crave for the kitchen and living room - some are radical and expensive, some rely more on minor but clever changes. One thing they can't include is a change in footprint: the concrete has arrived for the footings for the new addition and porch. In the basement, the start of an oil leak in one of the old steel tanks has forced Richard Trethewey's hand, and he's brought in two new polyethylene-lined tanks from Europe, guaranteed never to rot.

Reviewing the immense amount of demolition done, and the work left to do, Steve asks the obvious: wouldn't it be cheaper, faster, and better to simply bulldose this tired old building and build a fresh replica? Master carpenter Norm Abram and Tom have done the math, and while it might be simpler, it would cost about $1 million more than the planned renovation. Besides, adds Tom, we are saving the old place, which is worth something. After taking a tour of one of the great surviving Shingle style buildings, H. H. Richardson's Stonehurst in Waltham, Massachusetts, Steve comes back more convinced than ever that saving what little is left of the McCues' house is the right thing to do.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=bc8f8f\n|EpisodeNumber=23-05\n|Title=The Manchester House - 5\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 20, 2001}}\n|ShortSummary=The foundation has been backfilled and carpenters are busy putting up the forms for the new terrace.

Within the new space, kitchen cabinet designer and builder Ted Goodnow works with David and Janet McCue to begin to lay out the new kitchen, pantry and office. Ted takes David and Steve to a nearby kitchen built his firm to get some more ideas about design features and materials. Back at the house, Tommy and our master carpenter investigate some archeology revealed during demolition: original fabric of the building, including the roof, a dormer and a gabled sidewall. The original wood roof shingles are an important factor as our master carpenter begins to consider roofing choices with roofing contractor Mark Mulloy and product rep Steve Miller, who shows them a treated shingle of southern yellow pine that carries a 50-year transferable warranty.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=bc8f8f\n|EpisodeNumber=23-06\n|Title=The Manchester House - 6\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 27, 2001}}\n|ShortSummary=Steve finds master carpenter Norm Abram in the new jobsite office trailer, complete with secure storage - good for keeping paperwork safe from the work going on inside the house and for keeping track of delivered materials.

Window specialist Jay Harman shows our master carpenter three different windows to consider for the renovation: pine, aluminum clad, and Alaskan yellow cedar. Each has its own qualities (and price point), but for maintenance by the water, the choice may very well be the clad.

In preparation for residing our old house, our master carpenter learns the finer points of red cedar shingles and bleaching oils from specialist Rick Farrar. Steve takes a harbor tour with architect Steve Holt to see what has happened to some of the town's great old houses - everything from total restoration to total removal. One of the notorious removals was that of Kragsyde, considered by some to be the greatest example of the Shingle style - it was demolished in 1929. Though it's gone, an exact replica has been built by a couple in Swan's Island, Maine, and Steve visits them to see their remarkable achievement.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=bc8f8f\n|EpisodeNumber=23-08\n|Title=The Manchester House - 8\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|November 10, 2001}}\n|ShortSummary=Our new roof is going on, and our master carpenter talks to roofing contractor Mark Mulloy about the system: decking, bitumen membrane covering every surface from eave to ridge, a three-dimensional nylon mesh to allow air to flow beneath the shingles, and finally the shingles themselves - pressure-treated southern yellow pine with a 50-year transferable warranty. Tom shows Steve how to cut studs quickly when building a partition wall beneath a bowed ceiling, while our master carpenter takes viewers to the Bend, Oregon, factory where our new windows are being made.

Richard Trethewey checks out a software program that computes heat loss for our building, as well as projecting heating and cooling costs with various insulation, window, and power plant configurations. One remarkable finding: with the current, inefficient heating plant and standard insulation and double-pane windows operating costs for 30 years would be around $220,000; with expanded-foam insulation, low-e windows, and super-high-efficiency heating equipment the cost would be $75,000.

At the jobsite, mason Lenny Belliveau builds the new addition's exterior face from water-stuck brick, while inside, master carpenter Norm Abram checks out Dan McLaughin's use of an insulating chimney system made from pumice. It goes up quickly and keeps the chimney stack warmer, preventing the buildup of the column of cold air that normally dumps out, spreading smoke into the room. Tommy shows Steve his method of putting in a wooden floor over concrete that was previously outdoor patio space; his scribing technique is one Steve's never seen before.

Steve finds Roger Cook out back, where he's been denied Conservation Commission approval to cut down trees near the ocean, though he is allow to limb them up for a better view. Out at the auto court, Roger shows Steve how he cuts 2\" thick granite in a curve. Steve and homeowner Janet McCue visit a garden shop to see how various paving options look before she commits to buying materials for the landscape.

Master carpenter Norm Abram finds out how homeowner Janet McCue has fare in her attempt to strip the diamond-paned curved sash on the historic bump-out. It was an arduous process - an alternative would be to send them out for stripping, but that would necessitate reglazing and repainting the entire sash, even though only the exterior needs it. Steve sees the expanded foam insulation going in and talks to the company president about its relatively high cost (2 to 3 times of that fiberglass), its performance, and its environmental record (which is excellent).

Nonetheless, the new solution is a handsome unit, remote-controlled, with a period English tile surround and hearth and with a mantle made from pieces of the old master bathroom fireplace, which was taken out. Landscape architect David Hawk walks Steve along the rapidly developing new driveway, which gives an entirely different arrival experience than the old 16-foot-wide straight approach it replaces. Richard Trethewey shows off a new energy-recovery ventilator that not only changes the house's air (essential, given how highly insulated we've made it) but harvests heat and moisture from the exiting stale air in the winter, adding both to the incoming fresh air, doing the same with coolness and dryness in the summer. Homeowner David McCue visits master carpenter Norm Abram in the New Yankee Workshop to help in the making of the inglenook, priming the raised panels.

The countertops go in, Steve lends a hand setting the cast iron farm sink, and Richard installs an elaborate faucet system containing a retractable sprayer head and an undercover water filtration unit.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=CA8A00\n|EpisodeNumber=24-26\n|Title=The Lake Forest Dream Kitchen - 8\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|April 3, 2003}}\n|ShortSummary=After only 12 short weeks, the Dream Kitchen is complete, and Heidi Smith and the triplets are already moved in and cooking up treats for the wrap party. Steve sees how a decorative painter treated the inside of the new kitchen cabinets and learns how a new control device will coordinate over 40 individual lights to create different lighting \"scenes\" for the kitchen. Acclaimed Chicago chef Rick Bayless arrives to take the new kitchen for a test drive and to answer the question \"How does a pro cook at home?\", shows Steve the inviting, functional kitchen he created in his house on Chicago's North Side. Homeowner Mike Smith reveals that the job cost around $85,000 - which doesn't include all the donated products. In the real world, such a transformation would have been $200,000 and taken much longer. As the wrap party begins, Steve and Norm commend all involved on a job well done and heartily agree that from location to contractors to homeowners this was a \"dream\" project indeed.\n}}\n}}\n\n==Season 25 (2003\u201304)==\nNew Host Kevin O'Connor\n{{#invoke:Episode table|main|background=#0000ff|season=8|title=50|airdate=20|episodes=\n{{Episode table/part|c=#0000ff|nopart=y|p=The Concord Cottage}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=0000ff\n|EpisodeNumber=25-01\n|Title=Turning a Garden Shed into a Home\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 11, 2003}}\n|ShortSummary=Norm Abram welcomes new host Kevin O'Connor aboard with a visit to one of the most ambitious TOH jobs to date, the Manchester-by-the-Sea project. Wanting to tackle a big job like this one his first time out, Kevin instead ends up in historic Concord, Massachusetts, with a small (but sweet) 20- by 26-foot garden shed that homeowners Jeff and Janet Bernard want to convert into an in-law cottage for Janet's retired parents. Protected by local zoning laws, the shed can't be torn down and rebuilt, so Tom Silva will reframe the c. 1894 building from the inside out, and Richard Trethewey will face the challenges of bringing water, sewer, and gas lines into the building for the first time ever. The cottage is the smallest project in This Old House history, but everyone agrees that, although there's not a lot to work with, there's still a lot to do. Janet takes Kevin to see the inspiration for her project, a small garage apartment that's part of an estate currently on the market in Concord for $7.2 million.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=0000ff\n|EpisodeNumber=25-02\n|Title=Roadblocks to Turning a Former Chicken Coop into a Cottage\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 18, 2003}}\n|ShortSummary=Work can't begin at the jobsite until permits are issued, so Kevin takes homeowner Janet Bernard to meet the Concord building commissioner, John Minty, to see what potential roadblocks she's facing in trying to turn an accessory building into a full-time residence. Then Kevin meets local architect Holly Cratsley to see a new home she designed to look like an old home, and an accompanying timber frame barn. Meanwhile, with flashlights, ladders, and archival photographs, Norm and preservation architect Leonard Baum reconstruct the architectural history of the project house, learning that the building started out as a one-story chicken coop with a hip roof, and that it is indeed older than the zoning law itself \u2014 a finding that's essential to moving forward with the town.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=0000ff\n|EpisodeNumber=25-03\n|Title=Nothing is as Easy as it Looks\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 25, 2003}}\n|ShortSummary=Kevin arrives to find the newly issued building permit affixed to the building and work finally getting underway. Architect Holly Cratsley is officially on board, and Kevin pays a visit to her office to see the first pass at floor plans, elevations, and a scale model of the cottage. Zoning laws only allow for a modest increase in overall volume, so the new one-bedroom cottage will be less than 1,000 square feet when it's done. Norm and Tom prepare to brace a bowed wall, but find a badly rotted sill that needs replacing before they can proceed. Putting Kevin to work, they build two temporary walls; once they're in place, they take the weight off the compromised outside wall. The rotted sill comes out and a new, pressure-treated sill goes in. Then Kevin visits a converted carriage house in Winchester, Massachusetts, that's full of great ideas for the project. Unexpected rain postpones the excavation for the foundation of the new addition.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=0000ff\n|EpisodeNumber=25-04\n|Title=It's Starting to Look Like a

Whitten's Colonial home in Ipswitch, Massachusetts, that we toured at the beginning of last season. Then it was a burned wreck; now, a year later, it is impeccably restored. After Dick Silva talks about the fire, he leads a tour the ruins of the house. Then Steve meets with Dick and his wife Sandra to discuss their plans for the future, which are to rebuild on the same spot. Finally, we see the basement heating plant which investigators believe may have been the source of the fire.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=0af0ff\n|EpisodeNumber=21-02\n|Title=The Billerica House - 2\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 2, 1999}}\n|ShortSummary= We visit the Billerica Fire Dept. to hear what it was like to fight the Silva fire, and how it might have been prevented or at least kept more manageable. Back at the house, our host meets with the Silvas' insurance agent, who explains the benefits of having a \"guaranteed replacement cost\" endorsement on one's homeowner's policy - it provides for rebuilding after a complete loss. Public insurance adjuster (and former This Old House homeowner) Dick Benedetti shows us some of the process by which he is writing up the insurance claim for the Silvas. Architect Chris Dallmus begins to discuss the design of the new structure with homeowners Dick and Sandra Silva, while outside a perc test is run for the new septic system and landscape contractor Roger Cook takes an inventory of the plants that did and did not survive the fire.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=0af0ff\n|EpisodeNumber=21-03\n|Title=The Billerica House - 3\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 9, 1999}}\n|ShortSummary= Tom recounts the day the machines came to tear down Dick and Sandra's old house. All that's left is a hole in the ground. Arborist Matt Foti and his crew take down two 75-year-old Eastern white pines damaged by the fire and cut them into 2x10 planks on a mobile saw mill. An environmental testing crew arrives to take soil samples, as the fire department suspects fuel oil was spilled on site during the fire. If tests shows that concentrations are high enough, a mitigation will be required by the state's department of environmental protection. Another team arrives to re-establish the height of the water table, digging a hole by hand, to satisfy the town's building department that the foundation's proposed elevations legal. Architect Chris Dallmus shows us a model of the house-to-be, a four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath structure whose style Chris describes as \"village Victorian,\" modelled after some houses he found in Billerica's town center.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=0af0ff\n|EpisodeNumber=21-04\n|Title=The Billerica House - 4\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 16, 1999}}\n|ShortSummary= A full month after our last time on site, the foundation is just being completed, the construction schedule having fallen victim to a three-week soil cleanup process. With the complex, 30-corner foundation walls up, it's time for a proactive termite treatment beneath the slab, using a new class of chemical, that rather than acting as a barrier, allows termites to enter the treated zone unknowingly, upon which they die. Its continuing efficacy in the ground has been proven for seven years and counting. Before the slab is poured, the crew installs an underlayment of 2\" styrofoam insulation and a clip-in system for radiant heat - at half the price it was only a few years ago, Richard insists we put the tubing in every slab we pour, even if it isn't used right away. Then Steve takes viewers to a Florida house built by a major insurance company to showcase tips for loss mitigation - everything from sprinklers to kick-proof door jambs. Back at the site, the slab is poured, and homeowners Dick and Sandra Silva try to choose a brick veneer for the new foundation.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=0af0ff\n|EpisodeNumber=21-05\n|Title=The Billerica House - 5\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 23, 1999}}\n|ShortSummary= Homeowner Dick Silva gives a tour of the newly framed up first floor, and Tom Silva shows some of the hallmarks of a good framing system. In the basement, our master carpenter explains how the floor joists meet two steel beams to maximize headroom, while Steve and crew held a metal post in position. We then visit the Florida factory where the wooden I-beams used in the house's floor are made - 25 miles' worth a day. Back on site, architect Chris Dallmus explains some of the strategies he's using to reduce the mass and appearance of the proposed three-car garage. Finally, framing contractor Eric Machemer and crew raise the last of the first-floor walls and the building begins to climb into the sky.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=0af0ff\n|EpisodeNumber=21-06\n|Title=The Billerica House - 6\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 30, 1999}}\n|ShortSummary= Homeowner Dick Silva gives a tour of the framed and sheated house and reports that he and Sandra have received a very satisfactory insurance settlement on the structure; the settlement on the contents awaits a complete inventory. We pay a visit to the Massachusetts Firefighting Academy, where firefighters learn hands-on the techniques that save lives and buildings. Back at the house, the crew discusses the fine points of shed dormers, while framing contractor Eric Pierce puts one together in a fast and professional way. Mason Lenny Belliveau shows us his system: veneer brick on the concrete foundation face, a matching full brick for the chimney.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=0af0ff\n|EpisodeNumber=21-07\n|Title=The Billerica House - 7\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|November 6, 1999}}\n|ShortSummary= The new windows have arrived. They're made from an extruded composive of PVC and sawdust, and we visit Minnesota to see the factory. The crew puts up corner trim using two layers of cementitious board, while mason Lenny Belliveau shows us a new tool that extrudes cement grout like icing for a cake. Lenny forms the new hearth, and the guys move on to installing one of the new windows.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=0af0ff\n|EpisodeNumber=21-08\n|Title=The Billerica House - 8\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|November 13, 1999}}\n|ShortSummary= Norm and Tom take over Dick's Quonset hut to set up a woodworking shop, forcing Dick to take his restored 1931 Ford Roadster pickup truck up to the new garage. He gives us a tour, then we meet James Crowe, inventor of a synthetic slate made from recycled automotive rubber and industrial plastic trimmings. Cast in molds, it almost exactly like the real thing, yet is lighter, less fragile, and a quarter of the cost. Roofer Mark Mulloy shows how it's going on the building and predicts that, if it lasts as long as Crowe claims (a minimum of 50 years), it will be a real hit. In the workshop, tool technician Scott Box helps the guys set up and calibrate the new table saw, shaper, planner, joiner, and chop saw, while Richard Trethewey shows us the factors that determined the layout of the house's waste pipes.

Far cheaper than digging beneath the road, this method will still allow for electricity, cable, and telephone wires to be undergrounded to the house, avoiding unsightly overhead wires. Inside the house, kitchen designer Phil Mossgraber and Sandra Silva are going over her wish list for the kitchen; our host joins them as Phil suggests eliminating a closet in the mudroom and putting in a service door to the dining room, a good idea Sandy embraces. Richard Trethewey is on site with the head of the American Fire Sprinkler Association, seeing the first steps in designing a sprinkler system for the house, while our host visits Underwriters Laboratories th see how they test all kinds of materials relating to fire and fire safety.

Turning down his rechargeable jobsite boombox, he shows off a new breaker called an arc-fault arrestor, which detects the kind of electrical arcs in frayed cords and worn wires that can cause fires. Tom Silva shows us the first of the porch decks: he's using ipe, a Brazilian hardwood, and giving it a clean look by fastening it down using only a marine adhesive and an absolute minimum of stainless steel trim nails. Out back in the workshop, Norm is routing out a rabbet on one of the sample doors and takes viewers on a tour of the factory where the router was made.

Inside, oriental carpet expert Steve Boodakian extolls the virtues of a central vacuuming system - it makes vacuuming so easy that people tend to do it more often, which greatly extends a carpet's life. The front stairs runner receives its decorative brass hold-down rods. PC Computing magazine editor Paul Somerson reviews the house's computer set-up, which starts with a high-speed cable connection to the internet. A \"hub\" allows multiple Internet connections throughout the house, so all computers in the house to share any peripherals, like a printer or fax.

They meet Janet McCue, who is busy supervising the family's move out of the house for the duration of the project, and her husband David, who gives them a tour around the inside of the rambling building. Steve meets architect Stephen Holt, who shows a picture of the house looked 100 years ago. For inspiration, they visit a classic Shingle-style home, built in 1881 and lovingly maintained ever since. Back at the subject house, Richard Trethewey and Tom Silva pull up in their own boat to begin a mechanical exam of the house with our master carpenter. Their verdict: a solid, well-plumbed structure to build on. The McCues describe their hopes for the project: better communication between house and yard, a relocated and improved kitchen, expanded master bath and bedroom, and a great room for music performances and relaxing.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=bc8f8f\n|EpisodeNumber=23-02\n|Title=The Manchester House - 2\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|September 29, 2001}}\n|ShortSummary=The day starts off with the landscaping works of Roger Cook. He and his crew cut down a few trees that were threatening the house, have move a dozen or so rhododendrons and azaleas that are in the way of the new addition, and are preapring to move a 25-foot evergreen and a 20-foot dogwood by balling the roots and using a large excavator. Inside, architect Stephen Holt shows a model of the proposed renovation to homeowner David McCue and Steve. Essentially, he hopes to restore the building to its former architectural beauty on the outside, while overcoming some floorplan problems to make it work better for the McCues inside. Part of the interior rearrangement includes putting the kitchen front and center in the house, something that wouldn't have been found in the original Shingle style building. To prove it can be done, Holt takes David and Steve to a nearby house, of a similar vintage, where he accomplished just such a change for the client. Back at the house, our master carpenter and Tom work to gently dismantle and save one of the few original fragments left in the building: a marble and copper butler's sink.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=bc8f8f\n|EpisodeNumber=23-03\n|Title=The Manchester House - 3\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 6, 2001}}\n|ShortSummary=Steve sees the seaside public rotunda and \"chowder house\" our subject property looks out on, with Manchester Historical Society president John Huss as guide. At the house, nearly four dumpsters worth of gutting has occurred, and Steve, our master carpenter and Tom take a tour of the building to see what has been revealed of its renovation history and discuss what is planned for this job. Architect Stephen Holt and homeowner David McCue continue to discuss options available to give the McCues the feeling of space and light they crave for the kitchen and living room - some are radical and expensive, some rely more on minor but clever changes. One thing they can't include is a change in footprint: the concrete has arrived for the footings for the new addition and porch. In the basement, the start of an oil leak in one of the old steel tanks has forced Richard Trethewey's hand, and he's brought in two new polyethylene-lined tanks from Europe, guaranteed never to rot. Finally, Steve learns from Manchester Conservation Commissioner Betsy Rickards the purpose of and regulations concerning the staked and lined haybales encircling the project.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=bc8f8f\n|EpisodeNumber=23-04\n|Title=The Manchester House - 4\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 13, 2001}}\n|ShortSummary=With the new concrete walls poured, it's time to damp-proof them, just one more in a series of tasks that adds up to nearly $30,000 for the new foundation - which is simply the cost of building to code. Reviewing the immense amount of demolition done, and the work left to do, Steve asks the obvious: wouldn't it be cheaper, faster, and better to simply bulldose this tired old building and build a fresh replica? Master carpenter Norm Abram and Tom have done the math, and while it might be simpler, it would cost about $1 million more than the planned renovation. Besides, adds Tom, we are saving the old place, which is worth something. After taking a tour of one of the great surviving Shingle style buildings, H. H. Richardson's Stonehurst in Waltham, Massachusetts, Steve comes back more convinced than ever that saving what little is left of the McCues' house is the right thing to do.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=bc8f8f\n|EpisodeNumber=23-05\n|Title=The Manchester House - 5\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 20, 2001}}\n|ShortSummary=The foundation has been backfilled and carpenters are busy putting up the forms for the new terrace. Inside, the area for the new kitchen and family room has been completely opened up, thanks to a 3800-pound steel and laminated lumber beam Tommy and his crew engineered and inserted through the side of the building. Within the new space, kitchen cabinet designer and builder Ted Goodnow works with David and Janet McCue to begin to lay out the new kitchen, pantry and office. Ted takes David and Steve to a nearby kitchen built his firm to get some more ideas about design features and materials. Back at the house, Tommy and our master carpenter investigate some archeology revealed during demolition: original fabric of the building, including the roof, a dormer and a gabled sidewall. The original wood roof shingles are an important factor as our master carpenter begins to consider roofing choices with roofing contractor Mark Mulloy and product rep Steve Miller, who shows them a treated shingle of southern yellow pine that carries a 50-year transferable warranty.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=bc8f8f\n|EpisodeNumber=23-06\n|Title=The Manchester House - 6\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 27, 2001}}\n|ShortSummary=Steve finds master carpenter Norm Abram in the new jobsite office trailer, complete with secure storage - good for keeping paperwork safe from the work going on inside the house and for keeping track of delivered materials. Tom shows Steve the progress on the job, including the restored dormers, straightened floors and an ingenious method of raising the kitchen/family room ceiling by shaving 2\" off the joists and stiffening the remaining structure with engineered lumber and steel to form flitches. Window specialist Jay Harman shows our master carpenter three different windows to consider for the renovation: pine, aluminum clad, and Alaskan yellow cedar. Each has its own qualities (and price point), but for maintenance by the water, the choice may very well be the clad. Finally, kitchen cabinet designer and manufacturer Ted Goodnow and homeowner Janet McCue show Steve a full-size mock-up of the kitchen they're considering.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=bc8f8f\n|EpisodeNumber=23-07\n|Title=The Manchester House - 7\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|November 3, 2001}}\n|ShortSummary=Steve tries his hand at driving the jobsite forklift, successfully (if shakily) delivering a load of plywood to the third floor.

In preparation for residing our old house, our master carpenter learns the finer points of red cedar shingles and bleaching oils from specialist Rick Farrar. Steve takes a harbor tour with architect Steve Holt to see what has happened to some of the town's great old houses - everything from total restoration to total removal. One of the notorious removals was that of Kragsyde, considered by some to be the greatest example of the Shingle style - it was demolished in 1929. Though it's gone, an exact replica has been built by a couple in Swan's Island, Maine, and Steve visits them to see their remarkable achievement.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=bc8f8f\n|EpisodeNumber=23-08\n|Title=The Manchester House - 8\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|November 10, 2001}}\n|ShortSummary=Our new roof is going on, and our master carpenter talks to roofing contractor Mark Mulloy about the system: decking, bitumen membrane covering every surface from eave to ridge, a three-dimensional nylon mesh to allow air to flow beneath the shingles, and finally the shingles themselves - pressure-treated southern yellow pine with a 50-year transferable warranty. Tom shows Steve how to cut studs quickly when building a partition wall beneath a bowed ceiling, while our master carpenter takes viewers to the Bend, Oregon, factory where our new windows are being made. Finally, specialist Mark Schaub assesses the state of the chimneys; surprisingly the relatively new one, built in the 1970s, is not up to snuff.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=bc8f8f\n|EpisodeNumber=23-09\n|Title=The Manchester House - 9\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|November 17, 2001}}\n|ShortSummary=Steve sees the progress on the new addition, including a roof joist system of 1 x 12 LVLs, necessitated by the room's high ceiling height. Inside, Tom and master carpenter Norm Abram show him how they are stiffening up a bouncy third floor by sistering 1/8\" steel sheets to the floor joists from below. Richard Trethewey checks out a software program that computes heat loss for our building, as well as projecting heating and cooling costs with various insulation, window, and power plant configurations. One remarkable finding: with the current, inefficient heating plant and standard insulation and double-pane windows operating costs for 30 years would be around $220,000; with expanded-foam insulation, low-e windows, and super-high-efficiency heating equipment the cost would be $75,000.

Later in the show, he takes viewers to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, where the house - and the lives of the many families that live there - have been recontructed. At the jobsite, mason Lenny Belliveau builds the new addition's exterior face from water-stuck brick, while inside, master carpenter Norm Abram checks out Dan McLaughin's use of an insulating chimney system made from pumice. It goes up quickly and keeps the chimney stack warmer, preventing the buildup of the column of cold air that normally dumps out, spreading smoke into the room. Tommy shows Steve his method of putting in a wooden floor over concrete that was previously outdoor patio space; his scribing technique is one Steve's never seen before. Finally, architect Steve Holt shows our master carpenter his design for the new fireplace inglenook, based in part of old photos taken before the original addition was torn down.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=bc8f8f\n|EpisodeNumber=23-11\n|Title=The Manchester House - 11\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|December 1, 2001}}\n|ShortSummary=From the shoreline, Steve sees the rapidly improving look of the house, which has now regained its missing wing and dormers, and is starting to have its new front porches put on.

Steve and landscape contractor Roger Cook meet with Manchester conservation officer Betsy Rickards to learn what the regulations say about thinning a dense copse of trees down by the water. As we begin to think about our house's interior finishes, Steve takes viewers on a visit to a home that is all about interiors: Beauport, a 40-room fantasy that was the passion of interior designer Henry Davis Sleeper, who worked on it from 1907 to his death in 1934, fitting each room out in a different theme. Back on site, our master carpenter checks in with roofer Mark Mulloy, who is fashioning a lead-coated copper roof for the bell-shaped bump-out on the music room.

Painter John Dee shows Steve his approach to restoring the turn-of-the-century portico: some stripping of existing features, and some replacement of those decorative elements - brackets and capitals - that are simply not salvageable. Homeowner David McCue tells Steve about his desire to install an outdoor hot tub, for his two boys to enjoy alone or, importantly, with him, and Steve takes him to see the one Steve installed in his own backyard for the exact same reasons. Back at the site, Tom and master carpenter Norm Abram use - and approve of - polyurethane exterior trim, while Steve joins acoustical consultant John Storyk as he works with David to tackle some of the sound issues in the new music room. Master carpenter Norm Abram and Tom discuss the state of the original diamond-paned bumpout, its usefulness as a place for plants, and the possibility of replacing it with a proper greenhouse. To research the concept, architect Steve Holt shows Steve around a nearby guest house he designed, complete with a very high-end conservatory.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=bc8f8f\n|EpisodeNumber=23-14\n|Title=The Manchester House - 14\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|December 22, 2001}}\n|ShortSummary=Master carpenter Norm Abram sees how the faulty east chimney has been fixed by specialist Mark Schaub and his crew: the game room fireplace is bricked over, but the guest room above gets a new hearth, firebox and gas \"coal grate.\" Richard Trethewey shows Steve how he's using a beat-up airhandler to provide dry, clean temporary jobside heat and gives an overview on how he plans to heat and cool the house - radiant floor heat on the first floor, flat-panel radiators for the second and third, and a/c only in select rooms on the second and third. Steve finds Roger Cook out back, where he's been denied Conservation Commission approval to cut down trees near the ocean, though he is allow to limb them up for a better view. Out at the auto court, Roger shows Steve how he cuts 2\" thick granite in a curve. Steve and homeowner Janet McCue visit a garden shop to see how various paving options look before she commits to buying materials for the landscape. Back at the house, architect Steve Holt describes a mid-job design change - a decision not to give the second-floor bays walkout decks - and Tom and master carpenter Norm Abram carefully pull up a hard-pine floor for use elsewhere in the building.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=bc8f8f\n|EpisodeNumber=23-15\n|Title=The Manchester House - 15\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|December 29, 2001}}\n|ShortSummary=The last of the ipe decking is arrived, Steve and master carpenter Norm Abram check out the installation method on the front deck: pressure-treated sleepers spiked into the concrete slab, with the ipe held down with marine adhesive and a few stainless steel finish nails. The wood itself is so dense that it takes oil with difficulty - it's fine to leave it unfinished. Master carpenter Norm Abram finds out how homeowner Janet McCue has fare in her attempt to strip the diamond-paned curved sash on the historic bump-out. It was an arduous process - an alternative would be to send them out for stripping, but that would necessitate reglazing and repainting the entire sash, even though only the exterior needs it. Steve sees the expanded foam insulation going in and talks to the company president about its relatively high cost (2 to 3 times of that fiberglass), its performance, and its environmental record (which is excellent). Richard Trethewey shows our master carpenter aluminum-clad PEX tubing used for plumbing the radiators, as well as some quick-connect fittings for attaching it to the copper lines in the basement.

Janet takes Kevin to see the inspiration for her project, a small garage apartment that's part of an estate currently on the market in Concord for $7.2 million.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=0000ff\n|EpisodeNumber=25-02\n|Title=Roadblocks to Turning a Former Chicken Coop into a Cottage\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 18, 2003}}\n|ShortSummary=Work can't begin at the jobsite until permits are issued, so Kevin takes homeowner Janet Bernard to meet the Concord building commissioner, John Minty, to see what potential roadblocks she's facing in trying to turn an accessory building into a full-time residence. Then Kevin meets local architect Holly Cratsley to see a new home she designed to look like an old home, and an accompanying timber frame barn. Meanwhile, with flashlights, ladders, and archival photographs, Norm and preservation architect Leonard Baum reconstruct the architectural history of the project house, learning that the building started out as a one-story chicken coop with a hip roof, and that it is indeed older than the zoning law itself \u2014 a finding that's essential to moving forward with the town.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=0000ff\n|EpisodeNumber=25-03\n|Title=Nothing is as Easy as it Looks\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|October 25, 2003}}\n|ShortSummary=Kevin arrives to find the newly issued building permit affixed to the building and work finally getting underway. Architect Holly Cratsley is officially on board, and Kevin pays a visit to her office to see the first pass at floor plans, elevations, and a scale model of the cottage. Zoning laws only allow for a modest increase in overall volume, so the new one-bedroom cottage will be less than 1,000 square feet when it's done. Norm and Tom prepare to brace a bowed wall, but find a badly rotted sill that needs replacing before they can proceed. Putting Kevin to work, they build two temporary walls; once they're in place, they take the weight off the compromised outside wall. The rotted sill comes out and a new, pressure-treated sill goes in. Then Kevin visits a converted carriage house in Winchester, Massachusetts, that's full of great ideas for the project. Unexpected rain postpones the excavation for the foundation of the new addition.\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list|LineColor=0000ff\n|EpisodeNumber=25-04\n|Title=It's Starting to Look Like a
