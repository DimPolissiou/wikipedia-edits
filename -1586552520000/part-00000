Open to horses age three and older, it is contested on dirt over a distance of one mile (8 [[furlong]]s). Starting in 2014, it is now run on the same day as the [[Belmont Stakes]] in early June.\n\nThe Met Mile is one of the most prestigious American races outside of the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|Triple Crown]] and [[Breeders' Cup]]. It is known as a \"stallion-making race\" as the distance of a mile often displays the winner's \"brilliance\", referring to an exceptional turn of foot. Winners of the race who went on to become notable stallions include [[Tom Fool]] (1953), [[Native Dancer]] (1954), [[Buckpasser]] (1967), [[Fappiano]] (1981), [[Gulch (horse)|Gulch]] (1987-88), and [[Ghostzapper]] (2005).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Russo|first1=Nicole|title=Met Mile still a source of successful stallions {{!}} Daily Racing Form|url=http://www.drf.com/news/met-mile-still-source-successful-stallions|website=Daily Racing Form|accessdate=10 June 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe Met Mile was first run in 1891 at [[Morris Park Racetrack]]. Prior to 1897, it was run at a distance of {{frac|1|1|8}} miles.  In 1904, its location was moved to Belmont Park.  There it remained except for nine years; 1960 to 1967, 1969, and 1975 when it was hosted by [[Aqueduct Racetrack]].  It was not run in 1895, 1911, and 1912.\n\nThe Met Mile was the first of three races in the [[New York Handicap Triple]] series, followed by the [[Suburban Handicap]] and [[Brooklyn Handicap]]. Four horses have won the Handicap Triple:\n* [[Whisk Broom II]] (1913)\n* [[Tom Fool]] (1953)\n* [[Kelso (horse)|Kelso]] (1961)\n* [[Fit to Fight]] (1984)\n\nThe Met Mile and the Brooklyn are now run on the same day as part of the Belmont Stakes undercard,<ref>{{cite web|title=Belmont Stakes 2016 Schedule|url=http://www.belmontstakes.org/belmont-stakes-schedule/|website=www.belmontstakes.org|accessdate=11 June 2016}}</ref> so it is no longer possible to complete the Handicap Triple.\n\nThere was a [[Tie (draw)|Dead Heat]] for first in 1905.<ref>https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D01E3DA1E3DE633A25756C0A9639C946497D6CF</ref>\n\n==Records==\n'''Time record:''' \n* 1:32.73 - [[Frosted (horse)|Frosted]] (2016)\n\n'''Largest Margin'''\n* 14 1/4  - [[Frosted (horse)|Frosted]] (2016)\n'''Most wins by an owner'''\n* 6 - [[Greentree Stable]] (1940, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1953, 1963)\n\n'''Most wins by a [[jockey]]'''\n* 5 - [[John Velazquez]] (1996, 1999, 2010, 2012, 2014)\n\n'''Most wins by a [[Horse trainer|trainer]]'''\n* 6 - [[John M.

Open to horses age three and older, it is contested on dirt over a distance of one mile (8 [[furlong]]s). Starting in 2014, it is now run on the same day as the [[Belmont Stakes]] in early June.\n\nThe Met Mile is one of the most prestigious American races outside of the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|Triple Crown]] and [[Breeders' Cup]]. It is known as a \"stallion-making race\" as the distance of a mile often displays the winner's \"brilliance\", referring to an exceptional turn of foot. Winners of the race who went on to become notable stallions include [[Tom Fool]] (1953), [[Native Dancer]] (1954), [[Buckpasser]] (1967), [[Fappiano]] (1981), [[Gulch (horse)|Gulch]] (1987-88), and [[Ghostzapper]] (2005).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Russo|first1=Nicole|title=Met Mile still a source of successful stallions {{!}} Daily Racing Form|url=http://www.drf.com/news/met-mile-still-source-successful-stallions|website=Daily Racing Form|accessdate=10 June 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe Met Mile was first run in 1891 at [[Morris Park Racetrack]]. Prior to 1897, it was run at a distance of {{frac|1|1|8}} miles.  In 1904, its location was moved to Belmont Park.  There it remained except for nine years; 1960 to 1967, 1969, and 1975 when it was hosted by [[Aqueduct Racetrack]].  It was not run in 1895, 1911, and 1912.\n\nThe Met Mile was the first of three races in the [[New York Handicap Triple]] series, followed by the [[Suburban Handicap]] and [[Brooklyn Handicap]]. Four horses have won the Handicap Triple:\n* [[Whisk Broom II]] (1913)\n* [[Tom Fool]] (1953)\n* [[Kelso (horse)|Kelso]] (1961)\n* [[Fit to Fight]] (1984)\n\nThe Met Mile and the Brooklyn are now run on the same day as part of the Belmont Stakes undercard,<ref>{{cite web|title=Belmont Stakes 2016 Schedule|url=http://www.belmontstakes.org/belmont-stakes-schedule/|website=www.belmontstakes.org|accessdate=11 June 2016}}</ref> so it is no longer possible to complete the Handicap Triple.\n\nThere was a [[Tie (draw)|Dead Heat]] for first in 1905.<ref>https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D01E3DA1E3DE633A25756C0A9639C946497D6CF</ref>\n\n==Records==\n'''Time record:''' \n* 1:32.73 - [[Frosted (horse)|Frosted]] (2016)\n\n'''Largest Margin'''\n* 14 1/4  - [[Frosted (horse)|Frosted]] (2016)\n'''Most wins by an owner'''\n* 6 - [[Greentree Stable]] (1940, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1953, 1963)\n\n'''Most wins by a [[jockey]]'''\n* 5 - [[John Velazquez]] (1996, 1999, 2010, 2012, 2014)\n\n'''Most wins by a [[Horse trainer|trainer]]'''\n* 6 - [[John M.

She is best known for her role as [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]]'s [[flagship]] at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] on 21 October 1805.\n\nShe additionally served as [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Keppel]]'s flagship at [[Battle of Ushant (1778)|Ushant]], [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Howe]]'s flagship at [[Battle of Cape Spartel|Cape Spartel]] and [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Jervis]]'s flagship at [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|Cape St Vincent]]. After 1824, she was relegated to the role of harbour ship.\n\nIn 1922, she was moved to a [[dry dock]] at [[Portsmouth]], [[England]], and preserved as a [[museum ship]]. She has been the flagship of the [[First Sea Lord]] since October 2012 and is the world's oldest naval ship still in [[Ship commissioning|commission]], with {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1778}} years' service as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}.\n\n==Construction==\nIn December 1758, [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Pitt the Elder]], in his role as head of the British government, placed an order for the building of 12 ships, including a [[first-rate]] ship that would become ''Victory''.<ref>Mckay (2000) p.9</ref> During the 18th century, ''Victory'' was one of ten first-rate ships to be constructed.<ref>Christopher (2010) p.16</ref> The outline plans were based on {{HMS|Royal George|1756|6}} which had been launched at [[Woolwich Dockyard]] in 1756, and the naval architect chosen to design the ship was [[Sir Thomas Slade]] who, at the time, was the [[Surveyor of the Navy]].<ref>Christopher (2010) pp.15 & 16</ref> She was designed to carry at least 100 guns. The commissioner of [[Chatham Dockyard]] was instructed to prepare a [[dry dock]] for the construction.<ref>Eastland & Ballantyne (2011) p.13</ref> The [[keel]] was laid on 23 July 1759 in the Old Single Dock (since renamed No. 2 Dock and now Victory Dock), and a name, ''Victory'', was chosen in October 1760.<ref>Christopher (2010) pp.17 & 20</ref> In 1759, the [[Seven Years' War]] was going well for Britain; land victories had been won at [[Battle of Quebec (1759)|Quebec]] and [[Battle of Minden|Minden]] and [[naval battle]]s had been won at [[Battle of Lagos (1759)|Lagos]] and [[Battle of Quiberon Bay|Quiberon Bay]].

Measurements at first light confirmed his fears: the gates were at least 9\u00bd inches too narrow. He told the news to his superior, master shipwright John Allin, who considered abandoning the launch. Larkin asked for the assistance of every available shipwright, and they hewed away enough wood from the gates with their [[adze]]s for the ship to pass safely through.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/feb/22/how-hms-victory-nearly-never-made-it-to-the-battle-of-trafalgar\n|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]\n|date=22 February 2015\n|title=How HMS ''Victory'' nearly never made it to the Battle of Trafalgar\n|last=Kennedy\n|first=Maev\n|authorlink=Maev Kennedy\n|accessdate=22 February 2015 }}</ref> However, the launch itself revealed significant problems in the ship's design, including a distinct list to [[starboard]] and a tendency to sit heavily in the water such that her lower deck gunports were only {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m|1|abbr=on}} above the waterline. The first of these problems was rectified after launch by increasing the ship's [[ballast]] to settle her upright on the keel. The second problem, regarding the siting of the lower gunports, could not be rectified. Instead it was noted in ''Victory''{{'}}s sailing instructions that these gunports would have to remain closed and unusable in rough weather. This had potential to limit ''Victory''{{'}}s firepower, though in practice none of her subsequent actions would be fought in rough seas.<ref name=EB40>Eastland and Ballantyne (2011), pp 40\u201342</ref>\n\nBecause there was no immediate use for her, she was placed [[in ordinary]] and moored in the [[River Medway]].<ref>Christopher (2010) p.20</ref> Internal [[fitting out]] continued over the next four years, and [[sea trial]]s were completed in 1769, after which she was returned to her Medway berth.

This included arming her with a full complement of smooth bore, [[cast iron]] [[cannon]]. Her weaponry was intended to be thirty 42-pounders (19&nbsp;kg) on her lower deck, twenty-eight [[24-pounder long gun]]s (11&nbsp;kg) on her middle deck, and thirty 12-pounders (5&nbsp;kg) on her upper deck, together with twelve 6-pounders on her [[quarterdeck]] and [[forecastle]]. In May 1778, the 42-pounders were replaced by 32-pounders (15&nbsp;kg), but the 42-pounders were reinstated in April 1779; however, there were insufficient 42-pounders available and these were replaced with 32-pounder cannons instead.<ref name=EB40/>\n\n==Early service==\n\n===First battle of Ushant===\n{{Main|Battle of Ushant (1778)}}\n[[File:Combat d'Ouessant juillet 1778 par Theodore Gudin.jpg|thumb|''The first battle of Ushant'' (1778) by Theodore Gudin.

Manoeuvring was made difficult by changing winds and driving rain, but eventually a battle became inevitable, with the British more or less in column and the French in some confusion. However, the French managed to pass along the British line with their most advanced ships. At about a quarter to twelve, ''Victory'' opened fire on {{ship|French ship|Bretagne|1766|2}} of 110 guns, which was being followed by {{ship|French ship|Ville de Paris|1764|2}} of 90 guns.<ref name=C38>Christopher (2010) p.38</ref> The British van escaped with little loss, but Sir [[Hugh Palliser]]'s rear division suffered considerably.

In November 1807 she was relegated to second-rate, with the removal of two 32-pounder cannons and replacement of her middle deck 24-pounders with 18-pounders obtained from other laid-up ships.

Victoria returned for a second visit on 21 October 1844, creating a further burst of interest that lifted annual visitors to more than 22,000.<ref name=Aberg359/> In late April 1854, ''Victory'' sprang a leak and sank.

The impact of so much human traffic also left her increasingly decrepit, particularly in the absence of Admiralty funding for repairs. Sir [[Edward Seymour, 16th Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]], the future [[Duke of Somerset]], visited the vessel in 1886 and considered that \"a more rotten ship never probably flew the pennant.

The school remained on ''Victory'' until 1904, when training was transferred temporarily to {{HMS|Hercules|1868|6}}, and from 1906 to a permanent establishment at the Royal Naval Barracks, Portsmouth.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.rnca.org.uk/node/1035 | title =The First Signal Schools | publisher =Royal Naval Communications Association | accessdate =5 October 2013 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130927005205/http://www.rnca.org.uk/node/1035 | archivedate =27 September 2013 | df =dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDespite her reuse as a school, ''Victory'' continued to deteriorate at her mooring. In 1903 she was accidentally rammed by {{HMS|Neptune|1874|6}}, a successor to the vessel that had towed her to Gibraltar. Emergency repairs prevented her from sinking, but Admiralty again proposed that she be scrapped and it was only the personal intervention of [[Edward VII]] that prevented this from occurring.<ref name=C111>Christopher (2010) p.111</ref> Interest in the ship revived in 1905 when, as part of the centenary celebrations of the Battle of Trafalgar, she was decorated with electric lights powered by a submarine moored alongside.<ref name=C111/> In 1910, the [[Society for Nautical Research]] was created to try to preserve her for future generations, but Admiralty was unable to help, having become embroiled in an escalating arms race; thus by the time Frank H.

Her steering equipment had also been removed or destroyed, along with most of her furnishings.<ref name=Aberg359/>\n\nThe relocation to No. 2 dock sparked public discussion about ''Victory''{{'}}s future location. Suggestions in contemporary newspapers included the creation of a floating plinth atop which she could be preserved as a monument, either in Portsmouth or adjacent to the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich]]. Others proposed a berth beside [[Cleopatra's Needle (London)|Cleopatra's Needle]] on the Thames, or as land-based structure in [[Trafalgar Square]]. Despite popular support, these options were not seriously entertained by Admiralty. The naval architects who had surveyed the ship reported that she was too damaged to be moved; Admiralty formally adopted their advice and No. 2 dock thereafter became ''Victory''{{'}}s permanent home.<ref name=Aberg359/>\n\nDuring the initial restoration period from 1922 to 1929, a considerable amount of structural repair work was carried out above the waterline and mainly above the middle deck. In 1928, [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] was able to unveil a tablet celebrating the completion of the work, although restoration and maintenance still continued under the supervision of the Society for Nautical Research.<ref name=C114/> Restoration was suspended during the [[World War II|Second World War]], and in 1941, ''Victory'' sustained further damage when a 500 lb. bomb<ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-15986730</ref> dropped by the [[Luftwaffe]] broke her keel, as can be seen in Plate 1 in The Anatomy of Nelsons Ships by C Nepean Longridge (1955), destroyed one of the steel cradles and part of the foremast.

She is best known for her role as [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]]'s [[flagship]] at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] on 21 October 1805.\n\nShe additionally served as [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Keppel]]'s flagship at [[Battle of Ushant (1778)|Ushant]], [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Howe]]'s flagship at [[Battle of Cape Spartel|Cape Spartel]] and [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Jervis]]'s flagship at [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|Cape St Vincent]]. After 1824, she was relegated to the role of harbour ship.\n\nIn 1922, she was moved to a [[dry dock]] at [[Portsmouth]], [[England]], and preserved as a [[museum ship]]. She has been the flagship of the [[First Sea Lord]] since October 2012 and is the world's oldest naval ship still in [[Ship commissioning|commission]], with {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1778}} years' service as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}.\n\n==Construction==\nIn December 1758, [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Pitt the Elder]], in his role as head of the British government, placed an order for the building of 12 ships, including a [[first-rate]] ship that would become ''Victory''.<ref>Mckay (2000) p.9</ref> During the 18th century, ''Victory'' was one of ten first-rate ships to be constructed.<ref>Christopher (2010) p.16</ref> The outline plans were based on {{HMS|Royal George|1756|6}} which had been launched at [[Woolwich Dockyard]] in 1756, and the naval architect chosen to design the ship was [[Sir Thomas Slade]] who, at the time, was the [[Surveyor of the Navy]].<ref>Christopher (2010) pp.15 & 16</ref> She was designed to carry at least 100 guns. The commissioner of [[Chatham Dockyard]] was instructed to prepare a [[dry dock]] for the construction.<ref>Eastland & Ballantyne (2011) p.13</ref> The [[keel]] was laid on 23 July 1759 in the Old Single Dock (since renamed No. 2 Dock and now Victory Dock), and a name, ''Victory'', was chosen in October 1760.<ref>Christopher (2010) pp.17 & 20</ref> In 1759, the [[Seven Years' War]] was going well for Britain; land victories had been won at [[Battle of Quebec (1759)|Quebec]] and [[Battle of Minden|Minden]] and [[naval battle]]s had been won at [[Battle of Lagos (1759)|Lagos]] and [[Battle of Quiberon Bay|Quiberon Bay]].

Measurements at first light confirmed his fears: the gates were at least 9\u00bd inches too narrow. He told the news to his superior, master shipwright John Allin, who considered abandoning the launch. Larkin asked for the assistance of every available shipwright, and they hewed away enough wood from the gates with their [[adze]]s for the ship to pass safely through.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/feb/22/how-hms-victory-nearly-never-made-it-to-the-battle-of-trafalgar\n|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]\n|date=22 February 2015\n|title=How HMS ''Victory'' nearly never made it to the Battle of Trafalgar\n|last=Kennedy\n|first=Maev\n|authorlink=Maev Kennedy\n|accessdate=22 February 2015 }}</ref> However, the launch itself revealed significant problems in the ship's design, including a distinct list to [[starboard]] and a tendency to sit heavily in the water such that her lower deck gunports were only {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m|1|abbr=on}} above the waterline. The first of these problems was rectified after launch by increasing the ship's [[ballast]] to settle her upright on the keel. The second problem, regarding the siting of the lower gunports, could not be rectified. Instead it was noted in ''Victory''{{'}}s sailing instructions that these gunports would have to remain closed and unusable in rough weather. This had potential to limit ''Victory''{{'}}s firepower, though in practice none of her subsequent actions would be fought in rough seas.<ref name=EB40>Eastland and Ballantyne (2011), pp 40\u201342</ref>\n\nBecause there was no immediate use for her, she was placed [[in ordinary]] and moored in the [[River Medway]].<ref>Christopher (2010) p.20</ref> Internal [[fitting out]] continued over the next four years, and [[sea trial]]s were completed in 1769, after which she was returned to her Medway berth. She remained there until France joined the [[American War of Independence]] in 1778.<ref>Winfield2010>Winfield (2010), pp.65\u201368</ref> ''Victory'' was now placed in active service as part of a general mobilisation against the French threat.

Suggestions in contemporary newspapers included the creation of a floating plinth atop which she could be preserved as a monument, either in Portsmouth or adjacent to the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich]]. Others proposed a berth beside [[Cleopatra's Needle (London)|Cleopatra's Needle]] on the Thames, or as land-based structure in [[Trafalgar Square]]. Despite popular support, these options were not seriously entertained by Admiralty. The naval architects who had surveyed the ship reported that she was too damaged to be moved; Admiralty formally adopted their advice and No. 2 dock thereafter became ''Victory''{{'}}s permanent home.<ref name=Aberg359/>\n\nDuring the initial restoration period from 1922 to 1929, a considerable amount of structural repair work was carried out above the waterline and mainly above the middle deck. In 1928, [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] was able to unveil a tablet celebrating the completion of the work, although restoration and maintenance still continued under the supervision of the Society for Nautical Research.<ref name=C114/> Restoration was suspended during the [[World War II|Second World War]], and in 1941, ''Victory'' sustained further damage when a 500 lb. bomb<ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-15986730</ref> dropped by the [[Luftwaffe]] broke her keel, as can be seen in Plate 1 in The Anatomy of Nelsons Ships by C Nepean Longridge (1955), destroyed one of the steel cradles and part of the foremast. On one occasion, German radio propaganda claimed that the ship had been destroyed by a bomb, and the [[Admiralty]] had to issue a denial.<ref>Christopher (2010) pp.&nbsp;114\u2013115</ref>\n\n[[File:HMSVictory.jpg|thumb|right|Stern of ''Victory'' circa 2008.]]\n\nIn the 1950s, a number of preventive measures were instigated, including the removal of bulkheads to increase airflow and the fumigating of the ship against the [[deathwatch beetle]]. The following decade saw the replacement of much of the decayed oak with oily hardwoods such as teak and [[Iroko (hardwood)|Iroko]], which were believed to be more resistant to fungus and pests.<ref>Christopher (2010) p.115</ref> The decision to restore ''Victory'' to her Battle of Trafalgar configuration was taken in 1920, but the need to undertake these important repairs meant this was not achieved until 2005, in time for the [[Trafalgar 200]] celebrations.<ref>{{cite web | year =| url = http://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/war-and-conflict/world-war-two/art22897| title = HMS Victory's Reconstructed Grand Magazine Is Unveiled| work= | date=1 July 2004 | author=David Prudames | publisher = Culture 24| accessdate = 5 November 2013 }}</ref> ''Victory''{{'}}s foretopsail was severely damaged during the Battle of Trafalgar, perforated by upwards of 90 cannonballs and other projectiles.

Upon his release, Opie's family has difficulty making ends meet, which contributes to Opie's decision to resume illegal activity with SAMCRO, against Donna's wishes. Agent [[June Stahl]] attempts to recruit Opie which causes her to trick [[Clay Morrow]], SAMCRO's President, into believing that Opie had betrayed the Club and the others with whom he murdered Hefferen, a port commissioner. Clay responded by ordering [[Tig Trager]] to kill Opie and pin it on the One-Niners street gang.

This ultimately leads to the club losing out on a major deal. He travels to Belfast, Northern Ireland to aide Jax, who's searching for his missing son Abel. After Agent Stahl tries to screw SAMCRO, Opie, with the help of [[Wayne Unser|Unser]], targets Agent Stahl in retribution for her role in the death of his wife, Donna. During this confrontation Stahl breaks down crying and begs Opie for her life, to which Opie responds, \"This is what she felt.\" He then shoots Stahl in the back of the head with a MAC-10, instantly killing her. After this, Chibs Telford rigs the scene to look as if the Real IRA murdered Stahl and Jimmy O'Phelan.\n\n===Season 4===\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 4)}}\n\nMembers of SAMCRO are released from prison after serving 14 months for federal weapons charges, due to Stahl's actions. They return to their hometown of [[Charming (Sons of Anarchy)|Charming, California]] where they are disturbed by the sight of signs for a new real estate development in their quiet town, spearheaded by the town's new mayor [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Miscellaneous|Jacob Hale, Jr.]] and [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Miscellaneous|Elliott Oswald]], whose land was seized for the project under [[eminent domain]]. On their way into town, they encounter the town's new sheriff, [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Lieutenant Eli Roosevelt|Eli Roosevelt]], who together with Assistant U.S. Attorney [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Lincoln Potter|Lincoln Potter]] has convened a secret task force to shut down the club's gunrunning operation. Opie and fianc\u00e9e [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Lyla Winston|Lyla]] get married in a ceremony on an Indian reservation. During the wedding, Jax and Clay kill Russian mob boss [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Viktor Putlova|Viktor Putlova]], while other members seize the Russian's guns and use them to wipe out the rest of the mob. Opie discovers birth control in Lyla's dressing room. Angry that she is sabotaging their attempts to conceive, he sleeps with Ima. Lyla arrives at the clubhouse to find Ima leaving Opie's room. Opie says that he did it because he found her birth control pills, and when she admits to having an abortion, he tells her that he is leaving her until she decides what she wants. Jax lures Ima into her dressing room and throws her against a table, warning her to stay away from his family and the clubhouse.\n\nAs the gang votes on the future of Clay's presidency, the clubhouse is attacked by the Lobos Sonora cartel, who drop off the severed heads of two SAMTAZ members, including club president Armando's. One cartel member is captured in the attack, but the Mayans are hit simultaneously, losing three men and a truck full of drugs. Piney demands that Clay withdraw the club from the drug business, threatening to deliver John Teller's letters to the club if he fails. Later that night, Clay arrives at Piney's house and kills him, scrawling the signature of the Lobos Sonora cartel on an old photo of the Sons of Anarchy's founding 'First 9.'\n\nTig, and Opie turn to Lyla for help locating Georgie Caruso to punish him for inadvertently helping Hale. As they stuff him in the trunk of a car, he admits to sending men after Luann, but only with the intention of roughing her up. Tig and Opie fill his car with bullets. Opie takes the tow truck up to Piney's cabin and finds his father dead. Unser follows him to the cabin and tells him that Clay is the man responsible. Opie's trust in Jax and the club is broken as he seeks revenge. He later arrives at the club and shoots Clay twice. In an attempt to stop Opie, Jax shoots him in the wrist, and takes him to his home, where he stays hidden.\n\n===Season 5===\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 5)}}\n{{expand section|date=June 2019}}\n\nOpie rebuffs Jax's offer to sit at the table due to Jax's decision in keeping Clay at the table.

They return to their hometown of [[Charming (Sons of Anarchy)|Charming, California]] where they are disturbed by the sight of signs for a new real estate development in their quiet town, spearheaded by the town's new mayor [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Miscellaneous|Jacob Hale, Jr.]] and [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Miscellaneous|Elliott Oswald]], whose land was seized for the project under [[eminent domain]]. On their way into town, they encounter the town's new sheriff, [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Lieutenant Eli Roosevelt|Eli Roosevelt]], who together with Assistant U.S. Attorney [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Lincoln Potter|Lincoln Potter]] has convened a secret task force to shut down the club's gunrunning operation. Opie and fianc\u00e9e [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Lyla Winston|Lyla]] get married in a ceremony on an Indian reservation. During the wedding, Jax and Clay kill Russian mob boss [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Viktor Putlova|Viktor Putlova]], while other members seize the Russian's guns and use them to wipe out the rest of the mob. Opie discovers birth control in Lyla's dressing room. Angry that she is sabotaging their attempts to conceive, he sleeps with Ima. Lyla arrives at the clubhouse to find Ima leaving Opie's room. Opie says that he did it because he found her birth control pills, and when she admits to having an abortion, he tells her that he is leaving her until she decides what she wants. Jax lures Ima into her dressing room and throws her against a table, warning her to stay away from his family and the clubhouse.\n\nAs the gang votes on the future of Clay's presidency, the clubhouse is attacked by the Lobos Sonora cartel, who drop off the severed heads of two SAMTAZ members, including club president Armando's. One cartel member is captured in the attack, but the Mayans are hit simultaneously, losing three men and a truck full of drugs. Piney demands that Clay withdraw the club from the drug business, threatening to deliver John Teller's letters to the club if he fails. Later that night, Clay arrives at Piney's house and kills him, scrawling the signature of the Lobos Sonora cartel on an old photo of the Sons of Anarchy's founding 'First 9.'\n\nTig, and Opie turn to Lyla for help locating Georgie Caruso to punish him for inadvertently helping Hale. As they stuff him in the trunk of a car, he admits to sending men after Luann, but only with the intention of roughing her up. Tig and Opie fill his car with bullets. Opie takes the tow truck up to Piney's cabin and finds his father dead. Unser follows him to the cabin and tells him that Clay is the man responsible. Opie's trust in Jax and the club is broken as he seeks revenge. He later arrives at the club and shoots Clay twice. In an attempt to stop Opie, Jax shoots him in the wrist, and takes him to his home, where he stays hidden.\n\n===Season 5===\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 5)}}\n{{expand section|date=June 2019}}\n\nOpie rebuffs Jax's offer to sit at the table due to Jax's decision in keeping Clay at the table. Opie is beaten to death and his wake is held at the clubhouse with every member of SAMCRO in attendance.\n\n==Development and reception==\n[[File:Ryan Hurst in 2017.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|right|[[Ryan Hurst]] portrays Opie Winston]]\n\n[[Ryan Hurst]] portrays Opie on ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/walking-dead-ryan-hurst-cast-as-beta-1137739 |title='The Walking Dead' Adds 'Sons of Anarchy' Star as Key Comic Book Villain |last=Wigler |first=Josh |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=August 27, 2018}}</ref> Hurst was promoted to main star billing status starting in [[Sons of Anarchy (season 2)|season two]].

They spoke an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language also known as ''Pamlico'' or [[Carolina Algonquian language|''Carolina Algonquian'']].\n\n== Geography ==\n[[Image:Pamlico lang.png|thumb|250px|Pamlico]]\n\nThe Pamlico Indians lived on the [[Pamlico River]] in North Carolina. Named after them were [[Pamlico Sound]], the largest sound in North Carolina, and [[Pamlico County, North Carolina|Pamlico County]]. They are one of the most southerly [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] tribes on the Atlantic seaboard and the most southerly ones for which scholars collected a vocabulary.\n\n== History ==\nThe Raleigh colonists referred to the Pamlico in 1585-86 by the name ''Pomoui''.\n\n===17th century history===\n[[Image:Arrival of Englishmen in North Carolina - 1585.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The Arrival of the Englishmen in Virginia, 1607.]] \nIn 1696, [[smallpox]], called \"A great Mortality\", devastated the Pamlico and neighboring Algonquian communities and reduced their populations.  In 1701 the explorer [[John Lawson (explorer)|John Lawson]] noted their Algonquian language and vocabulary (Lawson, 1860). By 1710 the Pamlico people were so limited that they lived in a single small village.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncpedia.org/pamlico-indians|title=Pamlico Indians {{!}} NCpedia|website=www.ncpedia.org|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Village of Secotan.jpg|thumb|Algonquian village on the Pamlico River estuary]]\nBy 1709 the total North Carolina Algonquian population was down to some 600 from at least several thousand at the time of English encounter. The [[Tuscarora War]], 1711-1713, claimed more fatalities among the Algonquian allies than of the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]]. In the late stages, the Tuscarora turned on some of their allies.  They likely incorporated some of the Pamlico as [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|slaves]]. By the end of the century, only a handful of Algonkians remained.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pamlico|title=Pamlico {{!}} people|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\nWith the decrease in numbers came the loss of tribal lands. Thus, the [[Weapemeoc Indians]] sold their lands on [[Albemarle Sound]] in 1660 and 1662 and started to move to the interior. By 1697 they complained against the encroachments of white settlers in their new location. The \nEnglish assigned a reservation on Bennetts Creek to the Chawanokes (Chowan) before 1700; they reduced its sized from 12 to {{convert|6|sqmi|km2}} by 1707; the Chowanoke sold off land in 1713. \nAfter the Tuscarora War, the Machapunga also were assigned to a reservation.  Other groups on the  Pamlico Sound joined either the [[Machapunga]] or the Tuscarora.\n\nWith growing white presence in eastern Carolina, more products of European origin were introduced to the Indians. Guns were regularly used instead of bows and arrows during the eighteenth century. Iron hatchets had likewise replaced wooden clubs. English clothes were also widely used by the Indians. The [[Roanoke tribe|Roanoke]] chief had an English-style house built in 1654.\n\nOther practices persisted through the nineteenth century, including the women making baskets of rushes and [[Chrysopsis mariana|silk grass]].  They decorated them with woven-in life motifs.\n\n===18th century history===\n[[Image:An old man in his winter clothes (1590).jpg|thumb|An aged Native man from Pomeiock, c. 1590]]\nDuring the seventeenth century, the Chawanoke were in frequent and partly hostile contact with their Virginia Algonquian neighbors. Their traditional hostilities with the [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]] Tuscarora continued during that tribe's war with the whites, when they were actively engaged in expeditions against the hostiles. The Machapungas and other tribes of Pamlico Sound, however, changed their alliances: before 1700 they were still at war with the Tuscarora and [[Coree]], but in 1711 they sided with them against the English. The [[Hatteras Indians|Hatteras]], [[Weapemeoc]]  ([[Paspatank]] or [[Pasquotank people|Pasquotank]], [[Poteskeet]], [[Perquimans]] and [[Yeopim]]) Indians were at that time the most acculturated groups; they remained on the side of the English.\n\nExcept for the [[Tuscarora War]], there was little open fighting between the Algonquian and English colonists.  They had suffered more from epidemics of infectious diseases. Due to small numbers, trade was of little importance.\n\nSale of strong liquors to the Indians was probably the greatest problem created by white traders around 1700. Alcohol was banned from Indian towns in 1703, but the prohibition was never strictly enforced. Little was done for Indian education, even though native languages were being replaced by English during the eighteenth century.\n\nA small number of Indians were [[baptized]] as [[Christians]] by [[Anglican]] ministers throughout the late seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries. Tribe members starting adopting English names (sometimes as second names to be used occasionally) shortly after 1700. Indian [[medicine men]] earned money by treating white settlers as well as their own people. Some settlers in North Carolina bought Indians as slaves, and others transported them to northern markets. The extent of Indian servitude and slavery is not accurately known.\n\n==Culture==\n[[Image:The town of Pomeiock.jpg|thumb|The town of Pomeiock]]\nThe Pamlico created distinctive [[Dugout (boat)|dugout canoes]], and traveled extensively.

Besides hunting and agriculture, the coastal groups still relied much on fishing and shellfish gathering, drying the products for preservation on reed hurdles over an open fire or in the sun. Sturgeon was not used as a food by the Indians along the coast. Cattle raising is documented for the Paspatanks around 1700 (Lawson 1709). The Tuscarora War disturbed the economic balance of many of the Algonquian groups: the fields of the Machapunga and their allies were destroyed by the English.  The Hatteras were prevented from planting by their enemies, and in 1714-1715 needed supplies from the colonial authorities to survive.\n\nPolitical organization with [[hereditary]] [[chiefdoms]] was still functioning around 1700. Chiefs' corpses were buried in the temples as before. Commoners could purchase the right of burial in the temple precinct with enough money. Shell beads (wampum) served as money, for example, to compensate victims of crimes.\n\n===Ceremonies===\nMarriage restrictions that prohibited marrying first cousins made it difficult to find mates within rapidly shrinking communities. Resulting marriages into other tribes certainly strengthened intertribal bonds.\n\nThe ''huskenaw'' rite appears to have been used as an initiation for both boys and girls. It was held around Christmas and lasted for five or six weeks, during which the adolescents were separated in a special building outside the village. There were some colonial reports that two of 50 families among the Machapungas practiced male circumcision, but this was not typical of the Native Americans.\n\n==See also==\n[[File:North carolina algonkin(2).png|right|thumb|200px|Distribution of [[Carolina Algonquian]] speaking peoples]]\n*[[Algonquian languages]]\n*[[Algonquian peoples]]\n{{commons category}}\n*[[Pamlico County, North Carolina]]\n*[[Roanoke tribe]]\n<ref>https://www.pamlicocapital.com</ref>\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands]]\n[[Category:Algonquian peoples]]\n[[Category:Native American history of North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Native American tribes in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Pamlico County, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Algonquian ethnonyms]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Pimlico}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2017}}\n{{Infobox ethnic group\n|group      = Pamlico\n|image=A noblewoman of Pomeiock (1590).jpg\n|image_caption    = A noblewoman of Pomeiock\n|population = Extinct as a tribe\n|regions    = [[North Carolina]]\n|region1    = \n|region2    = \n|pop1       = \n|ref1       = \n|religions  = [[Tribal religion]] (historical)\n|languages  = [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] (historical) \n|related    = [[Chowanoke]], [[Machapunga]]\n}}\n\nThe '''Pamlico''' (also ''Pampticough'', ''Pomouik'', ''Pomeiok'') were  [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]] of [[North Carolina]].

Like many types of yogurt, strained yogurt is often made from milk that has been enriched by boiling off some of its water content, or by adding extra [[butterfat]] and [[powdered milk]]. In Europe and North America, it is often made from low-fat or fat-free milk. In [[Iceland]], a similar product named [[skyr]] is made.\n\nStrained yogurt is generally marketed in North America as \"Greek yogurt\" and in Britain as \"Greek-style yoghurt\",<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25954228 BBC:'Greek' yoghurt Chobani firm loses legal battle, 29 January 2014]. In Britain the name \"Greek\" may only be applied to yoghurt made in Greece</ref> though strained yogurt is also widely eaten in [[Levantine cuisine|Levantine]], [[Mediterranean cuisine|Eastern Mediterranean]], [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]], [[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]] and [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]] cuisines, wherein it is often used in cooking (as it is high enough in fat content to avoid [[curdling]] at higher temperatures). Such dishes may be cooked or raw, savoury or sweet. Due to the straining process to remove excess whey, even non-fat varieties of strained yogurt are much thicker, richer, and creamier than yogurts that have not been strained. Since the straining process removes the whey, or fluid, from the milk solids, it requires substantially more plain yogurt to produce a cup of strained yogurt, so the cost to make it is increased accordingly. Thickeners, such as [[pectin]], [[locust bean gum]], starches or [[guar gum]], listed in the ingredients indicate straining was not the method used to consolidate the milk solids. Marketing of Greek or Greek-style yogurt in the United States allows the use of more thickeners instead of straining, so there is little difference between the yogurt of years prior to the introduction of strained yogurt other than an increase of thickeners, even though the price is now higher for the original, unstrained products.

Besides being used fresh, labneh is also dried then formed into balls, sometimes covered with herbs or spices, and stored under [[olive oil]]. Labneh is a popular [[mezze]] dish and [[sandwich]] ingredient. A common sandwich in the Middle East is one of labneh, mint, thyme, and olive on pita bread. The flavour depends largely on the sort of milk used: labneh from [[cow's milk]] has a rather mild flavour. Also the quality of [[olive oil]] topping influences the taste of labneh. Milk from camels and other animals is used in labneh production in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries.\n\nIn [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]],  [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Lebanon]], [[Egypt]], and [[Syria]], labneh is made by straining the liquid out of yogurt until it takes on a consistency similar to a soft cheese. It tastes like tart sour cream or heavy strained yogurt and is a common breakfast dip.<ref name=\"haaretz.com\">Debra Kamin.

[[Haaretz]]</ref> It is usually eaten in a fashion similar to [[hummus]], spread on a plate and drizzled with olive oil and often, dried mint. It is also often paired as a dip with the mixed herb blend [[za'atar]].\n\n[[Bedouin]] also produce a dry, hard labneh (''labaneh malboudeh'', similar to Central Asian [[Kashk|qurut]]) that can be stored. Strained labneh is pressed in cheese cloth between two heavy stones and later sun dried. This dry labneh is often eaten with [[khubz]] (Arabic bread), in which both khubz and labneh are mixed with water, animal fat, and salt, and rolled into balls.\n\nLabneh is the main ingredient in [[jameed]], which is in turn used in [[mansaf]], the national dish of [[Jordan]].\n\n''Labaneh bil zayit'', \"labaneh in oil\", consists of small balls of dry labneh kept under oil, where it can be preserved for over a year. As it ages it turns more sour.\n\nIn Egypt, it is eaten with savoury accompaniments such as olives and oil, and also with a sweetener such as honey, as a snack or breakfast food. Areesh cheese (or arish, {{lang-ar|\u062c\u0628\u0646\u0629 \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0634}}) is a type of cheese that originated in [[Egypt]].

Like many types of yogurt, strained yogurt is often made from milk that has been enriched by boiling off some of its water content, or by adding extra [[butterfat]] and [[powdered milk]]. In Europe and North America, it is often made from low-fat or fat-free milk. In [[Iceland]], a similar product named [[skyr]] is made.\n\nStrained yogurt is generally marketed in North America as \"Greek yogurt\" and in Britain as \"Greek-style yoghurt\",<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25954228 BBC:'Greek' yoghurt Chobani firm loses legal battle, 29 January 2014]. In Britain the name \"Greek\" may only be applied to yoghurt made in Greece</ref> though strained yogurt is also widely eaten in [[Levantine cuisine|Levantine]], [[Mediterranean cuisine|Eastern Mediterranean]], [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]], [[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]] and [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]] cuisines, wherein it is often used in cooking (as it is high enough in fat content to avoid [[curdling]] at higher temperatures). Such dishes may be cooked or raw, savoury or sweet. Due to the straining process to remove excess whey, even non-fat varieties of strained yogurt are much thicker, richer, and creamier than yogurts that have not been strained. Since the straining process removes the whey, or fluid, from the milk solids, it requires substantially more plain yogurt to produce a cup of strained yogurt, so the cost to make it is increased accordingly. Thickeners, such as [[pectin]], [[locust bean gum]], starches or [[guar gum]], listed in the ingredients indicate straining was not the method used to consolidate the milk solids. Marketing of Greek or Greek-style yogurt in the United States allows the use of more thickeners instead of straining, so there is little difference between the yogurt of years prior to the introduction of strained yogurt other than an increase of thickeners, even though the price is now higher for the original, unstrained products. In western Europe and the US, strained yogurt has increased in popularity compared to unstrained yogurt. Since the straining process removes some of the [[lactose]], strained yogurt is lower in sugar than unstrained yogurt.<ref name=\"mother\"/>\n\nIt was reported in 2012 that most of the growth in the $4.1 billion US yogurt industry came from the strained yogurt sub-segment, typically marketed as \"Greek yogurt\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/article/AP7fc6a591c5894845953163cf3e221c52.html |title=Greek yogurt on a marathon-like growth spur|work= Wall Street Journal|agency= Associated Press|date= 22 January 2012}}</ref><ref name=Neuman>{{cite news|author=Neuman, William |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/13/business/demand-for-greek-style-helps-form-a-yogurt-cluster-in-new-york.html |title=Greek Yogurt a Boon for New York State|work=The New York Times|date= 12 January 2012}}</ref> In the US there is no legal definition of Greek yogurt, and yogurt thickened with thickening agents may also be sold as \"Greek yogurt\" even though it is not necessarily strained yogurt.<ref name=theKitchn>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekitchn.com/greek-yogurt-wars-high-tech-shortcuts-vs-purists-174420 |title=Greek Yogurt Wars: The High-Tech Shortcuts vs. The Purists|website=theKitchn|accessdate=24 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Variations by area==\n===Asia===\n====Central Asia====\nIn the cuisines of many [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]], and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] peoples (e.g. in [[Azerbaijani cuisine|Azerbaijani]], [[Afghan cuisine|Afghan]], [[Tatar cuisine|Tatar]], [[Tajik cuisine|Tajik]], [[Uzbek cuisine|Uzbek]], and other [[Central Asian cuisine]]s), a type of strained yogurt called ''chak(k)a''<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Meyer\n | first = Arthur L.\n | authorlink =\n | author2=Jon M.

It is usually used for making dips served with dates, or served as a side dish. It is also dried and preserved for winter use.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Middle East====\nStrained yogurt is known as ''labneh'' (''labna'', ''labni'', ''lebni'', or ''labani''; Arabic: \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0629) in the [[Levant]], [[Egypt]], and the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Besides being used fresh, labneh is also dried then formed into balls, sometimes covered with herbs or spices, and stored under [[olive oil]]. Labneh is a popular [[mezze]] dish and [[sandwich]] ingredient. A common sandwich in the Middle East is one of labneh, mint, thyme, and olive on pita bread. The flavour depends largely on the sort of milk used: labneh from [[cow's milk]] has a rather mild flavour. Also the quality of [[olive oil]] topping influences the taste of labneh. Milk from camels and other animals is used in labneh production in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries.\n\nIn [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]],  [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], [[Egypt]], and [[Syria]], labneh is made by straining the liquid out of yogurt until it takes on a consistency similar to a soft cheese. It tastes like tart sour cream or heavy strained yogurt and is a common breakfast dip.<ref name=\"haaretz.com\">Debra Kamin. [http://www.haaretz.com/travel-in-israel/tourist-tip-of-the-day/tourist-tip-242-labneh.premium-1.525323 Tourist tip #242:Labheh]. [[Haaretz]]</ref> It is usually eaten in a fashion similar to [[hummus]], spread on a plate and drizzled with olive oil and often, dried mint. It is also often paired as a dip with the mixed herb blend [[za'atar]].\n\n[[Bedouin]] also produce a dry, hard labneh (''labaneh malboudeh'', similar to Central Asian [[Kashk|qurut]]) that can be stored. Strained labneh is pressed in cheese cloth between two heavy stones and later sun dried. This dry labneh is often eaten with [[khubz]] (Arabic bread), in which both khubz and labneh are mixed with water, animal fat, and salt, and rolled into balls.\n\nLabneh is the main ingredient in [[jameed]], which is in turn used in [[mansaf]], the national dish of [[Jordan]].\n\n''Labaneh bil zayit'', \"labaneh in oil\", consists of small balls of dry labneh kept under oil, where it can be preserved for over a year. As it ages it turns more sour.\n\nIn Egypt, it is eaten with savoury accompaniments such as olives and oil, and also with a sweetener such as honey, as a snack or breakfast food. Areesh cheese (or arish, {{lang-ar|\u062c\u0628\u0646\u0629 \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0634}}) is a type of cheese that originated in [[Egypt]].

In Cyprus, strained yogurt is usually made from sheep's milk.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n=====Greece=====\n[[File:Tzatziki Greek meze or appetizer, also used as a sauce.jpg|thumb|[[Tzatziki]], a popular [[meze]] in Greece]]\nStrained yogurt ({{Lang-el|\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03c4\u03b9|translit=strangist\u00f3 giao\u00farti}}) is used in [[Greek cuisine|Greek food]] mostly as the base for [[tzatziki]] dip and as a dessert, with [[honey]], [[Sour Cherry|sour cherry syrup]], or [[spoon sweets]] often served on top. A few savoury Greek dishes use strained yogurt. In Greece, strained yogurt, like yogurt in general, is traditionally made from sheep's milk.

Like other types of soured dairy products, ymer is often consumed at breakfast. Strained yogurt topped with [[muesli]] and [[maple syrup]] is often served at [[brunch]] in caf\u00e9s in Denmark.\n\n=====Netherlands=====\nStrained yogurt is known as ''hangop'', literally meaning 'hang up'. It is a traditional dessert. ''Hangop'' may also be made using buttermilk.\n\n=====United Kingdom=====\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] strained yogurt can only be marketed as \"Greek\" if made in Greece. Strained cows'-milk yogurt not made in Greece is typically sold as \"Greek style\" or \"Greek recipe\" for marketing reasons, typically at lower prices than yogurt made in Greece. Among \"Greek style\" yogurts there is no distinction between those thickened by straining and those thickened through additives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2013/630.html|title=Fage UK Ltd & Anor v Chobani UK Ltd & Anor [2013] EWHC 630 (Ch) (26 March 2013)|work=bailii.org \u00a77}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2012 Chobani UK Ltd. began to sell yogurt made in the United States as \"Greek yogurt\".

Both companies relied on surveys to prove their point; FAGE also relied on the previous industry practice of UK yogurt makers not to label their yogurt as \"Greek yogurt\".
