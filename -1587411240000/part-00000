It lies on the way between [[Udupi]] and [[Mangalore]] beside [[National Highway 66 (India)|National Highway 66]] (previously NH-17). A road from Kapu goes to interior places like [[Shirva, India|Shirva]]. It is 13&nbsp;km south of [[Udupi]] (a town famous for its ancient Krishna Temple) and 40&nbsp;km north of [[Mangalore]] (chief port city of Karnataka).  It is famous for its lighthouse and the three Mariamma temples and a fort built by [[Tippu Sultan]]. Kapu was renamed as Kaup by the British. \n\nThere is a beach on the shore of the [[Arabian Sea]] and a lighthouse. Many films have been shot at this location. Kapu has three Marigudi which attracts devotees from far away places. The sea is much more rougher and intimidating compared to the gentler Malpe beach in [[Udupi]]. It is about 15&nbsp;km from the university town of [[Manipal]] and is a favorite hangout for the students. The beach also sports a bar next to the parking space and a restaurant with beach view. \nThough the sea is mostly calm all year round except rainy season, there have been isolated cases of drowning in this beach.\n\n== Kapu Lighthouse ==\n\nThe Kapu [[Lighthouse|light house]] was built in 1901 and has for these many years stood on the rocks guiding thousands of sailors and warning the presence of dangerous rocks. It stands 27.12 m above the base. The lighthouse is open for visitors between 5:30 AM to 6:30 AM and the panoramic view offered is magnificent.\n\nThe stairs keep getting steeper and steeper as you ascend. At the last spiral there is a room where there are wooden steps, it's more like a ladder to be precise where you will have to snug yourself thru and arrive at the balcony of the [[Lighthouse|Light house]]. You are allowed for just a few minutes before the ticket checker starts asking people to vacate space for more who are waiting.\n \nRemember its best to get up as one of the first batch of people as this will give you a few minutes extra to enjoy the view from the top and may be take a few photos for keeps.\n\n\n\nARLHS World List of Lights (WLOL) IND-091\n\n== Logistics ==\n\nKapu <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nativeplanet.com/travel-guide/kaup-beach-from-udupi-003083.html|title=Native Planet|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>is located around 13&nbsp;km from [[Udupi]] and 45&nbsp;km from [[Mangalore]].  It takes almost 25 minutes to reach Kapu from Udupi. Numerous buses ply to Kapu from the service bus stand at Udupi. Once you disembark from the bus-stop at Kapu, you need to travel a distance of 1.5&nbsp;km to reach the beach. You can take one of the auto-rickshaws or car which are conveniently parked near the bus-stop. From Bangalore, one can reach Kapu by taking a bus to [[Mangalore]] and then take a bus from [[Mangalore]] for Udupi.\n\nThe best time to visit Kapu beach is either during sunrise or sunset. It gets too hot during the day. It's better if one visits in the monsoons.

It lies on the way between [[Udupi]] and [[Mangalore]] beside [[National Highway 66 (India)|National Highway 66]] (previously NH-17). A road from Kapu goes to interior places like [[Shirva, India|Shirva]]. It is 13&nbsp;km south of [[Udupi]] (a town famous for its ancient Krishna Temple) and 40&nbsp;km north of [[Mangalore]] (chief port city of Karnataka).  It is famous for its lighthouse and the three Mariamma temples and a fort built by [[Tippu Sultan]]. Kapu was renamed as Kaup by the British. \n\nThere is a beach on the shore of the [[Arabian Sea]] and a lighthouse. Many films have been shot at this location. Kapu has three Marigudi which attracts devotees from far away places. The sea is much more rougher and intimidating compared to the gentler Malpe beach in [[Udupi]]. It is about 15&nbsp;km from the university town of [[Manipal]] and is a favorite hangout for the students. The beach also sports a bar next to the parking space and a restaurant with beach view. \nThough the sea is mostly calm all year round except rainy season, there have been isolated cases of drowning in this beach.\n\n== Kapu Lighthouse ==\n\nThe Kapu [[Lighthouse|light house]] was built in 1901 and has for these many years stood on the rocks guiding thousands of sailors and warning the presence of dangerous rocks. It stands 27.12 m above the base. The lighthouse is open for visitors between 5:30 AM to 6:30 AM and the panoramic view offered is magnificent.\n\nThe stairs keep getting steeper and steeper as you ascend. At the last spiral there is a room where there are wooden steps, it's more like a ladder to be precise where you will have to snug yourself thru and arrive at the balcony of the [[Lighthouse|Light house]]. You are allowed for just a few minutes before the ticket checker starts asking people to vacate space for more who are waiting.\n \nRemember its best to get up as one of the first batch of people as this will give you a few minutes extra to enjoy the view from the top and may be take a few photos for keeps.\n\n\n\nARLHS World List of Lights (WLOL) IND-091\n\n== Logistics ==\n\nKapu <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nativeplanet.com/travel-guide/kaup-beach-from-udupi-003083.html|title=Native Planet|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>is located around 13&nbsp;km from [[Udupi]] and 45&nbsp;km from [[Mangalore]].  It takes almost 25 minutes to reach Kapu from Udupi. Numerous buses ply to Kapu from the service bus stand at Udupi. Once you disembark from the bus-stop at Kapu, you need to travel a distance of 1.5&nbsp;km to reach the beach. You can take one of the auto-rickshaws or car which are conveniently parked near the bus-stop. From Bangalore, one can reach Kapu by taking a bus to [[Mangalore]] and then take a bus from [[Mangalore]] for Udupi.\n\nThe best time to visit Kapu beach is either during sunrise or sunset. It gets too hot during the day. It's better if one visits in the monsoons. During mornings, the beach is generally empty, so preferable to visit then.\n\n<br />\n\n== Religious Places ==\n\n* Sri Hale Mariamma Temple\n* Koti Chenaya Temple\n* New Maari Gudi\n* Shri Laxmi Janardhana Temple, Kaup\n* Konkani Mutt\n* Sri Vasudeva Temple\n* Islamic Dawah Center Kaup\n* Shree Brahma Baidarkala Garadi - Paniyoor\n* Juma Masjid-Polipu\n\n== Restaurants ==\n\n* The Spicy Kitchen\n*Mandara Yatri Nivas\n*Coastal Family Restaurant & Bar\n*Jawad Restaurant\n*Hotel Vyshali\n*Machli Non Veg Family Restaurant\n*Sagar Ratna\n\n<br />\n\n== Notable People ==\n\n* [[Sandeep Shetty]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay.aspx?newsID=311462|title=Daijiworld|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>-Actor [[Tulu language|Tulu Movies]] <br />\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Light House at Kaup Bech.jpg|Late evening shot of Light house of Kapu beach\nFile:Kaup beach, Udupi, Karnataka 01.jpg|Kapu beach\nFile:Kaup beach, Udupi, Karnataka 02.jpg|Kapu beach\nFile:Kaup beach, Udupi, Karnataka 03.jpg|Kapu beach\nFile:Kaup beach, Udupi, Karnataka 04.jpg|Lighthouse, Kapu beach\nFile:Kaup beach, Udupi, Karnataka 05.jpg|Kapu beach\nFile:Kaup beach, Udupi, Karnataka 06.jpg|Kapu beach\nFile:Kaup beach, Udupi, Karnataka 10.jpg|Kapu beach\nFile:Kaup beach, Udupi, Karnataka 11.jpg|Kapu beach\nFile:Kapu Beach panoramic view.jpg|Kapu Beach panoramic view\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}\n* [https://lifeonweekends.com/2016/10/31/kapu-beach-udupi-karnataka/ The beautiful Kapu Beach - everything you need to know]\n* [http://www.hindu.com/2006/09/26/stories/2006092620030300.htm]\n* [http://thinkingparticle.com/blog/after-rains-kapu-beach Kapu Travel blog]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/anita/14625607/in/set-303456/]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/itsmeritesh/335329285/]\n* [http://rcmysore-portal.kar.nic.in/temples/srihosamariguditemple/ Hosa Marigudi, Kapu]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150726183753/http://www.nswamy.com/kaup/ A Photo essay of Kaup Light House, Udupi]\n{{Hydrology of Karnataka|state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Beaches of Karnataka]]\n[[Category:Villages in Udupi district]]\n[[Category:Geography of Udupi district]]\n", "name_user": "SathyaShetty9", "label": "safe", "comment": "Changed unwanted stuff", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapu,_Karnataka"}

Corral]] and was known for his opposition to the [[Earp family|Earps]]. Behan was sheriff of [[Yavapai County]] from 1871 to 1873. He was married and had two children, but his wife divorced him, accusing him of consorting with prostitutes. He was elected to the [[7th Arizona Territorial Legislature|Seventh Arizona Legislative Assembly]], representing [[Yavapai County, Arizona|Yavapai County]]. In 1881, [[Wyatt Earp]] served for about five months as undersheriff of the eastern half of [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]]. When Wyatt resigned, Behan was appointed to fill his place, which included the mining [[boomtown]] [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]]. When Cochise County was formed in February 1881, Behan was appointed as its first sheriff. Tombstone became the new [[county seat]] and Behan's headquarters. [[Josephine Earp|Sadie Marcus]] was his mistress, possibly as early as 1875 in [[Tip Top, Arizona]], and certainly from 1880 until she found him in bed with another woman and kicked him out in mid-1881.\n\nAfter the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Behan testified at length against the Earps. He supported the  [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]]' statements that they had raised their hands and offered no resistance, and that the Earps and Doc Holliday had murdered three cowboys. After the Earps were exonerated, Deputy U.S. Marshal [[Virgil Earp]] was maimed in an ambush on December 28, 1881, and assistant deputy [[Morgan Earp]] was killed by assassins on March 18, 1882. The [[outlaw]] Cowboys named as suspects in both shootings were either let go on a technicality or were provided alibis by fellow Cowboys. Wyatt Earp killed one of the suspects, [[Frank Stilwell]], in Tucson. Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt and his federal posse set out [[Earp Vendetta Ride|after other suspects]], pursued by Behan and his county posse composed mostly of Cowboys.\n\nBehan's posse never caught up with the much smaller federal posse. The Earps left Tombstone under a cloud of suspicion. Sadie left Tombstone for San Francisco in early 1882, and Wyatt Earp followed her to San Francisco, where they began a lifelong relationship that lasted 46 years. Behan was arrested for [[Graft (politics)|graft]] and later failed to win re-election as sheriff. He later was appointed as the warden of the [[Yuma Territorial Prison]] and had various other government jobs until his death in 1912.\n\n== Early life ==\nBehan was born in October 24, 1844,<ref name=riggs/><ref name=birthdate>{{cite census |title=Twelfth Census of the United States |year=1900 |location=Washington, D.C. |roll=ED 81 |page=3 |line=18}}</ref><ref name=birthdate2>{{cite census |title=Thirteenth Census of the United States |year=1900 |location=Tucson, Pima County, Territory of Arizona |roll=ED 103 |page=13A |line=31}}</ref><ref group=notes>John H.

Searching for a stolen horse belonging to him, Wyatt learned in late 1880 that the horse was in nearby Charleston.

But after being appointed, Behan appointed another man, [[Southern Democrat]] Harry Woods, to the position that Wyatt thought would go to him.\n\nAt the preliminary hearing into Ike's murder charges against the Earps after the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Behan explained that he appointed Woods rather than Earp due to an incident involving a stolen horse of Virgil Earp's, which was recovered by Wyatt from Billy Clanton. This happened sometime after Behan had been appointed undersheriff in November 1880, and his move to Cochise County sheriff the next spring. At the time, Wyatt was not a law officer, but had used the threat of Behan riding out to the Clantons' ranch as a bluff to get Clanton to turn over the horse. As it happened, Behan was riding to the ranch to serve a subpoena related to the ballot-box stuffing incident, not to recover the horse, and the incident embarrassed the [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]] and also Behan, who for a time had been made to look like he was supporting Earp against the Cowboys.\n\n=== Split from Sadie ===\n\nSometime during early 1881, Sadie arrived home to find Behan in bed with the wife of a friend of theirs, and she kicked Behan out<ref name=rasmussen>{{cite news|last=Rasmussen|first=Cecilia|title=LA Then and Now: Mrs. Wyatt Earp Packed Her Own Punch|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/04/local/me-37325|accessdate=29 June 2011 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 4, 2000}}</ref> of the home they had built with her father's money.<ref name=heritagebarra /> One version of the story is that Sadie had taken Albert, who had a hearing impairment, to San Francisco for treatment.

An investigation found that Behan had somehow set aside $5,000 in funds while he was sheriff from unknown sources.<ref name=weiser /> Due to public and legislative unhappiness with Behan's performance, he was last on the Democratic Party's list of nominees for sheriff, an unusual result for a seated sheriff. Behan failed to gain the nomination and thus left office at the end of his term, in November 1882.\n\n== Later life ==\n\nBehan lived primarily in Tombstone through 1886. In 1887, he moved to Yuma, where he became the assistant superintendent of the [[Yuma Territorial Prison|Yuma Penitentiary]]. He killed one of several prisoners who died during a large escape attempt, saving a guard's life.<ref name=metz /> On April 7, 1888, he was promoted to prison superintendent, serving until July 1890.<ref name=metz /> His management of the prison was marked by prison disorder and mismanagement of public funds, generating complaints by the press. The ''Arizona Republic'' noted that $50,000 had passed through prison official's hands without any accounting. He faced censure for misuse of public funds and for running the prison in a \"coarse and brutal manner\" in 1890.<ref name=butler />{{rp|79\u201380}} The complaint against him specifically cited the prison conditions afforded Manuela Fimbres, a woman incarcerated in the Yuma Prison.

(Behan had been a founding member of the \"Anti Chinese League\" in Tombstone).{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} For the next several years he traveled throughout the southwest arresting illegal Chinese immigrants. In 1897 he worked in the U.S. Patent Office, until at the outbreak of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], Behan volunteered for and became corral-master or quartermaster at Tampa, Florida. When this conflict ended, trouble in the Far East began, and in 1900 he served overseas during the [[Boxer Rebellion]].<ref name=metz />\n\nIn 1901, he was living in Willard's Hotel at 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C..

He then moved to El Paso, Texas, where he worked as a purchasing agent for Texas Bitulithic, a paving company. While in El Paso during 1908, he campaigned for sheriff but lost. On December 14, 1910, the acting governor of Arizona Territory gave him a commission as a railroad policeman in Arizona. He followed that with work supervising survey parties repairing levee breaks on the lower Colorado River. During 1911\u201312, he was head of the commissary for the Arizona Eastern Railroad.<ref name=metz />\n\n== Tombstone legacy ==\n\nLong after the gunfight, Behan continued to spread rumors about the Earps. On December 7, 1897, he was quoted in a story in the ''Washington Post'' which reported that he was staying at the Riggs House, a local hotel. The story was reprinted by the ''San Francisco Call'', which quoted Behan describing the Earp's lawbreaking behavior in Tombstone.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=San Francisco Call |volume= 83 |number=7 |date= 7 December 1897 |title=Pioneer Days in Tombstone |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SFC18971207.2.62&srpos=14&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-%22virgil+earp%22------# |access-date=2 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|\"The Clanton brothers and the McLowrys<!-- sic --> were a tough lot of rustlers who were the main perpetrators of the rascailly<!-- sic --> rife in that region.

Corral]] and was known for his opposition to the [[Earp family|Earps]]. Behan was sheriff of [[Yavapai County]] from 1871 to 1873. He was married and had two children, but his wife divorced him, accusing him of consorting with prostitutes. He was elected to the [[7th Arizona Territorial Legislature|Seventh Arizona Legislative Assembly]], representing [[Yavapai County, Arizona|Yavapai County]]. In 1881, [[Wyatt Earp]] served for about five months as undersheriff of the eastern half of [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]]. When Wyatt resigned, Behan was appointed to fill his place, which included the mining [[boomtown]] [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]]. When Cochise County was formed in February 1881, Behan was appointed as its first sheriff. Tombstone became the new [[county seat]] and Behan's headquarters. [[Josephine Earp|Sadie Marcus]] was his mistress, possibly as early as 1875 in [[Tip Top, Arizona]], and certainly from 1880 until she found him in bed with another woman and kicked him out in mid-1881.\n\nAfter the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Behan testified at length against the Earps. He supported the  [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]]' statements that they had raised their hands and offered no resistance, and that the Earps and Doc Holliday had murdered three cowboys. After the Earps were exonerated, Deputy U.S. Marshal [[Virgil Earp]] was maimed in an ambush on December 28, 1881, and assistant deputy [[Morgan Earp]] was killed by assassins on March 18, 1882. The [[outlaw]] Cowboys named as suspects in both shootings were either let go on a technicality or were provided alibis by fellow Cowboys. Wyatt Earp killed one of the suspects, [[Frank Stilwell]], in Tucson. Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt and his federal posse set out [[Earp Vendetta Ride|after other suspects]], pursued by Behan and his county posse composed mostly of Cowboys.\n\nBehan's posse never caught up with the much smaller federal posse. The Earps left Tombstone under a cloud of suspicion. Sadie left Tombstone for San Francisco in early 1882, and Wyatt Earp followed her to San Francisco, where they began a lifelong relationship that lasted 46 years. Behan was arrested for [[Graft (politics)|graft]] and later failed to win re-election as sheriff. He later was appointed as the warden of the [[Yuma Territorial Prison]] and had various other government jobs until his death in 1912.\n\n== Early life ==\nBehan was born in October 24, 1844,<ref name=riggs/><ref name=birthdate>{{cite census |title=Twelfth Census of the United States |year=1900 |location=Washington, D.C. |roll=ED 81 |page=3 |line=18}}</ref><ref name=birthdate2>{{cite census |title=Thirteenth Census of the United States |year=1900 |location=Tucson, Pima County, Territory of Arizona |roll=ED 103 |page=13A |line=31}}</ref><ref group=notes>John H.

But after being appointed, Behan appointed another man, [[Southern Democrat]] Harry Woods, to the position that Wyatt thought would go to him.\n\nAt the preliminary hearing into Ike's murder charges against the Earps after the gunfight at the O.K.

This happened sometime after Behan had been appointed undersheriff in November 1880, and his move to Cochise County sheriff the next spring. At the time, Wyatt was not a law officer, but had used the threat of Behan riding out to the Clantons' ranch as a bluff to get Clanton to turn over the horse. As it happened, Behan was riding to the ranch to serve a subpoena related to the ballot-box stuffing incident, not to recover the horse, and the incident embarrassed the [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]] and also Behan, who for a time had been made to look like he was supporting Earp against the Cowboys.\n\n=== Split from Sadie ===\n\nSometime during early 1881, Sadie arrived home to find Behan in bed with the wife of a friend of theirs, and she kicked Behan out<ref name=rasmussen>{{cite news|last=Rasmussen|first=Cecilia|title=LA Then and Now: Mrs. Wyatt Earp Packed Her Own Punch|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/04/local/me-37325|accessdate=29 June 2011 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 4, 2000}}</ref> of the home they had built with her father's money.<ref name=heritagebarra /> One version of the story is that Sadie had taken Albert, who had a hearing impairment, to San Francisco for treatment.

Frank Stilwell was an assistant Deputy under Behan for several months until shortly before he was a suspect in the Bisbee stage holdup.

Behan attempted to persuade Frank McLaury to give up his weapons, but Frank insisted that he would only give up his guns after City [[Marshal]] Virgil Earp and his brothers were disarmed. While Ike Clanton was planning to leave town, Frank McLaury said he had decided to remain behind to take care of some business. A letter written afterward by their older brother, William McLaury, a judge in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], claimed that both Frank and Tom were planning to conduct business before leaving town to visit him in Fort Worth.

Behan failed to gain the nomination and thus left office at the end of his term, in November 1882.\n\n== Later life ==\n\nBehan lived primarily in Tombstone through 1886. In 1887, he moved to Yuma, where he became the assistant superintendent of the [[Yuma Territorial Prison|Yuma Penitentiary]]. He killed one of several prisoners who died during a large escape attempt, saving a guard's life.<ref name=metz /> On April 7, 1888, he was promoted to prison superintendent, serving until July 1890.<ref name=metz /> His management of the prison was marked by prison disorder and mismanagement of public funds, generating complaints by the press. The ''Arizona Republic'' noted that $50,000 had passed through prison official's hands without any accounting. He faced censure for misuse of public funds and for running the prison in a \"coarse and brutal manner\" in 1890.<ref name=butler />{{rp|79\u201380}} The complaint against him specifically cited the prison conditions afforded Manuela Fimbres, a woman incarcerated in the Yuma Prison.

(Behan had been a founding member of the \"Anti Chinese League\" in Tombstone).{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} For the next several years he traveled throughout the southwest arresting illegal Chinese immigrants. In 1897 he worked in the U.S. Patent Office, until at the outbreak of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], Behan volunteered for and became corral-master or quartermaster at Tampa, Florida. When this conflict ended, trouble in the Far East began, and in 1900 he served overseas during the [[Boxer Rebellion]].<ref name=metz />\n\nIn 1901, he was living in Willard's Hotel at 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C..

He then moved to El Paso, Texas, where he worked as a purchasing agent for Texas Bitulithic, a paving company. While in El Paso during 1908, he campaigned for sheriff but lost. On December 14, 1910, the acting governor of Arizona Territory gave him a commission as a railroad policeman in Arizona. He followed that with work supervising survey parties repairing levee breaks on the lower Colorado River. During 1911\u201312, he was head of the commissary for the Arizona Eastern Railroad.<ref name=metz />\n\n== Tombstone legacy ==\n\nLong after the gunfight, Behan continued to spread rumors about the Earps. On December 7, 1897, he was quoted in a story in the ''Washington Post'' which reported that he was staying at the Riggs House, a local hotel. The story was reprinted by the ''San Francisco Call'', which quoted Behan describing the Earp's lawbreaking behavior in Tombstone.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=San Francisco Call |volume= 83 |number=7 |date= 7 December 1897 |title=Pioneer Days in Tombstone |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SFC18971207.2.62&srpos=14&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-%22virgil+earp%22------# |access-date=2 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|\"The Clanton brothers and the McLowrys<!-- sic --> were a tough lot of rustlers who were the main perpetrators of the rascailly<!-- sic --> rife in that region.

He went to Oxford to study English literature . Although Fischer-M\u00f8ller was to be a lawyer as his father wished, he chose to become a theology student at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. In the summer of 1983, he completed his studies. Peter Fischer-M\u00f8ller gained a [[cand.theol.]] specializing in [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]].\n\n==Priesthood==\nIn 1984 Peter Fischer-M\u00f8ller was ordained as priest and became the parish priest of Terslev and \u00d8rslev Sogne north of [[Haslev]]. In 1999 he also became the parish priest of Ringsted-Sor\u00f8. At the same time, Fischer-M\u00f8ller worked as a lecturer at Haslev Seminary and Preschool.\n\n==Bishop==\n[[Jan Lindhardt]] retired as [[Diocese of Roskilde|Bishop of Roskilde]] in 2008 and choose Peter Fischer-M\u00f8ller as one of five candidates to succeed him. At the first election, Fischer-M\u00f8ller and Henrik Wigh-Poulsen, editor and head of the Grundtvig Academy, received the majority of votes with 562 each. Poul Joachim Stender received twelve votes less and protested over the election results, as there were more voters than ballot papers. Church Minister Birthe R\u00f8nn Hornbech joined the case, and the election board left the election. Peter Fischer-M\u00f8ller received 693 votes and Poul Joachim Stender received 669 votes. Henrik Wigh-Poulsen received 625 votes, but only two candidates passed on to the decisive ballot. At the 2nd round, Fischer-M\u00f8ller received 1174 votes while his opponent Poul Joachim Stenders 1055 votes. On April 27, 2008, Peter Fischer-M\u00f8ller was consecrated bishop in [[Roskilde Cathedral]] and became the 7th bishop of Roskilde. On May 1, 2008, he was formally installed and took office as a bishop after Jan Lindhardt. On January 1, 2010 he became Knight of the [[Order of the Dannebrog]].<ref>Plunkett, John.

It is an architecturally unexceptional three-story masonry structure, built of brick with stone trim, with a full basement.  It houses eight units, two to each floor including the basement.  Its dominant features are projecting rectangular bays on either side of the recessed entry, with bracketed flower boxes on the second and third floors, and a bracketed cornice below the roof.

A native of [[Alabama]], he migrated to Chicago in the late 19th century, where he gained employment as a building contractor.  He became active in local politics, winning election as a Cook County commissioner in 1904.  IN 1915 he was the first African-American to win a seat on Chicago's Board of Aldermen, representing the city's wealthy Second Ward.  In 1928 De Priest was chosen as a late replacement on the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] ticket in the election to Illinois's first Congressional district, replacing the incumbent [[Martin B. Madden]], who died shortly after the primary.  De Priest won, and was seated in Congress over the objections of Southern representatives.  As the first post-Reconstruction African-American in that body, and the first from any northern state, De Priest became a prominent voice on matters of interest to African Americans, working in particular to secure equitable funding for the education of blacks.
