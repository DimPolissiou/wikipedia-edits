In this list, universities are presented in descending order starting from those affiliated with most Fields Medal winners.\n\nThe university affiliations in this list are all official academic affiliations such as degree programs and official academic employment. Non-academic affiliations such as advisory committee and administrative staff are generally excluded. The official academic affiliations fall into three categories: 1) Alumni (graduates and attendees), 2) Long-term academic Staff, and 3) Short-term academic staff. Graduates are defined as those who hold [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]], [[Master's degree|Master's]], [[Doctorate]] or equivalent degrees from a university, while attendees are those who formally enrolled in degree programs at a university but did not complete the programs; thus, honorary degrees, summer attendees, exchange students and auditing students are excluded. The category of \"Long-term academic staff\" consists of [[Academic tenure|tenure]]/tenure-track and equivalent academic positions, while that of \"Short-term academic staff\" consists of lecturers (without tenure), postdoctoral researchers, visiting professors/scholars (visitors), and equivalent academic positions. At any university, the specific academic title solely determines the type of affiliation, regardless of the actual time the position was held by a medalist.\n\nFurther explanations on \"visitors\" under \"Short-term academic staff\" are now presented. 1) All informal or personal visits are excluded from the list; 2) all employment-based visiting positions, which carry teaching/research duties, are included as affiliations in the list; 3) as for award-based visiting positions, to minimize controversy this list takes a conservative view and includes the positions as affiliations only if the medalists were required to assume employment-level duty (teaching/research) or the medalists specifically classified the visiting positions as \"appointment\" or similar in reliable sources such as  their [[curriculum vitae]]. To be specific, some award-based visiting positions such as the \"[[Shiing-Shen Chern]] Visiting Professorship\" in [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] are awards/honors without employment-level duty;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://math.berkeley.edu/about/events/lectures/chern|title=The Chern Lectures {{!}} Department of Mathematics at University of California Berkeley|website=math.berkeley.edu|access-date=2016-04-22}}</ref> attending meetings and giving public lectures, talks or non-curricular seminars are not employment-level duties. Finally, summer visitors are generally excluded from the list unless summer work yielded significant end products such as research publications and components of Fields-winning work, since summer terms are not part of formal academic years; the same rule applies to extension schools of universities.\n\nThe number following a person's name is the year he/she received the Fields Medal; in particular, a number with asterisk (*) means the person received the award while he/she was working at the institution (including [[emeritus]] staff) containing that asterisk. A name underlined implies that this person has been listed for a same institution previously (i.e., multiple affiliations). If a person had multiple positions under one category, only the position with highest rank is considered.\n\nThis list, together with [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation]] and [[List of Turing Award laureates by university affiliation]], presents the university affiliations of people who have won highest honors in fundamental academic disciplines.\n\n== Summary of results ==\n\n=== Top 15 universities worldwide since 1936 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Rank\n! colspan=\"2\" |University\n!Total\n!Alumni\n!Long-term academic staff\n!Short-term academic staff\n!Overlap<ref group=\"Note\" name=\"Overlap\" />\n|-\n|1\n|[[Harvard University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|18\n|7\n|6\n|10\n| \u22125\n|-\n|2\n|[[University of Paris]]<ref group=\"Note\" name=\"Paris\" />\n|{{flagicon|France}}\n|16\n|11\n|8\n|6\n| \u22129\n|-\n|3\n|[[Princeton University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|15\n|7\n|11\n|3\n| \u22126\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |4\n|[[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]]\n|{{flagicon|France}}\n|14\n|12\n|2\n|2\n| \u22122\n|-\n|[[University of California, Berkeley]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|14\n|3\n|7\n|6\n| \u22122\n|-\n|6\n|[[University of Cambridge]]\n|{{flagicon|United Kingdom}}\n|11\n|8\n|6\n|4\n| \u22127\n|-\n|7\n|[[University of Chicago]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|9\n|2\n|6\n|3\n| \u22122\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |8\n|[[Coll\u00e8ge de France]]\n|{{flagicon|France}}\n|8\n|0\n|4\n|4\n|0\n|-\n|[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|8\n|0\n|4\n|4\n|0\n|-\n|[[Stanford University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|8\n|0\n|6\n|2\n|0\n|-\n|11\n|[[Moscow State University]]\n|{{flagicon|Russia}}\n|6\n|6\n|2\n|0\n| \u22122\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |12\n|[[Columbia University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|5\n|1\n|4\n|2\n| \u22122\n|-\n|[[New York University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|5\n|0\n|2\n|3\n|0\n|-\n|[[Stony Brook University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|5\n|0\n|3\n|2\n|0\n|-\n|[[Yale University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|5\n|1\n|2\n|2\n|0\n|}\n\n=== Top 10 universities worldwide since 2000 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Rank\n! colspan=\"2\" |University\n!Total\n!Alumni\n!Long-term academic staff\n!Short-term academic staff\n!Overlap\n|-\n|1\n|[[Princeton University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|6\n|3\n|4\n|1\n| \u22122\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2\n|[[University of California, Berkeley]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|5\n|0\n|1\n|4\n|0\n|-\n|[[University of Paris]]\n|{{flagicon|France}}\n|5\n|4\n|4\n|2\n| \u22125\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |4\n|[[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]]\n|{{flagicon|France}}\n|4\n|4\n|2\n|0\n| \u22122\n|-\n|[[New York University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|4\n|0\n|2\n|2\n|0\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |6\n|[[Harvard University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|3\n|3\n|0\n|2\n| \u22122\n|-\n|[[Stanford University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|3\n|0\n|3\n|0\n|0\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" |8\n|[[\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon|\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon]]\n|{{flagicon|France}}\n|2\n|1\n|1\n|1\n| \u22121\n|-\n|[[ETH Zurich]]\n|{{flagicon|Switzerland}}\n|2\n|0\n|2\n|1\n| \u22121\n|-\n|[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|2\n|0\n|-\n|[[Moscow State University]]\n|{{flagicon|Russia}}\n|2\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|[[Saint Petersburg State University]]\n|{{flagicon|Russia}}\n|2\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|[[Stony Brook University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|2\n|0\n|-\n|[[University of Cambridge]]\n|{{flagicon|UK}}\n|2\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|[[University of Chicago]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|2\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|[[University of Geneva]]\n|{{flagicon|Switzerland}}\n|2\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|}\n\n== Harvard University (1st) ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Affiliates\n!Alumni\n!Long-term academic staff\n!Short-term academic staff\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |[[Harvard University]], [[United States]] {{flagicon|United States}}\n|-\n|18\n|\n#[[Manjul Bhargava]]<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.claymath.org/library/research_award/Bhargava/CV.pdf|title=Clay: Manjul Bhargava|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> (B.A) \u2013 2014\n#[[Maryam Mirzakhani]]<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/people/13092|title=MSRI: Maryam Mirzakhani|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> (PhD) \u2013 2014\n#[[Vladimir Voevodsky]]<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ias.edu/people/faculty-and-emeriti/voevodsky|title=Vladimir Voevodsky {{!}} Institute for Advanced Study|website=www.ias.edu|access-date=2016-04-20}}</ref> (PhD) \u2013 2002\n#[[Curtis T.

In this list, universities are presented in descending order starting from those affiliated with most Fields Medal winners.\n\nThe university affiliations in this list are all official academic affiliations such as degree programs and official academic employment. Non-academic affiliations such as advisory committee and administrative staff are generally excluded. The official academic affiliations fall into three categories: 1) Alumni (graduates and attendees), 2) Long-term academic Staff, and 3) Short-term academic staff. Graduates are defined as those who hold [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]], [[Master's degree|Master's]], [[Doctorate]] or equivalent degrees from a university, while attendees are those who formally enrolled in degree programs at a university but did not complete the programs; thus, honorary degrees, summer attendees, exchange students and auditing students are excluded. The category of \"Long-term academic staff\" consists of [[Academic tenure|tenure]]/tenure-track and equivalent academic positions, while that of \"Short-term academic staff\" consists of lecturers (without tenure), postdoctoral researchers, visiting professors/scholars (visitors), and equivalent academic positions. At any university, the specific academic title solely determines the type of affiliation, regardless of the actual time the position was held by a medalist.\n\nFurther explanations on \"visitors\" under \"Short-term academic staff\" are now presented. 1) All informal or personal visits are excluded from the list; 2) all employment-based visiting positions, which carry teaching/research duties, are included as affiliations in the list; 3) as for award-based visiting positions, to minimize controversy this list takes a conservative view and includes the positions as affiliations only if the medalists were required to assume employment-level duty (teaching/research) or the medalists specifically classified the visiting positions as \"appointment\" or similar in reliable sources such as  their [[curriculum vitae]]. To be specific, some award-based visiting positions such as the \"[[Shiing-Shen Chern]] Visiting Professorship\" in [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] are awards/honors without employment-level duty;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://math.berkeley.edu/about/events/lectures/chern|title=The Chern Lectures {{!}} Department of Mathematics at University of California Berkeley|website=math.berkeley.edu|access-date=2016-04-22}}</ref> attending meetings and giving public lectures, talks or non-curricular seminars are not employment-level duties. Finally, summer visitors are generally excluded from the list unless summer work yielded significant end products such as research publications and components of Fields-winning work, since summer terms are not part of formal academic years; the same rule applies to extension schools of universities.\n\nThe number following a person's name is the year he/she received the Fields Medal; in particular, a number with asterisk (*) means the person received the award while he/she was working at the institution (including [[emeritus]] staff) containing that asterisk. A name underlined implies that this person has been listed for a same institution previously (i.e., multiple affiliations). If a person had multiple positions under one category, only the position with highest rank is considered.\n\nThis list, together with [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation]] and [[List of Turing Award laureates by university affiliation]], presents the university affiliations of people who have won highest honors in fundamental academic disciplines.\n\n== Summary of results ==\n\n=== Top 15 universities worldwide since 1936 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Rank\n! colspan=\"2\" |University\n!Total\n!Alumni\n!Long-term academic staff\n!Short-term academic staff\n!Overlap<ref group=\"Note\" name=\"Overlap\" />\n|-\n|1\n|[[Harvard University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|18\n|7\n|6\n|10\n| \u22125\n|-\n|2\n|[[University of Paris]]<ref group=\"Note\" name=\"Paris\" />\n|{{flagicon|France}}\n|16\n|11\n|8\n|6\n| \u22129\n|-\n|3\n|[[Princeton University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|15\n|7\n|11\n|3\n| \u22126\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |4\n|[[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]]\n|{{flagicon|France}}\n|14\n|12\n|2\n|2\n| \u22122\n|-\n|[[University of California, Berkeley]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|14\n|3\n|7\n|6\n| \u22122\n|-\n|6\n|[[University of Cambridge]]\n|{{flagicon|United Kingdom}}\n|11\n|8\n|6\n|4\n| \u22127\n|-\n|7\n|[[University of Chicago]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|9\n|2\n|6\n|3\n| \u22122\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |8\n|[[Coll\u00e8ge de France]]\n|{{flagicon|France}}\n|8\n|0\n|4\n|4\n|0\n|-\n|[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|8\n|0\n|4\n|4\n|0\n|-\n|[[Stanford University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|8\n|0\n|6\n|2\n|0\n|-\n|11\n|[[Moscow State University]]\n|{{flagicon|Russia}}\n|6\n|6\n|2\n|0\n| \u22122\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |12\n|[[Columbia University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|5\n|1\n|4\n|2\n| \u22122\n|-\n|[[New York University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|5\n|0\n|2\n|3\n|0\n|-\n|[[Stony Brook University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|5\n|0\n|3\n|2\n|0\n|-\n|[[Yale University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|5\n|1\n|2\n|2\n|0\n|}\n\n=== Top 10 universities worldwide since 2000 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Rank\n! colspan=\"2\" |University\n!Total\n!Alumni\n!Long-term academic staff\n!Short-term academic staff\n!Overlap\n|-\n|1\n|[[Princeton University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|6\n|3\n|4\n|1\n| \u22122\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2\n|[[University of California, Berkeley]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|5\n|0\n|1\n|4\n|0\n|-\n|[[University of Paris]]\n|{{flagicon|France}}\n|5\n|4\n|4\n|2\n| \u22125\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |4\n|[[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]]\n|{{flagicon|France}}\n|4\n|4\n|2\n|0\n| \u22122\n|-\n|[[New York University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|4\n|0\n|2\n|2\n|0\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |6\n|[[Harvard University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|3\n|3\n|0\n|2\n| \u22122\n|-\n|[[Stanford University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|3\n|0\n|3\n|0\n|0\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" |8\n|[[\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon|\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon]]\n|{{flagicon|France}}\n|2\n|1\n|1\n|1\n| \u22121\n|-\n|[[ETH Zurich]]\n|{{flagicon|Switzerland}}\n|2\n|0\n|2\n|1\n| \u22121\n|-\n|[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|2\n|0\n|-\n|[[Moscow State University]]\n|{{flagicon|Russia}}\n|2\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|[[Saint Petersburg State University]]\n|{{flagicon|Russia}}\n|2\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|[[Stony Brook University]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|2\n|0\n|-\n|[[University of Cambridge]]\n|{{flagicon|UK}}\n|2\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|[[University of Chicago]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}}\n|2\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|[[University of Geneva]]\n|{{flagicon|Switzerland}}\n|2\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|}\n\n== Harvard University (1st) ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Affiliates\n!Alumni\n!Long-term academic staff\n!Short-term academic staff\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |[[Harvard University]], [[United States]] {{flagicon|United States}}\n|-\n|18\n|\n#[[Manjul Bhargava]]<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.claymath.org/library/research_award/Bhargava/CV.pdf|title=Clay: Manjul Bhargava|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> (B.A) \u2013 2014\n#[[Maryam Mirzakhani]]<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/people/13092|title=MSRI: Maryam Mirzakhani|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> (PhD) \u2013 2014\n#[[Vladimir Voevodsky]]<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ias.edu/people/faculty-and-emeriti/voevodsky|title=Vladimir Voevodsky {{!}} Institute for Advanced Study|website=www.ias.edu|access-date=2016-04-20}}</ref> (PhD) \u2013 2002\n#[[Curtis T.

When he was in middle school, he met C\u00e9sar Iv\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez, who played guitar and did back up vocals. Camacho later sought to expand his group and found a tuba player, Omar Burgos. His first concert was held in Tijuana, in which he played for more than 40,000 people. He quickly became known for his expressive way of playing the requinto (12 string guitar). He became known as \"La Tuyia\"{{efn-ua|a nickname meaning \"You've made that guitar yours\"<ref name=delrecords />}} due to a childhood nickname given to him by his grandfather because his guitar was much bigger than him. He decided to form a band in the start of 2013. His band \"Ariel Camacho y Los Plebes del Rancho\" consisted of \"El Tigre\", Cesar S\u00e1nchez (rhythm guitar and backing vocals) and Omar Burgos, \"El Cenizo\" (tuba). Camacho was the lead singer and played lead guitar (Requinto) in the band. His band quickly became known due to their unusual combination of standard guitar, requinto, and tuba. Among their most successful songs were \"Hablemos\", \"Te Metiste\", \"El Karma\" and \"Rey de Corazones\". He was later nicknamed \"El Rey de Coraz\u00f3nes\" after releasing \"Rey de Corazones\" a song that quickly made his group known through social media. Camacho was praised for maintaining a classical element in his regional music by paying attention to the songwriters who had come before him such as Miguel y Miguel (Camacho's favorite artists). He was also a frequent collaborator with other [[corrido]] singers, including Grupo Fernandez, Marca Registrada, Los Traviesos De La Sierra and Regulo Caro.<ref name=\"El Debate\"/><ref name=delrecords>{{cite web|title=Ariel Camacho |url=http://delrecords.com/artist/ariel-camacho/ |website=DelRecords |accessdate=16 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015162154/http://delrecords.com/artist/ariel-camacho/ |archivedate=15 October 2016 |quote=His style was so innovative that in the \u00c9vora River valley region, he became known as \"La Tuyia,\" a nickname meaning ''\"You've made that guitar yours.\"'' |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=T4C>{{cite web|title=Ariel Camacho & Los Plebes Del Rancho |url=http://top40-charts.com/artist.php?aid=16304 |website=T4C: Top 40 Charts |accessdate=16 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516035407/http://top40-charts.com/artist.php?aid=16304 |archivedate=2016-05-16 |quote=He had been on tour with his group, whose name roughly translates as \"the ranch's plebeians,\" promoting their album \"El Karma.\" |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn February 25, 2015, \nCamacho and three other people were in a car accident on the road from [[Angostura, Sinaloa]].

When he was in middle school, he met C\u00e9sar Iv\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez, who played guitar and did back up vocals. Camacho later sought to expand his group and found a tuba player, Omar Burgos. His first concert was held in Tijuana, in which he played for more than 40,000 people. He quickly became known for his expressive way of playing the requinto (12 string guitar). He became known as \"La Tuyia\"{{efn-ua|a nickname meaning \"You've made that guitar yours\"<ref name=delrecords />}} due to a childhood nickname given to him by his grandfather because his guitar was much bigger than him. He decided to form a band in the start of 2013. His band \"Ariel Camacho y Los Plebes del Rancho\" consisted of \"El Tigre\", Cesar S\u00e1nchez (rhythm guitar and backing vocals) and Omar Burgos, \"El Cenizo\" (tuba). Camacho was the lead singer and played lead guitar (Requinto) in the band. His band quickly became known due to their unusual combination of standard guitar, requinto, and tuba. Among their most successful songs were \"Hablemos\", \"Te Metiste\", \"El Karma\" and \"Rey de Corazones\". He was later nicknamed \"El Rey de Coraz\u00f3nes\" after releasing \"Rey de Corazones\" a song that quickly made his group known through social media. Camacho was praised for maintaining a classical element in his regional music by paying attention to the songwriters who had come before him such as Miguel y Miguel (Camacho's favorite artists). He was also a frequent collaborator with other [[corrido]] singers, including Grupo Fernandez, Marca Registrada, Los Traviesos De La Sierra and Regulo Caro.<ref name=\"El Debate\"/><ref name=delrecords>{{cite web|title=Ariel Camacho |url=http://delrecords.com/artist/ariel-camacho/ |website=DelRecords |accessdate=16 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015162154/http://delrecords.com/artist/ariel-camacho/ |archivedate=15 October 2016 |quote=His style was so innovative that in the \u00c9vora River valley region, he became known as \"La Tuyia,\" a nickname meaning ''\"You've made that guitar yours.\"'' |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=T4C>{{cite web|title=Ariel Camacho & Los Plebes Del Rancho |url=http://top40-charts.com/artist.php?aid=16304 |website=T4C: Top 40 Charts |accessdate=16 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516035407/http://top40-charts.com/artist.php?aid=16304 |archivedate=2016-05-16 |quote=He had been on tour with his group, whose name roughly translates as \"the ranch's plebeians,\" promoting their album \"El Karma.\" |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn February 25, 2015, \nCamacho and three other people were in a car accident on the road from [[Angostura, Sinaloa]].
