{"title_page": "1917 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "The 1917 [[Auckland Rugby League]] season was its 9th. Due to the large number of players now serving in the [[First World War]] it was agreed to relax transfer rules to allow players from stronger teams to join weaker teams to even the competition.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Prospects for the Season\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIV, Issue 16529\n| date = 1917-05-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19170503.2.96.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-15}}</ref> It was noted how many men from various clubs had been killed in battle by the beginning of 1917. They were Cecil Walker, Doug Dawson, T Marshall ([[Grafton Athletic]]), [[Charles Savory]], T McWhirter, G Cook, N Vause, V McCollum, Alf Gault, T Lambert, E Tiernan, F Stubbs, W. G. Handle ([[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]]), B Hart, F Gladding, A Powley, Chas Mann ([[North Shore Albions]]), [[William Moeki]], G Jones, W Harris, S Magee, S Greer ([[City Rovers]]), A Miller, C Sinton, and L O'Leary (Sunnyside). City Rovers had sent ninety men to war by this time and twenty-one had been wounded and five killed. The Sunnyside club had only nine members left and one of those who had gone to the war (W Shaughnessey) said that in the trenches he had made a list of league players from various clubs which totaled 120. All three of the Sunnyside secretaries had enlisted and the executive was also gone. Ponsonby had also had over eighty of its member join the war effort.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =At the Front/Footballers Distinguish Themselves\n| page =6\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLVIII, Issue 107\n| date = 1917-05-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19170505.2.50\n| accessdate = 2020-01-26}}</ref>\n\nThirty three teams entered the six grades. This was down on previous seasons due to the number of men who had gone to fight. In the senior grade there were still six teams entered, with five second grade teams, five third grade teams, nine fourth grade teams, six fifth grade teams, and four sixth grade teams. The season was notable for the fact that [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] was forced to drop out of the first grade competition after round 4 as it struggled to field senior players. [[Grafton Athletic]] also fell by the way-side soon after for the same reason.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won the first grade championship for the first time in their history. They also won the Roope Rooster trophy for the first time with a 12\u20136 win over [[City Rovers]] in the final. By winning both competitions they became the second Auckland senior club to win multiple trophies in the same [[Auckland Rugby League club trophies|season]] following on the footsteps of [[City Rovers]] who had won both titles the year prior.\n\nAt the season end rather than a strong representative program which had been a feature of earlier years several charity and exhibition matches were played instead. These included a match versus the victorious [[Auckland Rugby Union]] club champions Railway. The team in its entirety switched to the rugby league code. They played matches with [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[City Rovers]] at the end of the season. The team would go on to struggle for numbers itself in 1918 before eventually amalgamating with [[Grafton Athletic]].\n\nIn 1916 the fence around [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]] had been removed by the council which made it very difficult to collect gate revenue. The league had however secured land which would be developed as [[Carlaw Park]] with the aim being to secure the ground and gain revenue from ticket sales in the future.\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=9th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1917}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1918 Auckland Rugby League season|1918]]}}\n        {{end}}\n\n==First Grade Championship==\nTwenty three first grade season matches were played which was less than previous seasons but owing to the fact that both [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] and [[Grafton Athletic]] were forced to drop out of the competition due to a lack of players as a result of so many leaving to join the war effort. After their Round 4 default to North Shore where only two Otahuhu players turned up they decided to amalgamate senior teams with Grafton.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Otahuhu V North Shore\n| page =7 \n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLVIII, Issue 140\n| date = 1917-06-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19170613.2.72.2\n| accessdate = 2020-01-21}}</ref> This was short lived however as Grafton themselves only lasted until Round 7 when they themselves defaulted a week later.

City Rovers had sent ninety men to war by this time and twenty-one had been wounded and five killed. The Sunnyside club had only nine members left and one of those who had gone to the war (W Shaughnessey) said that in the trenches he had made a list of league players from various clubs which totaled 120.

This was down on previous seasons due to the number of men who had gone to fight. In the senior grade there were still six teams entered, with five second grade teams, five third grade teams, nine fourth grade teams, six fifth grade teams, and four sixth grade teams. The season was notable for the fact that [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] was forced to drop out of the first grade competition after round 4 as it struggled to field senior players. [[Grafton Athletic]] also fell by the way-side soon after for the same reason.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won the first grade championship for the first time in their history.

By winning both competitions they became the second Auckland senior club to win multiple trophies in the same [[Auckland Rugby League club trophies|season]] following on the footsteps of [[City Rovers]] who had won both titles the year prior.\n\nAt the season end rather than a strong representative program which had been a feature of earlier years several charity and exhibition matches were played instead. These included a match versus the victorious [[Auckland Rugby Union]] club champions Railway. The team in its entirety switched to the rugby league code. They played matches with [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[City Rovers]] at the end of the season. The team would go on to struggle for numbers itself in 1918 before eventually amalgamating with [[Grafton Athletic]].\n\nIn 1916 the fence around [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]] had been removed by the council which made it very difficult to collect gate revenue.
