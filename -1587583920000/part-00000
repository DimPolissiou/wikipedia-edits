He has won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] twice: one for the drama ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' (1975) and the other for the romantic comedy ''As Good as It Gets'' (1997). He also won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for the comedy-drama ''Terms of Endearment'' (1983).

''The Film Encyclopedia'', HarperCollins (2012) pp. 1079\u20131080</ref> He made his film debut in a low-budget teen drama ''[[The Cry Baby Killer]]'' (1958), playing the title role. For the following decade, Nicholson was a frequent collaborator with the film's producer, [[Roger Corman]]. Corman directed Nicholson on several occasions, most notably in ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]'', as [[sadomasochism|masochistic]] dental patient and undertaker Wilbur Force, and also in ''[[The Raven (1963 film)|The Raven]]'', ''[[The Terror (1963 film)|The Terror]]'' where he plays a French officer seduced by an evil ghost, and ''[[The St. Valentine's Day Massacre (film)|The St. Valentine's Day Massacre]]''.\n\nNicholson also frequently worked with director [[Monte Hellman]] on low-budget westerns, though two in particular, ''[[Ride in the Whirlwind]]'' and ''[[The Shooting]]'', initially failed to find interest from any US film distributors but gained cult success on the art-house circuit in France and were later sold to television. Nicholson also appeared in two episodes of ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''.\n\n===1960s===\nWith his acting career heading nowhere, Nicholson seemed resigned to a career behind the camera as a writer/director. His first real taste of writing success was the [[screenplay]] for the 1967 [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] film ''[[The Trip (1967 film)|The Trip]]'' (directed by Corman), which starred [[Peter Fonda]] and [[Dennis Hopper]]. After first reading the script, Fonda told Nicholson he was totally impressed by the writing and felt it could become a great film. However, Fonda was disappointed with how the film turned out and blamed the editing which turned it into a \"predictable\" film and said so publicly. \"I was livid\", he recalls.<ref name=\"Fonda\">Linderman, Lawrence. \"Playboy Interview with Peter Fonda\", ''Playboy'' magazine, September 1970</ref> Nicholson also co-wrote, with [[Bob Rafelson]], the movie ''[[Head (film)|Head]]'', which starred [[The Monkees]]. He also arranged the movie's [[soundtrack]].\n\nAfter a spot opened up in Fonda and Hopper's ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969), it led to his first big acting break. Nicholson played alcoholic lawyer George Hanson, for which he received his first Oscar nomination. The film cost only $400,000 to make, and became a blockbuster, grossing $40&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Parker\" /> Biographer John Parker states that Nicholson's interpretation of his role placed him in the company of earlier \"[[anti-hero]]\" actors, such as [[James Cagney]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]], while promoting him into an \"overnight number-one hero of the [[counter-culture]] movement\".{{attribution needed|date=September 2016}}<ref name=\"Parker\">Parker, John. ''Michael Douglas: Acting on Instinct'', Hachette Book Group (2011) e-book</ref>\n\nThe part was a lucky break for Nicholson. The role had been written for the actor [[Rip Torn]], who withdrew from the project after an argument with Hopper.<ref>Hill, Lee. ''A Grand Guy: The Life and Art of Terry Southern''. Bloomsbury, 2001.</ref> In interviews, Nicholson later acknowledged the importance of being cast in ''Easy Rider'': \"All I could see in the early films, before ''Easy Rider'', was this desperate young actor trying to vault out of the screen and create a movie career.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/film-cinema/easy-rider-the-Jack-Nicholson-interview-1296590.html|work=Irish Independent|title=Easy rider: The Jack Nicholson interview|date=February 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\nNicholson was cast by [[Stanley Kubrick]], who was impressed with his role in ''Easy Rider'', in the part of [[Napoleon]] in a film about his life, and although production on the film commenced, the project fizzled out, partly due to a change in ownership at MGM, and other issues.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=122}}\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:Jack Nicholson - 1976.jpg|thumb|Nicholson in 1976]]\nNicholson starred in ''[[Five Easy Pieces]]'' alongside [[Karen Black]] in 1970 in what became his persona-defining role. Nicholson and Black were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances. Nicholson played Bobby Dupea, an oil rig worker, and Black was his waitress girlfriend. During an interview about the film, Black noted that Nicholson's character in the film was very subdued, and was very different from Nicholson's real-life personality. She says that the now-famous restaurant scene was partly improvised by Nicholson, and was out of character for Bobby, who wouldn't have cared enough to argue with a waitress.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIXrF34Bz0 \"Hold the Chicken \u2013 Five Easy Pieces\"], fair use video clip</ref> \"I think that Jack really has very little in common with Bobby.

He just looked right at you&nbsp;... I liked him a lot&nbsp;... He really sort of wanted to date me but I didn't think of him that way because I was going with Peter Kastner&nbsp;...

The film co-starred [[Faye Dunaway]] and [[John Huston]], and included a cameo role with Polanski. Roger Ebert described Nicholson's portrayal as sharp-edged, menacing, and aggressive, a character who knew \"how to go over the top\", as he did in ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest''.

At the time of the incident, Nicholson was out of town making a film, but his steady girlfriend, actress [[Anjelica Huston]], had dropped by unannounced to pick up some items. She heard Polanski in the other room say, \"We'll be right out.\"<ref name=\"Huston\" /> Polanski then came out with Geimer, and he introduced her to Huston, and they chatted about Nicholson's two large dogs, which were sitting nearby. Huston recalled Geimer was wearing platform heels and appeared quite tall.<ref name=\"Huston\" /> After a few minutes of talking, Polanski had packed up his camera gear, and Huston saw them drive off in his car. Huston told police the next day, after Polanski was arrested, that she \"had witnessed nothing untoward\" and never saw them together in the other room.<ref name=\"Huston\">Huston, Anjelica. ''Watch Me'', Simon and Schuster (2014) e-book</ref>\n\nGeimer learned afterward that Huston herself wasn't supposed to be at Nicholson's house that day, since they had recently broken up, but stopped over to pick up some belongings. Geimer described Nicholson's house as \"definitely\" a guy's house, with lots of wood and shelves crowded with photos and mementos.<ref>Geimer, Samantha. ''The Girl: A Life in the Shadow of Roman Polanski'', Simon and Schuster (2013) p. 79</ref>\n\nOne of Nicholson's greatest successes came in 1975, with his role as [[Randle Patrick McMurphy|Randle P.

The movie was an adaptation of [[Ken Kesey]]'s novel, and was directed by [[Milo\u0161 Forman]] and co-produced by [[Michael Douglas]]. Nicholson plays an anti-authoritarian patient at a mental hospital where he becomes an inspiring leader for the other patients. Playing one of the patients was [[Danny DeVito]] in an early role. Nicholson learned afterward that DeVito grew up in the same area of New Jersey, and they knew many of the same people.<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-uJ9A5XISk|title=Danny DeVito speaks at the 22nd AFI Life Achievement Award: A Tribute To Jack Nicholson|date=1994}}</ref> The film swept the Academy Awards with nine nominations, and won the top five, including Nicholson's first for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]].\n\nThe role seemed perfect for Nicholson, with biographer Ken Burke noting that his \"smartass demeanor balances his genuine concern for the treatment of his fellow patients with his independent spirit too free to exist in a repressive social structure\".<ref name=\"Burke\">Burke, Ken.

She describes his performance:\n\n{{quote|Nicholson is everywhere; his energy propels the ward of loonies and makes of them an ensemble, a chorus of people caught in a bummer with nowhere else to go, but still fighting for some frail sense of themselves. ... There are scenes in ''Cuckoo's Nest'' that are as intimate\u2014and in their language, twice as rough\u2014as the best moments in ''The Godfather'' ...

Nicholson plays the role of a journalist, David Locke, who during an assignment in North Africa decides to quit being a journalist and simply disappear by taking on a new hidden identity. Unfortunately, the dead person whose identity he takes on turns out to have been a weapons smuggler on the run. Antonioni's unusual plot included convincing dialogue and fine acting, states film critic [[Seymour Chatman]].<ref name=\"Chatman\">Chatman, Seymour; Duncan, Paul.

Again and again, in the movie, we watch him court danger. It interests him to walk the edge of risk. He does it with passivity as if he were taking part in an expressionless game of double-dare with life. Jack Nicholson's performance is a wonder of insight. How to animate a personality that is barely there.<ref name=\"McGilligan\" /> {{rp|443}}}}\n\nHe continued to take more unusual roles. He took a small role in ''[[The Last Tycoon (1976 film)|The Last Tycoon]]'', opposite [[Robert De Niro]]. He took a less sympathetic role in [[Arthur Penn]]'s western ''[[The Missouri Breaks]]'' (1976), specifically to work with [[Marlon Brando]]. Nicholson was especially inspired by Brando's acting ability, recalling that in his youth, as an assistant manager at a theater, he watched ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' about forty times.<ref>Wild, David. \"Rolling Stone Interview with Jack Nicholson\", ''Rolling Stone'', May 3, 2007, p. 110</ref> \"I'm part of the first generation that idolized Marlon Brando\", he said.<ref>Nicholson, Jack. \"Remembering Marlon\", ''Rolling Stone'', August 19, 2004</ref>\n\n{{quote|Marlon Brando influenced me strongly.

''Nicholson: A Biography'', Random House (2013) Title page</ref>}}\n\nNicholson has observed that while both De Niro and Brando were noted for their skill as [[method actor]]s, he himself has seldom been described as a method actor, a fact which he sees as an accomplishment: \"I'm still fooling them\", he told [[Sean Penn]] during a phone conversation. \"I consider it an accomplishment because there's probably no one who understands Method acting better academically than I do\u2014or actually uses it more in his work.

He was Kubrick's first choice to play the lead role, although the book's author, [[Stephen King]], wanted the part played by more of an \"everyman\".

''The Film Encyclopedia'', HarperCollins (2012) pp. 1079\u20131080</ref> He made his film debut in a low-budget teen drama ''[[The Cry Baby Killer]]'' (1958), playing the title role. For the following decade, Nicholson was a frequent collaborator with the film's producer, [[Roger Corman]]. Corman directed Nicholson on several occasions, most notably in ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]'', as [[sadomasochism|masochistic]] dental patient and undertaker Wilbur Force, and also in ''[[The Raven (1963 film)|The Raven]]'', ''[[The Terror (1963 film)|The Terror]]'' where he plays a French officer seduced by an evil ghost, and ''[[The St. Valentine's Day Massacre (film)|The St. Valentine's Day Massacre]]''.\n\nNicholson also frequently worked with director [[Monte Hellman]] on low-budget westerns, though two in particular, ''[[Ride in the Whirlwind]]'' and ''[[The Shooting]]'', initially failed to find interest from any US film distributors but gained cult success on the art-house circuit in France and were later sold to television. Nicholson also appeared in two episodes of ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''.\n\n===1960s===\nWith his acting career heading nowhere, Nicholson seemed resigned to a career behind the camera as a writer/director. His first real taste of writing success was the [[screenplay]] for the 1967 [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] film ''[[The Trip (1967 film)|The Trip]]'' (directed by Corman), which starred [[Peter Fonda]] and [[Dennis Hopper]]. After first reading the script, Fonda told Nicholson he was totally impressed by the writing and felt it could become a great film. However, Fonda was disappointed with how the film turned out and blamed the editing which turned it into a \"predictable\" film and said so publicly. \"I was livid\", he recalls.<ref name=\"Fonda\">Linderman, Lawrence. \"Playboy Interview with Peter Fonda\", ''Playboy'' magazine, September 1970</ref> Nicholson also co-wrote, with [[Bob Rafelson]], the movie ''[[Head (film)|Head]]'', which starred [[The Monkees]]. He also arranged the movie's [[soundtrack]].\n\nAfter a spot opened up in Fonda and Hopper's ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969), it led to his first big acting break. Nicholson played alcoholic lawyer George Hanson, for which he received his first Oscar nomination. The film cost only $400,000 to make, and became a blockbuster, grossing $40&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Parker\" /> Biographer John Parker states that Nicholson's interpretation of his role placed him in the company of earlier \"[[anti-hero]]\" actors, such as [[James Cagney]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]], while promoting him into an \"overnight number-one hero of the [[counter-culture]] movement\".{{attribution needed|date=September 2016}}<ref name=\"Parker\">Parker, John.

During an interview about the film, Black noted that Nicholson's character in the film was very subdued, and was very different from Nicholson's real-life personality.

The film co-starred [[Faye Dunaway]] and [[John Huston]], and included a cameo role with Polanski. Roger Ebert described Nicholson's portrayal as sharp-edged, menacing, and aggressive, a character who knew \"how to go over the top\", as he did in ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest''. It is that edge that kept ''Chinatown'' from becoming a typical genre crime film.<ref>Ebert, Roger. ''The Great Movies, Volume 1'', Broadway Books (2002) p. 106</ref> Ebert also notes the importance of the role for Nicholson's career, seeing it as a major transition from the exploitation films of the previous decade. \"As Jake Gittes, he stepped into [[Bogart]]'s shoes\", says Ebert. \"As a man attractive to audiences because he suggests both comfort and danger&nbsp;...

At the time of the incident, Nicholson was out of town making a film, but his steady girlfriend, actress [[Anjelica Huston]], had dropped by unannounced to pick up some items. She heard Polanski in the other room say, \"We'll be right out.\"<ref name=\"Huston\" /> Polanski then came out with Geimer, and he introduced her to Huston, and they chatted about Nicholson's two large dogs, which were sitting nearby. Huston recalled Geimer was wearing platform heels and appeared quite tall.<ref name=\"Huston\" /> After a few minutes of talking, Polanski had packed up his camera gear, and Huston saw them drive off in his car.

The movie was an adaptation of [[Ken Kesey]]'s novel, and was directed by [[Milo\u0161 Forman]] and co-produced by [[Michael Douglas]]. Nicholson plays an anti-authoritarian patient at a mental hospital where he becomes an inspiring leader for the other patients. Playing one of the patients was [[Danny DeVito]] in an early role.

Nicholson plays the role of a journalist, David Locke, who during an assignment in North Africa decides to quit being a journalist and simply disappear by taking on a new hidden identity.

He took a small role in ''[[The Last Tycoon (1976 film)|The Last Tycoon]]'', opposite [[Robert De Niro]]. He took a less sympathetic role in [[Arthur Penn]]'s western ''[[The Missouri Breaks]]'' (1976), specifically to work with [[Marlon Brando]]. Nicholson was especially inspired by Brando's acting ability, recalling that in his youth, as an assistant manager at a theater, he watched ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' about forty times.<ref>Wild, David. \"Rolling Stone Interview with Jack Nicholson\", ''Rolling Stone'', May 3, 2007, p. 110</ref> \"I'm part of the first generation that idolized Marlon Brando\", he said.<ref>Nicholson, Jack. \"Remembering Marlon\", ''Rolling Stone'', August 19, 2004</ref>\n\n{{quote|Marlon Brando influenced me strongly.

In the Yin Ruins of the Shang Dynasty (1600 to 1050 BC) in Anyang, Dushan Jade ornaments were unearthed in the tomb of the Shang kings.\n\nJade was used to create many utilitarian and ceremonial objects,  from indoor decorative items to [[jade burial suit]]s. Jade was considered the \"imperial gem\". From the earliest [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Chinese dynasties]] to the present, the jade deposits most in use were not only those of [[Khotan]] in the Western Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]] but other parts of China as well, such as Lantian, [[Shaanxi]]. There, white and greenish nephrite jade is found in small quarries and as pebbles and boulders in the [[river]]s flowing from the [[Kuen-Lun mountain range]] eastward into the [[Takla-Makan desert]] area. The river jade collection is concentrated in the [[Yarkand River|Yarkand]], the White Jade ([[Yurungkash River|Yurungkash]]) and Black Jade ([[Karakash River|Karakash]]) Rivers. From the [[Kingdom of Khotan]], on the southern leg of the [[Silk Road]], yearly tribute payments consisting of the most precious white jade were made to the Chinese Imperial court and there worked into ''objects d'art'' by skilled artisans as jade had a status-value exceeding that of [[gold]] or [[silver]]. Jade became a favourite material for the crafting of Chinese scholars' objects, such as rests for calligraphy brushes, as well as the mouthpieces of some [[opium pipe]]s, due to the belief that breathing through jade would bestow longevity upon smokers who used such a pipe.<ref>Martin, Steven. ''The Art of Opium Antiques''. Silkworm Books, Chiang Mai, 2007</ref>\n\nJadeite, with its bright emerald-green, pink, lavender, [[Orange (colour)|orange]] and brown colours was imported from [[Myanmar|Burma]] to China only after about 1800. The vivid green variety became known as Feicui (\u7fe1\u7fe0) or Kingfisher (feathers) Jade. It quickly became almost as popular as nephrite and a favorite of Qing Dynasty's nouveau riche, while scholars still had strong attachment to nephrite (white jade, or Khotan), which they deemed to be the symbol of a nobleman.\n\nIn the history of the art of the Chinese empire, jade has had a special significance, comparable with that of gold and [[diamond]]s in the West.<ref name=gem>[http://www.gemstone.org/gem-by-gem/english/jade.html Jade]. Gemstone.org</ref> Jade was used for the finest objects and cult figures, and for grave furnishings for high-ranking members of the imperial family.<ref name=gem/> Due to that significance and the rising middle class in China, in 2010 the finest jade when found in nuggets of \"mutton fat\" jade \u2013 so-named for its marbled white consistency \u2013 could sell for $3,000 an ounce, a tenfold increase from a decade previously.<ref name=\"Andrew Jabobs\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/world/asia/21jade.html?_r=2&hp& |title=Jade From China's West Surpasses Gold in Value |first=Andrew |last=Jacobs |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 20, 2010 |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=October 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Chinese character \u7389<ref>[[:zh:\u7389]]</ref> (y\u00f9) is used to denote the several types of stone known in English as \"jade\" (e.g. \u7389\u5668, jadewares), such as [[jadeite]] (\u786c\u7389, 'hard jade', another name for \u7fe1\u7fe0) and [[nephrite]] (\u8edf\u7389, 'soft jade').

Jade is found in small numbers of [[pit-house]]s and [[burials]]. The craft production of small [[comma]]-shaped and tubular \"jades\" using materials such as jade, [[microcline]], [[jasper]], etc., in southern Korea originates from the Middle [[Mumun Pottery Period]] (c. 850\u2013550 BC).<ref>Bale, Martin T. and Ko, Min-jung.

''Asian Perspectives'' 45(2):159\u2013187, 2006.</ref> Comma-shaped jades are found on some of the gold crowns of [[Silla]] royalty (c.  300/400\u2013668 AD) and sumptuous [[elite]] burials of the [[Korean Three Kingdoms]]. After the state of Silla united the Korean Peninsula in 668, the widespread popularisation of death rituals related to [[Buddhism]] resulted in the decline of the use of jade in burials as prestige mortuary goods.\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n{{See also|Lingling-o}}\nToday, it is estimated that [[Myanmar]] is the origin of upwards of 70% of the world's supply of high-quality jadeite. Most of the jadeite mined in Myanmar is not cut for use in Myanmar, instead being transported to other nations, primarily in Asia, for use in jewelry and other products. The jadeite deposits found in Kachinland, in Myanmar's northern regions is the highest quality jadeite in the world, considered precious by sources in China going as far back as the 10th century.\n\n[[File:Bicephalous pendant (Jade), Artefacts of Phu Hoa site(Dong Nai province) 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture|Sa Hu\u1ef3nh]] [[white jade]] ''[[lingling-o]]'' double-headed pendant from [[Vietnam]]]]\nJadeite in Myanmar is primarily found in the \"Jade Tract\" located in Lonkin Township in Kachin State in northern Myanmar which encompasses the alluvial region of the Uyu River between the 25th and 26th parallels. Present-day extraction of jade in this region occurs at the Phakant-gyi, Maw Se Za, Tin Tin, and Khansee mines. Khansee is also the only mine that produces Maw Sit Sit, a type of jade. Mines at Tawmao and Hweka are mostly exhausted. From to 1964 to 1981, mining was exclusively an enterprise of the Myanmar government. In 1981, 1985, and 1995, the Gemstone laws were modified to allow increasing private enterprise. In addition to this region, there are also notable mines in the neighboring Sagaing District, near the towns of Nasibon and Natmaw and Hkamti. Sagaing is a district in Myanmar proper, not a part of the ethic Kachin State.\n\nArchaeologists have discovered two forms of jade that can be found across Taiwan through the Philippines, East Malaysia, central and southern Vietnam, and even extending to eastern Cambodia and peninsular Thailand. These two forms are called [[lingling-o]] penannular earring with three pointed circumferential projections and the double animal-headed ear pendant. The forms are very similar in size and range from about 30\u201335&nbsp;mm in diameter. Furthermore, radiocarbon dates have dated these forms in Southeast Asia from around 500 BC to 500 AD.<ref name=\"Hung et al\">Hung, H. C.; Iizuka, Y.; Bellwood, P.; Nguyen, K.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104(50), 19745\u201319750.</ref> Electron probe microanalysis shows that the raw material of these two types of artifacts was nephrite jade from Taiwan called Fengtian nephrite. Evidence recovered from multiple sites from Taiwan, the Philippines, and the mainland southeast Asia suggests that Taiwan was the main source of the exchange of this kind of jade. During the Iron Age of Southeast Asia, there may have been skilled craftsmen traveling from Taiwan to southeast Asia along the coastline of the South China Sea, making jade ornaments for local inhabitants.<ref name=\"Hung et al\"/>\n\n===M\u0101ori===\n{{main|Pounamu}}\n[[File:Ear pendant (peka peka), Maori people, Honolulu Museum of Art, 3351.JPG|thumb|[[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] [[Pounamu|greenstone]] double-headed pendant (''[[pekapeka]]'') from [[New Zealand]]]]\n[[File:Pounamu 3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] ''[[hei matau]]'' jade pendant]]\nNephrite jade in [[New Zealand]] is known as ''[[pounamu]]'' in the [[M\u0101ori language]] (often called \"greenstone\" in [[New Zealand English]]), and plays an important role in [[Culture of the M\u0101ori|M\u0101ori culture]]. It is considered a ''[[taonga]]'', or treasure, and therefore protected under the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], and the exploitation of it is restricted and closely monitored.

Jade is exposed using diamond-tipped core drills in order to extract samples. This is done to ensure that the jade meets requirements. Hydraulic spreaders are then inserted into cleavage points in the rock so that the jade can be broken away. Once the boulders are removed and the jade is accessible, it is broken down into more manageable 10-tonne pieces using water-cooled diamond saws.

This, the more precious kind of jade is a microcrystalline interlocking growth of crystals (not a fibrous matrix as Nephrite is.)\n\nBoth nephrite and jadeite were used from [[prehistoric]] periods for [[hardstone carving]]. Jadeite has about the same [[Hardness (materials science)|hardness]] (between 6.0 and 7.0 [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness]]) as quartz, while nephrite is slightly softer (6.0 to 6.5) and so can be worked with quartz or garnet sand, and polished with bamboo or even ground jade.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} However nephrite is tougher and more resistant to breakage.

Burma ([[Myanmar]]) and Guatemala are the principal sources of modern gem jadeite. In the area of [[Mogaung]] in the [[Myitkyina]] District of Upper Burma, jadeite formed a layer in the dark-green serpentine, and has been quarried and exported for well over a hundred years.<ref name=Hunter>Hunter, Sir William Wilson and [[Richard Burn (Indologist)|Sir Richard Burn]]. ''The Imperial Gazetteer of India'', Vol. 3. Oxford, England: Clarendon Press, Henry Frowde Publishers (1907), p. 242</ref>  Canada provides the major share of modern lapidary nephrite.  Nephrite jade was used mostly in pre-1800 [[China]] as well as in [[New Zealand]], the Pacific Coast and the Atlantic Coast of North America, Neolithic Europe, and Southeast Asia.  In addition to Mesoamerica, jadeite was used by Neolithic Japanese and European cultures.\n\n===Enhancement===\nJade may be enhanced (sometimes called \"stabilized\"). Some merchants will refer to these as grades, but degree of enhancement is different from colour and texture quality. In other words, Type A jadeite is not enhanced but can have poor colour and texture. There are three main methods of enhancement, sometimes referred to as the ABC Treatment System:<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ssef-alumni.org/pdf/newsletter_3.pdf |author=Tay Thye Sun |title=The Changing Face of Jade |journal=Alumni Newsletter |issue= 3 |pages= 5\u20136 |publisher=Swiss Gemmological Institute |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215222620/http://www.ssef-alumni.org/pdf/newsletter_3.pdf |archive-date=15 December 2018 |url-status=dead |access-date=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n*'''Type A''' jadeite has not been treated in any way except surface waxing.\n*'''Type B''' treatment involves exposing a promising but stained piece of jadeite to chemical bleaches and/or acids and impregnating it with a clear [[polymer]] [[resin]]. This results in a significant improvement of transparency and colour of the material. Currently, [[infrared spectroscopy]] is the most accurate test for the detection of polymer in jadeite.\n*'''Type C''' jade has been artificially stained or dyed. The effects are somewhat uncontrollable and may result in a dull brown. In any case, translucency is usually lost.\n*'''B+C jade''' is a combination of B and C: it has been both impregnated and artificially stained.\n*'''Type D''' jade refers to a composite stone such as a doublet comprising a jade top with a plastic backing.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cheonmachong]] \u2013 Tumulus of the Silla kingdom in Korea, containing jade artifacts\n*{{annotated link|Costa Rican jade tradition}}\n*{{annotated link|Jade burial suit}}\n*{{annotated link|Jade trade in Myanmar}}\n*[[Mumun pottery period]] \u2013 Time in Korea when jade ornament production began\n*{{annotated link|Nephrite}}\n*{{annotated link|Philippine jade artifacts}}\n*[[Pounamu]] \u2013 Type of hard stone found in New Zealand, some of which are nephrite\n*[[Serpentine subgroup]] \u2013 Group of minerals, some of which are known as false jade\n*Name of 35th [[wedding anniversary]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n* R\u00e9musat, Abel, 1820.

In the Yin Ruins of the Shang Dynasty (1600 to 1050 BC) in Anyang, Dushan Jade ornaments were unearthed in the tomb of the Shang kings.\n\nJade was used to create many utilitarian and ceremonial objects,  from indoor decorative items to [[jade burial suit]]s. Jade was considered the \"imperial gem\". From the earliest [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Chinese dynasties]] to the present, the jade deposits most in use were not only those of [[Khotan]] in the Western Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]] but other parts of China as well, such as Lantian, [[Shaanxi]]. There, white and greenish nephrite jade is found in small quarries and as pebbles and boulders in the [[river]]s flowing from the [[Kuen-Lun mountain range]] eastward into the [[Takla-Makan desert]] area. The river jade collection is concentrated in the [[Yarkand River|Yarkand]], the White Jade ([[Yurungkash River|Yurungkash]]) and Black Jade ([[Karakash River|Karakash]]) Rivers. From the [[Kingdom of Khotan]], on the southern leg of the [[Silk Road]], yearly tribute payments consisting of the most precious white jade were made to the Chinese Imperial court and there worked into ''objects d'art'' by skilled artisans as jade had a status-value exceeding that of [[gold]] or [[silver]]. Jade became a favourite material for the crafting of Chinese scholars' objects, such as rests for calligraphy brushes, as well as the mouthpieces of some [[opium pipe]]s, due to the belief that breathing through jade would bestow longevity upon smokers who used such a pipe.<ref>Martin, Steven. ''The Art of Opium Antiques''. Silkworm Books, Chiang Mai, 2007</ref>\n\nJadeite, with its bright emerald-green, pink, lavender, [[Orange (colour)|orange]] and brown colours was imported from [[Myanmar|Burma]] to China only after about 1800. The vivid green variety became known as Feicui (\u7fe1\u7fe0) or Kingfisher (feathers) Jade. It quickly became almost as popular as nephrite and a favorite of Qing Dynasty's nouveau riche, while scholars still had strong attachment to nephrite (white jade, or Khotan), which they deemed to be the symbol of a nobleman.\n\nIn the history of the art of the Chinese empire, jade has had a special significance, comparable with that of gold and [[diamond]]s in the West.<ref name=gem>[http://www.gemstone.org/gem-by-gem/english/jade.html Jade].

Jade is found in small numbers of [[pit-house]]s and [[burials]]. The craft production of small [[comma]]-shaped and tubular \"jades\" using materials such as jade, [[microcline]], [[jasper]], etc., in southern Korea originates from the Middle [[Mumun Pottery Period]] (c. 850\u2013550 BC).<ref>Bale, Martin T. and Ko, Min-jung.

After the state of Silla united the Korean Peninsula in 668, the widespread popularisation of death rituals related to [[Buddhism]] resulted in the decline of the use of jade in burials as prestige mortuary goods.\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n{{See also|Lingling-o}}\nToday, it is estimated that [[Myanmar]] is the origin of upwards of 70% of the world's supply of high-quality jadeite. Most of the jadeite mined in Myanmar is not cut for use in Myanmar, instead being transported to other nations, primarily in Asia, for use in jewelry and other products. The jadeite deposits found in Kachinland, in Myanmar's northern regions is the highest quality jadeite in the world, considered precious by sources in China going as far back as the 10th century.\n\n[[File:Bicephalous pendant (Jade), Artefacts of Phu Hoa site(Dong Nai province) 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture|Sa Hu\u1ef3nh]] [[white jade]] ''[[lingling-o]]'' double-headed pendant from [[Vietnam]]]]\nJadeite in Myanmar is primarily found in the \"Jade Tract\" located in Lonkin Township in Kachin State in northern Myanmar which encompasses the alluvial region of the Uyu River between the 25th and 26th parallels. Present-day extraction of jade in this region occurs at the Phakant-gyi, Maw Se Za, Tin Tin, and Khansee mines. Khansee is also the only mine that produces Maw Sit Sit, a type of jade. Mines at Tawmao and Hweka are mostly exhausted. From to 1964 to 1981, mining was exclusively an enterprise of the Myanmar government. In 1981, 1985, and 1995, the Gemstone laws were modified to allow increasing private enterprise. In addition to this region, there are also notable mines in the neighboring Sagaing District, near the towns of Nasibon and Natmaw and Hkamti. Sagaing is a district in Myanmar proper, not a part of the ethic Kachin State.\n\nArchaeologists have discovered two forms of jade that can be found across Taiwan through the Philippines, East Malaysia, central and southern Vietnam, and even extending to eastern Cambodia and peninsular Thailand. These two forms are called [[lingling-o]] penannular earring with three pointed circumferential projections and the double animal-headed ear pendant. The forms are very similar in size and range from about 30\u201335&nbsp;mm in diameter. Furthermore, radiocarbon dates have dated these forms in Southeast Asia from around 500 BC to 500 AD.<ref name=\"Hung et al\">Hung, H. C.; Iizuka, Y.; Bellwood, P.; Nguyen, K.

Evidence recovered from multiple sites from Taiwan, the Philippines, and the mainland southeast Asia suggests that Taiwan was the main source of the exchange of this kind of jade.

Once the boulders are removed and the jade is accessible, it is broken down into more manageable 10-tonne pieces using water-cooled diamond saws.

Jadeite has about the same [[Hardness (materials science)|hardness]] (between 6.0 and 7.0 [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness]]) as quartz, while nephrite is slightly softer (6.0 to 6.5) and so can be worked with quartz or garnet sand, and polished with bamboo or even ground jade.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} However nephrite is tougher and more resistant to breakage. Among the earliest known jade artifacts excavated from prehistoric sites are simple ornaments with bead, button, and tubular shapes.<ref>Liu, Li. \"The Products of Minds as Well as Hands: Production of Prestige Goods in Neolithic and Early State Periods of China\". ''Asian Perspectives'' 42(1):1\u201340, 2003, p. 2.</ref> Additionally, jade was used for [[adze]] heads, [[knives]], and other [[weapon]]s, which can be delicately shaped.\n\nAs metal-working technologies became available, the beauty of jade made it valuable for ornaments and decorative objects.\n\n===Unusual varieties===\n[[File:MandalayJadeInspection.jpg|thumb|Jade rock inspection with a portable UV LED torch in [[Mandalay]] Jade Market.]]\nNephrite can be found in a creamy white form (known in China as \"mutton fat\" jade) as well as in a variety of light green colours, whereas jadeite shows more colour variations, including blue, brown, red, black, dark green, lavender and white.<ref name=\"jadeite\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RnE9Fa4pbn0C&lpg=PA216&dq=jadeite%20%20color&pg=PA216#v=onepage&q=jadeite%20%20color&f=false|title=Gems and Gemstones: Timeless Natural Beauty of the Mineral World|last=Grande|first=Lance|last2=Augustyn|first2=Allison|page=216|isbn=978-0-226-30511-0|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2009}}</ref>  Of the two, jadeite is rarer, documented in fewer than 12 places worldwide.  Translucent emerald-green jadeite is the most prized variety, both historically and today.  As \"quetzal\" jade, bright green jadeite from [[Guatemala]] was treasured by [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures, and as \"kingfisher\" jade, vivid green rocks from Burma became the preferred stone of post-1800 Chinese imperial scholars and rulers. Burma ([[Myanmar]]) and Guatemala are the principal sources of modern gem jadeite. In the area of [[Mogaung]] in the [[Myitkyina]] District of Upper Burma, jadeite formed a layer in the dark-green serpentine, and has been quarried and exported for well over a hundred years.<ref name=Hunter>Hunter, Sir William Wilson and [[Richard Burn (Indologist)|Sir Richard Burn]]. ''The Imperial Gazetteer of India'', Vol. 3. Oxford, England: Clarendon Press, Henry Frowde Publishers (1907), p. 242</ref>  Canada provides the major share of modern lapidary nephrite.  Nephrite jade was used mostly in pre-1800 [[China]] as well as in [[New Zealand]], the Pacific Coast and the Atlantic Coast of North America, Neolithic Europe, and Southeast Asia.  In addition to Mesoamerica, jadeite was used by Neolithic Japanese and European cultures.\n\n===Enhancement===\nJade may be enhanced (sometimes called \"stabilized\"). Some merchants will refer to these as grades, but degree of enhancement is different from colour and texture quality. In other words, Type A jadeite is not enhanced but can have poor colour and texture. There are three main methods of enhancement, sometimes referred to as the ABC Treatment System:<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ssef-alumni.org/pdf/newsletter_3.pdf |author=Tay Thye Sun |title=The Changing Face of Jade |journal=Alumni Newsletter |issue= 3 |pages= 5\u20136 |publisher=Swiss Gemmological Institute |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215222620/http://www.ssef-alumni.org/pdf/newsletter_3.pdf |archive-date=15 December 2018 |url-status=dead |access-date=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n*'''Type A''' jadeite has not been treated in any way except surface waxing.\n*'''Type B''' treatment involves exposing a promising but stained piece of jadeite to chemical bleaches and/or acids and impregnating it with a clear [[polymer]] [[resin]]. This results in a significant improvement of transparency and colour of the material. Currently, [[infrared spectroscopy]] is the most accurate test for the detection of polymer in jadeite.\n*'''Type C''' jade has been artificially stained or dyed. The effects are somewhat uncontrollable and may result in a dull brown. In any case, translucency is usually lost.\n*'''B+C jade''' is a combination of B and C: it has been both impregnated and artificially stained.\n*'''Type D''' jade refers to a composite stone such as a doublet comprising a jade top with a plastic backing.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cheonmachong]] \u2013 Tumulus of the Silla kingdom in Korea, containing jade artifacts\n*{{annotated link|Costa Rican jade tradition}}\n*{{annotated link|Jade burial suit}}\n*{{annotated link|Jade trade in Myanmar}}\n*[[Mumun pottery period]] \u2013 Time in Korea when jade ornament production began\n*{{annotated link|Nephrite}}\n*{{annotated link|Philippine jade artifacts}}\n*[[Pounamu]] \u2013 Type of hard stone found in New Zealand, some of which are nephrite\n*[[Serpentine subgroup]] \u2013 Group of minerals, some of which are known as false jade\n*Name of 35th [[wedding anniversary]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n* R\u00e9musat, Abel, 1820.

[[tyrosine kinases]] whose function is to transduce [[cytokine]]-mediated signals via the [[JAK-STAT pathway]]. There are four JAK subtypes, each of which has overlapping receptor responsibilities. Inhibitors of this enzyme family ([[jakinib]]s) have shown efficacy in treating certain inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[Crohn's disease]]. However, the first generation of these drugs, [[tofacitinib]] and [[ruxolitinib]], lacked subtype selectivity, affecting JAK1/JAK3 and JAK1/JAK2 respectively.

[[tyrosine kinases]] whose function is to transduce [[cytokine]]-mediated signals via the [[JAK-STAT pathway]]. There are four JAK subtypes, each of which has overlapping receptor responsibilities. Inhibitors of this enzyme family ([[jakinib]]s) have shown efficacy in treating certain inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[Crohn's disease]]. However, the first generation of these drugs, [[tofacitinib]] and [[ruxolitinib]], lacked subtype selectivity, affecting JAK1/JAK3 and JAK1/JAK2 respectively.

[[Wave drag]] occurs either when a solid object is moving through a gas at or near the [[speed of sound]] or when a solid object is moving along a fluid boundary, as in [[ocean surface wave|surface waves]].\n\n[[File:Drag coefficient on a sphere vs. Reynolds number - main trends.svg|right|thumb|Drag coefficient ''C''<sub>d</sub> for a sphere as a function of [[Reynolds number]] ''Re'', as obtained from laboratory experiments.

The graph to the right shows how <math>C_D</math> varies with <math>R_e</math> for the case of a sphere. Since the power needed to overcome the drag force is the product of the force times speed, the power needed to overcome drag will vary as the square of the speed at low Reynolds numbers and as the cube of the speed at high numbers.\n\nIt can be demonstrated that drag force can be expressed as a function of a dimensionless number, which is dimensionally identical to the Bejan number.<ref name=Liversage2018>Liversage, P., and Trancossi, M.

Terminal velocity for very small objects (pollen, etc.) at low Reynolds numbers is determined by Stokes law.\n\nTerminal velocity is higher for larger creatures, and thus potentially more deadly.  A creature such as a mouse falling at its terminal velocity is much more likely to survive impact with the ground than a human falling at its terminal velocity.  A small animal such as a [[cricket (insect)|cricket]] impacting at its terminal velocity will probably be unharmed. This, combined with the relative ratio of limb cross-sectional area vs. body mass (commonly referred to as the [[Square-cube law]]), explains why very small animals can fall from a large height and not be harmed.<ref>Haldane, J.B.S., [http://irl.cs.ucla.edu/papers/right-size.html \"On Being the Right Size\"]</ref>\n\n== Very low Reynolds numbers: Stokes' drag ==\n[[File:Inclinedthrow.gif|thumb|400px|[[Trajectory|Trajectories]] of three objects thrown at the same angle (70\u00b0).

Using 10<sup>\u22123</sup> Pa\u00b7s as the [[dynamic viscosity]] of water in SI units,\nwe find a drag force of 0.09 pN. This is about the drag force that a bacterium experiences as it swims through water.\n\n==Aerodynamics==\nIn [[aerodynamics]], '''aerodynamic drag''' is the fluid drag force that acts on any moving solid body in the direction of the fluid [[freestream]] flow.<ref>Anderson, John D. Jr., ''Introduction to Flight''</ref> From the body's perspective (near-field approach), the drag results from forces due to pressure distributions over the body surface, symbolized <math>D_{pr}</math>, and forces due to skin friction, which is a result of viscosity, denoted <math>D_{f}</math>. Alternatively, calculated from the flowfield perspective (far-field approach), the drag force results from three natural phenomena: [[shock wave]]s, vortex sheet, and [[viscosity]].\n\n===Overview===\nThe [[pressure]] distribution acting on a body's surface exerts normal forces on the body. Those forces can be summed and the component of that force that acts downstream represents the drag force, <math>D_{pr}</math>, due to pressure distribution acting on the body. The nature of these normal forces combines shock wave effects, vortex system generation effects, and wake viscous mechanisms.\n\nThe [[viscosity]] of the fluid has a major effect on drag. In the absence of viscosity, the pressure forces acting to retard the vehicle are canceled by a pressure force further aft that acts to push the vehicle forward; this is called pressure recovery and the result is that the drag is zero. That is to say, the work the body does on the airflow, is reversible and is recovered as there are no frictional effects to convert the flow energy into heat. Pressure recovery acts even in the case of viscous flow. Viscosity, however results in pressure drag and it is the dominant component of drag in the case of vehicles with regions of separated flow, in which the pressure recovery is fairly ineffective.\n\nThe friction drag force, which is a tangential force on the aircraft surface, depends substantially on [[boundary layer]] configuration and viscosity. The net friction drag, <math>D_f</math>, is calculated as the downstream projection of the viscous forces evaluated over the body's surface.\n\nThe sum of friction drag and pressure (form) drag is called viscous drag. This drag component is due to viscosity. In a thermodynamic perspective, viscous effects represent irreversible phenomena and, therefore, they create entropy. The calculated viscous drag <math>D_v</math> use entropy changes to accurately predict the drag force.\n\nWhen the airplane produces lift, another drag component results. [[Lift-induced drag|Induced drag]], symbolized <math>D_i</math>, is due to a modification of the pressure distribution due to the trailing vortex system that accompanies the lift production. An alternative perspective on lift and drag is gained from considering the change of momentum of the airflow.  The wing intercepts the airflow and forces the flow to move downward. This results in an equal and opposite force acting upward on the wing which is the lift force. The change of momentum of the airflow downward results in a reduction of the rearward momentum of the flow which is the result of a force acting forward on the airflow and applied by the wing to the air flow; an equal but opposite force acts on the wing rearward which is the induced drag. Induced drag tends to be the most important component for airplanes during take-off or landing flight. Another drag component, namely [[wave drag]], <math>D_w</math>, results from shock waves in transonic and supersonic flight speeds. The shock waves induce changes in the boundary layer and pressure distribution over the body surface.\n\n===History===\nThe idea that a moving body passing through air or another fluid encounters resistance had been known since the time of [[Aristotle]]. [[Louis Charles Breguet]]'s paper of 1922 began efforts to reduce drag by streamlining.<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite book\n|title=''A History of Aerodynamics: And Its Impact On Flying Machines''\n|first=John David\n|last=Anderson\n|publisher=University of Cambridge\n|year=1929\n}}</ref> Breguet went on to put his ideas into practice by designing several record-breaking aircraft in the 1920s and 1930s. [[Ludwig Prandtl]]'s boundary layer theory in the 1920s provided the impetus to minimise skin friction. A further major call for streamlining was made by Sir [[Melvill Jones]] who provided the theoretical concepts to demonstrate emphatically the importance of streamlining in [[aircraft]] design.<ref name=\"Cambridge\">{{cite web\n|title=University of Cambridge Engineering Department\n|url=http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/125/1925-1950/melvill2.html\n|accessdate=28 Jan 2014\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Biography\">{{cite book\n|title=''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' ''Bennett Melvill Jones. 28 January 1887 -- 31 October 1975''\n|volume=Vol. 23\n|pages=252\u2013282\n|first=Sir Arnold Hall\n|last=Sir Morien Morgan\n|publisher=The Royal Society\n|date=November 1977\n}}</ref><ref name=\"ODNB\">{{cite book\n|title=''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''\n|first=W.A.\n|last=Mair\n|year=1976\n}}</ref> \nIn 1929 his paper \u2018The Streamline Airplane\u2019 presented to the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] was seminal. He proposed an ideal aircraft that would have minimal drag which led to the concepts of a 'clean' monoplane and retractable [[Landing gear|undercarriage]]. The aspect of Jones's paper that most shocked the designers of the time was his plot of the horse power required versus velocity, for an actual and an ideal plane. By looking at a data point for a given aircraft and extrapolating it horizontally to the ideal curve, the velocity gain for the same power can be seen. When Jones finished his presentation, a member of the audience described the results as being of the same level of importance as the [[Carnot cycle]] in thermodynamics.<ref name=\"Anderson\"/><ref name=\"Cambridge\"/>\n\n=== Lift-induced drag ===\n{{main|Lift-induced drag}}\n[[File:Induced drag r.svg|thumb|right|150px|Induced drag ''vs.'' lift<ref>Clancy, L.J.

(1965) ''Aerodynamics for Naval Aviators'', Figure 1.30, NAVWEPS 00-80T-80</ref>]]\n'''Lift-induced drag''' (also called '''induced drag''') is drag which occurs as the result of the creation of [[lift (force)|lift]] on a three-dimensional [[lifting body]], such as the [[wing]] or fuselage of an airplane. Induced drag consists primarily of two components: drag due to the creation of trailing vortices ('''vortex drag'''); and the presence of additional viscous drag ('''lift-induced viscous drag''') that is not present when lift is zero. The trailing vortices in the flow-field, present in the wake of a lifting body, derive from the turbulent mixing of air from above and below the body which flows in slightly different directions as a consequence of creation of [[lift (force)|lift]].\n\nWith other parameters remaining the same, as the [[lift (force)|lift]] generated by a body increases, so does the lift-induced drag. This means that as the wing's [[angle of attack]] increases (up to a maximum called the stalling angle), the [[lift coefficient]] also increases, and so too does the lift-induced drag. At the onset of [[Stall (flight)|stall]], lift is abruptly decreased, as is lift-induced drag, but viscous pressure drag, a component of parasite drag, increases due to the formation of turbulent unattached flow in the wake behind the body.\n\n=== Parasitic drag ===\n{{main|parasitic drag}}\n\n'''Parasitic drag''' is drag caused by moving a solid object through a fluid. Parasitic drag is made up of multiple components including viscous pressure drag ('''form drag'''), and drag due to surface roughness ('''skin friction drag'''). Additionally, the presence of multiple bodies in relative proximity may incur so called '''interference drag''', which is sometimes described as a component of parasitic drag.\n\nIn aviation, [[induced drag]] tends to be greater at lower speeds because a high [[angle of attack]] is required to maintain lift, creating more drag. However, as speed increases the angle of attack can be reduced and the induced drag decreases. Parasitic drag, however, increases because the fluid is flowing more quickly around protruding objects increasing friction or drag. At even higher speeds ([[transonic]]), [[wave drag]] enters the picture. Each of these forms of drag changes in proportion to the others based on speed. The combined overall drag curve therefore shows a minimum at some airspeed - an aircraft flying at this speed will be at or close to its optimal efficiency. Pilots will use this speed to maximize [[Endurance (aircraft)|endurance]] (minimum fuel consumption), or maximize [[Glide ratio|gliding range]] in the event of an engine failure.\n\n=== Power curve in aviation ===\n[[File:Drag curves for aircraft in flight.svg|right|thumb|The ''power curve'': parasitic drag and lift-induced drag ''vs.'' airspeed]]\n\nThe interaction of parasitic and induced drag ''vs.'' airspeed can be plotted as a characteristic curve, illustrated here. In aviation, this is often referred to as the ''power curve'', and is important to pilots because it shows that, below a certain airspeed, maintaining airspeed counterintuitively requires ''more'' thrust as speed decreases, rather than less. The consequences of being \"behind the curve\" in flight are important and are taught as part of pilot training. At the subsonic airspeeds where the \"U\" shape of this curve is significant, wave drag has not yet become a factor, and so it is not shown in the curve.\n\n=== Wave drag in transonic and supersonic flow ===\n[[File:Qualitive variation of cd with mach number.png|thumb|right|Qualitative variation in Cd factor with Mach number for aircraft]]\n{{main|wave drag}}\n'''Wave drag''' (also called '''compressibility drag''') is drag that is created when a body moves in a compressible fluid and at speeds that are close to the speed of sound in that fluid. In [[aerodynamics]], wave drag consists of multiple components depending on the speed regime of the flight.\n\nIn transonic flight (Mach numbers greater than about 0.8 and less than about 1.4), wave drag is the result of the formation of shockwaves in the fluid, formed when local areas of supersonic (Mach number greater than 1.0) flow are created. In practice, supersonic flow occurs on bodies traveling well below the speed of sound, as the local speed of air increases as it accelerates over the body to speeds above Mach 1.0. However, full supersonic flow over the vehicle will not develop until well past Mach 1.0. Aircraft flying at transonic speed often incur wave drag through the normal course of operation. In transonic flight, wave drag is commonly referred to as '''transonic compressibility drag'''. Transonic compressibility drag increases significantly as the speed of flight increases towards Mach 1.0, dominating other forms of drag at those speeds.\n\nIn supersonic flight (Mach numbers greater than 1.0), '''wave drag''' is the result of shockwaves present in the fluid and attached to the body, typically '''oblique shockwaves''' formed at the leading and trailing edges of the body. In highly supersonic flows, or in bodies with turning angles sufficiently large, '''unattached shockwaves''', or '''bow waves''' will instead form. Additionally, local areas of transonic flow behind the initial shockwave may occur at lower supersonic speeds, and can lead to the development of additional, smaller shockwaves present on the surfaces of other lifting bodies, similar to those found in transonic flows. In supersonic flow regimes, '''wave drag''' is commonly separated into two components, '''supersonic lift-dependent wave drag''' and '''supersonic volume-dependent wave drag'''.\n\nThe closed form solution for the minimum wave drag of a body of revolution with a fixed length was found by Sears and Haack, and is known as the '''Sears-Haack Distribution'''. Similarly, for a fixed volume, the shape for minimum wave drag is the '''Von Karman Ogive'''.\n\n[[Busemann's Biplane]] is not, in principle, subject to wave drag at all when operated at its design speed, but is incapable of generating lift.\n\n==d'Alembert's paradox==\n{{main|d'Alembert's paradox}}\n\nIn 1752 [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] proved that [[potential flow]], the 18th century state-of-the-art [[inviscid flow]] theory amenable to mathematical solutions, resulted in the prediction of zero drag.  This was in contradiction with experimental evidence, and became known as d'Alembert's paradox.  In the 19th century the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]] for the description of [[viscosity|viscous]] flow were developed by [[Adh\u00e9mar Jean Claude Barr\u00e9 de Saint-Venant|Saint-Venant]], [[Claude-Louis Navier|Navier]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]].  Stokes derived the drag around a sphere at very low [[Reynolds number]]s, the result of which is called [[Stokes' law]].<ref name=Batchelor>Batchelor (2000), pp. 337\u2013343.</ref>\n\nIn the limit of high Reynolds numbers, the Navier\u2013Stokes equations approach the inviscid [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]], of which the potential-flow solutions considered by d'Alembert are solutions.  However, all experiments at high Reynolds numbers showed there is drag. Attempts to construct inviscid [[steady flow]] solutions to the Euler equations, other than the potential flow solutions, did not result in realistic results.<ref name=Batchelor/>\n\nThe notion of [[boundary layer]]s\u2014introduced by [[Ludwig Prandtl|Prandtl]] in 1904, founded on both theory and experiments\u2014explained the causes of drag at high Reynolds numbers.  The boundary layer is the thin layer of fluid close to the object's boundary, where viscous effects remain important even when the viscosity is very small (or equivalently the Reynolds number is very large).<ref name=Batchelor/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Added mass]]\n* [[Aerodynamic force]]\n* [[Angle of attack]]\n* [[Boundary layer]]\n* [[Coand\u0103 effect]]\n* [[Drag crisis]]\n* [[Drag coefficient]]\n* [[Drag equation]]\n* [[Gravity drag]]\n* [[Keulegan\u2013Carpenter number]]\n* [[Lift (force)]]\n* [[Morison equation]]\n* [[Nose cone design]]\n* [[Parasitic drag]]\n* [[Ram pressure]]\n* [[Reynolds number]]\n* [[Stall (fluid mechanics)]]\n* [[Stokes' law]]\n* [[Terminal velocity]]\n* [[Wave drag]]\n* [[Windage]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2\n}} \n*'Improved Empirical Model for Base Drag Prediction on Missile Configurations, based on New Wind Tunnel Data', Frank G Moore et al.

[[Wave drag]] occurs either when a solid object is moving through a gas at or near the [[speed of sound]] or when a solid object is moving along a fluid boundary, as in [[ocean surface wave|surface waves]].\n\n[[File:Drag coefficient on a sphere vs. Reynolds number - main trends.svg|right|thumb|Drag coefficient ''C''<sub>d</sub> for a sphere as a function of [[Reynolds number]] ''Re'', as obtained from laboratory experiments.

At low <math>R_e</math>, <math>C_D</math> is asymptotically proportional to <math>R_e^{-1}</math>, which means that the drag is linearly proportional to the speed.

The graph to the right shows how <math>C_D</math> varies with <math>R_e</math> for the case of a sphere. Since the power needed to overcome the drag force is the product of the force times speed, the power needed to overcome drag will vary as the square of the speed at low Reynolds numbers and as the cube of the speed at high numbers.\n\nIt can be demonstrated that drag force can be expressed as a function of a dimensionless number, which is dimensionally identical to the Bejan number.<ref name=Liversage2018>Liversage, P., and Trancossi, M.

In other words, velocity [[asymptotically]] approaches a maximum value called the [[terminal velocity]] ''v<sub>t</sub>'':\n\n::<math>v_{t} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{2mg}{\\rho A C_d} }. \\,</math>\n\nFor an object falling and released at relative-velocity ''v''&nbsp;=&nbsp;v<sub>i</sub> at time ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, with v<sub>i</sub> \u2264 v<sub>t</sub>, is also defined in terms of the hyperbolic tangent function:\n\n::<math>v(t) = v_t \\tanh \\left( t \\frac{ g }{ v_t } + \\operatorname{arctanh}\\left( \\frac{ v_i}{ v_t} \\right) \\right). \\,</math>\n\nActually, this function is defined by the solution of the following [[differential equation]]:\n\n::<math>g - \\frac{\\rho A C_d}{2m} v^2 = \\frac{dv}{dt}. \\,</math>\n\nOr, more generically (where F(v) are the forces acting on the object beyond drag):\n\n::<math>\\frac{1}{m}\\sum F(v) - \\frac{\\rho A C_d}{2m} v^2 = \\frac{dv}{dt}. \\,</math>\n\nFor a potato-shaped object of average diameter ''d'' and of density ''\u03c1<sub>obj</sub>'', terminal velocity is about\n\n::<math>v_{t} = \\sqrt{ gd \\frac{ \\rho_{obj} }{\\rho} }. \\,</math>\n\nFor objects of water-like density (raindrops, hail, live objects\u2014mammals, birds, insects, etc.) falling in air near Earth's surface at sea level, the terminal velocity is roughly equal to\n\n::<math>v_{t} = 90 \\sqrt{ d }, \\,</math>\n\nwith ''d'' in metre and ''v<sub>t</sub>'' in m/s.  For example, for a human body (<math> \\mathbf{} d </math> ~ 0.6 m) <math> \\mathbf{} v_t </math> ~ 70&nbsp;m/s, for a small animal like a cat (<math> \\mathbf{} d </math> ~ 0.2 m) <math> \\mathbf{} v_t </math> ~ 40&nbsp;m/s, for a small bird (<math> \\mathbf{} d </math> ~ 0.05 m) <math> \\mathbf{} v_t </math> ~ 20&nbsp;m/s, for an insect (<math> \\mathbf{} d </math> ~ 0.01 m) <math> \\mathbf{} v_t </math> ~ 9&nbsp;m/s, and so on. Terminal velocity for very small objects (pollen, etc.) at low Reynolds numbers is determined by Stokes law.\n\nTerminal velocity is higher for larger creatures, and thus potentially more deadly.  A creature such as a mouse falling at its terminal velocity is much more likely to survive impact with the ground than a human falling at its terminal velocity.  A small animal such as a [[cricket (insect)|cricket]] impacting at its terminal velocity will probably be unharmed. This, combined with the relative ratio of limb cross-sectional area vs. body mass (commonly referred to as the [[Square-cube law]]), explains why very small animals can fall from a large height and not be harmed.<ref>Haldane, J.B.S., [http://irl.cs.ucla.edu/papers/right-size.html \"On Being the Right Size\"]</ref>\n\n== Very low Reynolds numbers: Stokes' drag ==\n[[File:Inclinedthrow.gif|thumb|400px|[[Trajectory|Trajectories]] of three objects thrown at the same angle (70\u00b0).

Using 10<sup>\u22123</sup> Pa\u00b7s as the [[dynamic viscosity]] of water in SI units,\nwe find a drag force of 0.09 pN. This is about the drag force that a bacterium experiences as it swims through water.\n\n==Aerodynamics==\nIn [[aerodynamics]], '''aerodynamic drag''' is the fluid drag force that acts on any moving solid body in the direction of the fluid [[freestream]] flow.<ref>Anderson, John D. Jr., ''Introduction to Flight''</ref> From the body's perspective (near-field approach), the drag results from forces due to pressure distributions over the body surface, symbolized <math>D_{pr}</math>, and forces due to skin friction, which is a result of viscosity, denoted <math>D_{f}</math>. Alternatively, calculated from the flowfield perspective (far-field approach), the drag force results from three natural phenomena: [[shock wave]]s, vortex sheet, and [[viscosity]].\n\n===Overview===\nThe [[pressure]] distribution acting on a body's surface exerts normal forces on the body. Those forces can be summed and the component of that force that acts downstream represents the drag force, <math>D_{pr}</math>, due to pressure distribution acting on the body. The nature of these normal forces combines shock wave effects, vortex system generation effects, and wake viscous mechanisms.\n\nThe [[viscosity]] of the fluid has a major effect on drag. In the absence of viscosity, the pressure forces acting to retard the vehicle are canceled by a pressure force further aft that acts to push the vehicle forward; this is called pressure recovery and the result is that the drag is zero. That is to say, the work the body does on the airflow, is reversible and is recovered as there are no frictional effects to convert the flow energy into heat. Pressure recovery acts even in the case of viscous flow. Viscosity, however results in pressure drag and it is the dominant component of drag in the case of vehicles with regions of separated flow, in which the pressure recovery is fairly ineffective.\n\nThe friction drag force, which is a tangential force on the aircraft surface, depends substantially on [[boundary layer]] configuration and viscosity. The net friction drag, <math>D_f</math>, is calculated as the downstream projection of the viscous forces evaluated over the body's surface.\n\nThe sum of friction drag and pressure (form) drag is called viscous drag. This drag component is due to viscosity. In a thermodynamic perspective, viscous effects represent irreversible phenomena and, therefore, they create entropy. The calculated viscous drag <math>D_v</math> use entropy changes to accurately predict the drag force.\n\nWhen the airplane produces lift, another drag component results. [[Lift-induced drag|Induced drag]], symbolized <math>D_i</math>, is due to a modification of the pressure distribution due to the trailing vortex system that accompanies the lift production. An alternative perspective on lift and drag is gained from considering the change of momentum of the airflow.  The wing intercepts the airflow and forces the flow to move downward. This results in an equal and opposite force acting upward on the wing which is the lift force. The change of momentum of the airflow downward results in a reduction of the rearward momentum of the flow which is the result of a force acting forward on the airflow and applied by the wing to the air flow; an equal but opposite force acts on the wing rearward which is the induced drag. Induced drag tends to be the most important component for airplanes during take-off or landing flight. Another drag component, namely [[wave drag]], <math>D_w</math>, results from shock waves in transonic and supersonic flight speeds. The shock waves induce changes in the boundary layer and pressure distribution over the body surface.\n\n===History===\nThe idea that a moving body passing through air or another fluid encounters resistance had been known since the time of [[Aristotle]]. [[Louis Charles Breguet]]'s paper of 1922 began efforts to reduce drag by streamlining.<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite book\n|title=''A History of Aerodynamics: And Its Impact On Flying Machines''\n|first=John David\n|last=Anderson\n|publisher=University of Cambridge\n|year=1929\n}}</ref> Breguet went on to put his ideas into practice by designing several record-breaking aircraft in the 1920s and 1930s. [[Ludwig Prandtl]]'s boundary layer theory in the 1920s provided the impetus to minimise skin friction. A further major call for streamlining was made by Sir [[Melvill Jones]] who provided the theoretical concepts to demonstrate emphatically the importance of streamlining in [[aircraft]] design.<ref name=\"Cambridge\">{{cite web\n|title=University of Cambridge Engineering Department\n|url=http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/125/1925-1950/melvill2.html\n|accessdate=28 Jan 2014\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Biography\">{{cite book\n|title=''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' ''Bennett Melvill Jones. 28 January 1887 -- 31 October 1975''\n|volume=Vol. 23\n|pages=252\u2013282\n|first=Sir Arnold Hall\n|last=Sir Morien Morgan\n|publisher=The Royal Society\n|date=November 1977\n}}</ref><ref name=\"ODNB\">{{cite book\n|title=''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''\n|first=W.A.\n|last=Mair\n|year=1976\n}}</ref> \nIn 1929 his paper \u2018The Streamline Airplane\u2019 presented to the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] was seminal. He proposed an ideal aircraft that would have minimal drag which led to the concepts of a 'clean' monoplane and retractable [[Landing gear|undercarriage]]. The aspect of Jones's paper that most shocked the designers of the time was his plot of the horse power required versus velocity, for an actual and an ideal plane. By looking at a data point for a given aircraft and extrapolating it horizontally to the ideal curve, the velocity gain for the same power can be seen. When Jones finished his presentation, a member of the audience described the results as being of the same level of importance as the [[Carnot cycle]] in thermodynamics.<ref name=\"Anderson\"/><ref name=\"Cambridge\"/>\n\n=== Lift-induced drag ===\n{{main|Lift-induced drag}}\n[[File:Induced drag r.svg|thumb|right|150px|Induced drag ''vs.'' lift<ref>Clancy, L.J. (1975) ''Aerodynamics'' Fig 5.24. Pitman Publishing Limited, London. {{ISBN|0-273-01120-0}}</ref><ref>Hurt, H. H. (1965) ''Aerodynamics for Naval Aviators'', Figure 1.30, NAVWEPS 00-80T-80</ref>]]\n'''Lift-induced drag''' (also called '''induced drag''') is drag which occurs as the result of the creation of [[lift (force)|lift]] on a three-dimensional [[lifting body]], such as the [[wing]] or fuselage of an airplane. Induced drag consists primarily of two components: drag due to the creation of trailing vortices ('''vortex drag'''); and the presence of additional viscous drag ('''lift-induced viscous drag''') that is not present when lift is zero. The trailing vortices in the flow-field, present in the wake of a lifting body, derive from the turbulent mixing of air from above and below the body which flows in slightly different directions as a consequence of creation of [[lift (force)|lift]].\n\nWith other parameters remaining the same, as the [[lift (force)|lift]] generated by a body increases, so does the lift-induced drag. This means that as the wing's [[angle of attack]] increases (up to a maximum called the stalling angle), the [[lift coefficient]] also increases, and so too does the lift-induced drag. At the onset of [[Stall (flight)|stall]], lift is abruptly decreased, as is lift-induced drag, but viscous pressure drag, a component of parasite drag, increases due to the formation of turbulent unattached flow in the wake behind the body.\n\n=== Parasitic drag ===\n{{main|parasitic drag}}\n\n'''Parasitic drag''' is drag caused by moving a solid object through a fluid. Parasitic drag is made up of multiple components including viscous pressure drag ('''form drag'''), and drag due to surface roughness ('''skin friction drag'''). Additionally, the presence of multiple bodies in relative proximity may incur so called '''interference drag''', which is sometimes described as a component of parasitic drag.\n\nIn aviation, [[induced drag]] tends to be greater at lower speeds because a high [[angle of attack]] is required to maintain lift, creating more drag. However, as speed increases the angle of attack can be reduced and the induced drag decreases. Parasitic drag, however, increases because the fluid is flowing more quickly around protruding objects increasing friction or drag. At even higher speeds ([[transonic]]), [[wave drag]] enters the picture. Each of these forms of drag changes in proportion to the others based on speed. The combined overall drag curve therefore shows a minimum at some airspeed - an aircraft flying at this speed will be at or close to its optimal efficiency. Pilots will use this speed to maximize [[Endurance (aircraft)|endurance]] (minimum fuel consumption), or maximize [[Glide ratio|gliding range]] in the event of an engine failure.\n\n=== Power curve in aviation ===\n[[File:Drag curves for aircraft in flight.svg|right|thumb|The ''power curve'': parasitic drag and lift-induced drag ''vs.'' airspeed]]\n\nThe interaction of parasitic and induced drag ''vs.'' airspeed can be plotted as a characteristic curve, illustrated here. In aviation, this is often referred to as the ''power curve'', and is important to pilots because it shows that, below a certain airspeed, maintaining airspeed counterintuitively requires ''more'' thrust as speed decreases, rather than less. The consequences of being \"behind the curve\" in flight are important and are taught as part of pilot training. At the subsonic airspeeds where the \"U\" shape of this curve is significant, wave drag has not yet become a factor, and so it is not shown in the curve.\n\n=== Wave drag in transonic and supersonic flow ===\n[[File:Qualitive variation of cd with mach number.png|thumb|right|Qualitative variation in Cd factor with Mach number for aircraft]]\n{{main|wave drag}}\n'''Wave drag''' (also called '''compressibility drag''') is drag that is created when a body moves in a compressible fluid and at speeds that are close to the speed of sound in that fluid. In [[aerodynamics]], wave drag consists of multiple components depending on the speed regime of the flight.\n\nIn transonic flight (Mach numbers greater than about 0.8 and less than about 1.4), wave drag is the result of the formation of shockwaves in the fluid, formed when local areas of supersonic (Mach number greater than 1.0) flow are created. In practice, supersonic flow occurs on bodies traveling well below the speed of sound, as the local speed of air increases as it accelerates over the body to speeds above Mach 1.0. However, full supersonic flow over the vehicle will not develop until well past Mach 1.0. Aircraft flying at transonic speed often incur wave drag through the normal course of operation. In transonic flight, wave drag is commonly referred to as '''transonic compressibility drag'''. Transonic compressibility drag increases significantly as the speed of flight increases towards Mach 1.0, dominating other forms of drag at those speeds.\n\nIn supersonic flight (Mach numbers greater than 1.0), '''wave drag''' is the result of shockwaves present in the fluid and attached to the body, typically '''oblique shockwaves''' formed at the leading and trailing edges of the body. In highly supersonic flows, or in bodies with turning angles sufficiently large, '''unattached shockwaves''', or '''bow waves''' will instead form. Additionally, local areas of transonic flow behind the initial shockwave may occur at lower supersonic speeds, and can lead to the development of additional, smaller shockwaves present on the surfaces of other lifting bodies, similar to those found in transonic flows. In supersonic flow regimes, '''wave drag''' is commonly separated into two components, '''supersonic lift-dependent wave drag''' and '''supersonic volume-dependent wave drag'''.\n\nThe closed form solution for the minimum wave drag of a body of revolution with a fixed length was found by Sears and Haack, and is known as the '''Sears-Haack Distribution'''. Similarly, for a fixed volume, the shape for minimum wave drag is the '''Von Karman Ogive'''.\n\n[[Busemann's Biplane]] is not, in principle, subject to wave drag at all when operated at its design speed, but is incapable of generating lift.\n\n==d'Alembert's paradox==\n{{main|d'Alembert's paradox}}\n\nIn 1752 [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] proved that [[potential flow]], the 18th century state-of-the-art [[inviscid flow]] theory amenable to mathematical solutions, resulted in the prediction of zero drag.  This was in contradiction with experimental evidence, and became known as d'Alembert's paradox.  In the 19th century the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]] for the description of [[viscosity|viscous]] flow were developed by [[Adh\u00e9mar Jean Claude Barr\u00e9 de Saint-Venant|Saint-Venant]], [[Claude-Louis Navier|Navier]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]].  Stokes derived the drag around a sphere at very low [[Reynolds number]]s, the result of which is called [[Stokes' law]].<ref name=Batchelor>Batchelor (2000), pp. 337\u2013343.</ref>\n\nIn the limit of high Reynolds numbers, the Navier\u2013Stokes equations approach the inviscid [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]], of which the potential-flow solutions considered by d'Alembert are solutions.  However, all experiments at high Reynolds numbers showed there is drag. Attempts to construct inviscid [[steady flow]] solutions to the Euler equations, other than the potential flow solutions, did not result in realistic results.<ref name=Batchelor/>\n\nThe notion of [[boundary layer]]s\u2014introduced by [[Ludwig Prandtl|Prandtl]] in 1904, founded on both theory and experiments\u2014explained the causes of drag at high Reynolds numbers.  The boundary layer is the thin layer of fluid close to the object's boundary, where viscous effects remain important even when the viscosity is very small (or equivalently the Reynolds number is very large).<ref name=Batchelor/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Added mass]]\n* [[Aerodynamic force]]\n* [[Angle of attack]]\n* [[Boundary layer]]\n* [[Coand\u0103 effect]]\n* [[Drag crisis]]\n* [[Drag coefficient]]\n* [[Drag equation]]\n* [[Gravity drag]]\n* [[Keulegan\u2013Carpenter number]]\n* [[Lift (force)]]\n* [[Morison equation]]\n* [[Nose cone design]]\n* [[Parasitic drag]]\n* [[Ram pressure]]\n* [[Reynolds number]]\n* [[Stall (fluid mechanics)]]\n* [[Stokes' law]]\n* [[Terminal velocity]]\n* [[Wave drag]]\n* [[Windage]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2\n}} \n*'Improved Empirical Model for Base Drag Prediction on Missile Configurations, based on New Wind Tunnel Data', Frank G Moore et al.

He befriends two other \"misfits\" - ZhenZhen, a runaway from China, and Dariush, a teen from a rich but bankrupt family. While the campers are canoeing Dariush wanders off with Alex and find another young teen, Gabriel, a juvenile delinquent. While heading back to camp they witness incoming alien ships invading the valley, and also discover the camp has evacuated - all except for Conrad, a camp counselor. Suddenly, an escape pod from the International Space Station crashes into the place with a dying astronaut inside, who gives Alex a key that needs to get to NASA station JPL, deemed the only way to destroy the aliens. An alien appears with its \"dog\" and kills the astronaut, but Alex and his friends manage to fend it off and escape the camp.\n\nThey make their way to the Sheriff's Office and discover and inmate, Lou, who has been left behind. Alex decides to release him before the group continues on their way to JPL. The group is found by some Marines who take the key and put the children on a bus to take them to safety. However, aliens attack and kill the soldiers, so the group takes the key back and continues on their way to JPL. After stopping to rest for the night, they are attacked by a gang of masked individuals led by Lou. He agrees to let the teens go if Alex gives him the key. Alex refuses and right before Lou attacks him, the alien from the camp attacks them and Lou is killed, but the teens manage to escape.\n\nThe teens finally make it to JPL after being attacked by the alien for the third time, only to find that the doctor who needs the key is dead. The teens are able to make radio contact with a general who explains that the key can be used to destroy the alien mothership in orbit via a [[Cold War]] defense project named Excalibur. Zhenzhen goes into the basement to start the generators while Alex goes on the roof to the communication tower. Dariush and Gabriel stay in the command center of JPL to insert the key into the systems. Alex is attacked on the roof by the alien while Zhenzhen is attacked in the basement by an alien dog but manages to lock it in the basement and get back to the command room to help Gabriel, who cannot read the numbers, insert the launch key since Dariush passed out from blood loss due to an injury.\n\nAfter successfully inserting the launch keys, the General warns Zhenzhen, Dariush, and Gabriel to get out of the building because JPL is not safe and there are two units on the way to get them. In the meantime, Alex has managed to lure the alien into a highly flammable engine test room and burns the alien. With the building burning to the ground, Alex relives the traumatic events leading to his father's death. However, he moves past them and is able to escape just in time. The group of teens watch from the ground as the alien mothership is blown up in the atmosphere. Alex is reunited with his mother and the children are deemed as heroes. Pictures show the teens being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, being awarded crowns and sashes, and riding in parades throughout America.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jack Gore (actor)|Jack Gore]] as Alex\n* Miya Cech as ZhenZhen\n*[[Benjamin Flores Jr.]] as Dariush\n*Alessio Scalzotto as Gabriel\n*[[King Bach|Andrew Bachelor]] as Logan\n*[[Annabeth Gish]] as Grace\n*[[Scott MacArthur]] as Lou\n*Dean Jagger as Captain Hawking\n*[[Michael Beach]] as General Khoury\n*[[Lynn Collins]] as Major Collins\n*David Theune as Head Counselor\n*[[Tony Cavalero]] as Conrad\n*Carl McDowell as Carl\n*Punam Patel as Angeline\n*[[Jason Rogel]] as Customs Official\n*[[Chris Wylde]] as Uncle Chris\n*[[Rudy Mancuso]] as Wes\n*Amanda Cerny as Lucy\n*[[Allan Graf]] as Taxi Driver\n*Cameron Fuller as Young Soldier\n*Richard Gore as Alex's dad\n*[[Peter Parros]] as Dariush's dad\n*Annie Cavalero as Zip Line Counselor\n\n==Production==\nIn March 2018, it was reported that [[McG]] would direct ''Rim of the World'' for [[Netflix]] from a screenplay by [[Zack Stentz]].
