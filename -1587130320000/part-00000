Metacom ({{circa}}&nbsp;1638\u20131676) was his younger son, and he became tribal chief in 1662 after Massasoit's death. Metacom, however, did not maintain his father's alliance between the Wampanoags and the colonists. The colonists insisted that the peace agreement in 1671 should include the surrender of Indian guns; then three Wampanoags were hanged for murder in [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1675 which increased the tensions. Indian raiding parties attacked homesteads and villages throughout Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Maine over the next six months, and the Colonial militia retaliated. The [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]] remained neutral, but several individual Narragansetts participated in raids of colonial strongholds and militia, so colonial leaders deemed them to be in violation of peace treaties. The colonies assembled the largest army that New England had yet mustered, consisting of 1,000 militia and 150 Indian allies, and Governor Josiah Winslow marshaled them to attack the Narragansetts in November 1675. They attacked and burned Indian villages throughout Rhode Island territory, culminating with the attack on the Narragansetts' main fort in the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. An estimated 600 Narragansetts were killed, many of them women and children, and the Indian coalition was then taken over by Narragansett sachem Canonchet. They pushed back the colonial frontier in Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, and Rhode Island colonies, burning towns as they went, including [[Providence Plantations|Providence]] in March 1676. However, the colonial militia overwhelmed the Indian coalition and, by the end of the war, the Wampanoags and their Narragansett allies were almost completely destroyed.<ref>{{Britannica| url=https://www.britannica.com/event/King-Philips-War| title=King Philip's War BRITISH-NATIVE AMERICAN CONFLICT| last=Warren| first=Jason W.| work=Encyclopedia Britannica| accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref> On August 12, 1676, Metacom fled to Mount Hope where he was killed by the militia.\n\nThe war was the greatest calamity in seventeenth-century New England and is considered by many to be the deadliest war in Colonial American history.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\">{{cite book |last=Drake |first=James David |date=1999 |title=King Philip's War: Civil War in New England, 1675-1676 |url=https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00|url-access=registration |location= |publisher=The University of Massachusetts Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00/page/1 1\u201315] |isbn=1558492240 }}</ref> In the space of little more than a year, 12 of the region's towns were destroyed and many more were damaged, the economy of Plymouth and [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] Colonies was all but ruined and their population was decimated, losing one-tenth of all men available for military service.<ref name=\"Philip Gould\">{{cite journal| first=Philip| last=Gould| title=Reinventing Benjamin Church: Virtue, Citizenship and the History of King Philip's War in Early National America| work=Journal of the Early Republic| volume=16| date=Winter 1996|doi=10.2307/3124421}}</ref>{{rp|656}}<ref>{{cite book| last=Schultz| first=Eric B.| author2=Michael J.

The New England colonists faced their enemies without support from any outside government or military, and this began to give them a group identity separate and distinct from Britain.<ref>Lepore (1998), ''The Name of War'' (1999) pp 5-7</ref>\n\n==Historical context==\n[[Plymouth Colony]] was established in 1620 with significant early help from local Indians, particularly [[Squanto]] and Massasoit. Subsequent colonists founded [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Boston]], and many small towns around Massachusetts Bay between 1628 and 1640, during a time of increased English immigration. The colonists progressively expanded throughout the territories of the several [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking tribes in the region. Prior to King Philip's War, tensions fluctuated between Indian tribes and the colonists, but relations were generally peaceful.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\nThe [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], and [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]] colonies each developed separate relations with the [[Wampanoag]]s, [[Nipmuc]]ks, [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Mohegan people|Mohegans]], [[Pequots]], and other tribes of New England, whose territories historically had differing boundaries. Many of the neighboring tribes had been traditional competitors and enemies. As the colonial population increased, the New Englanders expanded their settlements along the region's coastal plain and up the [[Connecticut River]] valley. By 1675, they had established a few small towns in the interior between Boston and the Connecticut River settlements.\n\nThe [[Wampanoag]] tribe under Metacomet's leadership had entered into an agreement with the Plymouth Colony and believed that they could rely on the colony for protection. However, in the decades preceding the war, it became clear to them that the treaty did not mean that the Colonists were not allowed to settle in new territories.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\n===Failure of diplomacy===\n[[File:King Philip's Seat.jpg|thumb|250px|right|\"King Philip's Seat,\" a meeting place on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)]]]]\nMetacomet became [[sachem]] of the [[Pokanoket]] and Grand Sachem of the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] Confederacy in 1662 after the death of his older brother Grand Sachem [[Wamsutta]] (called \"Alexander\" by the colonists), who had succeeded their father [[Massasoit]] (d. 1661) as chief. Metacomet was well known to the colonists before his ascension as paramount chief to the Wampanoags, but he distrusted the colonists.\n\nThe Plymouth colonists had passed laws making it illegal to have commerce with the Wampanoags.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} They learned that Wamsutta had sold a parcel of land to [[Roger Williams]], so Governor [[Josiah Winslow]] had Wamsutta arrested, even though Wampanoags who lived outside of colonist jurisdiction were not accountable to Plymouth Colony laws. Metacomet began negotiating with the other [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes against the Plymouth Colony soon after the death of his father and his brother.<ref name=\"George Howe 1958\">George Howe, ''Mount Hope'' (1958) {{ISBN|0670490814}}</ref>\n\n===Population===\nThe population of New England colonists totaled about 80,000 people. They lived in 110 towns, of which 64 were in the Massachusetts Bay colony, which then included the southwestern portion of Maine. The towns had about 16,000 men of military age who were almost all part of the militia, as universal training was prevalent in all [[colonial New England]] towns. Many towns had built strong garrison houses for defense, and others had stockades enclosing most of the houses. All of these were strengthened as the war progressed. Some poorly populated towns were abandoned if they did not have enough men to defend them.\n\nEach town had local militias based on all eligible men who had to supply their own arms. Only those who were too old, too young, disabled, or clergy were excused from military service. The militias were usually only minimally trained and initially did relatively poorly against the warring Indians, until more effective training and tactics could be devised. Joint forces of militia volunteers and volunteer Indian allies were found to be the most effective. The Indian allies of the colonists numbered about 1,000 from the [[Mohegan]]s and [[Praying Indian]]s, with about 200 warriors.<ref>Exact numbers of Indian allies are unavailable but about 200 warriors are mentioned in different dispatches implying a total population of about 800-1,000.</ref>\n\nBy 1676, the regional Indian population had decreased to about 10,000 (exact numbers are unavailable), largely because of epidemics. These included about 4,000 Narragansetts of western Rhode Island and eastern Connecticut, 2,400 [[Nipmuck]]s of central and western Massachusetts, and 2,400 combined in the Massachusett and Pawtucket tribes living around Massachusetts Bay and extending northwest to Maine. The Wampanoags and Pokanokets of Plymouth and eastern Rhode Island are thought to have numbered fewer than 1,000. About one in four were considered to be warriors. By then, the Indians had almost universally adopted steel knives, tomahawks, and [[flintlock]] muskets as their weapons. The various tribes had no common government. They had distinct cultures and often warred among themselves,<ref>Herbert L. Osgood, ''The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century'' (1904) 1: 543</ref> although they all spoke related languages from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian family]].\n\n===The trial===\n[[John Sassamon]] was an Indian convert to Christianity, commonly referred to as a \"[[praying Indian]].\" He played a key role as a \"cultural mediator,\" negotiating with both colonists and Indians while belonging to neither party.{{sfn|Lepore p. 10}} He was an early graduate of [[Harvard College]] and served as a translator and adviser to Metacomet. He reported to the governor of [[Plymouth Colony]] that Metacomet planned to gather allies for Indian attacks on widely dispersed colonial settlements.<ref name=Philbrick>{{cite book |first=Nathaniel |last=Philbrick| year=2006| title=Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War|url=https://archive.org/details/mayflower00nath |url-access=registration | location=New York |publisher= [[Penguin Books|Penguin]]| authorlink=Nathaniel Philbrick}}</ref>{{rp|221}}\n\nMetacomet was brought before a public court, where court officials admitted that they had no proof but warned that they would confiscate Wampanoag land and guns if they had any further reports that he was conspiring to start a war. Not long after, Sassamon's body was found in the ice-covered [[Assawompset Pond]], and Plymouth Colony officials arrested three Wampanoags on the testimony of an Indian witness, including one of Metacomet's counselors. A jury that included six Indian elders convicted the men of Sassamon's murder, and they were executed by hanging on June 8, 1675 [[Julian calendar|(O.S.)]], at Plymouth.\n\n==Southern theater, 1675==\n\n=== Raid on Swansea ===\nA band of [[Pokanoket]]s attacked several isolated homesteads in the small Plymouth colony settlement of [[Swansea, Massachusetts|Swansea]] on June 20, 1675.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t5m90c088;view=1up;seq=78| title=The History of King Philip's War| author=Church, Benjamin (1639-1718)| publisher=HathiTrust| accessdate=August 12, 2015}}</ref> They laid siege to the town, then destroyed it five days later and killed several more people.

The Narragansetts had not been directly involved in the war, but they had sheltered many of the Wampanoag fighters, women, and children. Some of their warriors had participated in several Indian attacks. The colonists distrusted the tribe and did not understand the various alliances. As the colonial forces went through Rhode Island, they found and burned several Indian towns which had been abandoned by the Narragansetts, who had retreated to a massive fort in a frozen swamp. The [[Little Ice Age|cold weather]] in December froze the swamp so that it was relatively easy to traverse. The colonial force found the Narragansett fort on December 19, 1675, near present-day [[South Kingstown, Rhode Island]]; they attacked in a combined force of Plymouth, Massachusetts, and Connecticut militia numbering about 1,000 men, including about 150 [[Pequots]] and [[Mohican]] Indian allies. The fierce battle that followed is known as the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. It is believed that the militia killed about 600 Narragansetts. They burned the fort (occupying over {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land) and destroyed most of the tribe's winter stores.\n\nMost of the Narragansett warriors  escaped into the frozen swamp. The colonists lost many of their officers in this assault; about 70 of their men were killed and nearly 150 more wounded.  The rest of the colonial assembled forces returned to their homes, lacking supplies for an extended campaign. The nearby towns in Rhode Island provided care for the wounded until they could return to their homes.<ref>Leach (1954), ''Flintlock and Tomahawk'', pp. 130\u2013132</ref>\n\n=== Mohawk intervention ===\nIn December 1675, Metacomet established a winter camp in [[Schaghticoke (village), New York|Schaghticoke]], New York.<ref name=\"eric17\">{{cite book|last1=Tougias|first1=Michael|title=King Philip's War: The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten Conflict|date=2017|publisher=Countryman Press|isbn=1581574908|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I422DAAAQBAJ&dq}}</ref> His reason for moving into New York has been attributed to a desire to enlist [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] aid in the conflict.<ref name=\"drake\">{{cite book|last1=Drake|first1=James|title=King Philip's War: Civil War in New England, 1675-1676|date=1999|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|isbn=1558492240|page=[https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00/page/122 122]|url=https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00|url-access=registration}}</ref> Though New York was a non-belligerent, Governor [[Edmund Andros]] was nonetheless concerned at the arrival of the Wampanoag sachem.<ref name=\"eric17\"/> Either with Andros' sanction, or of their own accord, the Mohawk\u2014traditional rivals of the Algonquian people\u2014launched a surprise assault against a 500-warrior band under Metacomet's command the following February.<ref name=\"eric17\"/><ref name=\"drake\"/> The \"ruthless\" ''[[coup de main]]'' resulted in the death of between 70 and as many as 460 of the Wampanoag.<ref name=\"barr\"/><ref name=\"eric17\"/> His forces crippled, Metacomet withdrew to New England, pursued \"relentlessly\" by Mohawk forces who attacked Algonquian settlements and ambushed their supply parties.<ref name=\"eric17\"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Calloway|first1=Colin|title=After King Philip's War: Presence and Persistence in Indian New England|date=2000|publisher=University Press of New England|isbn=1611680611|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXrgK29zl2QC&dq}}</ref><ref name=\"barr\">{{cite book|last1=Barr|first1=Daniel|title=Unconquered: The Iroquois League at War in Colonial America|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=0275984664|page=[https://archive.org/details/unconquerediroqu00barr_0/page/73 73]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/unconquerediroqu00barr_0/page/73}}</ref>\n\nOver the next several months, fear of Mohawk attack led some Wampanoag to surrender to the colonists, and one historian described the decision of the Mohawk to engage Metacomet's forces as \"the blow that lost the war for Philip\".<ref name=\"drake\"/><ref name=\"eric17\"/>\n\n===Indian campaign===\nIndians attacked and destroyed more settlements throughout the winter of 1675\u201376 in their effort to annihilate the colonists.

Philip led a force of 1,500 [[Wampanoag]], [[Nipmuc]], and [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] Indians in a dawn attack on the isolated village, which then included all or part of the neighboring modern communities of [[Bolton, Massachusetts|Bolton]] and [[Clinton, Massachusetts|Clinton]]. They attacked five fortified houses. The house of the Rev. Joseph Rowlandson was set on fire, and most of its occupants were slaughtered\u2014more than 30 people. Rowlandson's wife [[Mary Rowlandson|Mary]] was taken prisoner, and afterward wrote a best-selling [[captivity narrative]] of her experiences.

The town was surprised by Indian raiders at dawn, who besieged a local [[garrison house]] and burned several unoccupied houses and farms. Reinforcements that arrived from nearby towns were drawn into ambushes by the Indians; Captain Samuel Wadsworth lost his life and half of a 70-man militia in such an ambush.\n\n=== Battle of Turner's Falls ===\nOn May 18, 1676, Captain William Turner of the Massachusetts Militia and a group of about 150 militia volunteers (mostly minimally trained farmers) attacked an Indian fishing camp at Peskeopscut on the [[Connecticut River]], now called [[Turners Falls, Massachusetts]]. The colonists killed 100\u2013200 Indians in retaliation for earlier Indian attacks against Deerfield and other settlements and for the colonial losses in the [[Battle of Bloody Brook]]. Turner and nearly 40 of the militia were killed during the return from the falls.<ref>Leach, Douglas Edward, ''Flintlock and Tomahawk \u2013 New England in King Philip's War'', pp. 200\u2013203</ref>\n\nThe colonists defeated an attack at [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]] on June 12, 1676 with the help of their [[Mohegan people|Mohegan]] allies, scattering most of the Indian survivors into [[New Hampshire]] and farther north. Later that month, a force of 250 Indians was routed near [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]]. Combined forces of colonial volunteers and their Indian allies continued to attack, kill, capture, or disperse bands of [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Nipmucs]], and [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoags]] as they tried to plant crops or return to their traditional locations. The colonists granted amnesty to those who surrendered or who were captured and showed that they had not participated in the conflict. Captives who had participated in attacks on the many settlements were hanged, enslaved, or put to [[indentured servitude]], depending upon the colony involved.\n\n=== Battle of Mount Hope ===\n[[File:Colonel Benjamin Church.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]]: Father of [[United States Army Ranger|American Rangers]]]]\nMetacomet's allies began to desert him, and more than 400 had surrendered to the colonists by early July. Metacomet took refuge in the Assowamset Swamp below Providence, and the colonists formed raiding parties of militia and Indian allies. Metacomet was killed by one of these teams when he was tracked down by Captain [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]] and Captain [[Josiah Standish]] of the Plymouth Colony militia at Mount Hope in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]]. He was shot and killed by an Indian named [[John Alderman]] on August 12, 1676.<ref name=\"Philip Gould\"/>{{rp|647}} Metacomet's corpse was beheaded, then [[drawn and quartered]], a traditional treatment of criminals in this time period. His head was displayed in Plymouth for a generation.<ref>Schultz, Eric and Michael Tougias. ''King Philip's War: The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten Conflict\". The Countryman Press. 1999. p. 290</ref>\n\nCaptain Church and his soldiers captured Pocasset war chief Anawan on August 28, 1676, at [[Anawan Rock]] in [[Rehoboth, Massachusetts]]. He was an old man at the time, and a chief captain of [[Metacomet]]. His capture marked the final event in King Philip's War, as he was also beheaded.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Northern Theater (Maine and Acadia) ==\n[[File:Night Attack of Indians.jpg|thumb|right|Indian revenge on [[Richard Waldron]] for his role in King Philip's War, [[Dover, New Hampshire]] (1689)]]\nFrench interests in Maine originated in the fur trade and the sale of fish, both to France. The French colonies in North America were primarily interested in trade and not in creating large cities. Instead, they preferred to convert the Indian population to Catholicism, or else to limit their contact with the Indians to trade. As English presence increased on the southern coast of Maine, the French [[Jesuits]] paid many of the area's tribes for the scalps of Protestant or English settlers, especially the [[Abenaki]]. The Jesuits in charge of coordinating with the tribes were located in a small mission town near [[Norridgewock, Maine]], and led by Jesuit Father [[S\u00e9bastien Rale]]. Two other mission towns were established, one based around [[Castine, Maine]], (established by Baron de St. Castin) and one on the [[Saint Francis River (Canada\u2013United States)|St. Francis River]] between [[New Brunswick]] and Maine.\n\nThe more permanent English settlers moved northward from the colony of Massachusetts Bay, most of them Puritans who were unhappy with the political climate in Massachusetts Bay. Constant friction over many issues became the reason for many Abenaki raids in southern Maine, specifically over the issue of fishing rights for cod. Up until 1675, however, fighting had been limited to minor skirmishes that were more about the destruction of supplies than murder.\n\nWhat is thought to have been the first action in Maine came when a 25-man militia gathered at [[Falmouth, Maine]], in 1675 and sailed to an Indian village, thought to be a part of the Abenaki, with a single sloop towing [[shallops]]. The Indians drove them off and took the shallops from them. Later that month, the tribe crossed the [[Saco River]] in the captured shallops and attacked the settlement of Winter Harbor. Little damage was caused, and similar raids were conducted against [[Wells, Maine|Wells]] and Falmouth later that year. The ultimate cause leading to war was the ruling by the [[Massachusetts General Court]] in 1676 making it illegal to sell firearms, powder, or rounds to the area's tribes. New England tribes had grown dependent on the musket for hunting, and the English colonists' remaining Indian allies switched to the French side. The French encouraged them to raid the English settlements, due to the tension in Europe at the time.<ref>See [[War of the Spanish Succession]].</ref>\n\nMuch of the northern fighting was centered around raids meant to destroy property and infrastructure rather than to kill people. The lack of population on both sides meant that large battles were out of the question initially. For the majority of the war, ship combat mostly involved muskets, and the infantry relied more on melee fighting than guns. Later in the war, reinforcements from southern New England introduced modern and well-equipped ships and infantry, turning the tide permanently. This was also the first time that Colonial Rangers were used, acting as guides and scouts for the main party of militia. Much of the fighting was also conducted on the coast in small boats and ships.\n\n[[Richard Waldron]] and [[Charles Frost (military officer)|Charles Frost]] led the English colonial forces in the northern region, while [[Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin]] instructed the tribal chiefs in the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]]. Three major campaigns (one each year) were launched by the Indians in [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1675)|1675]], [[Northwest Coast Campaign (1676)|1676]], and [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1677)|1677]], most of which led to a massive colonial response. Waldron sent forces so far north that he attacked the [[Mi'kmaq]] in [[Acadia]].\n\nThroughout the campaigns, a Wabanaki leader named Mugg Hegone repeatedly attacked towns such as Black Point ([[Scarborough, Maine|Scarborough]]), Wells, and [[Damariscove Island|Damariscove]], building an Indian navy out of the approximately 40 sloops and a dozen 30-ton ships previously armed by militia. Many of Maine's towns were burned, and most of the population left. Maine's fishing industry was completely destroyed by the Wabanaki flotilla. Records from Salem, Maine reported 20 ketches stolen and destroyed in one raid. Mugg Hegone was killed on his third raid on Black Point. With their leader gone, most of the Indian flotilla broke up and was hunted down by New York privateers and Royal Navy vessels.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\">Duncan, Roger F. Coastal Maine: A Maritime History. Woodstock: Countryman, 2002. Print.</ref>\n\nColonial responses to raids generally failed in both their objectives and accomplishments. Few Indians were lost, and only two French Jesuits were reported killed. The colonists were much more successful in the later campaigns when they had the advantage in weapons. Their most successful ventures were a surprise attack near [[Dover, New Hampshire]], in which more than 150 Indians were captured, and in the defense of [[Pemaquid, Maine]], from the Indian flotilla. One of the most notorious raids was in August 1679 when Indians attacked a settlement at the [[Sheepscot River]] near [[Merrymeeting Bay]] in Maine. Sir [[William Phips]] rescued local settlers by bringing them on board his vessel, abandoning his cargo of lumber. He was financially ruined when the Indians destroyed the shipyard and his intended cargo, although he was recognized as a hero in Boston.<ref>Lounsberry, Alice (1941). ''Sir William Phips''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 23\u201326.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the war, the Northern Campaigns saw approximately 400 settlers die, Maine's fishing economy gone, and the Indians maintaining power in eastern and northern Maine. There is not an accurate account of the number of Indians who died, but it is thought to be between 100 and 300.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\"/> The official fighting ended in the northern theater with the [[Treaty of Casco (1678)]]. Skirmishes continued until [[Father Rale's War]], after which the French left Maine.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Kingphilip.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The site of King Philip's death in Miery Swamp on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)]]]]\n\n=== Southern New England ===\nThe war in southern New England largely ended with Metacomet's death.

About 2,000 Indians escaped to other tribes to the north or west; they joined continued Indian attacks from those bases well into the next century.

Metacom ({{circa}}&nbsp;1638\u20131676) was his younger son, and he became tribal chief in 1662 after Massasoit's death. Metacom, however, did not maintain his father's alliance between the Wampanoags and the colonists. The colonists insisted that the peace agreement in 1671 should include the surrender of Indian guns; then three Wampanoags were hanged for murder in [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1675 which increased the tensions. Indian raiding parties attacked homesteads and villages throughout Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Maine over the next six months, and the Colonial militia retaliated. The [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]] remained neutral, but several individual Narragansetts participated in raids of colonial strongholds and militia, so colonial leaders deemed them to be in violation of peace treaties. The colonies assembled the largest army that New England had yet mustered, consisting of 1,000 militia and 150 Indian allies, and Governor Josiah Winslow marshaled them to attack the Narragansetts in November 1675. They attacked and burned Indian villages throughout Rhode Island territory, culminating with the attack on the Narragansetts' main fort in the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. An estimated 600 Narragansetts were killed, many of them women and children, and the Indian coalition was then taken over by Narragansett sachem Canonchet. They pushed back the colonial frontier in Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, and Rhode Island colonies, burning towns as they went, including [[Providence Plantations|Providence]] in March 1676.

Subsequent colonists founded [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Boston]], and many small towns around Massachusetts Bay between 1628 and 1640, during a time of increased English immigration. The colonists progressively expanded throughout the territories of the several [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking tribes in the region. Prior to King Philip's War, tensions fluctuated between Indian tribes and the colonists, but relations were generally peaceful.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\nThe [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], and [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]] colonies each developed separate relations with the [[Wampanoag]]s, [[Nipmuc]]ks, [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Mohegan people|Mohegans]], [[Pequots]], and other tribes of New England, whose territories historically had differing boundaries. Many of the neighboring tribes had been traditional competitors and enemies. As the colonial population increased, the New Englanders expanded their settlements along the region's coastal plain and up the [[Connecticut River]] valley. By 1675, they had established a few small towns in the interior between Boston and the Connecticut River settlements.\n\nThe [[Wampanoag]] tribe under Metacomet's leadership had entered into an agreement with the Plymouth Colony and believed that they could rely on the colony for protection. However, in the decades preceding the war, it became clear to them that the treaty did not mean that the Colonists were not allowed to settle in new territories.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\n===Failure of diplomacy===\n[[File:King Philip's Seat.jpg|thumb|250px|right|\"King Philip's Seat,\" a meeting place on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)]]]]\nMetacomet became [[sachem]] of the [[Pokanoket]] and Grand Sachem of the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] Confederacy in 1662 after the death of his older brother Grand Sachem [[Wamsutta]] (called \"Alexander\" by the colonists), who had succeeded their father [[Massasoit]] (d. 1661) as chief. Metacomet was well known to the colonists before his ascension as paramount chief to the Wampanoags, but he distrusted the colonists.\n\nThe Plymouth colonists had passed laws making it illegal to have commerce with the Wampanoags.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} They learned that Wamsutta had sold a parcel of land to [[Roger Williams]], so Governor [[Josiah Winslow]] had Wamsutta arrested, even though Wampanoags who lived outside of colonist jurisdiction were not accountable to Plymouth Colony laws. Metacomet began negotiating with the other [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes against the Plymouth Colony soon after the death of his father and his brother.<ref name=\"George Howe 1958\">George Howe, ''Mount Hope'' (1958) {{ISBN|0670490814}}</ref>\n\n===Population===\nThe population of New England colonists totaled about 80,000 people. They lived in 110 towns, of which 64 were in the Massachusetts Bay colony, which then included the southwestern portion of Maine. The towns had about 16,000 men of military age who were almost all part of the militia, as universal training was prevalent in all [[colonial New England]] towns. Many towns had built strong garrison houses for defense, and others had stockades enclosing most of the houses. All of these were strengthened as the war progressed. Some poorly populated towns were abandoned if they did not have enough men to defend them.\n\nEach town had local militias based on all eligible men who had to supply their own arms. Only those who were too old, too young, disabled, or clergy were excused from military service. The militias were usually only minimally trained and initially did relatively poorly against the warring Indians, until more effective training and tactics could be devised. Joint forces of militia volunteers and volunteer Indian allies were found to be the most effective. The Indian allies of the colonists numbered about 1,000 from the [[Mohegan]]s and [[Praying Indian]]s, with about 200 warriors.<ref>Exact numbers of Indian allies are unavailable but about 200 warriors are mentioned in different dispatches implying a total population of about 800-1,000.</ref>\n\nBy 1676, the regional Indian population had decreased to about 10,000 (exact numbers are unavailable), largely because of epidemics. These included about 4,000 Narragansetts of western Rhode Island and eastern Connecticut, 2,400 [[Nipmuck]]s of central and western Massachusetts, and 2,400 combined in the Massachusett and Pawtucket tribes living around Massachusetts Bay and extending northwest to Maine. The Wampanoags and Pokanokets of Plymouth and eastern Rhode Island are thought to have numbered fewer than 1,000. About one in four were considered to be warriors. By then, the Indians had almost universally adopted steel knives, tomahawks, and [[flintlock]] muskets as their weapons. The various tribes had no common government. They had distinct cultures and often warred among themselves,<ref>Herbert L. Osgood, ''The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century'' (1904) 1: 543</ref> although they all spoke related languages from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian family]].\n\n===The trial===\n[[John Sassamon]] was an Indian convert to Christianity, commonly referred to as a \"[[praying Indian]].\" He played a key role as a \"cultural mediator,\" negotiating with both colonists and Indians while belonging to neither party.{{sfn|Lepore p. 10}} He was an early graduate of [[Harvard College]] and served as a translator and adviser to Metacomet.

Not long after, Sassamon's body was found in the ice-covered [[Assawompset Pond]], and Plymouth Colony officials arrested three Wampanoags on the testimony of an Indian witness, including one of Metacomet's counselors.

The Narragansetts had not been directly involved in the war, but they had sheltered many of the Wampanoag fighters, women, and children. Some of their warriors had participated in several Indian attacks. The colonists distrusted the tribe and did not understand the various alliances. As the colonial forces went through Rhode Island, they found and burned several Indian towns which had been abandoned by the Narragansetts, who had retreated to a massive fort in a frozen swamp. The [[Little Ice Age|cold weather]] in December froze the swamp so that it was relatively easy to traverse. The colonial force found the Narragansett fort on December 19, 1675, near present-day [[South Kingstown, Rhode Island]]; they attacked in a combined force of Plymouth, Massachusetts, and Connecticut militia numbering about 1,000 men, including about 150 [[Pequots]] and [[Mohican]] Indian allies. The fierce battle that followed is known as the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. It is believed that the militia killed about 600 Narragansetts. They burned the fort (occupying over {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land) and destroyed most of the tribe's winter stores.\n\nMost of the Narragansett warriors  escaped into the frozen swamp. The colonists lost many of their officers in this assault; about 70 of their men were killed and nearly 150 more wounded.  The rest of the colonial assembled forces returned to their homes, lacking supplies for an extended campaign.

They attacked five fortified houses. The house of the Rev. Joseph Rowlandson was set on fire, and most of its occupants were slaughtered\u2014more than 30 people. Rowlandson's wife [[Mary Rowlandson|Mary]] was taken prisoner, and afterward wrote a best-selling [[captivity narrative]] of her experiences.

The towns of the Connecticut colony were largely unharmed in the war, although more than 100 Connecticut militia died in their support of the other colonies.\n\n=== Attack on Sudbury ===\nThe [[Attack on Sudbury]] was fought in [[Sudbury, Massachusetts]], on April 21, 1676. The town was surprised by Indian raiders at dawn, who besieged a local [[garrison house]] and burned several unoccupied houses and farms. Reinforcements that arrived from nearby towns were drawn into ambushes by the Indians; Captain Samuel Wadsworth lost his life and half of a 70-man militia in such an ambush.\n\n=== Battle of Turner's Falls ===\nOn May 18, 1676, Captain William Turner of the Massachusetts Militia and a group of about 150 militia volunteers (mostly minimally trained farmers) attacked an Indian fishing camp at Peskeopscut on the [[Connecticut River]], now called [[Turners Falls, Massachusetts]]. The colonists killed 100\u2013200 Indians in retaliation for earlier Indian attacks against Deerfield and other settlements and for the colonial losses in the [[Battle of Bloody Brook]]. Turner and nearly 40 of the militia were killed during the return from the falls.<ref>Leach, Douglas Edward, ''Flintlock and Tomahawk \u2013 New England in King Philip's War'', pp. 200\u2013203</ref>\n\nThe colonists defeated an attack at [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]] on June 12, 1676 with the help of their [[Mohegan people|Mohegan]] allies, scattering most of the Indian survivors into [[New Hampshire]] and farther north. Later that month, a force of 250 Indians was routed near [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]]. Combined forces of colonial volunteers and their Indian allies continued to attack, kill, capture, or disperse bands of [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Nipmucs]], and [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoags]] as they tried to plant crops or return to their traditional locations. The colonists granted amnesty to those who surrendered or who were captured and showed that they had not participated in the conflict.

Metacomet took refuge in the Assowamset Swamp below Providence, and the colonists formed raiding parties of militia and Indian allies. Metacomet was killed by one of these teams when he was tracked down by Captain [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]] and Captain [[Josiah Standish]] of the Plymouth Colony militia at Mount Hope in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]].

The French colonies in North America were primarily interested in trade and not in creating large cities. Instead, they preferred to convert the Indian population to Catholicism, or else to limit their contact with the Indians to trade. As English presence increased on the southern coast of Maine, the French [[Jesuits]] paid many of the area's tribes for the scalps of Protestant or English settlers, especially the [[Abenaki]]. The Jesuits in charge of coordinating with the tribes were located in a small mission town near [[Norridgewock, Maine]] and led by Jesuit Father [[S\u00e9bastien Rale]]. Two other mission towns were established, one based around [[Castine, Maine]] (established by Baron de St. Castin) and one on the [[Saint Francis River (Canada\u2013United States)|St. Francis River]] between [[New Brunswick]] and Maine.\n\nThe more permanent English settlers moved northward from the colony of Massachusetts Bay, most of them Puritans who were unhappy with the political climate in Massachusetts Bay. Constant friction over many issues became the reason for many Abenaki raids in southern Maine, specifically over the issue of fishing rights for cod. Up until 1675, however, fighting had been limited to minor skirmishes that were more about the destruction of supplies than murder.\n\nWhat is thought to have been the first action in Maine came when a 25-man militia gathered at [[Falmouth, Maine]] in 1675 and sailed to an Indian village, thought to be a part of the Abenaki, with a single sloop towing [[shallops]]. The Indians drove them off and took the shallops from them. Later that month, the tribe crossed the [[Saco River]] in the captured shallops and attacked the settlement of Winter Harbor. Little damage was caused, and similar raids were conducted against [[Wells, Maine|Wells]] and Falmouth later that year. The ultimate cause leading to war was the ruling by the [[Massachusetts General Court]] in 1676 making it illegal to sell firearms, powder, or rounds to the area's tribes. New England tribes had grown dependent on the musket for hunting, and the English colonists' remaining Indian allies switched to the French side. The French encouraged them to raid the English settlements, due to the tension in Europe at the time.<ref>See [[War of the Spanish Succession]].</ref>\n\nMuch of the northern fighting was centered around raids meant to destroy property and infrastructure rather than to kill people. The lack of population on both sides meant that large battles were out of the question initially. For the majority of the war, ship combat mostly involved muskets, and the infantry relied more on melee fighting than guns. Later in the war, reinforcements from southern New England introduced modern and well-equipped ships and infantry, turning the tide permanently. This was also the first time that Colonial Rangers were used, acting as guides and scouts for the main party of militia. Much of the fighting was also conducted on the coast in small boats and ships.\n\n[[Richard Waldron]] and [[Charles Frost (military officer)|Charles Frost]] led the English colonial forces in the northern region, while [[Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin]] instructed the tribal chiefs in the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]]. Three major campaigns (one each year) were launched by the Indians in [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1675)|1675]], [[Northwest Coast Campaign (1676)|1676]], and [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1677)|1677]], most of which led to a massive colonial response. Waldron sent forces so far north that he attacked the [[Mi'kmaq]] in [[Acadia]].\n\nThroughout the campaigns, a Wabanaki leader named Mugg Hegone repeatedly attacked towns such as Black Point ([[Scarborough, Maine|Scarborough]]), Wells, and [[Damariscove Island|Damariscove]], building an Indian navy out of the approximately 40 sloops and a dozen 30-ton ships previously armed by militia. Many of Maine's towns were burned, and most of the population left. Maine's fishing industry was completely destroyed by the Wabanaki flotilla. Records from Salem, Maine reported 20 ketches stolen and destroyed in one raid. Mugg Hegone was killed on his third raid on Black Point. With their leader gone, most of the Indian flotilla broke up and was hunted down by New York privateers and Royal Navy vessels.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\">Duncan, Roger F. Coastal Maine: A Maritime History. Woodstock: Countryman, 2002. Print.</ref>\n\nColonial responses to raids generally failed in both their objectives and accomplishments. Few Indians were lost, and only two French Jesuits were reported killed. The colonists were much more successful in the later campaigns when they had the advantage in weapons. Their most successful ventures were a surprise attack near [[Dover, New Hampshire]], in which more than 150 Indians were captured, and in the defense of [[Pemaquid, Maine]] from the Indian flotilla. One of the most notorious raids was in August 1679 when Indians attacked a settlement at the [[Sheepscot River]] near [[Merrymeeting Bay]] in Maine. Sir [[William Phips]] rescued local settlers by bringing them on board his vessel, abandoning his cargo of lumber. He was financially ruined when the Indians destroyed the shipyard and his intended cargo, although he was recognized as a hero in Boston.<ref>Lounsberry, Alice (1941). ''Sir William Phips''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 23\u201326.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the war, the Northern Campaigns saw approximately 400 settlers die, Maine's fishing economy gone, and the Indians maintaining power in eastern and northern Maine. There is not an accurate account of the number of Indians who died, but it is thought to be between 100 and 300.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\"/> The official fighting ended in the northern theater with the [[Treaty of Casco (1678)]]. Skirmishes continued until [[Father Rale's War]], after which the French left Maine.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Kingphilip.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The site of King Philip's death in Miery Swamp on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)]]]]\n\n=== Southern New England ===\nThe war in southern New England largely ended with Metacomet's death.

About 2,000 Indians escaped to other tribes to the north or west; they joined continued Indian attacks from those bases well into the next century.

This is polite judicial language.

This is how many saw his trial and, in this sense, it was a political trial.\" Human rights lawyer Frank Brennan said: \"I was a law and politics student in Queensland in the 1970s when [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] was premier. This Pell saga has all the marks of the same broken-down criminal justice system.

They did not interview the men who ordinarily accompanied Pell around the Cathedral on the day of the first alleged offence in the open sacristy, and they did not interview any of the 50 witnesses present for the alleged second assault in a public corridor. Paul Kelly wrote \"The Ferguson-Maxwell majority said they found 'improbable' the idea that the complainant 'would have thought to invent a second incident if his true purpose was to advance false allegations' against Pell because this second allegation only risked the likelihood his entire position 'would unravel' when tested. In short, the sheer dubious nature of A\u2019s second complaint must be a sign of his credibility! What hope did Pell have against this logic?

This is polite judicial language.

This is how many saw his trial and, in this sense, it was a political trial.\" Human rights lawyer Frank Brennan said: \"I was a law and politics student in Queensland in the 1970s when [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] was premier. This Pell saga has all the marks of the same broken-down criminal justice system.

They did not interview the men who ordinarily accompanied Pell around the Cathedral on the day of the first alleged offence in the open sacristy, and they did not interview any of the 50 witnesses present for the alleged second assault in a public corridor. Paul Kelly wrote \"The Ferguson-Maxwell majority said they found 'improbable' the idea that the complainant 'would have thought to invent a second incident if his true purpose was to advance false allegations' against Pell because this second allegation only risked the likelihood his entire position 'would unravel' when tested. In short, the sheer dubious nature of A\u2019s second complaint must be a sign of his credibility! What hope did Pell have against this logic?

She subsequently appeared in ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'' (1998) and ''[[A Storm of Swords]]'' (2000).  Daenerys was one of a few prominent characters not included in 2005's ''[[A Feast for Crows]]'', but returned in the next novel ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'' (2011).<ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy>{{cite web |last=Brown |first=Rachael |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/07/george-r-r-martin-on-sex-fantasy-and-a-dance-with-dragons/241738/ |title=George R.R.

Knowing no other life than one of exile, she remains dependent on her abusive older brother, [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]]. She is forced to marry Dothraki horselord [[Khal Drogo]] in exchange for an army for Viserys, who wishes to return to Westeros and recapture the Iron Throne. Her brother loses the ability to control her as Daenerys finds herself adapting to life with the ''khalasar.'' Her character emerges as strong, confident and courageous. She becomes the heir of the Targaryen dynasty after her brother's murder and plans to reclaim the Iron Throne herself, seeing it as her birthright. A pregnant Daenerys loses her husband and child, but soon helps to hatch three dragons from their eggs. The dragons regard her as their mother, providing her with a tactical advantage and prestige. Over time, she struggles to maintain control of her dragons. She also acquires an army with which she conquers the cities of [[Yunkai]], [[Astapor]] and [[Meereen]], determined to end slavery and injustice there. Despite her strong moral compass, she is capable of dealing ruthlessly with her enemies, particularly the slave masters. She establishes herself as a powerful and relentless ruler.\n\nWell-received by critics and fans alike, Clarke's portrayal of Daenerys in the HBO series has garnered [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series]] in 2019 and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]] in 2013, 2015, and 2016. She has also earned many other nominations and accolades for her portrayal.\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Character description==\nDaenerys Targaryen is the daughter of King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] (also referred to as \"The Mad King\") and his sister-wife Queen Rhaella, and is one of the last survivors of [[House Targaryen]].{{Sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Chapter 3: Daenerys I}}{{Sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix}} She serves as the [[third-person limited narrative|third-person narrator]] of 31 chapters from ''A Game of Thrones'', ''A Clash of Kings'', ''A Storm of Swords'', and ''A Dance with Dragons.'' This makes her the fourth most prominent narrative voice in the series behind [[Tyrion Lannister]], [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]], and [[Arya Stark]], respectively.\n\n===Background===\nThirteen years before the events of the series (16 years in the television series), after her father and eldest brother [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] were killed during Robert's Rebellion, Daenerys was born in the midst of a great storm, earning her the nickname \"Stormborn\". Rhaella died in childbirth, and Daenerys and her older brother [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] were whisked away to [[Braavos]] by the Master of Arms of the Red Keep, Ser Willem Darry. Darry died when Daenerys was five years old, and she and Viserys spent the following years wandering the [[Free Cities (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Free Cities]].{{Sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Chapter 3: Daenerys I}} By the beginning of ''A Game of Thrones'', Daenerys and her brother have been a guest of [[Illyrio Mopatis]]' in Pentos for half a year. ''Game of Thrones'' creators [[D. B. Weiss]] and [[David Benioff]] described Daenerys as a combination of [[Joan of Arc]], [[Lawrence of Arabia]], and [[Napoleon]].<ref name=\"VF 2018-05\">{{cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/emilia-clarke-cover-story|title=Cover Story: Emilia Clarke's ''Solo'' Flight|first=Joanna|last=Robinson|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=May 23, 2018|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Appearance and personality===\nDaenerys is most often described as uncommonly beautiful, with long, pale silver-gold hair and eyes like [[amethysts]]. She is slender and pale, although taller than some of her female ancestors. Tales of Daenerys' beauty are numerous, and throughout the novels she encounters countless suitors who seek her hand in marriage, sometimes to gain control of her three dragons. She is fluent in the Common Tongue of [[Westeros]] as well as in High Valyrian and bastard Valyrian, which she speaks with a [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#Tyrosh|Tyrosh]]i accent. Over the course of the first three novels she becomes fluent in the [[Dothraki language]] as well as Ghiscari, spoken by the slave cities in [[Essos]].\n\nDaenerys grew up in constant fear of being discovered and killed by agents of the Usurper King, [[Robert Baratheon]], and was frequently abused by her older brother [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]], which led to her developing a fearful, submissive, and furtive nature. However, over the course of the narrative Daenerys comes to find her inner strength and courage and emerges as a natural leader who is adored by her people. She is often described as honorable and compassionate, if somewhat na\u00efve, although she can be harsh and vengeful against those who seek to harm her or her followers.\n\nDaenerys was first illustrated by [[Paul Youll]] on the cover of the July 1996 issue of ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'', which contained a Daenerys excerpt from ''A Game of Thrones'' entitled \"Blood of the Dragon\".\n\n=== Political leadership ===\nThe leadership of Daenerys Targaryen has been analysed and assessed using political science. Writing in ''[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]'', Professor Toby James described how her leadership in series eight shows many obvious similarities in the imagery to that seen in 1940s European fascism.<ref>{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Toby S. |title=Game of Thrones: what Machiavelli might have made of the politics in Westeros |url=https://theconversation.com/game-of-thrones-what-machiavelli-might-have-made-of-the-politics-in-westeros-117696 |website=The Conversation |publisher=The Conversation}}</ref>  The decision to raze King's Landing also showed an immoral form of leadership.  However, her broader lurch towards using fear as a way to achieve her objectives, which might themselves be morally principled, reflected the deep struggle that all political leaders face when they want to deliver both conscientious and cunning leadership.\n\n==Storylines==\n[[File:Three dragons.png|thumb|150px|alt=A coat of arms showing a red three-headed dragon on a black field over a scroll reading \"Fire and Blood.\"|Coat of arms of House Targaryen]]\n\n===''A Game of Thrones''===\nIn ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'' (1996), Daenerys is sold off by her brother [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] and [[Illyrio Mopatis]] to marry [[Khal Drogo]], a [[Dothraki]] warlord, in exchange for an army for Viserys.{{Sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Chapter 3: Daenerys I}} At that time, Daenerys befriends [[Jorah Mormont]], an exiled Westerosi knight, and is given three petrified dragon eggs as a wedding gift. Although she is initially terrified of Drogo, Daenerys' and his marriage turns out to be a happy one, and Daenerys grows to love him and to take to Dothraki customs, finding strength and determination for the first time. This leads her to stand up to Viserys' attempts to bully her into coercing Drogo. After Drogo kills Viserys by pouring molten gold over his head for threatening his wife, Daenerys sees herself as the heir to the Targaryen dynasty, and responsible for reclaiming the throne for her family. Shortly thereafter, Drogo is wounded in a fight, and the cut [[gangrene|festers]]. With Drogo ill, his warriors mutiny and abandon him. In desperation, Daenerys recruits an enslaved Lhazareen priestess, Mirri Maz Duur, to save Drogo with blood magic. However, despite being saved by Daenerys from being raped by the tribe's warriors, the priestess betrays her trust, and the magic ritual leads to Daenerys' unborn child being [[stillborn]] and leaves Drogo in a catatonic state. Daenerys does not want her husband to suffer any longer and [[euthanize]]s him with a pillow. She burns the priestess in Drogo's funeral pyre and climbs into the flames with her three dragon eggs. When the pyre dies out the following morning, Daenerys emerges alive and unburnt from the ashes with three hatched dragons.\n\n===''A Clash of Kings''===\nLeading the remnants of Drogo's khalasar through the Red Waste, Daenerys arrives in the city of [[Qarth]].  There, she begins appealing to the rulers of the city for aid in reclaiming the Iron Throne and meets little success.  She eventually accepts an invitation from a group of [[warlock]]s to discover her future.  At the warlocks' temple, the House of the Undying, Daenerys drinks a magical potion and enters the temple.\nInside, she sees several visions and manages to resist the temptations.  When she enters the final hall and meets the real Undyings, she is told prophecies about her destiny as the \"child of three\" who will experience \"three fires must you light\", \"three mounts must you ride\", and \"three treasons will you know\"; they also tell her she is the \"daughter of death\", the \"slayer of lies\", and the \"bride of fire\".  When the Undyings attack Daenerys and intend to hold her prisoner, her dragon Drogon kills them and burns down the whole temple, allowing Daenerys to escape.  Before departing Qarth, Daenerys is nearly assassinated with a venomous manticore but is saved by [[Barristan Selmy|Arstan Whitebeard]], who is sent by Illyrio Morpatis, along with the eunuch ex-gladiator called Strong Belwas and three ships to take Daenerys back to Pentos.\n\n===''A Storm of Swords''===\nSeeking an army, Daenerys sails to Astapor in [[Slaver's Bay]] to purchase an army of The Unsullied slave soldiers, in exchange for a dragon, but she betrays the slavers and uses the Unsullied to sack the city. She later conquers the city of [[Yunkai]] and gains the service of Daario Naharis, who commands a large mercenary company. As she marches on [[Meereen]], Daenerys learns that one of her companions is actually [[Barristan Selmy]], a knight of [[Robert the Usurper]]'s Kingsguard, and that Jorah had spied on her earlier. Disgusted, she sends the pair on a suicide mission to capture Meereen. When the mission is successful, Barristan asks to be forgiven for his deception, but Jorah refuses to ask forgiveness, so Daenerys banishes him. Unwilling to abandon the slaves she freed, fearing they would return to bondage, Dany decides to stay in Meereen.\n\n===''A Dance with Dragons''===\nThroughout ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'' (2011), Daenerys struggles to maintain order in the city in the face of growing unrest as well as the chaos she left behind in the other cities she conquered. Furthermore, Yunkai has rebelled and is gathering forces to besiege Meereen. When Drogon kills a child, Daenerys feels compelled to chain her dragons Rhaegal and Viserion, but Drogon escapes. Her advisers suggest she marry [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]] to bring peace, and she agrees, although she takes Daario as a lover. Hizdahr successfully negotiates an end to the violence, so she marries him. At her wedding feast, the blood and noise of the fighting pits attract Drogon, who is immediately attacked. Daenerys's attempt to control her dragon fails initially, but she eventually flies off with him. After several days in Drogon's lair, she falls ill after eating some berries and begins to hallucinate. She is later found by Khal Jhaqo, formerly a captain of her Khalasar who betrayed her late husband.\n\n===Family tree of House Targaryen===\n{{Family tree of Maekar Targaryen}}\n\n== TV adaptation ==\n\n===Casting and development===\n[[File:Game of Thrones Oslo exhibition 2014 - Daenerys's blue dress.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A blue, scale-covered dress worn by Daenerys in the TV series ''Game of Thrones'']]\nMartin said that the character was aged in the television series because of child pornography regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2011/07/12/george-martin-talks-a-dance-with-dragons/|title=''A Dance With Dragons'' Interview|date=July 12, 2011|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}</ref> [[Tamzin Merchant]] played Daenerys in the original pilot, but the first episode was re-shot with [[Emilia Clarke]] in the role.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2010/04/game-of-thrones-george-r-r-martin.html | work=Chicago Tribune|title=George R.

She and her brother Viserys were smuggled to Essos during the end of Robert's Rebellion. For most of her life, she has been under the care of Viserys, whom she fears, as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him. Viserys marries Daenerys to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo in exchange for his military support in an invasion of Westeros, making Daenerys a Khaleesi, a queen of the Dothraki. During the wedding, exiled knight Ser Jorah Mormont pledges his loyalty to Daenerys, and her benefactor Illyrio Mopatis gifts her three petrified dragon eggs. Daenerys is initially afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language, she begins to understand Drogo and genuinely falls in love with him upon getting to know him. She learns the ways of the Dothraki, strengthening her relationship with her khalasar. She later becomes pregnant with her son by Drogo, who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the \"Stallion Who Mounts the World\". Viserys grows jealous of Daenerys's popularity and becomes infuriated with Drogo's lack of urgency in launching an invasion, prompting him to threaten to cut Daenerys's unborn son from her womb. Drogo responds by killing Viserys with molten gold, to which Daenerys declares that he was no dragon, because fire cannot kill a dragon.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful assassination attempt on behalf of Robert Baratheon, Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son. However, during their journey, Drogo becomes comatose due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with one of his men. Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic. Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo but leave him in a permanent catatonic state, forcing Daenerys to end her husband's life. Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her tied to Drogo's funeral pyre. She also lays the three dragon eggs onto Drogo's body and steps into the fire herself. At daybreak, after the fire is burned down, Daenerys emerges with three baby dragons, whom she names Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\nDaenerys and the remnants of Drogo's khalasar wander the Red Waste before being accepted into the city of Qarth. She is hosted by merchant Xaro Xhoan Daxos, a member of Qarth's ruling council the Thirteen. Daenerys tries to appeal to the Thirteen to support her invasion of Westeros, without success. She returns to Xaro's manse to find half of her men and servants killed and her dragons gone. Meeting with the Thirteen again to ask for their help in retrieving her dragons, the warlock Pyat Pree claims responsibility and declares that her dragons are being kept in his temple, the House of the Undying. Daenerys travels to the temple, but Pree's magic separates her from Jorah and leaves her chained with her dragon. Daenerys orders her dragons to immolate Pree. Daenerys then confronts Xaro, who had conspired with Pree and Daenerys's servant Doreah to seize control of Qarth. Daenerys has Xaro and Doreah sealed in Xaro's vault and has her remaining loyalists raid his manse, using the funds to buy a ship.\n\n====Season 3====\nDaenerys travels to Astapor, a city in Slaver's Bay. As she arrives, the warlocks of Qarth attempt to assassinate her, but are thwarted by Ser Barristan Selmy, who was Kingsguard to Aerys Targaryen; Daenerys accepts him into her service. Daenerys negotiates with Astapori slaver Kraznys mo Nakloz to purchase an army of Unsullied, elite eunuch soldiers, in exchange for Drogon, also obtaining the services of Kraznys's translator Missandei. Upon the completion of the transaction, she has Drogon burn Kraznys alive and orders the Unsullied to sack the city, kill Astapor's masters and free its slaves. Daenerys and her army march on the neighbouring slave city of Yunkai, who hire the sellsword company the Second Sons to defend the city. The commanders of the Second Sons order their lieutenant, Daario Naharis, to kill Daenerys; however, he is smitten by her beauty and instead brings her the heads of his superiors, pledging the Second Sons' allegiance. Daario, Jorah, and the Unsullied commander Grey Worm infiltrate Yunkai, opening the gates for the Targaryen army to conquer the city. Daenerys is received by Yunkai's freed slaves, who hail her as their \"mhysa\" (mother).\n\n====Season 4====\nDaenerys marches on the last city in Slaver's Bay, Meereen, and seizes control of the city by instigating a slave revolt. She decides to execute 163 Meereenese masters as \"justice\" for 163 slave children crucified on the road to Meereen. After becoming aware that her council in Astapor has been overthrown and that Yunkai has reverted to slavery, Daenerys decides to stay in Meereen to practice ruling. She also begins a sexual relationship with Daario. After discovering that Jorah was previously spying on her on House Baratheon's behalf, she is enraged and orders him exiled from the city. Daenerys is later horrified to discover that Drogon has killed a farmer's child; although Drogon is unable to be captured, she has Rhaegal and Viserion locked up in Meereen's catacombs.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\nDaenerys faces a new threat to her rule in the form of the Sons of the Harpy, a resistance movement made of agitated former masters. Her popularity with the freedmen also begins to wane after she publicly executes one of her councillors, Mossador, for killing a captive Son. After the Sons kill Ser Barristan, Daenerys decides that she will attempt to restore peace by reopening Meereen's fighting pits and taking the Meereenese noble Hizdhar zo Loraq as her husband. While attending a gladiator demonstration, she is confronted by Jorah, who has brought her the fugitive [[Tyrion Lannister]] to appease her. Daenerys accepts Tyrion onto her council, but orders Jorah exiled again. At the reopening of the fighting pits, Jorah saves Daenerys's life by killing a Son of the Harpy trying to assassinate her. The Sons then launch a massive attack, killing Hizdhar and many other Meereenese noblemen and freedmen. As the Sons corner Daenerys and her councillors, Drogon appears and kills or scares off most of the Sons. The Unsullied begin to overwhelm the Sons and the Sons throw spears at Drogon, prompting Daenerys to fly away on Drogon. Drogon eventually leaves her in the Dothraki Sea, where she is captured by a khalasar.\n\n====Season 6====\nDaenerys is taken to Khal Moro, the leader of the Dothraki horde. Learning that she is the widow of Khal Drogo, Moro tells her she must live out her days among the widows of the Dosh Khaleen in Vaes Dothrak. Once there, Daenerys is told that she is to be judged by the khals for defying tradition and going out into the world following Drogo's death. During the meeting with the khals, Daenerys declares that only she has enough ambition to lead the Dothraki; when the outraged khals threaten to gang-rape her, Daenerys sets fire to the temple, killing everyone inside but emerging unscathed. Awed, the Dothraki accept her as their Khaleesi. After discovering that Jorah, who had followed her to Vaes Dothrak with Daario, is infected with the terminal disease greyscale, Daenerys orders him to find a cure and return to her services, before marching on Meereen with Drogon, Daario, and the Dothraki.\n\nDaenerys returns to Meereen to find it under siege by the joint fleets of Yunkai, Astapor, and Volantis, who have reneged on an agreement with Tyrion to free their slaves and are trying to reclaim the city. Daenerys deploys all three of her dragons, burning most of the slaver fleet and seizing the ships that survive. The slavers agree to surrender. Soon after, Theon and Yara Greyjoy arrive to offer the Iron Fleet in exchange for Daenerys giving the Iron Islands their independence and installing Yara as queen of the Iron Islands over their uncle [[Euron Greyjoy]], who had been planning to marry Daenerys. Daenerys agrees to Theon and Yara's alliance. [[Varys]], meanwhile, secures the support of [[Ellaria Sand]] and [[Olenna Tyrell]], who have lost family members to the Lannisters and want vengeance. Daenerys leaves Daario and the Second Sons in Meereen to keep the peace, names Tyrion Lannister as Hand of the Queen, and sets sail for Westeros at last.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/27/game-of-thrones-the-winds-of-winter-review |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/27/game-of-thrones-the-winds-of-winter-review |title=Game of Thrones: \"The Winds of Winter\" Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=March 30, 2017 |date=June 27, 2016 |last=Fowler |first=Matt|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Season 7====\nDaenerys arrives at the island fortress of [[Dragonstone (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Dragonstone]], the ancient Targaryen stronghold once held by the late Stannis Baratheon, and finds it abandoned. She sends the Unsullied to take Casterly Rock, and [[Yara Greyjoy]]'s fleet, along with ships from Dorne, to blockade King's Landing. The Lannister forces, however, have left Casterly Rock and seized Highgarden and its wealth, and Euron overcomes his niece Yara's ships. In an effort to gain allies, Daenerys summons the newly named King in the North, [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]], to pledge his fealty to her. Jon refuses, insisting that the [[White Walker]]s and their [[wight]] army present a threat to all of humanity. Receiving word of Highgarden's fall, Daenerys leads Drogon and the Dothraki to decimate the Lannister caravan. Drogon is injured by a [[ballista]] designed specifically to wound dragons, but Daenerys is victorious. The remaining forces submit to her after she commands the dragon to roast a resistant [[Randyll Tarly|Randyll]] and [[Dickon Tarly]] alive.\n\nJon and a cured Jorah lead an expedition beyond [[the Wall (A Song of Ice and Fire)|the Wall]] to capture a wight, which they will use to convince [[Cersei Lannister]], the self-declared Queen of Westeros, that the threat is real. They are saved from the army of the dead by Daenerys and her dragons, but the [[Night King]] kills Viserion with an ice spear, devastating Daenerys. Daenerys vows to Jon that she will help fight the White Walkers, and Jon pledges allegiance to her as his queen. The pair and their retainers bring a wight to King's Landing to convince Cersei of the threat beyond the Wall. Cersei ultimately agrees to a truce and to aid in the fight against the undead army, while secretly plotting to betray them. Jon and Daenerys finally succumb to their growing feelings for each other, falling in love, and have sex. Neither of them is aware they are related by blood or that the Night King has revived Viserion as a wight, and the Night King breaches the Wall with dragonfire.\n\n====Season 8====\nDaenerys and Jon arrive at Winterfell along with the Unsullied, Dothraki, Drogon, and Rhaegal. [[Bran Stark]] reveals to Daenerys that the Night King has resurrected Viserion and that the Wall has fallen. The Northerners are angry that Jon has pledged his allegiance to Daenerys and [[Sansa Stark]] questions how they will feed her armies and dragons. Daenerys and Jon's bond continues to grow when they later ride her dragons. [[Jaime Lannister]] arrives and reveals that Cersei has lied about sending her army to aid them against the White Walkers. Daenerys opts to execute Jaime for killing her father, but is overruled by Sansa and Jon after [[Brienne of Tarth]] vouches for him. Jon learns the truth of his parentage and reveals to a stunned Daenerys that he is the son of her brother Rhaegar and [[Lyanna Stark]]. Daenerys realizes that this makes Jon the true heir to House Targaryen but they are interrupted by the arrival of the White Walkers. \n\nRiding Drogon and Rhaegal, Daenerys and Jon await the Night King's arrival, but the Dothraki are quickly overrun by the dead and Daenerys abandons their position to strafe the onslaught of wights. In the resulting battle, Drogon is attacked by wights and Daenerys is dismounted. Jorah arrives to protect her from the dead and Daenerys uses a discarded dragonglass blade to defend herself until the Night King is destroyed by [[Arya Stark]]. However, Jorah is mortally wounded and dies in Daenerys' arms as she cries. After the battle, Daenerys fears people may prefer Jon as king over her when he receives praise from the wildlings. She begs Jon to not reveal his true parentage but he tells her he must tell his sisters. Jon swears Sansa and Arya to secrecy, having renounced his claim for Daenerys', but Sansa tells Tyrion, who in turn tells Varys.\n\nDaenerys flies to Dragonstone with her naval fleet in tow, while Jon marches south with her armies. She is ambushed by Euron Greyjoy and his Iron Fleet, who kill Rhaegal, destroy Daenerys' fleet, and take Missandei captive. Daenerys and her advisors travel to King's Landing to negotiate Cersei's surrender and Missandei's release, but Cersei has [[Gregor Clegane]] behead Missandei in front of Daenerys. Tyrion reveals to Daenerys that Varys is trying to seat Jon on the Iron Throne, and she executes Varys via dragonfire for his treachery. Alone with Jon later, Daenerys attempts to kiss him but he pulls away due to their blood relation. Daenerys resigns herself to relying on fear to assert herself.\n\nAs Daenerys' army makes camp, Jaime is spotted trying to infiltrate King's Landing and imprisoned, but Tyrion defies Daenerys to release him and have him rescue Cersei. Before the battle, Tyrion pleads with Daenerys to spare the inhabitants of King's Landing if they ring the bells to declare surrender. When Daenerys burns the Iron Fleet and the city's defenses, the Lannister soldiers and city surrender, but Daenerys proceeds to burn down much of King's Landing, killing countless civilians. Cersei and Jaime are also killed when the Red Keep collapses on them. Addressing her army in the aftermath, Daenerys declares that she will use her might to \"liberate\" the entire world. She accuses Tyrion of treason for releasing his brother and has him arrested when he publicly resigns as hand. Arya and Tyrion warn Jon that Daenerys will view his Targaryen heritage as a threat to her rule while Tyrion warns that Jon's sisters will not bend the knee to her now. Tyrion tells Jon that despite Jon's feelings for Daenerys, it is his duty to kill her for being the people's greatest threat. Jon attempts to reason with Daenerys, but when she continues to assert that her actions are necessary to establish a good world, a conflicted Jon fatally stabs her. She dies in his arms as he weeps. Drogon arrives shortly after and melts the Iron Throne before departing Westeros with Daenerys' body, grieving.\n\nBran Stark is later elected king; he sends Jon back to the Night's Watch to appease Daenerys' supporters.\n\n== Reception ==\n===General===\n[[File:Emilia Clarke by Gage Skidmore 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Emilia Clarke]] was relatively unknown before her role as Daenerys in ''Game of Thrones''.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\" />]]\nDaenerys is one of the most popular characters of the book series, together with [[Tyrion Lannister]] and [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]].<ref name=\"NYT Dance 2011-07\" /> ''[[The New York Times]]'' called Daenerys one of Martin's \"finest creations\".<ref name=\"NYT 2011-08\"/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked her No. 1 on a list of \"Top 40 ''Game of Thrones'' Characters\", calling her story a \"non-stop confrontation with complex ideas about sex, war, gender, race, politics and morality\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\">{{cite news|title=Top 40 ''Game of Thrones'' Characters, Ranked|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/top-40-game-of-thrones-characters-ranked-20140331|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|accessdate=September 24, 2014|date=March 31, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927113520/http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/top-40-game-of-thrones-characters-ranked-20140331|archive-date=September 27, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Matthew Gilbert of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called her scenes \"mesmerizing\".<ref name=\"John W.

Did we really think somebody who crucified 163 people because she assumed they were all responsible for killing slaves was a good person?\" Acknowledging that the show had perhaps been \"a bit tricky in playing her murderous moments as heroic\" and that the turn was therefore shocking, he said that Daenerys always chose extreme violence when very upset.

She is one of the most popular characters in the series, and ''[[The New York Times]]'' cites her as one of the author's finest creations.<ref name=\"NYT 2011-08\">{{cite web |last=Orr |first=David |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/books/review/george-r-r-martin-and-the-rise-of-fantasy.html |title=Dragons Ascendant: George R.

She subsequently appeared in ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'' (1998) and ''[[A Storm of Swords]]'' (2000).  Daenerys was one of a few prominent characters not included in 2005's ''[[A Feast for Crows]]'', but returned in the next novel ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'' (2011).<ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy>{{cite web |last=Brown |first=Rachael |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/07/george-r-r-martin-on-sex-fantasy-and-a-dance-with-dragons/241738/ |title=George R.R.

Knowing no other life than one of exile, she remains dependent on her abusive older brother, [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]]. She is forced to marry Dothraki horselord [[Khal Drogo]] in exchange for an army for Viserys, who wishes to return to Westeros and recapture the Iron Throne. Her brother loses the ability to control her as Daenerys finds herself adapting to life with the ''khalasar.'' Her character emerges as strong, confident and courageous. She becomes the heir of the Targaryen dynasty after her brother's murder and plans to reclaim the Iron Throne herself, seeing it as her birthright. A pregnant Daenerys loses her husband and child, but soon helps to hatch three dragons from their eggs. The dragons regard her as their mother, providing her with a tactical advantage and prestige. Over time, she struggles to maintain control of her dragons. She also acquires an army with which she conquers the cities of [[Yunkai]], [[Astapor]] and [[Meereen]], determined to end slavery and injustice there. Despite her strong moral compass, she is capable of dealing ruthlessly with her enemies, particularly the slave masters. She establishes herself as a powerful and relentless ruler.\n\nWell-received by critics and fans alike, Clarke's portrayal of Daenerys in the HBO series has garnered [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series]] in 2019 and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]] in 2013, 2015, and 2016. She has also earned many other nominations and accolades for her portrayal.\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Character description==\nDaenerys Targaryen is the daughter of King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] (also referred to as \"The Mad King\") and his sister-wife Queen Rhaella, and is one of the last survivors of [[House Targaryen]].{{Sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Chapter 3: Daenerys I}}{{Sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix}} She serves as the [[third-person limited narrative|third-person narrator]] of 31 chapters from ''A Game of Thrones'', ''A Clash of Kings'', ''A Storm of Swords'', and ''A Dance with Dragons.'' This makes her the fourth most prominent narrative voice in the series behind [[Tyrion Lannister]], [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]], and [[Arya Stark]], respectively.\n\n===Background===\nThirteen years before the events of the series (16 years in the television series), after her father and eldest brother [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] were killed during Robert's Rebellion, Daenerys was born in the midst of a great storm, earning her the nickname \"Stormborn\". Rhaella died in childbirth, and Daenerys and her older brother [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] were whisked away to [[Braavos]] by the Master of Arms of the Red Keep, Ser Willem Darry. Darry died when Daenerys was five years old, and she and Viserys spent the following years wandering the [[Free Cities (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Free Cities]].{{Sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Chapter 3: Daenerys I}} By the beginning of ''A Game of Thrones'', Daenerys and her brother have been a guest of [[Illyrio Mopatis]]' in Pentos for half a year. ''Game of Thrones'' creators [[D. B. Weiss]] and [[David Benioff]] described Daenerys as a combination of [[Joan of Arc]], [[Lawrence of Arabia]], and [[Napoleon]].<ref name=\"VF 2018-05\">{{cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/emilia-clarke-cover-story|title=Cover Story: Emilia Clarke's ''Solo'' Flight|first=Joanna|last=Robinson|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=May 23, 2018|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Appearance and personality===\nDaenerys is most often described as uncommonly beautiful, with long, pale silver-gold hair and eyes like [[amethysts]]. She is slender and pale, although taller than some of her female ancestors. Tales of Daenerys' beauty are numerous, and throughout the novels she encounters countless suitors who seek her hand in marriage, sometimes to gain control of her three dragons. She is fluent in the Common Tongue of [[Westeros]] as well as in High Valyrian and bastard Valyrian, which she speaks with a [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#Tyrosh|Tyrosh]]i accent. Over the course of the first three novels she becomes fluent in the [[Dothraki language]] as well as Ghiscari, spoken by the slave cities in [[Essos]].\n\nDaenerys grew up in constant fear of being discovered and killed by agents of the Usurper King, [[Robert Baratheon]], and was frequently abused by her older brother [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]], which led to her developing a fearful, submissive, and furtive nature. However, over the course of the narrative Daenerys comes to find her inner strength and courage and emerges as a natural leader who is adored by her people. She is often described as honorable and compassionate, if somewhat na\u00efve, although she can be harsh and vengeful against those who seek to harm her or her followers.\n\nDaenerys was first illustrated by [[Paul Youll]] on the cover of the July 1996 issue of ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'', which contained a Daenerys excerpt from ''A Game of Thrones'' entitled \"Blood of the Dragon\".\n\n=== Political leadership ===\nThe leadership of Daenerys Targaryen has been analysed and assessed using political science. Writing in ''[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]'', Professor Toby James described how her leadership in series eight shows many obvious similarities in the imagery to that seen in 1940s European fascism.<ref>{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Toby S. |title=Game of Thrones: what Machiavelli might have made of the politics in Westeros |url=https://theconversation.com/game-of-thrones-what-machiavelli-might-have-made-of-the-politics-in-westeros-117696 |website=The Conversation |publisher=The Conversation}}</ref>  The decision to raze King's Landing also showed an immoral form of leadership.  However, her broader lurch towards using fear as a way to achieve her objectives, which might themselves be morally principled, reflected the deep struggle that all political leaders face when they want to deliver both conscientious and cunning leadership.\n\n==Storylines==\n[[File:Three dragons.png|thumb|150px|alt=A coat of arms showing a red three-headed dragon on a black field over a scroll reading \"Fire and Blood.\"|Coat of arms of House Targaryen]]\n\n===''A Game of Thrones''===\nIn ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'' (1996), Daenerys is sold off by her brother [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] and [[Illyrio Mopatis]] to marry [[Khal Drogo]], a [[Dothraki]] warlord, in exchange for an army for Viserys.{{Sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Chapter 3: Daenerys I}} At that time, Daenerys befriends [[Jorah Mormont]], an exiled Westerosi knight, and is given three petrified dragon eggs as a wedding gift. Although she is initially terrified of Drogo, Daenerys' and his marriage turns out to be a happy one, and Daenerys grows to love him and to take to Dothraki customs, finding strength and determination for the first time. This leads her to stand up to Viserys' attempts to bully her into coercing Drogo. After Drogo kills Viserys by pouring molten gold over his head for threatening his wife, Daenerys sees herself as the heir to the Targaryen dynasty, and responsible for reclaiming the throne for her family. Shortly thereafter, Drogo is wounded in a fight, and the cut [[gangrene|festers]]. With Drogo ill, his warriors mutiny and abandon him. In desperation, Daenerys recruits an enslaved Lhazareen priestess, Mirri Maz Duur, to save Drogo with blood magic. However, despite being saved by Daenerys from being raped by the tribe's warriors, the priestess betrays her trust, and the magic ritual leads to Daenerys' unborn child being [[stillborn]] and leaves Drogo in a catatonic state. Daenerys does not want her husband to suffer any longer and [[euthanize]]s him with a pillow. She burns the priestess in Drogo's funeral pyre and climbs into the flames with her three dragon eggs. When the pyre dies out the following morning, Daenerys emerges alive and unburnt from the ashes with three hatched dragons.\n\n===''A Clash of Kings''===\nLeading the remnants of Drogo's khalasar through the Red Waste, Daenerys arrives in the city of [[Qarth]].  There, she begins appealing to the rulers of the city for aid in reclaiming the Iron Throne and meets little success.  She eventually accepts an invitation from a group of [[warlock]]s to discover her future.  At the warlocks' temple, the House of the Undying, Daenerys drinks a magical potion and enters the temple.\nInside, she sees several visions and manages to resist the temptations.  When she enters the final hall and meets the real Undyings, she is told prophecies about her destiny as the \"child of three\" who will experience \"three fires must you light\", \"three mounts must you ride\", and \"three treasons will you know\"; they also tell her she is the \"daughter of death\", the \"slayer of lies\", and the \"bride of fire\".  When the Undyings attack Daenerys and intend to hold her prisoner, her dragon Drogon kills them and burns down the whole temple, allowing Daenerys to escape.  Before departing Qarth, Daenerys is nearly assassinated with a venomous manticore but is saved by [[Barristan Selmy|Arstan Whitebeard]], who is sent by Illyrio Morpatis, along with the eunuch ex-gladiator called Strong Belwas and three ships to take Daenerys back to Pentos.\n\n===''A Storm of Swords''===\nSeeking an army, Daenerys sails to Astapor in [[Slaver's Bay]] to purchase an army of The Unsullied slave soldiers, in exchange for a dragon, but she betrays the slavers and uses the Unsullied to sack the city. She later conquers the city of [[Yunkai]] and gains the service of Daario Naharis, who commands a large mercenary company. As she marches on [[Meereen]], Daenerys learns that one of her companions is actually [[Barristan Selmy]], a knight of [[Robert the Usurper]]'s Kingsguard, and that Jorah had spied on her earlier. Disgusted, she sends the pair on a suicide mission to capture Meereen. When the mission is successful, Barristan asks to be forgiven for his deception, but Jorah refuses to ask forgiveness, so Daenerys banishes him. Unwilling to abandon the slaves she freed, fearing they would return to bondage, Dany decides to stay in Meereen.\n\n===''A Dance with Dragons''===\nThroughout ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'' (2011), Daenerys struggles to maintain order in the city in the face of growing unrest as well as the chaos she left behind in the other cities she conquered. Furthermore, Yunkai has rebelled and is gathering forces to besiege Meereen. When Drogon kills a child, Daenerys feels compelled to chain her dragons Rhaegal and Viserion, but Drogon escapes. Her advisers suggest she marry [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]] to bring peace, and she agrees, although she takes Daario as a lover. Hizdahr successfully negotiates an end to the violence, so she marries him. At her wedding feast, the blood and noise of the fighting pits attract Drogon, who is immediately attacked. Daenerys's attempt to control her dragon fails initially, but she eventually flies off with him. After several days in Drogon's lair, she falls ill after eating some berries and begins to hallucinate. She is later found by Khal Jhaqo, formerly a captain of her Khalasar who betrayed her late husband.\n\n===Family tree of House Targaryen===\n{{Family tree of Maekar Targaryen}}\n\n== TV adaptation ==\n\n===Casting and development===\n[[File:Game of Thrones Oslo exhibition 2014 - Daenerys's blue dress.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A blue, scale-covered dress worn by Daenerys in the TV series ''Game of Thrones'']]\nMartin said that the character was aged in the television series because of child pornography regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2011/07/12/george-martin-talks-a-dance-with-dragons/|title=''A Dance With Dragons'' Interview|date=July 12, 2011|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}</ref> [[Tamzin Merchant]] played Daenerys in the original pilot, but the first episode was re-shot with [[Emilia Clarke]] in the role.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2010/04/game-of-thrones-george-r-r-martin.html | work=Chicago Tribune|title=George R.

She and her brother Viserys were smuggled to Essos during the end of Robert's Rebellion. For most of her life, she has been under the care of Viserys, whom she fears, as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him. Viserys marries Daenerys to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo in exchange for his military support in an invasion of Westeros, making Daenerys a Khaleesi, a queen of the Dothraki. During the wedding, exiled knight Ser Jorah Mormont pledges his loyalty to Daenerys, and her benefactor Illyrio Mopatis gifts her three petrified dragon eggs. Daenerys is initially afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language, she begins to understand Drogo and genuinely falls in love with him upon getting to know him. She learns the ways of the Dothraki, strengthening her relationship with her khalasar. She later becomes pregnant with her son by Drogo, who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the \"Stallion Who Mounts the World\". Viserys grows jealous of Daenerys's popularity and becomes infuriated with Drogo's lack of urgency in launching an invasion, prompting him to threaten to cut Daenerys's unborn son from her womb. Drogo responds by killing Viserys with molten gold, to which Daenerys declares that he was no dragon, because fire cannot kill a dragon.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful assassination attempt on behalf of Robert Baratheon, Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son. However, during their journey, Drogo becomes comatose due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with one of his men. Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic. Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo but leave him in a permanent catatonic state, forcing Daenerys to end her husband's life. Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her tied to Drogo's funeral pyre. She also lays the three dragon eggs onto Drogo's body and steps into the fire herself. At daybreak, after the fire is burned down, Daenerys emerges with three baby dragons, whom she names Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\nDaenerys and the remnants of Drogo's khalasar wander the Red Waste before being accepted into the city of Qarth. She is hosted by merchant Xaro Xhoan Daxos, a member of Qarth's ruling council the Thirteen. Daenerys tries to appeal to the Thirteen to support her invasion of Westeros, without success. She returns to Xaro's manse to find half of her men and servants killed and her dragons gone. Meeting with the Thirteen again to ask for their help in retrieving her dragons, the warlock Pyat Pree claims responsibility and declares that her dragons are being kept in his temple, the House of the Undying. Daenerys travels to the temple, but Pree's magic separates her from Jorah and leaves her chained with her dragon. Daenerys orders her dragons to immolate Pree. Daenerys then confronts Xaro, who had conspired with Pree and Daenerys's servant Doreah to seize control of Qarth. Daenerys has Xaro and Doreah sealed in Xaro's vault and has her remaining loyalists raid his manse, using the funds to buy a ship.\n\n====Season 3====\nDaenerys travels to Astapor, a city in Slaver's Bay. As she arrives, the warlocks of Qarth attempt to assassinate her, but are thwarted by Ser Barristan Selmy, who was Kingsguard to Aerys Targaryen; Daenerys accepts him into her service. Daenerys negotiates with Astapori slaver Kraznys mo Nakloz to purchase an army of Unsullied, elite eunuch soldiers, in exchange for Drogon, also obtaining the services of Kraznys's translator Missandei. Upon the completion of the transaction, she has Drogon burn Kraznys alive and orders the Unsullied to sack the city, kill Astapor's masters and free its slaves. Daenerys and her army march on the neighbouring slave city of Yunkai, who hire the sellsword company the Second Sons to defend the city. The commanders of the Second Sons order their lieutenant, Daario Naharis, to kill Daenerys; however, he is smitten by her beauty and instead brings her the heads of his superiors, pledging the Second Sons' allegiance. Daario, Jorah, and the Unsullied commander Grey Worm infiltrate Yunkai, opening the gates for the Targaryen army to conquer the city. Daenerys is received by Yunkai's freed slaves, who hail her as their \"mhysa\" (mother).\n\n====Season 4====\nDaenerys marches on the last city in Slaver's Bay, Meereen, and seizes control of the city by instigating a slave revolt. She decides to execute 163 Meereenese masters as \"justice\" for 163 slave children crucified on the road to Meereen. After becoming aware that her council in Astapor has been overthrown and that Yunkai has reverted to slavery, Daenerys decides to stay in Meereen to practice ruling. She also begins a sexual relationship with Daario. After discovering that Jorah was previously spying on her on House Baratheon's behalf, she is enraged and orders him exiled from the city. Daenerys is later horrified to discover that Drogon has killed a farmer's child; although Drogon is unable to be captured, she has Rhaegal and Viserion locked up in Meereen's catacombs.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\nDaenerys faces a new threat to her rule in the form of the Sons of the Harpy, a resistance movement made of agitated former masters. Her popularity with the freedmen also begins to wane after she publicly executes one of her councillors, Mossador, for killing a captive Son. After the Sons kill Ser Barristan, Daenerys decides that she will attempt to restore peace by reopening Meereen's fighting pits and taking the Meereenese noble Hizdhar zo Loraq as her husband. While attending a gladiator demonstration, she is confronted by Jorah, who has brought her the fugitive [[Tyrion Lannister]] to appease her. Daenerys accepts Tyrion onto her council, but orders Jorah exiled again. At the reopening of the fighting pits, Jorah saves Daenerys's life by killing a Son of the Harpy trying to assassinate her. The Sons then launch a massive attack, killing Hizdhar and many other Meereenese noblemen and freedmen. As the Sons corner Daenerys and her councillors, Drogon appears and kills or scares off most of the Sons. The Unsullied begin to overwhelm the Sons and the Sons throw spears at Drogon, prompting Daenerys to fly away on Drogon. Drogon eventually leaves her in the Dothraki Sea, where she is captured by a khalasar.\n\n====Season 6====\nDaenerys is taken to Khal Moro, the leader of the Dothraki horde. Learning that she is the widow of Khal Drogo, Moro tells her she must live out her days among the widows of the Dosh Khaleen in Vaes Dothrak. Once there, Daenerys is told that she is to be judged by the khals for defying tradition and going out into the world following Drogo's death. During the meeting with the khals, Daenerys declares that only she has enough ambition to lead the Dothraki; when the outraged khals threaten to gang-rape her, Daenerys sets fire to the temple, killing everyone inside but emerging unscathed. Awed, the Dothraki accept her as their Khaleesi. After discovering that Jorah, who had followed her to Vaes Dothrak with Daario, is infected with the terminal disease greyscale, Daenerys orders him to find a cure and return to her services, before marching on Meereen with Drogon, Daario, and the Dothraki.\n\nDaenerys returns to Meereen to find it under siege by the joint fleets of Yunkai, Astapor, and Volantis, who have reneged on an agreement with Tyrion to free their slaves and are trying to reclaim the city. Daenerys deploys all three of her dragons, burning most of the slaver fleet and seizing the ships that survive. The slavers agree to surrender. Soon after, Theon and Yara Greyjoy arrive to offer the Iron Fleet in exchange for Daenerys giving the Iron Islands their independence and installing Yara as queen of the Iron Islands over their uncle [[Euron Greyjoy]], who had been planning to marry Daenerys. Daenerys agrees to Theon and Yara's alliance. [[Varys]], meanwhile, secures the support of [[Ellaria Sand]] and [[Olenna Tyrell]], who have lost family members to the Lannisters and want vengeance. Daenerys leaves Daario and the Second Sons in Meereen to keep the peace, names Tyrion Lannister as Hand of the Queen, and sets sail for Westeros at last.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/27/game-of-thrones-the-winds-of-winter-review |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/27/game-of-thrones-the-winds-of-winter-review |title=Game of Thrones: \"The Winds of Winter\" Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=March 30, 2017 |date=June 27, 2016 |last=Fowler |first=Matt|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Season 7====\nDaenerys arrives at the island fortress of [[Dragonstone (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Dragonstone]], the ancient Targaryen stronghold once held by the late Stannis Baratheon, and finds it abandoned. She sends the Unsullied to take Casterly Rock, and [[Yara Greyjoy]]'s fleet, along with ships from Dorne, to blockade King's Landing. The Lannister forces, however, have left Casterly Rock and seized Highgarden and its wealth, and Euron overcomes his niece Yara's ships. In an effort to gain allies, Daenerys summons the newly named King in the North, [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]], to pledge his fealty to her. Jon refuses, insisting that the [[White Walker]]s and their [[wight]] army present a threat to all of humanity. Receiving word of Highgarden's fall, Daenerys leads Drogon and the Dothraki to decimate the Lannister caravan. Drogon is injured by a [[ballista]] designed specifically to wound dragons, but Daenerys is victorious. The remaining forces submit to her after she commands the dragon to roast a resistant [[Randyll Tarly|Randyll]] and [[Dickon Tarly]] alive.\n\nJon and a cured Jorah lead an expedition beyond [[the Wall (A Song of Ice and Fire)|the Wall]] to capture a wight, which they will use to convince [[Cersei Lannister]], the self-declared Queen of Westeros, that the threat is real. They are saved from the army of the dead by Daenerys and her dragons, but the [[Night King]] kills Viserion with an ice spear, devastating Daenerys. Daenerys vows to Jon that she will help fight the White Walkers, and Jon pledges allegiance to her as his queen. The pair and their retainers bring a wight to King's Landing to convince Cersei of the threat beyond the Wall. Cersei ultimately agrees to a truce and to aid in the fight against the undead army, while secretly plotting to betray them. Jon and Daenerys finally succumb to their growing feelings for each other, falling in love, and have sex. Neither of them is aware they are related by blood or that the Night King has revived Viserion as a wight, and the Night King breaches the Wall with dragonfire.\n\n====Season 8====\nDaenerys and Jon arrive at Winterfell along with the Unsullied, Dothraki, Drogon, and Rhaegal. [[Bran Stark]] reveals to Daenerys that the Night King has resurrected Viserion and that the Wall has fallen. The Northerners are angry that Jon has pledged his allegiance to Daenerys and [[Sansa Stark]] questions how they will feed her armies and dragons. Daenerys and Jon's bond continues to grow when they later ride her dragons. [[Jaime Lannister]] arrives and reveals that Cersei has lied about sending her army to aid them against the White Walkers. Daenerys opts to execute Jaime for killing her father, but is overruled by Sansa and Jon after [[Brienne of Tarth]] vouches for him. Jon learns the truth of his parentage and reveals to a stunned Daenerys that he is the son of her brother Rhaegar and [[Lyanna Stark]]. Daenerys realizes that this makes Jon the true heir to House Targaryen but they are interrupted by the arrival of the White Walkers. \n\nRiding Drogon and Rhaegal, Daenerys and Jon await the Night King's arrival, but the Dothraki are quickly overrun by the dead and Daenerys abandons their position to strafe the onslaught of wights. In the resulting battle, Drogon is attacked by wights and Daenerys is dismounted. Jorah arrives to protect her from the dead and Daenerys uses a discarded dragonglass blade to defend herself until the Night King is destroyed by [[Arya Stark]]. However, Jorah is mortally wounded and dies in Daenerys' arms as she cries. After the battle, Daenerys fears people may prefer Jon as king over her when he receives praise from the wildlings. She begs Jon to not reveal his true parentage but he tells her he must tell his sisters. Jon swears Sansa and Arya to secrecy, having renounced his claim for Daenerys', but Sansa tells Tyrion, who in turn tells Varys.\n\nDaenerys flies to Dragonstone with her naval fleet in tow, while Jon marches south with her armies. She is ambushed by Euron Greyjoy and his Iron Fleet, who kill Rhaegal, destroy Daenerys' fleet, and take Missandei captive. Daenerys and her advisors travel to King's Landing to negotiate Cersei's surrender and Missandei's release, but Cersei has [[Gregor Clegane]] behead Missandei in front of Daenerys. Tyrion reveals to Daenerys that Varys is trying to seat Jon on the Iron Throne, and she executes Varys via dragonfire for his treachery. Alone with Jon later, Daenerys attempts to kiss him but he pulls away due to their blood relation. Daenerys resigns herself to relying on fear to assert herself.\n\nAs Daenerys' army makes camp, Jaime is spotted trying to infiltrate King's Landing and imprisoned, but Tyrion defies Daenerys to release him and have him rescue Cersei. Before the battle, Tyrion pleads with Daenerys to spare the inhabitants of King's Landing if they ring the bells to declare surrender. When Daenerys burns the Iron Fleet and the city's defenses, the Lannister soldiers and city surrender, but Daenerys proceeds to burn down much of King's Landing, killing countless civilians. Cersei and Jaime are also killed when the Red Keep collapses on them. Addressing her army in the aftermath, Daenerys declares that she will use her might to \"liberate\" the entire world. She accuses Tyrion of treason for releasing his brother and has him arrested when he publicly resigns as hand. Arya and Tyrion warn Jon that Daenerys will view his Targaryen heritage as a threat to her rule while Tyrion warns that Jon's sisters will not bend the knee to her now. Tyrion tells Jon that despite Jon's feelings for Daenerys, it is his duty to kill her for being the people's greatest threat. Jon attempts to reason with Daenerys, but when she continues to assert that her actions are necessary to establish a good world, a conflicted Jon fatally stabs her. She dies in his arms as he weeps. Drogon arrives shortly after and melts the Iron Throne before departing Westeros with Daenerys' body, grieving.\n\nBran Stark is later elected king; he sends Jon back to the Night's Watch to appease Daenerys' supporters.\n\n== Reception ==\n===General===\n[[File:Emilia Clarke by Gage Skidmore 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Emilia Clarke]] was relatively unknown before her role as Daenerys in ''Game of Thrones''.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\" />]]\nDaenerys is one of the most popular characters of the book series, together with [[Tyrion Lannister]] and [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]].<ref name=\"NYT Dance 2011-07\" /> ''[[The New York Times]]'' called Daenerys one of Martin's \"finest creations\".<ref name=\"NYT 2011-08\"/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked her No. 1 on a list of \"Top 40 ''Game of Thrones'' Characters\", calling her story a \"non-stop confrontation with complex ideas about sex, war, gender, race, politics and morality\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\">{{cite news|title=Top 40 ''Game of Thrones'' Characters, Ranked|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/top-40-game-of-thrones-characters-ranked-20140331|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|accessdate=September 24, 2014|date=March 31, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927113520/http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/top-40-game-of-thrones-characters-ranked-20140331|archive-date=September 27, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Matthew Gilbert of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called her scenes \"mesmerizing\".<ref name=\"John W.

R. Martin's ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels had [[Foreshadowing|foreshadowed]] this.<ref name=\"Prokop\"/> He said that \"Daenerys has long been capable of great compassion \u2014 and great violence\" and that \"the great power her dragons give her\" enables the latter. He pointed to Daenerys being \"angered by the Meereenese nobles' crucifixion of slave children\" and ordering \"an equivalent number of captured nobles crucified,\" and addressed other instances of her cruelty, such as when she burned Samwell Tarly's father and brother to death when they refused to kneel for her. He said that, in one of Martin's books, Daenerys \"implies that her only fear is herself. She's afraid of what she might do.\" Prokop, however, agreed with the complaints that the twist was poorly executed.<ref name=\"Prokop\"/> James Hibberd of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' also pointed to signs that Daenerys was always destined to be a villain, such as her vision in the House of the Undying where she walked through the Red Keep and saw white ash (then thought of as snow) falling into the throne room. He questioned: \"Did we already think Dany was capable of [burning thousands of innocents]? Or were we in denial about her murderous ways? Did we really think somebody who crucified 163 people because she assumed they were all responsible for killing slaves was a good person?\" Acknowledging that the show had perhaps been \"a bit tricky in playing her murderous moments as heroic\" and that the turn was therefore shocking, he said that Daenerys always chose extreme violence when very upset. Hibberd felt that the show tested Daenerys's character, \"and in doing so, the thing that [the show] is actually pushing is a debate about Dany's morality, bringing that question into the foreground of the show after letting it sit quietly in the background for so long.\"<ref name=\"Hibberd\">{{cite web|first=James|last=Hibberd|title=Game of Thrones recap for season 8, episode 5: Queens of the ashes|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=May 12, 2019|accessdate=May 19, 2019|url=https://ew.com/recap/game-of-thrones-season-8-episode-5/}}</ref>\n\nRose Moore of [[Screen Rant]] stated that \"having Daenerys turn into the villain [fits perfectly]\" within the series, where Targaryens \"have a tendency to madness\" and that it creates \"a beautiful villain origin story.\"<ref name=\"Moore\"/> Moore reasoned that having Daenerys go from an exiled innocent to Queen and savior of her people to a villain shows \"how her grand ideas of freedom weren't enough to make her a hero\" and that \"how an obsession with power, and a determination that she is 'right' in believing that the Throne is hers, is enough to take her from Mother to Dictator.\" To Moore, there exists a \"wonderful symmetry to hav[ing] the death of the Mad King set the events of ''Game of Thrones'' in motion, only to be wrapped up by the ascension and death of a Mad Queen.\"<ref name=\"Moore\"/> Prokop also felt that the series could not end \"with a triumphant Daenerys Targaryen heroically taking the Iron Throne\" because \"it wouldn't be ''Game of Thrones''\".<ref name=\"Prokop 2\">{{cite web|first=Andrew|last=Prokop|title=Game of Thrones\u2019 King\u2019s Landing horror fittingly reveals what the show has always been about|work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|date=May 15, 2019 |accessdate=May 15, 2019|url=https://www.vox.com/2019/5/13/18617648/game-of-thrones-season-8-bells-dany-burns-kings-landing}}</ref>\n\nFans generally attributed the change in Daenerys's arc to the writers throwing away her character development, with many criticizing it as character assassination.<ref name=\"Bruney\"/><ref name=\"THR staff\">{{cite web|title='Game of Thrones' Final Season Draws Backlash Over Portrayal of Female Characters|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 13, 2019|accessdate=May 13, 2019|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-final-season-backlash-female-characters-daenerys-targaryen-twitter-reactions-1210005}}</ref> ''[[HuffPost]]'''s Elyse Wanshel said, \"It was an upsetting turn for a strong and sympathetic female character whom many believed would emerge as the series' hero.\"<ref name=\"Wanshel\">{{cite web|first=Elyse|last=Wanshel|title=Emilia Clarke Tried To Warn Us We\u2019d Hate Daenerys\u2019 \u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019 Ending|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=May 13, 2019 |accessdate=May 20, 2019|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/emilia-clarke-game-of-thrones-interview_n_5cd989e1e4b0b0e70ab39ac9?guccounter}}</ref> Emily VanDerWerff of ''Vox'' quoted writer Sady Doyle stating, \"Women who expected Daenerys to become a benevolent feminist ruler, to break the wheel and end the cycle of oppression, were not stupid; they were following basic story logic.\"<ref name=\"VanDerWerff\">{{cite web|first=Emily|last=VanDerWerff|title=Why everybody\u2019s so mad about Daenerys Targaryen|work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|date=May 17, 2019 |accessdate=May 19, 2019|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/5/17/18624767/game-of-thrones-series-finale-season-8-episode-5-the-bells-daenerys-dany-kings-landing-targaryen}}</ref> VanDerWerff said that \"many people have related to Dany deeply, seeing in her an avatar of feminine power they hadn't seen elsewhere in pop culture when the show debuted in 2011.
