Its basic premise involves celebrities being interviewed by host [[Sean Evans (interviewer)|Sean Evans]] over a platter of increasingly spicy [[Chicken as food|chicken wings]].\n\n==Format==\nThe format involves Evans and his guests eating ten chicken wings (or an alternative if the guest is [[Veganism|vegan]]), each prepared with a progressively hotter [[hot sauce]]. Evans states the show's [[tagline]] at the beginning of each episode: \"The show with hot questions, and even hotter wings.\"\n\nThe first sauce presented is relatively mild such as [[Sriracha]], which has a rating of 2,200 [[Scoville Scale|Scoville]] units. The final sauce (as of season 4), Hot Ones' own The Last Dab (The Last Dab Reduxx starting in season 6, and The Last Dab XXX starting in Season 10), has a Scoville rating of 2,000,000+.<ref name=\"Scoville Scale\">{{cite web|author=Roberts, Scott|title=Scoville Scale &#8211; The Official Scott Roberts Website |url=http://www.scottrobertsweb.com/scoville-scale |publisher=Scott Roberts Web|accessdate=2017-08-11|date=2012-06-07}}</ref> As per \"tradition\", the guests are encouraged to put a minuscule amount of The Last Dab on the final wing; they are told this is not required, but most guests opt to do so even when already struggling with the heat of the previous wings.\n\nAfter each wing, Evans asks his guest an interview question. As the wings get hotter, the guest typically begins to display the effects of eating the spicier wings and the interview becomes less focused on the guest and more so the struggle to finish the wings. The guests are also provided glasses of water and milk to counteract the effect of the wings.\n\nThe standard show is Evans and one guest eating ten wings each, but in some episodes where there are two guests (such as the episode featuring [[Keegan-Michael Key]] and [[Jordan Peele]]), only five wings are given to each guest. A guest who successfully finishes all ten wings is given the opportunity to promote their upcoming projects. Guests who fail are still afforded this opportunity but are also added to the show's Hall of Shame.\n\n== Show history ==\nThe show was created by First We Feast Founder Christopher Schonberger. Schonberger cites [[Alexa Chung]]'s quirky interview show ''[[Popworld]]'' as the inspiration for the show.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/celebs-will-say-anything-if-you-blast-them-with-hot-sauce-1522157082|title=Celebs Will Say Anything if You Blast Them With Hot Sauce|last=Steinberg|first=Don|date=2018-03-27|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}</ref> The show is hosted by Sean Evans.\n\n==List of episodes==\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{Episode table |background=#FFA6B9|overall= |season= |title= |airdate= |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = [[Tony Yayo]] Talks Shmoney Dance and Eminem's Taco Habit While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|3|12}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = [[Anthony Rizzo]] On Chicago Cubs Rivalries & Baseball Superstitions While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|5|12}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Machine Gun Kelly]] Talks Diddy, Hangovers, & Amber Rose While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|6|11}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 4\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = [[Gunplay (rapper)|Gunplay]] Talks Rick Ross, Wingstop, and X-Box Live Fights While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|6|23}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n| Title           = [[Ja Rule]] Talks 50 Cent Beef, Jail Recipes, and Media Stereotypes While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|8|11}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n| Title           = [[B.o.B.]] Talks Eggplant Fridays, Kid Rock, and Snapchat While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|8|26}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 7\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n| Title           = [[Prince Amukamara]] Talks NFL Salaries & Pre-Game Sex While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|10|7}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 8\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n| Title           = [[DJ Khaled]] Talks Fuccbois, Finga Licking, and Media Dinosaurs While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|10|22}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n}}\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{Episode table |background=#FFA2B2|overall= |season= |title= |airdate= |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 9\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = [[Curren$y]] Talks Munchies, Industry Games, and Rap Dogs While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|12|10}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 10\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = [[Tinashe]] Talks NFL Dances and 2015's Sexiest Songs While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|12|17}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 11\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = [[Tommy Chong]] Talks Weed, Bernie Sanders, and Smoking with Snoop While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|2|3}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 12\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = [[T.J.

Hosted by Evans, the series pits two pairs of players against one another for a chance to win up to $25,000. The main game is played in three rounds, using wings that have been cooked in hot sauces whose Scoville ratings increase from one round to the next. Players are not provided with any water or milk to reduce the effects of the wings, but are given buckets in which to vomit if necessary.\n\nIn each of the first two rounds, the players begin by eating one wing apiece and the host asks three toss-up questions open to all. The first team to buzz-in has five seconds to respond; a correct answer awards them money, while a miss gives it to the opposing team. Questions are worth $100/$200/$300 in the first round, and these values double for the second.\n\nIn the third round, the players begin by eating one bite of a wing. The host reads a series of clues, and players may buzz-in at any time to identify the subject being described. Three puzzles are played, worth $1,000/$2,000/$3,000; the team that scores on each puzzle must then take another bite. In this round, if a team misses, the opponents must give the correct answer in order to score. Both teams keep their accumulated winnings.\n\nThe higher-scoring team advances to the \"Ring of Fire\" bonus round, in which each member must drink a shot of hot sauce at the outset. One member is then shown a series of words and must get his/her partner to guess each one by describing it. The clue-giver may pass on a word at any time. If the team can solve five words in 60 seconds, their winnings are increased to $25,000 and they are given large milkshakes to relieve the effects of the sauce and wings they have eaten.\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{Abbr|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2017\n| [[7th Streamy Awards|Streamy Award]]\n| Best Food Series\n| {{Nom}}\n| <ref>https://www.streamys.org/nominees-winners/7th-annual-nominees/</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2018\n| [[8th Streamy Awards|Streamy Award]]\n| Non-Fiction Series\n| {{won}}\n| <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.streamys.org/2018/10/winners-announced-for-the-8th-annual-streamy-awards/|title=Winners Announced for the 8th Annual Streamy Awards|last=Brown|first=Kelsey|publisher=Streamy Awards|accessdate=February 28, 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 2019\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[9th Streamy Awards|Streamy Award]]\n| Show of the Year\n| {{Nom}}\n| <ref name=\"9th Streamy Awards\">https://www.streamys.org/nominees-winners/9th-annual-nominees/</ref>\n|-\n| Pop Culture\n| {{Won}}\n| <ref name=\"9th Streamy Awards\" />\n|-\n|}\n\n== Note ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|url=http://firstwefeast.com/tag/hot-ones}}\n\n{{Streamy Awards Winners CSS}}\n\n[[Category:YouTube series]]\n[[Category:2010s American television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:2015 web series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s in food]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Hot Ones\n| image                    = Hot Ones by First We Feast logo.svg\n| genre                    = Interview\n| creator                  = Christopher Schonberger\n| starring                 = [[Sean Evans (interviewer)|Sean Evans]]\n| country                  = [[United States]]\n| language                 = English\n| num_seasons              = 11\n| num_episodes             = 183\n| list_episodes            = \n| network                  = [[YouTube]]\n| picture_format           = [[1080p]] (HD) {{small|(Ep 1\u201348)}}<br/>[[2160p]] (UHD) {{small|(Ep 49\u2013current)}}\n| first_aired              = {{Start date|2015|3|12}}\n| last_aired               = present\n}}\n'''''Hot Ones''''' is a [[YouTube]] [[web series]], created by Christopher Schonberger and produced by [[First We Feast]] and [[Complex (magazine)|Complex Media]]. Its basic premise involves celebrities being interviewed by host [[Sean Evans (interviewer)|Sean Evans]] over a platter of increasingly spicy [[Chicken as food|chicken wings]].\n\n==Format==\nThe format involves Evans and his guests eating ten chicken wings (or an alternative if the guest is [[Veganism|vegan]]), each prepared with a progressively hotter [[hot sauce]]. Evans states the show's [[tagline]] at the beginning of each episode: \"The show with hot questions, and even hotter wings.\"\n\nThe first sauce presented is relatively mild such as [[Sriracha]], which has a rating of 2,200 [[Scoville Scale|Scoville]] units. The final sauce (as of season 4), Hot Ones' own The Last Dab (The Last Dab Reduxx starting in season 6, and The Last Dab XXX starting in Season 10), has a Scoville rating of 2,000,000+.<ref name=\"Scoville Scale\">{{cite web|author=Roberts, Scott|title=Scoville Scale &#8211; The Official Scott Roberts Website |url=http://www.scottrobertsweb.com/scoville-scale |publisher=Scott Roberts Web|accessdate=2017-08-11|date=2012-06-07}}</ref> As per \"tradition\", the guests are encouraged to put a minuscule amount of The Last Dab on the final wing; they are told this is not required, but most guests opt to do so even when already struggling with the heat of the previous wings.\n\nAfter each wing, Evans asks his guest an interview question. As the wings get hotter, the guest typically begins to display the effects of eating the spicier wings and the interview becomes less focused on the guest and more so the struggle to finish the wings. The guests are also provided glasses of water and milk to counteract the effect of the wings.\n\nThe standard show is Evans and one guest eating ten wings each, but in some episodes where there are two guests (such as the episode featuring [[Keegan-Michael Key]] and [[Jordan Peele]]), only five wings are given to each guest. A guest who successfully finishes all ten wings is given the opportunity to promote their upcoming projects. Guests who fail are still afforded this opportunity but are also added to the show's Hall of Shame.\n\n== Show history ==\nThe show was created by First We Feast Founder Christopher Schonberger. Schonberger cites [[Alexa Chung]]'s quirky interview show ''[[Popworld]]'' as the inspiration for the show.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/celebs-will-say-anything-if-you-blast-them-with-hot-sauce-1522157082|title=Celebs Will Say Anything if You Blast Them With Hot Sauce|last=Steinberg|first=Don|date=2018-03-27|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}</ref> The show is hosted by Sean Evans.\n\n==List of episodes==\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{Episode table |background=#FFA6B9|overall= |season= |title= |airdate= |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = [[Tony Yayo]] Talks Shmoney Dance and Eminem's Taco Habit While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|3|12}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = [[Anthony Rizzo]] On Chicago Cubs Rivalries & Baseball Superstitions While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|5|12}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Machine Gun Kelly]] Talks Diddy, Hangovers, & Amber Rose While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|6|11}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 4\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = [[Gunplay (rapper)|Gunplay]] Talks Rick Ross, Wingstop, and X-Box Live Fights While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|6|23}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n| Title           = [[Ja Rule]] Talks 50 Cent Beef, Jail Recipes, and Media Stereotypes While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|8|11}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n| Title           = [[B.o.B.]] Talks Eggplant Fridays, Kid Rock, and Snapchat While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|8|26}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 7\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n| Title           = [[Prince Amukamara]] Talks NFL Salaries & Pre-Game Sex While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|10|7}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 8\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n| Title           = [[DJ Khaled]] Talks Fuccbois, Finga Licking, and Media Dinosaurs While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|10|22}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n}}\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{Episode table |background=#FFA2B2|overall= |season= |title= |airdate= |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 9\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = [[Curren$y]] Talks Munchies, Industry Games, and Rap Dogs While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|12|10}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 10\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = [[Tinashe]] Talks NFL Dances and 2015's Sexiest Songs While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|12|17}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 11\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = [[Tommy Chong]] Talks Weed, Bernie Sanders, and Smoking with Snoop While Eating Spicy Wings\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|2|3}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FFA6B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 12\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = [[T.J.

Hosted by Evans, the series pits two pairs of players against one another for a chance to win up to $25,000. The main game is played in three rounds, using wings that have been cooked in hot sauces whose Scoville ratings increase from one round to the next. Players are not provided with any water or milk to reduce the effects of the wings, but are given buckets in which to vomit if necessary.\n\nIn each of the first two rounds, the players begin by eating one wing apiece and the host asks three toss-up questions open to all. The first team to buzz-in has five seconds to respond; a correct answer awards them money, while a miss gives it to the opposing team. Questions are worth $100/$200/$300 in the first round, and these values double for the second.\n\nIn the third round, the players begin by eating one bite of a wing. The host reads a series of clues, and players may buzz-in at any time to identify the subject being described. Three puzzles are played, worth $1,000/$2,000/$3,000; the team that scores on each puzzle must then take another bite. In this round, if a team misses, the opponents must give the correct answer in order to score.

With the assistance of [[Sidney Webb]], Henderson designed a new [[Labour Party Constitution|constitution for the Labour Party]] in which it adopted a strongly [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] platform in 1918 to ensure that it would not lose support to the new [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], exemplified by [[Clause IV]] of the constitution.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2006|pp=46\u201347}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00015, Friedrich Ebert.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Friedrich Ebert]], [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|president of Germany]] (1919\u20131925)]]\nThe overthrow of the tsarist regime in Russia in February 1917 impacted politics in Germany as it ended the legitimation used by Ebert and other pro-war SPD members that Germany was in the war against a reactionary Russian government. With the overthrow of the tsar and revolutionary socialist agitation increased in Russia, such events influenced socialists in Germany.{{sfn|Chickering|p=155}}\n\nWith rising bread shortages in Germany amid war rationing, mass strikes occurred beginning in April 1917 with 300,000 strikers taking part in a strike in Berlin. The strikers demanded bread, freedom, peace and the formation of [[workers' council]]s as was being done in Russia. Amidst the German public's uproar, the SPD alongside the [[Progressive People's Party (Germany)|Progressives]] and the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic]] labour movement in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] put forward the [[Reichstag Peace Resolution|Peace Resolution]] on 19 July 1917 that called for a compromise peace to end the war which was passed by a majority of members of the Reichstag.{{sfn|Chickering|p=155}}\n\nThe German High Command opposed the Peace Resolution, but it did seek to end the war with Russia and presented the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] to the [[Bolshevik government]] in 1918 that agreed to the terms and the Reichstag passed the treaty which included the support of the SPD, the Progressives and the Catholic political movement.{{sfn|Chickering|p=155}}\n\nBy late 1918, the war situation for Germany had become hopeless and [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] was pressured to make peace. Wilhelm II appointed a new cabinet that included SPD members. At the same time, the Imperial Naval Command was determined to make a heroic last stand against the British [[Royal Navy]]. On 24 October 1918, it issued orders for the German Navy to depart to confront, but the sailors refused, resulting in the [[Kiel mutiny]].{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=145}}\n\nThe Kiel mutiny resulted in [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|revolution]]. Faced with military failure and revolution, [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]] resigned, giving SPD leader Ebert the position of Chancellor. Wihelm II abdicated the German throne immediately afterwards and the German High Command officials [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and [[Erich Ludendorff]] resigned whilst refusing to end the war to save face, leaving the Ebert government and the SPD-majority Reichstag to be forced to make the inevitable peace with the Allies and take the blame for having lost the war. With the abdication of Wilhelm II, Ebert declared Germany to be a republic and signed the armistice that ended World War I on 11 November 1918.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=145}}\n\nThe new social democratic government in Germany faced political violence in Berlin by a movement of [[Communism|communist]] revolutionaries known as the [[Spartacist League]], who sought to repeat the feat of Lenin and the Bolsheviks in Russia by overthrowing the German government.{{sfn|Childs|2000|p=2}} Tensions between the governing majority of Social Democrats led by Ebert versus the strongly [[left-wing]] elements of the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) and communists over Ebert's refusal to immediately reform the German Army resulted in the January rising by the newly formed [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) and the USPD which saw communists mobilizing a large workers' demonstration.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=145}}\n\nThe SPD responded by holding a counter-demonstration that was effective in demonstrating support for the government and the USPD soon withdrew its support for the rising.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=145}} However, the communists continued to revolt and between 12 and 28 January 1919 communist forces had seized control of several government buildings in Berlin. Ebert responded by requesting that defense minister [[Gustav Noske]] take charge of loyal soldiers to fight the communists and secure the government.{{sfn|Childs|2000|p=2}} Ebert was furious with the communists' intransigence and said that he wished \"to teach the radicals a lesson they would never forget\".{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=145}}\n\nNoske was able to rally groups of mostly reactionary former soldiers, known as the [[Freikorps]], who were eager to fight the communists. The situation soon went completely out of control when the recruited Freikorps went on a violent rampage against workers and murdered the communist leaders [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]]. The atrocities by the government-recruited Freikorps against the communist revolutionaries badly tarnished the reputation of the SPD and strengthened the confidence of reactionary forces.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=145}}\n\nIn spite of this, the SPD was able to win the largest number of seats in the [[1919 German federal election|parliamentary election held on 19 January 1919]] and Ebert was elected [[president of Germany]]. However, the USPD refused to support the government in response to the atrocities committed by the SPD government-recruited ''Freikorps''.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=145}}\n\nDue to the unrest in Berlin, the drafting of the constitution of the new German republic was undertaken in the city of Weimar and the following political era is referred to as the [[Weimar Republic]]. Upon founding the new government, President Ebert cooperated with liberal members of his coalition government to create the [[Weimar constitution]] and sought to begin a program of nationalization of certain sectors of the economy. Political unrest and violence continued and the government's continued reliance on the help of the far-right and [[counter-revolutionary]] Freikorps militias to fight the [[revolutionary]] Spartacists further alienated potential left-wing support for the SPD.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=146}}\n\nThe SPD coalition government's acceptance of the harsh peace conditions of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in June 1919 infuriated the German right, including the Freikorps that had previously been willing to cooperate with the government to fight the Spartacists. In the June 1919 German federal election, the SPD's share of the vote significantly declined due to their previous ties to the Freikorps.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=146}}\n\nIn March 1920, a group of [[right-wing]] [[militarists]] led by [[Wolfgang Kapp]] and former German military chief-of-staff Erich Ludendorff initiated a briefly successful [[putsch]] against the German government in what became known as the [[Kapp Putsch]], but the putsch ultimately failed and the government was restored.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=146}}\n\n[[File:Noe Zhordania meets 2nd International delegation. 1920.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Noe Zhordania]] (man with white beard and wearing a white hat on the left side of the car), [[Prime Minister of Georgia|prime minister]] of the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|newly independent Georgia]], attending a meeting of the [[Labour and Socialist International]] in 1920]]\nAfter World War I, several attempts were made at a global level to refound the Second International that collapsed amidst national divisions in the war.

Upon confirmation, Bronsky did not return to the meeting.{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=425}}\n\nThe overall response from the Vienna International was divided. The Mensheviks demanded that the Vienna International immediately condemn Russia's aggression against Georgia, but the majority as represented by German delegate Alfred Henke sought to exercise caution and said that the delegates should wait for confirmation.{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=509}} Russia's invasion of Georgia completely violated the non-aggression treaty signed between Lenin and Zhordania as well as violating Georgia's sovereignty by annexing Georgia directly into the [[Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]]. Tensions between Bolsheviks and social democrats worsened with the [[Kronstadt rebellion]].{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=425}} This was caused by unrest among leftists against the Bolshevik government in Russia. Russian social democrats distributed leaflets calling for a general strike against the Bolshevik regime and the Bolsheviks responded by forcefully repressing the rebels.{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=434}}\n\nRelations between the social democratic movement and Bolshevik Russia descended into complete antagonism in response to the [[Russian famine of 1921]] and the Bolsheviks' violent repression of opposition to their government. Multiple social democratic parties were disgusted with Russia's Bolshevik regime, particularly Germany's SPD and the Netherlands' [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] (SDAP) that denounced the Bolsheviks for defiling socialism and declared that the Bolsheviks had \"driven out the best of our comrades, thrown them into prison and put them to death\".{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=441}}\n\nIn May 1923, social democrats united to found their own international, the [[Labour and Socialist International]] (LSI), founded in Hamburg, Germany. The LSI declared that all its affiliated political parties would retain autonomy to make their own decisions regarding internal affairs of their countries, but that international affairs would be addressed by the LSI.{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=509}} The LSI addressed the issue of the rise of [[fascism]] by declaring the LSI to be [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]].{{sfn|Ceplair|1987|p=78}}\n\nIn response to the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936 between the democratically elected [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] government versus the authoritarian right-wing [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] led by [[Francisco Franco]] with the support of [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], the Executive Committee of the LSI declared not only its support for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]], but also that it supported the Spanish government having the right to purchase arms to fight Franco's Nationalist forces.

Furthermore, social democratic parties declared that the Great Depression demonstrated the need for substantial macroeconomic planning by the state while their free market opponents staunchly opposed this.{{sfn|Notermans|2000|p=111}} However, attempts by social democratic governments to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the ensuing political instability in their countries caused by the depression. For instance, the British Labour Party became internally split over said policies while Germany's SPD government did not have the time to implement such policies as Germany's politics degenerated into violent civil unrest pitting the left against the right in which the [[Nazi Party]] rose to power in January 1933 and violently dismantled parliamentary democracy for the next twenty-two years.{{sfn|Notermans|2000|p=102}}\n\nA major development for social democracy was the victory of several social democratic parties in Scandinavia, particularly the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] (SAP) in the [[1920 Swedish general election]].{{sfn|Sejersted|2011|p=180}} The SAP was elected to a [[minority government]].

In the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 general election]], the Labour Party won a plurality of seats and was elected as a minority government, but required assistance from the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] to achieve a majority in parliament. Opponents of the Labour Party falsely accused the party of Bolshevik sympathies. Prime Minister MacDonald responded to these allegations by stressing the party's commitment to reformist gradualism and openly opposing the radical wing in the party.{{sfn|Morgan|2006|pp=43\u201344}}\n\nMacDonald emphasized that the Labour minority government's first and foremost commitment was to uphold democratic and responsible government over all other policies. MacDonald emphasized this because he knew that any attempt to pass major socialist legislation in a minority government would endanger the new government as it would be opposed and blocked by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and the Liberals, who together held a majority of seats. The Labour Party had risen to power in the aftermath of Britain's severe recession of 1921\u20131922.{{sfn|Jeffreys|1999|p=29}}\n\nWith the economy beginning to recover, British trade unions demanded that their wages be restored from the cuts they took in the recession. The trade unions soon became deeply dissatisfied with the MacDonald government and labour unrest and threat of strikes arose in transportation sector, including docks and railways. MacDonald viewed the situation as a crisis, consulting the unions in advance to warn them that his government would have to use strikebreakers if the situation continued. The anticipated clash between the government and the unions was averted, but the situation alienated the unions from the MacDonald government, whose most controversial action was having Britain recognize the Soviet Union in February 1924. The British conservative tabloid press, including the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', used this to promote a [[red scare]] by claiming that the Labour government's recognition of the Soviet Union proved that Labour held pro-Bolshevik sympathies.{{sfn|Jeffreys|1999|p=29}}\n\nThe Labour Party lost the 1924 general election and a Conservative government was elected. Although MacDonald faced multiple challenges to his leadership of the party, the Labour Party stabilized as a capable opposition to the Conservative government by 1927. MacDonald released a new political programme for the party titled ''Labour and the Nation'' (1928). The Labour Party returned to government in 1929, but it soon had to deal with the economic catastrophe of the stock market crash of 1929.{{sfn|Jeffreys|1999|p=29}}\n\n[[File:Rudolf Hilferding and Gattin, cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rudolf Hilferding]], a major figure and policymaker in the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] and the Czechoslovak [[Sopade]]]]\nIn the 1920s, SPD policymaker and Marxist [[Rudolf Hilferding]] proposed substantial policy changes in the SPD as well as influencing social democratic and socialist theory.

Organized capitalism was based upon [[Trust (monopoly)|trusts]] and [[cartel]]s controlled by financial institutions that could no longer make profit within their countries' national boundaries and therefore needed to export to survive, resulting in support for imperialism.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=56}}\n\nHilferding described that while early capitalism promoted itself as peaceful and based on free trade, the era of organized capitalism was aggressive and said that \"in the place of humanity there came the idea of the strength and power of the state\". He said that this had the consequence of creating effective collectivization within capitalism and had prepared the way for socialism.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=57}}\n\nOriginally, Hilferding's vision of a socialism replacing organized capitalism was highly Kautskyan in assuming an either/or perspective and expecting a catastrophic clash between organized capitalism versus socialism. By the 1920s, Hilferding became an adherent to promoting a gradualist evolution of capitalism into socialism. He then praised organised capitalism for being a step towards socialism, saying at the SPD congress in 1927 that organised capitalism is nothing less than \"the replacement of the capitalist principle of free competition by the socialist principle of planned production\". He went on to say that \"the problem is posed to our generation: with the help of the state, with the help of conscious social direction, to transform the economy organized and led by capitalists into an economy directed by the democratic state\".{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=57}}\n\nIn the 1930s, the SPD began to transition away from revisionist Marxism towards liberal socialism beginning in the 1930s.

Whereas the 1921\u20131923 SAP governments had run large deficits, the new SAP government reduced Sweden's budget deficit after a strong increase in state expenditure in 1933 and the resulting economic recovery. The government had planned to eliminate Sweden's budget deficit in seven years, but it took only three years to eliminate the deficit and Sweden had a budget surplus from 1936 to 1938.

Political violence in Mexico escalated in the 1920s after the outbreak of the [[Cristero War]] in which far-right reactionary clerics staged a violent insurgency against the left-wing government that was attempting to institute [[secularization]] in Mexico.{{sfn|Hart|1986|p=13}}\n\nCardenas' government also openly supported Spain's Republican government while opposing Francisco Franco's Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War.

Others such as French political scientist [[Pierre Manent]] emphasized the need for social democrats to rehabilitate and reinvigorate the idea of nationhood.{{sfn|Angier|2017}}\n\nIn a 2017 article in ''[[The Political Quarterly]]'', J\u00f6rg Michael Dostal explains the decline in Germany with electoral disillusionment with [[Third Way]] and [[neoliberal]] policies, or more specifically [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]]'s embrace of the [[Hartz reforms]] which recommended the privatization and reduction of the welfare state as well as the deregulation of the labour market and curtailing of workers rights. According to Dostal, the SPD subsequently lost half of its former electoral coalition (i.e. blue-collar voters and socially disadvantaged groups) while efforts to attract centrist and middle-class voters failed to produce any compensating gains. Furthermore, the article concludes that the only possible remedy is for the SPD to make efforts to regain former voters by abandoning neoliberalism and offering credible social welfare and redistributive policies.{{sfn|Dostal|2016|pp=230\u2013240}} A research article in ''[[Socio-Economic Review]]'' found that the longer-term electoral effects of the Hartz plan and [[Agenda 2010]] on relevant voter groups were limited, but that it had helped to entrench [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] as a permanent political force to the left of the SPD.{{sfn|Manow|Schwander|2016|pp=117\u2013134}}\n\nAfter the Norwegian [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]]'s surprising loss in the [[2017 Norwegian parliamentary election|2017 parliamentary election]], commentators such as the editor of ''[[Avisenes Nyhetsbyr\u00e5]]'' highlighted that the party had ignored a strong surge in discontent with [[mass immigration]] among potential voters.{{sfnm|1a1=Goffeng|1y=2017|2a1=Arnste|2y=2017|3a1=Hoel|3y=2017}} [[Hanne Skartveit]] of ''[[Verdens Gang]]'' later claimed that social democrats have been struggling because the sustainability of the welfare state is challenged by mass immigration. Skarstein emphasized the contrast between social democrats' strong commitment for helping people on the international scene on one side and their strong commitment in favour of welfare policies for the nation's own population on the other.{{sfn|Aune|Myklebust|2018}}\n\nSpain is one of the countries in which the [[PSOE]], the main social democratic party, has been governing for a longer period of time than any other party since the transition to democracy in 1977. However, it has also declined like the European social democratic parties, losing half of its electorate between 2010 and 2015 to Podemos and gaining its worst ever result in the 2015 general election since the restoration of democracy in Spain. Despite this loss, the PSOE returned to power in June 2018 after the government of [[Mariano Rajoy]] was ousted in a vote of no confidence in the aftermath of a corruption scandal, with [[Pedro S\u00e1nchez (politician)|Pedro S\u00e1nchez]] leading the party.

Those policies were dubbed as [[State Socialism (Germany)|State Socialism]] by the [[Liberalism in Germany|liberal]] opposition, but the term was later accepted and re-appropriated by Bismarck.{{sfn|Feuchtwanger|2002|p=221}} It was a set of social programs implemented in Germany that were initiated by Bismarck in 1883 as remedial measures to appease the [[working class]] and reduce support for [[socialism]] and the Social Democrats following earlier attempts to achieve the same objective through Bismarck's Anti-Socialist Laws.{{sfnm|1a1=Bismarck|1y=1884|2a1=Gregory|2a2=Stuart|2y=2003|2p=207|2ps=: \"Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced social welfare legislation in Germany between 1883 and 1888, despite violent political opposition, as a direct attempt to stave off Marx's (prediction of a) socialist revolution.\"}} This did not prevent the Social Democrats to become the biggest party in parliament by 1912.{{sfn|Boissoneault|2017|ps=: \"All told, Bismarck's system was a massive success\u2014except in one respect.

states}}\nSocial democracy is criticized by other socialists because it serves to devise new means to strengthen the capitalist system which conflicts with the socialist goal of replacing capitalism with a socialist system.{{sfn|Clarke|1981|p=2}} According to this view, social democracy fails to address the systemic issues inherent in capitalism. The American democratic socialist philosopher [[David Schweickart]] contrasts social democracy with [[democratic socialism]] by defining the former as an attempt to strengthen the [[welfare state]] and the latter as an alternative economic system to capitalism. According to Schweickart, the democratic socialist critique of social democracy is that capitalism can never be sufficiently humanised and that any attempt to suppress its economic contradictions will only cause them to emerge elsewhere. He gives the example that attempts to reduce unemployment too much would result in inflation and too much job security would erode labour discipline.{{sfn|Schweickart|2007|p=447|ps=: \"Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state\u2014pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance. They supported and tried to strengthen the labor movement. The latter, as socialists, argued that capitalism could never be sufficiently humanized and that trying to suppress the economic contradictions in one area would only see them emerge in a different guise elsewhere (e.g., if you push unemployment too low, you'll get inflation; if job security is too strong, labor discipline breaks down.)\"}} In contrast to social democracy's [[mixed economy]], democratic socialists advocate a [[post-capitalist]] economic system based on either a [[Market economy#Market socialism|market economy]] combined with [[workers' self-management]], or on some form of [[Participatory economy|participatory]], [[decentralized planning]] of the economy.{{sfn|Schweickart|2007|p=448|ps=: \"Some have endorsed the concept of market socialism, a postcapitalist economy that retains market competition but socializes the means of production and, in some versions, extends democracy to the workplace. Some hold out for a nonmarket, participatory economy. All democratic socialists agree on the need for a democratic alternative to capitalism.\"}}\n\n[[Marxian economics|Marxian]] socialists argue that social democratic welfare policies cannot resolve the fundamental structural issues of capitalism such as [[Business cycle#Marxian economics|cyclical fluctuations]], [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|exploitation]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]. Accordingly, social democratic programs intended to ameliorate living conditions in capitalism\u2014such as unemployment benefits and taxation on profits\u2014creates further contradictions by further limiting the efficiency of the capitalist system by reducing incentives for capitalists to invest in further production.{{sfn|Ticktin|1998|pp=60\u201361|ps=: \"The Marxist answers that [...] it involves limiting the incentive system of the market through providing minimum wages, high levels of unemployment insurance, reducing the size of the reserve army of labour, taxing profits, and taxing the wealthy. As a result, capitalists will have little incentive to invest and the workers will have little incentive to work. Capitalism works because, as Marx remarked, it is a system of economic force (coercion).\"}} The welfare state only serves to legitimize and prolong the exploitative and contradiction-laden system of capitalism to society's detriment. Critics of contemporary social democracy such as Jonas Hinnfors argue that when social democracy abandoned [[Marxism]] it also abandoned socialism and became a liberal capitalist movement, effectively making social democrats similar to non-socialist parties like the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the United States.{{sfn|Hinnfors|2006|pp=117, 137\u2013139}}\n\n[[Market socialism]] is also critical of social democratic welfare states. While one common goal of both concepts is to achieve greater social and economic equality, market socialism does so by changes in enterprise ownership and management whereas social democracy attempts to do so by subsidies and taxes on privately owned enterprises to finance welfare programs. [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt III]] (grandson of United States president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]) and David Belkin criticize social democracy for maintaining a [[Property income|property-owning capitalist class]] which has an active interest in reversing social democratic welfare policies and a disproportionate amount of power as a class to influence government policy.{{sfn|Weisskopf|1994|pp=314\u2013315|ps=: \"Social democracy achieves greater egalitarianism via ''ex post'' government taxes and subsidies, where market socialism does so via ''ex ante'' changes in patterns of enterprise ownership [...] the maintenance of property-owning capitalists under social democracy assures the presence of a disproportionately powerful class with a continuing interest in challenging social democratic government policies.\"}} The economists [[John Roemer]] and [[Pranab Bardhan]] point out that social democracy requires a strong [[labour movement]] to sustain its heavy redistribution through taxes and that it is idealistic to think such redistribution can be accomplished in other countries with weaker labour movements, noting that social democracy in Scandinavian countries has been in decline as the labour movement weakened.{{sfn|Bardhan|Roemer|1992|p=104|ps=: \"Since it permits a powerful capitalist class to exist (90 percent of productive assets are privately owned in Sweden), only a strong and unified labor movement can win the redistribution through taxes that is characteristic of social democracy. It is idealistic to believe that tax concessions of this magnitude can be effected simply through electoral democracy without an organized labour movement, when capitalists organize and finance influential political parties. Even in the Scandinavian countries, strong apex labor organizations have been difficult to sustain and social democracy is somewhat on the decline now.\"}}\n\nSome critics claim that social democracy abandoned socialism in the 1930s by endorsing Keynesian [[welfare capitalism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Wright|1y=1999|1pp=91|2a1=Fitzpatrick|2y=2003|2pp=2\u20133}} The democratic socialist political theorist [[Michael Harrington]] argues that social democracy historically supported [[Keynesianism]] as part of a \"social democratic compromise\" between capitalism and socialism. This compromise created welfare states and Harrington contends that although this compromise did not allow for the immediate creation of socialism, it \"recognized noncapitalist, and even anticapitalist, principles of human need over and above the imperatives of profit\".{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=93}} More recently, social democrats in favour of the [[Third Way]] have been accused of having endorsed capitalism, including by anti-Third Way social democrats who have accused Third Way proponents such as [[Anthony Giddens]] of being anti-social democratic and anti-socialist in practice.{{sfn|Cammack|2004|p=155}}\n\nSocial democracy's reformism has been criticized from both the left and right,{{sfnm|1a1=Socialist Party of Great Britain|1y=2002|2a1=Patnaik|2y=2010|2pp=3\u201321|3a1=Nagin|3y=2018}} for if the left was to govern a capitalist economy, it would have to do so according to capitalist, not socialist, logic. This argument was previously echoed by [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in ''[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]'' (1942), writing: \"Socialists had to govern in an essentially capitalist world [...], a social and economic system that would not function except on capitalist lines. [...] If they were to run it, they would have to run it according to its own logic. They would have to \"administer\" capitalism\".{{sfn|Romano|2006|p=114}} Similarly, [[Irving Kristol]] argued: \"Democratic socialism turns out to be an inherently unstable compound, a contradiction in terms. Every social-democratic party, once in power, soon finds itself choosing, at one point after another, between the socialist society it aspires to and the liberal society that lathered it\".{{sfn|Barrett|1978}} [[Joseph Stalin]] was a vocal critic of reformist social democracy, later coining the term [[social fascism]] to describe social democracy in the 1930s because in this period social democracy embraced a similar [[Corporatism|corporatist economic model]] to the model supported by [[fascism]]. This view was adopted by the [[Communist International]]. It was argued that capitalist society had entered the [[Third Period]] in which a [[proletarian revolution]] was imminent, but it could be prevented by social democrats and other fascist forces.{{sfn|Haro|2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[History of socialism]]\n* [[International Group of Democratic Socialists]]\n* [[List of anti-capitalist and communist parties with national parliamentary representation]]\n* [[List of democratic socialist parties that have governed]]\n* [[List of democratic socialist parties and organizations]]\n* [[List of democratic socialists]]\n* [[List of social democratic parties]]\n* [[List of social democrats]]\n* [[Socialist Party]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{notelist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n==== Books ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book|last=Abjorensen|first=Norman|year=2019|title=Historical Dictionary of Democracy|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9781538120743|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=1993|title=Political Ideology Today|series=Politics Today|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978071903346-9|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=2001|title=Political Ideology Today|edition=2nd|series=Politics Today|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719060199|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|editor1-last=Aggarwal|editor1-first=J.

Meanwhile, democratic socialism in Sweden provided an alternative model. Its sustained economic development and extensive welfare programs fascinated many. Numerous scholars within the democratic socialist camp argue that China should model itself politically and economically on Sweden, which is viewed as more genuinely socialist than China. There is a growing consensus among them that in the Nordic countries the welfare state has been extraordinarily successful in eliminating poverty.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Lowe|first=Rodney|date=12 April 1993|title=The Welfare State in Britain Since 1945|publisher=Palgrave|isbn=9781403911933|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|editor-last1=Ludlam|editor-first1=Steve|editor-last2=Smith|editor-first2=Martin J.|date=7 October 2017|title=Governing as New Labour: Policy and Politics Under Blair|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|isbn=9781403906786|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Luxemburg|first=Rosa|year=1900|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/|title=Reform or Revolution|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Macfarlane|first=Leslie|year=1996|chapter=Socialism and Common Ownership: An Historical Perspective|editor1-last=King|editor1-first=Preston|title=Socialism and the Common Good: New Fabian Essays|location=London|publisher=Frank Cass|pages=17\u201362|isbn=9780714646558|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Mander|first=Jerry|date=2012|title=The Capitalism Papers: Fatal Flaws of an Obsolete System|url=https://archive.org/details/capitalismpapers0000mand/page/213|publisher=Counterpoint|pages=213\u2013217|isbn=9781582437170|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last1=Marglin|first1=Stephen A.|last2=Schor|first2=Juliet B.|year=1991|title=The Golden Age of Capitalism: Reinterpreting the Postwar Experience|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=9780198287414|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198287414.001.0001|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last1=Marglin|first1=Stephen A.|last2=Schor|first2=Juliet B.|date=21 August 2017|title=Reflecting on Seventy Years of Development Policy Analysis|chapter=Post-war reconstruction and development in the Golden Age of Capitalism|work=World Economic and Social Survey 2017|series=World Economic and Social Survey|publisher=United Nations iLibrary|doi=10.18356/8310f38c-en|isbn=9789210605984|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Marx|first=Karl|year=1972|editor-last=Padover|editor-first=Saul K.|editor-link=Saul K.

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

[[Economic interventionism|economic]] and [[Social interventionism|social interventions]] to promote [[social justice]] within the framework of a [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] [[polity]] and a [[capitalist]]-oriented [[mixed economy]]. The protocols and norms used to accomplish this involve a commitment to [[Representative democracy|representative]] and [[participatory democracy]], measures for [[income redistribution]], [[Regulatory economics|regulation of the economy]] in the [[Common good|general interest]] and [[social welfare]] provisions.{{sfn|Miller|1998|p=827}}{{sfn|Badie|Berg-Schlosser|Morlino|2011|p=2423|ps=: \"Social democracy refers to a political tendency resting on three fundamental features: (1) democracy (e.g., equal rights to vote and form parties), (2) an economy partly regulated by the state (e.g., through Keynesianism), and (3) a welfare state offering social support to those in need (e.g., equal rights to education, health service, employment and pensions).\"}}{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=128|ps=: \"Social democracy is an ideological stance that supports a broad balance between market capitalism, on the one hand, and state intervention, on the other hand. Being based on a compromise between the market and the state, social democracy lacks a systematic underlying theory and is, arguably, inherently vague. It is nevertheless associated with the following views: (1) capitalism is the only reliable means of generating wealth, but it is a morally defective means of distributing wealth because of its tendency towards poverty and inequality; (2) the defects of the capitalist system can be rectified through economic and social intervention, the state being the custodian of the public interest [...].\"}} Due to longstanding governance by [[Social Democratic Party|social democratic parties]] during the [[post-war consensus]] and their influence on [[socioeconomic]] policy in the [[Nordic countries]], social democracy has become associated with the [[Nordic model]] and [[Keynesianism]] within political circles in the late 20th century.{{sfn|Gombert|2009|p=8}}{{sfn|Sejersted|2011}} It has also been seen by some political commentators as a synonym for modern socialism{{sfn|Eatwell|Wright|1999|p=100}}{{sfn|Pruitt|2019|ps=: \"Social democracy, the most common form of modern socialism, focuses on achieving social reforms and redistribution of wealth through democratic processes, and can co-exist alongside a free-market capitalist economy.\"}}{{sfn|Berman|2020|ps=: \"Social democracy is a variant of socialism distinguished by a conviction that democracy makes it both possible and desirable to take advantage of capitalism's upsides while addressing its downsides by regulating markets and implementing social policies that insulate citizens from those markets' most destabilizing and destructive consequences.\"}} and as overlapping with [[democratic socialism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Williams|1y=1985|1p=289|2a1=Foley|2y=1994|2p=23|3a1=Eatwell|3a2=Wright|3y=1999|3p=80|3ps=: \"So too with 'democratic socialism', a term coined by its adherents as an act of disassociation from the twentieth-century realities of undemocratic socialism (an illegitimate, indeed impossible, coupling in terms of classical doctrine, including Marxist doctrine) [...].\"|4a1=Busky|4y=2000|4p=8|4ps=: \"Social democracy is a somewhat controversial term among democratic socialists.

Unlike Marx and Engels' ''[[The Communist Manifesto|Communist Manifesto]]'', Lassalle promoted class struggle in a more moderate form.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=52}} While [[Marx's theory of the state]] saw it negatively as an instrument of [[Ruling class|class rule]] that should only exist temporarily upon the rise to power of the [[proletariat]] and then dismantled, Lassalle accepted the state. Lassalle viewed the state as a means through which workers could enhance their interests and even transform the society to create an economy based on [[Worker cooperative|worker-run cooperatives]]. Lassalle's strategy was primarily electoral and reformist, with [[Lassallism|Lassalleans]] contending that the working class needed a political party that fought above all for universal adult male suffrage.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=284}}\n\n[[File:Social-democracy-before-ww2.svg|thumb|A timeline showing the development of [[History of the Social Democratic Party of Germany|social democracy in Germany]] before World War II]]\nThe ADAV's party newspaper was called ''The Social Democrat'' ({{lang-de|Der Sozialdemokrat}}). Marx and Engels responded to the title ''Sozialdemocrat'' with distaste and Engels once writing: \"But what a title: ''Sozialdemokrat''! [...] Why do they not call the thing simply ''The Proletarian''\". Marx agreed with Engels that ''Sozialdemokrat'' was a bad title.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=52}} Although the origins of the name ''Sozialdemokrat'' actually traced back to Marx's German translation in 1848 of the [[The Mountain (1849)|Democratic Socialist Party]] ({{lang-fr|Partie Democrat-Socialist}}) into the Party of Social Democracy ({{lang-de|link=no|Partei der Sozialdemokratie}}), Marx did not like this French party because he viewed it as dominated by the [[middle class]] and associated the word ''Sozialdemokrat'' with that party.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=53}} There was a Marxist faction within the ADAV represented by [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]], who became one of the editors of the ''Der Sozialdemokrat''.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=52}} While democrats looked to the Revolutions of 1848 as a [[democratic revolution]] which in the long run ensured [[liberty, equality and fraternity]], Marxists denounced 1848 as a betrayal of working-class ideals by a [[bourgeoisie]] indifferent to the legitimate demands of the proletariat.{{sfn|Gildea|2000|pp=207\u2013235}}\n\nFaced with opposition from liberal capitalists to his socialist policies, Lassalle controversially attempted to forge a tactical alliance with the [[Conservatism in Germany|conservative]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] [[Junkers]] due to their communitarian anti-bourgeois attitudes as well as with Prussian Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]].{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=284}} Friction in the ADAV arose over Lassalle's policy of a friendly approach to Bismarck that had incorrectly presumed that Bismarck would in turn be friendly towards them. This approach was opposed by the party's faction associated with Marx and Engels, including Liebknecht.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=53}} Opposition in the ADAV to Lassalle's friendly approach to Bismarck's government resulted in Liebknecht resigning from his position as editor of ''Die Sozialdemokrat'' and leaving the ADAV in 1865. In 1869, [[August Bebel]] and Liebknecht founded the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany]] (SDAP) as a merger of the [[petty-bourgeois]] [[Saxon People's Party]] (SVP), a faction of the ADAV and members of the League of German Workers' Associations (VDA).{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=53}}\n\nAlthough the SDAP was not officially Marxist, it was the first major working-class organization to be led by Marxists and both Marx and Engels had direct association with the party. The party adopted stances similar to those adopted by Marx at the First International. There was intense rivalry and antagonism between the SDAP and the ADAV, with the SDAP being highly hostile to the Prussian government while the ADAV pursued a reformist and more cooperative approach.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|pp=285\u2013286}} This rivalry reached its height involving the two parties' stances on the [[Franco-Prussian War]], with the SDAP refusing to support Prussia's war effort by claiming it was an [[imperialist]] war pursued by Bismarck while the ADAV supported the war as a defensive one because it saw Emperor [[Napoleon III]] and France as an \"overreacting aggressor\".{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|pp=285\u2013286}}{{sfn|Schmidt|2018|p=102}}\n\n[[File:Barricade18March1871.jpg|thumb|left|A Parisian barricade set up by revolutionary forces of the [[Paris Commune]] in March 1871]]\nIn the aftermath of the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, revolution broke out in France, with revolutionary army members along with working-class revolutionaries founding the [[Paris Commune]].{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=219}} The Paris Commune appealed both to the citizens of Paris regardless of class as well as to the working class, a major base of support for the government, via militant rhetoric. In spite of such militant rhetoric to appeal to the working class, the Paris Commune received substantial support from the middle-class bourgeoisie of Paris, including shopkeepers and merchants. In part due to its sizeable number neo-[[Proudhonian]]s and [[neo-Jacobin]]s in the Central Committee, the Paris Commune declared that it was not opposed to private property, but that it rather hoped to create the widest distribution of it.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=225}} The political composition of the Paris Commune included twenty-five neo-Jacobins, fifteen to twenty neo-Proudhonians and proto-[[syndicalists]], nine or ten Blanquists, a variety of [[Radicalism (historical)#France|radical republicans]] and a few members of the First International influenced by Marx.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=229}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the Paris Commune's collapse in 1871, Marx praised it in his work ''[[The Civil War in France]]'' (1871) for its achievements in spite of its pro-bourgeois influences and called it an excellent model of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in practice as it had dismantled the apparatus of the bourgeois state, including its huge bureaucracy, military and executive, judicial and legislative institutions, replacing it with a working-class state with broad popular support.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=256}} The Paris Commune's collapse and the persecution of its [[anarchist]] supporters had the effect of weakening the influence of the [[Bakuninist]] anarchists in the First International which resulted in Marx expelling the weakened rival Bakuninists from the International a year later.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=256}} In Britain, the achievement of the legalization of trade unions under the [[Trade Union Act 1871]] drew British trade unionists to believe that working conditions could be improved through parliamentary means.{{sfn|Ishay|2008|p=149}}\n\nAt the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]] of 1872, Marx made a remark in which he admitted that while there are countries \"where the workers can attain their goal by peaceful means\", in most European countries \"the lever of our revolution must be force\", arguing:{{sfn|Gray|Johnson|Walker|2014|pp=119\u2013120}} {{quote|You know that the institutions, mores, and traditions of various countries must be taken into consideration, and we do not deny that there are countries\u2014such as America, England, and if I were more familiar with your institutions, I would perhaps also add Holland\u2014where the workers can attain their goal by peaceful means.

In his work ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'', Marx himself later in his life acknowledged that the middle class was not disappearing, but his acknowledgement of this error is not well known due to the popularity of ''The Communist Manifesto'' and the relative obscurity of ''Theories of Surplus Value''.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|pp=249\u2013250}}\n\n[[File:Bernstein Eduard 1895.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Eduard Bernstein]], a notable [[Marxist revisionist]] who supported [[reformism]] and [[liberal democracy]]]]\nBernstein criticized Marxism's concept of \"irreconciliable class conflicts\" and Marxism's hostility to [[liberalism]].{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=133}} He challenged Marx's position on liberalism by claiming that [[Liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and social democrats held common grounds that he claimed could be utilized to create a socialist republic.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=133}} He believed that economic class disparities between the [[bourgeoisie]] and the [[proletariat]] would gradually be eliminated through legal reforms and economic redistribution programs.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=133}} Bernstein rejected the Marxian principle of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], claiming that gradualist democratic reforms would improve the rights of the [[working class]].{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=141}}\n\nAccording to Bernstein, social democracy did not seek to create a socialism separate from bourgeois society, but it instead sought to create a common development based on Western [[humanism]].{{sfn|Wright|1999|p=86}} The development of socialism under social democracy does not seek to rupture existing society and its cultural traditions, but to act as an enterprise of extension and growth.{{sfn|Wright|1999|p=88}} Furthermore, he believed that class cooperation was a preferable course to achieve socialism, rather than class conflict.{{sfn|Berman|2006|p=2}}\n\nBernstein responded to critics that he was not destroying Marxism and instead claimed he was modernizing it as it was required \"to separate the vital parts of Marx's theory from its outdated accessories\". He asserted his support for the Marxian conception of a \"scientifically based\" socialist movement and said that such a movement's goals must be determined in accordance with \"knowledge capable of objective proof, that is, knowledge which refers to, and conforms with, nothing but empirical knowledge and logic\".{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=96}}\n\nBernstein was also strongly opposed to [[dogmatism]] within the Marxist movement. Despite embracing a [[mixed economy]], Bernstein was skeptical and critical of [[welfare state]] policies, believing them to be helpful, but ultimately secondary to the main social democratic goal of replacing capitalism with socialism, fearing that state aid to the unemployed might lead to the sanctioning of a new form of [[pauperism]].{{sfn|Jackson|2008|ps=: \"Bernstein was also cautious about the use of social spending to ameliorate capitalism; he ranked what would later be called the 'welfare state' as a helpful intervention, but ultimately secondary to more decisive policies intended to attack the source of poverty and inequality.

Luxemburg likened Bernstein's policies to that of the dispute between Marxists and the opportunistic ''Praktiker'' (\"pragmatists\"). She denounced Bernstein's evolutionary socialism for being a \"petty-bourgeois vulgarization of Marxism\" and claimed that Bernstein's years of exile in Britain had made him lose familiarity with the situation in Germany, where he was promoting evolutionary socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=154}} Luxemburg sought to maintain social democracy as a revolutionary Marxist creed, writing: {{quote|[T]here could be no socialism\u2014at least in Germany\u2014outside of Marxist socialism, and there could be no socialist class struggle outside of social democracy.

Russian Marxist [[George Plekhanov]] joined Kautsky and Luxemburg in condemning Bernstein for having a neo-Kantian philosophy.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=96}} Kautsky and Luxemburg contended that Bernstein's empiricist viewpoints depersonalized and dehistoricized the social observer and reducing objects down to facts. Luxemburg associated Bernstein with [[Ethical socialism|ethical socialists]] who she identified as being associated with the bourgeoisie and Kantian liberalism.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=115}}\n\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848\u20131850|The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist reformists and revolutionaries in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist measures while maintaining his belief that revolutionary seizure of power by the proletariat should remain a goal. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the revisionists.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=182}}\n\nEngels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he stated that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us socialists all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}} Engels also said that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power that he predicted could bring \"social democracy into power as early as 1898\".{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}} Engels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}} Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}}\n\nEngels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and Kautsky in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism. While highlighting ''The Communist Manifesto'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\",{{sfn|Engels|Marx|1848|p=52}} Engels also wrote to Kautsky the following on 1 April 1895, four months before his death: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality ''quand m\u00eame''.{{efn|''Quand m\u00eame'' literally means \"come what may\", but it is better translated as \"at all costs\".}} Which is all the more reason why I should like it to appear in its entirety in the ''Neue Zeit'' in order that this disgraceful impression may be erased. I shall leave Liebknecht in no doubt as to what I think about it and the same applies to those who, irrespective of who they may be, gave him this opportunity of perverting my views and, what's more, without so much as a word to me about it.{{sfn|Engels|2004|p=86}}</blockquote>\n\nAfter delivering a lecture in Britain to the Fabian Society titled \"On What Marx Really Taught\" in 1897, Bernstein wrote a letter to the orthodox Marxist [[August Bebel]] in which he revealed that he felt conflicted with what he had said at the lecture as well as revealing his intentions regarding revision of Marxism, arguing: {{quote|[A]s I was reading the lecture, the thought shot through my head that I was doing Marx an injustice, that it was not Marx I was presenting. [...] I told myself secretly that this could not go on. It is idle to reconcile the irreconcilable. The vital thing is to be clear as to where Marx is still right and where he is not.{{sfn|Bernstein|2004|p=xix}}}}\n\nWhat Bernstein meant was that he believed that Marx was wrong in assuming that the capitalist economy would collapse as a result of its internal contradictions as by the mid-1890s there was little evidence of such internal contradictions causing this to capitalism.{{sfn|Bernstein|2004|p=xix}}\n\n[[File:Jean-Jaur\u00e8s01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]], a pacifist socialist and one of the historical leaders of the [[French Section of the Workers' International]]]]\nThe dispute over policies in favour of reform or revolution dominated discussions at the 1899 Hanover Party Conference of the [[History of the Social Democratic Party of Germany|Socialist Workers' Party of Germany]] (SAPD). This issue had become especially prominent with the Millerand affair in France in which [[Alexandre Millerand]] of the [[Independent Socialists (France)|Independent Socialists]] joined the non-socialist and liberal government of Prime Minister Waldeck-Rousseau without seeking support from his party's leadership.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=154}} Millerand's actions provoked outrage amongst revolutionary socialists within the Second International, including the anarchist left and [[Jules Guesde]]'s revolutionary Marxists.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=154}}\n\nIn response to these disputes over reform or revolution, the 1900 Paris Congress of the Second International declared a resolution to the dispute in which Guesde's demands were partially accepted in a resolution drafted by Kautsky that declared that overall socialists should not take part in a non-socialist government, but he provided exceptions to this rule where necessary to provide the \"protection of the achievements of the working class\".{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=154}}\n\nAnother prominent figure who influenced social democracy was French revisionist Marxist and reformist socialist [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]]. During the 1904 Congress of the [[Second International]], Jaur\u00e8s challenged orthodox Marxist August Bebel, the mentor of Kautsky, over his promotion of monolithic socialist tactics. He claimed that no coherent socialist platform could be equally applicable to different countries and regions due to different political systems in them, noting that Bebel's homeland of Germany at the time was very authoritarian and had limited parliamentary democracy.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=47}}\n\nJaur\u00e8s compared the limited political influence of socialism in government in Germany to the substantial influence that socialism had gained in France due to its stronger parliamentary democracy. He claimed that the example of the political differences between Germany and France demonstrated that monolithic socialist tactics were impossible, given the political differences of various countries.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=47}}\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Australian Labor Party]] formed the world's first labour party government as well as the world's first social democratic government at a national level in 1910.

After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 in Russia (not to be confused with the [[October Revolution]]) in which the Tsarist regime in Russia was overthrown, MacDonald visited the [[Russian Provisional Government]] in June 1917, seeking to persuade Russia to oppose the war and seek peace.

The strikers demanded bread, freedom, peace and the formation of [[workers' council]]s as was being done in Russia. Amidst the German public's uproar, the SPD alongside the [[Progressive People's Party (Germany)|Progressives]] and the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic]] labour movement in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] put forward the [[Reichstag Peace Resolution|Peace Resolution]] on 19 July 1917 that called for a compromise peace to end the war which was passed by a majority of members of the Reichstag.{{sfn|Chickering|p=155}}\n\nThe German High Command opposed the Peace Resolution, but it did seek to end the war with Russia and presented the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] to the [[Bolshevik government]] in 1918 that agreed to the terms and the Reichstag passed the treaty which included the support of the SPD, the Progressives and the Catholic political movement.{{sfn|Chickering|p=155}}\n\nBy late 1918, the war situation for Germany had become hopeless and [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] was pressured to make peace. Wilhelm II appointed a new cabinet that included SPD members. At the same time, the Imperial Naval Command was determined to make a heroic last stand against the British [[Royal Navy]].

The situation soon went completely out of control when the recruited Freikorps went on a violent rampage against workers and murdered the communist leaders [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]]. The atrocities by the government-recruited Freikorps against the communist revolutionaries badly tarnished the reputation of the SPD and strengthened the confidence of reactionary forces.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=145}}\n\nIn spite of this, the SPD was able to win the largest number of seats in the [[1919 German federal election|parliamentary election held on 19 January 1919]] and Ebert was elected [[president of Germany]].

MacDonald viewed the situation as a crisis, consulting the unions in advance to warn them that his government would have to use strikebreakers if the situation continued. The anticipated clash between the government and the unions was averted, but the situation alienated the unions from the MacDonald government, whose most controversial action was having Britain recognize the Soviet Union in February 1924. The British conservative tabloid press, including the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', used this to promote a [[red scare]] by claiming that the Labour government's recognition of the Soviet Union proved that Labour held pro-Bolshevik sympathies.{{sfn|Jeffreys|1999|p=29}}\n\nThe Labour Party lost the 1924 general election and a Conservative government was elected. Although MacDonald faced multiple challenges to his leadership of the party, the Labour Party stabilized as a capable opposition to the Conservative government by 1927. MacDonald released a new political programme for the party titled ''Labour and the Nation'' (1928). The Labour Party returned to government in 1929, but it soon had to deal with the economic catastrophe of the stock market crash of 1929.{{sfn|Jeffreys|1999|p=29}}\n\n[[File:Rudolf Hilferding and Gattin, cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rudolf Hilferding]], a major figure and policymaker in the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] and the Czechoslovak [[Sopade]]]]\nIn the 1920s, SPD policymaker and Marxist [[Rudolf Hilferding]] proposed substantial policy changes in the SPD as well as influencing social democratic and socialist theory.

Organized capitalism was based upon [[Trust (monopoly)|trusts]] and [[cartel]]s controlled by financial institutions that could no longer make profit within their countries' national boundaries and therefore needed to export to survive, resulting in support for imperialism.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=56}}\n\nHilferding described that while early capitalism promoted itself as peaceful and based on free trade, the era of organized capitalism was aggressive and said that \"in the place of humanity there came the idea of the strength and power of the state\". He said that this had the consequence of creating effective collectivization within capitalism and had prepared the way for socialism.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=57}}\n\nOriginally, Hilferding's vision of a socialism replacing organized capitalism was highly Kautskyan in assuming an either/or perspective and expecting a catastrophic clash between organized capitalism versus socialism. By the 1920s, Hilferding became an adherent to promoting a gradualist evolution of capitalism into socialism. He then praised organised capitalism for being a step towards socialism, saying at the SPD congress in 1927 that organised capitalism is nothing less than \"the replacement of the capitalist principle of free competition by the socialist principle of planned production\". He went on to say that \"the problem is posed to our generation: with the help of the state, with the help of conscious social direction, to transform the economy organized and led by capitalists into an economy directed by the democratic state\".{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=57}}\n\nIn the 1930s, the SPD began to transition away from revisionist Marxism towards liberal socialism beginning in the 1930s. After the party was banned by the Nazis in 1933, the SPD acted in exile through [[Sopade]].{{sfn|Edinger|1956|p=215}} In 1934, the Sopade began to publish material that indicated that the SPD was turning towards liberal socialism.

Whereas the 1921\u20131923 SAP governments had run large deficits, the new SAP government reduced Sweden's budget deficit after a strong increase in state expenditure in 1933 and the resulting economic recovery. The government had planned to eliminate Sweden's budget deficit in seven years, but it took only three years to eliminate the deficit and Sweden had a budget surplus from 1936 to 1938.

However, some within the party were displeased about the changing focus of the party, most notably [[John A.

Economists [[Pranab Bardhan]] and [[John Roemer]] argue that Soviet-type economies failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of state enterprises in their administrative, command allocation of resources and commodities and the lack of democracy in the political systems that the Soviet-type economies were combined with.

Several explanations for the European decline have been proposed.

According to Dostal, the SPD subsequently lost half of its former electoral coalition (i.e. blue-collar voters and socially disadvantaged groups) while efforts to attract centrist and middle-class voters failed to produce any compensating gains.

with a socialist system.{{sfn|Clarke|1981|p=2}} According to this view, social democracy fails to address the systemic issues inherent in capitalism. The American democratic socialist philosopher [[David Schweickart]] contrasts social democracy with [[democratic socialism]] by defining the former as an attempt to strengthen the [[welfare state]] and the latter as an alternative economic system to capitalism. According to Schweickart, the democratic socialist critique of social democracy is that capitalism can never be sufficiently humanised and that any attempt to suppress its economic contradictions will only cause them to emerge elsewhere. He gives the example that attempts to reduce unemployment too much would result in inflation and too much job security would erode labour discipline.{{sfn|Schweickart|2007|p=447|ps=: \"Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state\u2014pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance. They supported and tried to strengthen the labor movement. The latter, as socialists, argued that capitalism could never be sufficiently humanized and that trying to suppress the economic contradictions in one area would only see them emerge in a different guise elsewhere (e.g., if you push unemployment too low, you'll get inflation; if job security is too strong, labor discipline breaks down.)\"}} In contrast to social democracy's [[mixed economy]], democratic socialists advocate a [[post-capitalist]] economic system based on either a [[Market economy#Market socialism|market economy]] combined with [[workers' self-management]], or on some form of [[Participatory economy|participatory]], [[decentralized planning]] of the economy.{{sfn|Schweickart|2007|p=448|ps=: \"Some have endorsed the concept of market socialism, a postcapitalist economy that retains market competition but socializes the means of production and, in some versions, extends democracy to the workplace. Some hold out for a nonmarket, participatory economy. All democratic socialists agree on the need for a democratic alternative to capitalism.\"}}\n\n[[Marxian economics|Marxian]] socialists argue that social democratic welfare policies cannot resolve the fundamental structural issues of capitalism such as [[Business cycle#Marxian economics|cyclical fluctuations]], [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|exploitation]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]. Accordingly, social democratic programs intended to ameliorate living conditions in capitalism\u2014such as unemployment benefits and taxation on profits\u2014creates further contradictions by further limiting the efficiency of the capitalist system by reducing incentives for capitalists to invest in further production.{{sfn|Ticktin|1998|pp=60\u201361|ps=: \"The Marxist answers that [...] it involves limiting the incentive system of the market through providing minimum wages, high levels of unemployment insurance, reducing the size of the reserve army of labour, taxing profits, and taxing the wealthy. As a result, capitalists will have little incentive to invest and the workers will have little incentive to work. Capitalism works because, as Marx remarked, it is a system of economic force (coercion).\"}} The welfare state only serves to legitimize and prolong the exploitative and contradiction-laden system of capitalism to society's detriment. Critics of contemporary social democracy such as Jonas Hinnfors argue that when social democracy abandoned [[Marxism]] it also abandoned socialism and became a liberal capitalist movement, effectively making social democrats similar to non-socialist parties like the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the United States.{{sfn|Hinnfors|2006|pp=117, 137\u2013139}}\n\n[[Market socialism]] is also critical of social democratic welfare states. While one common goal of both concepts is to achieve greater social and economic equality, market socialism does so by changes in enterprise ownership and management whereas social democracy attempts to do so by subsidies and taxes on privately owned enterprises to finance welfare programs. [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt III]] (grandson of United States president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]) and David Belkin criticize social democracy for maintaining a [[Property income|property-owning capitalist class]] which has an active interest in reversing social democratic welfare policies and a disproportionate amount of power as a class to influence government policy.{{sfn|Weisskopf|1994|pp=314\u2013315|ps=: \"Social democracy achieves greater egalitarianism via ''ex post'' government taxes and subsidies, where market socialism does so via ''ex ante'' changes in patterns of enterprise ownership [...] the maintenance of property-owning capitalists under social democracy assures the presence of a disproportionately powerful class with a continuing interest in challenging social democratic government policies.\"}} The economists [[John Roemer]] and [[Pranab Bardhan]] point out that social democracy requires a strong [[labour movement]] to sustain its heavy redistribution through taxes and that it is idealistic to think such redistribution can be accomplished in other countries with weaker labour movements, noting that social democracy in Scandinavian countries has been in decline as the labour movement weakened.{{sfn|Bardhan|Roemer|1992|p=104|ps=: \"Since it permits a powerful capitalist class to exist (90 percent of productive assets are privately owned in Sweden), only a strong and unified labor movement can win the redistribution through taxes that is characteristic of social democracy. It is idealistic to believe that tax concessions of this magnitude can be effected simply through electoral democracy without an organized labour movement, when capitalists organize and finance influential political parties. Even in the Scandinavian countries, strong apex labor organizations have been difficult to sustain and social democracy is somewhat on the decline now.\"}}\n\nSome critics claim that social democracy abandoned socialism in the 1930s by endorsing Keynesian [[welfare capitalism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Wright|1y=1999|1pp=91|2a1=Fitzpatrick|2y=2003|2pp=2\u20133}} The democratic socialist political theorist [[Michael Harrington]] argues that social democracy historically supported [[Keynesianism]] as part of a \"social democratic compromise\" between capitalism and socialism. This compromise created welfare states and Harrington contends that although this compromise did not allow for the immediate creation of socialism, it \"recognized noncapitalist, and even anticapitalist, principles of human need over and above the imperatives of profit\".{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=93}} More recently, social democrats in favour of the [[Third Way]] have been accused of having endorsed capitalism, including by anti-Third Way social democrats who have accused Third Way proponents such as [[Anthony Giddens]] of being anti-social democratic and anti-socialist in practice.{{sfn|Cammack|2004|p=155}}\n\nSocial democracy's reformism has been criticized from both the left and right,{{sfnm|1a1=Socialist Party of Great Britain|1y=2002|2a1=Patnaik|2y=2010|2pp=3\u201321|3a1=Nagin|3y=2018}} for if the left was to govern a capitalist economy, it would have to do so according to capitalist, not socialist, logic. This argument was previously echoed by [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in ''[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]'' (1942), writing: \"Socialists had to govern in an essentially capitalist world [...], a social and economic system that would not function except on capitalist lines. [...] If they were to run it, they would have to run it according to its own logic. They would have to \"administer\" capitalism\".{{sfn|Romano|2006|p=114}} Similarly, [[Irving Kristol]] argued: \"Democratic socialism turns out to be an inherently unstable compound, a contradiction in terms. Every social-democratic party, once in power, soon finds itself choosing, at one point after another, between the socialist society it aspires to and the liberal society that lathered it\".{{sfn|Barrett|1978}} [[Joseph Stalin]] was a vocal critic of reformist social democracy, later coining the term [[social fascism]] to describe social democracy in the 1930s because in this period social democracy embraced a similar [[Corporatism|corporatist economic model]] to the model supported by [[fascism]]. This view was adopted by the [[Communist International]]. It was argued that capitalist society had entered the [[Third Period]] in which a [[proletarian revolution]] was imminent, but it could be prevented by social democrats and other fascist forces.{{sfn|Haro|2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[History of socialism]]\n* [[International Group of Democratic Socialists]]\n* [[List of anti-capitalist and communist parties with national parliamentary representation]]\n* [[List of democratic socialist parties that have governed]]\n* [[List of democratic socialist parties and organizations]]\n* [[List of democratic socialists]]\n* [[List of social democratic parties]]\n* [[List of social democrats]]\n* [[Socialist Party]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{notelist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n==== Books ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book|last=Abjorensen|first=Norman|year=2019|title=Historical Dictionary of Democracy|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9781538120743|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=1993|title=Political Ideology Today|series=Politics Today|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978071903346-9|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=2001|title=Political Ideology Today|edition=2nd|series=Politics Today|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719060199|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|editor1-last=Aggarwal|editor1-first=J.

In the post-Mao China, the Chinese intellectuals are confronted with a variety of models. The liberals favor the American model and share the view that the Soviet model has become archaic and should be totally abandoned. Meanwhile, democratic socialism in Sweden provided an alternative model. Its sustained economic development and extensive welfare programs fascinated many. Numerous scholars within the democratic socialist camp argue that China should model itself politically and economically on Sweden, which is viewed as more genuinely socialist than China.

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

Truman Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=10 February 2020|quote=The directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite web|author=Vision of Humanity|date=June 2019|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2019/06/GPI-2019-web003.pdf|title=Global Peace Index 2019|website=Vision of Humanity|publisher=Institute for Economics & Peace|accessdate=4 February 2020|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite web|author=Wisconsin Historical Society|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=9192&search_term=socialism|title=Socialism in Milwaukee|work=Dictionary of Wisconsin History|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104021609/https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=9192&search_term=socialism|archive-date=4 November 2012|accessdate=20 December 2019|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book|last1=Brandal|first1=Nik|last2=Bratberg|first2=\u00d8ivind|last3=Thorsen|first3=Dag Einar|year=2013|title=The Nordic Model of Social Democracy|location=Basingstoke, England|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137013262}}\n: {{cite book|year=2011|editor1-last=Cronin|editor1-first=James E.|editor2-last=Ross|editor2-first=George W.|editor3-last=Shoch|editor3-first=James|title=What's Left of the Left: Democrats and Social Democrats in Challenging Times|location=Durham, North Carolina|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822350798}}\n: {{cite book|editor1-last=Evans|editor1-first=Bryan|editor2-last=Schmidt|editor2-first=Ingo|year=2012|title=Social Democracy After the Cold War|location=Edmonton, Alberta|publisher=Athabasca University Press|isbn=9781926836874}}\n: {{cite book|last=Kenworthy|first=Lane|year=2014|title=Social Democratic America|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199322510}}\n: {{cite book|last=Lavelle|first=Ashley|year=2008|title=The Death of Social Democracy: Political Consequences in the 21st Century|location=Aldershot, England|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9780754670148}}\n: {{cite web|last=Martell|first=Luke|year=2011|url=http://www.policy-network.net/pno_detail.aspx?ID=4089|title=Conflicts in Cosmopolitanism and the Global Left|location=London|publisher=Policy Network|accessdate=3 August 2016}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Sachs|first=Jeffrey D.|year=2006|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&articleID=000AF3D5-6DC9-152E-A9F183414B7F0000&colID=31|journal=Scientific American|title=The Social Welfare State, beyond Ideology|volume=295|issue=5|page=42|location=New York|issn=0036-8733|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012141326/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&articleID=000AF3D5-6DC9-152E-A9F183414B7F0000&colID=31|archivedate=12 October 2007|accessdate=2 August 2016}}\n: {{cite web|last1=Thorsen|first1=Dag Einar|last2=Brandal|first2=Nik|last3=Bratberg|first3=\u00d8ivind|year=2013|url=http://www.fabians.org.uk/utopia-sustained-the-nordic-model-of-social-democracy/|title=Utopia Sustained: The Nordic Model of Social Democracy|location=London|publisher=Fabian Society|accessdate=2 August 2016}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Social democracy}}\n{{Library resources box}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.misc-iecm.mcgill.ca/socdem/epaper.htm|title=Papers on the Future of Social Democracy in Canada|publisher=McGill Institute for the Study of Canada|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060412171332/http://www.misc-iecm.mcgill.ca/socdem/epaper.htm|archive-date=12 April 2006|accessdate=11 February 2020}}\n* {{cite web|last=Shaw|first=Martin|year=1999|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/hafa3/socdem.htm|title=Social democracy in the unfinished global revolution|publisher=University of Sussex|accessdate=11 February 2020}}\n\n{{social democracy}}\n{{socialism}}\n{{subject bar|portal1=Society|portal2=Socialism|commons=yes|commons-search=Category:Social democracy|wikt=yes|q=yes|d=yes|d-search=Q121254}}\n{{authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Social Democracy}}\n[[Category:Democracy]]\n[[Category:Democratic socialism]]\n[[Category:Economic ideologies]]\n[[Category:Political ideologies]]\n[[Category:Social democracy| ]]\n[[Category:Social justice]]\n[[Category:Social philosophy|Democracy]]\n[[Category:Socialism]]\n[[Category:Types of socialism]]\n", "name_user": "Davide King", "label": "safe", "comment": "ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy"}
