He would also tour in [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW).\n\nWrestling as The Tasmaniac, Senerchia had his first [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) match on August 19, 1991, when he was defeated by [[Ray Odyssey]]. Appearing as The Tazmaniac, he then made his only appearance ever in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) when he defeated [[Joey Maggs]] in a dark match at a ''[[WCW Saturday Night|Saturday Night]]'' taping in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] on February 8, 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw93.htm |title=WCW 1993 |publisher=Thehistoryofwwe.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-22}}</ref> He would then make his second appearance in the WWF on May 5, 1993. Wrestling in a dark match at a Wrestling Challenge taping in Portland, ME, Tazmaniac would beat [[Scotty 2 Hotty|Scott Taylor]]. He would go on to make two additional appearances on [[house show]]s in [[New Jersey]] on June 29 and June 30, losing to [[Jim Powers]] on each occasion.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/93.htm</ref>\n\n=== NWA Eastern / Extreme Championship Wrestling ===\n==== Early years and injury (1993\u20131995) ====\nIn October 1993, he and Joe Chetti (brother of [[Chris Chetti]]) debuted in the [[Philadelphia]]-based Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW), prior to its name change to [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]], as the [[tag team]] The Tazmaniacs.<ref name=\"OwW\"/> When that team broke up, he was put into another team with [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]], with whom he won the [[ECW World Tag Team Championship|Tag Team Championship]] twice.<ref name=\"ECWTT\"/><ref name=\"WT-ECWTT\"/> During his second reign as Tag Team Champion with Sullivan, The Tazmaniac became a double champion when he also won the [[ECW World Television Championship|Television Championship]] for one night in March 1994.<ref name=\"WT-ECWTV\"/> For most of the rest of the year he floated around the tag ranks, teaming with different partners. He held the title once more, this time with [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]], until Sabu was [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimately]] fired by ECW owner [[Paul Heyman]] for [[No-show (professional wrestling)|no-showing]] an event in favor of touring Japan for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]].<ref name=\"Houseofhardcore\">{{cite video|date=November 16, 2004|title=[[The Rise and Fall of ECW|Rise and Fall of ECW, The]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE Home Video]]}}</ref> In August 1994, The Tazmaniac competed in a [[NWA World Title Tournament|one-night eight-man tournament]] for the vacant [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], losing to [[Shane Douglas]] in the quarter-finals.<ref name=\"Williams2013\">{{cite book|author=Scott E.

On July 15, during a tag team match [[2 Cold Scorpio]] and [[Dean Malenko]] delivered a [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Aided piledriver|spike piledriver]] to him, and though he knew it was about to be performed, he did not have time to properly protect himself. As he explained on the DVD documentary ''[[The Rise and Fall of ECW]]'', \"I landed right on my forehead and just jacked my whole neck back and that was it.\" The neck injury was so bad that, according to [[Tommy Dreamer]], hospital staff couldn't believe he'd walked into the hospital where he sought help after the match. Though he was unable to wrestle, Paul Heyman continued to pay him per their oral agreement, forging a loyalty between the men.<ref name=\"Houseofhardcore\"/>\n\n==== Rise to superstardom (1995\u20131996) ====\nFollowing his neck injury, Taz made appearances with [[The Steiner Brothers]], even standing in their corner during matches with [[The Eliminators]] and getting physical with [[Jason Knight|Jason]]. It was at the [[November to Remember (1995)|November to Remember]] event, when Taz turned heel and joined up with referee [[Bill Alfonso]]. Working as the special referee for Alfonso's match with ECW commissioner [[Tod Gordon]], Taz refused to count to three and assaulted Gordon, then making the count for Alfonso. In his post-match promo, he claimed that no one was looking after him while he was injured and that no one cared (though Heyman was still paying him, the [[kayfabe]] story was that he had been forgotten and that Alfonso was the one helping him keep food on his family's table). He was also angry that Sabu was brought back in that very night.\n\nTaz returned to the ring on December 19, 1995 at Holiday Hell with a new look and wrestling style. The new character had him clad in a black/orange [[wiktionary:singlet|singlet]] and exhibiting a more physically intense in-ring style, focusing his offense on mat wrestling and [[suplex]]es (inspired by working with The Steiner Brothers), which announcer [[Joey Styles]] dubbed ''[[#In wrestling|Taz-Plexes]]'', earning him the nickname \"The Human Suplex Machine\". He also debuted his ''[[Professional wrestling holds#Half nelson choke|Tazmission]]''/Katahajime finishing maneuver, causing opponents to [[Submission (combat sport)|tap out]] to signal their submission as in [[mixed martial arts]] instead of nodding their head or vocally saying \"yes\". This quirk was soon picked up by other companies throughout the country.<ref>{{cite episode|title=12/17/95|series=History of ECW|network=[[WWE Classics On Demand]]| airdate=2007-08-14}}</ref> Heading into the summer, Taz began feuding with Tommy Dreamer, joining up with [[Brian Lee (wrestler)|Brian Lee]] to face Dreamer and [[Terry Gordy]] and later Dreamer and [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams]]. Taz also developed a friendship with The Eliminators, based on mutual respect, and they occasionally involved themselves in his matches. [[Perry Saturn]] and Taz were both trainers at ECW's [[House of Hardcore]] wrestling school. For a while, some of the students, including Mako and [[Chris Chetti]], would accompany Taz and Alfonso to the ring as a faction known as Team Taz.<ref name=\"Houseofhardcore\"/>\n\nAt [[November to Remember (1996)|November to Remember]], things seemed to come full circle, as Taz stormed to the ring and interrupted Styles and \"stole Paul E.'s thunder\" by announcing that there would be a \"big show in the first quarter of the new year\", basically telling the fans in attendance that ECW's first [[pay-per-view]] was on the horizon. At that \"big show\", he guaranteed that Sabu would finally face him. Later that night, he came out to force Scorpio to leave the ring and went on an angry tirade, abusing Bob Artese and holding him hostage in the ring. Taz demanded Sabu come out and face him, and twice even led the crowd in a \"Sabu, Sabu\" chant to get him to enter the ring.  Several officials and wrestlers came out and Taz eventually got his hands on Paul E. The lights went out and when they came back on, Sabu was in the ring, across from Taz. This was the first time they had been in the ring together since early 1995. Before they could lock up, the lights went out again.\n\nDuring Sabu's match, where he teamed with [[Rob Van Dam]] to face The Eliminators and [[The Gangstas]] in a three-way dance, Taz attempted to attack his former partner, but Van Dam saved Sabu and was choked out in the aisle. This distraction caused Sabu to get hit with ''Total Elimination'' and his team lost. Taz also began a mini-feud with Rob Van Dam, dominating him in every match and was also out for a short time to get surgery on his injured shoulder. As 1996 ended and 1997 began, Taz and Sabu continued to try getting at one another, with no actual contact.\n\n==== World Television Champion (1997\u20131998) ====\nEarly in 1997, the antagonism between Sabu and Taz was growing, as Taz attacked Sabu's partner, Rob Van Dam, costing the team matches with The Eliminators and other teams. In the months leading to ECW's [[ECW Barely Legal|first pay-per-view]], Taz would choke out low-level wrestlers with the ''Tazmission'' due to viewing his matches as secondary to his rivalry with Sabu. He then dominated another series of matches with Van Dam before meeting Sabu at [[ECW Barely Legal|Barely Legal]], where Taz defeated him with the ''Tazmission'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1997b.html#041397|title=Barely Legal 1997 results| accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> only to have his [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[Bill Alfonso]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] on him and join Sabu and his partner [[Rob Van Dam]].<ref name=\"slambio\"/> In response, Taz began teaming with [[Chris Candido]] to face Sabu and Van Dam.\n\nTwo months later at [[Wrestlepalooza (1997)|Wrestlepalooza]], Taz lost to Sabu in the rematch, marking his first loss since 1995. However, later in the night, he won the World Television Championship from [[Shane Douglas]] to begin his second reign.<ref name=\"WT-ECWTV\"/> He defended the title against all comers, including Douglas, [[Lance Storm]], [[John Kronus]], [[Al Snow]], [[Jerry Lynn]] and [[Chris Candido]]. Throughout late 1997, Taz began feuding with The Triple Threat in addition to Sabu and Van Dam, where he sometimes teamed up with [[Tommy Dreamer]] during the feud. At [[November to Remember (1997)|November to Remember]], he issued a challenge to World Heavyweight Champion Bam Bam Bigelow. The two would eventually meet, after Bigelow turned on Taz in a match against Shane Douglas and Chris Candido. Taz would ultimately lose the title to [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] at [[Living Dangerously (1998)|Living Dangerously]] on March 1, 1998.\n\nAfter losing the World Television Championship, Taz was elevated into the World Heavyweight Championship picture. In May 1998, with Shane Douglas injured and unable to wrestle, Taz was given an old World Television Championship belt painted orange\u2014his trademark color\u2014and began [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|cutting promos]], declaring himself the [[ECW FTW Heavyweight Championship|FTW Heavyweight Champion]] at [[It Ain't Seinfeld]]. Though the championship was unsanctioned [[Kayfabe|in storyline]], it was defended at ECW shows until Douglas was healthy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1998c.html#080298|title=Heat Wave 1998 results|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Just before winning the World Heavyweight Championship, Taz \"gave\" the FTW Heavyweight Title to long-time foe Sabu in a match where he physically pulled Sabu on top of him to allow him to get the pin.<ref name=\"SolieFTW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/ftwecw.html|title=Fuck The World title history|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Solie's Title Histories}}</ref>\n\n==== World Heavyweight Champion and departure (1999) ====\nTaz finally defeated Shane Douglas for the World Heavyweight Championship at [[Guilty as Charged (1999)|Guilty as Charged]], thus ending Douglas' year-long reign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1999a.html#011099|title=Guilty as Charged 1999 results|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Taz was supposed to defend the title against [[Chris Candido]] in his first televised title defense at [[House Party (1999)|House Party]] but Douglas attacked Candido before the match and took his place, whom Taz defeated to retain the title in his first successful title defense. He would then begin a feud with Sabu over Taz's World Heavyweight Championship and Sabu's FTW Heavyweight Championship. The rivalry culminated in a title unification match at the [[Living Dangerously (1999)|Living Dangerously]] pay-per-view, where Taz defeated Sabu to unify the FTW Heavyweight Championship into the World Heavyweight Championship. He would begin his next rivalry with Chris Candido, whom he defeated to retain the title at [[CyberSlam (1999)|CyberSlam]]. The two were scheduled to a rematch at [[Hardcore Heaven (1999)|Hardcore Heaven]], which Taz quickly won. However, he was attacked by [[Dudley Boyz]] after the match, leading to a title defense against [[Bubba Ray Dudley|Buh Buh Ray Dudley]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|falls count anywhere match]] in the main event later that night, which Taz won to retain the title. Taz then successfully defended the title against Candido on the June 4 episode of ''Hardcore TV'' to end the rivalry.\n\nTaz made his next successful title defense against [[Spike Dudley]] in a Falls Count Anywhere match on the June 25 episode of ''Hardcore TV''. He would begin feuding with the members of [[Steve Corino]]'s [[The Network (professional wrestling)|new rising stable]], primarily [[Yoshihiro Tajiri]]. Taz successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Tajiri at [[Hostile City Showdown (1999)|Hostile City Showdown]], the [[Heat Wave (1999)|Heat Wave]] pay-per-view and the September 3 episode of ''[[ECW on TNN]]''. During that time, Taz signed with the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]], losing the title as the first man eliminated in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|three-way dance]] at [[Anarchy Rulz (1999)|Anarchy Rulz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1999c.html#091999|title=Anarchy Rulz 1999 results|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher= Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> This ended his eight-month reign at 252 days. As he walked out of the ring, a large portion of the ECW locker room joined him on the entrance ramp to give him an emotional sendoff. After being off of ECW television for most of the fall, he wrestled one final match as an ECW performer at [[November to Remember (1999)|November to Remember]], losing to [[Rob Van Dam]] via [[Pin (wrestling)|pinfall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1999d.html#110799|title=November to Remember 1999 results|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Taz's final televised match in ECW aired on the November 13 episode of ''Hardcore TV'', in which he received a rematch against Mike Awesome for the World Heavyweight Championship, which he lost.

He held the title once more, this time with [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]], until Sabu was [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimately]] fired by ECW owner [[Paul Heyman]] for [[No-show (professional wrestling)|no-showing]] an event in favor of touring Japan for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]].<ref name=\"Houseofhardcore\">{{cite video|date=November 16, 2004|title=[[The Rise and Fall of ECW|Rise and Fall of ECW, The]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE Home Video]]}}</ref> In August 1994, The Tazmaniac competed in a [[NWA World Title Tournament|one-night eight-man tournament]] for the vacant [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], losing to [[Shane Douglas]] in the quarter-finals.<ref name=\"Williams2013\">{{cite book|author=Scott E.

On July 15, during a tag team match [[2 Cold Scorpio]] and [[Dean Malenko]] delivered a [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Aided piledriver|spike piledriver]] to him, and though he knew it was about to be performed, he did not have time to properly protect himself. As he explained on the DVD documentary ''[[The Rise and Fall of ECW]]'', \"I landed right on my forehead and just jacked my whole neck back and that was it.\" The neck injury was so bad that, according to [[Tommy Dreamer]], hospital staff couldn't believe he'd walked into the hospital where he sought help after the match. Though he was unable to wrestle, Paul Heyman continued to pay him per their oral agreement, forging a loyalty between the men.<ref name=\"Houseofhardcore\"/>\n\n==== Rise to superstardom (1995\u20131996) ====\nFollowing his neck injury, Taz made appearances with [[The Steiner Brothers]], even standing in their corner during matches with [[The Eliminators]] and getting physical with [[Jason Knight|Jason]]. It was at the [[November to Remember (1995)|November to Remember]] event, when Taz turned heel and joined up with referee [[Bill Alfonso]]. Working as the special referee for Alfonso's match with ECW commissioner [[Tod Gordon]], Taz refused to count to three and assaulted Gordon, then making the count for Alfonso. In his post-match promo, he claimed that no one was looking after him while he was injured and that no one cared (though Heyman was still paying him, the [[kayfabe]] story was that he had been forgotten and that Alfonso was the one helping him keep food on his family's table). He was also angry that Sabu was brought back in that very night.\n\nTaz returned to the ring on December 19, 1995 at Holiday Hell with a new look and wrestling style. The new character had him clad in a black/orange [[wiktionary:singlet|singlet]] and exhibiting a more physically intense in-ring style, focusing his offense on mat wrestling and [[suplex]]es (inspired by working with The Steiner Brothers), which announcer [[Joey Styles]] dubbed ''[[#In wrestling|Taz-Plexes]]'', earning him the nickname \"The Human Suplex Machine\". He also debuted his ''[[Professional wrestling holds#Half nelson choke|Tazmission]]''/Katahajime finishing maneuver, causing opponents to [[Submission (combat sport)|tap out]] to signal their submission as in [[mixed martial arts]] instead of nodding their head or vocally saying \"yes\". This quirk was soon picked up by other companies throughout the country.<ref>{{cite episode|title=12/17/95|series=History of ECW|network=[[WWE Classics On Demand]]| airdate=2007-08-14}}</ref> Heading into the summer, Taz began feuding with Tommy Dreamer, joining up with [[Brian Lee (wrestler)|Brian Lee]] to face Dreamer and [[Terry Gordy]] and later Dreamer and [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams]]. Taz also developed a friendship with The Eliminators, based on mutual respect, and they occasionally involved themselves in his matches. [[Perry Saturn]] and Taz were both trainers at ECW's [[House of Hardcore]] wrestling school. For a while, some of the students, including Mako and [[Chris Chetti]], would accompany Taz and Alfonso to the ring as a faction known as Team Taz.<ref name=\"Houseofhardcore\"/>\n\nAt [[November to Remember (1996)|November to Remember]], things seemed to come full circle, as Taz stormed to the ring and interrupted Styles and \"stole Paul E.'s thunder\" by announcing that there would be a \"big show in the first quarter of the new year\", basically telling the fans in attendance that ECW's first [[pay-per-view]] was on the horizon. At that \"big show\", he guaranteed that Sabu would finally face him. Later that night, he came out to force Scorpio to leave the ring and went on an angry tirade, abusing Bob Artese and holding him hostage in the ring. Taz demanded Sabu come out and face him, and twice even led the crowd in a \"Sabu, Sabu\" chant to get him to enter the ring.  Several officials and wrestlers came out and Taz eventually got his hands on Paul E. The lights went out and when they came back on, Sabu was in the ring, across from Taz. This was the first time they had been in the ring together since early 1995. Before they could lock up, the lights went out again.\n\nDuring Sabu's match, where he teamed with [[Rob Van Dam]] to face The Eliminators and [[The Gangstas]] in a three-way dance, Taz attempted to attack his former partner, but Van Dam saved Sabu and was choked out in the aisle. This distraction caused Sabu to get hit with ''Total Elimination'' and his team lost. Taz also began a mini-feud with Rob Van Dam, dominating him in every match and was also out for a short time to get surgery on his injured shoulder. As 1996 ended and 1997 began, Taz and Sabu continued to try getting at one another, with no actual contact.\n\n==== World Television Champion (1997\u20131998) ====\nEarly in 1997, the antagonism between Sabu and Taz was growing, as Taz attacked Sabu's partner, Rob Van Dam, costing the team matches with The Eliminators and other teams. In the months leading to ECW's [[ECW Barely Legal|first pay-per-view]], Taz would choke out low-level wrestlers with the ''Tazmission'' due to viewing his matches as secondary to his rivalry with Sabu. He then dominated another series of matches with Van Dam before meeting Sabu at [[ECW Barely Legal|Barely Legal]], where Taz defeated him with the ''Tazmission'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1997b.html#041397|title=Barely Legal 1997 results| accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> only to have his [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[Bill Alfonso]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] on him and join Sabu and his partner [[Rob Van Dam]].<ref name=\"slambio\"/> In response, Taz began teaming with [[Chris Candido]] to face Sabu and Van Dam.\n\nTwo months later at [[Wrestlepalooza (1997)|Wrestlepalooza]], Taz lost to Sabu in the rematch, marking his first loss since 1995. However, later in the night, he won the World Television Championship from [[Shane Douglas]] to begin his second reign.<ref name=\"WT-ECWTV\"/> He defended the title against all comers, including Douglas, [[Lance Storm]], [[John Kronus]], [[Al Snow]], [[Jerry Lynn]] and [[Chris Candido]]. Throughout late 1997, Taz began feuding with The Triple Threat in addition to Sabu and Van Dam, where he sometimes teamed up with [[Tommy Dreamer]] during the feud. At [[November to Remember (1997)|November to Remember]], he issued a challenge to World Heavyweight Champion Bam Bam Bigelow. The two would eventually meet, after Bigelow turned on Taz in a match against Shane Douglas and Chris Candido. Taz would ultimately lose the title to [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] at [[Living Dangerously (1998)|Living Dangerously]] on March 1, 1998.\n\nAfter losing the World Television Championship, Taz was elevated into the World Heavyweight Championship picture. In May 1998, with Shane Douglas injured and unable to wrestle, Taz was given an old World Television Championship belt painted orange\u2014his trademark color\u2014and began [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|cutting promos]], declaring himself the [[ECW FTW Heavyweight Championship|FTW Heavyweight Champion]] at [[It Ain't Seinfeld]]. Though the championship was unsanctioned [[Kayfabe|in storyline]], it was defended at ECW shows until Douglas was healthy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1998c.html#080298|title=Heat Wave 1998 results|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Just before winning the World Heavyweight Championship, Taz \"gave\" the FTW Heavyweight Title to long-time foe Sabu in a match where he physically pulled Sabu on top of him to allow him to get the pin.<ref name=\"SolieFTW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/ftwecw.html|title=Fuck The World title history|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Solie's Title Histories}}</ref>\n\n==== World Heavyweight Champion and departure (1999) ====\nTaz finally defeated Shane Douglas for the World Heavyweight Championship at [[Guilty as Charged (1999)|Guilty as Charged]], thus ending Douglas' year-long reign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1999a.html#011099|title=Guilty as Charged 1999 results|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Taz was supposed to defend the title against [[Chris Candido]] in his first televised title defense at [[House Party (1999)|House Party]] but Douglas attacked Candido before the match and took his place, whom Taz defeated to retain the title in his first successful title defense. He would then begin a feud with Sabu over Taz's World Heavyweight Championship and Sabu's FTW Heavyweight Championship. The rivalry culminated in a title unification match at the [[Living Dangerously (1999)|Living Dangerously]] pay-per-view, where Taz defeated Sabu to unify the FTW Heavyweight Championship into the World Heavyweight Championship. He would begin his next rivalry with Chris Candido, whom he defeated to retain the title at [[CyberSlam (1999)|CyberSlam]]. The two were scheduled to a rematch at [[Hardcore Heaven (1999)|Hardcore Heaven]], which Taz quickly won. However, he was attacked by [[Dudley Boyz]] after the match, leading to a title defense against [[Bubba Ray Dudley|Buh Buh Ray Dudley]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|falls count anywhere match]] in the main event later that night, which Taz won to retain the title. Taz then successfully defended the title against Candido on the June 4 episode of ''Hardcore TV'' to end the rivalry.\n\nTaz made his next successful title defense against [[Spike Dudley]] in a Falls Count Anywhere match on the June 25 episode of ''Hardcore TV''. He would begin feuding with the members of [[Steve Corino]]'s [[The Network (professional wrestling)|new rising stable]], primarily [[Yoshihiro Tajiri]]. Taz successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Tajiri at [[Hostile City Showdown (1999)|Hostile City Showdown]], the [[Heat Wave (1999)|Heat Wave]] pay-per-view and the September 3 episode of ''[[ECW on TNN]]''. During that time, Taz signed with the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]], losing the title as the first man eliminated in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|three-way dance]] at [[Anarchy Rulz (1999)|Anarchy Rulz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1999c.html#091999|title=Anarchy Rulz 1999 results|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher= Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> This ended his eight-month reign at 252 days. As he walked out of the ring, a large portion of the ECW locker room joined him on the entrance ramp to give him an emotional sendoff. After being off of ECW television for most of the fall, he wrestled one final match as an ECW performer at [[November to Remember (1999)|November to Remember]], losing to [[Rob Van Dam]] via [[Pin (wrestling)|pinfall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1999d.html#110799|title=November to Remember 1999 results|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Taz's final televised match in ECW aired on the November 13 episode of ''Hardcore TV'', in which he received a rematch against Mike Awesome for the World Heavyweight Championship, which he lost.

The game is a spiritual and technological successor to Technos' earlier beat 'em up, ''Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun'' (released outside of Japan by Taito as ''[[Renegade (video game)|Renegade]]''), but introduced several additions such as two-player [[cooperative gameplay]] and the ability to arm oneself with an enemy's weapon after disarming them. ''Double Dragon'' is considered to be one of the first successful examples of the genre, resulting in the creation of two arcade sequels and several spinoffs, as well as inspiring other companies in creating their own beat 'em ups.\n\nOriginally an [[arcade game]], home versions were released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], [[Master System]], [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 7800]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Game Boy]], [[Sega Mega Drive|Genesis/Mega Drive]] and [[Atari Lynx]], among other platforms during the series's height of popularity. A [[video game remake|remake]] titled ''[[Double Dragon Advance]]'' was released for the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2003.\n\n==Arcade version==\n[[File:DDArcade.png|thumb|left|Billy and Jimmy face off against Jick, the boss at the end of the first stage (arcade version)]]\n\nThe player takes control of martial artist Billy Lee, or his twin brother Jimmy (also known as Hammer and Spike in the supplementary materials for the American arcade release), as they fight their way into the turf of the Black Warriors gang in order to rescue Billy's love interest, Marian. The player character has a repertoire of martial arts techniques which they can perform by using the joystick and three action buttons (kick, jump, and punch) individually or in combination. Techniques range from basic punches and kicks to more elaborate attacks such as throws and elbow strikes. When playing with another player, one can grab an opponent from behind, allowing the other to attack unimpeded. Caution should be taken, though, as some enemies are able to do the same thing to the players. The player begins the game with a certain number of extra lives and a life gauge which depletes as the player takes hits, and must complete each stage within a time limit. One life is lost if either the life gauge or timer reaches zero, or if the player character falls off the bottom of the screen or into a hole, river, or bed of spikes.\n\nCertain enemies carry melee weapons, which can be knocked out of their hands and picked up to use against them. Available weapons include baseball bats, whips, throwing knives, and dynamite; in addition, rocks, oil drums, and boxes can be found in certain places.\n\nThe players encounter seven different types of enemies during the game; with the exception of Linda and Willy, all have two different skin colors.\n\n* '''Williams:''' A low-ranking member of the gang, who can use bats, knives, and dynamite.\n* '''Rowper:''' Another low-ranking member, who can use the same weapons as Williams and also throws rocks, oil drums, and boxes.\n* '''Linda:''' The only female member, and the only one who will pick up or carry a whip; she uses no other weapon.\n* '''Abobo:''' A tall, bald, shirtless gang member who can throw heavy items.\n* '''Jick:'''<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://twitter.com/chou_nosuke/status/712640167777931264|magazine=Famicom Ts\u016bshin|title=\u30d3\u30c7\u30f2\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u901a\u4fe123|trans-title=Video Arcade Journal 23|date=May 29, 1987|author=Tajiri Satoshi|authorlink=Satoshi Tajiri|pages=88\u201390}}</ref> The boss of the first stage, identical in appearance to Abobo except for the addition of a beard, sunglasses, and a Mohawk hairstyle.\n* '''Jeff:''' The boss of the second stage, who is a head swap of the Lee brothers.\n* '''Willy:''' The leader of the gang, and the final boss. He carries a machine gun whose bullets can instantly kill Billy and Jimmy, and he never drops it when knocked down.\n\nThe game is divided into four different stages or \"missions,\" which consist of a city slum, a factory, a forest, and the gang's hideout. The game normally ends if a single player defeats the final boss alone. However, if two players manage to complete the game together, they are then forced to fight each other in order to determine who will win Marian's affections. Both life gauges are refilled, any extra lives are taken away, and the timer is reset for this fight.\n\nThe original arcade version displayed 384 colors on the screen, out of a 4096 ([[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#12-bit RGB|12-bit]]) [[List of color palettes|color palette]]. The hardware used several [[8-bit]] [[microprocessor]]s running in parallel; [[16-bit]] processors were expensive at the time the game was first released. Along with the multiple [[Hitachi 6309|Hitachi HD6309]] based processors, multiple processors were dedicated to sound, such as the [[Yamaha YM2151]] [[frequency modulation synthesis|FM synthesis]] [[sound chip]].\n\n==Home versions==\n===Famicom/NES===\n[[File:Double Dragon NES Screenshot.png|thumb|The first fight scene in the NES version of the game]]\n\n''Double Dragon'' was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] by Techn\u014ds Japan in 1988. The game was published for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in North America by [[Tradewest]], who was given the license to produce other home versions of the game as well, and by [[Nintendo]] in Europe. The NES version of ''Double Dragon'' was released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service on April 25, 2008, in Europe and on April 28, 2008, in North America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/NES/Double-Dragon-838908.html|title=Double Dragon|website=Nintendo of Europe GmbH|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/|title=Nintendo - Official Site - Video Game Consoles, Games|website=www.nintendo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> It was also released in North America on December 12, 2013, for the Nintendo 3DS and the Wii U although in Europe, the former was released on December 5, 2013, while the latter was released on March 13, 2014.<ref>{{cite news|title=Double Dragon Now Available on Wii Shop Channel!|url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/L9y02rqdU9RwqNZ2FeZ2xsmO53OpLc4B|publisher=Nintendo of America|date=2008-04-28|accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref><ref>https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/double-dragon-nes-3ds</ref><ref>https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/3P5rmneYKSyMkMz4xp_oo9NIatLqth-p</ref>\n\nThe most notable difference the NES version has from the arcade game is the omission of the arcade's two players cooperative game mode in favor of alternating play. The plot was altered as a result of this change - instead of having both Lee brothers as protagonists, the NES version has players controlling Billy Lee as the lone protagonist, with Jimmy Lee serving as the antagonist and true leader of the Black Warriors.\n\nDue to technical limitations of the NES that were not worked around, the game can only generate two enemies on-screen to confront the player and both enemies are the same character. Additionally, all weapons on the screen (including any carried by the player) disappear once a group of enemies has been defeated. A level-up system was also implemented. The player begins the game with only the basic punches and kicks available to their character, gaining the most powerful ones after acquiring the experience points needed to use them. The player has a total of seven skill levels that they can achieve throughout the game.\n\nThe level designs are very different, with some stages featuring new areas (notably the cavern section in Mission 3) that feature greater emphasis on jumping over platforms or evading traps. Most of the enemies from the arcade version also appear, with the exception of Jick and Jeff. A new enemy character, a Chinese martial arts master named Chin Taimei (shortened to Chintai in the localized version) serves as the boss of the second stage and appears as a recurring minor enemy for the rest of the game.\n\n====Mode B====\nThe NES version features a bonus game mode (dubbed \"Mode B\") where the player can choose between Billy or one of five enemy characters (Will, Rowper, Linda, Chin, and Abobo) from the main game and compete against a [[palette swap|double]] of their character controlled by the computer or a second player in a one-on-one match. Matches against the computer are handicapped in favor of the computer-controlled character, while certain characters will get a chance to wield a weapon in the 2-Players matches. The mode features larger sprites different from the main game itself.\n\n''Double Dragon'' was only the second game that Techn\u014ds developed for the NES, and the two-player mode was reputedly omitted because of the programmers' inexperience with the hardware. This also accounts for the game's large number of bugs and glitches. Also, the \"Mode B\" was said to be a prototype originally planned for the main game.\n\n===Master System===\nShortly after the release of the NES version, [[Sega]] acquired the rights to develop its own port of the game for the Sega Mark III and [[Sega Master System|Master System]] with the Master System version being developed by [[Arc System Works]] (who would eventually gain the rights for the franchise as part of their Intellectual Property portfolio). The game supports the optional FM Sound Unit sold separately for the Mark III and which is already integrated into the Japanese Master System models.\n\nThis version featured brighter colors and displaying up to three different enemies on-screen, although weapons are limited to only one per screen. The game retains the two-player co-op mode (including the final face off between both players) and has level designs that were closer to the arcade game (aside from missing ladders in some areas). This version retains the Mission 2 end-boss, a head swap of the Lee brothers (who is given the name Jeff in this version). However, the mohawk version of Abobo is missing in this version as well, being replaced by black and green [[palette swap]]s of the bald Abobo as stage bosses.\n\nThe Master System version allows for unlimited continues until the final stage. However, if a player performs a number of 10 backward jump kicks at the start of the final stage, they retain their unlimited continues.\n\n===Game Boy===\nIn [[1990 in video gaming|1990]], Techn\u014ds Japan produced a [[Game Boy]] version of ''Double Dragon'', which was also released in North America and Europe by Tradewest. This version features gameplay similar to the NES version, but with completely different level designs and all of the main character's moves available from the start. The enemies are the same as the NES version, but some of the characters such as Abobo and Chin were given new techniques. The main game mode is still single player, although the game ends after the fight with Willy, with Jimmy not appearing in the main game. A two-player Versus Mode is also included like in the NES version, but the only characters available to play as are the Lee brothers. This version has also been re-released on the [[Virtual Console]] for the Nintendo 3DS in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/double-dragon-gb-3ds/|title=Double Dragon for Nintendo 3DS - Nintendo Game Details|website=www.nintendo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\n===Home computers===\nVersions of ''Double Dragon'' have been produced for various other platforms as well. In [[1988 in video gaming|1988]], [[Activision]] released versions of ''Double Dragon'' for the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Atari 7800]]. In addition, home computer versions of the game were released for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[PC compatible]]s. Most were developed by UK-based Binary Designs aside from the PC port, which was developed by Arcadia Software.\n\nTwo different Amstrad CPC versions were produced: one was released for the CPC6128 (128&nbsp;kB RAM) based on the Amiga version, while the other was released for the CPC464 (tape and 64&nbsp;kB RAM) and was ported from the Sinclair version. In [[1991 in video gaming|1991]], a second Commodore 64 version was released by Ocean Software unrelated to the earlier Binary Designs port. It came on a special 32k bank-switched cartridge and did not support two-player mode.\n\nThe original Binary Designs port of ''Double Dragon'' for the Commodore 64 was heavily criticized for its poor quality and is often considered one of the worst commercially released C64 games and one of the worst arcade conversions of all time. The game was reportedly done by extremely inexperienced programmers on a very tight deadline<ref>https://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=https%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/details.php%3FID%3D752</ref> and lacked almost all of the gameplay elements of the arcade game. Only two weapons (the whip and baseball bat) are available and backgrounds are static; the player cannot climb or jump on or interact with them, and the battle with the final boss at the end is absent. The game also featured a visible gap between the characters' upper and lower bodies due to a poorly coded sprite multiplexer routine; the instruction manual included an apology message from the programming team for this visual artifact.\n\n===Other platforms===\nIn [[1992 in video gaming|1992]], [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] released a [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] port of the game in North America and Europe under the Ballistic Software label. This version was released as an unlicensed third-party cartridge. Although the Mega Drive/Genesis has a smaller color palette than the arcade original, due to the more powerful 16-bit hardware it actually fixes all of the slow down problems from the original arcade game. However, it had a number of deficiencies (especially in sound quality) because Ballistic Software were forced to use a small 512k (4 Meg) cartridge ROM for cost reasons. This version came closest to the arcade game at the time.\n\nAn [[Atari Lynx]] version was released in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]], developed by Knight Technologies and published by [[Telegames]].\n\nIn [[2003 in video gaming|2003]], a remake of the original arcade game titled ''[[Double Dragon Advance]]'' was released for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. This version features four additional stages interspersed between the four original stages, as a new set of moves and enemy characters, some of which are lifted or inspired by other games in the series. It was published by [[Atlus]] under license from Million Corporation, the company which held the IP to the series at the time. In [[2006 in video gaming|2006]], a [[Mobile gaming|mobile phone game]] based on ''Double Dragon Advance'' was released titled ''Double Dragon EX''. It was developed by [[South Korea|Korean]]-based [[Eolith (company)|Eolith]].\n\nAn [[Xbox Live Arcade]] version of ''Double Dragon'' was released on May 9, for the [[Xbox 360]] in [[2007 in video gaming|2007]]. This version features an emulation of the original arcade game, as well as an optional game mode featuring redrawn high definition graphics and a remixed soundtrack. It also features support for online multiplayer. It was delisted on July 1, 2009, due to the closure of its publisher, [[Empire Interactive]].\n\n[[2011 in video gaming|2011]] saw the release of a new version of ''Double Dragon'' for [[iOS]] and [[Android (OS)|Android]] devices. It was again developed by Brizo Interactive under license from Million, in collaboration with [[Aksys Games]], and published by Bow Mobile Corp. It employs brand new artwork and sprites, Bluetooth multiplayer connectivity, online score ranking, and a host of other new and unique features, new to the franchise.\n\nThe arcade version of ''Double Dragon'' was re-released in [[2013 in video gaming|2013]] alongside its two sequels in a compilation titled ''Double Dragon Trilogy'' produced by [[DotEmu]], which was released on [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[Steam (software)|Steam]] platforms.\n\n==Reception==\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"float:right; font-size:80%; text-align:center; margin:1em; margin-top:0; padding:0; background:none;\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n! colspan=12 style=\"font-size: 120%\" | Reception\n|-\n! colspan=12 | [[Video game journalism|Reviews]]\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Publication\n! colspan=11 | Score\n|-\n!

In the August 1987 issue of ''[[Commodore User]]'', Ferdy Hamilton gave it ratings of 9 for graphics, 7 for sound, 9 for toughness, 10 for endurance, and 9 for value, with an overall score of 9 out of 10. He noted the game's popularity, stating that it took him \"about half an hour to get near it in my local [[Amusement arcade|arcade]]\" and \"a brief glance around [[West End of London|West End]] arcades confirmed\" that \"''Double Dragon'' is set to be a massive [[Arcade game|coin-op]] hit.\" He stated that it \"isn't an easy game to play initially\" and requires \"both brain and brawn,\" described the graphics as \"superb, the handling likewise,\" and stated \"the variety of actions, locations and enemies make this a true state of the art Beat 'Em Up, centuries beyond those old Kung Fu games which still litter the arcades.\" He concluded it to be \"a strong contender for hottest beat 'em up yet.\"<ref name=\"CU_ARC\"/> In the July 1987 issue of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', Clare Edgeley described the \"Sordid street fights\" as \"great fun when you've got the guts\" and \"if you manage to get hang of the controls.\" She concluded that \"all the ingredients are there for a really addictive, martial arts style kick 'em to bits.\"<ref name=\"CVG_ARC\">[https://archive.org/stream/cvg-magazine-069/CVG_069_Jul_1987#page/n87/mode/2up Double Dragon], ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', issue 69, July 1987, p. 87</ref> In the October 1987 issue of ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'', the reviewer Tony described it as \"the best game of its kind around\" and \"thoroughly addictive,\" concluding that it is \"depraved, sick, bloodthirsty, violent &ndash; and I love it!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/75/106/double_dragon_review.html |title=Double Dragon arcade game review |publisher=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-05}}</ref> In the November 1987 issue of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'', reviewer Peter Shaw stated that if \"you liked Taito's ''[[Renegade (video game)|Renegade]]'', you'll jest lurve ''Double Dragon'',\" describing it as \"a streetfighting beat 'em up, but much nastier,\" with [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] \"much bigger than the ones in ''Renegade'', which adds to the realism,\" and \"gruesome sound effects,\" concluding that it is \"Great stuff, and really good value, even for 30[[Penny (British decimal coin)|p]] a throw.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/52/106/double_dragon_review.html |title=Double Dragon arcade game review |publisher=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-05}}</ref>\n\n[[Toys \"R\" Us]] reported that the NES version of ''Double Dragon'' sold out in its first two weeks on sale in the US.<ref name = \"CGW\">{{Cite news | date = Oct 1988 | last = Worley | first = Joyce | periodical = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Video Gaming World's Newswire| page = 48}}</ref> In the UK, [[Mastertronic]]'s home [[PC game|computer game]] ports sold 289,510 units.<ref name=\"RetroGamer\"/>\n\nThe critical reception of the home versions varied depending on the quality of the [[Porting|conversions]].

In turn, the animated series and movie inspired their respective video game spinoffs as well, both which were fighting games. The cartoon inspired the Tradewest-developed ''[[Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls]]'', released in [[1994 in video gaming|1994]] for the SNES and Genesis (also ported to the [[Atari Jaguar]]); while characters and plot elements from the movie were adapted into the [[1995 in video gaming|1995]] Techn\u014ds-developed the [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo-Geo]] version of ''[[Double Dragon (Neo-Geo)|Double Dragon]]''.\n\n''Double Dragon'' is one of the video games featured in the manga titled ''Rock'n Game Boy'', by Shigeto Ikehara and Published by Comic BomBom October 1989 to December 1991.\n\nNot specific to any format/system, the original game was used as a clue in the 2015 episode of ''Jeopardy!'' in the category The Marian Kind in the first round on February 17.\n\n===Spin-offs===\nThe boss Abobo is the star of the indie retro game ''[[Abobo's Big Adventure]]''.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nA [[soundtrack]] titled {{nihongo|'''''Original Sound of Double Dragon'''''|\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30fb\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30c0\u30d6\u30eb\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3|Orijinaru Saundo obu Daburu Doragon}} was released in Japan by Apollon and composed by Kazunaka Yamane, on February 21, 1988.

The game is a spiritual and technological successor to Technos' earlier beat 'em up, ''Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun'' (released outside of Japan by Taito as ''[[Renegade (video game)|Renegade]]''), but introduced several additions such as two-player [[cooperative gameplay]] and the ability to arm oneself with an enemy's weapon after disarming them. ''Double Dragon'' is considered to be one of the first successful examples of the genre, resulting in the creation of two arcade sequels and several spinoffs, as well as inspiring other companies in creating their own beat 'em ups.\n\nOriginally an [[arcade game]], home versions were released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], [[Master System]], [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 7800]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Game Boy]], [[Sega Mega Drive|Genesis/Mega Drive]] and [[Atari Lynx]], among other platforms during the series's height of popularity. A [[video game remake|remake]] titled ''[[Double Dragon Advance]]'' was released for the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2003.\n\n==Arcade version==\n[[File:DDArcade.png|thumb|left|Billy and Jimmy face off against Jick, the boss at the end of the first stage (arcade version)]]\n\nThe player takes control of martial artist Billy Lee, or his twin brother Jimmy (also known as Hammer and Spike in the supplementary materials for the American arcade release), as they fight their way into the turf of the Black Warriors gang in order to rescue Billy's love interest, Marian. The player character has a repertoire of martial arts techniques which they can perform by using the joystick and three action buttons (kick, jump, and punch) individually or in combination. Techniques range from basic punches and kicks to more elaborate attacks such as throws and elbow strikes. When playing with another player, one can grab an opponent from behind, allowing the other to attack unimpeded. Caution should be taken, though, as some enemies are able to do the same thing to the players. The player begins the game with a certain number of extra lives and a life gauge which depletes as the player takes hits, and must complete each stage within a time limit. One life is lost if either the life gauge or timer reaches zero, or if the player character falls off the bottom of the screen or into a hole, river, or bed of spikes.\n\nCertain enemies carry melee weapons, which can be knocked out of their hands and picked up to use against them. Available weapons include baseball bats, whips, throwing knives, and dynamite; in addition, rocks, oil drums, and boxes can be found in certain places.\n\nThe players encounter seven different types of enemies during the game; with the exception of Linda and Willy, all have two different skin colors.\n\n* '''Williams:''' A low-ranking member of the gang, who can use bats, knives, and dynamite.\n* '''Rowper:''' Another low-ranking member, who can use the same weapons as Williams and also throws rocks, oil drums, and boxes.\n* '''Linda:''' The only female member, and the only one who will pick up or carry a whip; she uses no other weapon.\n* '''Abobo:''' A tall, bald, shirtless gang member who can throw heavy items.\n* '''Jick:'''<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://twitter.com/chou_nosuke/status/712640167777931264|magazine=Famicom Ts\u016bshin|title=\u30d3\u30c7\u30f2\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u901a\u4fe123|trans-title=Video Arcade Journal 23|date=May 29, 1987|author=Tajiri Satoshi|authorlink=Satoshi Tajiri|pages=88\u201390}}</ref> The boss of the first stage, identical in appearance to Abobo except for the addition of a beard, sunglasses, and a Mohawk hairstyle.\n* '''Jeff:''' The boss of the second stage, who is a head swap of the Lee brothers.\n* '''Willy:''' The leader of the gang, and the final boss. He carries a machine gun whose bullets can instantly kill Billy and Jimmy, and he never drops it when knocked down.\n\nThe game is divided into four different stages or \"missions,\" which consist of a city slum, a factory, a forest, and the gang's hideout. The game normally ends if a single player defeats the final boss alone. However, if two players manage to complete the game together, they are then forced to fight each other in order to determine who will win Marian's affections. Both life gauges are refilled, any extra lives are taken away, and the timer is reset for this fight.\n\nThe original arcade version displayed 384 colors on the screen, out of a 4096 ([[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#12-bit RGB|12-bit]]) [[List of color palettes|color palette]]. The hardware used several [[8-bit]] [[microprocessor]]s running in parallel; [[16-bit]] processors were expensive at the time the game was first released. Along with the multiple [[Hitachi 6309|Hitachi HD6309]] based processors, multiple processors were dedicated to sound, such as the [[Yamaha YM2151]] [[frequency modulation synthesis|FM synthesis]] [[sound chip]].\n\n==Home versions==\n===Famicom/NES===\n[[File:Double Dragon NES Screenshot.png|thumb|The first fight scene in the NES version of the game]]\n\n''Double Dragon'' was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] by Techn\u014ds Japan in 1988. The game was published for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in North America by [[Tradewest]], who was given the license to produce other home versions of the game as well, and by [[Nintendo]] in Europe. The NES version of ''Double Dragon'' was released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service on April 25, 2008, in Europe and on April 28, 2008, in North America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/NES/Double-Dragon-838908.html|title=Double Dragon|website=Nintendo of Europe GmbH|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/|title=Nintendo - Official Site - Video Game Consoles, Games|website=www.nintendo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> It was also released in North America on December 12, 2013, for the Nintendo 3DS and the Wii U although in Europe, the former was released on December 5, 2013, while the latter was released on March 13, 2014.<ref>{{cite news|title=Double Dragon Now Available on Wii Shop Channel!|url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/L9y02rqdU9RwqNZ2FeZ2xsmO53OpLc4B|publisher=Nintendo of America|date=2008-04-28|accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref><ref>https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/double-dragon-nes-3ds</ref><ref>https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/3P5rmneYKSyMkMz4xp_oo9NIatLqth-p</ref>\n\nThe most notable difference the NES version has from the arcade game is the omission of the arcade's two players cooperative game mode in favor of alternating play. The plot was altered as a result of this change - instead of having both Lee brothers as protagonists, the NES version has players controlling Billy Lee as the lone protagonist, with Jimmy Lee serving as the antagonist and true leader of the Black Warriors.\n\nDue to technical limitations of the NES that were not worked around, the game can only generate two enemies on-screen to confront the player and both enemies are the same character. Additionally, all weapons on the screen (including any carried by the player) disappear once a group of enemies has been defeated. A level-up system was also implemented. The player begins the game with only the basic punches and kicks available to their character, gaining the most powerful ones after acquiring the experience points needed to use them. The player has a total of seven skill levels that they can achieve throughout the game.\n\nThe level designs are very different, with some stages featuring new areas (notably the cavern section in Mission 3) that feature greater emphasis on jumping over platforms or evading traps. Most of the enemies from the arcade version also appear, with the exception of Jick and Jeff. A new enemy character, a Chinese martial arts master named Chin Taimei (shortened to Chintai in the localized version) serves as the boss of the second stage and appears as a recurring minor enemy for the rest of the game.\n\n====Mode B====\nThe NES version features a bonus game mode (dubbed \"Mode B\") where the player can choose between Billy or one of five enemy characters (Will, Rowper, Linda, Chin, and Abobo) from the main game and compete against a [[palette swap|double]] of their character controlled by the computer or a second player in a one-on-one match. Matches against the computer are handicapped in favor of the computer-controlled character, while certain characters will get a chance to wield a weapon in the 2-Players matches. The mode features larger sprites different from the main game itself.\n\n''Double Dragon'' was only the second game that Techn\u014ds developed for the NES, and the two-player mode was reputedly omitted because of the programmers' inexperience with the hardware. This also accounts for the game's large number of bugs and glitches. Also, the \"Mode B\" was said to be a prototype originally planned for the main game.\n\n===Master System===\nShortly after the release of the NES version, [[Sega]] acquired the rights to develop its own port of the game for the Sega Mark III and [[Sega Master System|Master System]] with the Master System version being developed by [[Arc System Works]] (who would eventually gain the rights for the franchise as part of their Intellectual Property portfolio). The game supports the optional FM Sound Unit sold separately for the Mark III and which is already integrated into the Japanese Master System models.\n\nThis version featured brighter colors and displaying up to three different enemies on-screen, although weapons are limited to only one per screen. The game retains the two-player co-op mode (including the final face off between both players) and has level designs that were closer to the arcade game (aside from missing ladders in some areas). This version retains the Mission 2 end-boss, a head swap of the Lee brothers (who is given the name Jeff in this version). However, the mohawk version of Abobo is missing in this version as well, being replaced by black and green [[palette swap]]s of the bald Abobo as stage bosses.\n\nThe Master System version allows for unlimited continues until the final stage. However, if a player performs a number of 10 backward jump kicks at the start of the final stage, they retain their unlimited continues.\n\n===Game Boy===\nIn [[1990 in video gaming|1990]], Techn\u014ds Japan produced a [[Game Boy]] version of ''Double Dragon'', which was also released in North America and Europe by Tradewest. This version features gameplay similar to the NES version, but with completely different level designs and all of the main character's moves available from the start. The enemies are the same as the NES version, but some of the characters such as Abobo and Chin were given new techniques. The main game mode is still single player, although the game ends after the fight with Willy, with Jimmy not appearing in the main game. A two-player Versus Mode is also included like in the NES version, but the only characters available to play as are the Lee brothers. This version has also been re-released on the [[Virtual Console]] for the Nintendo 3DS in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/double-dragon-gb-3ds/|title=Double Dragon for Nintendo 3DS - Nintendo Game Details|website=www.nintendo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\n===Home computers===\nVersions of ''Double Dragon'' have been produced for various other platforms as well. In [[1988 in video gaming|1988]], [[Activision]] released versions of ''Double Dragon'' for the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Atari 7800]]. In addition, home computer versions of the game were released for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[PC compatible]]s. Most were developed by UK-based Binary Designs aside from the PC port, which was developed by Arcadia Software.\n\nTwo different Amstrad CPC versions were produced: one was released for the CPC6128 (128&nbsp;kB RAM) based on the Amiga version, while the other was released for the CPC464 (tape and 64&nbsp;kB RAM) and was ported from the Sinclair version. In [[1991 in video gaming|1991]], a second Commodore 64 version was released by Ocean Software unrelated to the earlier Binary Designs port. It came on a special 32k bank-switched cartridge and did not support two-player mode.\n\nThe original Binary Designs port of ''Double Dragon'' for the Commodore 64 was heavily criticized for its poor quality and is often considered one of the worst commercially-released C64 games and one of the worst arcade conversions of all time. The game was reportedly done by extremely inexperienced programmers on a very tight deadline<ref>https://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=https%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/details.php%3FID%3D752</ref> and lacked almost all of the gameplay elements of the arcade game. Only two weapons (the whip and baseball bat) are available and backgrounds are static; the player cannot climb or jump on or interact with them, and the battle with the final boss at the end is absent. The game also featured a visible gap between the characters' upper and lower bodies due to a poorly coded sprite multiplexer routine; the instruction manual included an apology message from the programming team for this visual artifact.\n\n===Other platforms===\nIn [[1992 in video gaming|1992]], [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] released a [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] port of the game in North America and Europe under the Ballistic Software label. This version was released as an unlicensed third-party cartridge. Although the Mega Drive/Genesis has a smaller color palette than the arcade original, due to the more powerful 16-bit hardware it actually fixes all of the slow down problems from the original arcade game. However, it had a number of deficiencies (especially in sound quality) because Ballistic Software were forced to use a small 512k (4 Meg) cartridge ROM for cost reasons. This version came closest to the arcade game at the time.\n\nAn [[Atari Lynx]] version was released in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]], developed by Knight Technologies and published by [[Telegames]].\n\nIn [[2003 in video gaming|2003]], a remake of the original arcade game titled ''[[Double Dragon Advance]]'' was released for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. This version features four additional stages interspersed between the four original stages, as a new set of moves and enemy characters, some of which are lifted or inspired by other games in the series. It was published by [[Atlus]] under license from Million Corporation, the company which held the IP to the series at the time. In [[2006 in video gaming|2006]], a [[Mobile gaming|mobile phone game]] based on ''Double Dragon Advance'' was released titled ''Double Dragon EX''. It was developed by [[South Korea|Korean]]-based [[Eolith (company)|Eolith]].\n\nAn [[Xbox Live Arcade]] version of ''Double Dragon'' was released on May 9, for the [[Xbox 360]] in [[2007 in video gaming|2007]]. This version features an emulation of the original arcade game, as well as an optional game mode featuring redrawn high definition graphics and a remixed soundtrack. It also features support for online multiplayer. It was delisted on July 1, 2009, due to the closure of its publisher, [[Empire Interactive]].\n\n[[2011 in video gaming|2011]] saw the release of a new version of ''Double Dragon'' for [[iOS]] and [[Android (OS)|Android]] devices. It was again developed by Brizo Interactive under license from Million, in collaboration with [[Aksys Games]], and published by Bow Mobile Corp. It employs brand new artwork and sprites, Bluetooth multiplayer connectivity, online score ranking, and a host of other new and unique features, new to the franchise.\n\nThe arcade version of ''Double Dragon'' was re-released in [[2013 in video gaming|2013]] alongside its two sequels in a compilation titled ''Double Dragon Trilogy'' produced by [[DotEmu]], which was released on [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[Steam (software)|Steam]] platforms.\n\n==Reception==\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"float:right; font-size:80%; text-align:center; margin:1em; margin-top:0; padding:0; background:none;\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n! colspan=12 style=\"font-size: 120%\" | Reception\n|-\n! colspan=12 | [[Video game journalism|Reviews]]\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Publication\n! colspan=11 | Score\n|-\n!

These problems include: \n*Wide variation in lengths of texts used \n*Class imbalance in data \n\n\n== Author Profiling and the Internet ==\n\nThe rise of the internet in the 20th to 21st century catalysed an increase in author profiling research on data from the web including content mined from social media platforms, emails, and also blogs. Content from web media have been analysed in author profiling to identify age-groups, gender, geographic origins, nationality and also psychometric traits of web users. The information obtained have been used to serve various applications such as marketing and forensics.\n\nSome sources of data for author profiling on the internet include:\n\n*Social Media platforms\n**Facebook\n**Weibo\n**Chat logs\n**Blogs\n*Emails\n\n\n=== Social Media ===\n\nThe increased integration of [[Social media]] in people\u2019s daily lives in the 20th and 21st centuries have made them a rich source of textual data for author profiling. This is mainly because users frequently upload and share content for various purposes including self-expression, socializing, and personal businesses. The [[Social bot]] is also a frequent feature of social media platforms, especially Twitter, generating content that may be analysed for author profiling <ref name=\" Rangel\">Rangel, F., & Russo, P. (2019).Overview of the 7th Author Profiling Task at PAN 2019: Bots and Gender Profiling in Twitter. CLEF. Retrieved from http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2380/paper_263.pdf</ref>. While different platforms contain similar data they may also contain different features depending on the format and structure of the particular platform.\n\n\n[[Social media]] platforms have a rich source of data that can be used for author profiling. Despite this there are still limitations in using social media as data sources for author profiling, because data obtained may not always be reliable or accurate. Users sometimes provide false information about themselves or withhold information <ref name=\"Rosso\">Rosso, P., Rangel, F., Far\u00edas, I. H., Cagnina, L., Zaghouani, W., & Charfi, A. (2018).

Retrieved from http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.remotexs.ntu.edu.sg/doi/pdf/10.1111/lnc3.12275\n</ref>. As a result, the training of algorithms for author profiling may be impeded by data that is less accurate. Another limitation is the irregularity of text in [[social media]]. Features of irregularity include deviation from normal linguistic standards such as spelling errors, unstandardised transliteration as with the substitution of letters with numbers, shorthands, user-created abbreviations for phrases and et cetera, which may pose a challenge to author profiling <ref name=\"G\u00f3mez-Adorno\">G\u00f3mez-Adorno, H., Markov, I., Sidorov, G., Posadas-Dur\u00e1n, J.-P., Sanchez-Perez, M.

Primary content of focus for author profiling on Weibo content include classical [[Chinese language|Chinese]] characters, [[hashtag]]s, [[emoticon]]s, kaomoji, homogenous [[punctuation]], [[Latin]] sequences (due to the multilingualism of text) and even poetic formats. Particularly popular [[Chinese language|Chinese]] expressions, parts-of-speech and word types are also tracked for author profiling <ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, W., Caines, A., Alikaniotis, D., & Buttery, P. (2015). Predicting author [[ageing|age]] from Weibo [[microblogging]] posts. Retrieved from https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L16-1478.pdf</ref>.\n\n\nAuthor profiling for Weibo content requires algorithms different from those utilised for other social media platforms, mainly due to the linguistic differences between [[Mandarin Chinese]] and Western languages. For example, Chinese emotions involve Chinese characters describing the gesture or facial expression in brackets, such as: e.g. [\u54c8\u54c8] \u2018laughter\u2019, [\u6cea] \u2018tears\u2019, [\u5077\u7b11] \u2018giggle\u2019, [\u7231\u4f60] \u2018love\u2019, [\u5fc3] \u2018heart\u2019 <ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, W., Caines, A., Alikaniotis, D., & Buttery, P. (2015). Predicting author [[ageing|age]] from Weibo [[microblogging]] posts. Retrieved from https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L16-1478.pdf</ref>. This differs from the use of punctuation symbols for emoticons in Western languages, or the common use of the Unicode emojis in other platforms such as facebook, instagram, etc. Further, while there are around 161 western emoticons, there are around 2900 emoticons regularly used in Mainland China for web content as in Weibo <ref name=\"Chen\">Chen, L., Qian, T., Wang, F., You, Z., Peng, Q., & Zhong, M.

In order to tackle these differences, author profiling algorithms have been trained on Chinese emoticons and linguistic features. For example, author profiling algorithms have been designed to detect Chinese stylistic expressions expressing formality and sentiment, in place of algorithms detecting English linguistic features such as capital letters <ref name=\"Chen\">Chen, L., Qian, T., Wang, F., You, Z., Peng, Q., & Zhong, M.

These problems include: \n*Wide variation in lengths of texts used \n*Class imbalance in data \n\n\n== Author Profiling and the Internet ==\n\nThe rise of the internet in the 20th to 21st century catalysed an increase in author profiling research on data from the web including content mined from social media platforms, emails, and also blogs. Content from web media have been analysed in author profiling to identify age-groups, gender, geographic origins, nationality and also psychometric traits of web users. The information obtained have been used to serve various applications such as marketing and forensics.\n\nSome sources of data for author profiling on the internet include:\n\n*Social Media platforms\n**Facebook\n**Weibo\n**Chat logs\n**Blogs\n*Emails\n\n\n=== Social Media ===\n\nThe increased integration of [[Social media]] in people\u2019s daily lives in the 20th and 21st centuries have made them a rich source of textual data for author profiling. This is mainly because users frequently upload and share content for various purposes including self-expression, socializing, and personal businesses. The [[Social bot]] is also a frequent feature of social media platforms, especially Twitter, generating content that may be analysed for author profiling <ref name=\" Rangel\">Rangel, F., & Russo, P. (2019).Overview of the 7th Author Profiling Task at PAN 2019: Bots and Gender Profiling in Twitter. CLEF. Retrieved from http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2380/paper_263.pdf</ref>. While different platforms contain similar data they may also contain different features depending on the format and structure of the particular platform.\n\n\n[[Social media]] platforms have a rich source of data that can be used for author profiling. Despite this there are still limitations in using social media as data sources for author profiling, because data obtained may not always be reliable or accurate. Users sometimes provide false information about themselves or withhold information <ref name=\"Rosso\">Rosso, P., Rangel, F., Far\u00edas, I. H., Cagnina, L., Zaghouani, W., & Charfi, A. (2018).

Retrieved from http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.remotexs.ntu.edu.sg/doi/pdf/10.1111/lnc3.12275\n</ref>. As a result, the training of algorithms for author profiling may be impeded by data that is less accurate. Another limitation is the irregularity of text in [[social media]]. Features of irregularity include deviation from normal linguistic standards such as spelling errors, unstandardised transliteration as with the substitution of letters with numbers, shorthands, user-created abbreviations for phrases and et cetera, which may pose a challenge to author profiling <ref name=\"G\u00f3mez-Adorno\">G\u00f3mez-Adorno, H., Markov, I., Sidorov, G., Posadas-Dur\u00e1n, J.-P., Sanchez-Perez, M.

Primary content of focus for author profiling on Weibo content include classical [[Chinese language|Chinese]] characters, [[hashtag]]s, [[emoticon]]s, kaomoji, homogenous [[punctuation]], [[Latin]] sequences (due to the multilingualism of text) and even poetic formats. Particularly popular [[Chinese language|Chinese]] expressions, parts-of-speech and word types are also tracked for author profiling <ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, W., Caines, A., Alikaniotis, D., & Buttery, P. (2015). Predicting author [[ageing|age]] from Weibo [[microblogging]] posts. Retrieved from https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L16-1478.pdf</ref>.\n\n\nAuthor profiling for Weibo content requires algorithms different from those utilised for other social media platforms, mainly due to the linguistic differences between [[Mandarin Chinese]] and Western languages. For example, Chinese emotions involve Chinese characters describing the gesture or facial expression in brackets, such as: e.g. [\u54c8\u54c8] \u2018laughter\u2019, [\u6cea] \u2018tears\u2019, [\u5077\u7b11] \u2018giggle\u2019, [\u7231\u4f60] \u2018love\u2019, [\u5fc3] \u2018heart\u2019 <ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, W., Caines, A., Alikaniotis, D., & Buttery, P. (2015). Predicting author [[ageing|age]] from Weibo [[microblogging]] posts. Retrieved from https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L16-1478.pdf</ref>. This differs from the use of punctuation symbols for emoticons in Western languages, or the common use of the Unicode emojis in other platforms such as facebook, instagram, etc. Further, while there are around 161 western emoticons, there are around 2900 emoticons regularly used in Mainland China for web content as in Weibo <ref name=\"Chen\">Chen, L., Qian, T., Wang, F., You, Z., Peng, Q., & Zhong, M.

In order to tackle these differences, author profiling algorithms have been trained on Chinese emoticons and linguistic features. For example, author profiling algorithms have been designed to detect Chinese stylistic expressions expressing formality and sentiment, in place of algorithms detecting English linguistic features such as capital letters <ref name=\"Chen\">Chen, L., Qian, T., Wang, F., You, Z., Peng, Q., & Zhong, M.

Retrieved from https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21042-1_7</ref>.\n\n\nThere is relatively less use of author profiling methods on Weibo content as compared to other more popular, globalised platforms. This may be due to the centralisation of Weibo in the Chinese population of [[Mainland China]], limiting its rates of usage to predominantly [[China National|China  Nationals]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}. Studies done for this platform have utilised [[Automated bot|bot]]s, [[machine learning]] [[algorithm]]s to identify authors\u2019 [[ageing|age]] and [[gender]]. Data is acquired from Weibo microblog posts of willing participants to be analysed, and used to train [[algorithm]]s that build concept-based profiles of users to a certain accuracy <ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, W., Caines, A., Alikaniotis, D., & Buttery, P.

When Spanish explorers and missionaries arrived in the late 18th century, the Ohlone inhabited the area along the coast from [[San Francisco Bay]] through [[Monterey Bay]] to the lower [[Salinas Valley]]. At that time they spoke a variety of related languages. The [[Ohlone languages]] make up a sub-family of the [[Utian languages|Utian language]] family.<ref>Callaghan 1997</ref> Older proposals place Utian within the [[Penutian language|Penutian]] language phylum, while newer proposals group it as [[Yok-Utian languages|Yok-Utian]].\n\nBritish ethnologist [[Robert Gordon Latham]] originally used the term \"Costanoan\" to refer to the linguistically similar but ethnically diverse Native American tribes in the San Francisco Bay Area.<ref>{{cite journal |title=On the Languages of Northern, Western and Central America |author=Latham, R.

They lived by hunting, fishing, and gathering, in the typical ethnographic California pattern. The members of these various bands interacted freely with one another.

The Spanish constructed [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] along the California coast with the objective of Christianizing the native people and culture. Between the years 1769 and 1834, the number of Indigenous Californians dropped from 300,000 to 250,000. After California entered into the Union in 1850, the state government perpetrated massacres against the Ohlone people.

The Muwekma Ohlone Tribe has members from around the San Francisco Bay Area, and is composed of descendants of the Ohlones/Costanoans from the San Jose, Santa Clara, and San Francisco missions. The Ohlone/Costanoan Esselen Nation, consisting of descendants of intermarried [[Rumsen tribe|Rumsen]] Costanoan and [[Esselen]] speakers of Mission San Carlos Borromeo, are centered at Monterey. The Amah-Mutsun Tribe are descendants of [[Mutsun tribe|Mutsun]] Costanoan speakers of Mission San Juan Bautista, inland from Monterey Bay. Most members of another group of Rumsien language, descendants from Mission San Carlos, the Costanoan Rumsien Carmel Tribe of Pomona/Chino, now live in southern California. These groups, and others with smaller memberships (see groups listed under the heading ''Present Day'' below) are separately petitioning the federal government for [[Federally recognized tribes|tribal recognition]].\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Choris Ohlone.jpg|thumb|Ohlone people painted by [[Louis Choris]]]]\n\n=== Pre-Contact Lifestyle ===\nThe Ohlone inhabited fixed village locations, moving temporarily to gather seasonal foodstuffs like [[acorn]]s and berries. The Ohlone people lived in Northern California from the northern tip of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] down to northern region of [[Big Sur]], and from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the [[Diablo Range]] in the east. Their vast region included the San Francisco Peninsula, [[Santa Clara Valley]], [[Santa Cruz Mountains]], [[Monterey Bay|Monterey Bay area]], as well as present-day [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]], [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]] and the [[Salinas Valley]]. Prior to Spanish contact, the Ohlone formed a complex association of approximately 50&nbsp;different \"nations or tribes\" with about 50 to 500 members each, with an average of 200. Over 50&nbsp;distinct Ohlone tribes and villages have been recorded. The Ohlone villages interacted through trade, intermarriage and ceremonial events, as well as some [[wiktionary:internecine|internecine]] conflict.

In hills where [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] trees were accessible, they built conical houses from redwood bark attached to a frame of wood. Residents of Monterey recall Redwood houses. One of the main village buildings, the [[sweat lodge]] was low into the ground, its walls made of earth and roof of earth and brush.

The Ohlone probably practiced ''[[Kuksu (religion)|Kuksu]]'', a form of [[shamanism]] shared by many Central and Northern California tribes. Although, it is also possible that the Ohlone people learned Kuksu from other tribes while at the missions. Kuksu included elaborate acting and dancing ceremonies in traditional costume, an annual mourning ceremony, puberty [[rites of passage]], intervention with the [[Spirit|spirit world]] and an all-male society that met in subterranean dance rooms.<ref>Bear Shamanism, Kroeber, 1925:472.

However Kroeber observed less \"specialized [[cosmogony]]\" in the Ohlone, which he termed one of the \"southern Kuksu-dancing groups\", in comparison to the [[Maidu]] and groups in the [[Sacramento Valley]]; he noted \"if, as seems probable, the southerly Kuksu tribes (the Miwok, Costanoans, Esselen, and northernmost Yokuts) had no real society in connection with their Kuksu ceremonies.\"<ref>Kroeber, 1925:445.</ref>\n\nThe conditions upon which the Ohlone joined the Spanish missions are subject to debate. Some have argued that they were forced to convert to [[Catholicism]], while others have insisted that forced baptism was not recognized by the Catholic Church. All who have looked into the matter agree, however, that baptized Indians who tried to leave mission communities were forced to return. The first conversions to Catholicism were at Mission San Carlos Borromeo, alias Carmel, in 1771. In the San Francisco Bay area the first baptisms occurred at Mission San Francisco in 1777. Many first-generation Mission Era conversions to Catholicism were debatably incomplete and \"external\".<ref>Costo & Costo, 1987, develop the argument for forced conversion; Sandos, 2004, emphasizes conversion through the attractions of modern technology and music; Milliken, 1995:67, discusses first baptisms and conversions to Catholicism at Mission San Francisco; Bean, 1994:279\u2013281 discusses first-generation conversions to Catholicism as incomplete and external.</ref>\n[[File:Coiffures_du_danse_Choris.jpg|thumb|Watercolor of traditional Ohlone headdresses by [[Louis Choris]]]]\n\nIt is apparent that the pre-contact Ohlone had distinguished medicine persons among their tribe.

These lodges were built near stream banks because water was believed to be capable of great healing. Men and women would gather in the sweat lodges to \"cleanse, purify, and empower themselves\" for a task like hunting and spirit dancing.<ref name=\"Teixiera 1991\" /> Today, there is a place located in Hollister called [[Indian Canyon, California|Indian Canyon]], where a traditional sweat lodge, or Tupentak, has been built for the same ceremonial purposes. Along with the development of the sweat lodge in the early 1990s, the construction of an upen- tah-ruk, or round house/assembly house, was underway as well. These areas are meant to provide a gathering place for tribal meetings, traditional dances and ceremonies, and education activities.<ref name=\"Sayers 1994 350\u2013355\">{{cite book|last=Sayers|first=Anne|title=In Breath So It Is in Spirit:The Story of Indian Canyon|date=1994|publisher=Ballena|pages=350\u2013355}}</ref> Indian Canyon is an important place because it is open to all Native American groups in the United States and around the world as a place to hold traditional native practices without federal restrictions. Indian Canyon is also home to many Ohlone people, specifically of the Mutsun band, and serves as an educational, cultural, and spiritual environment for all visitors. Indian Canyon allows Natives to reclaim their heritage and implement their ancestral beliefs and practices into their lives.<ref name=\"Sayers 1994 350\u2013355\" />\n\n===Sacred narratives and mythology===\n\nThe storytelling of sacred narratives has been an important component of Ohlone indigenous culture for thousands of years, and continues to be of importance today. The narratives often teach specific moral or spiritual lessons, and are illustrative of the cultural, spiritual, and religious beliefs of the tribe. Because not all the Ohlone bands shared a unified identity, and therefore have varying religious and spiritual beliefs, the stories are unique to the tribe. Today, sacred narratives are still an important part of the Ohlone culture. Sadly, only a minimal number of sacred stories have survived Spanish colonization during the 1700s and 1800s due to ethnographic efforts in the Missions. Many Ohlone bands refer to anthropologic records to reconstruct their sacred narratives because some Ohlone people living in the missions acted as \"professional consultants\" for anthropologic research, and therefore told their past stories.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramirez|first=Louise|title=The Ohlone/Costanoan-Esselen Nation of Monterey, California: Dispossession, Federal Neglect, and the Bitter Irony of the Federal Acknowledgment Process|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=47\u201371|doi=10.1353/wic.2003.0015|year=2003}}</ref> The problem with this type of recording is that the stories are not always complete due to translation differences where meaning can be easily misunderstood.\n\nTherefore, many Ohlone bands today feel responsible for re-adopting these narratives and discussing them with cultural representatives and other Ohlone people to decide what their meanings are. This process is important because the Ohlone can further piece together a cultural identity of their past ancestors, and ultimately for themselves as well. Additionally, through knowing sacred narratives and sharing them with the public through live performances or storytelling, the Ohlone people are able to create an awareness that their cultural group is not extinct, but actually surviving and wanting recognition.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramirez|first=Louise|title=The Ohlone/Costanoan-Esselen Nation of Monterey, California:Dispossession, Federal Neglect, and the Bitter Irony of the Federal Acknowledgment Process|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1353/wic.2003.0015|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nOhlone folklore and legend centered around the Californian [[culture hero]]es of the [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]] trickster spirit, as well as Eagle and Hummingbird (and in the Chochenyo region, a falcon-like being named Kaknu).

The Ohlone territory consisted of the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula down to Big Sur in the south. There were more than fifty Ohlone landholding groups prior to the arrival of the Spanish Missionaries. The Ohlone were able to thrive in this area by hunting, fishing, and gathering, in the typical pattern found in California coastal tribes. Each of the Ohlone villages interacted with each other through trade, intermarriage, and ceremonial events, as well as through occasional conflict.<ref>{{cite book|last=Teixeira|first=Lauren|title=Access to information on the Costanoan/Ohlone Indians of the San Francisco and Monterey Bay area: a descriptive guide to research.|date=1991|publisher=Masters Thesis}}</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone culture was relatively stable until the first Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived with the double-purpose of Christianizing the Native Americans by building a series of [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] and of expanding Spanish territorial claims. The Rumsien were the first Ohlone people to be encountered and documented in Spanish records when, in 1602, explorer [[Sebastian Vizca\u00edno]] reached and named the area that is now [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] in December of that year. Despite Vizca\u00edno's positive reports, nothing further happened for more than 160 years. It was not until 1769 that the next Spanish expedition arrived in Monterey, led by [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]]. This time, the [[Spanish missions in California#Military districts|military expedition]] was accompanied by [[Franciscan]] missionaries, whose purpose was to establish a chain of missions to bring Christianity to the native people. Under the leadership of Father [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]], the missions introduced Spanish religion and culture to the Ohlone.<ref>For Spanish missionaries and colonization, Teixeira, 1997:3; Fink, 1972:29\u201330.

Under Father Serra's leadership, the Spanish Franciscans erected seven missions inside the Ohlone region and brought most of the Ohlone into these missions to live and work. The missions erected within the Ohlone region were: [[Mission San Carlos Borrom\u00e9o de Carmelo]] (founded in 1770), [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] (founded in 1776), [[Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds]] (founded in 1777), [[Mission Santa Cruz]] (founded in 1791), [[Mission Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad]] (founded in 1791), [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jos\u00e9]] (founded in 1797), and [[Mission San Juan Bautista]] (founded in 1797). The Ohlone who went to live at the missions were called [[Mission Indians]], and also ''[[:wikt:neophyte|neophytes]].'' They were blended with other Native American ethnicities such as the [[Coast Miwok]] transported from the North Bay into the Mission San Francisco and Mission San Jos\u00e9.<ref>Mission name list only; dates from Wikipedia related article.

The Spanish soldiers traditionally escorted the Franciscans on missionary outreach daytrips but declined to camp overnight. For the first twenty years, the missions accepted a few converts at a time, slowly gaining population. Between November 1794 and May 1795, a large wave of Bay Area Native Americans were [[baptism|baptized]] and moved into Mission Santa Clara and Mission San Francisco, including 360 people to Mission Santa Clara and the entire Huichun village populations of the East Bay to Mission San Francisco. In March 1795, this migration was followed almost immediately by the worst-seen epidemic, as well as food shortages, resulting in alarming statistics of death and escapes from the missions. In pursuing the runaways, the Franciscans sent neophytes first and (as a last resort) soldiers to go round up the runaway \"Christians\" from their relatives, and bring them back to the missions. By running to tribes outside of the missions, escapees and those sent to bring them back to the mission spread illness outside of the missions.<ref>For events of 1795\u20131796, Milliken, 1995:129\u2013134 (\"Mass Migration in Winter of 1794\u201395\").

Other causes were a drastic diet change from hunter and gatherer fare to a diet high in carbohydrates and low in vegetables and animal protein, harsh lifestyle changes, and unsanitary living conditions.<ref name=\"Bean 1994\"/>\n\n====Land and property disputes====\n\nUnder Spanish rule, the intent for the future of the mission properties is difficult to ascertain. Property disputes arose over who owned the mission (and adjacent) lands, between the Spanish crown, the Catholic Church, the Natives and the Spanish settlers of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]: There were \"heated debates\" between \"the Spanish State and ecclesiastical bureaucracies\" over the government authority of the missions. Setting the precedent in an interesting petition to the Governor in 1782, the Franciscan priests claimed the \"Missions Indians\" owned both land and cattle, and they represented the Natives in a petition against the San Jose settlers. The fathers mentioned the \"Indians' crops\" were being damaged by the San Jose settlers' livestock and also mentioned settlers \"getting mixed up with the livestock belonging to the Indians from the mission.\"  They also stated the Mission Indians had property and rights to defend it: \"Indians are at liberty to slaughter such (San Jose pueblo) livestock as trespass unto their lands.\" \"By law\", the mission property was to pass to the Mission Indians after a period of about ten years, when they would become Spanish citizens. In the interim period, the Franciscans were mission administrators who held the land in trust for the Natives.<ref>For \"heated debates\" between church and state, Milliken, 1995:2n. For petition of 1782, Indians vs. settlers of San Jose, with quotations, see Milliken, 1995:72\u201373 (quoting Murguia and Pena [1782] 1955:400).

At this point, the Ohlone were supposed to receive land grants and property rights, but few did and most of the mission lands went to the secular administrators. In the end, even attempts by mission leaders to restore native lands were in vain. Before this time, 73 Spanish land grants had already been deeded in all of [[Alta California]], but with the new r\u00e9gime most lands were turned into Mexican-owned rancherias. The Ohlone became the laborers and ''vaqueros'' (cowboys) of Mexican-owned rancherias.<ref>Fink, 1972:64: \"Land grants were scarce; In 1830 only 50 private ranches were held in Alta California, of which 7 were in the Monterey region.\" For number of land grants, see Cowan 1956:139\u2013140. For Mission secularizarion to rancherias, Teixeira, 1997:3; Bean, 1994:234; Fink, 1972:63.</ref>\n\n===Survival===\n[[File:Isabel Meadows.jpg|thumb|[[Isabel Meadows]], considered the last fluent speaker of an Ohlone language]]\nThe Ohlone eventually regathered in multi-ethnic rancherias, along with other Mission Indians from families that spoke the [[Coast Miwok]], [[Bay Miwok]], [[Plains Miwok]], [[Patwin]], [[Yokuts]], and [[Esselen]] languages. Many of the Ohlone that had survived the experience at Mission San Jose went to work at ''Alisal Rancheria'' in [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]], and ''El Molino'' in [[Niles, California|Niles]]. Communities of mission survivors also formed in [[Sunol, California|Sunol]], Monterey and [[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan Bautista]]. In the 1840s a wave of United States settlers encroached into the area, and California became annexed to the United States. The new settlers brought in new diseases to the Ohlone.<ref>Teixeira, 1997:3\u20134, \"Historical Overview\".</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone lost the vast majority of their population between 1780 and 1850, because of an abysmal birth rate, high infant mortality rate, diseases and social upheaval associated with European immigration into California. By all estimates, the Ohlone were reduced to less than ten percent of their original pre-mission era population. By 1852 the Ohlone population had shrunk to about 864\u20131,000, and was continuing to decline. By the early 1880s, the northern Ohlone were virtually extinct, and the southern Ohlone people were severely impacted and largely displaced from their communal land grant in the [[Carmel Valley, San Diego, California|Carmel Valley]]. To call attention to the plight of the California Indians, Indian Agent, reformer, and popular novelist [[Helen Hunt Jackson]] published accounts of her travels among the Mission Indians of California in 1883.<ref>For population estimates, Cook, 1976a:183, 236\u2013245.

Before the Spanish invasion, the Muwekma Ohlone had an estimated 500 shellmounds lining the sea and shores of the San Francisco Bay. Shellmounds are essentially Ohlone habitation sites where peopled lived and died and often buried. The mounds consist predominately of molluscan shells, with lesser amounts mammal and fish bone, vegetal materials and other organic material deposited by the Ohlone for thousands of years. These shellmounds are the direct result of village life. Archaeologists have examined the mounds and often refer to them as \"middens,\" or \"kitchen midden\" meaning an accumulation of refuse. \n\nOne theory is that the massive amount of shellfish remains represent Ohlone ritual behavior, whereas they would spend months mourning their dead and feasting on large amounts of shellfish which were disposed of ever growing the girth and height of the mound.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cartier|first=Robert|title=Santa Cruz County History - Spanish Period & Earlier.}}</ref>{{fact|date=May 2019}} Shellmounds were once found all over the San Francisco Bay area near marshlands, creeks, wetlands, and rivers. San Bruno Mountain is home to the nation's largest intact shellmound. These mounds are also thought to have served a practical purpose as well, since these shellmounds were usually near waterways or the ocean, they protected the village from high tide as well as to provide high ground for line of sight navigation for watercraft on San Francisco Bay.<ref>{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=Unacknowledged Tribes, Dangerous Knowledge: The Muwekma Ohlone and How Indian Identities Are \"Known\".|date=2003}}</ref> The [[Emeryville Shellmound]] is a site standing at over 60 feet (18 m) tall and 350 feet (105 m) in diameter, and was believed to be occupied between 400 and 2800 years ago.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe Ohlone burial practices changed over time with cremation being preferred before the arrival of the Spanish. Once the cremation was complete the loved ones and friends would place ornaments as well as other valuables as an offering to the dead. Ohlone believed that this would give them good fortune in the afterlife. Many of these artifacts have been found in and around the shellmounds. They often include a wide variety of shell beads and ornaments as well as frequently used everyday items such as stone and bone tools. These burials also showcase genealogies and territorial rights. The mounds were seen as a cultural statement because the villages on top were clearly visible and their sacred aura was very dominant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Heizer|first=Robert|title=The California Indians; a Source Book|url=https://archive.org/details/californiaindia00heiz|url-access=registration|date=1971|location=Berkeley: University of California.}}</ref>\n\n===Present day burial and sacred sites===\n\n'''Glen Cove'''\n\nOhlone tribes have protested in Vallejo, California and insist that Glen Cove, a sacred site for many Natives, is one of the last native village sites in the San Francisco Bay that has escaped urban development. Ohlone feel that the public land should remain undisturbed.

Natives today are engaging in extensive cultural research to bring back knowledge, narratives, beliefs, and practices of the post-contact days with the Spanish. The Spanish eradicated and stripped the Ohlones of their cultural heritage by causing the death of ninety percent of the population, and forcing cultural assimilation with military fortification and Catholic reform. After the arrival of the Americans, many land grants were contested in court.  Preserving their burial sites is a way to gain acknowledgment as a cultural group.<ref>{{cite book|last=Margolin|first=Malcolm|title=The Ohlone Way: Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area.|url=https://archive.org/details/ohlonewayindianl00marg_0|url-access=registration|date=1978|publisher=Heyday|location=Berkeley}}</ref>\n\n'''Site CA-SCL-732- Kaphan Umux or Three Wolves Site'''\n\nThe Muwekma Ohlone tribe are active participants in the revival of Ohlone people across the East and South Bay. Key to their success is in their involvement in unearthing and analyzing their ancestral remains in ancient burial sites, which allows them to \"recapture their history and to reconstruct the present and future of their people\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=\"What Must It Have Been Like!\": Critical Considerations of Precontact Ohlone Cosmology as Interpreted through Central California Ethnohistory.|publisher=Wicazo Sa Review}}</ref> Due to Spanish colonization in the 1700s so much cultural history, knowledge, and identity was lost due to death and forced assimilation of so many natives. Only some sacred cultural narratives survive through the recording of stories told from various Ohlone elders living in the missions between 1769\u20131833. This makes analyzing pre-contact Ohlone sites so difficult because so much of the symbolism and ritual are unknown. Therefore, the Muwekma see their participation in archeological projects as a way to bring tribal members together as a unified community, and as a way to reestablish the link between the Ohlone people today and their pre-contact ancestors through their ability to analyze remains and be coauthors in the archeological reports.<ref name=\"Field 2003\">{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=What Must It Have Been Like!\": Critical Considerations of Precontact Ohlone Cosmology as Interpreted through Central California Ethnohistory.|date=2003|publisher=Wicazo Sa Review}}</ref> One major archeological site the Muwekma tribe actively helped excavate, is the burial site CA-SCL-732 in San Jose, dating between 1500-2700 BCE. In this burial site, excavated in 1992, the remains of three ritually buried wolves were found among human remains.<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/> In other grave site, the skeletal remains of two more wolves were found with \"braided, uncured yucca or soap root fiber cordage around their necks\".<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/> There were many other fragments of remains of animals like deer, squirrel, mountain lion, grizzly bear, fox, badger, blue goose, and elk found as well. From the excavations it is clear that the animals were ritually buried, along with beads and other ornamentations.<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/>\n\nAlthough the truth may not be known about exactly what these findings mean, the Muwekma and the archeological team analyzed the ritual burial of the animal remains as a way to learn what they may tell about the Ohlone cosmology and cultural system before pre-contact influence. One way the team did this was utilizing known narratives of the Ohlone, as ascribed by previous ethnographers who recorded the sacred narratives of various Ohlone elders in the missions across the Bay, well as the narratives telling of other central California cosmologies to make references about what the meaning of the possible kinship between the animals and the Ohlone in these burials were. Together the archeological team made three hypotheses: animals served as \"moieties, clans, lineages, families, and so on,\" animals were \"dream helpers,\" or personal spirit allies for individuals, and lastly, the animals were representations of \"sacred deity-like figures\".<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/>\n\n===Indian People Organizing for Change===\nIndian People Organizing for Change (IPOC) is a community-based organization in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The Spanish explorers and settlers referred to the native groups of this region collectively as the ''Coste\u00f1os'' (the \"coastal people\") circa 1769. Over time, the English-speaking settlers arriving later [[Anglicized]] the word ''Coste\u00f1os'' into the name of ''Costanoans.'' (The suffix \"-an\" is English). For many years, the people were called the Costanoans in English language and records.<ref name=\"Teix-pg4\">Teixeira, 1997:4, \"The Term 'Costanoan/Ohlone'\".</ref>\n\nSince the 1960s, the name of Ohlone has been used by some of the members and the popular media to replace the name ''Costanoan.'' ''Ohlone'' might have originally derived from a Spanish rancho called ''Oljon'', and referred to a single band who inhabited the Pacific Coast near [[Pescadero, California|Pescadero]] Creek. The name ''Ohlone'' was traced by Teixeira through the mission records of Mission San Francisco, Bancroft's ''Native Races'', and Frederick Beechey's Journal regarding a visit to the Bay Area in 1826\u201327. ''Oljone'', ''Olchones'' and ''Alchones'' are spelling variations of ''Ohlone'' found in Mission San Francisco records. However, because of its tribal origin, Ohlone is not universally accepted by the native people, and some members prefer to either to continue to use the name Costanoan or to revitalize and be known as the ''Muwekma''. Teixeira maintains Ohlone is the common usage since 1960, which has been traced back to the Rancho Oljon on the Pescadero Creek. Teixeira states in part: \"A tribe that once existed along the San Mateo County coast.\" Milliken states the name came from: \"A tribe on the lower drainages of San Gregorio Creek and Pescadero Creek on the Pacific Coast\".<!--CITATIONS:--><ref>Opinions and quotations, Teixeira 1997:4; Milliken, 1995:249.</ref>\n\n==Divisions==\n{{See also|List of Ohlone villages}}\nLinguists identified eight regional, linguistic divisions or subgroups of the Ohlone, listed below from north to south:<ref>Levy, 1978:485\u2013486; Teixeira, 1997:37\u201338, \"Linguistics\"; and Milliken, 1995:24\u201326, \"Linguistic Landscape\".

Note the number of 26,000 includes Salinans</ref> Historians differ widely in their estimates, as they do with the entire [[population of Native California]]. However, modern researchers{{who|date=April 2014}} believe that American anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]]'s projection of 7,000&nbsp;Ohlone \"Costanoans\" was much too low. Later researchers such as [[Richard L. Levy|Richard Levy]] estimated \"10,000 or more\" Ohlone.<ref name=\"Levy, 1978:486\"/>\n\nThe highest estimate comes from [[Sherburne F. Cook]], who in later life concluded there were 26,000 Ohlone and Salinans in the \"Northern Mission Area\". Per Cook, the \"Northern Mission Area\" means \"the region inhabited by the Costanoans and Salinans between San Francisco Bay and the headwaters of the Salinas River. To this may be added for convenience the local area under the jurisdiction of the San Luis Obispo even though there is an infringement of the Chumash.\" In this model, the Ohlone people's territory was one half of the \"Northern Mission Area\". It was however known to be more densely populated than the southern Salinan territory, per Cook: \"The Costanoan density was nearly 1.8 persons per square mile with the maximum in the Bay region. The Esselen was approximately 1.3, the Salinan must have been still lower.\" We can estimate that Cook meant about 18,200 Ohlone based on his own statements (70% of \"Northern Mission Area\"), plus or minus a few thousand margin for error, but he does not give an exact number.<ref>For definition of 'Northern Mission area\", Cook, 1976b:20. For density of populations, Cook, 1976a:187.</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone population after contact in 1769 with the Spaniards spiralled downwards. Cook describes rapidly declining indigenous populations in California between 1769 and 1900, in his posthumously published book, ''The Population of the California Indians, 1769\u20131970.'' Cook states in part: \"Not until the population figures are examined does the extent of the havoc become evident.\"  The population had dropped to about 10% of its original numbers by 1848.<ref>For quotation, see Cook, 1976b:200. For population in 1848, see Cook, 1976a:105.</ref>\n\nThe population stabilized after 1900, and as of 2005 there were at least 1,400 on tribal membership rolls.<ref>For tribal membership rolls, Muwekma Ohlone Tribe homepage, 397 members; Amah-Mutsun Band homepage, over 500 members; and Ohlone/Costanoan\u2014Esselen Nation homepage, approximately 500 members.</ref>\n\n==Language==\n{{details|Ohlone languages}}\nThe Ohlone language family is commonly called \"Costanoan\", sometimes \"Ohlone\". Ohlone is classified with Miwok under the label [[Utian languages|Utian]]. The controversial [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] language phylum groups the Utian languages with other languages spoken in California, Oregon, and Washington. The most recent work suggests that Ohlone, Miwok, and Yokuts may all be sub-families within a single [[Yok-Utian languages|Yok-Utian]] language family.<ref>Utian and Penutian classification: Levy, 1978:485\u2013486 (citing Kroeber), Callaghan 1997, Golla 2007. Yok-Utian as a taxonomic category: Callaghan 1997, 2001; Golla 2007:76.</ref>\n\nEight dialects or languages of Ohlone have been recorded: [[Awaswas language|Awaswas]], [[Chalon language|Chalon]], [[Chochenyo language|Chochenyo]] (aka Choche\u00f1o), [[Karkin language|Karkin]], [[Mutsun language|Mutsun]], [[Ramaytush language|Ramaytush]], [[Rumsen language|Rumsen]], and [[Tamyen language|Tamyen]].\n\n==Salvaging records==\nThe [[chroniclers]], [[ethnohistorian]]s, and [[ethnolinguist|linguist]]s of the Ohlone population began with: [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] who researched the California natives and authored a few publications on the Ohlone from 1904 to 1910, and [[Clinton Hart Merriam|C. Hart Merriam]] who researched the Ohlone in detail from 1902 to 1929. This was followed by [[John Peabody Harrington|John P. Harrington]] who researched the Ohlone languages from 1921 to 1939, and other aspects of Ohlone culture, leaving volumes of field notes at his death. Other research was added by Robert Cartier, Madison S. Beeler, and [[Sherburne F. Cook]], to name a few. In many cases, the Ohlone names they used vary in spelling, translation and tribal boundaries, depending on the source. Each tried to [[chronicle]] and interpret this complex society and language(s) before the pieces vanished.<ref>Historians and research years, Teixeira, 1997, biographical articles; notably page 34: \"John Peabody Harrington\". Variances in data and interpretation can be noted in main published references Kroeber, Merriam, Harrington, Cook.</ref>\n\nThere was noticeable competition and some disagreement between the first scholars: Both Merriam and Harrington produced much in-depth Ohlone research in the shadow of the highly published Kroeber and competed in print with him. In the ''Editor's Introduction'' to ''Merriam (1979)'', Robert F. Heizer (as the protege of Kroeber and also the curator of Merriam's work) states \"both men disliked A. L. Kroeber.\"  Harrington, independently working for the Smithsonian Institution cornered most of the Ohlone research as his own specialty, was \"not willing to share his findings with Kroeber&nbsp;... Kroeber and his students neglected the Chumash and Costanoans, but this was done because Harrington made it quite clear that he would resent Kroeber's 'muscling in.{{'\"}}<ref>Quotation \"both men disliked Kroeber\" said by Heizer, in \"Editor's Intro\" of Merriam (1979).

When Spanish explorers and missionaries arrived in the late 18th century, the Ohlone inhabited the area along the coast from [[San Francisco Bay]] through [[Monterey Bay]] to the lower [[Salinas Valley]]. At that time they spoke a variety of related languages. The [[Ohlone languages]] make up a sub-family of the [[Utian languages|Utian language]] family.<ref>Callaghan 1997</ref> Older proposals place Utian within the [[Penutian language|Penutian]] language phylum, while newer proposals group it as [[Yok-Utian languages|Yok-Utian]].\n\nBritish ethnologist [[Robert Gordon Latham]] originally used the term \"Costanoan\" to refer to the linguistically similar but ethnically diverse Native American tribes in the San Francisco Bay Area.<ref>{{cite journal |title=On the Languages of Northern, Western and Central America |author=Latham, R. G. |year=1856 |journal=Transactions of the Philological Society |pages=82-84}}</ref> The term \"Ohlone\" has been used in place of \"Costanoan\" since the early 1900s by some tribal groups and, in 1967, American anthropologist [[Clinton Hart Merriam]] first published the term \"Ohlonean\" to refer to the Costanoan peoples.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Ethnographic Notes on California Indian Tribes, III: Central California Indian Tribes |author=Merriam, C.

They lived by hunting, fishing, and gathering, in the typical ethnographic California pattern. The members of these various bands interacted freely with one another. The Ohlone people practiced the [[Kuksu (religion)|Kuksu]] religion. Prior to the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]], the northern California region was one of the most densely populated regions north of Mexico.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Ohlone Way: Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area|last = Margolin|first = Malcolm|publisher = Heyday Books|year = 1978|isbn = 978-0930588014|location = Berkeley, California|pages = |url = https://archive.org/details/ohlonewayindianl00marg_0}}</ref> \n\nHowever, the arrival of Spanish colonizers to the area in 1769 vastly changed tribal life forever. The Spanish constructed [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] along the California coast with the objective of Christianizing the native people and culture. Between the years 1769 and 1834, the number of Indigenous Californians dropped from 300,000 to 250,000. After California entered into the Union in 1850, the state government perpetrated massacres against the Ohlone people. Many of the leaders of these massacres were rewarded with positions in state and federal government.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/revealing-the-history-of-genocide-against-californias-native-americans | title=Revealing the history of genocide against California's Native Americans|work=UCLA Newsroom|first=Jessica |last=Wolf | date=August 15, 2017|access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref> These massacres have been described as [[genocide]].

The Muwekma Ohlone Tribe has members from around the San Francisco Bay Area, and is composed of descendants of the Ohlones/Costanoans from the San Jose, Santa Clara, and San Francisco missions. The Ohlone/Costanoan Esselen Nation, consisting of descendants of intermarried [[Rumsen tribe|Rumsen]] Costanoan and [[Esselen]] speakers of Mission San Carlos Borromeo, are centered at Monterey. The Amah-Mutsun Tribe are descendants of [[Mutsun tribe|Mutsun]] Costanoan speakers of Mission San Juan Bautista, inland from Monterey Bay. Most members of another group of Rumsien language, descendants from Mission San Carlos, the Costanoan Rumsien Carmel Tribe of Pomona/Chino, now live in southern California. These groups, and others with smaller memberships (see groups listed under the heading ''Present Day'' below) are separately petitioning the federal government for [[Federally recognized tribes|tribal recognition]].\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Choris Ohlone.jpg|thumb|Ohlone people painted by [[Louis Choris]]]]\n\n=== Pre-Contact Lifestyle ===\nThe Ohlone inhabited fixed village locations, moving temporarily to gather seasonal foodstuffs like [[acorn]]s and berries. The Ohlone people lived in Northern California from the northern tip of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] down to northern region of [[Big Sur]], and from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the [[Diablo Range]] in the east. Their vast region included the San Francisco Peninsula, [[Santa Clara Valley]], [[Santa Cruz Mountains]], [[Monterey Bay|Monterey Bay area]], as well as present-day [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]], [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]] and the [[Salinas Valley]]. Prior to Spanish contact, the Ohlone formed a complex association of approximately 50&nbsp;different \"nations or tribes\" with about 50 to 500 members each, with an average of 200. Over 50&nbsp;distinct Ohlone tribes and villages have been recorded. The Ohlone villages interacted through trade, intermarriage and ceremonial events, as well as some [[wiktionary:internecine|internecine]] conflict. Cultural arts included [[basket-weaving]] skills, seasonal ceremonial dancing events, female [[tattoo]]s, ear and nose piercings, and other ornamentation.<ref>For habitation region, Kroeber, 1925:462.

These food sources were abundant in earlier times and maintained by careful work, and through active management of all the natural resources at hand.<ref>Controlled burning as harvesting, Brown 1973:3,4,25; Levy 1978:491; Stanger, 1969:94; Bean and Lawton, 1973:11,30,39 (Lewis).

Waterfowl were the most important birds in the people's diet, which were captured with nets and decoys. The Chochenyo traditional narratives refer to ducks as food, and [[Juan Cresp\u00ed]] observed in his journal that geese were stuffed and dried \"to use as decoys in hunting others\".<ref>All the animals, except waterfowl and quail, Teixeira, 1997:2.

In fact, there were so many sea lions that according to Crespi it \"looked like a pavement\" to the incoming Spanish.<ref>Quotation from Crespi, \"sea lion pavement\" Teixeira, 1997:2.</ref>\n\nIn general, along the bayshore and valleys, the Ohlone constructed dome-shaped houses of woven or bundled mats of tules, 6 to 20 feet (1.8 to 6 m) in diameter. In hills where [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] trees were accessible, they built conical houses from redwood bark attached to a frame of wood. Residents of Monterey recall Redwood houses. One of the main village buildings, the [[sweat lodge]] was low into the ground, its walls made of earth and roof of earth and brush. They built [[Balsa (ship)|boats]] of [[Schoenoplectus acutus|tule]] to navigate on the bays propelled by double-bladed paddles.<ref>Tule rush houses, redwood houses and sweat lodges, Teixeira, 1997:2. Redwood houses in Monterey, Kroeber, 1925:468. Tule boats, Kroeber, 1925:468.</ref>\n\nGenerally, men did not wear clothing in warm weather. In cold weather, they might don animal skin capes or feather capes. Women commonly wore deerskin aprons, [[tule]] skirts, or shredded bark skirts. On cool days, they also wore animal skin capes. Both wore ornamentation of necklaces, shell beads and abalone pendants, and bone wood earrings with shells and beads. The ornamentation often indicated status within their community.<ref>Clothing and ornamentation, Teixeira, 1997:2.</ref>\n\n===Ethnobotany===\nA full list of their [[ethnobotany]] can be found at http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/50/ (430 documented plant uses) and http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/51/ (6 documented plant uses).[[File:Ohlone.jpg|thumb|Ohlone dancers drawn by [[Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius von Tilenau]]]]\n\n===Kuksu Religion===\n\nResearchers are sensitive to limitations in historical knowledge, and careful not to place the spiritual and religious beliefs of all Ohlone people into a single unified worldview.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scolari|first=P.|title=Photographs Link Ohlone Past and Present|journal=News from Native California|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=20\u201321}}</ref> Due to the displacement of Indian people in the Missions between 1769\u20131833, cultural groups are working as ethnographers to discover for themselves their ancestral history, and what that information tells about them as a cultural group.

The Ohlone probably practiced ''[[Kuksu (religion)|Kuksu]]'', a form of [[shamanism]] shared by many Central and Northern California tribes. Although, it is also possible that the Ohlone people learned Kuksu from other tribes while at the missions. Kuksu included elaborate acting and dancing ceremonies in traditional costume, an annual mourning ceremony, puberty [[rites of passage]], intervention with the [[Spirit|spirit world]] and an all-male society that met in subterranean dance rooms.<ref>Bear Shamanism, Kroeber, 1925:472. Observation that Kuksu may have been learned at missions, Kroeber, 1925:470. Kuksu description and ceremony types, Kroeber, 1907b, online as ''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/ca/ric The Religion of the Indians of California]''; See also: ''[http://www.maidu.com/maidu/maiduculture/kuksu.html The Kuksu Cult - paraphrased from Kroeber]''. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311094423/http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/ca/ric |date=March 11, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nKuksu was shared with other indigenous ethnic groups of Central California, such as their neighbors the [[Miwok]] and [[Esselen]], also [[Maidu]], [[Pomo people|Pomo]], and northernmost [[Yokuts]]. However Kroeber observed less \"specialized [[cosmogony]]\" in the Ohlone, which he termed one of the \"southern Kuksu-dancing groups\", in comparison to the [[Maidu]] and groups in the [[Sacramento Valley]]; he noted \"if, as seems probable, the southerly Kuksu tribes (the Miwok, Costanoans, Esselen, and northernmost Yokuts) had no real society in connection with their Kuksu ceremonies.\"<ref>Kroeber, 1925:445.</ref>\n\nThe conditions upon which the Ohlone joined the Spanish missions are subject to debate. Some have argued that they were forced to convert to [[Catholicism]], while others have insisted that forced baptism was not recognized by the Catholic Church. All who have looked into the matter agree, however, that baptized Indians who tried to leave mission communities were forced to return. The first conversions to Catholicism were at Mission San Carlos Borromeo, alias Carmel, in 1771. In the San Francisco Bay area the first baptisms occurred at Mission San Francisco in 1777. Many first-generation Mission Era conversions to Catholicism were debatably incomplete and \"external\".<ref>Costo & Costo, 1987, develop the argument for forced conversion; Sandos, 2004, emphasizes conversion through the attractions of modern technology and music; Milliken, 1995:67, discusses first baptisms and conversions to Catholicism at Mission San Francisco; Bean, 1994:279\u2013281 discusses first-generation conversions to Catholicism as incomplete and external.</ref>\n[[File:Coiffures_du_danse_Choris.jpg|thumb|Watercolor of traditional Ohlone headdresses by [[Louis Choris]]]]\n\nIt is apparent that the pre-contact Ohlone had distinguished medicine persons among their tribe. Some of these people healed through the use of herbs, and some were shamans who were believed to heal through their ability to contact the spirit world.<ref name=\"Smith 2002 144\u2013155\">{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=C.R.|title=Ohlone Medicinal Uses of Plants|journal=Gathering of Voices: The Native Peoples of the California Central Coast|date=2002|pages=144\u2013155}}</ref> Some shamans typically engaged in more ritualistic healing in the form of dancing, ceremony, and singing.<ref name=\"Teixiera 1991\">{{cite journal|last=Teixiera|first=Lauren|title=Access to information on the Costanoan/Ohlone Indians of the San Francisco and Monterey Bay area: a descriptive guide to research.|journal=Master's Thesis|date=1991}}</ref> Some shamans were also believed to be able to tell and influence the future, therefore they were equally able to bring about fortune and misfortune among the community.<ref name=\"Smith 2002 144\u2013155\"/>\n\n====Indian Canyon: village houses / sweat lodges for ceremony and purification====\n\nAdditionally, some Ohlone bands built prayer houses, also called [[Sweat lodge|sweat lodges]], for ceremonial and spiritual purification purposes. These lodges were built near stream banks because water was believed to be capable of great healing. Men and women would gather in the sweat lodges to \"cleanse, purify, and empower themselves\" for a task like hunting and spirit dancing.<ref name=\"Teixiera 1991\" /> Today, there is a place located in Hollister called [[Indian Canyon, California|Indian Canyon]], where a traditional sweat lodge, or Tupentak, has been built for the same ceremonial purposes. Along with the development of the sweat lodge in the early 1990s, the construction of an upen- tah-ruk, or round house/assembly house, was underway as well. These areas are meant to provide a gathering place for tribal meetings, traditional dances and ceremonies, and education activities.<ref name=\"Sayers 1994 350\u2013355\">{{cite book|last=Sayers|first=Anne|title=In Breath So It Is in Spirit:The Story of Indian Canyon|date=1994|publisher=Ballena|pages=350\u2013355}}</ref> Indian Canyon is an important place because it is open to all Native American groups in the United States and around the world as a place to hold traditional native practices without federal restrictions. Indian Canyon is also home to many Ohlone people, specifically of the Mutsun band, and serves as an educational, cultural, and spiritual environment for all visitors. Indian Canyon allows Natives to reclaim their heritage and implement their ancestral beliefs and practices into their lives.<ref name=\"Sayers 1994 350\u2013355\" />\n\n===Sacred narratives and mythology===\n\nThe storytelling of sacred narratives has been an important component of Ohlone indigenous culture for thousands of years, and continues to be of importance today. The narratives often teach specific moral or spiritual lessons, and are illustrative of the cultural spiritual and religious beliefs of the tribe. Because not all the Ohlone bands shared a unified identity, and therefore have varying religious and spiritual beliefs, the stories are unique to the tribe. Today, sacred narratives are still an important part of the Ohlone culture. Sadly, only a minimal number of sacred stories have survived Spanish colonization during the 1700s and 1800s due to ethnographic efforts in the Missions. Many Ohlone bands refer to anthropologic records to reconstruct their sacred narratives because some Ohlone people living in the missions acted as \"professional consultants\" for anthropologic research, and therefore told their past stories.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramirez|first=Louise|title=The Ohlone/Costanoan-Esselen Nation of Monterey, California: Dispossession, Federal Neglect, and the Bitter Irony of the Federal Acknowledgment Process|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=47\u201371|doi=10.1353/wic.2003.0015|year=2003}}</ref> The problem with this type of recording is that the stories are not always complete due to translation differences where meaning can be easily misunderstood.\n\nTherefore, many Ohlone bands today feel responsible for re-adopting these narratives and discussing them with cultural representatives and other Ohlone people to decide what their meanings are. This process is important because the Ohlone can further piece together a cultural identity of their past ancestors, and ultimately for themselves as well. Additionally, through knowing sacred narratives and sharing them with the public through live performances or storytelling, the Ohlone people are able to create an awareness that their cultural group is not extinct, but actually surviving and wanting recognition.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramirez|first=Louise|title=The Ohlone/Costanoan-Esselen Nation of Monterey, California:Dispossession, Federal Neglect, and the Bitter Irony of the Federal Acknowledgment Process|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1353/wic.2003.0015|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nOhlone folklore and legend centered around the Californian [[culture hero]]es of the [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]] trickster spirit, as well as Eagle and Hummingbird (and in the Chochenyo region, a falcon-like being named Kaknu).

The Ohlone territory consisted of the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula down to Big Sur in the south. There were more than fifty Ohlone landholding groups prior to the arrival of the Spanish Missionaries. The Ohlone were able to thrive in this area by hunting, fishing, and gathering, in the typical pattern found in California coastal tribes. Each of the Ohlone villages interacted with each other through trade, intermarriage, and ceremonial events, as well as through occasional conflict.<ref>{{cite book|last=Teixeira|first=Lauren|title=Access to information on the Costanoan/Ohlone Indians of the San Francisco and Monterey Bay area: a descriptive guide to research.|date=1991|publisher=Masters Thesis}}</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone culture was relatively stable until the first Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived with the double-purpose of Christianizing the Native Americans by building a series of [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] and of expanding Spanish territorial claims. The Rumsien were the first Ohlone people to be encountered and documented in Spanish records when, in 1602, explorer [[Sebastian Vizca\u00edno]] reached and named the area that is now [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] in December of that year. Despite Vizca\u00edno's positive reports, nothing further happened for more than 160 years. It was not until 1769 that the next Spanish expedition arrived in Monterey, led by [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]]. This time, the [[Spanish missions in California#Military districts|military expedition]] was accompanied by [[Franciscan]] missionaries, whose purpose was to establish a chain of missions to bring Christianity to the native people. Under the leadership of Father [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]], the missions introduced Spanish religion and culture to the Ohlone.<ref>For Spanish missionaries and colonization, Teixeira, 1997:3; Fink, 1972:29\u201330.

Under Father Serra's leadership, the Spanish Franciscans erected seven missions inside the Ohlone region and brought most of the Ohlone into these missions to live and work. The missions erected within the Ohlone region were: [[Mission San Carlos Borrom\u00e9o de Carmelo]] (founded in 1770), [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] (founded in 1776), [[Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds]] (founded in 1777), [[Mission Santa Cruz]] (founded in 1791), [[Mission Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad]] (founded in 1791), [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jos\u00e9]] (founded in 1797), and [[Mission San Juan Bautista]] (founded in 1797). The Ohlone who went to live at the missions were called [[Mission Indians]], and also ''[[:wikt:neophyte|neophytes]].'' They were blended with other Native American ethnicities such as the [[Coast Miwok]] transported from the North Bay into the Mission San Francisco and Mission San Jos\u00e9.<ref>Mission name list only; dates from Wikipedia related article.

The Spanish soldiers traditionally escorted the Franciscans on missionary outreach daytrips but declined to camp overnight. For the first twenty years, the missions accepted a few converts at a time, slowly gaining population. Between November 1794 and May 1795, a large wave of Bay Area Native Americans were [[baptism|baptized]] and moved into Mission Santa Clara and Mission San Francisco, including 360 people to Mission Santa Clara and the entire Huichun village populations of the East Bay to Mission San Francisco. In March 1795, this migration was followed almost immediately by the worst-seen epidemic, as well as food shortages, resulting in alarming statistics of death and escapes from the missions. In pursuing the runaways, the Franciscans sent neophytes first and (as a last resort) soldiers to go round up the runaway \"Christians\" from their relatives, and bring them back to the missions. By running to tribes outside of the missions, escapees and those sent to bring them back to the mission spread illness outside of the missions.<ref>For events of 1795\u20131796, Milliken, 1995:129\u2013134 (\"Mass Migration in Winter of 1794\u201395\").

Other causes were a drastic diet change from hunter and gatherer fare to a diet high in carbohydrates and low in vegetables and animal protein, harsh lifestyle changes, and unsanitary living conditions.<ref name=\"Bean 1994\"/>\n\n====Land and property disputes====\n\nUnder Spanish rule, the intent for the future of the mission properties is difficult to ascertain. Property disputes arose over who owned the mission (and adjacent) lands, between the Spanish crown, the Catholic Church, the Natives and the Spanish settlers of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]: There were \"heated debates\" between \"the Spanish State and ecclesiastical bureaucracies\" over the government authority of the missions. Setting the precedent in an interesting petition to the Governor in 1782, the Franciscan priests claimed the \"Missions Indians\" owned both land and cattle, and they represented the Natives in a petition against the San Jose settlers. The fathers mentioned the \"Indians' crops\" were being damaged by the San Jose settlers' livestock and also mentioned settlers \"getting mixed up with the livestock belonging to the Indians from the mission.\"  They also stated the Mission Indians had property and rights to defend it: \"Indians are at liberty to slaughter such (San Jose pueblo) livestock as trespass unto their lands.\" \"By law\", the mission property was to pass to the Mission Indians after a period of about ten years, when they would become Spanish citizens. In the interim period, the Franciscans were mission administrators who held the land in trust for the Natives.<ref>For \"heated debates\" between church and state, Milliken, 1995:2n. For petition of 1782, Indians vs. settlers of San Jose, with quotations, see Milliken, 1995:72\u201373 (quoting Murguia and Pena [1782] 1955:400).

At this point, the Ohlone were supposed to receive land grants and property rights, but few did and most of the mission lands went to the secular administrators. In the end, even attempts by mission leaders to restore native lands were in vain. Before this time, 73 Spanish land grants had already been deeded in all of [[Alta California]], but with the new r\u00e9gime most lands were turned into Mexican-owned rancherias. The Ohlone became the laborers and ''vaqueros'' (cowboys) of Mexican-owned rancherias.<ref>Fink, 1972:64: \"Land grants were scarce; In 1830 only 50 private ranches were held in Alta California, of which 7 were in the Monterey region.\" For number of land grants, see Cowan 1956:139\u2013140. For Mission secularizarion to rancherias, Teixeira, 1997:3; Bean, 1994:234; Fink, 1972:63.</ref>\n\n===Survival===\n[[File:Isabel Meadows.jpg|thumb|[[Isabel Meadows]], considered the last fluent speaker of an Ohlone language]]\nThe Ohlone eventually regathered in multi-ethnic rancherias, along with other Mission Indians from families that spoke the [[Coast Miwok]], [[Bay Miwok]], [[Plains Miwok]], [[Patwin]], [[Yokuts]], and [[Esselen]] languages. Many of the Ohlone that had survived the experience at Mission San Jose went to work at ''Alisal Rancheria'' in [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]], and ''El Molino'' in [[Niles, California|Niles]]. Communities of mission survivors also formed in [[Sunol, California|Sunol]], Monterey and [[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan Bautista]]. In the 1840s a wave of United States settlers encroached into the area, and California became annexed to the United States. The new settlers brought in new diseases to the Ohlone.<ref>Teixeira, 1997:3\u20134, \"Historical Overview\".</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone lost the vast majority of their population between 1780 and 1850, because of an abysmal birth rate, high infant mortality rate, diseases and social upheaval associated with European immigration into California. By all estimates, the Ohlone were reduced to less than ten percent of their original pre-mission era population. By 1852 the Ohlone population had shrunk to about 864\u20131,000, and was continuing to decline. By the early 1880s, the northern Ohlone were virtually extinct, and the southern Ohlone people were severely impacted and largely displaced from their communal land grant in the [[Carmel Valley, San Diego, California|Carmel Valley]]. To call attention to the plight of the California Indians, Indian Agent, reformer, and popular novelist [[Helen Hunt Jackson]] published accounts of her travels among the Mission Indians of California in 1883.<ref>For population estimates, Cook, 1976a:183, 236\u2013245.

Before the Spanish invasion, the Muwekma Ohlone had an estimated 500 shellmounds lining the sea and shores of the San Francisco Bay. Shellmounds are essentially Ohlone habitation sites where peopled lived and died and often buried. The mounds consist predominately of molluscan shells, with lesser amounts mammal and fish bone, vegetal materials and other organic material deposited by the Ohlone for thousands of years. These shellmounds are the direct result of village life. Archaeologists have examined the mounds and often refer to them as \"middens,\" or \"kitchen midden\" meaning an accumulation of refuse. \n\nOne theory is that the massive amount of shellfish remains represent Ohlone ritual behavior, whereas they would spend months mourning their dead and feasting on large amounts of shellfish which were disposed of ever growing the girth and height of the mound.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cartier|first=Robert|title=Santa Cruz County History - Spanish Period & Earlier.}}</ref>{{fact|date=May 2019}} Shellmounds were once found all over the San Francisco Bay area near marshlands, creeks, wetlands, and rivers. San Bruno Mountain is home to the nation's largest intact shellmound. These mounds are also thought to have served a practical purpose as well, since these shellmounds were usually near waterways or the ocean, they protected the village from high tide as well as to provide high ground for line of sight navigation for watercraft on San Francisco Bay.<ref>{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=Unacknowledged Tribes, Dangerous Knowledge: The Muwekma Ohlone and How Indian Identities Are \"Known\".|date=2003}}</ref> The [[Emeryville Shellmound]] is a site standing at over 60 feet (18 m) tall and 350 feet (105 m) in diameter, and was believed to be occupied between 400 and 2800 years ago.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe Ohlone burial practices changed over time with cremation being preferred before the arrival of the Spanish. Once the cremation was complete the loved ones and friends would place ornaments as well as other valuables as an offering to the dead. Ohlone believed that this would give them good fortune in the afterlife. Many of these artifacts have been found in and around the shellmounds. They often include a wide variety of shell beads and ornaments as well as frequently used everyday items such as stone and bone tools. These burials also showcase genealogies and territorial rights. The mounds were seen as a cultural statement because the villages on top were clearly visible and their sacred aura was very dominant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Heizer|first=Robert|title=The California Indians; a Source Book|url=https://archive.org/details/californiaindia00heiz|url-access=registration|date=1971|location=Berkeley: University of California.}}</ref>\n\n===Present day burial and sacred sites===\n\n'''Glen Cove'''\n\nOhlone tribes have protested in Vallejo, California and insist that Glen Cove, a sacred site for many Natives, is one of the last native village sites in the San Francisco Bay that has escaped urban development. Ohlone feel that the public land should remain undisturbed.

Natives today are engaging in extensive cultural research to bring back knowledge, narratives, beliefs, and practices of the post-contact days with the Spanish. The Spanish eradicated and stripped the Ohlones of their cultural heritage by causing the death of ninety percent of the population, and forcing cultural assimilation with military fortification and Catholic reform. After the arrival of the Americans, many land grants were contested in court.  Preserving their burial sites is a way to gain acknowledgment as a cultural group.<ref>{{cite book|last=Margolin|first=Malcolm|title=The Ohlone Way: Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area.|url=https://archive.org/details/ohlonewayindianl00marg_0|url-access=registration|date=1978|publisher=Heyday|location=Berkeley}}</ref>\n\n'''Site CA-SCL-732- Kaphan Umux or Three Wolves Site'''\n\nThe Muwekma Ohlone tribe are active participants in the revival of Ohlone people across the East and South Bay. Key to their success is in their involvement in unearthing and analyzing their ancestral remains in ancient burial sites, which allows them to \"recapture their history and to reconstruct the present and future of their people\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=\"What Must It Have Been Like!\": Critical Considerations of Precontact Ohlone Cosmology as Interpreted through Central California Ethnohistory.|publisher=Wicazo Sa Review}}</ref> Due to Spanish colonization in the 1700s so much cultural history, knowledge, and identity was lost due to death and forced assimilation of so many natives. Only some sacred cultural narratives survive through the recording of stories told from various Ohlone elders living in the missions between 1769\u20131833. This makes analyzing pre-contact Ohlone sites so difficult because so much of the symbolism and ritual are unknown. Therefore, the Muwekma see their participation in archeological projects as a way to bring tribal members together as a unified community, and as a way to reestablish the link between the Ohlone people today and their pre-contact ancestors through their ability to analyze remains and be coauthors in the archeological reports.<ref name=\"Field 2003\">{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=What Must It Have Been Like!\": Critical Considerations of Precontact Ohlone Cosmology as Interpreted through Central California Ethnohistory.|date=2003|publisher=Wicazo Sa Review}}</ref> One major archeological site the Muwekma tribe actively helped excavate, is the burial site CA-SCL-732 in San Jose, dating between 1500-2700 BCE. In this burial site, excavated in 1992, the remains of three ritually buried wolves were found among human remains.<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/> In other grave site, the skeletal remains of two more wolves were found with \"braided, uncured yucca or soap root fiber cordage around their necks\".<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/> There were many other fragments of remains of animals like deer, squirrel, mountain lion, grizzly bear, fox, badger, blue goose, and elk found as well. From the excavations it is clear that the animals were ritually buried, along with beads and other ornamentations.<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/>\n\nAlthough the truth may not be known about exactly what these findings mean, the Muwekma and the archeological team analyzed the ritual burial of the animal remains as a way to learn what they may tell about the Ohlone cosmology and cultural system before pre-contact influence. One way the team did this was utilizing known narratives of the Ohlone, as ascribed by previous ethnographers who recorded the sacred narratives of various Ohlone elders in the missions across the Bay, well as the narratives telling of other central California cosmologies to make references about what the meaning of the possible kinship between the animals and the Ohlone in these burials were. Together the archeological team made three hypotheses: animals served as \"moieties, clans, lineages, families, and so on,\" animals were \"dream helpers,\" or personal spirit allies for individuals, and lastly, the animals were representations of \"sacred deity-like figures\".<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/>\n\n===Indian People Organizing for Change===\nIndian People Organizing for Change (IPOC) is a community-based organization in the San Francisco Bay Area. Its members, including Ohlone tribal members and conservation activists, work together in order to accomplish social and environmental justice within the Bay Area American Indian community. Current projects include the preservation of Bay Area shellmounds, which are the sacred burial sites of the Ohlone Nation, whose homeland is the San Francisco Bay Area. Currently, IPOC has spread awareness throughout the community through shellmounds walks and has advocated for the preservation of sacred burial sites in the Emeryville Mall, Glen Cove Site, Hunters Point in San Francisco, just to name a few.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gould|first=Corrina|title=\"Indian People Organizing for Change.\" Indian People Organizing for Change.|url=http://ipocshellmoundwalk.homestead.com/}}</ref>\n\n==== Sogorea Te Land Trust ====\n{{Main|Sogorea Te Land Trust}}\nThe Sogorea Te Land Trust is a [[land trust]] founded by members of IPOC in 2012 with the goals of returning traditionally [[Chochenyo]] and [[Karkin]] lands in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] to [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] stewardship and cultivating more active, reciprocal relationships with the land.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Indigenous-women-lead-effort-to-reclaim-ancestral-12384730.php|title=Indigenous women lead effort to reclaim ancestral lands|last=Kost|first=Ryan|date=28 November 2017|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=30 October 2018}}</ref> It has also started a project called the Shuumi Land Tax, which asks that non-indigenous people living on Ohlone land to pay dues for the land that they live on.<ref name=\":0\" /> The tax has no legal ramifications and no connection with the United States government or [[Internal Revenue Service]], but the organization prefers this term (as opposed to merely calling contributions [[Donation|donations]]) as it asserts indigenous [[sovereignty]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.kalw.org/post/native-americans-ask-east-bay-residents-pay-tax-land#stream/0|title=Native Americans ask East Bay residents to pay 'tax' on land|last=Dalmas|first=Jeremy|date=16 April 2018|website=KALW Local Public Radio 91.7 San Francisco|access-date=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nCostanoan is an externally applied name ([[exonym]]). The Spanish explorers and settlers referred to the native groups of this region collectively as the ''Coste\u00f1os'' (the \"coastal people\") circa 1769. Over time, the English-speaking settlers arriving later [[Anglicized]] the word ''Coste\u00f1os'' into the name of ''Costanoans.'' (The suffix \"-an\" is English). For many years, the people were called the Costanoans in English language and records.<ref name=\"Teix-pg4\">Teixeira, 1997:4, \"The Term 'Costanoan/Ohlone'\".</ref>\n\nSince the 1960s, the name of Ohlone has been used by some of the members and the popular media to replace the name ''Costanoan.'' ''Ohlone'' might have originally derived from a Spanish rancho called ''Oljon'', and referred to a single band who inhabited the Pacific Coast near [[Pescadero, California|Pescadero]] Creek. The name ''Ohlone'' was traced by Teixeira through the mission records of Mission San Francisco, Bancroft's ''Native Races'', and Frederick Beechey's Journal regarding a visit to the Bay Area in 1826\u201327. ''Oljone'', ''Olchones'' and ''Alchones'' are spelling variations of ''Ohlone'' found in Mission San Francisco records. However, because of its tribal origin, Ohlone is not universally accepted by the native people, and some members prefer to either to continue to use the name Costanoan or to revitalize and be known as the ''Muwekma''. Teixeira maintains Ohlone is the common usage since 1960, which has been traced back to the Rancho Oljon on the Pescadero Creek. Teixeira states in part: \"A tribe that once existed along the San Mateo County coast.\" Milliken states the name came from: \"A tribe on the lower drainages of San Gregorio Creek and Pescadero Creek on the Pacific Coast\".<!--CITATIONS:--><ref>Opinions and quotations, Teixeira 1997:4; Milliken, 1995:249.</ref>\n\n==Divisions==\n{{See also|List of Ohlone villages}}\nLinguists identified eight regional, linguistic divisions or subgroups of the Ohlone, listed below from north to south:<ref>Levy, 1978:485\u2013486; Teixeira, 1997:37\u201338, \"Linguistics\"; and Milliken, 1995:24\u201326, \"Linguistic Landscape\".

Note the number of 26,000 includes Salinans</ref> Historians differ widely in their estimates, as they do with the entire [[population of Native California]]. However, modern researchers{{who|date=April 2014}} believe that American anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]]'s projection of 7,000&nbsp;Ohlone \"Costanoans\" was much too low. Later researchers such as [[Richard L. Levy|Richard Levy]] estimated \"10,000 or more\" Ohlone.<ref name=\"Levy, 1978:486\"/>\n\nThe highest estimate comes from [[Sherburne F. Cook]], who in later life concluded there were 26,000 Ohlone and Salinans in the \"Northern Mission Area\". Per Cook, the \"Northern Mission Area\" means \"the region inhabited by the Costanoans and Salinans between San Francisco Bay and the headwaters of the Salinas River. To this may be added for convenience the local area under the jurisdiction of the San Luis Obispo even though there is an infringement of the Chumash.\" In this model, the Ohlone people's territory was one half of the \"Northern Mission Area\". It was however known to be more densely populated than the southern Salinan territory, per Cook: \"The Costanoan density was nearly 1.8 persons per square mile with the maximum in the Bay region. The Esselen was approximately 1.3, the Salinan must have been still lower.\" We can estimate that Cook meant about 18,200 Ohlone based on his own statements (70% of \"Northern Mission Area\"), plus or minus a few thousand margin for error, but he does not give an exact number.<ref>For definition of 'Northern Mission area\", Cook, 1976b:20. For density of populations, Cook, 1976a:187.</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone population after contact in 1769 with the Spaniards spiralled downwards. Cook describes rapidly declining indigenous populations in California between 1769 and 1900, in his posthumously published book, ''The Population of the California Indians, 1769\u20131970.'' Cook states in part: \"Not until the population figures are examined does the extent of the havoc become evident.\"  The population had dropped to about 10% of its original numbers by 1848.<ref>For quotation, see Cook, 1976b:200. For population in 1848, see Cook, 1976a:105.</ref>\n\nThe population stabilized after 1900, and as of 2005 there were at least 1,400 on tribal membership rolls.<ref>For tribal membership rolls, Muwekma Ohlone Tribe homepage, 397 members; Amah-Mutsun Band homepage, over 500 members; and Ohlone/Costanoan\u2014Esselen Nation homepage, approximately 500 members.</ref>\n\n==Language==\n{{details|Ohlone languages}}\nThe Ohlone language family is commonly called \"Costanoan\", sometimes \"Ohlone\". Ohlone is classified with Miwok under the label [[Utian languages|Utian]]. The controversial [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] language phylum groups the Utian languages with other languages spoken in California, Oregon, and Washington. The most recent work suggests that Ohlone, Miwok, and Yokuts may all be sub-families within a single [[Yok-Utian languages|Yok-Utian]] language family.<ref>Utian and Penutian classification: Levy, 1978:485\u2013486 (citing Kroeber), Callaghan 1997, Golla 2007. Yok-Utian as a taxonomic category: Callaghan 1997, 2001; Golla 2007:76.</ref>\n\nEight dialects or languages of Ohlone have been recorded: [[Awaswas language|Awaswas]], [[Chalon language|Chalon]], [[Chochenyo language|Chochenyo]] (aka Choche\u00f1o), [[Karkin language|Karkin]], [[Mutsun language|Mutsun]], [[Ramaytush language|Ramaytush]], [[Rumsen language|Rumsen]], and [[Tamyen language|Tamyen]].\n\n==Salvaging records==\nThe [[chroniclers]], [[ethnohistorian]]s, and [[ethnolinguist|linguist]]s of the Ohlone population began with: [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] who researched the California natives and authored a few publications on the Ohlone from 1904 to 1910, and [[Clinton Hart Merriam|C. Hart Merriam]] who researched the Ohlone in detail from 1902 to 1929. This was followed by [[John Peabody Harrington|John P. Harrington]] who researched the Ohlone languages from 1921 to 1939, and other aspects of Ohlone culture, leaving volumes of field notes at his death. Other research was added by Robert Cartier, Madison S. Beeler, and [[Sherburne F. Cook]], to name a few. In many cases, the Ohlone names they used vary in spelling, translation and tribal boundaries, depending on the source. Each tried to [[chronicle]] and interpret this complex society and language(s) before the pieces vanished.<ref>Historians and research years, Teixeira, 1997, biographical articles; notably page 34: \"John Peabody Harrington\". Variances in data and interpretation can be noted in main published references Kroeber, Merriam, Harrington, Cook.</ref>\n\nThere was noticeable competition and some disagreement between the first scholars: Both Merriam and Harrington produced much in-depth Ohlone research in the shadow of the highly published Kroeber and competed in print with him. In the ''Editor's Introduction'' to ''Merriam (1979)'', Robert F. Heizer (as the protege of Kroeber and also the curator of Merriam's work) states \"both men disliked A. L. Kroeber.\"  Harrington, independently working for the Smithsonian Institution cornered most of the Ohlone research as his own specialty, was \"not willing to share his findings with Kroeber&nbsp;... Kroeber and his students neglected the Chumash and Costanoans, but this was done because Harrington made it quite clear that he would resent Kroeber's 'muscling in.{{'\"}}<ref>Quotation \"both men disliked Kroeber\" said by Heizer, in \"Editor's Intro\" of Merriam (1979). Quotes Harrington's \"cornering research\" and \"Harrington&nbsp;... would resent Kroeber's 'muscling in'\" said by Heizer 1975, in Bean:xxiii\u2013xxiv.</ref>\n\nRecent Ohlone historians that have published new research are Lauren Teixeira, Randall Milliken and Lowell J.

She had two brothers named [[Bhai Mohan]] ji and [[Bhai Mohri]] ji and an older sister named [[Bibi Dani]] ji, who was married to a pious Sikh named [[Bhai Rama]]. She was married on 18 February 1554 to Bhai Jetha (whose name was later changed to Guru Ram Das), a Sodhi Khatri from [[Lahore]]. [Bhai Jetha] was a most devoted Sikh of Guru Amar Das. He was a dedicated Sikh and enjoyed serving the Guru and his [[Sangat (term)|Sangat]]. Bhai Jetha later moved to [[Goindval]] which was an upcoming Sikh town and carried out voluntary service ([[Selfless service|Sewa]]) in the construction of the [[Baoli Sahib]] (sacred well).\n\nGuru Amar Das was very impressed with the Sewa performed by Bhai Jetha and so a marriage was arranged between Bibi Bhani, his daughter and a dedicated devotee, Bhai Jehta. After marriage, the couple remained in Goindval serving the Guru and the congregation ([[Sangat (term)|Sangat]]). Later, on the near completion of construction of the [[Gurdwara]] at Goindval, Bhai Jetha was deputed by the Guru to go and establish a habitation at present-day Amritsar. This place was also later caller Ramdasar.

Suddenly the foot of the stool started breaking down when Bibi bhani ji saw this, she went there and kept her hand under the stool so that his father couldn't get hurted .  When guru Amardas ji\n\nfinished bathing, he saw his hand which was hurted .\n\nGuru ji was very impressed by her and asked her to have a boon from him. At that time, Bibi bhani ji didn't knew what to say. So she said in Punjabi that \" guru parampara Sade vanish vich hi chaldi rahe .\"  Which meant that all the guru's should be from her family .  She didn't knew that what was going to happen in the Coming years. And the boon became true . The husband of Bibi bhani, guru Ram Das ji became the fourth guru and his son, guru Arjan Dev ji became the fifth guru and this boon continued .\n\nni\n\nThree sons, Prith Chand (1558), Mahadev (1560) and (Guru) Arjan Dev (1563) were born to her.

The latter term is not to be confused with [[Idealism|metaphysical idealism]], a viewpoint about existence and [[rationality]] unrelated to the ethical concept.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe term \"ideal\" is applied not only to individuals but also to organizations large and small from [[church (congregation)|independent churches]] to [[Activism|social activist groups]] to [[Political party|political parties]] to [[nation state]]s and more. An entity's ideals usually function as a way to set firm guidelines for [[decision making]], with the possibility of having to sacrifice and undergo loss being in the background. While ideals constitute [[fuzzy concept]]s without that clear-cut a definition, they remain an influential part not just of personal choice but of larger, civilization-wide social direction. Ideals as a topic receive both scholarly and layman discussion within a variety of fields including [[philosophy]] both historically and more recently.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broader context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' are inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai>{{citebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeTEDwAAQBAJ|first=Kai|last=Cabrera|publisher=[[Scientific e-Resources]]|date=2018|title=Ethics for Governance|ISBN=9781839473906|pages=1-3}}</ref> Whether [[Ethics in religion|based in religious traditions]] or [[Secular ethics|fundamentally secular]], an entity's relative prioritization of ideals often serves to indicate the extent of that entity's moral dedication. For example, someone who espouses the ideal of [[honesty]] yet expresses the willingness to [[lie]] to protect a friend demonstrates not only devotion to the different ideal of [[friendship]] but also belief in that other ideal to supersede honesty in importance. A particular case of this, frequently known as 'the inquiring murderer', is well-known as an intellectual criticism of [[Kantianism]] and its [[categorical imperative]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nBroader philosophical schools with a strong emphasis on idealistic viewpoints include [[Christian ethics]], [[Jewish ethics]], and [[Platonist ethics]].<ref name=rorty/> The development of state-based and international ideals in terms of large-scale social policy has additionally been long studied by scholars, their analysis looking particularly at the [[Foresight (psychology)|psychological foresight]] and determination required to manage effective foreign policy. [[Democratic peace theory]] in [[international relations]] study is an example.{{fact|date=April 2020}} [[Idealism in international relations|Idealism in the context of foreign relations]] generally involves advocating for institutions that enact measures such as [[international law]] implementation in order to avoid [[warfare]].<ref name=global/>\n\nA variety of different issues in analyzing idealistic ethics exist. Specifically, scholars such as [[Terry Eagleton]] have opined that the practical plausibility of particular ideals winds up being inverse to their intellectual legitimacy. Thus, an idealist with values at odds with his or her actual behavior stands apart, in Eagleton's view, from one who sets forth his or her ethics based fundamentally on his or her pragmatic desires, the latter person's set of principles losing the philosophically appealing nature of the former person's views.<ref name=terry/> As well, thinkers such as [[Richard Rorty]] have criticized the very concept of unchanging ideals existing somewhat separately from [[human nature]] in the first place.<ref name=rorty/> In the [[Politics|political context]], scholars such as [[Gerald Gaus]] have argued that particular strains of idealism cause individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy, ideals getting in the way of incremental yet meaningful progress.<ref name=will/>\n\nHistorically, advocates for idealism in the context of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" include [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[John Locke]]. Their emphasis on rational thinking led them to develop theories of ideal [[morality]] based around [[reason]]. Works authored by the former on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', and ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the later commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> To Kant, no clear-cut divide exists between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with ethical analysis.<ref name=frederick>{{citejournal|title=Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|accessdate=April 7, 2020|authorlink=Frederick Rauscher|first=Frederick|last=Rauscher|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/anthropology-from-a-pragmatic-point-of-view/}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of demonstrated life experience and the proliferation of personal stories via [[mass media]], multiple idealistic individuals have received attention as [[moral example]]s for others to draw understanding from. For instance, [[United States]] leaders known for their idealism include [[President of the United States|presidents]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]],<ref name=hull/><ref name=lecture/> [[Ronald Reagan]],<ref name=diggins/><ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Barack Obama]],<ref name=outdated/><ref name=sarson/><ref name=union/> while [[Europe|European]] officials similarly known for such ethical attitudes include [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Prime Minister of France]] and senior general,<ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Prime Minister of Germany]].<ref name=craig/><ref name=global/><ref name=hans/> [[Juan Manuel Santos]] of [[Colombia]] has gained attention in terms of the [[Central America|central]] and [[South America|south Americas]].<ref name=jesse/><ref name=laboratory/> Private individuals known for their prominent ideals include [[Fred Rogers]], U.S. [[television personality]],<ref name=rogers/> and [[Terry Fox]], Canadian [[athlete]] and [[Charitable organization|charity]] advocate.<ref name=derringer/><ref name=hero/><ref name=mile/> Multiple idealistically optimistic characters have been featured in prominent creative media, the [[Star Trek|''Star Trek'' franchise]] centered around [[space exploration]] being a well-known instance of fictional idealism.<ref name=peter/><ref name=sopan/> In addition, Artists known for creating songs with an atmosphere of idealism include [[singer-songwriters]] [[David Bowie]],<ref name=bowie/> [[Curtis Mayfield]],<ref name=roots/> and [[Tom Paxton]],<ref name=weissman/> with [[Musical group|bands]] [[The Beatles]],<ref name=beatles/> [[Queen (band)|Queen]],<ref name=queen/> and [[Maze (band)|Maze]] being examples as well.<ref name=maze/>\n\n==Background and history==\n===Applications of different terminology===\nThe term \"idealism\" and the related labeling, whether self-applied or otherwise, of individuals and/or groups as being \"idealistic\" or against such viewpoints has a certain complexity to it. In the sense of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical thought]], \"[[idealism]]\" is generally described as centering around a particular view of objective reality versus the perception of reality; the question of whether or not potential [[knowledge]] exists independently to humanity or whether such knowledge is solely tied to experiences in the mind gets debated. Even within that particular intellectual sphere, the stamp of \"idealist\" as applied to particular [[Philosophy|philosophers]], with them often possessing rather nuanced views, attracts considerable controversy.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn [[Colloquialism|colloquial language]], the term \"ideal\" is often applied loosely, with varying circumstances getting described as such in highly different contexts. For instance, in [[cooking]] the descriptions of certain ingredient portions, heating temperatures, preparation times, and the like are often labeled as \"ideal\" or otherwise. Such uses of the term are also highly distinct from the historical and social concept of having an \"ethical ideal\" as such.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Definitions and justifications===\n[[File:Plato_Pio-Clementino_Inv305_n2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] argued that ideals exist in a kind of independence from humanity such that [[reason]] discovers the principles rather than simply creates them.<ref name=nicholas/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Untied States|American]] philosopher [[Ralph Barton Perry]] has defined idealistic [[morality]] as being the result of a particular viewpoint about knowledge itself, writing in his book ''The Moral Economy'',\n{{Quote|\"Moral idealism means to interpret life consistently with ethical, scientific, and metaphysical truth. It endeavors to justify the maximum of hope, without compromising or confusing any enlightenment judgement of truth. In this it is, I think, not only consistent with the spirit of a liberal and rational age but also with the primary motive of religion. There can be no religion... without an open and candid mind as well as an indomitable purpose.\"<ref name=perry/>}}\n\nSomewhat in contrast, American scholar [[Nicholas Rescher]] has stated that the metaphysical nature of ideals gives them a particular status as \"useful fictions\" in terms of their special existence, writing in his book ''Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry Into the Nature and Function of Ideals'',\n{{quote|\"The 'reality' of an ideal lies not in its substantive realization in some separate domain but in its formative impetus upon human thought and action in this imperfect world. The object at issue with an ideal does not, and cannot, ''exist'' as such. What does, however, exist is the idea of such an object. Existing, as it must, in thought alone (in the manner appropriate to ideas), it exerts a powerful[ly] organizing and motivating force on our thinking, providing at once a standard of appraisal and [also] a stimulus to action.\"<ref name=nicholas/>}}\n\nNonetheless, multiple thinkers have asserted that ideals as such constitute things that ought to be said to exist in the real world, having a substance partly to the same extent as flesh and blood people and similar concrete entities. A prominent example of this certain viewpoint is the iconic Greek philosopher [[Plato]]. To him, ideals represent self-contained objects existing in their own domain that humanity discovered through [[reason]] rather than invented out of whole cloth for narrow benefit. Thus, while existing in relation to the human mind, ideals still possess a certain kind of metaphysical independence according to Plato.<ref name=nicholas/>\n\n===Historical development and recent analysis===\n[[Image:Gerome - Diogenes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient cynicism|Ancient cynics]] such as [[Diogenes]] dismissed [[Optimism|optimistic]] views of [[human nature]] as baseless given common brutality, with the moral ideals of the time receiving skepticism as he sought his own internal compass.<ref name=cynic/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the wider context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' have been inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai/> Thus, ideals have been the topic of discussion and debate since the beginnings of organized human [[civilization]]. The types of ideals dealt with during the [[history of philosophy]] have varied widely over the many centuries, many conceptions existing of what moral idealism actually is and how it gets applied in actual life experiences.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFrom [[Ancient history|the far distant history]] to today, multiple philosophers have remarked that human beings appear to, by instinct, behave in a matter with few if any ideals and even general morals of whatever kind. The works of [[United Kingdom|British]] thinker [[David Hume]], for instance, explicitly declared people to be inherent \"[[Slavery|slaves]]\" to their passions.<ref name=kant/> When articulating a particularly nuanced theory of morality, Hume's writings labeled it folly to emphasize what people hopefully wish to achieve and additionally argued that enforcing ideals without proper grounding in practical, already existing mores undermines society itself.<ref>{{citenews|journal=[[The Nation (journal)|The Nation]]|accessdate=April 7, 2020|title=Hume's Call to Action|authorlink=Richard Bourke (academic)|date=April 20, 2016|first=Richard|last=Bourke|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/humes-call-to-action/}}</ref>\n\n[[Ancient cynicism|Cynics of the ancient world]] frequently referred to humanity in general as not only not perfectible but fundamentally depraved. The historical [[Greece|Greek]] figure of [[Diogenes]], while arguing that some individuals could through great effort achieve some kind of a moral dignity, was a prominent example in his dismissal of the values common in his day. He sought his own path based on a particular set of ideals that involved begging on the streets, living in a barrel, and wearing rags.<ref name=cynic>{{citeweb|url=https://academyofideas.com/2013/05/diogenes-the-cynic/|title=Diogenes the Cynic|accessdate=April 6, 2020|date=May 26, 2013|website=[[AcademyofIdeas.com]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sermon-on-the-mount-tiffany.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sermon on the Mount]] constituted an important moment in the development of [[Christian ethics]], Jesus setting forth ideals that later spread throughout the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=duiker/>]]\n\nIn both [[Jewish ethics]] and later [[Christian ethics]], however, advocacy for a stridently idealistic view of the world, in which principles get held over personal convenience and even otherwise perfectly logical expectations, has attracted praise. [[Golden rule]] based moral standards have involved restrictions such as holding back the quest for [[Vengeance (concept)|vengeance]] by the wronged such that punishment only gets applied in a limited, specific fashion, this example being later evaluated as the [[tit-for-tat]] strategy in [[game theory]]. In terms of [[Christianity]], the teachings of the [[Gospels]] have constituted an extension of the golden rule; individuals, under [[Jesus Christ|Jesus']] example, have gotten called to hold to the ideal of treating other people even better than they rationally expect to be treated back.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the context of the various religious movements of the 1st and 2nd century in the [[Roman Empire]], the ideals of Christian thinking constituted a radical break with the ethical doctrines that had been advocated by those in power. Rejecting views of the upper classes, both during the empire's time and previously in Greco-Roman civilization, the rising Christian community set forth clear-cut principles based on narratives such as the [[Sermon on the Mount]], which was included in the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. Specifically, Jesus' exhortations for his followers to \"[[turn the other cheek]]\" as well to \"love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you\" and practice other idealistic behaviors established a general view emphasizing spiritual standards over material concerns.<ref name=duiker>{{citebook|title=World History, Volume I|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|date=2008|first1=William J.|last1=Duiker|first2=Jackson J.|last2=Spielvogel|pages=148-151|ISBN=9780495569022|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arxyJC05vScC}}</ref>\n\nDespite the degree that Christian viewpoints contradicted Roman traditions, [[early Christianity]] spread throughout the Empire and became a particularly robust force in the empire's society by the 4th century. Reasons for the appeal included not only the idealistic messages but also the similarity between the belief system and previously popular [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cults]]. Finally, emperor [[Theodosius the Great]] made Christianity the official religion of the entire realm.<Ref name=duiker/>\n\nWhile [[Western world|Western nations]] widely retained the influences of Jewish and Christian morality over multiple centuries, in practical terms a great many powerful rulers and prominent thinkers both before and after the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] pushed back on higher notions of idealistic ethics. Many did so based on little other than expediency. However, whether explicitly in words or implicitly through deeds, more cynical figures have counter-argued from points of view that can broadly be labeled as \"[[moral relativism]]\". As the arguments have gone, human beings have been little more than crude matter and cannot reasonably be held to act based in any sort of larger principle; survival has remained people's core instinct such that civilization, through relativist eyes, functions as a thin veneer over base instincts.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMultiple philosophers have argued in favor of particular types of idealism as well for years. The course of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" from the 17th to the 19th centuries, being a movement that in large part centered around the application of rationality-based principles such as the [[scientific method]] upon [[human nature]], caused increased interest in ethical philosophy as a field of study. Notions of \"benevolence\" attracted widespread attention in terms of [[Government|governance]], with leaders exhorted to act based on idealistic principles and to particularly champion causes such as the facilitating of [[the arts]], increased [[Education|educational efforts]], effective stewardship of [[national resources]], and so on. This movement increased trends away from [[absolute monarchy]] and [[dictatorship]] towards that of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Republic|republican government]]. The scientifically based, forward thinking viewpoint about human nature when applied to socio-political organization became later known as \"[[classical liberalism]]\".{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|right|Philosopher [[John Locke]], a prominent figure of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]], articulated a vision of the individual and collective pursuit of ideals arising from the logical study and analysis of the state of nature.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\nIn terms of broader discussions on ethics, many classical Enlightenment thinkers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]] have famously argued that strong moral standards on individual choice exist based upon standards of [[rationality]] that can be found through [[Logic|logical analysis]] by reasonable observers. Specifically, instrumental principles based on satisfying one\u2019s desires made up the basis for morality through Hobbes' approach. External principles existing in the discoverable state of nature outside of human experience that became possible to tease out due to personal study constituted Locke's theoretical background for ideals and broader ethics.<ref name=kant>{{citeweb|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/|title=Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy|accessdate=April 8, 2020|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=July 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith respect to social order, Locke's highly influential writings applied rational principles to governance in support of the doctrine of [[social contract theory]], which permeated Enlightenment discussions about the best form of organizing a country. Locke's works such as the ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' set forth an ethical framework in which rational individuals establish a government in order to guarantee their fundamental rights and possess the understanding that they not only can but should alter said government when rational application of the fair-minded \"[[rule of law]]\" has broken down, change taking place when [[liberty]] no longer receives protection. Locke criticized competing theories such as the [[divine right of kings]], which the thinker viewed as folly.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn terms of individual thinking on principles, Lockean morality has emphasized holding to prominent ideals about human behavior, a particular one being the power of education. Locke wrote of its importance in depth within the pages of ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]''. Outlining the best way to rear children in his eyes, Lockean arguments stressed that virtuous actions by adults arose as a direct result of the habits of body and mind taught during youth by forward thinking instructors.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nLocke wrote in his work ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' dividing rational understanding into three inherent areas of scope, the philosopher defining the second as \"practica\" and describing it as,\n{{quote|\"The skill of right applying our own powers and actions, for the attainment of things good and useful. The most considerable... is ethics, which is the seeking out those rules and measures of human actions, which lead to happiness, and the means to practise them. The end of this is not bare speculation and the knowledge of truth; but right, and a conduct suitable to it.\"<ref>John Locke. ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''. Chapter XXI. ''Of the Division of the Sciences''.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Immanuel_Kant_3.jpg|thumb|right|Thinker [[Immanuel Kant]]'s views on idealistic morality aligned the human ethical experience with that of rationality and the greater world,<ref name=frederick/> the philosopher seeing the defiance of ideals such as his \"[[categorical imperative]]\" concept as not only being wrong on principle but also illogical.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\n[[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s particular view of [[human nature]] and intellectual inquiry, later summed up under the banner of \"[[Kantianism]]\", stressed the inherent power of logical thinking in terms of moral analysis. Kant's advocacy for the \"[[categorical imperative]]\", a doctrine through which every individual choice has to be made with the consideration of the decider that it ought to be a universally held maxim, took place in the broader context of his metaphysical views. In Kant's writings, defiance of higher idealistic principles was not only wrong in a practical sense but in a fundamentally rational and thus moral sense as well.<ref name=kant/>\n\nWorks authored by Kant on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the latter commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> Within the pages of ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' in particular, the philosopher articulated a vision of people as by their very essence driven by meaningful ethics. Through the lens of Kant's doctrine, no ironclad divide has existed between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with studies of people's ideals.<ref name=frederick/>\n\nSumming up Kant's views on ideals in context, scholar Frederick P. Van De Pitte has written,\n{{quote|\"Kant realized that man's rational capacity alone is not sufficient to constitute his dignity and elevate him above the brutes. If reason only enables him to do for himself what instinct does for the animal, then it would indicate for man no higher aim or destiny than that of the brute but only a different way of attaining the same end. However, reason is man's most essential attribute because it is the means by which a truly distinctive dimension is made possible for him. Reason, that is, reflective awareness, makes it possible to distinguish between good and bad, and thus morality can be made the ruling purpose of life. Because man can consider an array of possibilities, and which among them is the most desirable, he can strive to make himself and his world into a realization of his ideals.\"<ref name=anthropology/>}}\n\nModern Western philosophy in terms of its discussion of ideals largely takes place within the framework of Enlightenment thinking, with figures such as the aforementioned Hobbes, Kant, and Locke dominating debate. As per the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]], itself an evolution from the earlier [[American Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Constitution of the United States]], many theorizing academics of the 19th century and the 20th century have set forth an [[Optimism|optimistic]] view of humanity. Through this moralistic lens, all individuals by nature of their mere existence have been thought to have been born inherently [[Good and evil|good]], inherently [[Social equality|equal]], and inherently [[Freedom|free]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nA defining inflection point of this trend has been the experience of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]]. The historical memory has been argued to have created a sort of dualistic approach to [[ideology]] in which [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] [[democracy]], centered around classical liberalism, gets inherently pitted forever in struggle with [[Tyranny|tyrannies]], centered around the [[Social stratification|stratification of various groups over others]] and mass misery. In the aftermath of the end of the [[Cold War]], studies upon moral idealism have often asked if Enlightenment viewpoints face an inherent intellectual challenge that the doctrines cannot eventually overcome.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the advent of the 21st century, philosophizers have debated the rapid evolution of different cultures, particularly given advancing technology, and the seeming acceptance of [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian values]] previously thought of as radical or undesirable by [[Center-left politics|center-left]], [[Political moderation|moderate]], and [[Center-right politics|center-right]] individuals. The conflict between these people, many of them belonging to younger generations such as the [[Millennials]], and those [[Political extremism|political extremists]] of the [[Far-right politics|global far-right movement]], the social trend often called \"[[Neo-nationalism|new nationalism]]\", has defined new distinctions between what it means to be a \"moral idealist\". As well, the question of the fundamental [[Biology|biological]] advancement of humanity itself has attracted much attention. What a [[transhuman]] or even [[posthuman]] individual would possess terms of ideals in contrast with regular human beings has remained an open question.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broadest sense, the question of whether or not humanity as a whole has fundamentally progressed towards a set of moral ideals over time has never achieved any particular consensus. Examples of philosophers who argue partially in support of the notion include the American thinker [[Richard Rorty]], a figure who has criticized the very concept of unchanging ethical principles set forth in inherent nature while still lauding general social progress.<ref name=rorty/> In contrast, multiple scholars concerned with issues such as [[global climate change]] and potential use of [[weapons of mass destruction]] in future [[warfare]] have lamented particular [[Technology|technological advancements]] and related alterations in broader social culture, the thinkers arguing that fundamental moral progress has truly not occurred given forms of increasing danger to humanity.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nOne optimistic view arising in the 20th century and continuing to receive notice is that of prominent [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] figure [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. He famously predicted that humanity will eventually advance in terms of not just scientific development through natural and engineered [[biological evolution]] but also idealistic morality to a sort of final oneness regarded by him as the '[[Omega Point]]', a mode of existence taking place not only without hatred, pain, and misery but with perfect collective action and consciousness. Known as the \"Catholic Darwin\", his view of evolutionary advancement came out of a religious context through which he identified humanity's final state with Jesus Christ as the \"[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]\" or sacred \"Word\".

In some theories of applied ethics, relative importance has gotten assigned to certain social preferences over others as a way to [[Dispute resolution|resolve disputes effectively]]. In analysis of [[legal theory]], for instance, [[judge]]s have been sometimes called on to resolve the balance between the ideal of [[truth]], which would likely advise hearing out all evidence, and the ideal of broader [[social equality]], which would likely advise seeking to restore goodwill between individuals regardless of specific findings during a particular case.

Specifically, certain authors known as \"[[New atheism|new atheists]]\" such as [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]] have argued that newly emerging forms of [[secular ethics]] constitute an approach of people treating each other that is more logical, just, and reasonable when seen as a rejoinder to previous forms of \"traditional values\". At the same time, multiple thinkers have advocated for moral relativism and a reduced or non-existent sense of holding to previously well-promoted ideals as a direct result of their wholesale rejection of religion. As well, scholars regardless of personal faith background have commented about the complex nature of ethics when taken from spiritual movements.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Idealistic appeals in practice==\n===In conceptual and historical politics===\n\n[[File:Pericles.jpg|thumb|right|Greek statesman [[Pericles]]' vision of [[Athenian democracy]] stressed a sense of what he saw as core ideals, particularly the intelligence and tolerance displayed by Athenians.<ref name=pericles/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdeals have played a role in [[politics]] for [[millennia]]. For example, iconic Greek statesman [[Pericles]] famously presented an ideal-based view of the [[Mediterranean]] world. In 431, shortly after the [[Peloponnesian War]] had started, Pericles' \"Funeral Oration\" made to commemorate fallen soldiers, described for posterity by the historian [[Thucydides]], presented a view of [[Athens]] and the city-state's broader civilization that emphasized a sense of cleverness and open-mindedness that Pericles believed gave it the strength to rise to different challenges.<ref name=pericles>{{citenews|journal=[[Pbs.org]]|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/background/36.html|title=Pericles Funeral Oration in Depth|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref> Other early historical figures known for appealing to ethical ideals in their [[Public speaking|oratory]] include Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]], the figure's commentary on [[Hellenic Greece|Hellenized]] values leading to his moral appeal among supporters. In contrast to what he saw as [[decadence]] spreading into [[Rome]] and nearby areas from elsewhere, Cato articulated support for what he labeled as traditional Roman ethics.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMost [[Revolution|political revolutions]] have drawn support from the mass appeal of a certain moral idealism in contrast to the doctrines of those holding [[Power (sociology)|power]], having the various grievances with the status quo created from real or perceived misrule spark ethical debate. During the [[French Revolution]], the rhetorical principles of ''\"[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]\"'' (English: ''\"Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood\"'') got raised to the status of clear-cut ideals; the new [[nation state]] constituted a sort of grand experiment in what became in de facto and later de jure a new religion. Many political movements in modern times have centered themselves upon multiple ideals found to be mutually reinforcing. Recent examples have included the [[peace movement]] and the broader opposition expressed worldwide to war in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] as well as elsewhere.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn many cases current and historical, instances have popped up in which proclaimed ideals simply weren't lived up to by various figures while in office, despite claims made by the officials before taking power and since attaining it. In [[British English]], politicians openly changing their opinions in defiance of previous assertions about their ethics have been labeled as making a \"u-turn\". In [[American English]], similar individuals have been pejoratively called \"flip-floppers\". While different, the terms [[U-turn (politics)|have meant the same thing]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdealism in the context of politics has attracted criticism from multiple fronts. For instance, U.S. philosopher [[Gerald Gaus]], the author of ''[[The Tyranny of the Ideal: Justice in a Diverse Society]]'', has prominently argued that an overriding emphasis on ideals causes individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy as well as logical choices during [[Election|elections]]. Gaus has made other warnings such as cautioning that people can lose their sense of how much has already been achieved and how well current situations have become in certain circumstances.

In [[Islam]], for instance, the life of the prophet [[Muhammad]] has been held up as a comprehensive ideal for Muslims to study. However, all of his words and deeds must be interpreted for believers through the lens of his life's broader path and the larger religious context, according to Islamic scholars.

Originally coming from [[Yiddish]], the labeling of idealistic people as such has since become co-opted into regular use within the [[English language]] in certain areas.{{fact|date=April 2020}} Different scholarly traditions within [[Judaism]] have articulated theories of promoting moral behavior as well as more generally seeking to improve both humanity and nature in order to meet higher ideals; the process has been known as \"[[tikkun olam]]\", a term often translated to mean \"repairing the world\". In 2013, the surveying analysis group [[Pew Research Center]] polled [[American Jews]] what specific traits were essential to Jewish identity and found that 56% said \"working for justice/equality\".<ref>{{citenews|accessdate=April 10, 2020|url=https://atlantajewishtimes.timesofisrael.com/tikkun-olam-different-strokes-for-different-folks2/|date=September 12, 2018|title=Tikkun Olam: Different Strokes For Different Folks|first=Dave|last=Schechter|periodical=[[The Atlanta Jewish Times]]}}</ref>\n\nChristian thinking has often encouraged regular people to highlight certain individuals as ethical examples. In both [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and the traditions of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Saint|saints]] have received veneration due to their heroic deeds.

No consensus has emerged in any particular area, though much research has been done in the past several decades. Examples of studied categorizations include [[Ageing|age]], [[ethnicity]], [[gender identity]], [[nationality]], and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]. The general field of [[anthropology]] has studied the evolution of differing societies and come to contradictory conclusions about whether or not certain ideals can be said to be innate to human existence and/or universal in terms of rational advocacy.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nEmpirical research has demonstrated differences between [[Man|men]] and [[Woman|women]] in terms of their relative approaches to idealistic morality. Specifically, a 2018 article published by the ''International Journal of Management Science and Business Administration'' stated that six scholarly studies published in the past had determined that women value ethical principles at a higher level than men in the context of [[business]] and [[economics]]. However, some of those had found only modest differences. As well, four published reports in the past had failed to detect any significant differences between the sexes.<ref name=poor>{{citejournal|title=Comparative Business Ethics \u2013 Idealism and Relativism in Light of Empirical Researches in Eight CEE Countries, Finland, and Turkey|journal=International Journal of Management Science and Business Administration|volume=4|issue=5|date=July 2018|pages=23-33|doi= 10.18775/ijmsba.1849-5664-5419.2014.45.1003|last=Po\u00f3r|first=J\u00f3zsef|last2=Abdulkerim|first2=Yavuzaslan|last3=Ahmet|first3=Bariscil|last4=Koll\u00e1r|first4=P\u00e9ter}}</ref>\n\nThe aforementioned article evaluated distinctions in [[nationality]] and determined that significant differences exist between the various peoples when it comes to idealism in the working environment. In depth, the analysis of eight different European nations, constituting of [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Poland]], appeared to the researchers to have illustrated the effects of contrasting social mores. For example, [[Culture of Croatia|Croatian culture]] faced the problem that \"[t]he significant majority of employees are satisfied with the minimum level of ethical behavior\" while the Finns were labeled as living in a \"traditionally seen... corruption-free or low-corruption and transparent country\".<ref name=poor/>\n\nIn contrast to only finding slight differences in terms of idealism by sex, the study concluded that particular gaps exist between [[Human generation|generations]]; broadly speaking, the older an individual was, the more importance they gave to idealistic ethics.<ref name=poor/>\n\n===Ideals versus absolute or conditional obligations===\n\n[[File:Blood test (1).jpg|thumb|right|Obligated social standards, such as the various [[Social norms|norms]] around the [[Doctor\u2013patient relationship|medical professional and patient relationship]], have been argued by thinkers as existing at a different plane than idealistic moral views.<ref name=norbert/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nPhilosopher [[Norbert Paulo]] has stated that, in common life, ideals as such appear to exist in relation to general social obligations. Many of the latter concepts have tended to appear, according to Paulo, absolute and essentially mandatory while also existing in highly particular circumstances. For instance, Paulo has written, [[Physician|physicians]] and [[Nursing|nurses]] face a variety of [[Doctor\u2013patient relationship|ethical obligations imposed on them when treating their patients]] that regular individuals encountering said patients randomly do not. He had added that a continuum exists between clear-cut, widely held obligations applied via [[Social norm|social norms]] and vague ones only partially behold to cultural sanction.<ref name=norbert/>\n\nPaulo's argument, thus, has concluded that idealist behavior takes place at a behavioral and mental level above and beyond mere social rules, such actions being \"warranted\" yet \"not strictly required\" either while their optional nature sets them up as being \"praiseworthy\". Ideals represent a method of putting into action an individual's [[personal character]] and its given traits such that, Paulo has argued, moral standards get fleshed out beyond the rigid framework of mere obligations. One person's altruistic caring for another generally has constituted a particular example.<ref name=norbert/>\n\n===Ideals versus virtues===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe line between an ideal and a [[virtue]] has been difficult to access. Ideals have been argued to inherently involve aspirations while virtues function as direct guides for assigned conduct given social standards.<ref name=norbert/> Analysis has run into problems given that both entities are [[fuzzy concept]]s. In general, some philosophers have argued that an ideal usually constitutes something more inherent that one can make a [[Habituation|habit]] while virtues, instead, necessarily involve going above and beyond regular decision making in order to actively strive for something. Thus, these thinkers have stated, virtues inherently constitute a behavior that's by its very nature highly difficult to turn into a regular practice. Other philosophers have made the exact opposite argument and seen virtues as fundamentally philosophically weaker entities than ideals.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nGiven the complexity of putting ideals into practice, not to mention resolving conflicts between them, many individuals have chosen to narrowly pick a certain group of them and then harden them into absolute [[dogma]]. Political theorist [[Bernard Crick]] has stated that a way to solve this [[dilemma]] is to have ideals that themselves are descriptive of a generalized process rather than a specific outcome, particularly when the latter is hard to achieve.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nKant wrote in his work ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' pitting idealism against the enactment of personal [[vice]], the philospher arguing,\n{{quote|\"Young man! Deny yourself satisfaction (of amusement, of debauchery, of love, etc.), not with the Stoical intention of complete abstinence, but with the refined Epicurean intention of having in view an ever-growing pleasure. This stinginess with the cash of your vital urge makes you definitely richer through the postponement of pleasure, even if you should, for the most part, renounce the indulgence of it until the end of your life. The awareness of having pleasure under your control is, like everything idealistic, more fruitful and more abundant than everything that satisfies the sense through indulgence because it is thereby simultaneously consumed and consequently lost from the aggregate of totality.\"<ref name=anthropology>{{citebook|title=[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]|authorlink=Immanuel Kant|first=Immanuel|last=Kant|date=1996|translator=Victor Lyle Dowdell|publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]]|ISBN=9780809320608}}</ref>}}\n\n===Relative ideals===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Robert S. Hartman]] has contended that since, colloquially, labeling an entity as ideal means that something is the best member of the set of all things of that class, thus the term has particular implications when used in an ethical context. For example, he has stated, the ideal student constitutes the best member of the set of all students in exactly the same way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles. Since one can define the properties that the ideal member of a class should have, according to Hartman, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is to Hartman. Thus, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is worse than a very smooth one drawn with a compass' aid, but both are better than a regularly made square.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFor Hartman, the world in general has presented a situation in which each particular entity ought usually to become more like its ideal if possible. This entails that, in [[ethics]], each individual should analogously to become more like the hypothetical ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self, in Hartman's view.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Totalizing ideals versus emergent ideals===\n\n[[File:Terry Eagleton in Manchester 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Philosopher [[Terry Eagleton]] has written critically about the practicality of ethical idealism.<ref name=terry/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe question of to what extent one can hold to certain ideals practically and how facing resistance will shape them has attracted debate from multiple thinkers. The related issue of to what extent idealistic morality held by individuals reflects broader cultures has done so as well. The extent to which human beings think through their behavior irrationally or rationally has been a major issue in these such discussions.<ref name=kelly/><ref name=terry/>\n\nOne 21st century philosopher who has delved into the topics is [[Terry Eagleton]]. Writing in his book ''After Theory'', he has commented critically about the practicality of ethical idealism, Eagleton arguing,\n{{quote|\"Moral values which state what you ought to do are impressively idealistic, but too blatantly at odds with your behaviour.

In particular, his book ''As If: Idealization and Ideals'' examined the usefulness of the concepts and the processes through which they've been articulated. Appiah found fault in the general assumptions made by certain thinkers of human rationality and advocated for a larger understanding of the practical nature of the idealization process among scholars of multiple disciplines as well as laypeople.<ref name=kelly/>\n\nIn depth, Appiah's book presented a nuanced picture of ethical idealism in the context of cultural organization, the philosopher writing,\n{{quote|\"The history of our collective moral learning doesn't start with the growing acceptance of a picture of an ideal society.

The latter term is not to be confused with [[Idealism|metaphysical idealism]], a viewpoint about existence and [[rationality]] unrelated to the ethical concept.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe term \"ideal\" is applied not only to individuals but also to organizations large and small from [[church (congregation)|independent churches]] to [[Activism|social activist groups]] to [[Political party|political parties]] to [[nation state]]s and more. An entity's ideals usually function as a way to set firm guidelines for [[decision making]], with the possibility of having to sacrifice and undergo loss being in the background. While ideals constitute [[fuzzy concept]]s without that clear-cut a definition, they remain an influential part not just of personal choice but of larger, civilization-wide social direction. Ideals as a topic receive both scholarly and layman discussion within a variety of fields including [[philosophy]] both historically and more recently.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broader context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' are inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai>{{citebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeTEDwAAQBAJ|first=Kai|last=Cabrera|publisher=[[Scientific e-Resources]]|date=2018|title=Ethics for Governance|ISBN=9781839473906|pages=1-3}}</ref> Whether [[Ethics in religion|based in religious traditions]] or [[Secular ethics|fundamentally secular]], an entity's relative prioritization of ideals often serves to indicate the extent of that entity's moral dedication. For example, someone who espouses the ideal of [[honesty]] yet expresses the willingness to [[lie]] to protect a friend demonstrates not only devotion to the different ideal of [[friendship]] but also belief in that other ideal to supersede honesty in importance. A particular case of this, frequently known as 'the inquiring murderer', is well-known as an intellectual criticism of [[Kantianism]] and its [[categorical imperative]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nBroader philosophical schools with a strong emphasis on idealistic viewpoints include [[Christian ethics]], [[Jewish ethics]], and [[Platonist ethics]].<ref name=rorty/> The development of state-based and international ideals in terms of large-scale social policy has additionally been long studied by scholars, their analysis looking particularly at the [[Foresight (psychology)|psychological foresight]] and determination required to manage effective foreign policy. [[Democratic peace theory]] in [[international relations]] study is an example.{{fact|date=April 2020}} [[Idealism in international relations|Idealism in the context of foreign relations]] generally involves advocating for institutions that enact measures such as [[international law]] implementation in order to avoid [[warfare]].<ref name=global/>\n\nA variety of different issues in analyzing idealistic ethics exist. Specifically, scholars such as [[Terry Eagleton]] have opined that the practical plausibility of particular ideals winds up being inverse to their intellectual legitimacy. Thus, an idealist with values at odds with his or her actual behavior stands apart, in Eagleton's view, from one who sets forth his or her ethics based fundamentally on his or her pragmatic desires, the latter person's set of principles losing the philosophically appealing nature of the former person's views.<ref name=terry/> As well, thinkers such as [[Richard Rorty]] have criticized the very concept of unchanging ideals existing somewhat separately from [[human nature]] in the first place.<ref name=rorty/> In the [[Politics|political context]], scholars such as [[Gerald Gaus]] have argued that particular strains of idealism cause individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy, ideals getting in the way of incremental yet meaningful progress.<ref name=will/>\n\nHistorically, advocates for idealism in the context of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" include [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[John Locke]]. Their emphasis on rational thinking led them to develop theories of ideal [[morality]] based around [[reason]]. Works authored by the former on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', and ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the later commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> To Kant, no clear-cut divide exists between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with ethical analysis.<ref name=frederick>{{citejournal|title=Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|accessdate=April 7, 2020|authorlink=Frederick Rauscher|first=Frederick|last=Rauscher|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/anthropology-from-a-pragmatic-point-of-view/}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of demonstrated life experience and the proliferation of personal stories via [[mass media]], multiple idealistic individuals have received attention as [[moral example]]s for others to draw understanding from. For instance, [[United States]] leaders known for their idealism include [[President of the United States|presidents]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]],<ref name=hull/><ref name=lecture/> [[Ronald Reagan]],<ref name=diggins/><ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Barack Obama]],<ref name=outdated/><ref name=sarson/><ref name=union/> while [[Europe|European]] officials similarly known for such ethical attitudes include [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Prime Minister of France]] and senior general,<ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Prime Minister of Germany]].<ref name=craig/><ref name=global/><ref name=hans/> [[Juan Manuel Santos]] of [[Colombia]] has gained attention in terms of the [[Central America|central]] and [[South America|south Americas]].<ref name=jesse/><ref name=laboratory/> Private individuals known for their prominent ideals include [[Fred Rogers]], U.S. [[television personality]],<ref name=rogers/> and [[Terry Fox]], Canadian [[athlete]] and [[Charitable organization|charity]] advocate.<ref name=derringer/><ref name=hero/><ref name=mile/> Multiple idealistically optimistic characters have been featured in prominent creative media, the [[Star Trek|''Star Trek'' franchise]] centered around [[space exploration]] being a well-known instance of fictional idealism.<ref name=peter/><ref name=sopan/> In addition, Artists known for creating songs with an atmosphere of idealism include [[singer-songwriters]] [[David Bowie]],<ref name=bowie/> [[Curtis Mayfield]],<ref name=roots/> and [[Tom Paxton]],<ref name=weissman/> with [[Musical group|bands]] [[The Beatles]],<ref name=beatles/> [[Queen (band)|Queen]],<ref name=queen/> and [[Maze (band)|Maze]] being examples as well.<ref name=maze/>\n\n==Background and history==\n===Applications of different terminology===\nThe term \"idealism\" and the related labeling, whether self-applied or otherwise, of individuals and/or groups as being \"idealistic\" or against such viewpoints has a certain complexity to it. In the sense of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical thought]], \"[[idealism]]\" is generally described as centering around a particular view of objective reality versus the perception of reality; the question of whether or not potential [[knowledge]] exists independently to humanity or whether such knowledge is solely tied to experiences in the mind gets debated. Even within that particular intellectual sphere, the stamp of \"idealist\" as applied to particular [[Philosophy|philosophers]], with them often possessing rather nuanced views, attracts considerable controversy.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn [[Colloquialism|colloquial language]], the term \"ideal\" is often applied loosely, with varying circumstances getting described as such in highly different contexts. For instance, in [[cooking]] the descriptions of certain ingredient portions, heating temperatures, preparation times, and the like are often labeled as \"ideal\" or otherwise. Such uses of the term are also highly distinct from the historical and social concept of having an \"ethical ideal\" as such.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Definitions and justifications===\n[[File:Plato_Pio-Clementino_Inv305_n2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] argued that ideals exist in a kind of independence from humanity such that [[reason]] discovers the principles rather than simply creates them.<ref name=nicholas/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Untied States|American]] philosopher [[Ralph Barton Perry]] has defined idealistic [[morality]] as being the result of a particular viewpoint about knowledge itself, writing in his book ''The Moral Economy'',\n{{Quote|\"Moral idealism means to interpret life consistently with ethical, scientific, and metaphysical truth. It endeavors to justify the maximum of hope, without compromising or confusing any enlightenment judgement of truth. In this it is, I think, not only consistent with the spirit of a liberal and rational age but also with the primary motive of religion. There can be no religion... without an open and candid mind as well as an indomitable purpose.\"<ref name=perry/>}}\n\nSomewhat in contrast, American scholar [[Nicholas Rescher]] has stated that the metaphysical nature of ideals gives them a particular status as \"useful fictions\" in terms of their special existence, writing in his book ''Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry Into the Nature and Function of Ideals'',\n{{quote|\"The 'reality' of an ideal lies not in its substantive realization in some separate domain but in its formative impetus upon human thought and action in this imperfect world. The object at issue with an ideal does not, and cannot, ''exist'' as such. What does, however, exist is the idea of such an object. Existing, as it must, in thought alone (in the manner appropriate to ideas), it exerts a powerful[ly] organizing and motivating force on our thinking, providing at once a standard of appraisal and [also] a stimulus to action.\"<ref name=nicholas/>}}\n\nNonetheless, multiple thinkers have asserted that ideals as such constitute things that ought to be said to exist in the real world, having a substance partly to the same extent as flesh and blood people and similar concrete entities. A prominent example of this certain viewpoint is the iconic Greek philosopher [[Plato]]. To him, ideals represent self-contained objects existing in their own domain that humanity discovered through [[reason]] rather than invented out of whole cloth for narrow benefit. Thus, while existing in relation to the human mind, ideals still possess a certain kind of metaphysical independence according to Plato.<ref name=nicholas/>\n\n===Historical development and recent analysis===\n[[Image:Gerome - Diogenes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient cynicism|Ancient cynics]] such as [[Diogenes]] dismissed [[Optimism|optimistic]] views of [[human nature]] as baseless given common brutality, with the moral ideals of the time receiving skepticism as he sought his own internal compass.<ref name=cynic/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the wider context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' have been inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai/> Thus, ideals have been the topic of discussion and debate since the beginnings of organized human [[civilization]]. The types of ideals dealt with during the [[history of philosophy]] have varied widely over the many centuries, many conceptions existing of what moral idealism actually is and how it gets applied in actual life experiences.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFrom [[Ancient history|the far distant history]] to today, multiple philosophers have remarked that human beings appear to, by instinct, behave in a matter with few if any ideals and even general morals of whatever kind.

The historical [[Greece|Greek]] figure of [[Diogenes]], while arguing that some individuals could through great effort achieve some kind of a moral dignity, was a prominent example in his dismissal of the values common in his day. He sought his own path based on a particular set of ideals that involved begging on the streets, living in a barrel, and wearing rags.<ref name=cynic>{{citeweb|url=https://academyofideas.com/2013/05/diogenes-the-cynic/|title=Diogenes the Cynic|accessdate=April 6, 2020|date=May 26, 2013|website=[[AcademyofIdeas.com]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sermon-on-the-mount-tiffany.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sermon on the Mount]] constituted an important moment in the development of [[Christian ethics]], Jesus setting forth ideals that later spread throughout the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=duiker/>]]\n\nIn both [[Jewish ethics]] and later [[Christian ethics]], however, advocacy for a stridently idealistic view of the world, in which principles get held over personal convenience and even otherwise perfectly logical expectations, has attracted praise. [[Golden rule]] based moral standards have involved restrictions such as holding back the quest for [[Vengeance (concept)|vengeance]] by the wronged such that punishment only gets applied in a limited, specific fashion, this example being later evaluated as the [[tit-for-tat]] strategy in [[game theory]]. In terms of [[Christianity]], the teachings of the [[Gospels]] have constituted an extension of the golden rule; individuals, under [[Jesus Christ|Jesus']] example, have gotten called to hold to the ideal of treating other people even better than they rationally expect to be treated back.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the context of the various religious movements of the 1st and 2nd century in the [[Roman Empire]], the ideals of Christian thinking constituted a radical break with the ethical doctrines that had been advocated by those in power. Rejecting views of the upper classes, both during the empire's time and previously in Greco-Roman civilization, the rising Christian community set forth clear-cut principles based on narratives such as the [[Sermon on the Mount]], which was included in the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. Specifically, Jesus' exhortations for his followers to \"[[turn the other cheek]]\" as well to \"love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you\" and practice other idealistic behaviors established a general view emphasizing spiritual standards over material concerns.<ref name=duiker>{{citebook|title=World History, Volume I|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|date=2008|first1=William J.|last1=Duiker|first2=Jackson J.|last2=Spielvogel|pages=148-151|ISBN=9780495569022|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arxyJC05vScC}}</ref>\n\nDespite the degree that Christian viewpoints contradicted Roman traditions, [[early Christianity]] spread throughout the Empire and became a particularly robust force in the empire's society by the 4th century. Reasons for the appeal included not only the idealistic messages but also the similarity between the belief system and previously popular [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cults]]. Finally, emperor [[Theodosius the Great]] made Christianity the official religion of the entire realm.<Ref name=duiker/>\n\nWhile [[Western world|Western nations]] widely retained the influences of Jewish and Christian morality over multiple centuries, in practical terms a great many powerful rulers and prominent thinkers both before and after the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] pushed back on higher notions of idealistic ethics. Many did so based on little other than expediency. However, whether explicitly in words or implicitly through deeds, more cynical figures have counter-argued from points of view that can broadly be labeled as \"[[moral relativism]]\". As the arguments have gone, human beings have been little more than crude matter and cannot reasonably be held to act based in any sort of larger principle; survival has remained people's core instinct such that civilization, through relativist eyes, functions as a thin veneer over base instincts.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMultiple philosophers have argued in favor of particular types of idealism as well for years. The course of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" from the 17th to the 19th centuries, being a movement that in large part centered around the application of rationality-based principles such as the [[scientific method]] upon [[human nature]], caused increased interest in ethical philosophy as a field of study. Notions of \"benevolence\" attracted widespread attention in terms of [[Government|governance]], with leaders exhorted to act based on idealistic principles and to particularly champion causes such as the facilitating of [[the arts]], increased [[Education|educational efforts]], effective stewardship of [[national resources]], and so on. This movement increased trends away from [[absolute monarchy]] and [[dictatorship]] towards that of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Republic|republican government]]. The scientifically based, forward thinking viewpoint about human nature when applied to socio-political organization became later known as \"[[classical liberalism]]\".{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|right|Philosopher [[John Locke]], a prominent figure of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]], articulated a vision of the individual and collective pursuit of ideals arising from the logical study and analysis of the state of nature.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\nIn terms of broader discussions on ethics, many classical Enlightenment thinkers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]] have famously argued that strong moral standards on individual choice exist based upon standards of [[rationality]] that can be found through [[Logic|logical analysis]] by reasonable observers. Specifically, instrumental principles based on satisfying one\u2019s desires made up the basis for morality through Hobbes' approach. External principles existing in the discoverable state of nature outside of human experience that became possible to tease out due to personal study constituted Locke's theoretical background for ideals and broader ethics.<ref name=kant>{{citeweb|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/|title=Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy|accessdate=April 8, 2020|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=July 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith respect to social order, Locke's highly influential writings applied rational principles to governance in support of the doctrine of [[social contract theory]], which permeated Enlightenment discussions about the best form of organizing a country. Locke's works such as the ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' set forth an ethical framework in which rational individuals establish a government in order to guarantee their fundamental rights and possess the understanding that they not only can but should alter said government when rational application of the fair-minded \"[[rule of law]]\" has broken down, change taking place when [[liberty]] no longer receives protection. Locke criticized competing theories such as the [[divine right of kings]], which the thinker viewed as folly.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn terms of individual thinking on principles, Lockean morality has emphasized holding to prominent ideals about human behavior, a particular one being the power of education. Locke wrote of its importance in depth within the pages of ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]''. Outlining the best way to rear children in his eyes, Lockean arguments stressed that virtuous actions by adults arose as a direct result of the habits of body and mind taught during youth by forward thinking instructors.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nLocke wrote in his work ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' dividing rational understanding into three inherent areas of scope, the philosopher defining the second as \"practica\" and describing it as,\n{{quote|\"The skill of right applying our own powers and actions, for the attainment of things good and useful. The most considerable... is ethics, which is the seeking out those rules and measures of human actions, which lead to happiness, and the means to practise them. The end of this is not bare speculation and the knowledge of truth; but right, and a conduct suitable to it.\"<ref>John Locke. ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''. Chapter XXI.

Kant's advocacy for the \"[[categorical imperative]]\", a doctrine through which every individual choice has to be made with the consideration of the decider that it ought to be a universally held maxim, took place in the broader context of his metaphysical views. In Kant's writings, defiance of higher idealistic principles was not only wrong in a practical sense but in a fundamentally rational and thus moral sense as well.<ref name=kant/>\n\nWorks authored by Kant on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the latter commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> Within the pages of ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' in particular, the philosopher articulated a vision of people as by their very essence driven by meaningful ethics. Through the lens of Kant's doctrine, no ironclad divide has existed between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with studies of people's ideals.<ref name=frederick/>\n\nSumming up Kant's views on ideals in context, scholar Frederick P. Van De Pitte has written,\n{{quote|\"Kant realized that man's rational capacity alone is not sufficient to constitute his dignity and elevate him above the brutes. If reason only enables him to do for himself what instinct does for the animal, then it would indicate for man no higher aim or destiny than that of the brute but only a different way of attaining the same end. However, reason is man's most essential attribute because it is the means by which a truly distinctive dimension is made possible for him. Reason, that is, reflective awareness, makes it possible to distinguish between good and bad, and thus morality can be made the ruling purpose of life. Because man can consider an array of possibilities, and which among them is the most desirable, he can strive to make himself and his world into a realization of his ideals.\"<ref name=anthropology/>}}\n\nModern Western philosophy in terms of its discussion of ideals largely takes place within the framework of Enlightenment thinking, with figures such as the aforementioned Hobbes, Kant, and Locke dominating debate. As per the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]], itself an evolution from the earlier [[American Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Constitution of the United States]], many theorizing academics of the 19th century and the 20th century have set forth an [[Optimism|optimistic]] view of humanity. Through this moralistic lens, all individuals by nature of their mere existence have been thought to have been born inherently [[Good and evil|good]], inherently [[Social equality|equal]], and inherently [[Freedom|free]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nA defining inflection point of this trend has been the experience of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]]. The historical memory has been argued to have created a sort of dualistic approach to [[ideology]] in which [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] [[democracy]], centered around classical liberalism, gets inherently pitted forever in struggle with [[Tyranny|tyrannies]], centered around the [[Social stratification|stratification of various groups over others]] and mass misery. In the aftermath of the end of the [[Cold War]], studies upon moral idealism have often asked if Enlightenment viewpoints face an inherent intellectual challenge that the doctrines cannot eventually overcome.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the advent of the 21st century, philosophizers have debated the rapid evolution of different cultures, particularly given advancing technology, and the seeming acceptance of [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian values]] previously thought of as radical or undesirable by [[Center-left politics|center-left]], [[Political moderation|moderate]], and [[Center-right politics|center-right]] individuals. The conflict between these people, many of them belonging to younger generations such as the [[Millennials]], and those [[Political extremism|political extremists]] of the [[Far-right politics|global far-right movement]], the social trend often called \"[[Neo-nationalism|new nationalism]]\", has defined new distinctions between what it means to be a \"moral idealist\". As well, the question of the fundamental [[Biology|biological]] advancement of humanity itself has attracted much attention. What a [[transhuman]] or even [[posthuman]] individual would possess terms of ideals in contrast with regular human beings has remained an open question.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broadest sense, the question of whether or not humanity as a whole has fundamentally progressed towards a set of moral ideals over time has never achieved any particular consensus. Examples of philosophers who argue partially in support of the notion include the American thinker [[Richard Rorty]], a figure who has criticized the very concept of unchanging ethical principles set forth in inherent nature while still lauding general social progress.<ref name=rorty/> In contrast, multiple scholars concerned with issues such as [[global climate change]] and potential use of [[weapons of mass destruction]] in future [[warfare]] have lamented particular [[Technology|technological advancements]] and related alterations in broader social culture, the thinkers arguing that fundamental moral progress has truly not occurred given forms of increasing danger to humanity.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nOne optimistic view arising in the 20th century and continuing to receive notice is that of prominent [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] figure [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. He famously predicted that humanity will eventually advance in terms of not just scientific development through natural and engineered [[biological evolution]] but also idealistic morality to a sort of final oneness regarded by him as the '[[Omega Point]]', a mode of existence taking place not only without hatred, pain, and misery but with perfect collective action and consciousness. Known as the \"Catholic Darwin\", his view of evolutionary advancement came out of a religious context through which he identified humanity's final state with Jesus Christ as the \"[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]\" or sacred \"Word\".

In some theories of applied ethics, relative importance has gotten assigned to certain social preferences over others as a way to [[Dispute resolution|resolve disputes effectively]]. In analysis of [[legal theory]], for instance, [[judge]]s have been sometimes called on to resolve the balance between the ideal of [[truth]], which would likely advise hearing out all evidence, and the ideal of broader [[social equality]], which would likely advise seeking to restore goodwill between individuals regardless of specific findings during a particular case. Said judges have also been required to consider the principle of the [[right to a speedy trial]] as well, which places limits on the previous two ideals given the time involved in ferreting out details.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn an August 2005 address, philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] remarked upon the \"moral idealism common to Platonism, Judaism, and Christianity\" and the related notion of strictly specified principles through the lens of applied ethics, asserting to a group of business professionals,\n{{quote|\"[I]ndividuals become aware of more alternatives, and therefore wiser, as they grow older.

Specifically, certain authors known as \"[[New atheism|new atheists]]\" such as [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]] have argued that newly emerging forms of [[secular ethics]] constitute an approach of people treating each other that is more logical, just, and reasonable when seen as a rejoinder to previous forms of \"traditional values\". At the same time, multiple thinkers have advocated for moral relativism and a reduced or non-existent sense of holding to previously well-promoted ideals as a direct result of their wholesale rejection of religion. As well, scholars regardless of personal faith background have commented about the complex nature of ethics when taken from spiritual movements.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Idealistic appeals in practice==\n===In conceptual and historical politics===\n\n[[File:Pericles.jpg|thumb|right|Greek statesman [[Pericles]]' vision of [[Athenian democracy]] stressed a sense of what he saw as core ideals, particularly the intelligence and tolerance displayed by Athenians.<ref name=pericles/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdeals have played a role in [[politics]] for [[millennia]]. For example, iconic Greek statesman [[Pericles]] famously presented an ideal-based view of the [[Mediterranean]] world. In 431, shortly after the [[Peloponnesian War]] had started, Pericles' \"Funeral Oration\" made to commemorate fallen soldiers, described for posterity by the historian [[Thucydides]], presented a view of [[Athens]] and the city-state's broader civilization that emphasized a sense of cleverness and open-mindedness that Pericles believed gave it the strength to rise to different challenges.<ref name=pericles>{{citenews|journal=[[Pbs.org]]|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/background/36.html|title=Pericles Funeral Oration in Depth|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref> Other early historical figures known for appealing to ethical ideals in their [[Public speaking|oratory]] include Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]], the figure's commentary on [[Hellenic Greece|Hellenized]] values leading to his moral appeal among supporters. In contrast to what he saw as [[decadence]] spreading into [[Rome]] and nearby areas from elsewhere, Cato articulated support for what he labeled as traditional Roman ethics.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMost [[Revolution|political revolutions]] have drawn support from the mass appeal of a certain moral idealism in contrast to the doctrines of those holding [[Power (sociology)|power]], having the various grievances with the status quo created from real or perceived misrule spark ethical debate. During the [[French Revolution]], the rhetorical principles of ''\"[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]\"'' (English: ''\"Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood\"'') got raised to the status of clear-cut ideals; the new [[nation state]] constituted a sort of grand experiment in what became in de facto and later de jure a new religion. Many political movements in modern times have centered themselves upon multiple ideals found to be mutually reinforcing. Recent examples have included the [[peace movement]] and the broader opposition expressed worldwide to war in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] as well as elsewhere.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn many cases current and historical, instances have popped up in which proclaimed ideals simply weren't lived up to by various figures while in office, despite claims made by the officials before taking power and since attaining it. In [[British English]], politicians openly changing their opinions in defiance of previous assertions about their ethics have been labeled as making a \"u-turn\". In [[American English]], similar individuals have been pejoratively called \"flip-floppers\". While different, the terms [[U-turn (politics)|have meant the same thing]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdealism in the context of politics has attracted criticism from multiple fronts. For instance, U.S. philosopher [[Gerald Gaus]], the author of ''[[The Tyranny of the Ideal: Justice in a Diverse Society]]'', has prominently argued that an overriding emphasis on ideals causes individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy as well as logical choices during [[Election|elections]]. Gaus has made other warnings such as cautioning that people can lose their sense of how much has already been achieved and how well current situations have become in certain circumstances.

In [[Islam]], for instance, the life of the prophet [[Muhammad]] has been held up as a comprehensive ideal for Muslims to study. However, all of his words and deeds must be interpreted for believers through the lens of his life's broader path and the larger religious context, according to Islamic scholars.

Examples of studied categorizations include [[age]], [[ethnicity]], [[gender identity]], [[nationality]], and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]].

Specifically, a 2018 article published by the ''International Journal of Management Science and Business Administration'' stated that six scholarly studies published in the past had determined that women value ethical principles at a higher level than men in the context of [[business]] and [[economics]]. However, some of those had found only modest differences. As well, four published reports in the past had failed to detect any significant differences between the sexes.<ref name=poor>{{citejournal|title=Comparative Business Ethics \u2013 Idealism and Relativism in Light of Empirical Researches in Eight CEE Countries, Finland, and Turkey|journal=International Journal of Management Science and Business Administration|volume=4|issue=5|date=July 2018|pages=23-33|doi= 10.18775/ijmsba.1849-5664-5419.2014.45.1003|last=Po\u00f3r|first=J\u00f3zsef|last2=Abdulkerim|first2=Yavuzaslan|last3=Ahmet|first3=Bariscil|last4=Koll\u00e1r|first4=P\u00e9ter}}</ref>\n\nThe aforementioned article evaluated distinctions in [[nationality]] and determined that significant differences exist between the various peoples when it comes to idealism in the working environment. In depth, the analysis of eight different European nations, constituting of [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Poland]], appeared to the researchers to have illustrated the effects of contrasting social mores. For example, [[Culture of Croatia|Croatian culture]] faced the problem that \"[t]he significant majority of employees are satisfied with the minimum level of ethical behavior\" while the Finns were labeled as living in a \"traditionally seen... corruption-free or low-corruption and transparent country\".<ref name=poor/>\n\nIn contrast to only finding slight differences in terms of idealism by sex, the study concluded that particular gaps exist between [[Human generation|generations]]; broadly speaking, the older an individual was, the more importance they gave to idealistic ethics.<ref name=poor/>\n\n===Ideals versus absolute or conditional obligations===\n\n[[File:Blood test (1).jpg|thumb|right|Obligated social standards, such as the various [[Social norms|norms]] around the [[Doctor\u2013patient relationship|medical professional and patient relationship]], have been argued by thinkers as existing at a different plane than idealistic moral views.<ref name=norbert/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nPhilosopher [[Norbert Paulo]] has stated that, in common life, ideals as such appear to exist in relation to general social obligations. Many of the latter concepts have tended to appear, according to Paulo, absolute and essentially mandatory while also existing in highly particular circumstances. For instance, Paulo has written, [[Physician|physicians]] and [[Nursing|nurses]] face a variety of [[Doctor\u2013patient relationship|ethical obligations imposed on them when treating their patients]] that regular individuals encountering said patients randomly do not. He had added that a continuum exists between clear-cut, widely held obligations applied via [[Social norm|social norms]] and vague ones only partially behold to cultural sanction.<ref name=norbert/>\n\nPaulo's argument, thus, has concluded that idealist behavior takes place at a behavioral and mental level above and beyond mere social rules, such actions being \"warranted\" yet \"not strictly required\" either while their optional nature sets them up as being \"praiseworthy\". Ideals represent a method of putting into action an individual's [[personal character]] and its given traits such that, Paulo has argued, moral standards get fleshed out beyond the rigid framework of mere obligations. One person's altruistic caring for another generally has constituted a particular example.<ref name=norbert/>\n\n===Ideals versus virtues===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe line between an ideal and a [[virtue]] has been difficult to access. Ideals have been argued to inherently involve aspirations while virtues function as direct guides for assigned conduct given social standards.<ref name=norbert/> Analysis has run into problems given that both entities are [[fuzzy concept]]s. In general, some philosophers have argued that an ideal usually constitutes something more inherent that one can make a [[Habituation|habit]] while virtues, instead, necessarily involve going above and beyond regular decision making in order to actively strive for something. Thus, these thinkers have stated, virtues inherently constitute a behavior that's by its very nature highly difficult to turn into a regular practice. Other philosophers have made the exact opposite argument and seen virtues as fundamentally philosophically weaker entities than ideals.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nGiven the complexity of putting ideals into practice, not to mention resolving conflicts between them, many individuals have chosen to narrowly pick a certain group of them and then harden them into absolute [[dogma]]. Political theorist [[Bernard Crick]] has stated that a way to solve this [[dilemma]] is to have ideals that themselves are descriptive of a generalized process rather than a specific outcome, particularly when the latter is hard to achieve.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nKant wrote in his work ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' pitting idealism against the enactment of personal [[vice]], the philospher arguing,\n{{quote|\"Young man! Deny yourself satisfaction (of amusement, of debauchery, of love, etc.), not with the Stoical intention of complete abstinence, but with the refined Epicurean intention of having in view an ever-growing pleasure. This stinginess with the cash of your vital urge makes you definitely richer through the postponement of pleasure, even if you should, for the most part, renounce the indulgence of it until the end of your life. The awareness of having pleasure under your control is, like everything idealistic, more fruitful and more abundant than everything that satisfies the sense through indulgence because it is thereby simultaneously consumed and consequently lost from the aggregate of totality.\"<ref name=anthropology>{{citebook|title=[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]|authorlink=Immanuel Kant|first=Immanuel|last=Kant|date=1996|translator=Victor Lyle Dowdell|publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]]|ISBN=9780809320608}}</ref>}}\n\n===Relative ideals===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Robert S. Hartman]] has contended that since, colloquially, labeling an entity as ideal means that something is the best member of the set of all things of that class, thus the term has particular implications when used in an ethical context. For example, he has stated, the ideal student constitutes the best member of the set of all students in exactly the same way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles. Since one can define the properties that the ideal member of a class should have, according to Hartman, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is to Hartman. Thus, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is worse than a very smooth one drawn with a compass' aid, but both are better than a regularly made square.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFor Hartman, the world in general has presented a situation in which each particular entity ought usually to become more like its ideal if possible. This entails that, in [[ethics]], each individual should analogously to become more like the hypothetical ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self, in Hartman's view.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Totalizing ideals versus emergent ideals===\n\n[[File:Terry Eagleton in Manchester 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Philosopher [[Terry Eagleton]] has written critically about the practicality of ethical idealism.<ref name=terry/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe question of to what extent one can hold to certain ideals practically and how facing resistance will shape them has attracted debate from multiple thinkers. The related issue of to what extent idealistic morality held by individuals reflects broader cultures has done so as well. The extent to which human beings think through their behavior irrationally or rationally has been a major issue in these such discussions.<ref name=kelly/><ref name=terry/>\n\nOne 21st century philosopher who has delved into the topics is [[Terry Eagleton]]. Writing in his book ''After Theory'', he has commented critically about the practicality of ethical idealism, Eagleton arguing,\n{{quote|\"Moral values which state what you ought to do are impressively idealistic, but too blatantly at odds with your behaviour.

In particular, his book ''As If: Idealization and Ideals'' examined the usefulness of the concepts and the processes through which they've been articulated.
