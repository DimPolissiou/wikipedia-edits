When applied, the probabilities involved in Bayes\u2019 theorem may have different [[probability interpretation]]s. With [[Bayesian probability]] interpretation, the theorem expresses how a degree of belief, expressed as a probability, should rationally change to account for the availability of related evidence. Bayesian inference is fundamental to [[Bayesian statistics]].\n\nBayes\u2019 theorem is named after Reverend [[Thomas Bayes]] ({{IPAc-en|b|e\u026a|z}}; 1701?\u20131761), who first used conditional probability to provide an algorithm (his Proposition 9) that uses evidence to calculate limits on an unknown parameter, published as ''[[An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances]]'' (1763). In what he called a scholium, Bayes extended his algorithm to any unknown prior cause.  Independently of Bayes, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in 1774, and later in his 1812 ''[[Th\u00e9orie analytique des probabilit\u00e9s]]'', used conditional probability to formulate the relation of an updated posterior probability from a prior probability, given evidence. [[Harold Jeffreys|Sir Harold Jeffreys]] put Bayes's algorithm and Laplace\u2019s formulation on an axiomatic basis. Jeffreys wrote that Bayes\u2019 theorem \u201cis to the theory of probability what the [[Pythagorean theorem]] is to geometry.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=Jeffreys |first=Harold |author-link=Harold Jeffreys |year=1973 |title=Scientific Inference |url=https://archive.org/details/scientificinfere0000jeff |url-access=registration |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-521-18078-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/scientificinfere0000jeff/page/31 31]}}</ref>\n\n==Statement of theorem==\nBayes\u2019 theorem is stated mathematically as the following equation:<ref>{{Citation | first1= A. | last1= Stuart | first2= K. | last2= Ord | title= Kendall's Advanced Theory of Statistics: Volume I\u2014Distribution Theory | year= 1994 | publisher= [[Edward Arnold (publisher)|Edward Arnold]] | at= \u00a78.7}}</ref>\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =\n|title=\n|equation = <math>P(A\\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}</math>\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\n\nwhere <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> are [[Event (probability theory)|events]] and <math>P(B) \\neq 0</math>.\n\n* <math>P(A\\mid B)</math> is a [[conditional probability]]: the likelihood of event <math>A</math> occurring given that <math>B</math> is true.\n* <math>P(B\\mid A)</math> is also a conditional probability: the likelihood of event <math>B</math> occurring given that <math>A</math> is true.\n* <math>P(A)</math> and <math>P(B)</math> are the probabilities of observing <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> respectively; they are known as the [[marginal probability]].\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Drug testing===\nA particular test for whether someone has been using marijuana is 90% [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitive]] and 80% [[Specificity (tests)|specific]], meaning  it leads to 90% true  \"positive\"  results (meaning, \"Yes he used marijuana\") for marijuana users and 80% true  negative results for non-users-- but also generates 20% false  positives for non-users. Only 5% of people actually do use marijuana.  What is the [[probability]] that a random person who tests positive is really a drug user? \n\nLet <math>P(\\text{User}| Positive) </math> mean \"the probability that someone is a drug user given that  he tests positive\". Then we can write: \n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nP(\\text{User}| Positive)  &= \\frac{P(Positive|\\text{User}) P(\\text{User})}{P(Positive)} \\\\\n &= \\frac{P(Positive|\\text{User}) P(\\text{User})}{P(Positive|\\text{User}) P(\\text{User}) + P(Positive|\\text{Non-user}) P(\\text{Non-user})} \\\\[8pt]\n&= \\frac{.90 \\times  .05}{.90 \\times  .05 + .20 \\times 0.95} \\\\[8pt]\n&\\approx 19\\%\n\\end{align}</math>\nEven if someone tests positive, the probability they are a drug user is only 19%,  because hardly anybody uses marijuana in this group and so most positives are false positives coming from that 95% of the group.   If all 1,000  people in the group  are tested:\n \n[[File:Bayes-rule3.png|300px|thumb|Figure 1: Using a frequency box to show <math>P(\\text{User}| Positive) </math> visually by comparison of areas ]]\n* 950 are non-users and 190 of them give false positive (.20 x 950) \n* 50 of them are users and 45 of them give true positive (.90 x 50)\n\nThe 1,000 people thus yields 235 positive tests, of which only 45 are genuine drug users, about 19%. See Figure 1 for an illustration using a  frequency table, and note how small the  pink area of true positives is compared to the blue area of false positives. \n\nThe importance of [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]]  can be seen by calculating that even if   sensitivity is raised to 100% and specificity remains at 80%,  the probability of someone testing positive really being a drug user only rises from 19% to 21%, but if the sensitivity is held at 90% and the specificity is increased to 95%,  the probability rises to 49%.\n\n===Cancer rate===\nEven if 100% of patients with pancreatic cancer have a certain symptom, when someone has the same symptom, it does not mean that this person has a 100% chance of getting pancreatic cancer. Assume the incidence rate is 1/10000, while 1/1000 healthy individuals have the same symptoms worldwide, the probability of having pancreatic cancer is only 0.9%, and the other 9.1% could be false positives.\n\nBased on incidence rate, the following table presents the corresponding numbers per 100,000 people.\n{| class=wikitable\n! rowspan=2 | Symptom\n! colspan=2 | Cancer\n| rowspan=2 | Total\n|--\n!

The three machines account for 20%, 30%, and 50% of the factory output. The fraction of defective items produced is 5% for the first machine; 3% for the second machine; and 1% for the third machine. If an item is chosen at random from the total output and is found to be defective, what is the probability that it was produced by the third machine?\n\nOnce again, the answer can be reached without recourse to the formula by applying the conditions to any hypothetical number of cases. For example, if 100,000 items are produced by the factory, 20,000 will be produced by Machine A, 30,000 by Machine B, and 50,000 by Machine C. Machine A will produce 1000 defective items, Machine B 900, and Machine C 500. Of the total 2400 defective items, only 500 (or 5/24) were produced by Machine C.\n\nA solution is as follows. Let ''X<sub>i</sub>'' denote the event that a randomly chosen item was made by the ''i'' <sup>th</sup> machine (for ''i''&nbsp;= A,B,C). Let ''Y'' denote the event that a randomly chosen item is defective. Then, we are given the following information:\n:<math>P(X_A) = 0.2, \\quad P(X_B) = 0.3, \\quad  P(X_C) = 0.5.</math>\nIf the item was made by the first machine, then the probability that it is defective is 0.05; that is, ''P''(''Y''&thinsp;|&thinsp;''X''<sub>A</sub>) = 0.05. Overall, we have\n\n:<math>P(Y\\mid X_A) = 0.05, \\quad  P(Y \\mid X_B) = 0.03, \\quad  P(Y\\mid X_C) = 0.01.</math>\n\nTo answer the original question, we first find ''P''(Y). That can be done in the following way:\n\n:<math>P(Y) = \\sum_i  P(Y\\mid X_i) P(X_i) = (0.05)(0.2) + (0.03)(0.3) + (0.01)(0.5) = 0.024.</math>\n\nHence 2.4% of the total output of the factory is defective.\n\nWe are given that ''Y'' has occurred, and we want to calculate the conditional\nprobability of ''X''<sub>C</sub>. By Bayes\u2019 theorem,\n\n:<math>P(X_C \\mid Y) = \\frac{P(Y \\mid X_C) P(X_C)}{P(Y)} = \\frac{0.01 \\cdot 0.50}{0.024} = \\frac{5}{24}</math>\n\nGiven that the item is defective, the probability that it was made by the third\nmachine is only 5/24. Although machine C produces half of the total output, it\nproduces a much smaller fraction of the defective items. Hence the knowledge\nthat the item selected was defective enables us to replace the prior probability\n''P''(''X''<sub>C</sub>)&nbsp;= 1/2 by the smaller posterior probability ''P''(X<sub>C</sub>&thinsp;|&thinsp;''Y'')&nbsp;= 5/24.\n\n==Interpretations==\n[[File:Bayes theorem visualisation.svg|thumb|192px|Figure 2: A geometric visualisation of Bayes\u2019 theorem.

The two main interpretations are described below. Figure 2 shows a geometric visualization. Gerd Gigerenzer and co-authors have pushed hard for teaching Bayes  Rule this way, with special emphasis on teaching it to physicians.<ref>Gigerenzer, Gerd; Hoffrage, U. (1995). \"How to improve Bayesian reasoning without instruction: Frequency formats\". ''Psychological Review.'' 102 (4): 684.

For example, suppose it is believed with 50% certainty that a coin is twice as likely to land heads than tails. If the coin is flipped a number of times and the outcomes observed, that degree of belief may rise, fall or remain the same depending on the results.\n\nFor proposition ''A'' and evidence ''B'',\n\n:* ''P''\u2009(''A''), the ''prior'', is the initial degree of belief in ''A''.\n:* ''P''\u2009(''A''&thinsp;|&thinsp;''B''), the ''posterior'' is the degree of belief having accounted for ''B''.\n:* the quotient {{sfrac|''P''(''B''&thinsp;{{!}}&thinsp;''A'')|''P''(''B'')}} represents the support ''B'' provides for ''A''.\n\nFor more on the application of Bayes' theorem under the Bayesian interpretation of probability, see [[Bayesian inference]].\n\n===Frequentist interpretation===\n[[File:Bayes theorem tree diagrams.svg|thumb|Illustration of frequentist interpretation with [[Tree diagram (probability theory)|tree diagrams]]. Bayes\u2019 theorem connects conditional probabilities to their inverses.]]\n\nIn the [[Frequentist interpretation of probability|frequentist interpretation]], probability measures a \u201cproportion of outcomes.\u201d For example, suppose an experiment is performed many times. ''P''(''A'') is the proportion of outcomes with property ''A'', and ''P''(''B'') that with property ''B''. ''P''(''B''&thinsp;|&thinsp;''A'') is the proportion of outcomes with property ''B'' ''out of'' outcomes with property ''A'', and ''P''(''A''&thinsp;|&thinsp;''B'') the proportion of those with ''A'' ''out of'' those with&nbsp;''B''.\n\nThe role of Bayes\u2019 theorem is best visualized with tree diagrams, as shown to the right. The two diagrams partition the same outcomes by ''A'' and ''B'' in opposite orders, to obtain the inverse probabilities. Bayes' theorem serves as the link between these different partitionings.\n\n====Example====\n[[File:Bayes theorem simple example tree.svg|thumb|Tree diagram illustrating frequentist example. R, C, P and P bar are the events representing rare, common, pattern and no pattern. Percentages in parentheses are calculated. Three independent values are given, so it is possible to calculate the inverse tree (see figure above).]]\n\nAn [[Entomology|entomologist]] spots what might be a rare [[subspecies]] of [[beetle]], due to the pattern on its back. In the rare subspecies, 98% have the pattern, or ''P''(Pattern&nbsp;|&nbsp;Rare) = 98%. In the common subspecies, 5% have the pattern. The rare subspecies accounts for only 0.1% of the population. How likely is the beetle having the pattern to be rare, or what is ''P''(Rare&nbsp;|&nbsp;Pattern)?\n\nFrom the extended form of Bayes\u2019 theorem (since any beetle can be only rare or common),\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\nP(\\text{Rare}\\mid \\text{Pattern}) &= \\frac{P(\\text{Pattern}\\mid \\text{Rare})P(\\text{Rare})} {P(\\text{Pattern})}\n\\\\[8pt] &= \\frac{P(\\text{Pattern}\\mid \\text{Rare})P(\\text{Rare})} {P(\\text{Pattern}\\mid \\text{Rare}) P(\\text{Rare}) + P(\\text{Pattern}\\mid \\text{Common})P(\\text{Common})}\n\\\\[8pt] &= \\frac{0.98 \\times 0.001} {0.98 \\times 0.001 + 0.05 \\times 0.999}\n\\\\[8pt] &\\approx 1.9\\%\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Forms==\n\n===Events===\n\n====Simple form====\nFor events ''A'' and ''B'', provided that ''P''(''B'')&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;0,\n\n:<math>P(A\\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid  A) P(A)}{P(B)}\\cdot </math>\n\nIn many applications, for instance in [[Bayesian inference]], the event ''B'' is fixed in the discussion, and we wish to consider the impact of its having been observed on our belief in various possible events ''A''. In such a situation the denominator of the last expression, the probability of the given evidence ''B'', is fixed; what we want to vary is ''A''. Bayes\u2019 theorem then shows that the posterior probabilities are [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the numerator:\n\n:<math>P(A\\mid B) \\propto P(A) \\cdot P(B\\mid A) </math> (proportionality over ''A'' for given ''B'').\n\nThe posterior is proportional to the prior times the likelihood.<ref>\n\n{{Cite book\n |last=Lee\n |first=Peter M.\n |title=Bayesian Statistics\n |chapter-url=http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~pml1/bayes/book.htm\n |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]]\n |year=2012\n |isbn=978-1-1183-3257-3 <!-- |isbn=978-1-1183-5977-8 -->\n |chapter=Chapter 1\n}}\n\n</ref>\n\nIf events ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, ..., are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, i.e., one of them is certain to occur but no two can occur together, and we know their probabilities up to proportionality, then we can determine the proportionality constant by using the fact that their probabilities must add up to one.

Many people seek to approximate their chances of being affected by a genetic disease or their likelihood of being a carrier for a recessive gene of interest. A Bayesian analysis can be done based on family history or genetic testing, in order to predict whether an individual will develop a disease or pass one on to their children. Genetic testing and prediction is a common practice among couples who plan to have children but are concerned that they may both be carriers for a disease, especially within communities with low genetic variance. \n\nThe first step in Bayesian analysis for genetics is to propose mutually exclusive hypotheses: for a specific allele, an individual either is or is not a carrier. Next, four probabilities are calculated: Prior Probability (the likelihood of each hypothesis considering information such as family history or predictions based on Mendelian Inheritance), Conditional Probability (of a certain outcome), Joint Probability (product of the first two), and Posterior Probability (a weighted product calculated by dividing the Joint Probability for each hypothesis by the sum of both joint probabilities). This type of analysis can be done based purely on family history of a condition or in concert with genetic testing. \n\n=== Using Pedigree to Calculate Probabilities ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|Hypothesis 1: Patient is a carrier\n|Hypothesis 2: Patient is not a carrier\n|-\n|Prior Probability\n|1/2\n|1/2\n|-\n|Conditional Probability that all four offspring will be unaffected\n|(\u00bd)*(\u00bd)*(\u00bd)*(\u00bd) = 1/16 \n|About 1\n|-\n|Joint Probability\n|(\u00bd)*(1/16) = 1/32 \n|(\u00bd)*1 = 1/2\n|-\n|Posterior Probability\n|(1/32)/(1/32 + \u00bd) = 1/17\n|(\u00bd)/ (1/32 + \u00bd) = 16/17\n|}\nExample of a Bayesian Analysis Table for a female individual\u2019s risk for a disease based on the knowledge that the disease is present in her siblings but not in her parents or any of her four children. Based solely on the status of the subject\u2019s siblings and parents, she is equally likely to be a carrier as to be a non-carrier (this likelihood is denoted by the Prior Hypothesis). However, the probability that the subject\u2019s four sons would all be unaffected is 1/16 (\u00bd*\u00bd*\u00bd*\u00bd) if she is a carrier, about 1 if she is a non-carrier (this is the Conditional Probability). The Joint Probability reconciles these two predictions by multiplying them together. The last line (the Posterior Probability) is calculated by dividing the Joint Probability for each hypothesis by the sum of both joint probabilities<ref>Ogino, Shuji, et al. \u201cBayesian Analysis for Cystic Fibrosis Risks in Prenatal and Carrier Screening.\u201d Genetics in Medicine, vol. 6, no. 5, Sept. 2004, pp. 439\u201349. www.nature.com, doi:10.1097/01.GIM.0000139511.83336.8F.</ref>. \n\n=== Using Genetic Test Results ===\nPrenatal genetic testing, while still a controversial practice, can detect around 90% of known disease alleles in parents that can lead to carrier or affected status in their child. Cystic Fibrosis is a heritable disease caused by an autosomal recessive mutation on the CFTR gene<ref>\u201cTypes of CFTR Mutations.\u201d Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, www.cff.org/What-is-CF/Genetics/Types-of-CFTR-Mutations/.</ref>, located on the q arm of chromosome 7<ref>\u201cCFTR Gene - Genetics Home Reference .\u201d U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CFTR#location.</ref>. \n\nBayesian Analysis of a female patient with a family history of Cystic Fibrosis, who has tested negative for CF, demonstrating how this method was used to determine her risk of having a child born with CF: \n\nBecause the patient is unaffected, she is either homozygous for the wild-type allele, or heterozygous. To establish prior probabilities, a Punnett square is used, based on the knowledge that neither parent was affected by the disease but both could have been carriers:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|W\n\nMother was homozygous for the wild-type allele \n\n(a non-carrier) \n|M\n\nMother was heterozygous (a CF carrier)\n|-\n|W\n\nFather was homozygous for the wild-type allele \n\n(a non-carrier)\n|WW\n|MW\n|-\n|M\n\nFather was heterozygous (a CF carrier)\n|MW\n|MM\n\n(affected by cystic fibrosis)\n|}\nGiven that the patient is unaffected, there are only three possibilities. Within these three, there are two scenarios in which the patient carries the mutant allele. Thus the prior probabilities are \u2154 and \u2153. \n\nNext, the patient undergoes genetic testing and tests negative for cystic fibrosis. This test has a 90% detection rate, so the conditional probabilities of a negative test are 1/10 and 1.\u00a0 Finally, the joint and posterior probabilities are calculated as before.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|Hypothesis 1: Patient is a carrier\n|Hypothesis 2: Patient is not a carrier\n|-\n|Prior Probability\n|2/3\n|1/3\n|-\n|Conditional Probability of a negative test\n|1/10\n|1\n|-\n|Joint Probability\n|1/15\n|1/3\n|-\n|Posterior Probability\n|1/6\n|5/6\n|}\nAfter carrying out the same analysis on the patient\u2019s male partner (with a negative test result), the chances of their child being affected is equal to the product of the parents\u2019 respective prior probabilities for being carriers times the chances that two carriers will produce an affected offspring (\u00bc). \n\n=== Genetic testing done in parallel with other risk factor identification. ===\nBayesian analysis can be done using phenotypic information associated with a genetic condition, and when combined with genetic testing this analysis becomes much more complicated. Cystic Fibrosis, for example, can be identified in a fetus through an ultrasound looking for an echogenic bowel, meaning one that appears brighter than normal on a scan2. This is not a foolproof test, as an echogenic bowel can be present in a\u00a0 perfectly healthy fetus. Parental genetic testing is very influential in this case, where a phenotypic facet can be overly influential in probability calculation. In the case of a fetus with an echogenic bowel, with a mother who has been tested and is known to be a CF carrier, the posterior probability that the fetus actually has the disease is very high (0.64). However, once the father has tested negative for CF, the posterior probability drops significantly (to 0.16)<ref>Ogino, Shuji, et al. \u201cBayesian Analysis for Cystic Fibrosis Risks in Prenatal and Carrier Screening.\u201d Genetics in Medicine, vol. 6, no. 5, Sept. 2004, pp. 439\u201349. www.nature.com, doi:10.1097/01.GIM.0000139511.83336.8F.</ref>. \u00a0\n\nRisk factor calculation is a powerful tool in genetic counseling and reproductive planning, but it cannot be treated as the only important factor to consider. As above, incomplete testing can yield falsely high probability of carrier status, and testing can be financially inaccessible or unfeasible when a parent is not present. \n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Quantum Bayesianism]]\n* [[Bayesian inference]]\n* [[Bayesian probability]]\n* [[Inductive probability]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bruss, F.

When applied, the probabilities involved in Bayes\u2019 theorem may have different [[probability interpretation]]s. With [[Bayesian probability]] interpretation, the theorem expresses how a degree of belief, expressed as a probability, should rationally change to account for the availability of related evidence. Bayesian inference is fundamental to [[Bayesian statistics]].\n\nBayes\u2019 theorem is named after Reverend [[Thomas Bayes]] ({{IPAc-en|b|e\u026a|z}}; 1701?\u20131761), who first used conditional probability to provide an algorithm (his Proposition 9) that uses evidence to calculate limits on an unknown parameter, published as ''[[An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances]]'' (1763). In what he called a scholium, Bayes extended his algorithm to any unknown prior cause.  Independently of Bayes, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in 1774, and later in his 1812 ''[[Th\u00e9orie analytique des probabilit\u00e9s]]'', used conditional probability to formulate the relation of an updated posterior probability from a prior probability, given evidence. [[Harold Jeffreys|Sir Harold Jeffreys]] put Bayes's algorithm and Laplace\u2019s formulation on an axiomatic basis. Jeffreys wrote that Bayes\u2019 theorem \u201cis to the theory of probability what the [[Pythagorean theorem]] is to geometry.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=Jeffreys |first=Harold |author-link=Harold Jeffreys |year=1973 |title=Scientific Inference |url=https://archive.org/details/scientificinfere0000jeff |url-access=registration |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-521-18078-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/scientificinfere0000jeff/page/31 31]}}</ref>\n\n==Statement of theorem==\nBayes\u2019 theorem is stated mathematically as the following equation:<ref>{{Citation | first1= A. | last1= Stuart | first2= K. | last2= Ord | title= Kendall's Advanced Theory of Statistics: Volume I\u2014Distribution Theory | year= 1994 | publisher= [[Edward Arnold (publisher)|Edward Arnold]] | at= \u00a78.7}}</ref>\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =\n|title=\n|equation = <math>P(A\\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}</math>\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\n\nwhere <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> are [[Event (probability theory)|events]] and <math>P(B) \\neq 0</math>.\n\n* <math>P(A\\mid B)</math> is a [[conditional probability]]: the likelihood of event <math>A</math> occurring given that <math>B</math> is true.\n* <math>P(B\\mid A)</math> is also a conditional probability: the likelihood of event <math>B</math> occurring given that <math>A</math> is true.\n* <math>P(A)</math> and <math>P(B)</math> are the probabilities of observing <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> respectively; they are known as the [[marginal probability]].\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Drug testing===\nA particular test for whether someone has been using marijuana is 90% [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitive]] and 80% [[Specificity (tests)|specific]], meaning  it leads to 90% true  \"positive\"  results (meaning, \"Yes he used marijuana\") for marijuana users and 80% true  negative results for non-users-- but also generates 20% false  positives for non-users. Only 5% of people actually do use marijuana.  What is the [[probability]] that a random person who tests positive is really a drug user? \n\nLet <math>P(\\text{User}| Positive) </math> mean \"the probability that someone is a drug user given that  he tests positive\". Then we can write: \n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nP(\\text{User}| Positive)  &= \\frac{P(Positive|\\text{User}) P(\\text{User})}{P(Positive)} \\\\\n &= \\frac{P(Positive|\\text{User}) P(\\text{User})}{P(Positive|\\text{User}) P(\\text{User}) + P(Positive|\\text{Non-user}) P(\\text{Non-user})} \\\\[8pt]\n&= \\frac{.90 \\times  .05}{.90 \\times  .05 + .20 \\times 0.95} \\\\[8pt]\n&\\approx 19\\%\n\\end{align}</math>\nEven if someone tests positive, the probability they are a drug user is only 19%,  because hardly anybody uses marijuana in this group and so most positives are false positives coming from that 95% of the group.   If all 1,000  people in the group  are tested:\n[[File:Bayes-rule.png|300px|thumb|Figure 1: Using a frequency box to show <math>P(\\text{User}| Positive) </math> visually by comparison of areas]]\n\n* 950 are non-users and 190 of them give false positive (.20 x 950) \n* 50 of them are users and 45 of them give true positive (.90 x 50)\n\nThe 1,000 people thus yields 235 positive tests, of which only 45 are genuine drug users, about 19%. See Figure 1 for an illustration using a  frequency table, and note how small the  pink area of true positives is compared to the blue area of false positives. \n\nThe importance of [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]]  can be seen by calculating that even if   sensitivity is raised to 100% and specificity remains at 80%,  the probability of someone testing positive really being a drug user only rises from 19% to 21%, but if the sensitivity is held at 90% and the specificity is increased to 95%,  the probability rises to 49%.\n\n===Cancer rate===\nEven if 100% of patients with pancreatic cancer have a certain symptom, when someone has the same symptom, it does not mean that this person has a 100% chance of getting pancreatic cancer. Assume the incidence rate is 1/10000, while 1/1000 healthy individuals have the same symptoms worldwide, the probability of having pancreatic cancer is only 0.9%, and the other 9.1% could be false positives.\n\nBased on incidence rate, the following table presents the corresponding numbers per 100,000 people.\n{| class=wikitable\n! rowspan=2 | Symptom\n! colspan=2 | Cancer\n| rowspan=2 | Total\n|--\n!

The three machines account for 20%, 30%, and 50% of the factory output. The fraction of defective items produced is 5% for the first machine; 3% for the second machine; and 1% for the third machine. If an item is chosen at random from the total output and is found to be defective, what is the probability that it was produced by the third machine?\n\nOnce again, the answer can be reached without recourse to the formula by applying the conditions to any hypothetical number of cases. For example, if 100,000 items are produced by the factory, 20,000 will be produced by Machine A, 30,000 by Machine B, and 50,000 by Machine C. Machine A will produce 1000 defective items, Machine B 900, and Machine C 500. Of the total 2400 defective items, only 500 (or 5/24) were produced by Machine C.\n\nA solution is as follows. Let ''X<sub>i</sub>'' denote the event that a randomly chosen item was made by the ''i'' <sup>th</sup> machine (for ''i''&nbsp;= A,B,C). Let ''Y'' denote the event that a randomly chosen item is defective. Then, we are given the following information:\n:<math>P(X_A) = 0.2, \\quad P(X_B) = 0.3, \\quad  P(X_C) = 0.5.</math>\nIf the item was made by the first machine, then the probability that it is defective is 0.05; that is, ''P''(''Y''&thinsp;|&thinsp;''X''<sub>A</sub>) = 0.05. Overall, we have\n\n:<math>P(Y\\mid X_A) = 0.05, \\quad  P(Y \\mid X_B) = 0.03, \\quad  P(Y\\mid X_C) = 0.01.</math>\n\nTo answer the original question, we first find ''P''(Y). That can be done in the following way:\n\n:<math>P(Y) = \\sum_i  P(Y\\mid X_i) P(X_i) = (0.05)(0.2) + (0.03)(0.3) + (0.01)(0.5) = 0.024.</math>\n\nHence 2.4% of the total output of the factory is defective.\n\nWe are given that ''Y'' has occurred, and we want to calculate the conditional\nprobability of ''X''<sub>C</sub>. By Bayes\u2019 theorem,\n\n:<math>P(X_C \\mid Y) = \\frac{P(Y \\mid X_C) P(X_C)}{P(Y)} = \\frac{0.01 \\cdot 0.50}{0.024} = \\frac{5}{24}</math>\n\nGiven that the item is defective, the probability that it was made by the third\nmachine is only 5/24. Although machine C produces half of the total output, it\nproduces a much smaller fraction of the defective items. Hence the knowledge\nthat the item selected was defective enables us to replace the prior probability\n''P''(''X''<sub>C</sub>)&nbsp;= 1/2 by the smaller posterior probability ''P''(X<sub>C</sub>&thinsp;|&thinsp;''Y'')&nbsp;= 5/24.\n\n==Interpretations==\n[[File:Bayes theorem visualisation.svg|thumb|192px|Figure 2: A geometric visualisation of Bayes\u2019 theorem.

The two main interpretations are described below. Figure 2 shows a geometric visualization. Gerd Gigerenzer and co-authors have pushed hard for teaching Bayes  Rule this way, with special emphasis on teaching it to physicians.<ref>Gigerenzer, Gerd; Hoffrage, U. (1995). \"How to improve Bayesian reasoning without instruction: Frequency formats\". ''Psychological Review.'' 102 (4): 684.

For example, suppose it is believed with 50% certainty that a coin is twice as likely to land heads than tails. If the coin is flipped a number of times and the outcomes observed, that degree of belief may rise, fall or remain the same depending on the results.\n\nFor proposition ''A'' and evidence ''B'',\n\n:* ''P''\u2009(''A''), the ''prior'', is the initial degree of belief in ''A''.\n:* ''P''\u2009(''A''&thinsp;|&thinsp;''B''), the ''posterior'' is the degree of belief having accounted for ''B''.\n:* the quotient {{sfrac|''P''(''B''&thinsp;{{!}}&thinsp;''A'')|''P''(''B'')}} represents the support ''B'' provides for ''A''.\n\nFor more on the application of Bayes' theorem under the Bayesian interpretation of probability, see [[Bayesian inference]].\n\n===Frequentist interpretation===\n[[File:Bayes theorem tree diagrams.svg|thumb|Illustration of frequentist interpretation with [[Tree diagram (probability theory)|tree diagrams]]. Bayes\u2019 theorem connects conditional probabilities to their inverses.]]\n\nIn the [[Frequentist interpretation of probability|frequentist interpretation]], probability measures a \u201cproportion of outcomes.\u201d For example, suppose an experiment is performed many times. ''P''(''A'') is the proportion of outcomes with property ''A'', and ''P''(''B'') that with property ''B''. ''P''(''B''&thinsp;|&thinsp;''A'') is the proportion of outcomes with property ''B'' ''out of'' outcomes with property ''A'', and ''P''(''A''&thinsp;|&thinsp;''B'') the proportion of those with ''A'' ''out of'' those with&nbsp;''B''.\n\nThe role of Bayes\u2019 theorem is best visualized with tree diagrams, as shown to the right. The two diagrams partition the same outcomes by ''A'' and ''B'' in opposite orders, to obtain the inverse probabilities. Bayes' theorem serves as the link between these different partitionings.\n\n====Example====\n[[File:Bayes theorem simple example tree.svg|thumb|Tree diagram illustrating frequentist example. R, C, P and P bar are the events representing rare, common, pattern and no pattern. Percentages in parentheses are calculated. Three independent values are given, so it is possible to calculate the inverse tree (see figure above).]]\n\nAn [[Entomology|entomologist]] spots what might be a rare [[subspecies]] of [[beetle]], due to the pattern on its back. In the rare subspecies, 98% have the pattern, or ''P''(Pattern&nbsp;|&nbsp;Rare) = 98%. In the common subspecies, 5% have the pattern. The rare subspecies accounts for only 0.1% of the population. How likely is the beetle having the pattern to be rare, or what is ''P''(Rare&nbsp;|&nbsp;Pattern)?\n\nFrom the extended form of Bayes\u2019 theorem (since any beetle can be only rare or common),\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\nP(\\text{Rare}\\mid \\text{Pattern}) &= \\frac{P(\\text{Pattern}\\mid \\text{Rare})P(\\text{Rare})} {P(\\text{Pattern})}\n\\\\[8pt] &= \\frac{P(\\text{Pattern}\\mid \\text{Rare})P(\\text{Rare})} {P(\\text{Pattern}\\mid \\text{Rare}) P(\\text{Rare}) + P(\\text{Pattern}\\mid \\text{Common})P(\\text{Common})}\n\\\\[8pt] &= \\frac{0.98 \\times 0.001} {0.98 \\times 0.001 + 0.05 \\times 0.999}\n\\\\[8pt] &\\approx 1.9\\%\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Forms==\n\n===Events===\n\n====Simple form====\nFor events ''A'' and ''B'', provided that ''P''(''B'')&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;0,\n\n:<math>P(A\\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid  A) P(A)}{P(B)}\\cdot </math>\n\nIn many applications, for instance in [[Bayesian inference]], the event ''B'' is fixed in the discussion, and we wish to consider the impact of its having been observed on our belief in various possible events ''A''. In such a situation the denominator of the last expression, the probability of the given evidence ''B'', is fixed; what we want to vary is ''A''. Bayes\u2019 theorem then shows that the posterior probabilities are [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the numerator:\n\n:<math>P(A\\mid B) \\propto P(A) \\cdot P(B\\mid A) </math> (proportionality over ''A'' for given ''B'').\n\nThe posterior is proportional to the prior times the likelihood.<ref>\n\n{{Cite book\n |last=Lee\n |first=Peter M.\n |title=Bayesian Statistics\n |chapter-url=http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~pml1/bayes/book.htm\n |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]]\n |year=2012\n |isbn=978-1-1183-3257-3 <!-- |isbn=978-1-1183-5977-8 -->\n |chapter=Chapter 1\n}}\n\n</ref>\n\nIf events ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, ..., are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, i.e., one of them is certain to occur but no two can occur together, and we know their probabilities up to proportionality, then we can determine the proportionality constant by using the fact that their probabilities must add up to one.

Many people seek to approximate their chances of being affected by a genetic disease or their likelihood of being a carrier for a recessive gene of interest. A Bayesian analysis can be done based on family history or genetic testing, in order to predict whether an individual will develop a disease or pass one on to their children. Genetic testing and prediction is a common practice among couples who plan to have children but are concerned that they may both be carriers for a disease, especially within communities with low genetic variance. \n\nThe first step in Bayesian analysis for genetics is to propose mutually exclusive hypotheses: for a specific allele, an individual either is or is not a carrier. Next, four probabilities are calculated: Prior Probability (the likelihood of each hypothesis considering information such as family history or predictions based on Mendelian Inheritance), Conditional Probability (of a certain outcome), Joint Probability (product of the first two), and Posterior Probability (a weighted product calculated by dividing the Joint Probability for each hypothesis by the sum of both joint probabilities). This type of analysis can be done based purely on family history of a condition or in concert with genetic testing. \n\n=== Using Pedigree to Calculate Probabilities ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|Hypothesis 1: Patient is a carrier\n|Hypothesis 2: Patient is not a carrier\n|-\n|Prior Probability\n|1/2\n|1/2\n|-\n|Conditional Probability that all four offspring will be unaffected\n|(\u00bd)*(\u00bd)*(\u00bd)*(\u00bd) = 1/16 \n|About 1\n|-\n|Joint Probability\n|(\u00bd)*(1/16) = 1/32 \n|(\u00bd)*1 = 1/2\n|-\n|Posterior Probability\n|(1/32)/(1/32 + \u00bd) = 1/17\n|(\u00bd)/ (1/32 + \u00bd) = 16/17\n|}\nExample of a Bayesian Analysis Table for a female individual\u2019s risk for a disease based on the knowledge that the disease is present in her siblings but not in her parents or any of her four children. Based solely on the status of the subject\u2019s siblings and parents, she is equally likely to be a carrier as to be a non-carrier (this likelihood is denoted by the Prior Hypothesis). However, the probability that the subject\u2019s four sons would all be unaffected is 1/16 (\u00bd*\u00bd*\u00bd*\u00bd) if she is a carrier, about 1 if she is a non-carrier (this is the Conditional Probability). The Joint Probability reconciles these two predictions by multiplying them together. The last line (the Posterior Probability) is calculated by dividing the Joint Probability for each hypothesis by the sum of both joint probabilities<ref>Ogino, Shuji, et al. \u201cBayesian Analysis for Cystic Fibrosis Risks in Prenatal and Carrier Screening.\u201d Genetics in Medicine, vol. 6, no. 5, Sept. 2004, pp. 439\u201349. www.nature.com, doi:10.1097/01.GIM.0000139511.83336.8F.</ref>. \n\n=== Using Genetic Test Results ===\nPrenatal genetic testing, while still a controversial practice, can detect around 90% of known disease alleles in parents that can lead to carrier or affected status in their child. Cystic Fibrosis is a heritable disease caused by an autosomal recessive mutation on the CFTR gene<ref>\u201cTypes of CFTR Mutations.\u201d Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, www.cff.org/What-is-CF/Genetics/Types-of-CFTR-Mutations/.</ref>, located on the q arm of chromosome 7<ref>\u201cCFTR Gene - Genetics Home Reference .\u201d U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CFTR#location.</ref>. \n\nBayesian Analysis of a female patient with a family history of Cystic Fibrosis, who has tested negative for CF, demonstrating how this method was used to determine her risk of having a child born with CF: \n\nBecause the patient is unaffected, she is either homozygous for the wild-type allele, or heterozygous. To establish prior probabilities, a Punnett square is used, based on the knowledge that neither parent was affected by the disease but both could have been carriers:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|W\n\nMother was homozygous for the wild-type allele \n\n(a non-carrier) \n|M\n\nMother was heterozygous (a CF carrier)\n|-\n|W\n\nFather was homozygous for the wild-type allele \n\n(a non-carrier)\n|WW\n|MW\n|-\n|M\n\nFather was heterozygous (a CF carrier)\n|MW\n|MM\n\n(affected by cystic fibrosis)\n|}\nGiven that the patient is unaffected, there are only three possibilities. Within these three, there are two scenarios in which the patient carries the mutant allele. Thus the prior probabilities are \u2154 and \u2153. \n\nNext, the patient undergoes genetic testing and tests negative for cystic fibrosis. This test has a 90% detection rate, so the conditional probabilities of a negative test are 1/10 and 1.\u00a0 Finally, the joint and posterior probabilities are calculated as before.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|Hypothesis 1: Patient is a carrier\n|Hypothesis 2: Patient is not a carrier\n|-\n|Prior Probability\n|2/3\n|1/3\n|-\n|Conditional Probability of a negative test\n|1/10\n|1\n|-\n|Joint Probability\n|1/15\n|1/3\n|-\n|Posterior Probability\n|1/6\n|5/6\n|}\nAfter carrying out the same analysis on the patient\u2019s male partner (with a negative test result), the chances of their child being affected is equal to the product of the parents\u2019 respective prior probabilities for being carriers times the chances that two carriers will produce an affected offspring (\u00bc). \n\n=== Genetic testing done in parallel with other risk factor identification. ===\nBayesian analysis can be done using phenotypic information associated with a genetic condition, and when combined with genetic testing this analysis becomes much more complicated. Cystic Fibrosis, for example, can be identified in a fetus through an ultrasound looking for an echogenic bowel, meaning one that appears brighter than normal on a scan2. This is not a foolproof test, as an echogenic bowel can be present in a\u00a0 perfectly healthy fetus. Parental genetic testing is very influential in this case, where a phenotypic facet can be overly influential in probability calculation. In the case of a fetus with an echogenic bowel, with a mother who has been tested and is known to be a CF carrier, the posterior probability that the fetus actually has the disease is very high (0.64). However, once the father has tested negative for CF, the posterior probability drops significantly (to 0.16)<ref>Ogino, Shuji, et al. \u201cBayesian Analysis for Cystic Fibrosis Risks in Prenatal and Carrier Screening.\u201d Genetics in Medicine, vol. 6, no. 5, Sept. 2004, pp. 439\u201349. www.nature.com, doi:10.1097/01.GIM.0000139511.83336.8F.</ref>. \u00a0\n\nRisk factor calculation is a powerful tool in genetic counseling and reproductive planning, but it cannot be treated as the only important factor to consider. As above, incomplete testing can yield falsely high probability of carrier status, and testing can be financially inaccessible or unfeasible when a parent is not present. \n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Quantum Bayesianism]]\n* [[Bayesian inference]]\n* [[Bayesian probability]]\n* [[Inductive probability]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bruss, F.

Woolworth Company]] in the United States, the now-defunct [[Woolworths Group]] in the UK or the South African chain of retail stores, [[Woolworths Holdings Limited]]. Its main operations include supermarkets (under the [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]] brand in Australia and the [[Countdown (supermarket)|Countdown]] brand in New Zealand), liquor retailing (as [[BWS (liquor retailer)|BWS]] and [[Dan Murphy's]] in Australia), hotels and pubs under the Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group (ALH Group) umbrella, and discount department stores under the [[Big W]] name in Australia.\n\nThe company announced a loss of $1.235 billion for the 2016 financial year on 25 August 2016, the biggest in more than 20 years since it has been publicly listed on the [[Australian Securities Exchange|ASX]], mainly due to more than $2 billion in write-downs of the failed [[Masters Home Improvement|Masters]] business and losses in the [[Big W]] business.\n\n==History==<!-- This section is linked from [[Woolworth's]] -->\n[[File:Woolworths Building, George Street, Sydney.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Woolworths flagship store in the Sydney CBD]]\n{{For|a company listing|List of Woolworths Limited companies}}\nWoolworths opened its first store, the Woolworths Stupendous Bargain Basement, in the old Imperial Arcade [[Pitt Street]], [[Sydney]], where [[Westfield Sydney]] now stands, on 5 December 1924. Its nominal capital was just \u00a3185,000 and although 85,000 shares were offered to the public, only 81,707 shares were subscribed for by 619 people, including the five founders \u2013 Percy Christmas, Stanley Chatterton, Cecil Scott Waine, George Creed and Ernest Williams. One of the foundation investors was [[Preston Lanchester Gowing]], the then chairman of [[Gowings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esvc000089.wic034u.server-web.com/downloads/2002%20Annual%20Report.pdf |title=GOW372_Annual(pg1-14) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref> The name on the draft prospectus drawn up by Cecil Scott Waine was \"Wallworths Bazaar\" \u2013 a play on the [[F.W. Woolworth Company|F.W. Woolworth]] name (the owner of the Woolworth's chain in the United States and United Kingdom). Moreover, according to Ernest Robert Williams, Percy Christmas dared him to register the name Woolworths instead, which he succeeded in doing after finding out the name was available for use in [[New South Wales]]. Accordingly, Woolworths Ltd in Australia has no connection with the [[F.W. Woolworth Company]] in the United States, nor the [[Woolworths Group]] of UK. It also has no connection to the [[Woolworths (South Africa)|Woolworths Group in South Africa]].\n\nThe new Woolworths store was innovative; it was the first variety store in the world to use cash registers that print receipts for customers.\n\nChristmas set up a New Zealand general merchandise operation in Wellington in 1929. Woolworths New Zealand opened its first food store in Auckland in 1956, and supermarkets in 1971. Woolworths New Zealand was sold to the company that is now [[Lion Nathan]] in 1979, then sold to Dairy Farm International in 1990, now owned by [[Progressive Enterprises]], a subsidiary of Foodland Associated Limited of Australia. In 2005 Woolworths Limited and [[Metcash|Metcash Holdings]] agreed to purchase a demerged Foodland, and [[Progressive Enterprises]] and 23 of Foodland's [[Action (supermarket chain)|Action]] supermarkets came under Woolworths' ownership. This acquisition brought total store numbers in Australia to near 750.\n\nDuring the late 1920s, the company grew, with a second store in Sydney and stores in [[Brisbane]] and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. It grew further in the 1930s, despite the depression, until by the end of 1933 it had 23 stores. In 1933 the first store in [[Melbourne]] was opened. On 1 April 1936 the company bought eight stores from Edments Ltd and opened its first store in [[Adelaide]]. The original Imperial Arcade store was moved to larger premises in Her Majesty's Arcade, a short distance along Pitt Street near the Market Street corner.\n\n[[World War II]] slowed the growth of Woolworths and the Australian and United States military used Woolworths' warehouses in Sydney for storage. After the war expansion was rapid and in 1955 Woolworths opened its 200th store, in the Civic Centre in [[Canberra]] (since closed). At this point Woolworths was still mainly a variety chain and had not moved into the food sector that uses the \"Woolworths\" brand today. This move began in 1955 when it opened its first supermarket at [[Beverly Hills, Sydney|Beverly Hills]], south-west of Sydney. The company bought the Rockmans chain of women's clothing stores in 1960.\n\nIn the 1970s, the company started to open Big W discount department stores and the slow removal of many variety products from the supermarket and variety stores began. This process finished in 1989 when the last of the Woolworths Variety stores was closed (except the one in [[Rundle Mall]]) and the \"Family Centres\" were split into separate Big W and Woolworths supermarket stores. Woolworths acquired the [[Dick Smith (retailer)|Dick Smith Electronics]] consumer electronics chain in 1981 and expanded the consumer electronics arm of its business with the purchase of the Tandy chain in Australia from InterTan Inc in 2001. The company sold the Rockmans chain in 2000, and the Dick Smith Electronics chain in 2012.\n\nIn 1985, the acquisition of the 126 Safeway stores in eastern Australia made Woolworths the largest food retailer in Australia. Safeway stores were in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland and included Food Barns in Queensland and northern New South Wales. The stores were acquired following an agreement whereby [[Safeway Stores Inc.|Safeway]] acquired a 19.99% interest in Woolworths Limited. Woolworths and Safeway supermarkets in Victoria traded under the Safeway brand, and Safeway's Food Barns in Queensland and New South Wales became part of Woolworths.\n\nAround this time, the supermarket chain had run eight small supermarket chains including the Queensland-based [[Food For Less]] and the Sydney-based Flemings, both of which survive.\n\nIn 1989, the company was acquired by [[Industrial Equity Limited]], which was in turn one-third owned by The [[Adelaide Steamship Company]], [[David Jones Limited]] and [[Tooth & Co]]. It was a wholly owned subsidiary until 1993, when it was floated in the biggest share sale (at that time) in Australia's history.\n\nIn 1996, Woolworths entered the petrol market, initially with wholly owned \"Plus Petrol\" outlets located in shopping centre parking lots. In 2003, as part of a loyalty program aimed at attracting customers to supermarkets through the lure of four cent a litre discounts, Woolworths entered into an agreement with Caltex to co-brand some Caltex outlets as [[Caltex Woolworths]]. These joint venture outlets are supplied with fuel by Caltex and with groceries by Woolworths, and accept Woolworths cards and discount dockets.\n\nIn 1999, Woolworths began a joint venture with the Commonwealth Bank called Woolworths Ezy Banking, but was scaled back by 2006. In 2005, the company reached an agreement with the ANZ Banking Group to install ATMs at Woolworths, Big W and Caltex Woolworths locations. Additionally, by 2008, it had invested in financial services infrastructure and expertise, building a team of 50 staff for this purpose.<ref name = \"AFR\">{{cite news| newspaper=Australian Financial Review |title=Retailers take on the banks\u2026again| date=30 January 2008|pages=1, 61| postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Woolworths opened its first Metro convenience store, in [[Sydney]], converting their premier multi-level variety store for 32 years to this format with the lower ground floor specialising in a large range of \u2018prepared meals\u2019 to cater for the increasing numbers of city dwellers. Known for its rainbow branding with the slogan \"Fine food without the fuss\", subsequent stores were opened in [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee]], [[Boronia Park]], [[West Pennant Hills]], [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]], [[Waterloo, New South Wales|Waterloo]] and its flagship Town Hall store in Sydney and [[Ascot, Queensland|Ascot]] in [[Brisbane]]. Currently the \"Woolworths Metro\" brand is used for smaller format convenience stores in the major cities and towns across Australia.\n\nWoolworths started to expand into liquor businesses with the acquisition of [[Dan Murphy's]] in 1998. By 2001, the [[Beer Wine Spirits|BWS]] chain had been established. With [[Queensland]] licensing laws dictating that retail outlets must be operated by a hotelier, Woolworths moved into the hotel industry in 2005 in a joint venture with experienced hotel operator Bruce Mathieson, purchasing hotelier Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group (ALH). Later in 2005 the ALH Group expanded its portfolio to 250 hotels by acquiring the Taverner Hotel Group and the Bruce Mathieson Group. The ALH Group is 25% owned by Bruce Mathieson and 75% owned by Woolworths. Statistics provided during the acquisition of the Taverner group showed that over one third of sales are made up of gaming/poker machine takings.<ref>[http://www.woolworthslimited.com.au/resources/taverners+analyst+presentation.pdf Woolworths Limited taverners analyst presentation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104051935/http://www.woolworthslimited.com.au/resources/taverners+analyst+presentation.pdf |date=4 January 2007 }}</ref> The number of poker machines owned by Woolworths and Bruce Mathieson after ALH acquisitions was 10,722.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/retail-giants-place-side-bet-on-pokies/2006/03/28/1143441151233.html \"Retail Giants Place Side Bet on Pokies\"], theage.com.au, 28 March 2006.</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the company had three major events: \n*in June it opened a buying office in Hong Kong to cut out the intermediary in sourcing foreign-produced items;\n*it announced a venture with the Tata Group in India to introduce Dick Smiths Electronics stores to that country;\n*in September it announced that it had taken a 10% strategic stake in [[The Warehouse Group]] in New Zealand.\n\nIn 2006, Woolworths rolled out new [[Retalix]] [[point of sale]] systems running on [[IBM]] POS hardware with [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] touchscreens throughout all its stores.<ref>{{cite web|title= Australia's Woolworths Meets Store Service Strategy with Retalix StoreLine|accessdate=14 October 2007|publisher=Internet Retailer|url=http://www.internetretailer.com/internet/marketing-conference/66458-australias-woolworths-meets-store-service-strategy-retalix-storeline.html}}</ref> These self-serve checkouts were initially trialled in [[Carlingford, New South Wales|Carlingford]], NSW.\n\nIn August 2007, Woolworths announced that it was planning to launch a general purpose credit card in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title= Now it's Woolworths the credit card people|date=27 August 2007|accessdate=6 September 2007|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/now-its-woolworths-the-credit-card-people/2007/08/27/1188067034518.html}}</ref>  It is expected to offer credit cardholders reward vouchers redeemable through its store network.<ref name = \"AFR\"/> [[HSBC]] was subsequently named as its credit card partner.<ref>{{cite news|title=Woolies way ahead at checkout |date=27 February 2008 |accessdate=27 February 2008 |publisher=Melbourne Herald Sun |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23282036-664,00.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229040918/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23282036-664,00.html |archivedate=29 February 2008 }}</ref> Woolworths subsequently announced that the ''Woolworths Everyday Money MasterCard'' would be launched on 26 August 2008 and allows customers to earn shopping cards redeemable at Woolworths group retailers.<ref>{{cite news|work=news.com.au|title=Woolworths launches new credit card|url=http://www.news.com.au/business/story/0,,24199187-462,00.html|date=18 August 2008|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Financial Informer|title=Woolies MasterCard debut|date=16 August 2008|accessdate=1 January 2015|url=http://www.financeinformer.com.au/woolies-mastercard-debut/}}</ref> It was suggested Woolworths could earn approximately $20m from credit cards in three years and that it was targeting 100,000 to 150,000 cardholders in the first year.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Australian Financial Review|title=Woolies makes move into credit cards|date=19 August 2008|page=13|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nInto 2008, a ''Wake Up Woolworths'' campaign, largely funded by the [[Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union]], was pushing Woolworths to sever its relationship with [[Asia Pulp & Paper]] over claims of deforestation of Indonesian rainforests.

Woolworth Company]] in the United States, the now-defunct [[Woolworths Group]] in the UK or the South African chain of retail stores, [[Woolworths Holdings Limited]]. Its main operations include supermarkets (under the [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]] brand in Australia and the [[Countdown (supermarket)|Countdown]] brand in New Zealand), liquor retailing (as [[BWS (liquor retailer)|BWS]] and [[Dan Murphy's]] in Australia), hotels and pubs under the Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group (ALH Group) umbrella, and discount department stores under the [[Big W]] name in Australia.\n\nThe company announced a loss of $1.235 billion for the 2016 financial year on 25 August 2016, the biggest in more than 20 years since it has been publicly listed on the [[Australian Securities Exchange|ASX]], mainly due to more than $2 billion in write-downs of the failed [[Masters Home Improvement|Masters]] business and losses in the [[Big W]] business.\n\n==History==<!-- This section is linked from [[Woolworth's]] -->\n[[File:Woolworths Building, George Street, Sydney.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Woolworths flagship store in the Sydney CBD]]\n{{For|a company listing|List of Woolworths Limited companies}}\nWoolworths opened its first store, the Woolworths Stupendous Bargain Basement, in the old Imperial Arcade [[Pitt Street]], [[Sydney]], where [[Westfield Sydney]] now stands, on 5 December 1924. Its nominal capital was just \u00a3185,000 and although 85,000 shares were offered to the public, only 81,707 shares were subscribed for by 619 people, including the five founders \u2013 Percy Christmas, Stanley Chatterton, Cecil Scott Waine, George Creed and Ernest Williams. One of the foundation investors was [[Preston Lanchester Gowing]], the then chairman of [[Gowings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esvc000089.wic034u.server-web.com/downloads/2002%20Annual%20Report.pdf |title=GOW372_Annual(pg1-14) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref> The name on the draft prospectus drawn up by Cecil Scott Waine was \"Wallworths Bazaar\" \u2013 a play on the [[F.W. Woolworth Company|F.W. Woolworth]] name (the owner of the Woolworth's chain in the United States and United Kingdom). Moreover, according to Ernest Robert Williams, Percy Christmas dared him to register the name Woolworths instead, which he succeeded in doing after finding out the name was available for use in [[New South Wales]]. Accordingly, Woolworths Ltd in Australia has no connection with the [[F.W. Woolworth Company]] in the United States, nor the [[Woolworths Group]] of UK. It also has no connection to the [[Woolworths (South Africa)|Woolworths Group in South Africa]].\n\nThe new Woolworths store was innovative; it was the first variety store in the world to use cash registers that print receipts for customers.\n\nChristmas set up a New Zealand general merchandise operation in Wellington in 1929. Woolworths New Zealand opened its first food store in Auckland in 1956, and supermarkets in 1971. Woolworths New Zealand was sold to the company that is now [[Lion Nathan]] in 1979, then sold to Dairy Farm International in 1990, now owned by [[Progressive Enterprises]], a subsidiary of Foodland Associated Limited of Australia. In 2005 Woolworths Limited and [[Metcash|Metcash Holdings]] agreed to purchase a demerged Foodland, and [[Progressive Enterprises]] and 23 of Foodland's [[Action (supermarket chain)|Action]] supermarkets came under Woolworths' ownership. This acquisition brought total store numbers in Australia to near 750.\n\nDuring the late 1920s, the company grew, with a second store in Sydney and stores in [[Brisbane]] and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. It grew further in the 1930s, despite the depression, until by the end of 1933 it had 23 stores. In 1933 the first store in [[Melbourne]] was opened. On 1 April 1936 the company bought eight stores from Edments Ltd and opened its first store in [[Adelaide]]. The original Imperial Arcade store was moved to larger premises in Her Majesty's Arcade, a short distance along Pitt Street near the Market Street corner.\n\n[[World War II]] slowed the growth of Woolworths and the Australian and United States military used Woolworths' warehouses in Sydney for storage. After the war expansion was rapid and in 1955 Woolworths opened its 200th store, in the Civic Centre in [[Canberra]] (since closed). At this point Woolworths was still mainly a variety chain and had not moved into the food sector that uses the \"Woolworths\" brand today. This move began in 1955 when it opened its first supermarket at [[Beverly Hills, Sydney|Beverly Hills]], south-west of Sydney. The company bought the Rockmans chain of women's clothing stores in 1960.\n\nIn the 1970s, the company started to open Big W discount department stores and the slow removal of many variety products from the supermarket and variety stores began. This process finished in 1989 when the last of the Woolworths Variety stores was closed (except the one in [[Rundle Mall]]) and the \"Family Centres\" were split into separate Big W and Woolworths supermarket stores. Woolworths acquired the [[Dick Smith (retailer)|Dick Smith Electronics]] consumer electronics chain in 1981 and expanded the consumer electronics arm of its business with the purchase of the Tandy chain in Australia from InterTan Inc in 2001. The company sold the Rockmans chain in 2000, and the Dick Smith Electronics chain in 2012.\n\nIn 1985, the acquisition of the 126 Safeway stores in eastern Australia made Woolworths the largest food retailer in Australia. Safeway stores were in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland and included Food Barns in Queensland and northern New South Wales. The stores were acquired following an agreement whereby [[Safeway Stores Inc.|Safeway]] acquired a 19.99% interest in Woolworths Limited. Woolworths and Safeway supermarkets in Victoria traded under the Safeway brand, and Safeway's Food Barns in Queensland and New South Wales became part of Woolworths.\n\nAround this time, the supermarket chain had run eight small supermarket chains including the Queensland-based [[Food For Less]] and the Sydney-based Flemings, both of which survive.\n\nIn 1989, the company was acquired by [[Industrial Equity Limited]], which was in turn one-third owned by The [[Adelaide Steamship Company]], [[David Jones Limited]] and [[Tooth & Co]]. It was a wholly owned subsidiary until 1993, when it was floated in the biggest share sale (at that time) in Australia's history.\n\nIn 1996, Woolworths entered the petrol market, initially with wholly owned \"Plus Petrol\" outlets located in shopping centre parking lots. In 2003, as part of a loyalty program aimed at attracting customers to supermarkets through the lure of four cent a litre discounts, Woolworths entered into an agreement with Caltex to co-brand some Caltex outlets as [[Caltex Woolworths]]. These joint venture outlets are supplied with fuel by Caltex and with groceries by Woolworths, and accept Woolworths cards and discount dockets.\n\nIn 1999, Woolworths began a joint venture with the Commonwealth Bank called Woolworths Ezy Banking, but was scaled back by 2006. In 2005, the company reached an agreement with the ANZ Banking Group to install ATMs at Woolworths, Big W and Caltex Woolworths locations. Additionally, by 2008, it had invested in financial services infrastructure and expertise, building a team of 50 staff for this purpose.<ref name = \"AFR\">{{cite news| newspaper=Australian Financial Review |title=Retailers take on the banks\u2026again| date=30 January 2008|pages=1, 61| postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Woolworths opened its first Metro convenience store, in [[Sydney]], converting their premier multi-level variety store for 32 years to this format with the lower ground floor specialising in a large range of \u2018prepared meals\u2019 to cater for the increasing numbers of city dwellers. Known for its rainbow branding with the slogan \"Fine food without the fuss\", subsequent stores were opened in [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee]], [[Boronia Park]], [[West Pennant Hills]], [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]], [[Waterloo, New South Wales|Waterloo]] and its flagship Town Hall store in Sydney and [[Ascot, Queensland|Ascot]] in [[Brisbane]]. Currently the \"Woolworths Metro\" brand is used for smaller format convenience stores in the major cities and towns across Australia.\n\nWoolworths started to expand into liquor businesses with the acquisition of [[Dan Murphy's]] in 1998. By 2001, the [[Beer Wine Spirits|BWS]] chain had been established. With [[Queensland]] licensing laws dictating that retail outlets must be operated by a hotelier, Woolworths moved into the hotel industry in 2005 in a joint venture with experienced hotel operator Bruce Mathieson, purchasing hotelier Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group (ALH). Later in 2005 the ALH Group expanded its portfolio to 250 hotels by acquiring the Taverner Hotel Group and the Bruce Mathieson Group. The ALH Group is 25% owned by Bruce Mathieson and 75% owned by Woolworths. Statistics provided during the acquisition of the Taverner group showed that over one third of sales are made up of gaming/poker machine takings.<ref>[http://www.woolworthslimited.com.au/resources/taverners+analyst+presentation.pdf Woolworths Limited taverners analyst presentation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104051935/http://www.woolworthslimited.com.au/resources/taverners+analyst+presentation.pdf |date=4 January 2007 }}</ref> The number of poker machines owned by Woolworths and Bruce Mathieson after ALH acquisitions was 10,722.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/retail-giants-place-side-bet-on-pokies/2006/03/28/1143441151233.html \"Retail Giants Place Side Bet on Pokies\"], theage.com.au, 28 March 2006.</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the company had three major events: \n*in June it opened a buying office in Hong Kong to cut out the intermediary in sourcing foreign-produced items;\n*it announced a venture with the Tata Group in India to introduce Dick Smiths Electronics stores to that country;\n*in September it announced that it had taken a 10% strategic stake in [[The Warehouse Group]] in New Zealand.\n\nIn 2006, Woolworths rolled out new [[Retalix]] [[point of sale]] systems running on [[IBM]] POS hardware with [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] touchscreens throughout all its stores.<ref>{{cite web|title= Australia's Woolworths Meets Store Service Strategy with Retalix StoreLine|accessdate=14 October 2007|publisher=Internet Retailer|url=http://www.internetretailer.com/internet/marketing-conference/66458-australias-woolworths-meets-store-service-strategy-retalix-storeline.html}}</ref> These self-serve checkouts were initially trialled in [[Carlingford, New South Wales|Carlingford]], NSW.\n\nIn August 2007, Woolworths announced that it was planning to launch a general purpose credit card in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title= Now it's Woolworths the credit card people|date=27 August 2007|accessdate=6 September 2007|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/now-its-woolworths-the-credit-card-people/2007/08/27/1188067034518.html}}</ref>  It is expected to offer credit cardholders reward vouchers redeemable through its store network.<ref name = \"AFR\"/> [[HSBC]] was subsequently named as its credit card partner.<ref>{{cite news|title=Woolies way ahead at checkout |date=27 February 2008 |accessdate=27 February 2008 |publisher=Melbourne Herald Sun |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23282036-664,00.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229040918/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23282036-664,00.html |archivedate=29 February 2008 }}</ref> Woolworths subsequently announced that the ''Woolworths Everyday Money MasterCard'' would be launched on 26 August 2008 and allows customers to earn shopping cards redeemable at Woolworths group retailers.<ref>{{cite news|work=news.com.au|title=Woolworths launches new credit card|url=http://www.news.com.au/business/story/0,,24199187-462,00.html|date=18 August 2008|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Financial Informer|title=Woolies MasterCard debut|date=16 August 2008|accessdate=1 January 2015|url=http://www.financeinformer.com.au/woolies-mastercard-debut/}}</ref> It was suggested Woolworths could earn approximately $20m from credit cards in three years and that it was targeting 100,000 to 150,000 cardholders in the first year.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Australian Financial Review|title=Woolies makes move into credit cards|date=19 August 2008|page=13|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nInto 2008, a ''Wake Up Woolworths'' campaign, largely funded by the [[Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union]], was pushing Woolworths to sever its relationship with [[Asia Pulp & Paper]] over claims of deforestation of Indonesian rainforests.
