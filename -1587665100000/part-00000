These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires. Drawings and writings of children of the Spanish War were the result of a contest organized by Alfred Brauner among the children of Barcelona in 1938 on three themes: \"My life Before the War\", \"What I Saw from the War\" and \"How I See My Life after the War\".<ref name=thesis/> It was then the beginning of their work on \"children who have lived through the war.\" 4000 drawings of refugee children and numerous essays were collected in Spain, which later, along with other drawings of children in war, offered a unique testimony of the conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of children.<ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 =Ibarz Serrat  | first1 = Virgilio  | authorlink = | title = Los dibujos infantiles de la guerra 1937-1938: el caso de la ni\u00f1a de Ballobar | doi = | journal = Diario del AltoArag\u00f3n | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2009  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Their project to publish drawings and testimonies of children in war received the support of [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Romain Rolland]] who \"regarded this collection as of considerable educational, historical and human interest.\"<ref name=\"Yannick Ripa\"/>\n \nIn 1939, Alfred Brauner welcomed 130 Jewish children from the Palatinate, Berlin and Austria,<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> survivors of the [[Kristallnacht]] at La Guette, a French castle owned by the Rothschild family and made available by [[Baroness Germaine de Rothschild]].<ref name=\"La Guette\">{{Cite web|url= http://www.ajpn.org/sauvetage-Chateau-de-la-Guette-245.html |title= Ch\u00e2teau de la Guette durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale (WWII) |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= www.ajpn.org/index.php | publisher= }}</ref><ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Lochy  | first1 = Emilie | authorlink = | title = Extrait de l'ouvrage : Enfances en guerre - T\u00e9moignages d'enfants sur la guerre | doi = | journal = Le Cercle Psy | volume = 12  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2014 | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Alfred\u2019s  intention was to analyze the problems posed in working with children traumatized by their experiences and by separation from their families, with the aim of adapting them to a new life and preparing them for integration into France.<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> He then described this educational experience in his state thesis, defended in 1946, entitled \"The Psychic Repercussions of Modern War on Childhood.\"<ref name=thesis/>\n \nFrom January 1941, Alfred Brauner entered the [[French Resistance]] and welcomed the [[Austrian resistance]]\u2019s leadership in his [[Rue Bonaparte]] apartment in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> With members of the [[\u00d6sterreichische Freiheitsfront]] arriving every morning at a specific time, Alfred Brauner decided to open a German Language course as a cover from [[Gestapo]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/> In 1945, he helped welcoming and educating 444 surviving boys from the [[Auschwitz]] and [[Buchenwald]] [[concentration camps]], in the scope of the [[Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants]] (OSE) in [[Ecouis]], [[France]].<ref name=\"Boltanski\">{{cite book | author = Christophe Boltanski | title = La Cache | page= | publisher = Stock | year = 2015  | isbn = 978-2-234-07637-2}}</ref><ref name=\"L'accueil\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> This welcoming of Buchenwald's child survivors in children's homes inspired the script of the film [[Nina's House]],<ref name=\" \">{{Cite web|url= https://jeudisducinema.be/La-maison-de-Nina |title= La maison de Nina |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= jeudisducinema.be/ | publisher=Les jeudis du cinema }}</ref> as well as the documentary [[The Boys of Buchenwald]].\n \nIn 1950, Alfred Brauner created the \"Practical Research for Children,\" which brings together professionals of childhood in order to develop medico-pedagogical methods intended for the education of children with mental disabilities.<ref name=\"Mintec\"/> In 1955, he founded a day hospital for mentally and physically handicapped children located in the center of Paris, then transferred to Saint-Mand\u00e9, and worked on the rehabilitation of these children, giving priority to their education.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> Alfred Brauner was the ambassador of the association \"''Children Refugees of the World,''\" as well as the only non-physician president of the ''Society of Expression Psychopathology and Art Therapy''.<ref name=\"SFPE\">{{Cite web|url= https://www.sfpe-art-therapie.fr/Quelques-dates-qui-marquent-les-avancees-sur-trois-voies-paralleles_a34.html |title= Quelques dates qui marquent les avanc\u00e9es sur trois voies parall\u00e8les.

After the war, a dispute over opening Kekon to international trade led to the One Mountain Society disintegrating into a number of rival clans, with the most powerful being the isolationist Mountain clan led by the Ayt family and the internationalist No Peak clan led by the Kaul family.\n\nThe organization of the clans is similar to the crime families in ''The Godfather'', in which the Corleone family has a [[Crime boss|don]], [[underboss]] and ''[[consigliere]]''; the clans each have a Pillar, Horn and Weather Man. The Pillar is the head of the clan, the Horn leads its street fighters and the Weather Man is responsible for business activities.\n\nThe Horn oversees the clan's Fists, who each command a number of Fingers, similar to [[Caporegime]]s and [[Soldato|soldier]]s in the [[American Mafia]]. Unlike in the Mafia, the Weather Man manages an office in the business district, staffed by clan members known as Luckbringers.\n\nOutside of the family but still part of the clan are the Lantern Men, business owners who were civilian accomplices in the liberation movement. After the war they began to pay financial tribute to the clans in return for [[Protection racket|protection]] from criminal gangs of untrained jade users.\n\nClan members who wear jade are known as Green Bones. They are governed by the aisho honor code, which prevents them from killing unjaded family members of their enemies except in very specific circumstances (clan informants who wear no jade are known as White Rats, and can be killed without violating aisho).\n\n===Jade===\n\nKekon contains the world's only supply of jade, a mineral that endows its wearer with enhanced abilities. Safe use of jade requires a combination of genetic predisposition and intense training in the six disciplines of Strength, Steel, Perception, Lightness, Deflection and Channelling.\n\nBefore writing ''Jade City'', Lee received an MBA from Stanford, worked as a business strategist and wrote science fiction novels.<ref name=\"LeeLocus\">{{cite web |url=https://locusmag.com/2018/07/fonda-lee-when-the-alien-invaders-win/ |title=Fonda Lee: When the Alien Invaders Win |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=July 16, 2018 }}</ref> She has stated that she \"[treats] the magic almost in a science fictional way\" and as \"a way to have the international trade and politics play out in the storyline.\"<ref name=\"InkToFilm 68\">{{cite podcast |title=Ep-68 The Godfather part II (1974 film) ft.

The aboriginal population of Kekon, the Abukei, are completely immune to its effects, while individuals from outside Kekon are too sensitive to it. Only the Kekonese, with mixed aboriginal and settler ancestry, have the necessary combination of resistance and sensitivity to be able to use it long-term, although there are wide variations in jade ability among the population, for reasons not well understood. In addition, some Kekonese are born with a recessive genetic trait that makes them immune to jade. These individuals are known as \"stone-eyes\", and are considered unlucky by other Kekonese. Lee has commented that she tied jade ability to a combination of genetics and luck as \"a way to subvert that trope of the blood talent... the chosen ones.\"<ref name=\"InkToFilm 68\" />\n\nKekonese jade users have to spend years in training at the clan academies to use it safely. Overexposure to jade leads to The Itches, a condition causing madness and eventual death. Jade tolerance can also be increased through injections of a drug called SN1 or \"shine.\" Shine is used as a medicine to treat Green Bones, and in addition is traded on the black market and used illicitly by Kekonese who want to wear jade but who do not have academy training. It is also used outside Kekon to facilitate military use of jade by non-Kekonese troops.\n\nUse and production of Jade on Kekon is governed by various traditions and institutions. Green Bones are entitled to claim the jade from enemies they kill in combat. Jade use is supposed to be kept out of government, so members of the Royal Council of Kekon, a representative assembly with lawmaking powers, are banned from wearing it. Jade mining is overseen by the Kekon Jade Alliance (KJA), a private business consortium whose shares are split between the clans. The KJA makes allocations of jade to various organizations including the temples of Deitism, Kekon's main religion, where it is used in rituals.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===No Peak clan===\n\n* '''Lan''' (Kaul Lanshinwan): The recently-anointed Pillar, inheriting the role from his grandfather Kaul Sen. Lan's wife recently left him for another man, causing him to lose face in Kekon and affecting his confidence in his abilities. Despite this, he strives to be a strong leader for the clan.\n\n* '''Hilo''' (Kaul Hiloshudon): Horn and brother of the Pillar, a big-hearted, hot-headed street fighter who commands absolute loyalty from his subordinates.\n\n* '''Shae''' (Kaul Shaelinsan): The third Kaul sibling, Shae holds no position in the clan and wears no jade by choice, despite having completed her training at the Academy. After the breakup of her relationship with a non-Kekonese soldier, Shae returns to Kekon looking for a job outside the clan where she can put her foreign education to use.\n\n* '''Kaul Sen''' (Kaul Seningtun): Original clan Pillar, known as the Torch of Kekon for his actions during the battle for independence. Now retired and slipping into dementia, he is a shadow of the man he once was.\n\n* '''Kaul Wan Ria''' (Kaul Wan Riamasan) Daughter-in-law of Kaul Sen and mother of the Kaul siblings. Her husband died in the war and she takes no part in clan affairs.\n\n* '''Doru''' (Yun Dorupon): The aged, calculating Weather Man of No Peak, increasingly at odds with the younger generation now in charge of the clan.\n\n* '''Anden''' (Emery Anden): Adopted grandson of Kaul Sen, he is in his final year as a student at the Academy.\n\n* '''Wen''' (Maik Wenruxian): Sister of two prominent Fists of the No Peak clan, she is in a relationship with Hilo. She is a stone-eye.\n\n===Mountain clan===\n\n* '''Ayt Mada''' (Ayt Madashi): Ruthless Pillar who inherited the role by murdering the other contenders when her adoptive father Ayt Yugontin, the Spear of Kekon, died.\n\n* '''Gont Asch''' (Gont Aschentu): Fearsome, brutish Horn whose physical prowess masks hidden cunning.\n\n* '''Ree Tura''' (Ree Turahuo): Weather Man. Nearing retirement, he is not well-regarded by the Pillar or Horn.\n\n===Unaffiliated===\n\n* '''Bero''': A minor street thief. Despite being untrained, he has ambitions to wear jade and doesn't mind how he gets it.\n\n* '''Mudt''' (Mudt Jindonon): A smuggler and informant who sells Bero's stolen merchandise through his discount goods store.\n\n==Plot==\n\nBero, a minor thief, attempts to steal jade from a No Peak Fist while he is dining in a clan-affiliated restaurant, but Bero and his Abukei accomplice Sampa are quickly caught and brought to Hilo for punishment. After they are beaten, a remark by Sampa about a recent murder in clan territory leads Hilo to take the two boys to be questioned in the presence of his brother Lan, the clan Pillar.\n\nHilo attempts to convince Lan that the Mountain clan is squeezing No Peak territory, but he is opposed by Doru the Weather Man, who suggests it is a misunderstanding and counsels a peaceful solution. Feeling frustrated and unsupported by Doru, Lan asks his grandfather for permission to replace him as Weather Man, but Kaul Sen refuses to allow it. A short time after this, Shae returns to Kekon, looking for a job that will not require her to wear jade.\n\nThe Mountain comes close to violating aisho by kidnapping Anden, who is still in his final year at the Academy. Ayt Mada offers Anden a position in her clan, signalling that she wishes to unite the Mountain and No Peak. Her purpose is partially to send a message that she considers Hilo an unsuitable Horn.\n\nOnce Anden has been returned safely, Lan begins to move against the Mountain. He proposes a new law preventing any one clan from gaining control of the Kekon Jade Alliance, and he sends Shae to audit the KJA's accounts, looking for irregularities.\n\nTheir message to Anden having been disregarded, the Mountain makes an attempt on Hilo's life. In retaliation, No Peak threatens to storm their training complex. To prevent this, the Mountain apologizes, gives up the would-be assassins and makes a territorial concession. The more senior of the assassins offers Lan a clean blade, demanding to be killed in combat. Believing that he needs to prove himself to the clan in order to remain Pillar, Lan accepts and wins the duel, but only barely.\n\nIn the aftermath, Hilo asks his brother for permission to marry his girlfriend Wen, and Lan, despite misgivings about his brother marrying a stone-eye from a disreputable family, gives his permission.\n\nLan has been injured in the duel and his jade tolerance has been affected, but he cannot be seen to show weakness by failing to wear the additional jade he has won. He arranges for Anden to bring him packages of shine. When Anden realizes what he is delivering he pleads with Lan to stop using the drug, but Lan swears him to secrecy. When Shae comes to see Anden he tries to tell her about the shine, but misses his opportunity.\n\nShae reports to Lan that someone in the KJA is skimming jade, and that either Doru doesn't know about it and is incompetent, or he is allowing it to happen. Lan sends Doru overseas to get him out of the way and tells his allies on the Royal Council that he is going to suspend jade production. Lan receives a letter from his estranged wife, but can't bring himself to open it.\n\nMeanwhile Bero has been stealing shipments from the Docks. Through his fence he meets a mysterious Mountain Green Bone, who gives Bero a submachine gun and tells him to use it to shoot up the gentleman's club Lan frequents. Lan accidentally takes an overdose of shine while visiting the club, and when Bero attacks him he falls into the sea and drowns.\n\nWhen Shae hears about his death she immediately goes to the bank where her jade is kept and puts it all back on. Hilo is now Pillar and she persuades him to strike back by reclaiming some disputed territory rather than launching an all-out attack on the Mountain. She takes part in the battle, fighting several Mountain Green Bones and killing two. Afterward, Hilo asks her to become his Weather Man and she agrees. She cements her position by gaining the support of her main rivals for the role, and she spares Doru's life on condition that he gives up his jade, renounces clan business and spends his remaining days as a companion for her grandfather.\n\nThe clans are now in a state of open war. Shae and Hilo attend negotiations with Ayt Mada and her Weather Man until Hilo accuses the Mountain of skimming jade from the KJA and supplying it to non-Green Bones, then storms out. Ayt arranges to meet Shae on safe ground and tries to talk her into betraying No Peak, but Shae refuses, knowing that she is putting her life in serious jeopardy by doing so. She tells Hilo that No Peak can only hold out for another six months.\n\nWen asks Shae to make her a spy for the clan, without Hilo's knowledge. Shae sends her to a foreign military base with a shipment of jade worth millions, re-establishing the supply that has been disrupted by the KJA's suspension of jade production.\n\nKaul Sen gives his jade to Doru, and Doru uses it to attack his guards and escape, defecting to the Mountain with all his knowledge of No Peak's business dealings. The Mountain continues to use its superior position to maim and kill No Peak Green Bones. On New Year's Day, Hilo marries Wen, then has Anden drive him into Mountain territory to be killed in combat, in return for clemency for the remaining No Peak clan members. Hilo kills several Green Bones but is overwhelmed. When Gont Asch steps in to finish him, Hilo and Anden together kill the Horn of the Mountain.\n\nThe fight leaves Anden in a coma. When he regains consciousness, he learns that the loss of its Horn has dealt the Mountain a serious blow and given No Peak a temporary advantage in the war. Anden returns to the Academy for his graduation ceremony, but when he is presented with his jade he declares he does not want to be a Green Bone. He tells Hilo he does not want a life of violence, and when the Pillar rebukes him Anden runs from the Academy to Lan's grave.\n\nLater, under cover of darkness, Bero also visits the grave. He is still looking for jade, and in the former Pillar's coffin there is a generous supply.\n\n==Reception==\n''Jade City'' won the 2018 [[World Fantasy Award\u2014Novel|World Fantasy Award]] (tied with [[Victor LaValle|Victor LaValle's]] ''The Changeling'') and the [[Aurora Award for Best Novel|Aurora Award]], and was a finalist for the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel|Nebula]] and [[Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel|Locus Awards]].\n\n''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called the novel \"an engaging blend of crime drama and Asian martial arts film tropes\"<ref name=\"PublishersWeekly\">{{cite web |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-316-44086-8 |title=Fiction Book Review: Jade City by Fonda Lee |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=September 8, 2017 |website=[[Publishers Weekly]]}}</ref> and it received a starred review from [[Library Journal]].<ref name=\"LibraryJournal\">{{cite web |url=https://www.libraryjournal.com/?reviewDetail=jade-city |title=Jade City |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=October 15, 2017 |publisher=[[Library Journal]]}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{World Fantasy Award Best Novel}}\n\n[[Category:2017 American novels]]\n[[Category:2017 fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:World Fantasy Award for Best Novel-winning works]]\n", "text_old": "{{infobox book | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name          = Jade City\n| image         = JadeCity.jpg\n| caption       = Softcover edition\n| author        = [[Fonda Lee]]\n| language      = English\n| genre         = [[Fantasy]]\n| publisher     = [[Orbit Books|Orbit]]\n| release_date  = November 7, 2017\n| media_type    = Print, e-book\n| pages         = 560\n| awards        = [[World Fantasy Award\u2014Novel|World Fantasy Award]] (2018)\n| isbn          = 978-0316440882\n| series        = [[Green Bone Saga]]\n| followed_by   = [[Jade War]]\n}}\n\n'''''Jade City''''' is a 2017 [[Gangster film|gangster]] [[fantasy]] novel by [[Fonda Lee]].<ref name=\"Lee2017\">{{cite book | last = Lee | first = Fonda | title = Jade city | publisher = Orbit/Hachette Book Group | location = New York, NY | year = 2017 | isbn = 9780316440882 }}</ref> It won the [[World Fantasy Award]] in 2018<ref name=\"WFA2018\">{{cite web |url=https://www.tor.com/2018/11/04/announcing-the-2018-world-fantasy-award-winners/ |title=Announcing the 2018 World Fantasy Award Winners |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=November 4, 2018 |website=tor.com |access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref> and is the first in the Green Bone Saga trilogy.\n\n==Setting and inspiration==\nLee describes the novel as \"[[The Godfather (novel)|''The Godfather'']] with magic and kung fu\"<ref name=\"LeeReddit\">{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/7g4voa/im_fonda_lee_author_of_jade_city_ask_me_anything/ |title=I'm Fonda Lee, author of JADE CITY.

A short time after this, Shae returns to Kekon, looking for a job that will not require her to wear jade.\n\nThe Mountain comes close to violating aisho by kidnapping Anden, who is still in his final year at the Academy. Ayt Mada offers Anden a position in her clan, signalling that she wishes to unite the Mountain and No Peak. Her purpose is partially to send a message that she considers Hilo an unsuitable Horn.\n\nOnce Anden has been returned safely, Lan begins to move against the Mountain. He proposes a new law preventing any one clan from gaining control of the Kekon Jade Alliance, and he sends Shae to audit the KJA's accounts, looking for irregularities.\n\nTheir message to Anden having been disregarded, the Mountain makes an attempt on Hilo's life. In retaliation, No Peak threatens to storm their training complex. To prevent this, the Mountain apologizes, gives up the would-be assassins and makes a territorial concession. The more senior of the assassins offers Lan a clean blade, demanding to be killed in combat. Believing that he needs to prove himself to the clan in order to remain Pillar, Lan accepts and wins the duel, but only barely.\n\nIn the aftermath, Hilo asks his brother for permission to marry his girlfriend Wen, and Lan, despite misgivings about his brother marrying a stone-eye from a disreputable family, gives his permission.\n\nLan has been injured in the duel and his jade tolerance has been affected, but he cannot be seen to show weakness by failing to wear the additional jade he has won. He arranges for Anden to bring him packages of shine. When Anden realizes what he is delivering he pleads with Lan to stop using the drug, but Lan swears him to secrecy. When Shae comes to see Anden he tries to tell her about the shine, but misses his opportunity.\n\nShae reports to Lan that someone in the KJA is skimming jade, and that either Doru doesn't know about it and is incompetent, or he is allowing it to happen. Lan sends Doru overseas to get him out of the way and tells his allies on the Royal Council that he is going to suspend jade production. Lan receives a letter from his estranged wife, but can't bring himself to open it.\n\nMeanwhile Bero has been stealing shipments from the Docks. Through his fence he meets a mysterious Mountain Green Bone, who gives Bero a submachine gun and tells him to use it to shoot up the gentleman's club Lan frequents. Lan accidentally takes an overdose of shine while visiting the club, and when Bero attacks him he falls into the sea and drowns.\n\nWhen Shae hears about his death she immediately goes to the bank where her jade is kept and puts it all back on. Hilo is now Pillar and she persuades him to strike back by reclaiming some disputed territory rather than launching an all-out attack on the Mountain. She takes part in the battle, fighting several Mountain Green Bones and killing two. Afterward, Hilo asks her to become his Weather Man and she agrees. She cements her position by gaining the support of her main rivals for the role, and she spares Doru's life on condition that he gives up his jade, renounces clan business and spends his remaining days as a companion for her grandfather.\n\nThe clans are now in a state of open war. Shae and Hilo attend negotiations with Ayt Mada and her Weather Man until Hilo accuses the Mountain of skimming jade from the KJA and supplying it to non-Green Bones, then storms out. Ayt arranges to meet Shae on safe ground and tries to talk her into betraying No Peak, but Shae refuses, knowing that she is putting her life in serious jeopardy by doing so. She tells Hilo that No Peak can only hold out for another six months.\n\nWen asks Shae to make her a spy for the clan, without Hilo's knowledge. Shae sends her to a foreign military base with a shipment of jade worth millions, re-establishing the supply that has been disrupted by the KJA's suspension of jade production.\n\nKaul Sen gives his jade to Doru, and Doru uses it to attack his guards and escape, defecting to the Mountain with all his knowledge of No Peak's business dealings. The Mountain continues to use its superior position to maim and kill No Peak Green Bones. On New Year's Day, Hilo marries Wen, then has Anden drive him into Mountain territory to be killed in combat, in return for clemency for the remaining No Peak clan members. Hilo kills several Green Bones but is overwhelmed. When Gont Asch steps in to finish him, Hilo and Anden together kill the Horn of the Mountain.\n\nThe fight leaves Anden in a coma. When he regains consciousness, he learns that the loss of its Horn has dealt the Mountain a serious blow and given No Peak a temporary advantage in the war. Anden returns to the Academy for his graduation ceremony, but when he is presented with his jade he declares he does not want to be a Green Bone. He tells Hilo he does not want a life of violence, and when the Pillar rebukes him Anden runs from the Academy to Lan's grave.\n\nLater, under cover of darkness, Bero also visits the grave. He is still looking for jade, and in the former Pillar's coffin there is a generous supply.\n\n==Reception==\n''Jade City'' won the 2018 [[World Fantasy Award\u2014Novel|World Fantasy Award]] (tied with [[Victor LaValle|Victor LaValle's]] ''The Changeling'') and the [[Aurora Award for Best Novel|Aurora Award]], and was a finalist for the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel|Nebula]] and [[Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel|Locus Awards]].\n\n''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called the novel \"an engaging blend of crime drama and Asian martial arts film tropes\"<ref name=\"PublishersWeekly\">{{cite web |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-316-44086-8 |title=Fiction Book Review: Jade City by Fonda Lee |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=September 8, 2017 |website=[[Publishers Weekly]]}}</ref> and it received a starred review from [[Library Journal]].<ref name=\"LibraryJournal\">{{cite web |url=https://www.libraryjournal.com/?reviewDetail=jade-city |title=Jade City |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=October 15, 2017 |publisher=[[Library Journal]]}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{World Fantasy Award Best Novel}}\n\n[[Category:2017 American novels]]\n[[Category:2017 fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:World Fantasy Award for Best Novel-winning works]]\n", "name_user": "Julietdeltalima", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eClans:WP:TWWPK", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_City_(novel)"}

Mojang and Microsoft provide little official support for this (for example, the game provides no modding API for Java, although Mojang does provide methods for deobfuscating the game), but the EULA permits non-commercial mods.\n\nModding to the mobile and console versions of ''Minecraft'' on the [[Minecraft#Pocket/Bedrock Edition|Bedrock codebase]] are different, because that iteration of the game is written in C++ rather than Java.<ref name=\"ViceModding\" /> Players who wish to mod their game on Bedrock codebase versions have a simpler process, due to the version's built-in official support for \"add-ons\", which can be installed faster than ''Java Edition'' mods, and require no external mod loaders.\n\n== History ==\nAlthough the first version of ''Minecraft'' was released in May 2009,<ref name=\"PcGamerFirstMoments\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-first-moments-of-minecraft/ |title=The First Moments of Minecraft |last=Smith |first=Graham |date=6 February 2012 |website=PC Gamer |publisher=Future plc |access-date=12 February 2016}}</ref> client-side modding of the game did not become popular in earnest until the game reached its [[Software release life cycle#Alpha|alpha stage]] in June 2010. The only mods that were released during ''Minecraft''{{'s}} Indev and Infdev development stages were a few client-side mods which had minor changes to the game.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the release of Alpha, the first server-side mods began to appear.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} One of them was hMod, which added some simple but necessary tools to manage a server.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} Michael Stoyke, also known as Searge who would later go on to work for Mojang, created Minecraft Coder Pack (MCP), which was later renamed to Mod Coder Pack, keeping the same acronym. MCP was a tool which decompiled and deobfuscated ''Minecraft'' code. MCP would recompile and reobfuscate new and changed classes, which can be injected into the game. But, if multiple mods modified the same base code, it would conflict. To solve this problem, Risugami's Modloader was created; Modloader prevented any conflict occurring due to multiple mods modifying the same base classes or game resources.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nTowards the end of 2010, new mods were released which featured more content than previous ones. ''Minecraft'' was now preparing to move into its [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta development phase]], and popular mods such as ''IndustrialCraft'', ''Railcraft'' and ''BuildCraft'' were first released. As opposed to their predecessors, these mods had the potential to change the entire game instead of simply tweaking minor aspects of it.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> Bukkit, a server-side mod intended to replace hMod was also released during this time. CraftBukkit, a server software which implemented the Bukkit API was also released. Bukkit allowed server owners to install plug-ins which modified the server's way of taking input and giving output to the player without players having to install client-side mods.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nAround November 2011, the Forge Mod Loader and Minecraft Forge were released. Forge allowed players to be able to run several mods simultaneously. Forge utilized MCP mappings. Forge also released a server version of  Forge, which allowed mods to be run on servers, which eventually led to people creating modded servers. Forge ended the necessity to manipulate the base source code, allowing separate mods to run together without requiring them to touch the base source code.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> Forge also included many libraries and hooks which made mod development easier.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:@jeb talking at the modders panel @ MineCon 2012.jpg|thumb|In 2012, Mojang organized a panel on modding at [[MineCon#2012|MineCon 2012]], where ''Minecraft''{{'s}} lead developer [[Jens Bergensten]] held a talk.]]\nAfter ''Minecraft'' was fully released in November 2011, the game's modding community continued to grow.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> In February 2012, Mojang hired developers of the Bukkit to work on an official modding [[Application programming interface|API]], allowing mod developers easier access to the ''Minecraft'' game files.<ref name=\"ModdingAPIEurogamer\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-29-mojang-hires-bukkit-server-mod-team-to-make-official-minecraft-api |title=Mojang hires Bukkit server-mod team to make official Minecraft API |last=Purchese |first=Robert |date=29 February 2012 |website=Eurogamer |publisher=Gamer Network |access-date=13 February 2016}}</ref> Bukkit was then maintained by the community. A fork of CraftBukkit, called Spigot which was backward compatible with plugins was also in development. An Alternative to forge named Liteloader was released. Liteloader made modding very simple and promoted adding new content instead of modifying existing content. Like forge, Liteloader also used MCP mappings.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 2013, Forge Mod Loader soon replaced Risugami's Modloader as Modloader wasn't being updated in time by its developers.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} In early 2014, a new server software named Sponge, which had a very powerful plugin API compared to Bukkit, and was also compatible with running Forge mods was released. Sponge also introduced [[mixin]]s, an alternatively to modifying byte code. Soon, Liteloader implemented mixins into their API allowing developers to modify in-game content.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn mid-2014, Spigot released a server software made to link many servers together. The project was called BungeeCord, and had a separate plugin API from spigot and spigot plugins could work side by side with BungeeCord. Many popular Minecraft servers use BungeeCord to link up Minecraft servers together.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} PaperMC also released a modified version of BungeeCord called Waterfall, which included optimizations that were not present in Spigot.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nConcern arose following Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang in late 2014. Members of the modding community feared that ''Minecraft''{{'}}s new American owners would put an end to Mojang's established practice of giving free rein to mod developers.<ref name=\"BloombergEdu\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-19/microsoft-turns-a-minecraft-mod-into-an-education-business |title=Microsoft Turns a Minecraft Mod Into an Education Business |last=Brustein |first=Joshua |date=19 January 2016 |website=Bloomberg L.P. |publisher=Bloomberg |access-date=13 February 2016}}</ref> Despite the concerns, Microsoft did not announce any changes to Mojang's policies, and modding was unaffected.<ref name=\"BloombergEdu\" />\n\nIn April 2015, Microsoft announced that it was adding a ''Minecraft'' Mod Developer Pack to [[Microsoft Visual Studio]], granting users of the application creation software an easier way to program ''Minecraft'' mods.<ref name=\"GeekVisualStudio\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.geek.com/microsoft/microsoft-embraces-minecraft-modding-with-new-visual-studio-tools-1621890/ |title=Microsoft embraces Minecraft modding with new Visual Studio tools |last=Mathews |first=Lee |date=1 May 2015 |website=Geek.com |publisher=Ziff Davis Media |access-date=13 February 2016}}</ref> Microsoft released the new pack open source and free of charge, amidst a drive to push towards more open source software.<ref name=\"GeekVisualStudio\" /><ref name=\"MicrosoftOpenSource\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/08/microsoft-moves-toward-open-source-linux-fills-cloud/ |title=Microsoft Moves Toward Open Source as Linux Fills Its Cloud |last=Metz |first=Cade |date=12 August 2015 |website=Wired |publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast Publishing |access-date=14 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2016, a new modding toolchain known as Fabric was released. Fabric devised its own set of free mappings to use instead of MCP mappings. Fabric also used Sponge's mixins.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} Fabric was very light and did not have all the elements of a forge mod, and could also be released from developmental snapshot versions of Minecraft, which other mod loaders could not.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nA new [[Windows 10]] version of ''Minecraft'' was announced shortly after which, unlike the previous versions, was to be programmed in [[C++]].<ref name=\"ViceModding\">{{Cite web |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-gamers-are-worried-about-minecraft-windows-10-edition |title='Why Gamers Are Worried About 'Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition' |last=Maiberg |first=Emanuel |date=6 July 2015 |website=VICE |publisher=Motherboard |access-date=18 February 2016}}</ref> This announcement sparked concern amongst the game's fanbase that the Java-based versions would end up being phased out entirely, which would hamper the production of mods as C++ is not as \"reverse engineerable\" as Java is known to be.

Liteloader was not updated for 1.13, and in its succession came Rift. Rift was a light mod loader for 1.13 to 1.13.2 which also used mixins. However, Liteloader and Rift did not release a mod loader for servers, so Liteloader and Rift mods could only run on the game client.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} A new server software for 1.12.2 named Magma was released, which allowed using PaperMC plugins and Forge mods together.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn late 2018, Fabric underwent a complete rewrite. Mappings' names were changed and more hooks were added to make modding easier. Fabric also began becoming very popular and 1.14 modding began to split between Forge and Fabric.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} Forge released their new long-term support system for ''Java Edition'' version 1.14, and updating mods to newer versions was made easier.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn August 2019, Microsoft decided to partnering with [[Nvidia]] to add support for ray tracing technology.

Mojang and Microsoft provide little official support for this (for example, the game provides no modding API for Java, although Mojang does provide methods for deobfuscating the game), but the EULA permits non-commercial mods.\n\nModding to the mobile and console versions of ''Minecraft'' on the [[Minecraft#Pocket/Bedrock Edition|Bedrock codebase]] are different, because that iteration of the game is written in C++ rather than Java.<ref name=\"ViceModding\" /> Players who wish to mod their game on Bedrock codebase versions have a simpler process, due to the version's built-in official support for \"add-ons\", which can be installed faster than ''Java Edition'' mods, and require no external mod loaders.\n\n== History ==\nAlthough the first version of ''Minecraft'' was released in May 2009,<ref name=\"PcGamerFirstMoments\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-first-moments-of-minecraft/ |title=The First Moments of Minecraft |last=Smith |first=Graham |date=6 February 2012 |website=PC Gamer |publisher=Future plc |access-date=12 February 2016}}</ref> client-side modding of the game did not become popular in earnest until the game reached its [[Software release life cycle#Alpha|alpha stage]] in June 2010. The only mods that were released during ''Minecraft''{{'s}} Indev and Infdev development stages were a few client-side mods which had minor changes to the game.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the release of Alpha, the first server-side mods began to appear.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} One of them was hMod, which added some simple but necessary tools to manage a server.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} Michael Stoyke, also known as Searge who would later go on to work for Mojang, created Minecraft Coder Pack (MCP), which was later renamed to Mod Coder Pack, keeping the same acronym. MCP was a tool which decompiled and deobfuscated ''Minecraft'' code. MCP would recompile and reobfuscate new and changed classes, which can be injected into the game. But, if multiple mods modified the same base code, it would conflict. To solve this problem, Risugami's Modloader was created; Modloader prevented any conflict occurring due to multiple mods modifying the same base classes or game resources.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nTowards the end of 2010, new mods were released which featured more content than previous ones. ''Minecraft'' was now preparing to move into its [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta development phase]], and popular mods such as ''IndustrialCraft'', ''Railcraft'' and ''BuildCraft'' were first released. As opposed to their predecessors, these mods had the potential to change the entire game instead of simply tweaking minor aspects of it.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> Bukkit, a server-side mod intended to replace hMod was also released during this time. CraftBukkit, a server software which implemented the Bukkit API was also released. Bukkit allowed server owners to install plug-ins which modified the server's way of taking input and giving output to the player without players having to install client-side mods.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nAround November 2011, the Forge Mod Loader and Minecraft Forge were released. Forge allowed players to be able to run several mods simultaneously. Forge utilized MCP mappings. Forge also released a server version of  Forge, which allowed mods to be run on servers, which eventually led to people creating modded servers. Forge ended the necessity to manipulate the base source code, allowing separate mods to run together without requiring them to touch the base source code.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> Forge also included many libraries and hooks which made mod development easier.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:@jeb talking at the modders panel @ MineCon 2012.jpg|thumb|In 2012, Mojang organized a panel on modding at [[MineCon#2012|MineCon 2012]], where ''Minecraft''{{'s}} lead developer [[Jens Bergensten]] held a talk.]]\nAfter ''Minecraft'' was fully released in November 2011, the game's modding community continued to grow.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> In February 2012, Mojang hired developers of the Bukkit to work on an official modding [[Application programming interface|API]], allowing mod developers easier access to the ''Minecraft'' game files.<ref name=\"ModdingAPIEurogamer\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-29-mojang-hires-bukkit-server-mod-team-to-make-official-minecraft-api |title=Mojang hires Bukkit server-mod team to make official Minecraft API |last=Purchese |first=Robert |date=29 February 2012 |website=Eurogamer |publisher=Gamer Network |access-date=13 February 2016}}</ref> Bukkit was then maintained by the community. A fork of CraftBukkit, called Spigot which was backward compatible with plugins was also in development. An Alternative to forge named Liteloader was released. Liteloader made modding very simple and promoted adding new content instead of modifying existing content. Like forge, Liteloader also used MCP mappings.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 2013, Forge Mod Loader soon replaced Risugami's Modloader as Modloader wasn't being updated in time by its developers.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} In early 2014, a new server software named Sponge, which had a very powerful plugin API compared to Bukkit, and was also compatible with running Forge mods was released. Sponge also introduced [[mixin]]s, an alternatively to modifying byte code. Soon, Liteloader implemented mixins into their API allowing developers to modify in-game content.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn mid-2014, Spigot released a server software made to link many servers together. The project was called BungeeCord, and had a separate plugin API from spigot and spigot plugins could work side by side with BungeeCord.

Major was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former prime ministers]].\n\nBorn in [[St Helier, London|St Helier, Surrey]], Major grew up in [[Brixton]]. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]].

Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded [[Geoffrey Howe]] as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]]. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]].\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-exempt special savings account|Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[Average propensity to save|savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard [[wikt:ecu|ecu]]\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]], Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390'' (HarperCollins, 1997), pp. 541\u201350.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|in November 1990]], Major and Douglas Hurd were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign \u2013 it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both Douglas Hurd and [[Michael Heseltine]] to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since [[Stanley Baldwin]] (under [[George V]] between 1935 and 1936).\n\n== Prime Minister (1990\u20131997) ==\n{{Infobox administration\n| image = John Major 1996.jpg\n| image_size = \n| name = Premiership of John Major\n| term_start = 28 November 1990\n| term_end = 2 May 1997\n| premier = John Major\n| premier_link = Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n| cabinet = [[First Major ministry|1st Major ministry]]<br />[[Second Major ministry|2nd Major ministry]]\n| party = [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| election = [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| appointer = Elizabeth II\n| seat = [[10 Downing Street]]\n| predecessor = [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]\n| successor = [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]\n| seal = Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (HM Government).svg\n| seal_size = \n| seal_caption = Royal Arms of the Government\n| official_url = \n}}\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of John Major]], [[Prime ministership of John Major]] -->\n{{Further|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = \n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Arcbushmaj.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Major with President [[George H.

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002.</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister.\"{{sfn|Bennett|1996}}\n\n===Black Wednesday===\n{{Main|Black Wednesday}}\nMajor's second honeymoon as Prime Minister following his election victory did not last long. On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. Newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being severely critical of him almost daily.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/leading-article-john-major-is-he-up-to-the-job-1453316.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=4 April 1993 | title=Leading Article: John Major: Is he up to the job?}}</ref> The UK's forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible [[exchange rate]]s, allowing lower interest rates and [[devaluation]], thereby increasing demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but by the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1993: Recession over&nbsp;\u2013 it's official |publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless&nbsp;\u2013 Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" \u2013 by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting airstrikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" ([[Douglas Hurd]] and others strongly opposed this policy).\n\n[[File:Sea King HC4 with PM John Major Sarajevo 1996.JPEG|thumb|A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying Major above the Ilidza Compound in [[Sarajevo, Bosnia]], during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] in 1996.]]\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogdanor |first=Vernon |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |title=No apologies for Bosnia  |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040607/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |archive-date=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Attila |first=Marko |url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/ |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Arms embargo on Bosnia was 'the most serious mistake made by the UN' \" Greater Surbiton |publisher=Greatersurbiton.wordpress.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nMajor opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office.

Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=476, 500\u201301, 691}}\n\nDefence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World in Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|1999}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n== Final years in Parliament (1997\u20132001) ==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as the party had no MPs from Scotland.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]].

In spite of this, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the [[European Union]]. Major never succeeded in reconciling the \"Euro-rebels\" among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number, wielded great influence because of his small majority and their wider following among Conservative activists and voters.

The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier.

[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] from 1990 to 1997. Major was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former prime ministers]].\n\nBorn in [[St Helier, London|St Helier, Surrey]], Major grew up in [[Brixton]]. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]].

Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded [[Geoffrey Howe]] as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]]. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]].\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-exempt special savings account|Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[Average propensity to save|savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard [[wikt:ecu|ecu]]\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]], Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390'' (HarperCollins, 1997), pp. 541\u201350.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|in November 1990]], Major and Douglas Hurd were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign \u2013 it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both Douglas Hurd and [[Michael Heseltine]] to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since [[Stanley Baldwin]] (under [[George V]] between 1935 and 1936).\n\n== Prime Minister (1990\u20131997) ==\n{{Infobox administration\n| image = John Major 1996.jpg\n| image_size = \n| name = Premiership of John Major\n| term_start = 28 November 1990\n| term_end = 2 May 1997\n| premier = John Major\n| premier_link = Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n| cabinet = [[First Major ministry|1st Major ministry]]<br />[[Second Major ministry|2nd Major ministry]]\n| party = [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| election = [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| appointer = Elizabeth II\n| seat = [[10 Downing Street]]\n| predecessor = [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]\n| successor = [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]\n| seal = Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (HM Government).svg\n| seal_size = \n| seal_caption = Royal Arms of the Government\n| official_url = \n}}\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of John Major]], [[Prime ministership of John Major]] -->\n{{Further|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = \n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Arcbushmaj.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Major with President [[George H.

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002.</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister.\"{{sfn|Bennett|1996}}\n\n===Black Wednesday===\n{{Main|Black Wednesday}}\nMajor's second honeymoon as Prime Minister following his election victory did not last long. On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister.

The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but by the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1993: Recession over&nbsp;\u2013 it's official |publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless&nbsp;\u2013 Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" \u2013 by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting airstrikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" ([[Douglas Hurd]] and others strongly opposed this policy).\n\n[[File:Sea King HC4 with PM John Major Sarajevo 1996.JPEG|thumb|A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying Major above the Ilidza Compound in [[Sarajevo, Bosnia]], during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] in 1996.]]\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogdanor |first=Vernon |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |title=No apologies for Bosnia  |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040607/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |archive-date=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Attila |first=Marko |url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/ |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Arms embargo on Bosnia was 'the most serious mistake made by the UN' \" Greater Surbiton |publisher=Greatersurbiton.wordpress.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nMajor opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office. When he declared to the House of Commons in November 1993 that \"to sit down and talk with [[Gerry Adams|Mr Adams]] and the Provisional IRA&nbsp;... would turn my stomach\",<ref>{{cite Hansard|title=European Council (Special Meeting)|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199293/cmhansrd/1993-11-01/Debate-2.html|date=1 November 1993|column=34|house=House of Commons}}</ref> [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] gave the media an outline of the secret talks indeed held regularly since that February. The [[Downing Street Declaration]] was issued on 15 December 1993 by Major and [[Albert Reynolds]], the Irish [[Taoiseach]], with whom he had a friendly relationship: an IRA ceasefire followed in 1994. In the House of Commons, Major refused to sign up to the first draft of the \"[[George J. Mitchell|Mitchell]] Principles\", which resulted in the ending of the ceasefire. Major paved the way for the Good Friday Agreement, also known as the 'Belfast Agreement', which was signed after he left office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Good-Friday-Agreement |title=Good Friday Agreement |encyclopedia= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date= 15 April 2019}}</ref>\nIn March 1995, Major refused to answer the phone calls of United States President [[Bill Clinton]] for several days because of his anger at Clinton's decision to invite Gerry Adams to the [[White House]] for [[Saint Patrick's Day|St Patrick's Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,12271,1243638,00.html|title='Mandela helped me survive Monicagate, Arafat could not make the leap to peace&nbsp;\u2013 and for days John Major wouldn't take my calls'|work=The Guardian |location=London | date= 21 June 2004 | accessdate=17 September 2006 | first=Alan | last=Rusbridger}}</ref>\n\n===Rail===\nFrom 1994 to 1997, Major [[privatisation of British Rail|privatised British Rail]], splitting it up into [[Passenger rail franchising in Great Britain|franchises to be run by the private sector]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=12| title=Railways Act 1993| author=Her Majesty's Government | year=1903| website=The Railways Archive| publisher=originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office| accessdate=26 November 2006}}</ref> The process was controversial at the time, and the [[Impact of the privatisation of British Rail|effect of privatising the railway]] is still disputed, with large growth in passenger numbers and increasing efficiency matched by large public subsidy<ref>{{cite news|title= Have train fares gone up or down since British Rail?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21056703|accessdate=2 August 2015|date=22 January 2013|publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/regulation-industry/what-would-we-consider-a-successful-railway-system|title=What would we consider a successful railway system?|last=Southwood|first=Ben|date=19 August 2014|publisher=[[Adam Smith Institute]]|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref> and concern about foreign companies running British railways.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/revealed-how-the-world-gets-rich-from-privatising-british-public-services-9874048.html|title=Revealed: How the world gets rich \u2013 from privatising British public services|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate= 30 December 2015|date=20 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===\"Sleaze\"===\nAt the 1993 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Conference, Major began the \"[[Back to Basics (campaign)|Back to Basics]]\" campaign, which he intended to also be about a wide variety of issues including the economy, education and policing, but which was interpreted by many (including Conservative cabinet ministers) purely in the context of returning to the moral and [[family values]] that they associated with the Conservative Party.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=403\u201308}}\n\nInstead of being well received, \"Back to Basics\" instead became synonymous with scandal, often exposed in lurid and embarrassing detail by [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspapers]] such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.

Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=476, 500\u201301, 691}}\n\nDefence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World in Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|1999}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n== Final years in Parliament (1997\u20132001) ==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as the party had no MPs from Scotland.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]].

Amtrak's ''[[Empire Service]]'' and ''[[Maple Leaf (train)|Maple Leaf]]'' serve the entire length of the corridor, with the ''Maple Leaf'' continuing to [[Toronto]]. ''[[Lake Shore Limited]]'' trains from [[Chicago Union Station|Chicago]] join the Empire Corridor just before {{amtk|Buffalo\u2013Depew}} station, and continue to Albany, where half of each train diverges to Boston, and the other half continues to New York City. The ''[[Ethan Allen Express]]'' and ''[[Adirondack (train)|Adirondack]]'' follow the corridor between New York and {{amtk|Schenectady}}, after which they diverge and continue on to {{amtk|Rutland}} and {{amtk|Montreal}}, respectively. [[Metro-North Railroad]]'s [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] provides commuter rail service between [[Poughkeepsie, New York]] and [[Grand Central Terminal]]. The line is electrified by both [[Overhead line|overhead catenary]] and top-running [[third rail]] on the Amtrak-owned segment between [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] and 41st Street, and by under-running [[third rail]] on the Metro-North segment from [[Grand Central Terminal]] to {{mnrr|Croton\u2013Harmon}}. \n\nThe corridor is also one of ten federally designated [[High-speed rail in the United States|high-speed rail]] corridors in the [[United States]].\n\nIf the proposed high-speed service were built on the corridor, trains traveling between Buffalo and New York City would travel at speeds of up to {{convert|125|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. In the 1890s service on the [[Empire State Express]] service between New York City and Buffalo was about 1 hour faster than Amtrak's service in 2013. On September 14, 1891 the Empire State Express covered the {{convert|436|mi|km}} between New York City and Buffalo in 7&nbsp;hours and 6&nbsp;minutes (including stops), averaging {{convert|61.4|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, with a top speed of {{convert|82|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"KUHF\">{{cite web| url=http://www.kuhf.org/cdprojects/steam/track12.html| title=Rain, Steam & Speed: Inventing Powered Motion| author=John Lienhard| accessdate=January 28, 2007}}</ref><ref name=NYT1893>{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1893/05/12/106864316.pdf| title=GREAT SPEED Off THE CENTRAL.; Empire State Express Engine Travels at the Rate of 112 1-2 Miles an Hour| publisher=New York Times| date=May 12, 1893| format=PDF| accessdate=December 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Ownership==\nThe Empire Corridor is largely owned by [[CSX Transportation]] (CSX), which owns the trackage between Niagara Falls and [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]].<ref name=\"timetable\">Amtrak system timetable, Fall 2010/Winter 2011, page 25</ref> Amtrak owns trackage rights for most of the Hudson line section north of Poughkeepsie to their rail yard in Albany. South of Poughkeepsie, the Empire Corridor is coextensive with Metro-North's trackage until it forks off between Metro-North's Riverdale and Spuyten Duyvil stations in the Bronx, to cross the [[Harlem River]] over the [[Spuyten Duyvil Bridge]] and make the [[Empire Connection]] to Penn Station. Amtrak owns the trackage after that fork, the [[West Side Line]].\n\nThe corridor had been part of the main line of the [[New York Central Railroad]]; it was the eastern leg of the NYC's famed \"Water Level Route\" to [[Chicago]]. The corridor passed to [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]] in 1968 upon the NYC's merger with the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], and passed to [[Conrail]] in 1976. In a series of purchases in the 1980s and 1990s, Amtrak bought the Bronx-Manhattan segment, Metro-North acquired the Poughkeepsie-Bronx segment, and CSX acquired the remainder when it split Conrail's assets with [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]].\n\nOn October 18, 2011, Amtrak and CSX announced an agreement for Amtrak to lease, operate and maintain the CSX-owned trackage between Poughkeepsie and Schenectady.<ref name=\"lease\">{{cite web|title=Amtrak to lease Empire Corridor trackage from CSX|url=http://trn.trains.com/en/Railroad%20News/News%20Wire/2011/10/Amtrak%20to%20lease%20Empire%20Corridor%20trackage%20from%20CSX.aspx|publisher=Trains Magazine|accessdate=October 19, 2011|date=October 18, 2011}}</ref> Amtrak officially assumed control of the line on December 1, 2012.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Governor Cuomo Announces Hudson Rail Lease - Amtrak/CSX Deal Will Improve Passenger Service, Move Projects Forward|date=December 4, 2012|publisher=[[Amtrak]]|location=[[Albany, New York]]|url=http://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/13/26/Amtrak-CSX-Hudson-Line-Release-ATK-12-126.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=December 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Current services==\nThe busiest segment of the Empire Corridor is between New York City and [[Albany, New York|Albany]] with multiple trains per day.\n\n===Amtrak===\nThe following trains operate along the varied segments of the corridor:\n*''[[Empire Service]]'': local service along the entire corridor from [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York City]] to {{amtk|Niagara Falls, NY}}.

{{convert|461|mi|km|adj=on}} railroad corridor between [[Niagara Falls, New York]] and [[New York City]], including the cities of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[Utica, New York|Utica]], [[Amsterdam, New York|Amsterdam]], [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], and [[Poughkeepsie, New York| Poughkeepsie]]. Amtrak's ''[[Empire Service]]'' and ''[[Maple Leaf (train)|Maple Leaf]]'' serve the entire length of the corridor, with the ''Maple Leaf'' continuing to [[Toronto]]. ''[[Lake Shore Limited]]'' trains from [[Chicago Union Station|Chicago]] join the Empire Corridor just before {{amtk|Buffalo\u2013Depew}} station, and continue to Albany, where half of each train diverges to Boston, and the other half continues to New York City. The ''[[Ethan Allen Express]]'' and ''[[Adirondack (train)|Adirondack]]'' follow the corridor between New York and {{amtk|Schenectady}}, after which they diverge and continue on to {{amtk|Rutland}} and {{amtk|Montreal}}, respectively. [[Metro-North Railroad]]'s [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] provides commuter rail service between [[Poughkeepsie, New York]] and [[Grand Central Terminal]]. The line is electrified by both [[Overhead line|overhead catenary]] and top-running [[third rail]] on the Amtrak-owned segment between [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] and 41st Street, and by under-running [[third rail]] on the Metro-North segment from just before {{mnrr|Riverdale}} to {{mnrr|Croton\u2013Harmon}} {{clarify|date=December 2019|reason=What about the Amtrak segment between 41st St. and the Metro North track?}}. \n\nThe corridor is also one of ten federally designated [[High-speed rail in the United States|high-speed rail]] corridors in the [[United States]].\n\nIf the proposed high-speed service were built on the corridor, trains traveling between Buffalo and New York City would travel at speeds of up to {{convert|125|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. In the 1890s service on the [[Empire State Express]] service between New York City and Buffalo was about 1 hour faster than Amtrak's service in 2013. On September 14, 1891 the Empire State Express covered the {{convert|436|mi|km}} between New York City and Buffalo in 7&nbsp;hours and 6&nbsp;minutes (including stops), averaging {{convert|61.4|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, with a top speed of {{convert|82|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"KUHF\">{{cite web| url=http://www.kuhf.org/cdprojects/steam/track12.html| title=Rain, Steam & Speed: Inventing Powered Motion| author=John Lienhard| accessdate=January 28, 2007}}</ref><ref name=NYT1893>{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1893/05/12/106864316.pdf| title=GREAT SPEED Off THE CENTRAL.; Empire State Express Engine Travels at the Rate of 112 1-2 Miles an Hour| publisher=New York Times| date=May 12, 1893| format=PDF| accessdate=December 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Ownership==\nThe Empire Corridor is largely owned by [[CSX Transportation]] (CSX), which owns the trackage between Niagara Falls and [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]].<ref name=\"timetable\">Amtrak system timetable, Fall 2010/Winter 2011, page 25</ref> South of Poughkeepsie, the Empire Corridor is coextensive with Metro-North's trackage until it forks off between Metro-North's Riverdale and Spuyten Duyvil stations in the Bronx, to cross the [[Harlem River]] over the [[Spuyten Duyvil Bridge]] and make the [[Empire Connection]] to Penn Station. Amtrak owns the trackage after that fork, the [[West Side Line]].\n\nMuch of the corridor had been part of the main line of the [[New York Central Railroad]]; it was the eastern leg of the NYC's famed \"Water Level Route\" to [[Chicago]]. The corridor passed to [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]] in 1968 upon the NYC's merger with the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], and passed to [[Conrail]] in 1976. In a series of purchases in the 1980s and 1990s, Amtrak bought the Bronx-Manhattan segment, Metro-North acquired the Poughkeepsie-Bronx segment, and CSX acquired the remainder when it split Conrail's assets with [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]].\n\nOn October 18, 2011, Amtrak and CSX announced an agreement for Amtrak to lease, operate and maintain the CSX-owned trackage between Poughkeepsie and Schenectady.<ref name=\"lease\">{{cite web|title=Amtrak to lease Empire Corridor trackage from CSX|url=http://trn.trains.com/en/Railroad%20News/News%20Wire/2011/10/Amtrak%20to%20lease%20Empire%20Corridor%20trackage%20from%20CSX.aspx|publisher=Trains Magazine|accessdate=October 19, 2011|date=October 18, 2011}}</ref> Amtrak officially assumed control of the line on December 1, 2012.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Governor Cuomo Announces Hudson Rail Lease - Amtrak/CSX Deal Will Improve Passenger Service, Move Projects Forward|date=December 4, 2012|publisher=[[Amtrak]]|location=[[Albany, New York]]|url=http://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/13/26/Amtrak-CSX-Hudson-Line-Release-ATK-12-126.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=December 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Current services==\nThe busiest segment of the Empire Corridor is between New York City and [[Albany, New York|Albany]] with multiple trains per day.\n\n===Amtrak===\nThe following trains operate along the varied segments of the corridor:\n*''[[Empire Service]]'': local service along the entire corridor from [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York City]] to {{amtk|Niagara Falls, NY}}.

It also contains the [[hair follicle]]s, [[sweat gland]]s, [[sebaceous gland]]s, [[apocrine glands]], [[lymphatic vessel]]s and [[blood vessel]]s. The [[blood vessel]]s in the [[dermis]] provide nourishment and waste removal from its own [[cell (biology)|cells]] as well as for the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]].\n\nThe [[dermis]] is tightly connected to the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] through a [[basement membrane]] and is structurally divided into two areas: a superficial area adjacent to the epidermis, called the ''papillary region'', and a deep thicker area known as the ''reticular region''.\n\n====Papillary region====\nThe papillary region is composed of loose [[areolar connective tissue]]. This is named for its fingerlike projections called ''papillae'' that extend toward the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. The papillae provide the [[dermis]] with a \"bumpy\" surface that interdigitates with the epidermis, strengthening the connection between the two layers of skin.\n\n====Reticular region====\nThe reticular region lies deep in the papillary region and is usually much thicker. It is composed of dense irregular [[connective tissue]] and receives its name from the dense concentration of [[collagen]]ous, [[Elastic fibers|elastic]], and [[Reticular fiber|reticular]] fibers that weave throughout it. These [[protein]] fibers give the [[dermis]] its properties of [[strength of materials|strength]], [[extensibility]], and [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]].\nAlso located within the reticular region are the [[roots of the hair]], [[sweat gland]]s, [[sebaceous gland]]s, [[Cutaneous receptor|receptors]], [[nail (anatomy)|nails]], and [[blood vessel]]s.\n\n===Subcutaneous tissue===\n{{main|Subcutaneous tissue}}\n\nThe [[subcutaneous tissue]] (also hypodermis)  is not part of the skin, and lies below the [[dermis]]. Its purpose is to attach the skin to underlying [[bone]] and [[muscle]] as well as supplying it with [[blood vessel]]s and [[nerve]]s. It consists of loose [[connective tissue]] and [[elastin]]. The main [[cell (biology)|cell]] types are [[fibroblast]]s, [[macrophage]]s and [[adipocyte]]s (the subcutaneous tissue contains 50% of [[body fat]]). [[Fat]] serves as padding and insulation for the body.\n\n[[Microorganisms]] like ''[[Staphylococcus]] epidermidis'' colonize the skin surface. The density of [[skin flora]] depends on region of the skin. The disinfected skin surface gets recolonized from [[bacteria]] residing in the deeper areas of the [[hair follicle]], [[gastrointestinal tract|gut]] and [[urogenital]] openings.\n\n===Detailed cross section===\n{{wide image|Skin_layers.svg|800px|Skin layers, of both the hairy and hairless skin}}\n\n==Structure in Fish, Amphibians, Birds, and Reptiles==\n\n===Fish===\n{{see also|Fish scales}}\n\nThe epidermis of [[fish]] and of most [[amphibian]]s consists entirely of live [[cell (biology)|cells]], with only minimal quantities of [[keratin]] in the cells of the superficial layer. It is generally permeable, and in the case of many [[amphibians]], may actually be a major respiratory organ. The [[dermis]] of [[bony fish]] typically contains relatively little of the [[connective tissue]] found in [[tetrapod]]s. Instead, in most species, it is largely replaced by solid, protective bony [[scale (zoology)|scales]]. Apart from some particularly large dermal bones that form parts of the [[skull]], these [[scale (zoology)|scales]] are lost in [[tetrapods]], although many [[reptile]]s do have [[scale (zoology)|scales]] of a different kind, as do [[pangolin]]s. [[Cartilaginous fish]] have numerous tooth-like [[Dermal denticle|denticles]] embedded in their skin, in place of true [[scale (zoology)|scales]].\n\n[[Sweat gland]]s and [[sebaceous gland]]s are both unique to [[mammals]], but other types of skin gland are found in other [[vertebrates]]. [[Fish]] typically have a numerous individual [[mucus]]-secreting skin [[cell (biology)|cells]] that aid in insulation and protection, but may also have [[poison]] [[glands]], [[photophore]]s, or [[cell (biology)|cells]] that produce a more watery, [[serous]] fluid. In [[amphibians]], the [[mucus]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] are gathered together to form sac-like [[glands]]. Most living [[amphibians]] also possess ''granular [[glands]]'' in the skin, that secrete irritating or toxic compounds.<ref name=VB/>\n\nAlthough [[melanin]] is found in the skin of many species, in the [[reptile]]s, the [[amphibians]], and [[fish]], the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] is often relatively colorless. Instead, the color of the skin is largely due to [[chromatophore]]s in the [[dermis]], which, in addition to melanin, may contain [[guanine]] or [[carotenoid]] [[pigments]]. Many species, such as [[chameleon]]s and [[flounder]]s may be able to change the color of their skin by adjusting the relative size of their [[chromatophores]].<ref name=VB/>\n\n=== Amphibians ===\n''See also: [[amphibian]]s''\n\n==== Overview ====\nAmphibians possess two types of [[gland]]s, [[Mucous gland|mucous]] and granular (serous). Both of these glands are part of the [[integument]] and thus considered [[cutaneous]]. Mucous and granular glands are both divided into three different sections which all connect to structure the gland as a whole. The three individual parts of the gland are the duct, the intercalary region, and lastly the alveolar gland (sac). Structurally, the duct is derived via [[keratinocyte]]s and passes through to the surface of the [[Epidermis|epidermal]] or outer skin layer thus allowing external secretions of the body. The gland alveolus is a sac shaped structure which is found on the bottom or base region of the granular gland. The cells in this sac specialize in secretion. Between the alveolar gland and the duct is the intercalary system which can be summed up as a transitional region connecting the duct to the grand alveolar beneath the epidermal skin layer. In general, granular glands are larger in size than the mucous glands, however mucous glands hold a much greater majority in overall number.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Cutaneous granular glands and amphibian venoms |publisher= ScienceDirect|language=en|doi=10.1016/0300-9629(95)98515-I|volume=111|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Physiology|pages=1\u201329 | last1 = Toledo | first1 = R.C.|year=1995}}</ref>\n[[File:FrogSkin.png|thumb|616x616px|'''Frog Gland Anatomy-''' A: Mucous gland (alveolus), B: Chromophore, C: Granular Gland (alveolus), D: Connective Tissue, E: Stratum Corneum, F: Transition Zone (intercalary region), G: Epidermis (Where the duct resides), H: Dermis]]\n\n==== Granular Glands ====\nGranular glands can be identified as [[venom]]ous and often differ in the type of toxin as well as the concentrations of secretions across various orders and species within the amphibians. They are located in clusters differing in concentration depending on [[amphibian]] taxa. The toxins can be fatal to most vertebrates or have no effect against others. These glands are alveolar meaning they structurally have little sacs in which venom is produced and held before it is secreted upon defensive behaviors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStructurally, the ducts of the granular gland initially maintain a cylindrical shape. However, when the ducts become mature and full of toxic fluid, the base of the ducts become swollen due to the pressure from the inside. This causes the epidermal layer to form a pit like opening on the surface of the duct in which the inner fluid will be secreted in an upwards fashion.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UklQAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA635&lpg=PA635&dq=necturus+integument+google+book#v=onepage&q=necturus%20integument%20google%20book&f=false|title=Journal of Morphology|date=1920-01-01|publisher=Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology .|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe intercalary region of granular glands are more developed and mature in comparison with mucous glands. This region resides as a ring of cells surrounding the basal portion of the duct which are argued to have an [[ectoderm]]al muscular nature due to their influence over the lumen (space inside the tube) of the duct with dilation and constriction functions during secretions. The cells are found radially around the duct and provide a distinct attachment site for muscle fibers around the gland's body.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe gland alveolus is a sac that is divided into three specific regions/layers. The outer layer or tunica fibrosa is composed of densely packed connective-tissue which connects with fibers from the spongy intermediate layer where elastic fibers as well as nerves reside. The nerves send signals to the muscles as well as the epithelial layers. Lastly, the epithelium or tunica propria encloses the gland.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Mucous Glands ====\nMucous glands are non-venomous and offer a different functionality for amphibians than granular. Mucous glands cover the entire surface area of the amphibian body and specialize in keeping the body lubricated. There are many other functions of the mucous glands such as controlling the pH, thermoregulation, adhesive properties to the environment, anti-predator behaviors (slimy to the grasp), chemical communication, even anti-bacterial/viral properties for protection against pathogens.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ducts of the mucous gland appear as cylindrical vertical tubes which break through the epidermal layer to the surface of the skin. The cells lining the inside of the ducts are oriented with their longitudinal axis forming 90 degree angles surrounding the duct in a helical fashion.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIntercalary cells react identically to those of granular glands but on a smaller scale. Among the amphibians, there are taxa which contain a modified intercalary region (depending on the function of the glands), yet the majority share the same structure.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe alveolor of mucous glands are much more simple and only consist of an epithelium layer as well as connective tissue which forms a cover over the gland. This gland lacks a tunica propria and appears to have delicate and intricate fibers which pass over the gland's muscle and epithelial layers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Birds and reptiles===\n{{Main|Reptile scales}}\nThe [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] of [[bird]]s and [[reptile]]s is closer to that of [[mammals]], with a layer of dead keratin-filled [[cell (biology)|cells]] at the surface, to help reduce water loss. A similar pattern is also seen in some of the more terrestrial [[amphibians]] such as [[toad]]s. However, in all of these animals there is no clear [[cell differentiation|differentiation]] of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] into distinct layers, as occurs in [[human]]s, with the change in [[cell (biology)|cell]] type being relatively gradual. The mammalian [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] always possesses at least a [[stratum germinativum]] and [[stratum corneum]], but the other intermediate layers found in [[human]]s are not always distinguishable.\n[[Hair]] is a distinctive feature of mammalian skin, while [[feather]]s are (at least among living species) similarly unique to [[bird]]s.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia|pages= 129\u2013145|isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}</ref>\n\n[[Bird]]s and [[reptile]]s have relatively few skin [[gland]]s, although there may be a few structures for specific purposes, such as [[pheromone]]-secreting [[cell (biology)|cells]] in some [[reptile]]s, or the [[uropygial gland]] of most birds.<ref name=VB/>\n\n==Development==\n{{Cn span|Cutaneous structures arise from the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and include a variety of features such as hair, feathers, claws and nails. During embryogenesis, the epidermis splits into two layers: the periderm (which is lost) and the [[Stratum germinativum|basal layer]].  The basal layer is a [[stem cell]] layer and through asymmetrical divisions, becomes the source of skin cells throughout life. It is maintained as a stem cell layer through an [[autocrine]] signal, [[Transforming growth factor|TGF-a]], and through [[paracrine]] signal FGF7 aka [[keratinocyte growth factor]] (KGF) produced by the dermis below the basal cells. In mice, over-expression of these factors leads to an overproduction of granule cells and thick skin.|date=December 2017}}\n\n{{Cn span|Hair and feathers are formed in a regular pattern and it is believed to be the result of a reaction-diffusion system. This [[reaction-diffusion system]] combines an activator, [[Sonic hedgehog]], with an inhibitor, BMP4 or BMP2, to form clusters of cells in a regular pattern. Sonic hedgehog-expressing epidermal cells induce the condensation of cells in the mesoderm. The clusters of mesodermal cells signal back to the epidermis to form the appropriate structure for that position.

It also contains the [[hair follicle]]s, [[sweat gland]]s, [[sebaceous gland]]s, [[apocrine glands]], [[lymphatic vessel]]s and [[blood vessel]]s. The [[blood vessel]]s in the [[dermis]] provide nourishment and waste removal from its own [[cell (biology)|cells]] as well as for the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]].\n\nThe [[dermis]] is tightly connected to the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] through a [[basement membrane]] and is structurally divided into two areas: a superficial area adjacent to the epidermis, called the ''papillary region'', and a deep thicker area known as the ''reticular region''.\n\n====Papillary region====\nThe papillary region is composed of loose [[areolar connective tissue]]. This is named for its fingerlike projections called ''papillae'' that extend toward the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. The papillae provide the [[dermis]] with a \"bumpy\" surface that interdigitates with the epidermis, strengthening the connection between the two layers of skin.\n\n====Reticular region====\nThe reticular region lies deep in the papillary region and is usually much thicker. It is composed of dense irregular [[connective tissue]] and receives its name from the dense concentration of [[collagen]]ous, [[Elastic fibers|elastic]], and [[Reticular fiber|reticular]] fibers that weave throughout it. These [[protein]] fibers give the [[dermis]] its properties of [[strength of materials|strength]], [[extensibility]], and [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]].\nAlso located within the reticular region are the [[roots of the hair]], [[sweat gland]]s, [[sebaceous gland]]s, [[Cutaneous receptor|receptors]], [[nail (anatomy)|nails]], and [[blood vessel]]s.\n\n===Subcutaneous tissue===\n{{main|Subcutaneous tissue}}\n\nThe [[subcutaneous tissue]] (also hypodermis)  is not part of the skin, and lies below the [[dermis]]. Its purpose is to attach the skin to underlying [[bone]] and [[muscle]] as well as supplying it with [[blood vessel]]s and [[nerve]]s. It consists of loose [[connective tissue]] and [[elastin]]. The main [[cell (biology)|cell]] types are [[fibroblast]]s, [[macrophage]]s and [[adipocyte]]s (the subcutaneous tissue contains 50% of [[body fat]]). [[Fat]] serves as padding and insulation for the body.\n\n[[Microorganisms]] like ''[[Staphylococcus]] epidermidis'' colonize the skin surface. The density of [[skin flora]] depends on region of the skin. The disinfected skin surface gets recolonized from [[bacteria]] residing in the deeper areas of the [[hair follicle]], [[gastrointestinal tract|gut]] and [[urogenital]] openings.\n\n===Detailed cross section===\n{{wide image|Skin_layers.svg|800px|Skin layers, of both the hairy and hairless skin}}\n\n==Structure in Fish, Amphibians, Birds, and Reptiles==\n\n===Fish===\n{{see also|Fish scales}}\n\nThe epidermis of [[fish]] and of most [[amphibian]]s consists entirely of live [[cell (biology)|cells]], with only minimal quantities of [[keratin]] in the cells of the superficial layer. It is generally permeable, and in the case of many [[amphibians]], may actually be a major respiratory organ. The [[dermis]] of [[bony fish]] typically contains relatively little of the [[connective tissue]] found in [[tetrapod]]s. Instead, in most species, it is largely replaced by solid, protective bony [[scale (zoology)|scales]]. Apart from some particularly large dermal bones that form parts of the [[skull]], these [[scale (zoology)|scales]] are lost in [[tetrapods]], although many [[reptile]]s do have [[scale (zoology)|scales]] of a different kind, as do [[pangolin]]s. [[Cartilaginous fish]] have numerous tooth-like [[Dermal denticle|denticles]] embedded in their skin, in place of true [[scale (zoology)|scales]].\n\n[[Sweat gland]]s and [[sebaceous gland]]s are both unique to [[mammals]], but other types of skin gland are found in other [[vertebrates]]. [[Fish]] typically have a numerous individual [[mucus]]-secreting skin [[cell (biology)|cells]] that aid in insulation and protection, but may also have [[poison]] [[glands]], [[photophore]]s, or [[cell (biology)|cells]] that produce a more watery, [[serous]] fluid. In [[amphibians]], the [[mucus]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] are gathered together to form sac-like [[glands]]. Most living [[amphibians]] also possess ''granular [[glands]]'' in the skin, that secrete irritating or toxic compounds.<ref name=VB/>\n\nAlthough [[melanin]] is found in the skin of many species, in the [[reptile]]s, the [[amphibians]], and [[fish]], the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] is often relatively colorless. Instead, the color of the skin is largely due to [[chromatophore]]s in the [[dermis]], which, in addition to melanin, may contain [[guanine]] or [[carotenoid]] [[pigments]]. Many species, such as [[chameleon]]s and [[flounder]]s may be able to change the color of their skin by adjusting the relative size of their [[chromatophores]].<ref name=VB/>\n\n=== Amphibians ===\n''See also: [[amphibian]]s''\n\n==== Overview ====\nAmphibians possess two types of [[gland]]s, [[Mucous gland|mucous]] and granular (serous). Both of these glands are part of the [[integument]] and thus considered [[cutaneous]]. Mucous and granular glands are both divided into three different sections which all connect to structure the gland as a whole. The three individual parts of the gland are the duct, the intercalary region, and lastly the alveolar gland (sac). Structurally, the duct is derived via [[keratinocyte]]s and passes through to the surface of the [[Epidermis|epidermal]] or outer skin layer thus allowing external secretions of the body. The gland alveolus is a sac shaped structure which is found on the bottom or base region of the granular gland. The cells in this sac specialize in secretion. Between the alveolar gland and the duct is the intercalary system which can be summed up as a transitional region connecting the duct to the grand alveolar beneath the epidermal skin layer. In general, granular glands are larger in size than the mucous glands, however mucous glands hold a much greater majority in overall number.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Cutaneous granular glands and amphibian venoms |publisher= ScienceDirect|language=en|doi=10.1016/0300-9629(95)98515-I|volume=111|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Physiology|pages=1\u201329 | last1 = Toledo | first1 = R.C.|year=1995}}</ref>\n[[File:FrogSkin.png|thumb|616x616px|'''Frog Gland Anatomy-''' A: Mucous gland (alveolus), B: Chromophore, C: Granular Gland (alveolus), D: Connective Tissue, E: Stratum Corneum, F: Transition Zone (intercalary region), G: Epidermis (Where the duct resides), H: Dermis]]\n\n==== Granular Glands ====\nGranular glands can be identified as [[venom]]ous and often differ in the type of toxin as well as the concentrations of secretions across various orders and species within the amphibians. They are located in clusters differing in concentration depending on [[amphibian]] taxa. The toxins can be fatal to most vertebrates or have no effect against others. These glands are alveolar meaning they structurally have little sacs in which venom is produced and held before it is secreted upon defensive behaviors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStructurally, the ducts of the granular gland initially maintain a cylindrical shape. However, when the ducts become mature and full of toxic fluid, the base of the ducts become swollen due to the pressure from the inside. This causes the epidermal layer to form a pit like opening on the surface of the duct in which the inner fluid will be secreted in an upwards fashion.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UklQAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA635&lpg=PA635&dq=necturus+integument+google+book#v=onepage&q=necturus%20integument%20google%20book&f=false|title=Journal of Morphology|date=1920-01-01|publisher=Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology .|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe intercalary region of granular glands are more developed and mature in comparison with mucous glands. This region resides as a ring of cells surrounding the basal portion of the duct which are argued to have an [[ectoderm]]al muscular nature due to their influence over the lumen (space inside the tube) of the duct with dilation and constriction functions during secretions. The cells are found radially around the duct and provide a distinct attachment site for muscle fibers around the gland's body.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe gland alveolus is a sac that is divided into three specific regions/layers. The outer layer or tunica fibrosa is composed of densely packed connective-tissue which connects with fibers from the spongy intermediate layer where elastic fibers as well as nerves reside. The nerves send signals to the muscles as well as the epithelial layers. Lastly, the epithelium or tunica propria encloses the gland.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Mucous Glands ====\nMucous glands are non-venomous and offer a different functionality for amphibians than granular. Mucous glands cover the entire surface area of the amphibian body and specialize in keeping the body lubricated. There are many other functions of the mucous glands such as controlling the pH, thermoregulation, adhesive properties to the environment, anti-predator behaviors (slimy to the grasp), chemical communication, even anti-bacterial/viral properties for protection against pathogens.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ducts of the mucous gland appear as cylindrical vertical tubes which break through the epidermal layer to the surface of the skin. The cells lining the inside of the ducts are oriented with their longitudinal axis forming 90 degree angles surrounding the duct in a helical fashion.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIntercalary cells react identically to those of granular glands but on a smaller scale. Among the amphibians, there are taxa which contain a modified intercalary region (depending on the function of the glands), yet the majority share the same structure.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe alveolor of mucous glands are much more simple and only consist of an epithelium layer as well as connective tissue which forms a cover over the gland. This gland lacks a tunica propria and appears to have delicate and intricate fibers which pass over the gland's muscle and epithelial layers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Birds and reptiles===\n{{Main|Reptile scales}}\nThe [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] of [[bird]]s and [[reptile]]s is closer to that of [[mammals]], with a layer of dead keratin-filled [[cell (biology)|cells]] at the surface, to help reduce water loss. A similar pattern is also seen in some of the more terrestrial [[amphibians]] such as [[toad]]s. However, in all of these animals there is no clear [[cell differentiation|differentiation]] of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] into distinct layers, as occurs in [[human]]s, with the change in [[cell (biology)|cell]] type being relatively gradual. The mammalian [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] always possesses at least a [[stratum germinativum]] and [[stratum corneum]], but the other intermediate layers found in [[human]]s are not always distinguishable.\n[[Hair]] is a distinctive feature of mammalian skin, while [[feather]]s are (at least among living species) similarly unique to [[bird]]s.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia|pages= 129\u2013145|isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}</ref>\n\n[[Bird]]s and [[reptile]]s have relatively few skin [[gland]]s, although there may be a few structures for specific purposes, such as [[pheromone]]-secreting [[cell (biology)|cells]] in some [[reptile]]s, or the [[uropygial gland]] of most birds.<ref name=VB/>\n\n==Development==\n{{Cn span|Cutaneous structures arise from the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and include a variety of features such as hair, feathers, claws and nails.

The basal layer is a [[stem cell]] layer and through asymmetrical divisions, becomes the source of skin cells throughout life. It is maintained as a stem cell layer through an [[autocrine]] signal, [[Transforming growth factor|TGF-a]], and through [[paracrine]] signal FGF7 aka [[keratinocyte growth factor]] (KGF) produced by the dermis below the basal cells. In mice, over-expression of these factors leads to an overproduction of granule cells and thick skin.|date=December 2017}}\n\n{{Cn span|Hair and feathers are formed in a regular pattern and it is believed to be the result of a reaction-diffusion system. This [[reaction-diffusion system]] combines an activator, [[Sonic hedgehog]], with an inhibitor, BMP4 or BMP2, to form clusters of cells in a regular pattern.

The earliest comparison between the two cities showed that they had a similar topography, with the [[Castle Rock (Edinburgh)|Castle Rock]] of Edinburgh performing a similar role to the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]]. Both of them had flatter, fertile agricultural land sloping down to a [[port]] several miles away (respectively [[Leith]] and [[Piraeus]]). Although this arrangement is common in [[Southern Europe]], it is rare in [[Northern Europe]]. The 18th-century intellectual life, referred to as the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], was a key influence in gaining the name.

The earliest comparison between the two cities showed that they had a similar topography, with the [[Castle Rock (Edinburgh)|Castle Rock]] of Edinburgh performing a similar role to the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]]. Both of them had flatter, fertile agricultural land sloping down to a [[port]] several miles away (respectively [[Leith]] and [[Piraeus]]). Although this arrangement is common in [[Southern Europe]], it is rare in [[Northern Europe]]. The 18th-century intellectual life, referred to as the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], was a key influence in gaining the name. Such luminaries as [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]] shone during this period. Having lost most of its political importance after the [[Treaty of Union 1707|Union]], some hoped that Edinburgh could gain a similar influence on London as Athens had on Rome. Also a contributing factor was the later [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] architecture, particularly that of [[William Henry Playfair]], and the [[National Monument, Edinburgh|National Monument]].

The principal street was to be [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]], running along the natural ridge to the north of what became known as the \"Old Town\". To either side of it are two other main streets: Princes Street and Queen Street.

The three main streets are connected by a series of streets running perpendicular to them.
