Similar to [[lobster]]s and [[crab]]s, trilobites would have physically \"grown\" between the moult stage and the hardening of the new exoskeleton.\n\n===Cephalon===\n{{See also|Cephalon (arthropod anatomy)}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| header = Morphology of the trilobite cephalon\n| header_align = center\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 218\n| image2 = Trilobite cephalon areas numbered.svg|alt2 Labeled diagram of cephalon areas of a trilobite\n| caption2 = The subdivisions can be further broken down into different areas used in describing trilobite cephalic morphology. 1 \u2013 preocular area; 2 \u2013 palpebral area; 3 \u2013 postocular area; 4 \u2013 posterolateral projection; 5 \u2013 occipital ring; 6 \u2013 glabella; 7 \u2013 posterior area; 8 \u2013 lateral border; 9 \u2013 librigenal area; 10 \u2013 preglabellar area\n| image1 = Trilobite cranidium-en.svg\n| alt1 = Labeled diagram of major parts of the cephalon\n| caption1 = The major subdivisions of the cephalon\n}}\n\nA trilobite's cephalon, or head section, is highly variable with a lot of morphological complexity. The [[Glabella (trilobite anatomy)|glabella]] forms a dome underneath which sat the \"crop\" or \"stomach\". Generally the exoskeleton has few distinguishing ventral features, but the cephalon often preserves muscle attachment scars and occasionally the [[hypostome (trilobite)|hypostome]], a small rigid plate comparable to the ventral plate in other arthropods. A toothless mouth and stomach sat upon the hypostome with the mouth facing backward at the rear edge of the hypostome.\n\nHypostome morphology is highly variable; sometimes supported by an un-mineralised membrane (natant), sometimes fused onto the anterior doublure with an outline very similar to the glabella above (conterminant) or fused to the anterior doublure with an outline significantly different from the glabella (impendent). Many variations in shape and placement of the hypostome have been described.<ref name=Fortey1990/> The size of the glabella and the lateral fringe of the cephalon, together with hypostome variation, have been linked to different lifestyles, diets and specific [[ecological niche]]s.<ref name=Fortey04/>\n\nThe anterior and lateral fringe of the cephalon is greatly enlarged in the [[Harpetida]], in other species a bulge in the pre-glabellar area is preserved that suggests a brood pouch.<ref name=\"Fortey98\"/> Highly complex compound eyes are another obvious feature of the cephalon.\n\n====Facial sutures====\nFacial or cephalic sutures are the natural fracture lines in the [[Cephalon (arthropod head)|cephalon]] of trilobites.

One of the more pronounced states is that the front of the facial sutures do not cut the lateral or frontal border on its own, but coincide in front of the glabella, and cut the frontal border at the midline. This is, inter alia, the case in the Asaphida. Even more pronounced is the situation that the frontal branches of the facial sutures end in each other, resulting in yoked free cheeks.

This implies that lenses need to be larger under low light conditions (such as for ''[[Pricyclopyge]]'', when comparing it to ''[[Carolinites]]''), and for fast moving predators and prey. As the circular velocity caused by the forward speed of an animal itself is much higher for the [[Ommatidium|ommatidia]] directed perpendicular to the movement, fast-moving trilobites (such as ''Carolinites'') have eyes flattened from the side and more curved were ommatia are directed to the front or back.

Despite morphological complexity and an unclear position within higher classifications, there are a number of characteristics which distinguish the trilobites from other arthropods: a generally sub-elliptical, [[dorsum (biology)|dorsal]], [[chitin]]ous exoskeleton divided longitudinally into three distinct lobes (from which the group gets its name); having a distinct, relatively large head shield (cephalon) articulating axially with a [[thorax]] comprising articulated transverse segments, the hindmost of which are almost invariably fused to form a tail shield ([[pygidium]]). When describing differences between trilobite [[taxon|taxa]], the presence, size, and shape of the [[cephalic]] features are often mentioned.\n\nDuring [[ecdysis|moulting]], the exoskeleton generally splits between the head and thorax, which is why so many trilobite fossils are missing one or the other. In most groups [[facial sutures]] on the cephalon helped facilitate moulting. Similar to [[lobster]]s and [[crab]]s, trilobites would have physically \"grown\" between the moult stage and the hardening of the new exoskeleton.\n\n===Cephalon===\n{{See also|Cephalon (arthropod anatomy)}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| header = Morphology of the trilobite cephalon\n| header_align = center\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 218\n| image2 = Trilobite cephalon areas numbered.svg|alt2 Labeled diagram of cephalon areas of a trilobite\n| caption2 = The subdivisions can be further broken down into different areas used in describing trilobite cephalic morphology. 1 \u2013 preocular area; 2 \u2013 palpebral area; 3 \u2013 postocular area; 4 \u2013 posterolateral projection; 5 \u2013 occipital ring; 6 \u2013 glabella; 7 \u2013 posterior area; 8 \u2013 lateral border; 9 \u2013 librigenal area; 10 \u2013 preglabellar area\n| image1 = Trilobite cranidium-en.svg\n| alt1 = Labeled diagram of major parts of the cephalon\n| caption1 = The major subdivisions of the cephalon\n}}\n\nA trilobite's cephalon, or head section, is highly variable with a lot of morphological complexity. The [[Glabella (trilobite anatomy)|glabella]] forms a dome underneath which sat the \"crop\" or \"stomach\". Generally the exoskeleton has few distinguishing ventral features, but the cephalon often preserves muscle attachment scars and occasionally the [[hypostome (trilobite)|hypostome]], a small rigid plate comparable to the ventral plate in other arthropods. A toothless mouth and stomach sat upon the hypostome with the mouth facing backward at the rear edge of the hypostome.\n\nHypostome morphology is highly variable; sometimes supported by an un-mineralised membrane (natant), sometimes fused onto the anterior doublure with an outline very similar to the glabella above (conterminant) or fused to the anterior doublure with an outline significantly different from the glabella (impendent). Many variations in shape and placement of the hypostome have been described.<ref name=Fortey1990/> The size of the glabella and the lateral fringe of the cephalon, together with hypostome variation, have been linked to different lifestyles, diets and specific [[ecological niche]]s.<ref name=Fortey04/>\n\nThe anterior and lateral fringe of the cephalon is greatly enlarged in the [[Harpetida]], in other species a bulge in the pre-glabellar area is preserved that suggests a brood pouch.<ref name=\"Fortey98\"/> Highly complex compound eyes are another obvious feature of the cephalon.\n\n====Facial sutures====\nFacial or cephalic sutures are the natural fracture lines in the [[Cephalon (arthropod head)|cephalon]] of trilobites.

One of the more pronounced states is that the front of the facial sutures do not cut the lateral or frontal border on its own, but coincide in front of the glabella, and cut the frontal border at the midline. This is, inter alia, the case in the Asaphida. Even more pronounced is the situation that the frontal branches of the facial sutures end in each other, resulting in yoked free cheeks.

The mouth is linked by a small esophagus to the stomach that lay forward of the mouth, below the glabella. The \"intestine\" led backward from there to the pygidium.<ref name=Bruton03a /> The \"feeding limbs\" attached to the cephalon are thought to have fed food into the mouth, possibly \"slicing\" the food on the hypostome and/or gnathobases first. Alternative lifestyles are suggested, with the cephalic legs used to disturb the sediment to make food available. A large glabella, (implying a large stomach), coupled with an impendent hypostome has been used as evidence of more complex food sources, i.e. possibly a carnivorous lifestyle.<ref name=Fortey04 />\n\n===Internal organs===\nWhile there is direct and implied evidence for the presence and location of the mouth, stomach and digestive tract (see above) the presence of heart, brain and liver are only implied (although \"present\" in many reconstructions) with little direct geological evidence.<ref name=\"Whittington97b\" />\n\n===Musculature===\nAlthough rarely preserved, long lateral muscles extended from the cephalon to midway down the pygidium, attaching to the axial rings allowing enrollment while separate muscles on the legs tucked them out of the way.<ref name=Bruton03a />\n\n==Sensory organs==\nMany trilobites had complex eyes; they also had a pair of [[antenna (biology)|antenna]]e.

Holochroal eyes are the ancestral eye of trilobites, and are by far the most common, found in all orders except the Agnostida, and through the entirety of the Trilobites' existence.<ref name=Clarkson79 /> Little is known of the early history of holochroal eyes; Lower and Middle Cambrian trilobites rarely preserve the visual surface.<ref name=Clarkson79 /> The spatial resolving power of grated eyes (such as holochroal eyes) is dependent on [[irradiance|light intensity]], [[circular motion]], receptor density, registered light angle, and the extent to which the signal of individual [[Ommatidium|rhabdoms]] are neurally combined. This implies that lenses need to be larger under low light conditions (such as for ''[[Pricyclopyge]]'', when comparing it to ''[[Carolinites]]''), and for fast moving predators and prey. As the circular velocity caused by the forward speed of an animal itself is much higher for the [[Ommatidium|ommatidia]] directed perpendicular to the movement, fast-moving trilobites (such as ''Carolinites'') have eyes flattened from the side and more curved were ommatia are directed to the front or back.

The Spanish geologists Eladio Li\u00f1\u00e1n and Rodolfo Gozalo argue that some of the fossils described in Greek and Latin [[Lapidary|lapidaries]] as scorpion stone, beetle stone, and ant stone, refer to trilobite fossils. Less ambiguous references to trilobite fossils can be found in Chinese sources. Fossils from the Kushan formation of northeastern China were prized as inkstones and decorative pieces.<ref name=\"McKay\"/>\n\nIn the [[New World]], American fossil hunters found plentiful deposits of [[Elrathia|''Elrathia kingi'']] in western [[Utah]] in the 1860s. Until the early 1900s, the [[Ute people|Ute Native Americans]] of Utah wore these trilobites, which they called ''pachavee'' (little water bug), as [[amulet]]s.<ref name=Joleen/><ref name=AlexandraMichael2010>{{cite journal |last1=van der Geer |first1=Alexandra |last2=Dermitzakis |first2=Michael |date=2010 |title=Fossils in pharmacy: from \"snake eggs\" to \"Saint's bones\"; an overview |url=http://www.hellenjgeosci.geol.uoa.gr/45/van%20der%20Geer%20&%20Dermitzakis.pdf |journal=[[Hellenic Journal of Geosciences]] |volume=45 |issue= |pages=323\u2013332 |doi= |access-date= }}</ref> A hole was bored in the head and the fossil was worn on a string.<ref name=Joleen>{{Citation |author=Joleen Robinson |title=Tracking the Trilobites |journal=Desert Magazine |date=October 1970}}</ref> According to the Ute themselves, trilobite necklaces protect against bullets and diseases such as [[diphtheria]].<ref name=Joleen/><ref name=AlexandraMichael2010/> In 1931, Frank Beckwith uncovered evidence of the Ute use of trilobites. Travelling through the badlands, he photographed two [[petroglyph]]s that most likely represent trilobites. On the same trip he examined a burial, of unknown age, with a drilled trilobite fossil lying in the chest cavity of the interred. Since then, trilobite amulets have been found all over the Great Basin, as well as in British Columbia and Australia.<ref name=\"McKay\"/>\n\nIn the 1880s, archaeologists discovered in the Grotte du Trilobite ([[Caves of Arcy-sur-Cure]], [[Yonne]], France) a much-handled trilobite fossil that had been drilled as if to be worn as a pendant. The occupation stratum in which the trilobite was found has been dated as 15,000 years old. Because the pendant was handled so much, the species of trilobite cannot be determined. This type of trilobite is not found around Yonne, so it may have been highly prized and traded from elsewhere.<ref name=\"McKay\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Paleontology|Arthropods}}\n* [[Notostraca]]\n* [[Horseshoe crab]]\n* [[Isopoda]]\n*[[List of trilobite genera]]\n*[[Evolutionary history of life]]\n\n{{Commons-inline|Trilobita}}\n{{Wikispecies-inline|Trilobita}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Citation | last = Fortey | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Fortey\n| title = Trilobite: Eyewitness to Evolution | publisher = [[Vintage Books]]\n| year = 2000 | location = New York\n| url =\n| isbn = 978-0-375-70621-9 }}\n*{{Citation | last = Lawrence | first = Pete | title = Trilobites of the World: An atlas of 1000 photographs | publisher = [[Siri Scientific Press]] | year = 2014 | location = Manchester | url = http://www.siriscientificpress.co.uk/Pages/default.aspx | isbn = 978-0-9574530-3-6 | access-date = 2014-04-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140308203643/http://www.siriscientificpress.co.uk/Pages/default.aspx | archive-date = 2014-03-08 | url-status = dead }}\n*{{Citation | last = Levi-Setti | first = Riccardo | title = The Trilobite Book: A Visual Journey | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]]\n| year = 2014 | location = Chicago\n| url = http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo17616349.html\n| isbn = 978-0-226-12441-4 }}\n\n==External links==\n*{{citation|url=http://www.trilobites.info/|title=A Guide to the Orders of Trilobite|first=Sam|last=Gon III}}.

{"title_page": "1997\u201398 OHL season", "text_new": "The '''1997\u201398 OHL season''' was the 18th season of the [[Ontario Hockey League]]. The [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] name was reactivated when they are awarded a franchise, to play in the east division. The [[Detroit Whalers]] became the [[Plymouth Whalers]]. Eighteen teams each played 66 games. The [[Guelph Storm]] won the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]], defeating the [[Ottawa 67's]].\n\n==Expansion==\n===Toronto St. Michael's Majors===\nOn August 15, 1996, the [[Ontario Hockey League]] announced that the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] would join the league as an expansion team, beginning in the 1997-98 season. The Majors would play their home games at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], in which they shared the arena with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. The Majors would join the East Division.\n\nPreviously, the Toronto St. Michael's Majors were a junior hockey franchise from 1906-1962, as they ceased operations at the conclusion of the 1961-62 season. The Majors won the [[Memorial Cup]] in [[1934 Memorial Cup|1934]], [[1945 Memorial Cup|1945]], [[1947 Memorial Cup|1947]] and [[1961 Memorial Cup|1961]].\n\nThe Majors were the first OHL franchise based out of [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]] in eight years, as their previous franchise, the [[Toronto Marlboros]], relocated to [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] following the [[1988-89 OHL season|1988-89]] season.\n\n==Rebranding==\n===Detroit Whalers to Plymouth Whalers===\nThe [[Detroit Whalers]] rebranded their team as the [[Plymouth Whalers]] during the summer of 1997. The Whalers franchise moved to the [[Compuware Sports Arena]] in [[1996-97 OHL season|1996-97]], which is located in [[Plymouth, Michigan|Plymouth]]. The team would retain their current team name and uniforms.\n\n==Realignment==\nThe newest [[Ontario Hockey League]] club, the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]], joined the East Division.

The [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] name was reactivated when they are awarded a franchise, to play in the east division. The [[Detroit Whalers]] became the [[Plymouth Whalers]]. Eighteen teams each played 66 games. The [[Guelph Storm]] won the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]], defeating the [[Ottawa 67's]].\n\n==Expansion==\n===Toronto St. Michael's Majors===\nOn August 15, 1996, the [[Ontario Hockey League]] announced that the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] would join the league as an expansion team, beginning in the 1997-98 season. The Majors would play their home games at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], in which they shared the arena with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. The Majors would join the East Division.\n\nPreviously, the Toronto St. Michael's Majors were a junior hockey franchise from 1906-1962, as they ceased operations at the conclusion of the 1961-62 season. The Majors won the [[Memorial Cup]] in [[1934 Memorial Cup|1934]], [[1945 Memorial Cup|1945]], [[1947 Memorial Cup|1947]] and [[1961 Memorial Cup|1961]].\n\nThe Majors were the first OHL franchise based out of [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]] in eight years, as their previous franchise, the [[Toronto Marlboros]], relocated to [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] following the [[1988-89 OHL season|1988-89]] season.\n\n==Rebranding==\n===Detroit Whalers to Plymouth Whalers===\nThe [[Detroit Whalers]] rebranded their team as the [[Plymouth Whalers]] during the summer of 1997. The Whalers franchise moved to the [[Compuware Sports Arena]] in [[1996-97 OHL season|1996-97]], which is located in [[Plymouth, Michigan|Plymouth]]. The team would retain their current team name and uniforms.\n\n==Realignment==\nThe newest [[Ontario Hockey League]] club, the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]], joined the East Division. Due to the Majors joining the East, the OHL moved the [[North Bay Centennials]] from the East Division to the Central Division, while the [[Erie Otters]] moved from the Central Division to the West Division.
