[[material and formal principles in theology]]}} Lutheranism advocates a doctrine of justification \"by [[Sola gratia|grace alone]] through [[Sola fide|faith alone]] on the basis of [[Sola scriptura|Scripture alone]]\", the doctrine that scripture is the final authority on all matters of faith. This is in contrast to the belief of the Roman Catholic Church, defined at the [[Council of Trent]], concerning authority coming from both the Scriptures and [[Sacred tradition|Tradition]].<ref>''Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent'', Fourth Session, Decree on Sacred Scripture (Denzinger 783 [1501]; Schaff 2:79\u201381).

To distinguish the two evangelical groups, others began to refer to the two groups as ''Evangelical Lutheran'' and ''Evangelical Reformed''. As time passed by, the word ''Evangelical'' was dropped. Lutherans themselves began to use the term ''Lutheran'' in the middle of the 16th century, in order to distinguish themselves from other groups such as the [[Anabaptism|Anabaptists]] and [[Calvinism|Calvinists]].\n\nIn 1597, theologians in [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|Wittenberg]] defined the title ''Lutheran'' as referring to the true church.<ref name=ENC3/>\n\n{{Protestantism}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Lutheranism}}\n{{See|Reformation}}\n\nLutheranism has its roots in the work of [[Martin Luther]], who sought to reform the Western Church to what he considered a more biblical foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bethanylutheranvv.org/lutherans_started.html|title=Bethany Lutheran Ministries \u2013 Home|work=Bethany Lutheran Ministries|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090502220318/http://www.biblehistory.com/Lutheran.html Lutherans], Biblehistory.com</ref>\n\n===Spread into northern Europe===\nLutheranism spread through all of [[History of Scandinavia|Scandinavia]] during the 16th century, as the monarch of [[Denmark\u2013Norway#Origins of the Union|Denmark\u2013Norway]] (also ruling [[Religion in Iceland#16th century: Protestant Reformation|Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]) and the monarch of [[Reformation in Sweden|Sweden]] (also ruling [[Religion in Finland#The Reformation|Finland]]) adopted Lutheranism.

They led [[Gustav Vasa]], elected king in 1523, to Lutheranism. The pope's refusal to allow the replacement of an archbishop who had supported the invading forces opposing Gustav Vasa during the [[Stockholm Bloodbath]] led to the severing of any official connection between Sweden and the papacy in 1523.<ref name=\"Gilbert-12\">[http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/12.html Chapter 12: The Reformation In Germany And Scandinavia], ''Renaissance and Reformation'' by William Gilbert.</ref>\n\nFour years later, at the {{illm|Diet of V\u00e4ster\u00e5s|sv|V\u00e4ster\u00e5s riksdag}}, the king succeeded in forcing the diet to accept his dominion over the national church.

While this effectively granted official sanction to Lutheran ideas,<ref name=\"Gilbert-12\"/> Lutheranism did not become official until 1593. At that time the [[Uppsala Synod]] declared Holy Scripture the sole guideline for faith, with four documents accepted as faithful and authoritative explanations of it: the ''[[Apostles' Creed]]'', the ''[[Nicene Creed]]'', the ''[[Athanasian Creed]]'', and the unaltered ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'' of 1530.<ref>N.F.

Soon, Holy Roman Imperial forces joined the battle and conquered the members of the [[Schmalkaldic League]], oppressing and exiling many German Lutherans as they enforced the terms of the [[Augsburg Interim]]. Religious freedom in some areas was secured for Lutherans through the [[Peace of Passau]] in 1552, and under the legal principle of ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (the religion of the ruler was to dictate the religion of those ruled) and the [[Declaratio Ferdinandei]] (limited religious tolerance) clauses of the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555.<ref>Fuerbringer, L., ''[https://archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia]'' [[Concordia Publishing House]]. 1927. p. 425</ref>\n[[File:Toleranzbethaus Fresach, copy Hundskirche in der Kreuzen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=|A Hundskirche replica]]\n\nReligious disputes between the [[Crypto-Calvinism|Crypto-Calvinists]], [[Philippists]], [[Sacramentarians]], [[Ubiquitarians]] and [[Gnesio-Lutherans]] raged within Lutheranism during the middle of the 16th century. This finally ended with the resolution of the issues in the ''[[Formula of Concord]]''. Large numbers of politically and religiously influential leaders met together, debated, and resolved these topics on the basis of Scripture, resulting in the Formula, which over 8,000 leaders signed. The ''[[Book of Concord]]'' replaced earlier, incomplete [[Body of Doctrine|collections of doctrine]], unifying all German Lutherans with identical doctrine and beginning the period of Lutheran Orthodoxy.\n\nIn lands where Catholicism was the state religion, Lutheranism was officially illegal, although enforcement varied. Until the end of the [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|Counter-Reformation]], some Lutherans worshipped secretly, such as at the Hundskirke (which translates as dog church or dog altar). It is a triangle-shaped [[Mass rock|Communion rock]] in a ditch between crosses in [[Paternion]], Austria. The crowned serpent is possibly an allusion to [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]], while the dog possibly refers to [[Peter Canisius]]. Another figure interpreted as a snail carrying a church tower is possibly a metaphor for the Protestant church. Also on the rock is the number 1599 and a phrase translating as \"thus gets in the world.\"<ref>This photograph is of a replica of the original Hundskirche stone.

[[Lutheran scholasticism]] developed gradually especially for the purpose of arguing with the [[Jesuits]], and it was finally established by [[Johann Gerhard]].

After a century of vitality, the Pietist theologians [[Philipp Jakob Spener]] and [[August Hermann Francke]] warned that orthodoxy had degenerated into meaningless intellectualism and [[Formalism (philosophy)#Religion|formalism]], while orthodox theologians found the emotional and subjective focuses of Pietism to be vulnerable to Rationalist propaganda.<ref name=CC426>Fuerbringer, L., ''[https://archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia]'' Concordia Publishing House. 1927. p. 426</ref> In 1688, the Finnish [[Radical Pietism|Radical Pietist]] [[Lars Ulstadius]] ran down the main aisle of [[Turku Cathedral]] naked while screaming that the disgrace of Finnish clergymen would be revealed, like his current disgrace.\n\nThe last famous orthodox Lutheran theologian before the rationalist ''Aufkl\u00e4rung'', or ''Enlightenment'', was [[David Hollatz (dogmatician)|David Hollatz]].

These councils are Nicaea (325 AD), Constantinople I (381), Ephesus (431), Chalcedon (451), Constantinople II (553), Constantinople III (680/81), and Nicaea II (787)... As Lutherans and Orthodox we affirm that the teachings of the ecumenical councils are authoritative for our churches....The Seventh Ecumenical Council, the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, which rejected iconoclasm and restored the veneration of icons in the churches, was not part of the tradition received by the Reformation. Lutherans, however, rejected the iconoclasm of the 16th century, and affirmed the distinction between adoration due to the Triune God alone and all other forms of veneration (CA 21). Through historical research this council has become better known.  Nevertheless it does not have the same significance for Lutherans as it does for the Orthodox. Yet, Lutherans and Orthodox are in agreement that the Second Council of Nicaea confirms the christological teaching of the earlier councils and in setting forth the role of images (icons) in the lives of the faithful reaffirms the reality of the incarnation of the eternal Word of God, when it states: \"The more frequently, Christ, Mary, the mother of God, and the saints are seen, the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models, and to pay these icons the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the honored and life-giving cross, and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred objects\" (Definition of the Second Council of Nicaea).}}</ref><ref name=\"Kelly2009\">{{cite book|title=Ecumenical Council|publisher=Titi Tudorancea Encyclopedia|year=1991\u20132016|url=https://www.tititudorancea.net/z/ecumenical_council.htm|quote=The Lutheran World Federation, in ecumenical dialogues with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople has affirmed all of the first seven councils as ecumenical and authoritative.}}</ref> The ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'' teaches that \"the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church\".<ref name=\"Ludwig2016\">{{cite magazine|title=Luther's Catholic Reformation|last=Ludwig|first=Alan|date=12 September 2016|magazine=The Lutheran Witness|language=English|quote=When the Lutherans presented the ''Augsburg Confession'' before Emperor Charles V in 1530, they carefully showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils and even the canon law of the Church of Rome. They boldly claim, \"This is about the Sum of our Doctrine, in which, as can be seen, there is nothing that varies from the Scriptures, or from the Church Catholic, or from the Church of Rome as known from its writers\" (AC XXI Conclusion 1).

Martin Luther was a great fan of music, and this is why it forms a large part of Lutheran services; in particular, Luther admired the composers [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Ludwig Senfl]] and wanted singing in the church to move away from the ''ars perfecta'' (Catholic Sacred Music of the late Renaissance) and towards singing as a ''[[Gemeinschaft]]'' (community).<ref>Taruskin, Richard.

Lutherans believe that the actual body and blood of Jesus Christ are present in, with and under the bread and the wine. This belief is called [[Real Presence]] or [[sacramental union]] and is different from [[consubstantiation]] and [[transubstantiation]]. Additionally Lutherans reject the idea that communion is a mere symbol or [[Memorialism|memorial]]. They confess in the ''[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]]'':\n<blockquote>[W]e do not abolish the Mass but religiously keep and defend it. Among us the Mass is celebrated every Lord's Day and on other [[s:Augsburg Confession#Article XV: Of Ecclesiastical Usages.|festivals]], when the Sacrament is made available to those who wish to partake of it, after they have been examined and absolved. We also keep traditional liturgical forms, such as the order of readings, prayers, vestments, and other similar things.<ref>''Apology of the Augsburg Confession'', Article XXIV.1</ref></blockquote>Besides the Holy Communion (Divine Service), congregations also hold offices, which are worship services without communion. They may include [[Matins in Lutheranism|Matins]], [[Vespers in Lutheranism|Vespers]], [[Compline]], and [[Easter Vigil#Lutheran churches|Easter Vigil]]. Private or family offices include the [[s:Luther's Small Catechism#HOW THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY Should Teach His Household to Bless Themselves in the Morning and in the Evening.|Morning and Evening Prayers]] from Luther's ''Small Catechism''.<ref name=daily>See [http://www.bookofconcord.com/smallcatechism.php#prayers Luther's Small Catechism, Daily Prayers]</ref> Meals are blessed with the ''[[Common table prayer]]'', {{bibleverse||Psalm|145:15\u201316|31}}, or other prayers, and after eating the Lord is thanked, for example, with {{bibleverse||Psalm|136:1|9}}.

These services were in a variety of styles, depending on the preferences of the congregation. Often they were held alongside a traditional service in order to cater to those who preferred [[contemporary worship music]]. Today, few but some Lutheran congregations have contemporary worship as their sole form of worship. Outreach is no longer given as the primary motivation; rather this form of worship is seen as more in keeping with the desires of individual congregations.<ref>Principle examples of this in the ELCA include [http://www.familyofgod.us Family of God, Cape Coral FL.], [http://www.the-well.org/ The Well, Charlotte NC], [http://www.hosannalc.org Hosanna! of Lakeville, Minnesota], and [http://www.apostleschurch.org/home.php Church of the Apostles, Seattle WA.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820204437/http://www.apostleschurch.org/home.php |date=20 August 2006 }}.</ref> In Finland, Lutherans have experimented with the {{illm|St Thomas Mass|fi|Tuomasmessu}} and [[Metal Mass]] in which traditional hymns are adapted to heavy metal. Some Laestadians enter a heavily emotional and [[religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] state during worship. The [[Lutheran World Federation]], in its Nairobi Statement on Worship and Culture, recommended every effort be made to bring church services into a more sensitive position with regard to cultural context.<ref>\"A given culture's values and patterns, insofar as they are consonant with the values of the Gospel, can be used to express the meaning and purpose of Christian worship.

Along with these, the most widely used among English speaking congregations include: ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Hymnary]]'' (1996, [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]), ''The [[Lutheran Book of Worship]]'' (1978, [[Lutheran Council in the United States of America]]), ''[[Lutheran Worship]]'' (1982, LCMS), ''[[Christian Worship Hymnal|Christian Worship]]'' (1993, [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]), and ''[[The Lutheran Hymnal]]'' (1941, [[Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America]]). In the [[Lutheran Church of Australia]], the official hymnal is the ''Lutheran Hymnal with Supplement'' of 1986, which includes a supplement to the ''Lutheran Hymnal'' of 1973, itself a replacement for the ''Australian Lutheran Hymn Book'' of 1921. Prior to this time, the two Lutheran church bodies in Australia ([[History of the Lutheran Church of Australia#Merge of UELCA and ELCA into the Lutheran Church of Australia|which merged in 1966]]) used a bewildering variety of hymnals, usually in the German language. Spanish-speaking ELCA churches frequently use ''Libro de Liturgia y C\u00e1ntico'' (1998, Augsburg Fortress) for services and hymns.

They condemned the Philippist position for [[indifferentism]], describing it as a \"unionistic compromise\" of precious Reformation theology. Instead, they held that genuine unity between Christians and real theological peace was only possible with an honest agreement about every subject of doctrinal controversy.<ref>Klug, Eugene F. and Stahlke, Otto F.

As part of [[denazification]] the Reich Church was formally done away with in 1945, and certain clergy were removed from their positions. However, the merger between the Lutheran, United, and Reformed state churches was retained under the name [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (EKD). In 1948 the Lutheran church bodies within the EKD founded the [[United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany]] (VELKD), but it has since been reduced from being an independent legal entity to an administrative unit within the EKD.\n\nPresently, Lutherans are divided over how to interact with other Christian denominations. Some Lutherans assert that everyone must share the \"whole counsel of God\" (Acts 20:27) in complete unity (1 Cor. 1:10)<ref>For a historical example, see Robert Preus, ''To Join or Not To Join''. [[North Dakota District (LCMS)|North Dakota District of The Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]], 1968.</ref> before pastors can share each other's pulpits, and before communicants commune at each other's altars, a practice termed [[closed communion|closed (or close) communion]].

These organizations together account for the great majority of Lutheran denominations. The [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod|LCMS]] and the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Canada]] are members of the ILC. The [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|WELS]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod|ELS]] are members of the CELC. Many Lutheran churches are not affiliated with the LWF, the ILC or the CELC: The congregations of the [[Church of the Lutheran Confession]] (CLC) are affiliated with their mission organizations in Canada, India, Nepal, Myanmar, and many African nations; and those affiliated with the [[Church of the Lutheran Brethren]] are especially active doing mission work in Africa and East Asia.\n\nThe Lutheran World Federation-aligned churches do not believe that one church is singularly true in its teachings. According to this belief, Lutheranism is a reform movement rather than a movement into doctrinal correctness. As part of this, in 1999 the LWF and the Roman Catholic Church jointly issued a statement, the ''[[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]]'', that stated that the LWF and the Catholics both agreed about certain basics of Justification and lifted certain Catholic [[anathema]]s formerly applying to the LWF member churches.{{Citation needed span|The LCMS has participated in most of the [[Lutheran-Roman Catholic dialogue|official dialogues with the Roman Catholic Church]] since shortly after the [[Second Vatican Council]], though not the one which produced the ''Joint Declaration'' and to which they were not invited.

As of 2019, the Forum is not a full communion organization. Similar in this structure is the [[International Lutheran Council]], where issues of communion are left to the individual denominations. Not all ILC churches have declared church-fellowship with each other. In contrast, mutual church-fellowship is part of the CELC member churches, and unlike in the LWF, this is not contradicted by individual statements from any particular member church body.\n\n[[File:L\u00e6stardianer.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|L\u00e6stadian lay preacher from [[Finnmark]], Norway, 1898|alt=]]\n\n[[Laestadianism|Laestadians]] within certain European state churches maintain close ties to other Laestadians, often called Apostolic Lutherans.

Recently, the Swedish succession was introduced into all of the Porvoo Communion churches, all of which have an episcopal polity. Although the Lutheran churches did not require this or change their doctrine, this was important in order for more strictly high church Anglican individuals to feel comfortable recognizing their sacraments as valid. The occasional ordination of a bishop by a priest was not necessarily considered an invalid ordination in the Middle Ages, so the alleged break in the line of succession in the other Nordic Churches would have been considered a violation of canon law rather than an invalid ordination at the time.

In some areas both Catholic and Lutheran churches were permitted to co-exist. Because German speaking Catholic areas were nearby Catholic leaning Christians were able to emigrate and there was less of an issue with Catholics choosing to live as [[crypto-papist]]s in Lutheran areas. Although Reformed leaning Christians were not allowed to have churches, Melancthon wrote ''[[Augsburg Confession Variata]]'' which some used to claim legal protection as \"Evangelical\" churches. Many chose to live as [[crypto-Calvinists]] either with or without the protection offered by the ''Variata'', but this did not make their influence go away, and as a result the Protestant church in Germany as of 2017 was only about ~40% Lutheran, with most of the rest being United Protestant, a combination of Lutheran and Reformed beliefs and practices.<ref name=EKD18>[https://www.ekd.de/ekd_de/ds_doc/Gezaehlt_zahlen_und_fakten_2019.pdf Zahlen und Fakte zum kirchlichen Leben 2019] Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland</ref>\n\n[[File:KirchenordnungSHA.jpg|thumb|left|[[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]] Church Order, 1543|alt=]]\nIn terms of polity, over 17th and 18th centuries the carefully negotiated and highly prescriptive [[Church Order (Lutheran)|church orders]] of the Reformation era gave way to a joint cooperation between state control and a Reformed-style blend of consistorial and presbyterian type synodical governance.

Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Englewood Cliffs, N.J., pp. 6, 140</ref> though with the exception of the early Swedish Lutherans immigrants of the New Sweden colony who accepted the rule of the Anglican bishops and became part of the established church, they now had to fund churches on their own. This increased the congregationalist dynamic in the blended consistorial and presbyterian type synodical governance. The first organized church body of Lutherans in America was the [[Pennsylvania Ministerium]], which used Reformed style synodical governance over the 18th and 19th centuries. Their contribution to the development of polity was that smaller synods could in turn form a larger body, also with synodical governance, but without losing their lower level of governance. As a result, the smaller synods gained unprecedented flexibility to join, leave, merge, or stay separate, all without the hand of the state as had been the case in Europe.\n\nDuring their 19th century persecution, Old Lutheran believers were left in a bind. Resistance to authority was disobedient, but upholding the true doctrine and right practice was also disobedient. Fortunately the doctrine of the [[lesser magistrate]] could be employed, whereby clergy could legitimately resist the state and even leave. illegal free churches were set up in Germany and mass emigration occurred. For decades the new churches were mostly dependent on the free churches to send them new ministerial candidates for ordination. These new church bodies also employed synodical governance, but tended to exclude Hegelianism in their constitutions due to its incompatibility with the doctrine of the lesser magistrates. In contrast to Hegelianism where authority flows in from all levels, Kantianism presents authority flowing only from the top down, hence the need for a lesser magistrate to become the new top magistrate.\n\n[[File:Lighthouse Lutheran Church in Freedom.jpg|thumb|Lighthouse Lutheran Church, an LCMC congregation in [[Freedom, Pennsylvania]]|alt=]]\nOver the 20th and 20th century, some Lutheran bodies have adopted a more congregationalist approach, such as the [[Protest'ant Conference]] and the [[Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ]], or LCMC. The LCMC formed due to a church split after the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America signed an [[Called to Common Mission|agreement]] with the Episcopalians to start ordaining all of their new bishops into the Episcopalian Apostolic succession. In other words, this meant that new ELCA bishops, at least at first, would be jointly ordained by Anglican bishops as well as Lutheran bishops so that the more strict Episcopalians would recognize their sacraments as valid. This was offensive to some in the ELCA at the time because of the implications this had on the [[Theology of Martin Luther#Universal priesthood of the baptized|priesthood of all believers]] and the nature of ordination.\n\nToday, some churches allow dual-rostering.<ref>For example, the single Lutheran church on the island of Guam is a member of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and the Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ. See [http://www.lutheranchurchofguam.org/blog/?page_id=890 Lutheran Church of Guam History]</ref> Situations like this one where a church or church body belongs to multiple larger organizations that do not have ties are termed \"triangular fellowship.\" Another variant are independent Lutheran churches, although for some independent churches the clergy are members of a larger denomination. In other cases, a congregation may belong to a synod, but the pastor may be unaffiliated.<ref>For example, [http://www.trinitynewhaven.com Trinity New Haven, MO] is a member congregation of the Missouri Synod even though their pastor is independent.

Soon, Holy Roman Imperial forces joined the battle and conquered the members of the [[Schmalkaldic League]], oppressing and exiling many German Lutherans as they enforced the terms of the [[Augsburg Interim]]. Religious freedom in some areas was secured for Lutherans through the [[Peace of Passau]] in 1552, and under the legal principle of ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (the religion of the ruler was to dictate the religion of those ruled) and the [[Declaratio Ferdinandei]] (limited religious tolerance) clauses of the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555.<ref>Fuerbringer, L., ''[https://archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia]'' [[Concordia Publishing House]]. 1927. p. 425</ref>\n[[File:Toleranzbethaus Fresach, copy Hundskirche in der Kreuzen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=|A Hundskirche replica]]\n\nReligious disputes between the [[Crypto-Calvinism|Crypto-Calvinists]], [[Philippists]], [[Sacramentarians]], [[Ubiquitarians]] and [[Gnesio-Lutherans]] raged within Lutheranism during the middle of the 16th century. This finally ended with the resolution of the issues in the ''[[Formula of Concord]]''. Large numbers of politically and religiously influential leaders met together, debated, and resolved these topics on the basis of Scripture, resulting in the Formula, which over 8,000 leaders signed. The ''[[Book of Concord]]'' replaced earlier, incomplete [[Body of Doctrine|collections of doctrine]], unifying all German Lutherans with identical doctrine and beginning the period of Lutheran Orthodoxy.\n\nIn lands where Catholicism was the state religion, Lutheranism was officially illegal, although enforcement varied. Until the end of the [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|Counter-Reformation]], some Lutherans worshipped secretly, such as at the Hundskirke (which translates as dog church or dog altar). It is a triangle-shaped [[Mass rock|Communion rock]] in a ditch between crosses in [[Paternion]], Austria. The crowned serpent is possibly an allusion to [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]], while the dog possibly refers to [[Peter Canisius]]. Another figure interpreted as a snail carrying a church tower is possibly a metaphor for the Protestant church.

[[Lutheran scholasticism]] developed gradually especially for the purpose of arguing with the [[Jesuits]], and it was finally established by [[Johann Gerhard]].

As Lutherans and Orthodox we affirm that the teachings of the ecumenical councils are authoritative for our churches....The Seventh Ecumenical Council, the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, which rejected iconoclasm and restored the veneration of icons in the churches, was not part of the tradition received by the Reformation. Lutherans, however, rejected the iconoclasm of the 16th century, and affirmed the distinction between adoration due to the Triune God alone and all other forms of veneration (CA 21). Through historical research this council has become better known.  Nevertheless it does not have the same significance for Lutherans as it does for the Orthodox. Yet, Lutherans and Orthodox are in agreement that the Second Council of Nicaea confirms the christological teaching of the earlier councils and in setting forth the role of images (icons) in the lives of the faithful reaffirms the reality of the incarnation of the eternal Word of God, when it states: \"The more frequently, Christ, Mary, the mother of God, and the saints are seen, the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models, and to pay these icons the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the honored and life-giving cross, and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred objects\" (Definition of the Second Council of Nicaea).}}</ref><ref name=\"Kelly2009\">{{cite book|title=Ecumenical Council|publisher=Titi Tudorancea Encyclopedia|year=1991\u20132016|url=https://www.tititudorancea.net/z/ecumenical_council.htm|quote=The Lutheran World Federation, in ecumenical dialogues with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople has affirmed all of the first seven councils as ecumenical and authoritative.}}</ref> The ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'' teaches that \"the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church\".<ref name=\"Ludwig2016\">{{cite magazine|title=Luther's Catholic Reformation|last=Ludwig|first=Alan|date=12 September 2016|magazine=The Lutheran Witness|language=English|quote=When the Lutherans presented the ''Augsburg Confession'' before Emperor Charles V in 1530, they carefully showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils and even the canon law of the Church of Rome.

Lutherans believe that the actual body and blood of Jesus Christ are present in, with and under the bread and the wine. This belief is called [[Real Presence]] or [[sacramental union]] and is different from [[consubstantiation]] and [[transubstantiation]]. Additionally Lutherans reject the idea that communion is a mere symbol or [[Memorialism|memorial]]. They confess in the ''[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]]'':\n<blockquote>[W]e do not abolish the Mass but religiously keep and defend it. Among us the Mass is celebrated every Lord's Day and on other [[s:Augsburg Confession#Article XV: Of Ecclesiastical Usages.|festivals]], when the Sacrament is made available to those who wish to partake of it, after they have been examined and absolved. We also keep traditional liturgical forms, such as the order of readings, prayers, vestments, and other similar things.<ref>''Apology of the Augsburg Confession'', Article XXIV.1</ref></blockquote>Besides the Holy Communion (Divine Service), congregations also hold offices, which are worship services without communion. They may include [[Matins in Lutheranism|Matins]], [[Vespers in Lutheranism|Vespers]], [[Compline]], and [[Easter Vigil#Lutheran churches|Easter Vigil]].

These services were in a variety of styles, depending on the preferences of the congregation. Often they were held alongside a traditional service in order to cater to those who preferred [[contemporary worship music]]. Today, few but some Lutheran congregations have contemporary worship as their sole form of worship.

As part of [[denazification]] the Reich Church was formally done away with in 1945, and certain clergy were removed from their positions. However, the merger between the Lutheran, United, and Reformed state churches was retained under the name [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (EKD). In 1948 the Lutheran church bodies within the EKD founded the [[United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany]] (VELKD), but it has since been reduced from being an independent legal entity to an administrative unit within the EKD.\n\nPresently, Lutherans are divided over how to interact with other Christian denominations.

[[North Dakota District (LCMS)|North Dakota District of The Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]], 1968.</ref> before pastors can share each other's pulpits, and before communicants commune at each other's altars, a practice termed [[closed communion|closed (or close) communion]].

These organizations together account for the great majority of Lutheran denominations. The [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod|LCMS]] and the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Canada]] are members of the ILC. The [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|WELS]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod|ELS]] are members of the CELC. Many Lutheran churches are not affiliated with the LWF, the ILC or the CELC: The congregations of the [[Church of the Lutheran Confession]] (CLC) are affiliated with their mission organizations in Canada, India, Nepal, Myanmar, and many African nations; and those affiliated with the [[Church of the Lutheran Brethren]] are especially active doing mission work in Africa and East Asia.\n\nThe Lutheran World Federation-aligned churches do not believe that one church is singularly true in its teachings. According to this belief, Lutheranism is a reform movement rather than a movement into doctrinal correctness. As part of this, in 1999 the LWF and the Roman Catholic Church jointly issued a statement, the ''[[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]]'', that stated that the LWF and the Catholics both agreed about certain basics of Justification and lifted certain Catholic [[anathema]]s formerly applying to the LWF member churches.{{Citation needed span|The LCMS has participated in most of the [[Lutheran-Roman Catholic dialogue|official dialogues with the Roman Catholic Church]] since shortly after the [[Second Vatican Council]], though not the one which produced the ''Joint Declaration'' and to which they were not invited.

As of 2019, the Forum is not a full communion organization. Similar in this structure is the [[International Lutheran Council]], where issues of communion are left to the individual denominations. Not all ILC churches have declared church-fellowship with each other. In contrast, mutual church-fellowship is part of the CELC member churches, and unlike in the LWF, this is not contradicted by individual statements from any particular member church body.\n\n[[File:L\u00e6stardianer.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|L\u00e6stadian lay preacher from [[Finnmark]], Norway, 1898|alt=]]\n\n[[Laestadianism|Laestadians]] within certain European state churches maintain close ties to other Laestadians, often called Apostolic Lutherans.

The occasional ordination of a bishop by a priest was not necessarily considered an invalid ordination in the Middle Ages, so the alleged break in the line of succession in the other Nordic Churches would have been considered a violation of canon law rather than an invalid ordination at the time.

Eastern Orthodox Laestadians are known as [[:ru:\u0423\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0437\u0435\u0442|Ushkovayzet]] (article is in Russian).<ref>[http://uralistica.com/profiles/blogs/karelskoe-religioznoe Karelian religious movement Uskhovayzet]</ref>\n\n====Eastern Europe and Asian Russia====\n[[File:Spb 06-2012 Nevsky various 06.jpg|thumb|[[Lutheran Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul]] in St. Petersburg]]\nAlthough historically Pietism had a significant influence on the understanding of the ministry among Lutherans in the Russian Empire,{{efn|See [[:ru:\u0412\u044e\u0441\u0442,_\u042d\u0434\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0434|Edward Wust]] and [[:ru:\u0412\u044e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0437\u043c|Wustism]] in the Russian Wikipedia for more on this.}} today nearly all Russian and Ukrainian Lutherans are influenced by Eastern Orthodox polity. In their culture, giving a high degree of respect and authority to their bishops is necessary for their faith to be seen as legitimate and not sectarian.<ref>[https://www.sonntagsblatt.de/artikel/kirche/ihre-gemeinde-ist-annulliert Kirche weltweit Ukraine: \"Ihre Gemeinde ist annulliert\"] 18.09.2016 by Von Helmut Frank]</ref> In Russia, lines of succession between bishops and the canonical authority between their present-day hierarchy is also carefully maintained in order to legitimize the existing Lutheran churches as present day successors of the former Lutheran Church of the Russian Empire originally authorized by Catherine the Great. This allows for the post-Soviet repatriation of Lutheran church buildings to local congregations on the basis of this historical connection.<ref>[https://logia.org/pdf-back-issues/15-1pdf-lutheranism-in-asia A New \"Old\" Lutheran Church in Asian Russia] by Alexei Streltsov, in Logia, Epiphany 2006: Volume 15, Number 1</ref>\n\n====Germany====\nIn Germany, several dynamics encouraged Lutherans to maintain a different form of polity. First, due to de facto practice during the [[Nuremberg Religious Peace]] the subsequent legal principal of [[Cuius regio, eius religio]] in the 1555 Peace of Augsburg, German states were officially either Catholic or \"Evangelical\" (that is, Lutheran under the ''Augsburg Confession''). In some areas both Catholic and Lutheran churches were permitted to co-exist. Because German speaking Catholic areas were nearby Catholic leaning Christians were able to emigrate and there was less of an issue with Catholics choosing to live as [[crypto-papist]]s in Lutheran areas. Although Reformed leaning Christians were not allowed to have churches, Melancthon wrote ''[[Augsburg Confession Variata]]'' which some used to claim legal protection as \"Evangelical\" churches. Many chose to live as [[crypto-Calvinists]] either with or without the protection offered by the ''Variata'', but this did not make their influence go away, and as a result the Protestant church in Germany as of 2017 was only about ~40% Lutheran, with most of the rest being United Protestant, a combination of Lutheran and Reformed beliefs and practices.<ref name=EKD18>[https://www.ekd.de/ekd_de/ds_doc/Gezaehlt_zahlen_und_fakten_2019.pdf Zahlen und Fakte zum kirchlichen Leben 2019] Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland</ref>\n\n[[File:KirchenordnungSHA.jpg|thumb|left|[[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]] Church Order, 1543|alt=]]\nIn terms of polity, over 17th and 18th centuries the carefully negotiated and highly prescriptive [[Church Order (Lutheran)|church orders]] of the Reformation era gave way to a joint cooperation between state control and a Reformed-style blend of consistorial and presbyterian type synodical governance. Just as negotiations over the details in the church orders involved the laity, so did the new synodical governance. Synodical governance had already been practiced in the Reformed Netherlands prior to its adoption by Lutherans. During the formation of the modern German state, ideas about the nature of authority and the best design for governments and organizations came from the philosophies [[Political philosophy of Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Elements of the Philosophy of Right|Hegel]], further modifying the polity. When the monarchy and the sovereign governance of the church was ended in 1918, the synods took over the governance of the state churches.\n\n====Western Hemisphere and Australia====\n[[File:Ministerium Hymnal.jpg|thumb|right|The Pennsylvania Ministerium published this 1803 hymnal.<ref>This website has [https://hymnary.org/hymnal/HELC1865 text and midi files] for the 1865 Pennsylvania Ministerium hymnal.</ref>]]\nDuring the period of the emigration, Lutherans took their existing ideas about polity with them across the ocean,<ref>Abdel Ross Wentz (1954), ''A Basic History of Lutheranism in America'', Philadelphia, Pa., p. 41</ref><ref>Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Englewood Cliffs, N.J., pp. 6, 140</ref> though with the exception of the early Swedish Lutherans immigrants of the New Sweden colony who accepted the rule of the Anglican bishops and became part of the established church, they now had to fund churches on their own. This increased the congregationalist dynamic in the blended consistorial and presbyterian type synodical governance. The first organized church body of Lutherans in America was the [[Pennsylvania Ministerium]], which used Reformed style synodical governance over the 18th and 19th centuries. Their contribution to the development of polity was that smaller synods could in turn form a larger body, also with synodical governance, but without losing their lower level of governance. As a result, the smaller synods gained unprecedented flexibility to join, leave, merge, or stay separate, all without the hand of the state as had been the case in Europe.\n\nDuring their 19th century persecution, Old Lutheran believers were left in a bind. Resistance to authority was disobedient, but upholding the true doctrine and right practice was also disobedient. Fortunately the doctrine of the [[lesser magistrate]] could be employed, whereby clergy could legitimately resist the state and even leave. illegal free churches were set up in Germany and mass emigration occurred. For decades the new churches were mostly dependent on the free churches to send them new ministerial candidates for ordination. These new church bodies also employed synodical governance, but tended to exclude Hegelianism in their constitutions due to its incompatibility with the doctrine of the lesser magistrates. In contrast to Hegelianism where authority flows in from all levels, Kantianism presents authority flowing only from the top down, hence the need for a lesser magistrate to become the new top magistrate.\n\n[[File:Lighthouse Lutheran Church in Freedom.jpg|thumb|Lighthouse Lutheran Church, an LCMC congregation in [[Freedom, Pennsylvania]]|alt=]]\nOver the 20th and 20th century, some Lutheran bodies have adopted a more congregationalist approach, such as the [[Protest'ant Conference]] and the [[Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ]], or LCMC. The LCMC formed due to a church split after the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America signed an [[Called to Common Mission|agreement]] with the Episcopalians to start ordaining all of their new bishops into the Episcopalian Apostolic succession. In other words, this meant that new ELCA bishops, at least at first, would be jointly ordained by Anglican bishops as well as Lutheran bishops so that the more strict Episcopalians would recognize their sacraments as valid. This was offensive to some in the ELCA at the time because of the implications this had on the [[Theology of Martin Luther#Universal priesthood of the baptized|priesthood of all believers]] and the nature of ordination.\n\nToday, some churches allow dual-rostering.<ref>For example, the single Lutheran church on the island of Guam is a member of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and the Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ. See [http://www.lutheranchurchofguam.org/blog/?page_id=890 Lutheran Church of Guam History]</ref> Situations like this one where a church or church body belongs to multiple larger organizations that do not have ties are termed \"triangular fellowship.\" Another variant are independent Lutheran churches, although for some independent churches the clergy are members of a larger denomination. In other cases, a congregation may belong to a synod, but the pastor may be unaffiliated.<ref>For example, [http://www.trinitynewhaven.com Trinity New Haven, MO] is a member congregation of the Missouri Synod even though their pastor is independent. This congregation was expelled from the Missouri Synod for a while over this, but they challenged it and got back in.</ref> In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,<ref>Due to influence from former Missourians joining the ELCA in the [[American Evangelical Lutheran Church]]</ref> the Wisconsin Synod, the Evangelical Lutheran Synod, the Church of the Lutheran Confession, and the Missouri Synod, teachers at parochial schools are considered to be clergy, with the latter defending this before the [[Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & School v.

Don Pietro Savastano is the head of a bloodthirsty Camorra branch in the [[Scampia]] neighbourhood, while Salvatore Conte is one of his subordinates who handles [[hashish]] traffic on his behalf. Due to the continuous rivalries between the two bosses, Don Pietro orders his right-hand man Ciro and Attilio to set fire to Conte's house, as a punitive act. The fire causes a series of retaliations, one of which, Ciro risks death. Don Pietro's final order is to kill Salvatore Conte and his whole clan in an ambush. Conte manages to escape and flee to Spain, while four Don Pietro affiliates, including Attilio, mentor and de facto father of Ciro, are killed. Gennaro Savastano, called Genny, is the son of the boss Pietro and his wife Imma, an immature and superficial boy. The same evening of the fire in Conte's house, Genny goes to a nightclub in Casavatore, where he falls in love with a girl, Noemi, related to a rival boss.\n| LineColor       = 594022\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Ti fidi di me?\n| Aux1            = \"Do You Trust Me?\"\n| DirectedBy      = Stefano Sollima\n|OriginalAirDate  = {{Start date|df=yes|2014|05|06}}\n| Viewers         = 3.34\n| ShortSummary    = The [[Guardia di Finanza]] manages to stop an important shipment of drugs from Honduras. Don Pietro suspects that there is a traitor inside the clan who provided information to the police. Meanwhile, Don Pietro tries to remedy the troubles created by his son Genny because the support of the Casavatore family is important to continue to manage and expand criminal business. The Casavatore boss proposes to resolve the issue through a gesture that would publicly humiliate Genny. Don Pietro reacts by ordering the death of the Casavatore boss, and also urges Genny to become a murderer in order to prove that he has grown and is ready to lead. Ciro is with Genny to teach him to kill, capturing an outcast drug addict and ordering Genny to kill him, but he does not have the will to hurt him, forcing Ciro to deliver the blow. Genny lies to his father claiming he shot him and receives a new motorcycle as a reward. In the evening, Don Pietro discovers Ciro's lie and decides to punish him, forcing him to drink his urine in a glass as well as to confirm his absolute submission and obedience. In the middle of the night, Genny rides his motorcycle at high speeds, ignoring the road signs, hit by a car and taken to the hospital. Don Pietro receives a phone call about Genny's condition and heads towards the hospital at high speed. A traffic police patrol stops him for a check, finding a bag of money and cocaine.\n| LineColor       = 594022\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = L'omm 'e casa\n| Aux1            = \"The Man of the House\"\n| DirectedBy      = Stefano Sollima\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2014|05|13}}\n| Viewers         = 2.98\n| ShortSummary    = Don Pietro is detained at the [[Poggioreale]] prison.

The Nigerian ringleader urges one of his collaborators to be deliberately arrested in order to speak and deal directly with Don Pietro in prison. Don Pietro is annoyed and angry at the requests of the Nigerians and threatens deadly consequences if the drug dealing does not resume immediately and on his terms. Don Pietro is tired of the restrictions and the rigor imposed by the prison warden. The clan's lawyer has not yet managed to find a legal pretext to release the boss. So the boss triggers a riot to intimidate the prison warden and asks the Nigerians for help, promising the increase in drug dealing profits in return. The revolt ends as soon as Don Pietro manages to obtain some privileges and the removal of some prison restrictions. In the evening the boss orders his loyalists by phone to kill all the rebel Nigerians. The ambush is performed during the night.

Imma and Genny leave for Milan again to meet the accountant Musi and get the money they need. The accountant acted without the clan's knowledge investing all the liquidity in a company that lost a million dollar contract, causing its value to collapse. Desperate, Franco Musi tries to corrupt the public official who manages the contract. The attempt fails and the accountant ends up in prison. Genny continues to be unattached from the family and thinks only of the girl, Noemi. Imma then decides to take command of the clan herself, disobeying her husband's orders. Imma gets Musi released from prison. The accountant is free and is invited to a dinner with the woman. The boss's wife announces that she wants her money back and orders the accountant to commit suicide to stop the investigation of him that could compromise the assets and the money of the Savastano clan. Imma goes to visit her husband who has been detained on 41 bis. Don Pietro tells his wife that Genny is the new Savastano boss and that he must be joined by Ciro.

Imma orders Ciro to go to Barcelona to reach a truce with Salvatore Conte, who has now become one of the major narco-traffickers in southern Europe. Genny is sent to Honduras to calm the drug producers who have not yet been paid and to form a new agreement. Ciro is at the Barcelona airport when Massimo, Salvatore Conte's personal driver, invites him to follow him. Ciro is placed in one of the most important hotels in the Catalan city and is informed that Salvatore Conte cannot currently take care of him. The next day Ciro threatens Massimo and gets to meet Salvatore Conte. Salvatore Conte has not forgotten the fire at his mother's house and leaves Ciro stranded offshore after having invited him on a yacht tour. Ciro manages to swim back to shore, and is about to leave Spain when Salvatore Conte requires him to become his spokesman to make arrangements with a Russian clan that is threatening his business, with the guarantee of a long collaboration with the Savastano clan. After closing the deal (at the price of a dramatic participation in [[Russian roulette]]), Ciro returns to Italy and discovers that Imma is distorting the clan's internal balance by taking absolute control of the local territory. Don Pietro calls his wife after learning that his will has not been respected. Imma convinces her husband to leave her in command of the clan since she herself is the only person she can truly trust and who has been with him at every moment of life.\n| LineColor       = 594022\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 7\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n| Title           = Imma contro tutti\n| Aux1            = \"Imma Against All\"\n| DirectedBy      = Francesca Comencini\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2014|05|27}}\n| Viewers         = 2.90\n| ShortSummary    = The first drug supplies arrive from Spain. Imma orders the opening of a new market for drug dealing and makes fierce competition for all the other Camorra families, which will eventually result with retaliation. Ciro receives the humiliating order to manage all the operations relating to the sale in the new square, accepting with reluctance and resentment. Imma is contacted by Marta Giacobone, a lesbian girl seeking protection after her father's death, who is suicidal due to the growing demands for money from the usurer Leccalecca. The loan shark is killed by the clan, and Marta provides the family apartment located in a strategic point for the control of the market square. There have been no reports of Genny in Honduras for two weeks. Marta is killed by two hit men and, at night, a police raid dismantles the Savastano clan's marketplace. Imma calls a summit with the heads of rival families to offer them a truce. The woman informs the other bosses that Savastano have the exclusive right to import drugs and that they are the only ones who can sell quality goods at low prices. The truce proposal states that other families will have to confide in her and submit to her conditions. During sleep, Imma is awakened by some sudden noises and a shot at home. The woman goes to the entrance and discovers that Genny, who has come back tried and deeply changed, has shot his mother's dog for having bitten him.\n| LineColor       = 594022\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 8\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n| Title           = La scheda bianca\n| Aux1            = \"The Blank Ballot\"\n| DirectedBy      = Claudio Cupellini\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2014|05|27}}\n| Viewers         = 2.72\n| ShortSummary    = Honduras has transformed Genny into a proud and violent man. Genny is intent on demonstrating to the old members of the clan that he is now the new boss and then convenes a meeting in a restaurant. When the summit is over, Genny kills the waiter, an old school friend of his just for an unhappy joke, but getting skepticism and disapproval. Ciro wants to take on an increasingly important role in the management of the clan and tries to win over Genny, but sees his ambitions destroyed when Genny tells him that there is no place for him at the top of the clan. Genny, meanwhile, intertwines a relationship with a new girl, Jessica. Genny argues with his mother and confesses that he was forced to quarter a man with a machete because he complained too much. The episode, from which he was distorted, made him a violent criminal with a yearning for omnipotence. Imma congratulates him. Genny has command of the clan and begins to assert himself through the control of politics. The city of Giugliano is considered very strategic for the clan's business and Genny wants to dominate it at all costs, despite the mayor being a faithful man to Don Pietro. Michele is a town councilor of Giugliano with a weak and maneuverable character and is also a friend of Genny. Through a series of electoral cheats and death threats, Michele becomes Giugliano's mayor, forcing out the previous mayor of Don Pietro. Ciro meditates revenge against the Savastano and begins to disseminate doubts and uncertainties among the senior members of the clan to put them against Genny. Meanwhile, Daniele, a young 16-year-old mechanic fascinated by the perverse world of the Camorra, is manipulated by Ciro to become a drug carrier in exchange for money and expensive goods.\n| LineColor       = 594022\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 9\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n| Title           = [[Gelsomina Verde]]\n| Aux1            = \"Green Jasmine\"\n| DirectedBy      = Claudio Cupellini\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2014|06|03}}\n| Viewers         = 2.94\n| ShortSummary    = Genny orders the new mayor of Giugliano to carry out a building project on which the Savastano will be able to exercise a strong hold. Tonino Russo is also involved in the project, an unscrupulous and sharp entrepreneur with Salvatore Conte. The building project is stopped due to the Romano brothers who refuse to sell the car store located in the area where the project will be carried out. Genny orders Ciro to solve the problem of the Romano brothers. Ciro summons Daniele and promotes him in the criminal organization, unbeknownst to the rest of the clan. Ciro kills the Romano brothers in the presence of Daniele, who assists for the first time in a criminal execution. The betrayal of Ciro begins to take shape on two fronts: weakening Genny's authority to unleash an internal clan feud and take advantage of a new Camorra war. Daniele receives the commission to commit his first murder, obtaining in advance, a large sum of money and an expensive motorcycle. Ciro orders Daniele the assassination of Tonino Russo, providing him with false information on the importance of the victim. Daniele is in a relationship to Manu, a 15-year-old girl. With the money he received from Ciro, Daniele gave the Manu an engagement ring decorated with a diamond crown. Daniele kills Tonino Russo and decides to spend the evening in a bar with Manu, disobeying Ciro's order to return home immediately. In the bar the TV is on and from the news Daniele learns that Tonino Russo was a leading man in the Salvatore Conte clan. Daniele is in a panic and calls Ciro who reassures him and invites him to go home to receive the rest of the reward. Daniele leaves Manu alone at the bar and returns home. Daniele arrived in front of the house and overheard Rosario discussing killing him. Fearing for his life, Daniele runs away and asks for help from Bruno, his trusted friend, who offers him a far away place to shelter for the night and takes charge of bringing Manu home. Ciro calls Daniele on his cell phone several times and finally decides to go to the bar Daniele tells him in the previous call where he meets Manu. Ciro pretends to be Bruno, Daniele's friend, and invites Manu into his car. Ciro kidnaps and tortures the girl to extort a confession about Daniel's current hiding place and eventually kills her by burning her. The next morning, Daniele moves to a new hiding place, stopping first at a diner to eat. Watching television, he discovers from the news that Manu was killed as an act of retaliation against him. Daniele calls his elder brother in despair; he does not answer, thinking it is not a major problem. Daniele's older brother is Massimo, the personal driver of Salvatore Conte, currently traveling to Naples to personally deal with the assassination of Tonino Russo. Convinced that he no longer has any way out, Daniele points his gun into his mouth.\n| LineColor       = 594022\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 10\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n| Title           = Ora facciamo i Conte\n| Aux1            = \"Now We Get Conte\"\n| DirectedBy      = Claudio Cupellini\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2014|06|03}}\n| Viewers         = 2.51\n| ShortSummary    = Genny does not suspect Ciro's betrayal at all, and in fact entrusts him with the task of finding Tonino Russo's murderer. The young boss is worried that the agreements with Salvatore Conte are compromised. Not having pressed the trigger, Daniele is still holding up in an abandoned farmhouse where his father once worked. He insistently calls his brother Massimo who continues to close the phone calls. Only after several hours Daniele manages to confess to Massimo what happened. Ciro cannot find Daniele and, fearing to be discovered, tells Genny that Tonino Russo's murderer is probably a member of the Savastano clan. Ciro decides to sacrifice Daniele to continue his plan and takes charge of delivering it to Genny. Massimo acts without lucidity to save his brother's life and tries to kill Salvatore Conte. After a brief struggle, Massimo loses, and confesses to Conte the responsibilities of his brother, deceived by Ciro. Salvatore Conte assures Massimo that his brother has nothing to fear. Massimo calls Daniele back and informs him that the problem has been solved and to wait at the farmhouse until Salvatore Conte arrives. Daniele comes out of hiding when Salvatore Conte arrives and confesses to the boss that Ciro Di Marzio ordered him to kill Tonino Russo.

Daniele's mother is seated on the first bench, alongside Imma, Genny and Ciro. The parish priest begins the religious service with an accusation against those responsible for the death of the 16-year-old Daniele. Ciro thinks that Bruno, Daniele's friend, can tell the truth and uncover the ongoing betrayal. Bruno quickly fled Italy to live in Marseille with relatives. Ciro instructs Rosario to monitor Bruno's house in case the boy returns. Massimo is later seen dead in his car as a result of his injuries from Conte. Genny convenes a meeting between the men of the old guard and the new generation of the clan. Genny wants Conte punished for killing a member of the Savastanos, and must be found immediately. The young people agree with Genny's plan, while the elderly are against it. Zecchinetta, one of the most faithful of Don Pietro, denies the hypothesis that Conte is trying to corrupt the members of the Savastano clan, stating that a new war would reduce both clans to poverty; older members except Ciro then leave the meeting. Ciro declares to Genny that he suspects Zecchinetta of playing the double game and has already allied himself with Conte. Genny takes the trap of Ciro and orders the young members to make Zecchinetta confess and then kill him. Zecchinetta is reached inside his house by Genny's boys, he is tortured and then killed. From his safe house, Conte is talking to his gang stating that his only goal is to kill Genny Savastano. The meeting is also attended by three old members of the Savastano clan ('o Baroncino, 'o Fringuello and 'o Zingaro). The old guards are furious at the attitude of the new boss and cannot stand the lack of respect from the young guard. Genny, at the suggestion of Ciro, goes to visit his father in prison to ask for advice and in the meantime he recommends the whole clan to remain calm and united. Don Pietro seems to have lost all contact with reality and is not even able to speak. Genny is shocked when he sees his father in a catatonic state. The old guards report kill Tonino \"Spiderman\", one of Genny's boys. Bruno sent a cell phone home with a conversation stored in it. His mother immediately informs Imma to listen to it. Manu, Daniele's girlfriend, had phoned Bruno at the time Ciro showed up. As the phone was still on, Ciro's voice can be heard threatening her and torturing her to find out where Daniele was. The content of the call is proof that Ciro is the traitor to the Savastano clan. Imma is aware that the revolt of the clan and the betrayal of Ciro could cost Genny's life and he decides to meet Ciro preparing for the worst. The next morning Imma asks Ciro to meet in a bar and confronts him making him listen to the phone call recorded on Bruno's cell phone. The woman accuses him of treason, also giving a way out: organising an ambush to kill Salvatore Conte and then leaving without returning to Naples. Ciro threatens Imma, but tells him that if she should die, Genny will discover his betrayal because she copied the call to a CD, entrusting it to Marina, a trusted friend, to deliver it to the family lawyer to give to Genny should she die. Imma and Marina are killed a few meters from the restaurant. Rosario takes the CD and destroys it.

'O Nano, a close friend of Ciro, shows distrust of 'o Principe, suspected of making money out of the Alliance due to his particularly luxurious lifestyle and the particularly high earnings of his square, despite being the man who brings more money to the Alliance. 'O Prince in fact leads a particularly luxurious lifestyle and does not hide his wealth; he buys luxury cars, a black panther, and buys a nail salon business for his girlfriend Azmera. 'O Principe receives a visit from a friend, 'o Mulatto, who, after perceiving the distrust of 'o Nano, convinces him, together with the support of Azmera, to procure protection and sell some of his luxury goods to keep a lower profile to attract less attention from the other members of the Alliance. Meanwhile, Patrizia no longer wants to host Don Pietro. After the warnings of 'o Mulatto, 'o Principe decides to follow his advice, getting rid of the panther from his roof, selling some of the luxury cars, and securing protection.

Don Pietro Savastano is the head of a bloodthirsty Camorra branch in the [[Scampia]] neighbourhood, while Salvatore Conte is one of his subordinates who handles [[hashish]] traffic on his behalf. Due to the continuous rivalries between the two bosses, Don Pietro orders his right-hand man Ciro and Attilio to set fire to Conte's house, as a punitive act. The fire causes a series of retaliations, one of which, Ciro risks death. Don Pietro's final order is to kill Salvatore Conte and his whole clan in an ambush. Conte manages to escape and flee to Spain, while four Don Pietro affiliates, including Attilio, mentor and de facto father of Ciro, are killed. Gennaro Savastano, called Genny, is the son of the boss Pietro and his wife Imma, an immature and superficial boy.

The Casavatore boss proposes to resolve the issue through a gesture that would publicly humiliate Genny. Don Pietro reacts by ordering the death of the Casavatore boss, and also urges Genny to become a murderer in order to prove that he has grown and is ready to lead. Ciro is with Genny to teach him to kill, capturing an outcast drug addict and ordering Genny to kill him, but he does not have the will to hurt him, forcing Ciro to deliver the blow. Genny lies to his father claiming he shot him and receives a new motorcycle as a reward. In the evening, Don Pietro discovers Ciro's lie and decides to punish him, forcing him to drink his urine in a glass as well as to confirm his absolute submission and obedience. In the middle of the night, Genny rides his motorcycle at high speeds, ignoring the road signs, hit by a car and taken to the hospital.

Don Pietro is annoyed and angry at the requests of the Nigerians and threatens deadly consequences if the drug dealing does not resume immediately and on his terms. Don Pietro is tired of the restrictions and the rigor imposed by the prison warden. The clan's lawyer has not yet managed to find a legal pretext to release the boss. So the boss triggers a riot to intimidate the prison warden and asks the Nigerians for help, promising the increase in drug dealing profits in return.

Desperate, Franco Musi tries to corrupt the public official who manages the contract. The attempt fails and the accountant ends up in prison. Genny continues to be unattached from the family and thinks only of the girl, Noemi. Imma then decides to take command of the clan herself, disobeying her husband's orders. Imma gets Musi released from prison. The accountant is free and is invited to a dinner with the woman. The boss's wife announces that she wants her money back and orders the accountant to commit suicide to stop the investigation of him that could compromise the assets and the money of the Savastano clan.

Ciro is at the Barcelona airport when Massimo, Salvatore Conte's personal driver, invites him to follow him. Ciro is placed in one of the most important hotels in the Catalan city and is informed that Salvatore Conte cannot currently take care of him. The next day Ciro threatens Massimo and gets to meet Salvatore Conte. Salvatore Conte has not forgotten the fire at his mother's house and leaves Ciro stranded offshore after having invited him on a yacht tour. Ciro manages to swim back to shore, and is about to leave Spain when Salvatore Conte requires him to become his spokesman to make arrangements with a Russian clan that is threatening his business, with the guarantee of a long collaboration with the Savastano clan. After closing the deal (at the price of a dramatic participation in [[Russian roulette]]), Ciro returns to Italy and discovers that Imma is distorting the clan's internal balance by taking absolute control of the local territory. Don Pietro calls his wife after learning that his will has not been respected.

Imma orders the opening of a new market for drug dealing and makes fierce competition for all the other Camorra families, which will eventually result with retaliation. Ciro receives the humiliating order to manage all the operations relating to the sale in the new square, accepting with reluctance and resentment. Imma is contacted by Marta Giacobone, a lesbian girl seeking protection after her father's death, who is suicidal due to the growing demands for money from the usurer Leccalecca. The loan shark is killed by the clan, and Marta provides the family apartment located in a strategic point for the control of the market square. There have been no reports of Genny in Honduras for two weeks. Marta is killed by two hit men and, at night, a police raid dismantles the Savastano clan's marketplace. Imma calls a summit with the heads of rival families to offer them a truce. The woman informs the other bosses that Savastano have the exclusive right to import drugs and that they are the only ones who can sell quality goods at low prices. The truce proposal states that other families will have to confide in her and submit to her conditions. During sleep, Imma is awakened by some sudden noises and a shot at home.

Genny is intent on demonstrating to the old members of the clan that he is now the new boss and then convenes a meeting in a restaurant. When the summit is over, Genny kills the waiter, an old school friend of his just for an unhappy joke, but getting skepticism and disapproval. Ciro wants to take on an increasingly important role in the management of the clan and tries to win over Genny, but sees his ambitions destroyed when Genny tells him that there is no place for him at the top of the clan. Genny, meanwhile, intertwines a relationship with a new girl, Jessica. Genny argues with his mother and confesses that he was forced to quarter a man with a machete because he complained too much. The episode, from which he was distorted, made him a violent criminal with a yearning for omnipotence. Imma congratulates him. Genny has command of the clan and begins to assert himself through the control of politics. The city of Giugliano is considered very strategic for the clan's business and Genny wants to dominate it at all costs, despite the mayor being a faithful man to Don Pietro. Michele is a town councilor of Giugliano with a weak and maneuverable character and is also a friend of Genny. Through a series of electoral cheats and death threats, Michele becomes Giugliano's mayor, forcing out the previous mayor of Don Pietro. Ciro meditates revenge against the Savastano and begins to disseminate doubts and uncertainties among the senior members of the clan to put them against Genny.

Tonino Russo is also involved in the project, an unscrupulous and sharp entrepreneur with Salvatore Conte. The building project is stopped due to the Romano brothers who refuse to sell the car store located in the area where the project will be carried out. Genny orders Ciro to solve the problem of the Romano brothers. Ciro summons Daniele and promotes him in the criminal organization, unbeknownst to the rest of the clan. Ciro kills the Romano brothers in the presence of Daniele, who assists for the first time in a criminal execution. The betrayal of Ciro begins to take shape on two fronts: weakening Genny's authority to unleash an internal clan feud and take advantage of a new Camorra war. Daniele receives the commission to commit his first murder, obtaining in advance, a large sum of money and an expensive motorcycle. Ciro orders Daniele the assassination of Tonino Russo, providing him with false information on the importance of the victim. Daniele is in a relationship to Manu, a 15-year-old girl. With the money he received from Ciro, Daniele gave the Manu an engagement ring decorated with a diamond crown. Daniele kills Tonino Russo and decides to spend the evening in a bar with Manu, disobeying Ciro's order to return home immediately. In the bar the TV is on and from the news Daniele learns that Tonino Russo was a leading man in the Salvatore Conte clan. Daniele is in a panic and calls Ciro who reassures him and invites him to go home to receive the rest of the reward. Daniele leaves Manu alone at the bar and returns home. Daniele arrived in front of the house and overheard Rosario discussing killing him. Fearing for his life, Daniele runs away and asks for help from Bruno, his trusted friend, who offers him a far away place to shelter for the night and takes charge of bringing Manu home. Ciro calls Daniele on his cell phone several times and finally decides to go to the bar Daniele tells him in the previous call where he meets Manu. Ciro pretends to be Bruno, Daniele's friend, and invites Manu into his car. Ciro kidnaps and tortures the girl to extort a confession about Daniel's current hiding place and eventually kills her by burning her. The next morning, Daniele moves to a new hiding place, stopping first at a diner to eat. Watching television, he discovers from the news that Manu was killed as an act of retaliation against him. Daniele calls his elder brother in despair; he does not answer, thinking it is not a major problem. Daniele's older brother is Massimo, the personal driver of Salvatore Conte, currently traveling to Naples to personally deal with the assassination of Tonino Russo.

The young boss is worried that the agreements with Salvatore Conte are compromised. Not having pressed the trigger, Daniele is still holding up in an abandoned farmhouse where his father once worked. He insistently calls his brother Massimo who continues to close the phone calls. Only after several hours Daniele manages to confess to Massimo what happened. Ciro cannot find Daniele and, fearing to be discovered, tells Genny that Tonino Russo's murderer is probably a member of the Savastano clan. Ciro decides to sacrifice Daniele to continue his plan and takes charge of delivering it to Genny. Massimo acts without lucidity to save his brother's life and tries to kill Salvatore Conte. After a brief struggle, Massimo loses, and confesses to Conte the responsibilities of his brother, deceived by Ciro. Salvatore Conte assures Massimo that his brother has nothing to fear. Massimo calls Daniele back and informs him that the problem has been solved and to wait at the farmhouse until Salvatore Conte arrives. Daniele comes out of hiding when Salvatore Conte arrives and confesses to the boss that Ciro Di Marzio ordered him to kill Tonino Russo.

Ciro thinks that Bruno, Daniele's friend, can tell the truth and uncover the ongoing betrayal. Bruno quickly fled Italy to live in Marseille with relatives. Ciro instructs Rosario to monitor Bruno's house in case the boy returns. Massimo is later seen dead in his car as a result of his injuries from Conte. Genny convenes a meeting between the men of the old guard and the new generation of the clan. Genny wants Conte punished for killing a member of the Savastanos, and must be found immediately. The young people agree with Genny's plan, while the elderly are against it. Zecchinetta, one of the most faithful of Don Pietro, denies the hypothesis that Conte is trying to corrupt the members of the Savastano clan, stating that a new war would reduce both clans to poverty; older members except Ciro then leave the meeting. Ciro declares to Genny that he suspects Zecchinetta of playing the double game and has already allied himself with Conte. Genny takes the trap of Ciro and orders the young members to make Zecchinetta confess and then kill him. Zecchinetta is reached inside his house by Genny's boys, he is tortured and then killed. From his safe house, Conte is talking to his gang stating that his only goal is to kill Genny Savastano. The meeting is also attended by three old members of the Savastano clan ('o Baroncino, 'o Fringuello and 'o Zingaro). The old guards are furious at the attitude of the new boss and cannot stand the lack of respect from the young guard. Genny, at the suggestion of Ciro, goes to visit his father in prison to ask for advice and in the meantime he recommends the whole clan to remain calm and united. Don Pietro seems to have lost all contact with reality and is not even able to speak. Genny is shocked when he sees his father in a catatonic state. The old guards report kill Tonino \"Spiderman\", one of Genny's boys. Bruno sent a cell phone home with a conversation stored in it. His mother immediately informs Imma to listen to it. Manu, Daniele's girlfriend, had phoned Bruno at the time Ciro showed up. As the phone was still on, Ciro's voice can be heard threatening her and torturing her to find out where Daniele was. The content of the call is proof that Ciro is the traitor to the Savastano clan. Imma is aware that the revolt of the clan and the betrayal of Ciro could cost Genny's life and he decides to meet Ciro preparing for the worst. The next morning Imma asks Ciro to meet in a bar and confronts him making him listen to the phone call recorded on Bruno's cell phone. The woman accuses him of treason, also giving a way out: organising an ambush to kill Salvatore Conte and then leaving without returning to Naples. Ciro threatens Imma, but tells him that if she should die, Genny will discover his betrayal because she copied the call to a CD, entrusting it to Marina, a trusted friend, to deliver it to the family lawyer to give to Genny should she die.

Genny goes to morgue to deliver the clothes with which to dress the mother and at the same time call Ciro to help him accompany the woman's coffin.

On this occasion, 'o Nano confides in 'o Track his suspicions, namely that he thinks 'o Prince secretly buys the drug from Genny, cutting it even more. However, a member who is in close contact with 'o Principe talks about the dialogue, and tells him everything. During the same night, the storefront of the nail salon owned by Azmera is shot up, and all suspicions are placed on 'o Nano. 'O Nano is excluded from the Alliance and is beaten and deprived of his own square. Ciro goes to the home of 'o Principe, and informs him of the decisions taken against 'o Nano, inviting him to a meeting. 'O Nano presents himself before all the members of the Alliance and swears that he was not responsible for the shooting at the store, publicly apologizing to 'o Principe, and thus being reinstated into the Alliance. Back in his square, 'o Nano brutally kills Manolo, to whom the Alliance had given control of the square. Meanwhile, Azmera disappears. 'O Principe, in despair, takes his assigned driver Angelino to where the panther is kept to feed it. Once stopped at the gates, the cars of Don Pietro and his men arrive, who had been informed about the movements of 'o Principe by Angelino. 'O Principe reveals to the boss that he is a man close to his son Genny, key to his operation, but Don Pietro shoots him in the head anyway, regardless of Genny's plans, interested only in his personal advantage.\n| LineColor       = 594022\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 20\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n| Title           = Divide et Impera\n| Aux1            = \"Divide and Conquer\"\n| DirectedBy      = Claudio Giovannesi\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|05|31}}\n| Viewers         = 3.60\n| ShortSummary    = Patrizia tells Don Pietro that chaos erupts within the Alliance. The members of the Alliance are in fact convinced that 'o Nano is the instigator of the killing of 'o Principe, given the disagreements previously had. The only one who tries to calm the members is Ciro, at least until there is evidence. Ciro suspects Don Pietro's intervention to destabilise the fragile balance of the clan. Ciro first speaks with Azmera to learn more details, who tells him of Angelino Sepino, that it was him who had bought 'o Principe to feed the panther. Ciro tells 'o Nano that if he is truly innocent, he must prove it in the eyes of others, and advises him to go away for a while. Fearing for his life, 'o Nano listens to Ciro's advice and prepares for departure. He greets his cronies and leaves with his wife and daughter for the Lazio coast, not too convinced that Ciro actually believes in his innocence. However, as soon as he arrives at his destination he is reached and killed on the beach in front of his daughter with his wife watching. The Alliance learns of what happened and the suspects initially fall on 'o Mulatto, a friend of 'o Principe. Ciro goes to 'o Nano's widow to get a clearer picture of the situation, but she was not able to identify the killer. Ciro decides to captured Angelino Sepino in his home; he is taken to a cemetery to be interrogated. Ciro shows no mercy to the boy's requests for forgiveness, which he says was threatened and forced. Ciro is to bury him alive and kill his girlfriend, unless he reveals the instigator of the 'o Principe murder; the boy confesses that it was Don Pietro. Ciro decides to spare Sepino's life, provided he leaves Naples and never returns. After the funeral of 'o Nano, Ciro, increasingly obsessed with the memory of his wife, takes his daughter for a walk on the beach and confesses that he brought her there because her mother died there.\n| LineColor       = 594022\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 21\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n| Title           = Sette Anni\n| Aux1            = \"Seven Years\"\n| DirectedBy      = [[Francesca Comencini]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|06|07}}\n| Viewers         = 3.15\n| ShortSummary    = Scianel proposes to Ciro that her son Lelluccio, who is about to be released from prison, be a substitute for the piazza of Spaccio.

The Alley Boys follow him on the street to take him elsewhere and kill him. Travelling by car, they are stopped at a police checkpoint that allows Lelluccio to save himself. Scianel captures 'o Track, and is tortured and killed. She then goes to Ciro and asks him to intervene against the Alley Boys, but Ciro remains neutral in the clash between the two factions. Lelluccio orders that Marinella not be touched. Marinella is convinced that he will kill her and decides to accept the help of Patrizia who provides her with the telephone number of Capa 'e Bomba to call him and, together, set a trap for her husband. They agree with the Alley Boys to kill Lelluccio to avenge their friend's death 'o Track. The Alley Boys send inexperienced hit men and they make a mistake and kill an innocent person instead. Marinella, now discovered, flees and decides to go to the police station and collaborate in order to have the protection of the authorities, denouncing Scianel for the murder of her lover Mario Cantapane. Ciro reaches Genny at the airport on his return from Honduras. Genny is informed of the situation and of the deaths of 'o Principe and 'o Nano, and of the imminent mafia war.

''Left to right:'' king, rook, queen, pawn, knight, bishop]]\n\nThe '''rules of chess''' (also known as the '''laws of chess''') are rules governing the play of the game of [[chess]]. While the exact [[origins of chess]] are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat from place to place. Today, the standard rules are set by [[FIDE]] (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. There are variations of the rules for [[fast chess]], [[correspondence chess]], [[online chess]], and [[Chess960]].\n\nChess is a two-player [[board game]] using a [[chessboard]] and sixteen [[chess piece|pieces]] of six types for each player. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The goal of the game is to [[checkmate]] (threaten with inescapable capture) the opponent's [[King (chess)|king]]. Games do not necessarily end in checkmate; players often [[#Resigning|resign]] if they believe they will lose. A game can also end in a [[draw (chess)|draw]] in several ways.\n\nBesides the basic moves of the pieces, rules also govern the equipment used, [[time control]], conduct and ethics of players, accommodations for physically challenged players, and recording of moves using [[chess notation]]. Procedures for resolving irregularities that can occur during a game are provided as well.\n\n==Initial setup==\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n|\n|rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|nd|rd\n|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl\n|rl|nl|bl|ql|kl|bl|nl|rl\n| Starting position\n}}\n\nChess is played on a [[chessboard]], a square board divided into 64 squares (eight-by-eight) of alternating color, which is similar to that used in [[draughts]] (checkers) {{harvcol|FIDE|2008}}. No matter what the actual colors of the board, the lighter-colored squares are called \"light\" or \"white\", and the darker-colored squares are called \"dark\" or \"black\". Sixteen \"white\" and sixteen \"black\" pieces are placed on the board at the beginning of the game. The board is placed so that a white square is in each player's near-right corner. Horizontal rows are called ''{{chessgloss|rank|ranks}}'' and vertical rows are called ''{{chessgloss|file|files}}''.\n\nEach player controls sixteen pieces:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; float:left;\"\n|-\n!

The pieces are placed, one on a square, as follows:\n* The rooks are placed on the outside corners, right and left edge.\n* The knights are placed immediately inside of the rooks.\n* The bishops are placed immediately inside of the knights.\n* The queen is placed on the central square of the same color of that of the player: white queen on the white square and black queen on the black square.\n* The king takes the vacant spot next to the queen.\n* The pawns are placed one square in front of all of the other pieces.\nPopular mnemonics used to remember the setup are \"queen on her own color\" and \"white on right\". The latter refers to setting up the board so that the square closest to each player's right is white {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=16\u201317}}.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Chess players in park, kiev.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Photo shows two men playing chess while two more look on.|A game in a public park in [[Kiev]], using a [[chess clock]]]]\nThe player controlling the white pieces is named \"White\"; the player controlling the black pieces is named \"Black\". White moves first, then players alternate moves. Making a move is required; it is not legal to skip a move, even when having to move is [[zugzwang|detrimental]]. Play continues until a king is [[checkmate]]d, a player [[#Resigning|resigns]], or a [[draw (chess)|draw]] is declared, as explained below. In addition, if the game is being played under a [[time control]] players who exceed their [[#Time control|time limit]] lose the game.\n\nThe official chess rules do not include a procedure for determining who plays White. Instead, this decision is left open to tournament-specific rules (e.g. a [[Swiss-system tournament|Swiss system tournament]] or [[round-robin tournament]]) or, in the case of non-competitive play, mutual agreement, in which case some kind of random choice is often employed. A common method is for one player to conceal a piece (usually a pawn) of each color in either hand; the other player chooses a hand to open, and receives the color of the piece that is revealed.\n\n===Movement===\n\n====Basic moves====\n{{col-begin|width=auto; float:right; clear:right}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n| Moves of the king\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |xx|xx|xx|\n|  |  |  |  |xx|kl|xx|\n|  |  |  |  |xx|xx|xx|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n {{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n| Moves of a rook\n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |\n|xx|xx|xx|rl|xx|xx|xx|xx\n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |\n\n}}\n{{col-end}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto; float:right; clear:right}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n| Moves of a bishop\n|xx|  |  |  |  |  |xx|\n|  |xx|  |  |  |xx|  |\n|  |  |xx|  |xx|  |  |\n|  |  |  |bl|  |  |  |\n|  |  |xx|  |xx|  |  |\n|  |xx|  |  |  |xx|  |\n|xx|  |  |  |  |  |xx|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |xx\n\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n {{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n| Moves of the queen\n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |xx\n|xx|  |  |xx|  |  |xx|\n|  |xx|  |xx|  |xx|  |\n|  |  |xx|xx|xx|  |  |\n|xx|xx|xx|ql|xx|xx|xx|xx\n|  |  |xx|xx|xx|  |  |\n|  |xx|  |xx|  |xx|  |\n|xx|  |  |xx|  |  |xx|\n\n}}\n{{col-end}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto; float:right; clear:right}}\n{{col-break}}\n {{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n| Moves of a knight\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |xx|  |xx|  |  |\n|  |xx|  |  |  |xx|  |\n|  |  |  |nl|  |  |  |\n|  |xx|  |  |  |xx|  |\n|  |  |xx|  |xx|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n {{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n| Moves of a pawn\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |rd|xx|rd|  |  |  |\n|  |  |pl|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |xx|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |xx|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |pl|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| The pawns can move to the squares marked \"<big>\u00d7</big>\" in front of them.

A piece moves to a vacant square except when {{chessgloss|capture|capturing}} an opponent's piece.\n\nExcept for any move of the knight and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is ''captured'' (or ''taken'') when an attacking enemy piece replaces it on its square (''[[en passant]]'' is the only exception). The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game.<ref>When [[promotion (chess)|promoting]] a pawn, a piece previously captured and removed from the board is often used as the \"new\" promoted piece. The new piece is nevertheless regarded as distinct from the original captured piece; the physical piece is used simply for convenience. Moreover, the player's choice for promotion is not restricted to pieces that were previously captured.</ref> The king can be put in [[check (chess)|check]] but cannot be captured (see below).\n* The [[King (chess)|king]] moves exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A special move with the king known as ''[[#Castling|castling]]'' is allowed only once per player, per game (see below).\n* A [[Rook (chess)|rook]] moves any number of vacant squares horizontally or vertically. It also is moved when castling.\n* A [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]] moves any number of vacant squares diagonally.\n* The [[Queen (chess)|queen]] moves any number of vacant squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n* A [[Knight (chess)|knight]] moves to the nearest square not on the same {{chessgloss|rank}}, {{chessgloss|file}}, or {{chessgloss|diagonal}}. (This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or moving one square horizontally then two squares vertically\u2014i.e. in an \"L\" pattern.) The knight is not blocked by other pieces: it jumps to the new location.\n* [[Pawn (chess)|Pawns]] have the most complex rules of movement:\n:* A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not yet moved, a pawn also has the option of moving ''two'' squares straight forward, provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.\n:* Pawns are the only pieces that capture differently from how they move. A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the pawn (but cannot move to those squares if they are vacant).\n: The pawn is also involved in the two special moves [[#En passant|''en passant'']] and [[#Pawn promotion|promotion]] {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=17\u201319}}.{{clear}}\n\n====Castling====\n{{Main|Castling}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto; float:right; clear:right}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n|tright\n|\n|rd|  |  |  |kd|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |kl|  |  |rl\n|Position of pieces before castling\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|\n|  |  |kd|rd|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |rl|kl|\n| Positions of the king and rook after {{chessgloss|kingside}} (White) and {{chessgloss|queenside}} (Black) castling }}\n{{col-end}}\nCastling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook, then placing the rook on the other side of the king, adjacent to it.<ref>It is not allowed to move both king and rook in the same time, because ''\"each move must be made with one hand only\"'' (article 4.1 of FIDE Laws of Chess).</ref> Castling is only permissible if all of the following conditions hold:\n* The king and rook involved in castling must not have previously moved;\n* There must be no pieces between the king and the rook;\n* The king may not currently be in check, nor may the king pass through or end up in a square that is under attack by an enemy piece (though the rook is permitted to be under attack and to pass over an attacked square);\n* The king and the rook must be on the same {{chessgloss|rank}} {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=19}}.<ref>Without this additional restriction, it would be possible to [[promotion (chess)|promote]] a pawn on the ''e'' {{chessgloss|file}} to a rook and then castle vertically across the board (as long as the other conditions are met). This way of castling was \"discovered\" by Max Pam and used by [[Tim Krabb\u00e9]] in a [[Joke chess problem#Offbeat interpretations of the rules of chess|chess puzzle]] before the FIDE rules were amended in 1972 to disallow it. See ''Chess Curiosities'' by Krabb\u00e9, see also [[:de:Pam-Krabb\u00e9-Rochade]] for the diagrams online.</ref>{{clear}}\n\n====''En passant''====\n{{Main|En passant}}\n[[File:Ajedrez captura al paso del peon.png|right|275px|alt=Three images showing ''en passant''. First, a white pawn moves from the a2-square to a4; then, the black pawn moves from b4 to a3; finally, the white pawn on a4 is removed|''en passant'']]\nWhen a pawn advances two squares from its original square and ends the turn adjacent to a pawn of the opponent's on the same {{chessgloss|rank}}, it may be captured by that pawn of the opponent's, as if it had moved only one square forward. This capture is only legal on the opponent's next move immediately following the first pawn's advance. The diagrams on the right demonstrate an instance of this: if the white pawn moves from a2 to a4, the black pawn on b4 can capture it ''en passant'', moving from b4 to a3 while the white pawn on a4 is removed from the board.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Pawn promotion====\n{{Main|Promotion (chess)}}\n\nIf a player advances a pawn to its eighth rank, the pawn is then ''promoted'' (converted) to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color at the choice of the player (a queen is usually chosen). The choice is not limited to previously {{chessgloss|capture|captured}} pieces. Hence it is theoretically possible for a player to have up to nine queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if all of their pawns are promoted. If the desired piece is not available, the player should call the {{chessgloss|arbiter}} to provide the piece {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=17\u201319}}.<ref>According to [[International Arbiter]] [[Eric Schiller]], if the proper piece is not available, an inverted rook may be used to represent a queen, or the pawn on its side can be used and the player should indicate which piece it represents. In a formal chess match with an arbiter present, the arbiter should replace the pawn or inverted rook with the proper piece {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\n===Check===\n{{Main|Check (chess)}}\n{{Chess diagram\n |tright\n |\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n |  |  |  |kd|  |bd|  |\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |nd\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n |  |  |  |  |  |kl|bl|\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n |Black's king is in check. It can get out of check by moving to an unattacked square. Black can also parry the check by moving the bishop to e5 or the knight to f4 to block the check, or by capturing the white bishop with the knight. {{nowrap|<small>{{harvcol|Harkness|1967}}</small>}}\n}}\nA king is ''in check'' when it is under attack by at least one enemy piece. A piece unable to move because it would place its own king in check (it is [[pin (chess)|pinned]] against its own king) may still deliver check to the opposing player.\n\nIt is illegal to make a move that places or leaves one's king in check. The possible ways to get out of check are:\n* ''Move'' the king to a square where it is not in check.\n* ''Capture'' the checking piece (possibly with the king).\n* ''Block'' the check by placing a piece between the king and the opponent's threatening piece {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}, {{harvcol|Polgar|Truong|2005|pp=32,103}}, {{harvcol|Burgess|2009|p=550}}.\n\nIf it is not possible to get out of check, the king is [[checkmate]]d and the game is over (see the next section).\n\nIn informal games, it is customary to announce \"check\" when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. However, in formal competitions check is rarely announced {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.\n\n===End of the game===\n\n==== Checkmate ====\n{{Main|Checkmate}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n|tleft\n|\n|  |  |  |  |kd|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |rd\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |pl|pl|\n|  |  |  |  |  |rl|kl|qd\n|White is checkmated; Black wins. <br />{{small|{{harvcol|Harkness|1967}}}}\n}}\n\nIf a player's king is placed in check and there is no legal move that player can make to escape check, then the king is said to be ''[[checkmate]]d'', the game ends, and that player loses {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=20\u201321}}. Unlike other pieces, the king is never actually captured or removed from the board because checkmate ends the game {{harvcol|Burgess|2009|p=502}}.\n\nThe diagram shows an example checkmate position. The white king is threatened by the black queen; the square to which the king could move is also threatened; it cannot capture the queen, because it would then be in check by the rook.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Resigning====\nEither player may ''resign'' at any time and their opponent wins the game. Players typically resign when they believe they are very likely to lose the game. A player may resign by saying it verbally or by indicating it on their {{chessgloss|score sheet}} in any of three ways: (1) by writing \"resigns\", (2) by circling the result of the game, or (3) by writing \"1\u20130\" if Black resigns or \"0\u20131\" if White resigns {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=21}}. Tipping over the king also indicates resignation, but it is not frequently used (and should be distinguished from accidentally knocking the king over). Stopping both clocks is not an indication of resigning, since clocks can be stopped to call the arbiter. An offer of a handshake is not necessarily a resignation either, since one player could think they are agreeing to a draw {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Draws ====\n{{Main|Draw (chess)}}\n{{Chess diagram\n|tright\n|{{harvcol|Harkness|1967}}\n|  |  |kd|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |ql|bl|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |kl|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|Black to move is in stalemate, since his king has no legal move, and is not in check.

This situation is called a [[stalemate]]. An example of such a position is shown in the adjacent diagram.\n* The game is immediately drawn when there is no possibility of checkmate for either side with any series of legal moves. This draw is often due to ''insufficient material'', including the endgames\n** king against king;\n** king against king and bishop;\n** king against king and knight;\n** king and bishop against king and bishop, with both bishops on squares of the same color (see [[Checkmate#Unusual mates]]).<ref>With a king and bishop versus a king and bishop, a checkmate is not possible if the bishops are on the same color of squares but checkmate is possible if they are on opposite colors.</ref>\n* Both players [[Draw by agreement|agree to a draw]] after one of the players makes such an offer.\n\nThe player having the move may claim a draw by declaring that one of the following conditions exists, or by declaring an intention to make a move which will bring about one of these conditions:\n* [[Fifty-move rule]]: There has been no {{chessgloss|capture}} or pawn move in the last fifty moves by each player, if the last move was not a checkmate.\n* [[Threefold repetition]]: The same board position has occurred three times with the same player to move and all pieces having the same rights to move, including the right to [[castling|castle]] or capture ''[[en passant]]''.\n\nIf the claim is proven true, the game is drawn {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=21,26\u201328}}.\n\nThe above conditions apply to allow a player to claim a draw.  Under current rules, if a player does not claim a draw, the game is automatically drawn if the same position occurs five times with the same player to move or if 75 moves are made by each player with no capture or pawn move, if the last move is not a checkmate.<ref>[https://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=208&view=article FIDE Laws of Chess, article 9.6]</ref>\n\nAt one time, if a player was able to check the opposing king continually ([[perpetual check]]) and the player indicated their intention to do so, the game was drawn. This rule is no longer in effect; however, players will usually agree to a draw in such a situation, since either the rule on threefold repetition or the fifty-move rule will eventually be applicable {{harvcol|Staunton|1847|pp=21\u201322}}, {{Harvcol|Reinfeld|1954|p=175}}.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Time control====\n{{Main|Time control}}\nA game played under [[time control]] will end as a loss for a player who uses up all of their allotted time, unless the opponent cannot possibly checkmate him (see [[#Timing|Timing]]). There are different types of time control. Players may have a fixed amount of time for the entire game or they may have to make a certain number of moves within a specified time. Also, a small increment of time may be added for each move made.\n\n==Competition rules==\nThese rules apply to games played \"{{chessgloss|over the board}}\". There are special rules for correspondence chess, blitz chess, computer chess, and for handicapped players.\n\n===Moving the pieces===\nThe movement of pieces is to be done with one hand. Once the hand is taken off a piece after moving it, the move cannot be retracted unless the {{chessgloss|illegal move|move is illegal}}. When castling, the player should first move the king with one hand and then move the rook with the same hand {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=19\u201320}}.\n\nIn the case of a [[promotion (chess)|pawn promotion]], if the player releases the pawn on the eighth rank, the player must promote the pawn. After the pawn has moved, the player may touch any piece not on the board and the promotion is not finalized until the new piece is released on the promotion square {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.\n\n=== Touch-move rule ===\n{{Main|Touch-move rule}}\nIn serious play, if a player having the move touches a piece as if having the intention of moving it, then the player must move it if it can be legally moved. So long as the hand has not left the piece on a new square, any legal move can be made with the piece. If a player touches one of the opponent's pieces then that piece must be {{chessgloss|capture|captured}} if there is a legal move that does so. If none of the touched pieces can be moved or captured there is no penalty {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=19\u201320}}.\n\nWhen [[castling]], the king must be the first piece touched.<ref>The [[United States Chess Federation]] has a variation that tournament directors can use. If a player ''intending'' to castle touches the rook first, there is no penalty. However, if castling is illegal, the touch-move rule applies to the rook. This variation does not have to be announced in pre-tournament publicity but should be announced at the start of the tournament. {{cite web|url=http://www.uschess.org/docs/gov/reports/RulebookChanges.pdf|title=Rulebook Changes}}</ref> If the player touches the rook at the same time as touching the king, the player must castle with that rook if it is legal to do so. If the player completes a two-square king move without touching a rook, the player must move the correct rook accordingly if castling in that direction is legal. If a player starts to castle illegally, another legal king move must be made if possible, including castling with the other rook {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=20}}.\n\nIf a player moves a pawn to its eighth rank, it cannot be substituted for a different move of the pawn when the player has stopped touching it. However, the move is not complete until the [[Promotion (chess)|promoted]] piece is released on that square.\n\nIf a player wishes to touch a piece with the intention of adjusting its position on a square, the player must first alert the opponent of this intention by saying ''J'adoube'' or \"I adjust\". Once the game has started, only the player with the move may touch the pieces on the board {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=19\u201320}}.\n\n=== Timing ===\n[[File:Digitalna sahovska ura2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|alt=Photo shows a digital chess clock. There are two clocks, one on each side and a button on top of each stops that clock and starts the other|Digital chess clock]]\nTournament games are played under time constraints, called [[time control]]s, using a [[chess clock]]. Players must make their moves within the time control or forfeit the game. There are different types of time controls. In some cases each player will have a certain amount of time to make a certain number of moves. In other cases each player will have a limited amount of time to make all of their moves. Also, the player may gain a small amount of additional time for each move made, either by a small increment added for each move made, or by the clock delaying a small amount of time each time it is started after the opponent's move {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=21\u201324}}.\n* If a player delivers a checkmate, the game is over and that player wins, no matter what is subsequently noticed about the time on the clock.\n* If player A calls attention to player B being out of time while player A is not out of time and some sequence of legal moves leads to B being checkmated then player A wins automatically.\n* If player A does not have the ''possibility'' of checkmating B then the game is a draw {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=28}}.\n\nThe [[United States Chess Federation]] (USCF) rule is different. USCF Rule 14E defines \"insufficient material to win on time\", that is lone king, king plus knight, king plus bishop, and king plus two knights opposed by no pawns, and there is no forced win in the final position. Hence to win on time with this material, the USCF rule requires that a win can be forced from that position, while the FIDE rule merely requires a win to be possible. (See [[Monika So\u0107ko#Rules appeal in 2008|Monika So\u0107ko rules appeal in 2008]] and [[Women's World Chess Championship 2008]] for a famous instance of this rule.)\n* If a player is out of time and also calls attention to their opponent running out of time, then:\n** If a {{chessgloss|sudden death}} time control is not being used, the game continues in the next time control period {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=23}}.\n** if the game is played under a sudden death time control, then if it can be established which player ran out of time first, the game is lost by that player; otherwise the game is drawn {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=29}}.\n\nIf a player believes that the opponent is attempting to win the game on time and not by normal means (i.e. checkmate), if it is a sudden death time control and the player has less than two minutes remaining, the player may stop the clocks and claim a draw with the arbiter. The arbiter may declare the game a draw or postpone the decision and allot the opponent two extra minutes {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=21\u201324,29}}.<ref>\n\nThe USCF does not have this exact rule. However, under USCF rules, if a player has less than two minutes left in a sudden-death time control, they may claim a draw because of \"insufficient losing chances\". If the director upholds their claim, the game is drawn. That is defined as a position in which a class C (1400\u20131599 [[Elo rating system|rating]]) player would have a less than 10% chance of losing the position to a master (2200 and up rating), if both have sufficient time {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.</ref>\n\n===Recording moves===\n{{Main|Chess notation|Algebraic chess notation}}\n[[File:SCD algebraic notation.svg|left|thumb|200px|alt=Diagram showing how squares are named \u2013 columns are a through h, rows are 1 through 8|Naming the squares in [[algebraic chess notation|algebraic notation]] ]]\n[[File:Planilha_Eisenberg_e_Capablanca.jpg|thumb|180px|A score sheet from a game by [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]], in [[descriptive chess notation|descriptive notation]]]]\n\nEach square of the [[chessboard]] is identified with a unique pair of a letter and a number. The vertical {{chessgloss|files}} are labeled ''a'' through ''h'', from White's left (i.e. the [[queenside]]) to White's right. Similarly, the horizontal {{chessgloss|ranks}} are numbered from ''1'' to ''8'', starting from the one nearest White's side of the board. Each square of the board, then, is uniquely identified by its file letter and rank number. The white king, for example, starts the game on square '''e1'''. The black knight on '''b8''' can move to '''a6''' or '''c6'''.\n\nIn formal competition, each player is obliged to record each move as it is played in a [[chess notation]] in order to settle disputes about illegal positions, overstepping time control, and making claims of draws by the fifty-move rule or repetition of position. [[Algebraic chess notation]] is the accepted standard for recording games today. There are other systems such as [[ICCF numeric notation]] for international [[correspondence chess]] and the obsolete [[descriptive chess notation]]. The current rule is that a move must be made on the board before it is written on paper or recorded with an electronic device.<ref>In a variation of the rules, a USCF director may allow players to write their move on a paper {{chessgloss|score sheet}} (but not enter it electronically) before making the move.

The player using a paper scoresheet may first make the move, and then write it on the scoresheet, or vice versa. This variation does not need to be advertised in advance.\"</ref><ref>Before this was the rule, [[Mikhail Tal]] and others were in the habit of writing the move before making it on the board. Unlike other players, Tal did not hide the move after he had written it \u2013 he liked to watch for the reaction of his opponent before he made the move. Sometimes he crossed out a move he had written and wrote a different move instead {{harvcol|Timman|2005|p=83}}.</ref>\n\nBoth players should indicate offers of a draw by writing \"=\" at that move on their score sheet {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=27}}. Notations about the time on the clocks can be made. If a player has less than five minutes left to complete all of their moves, they are not required to record the moves (unless a delay of at least thirty seconds per move is being used). The score sheet must be made available to the {{chessgloss|arbiter}} at all times.

That move must be made with the same piece if possible, because the touch-move rule applies. If the illegal move was an attempt to castle, the touch-move rule applies to the king but not to the rook. The arbiter should adjust the time on the clock according to the best evidence. If the mistake is only noticed later on, the game should be restarted from the position in which the error occurred {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=24\u201325}}. Some regional organizations have different rules.<ref>The USCF requires that only an illegal move within the last ten moves be corrected. If the illegal move was more than ten moves ago, the game continues {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.</ref>\n\nIf [[blitz chess]] is being played (in which both players have a small, limited time, e.g. five minutes) the rule varies. A player may correct an illegal move if the player has not pressed their clock. If a player has pressed their clock, the opponent may claim a win if he or she hasn't moved. If the opponent moves, the illegal move is accepted and without penalty {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=77}}.<ref>If the player has pressed their clock, the standard USCF rule is that two minutes are added to the offender's opponent's clock. An alternative USCF rule is that the opponent can claim a win by forfeit if the player has not touched a piece. If the player has left their king in check, the opponent may touch the piece that is giving check, remove the opponent's king, and claim a win {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.</ref>\n\nAccording to the FIDE Laws of Chess, the first completed illegal move is penalized by awarding the opponent two additional minutes on the clock. The second completed illegal move by the same player results in the loss of the game, unless the position is such that it is impossible for the opponent to win by any series of legal moves (e.g. if the opponent has a [[bare king]]) in which case the game is drawn.<ref>[http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=171&view=article FIDE Laws of Chess], article 7.5.b</ref> A move is completed when it has been made and the player has pressed the clock.<ref>FIDE Laws of Chess, article 6.2.a</ref> In rapid chess and blitz chess, the first completed illegal move results in a loss.<ref>FIDE Laws of Chess, article A.4.b</ref>\n\n====Illegal position====\nIf it is discovered during the game that the starting position was incorrect, the game is restarted. If it is discovered during the game that the board is oriented incorrectly, the game is continued with the pieces transferred to a correctly oriented board. If the game starts with the colors of the pieces reversed, the game continues (unless the arbiter rules otherwise) {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=24}}. Some regional organizations have different rules.<ref>The USCF rules are different. If before Black's tenth move is completed it is discovered that the initial position was wrong or that the colors were reversed, the game is restarted with the correct initial position and colors. If the discovery is made after the tenth move, the game continues {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.</ref>\n\nIf a player knocks over pieces, it is their responsibility to restore them to their correct position on their time. If it is discovered that an illegal move has been made, or that pieces have been displaced, the game is restored to the position before the irregularity. If that position cannot be determined, the game is restored to the last known correct position {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=24\u201325}}.\n\n===Conduct===\nPlayers may not use any notes, outside sources of information (including computers), or advice from other people. Analysis on another board is not permitted. Scoresheets are to record objective facts about the game only, such as time on the clock or draw offers. Players may not leave the competition area without permission of the arbiter {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=30\u201331}}.\n\nHigh standards of etiquette and ethics are expected. Players should shake hands before and after the game. Generally a player should not speak during the game, except to offer a draw, resign, or to call attention to an irregularity. An announcement of \"check\" is commonly made in informal games but is not recommended in officially sanctioned games. A player may not distract or annoy another player by any means, including repeatedly offering a draw {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=30\u201331,49\u201352}}.\n\nDue to increasing concerns about the use of [[chess engine]]s and outside communication, [[mobile phone]] usage is banned. The first forfeit by a high-profile player, for their phone ringing during play, occurred in 2003.<ref>[https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/chess-1-1295070 \"I just called to say... you\u2019re disqualified!\"], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 19 October 2003</ref> In 2014 FIDE extended this to ban all mobile phones from the playing area during chess competitions, under penalty of forfeiture of the game or even expulsion from the tournament. However, the rules also allow for less rigid enforcement in amateur events.<ref name=\"chessbase-anti-cheating\">[http://en.chessbase.com/post/new-fide-anti-cheating-rules New FIDE anti-cheating rules], ChessBase, 17 September 2014</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Main|Chess piece|Chessboard|Staunton chess set|Chess clock}}\n[[Image:Staunton chess set.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=This photo shows a chessboard with pieces set up on both sides, ready to play. A chess clock is at the side.| Pieces at the start of a game and an analog [[chess clock]]]]\n\nThe size of the squares of the [[chessboard]] should be approximately 1.25 to 1.3 times the diameter of the base of the king, or 50 to 65&nbsp;mm. Squares of approximately 57&nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|1|4}}&nbsp;inches) normally are well-suited for pieces with the kings in the preferred size range. The darker squares are usually brown or green and the lighter squares are off-white or [[buff (colour)|buff]].\n\n[[File:JaquesCookStaunton.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|thumb|alt=A photo of the original Staunton chess pieces from about 1849.|Original Staunton chess pieces, introduced in 1849.

They are often black and white; other colors may be used (like a dark wood or even red for the dark pieces) but they would still be called the \"white\" and \"black\" pieces (see [[White and Black in chess]]). The height of the king should be 85 to 105&nbsp;millimetres (3.35\u20134.13&nbsp;inches).<ref>The 1988 and 2006 FIDE rules specify 85\u2013105&nbsp;mm;{{harvcol|FIDE|1989|p=121}} the 2008 rules simply say \"about 95&nbsp;mm\".</ref> A height of approximately 95 to 102&nbsp;mm ({{frac|3|3|4}}\u20134&nbsp;inches) is preferred by most players. The diameter of the king should be 40 to 50% of its height. The size of the other pieces should be in proportion to the king. The pieces should be well balanced {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.<ref>The US Chess Federation allows the height of the king to be 86\u2013114&nbsp;mm ({{frac|3|3|8}}\u2013{{frac|4|1|2}}&nbsp;inches) {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.</ref>\n\nIn games subject to [[time control]], a [[chess clock]] is used, consisting of two adjacent clocks and buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, such that the two component clocks never run simultaneously. The clock can be [[Analog clock|analog]] or [[Clock#Digital clocks|digital]] though a digital clock is highly preferred under both USCF and FIDE rulesets. This is since most tournaments now include either a time [[Bronstein delay|delay]] (a countdown to when a clock starts again) or [[Fischer delay|add]] (extra time being added prior or after the move) to their time controls. Before the start of the game, either the arbiter decides, or whoever is playing Black, where the chess clock is placed.\n\n==History==\nThe rules of chess have evolved much over the centuries from the early chess-like games played in India in the 6th century. For much of that time the rules have varied from area to area. The modern rules first took form in Italy during the 13th century, giving more mobility to pieces that previously had more restricted movement (such as the queen and bishop). Such modified rules entered into an accepted form during the late 15th century {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|pp=41,328}} or early 16th century {{harvcol|Ruch|2004}}. The basic moves of the king, rook, and knight are unchanged. Pawns originally did not have the option of moving two squares on their first move and promoted only to a queen if they reached the eighth rank. The queen was originally the ''[[ferz (chess)|fers]]'' or ''farzin'', which could move one square diagonally in any direction. In European chess it became able to leap two squares diagonally, forwards, backwards, or to left or right on its first move; some areas also gave this right to a newly promoted pawn. In the Persian and Arabic game the bishop was a ''p\u012bl'' (Persian) or ''[[alfil (chess)|f\u012bl]]'' (Arabic) (meaning \"elephant\") which moved two squares diagonally with jump {{harvcol|Davidson|1949|p=13}}. In the Middle Ages the pawn could only be [[promotion (chess)|promoted]] to the equivalent of a queen (which at that time was the weakest piece) if it reached its eighth rank {{harvcol|Davidson|1949|pp=59\u201361}}. During the 12th century the squares on the board sometimes alternated colors, and this became the standard in the 13th century {{harvcol|Davidson|1949|p=146}}; whence the word \"chequered\"/\"checkered\".\n[[Image:Andr\u00e9 Philidor.jpg|right|thumb|175px|alt=An image of Philidor, who published rules in 1749|Philidor]]\nBetween 1200 and 1600 several laws emerged that drastically altered the game. Checkmate became a requirement to win; a player could not win by capturing all of the opponent's pieces. [[Stalemate]] was added, although the outcome has changed several times (see [[Stalemate#History of the stalemate rule|History of the stalemate rule]]). Pawns gained the option of moving two squares on their first move, and the ''[[en passant]]'' rule was a natural consequence of that new option. The king and rook acquired the right to [[castling|castle]] (see [[Castling#Variations throughout history|Variations throughout history of castling]] for different versions of the rule).\n\nBetween 1475 and 1500 the queen and the bishop also acquired their current moves, which made them much stronger pieces<ref>''[[A History of Chess]]''</ref> {{harvcol|Davidson|1949|pp=14\u201317}}. When all of these changes were accepted the game was in essentially its modern form {{harvcol|Davidson|1949|pp=14\u201317}}.\n\nThe rules for pawn promotion have changed several times. As stated above, originally the pawn could only be promoted to the queen, which at that time was a weak piece. When the queen acquired its current move and became the most powerful piece, the pawn could then be promoted to a queen or a rook, bishop, or knight. In the 18th century rules allowed only the promotion to a piece already captured, e.g. the rules published in 1749 by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Danican Philidor]]. In the 19th century this restriction was lifted, which allowed for a player to have more than one queen, e.g. the 1828 rules by [[Jacob Sarratt]] {{harvcol|Davidson|1949|pp=59\u201361}}.\n\nTwo new rules concerning draws were introduced, each of which have changed through the years:\n* The [[threefold repetition]] rule was added, although at some times up to six repetitions have been required, and the exact conditions have been specified more clearly (see [[Threefold repetition#History]]).\n* The [[fifty-move rule]] was also added. At various times, the number of moves required was different, such as 24, 60, 70, or 75. For several years in the 20th century, the standard fifty moves was extended to one hundred moves for a few specific [[Chess endgame|endgames]] (see [[fifty-move rule#History|Fifty-move rule's history]]).\n\nAnother group of new laws included (1) the [[touch-move rule]] and the accompanying \"j'adoube/adjust\" rule; (2) that White moves first (in 1889<ref>[http://www.chess-math.org/scholarsmate/ ''Scholar's Mate'' issue 102]</ref>); (3) the orientation of the board; (4) the procedure if an illegal move was made; (5) the procedure if the king had been left in check for some moves; and (6) issues regarding the behavior of players and spectators. The [[Staunton chess set]] was introduced in 1849 and it became the standard style of pieces. The size of pieces and squares of the board was standardized {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|pp=220\u201321, ''laws, history of''}}.\n\nUntil the middle of the 19th century, chess games were played without any time limit. In an 1834 match between [[Alexander McDonnell]] and [[Louis-Charles Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais]], McDonnell took an inordinate amount of time to move, sometimes up to 1\u00bd hours. In 1836 [[Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant]] suggested a time limit, but no action was taken. At the [[London 1851 chess tournament|1851 London tournament]], Staunton blamed his loss in his match against [[Elijah Williams (chess player)|Elijah Williams]]  on Williams' slow play; one game was adjourned for the day after only 29 moves.<ref>Howard Staunton, ''The Chess Tournament \u2013 A Collection of Games Played at this Celebrated Assemblage'', London 1852, p. 161</ref> The next year a match between [[Daniel Harrwitz]] and [[Johann L\u00f6wenthal]] used a limit of 20 minutes per move. The first use of a modern-style time limit was in an 1861 match between [[Adolph Anderssen]] and [[Ign\u00e1c Kolisch]] {{harvcol|Sunnucks|1970|p=459}}.\n\n===Codification===\n{{multiple image |total_width = 340\n |image1 = FIDE rulebook.jpg\n |width1 = 312 |height1 = 510\n |caption1 = FIDE rulebook, 1989\n |image2 = OfficialChessRulebook.jpg\n |width2 = 320 |height2 = 499\n |caption2 = ''Official Chess Rulebook'', by Harkness (1970 edition)\n}}\nThe first known publication of chess rules was in a book by [[Luis Ram\u00edrez de Lucena]] about 1497, shortly after the movement of the queen, bishop, and pawn were changed to their modern form {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}. [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Segura]] gave rules of chess in his 1561 book [[Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del axedrez]] {{harvcol|Sunnucks|1970|p=294}}. In the 16th and 17th centuries, there were local differences concerning rules such as castling, pawn promotion, stalemate, and ''en passant''. Some of these differences persisted until the 19th century {{Harvcol|Harkness|1967|p=3}}; for example differences in castling rules persisted in Italy until the late 19th century.\n\nAs chess clubs arose and tournaments became common, there was a need to formalize the rules. In 1749 [[Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Danican Philidor|Philidor]] (1726\u20131795) wrote a set of rules that were widely used, as well as rules by later writers such as the 1828 rules by [[Jacob Sarratt]] (1772\u20131819) and rules by George Walker (1803\u20131879)<!-- not any of the George Walkers with articles-->. In the 19th century, many major clubs published their own rules, including The Hague in 1803, London in 1807, Paris in 1836, and St. Petersburg in 1854. In 1851 [[Howard Staunton]] (1810\u20131874) called for a \"Constituent Assembly for Remodeling the Laws of Chess\" and proposals by [[Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa]] (1818\u20131889) were published in 1854. Staunton had published rules in ''Chess Player's Handbook'' in 1847, and his new proposals were published in 1860 in ''Chess Praxis''; they were generally accepted in English-speaking countries. German-speaking countries usually used the writings of chess authority [[Johann Berger]] (1845\u20131933) or ''[[Handbuch des Schachspiels]]'' by [[Paul Rudolf von Bilguer]] (1815\u20131840), first published in 1843.\n\nIn 1924, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs ([[FIDE]]) was formed and in 1929 it took up the task of standardizing the rules. At first FIDE tried to establish a universal set of rules, but translations to various languages differed slightly. Although FIDE rules were used for international competition under their control, some countries continued to use their own rules internally {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|pp=220\u201321}}. In 1952 FIDE created the Permanent Commission for the Rules of Chess (also known as the Rules Commission) and published a new edition of the rules. The third official edition of the laws was published in 1966. The first three editions of the rules were published in French, with that as the official version. In 1974 FIDE published the English version of the rules (which was based on an authorized 1955 translation). With that edition, English became the official language of the rules. Another edition was published in 1979. Throughout this time, ambiguities in the laws were handled by frequent interpretations that the Rules Commission published as supplements and amendments. In 1982 the Rules Commission rewrote the laws to incorporate the interpretations and amendments {{harvcol|FIDE|1989|pp=7\u20138}}. In 1984 FIDE abandoned the idea of a universal set of laws, although FIDE rules are the standard for high-level play {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|pp=220\u201321}}. With the 1984 edition, FIDE implemented a four-year moratorium between changes to the rules. Other editions were issued in 1988 and 1992 {{harvcol|FIDE|1989|p=5}}, {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.\n\nThe rules of national FIDE affiliates (such as the [[United States Chess Federation]], or USCF) are based on the FIDE rules, with slight variations {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.<ref>Schiller states that the United States is the only country that does not follow the FIDE rules. Some of the differences in the [[United States Chess Federation|US Chess Federation]] rules are (1) a player must have a reasonably complete {{chessgloss|score sheet}} to claim a time forfeit and (2) the player can choose whether or not to use a clock with a delay period for each move {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=123\u201324}}. Some other differences are noted above.</ref> [[Kenneth Harkness]] published popular rulebooks in the United States starting in 1956, and the USCF continues to publish rulebooks for use in tournaments it sanctions.\n\nIn 2008, FIDE added the variant [[Chess960]] to the appendix of the \"Laws of Chess\". Chess960 uses a random initial set-up of main pieces, with the conditions that the king is placed somewhere between the two rooks, and bishops on opposite-color squares. The castling rules are extended to cover all these positions.<ref>[http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=125&view=article FIDE Handbook E.I.01B.

''Left to right:'' king, rook, queen, pawn, knight, bishop]]\n\nThe '''rules of chess''' (also known as the '''laws of chess''') are rules governing the play of the game of [[chess]]. While the exact [[origins of chess]] are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat from place to place. Today, the standard rules are set by [[FIDE]] (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. There are variations of the rules for [[fast chess]], [[correspondence chess]], [[online chess]], and [[Chess960]].\n\nChess is a two-player [[board game]] utilizing a [[chessboard]] and sixteen [[chess piece|pieces]] of six types for each player. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The goal of the game is to [[checkmate]] (threaten with inescapable capture) the opponent's [[King (chess)|king]]. Games do not necessarily end in checkmate; players often [[#Resigning|resign]] if they believe they will lose. A game can also end in a [[draw (chess)|draw]] in several ways.\n\nBesides the basic moves of the pieces, rules also govern the equipment used, [[time control]], conduct and ethics of players, accommodations for physically challenged players, and recording of moves using [[chess notation]]. Procedures for resolving irregularities that can occur during a game are provided as well.\n\n==Initial setup==\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n|\n|rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|nd|rd\n|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl\n|rl|nl|bl|ql|kl|bl|nl|rl\n| Starting position\n}}\n\nChess is played on a [[chessboard]], a square board divided into 64 squares (eight-by-eight) of alternating color, which is similar to that used in [[draughts]] (checkers) {{harvcol|FIDE|2008}}. No matter what the actual colors of the board, the lighter-colored squares are called \"light\" or \"white\", and the darker-colored squares are called \"dark\" or \"black\". Sixteen \"white\" and sixteen \"black\" pieces are placed on the board at the beginning of the game. The board is placed so that a white square is in each player's near-right corner. Horizontal rows are called ''{{chessgloss|rank|ranks}}'' and vertical rows are called ''{{chessgloss|file|files}}''.\n\nEach player controls sixteen pieces:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; float:left;\"\n|-\n! Piece !! [[King (chess)|King]] !! [[Queen (chess)|Queen]] !! [[Rook (chess)|Rook]] !! [[Bishop (chess)|Bishop]] !! [[Knight (chess)|Knight]] !! [[Pawn (chess)|Pawn]]\n|-\n!

The pieces are placed, one on a square, as follows:\n* The rooks are placed on the outside corners, right and left edge.\n* The knights are placed immediately inside of the rooks.\n* The bishops are placed immediately inside of the knights.\n* The queen is placed on the central square of the same color of that of the player: white queen on the white square and black queen on the black square.\n* The king takes the vacant spot next to the queen.\n* The pawns are placed one square in front of all of the other pieces.\nPopular mnemonics used to remember the setup are \"queen on her own color\" and \"white on right\". The latter refers to setting up the board so that the square closest to each player's right is white {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=16\u201317}}.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Chess players in park, kiev.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Photo shows two men playing chess while two more look on.|A game in a public park in [[Kiev]], using a [[chess clock]]]]\nThe player controlling the white pieces is named \"White\"; the player controlling the black pieces is named \"Black\". White moves first, then players alternate moves. Making a move is required; it is not legal to skip a move, even when having to move is [[zugzwang|detrimental]]. Play continues until a king is [[checkmate]]d, a player [[#Resigning|resigns]], or a [[draw (chess)|draw]] is declared, as explained below. In addition, if the game is being played under a [[time control]] players who exceed their [[#Time control|time limit]] lose the game.\n\nThe official chess rules do not include a procedure for determining who plays White. Instead, this decision is left open to tournament-specific rules (e.g. a [[Swiss-system tournament|Swiss system tournament]] or [[round-robin tournament]]) or, in the case of non-competitive play, mutual agreement, in which case some kind of random choice is often employed. A common method is for one player to conceal a piece (usually a pawn) of each color in either hand; the other player chooses a hand to open, and receives the color of the piece that is revealed.\n\n===Movement===\n\n====Basic moves====\n{{col-begin|width=auto; float:right; clear:right}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n| Moves of the king\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |xx|xx|xx|\n|  |  |  |  |xx|kl|xx|\n|  |  |  |  |xx|xx|xx|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n {{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n| Moves of a rook\n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |\n|xx|xx|xx|rl|xx|xx|xx|xx\n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |\n\n}}\n{{col-end}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto; float:right; clear:right}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n| Moves of a bishop\n|xx|  |  |  |  |  |xx|\n|  |xx|  |  |  |xx|  |\n|  |  |xx|  |xx|  |  |\n|  |  |  |bl|  |  |  |\n|  |  |xx|  |xx|  |  |\n|  |xx|  |  |  |xx|  |\n|xx|  |  |  |  |  |xx|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |xx\n\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n {{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n| Moves of the queen\n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |xx\n|xx|  |  |xx|  |  |xx|\n|  |xx|  |xx|  |xx|  |\n|  |  |xx|xx|xx|  |  |\n|xx|xx|xx|ql|xx|xx|xx|xx\n|  |  |xx|xx|xx|  |  |\n|  |xx|  |xx|  |xx|  |\n|xx|  |  |xx|  |  |xx|\n\n}}\n{{col-end}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto; float:right; clear:right}}\n{{col-break}}\n {{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n| Moves of a knight\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |xx|  |xx|  |  |\n|  |xx|  |  |  |xx|  |\n|  |  |  |nl|  |  |  |\n|  |xx|  |  |  |xx|  |\n|  |  |xx|  |xx|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n {{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n| Moves of a pawn\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |rd|xx|rd|  |  |  |\n|  |  |pl|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |xx|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |xx|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |pl|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| The pawns can move to the squares marked \"<big>\u00d7</big>\" in front of them.

A piece moves to a vacant square except when {{chessgloss|capture|capturing}} an opponent's piece.\n\nExcept for any move of the knight and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is ''captured'' (or ''taken'') when an attacking enemy piece replaces it on its square (''[[en passant]]'' is the only exception). The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game.<ref>When [[promotion (chess)|promoting]] a pawn, a piece previously captured and removed from the board is often used as the \"new\" promoted piece. The new piece is nevertheless regarded as distinct from the original captured piece; the physical piece is used simply for convenience. Moreover, the player's choice for promotion is not restricted to pieces that were previously captured.</ref> The king can be put in [[check (chess)|check]] but cannot be captured (see below).\n* The [[King (chess)|king]] moves exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A special move with the king known as ''[[#Castling|castling]]'' is allowed only once per player, per game (see below).\n* A [[Rook (chess)|rook]] moves any number of vacant squares horizontally or vertically. It also is moved when castling.\n* A [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]] moves any number of vacant squares diagonally.\n* The [[Queen (chess)|queen]] moves any number of vacant squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n* A [[Knight (chess)|knight]] moves to the nearest square not on the same {{chessgloss|rank}}, {{chessgloss|file}}, or {{chessgloss|diagonal}}. (This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or moving one square horizontally then two squares vertically\u2014i.e. in an \"L\" pattern.) The knight is not blocked by other pieces: it jumps to the new location.\n* [[Pawn (chess)|Pawns]] have the most complex rules of movement:\n:* A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not yet moved, a pawn also has the option of moving ''two'' squares straight forward, provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.\n:* Pawns are the only pieces that capture differently from how they move. A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the pawn (but cannot move to those squares if they are vacant).\n: The pawn is also involved in the two special moves [[#En passant|''en passant'']] and [[#Pawn promotion|promotion]] {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=17\u201319}}.{{clear}}\n\n====Castling====\n{{Main|Castling}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto; float:right; clear:right}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n|tright\n|\n|rd|  |  |  |kd|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |kl|  |  |rl\n|Position of pieces before castling\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|\n|  |  |kd|rd|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |rl|kl|\n| Positions of the king and rook after {{chessgloss|kingside}} (White) and {{chessgloss|queenside}} (Black) castling }}\n{{col-end}}\nCastling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook, then placing the rook on the other side of the king, adjacent to it.<ref>It is not allowed to move both king and rook in the same time, because ''\"each move must be made with one hand only\"'' (article 4.1 of FIDE Laws of Chess).</ref> Castling is only permissible if all of the following conditions hold:\n* The king and rook involved in castling must not have previously moved;\n* There must be no pieces between the king and the rook;\n* The king may not currently be in check, nor may the king pass through or end up in a square that is under attack by an enemy piece (though the rook is permitted to be under attack and to pass over an attacked square);\n* The king and the rook must be on the same {{chessgloss|rank}} {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=19}}.<ref>Without this additional restriction, it would be possible to [[promotion (chess)|promote]] a pawn on the ''e'' {{chessgloss|file}} to a rook and then castle vertically across the board (as long as the other conditions are met). This way of castling was \"discovered\" by Max Pam and used by [[Tim Krabb\u00e9]] in a [[Joke chess problem#Offbeat interpretations of the rules of chess|chess puzzle]] before the FIDE rules were amended in 1972 to disallow it. See ''Chess Curiosities'' by Krabb\u00e9, see also [[:de:Pam-Krabb\u00e9-Rochade]] for the diagrams online.</ref>{{clear}}\n\n====''En passant''====\n{{Main|En passant}}\n[[File:Ajedrez captura al paso del peon.png|right|275px|alt=Three images showing ''en passant''. First, a white pawn moves from the a2-square to a4; then, the black pawn moves from b4 to a3; finally, the white pawn on a4 is removed|''en passant'']]\nWhen a pawn advances two squares from its original square and ends the turn adjacent to a pawn of the opponent's on the same {{chessgloss|rank}}, it may be captured by that pawn of the opponent's, as if it had moved only one square forward. This capture is only legal on the opponent's next move immediately following the first pawn's advance. The diagrams on the right demonstrate an instance of this: if the white pawn moves from a2 to a4, the black pawn on b4 can capture it ''en passant'', moving from b4 to a3 while the white pawn on a4 is removed from the board.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Pawn promotion====\n{{Main|Promotion (chess)}}\n\nIf a player advances a pawn to its eighth rank, the pawn is then ''promoted'' (converted) to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color at the choice of the player (a queen is usually chosen). The choice is not limited to previously {{chessgloss|capture|captured}} pieces. Hence it is theoretically possible for a player to have up to nine queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if all of their pawns are promoted. If the desired piece is not available, the player should call the {{chessgloss|arbiter}} to provide the piece {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=17\u201319}}.<ref>According to [[International Arbiter]] [[Eric Schiller]], if the proper piece is not available, an inverted rook may be used to represent a queen, or the pawn on its side can be used and the player should indicate which piece it represents. In a formal chess match with an arbiter present, the arbiter should replace the pawn or inverted rook with the proper piece {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\n===Check===\n{{Main|Check (chess)}}\n{{Chess diagram\n |tright\n |\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n |  |  |  |kd|  |bd|  |\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |nd\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n |  |  |  |  |  |kl|bl|\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n |Black's king is in check. It can get out of check by moving to an unattacked square. Black can also parry the check by moving the bishop to e5 or the knight to f4 to block the check, or by capturing the white bishop with the knight. {{nowrap|<small>{{harvcol|Harkness|1967}}</small>}}\n}}\nA king is ''in check'' when it is under attack by at least one enemy piece. A piece unable to move because it would place its own king in check (it is [[pin (chess)|pinned]] against its own king) may still deliver check to the opposing player.\n\nIt is illegal to make a move that places or leaves one's king in check. The possible ways to get out of check are:\n* ''Move'' the king to a square where it is not in check.\n* ''Capture'' the checking piece (possibly with the king).\n* ''Block'' the check by placing a piece between the king and the opponent's threatening piece {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}, {{harvcol|Polgar|Truong|2005|pp=32,103}}, {{harvcol|Burgess|2009|p=550}}.\n\nIf it is not possible to get out of check, the king is [[checkmate]]d and the game is over (see the next section).\n\nIn informal games, it is customary to announce \"check\" when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. However, in formal competitions check is rarely announced {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.\n\n===End of the game===\n\n==== Checkmate ====\n{{Main|Checkmate}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n|tleft\n|\n|  |  |  |  |kd|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |rd\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |pl|pl|\n|  |  |  |  |  |rl|kl|qd\n|White is checkmated; Black wins. <br />{{small|{{harvcol|Harkness|1967}}}}\n}}\n\nIf a player's king is placed in check and there is no legal move that player can make to escape check, then the king is said to be ''[[checkmate]]d'', the game ends, and that player loses {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=20\u201321}}. Unlike other pieces, the king is never actually captured or removed from the board because checkmate ends the game {{harvcol|Burgess|2009|p=502}}.\n\nThe diagram shows an example checkmate position. The white king is threatened by the black queen; the square to which the king could move is also threatened; it cannot capture the queen, because it would then be in check by the rook.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Resigning====\nEither player may ''resign'' at any time and their opponent wins the game. Players typically resign when they believe they are very likely to lose the game. A player may resign by saying it verbally or by indicating it on their {{chessgloss|score sheet}} in any of three ways: (1) by writing \"resigns\", (2) by circling the result of the game, or (3) by writing \"1\u20130\" if Black resigns or \"0\u20131\" if White resigns {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=21}}. Tipping over the king also indicates resignation, but it is not frequently used (and should be distinguished from accidentally knocking the king over). Stopping both clocks is not an indication of resigning, since clocks can be stopped to call the arbiter. An offer of a handshake is not necessarily a resignation either, since one player could think they are agreeing to a draw {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Draws ====\n{{Main|Draw (chess)}}\n{{Chess diagram\n|tright\n|{{harvcol|Harkness|1967}}\n|  |  |kd|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |ql|bl|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |kl|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|Black to move is in stalemate, since his king has no legal move, and is not in check.

This situation is called a [[stalemate]]. An example of such a position is shown in the adjacent diagram.\n* The game is immediately drawn when there is no possibility of checkmate for either side with any series of legal moves. This draw is often due to ''insufficient material'', including the endgames\n** king against king;\n** king against king and bishop;\n** king against king and knight;\n** king and bishop against king and bishop, with both bishops on squares of the same color (see [[Checkmate#Unusual mates]]).<ref>With a king and bishop versus a king and bishop, a checkmate is not possible if the bishops are on the same color of squares but checkmate is possible if they are on opposite colors.</ref>\n* Both players [[Draw by agreement|agree to a draw]] after one of the players makes such an offer.\n\nThe player having the move may claim a draw by declaring that one of the following conditions exists, or by declaring an intention to make a move which will bring about one of these conditions:\n* [[Fifty-move rule]]: There has been no {{chessgloss|capture}} or pawn move in the last fifty moves by each player, if the last move was not a checkmate.\n* [[Threefold repetition]]: The same board position has occurred three times with the same player to move and all pieces having the same rights to move, including the right to [[castling|castle]] or capture ''[[en passant]]''.\n\nIf the claim is proven true, the game is drawn {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=21,26\u201328}}.\n\nThe above conditions apply to allow a player to claim a draw.  Under current rules, if a player does not claim a draw, the game is automatically drawn if the same position occurs five times with the same player to move or if 75 moves are made by each player with no capture or pawn move, if the last move is not a checkmate.<ref>[https://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=208&view=article FIDE Laws of Chess, article 9.6]</ref>\n\nAt one time, if a player was able to check the opposing king continually ([[perpetual check]]) and the player indicated their intention to do so, the game was drawn. This rule is no longer in effect; however, players will usually agree to a draw in such a situation, since either the rule on threefold repetition or the fifty-move rule will eventually be applicable {{harvcol|Staunton|1847|pp=21\u201322}}, {{Harvcol|Reinfeld|1954|p=175}}.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Time control====\n{{Main|Time control}}\nA game played under [[time control]] will end as a loss for a player who uses up all of their allotted time, unless the opponent cannot possibly checkmate him (see [[#Timing|Timing]]). There are different types of time control. Players may have a fixed amount of time for the entire game or they may have to make a certain number of moves within a specified time. Also, a small increment of time may be added for each move made.\n\n==Competition rules==\nThese rules apply to games played \"{{chessgloss|over the board}}\". There are special rules for correspondence chess, blitz chess, computer chess, and for handicapped players.\n\n===Moving the pieces===\nThe movement of pieces is to be done with one hand. Once the hand is taken off a piece after moving it, the move cannot be retracted unless the {{chessgloss|illegal move|move is illegal}}. When castling, the player should first move the king with one hand and then move the rook with the same hand {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=19\u201320}}.\n\nIn the case of a [[promotion (chess)|pawn promotion]], if the player releases the pawn on the eighth rank, the player must promote the pawn. After the pawn has moved, the player may touch any piece not on the board and the promotion is not finalized until the new piece is released on the promotion square {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.\n\n=== Touch-move rule ===\n{{Main|Touch-move rule}}\nIn serious play, if a player having the move touches a piece as if having the intention of moving it, then the player must move it if it can be legally moved. So long as the hand has not left the piece on a new square, any legal move can be made with the piece. If a player touches one of the opponent's pieces then that piece must be {{chessgloss|capture|captured}} if there is a legal move that does so. If none of the touched pieces can be moved or captured there is no penalty {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=19\u201320}}.\n\nWhen [[castling]], the king must be the first piece touched.<ref>The [[United States Chess Federation]] has a variation that tournament directors can use. If a player ''intending'' to castle touches the rook first, there is no penalty. However, if castling is illegal, the touch-move rule applies to the rook. This variation does not have to be announced in pre-tournament publicity but should be announced at the start of the tournament. {{cite web|url=http://www.uschess.org/docs/gov/reports/RulebookChanges.pdf|title=Rulebook Changes}}</ref> If the player touches the rook at the same time as touching the king, the player must castle with that rook if it is legal to do so. If the player completes a two-square king move without touching a rook, the player must move the correct rook accordingly if castling in that direction is legal. If a player starts to castle illegally, another legal king move must be made if possible, including castling with the other rook {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=20}}.\n\nIf a player moves a pawn to its eighth rank, it cannot be substituted for a different move of the pawn when the player has stopped touching it. However, the move is not complete until the [[Promotion (chess)|promoted]] piece is released on that square.\n\nIf a player wishes to touch a piece with the intention of adjusting its position on a square, the player must first alert the opponent of this intention by saying ''J'adoube'' or \"I adjust\". Once the game has started, only the player with the move may touch the pieces on the board {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=19\u201320}}.\n\n=== Timing ===\n[[File:Digitalna sahovska ura2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|alt=Photo shows a digital chess clock. There are two clocks, one on each side and a button on top of each stops that clock and starts the other|Digital chess clock]]\nTournament games are played under time constraints, called [[time control]]s, using a [[chess clock]]. Players must make their moves within the time control or forfeit the game. There are different types of time controls. In some cases each player will have a certain amount of time to make a certain number of moves. In other cases each player will have a limited amount of time to make all of their moves. Also, the player may gain a small amount of additional time for each move made, either by a small increment added for each move made, or by the clock delaying a small amount of time each time it is started after the opponent's move {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=21\u201324}}.\n* If a player delivers a checkmate, the game is over and that player wins, no matter what is subsequently noticed about the time on the clock.\n* If player A calls attention to player B being out of time while player A is not out of time and some sequence of legal moves leads to B being checkmated then player A wins automatically.\n* If player A does not have the ''possibility'' of checkmating B then the game is a draw {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=28}}.\n\nThe [[United States Chess Federation]] (USCF) rule is different. USCF Rule 14E defines \"insufficient material to win on time\", that is lone king, king plus knight, king plus bishop, and king plus two knights opposed by no pawns, and there is no forced win in the final position. Hence to win on time with this material, the USCF rule requires that a win can be forced from that position, while the FIDE rule merely requires a win to be possible. (See [[Monika So\u0107ko#Rules appeal in 2008|Monika So\u0107ko rules appeal in 2008]] and [[Women's World Chess Championship 2008]] for a famous instance of this rule.)\n* If a player is out of time and also calls attention to their opponent running out of time, then:\n** If a {{chessgloss|sudden death}} time control is not being used, the game continues in the next time control period {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=23}}.\n** if the game is played under a sudden death time control, then if it can be established which player ran out of time first, the game is lost by that player; otherwise the game is drawn {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=29}}.\n\nIf a player believes that the opponent is attempting to win the game on time and not by normal means (i.e. checkmate), if it is a sudden death time control and the player has less than two minutes remaining, the player may stop the clocks and claim a draw with the arbiter. The arbiter may declare the game a draw or postpone the decision and allot the opponent two extra minutes {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=21\u201324,29}}.<ref>\n\nThe USCF does not have this exact rule. However, under USCF rules, if a player has less than two minutes left in a sudden-death time control, they may claim a draw because of \"insufficient losing chances\". If the director upholds their claim, the game is drawn. That is defined as a position in which a class C (1400\u20131599 [[Elo rating system|rating]]) player would have a less than 10% chance of losing the position to a master (2200 and up rating), if both have sufficient time {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.</ref>\n\n===Recording moves===\n{{Main|Chess notation|Algebraic chess notation}}\n[[File:SCD algebraic notation.svg|left|thumb|200px|alt=Diagram showing how squares are named \u2013 columns are a through h, rows are 1 through 8|Naming the squares in [[algebraic chess notation|algebraic notation]] ]]\n[[File:Planilha_Eisenberg_e_Capablanca.jpg|thumb|180px|A score sheet from a game by [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]], in [[descriptive chess notation|descriptive notation]]]]\n\nEach square of the [[chessboard]] is identified with a unique pair of a letter and a number. The vertical {{chessgloss|files}} are labeled ''a'' through ''h'', from White's left (i.e. the [[queenside]]) to White's right. Similarly, the horizontal {{chessgloss|ranks}} are numbered from ''1'' to ''8'', starting from the one nearest White's side of the board. Each square of the board, then, is uniquely identified by its file letter and rank number. The white king, for example, starts the game on square '''e1'''. The black knight on '''b8''' can move to '''a6''' or '''c6'''.\n\nIn formal competition, each player is obliged to record each move as it is played in a [[chess notation]] in order to settle disputes about illegal positions, overstepping time control, and making claims of draws by the fifty-move rule or repetition of position. [[Algebraic chess notation]] is the accepted standard for recording games today. There are other systems such as [[ICCF numeric notation]] for international [[correspondence chess]] and the obsolete [[descriptive chess notation]]. The current rule is that a move must be made on the board before it is written on paper or recorded with an electronic device.<ref>In a variation of the rules, a USCF director may allow players to write their move on a paper {{chessgloss|score sheet}} (but not enter it electronically) before making the move.

Sometimes he crossed out a move he had written and wrote a different move instead {{harvcol|Timman|2005|p=83}}.</ref>\n\nBoth players should indicate offers of a draw by writing \"=\" at that move on their score sheet {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=27}}. Notations about the time on the clocks can be made.

That move must be made with the same piece if possible, because the touch-move rule applies. If the illegal move was an attempt to castle, the touch-move rule applies to the king but not to the rook. The arbiter should adjust the time on the clock according to the best evidence. If the mistake is only noticed later on, the game should be restarted from the position in which the error occurred {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=24\u201325}}. Some regional organizations have different rules.<ref>The USCF requires that only an illegal move within the last ten moves be corrected. If the illegal move was more than ten moves ago, the game continues {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.</ref>\n\nIf [[blitz chess]] is being played (in which both players have a small, limited time, e.g. five minutes) the rule varies. A player may correct an illegal move if the player has not pressed their clock. If a player has pressed their clock, the opponent may claim a win if he or she hasn't moved. If the opponent moves, the illegal move is accepted and without penalty {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=77}}.<ref>If the player has pressed their clock, the standard USCF rule is that two minutes are added to the offender's opponent's clock. An alternative USCF rule is that the opponent can claim a win by forfeit if the player has not touched a piece. If the player has left their king in check, the opponent may touch the piece that is giving check, remove the opponent's king, and claim a win {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.</ref>\n\nAccording to the FIDE Laws of Chess, the first completed illegal move is penalized by awarding the opponent two additional minutes on the clock. The second completed illegal move by the same player results in the loss of the game, unless the position is such that it is impossible for the opponent to win by any series of legal moves (e.g. if the opponent has a [[bare king]]) in which case the game is drawn.<ref>[http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=171&view=article FIDE Laws of Chess], article 7.5.b</ref> A move is completed when it has been made and the player has pressed the clock.<ref>FIDE Laws of Chess, article 6.2.a</ref> In rapid chess and blitz chess, the first completed illegal move results in a loss.<ref>FIDE Laws of Chess, article A.4.b</ref>\n\n====Illegal position====\nIf it is discovered during the game that the starting position was incorrect, the game is restarted. If it is discovered during the game that the board is oriented incorrectly, the game is continued with the pieces transferred to a correctly oriented board. If the game starts with the colors of the pieces reversed, the game continues (unless the arbiter rules otherwise) {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=24}}. Some regional organizations have different rules.<ref>The USCF rules are different. If before Black's tenth move is completed it is discovered that the initial position was wrong or that the colors were reversed, the game is restarted with the correct initial position and colors. If the discovery is made after the tenth move, the game continues {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.</ref>\n\nIf a player knocks over pieces, it is their responsibility to restore them to their correct position on their time. If it is discovered that an illegal move has been made, or that pieces have been displaced, the game is restored to the position before the irregularity. If that position cannot be determined, the game is restored to the last known correct position {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=24\u201325}}.\n\n===Conduct===\nPlayers may not use any notes, outside sources of information (including computers), or advice from other people. Analysis on another board is not permitted. Scoresheets are to record objective facts about the game only, such as time on the clock or draw offers. Players may not leave the competition area without permission of the arbiter {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=30\u201331}}.\n\nHigh standards of etiquette and ethics are expected. Players should shake hands before and after the game. Generally a player should not speak during the game, except to offer a draw, resign, or to call attention to an irregularity. An announcement of \"check\" is commonly made in informal games but is not recommended in officially sanctioned games. A player may not distract or annoy another player by any means, including repeatedly offering a draw {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=30\u201331,49\u201352}}.\n\nDue to increasing concerns about the use of [[chess engine]]s and outside communication, [[mobile phone]] usage is banned. The first forfeit by a high-profile player, for their phone ringing during play, occurred in 2003.<ref>[https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/chess-1-1295070 \"I just called to say... you\u2019re disqualified!\"], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 19 October 2003</ref> In 2014 FIDE extended this to ban all mobile phones from the playing area during chess competitions, under penalty of forfeiture of the game or even expulsion from the tournament. However, the rules also allow for less rigid enforcement in amateur events.<ref name=\"chessbase-anti-cheating\">[http://en.chessbase.com/post/new-fide-anti-cheating-rules New FIDE anti-cheating rules], ChessBase, 17 September 2014</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Main|Chess piece|Chessboard|Staunton chess set|Chess clock}}\n[[Image:Staunton chess set.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=This photo shows a chessboard with pieces set up on both sides, ready to play.

Squares of approximately 57&nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|1|4}}&nbsp;inches) normally are well-suited for pieces with the kings in the preferred size range. The darker squares are usually brown or green and the lighter squares are off-white or [[buff (colour)|buff]].\n\n[[File:JaquesCookStaunton.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|thumb|alt=A photo of the original Staunton chess pieces from about 1849.|Original Staunton chess pieces, introduced in 1849.

They are often black and white; other colors may be used (like a dark wood or even red for the dark pieces) but they would still be called the \"white\" and \"black\" pieces (see [[White and Black in chess]]). The height of the king should be 85 to 105&nbsp;millimetres (3.35\u20134.13&nbsp;inches).<ref>The 1988 and 2006 FIDE rules specify 85\u2013105&nbsp;mm;{{harvcol|FIDE|1989|p=121}} the 2008 rules simply say \"about 95&nbsp;mm\".</ref> A height of approximately 95 to 102&nbsp;mm ({{frac|3|3|4}}\u20134&nbsp;inches) is preferred by most players. The diameter of the king should be 40 to 50% of its height. The size of the other pieces should be in proportion to the king. The pieces should be well balanced {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.<ref>The US Chess Federation allows the height of the king to be 86\u2013114&nbsp;mm ({{frac|3|3|8}}\u2013{{frac|4|1|2}}&nbsp;inches) {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.</ref>\n\nIn games subject to [[time control]], a [[chess clock]] is used, consisting of two adjacent clocks and buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, such that the two component clocks never run simultaneously. The clock can be [[Analog clock|analog]] or [[Clock#Digital clocks|digital]] though a digital clock is highly preferred under both USCF and FIDE rulesets. This is since most tournaments now include either a time [[Bronstein delay|delay]] (a countdown to when a clock starts again) or [[Fischer delay|add]] (extra time being added prior or after the move) to their time controls. Before the start of the game, either the arbiter decides, or whoever is playing Black, where the chess clock is placed.\n\n==History==\nThe rules of chess have evolved much over the centuries from the early chess-like games played in India in the 6th century. For much of that time the rules have varied from area to area. The modern rules first took form in Italy during the 13th century, giving more mobility to pieces that previously had more restricted movement (such as the queen and bishop). Such modified rules entered into an accepted form during the late 15th century {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|pp=41,328}} or early 16th century {{harvcol|Ruch|2004}}. The basic moves of the king, rook, and knight are unchanged. Pawns originally did not have the option of moving two squares on their first move and promoted only to a queen if they reached the eighth rank. The queen was originally the ''[[ferz (chess)|fers]]'' or ''farzin'', which could move one square diagonally in any direction. In European chess it became able to leap two squares diagonally, forwards, backwards, or to left or right on its first move; some areas also gave this right to a newly promoted pawn. In the Persian and Arabic game the bishop was a ''p\u012bl'' (Persian) or ''[[alfil (chess)|f\u012bl]]'' (Arabic) (meaning \"elephant\") which moved two squares diagonally with jump {{harvcol|Davidson|1949|p=13}}. In the Middle Ages the pawn could only be [[promotion (chess)|promoted]] to the equivalent of a queen (which at that time was the weakest piece) if it reached its eighth rank {{harvcol|Davidson|1949|pp=59\u201361}}. During the 12th century the squares on the board sometimes alternated colors, and this became the standard in the 13th century {{harvcol|Davidson|1949|p=146}}; whence the word \"chequered\"/\"checkered\".\n[[Image:Andr\u00e9 Philidor.jpg|right|thumb|175px|alt=An image of Philidor, who published rules in 1749|Philidor]]\nBetween 1200 and 1600 several laws emerged that drastically altered the game. Checkmate became a requirement to win; a player could not win by capturing all of the opponent's pieces. [[Stalemate]] was added, although the outcome has changed several times (see [[Stalemate#History of the stalemate rule|History of the stalemate rule]]). Pawns gained the option of moving two squares on their first move, and the ''[[en passant]]'' rule was a natural consequence of that new option. The king and rook acquired the right to [[castling|castle]] (see [[Castling#Variations throughout history|Variations throughout history of castling]] for different versions of the rule).\n\nBetween 1475 and 1500 the queen and the bishop also acquired their current moves, which made them much stronger pieces<ref>''[[A History of Chess]]''</ref> {{harvcol|Davidson|1949|pp=14\u201317}}. When all of these changes were accepted the game was in essentially its modern form {{harvcol|Davidson|1949|pp=14\u201317}}.\n\nThe rules for pawn promotion have changed several times. As stated above, originally the pawn could only be promoted to the queen, which at that time was a weak piece. When the queen acquired its current move and became the most powerful piece, the pawn could then be promoted to a queen or a rook, bishop, or knight. In the 18th century rules allowed only the promotion to a piece already captured, e.g. the rules published in 1749 by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Danican Philidor]]. In the 19th century this restriction was lifted, which allowed for a player to have more than one queen, e.g. the 1828 rules by [[Jacob Sarratt]] {{harvcol|Davidson|1949|pp=59\u201361}}.\n\nTwo new rules concerning draws were introduced, each of which have changed through the years:\n* The [[threefold repetition]] rule was added, although at some times up to six repetitions have been required, and the exact conditions have been specified more clearly (see [[Threefold repetition#History]]).\n* The [[fifty-move rule]] was also added. At various times, the number of moves required was different, such as 24, 60, 70, or 75. For several years in the 20th century, the standard fifty moves was extended to one hundred moves for a few specific [[Chess endgame|endgames]] (see [[fifty-move rule#History|Fifty-move rule's history]]).\n\nAnother group of new laws included (1) the [[touch-move rule]] and the accompanying \"j'adoube/adjust\" rule; (2) that White moves first (in 1889<ref>[http://www.chess-math.org/scholarsmate/ ''Scholar's Mate'' issue 102]</ref>); (3) the orientation of the board; (4) the procedure if an illegal move was made; (5) the procedure if the king had been left in check for some moves; and (6) issues regarding the behavior of players and spectators. The [[Staunton chess set]] was introduced in 1849 and it became the standard style of pieces. The size of pieces and squares of the board was standardized {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|pp=220\u201321, ''laws, history of''}}.\n\nUntil the middle of the 19th century, chess games were played without any time limit. In an 1834 match between [[Alexander McDonnell]] and [[Louis-Charles Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais]], McDonnell took an inordinate amount of time to move, sometimes up to 1\u00bd hours. In 1836 [[Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant]] suggested a time limit, but no action was taken. At the [[London 1851 chess tournament|1851 London tournament]], Staunton blamed his loss in his match against [[Elijah Williams (chess player)|Elijah Williams]]  on Williams' slow play; one game was adjourned for the day after only 29 moves.<ref>Howard Staunton, ''The Chess Tournament \u2013 A Collection of Games Played at this Celebrated Assemblage'', London 1852, p. 161</ref> The next year a match between [[Daniel Harrwitz]] and [[Johann L\u00f6wenthal]] used a limit of 20 minutes per move. The first use of a modern-style time limit was in an 1861 match between [[Adolph Anderssen]] and [[Ign\u00e1c Kolisch]] {{harvcol|Sunnucks|1970|p=459}}.\n\n===Codification===\n{{multiple image |total_width = 340\n |image1 = FIDE rulebook.jpg\n |width1 = 312 |height1 = 510\n |caption1 = FIDE rulebook, 1989\n |image2 = OfficialChessRulebook.jpg\n |width2 = 320 |height2 = 499\n |caption2 = ''Official Chess Rulebook'', by Harkness (1970 edition)\n}}\nThe first known publication of chess rules was in a book by [[Luis Ram\u00edrez de Lucena]] about 1497, shortly after the movement of the queen, bishop, and pawn were changed to their modern form {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}. [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Segura]] gave rules of chess in his 1561 book [[Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del axedrez]] {{harvcol|Sunnucks|1970|p=294}}. In the 16th and 17th centuries, there were local differences concerning rules such as castling, pawn promotion, stalemate, and ''en passant''. Some of these differences persisted until the 19th century {{Harvcol|Harkness|1967|p=3}}; for example differences in castling rules persisted in Italy until the late 19th century.\n\nAs chess clubs arose and tournaments became common, there was a need to formalize the rules. In 1749 [[Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Danican Philidor|Philidor]] (1726\u20131795) wrote a set of rules that were widely used, as well as rules by later writers such as the 1828 rules by [[Jacob Sarratt]] (1772\u20131819) and rules by George Walker (1803\u20131879)<!-- not any of the George Walkers with articles-->. In the 19th century, many major clubs published their own rules, including The Hague in 1803, London in 1807, Paris in 1836, and St. Petersburg in 1854. In 1851 [[Howard Staunton]] (1810\u20131874) called for a \"Constituent Assembly for Remodeling the Laws of Chess\" and proposals by [[Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa]] (1818\u20131889) were published in 1854. Staunton had published rules in ''Chess Player's Handbook'' in 1847, and his new proposals were published in 1860 in ''Chess Praxis''; they were generally accepted in English-speaking countries. German-speaking countries usually used the writings of chess authority [[Johann Berger]] (1845\u20131933) or ''[[Handbuch des Schachspiels]]'' by [[Paul Rudolf von Bilguer]] (1815\u20131840), first published in 1843.\n\nIn 1924, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs ([[FIDE]]) was formed and in 1929 it took up the task of standardizing the rules. At first FIDE tried to establish a universal set of rules, but translations to various languages differed slightly. Although FIDE rules were used for international competition under their control, some countries continued to use their own rules internally {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|pp=220\u201321}}. In 1952 FIDE created the Permanent Commission for the Rules of Chess (also known as the Rules Commission) and published a new edition of the rules. The third official edition of the laws was published in 1966. The first three editions of the rules were published in French, with that as the official version. In 1974 FIDE published the English version of the rules (which was based on an authorized 1955 translation). With that edition, English became the official language of the rules. Another edition was published in 1979. Throughout this time, ambiguities in the laws were handled by frequent interpretations that the Rules Commission published as supplements and amendments. In 1982 the Rules Commission rewrote the laws to incorporate the interpretations and amendments {{harvcol|FIDE|1989|pp=7\u20138}}. In 1984 FIDE abandoned the idea of a universal set of laws, although FIDE rules are the standard for high-level play {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|pp=220\u201321}}. With the 1984 edition, FIDE implemented a four-year moratorium between changes to the rules. Other editions were issued in 1988 and 1992 {{harvcol|FIDE|1989|p=5}}, {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.\n\nThe rules of national FIDE affiliates (such as the [[United States Chess Federation]], or USCF) are based on the FIDE rules, with slight variations {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.<ref>Schiller states that the United States is the only country that does not follow the FIDE rules. Some of the differences in the [[United States Chess Federation|US Chess Federation]] rules are (1) a player must have a reasonably complete {{chessgloss|score sheet}} to claim a time forfeit and (2) the player can choose whether or not to use a clock with a delay period for each move {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=123\u201324}}. Some other differences are noted above.</ref> [[Kenneth Harkness]] published popular rulebooks in the United States starting in 1956, and the USCF continues to publish rulebooks for use in tournaments it sanctions.\n\nIn 2008, FIDE added the variant [[Chess960]] to the appendix of the \"Laws of Chess\". Chess960 uses a random initial set-up of main pieces, with the conditions that the king is placed somewhere between the two rooks, and bishops on opposite-color squares. The castling rules are extended to cover all these positions.<ref>[http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=125&view=article FIDE Handbook E.I.01B. Appendices]</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, rules about such things as [[mobile phone]]s and unauthorised use of [[chess engines]] were introduced.<ref name=\"chessbase-anti-cheating\" />\n\n==Variations==\nFrom time to time, rules have been introduced at certain tournaments to discourage players from [[Draw by agreement#Steps taken to discourage draws or short draws|agreeing to short draws]]. One such case was the \"no drawing or resigning during the first 30 moves\" rule used at the [[London Chess Classic#2009 Classic: 8\u201315 December|2009 London Chess Classic]].<ref>pages W1 and W2 of \"Weekend\" supplement of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper for 21 November 2009</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Algebraic chess notation]]\n* [[Cheating in chess]]\n* [[Chess]]\n* [[Chessboard]]\n* [[Chess clock]]\n* [[Chess glossary]]\n* [[Chess piece]]\n* [[Chess tournament]]\n{{colend}}\n\n'''Specific rules'''\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Adjournment (games)]] (rare now)\n* [[Castling]]\n* [[Check (chess)|Check]]\n* [[Checkmate]]\n* [[Draw (chess)|Draw]]\n* [[Draw by agreement]]\n* ''[[En passant]]''\n* [[Fifty-move rule]]\n* [[Perpetual check]] (former rule)\n* [[Promotion (chess)|Promotion]]\n* [[Stalemate]]\n* [[Threefold repetition]]\n* [[Time control]]\n* [[Touch-move rule]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation\n | last=Burgess |first=Graham |authorlink = Graham Burgess\n | title=The Mammoth Book of Chess\n | publisher=Running Press\n | year=2009\n | edition = 3rd\n | isbn= 978-0-7624-3726-9}}\n* {{citation\n | last=Davidson\n | first=Henry\n | year=1949\n | title=A Short History of Chess\n | publisher=McKay\n | edition=1981\n | isbn=0-679-14550-8 }}\n* {{citation\n|last=FIDE\n|authorlink=FIDE\n|year=1989\n|title=The Official Laws of Chess\n|publisher=Macmillan\n|isbn= 0-02-028540-X}}\n* {{citation\n | url=http://www.fide.com/info/handbook?id=32&view=category\n | title=FIDE Laws of Chess\n | year=2008\n | accessdate=2008-09-10\n | last=FIDE\n | authorlink=FIDE\n | publisher=FIDE\n | isbn=978-0-9594355-2-8\n }}\n* {{citation\n | last=Harkness\n | first=Kenneth\n | authorlink=Kenneth Harkness\n | title=Official Chess Handbook\n | year=1967\n | publisher=McKay}}\n* {{citation\n |last1=Hooper\n |first1=David \n |authorlink1=David Vincent Hooper\n |last2=Whyld\n |first2=Kenneth\n |authorlink2=Kenneth Whyld\n |title=The Oxford Companion to Chess\n |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n |edition=2nd\n |year=1996\n |origyear=First pub. 1992\n |isbn=0-19-280049-3 |title-link=The Oxford Companion to Chess\n }}\n* {{citation\n | last=Just\n | first=Tim\n\n | year=2014\n | title=U.S. Chess Federation's Official Rules of Chess\n | edition=6th\n | publisher=McKay\n | isbn=978-0-8129-3559-2\n}}\n* {{citation| last=Polgar| first=Susan| authorlink=Susan Polgar| last2=Truong| first2=Paul| authorlink2=Paul Truong| year=2005| title=A World Champion's Guide to Chess| edition=| publisher=[[Random House]]| isbn=978-0-8129-3653-7| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/worldchampionsgu00susa_0}}\n* {{Citation\n |last=Reinfeld|first=Fred|authorlink=Fred Reinfeld\n |title=How To Be A Winner At Chess\n |year=1954\n |publisher=Fawcett\n |isbn=0-449-91206-X}}\n* {{citation\n | url=http://amici.iccf.com/issues/issue_01/issue_01_the_italian_rules.html\n | title=The Italian Rules\n | year=2004\n | accessdate=2008-09-10\n | last=Ruch\n | first=Eric\n | publisher=ICCF}}\n* {{citation\n | last=Schiller| first=Eric | authorlink=Eric Schiller\n | year=2003\n | title=Official Rules of Chess\n | edition=2nd\n | publisher=Cardoza\n | isbn=978-1-58042-092-1}}\n* {{citation\n | last=Staunton | first=Howard | authorlink=Howard Staunton\n | year=1847\n | title=The Chess-Player's Handbook\n | location=London | publisher=H.
