In recent years, people substitutes health supplement for healthy meal. Some myths even state [[beta carotene]] <ref>Tanvetyanon T, Bepler G, (2008) Beta-carotene in multivitamins and the possible risk of lung cancer among smokers versus former smokers: a meta-analysis and evaluation of national brands.  volume 113, issue 1 pages 150\u20137, {{PMID|18429004}}. doi=10.1002/cncr.23527 url</ref> as [[elixir]] in developing countries (the Third World).\n\nWith rising health consciousness, people rely on food [[dietary supplement|supplement]]s like [[vitamins]] A, B, C, D, E etc. these vitamins act as anti-oxidants chemical in the human body. Antioxidants is a good chemical in the appropriate consumption but a large overdose can cause cellular oxidation and cause [[cytopathic]]. Also, the industries can not strictly control the concentration and dose for supplement that extracted from natural food resources. A long-term consumption of those supplement can cause physical burden and also a significant hard work for organ to metabolize. Many health organization and government have published a maximum daily consumption for supplement called [[tolerable upper intake levels]] (UL), for example [[World Health Organization]] suggest the tolerable upper intake levels of vitamin C is 2000&nbsp;mg/d for adult men from age 31 to 50.<ref>Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Vitamin D, and Fluoride (1997); Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline (1998); Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin C, Vitamine E, Selenium, and Carotenoids (2000); Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Copper, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Zinc (2001); and Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D (2011).</ref> Tolerable upper intake levels is different for different gender and age. These suggested intake level can be followed in order to maintain the public health and safety.<ref>Mckiernan, F. E., & Wiley, C. (2008). Vitamin D, Vitamin D, and the Tolerable Upper Intake Level. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, 23(12), 2060-2061.</ref>\n\nBoth animal and human experiment research shows that supplement cannot be the substitution to replace the daily food diet. Having a diverse diet and healthy habits is the better way to stay healthy instead of taking a lots of supplement that might be a co-carcinogen.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Carcinogens| ]]\n[[Category:Carcinogenesis]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:, templated 2 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-carcinogen"}
