According to the police investigators, Holtzclaw ran background checks on women with outstanding warrants or other criminal records, and methodically targeted those victims.<ref name=\"Guardian_guilty\"/>\n\nThe offense that led to Holtzclaw's arrest happened around 2:00&nbsp;a.m. on June 18, 2014, after Holtzclaw had already completed his shift on the northeast side of [[Oklahoma City]] and was driving to his residence in his assigned police vehicle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kfor.com/2016/02/04/watch-police-interrogation-of-daniel-holtzclaw/| title=Graphic: Interrogation of former Oklahoma City officer following first accusation of sex crimes | publisher=AP | date=November 1, 2015 | accessdate=February 6, 2016 | author=AP}}</ref> During that time, police said, Holtzclaw made a traffic stop without reporting to police dispatch, running a records check on the driver, or revealing that he logged off of his patrol car computer. The driver was Jannie Ligons, a 57-year-old woman who was passing through the impoverished area that police said Holtzclaw was targeting. Unlike other women that police said he had accosted, she was not poor and had no police record. Ligons said that before forcing her to perform oral sex on him, Holtzclaw made her lift her shirt and pull down her pants. She testified that she had begged him to stop and was afraid for her life. Ligons promptly filed a police report.\n\nWhen Holtzclaw reported to the OKCPD Springlake Division station the following afternoon for his daily 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. shift, he was pulled aside and driven to the department's Sex Crimes Unit by detectives Kim Davis and Rocky Gregory for questioning. After being [[Miranda warning|Mirandized]], Holtzclaw underwent a two-hour interrogation during which he denied all accusations of misconduct during the Ligons stop earlier that morning, and [[buccal swab]]s were taken for DNA comparison. At the conclusion of the interrogation, the two detectives told Holtzclaw that they believed that he was being untruthful based both on previous evidence and on statements made by Kerri Hunt, his 25-year old-cohabiting girlfriend, that countered claims Holtzclaw had made to the detectives. While he was released after the interrogation, Holtzclaw's commission and entry cards, uniform shirt and pants, badges, firearms (handgun and shotgun), radio, and keys to his assigned police vehicle were seized, and he was placed on indefinite paid administrative leave. After further investigation eventually turned up a dozen additional complainants, Holtzclaw was arrested two months later on August 21, 2014, and originally charged with 16 (and eventually 36) counts of sexual abuse offenses including rape in the first and second degrees, sexual battery, procuring lewd exhibition, stalking, and forcible oral sodomy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAS02xk_eXY|title=Daniel Holtzclaw interrogation video (unredacted).

Looking back through police records, the detectives found the report of a woman who said she was stopped in May 2014 and driven to an isolated area by an officer who forced her to perform oral sex. No action had been taken at the time of her report, but when the detectives contacted the woman, she showed them the route that the officer had taken on the night of the attack, and it matched Holtzclaw's [[GPS]] route that evening. The detectives then reviewed Holtzclaw's automatically recorded history of running names through the department's two databases, looking specifically for people who had been checked out multiple times, and they contacted those women. In the initial investigation, six women were willing to come forward to testify, and the GPS device on Holtzclaw's patrol car put him at the scene of the alleged incidents. Police records showed that he had called in for a warrant check on all of them. Their investigation covered a six-month period, beginning with the first woman who was willing to come forward, a woman whom Holtzclaw arrested for drug possession in December 2013 and then allegedly forced oral sodomy from while she was handcuffed to a hospital bed.<ref name=\"buzz\"/><ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n===Accusations of sexual misconduct===\nEventually, the police investigation brought together 13 women who were willing to testify; published reports did not include information on any possible further women who were not willing to testify. The earliest incident discovered was from December 20, 2013, where a woman said she had been arrested for drug possession, was hospitalized, and was forced to give oral sex while she was handcuffed to her hospital bed. She said that he again made sexual advances to her on several occasions after she was released from jail. The woman said that she was led to believe that she would be released if she performed oral sex on Holtzclaw. \"I didn't think that no one would believe me,\" she testified at a pretrial hearing. \"I feel like all police will work together.\"<ref name=\"AP\">{{cite web |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/fd1d4d05e561462a85abe50e7eaed4ec/ap-hundreds-officers-lose-licenses-over-sex-misconduct | title=AP: Hundreds of officers lose licenses over sex misconduct | publisher=AP | date=November 1, 2015 | accessdate=December 18, 2015 |author1=Sedensky, Matt |author2=Merchant, Nomann }}</ref>\n\nOn February 27, 2014, Holtzclaw allegedly pulled up to a woman who was sitting in a parked car outside her house, fondled the woman's breasts, and told her, \"I'm not going to take you to jail. Just play by my rules.\" She said he returned to her home repeatedly and broke into it once. At his trial she said she did not notify the police because she did not believe anyone would believe her because \"I'm a black female.\"\n\n*'''March 14, 2014''': Holtzclaw stopped a woman who was walking to a friend's house, asked her whether she was in possession of any drugs, and forced her to expose her breasts.\n*'''April 24, 2014''': Holtzclaw stopped a woman who was engaging in sex work. He drove her home and when they arrived he forced her to perform oral sex and then raped her.\n*'''April 25, 2014''': Holtzclaw pulled a woman over saying he was taking her to detox in jail; he instead drove her to a field and raped her, leaving her there after he was done.\n*'''May 7, 2014''': Holtzclaw stopped a woman while she walked to her cousin's house. After finding out she had some warrants, he forced her to perform oral sex and then raped her behind an abandoned school.\n*'''May 8, 2014''': According to a later investigation, \"A woman, known in court documents as T.M., reported that an unidentified officer forced her to perform oral sex after he found a crack pipe in her purse. Although she filed a police report later that month, no connection was made to Holtzclaw at the time.\"\n*'''May 21, 2014''': Holtzclaw drove a woman to a secluded area and gave her an ultimatum: sex or jail.  She performed oral sex on him and then he raped her. In an interview the woman said that she first thought it was a \"cruel joke of some hidden-camera show\" until she realized that he was serious. She said she \"had been jailed many times before, and knew the math: a 15-minute ride downtown, two hours to be booked, up to a day of waiting to move to a cell, hearings drawn out over weeks or months,\" and then decided to give in to his demands, which she figured would only take about six minutes.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n*'''May 26, 2014''': Holtzclaw stopped a woman and touched her breasts and put his hand in her pants. The woman said she did not tell the police because she didn't think she'd be believed.\n*'''June 17, 2014''':  According to an investigation, \"A 17-year-old female is first stopped by Holtzclaw when he arrives to investigate a verbal dispute between two of her friends. Later, he tracks her down while she is walking home, threatens to arrest her for an outstanding warrant, and then takes her to her mother's house, where he forces her to perform oral sex and have intercourse with him on the enclosed porch.\"\n*'''June 18, 2014''': Around 2:00 am, Holtzclaw had an encounter with a 57-year-old grandmother, Jannie Ligons, who would ultimately be the one to spark the investigation\n*'''June 18, 2014''': The final sexual incident occurred on the same day as the encounter reported by  Ligons.  According to testimony, Holtzclaw stopped a woman as she left a hotel where she had been staying with her boyfriend.  After running a check on her he took her to a desolate area and raped her.  She told her boyfriend about the attack and he told her that she should report the rape to the police. \"He is the police\", she responded.\n*'''November 2014''': In November three more victims came forward, bringing the total to 13.  Previously unidentified DNA which had been found on Holtzclaw's pants was found to match that of a 17-year-old girl who had come forward regarding the June 17 event. Another woman said she was walking on May 22 when Holtzclaw stopped her to check for warrants.  When he found that there were no warrants out for her he said he would jail her if she didn't have sex with him; he then forced her to perform oral sex and raped her. A third woman said that he told her he was bringing her to detox but instead brought her to an isolated area and raped her. Ten more counts, including \"first-degree rape, second-degree rape by instrumentation, forcible oral sodomy, and sexual battery\" were filed against Holtzclaw, who was still on paid leave.<ref name=\"GLAMOUR News\">{{cite web | url=http://www.glamour.com/inspired/blogs/the-conversation/2015/12/daniel-holtzclaw-trial | title=The Trial of Daniel Holtzclaw, the Cop Charged With Sexually Assaulting 13 Black Women | publisher=GLAMOUR News | date=December 9, 2015 | accessdate=January 3, 2016 | author=De Leon, Conception}}</ref>\n\n===Jury selection===\n\nThe final jury was an [[all-white jury]] which consisted of eight men and four women.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dart|first1=Tom|title=Critics cite all-white jury for trial of ex-officer accused of raping black women|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/07/oklahoma-daniel-holtzclaw-all-white-jury-trial|accessdate=May 21, 2016|work=the Guardian.

The ruling, written by Judge [[Dana Kuehn]] rejected the appellant attorneys' claims of insufficient evidence and also of improper procedure for bundling all 36 charges together. The opinion denigrated allegations of a \"circus atmosphere,\" noting that the jury returned not guilty verdicts on fully half of the charges. In his concurrence, Presiding Judge [[David B.

They said that they began to organize when Holtzclaw's bail was reduced from $5 million to $500,000 because it was so \"insulting and infuriating\", that they \"wanted to stand up and say 'No. This is not OK.

The article concluded:\n<blockquote>\n\nMainstream media failed these women. The lack of coverage thwarted a national conversation about sexual violence as a distinct form of police brutality. The stories of these women need to serve as an important intervention in conversations about anti-black state violence, rape culture, and the vulnerability of sex workers, ex-offenders, and current and recovering drug addicts to state and state-sanctioned violence. This verdict and Holtzclaw's forthcoming sentencing are entry points for a more thoughtful, humane, and transformative national dialogue about police brutality and sexual violence. With or without mainstream media coverage, we need to continue talking about this trial and everything it represents.<ref name=\"Cosmopolitan\">{{cite web | url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/news/a50842/the-medias-disgraceful-silence-on-daniel-holtzclaw/ | title=The Media's Disgraceful Silence on Daniel Holtzclaw | work=Cosmopolitan | date=December 15, 2015 | accessdate=December 18, 2015 | author=Lindsey, Treva}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nHoltzclaw's case was part of an Associated Press report in a yearlong examination of sexual assaults by police.

The driver was Jannie Ligons, a 57-year-old woman who was passing through the impoverished area that police said Holtzclaw was targeting. Unlike other women that police said he had accosted, she was not poor and had no police record. Ligons said that before forcing her to perform oral sex on him, Holtzclaw made her lift her shirt and pull down her pants. She testified that she had begged him to stop and was afraid for her life. Ligons promptly filed a police report.\n\nWhen Holtzclaw reported to the OKCPD Springlake Division station the following afternoon for his daily 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. shift, he was pulled aside and driven to the department's Sex Crimes Unit by detectives Kim Davis and Rocky Gregory for questioning. After being [[Miranda warning|Mirandized]], Holtzclaw underwent a two-hour interrogation during which he denied all accusations of misconduct during the Ligons stop earlier that morning, and [[buccal swab]]s were taken for DNA comparison. At the conclusion of the interrogation, the two detectives told Holtzclaw that they believed that he was being untruthful based both on previous evidence and on statements made by Kerri Hunt, his 25-year old-cohabiting girlfriend, that countered claims Holtzclaw had made to the detectives. While he was released after the interrogation, Holtzclaw's commission and entry cards, uniform shirt and pants, badges, firearms (handgun and shotgun), radio, and keys to his assigned police vehicle were seized, and he was placed on indefinite paid administrative leave. After further investigation eventually turned up a dozen additional complainants, Holtzclaw was arrested two months later on August 21, 2014, and originally charged with 16 (and eventually 36) counts of sexual abuse offenses including rape in the first and second degrees, sexual battery, procuring lewd exhibition, stalking, and forcible oral sodomy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAS02xk_eXY|title=Daniel Holtzclaw interrogation video (unredacted).

Looking back through police records, the detectives found the report of a woman who said she was stopped in May 2014 and driven to an isolated area by an officer who forced her to perform oral sex. No action had been taken at the time of her report, but when the detectives contacted the woman, she showed them the route that the officer had taken on the night of the attack, and it matched Holtzclaw's [[GPS]] route that evening. The detectives then reviewed Holtzclaw's automatically recorded history of running names through the department's two databases, looking specifically for people who had been checked out multiple times, and they contacted those women. In the initial investigation, six women were willing to come forward to testify, and the GPS device on Holtzclaw's patrol car put him at the scene of the alleged incidents. Police records showed that he had called in for a warrant check on all of them. Their investigation covered a six-month period, beginning with the first woman who was willing to come forward, a woman whom Holtzclaw arrested for drug possession in December 2013 and then allegedly forced oral sodomy from while she was handcuffed to a hospital bed.<ref name=\"buzz\"/><ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n===Accusations of sexual misconduct===\nEventually, the police investigation brought together 13 women who were willing to testify; published reports did not include information on any possible further women who were not willing to testify. The earliest incident discovered was from December 20, 2013, where a woman said she had been arrested for drug possession, was hospitalized, and was forced to give oral sex while she was handcuffed to her hospital bed. She said that he again made sexual advances to her on several occasions after she was released from jail. The woman said that she was led to believe that she would be released if she performed oral sex on Holtzclaw. \"I didn't think that no one would believe me,\" she testified at a pretrial hearing. \"I feel like all police will work together.\"<ref name=\"AP\">{{cite web |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/fd1d4d05e561462a85abe50e7eaed4ec/ap-hundreds-officers-lose-licenses-over-sex-misconduct | title=AP: Hundreds of officers lose licenses over sex misconduct | publisher=AP | date=November 1, 2015 | accessdate=December 18, 2015 |author1=Sedensky, Matt |author2=Merchant, Nomann }}</ref>\n\nOn February 27, 2014, Holtzclaw allegedly pulled up to a woman who was sitting in a parked car outside her house, fondled the woman's breasts, and told her, \"I'm not going to take you to jail. Just play by my rules.\" She said he returned to her home repeatedly and broke into it once. At his trial she said she did not notify the police because she did not believe anyone would believe her because \"I'm a black female.\"\n\n*'''March 14, 2014''': Holtzclaw stopped a woman who was walking to a friend's house, asked her whether she was in possession of any drugs, and forced her to expose her breasts.\n*'''April 24, 2014''': Holtzclaw stopped a woman who was engaging in sex work. He drove her home and when they arrived he forced her to perform oral sex and then raped her.\n*'''April 25, 2014''': Holtzclaw pulled a woman over saying he was taking her to detox in jail; he instead drove her to a field and raped her, leaving her there after he was done.\n*'''May 7, 2014''': Holtzclaw stopped a woman while she walked to her cousin's house. After finding out she had some warrants, he forced her to perform oral sex and then raped her behind an abandoned school.\n*'''May 8, 2014''': According to a later investigation, \"A woman, known in court documents as T.M., reported that an unidentified officer forced her to perform oral sex after he found a crack pipe in her purse. Although she filed a police report later that month, no connection was made to Holtzclaw at the time.\"\n*'''May 21, 2014''': Holtzclaw drove a woman to a secluded area and gave her an ultimatum: sex or jail.  She performed oral sex on him and then he raped her. In an interview the woman said that she first thought it was a \"cruel joke of some hidden-camera show\" until she realized that he was serious. She said she \"had been jailed many times before, and knew the math: a 15-minute ride downtown, two hours to be booked, up to a day of waiting to move to a cell, hearings drawn out over weeks or months,\" and then decided to give in to his demands, which she figured would only take about six minutes.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n*'''May 26, 2014''': Holtzclaw stopped a woman and touched her breasts and put his hand in her pants. The woman said she did not tell the police because she didn't think she'd be believed.\n*'''June 17, 2014''':  According to an investigation, \"A 17-year-old female is first stopped by Holtzclaw when he arrives to investigate a verbal dispute between two of her friends. Later, he tracks her down while she is walking home, threatens to arrest her for an outstanding warrant, and then takes her to her mother's house, where he forces her to perform oral sex and have intercourse with him on the enclosed porch.\"\n*'''June 18, 2014''': Around 2:00 am, Holtzclaw had an encounter with a 57-year-old grandmother, Jannie Ligons, who would ultimately be the one to spark the investigation\n*'''June 18, 2014''': The final sexual incident occurred on the same day as the encounter reported by  Ligons.  According to testimony, Holtzclaw stopped a woman as she left a hotel where she had been staying with her boyfriend.  After running a check on her he took her to a desolate area and raped her.  She told her boyfriend about the attack and he told her that she should report the rape to the police. \"He is the police\", she responded.\n*'''November 2014''': In November three more victims came forward, bringing the total to 13.  Previously unidentified DNA which had been found on Holtzclaw's pants was found to match that of a 17-year-old girl who had come forward regarding the June 17 event. Another woman said she was walking on May 22 when Holtzclaw stopped her to check for warrants.  When he found that there were no warrants out for her he said he would jail her if she didn't have sex with him; he then forced her to perform oral sex and raped her. A third woman said that he told her he was bringing her to detox but instead brought her to an isolated area and raped her. Ten more counts, including \"first-degree rape, second-degree rape by instrumentation, forcible oral sodomy, and sexual battery\" were filed against Holtzclaw, who was still on paid leave.<ref name=\"GLAMOUR News\">{{cite web | url=http://www.glamour.com/inspired/blogs/the-conversation/2015/12/daniel-holtzclaw-trial | title=The Trial of Daniel Holtzclaw, the Cop Charged With Sexually Assaulting 13 Black Women | publisher=GLAMOUR News | date=December 9, 2015 | accessdate=January 3, 2016 | author=De Leon, Conception}}</ref>\n\n===Jury selection===\n\nThe final jury was an [[all-white jury]] which consisted of eight men and four women.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dart|first1=Tom|title=Critics cite all-white jury for trial of ex-officer accused of raping black women|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/07/oklahoma-daniel-holtzclaw-all-white-jury-trial|accessdate=May 21, 2016|work=the Guardian.

The stories of these women need to serve as an important intervention in conversations about anti-black state violence, rape culture, and the vulnerability of sex workers, ex-offenders, and current and recovering drug addicts to state and state-sanctioned violence. This verdict and Holtzclaw's forthcoming sentencing are entry points for a more thoughtful, humane, and transformative national dialogue about police brutality and sexual violence.
