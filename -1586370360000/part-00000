The bulb could be thrown at the base of the flames to quench the fire. The carbon tetrachloride type could also be installed in a spring-loaded wall fixture with a [[solder]]-based restraint. When the solder melted by high heat, the spring would either break the globe or launch it out of the bracket, allowing the extinguishing agent to be automatically dispersed into the fire. A well-known brand was the \"Red Comet,\" which was variously manufactured with other fire-fighting equipment in the Denver, Colorado area by the Red Comet Manufacturing Company from its founding in 1919 until manufacturing operations were closed in the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite web\n |publisher   = City of Littleton, CO\n |title       = Red Comet Manufacturing Company\n |url         = http://www.littletongov.org/my-littleton/littleton-history/other-topics/red-comet-manufacturing\n |accessdate  = 30 September 2016\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20161001211637/http://www.littletongov.org/my-littleton/littleton-history/other-topics/red-comet-manufacturing\n |archivedate = 1 October 2016\n}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Refrigerants ===\nPrior to the [[Montreal Protocol]], large quantities of carbon tetrachloride were used to produce the [[chlorofluorocarbon]] refrigerants R-11 ([[trichlorofluoromethane]]) and R-12 ([[dichlorodifluoromethane]]).

The bulb could be thrown at the base of the flames to quench the fire. The carbon tetrachloride type could also be installed in a spring-loaded wall fixture with a [[solder]]-based restraint. When the solder melted by high heat, the spring would either break the globe or launch it out of the bracket, allowing the extinguishing agent to be automatically dispersed into the fire. A well-known brand was the \"Red Comet,\" which was variously manufactured with other fire-fighting equipment in the Denver, Colorado area by the Red Comet Manufacturing Company from its founding in 1919 until manufacturing operations were closed in the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite web\n |publisher   = City of Littleton, CO\n |title       = Red Comet Manufacturing Company\n |url         = http://www.littletongov.org/my-littleton/littleton-history/other-topics/red-comet-manufacturing\n |accessdate  = 30 September 2016\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20161001211637/http://www.littletongov.org/my-littleton/littleton-history/other-topics/red-comet-manufacturing\n |archivedate = 1 October 2016\n}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Refrigerants ===\nPrior to the [[Montreal Protocol]], large quantities of carbon tetrachloride were used to produce the [[chlorofluorocarbon]] refrigerants R-11 ([[trichlorofluoromethane]]) and R-12 ([[dichlorodifluoromethane]]).

Composed primarily of schools from [[Texas]], at various times the conference included schools from [[Oklahoma]] and [[Arkansas]] as well, but not from the actual [[Southwestern United States]].\n\nFor most of its history, the core members of the conference were Texas-based schools plus one in Arkansas:  [[Rice University]], [[Southern Methodist University]], [[Texas A&M University]], [[Texas Christian University]], [[Baylor University]], the [[University of Arkansas]], and the [[University of Texas]].  After a long period of stability, the conference's overall athletic prowess began to decline throughout the 1980s, due in part to numerous member schools violating NCAA recruiting rules, culminating in the suspension of the entire SMU football program (\"death penalty\") for the 1987 and 1988 seasons. Arkansas, after years of feeling like an outsider in the conference, left after the 1990\u201391 school year to join the [[Southeastern Conference]], although they did compete in the SWC in football for the 1991 season.  Five years later, the conference precipitously broke up as Baylor, Texas, Texas A&M, and [[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]] (which had entered in 1956) combined with the members of the former [[Big Eight Conference]] to form a new league, the [[Big 12 Conference]], while Rice, SMU, TCU, and [[University of Houston|Houston]] (which entered the SWC in 1976) found homes in less prominent conferences (although TCU later joined the Big 12).\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Early years===\n[[L. Theo Bellmont]], the University of Texas athletic director sent out questionnaires to schools in Texas and neighboring states to gauge their interest in organizing an athletic conference. By March 1, 1914 a number of schools had responded favorably to the idea.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/san-antonio-light/1914-03-01/page-15?tag=southwestern+university+southwest+conference&rtserp=tags/southwestern-university?pep=southwest-conference&psb=dateasc&ndt=ex&pd=1&pm=3&py=1914&pci=7/|title=CONFERENCE SEEMS TO BE ASSURED FACT|date=1 March 1914|publisher=San Antonio Light|accessdate=28 November 2013|location=Austin, Texas}}</ref>\n\nThe first organizational meeting of the conference was set for April 30, 1914; since not all schools involved could send representatives to attend that date, it was ultimately held on May 5 and 7, 1914 at the Oriental Hotel in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/san-antonio-light/1914-04-19/page-16?tag=southwestern+university+southwest+conference&rtserp=tags/southwestern-university?pep=southwest-conference&psb=dateasc&ndt=ex&pd=19&pm=4&py=1914&pci=7/|title=DATE IN CHANGED|date=19 April 1914|publisher=San Antonio Light|accessdate=28 November 2013|location=Austin, Texas}}</ref> It was chaired by Bellmont, who originally wanted [[Louisiana State University]] and the [[University of Mississippi]] to join the conference as well, but they declined to do so. The Southwest Intercollegiate Athletic Conference became an official body on December 8, 1914, at a formal meeting at the Rice Hotel in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]].\n\nIts early years saw fluctuation in membership; Southwestern (a comparatively smaller school) dropped out of the conference in 1916, and [[Southern Methodist University]] (SMU) joined in 1918, while [[Texas Christian University]] (TCU) became a member in 1923. Rice University left the conference in 1916, only to rejoin in 1918.\n\n[[Phillips University]] was a conference member for one year (1920).  Oklahoma left in 1919 to join the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (later known as the [[Big Eight Conference]]), and was followed by Oklahoma A&M in 1925.  However, the series between Texas and Oklahoma would continue as a non-conference matchup in the annual [[Red River Rivalry]] game held in Dallas.  From 1925 until 1991, the University of Arkansas would be the only conference member not located within the state of [[Texas]].\n\n===Prime years===\nBy 1925, the conference's name was shortened to simply Southwest Conference.<ref name=TSHA />  After its organizational years, the conference settled into regularly scheduled meetings among its members, and began to gain stature nationwide. The SWC would be guided by seven commissioners, the first of whom, P. W. St. Clair, was appointed in 1938. In 1940, the conference took control of the then five-year-old [[Cotton Bowl Classic]], which further established the prestige of both the bowl and the conference. Texas Technological College (now [[Texas Tech University]]) joined the SWC in 1958, followed by the [[University of Houston]] for the 1976 season (Houston won the SWC football championship in its first season in the league).\n\n[[File:SWC (Foundation)-USA-states.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Southwest Conference, 1915\u20131925]]\n\nThe conference celebrated its glory football years in the 1960s, dominated by two teams, Texas and Arkansas.  Texas won the 1963 national championship, and Arkansas won a national championship in 1964 in the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) and Helms Athletic Foundation (HAF) polls.  In 1969, Texas won another national championship by beating #2-ranked Arkansas 15-14 in the regular season's final game (dubbed the \"Big Shootout\").  The [[1969 Texas vs. Arkansas football game|1969 Arkansas\u2013Texas game]] in [[Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium|Fayetteville, Arkansas]], attended by President Richard Nixon, is usually counted among the greatest college football games ever played.  Texas also won the 1970 United Press International (UPI) National Championship (i.e., the coaches' poll), which until 1974 was awarded prior to the bowl games.  Texas lost the Cotton Bowl Classic following the 1970 season to Notre Dame by a score of 24\u201311, giving the Associated Press (AP) Championship to Nebraska after they beat LSU by a score of 17\u201312 in the Orange Bowl.\n\nSince its first Cotton Bowl Classic and lasting until 1995, the Southwest Conference Champion automatically received an invitation as the \"host\" team in the Cotton Bowl Classic game on New Year's Day in Dallas. Opponents usually were the runners-up from the [[Big Eight Conference]] or the [[Southeastern Conference]], although [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independents]] [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] were also often featured.  From the 1940s onward, the Cotton Bowl Classic was counted among the four major bowl games, and often had national championship implications.  However, in the 1990s, the game declined in importance, largely because of the decline of SWC prominence.  In 1977, [[1977 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] became the last team to win a national championship in the Cotton Bowl Classic by beating Texas in the January 1978 game.\n\nThe SWC had many legendary players and coaches over the years. In football, [[John Heisman]], [[Dana X. Bible]], [[Bear Bryant|Paul \"Bear\" Bryant]], [[Darrell Royal]], [[Frank Broyles]], [[Hayden Fry]], [[Lou Holtz]], [[Bill Yeoman]], [[Gene Stallings]], and [[Grant Teaff]] all served as head coaches in the conference. Some notable SWC players included [[Davey O'Brien]], [[Sammy Baugh]], [[Bobby Layne]],  [[Doak Walker]], [[Tom Landry]], [[Bob Lilly]], [[Don Meredith]], [[Earl Campbell]], [[Andre Ware]], [[Mike Singletary]], [[John David Crow]], [[Lance Alworth]], [[Dan Hampton]], [[Steve Atwater]], [[Joe Ferguson]], and [[Eric Dickerson]]. The trio of kicking contemporaries [[Steve Little (American football)|Steve Little]] of Arkansas, [[Tony Franklin (kicker)|Tony Franklin]] of Texas A&M, and [[Russell Erxleben]] of Texas all kicked record setting field goals of 60 + yards in the same season.\n\nThe early 1980s were the glory years of SWC basketball, including the ''[[Phi Slama Jama]]'' teams at the [[Houston Cougars men's basketball|University of Houston]]. However, the most consistent program during the last quarter of the 20th century was the [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|University of Arkansas]] with Sweet 16 appearances in 1978, 1979, 1981, 1983, 1990, 1991, Elite 8 appearances in 1978, 1979, 1990 and 1991 and Final Four appearances in 1978 and 1990. Arkansas's famed Triplets, [[Marvin Delph]], [[Ron Brewer]] and [[Sidney Moncrief]], gave the rest of the league fits.  Furthermore, the Razorbacks' [[Lee Mayberry]], [[Todd Day]] and [[Oliver Miller]] won three straight SWC regular season and tournament titles from 1989\u20131991, the school's last three seasons in the conference.  The passion of Arkansas fans for their Razorbacks often overran the confines of SWC basketball venues, so much so, that Reunion Arena in Dallas (annual site of the SWC postseason tournament) was deemed \"[[Barnhill Arena|Barnhill]] South\" (after the Razorbacks' on-campus arena) based on the numbers and intensity of Hog fans present.\n\nOutstanding basketball coaches included [[Nolan Richardson]], [[Tom Penders]], [[Eddie Sutton]], [[Abe Lemons]], [[Guy Lewis|Guy V. Lewis]], [[Shelby Metcalf]] and [[Gerald Myers]]. Great SWC hoops players included the aforementioned ''Triplets'', [[Hakeem Olajuwon|Akeem Olajuwon]], [[Clyde Drexler]], [[Vinnie Johnson]], [[Jon Koncak]], [[Alvin Robertson]], [[Ricky Pierce]], [[Darrell Walker]], [[Joe Kleine]], Day, Mayberry, Miller and [[Ulysses Reed|U.S. Reed]], among others.\n\nThe [[Texas Longhorns baseball|Texas Longhorns]] baseball program under coach [[Cliff Gustafson]] won national titles in 1975 and 1983, as well as titles under [[Bibb Falk]] in 1949 and 1950. The [[Arkansas Razorbacks baseball|Arkansas Razorbacks]] also fielded fine teams that advanced to the College World Series. The Hogs finished 2nd in 1979, 3rd in 1985 and 5th in both the 1987 and 1989 seasons. The Hogs have continued this tradition since moving to the SEC, reaching the CWS four times under Arkansas alumnus [[Dave Van Horn]], and were the 2018 national runners-up. [[Texas A&M Aggies baseball|Texas A&M]] rose to power in the late 1980s, going 58-5 in 1989 before losing twice in the regional championship round on [[Olsen Field|its home field]] to [[LSU Tigers baseball|LSU]]. The Aggies reached the College World Series in 1993. [[Rice Owls baseball|Rice]] began its ascent to college baseball's elite in the conference's final years under coach [[Wayne Graham]], reaching the CWS in 1997, the year after the conference disbanded.\n\nThe [[Arkansas Razorbacks]] were dominant in track and field winning 15 SWC cross country team titles, 11 SWC indoor track team titles, 9 SWC outdoor track team titles and an incredible 8 SWC triple crowns (cross country, indoor track and outdoor track champions all in the same season). During their SWC days, the Razorbacks won 14 NCAA national team championships and one NCAA team triple crown. The list of Arkansas individual SWC champions and individual NCAA champions is long. Standout coaches and athletes include the legendary John McDonnell of Arkansas, the winningest coach in NCAA history regardless of sport. Baylor's [[Michael Johnson (sprinter)|Michael Johnson]], Texas A&M's [[Randy Matson]],  Rice's Fred Hansen, Houston's [[Carl Lewis]] and Arkansas' [[Mike Conley Sr.|Mike Conley]] all went on to win Olympic gold medals.\n\n===Final years===\n[[File:SWC (Dissolution)-USA-states.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Southwest Conference, 1925\u20131991]]\n[[File:1995 Bayou Bucket Classic game ball.jpg|thumb|The game ball from the 1995 [[Bayou Bucket Classic]], the last football game in Southwest Conference history]]\nThe 1980s saw many of the conference's athletic programs hit by recruiting scandals and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] probations.<ref name=\"probation1\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFDCUPCIU7kC&pg=PA372&lpg=PA372&dq=1980s+southwest+conference+probations&source=bl&ots=mR9p2hKUhl&sig=mg0RRUJEYAFQl4Ax6T5k-K_3MGY&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result SWC sanctions in the 1980s]</ref><ref name=\"probation2\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=Cmv5YNVTVCYC&pg=PA119 Probation history of the SWC]</ref><ref name=\"sportsillustrated\">[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1007325/3/index.htm 1995 Sports Illustrated article on the SWC]</ref>  The only programs to escape probation in the 1980s were Arkansas, Baylor, and Rice.<ref name=\"probation1\"/><ref name=\"sportsillustrated\" /><ref name=\"Houston History Magazine\">{{cite magazine|url=http://houstonhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SWC.pdf|title=The Break-Up of the Southwest Conference|magazine=Houston History|volume=10|number=3|via=houstonhistorymagazine.org|first=Auston|last=Fertak|date=July 2013|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref> Because of [[Southern Methodist University football scandal|repeated major violations]], in [[1987 NCAA Division I-A football season|1987]], the [[SMU Mustangs football]] program became only the third in NCAA history to receive the so-called [[Death penalty (NCAA)|\"Death Penalty\"]] (after [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] basketball in 1952\u201353 and [[Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns men's basketball|Southwestern Louisiana]] basketball from 1973 to 1975). The NCAA canceled SMU's 1987 season, and limited it to seven road games for 1988.  However, nearly all of the school's lettermen transferred elsewhere, forcing SMU to keep its football program shuttered for 1988 as well.  SMU also remained on probation until [[1990 NCAA Division I-A football season|1990]].  At that time, NCAA rules prohibited schools on probation from appearing on live [[television]]. As a result, the conference's market share in television coverage dwindled.\n\nThe SWC's performance in football declined precipitously. The last SWC football champion to win a bowl game was Texas A&M, who beat Notre Dame in the 1988 Cotton Bowl Classic by a score of 35-10. Since then, the final eight SWC champions lost in their bowl games. After SMU's second-place finish in most polls in 1982, SWC programs usually were not serious contenders for the national title.  Texas had strong teams in 1981, 1983, 1990, and 1995. Arkansas had strong teams in 1988 and 1989, and Texas A&M was strong from 1985 to 1995, but by the end of their respective seasons none were able to remain in the national championship hunt.\n\n====The last days of the College Football Association====\nOn June 27, 1984, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma]]'' that the NCAA could not punish its membership for selling their media content. As a result, individual schools and athletic conferences were freed to negotiate contracts on their own behalf.\n\nThe [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] and [[Pac-12 Conference|Pacific-10]] conferences sold their rights to ABC.  Most of the rest of the Division I-A football programs (what is now called the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]]) chose to sell their rights together through an organization called the [[College Football Association]] to [[College Football on ABC|ABC]] and [[SEC on CBS|CBS]].  The primary function of the CFA was to negotiate television broadcast rights for its member conferences and independent colleges.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nBy [[1990 NCAA Division I-A football season|1990]], the television landscape had changed and a number of the stronger programs saw opportunities for better deals outside of the CFA. Notre Dame left the CFA and sold their home game broadcast rights to [[Notre Dame Football on NBC|NBC]].<ref name=\"1991 NBC Deal\">{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Sandomir|title= COLLEGE FOOTBALL; Notre Dame Scored a $38 Million Touchdown on Its TV Deal|work=New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|date=1991-08-25|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0D91038F936A1575BC0A967958260 |accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Southeastern Conference invited the University of Arkansas and the University of South Carolina to join the conference in 1990, it created shockwaves across the CFA.  The other conferences in the CFA correctly assumed the SEC made these additions to create a better TV product with the idea of leaving the CFA.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe SEC represented one of the more valuable assets in the CFA.  It seemed likely if the SEC departed, the other conferences could have quite a difficult time securing good TV deals.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nIn February 1994, the [[Southeastern Conference]] announced that they would be leaving the CFA and negotiate independently for a television deal that covered SEC schools only.  This led ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' to proclaim that \"the College Football Association as a television entity is dead\".<ref name=\"SEC LEAVES CFA\">{{cite web | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/335883/SEC-OFFICIALLY-LEAVES-CFA-BIG-EAST-WILL-FOLLOW-SOON.html?pg=all | title=SEC OFFICIALLY LEAVES CFA; BIG EAST WILL FOLLOW SOON | work=The Dallas Morning News | date=February 12, 1994 | accessdate=August 25, 2012 | author=Maisel, Ivan}}</ref>  In 1995, the SEC and the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]] broke from the CFA, signing a national deal with CBS.  The SEC would earn a staggering $95 million from the deal.  More significantly, this change in television contracts ultimately would lead to significant realignment of college conferences.\n\nIn 1990, Arkansas announced its departure for the [[Southeastern Conference]], marking the beginning of the end for the Southwest Conference.  In March 1994, Texas, Texas A&M, Baylor, and Texas Tech accepted invitations to join with the members of the [[Big Eight Conference]] to form the [[Big 12 Conference]].  Soon afterward, SMU, TCU, and Rice accepted invitations to join the [[Western Athletic Conference]], while Houston became a charter member of [[Conference USA]].  In May 1996, after the completion of championship matches in [[baseball]] and [[Track and field|track & field]], the Southwest Conference was officially dissolved.\n\nOver the course of its 82-year history, teams of the Southwest Conference garnered 64 recognized national championships in collegiate sports.\n\nIn 1997, the official records of the conference from 1914 to 1996 were moved from Dallas to the campus of [[Texas Tech University]], becoming part of the Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library.

Composed primarily of schools from [[Texas]], at various times the conference included schools from [[Oklahoma]] and [[Arkansas]] as well, but not from the actual [[Southwestern United States]].\n\nFor most of its history, the core members of the conference were Texas-based schools plus one in Arkansas:  [[Rice University]], [[Southern Methodist University]], [[Texas A&M University]], [[Texas Christian University]], [[Baylor University]], the [[University of Arkansas]], and the [[University of Texas]].  After a long period of stability, the conference's overall athletic prowess began to decline throughout the 1980s, due in part to numerous member schools violating NCAA recruiting rules, culminating in the suspension of the entire SMU football program (\"death penalty\") for the 1987 and 1988 seasons. Arkansas, after years of feeling like an outsider in the conference, left after the 1990\u201391 school year to join the [[Southeastern Conference]], although they did compete in the SWC in football for the 1991 season.  Five years later, the conference precipitously broke up as Baylor, Texas, Texas A&M, and [[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]] (which had entered in 1956) combined with the members of the former [[Big Eight Conference]] to form a new league, the [[Big 12 Conference]], while Rice, SMU, TCU, and [[University of Houston|Houston]] (which entered the SWC in 1976) found homes in less prominent conferences (although TCU later joined the Big 12).\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Early years===\n[[L. Theo Bellmont]], the University of Texas athletic director sent out questionnaires to schools in Texas and neighboring states to gauge their interest in organizing an athletic conference. By March 1, 1914 a number of schools had responded favorably to the idea.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/san-antonio-light/1914-03-01/page-15?tag=southwestern+university+southwest+conference&rtserp=tags/southwestern-university?pep=southwest-conference&psb=dateasc&ndt=ex&pd=1&pm=3&py=1914&pci=7/|title=CONFERENCE SEEMS TO BE ASSURED FACT|date=1 March 1914|publisher=San Antonio Light|accessdate=28 November 2013|location=Austin, Texas}}</ref>\n\nThe first organizational meeting of the conference was set for April 30, 1914; since not all schools involved could send representatives to attend that date, it was ultimately held on May 5 and 7, 1914 at the Oriental Hotel in [[Dallas, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/san-antonio-light/1914-04-19/page-16?tag=southwestern+university+southwest+conference&rtserp=tags/southwestern-university?pep=southwest-conference&psb=dateasc&ndt=ex&pd=19&pm=4&py=1914&pci=7/|title=DATE IN CHANGED|date=19 April 1914|publisher=San Antonio Light|accessdate=28 November 2013|location=Austin, Texas}}</ref> It was chaired by Bellmont, who originally wanted [[Louisiana State University]] and the [[University of Mississippi]] to join the conference as well, but they declined to do so. The Southwest Intercollegiate Athletic Conference became an official body on December 8, 1914, at a formal meeting at the Rice Hotel in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]].\n\nIts early years saw fluctuation in membership; Southwestern (a comparatively smaller school) dropped out of the conference in 1916, and [[Southern Methodist University]] (SMU) joined in 1918, while [[Texas Christian University]] (TCU) became a member in 1923. Rice University left the conference in 1916, only to re-join in 1918.\n\n[[Phillips University]] was a conference member for one year (1920).  Oklahoma left in 1919 to join the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (later known as the [[Big Eight Conference]]), and was followed by Oklahoma A&M in 1925.  However, the series between Texas and Oklahoma would continue as a non-conference matchup in the annual [[Red River Rivalry]] game held in Dallas.  From 1925 until 1991, the University of Arkansas would be the only conference member not located within the state of [[Texas]].\n\n===Prime years===\nBy 1925, the conference's name was shortened to simply Southwest Conference.<ref name=TSHA />  After its organizational years, the conference settled into regularly scheduled meetings among its members, and began to gain stature nationwide. The SWC would be guided by seven commissioners, the first of whom, P. W. St. Clair, was appointed in 1938. In 1940, the conference took control of the then five-year-old [[Cotton Bowl Classic]], which further established the prestige of both the bowl and the conference. Texas Technological College (now [[Texas Tech University]]) joined the SWC in 1958, followed by the [[University of Houston]] for the 1976 season (Houston won the SWC football championship in its first season in the league).\n\n[[File:SWC (Foundation)-USA-states.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Southwest Conference, 1915\u20131925]]\n\nThe conference celebrated its glory football years in the 1960s, dominated by two teams, Texas and Arkansas.  Texas won the 1963 national championship, and Arkansas won a national championship in 1964 in the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) and Helms Athletic Foundation (HAF) polls.  In 1969, Texas won another national championship by beating #2-ranked Arkansas 15-14 in the regular season's final game (dubbed the \"Big Shootout\").  The [[1969 Texas vs. Arkansas football game|1969 Arkansas\u2013Texas game]] in [[Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium|Fayetteville, Arkansas]], attended by President Richard Nixon, is usually counted among the greatest college football games ever played.  Texas also won the 1970 United Press International (UPI) National Championship (i.e., the coaches' poll), which until 1974 was awarded prior to the bowl games.  Texas lost the Cotton Bowl Classic following the 1970 season to Notre Dame by a score of 24\u201311, giving the Associated Press (AP) Championship to Nebraska after they beat LSU by a score of 17\u201312 in the Orange Bowl.\n\nSince its first Cotton Bowl Classic and lasting until 1995, the Southwest Conference Champion automatically received an invitation as the \"host\" team in the Cotton Bowl Classic game on New Year's Day in Dallas. Opponents usually were the runners-up from the [[Big Eight Conference]] or the [[Southeastern Conference]], although [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independents]] [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] were also often featured.  From the 1940s onward, the Cotton Bowl Classic was counted among the four major bowl games, and often had national championship implications.  However, in the 1990s, the game declined in importance, largely because of the decline of SWC prominence.  In 1977, [[1977 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] became the last team to win a national championship in the Cotton Bowl Classic by beating Texas in the January 1978 game.\n\nThe SWC had many legendary players and coaches over the years. In football, [[John Heisman]], [[Dana X. Bible]], [[Bear Bryant|Paul \"Bear\" Bryant]], [[Darrell Royal]], [[Frank Broyles]], [[Hayden Fry]], [[Lou Holtz]], [[Bill Yeoman]], [[Gene Stallings]], and [[Grant Teaff]] all served as head coaches in the conference. Some notable SWC players included [[Davey O'Brien]], [[Sammy Baugh]], [[Bobby Layne]],  [[Doak Walker]], [[Tom Landry]], [[Bob Lilly]], [[Don Meredith]], [[Earl Campbell]], [[Andre Ware]], [[Mike Singletary]], [[John David Crow]], [[Lance Alworth]], [[Dan Hampton]], [[Steve Atwater]], [[Joe Ferguson]], and [[Eric Dickerson]]. The trio of kicking contemporaries [[Steve Little (American football)|Steve Little]] of Arkansas, [[Tony Franklin (kicker)|Tony Franklin]] of Texas A&M, and [[Russell Erxleben]] of Texas all kicked record setting field goals of 60 + yards in the same season.\n\nThe early 1980s were the glory years of SWC basketball, including the ''[[Phi Slama Jama]]'' teams at the [[Houston Cougars men's basketball|University of Houston]]. However, the most consistent program during the last quarter of the 20th century was the [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|University of Arkansas]] with Sweet 16 appearances in 1978, 1979, 1981, 1983, 1990, 1991, Elite 8 appearances in 1978, 1979, 1990 and 1991 and Final Four appearances in 1978 and 1990. Arkansas's famed Triplets, [[Marvin Delph]], [[Ron Brewer]] and [[Sidney Moncrief]], gave the rest of the league fits.  Furthermore, the Razorbacks' [[Lee Mayberry]], [[Todd Day]] and [[Oliver Miller]] won three straight SWC regular season and tournament titles from 1989\u20131991, the school's last three seasons in the conference.  The passion of Arkansas fans for their Razorbacks often overran the confines of SWC basketball venues, so much so, that Reunion Arena in Dallas (annual site of the SWC postseason tournament) was deemed \"[[Barnhill Arena|Barnhill]] South\" (after the Razorbacks' on-campus arena) based on the numbers and intensity of Hog fans present.\n\nOutstanding basketball coaches included [[Nolan Richardson]], [[Tom Penders]], [[Eddie Sutton]], [[Abe Lemons]], [[Guy Lewis|Guy V. Lewis]], [[Shelby Metcalf]] and [[Gerald Myers]]. Great SWC hoops players included the aforementioned ''Triplets'', [[Hakeem Olajuwon|Akeem Olajuwon]], [[Clyde Drexler]], [[Vinnie Johnson]], [[Jon Koncak]], [[Alvin Robertson]], [[Ricky Pierce]], [[Darrell Walker]], [[Joe Kleine]], Day, Mayberry, Miller and [[Ulysses Reed|U.S. Reed]], among others.\n\nThe [[Texas Longhorns baseball|Texas Longhorns]] baseball program under coach [[Cliff Gustafson]] won national titles in 1975 and 1983, as well as titles under [[Bibb Falk]] in 1949 and 1950. The [[Arkansas Razorbacks baseball|Arkansas Razorbacks]] also fielded fine teams that advanced to the College World Series. The Hogs finished 2nd in 1979, 3rd in 1985 and 5th in both the 1987 and 1989 seasons. The Hogs have continued this tradition since moving to the SEC, reaching the CWS four times under Arkansas alumnus [[Dave Van Horn]], and were the 2018 national runners-up. [[Texas A&M Aggies baseball|Texas A&M]] rose to power in the late 1980s, going 58-5 in 1989 before losing twice in the regional championship round on [[Olsen Field|its home field]] to [[LSU Tigers baseball|LSU]]. The Aggies reached the College World Series in 1993. [[Rice Owls baseball|Rice]] began its ascent to college baseball's elite in the conference's final years under coach [[Wayne Graham]], reaching the CWS in 1997, the year after the conference disbanded.\n\nThe [[Arkansas Razorbacks]] were dominant in track and field winning 15 SWC cross country team titles, 11 SWC indoor track team titles, 9 SWC outdoor track team titles and an incredible 8 SWC triple crowns (cross country, indoor track and outdoor track champions all in the same season). During their SWC days, the Razorbacks won 14 NCAA national team championships and one NCAA team triple crown. The list of Arkansas individual SWC champions and individual NCAA champions is long. Standout coaches and athletes include the legendary John McDonnell of Arkansas, the winningest coach in NCAA history regardless of sport. Baylor's [[Michael Johnson (sprinter)|Michael Johnson]], Texas A&M's [[Randy Matson]],  Rice's Fred Hansen, Houston's [[Carl Lewis]] and Arkansas' [[Mike Conley Sr.|Mike Conley]] all went on to win Olympic gold medals.\n\n===Final years===\n[[File:SWC (Dissolution)-USA-states.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Southwest Conference, 1925\u20131991]]\n[[File:1995 Bayou Bucket Classic game ball.jpg|thumb|The game ball from the 1995 [[Bayou Bucket Classic]], the last football game in Southwest Conference history]]\nThe 1980s saw many of the conference's athletic programs hit by recruiting scandals and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] probations.<ref name=\"probation1\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFDCUPCIU7kC&pg=PA372&lpg=PA372&dq=1980s+southwest+conference+probations&source=bl&ots=mR9p2hKUhl&sig=mg0RRUJEYAFQl4Ax6T5k-K_3MGY&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result SWC sanctions in the 1980s]</ref><ref name=\"probation2\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=Cmv5YNVTVCYC&pg=PA119 Probation history of the SWC]</ref><ref name=\"sportsillustrated\">[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1007325/3/index.htm 1995 Sports Illustrated article on the SWC]</ref>  The only programs to escape probation in the 1980s were Arkansas, Baylor, and Rice.<ref name=\"probation1\"/><ref name=\"sportsillustrated\" /><ref name=\"Houston History Magazine\">{{cite magazine|url=http://houstonhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SWC.pdf|title=The Break-Up of the Southwest Conference|magazine=Houston History|volume=10|number=3|via=houstonhistorymagazine.org|first=Auston|last=Fertak|date=July 2013|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref> Because of [[Southern Methodist University football scandal|repeated major violations]], in [[1987 NCAA Division I-A football season|1987]], the [[SMU Mustangs football]] program became only the third in NCAA history to receive the so-called [[Death penalty (NCAA)|\"Death Penalty\"]] (after [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] basketball in 1952\u201353 and [[Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns men's basketball|Southwestern Louisiana]] basketball from 1973 to 1975). The NCAA canceled SMU's 1987 season, and limited it to seven road games for 1988.  However, nearly all of the school's lettermen transferred elsewhere, forcing SMU to keep its football program shuttered for 1988 as well.  SMU also remained on probation until [[1990 NCAA Division I-A football season|1990]].  At that time, NCAA rules prohibited schools on probation from appearing on live [[television]]. As a result, the conference's market share in television coverage dwindled.\n\nThe SWC's performance in football declined precipitously. The last SWC football champion to win a bowl game was Texas A&M, who beat Notre Dame in the 1988 Cotton Bowl Classic by a score of 35-10. Since then, the final eight SWC champions lost in their bowl games. After SMU's second-place finish in most polls in 1982, SWC programs usually were not serious contenders for the national title.  Texas had strong teams in 1981, 1983, 1990, and 1995. Arkansas had strong teams in 1988 and 1989, and Texas A&M was strong from 1985 to 1995, but by the end of their respective seasons none were able to remain in the national championship hunt.\n\n====The last days of the College Football Association====\nOn June 27, 1984, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma]]'' that the NCAA could not punish its membership for selling their media content. As a result, individual schools and athletic conferences were freed to negotiate contracts on their own behalf.\n\nThe [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] and [[Pac-12 Conference|Pacific-10]] conferences sold their rights to ABC.  Most of the rest of the Division I-A football programs (what is now called the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]]) chose to sell their rights together through an organization called the [[College Football Association]] to [[College Football on ABC|ABC]] and [[SEC on CBS|CBS]].  The primary function of the CFA was to negotiate television broadcast rights for its member conferences and independent colleges.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nBy [[1990 NCAA Division I-A football season|1990]], the television landscape had changed and a number of the stronger programs saw opportunities for better deals outside of the CFA. Notre Dame left the CFA and sold their home game broadcast rights to [[Notre Dame Football on NBC|NBC]].<ref name=\"1991 NBC Deal\">{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Sandomir|title= COLLEGE FOOTBALL; Notre Dame Scored a $38 Million Touchdown on Its TV Deal|work=New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|date=1991-08-25|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0D91038F936A1575BC0A967958260 |accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Southeastern Conference invited the University of Arkansas and the University of South Carolina to join the conference in 1990, it created shockwaves across the CFA.  The other conferences in the CFA correctly assumed the SEC made these additions to create a better TV product with the idea of leaving the CFA.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe SEC represented one of the more valuable assets in the CFA.  It seemed likely if the SEC departed, the other conferences could have quite a difficult time securing good TV deals.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nIn February 1994, the [[Southeastern Conference]] announced that they would be leaving the CFA and negotiate independently for a television deal that covered SEC schools only.  This led ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' to proclaim that \"the College Football Association as a television entity is dead\".<ref name=\"SEC LEAVES CFA\">{{cite web | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/335883/SEC-OFFICIALLY-LEAVES-CFA-BIG-EAST-WILL-FOLLOW-SOON.html?pg=all | title=SEC OFFICIALLY LEAVES CFA; BIG EAST WILL FOLLOW SOON | work=The Dallas Morning News | date=February 12, 1994 | accessdate=August 25, 2012 | author=Maisel, Ivan}}</ref>  In 1995, the SEC and the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]] broke from the CFA, signing a national deal with CBS.  The SEC would earn a staggering $95 million from the deal.  More significantly, this change in television contracts ultimately would lead to significant realignment of college conferences.\n\nIn 1990, Arkansas announced its departure for the [[Southeastern Conference]], marking the beginning of the end for the Southwest Conference.  In March 1994, Texas, Texas A&M, Baylor, and Texas Tech accepted invitations to join with the members of the [[Big Eight Conference]] to form the [[Big 12 Conference]].  Soon afterward, SMU, TCU, and Rice accepted invitations to join the [[Western Athletic Conference]], while Houston became a charter member of [[Conference USA]].  In May 1996, after the completion of championship matches in [[baseball]] and [[Track and field|track & field]], the Southwest Conference was officially dissolved.\n\nOver the course of its 82-year history, teams of the Southwest Conference garnered 64 recognized national championships in collegiate sports.\n\nIn 1997, the official records of the conference from 1914 to 1996 were moved from Dallas to the campus of [[Texas Tech University]], becoming part of the Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library. The archive also contains an extensive assortment of images and memorabilia from each member university.\n\n==Members==\n{{Location map+|Texas|width=400|caption=|relief=no|places=\n   {{Location map~|Texas|label=Arkansas|position=bottom|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=Arkansas Razorbacks|lat=36.076389|long=-94.160833}}\n   {{Location map~|Texas|label=Baylor|position=top|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=Baylor Bears | lat=31.54861 | long=-97.11667}}\n   {{Location map~|Texas|label=Houston|position=left|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=Houston Cougars|lat=29.718922|long=-95.339162}}\n   {{Location map~|Texas|label=Rice|position=right|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=Rice Owls|lat=29.71694|long=-95.40278}}\n   {{Location map~|Texas|label=SMU|position=top|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=SMU Mustangs|lat=32.841|long=-96.784}}\n   {{Location map~|Texas|label=TCU|position=left|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=TCU Horned Frogs|lat=32.70961|long=-97.62823}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Texas | position=bottom | mark=Blue pog.svg | link=Texas Longhorns| lat=30.2849 | long=-97.7341}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Texas<br>A&M | position=right | mark=Blue pog.svg | link=Texas A&M Aggies | lat=30.6187 | long=-96.3365}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Texas<br>Tech | position=top | mark=Blue pog.svg | link=Texas Tech Red Raiders | lat=33.5843 | long=-101.8783}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Southwestern | position=left | mark=Yellow pog.svg | link=Southwestern Pirates | lat=30.636 | long=-97.6648}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Phillips | position=left | mark=Yellow pog.svg | link=Phillips University | lat=36.396944 | long=-97.844722}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Oklahoma| position=bottom| mark=Yellow pog.svg | link=Oklahoma Sooners | lat=35.208611 | long=-97.445833}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Oklahoma State | position=right | mark=Yellow pog.svg | link=Oklahoma State Cowboys | lat=36.132222 | long=-97.080833}}\n}}\n\n*[[University of Arkansas|Arkansas]] (1915\u20131991)\n*[[Baylor University|Baylor]] (1915\u20131996)\n*[[University of Houston|Houston]] (1972\u20131996)\n*[[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]] (1915\u20131919)\n*[[Oklahoma State University-Stillwater|Oklahoma A&M]] (1915\u20131925)\n*[[Phillips University|Phillips]] (1920)\n*[[Rice University|Rice]] (1915\u20131917 provisional, 1918\u20131996)\n*[[Southern Methodist University|SMU]] (1918\u20131996)\n*[[Southwestern University|Southwestern]] (1915\u20131916)\n*[[University of Texas|Texas]] (1915\u20131996)\n*[[Texas A&M University|Texas A&M]] (1915\u20131996)\n*[[Texas Christian University|TCU]] (1923\u20131996)\n*[[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]] (1956\u20131996)\n\nNote:  Houston was invited to join the SWC in March 1971, and began play in all sports except football and basketball in 1972\u201373.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/6869578/|title=On the Threshold of Respectability|date=28 March 1971|newspaper=Lubbock Avalanche Journal|accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref> Cougar basketball joined the fray in 1975\u201376, and football was last to join for the 1976\u201377 school year.\n\n===Membership timeline===\n<timeline>\nDateFormat = yyyy\nImageSize  = width:750 height:auto barincrement:24\nPeriod     = from:1915 till:1998\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nPlotArea   = right:0 left:0 bottom:50 top:0\n\nColors = id:barcolor value:black\n         id:line     value:black\n         id:bg       value:white\n\nPlotData=\n  width:20 textcolor:black shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:s\n\n  bar:1  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1916 text:[[Southwestern University|Southwestern]] (1915\u20131916)\n  bar:2  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1919 text:[[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]] (1915\u20131919)\n  bar:3  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1925 text:[[Oklahoma State University-Stillwater|Oklahoma State]] (1915\u20131925)\n  bar:4  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1991 text:[[University of Arkansas|Arkansas]] (1915\u20131991)\n  bar:5  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1996 text:[[Baylor University|Baylor]] (1915\u20131996)\n  bar:6  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1996 text:[[Rice University|Rice]] (1915\u20131996)\n  bar:7  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1996 text:[[University of Texas|Texas]] (1915\u20131996)\n  bar:8  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1996 text:[[Texas A&amp;M University|Texas A&M]] (1915\u20131996)\n  bar:9  color:powderblue from:1918 till:1996 text:[[Southern Methodist University|SMU]] (1918\u20131996)\n  bar:10 color:powderblue from:1920 till:1921 text:[[Phillips University|Phillips]] (1920)\n  bar:11 color:powderblue from:1923 till:1996 text:[[Texas Christian University|TCU]] (1923\u20131996)\n  bar:12 color:powderblue from:1956 till:1996 text:[[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]] (1956\u20131996)\n  bar:13 color:yellow from:1972 till:1976 text:[[University of Houston|Houston]] (1972 Olympic sports;

Trance tracks often use one central \"[[Hook (music)|hook]]\", or melody, which runs through almost the entire song, repeating at intervals anywhere between 2 beats and 32 bars, in addition to harmonies and motifs in different timbres from the central melody.<ref name=\"snomanmanual\" /> Instruments are added or removed every 4, 8, 16, or 32 bars.<ref name=\"snomanmanual\" />\n\nIn the section before the breakdown, the lead motif is often introduced in a sliced up and simplified form,<ref name=\"snomanmanual\" /> to give the audience a \"taste\" of what they will hear after the breakdown.<ref name=\"snomanmanual\" /> Then later, the final climax is usually \"a culmination of the first part of the track mixed with the main melodic reprise\".<ref name=\"snomanmanual\" />\n\nAs is the case with many dance music tracks, trance tracks are usually built with sparser intros (\"mix-ins\") and outros (\"mix-outs\") in order to enable DJs to blend them together immediately.<ref name=\"tranceexperience\" /><ref name=\"snomanmanual\" />\n\nMore recent forms of trance music incorporate other styles and elements of electronic music such as [[electro house|electro]] and [[progressive house]] into its production. It emphasizes harsher basslines and drum beats which decrease the importance of offbeats and focus primarily on a [[four on the floor (music)|four on the floor]] stylistic house drum pattern. The BPM of more recent styles tends to be on par with [[house music]] at 120 to 135 beats per minute. However, unlike house music, recent forms of trance stay true to their melodic breakdowns and longer transitions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Paterson|first=Angus|title=Above & Beyond talk shop on Australian tour & 'trance 2.0'|url=http://www.inthemix.com.au/news/51084/Above_Beyond_talk_shop_on_Australian_tour_trance_20|work=inthemix|publisher=nthemix Pty Ltd|access-date=13 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Subgenres==\n{{Main|List of trance genres|List of electronic music genres}}\nTrance music is broken into a number of subgenres including [[acid trance]], classic trance, [[hard trance]], [[progressive music|progressive]] trance,<ref name=\"tranceexperience\" /> and [[uplifting trance]].<ref name=\"tranceexperience\" /> [[Uplifting trance]] is also known as \"anthem trance\", \"epic trance\",<ref name=\"tranceexperience\" /> \"commercial trance\",  \"stadium trance\", or \"euphoric trance\",<ref name=\"snomanmanual\" /> and has been strongly influenced by classical music in the 1990s<ref name=\"tranceexperience\" /> and 2000s by leading artists such as [[Ferry Corsten]], [[Armin Van Buuren]], [[Ti\u00ebsto]], [[Mike Dierickx|Push]], [[Rank 1]] and at present with the development of the subgenre \"orchestral uplifting trance\" or \"uplifting trance with symphonic orchestra\" by such artists as Sound Apparel, [[Andy Blueman]], Ciro Visone, Soundlift, Arctic Moon, and Sergey Nevone & Simon O'Shine, among others. Closely related to Uplifting Trance is [[Eurodance|Euro-trance]], which has become a general term for a wide variety of highly commercialized European dance music. Several subgenres are crossovers with other major genres of electronic music.

Emphasizing the smoother sound of [[Eurodance]] or house (and occasionally more reminiscent of [[Jean-Michel Jarre]] than [[Basement Jaxx]]), Progressive Trance became the sound of the world's dance floors by the end of the millennium.

Matrix proteins inside the envelope stabilise virus structure. The nucleocapsid core is composed of the genomic RNA, nucleocapsid proteins, phosphoproteins and polymerase proteins.\n\n== Genome structure ==\n[[File:Paramyxovirus genome structure.png|thumb|Paramyxovirus genome structure]]\nThe [[genome]] is nonsegmented, negative-sense RNA, 15\u201319 kilobases in length, and contains six to 10 genes. Extracistronic (noncoding) regions include:\n*A 3\u2019 leader sequence, 50 [[nucleotides]] in length, which acts as a [[Transcription (genetics)|transcriptional]] promoter.\n*A 5\u2019 trailer sequence, 50\u2013161 nucleotides long\n*Intergenomic regions between each [[gene]], which are three nucleotides long for morbilliviruses, respiroviruses, and henipaviruses, and variable length (one-56 nucleotides) for rubulaviruses.\n\nEach gene contains transcription start/stop signals at the beginning and end, which are transcribed as part of the gene.\n\nGene sequence within the genome is conserved across the family due to a phenomenon known as transcriptional polarity (see ''[[Mononegavirales]]'') in which genes closest to the 3\u2019 end of the genome are transcribed in greater abundance than those towards the 5\u2019 end. This is a result of structure of the genome. After each gene is transcribed, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase pauses to release the new mRNA when it encounters an intergenic sequence. When the RNA polymerase is paused,  a chance exists that it will dissociate from the RNA genome. If it dissociates, it must re-enter the genome at the leader sequence, rather than continuing to transcribe the length of the genome. The result is that the further downstream genes are from the leader sequence, the less they will be transcribed by RNA polymerase.\n\nEvidence for a single promoter model was verified when viruses were exposed to UV light. UV radiation can cause dimerization of RNA, which prevents transcription by RNA polymerase. If the viral genome follows a multiple promoter model, the level inhibition of transcription should correlate with the length of the RNA gene. However, the genome was best described by a single promoter model. When paramyxovirus genome was exposed to UV light, the level of inhibition of transcription was proportional to the distance from the leader sequence. That is, the further the gene is from the leader sequence, the greater the chance of RNA dimerization inhibiting RNA polymerase.\n\nThe virus takes advantage of the single promoter model by having its genes arranged in relative order of protein needed for successful infection. For example, nucleocapsid protein, N, is needed in greater amounts than RNA polymerase, L.\n\nViruses in the ''Paramyxoviridae'' family are also antigenically stable, meaning that the glycoproteins on the viruses are consistent between different strains of the same type. Two reasons for this phenomenon are posited: The first is that the genome is nonsegmented, thus cannot undergo [[reassortment|genetic reassortment]]. For this process to occur, segments needed as reassortment happen when segments from different strains are mixed together to create a new strain. With no segments, nothing can be mixed with one another, so no [[antigenic shift]] occurs. The second reason relates to the idea of [[antigenic drift]]. Since RNA-dependent RNA polymerase does not have an error-checking function, many mutations are made when the RNA is processed. These mutations build up and eventually new strains are created. Due to this concept, one would expect that paramyxoviruses should not be antigenically stable; however, the opposite is seen to be true. The main hypothesis behind why the viruses are antigenically stable is that each protein and amino acid has an important function. Thus, any mutation would lead to a decrease or total loss of function, which would in turn cause the new virus to be less efficient. These viruses would not be able to survive as long compared to the more virulent strains, and so would die out.\n\nMany paramyxovirus genomes follow the [[Rule of six (viruses)|\"rule of six\"]]. The total length of the genome is almost always a multiple of six. This is probably due to the advantage of having all RNA bound by N protein (since N binds hexamers of RNA). If RNA is left exposed, the virus does not replicate efficiently. The gene sequence is:\n\n*Nucleocapsid \u2013 phosphoprotein \u2013 matrix \u2013 fusion \u2013 attachment \u2013 large (polymerase)\n\n== Proteins ==\n*'''N''' \u2013 the nucleocapsid protein associates with genomic RNA (one molecule per hexamer) and protects the RNA from nuclease digestion\n*'''P''' \u2013 the phosphoprotein binds to the N and L proteins and forms part of the RNA polymerase complex\n*'''M''' \u2013 the matrix protein assembles between the envelope and the nucleocapsid core, it organizes and maintains virion structure\n*'''F''' \u2013 the fusion protein projects from the envelope surface as a trimer, and mediates [[viral entry|cell entry]] by inducing fusion between the viral envelope and the cell membrane by class I fusion.

HN ([[Hemagglutinin-neuraminidase]]) attachment proteins occur in respiroviruses, rubulaviruses and avulaviruses. These possess both haemagglutination and [[neuraminidase]] activity, which cleaves sialic acid on the cell surface, preventing viral particles from reattaching to previously infected cells.

There are four types of HPIVs, known as HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3 and HPIV-4. HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 may cause cold-like symptoms, along with [[croup]] in children.

Some paramyxoviruses such as the henipaviruses are [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] pathogens, occurring naturally in an animal host, but also able to infect humans.\n\nHendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) in the genus ''[[Henipavirus]]'' have emerged in humans and livestock in [[Australia]] and Southeast [[Asia]]. Both viruses are [[Contagious disease|contagious]], highly [[virulent]], and capable of infecting a number of mammalian species and causing potentially fatal disease.

Using pneumoviruses (mononegaviral family ''[[Pneumoviridae]]'') as an outgroup, paramyxoviruses can be divided into two clades: one consisting of avulaviruses and rubulaviruses and one consisting of respiroviruses, henipaviruses, and morbilliviruses.<ref name=McCarthy2010>{{cite journal |vauthors=McCarthy AJ, Goodman SJ |title=Reassessing conflicting evolutionary histories of the Paramyxoviridae and the origins of respiroviruses with Bayesian multigene phylogenies |journal=Infect.
