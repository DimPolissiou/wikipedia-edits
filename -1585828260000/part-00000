Named the Common European Asylum System (CEAS), the system sought to address three key problems which consisted of asylum shopping, differing outcomes in different EU Member States for those seeking asylum, and differing social benefits in different EU Member States for those seeking asylum.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.mjilonline.org/the-common-european-asylum-system-its-history-content-and-shortcomings/|title=The Common European Asylum System: Its History, Content, and Shortcomings \u2013 The Michigan Journal of International Law|last=Raithel|first=Silvia|date=2016-02-09|work=The Michigan Journal of International Law|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to address these issues, the European Commission created five components that sought to fulfill minimum standards for asylum:<ref name=\":03\" />\n* The Asylum Procedures Directive\n* The Receptions Conditions Directive\n* The Qualification Directive\n* The Dublin regulation\n* The Eurodac Regulation\nCompleted in 2005, the Common European Asylum System sought to protect the rights those seeking asylum.

Due to this divided asylum system and problems with the Dublin system, the European Commission proposed a reform of the Common European Asylum System in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/explainers/understanding-migration-and-asylum-european-union|title=The EU Has a Solidarity Crisis.

It hosts 16.209 migrants on its island and 33.650 migrants on the mainland, most of whom are women and children. Because of lack of water, medical care and security protection witnessed by the Euro- Med monitor team- especially with the arrival of winter, they are at risk of serious deterioration in health, mostly children and pregnant women. 1,500 refugees were, accordingly, moved into other places since their camps were deluged with snow, but relocation of the refugees always came too late after they lived without electricity and heating devices for too long. It also showed that there is a lack of access to legal services and security protection to the refugees and migrants in the camps; there is no trust between the resident and the protection offices, paving a path for some people to report crimes and illegal acts in the camps. In addition, the migrants are subject to regular xenophobic attacks, fascist violence, forced strip searches at the hands of residents and police and detention. The women living in the Athens settlements and the [[Vasilika refugee camp|Vasilika]], [[Softex]] and [[Diavata]] camps feel worried about their children as they may be subjected to sexual abuse, trafficking and drug use. As a result, some of the refugees and migrants commit suicide, burn property and protest. Finally, it clarified the difficulties the refugees face when entering into Greece; more than 16,000 people are trapped while waiting for deportation on the Greek islands of [[Lesbos|Lesvos]], [[Chios]], [[Samos]], [[Leros]] and [[Kos]], and the number of residents is double the capacity of the five islands.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/1703/Asylum-seekers-attempt-suicide-daily-as-they-face-desperate-circumstances-in-Greece|title=Asylum seekers attempt suicide daily as they face desperate circumstances in Greece|last=Monitor|first=Euro-Med|newspaper=Euro-Mediterranean|language=en|access-date=29 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2017 dozens of Afghani asylum seekers made a demonstration in a square in Stockholm against their pending deportations.

[[President of Syria|Syrian President]] [[Bashar al-Assad]] responded with force and consequently, more protests were triggered nationwide against the Assad regime. By July 2011, hundreds of thousands of people were protesting against President Assad. An early violent crackdown was implemented to try to mitigate these uprisings\u2014however, these measures were met with more unrest. By [[Arab Spring|May 2011]], thousands of people had already fled the country and the first refugee camps opened in Turkey. In March 2012, the UNHCR decided to appoint a Regional Refugee Coordinator for Syrian Refugees\u2014recognising the growing concerns surrounding the crisis.

The majority have resettled in Pakistan and Iran, but it is becoming increasingly common to migrate further west to the European Union. Afghanistan has faced nearly 40 years of conflict dating back to the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion in 1979]]. Since then, the nation has faced fluctuating levels of [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|civil war]] amidst unending unrest. The increase in refugee numbers has been credited primarily to the [[Taliban]] presence within Afghanistan. Their retreat in 2001, led to nearly 6 million Afghan refugees returning to their homeland. However, after [[Taliban insurgency|civil unrest and fighting alongside the Taliban's return]], nearly 2.5 million refugees have fled Afghanistan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rescue.org/article/afghanistan-what-you-need-know-about-one-worlds-longest-refugee-crises|title=Afghanistan: What you need to know about one of the world's longest refugee crises|date=2016-09-08|work=International Rescue Committee (IRC)|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en}}</ref> Most Afghan refugees, however, seek refuge in the neighboring nation of Pakistan.

The greatest number of applications were from Syria, Afghanistan and Nigeria, giving a clear indication of the current nodes of this crisis. However, the number of Syrians and Afghans continued to be less than that of the same time in 2016, suggesting that perhaps, the peak of this crisis has passed. Initially looking at the noticeably fewer number of both migrants and applications indicates that this crisis may be on the decline. But the increasing number of illegal immigrants from Africa simply suggests that the direction of the crisis is changing. While Germany recorded the highest number of first time applicants (over 49,000), Spain saw a 30 percent increase in the number of asylum seekers, along with Cyprus and Bulgaria.<ref name=\"Asylum quarterly report\" />\n\n=== Illegal border crossings ===\n[[File:Migrants in Hungary 2015 Aug 003.jpg|thumb|Migrants along the Western Balkan route crossing from Serbia into Hungary, 24 August 2015]]\nIn September 2015, Europol estimated there were 30 000 suspected migrant smugglers, which rose to 55 000 in 2016 and a further 10 000 more in 2017.

Named the Common European Asylum System (CEAS), the system sought to address three key problems which consisted of asylum shopping, differing outcomes in different EU Member States for those seeking asylum, and differing social benefits in different EU Member States for those seeking asylum.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.mjilonline.org/the-common-european-asylum-system-its-history-content-and-shortcomings/|title=The Common European Asylum System: Its History, Content, and Shortcomings \u2013 The Michigan Journal of International Law|last=Raithel|first=Silvia|date=2016-02-09|work=The Michigan Journal of International Law|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to address these issues, the European Commission created five components that sought to fulfill minimum standards for asylum:<ref name=\":03\" />\n* The Asylum Procedures Directive\n* The Receptions Conditions Directive\n* The Qualification Directive\n* The Dublin regulation\n* The Eurodac Regulation\nCompleted in 2005, the Common European Asylum System sought to protect the rights those seeking asylum.

Due to this divided asylum system and problems with the Dublin system, the European Commission proposed a reform of the Common European Asylum System in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/explainers/understanding-migration-and-asylum-european-union|title=The EU Has a Solidarity Crisis.

It hosts 16.209 migrants on its island and 33.650 migrants on the mainland, most of whom are women and children. Because of lack of water, medical care and security protection witnessed by the Euro- Med monitor team- especially with the arrival of winter, they are at risk of serious deterioration in health, mostly children and pregnant women. 1,500 refugees were, accordingly, moved into other places since their camps were deluged with snow, but relocation of the refugees always came too late after they lived without electricity and heating devices for too long. It also showed that there is a lack of access to legal services and security protection to the refugees and migrants in the camps; there is no trust between the resident and the protection offices, paving a path for some people to report crimes and illegal acts in the camps. In addition, the migrants are subject to regular xenophobic attacks, fascist violence, forced strip searches at the hands of residents and police and detention. The women living in the Athens settlements and the [[Vasilika refugee camp|Vasilika]], [[Softex]] and [[Diavata]] camps feel worried about their children as they may be subjected to sexual abuse, trafficking and drug use. As a result, some of the refugees and migrants commit suicide, burn property and protest.

[[President of Syria|Syrian President]] [[Bashar al-Assad]] responded with force and consequently, more protests were triggered nationwide against the Assad regime. By July 2011, hundreds of thousands of people were protesting against President Assad. An early violent crackdown was implemented to try to mitigate these uprisings\u2014however, these measures were met with more unrest. By [[Arab Spring|May 2011]], thousands of people had already fled the country and the first refugee camps opened in Turkey. In March 2012, the UNHCR decided to appoint a Regional Refugee Coordinator for Syrian Refugees\u2014recognising the growing concerns surrounding the crisis. Just a year later, in March 2013, the number of Syrian refugees reached 1,000,000. By December 2017, [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] counted 1,000,000 asylum applications for Syrian refugees in the European Union. As of March 2018, UNHCR has counted nearly 5.6 million registered Syrian refugees worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/syria|title=Situation Syria Regional Refugee Response|website=data2.unhcr.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-17}}</ref>\n\n==== Afghanistan ====\n[[Afghan refugees]] comprise the second-largest refugee population in the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/afghanistan.html|title=Afghanistan|publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en}}</ref> According to the UNHCR, there are almost 2.5 million registered refugees from Afghanistan. Most of these refugees have fled the region due to war and persecution. The majority have resettled in Pakistan and Iran, but it is becoming increasingly common to migrate further west to the European Union. Afghanistan has faced nearly 40 years of conflict dating back to the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion in 1979]]. Since then, the nation has faced fluctuating levels of [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|civil war]] amidst unending unrest. The increase in refugee numbers has been credited primarily to the [[Taliban]] presence within Afghanistan. Their retreat in 2001, led to nearly 6 million Afghan refugees returning to their homeland. However, after [[Taliban insurgency|civil unrest and fighting alongside the Taliban's return]], nearly 2.5 million refugees have fled Afghanistan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rescue.org/article/afghanistan-what-you-need-know-about-one-worlds-longest-refugee-crises|title=Afghanistan: What you need to know about one of the world's longest refugee crises|date=2016-09-08|work=International Rescue Committee (IRC)|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en}}</ref> Most Afghan refugees, however, seek refuge in the neighboring nation of Pakistan.

The greatest number of applications were from Syria, Afghanistan and Nigeria, giving a clear indication of the current nodes of this crisis. However, the number of Syrians and Afghans continued to be less than that of the same time in 2016, suggesting that perhaps, the peak of this crisis has passed. Initially looking at the noticeably fewer number of both migrants and applications indicates that this crisis may be on the decline. But the increasing number of illegal immigrants from Africa simply suggests that the direction of the crisis is changing. While Germany recorded the highest number of first time applicants (over 49,000), Spain saw a 30 percent increase in the number of asylum seekers, along with Cyprus and Bulgaria.<ref name=\"Asylum quarterly report\" />\n\n=== Illegal border crossings ===\n[[File:Migrants in Hungary 2015 Aug 003.jpg|thumb|Migrants along the Western Balkan route crossing from Serbia into Hungary, 24 August 2015]]\nIn September 2015, Europol estimated there were 30 000 suspected migrant smugglers, which rose to 55 000 in 2016 and a further 10 000 more in 2017.

It was the discovery of [[tin]] by the British that led to the influx of other ethnic groups such as the [[Hausa\u2013Fulani|Hausa]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], thus making Jos a cosmopolitan city.\n\nAccording to the white paper of the commission of inquiry into the 1994 crisis, Ames, a British colonial administrator, said that the original name for Jos was Gwosh which was a village situated at the current site of the city; according to Ames, the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] wrongly pronounced Gwosh as Jos and it stuck.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petitiononline.com|title=Petition Online - Petition Online has been retired|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> Another version was that \"Jos\" came from the word \"Jasad\" meaning body. To distinguish it from the hill tops, it was called \"Jas\", which was mis-pronounced by the British as \"Jos\". It grew rapidly after the British discovered vast [[tin]] deposits in the vicinity. Both tin and [[columbite]] were extensively mined in the area up until the 1960s. They were transported by railway to both [[Port Harcourt]] and [[Lagos]] on the coast, then exported from those ports. Jos is still often referred to as \"Tin City\". It was made capital of [[Benue-Plateau State]] in 1967, and became the capital of the new Plateau State in 1975.\n[[File:CENTRAL MOSQUE JOS NIGERIA - panoramio.jpg|left|thumb|Jos Central Mosque]]\n[[File:Gunshot victim and mother.jpg|thumb|A hospitalized gunshot victim (left) from the 2001 Jos Riots]]\nJos has become an important national administrative, commercial, and tourist centre. Tin mining has led to the influx of [[Human migration|migrant]]s (mostly Igbos, Yorubas and [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]]) who constitute more than half of the population of Jos. This \"melting pot\" of race, ethnicity and religion makes Jos one of the most cosmopolitan cities in Nigeria. For this reason, [[Plateau State]] is known in Nigeria as the \"home of peace and tourism\". \n\n==Religious violence==\nJos is inhabited by predominantly [[Christianity in Nigeria|Christian]] communities, but clashes have occurred between [[Christians]] and [[Islam in Nigeria|Muslims]]. In September 2001, [[2001 Jos riots|riots]] occurred in Jos between the divided and Christian and [[Muslim]] populations, in which about a thousand people were killed.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/regional-publications/GD-WP-Jos-deadly-cycle.pdf|title = A Deadly Cycle of Ethno-religious violence|last = Krause|first = Jana|date = 2011|journal = Working Paper|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 18 October 2015|pages = 13|isbn = 978-2-9700771-0-7|publisher = Geneva Declaration}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/nigeria/07812.pdf|title = The Jos Crisis: A Recurrent Nigerian Tragedy|last = Higazi|first = Adam|date = January 2011|journal = Working Paper|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 19 October 2015|issue = 2|publisher = Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung|pages = 17\u201318}}</ref> In 2004, the former governor of Plateau State, [[Joshua Dariye]], was suspended for six months for failing to control the violence. \n[[File:Residential Area In Tudun Wada, Jos, Plateau State (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|Residential area in Jos]]\nIn [[2008 Jos riots|November 2008]] and [[2010 Jos riots|January 2010]], further riots occurred in Jos.

The city proper lies between Jos north and Jos south. Jos east houses the prestigious National Center For Remote Sensing. Jos north is the state capital and the area where most commercial activities of the state takes place, although due to the recent communal clashes a lot of commercial activities are shifting to Jos south. The Governor's office is located in an area in Jos North called \"Jise\" in Berom language, \"Gise\" in Afizere (Jarawa) language or \"Tudun-Wada\" in Hausa language. Jos south is the seat of the Deputy Governor i.e. the old Government House in Rayfield and the industrial centre of Plateau State due to the presence of industries like the NASCO group, Standard Biscuits, Grand Cereals and Oil Mills, Zuma steel west Africa, aluminium roofing industries, Jos International Breweries among others. Jos south also houses prestigious institutions like the [[National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies]] (NIPSS), the highest academic awarding institution in Nigeria, the National Veterinary Research Institute, the Police Staff College, the [[Nigerian Television Authority|NTA]] television college and the [[Nigerian Film Corporation]]. Jos north is the location of the University of Jos and its teaching hospital. The city has formed an [[urban agglomeration|agglomeration]] with the town of [[Bukuru]] to form the Jos-Bukuru metropolis (JBM).\n\n==Geography and climate==\n{{climate chart\n|Jos\n|12.7|27.3|0.4\n|15.1|28.7|2.8\n|17.7|30.4|29.8\n|18.3|30.2|92.9\n|18.0|28.2|159.8\n|17.2|26.6|198.5\n|16.7|24.4|303.8\n|16.5|24.3|290.1\n|16.7|26.1|197.6\n|16.6|27.8|38.3\n|14.9|28.0|0.3\n|13.1|27.2|0.5\n|float=right\n|clear=none\n|source=Jos, Nigeria: Climate, Global Warming, and Daylight Charts and Data <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.climate-charts.com/Locations/n/NI65134.php |title=Jos, Nigeria: Climate, Global Warming, and Daylight Charts and Data |location=Jos, Nigeria |publisher=Climate-charts.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10}}</ref>\n}}\n\nSituated almost at the geographical centre of Nigeria and about {{convert|179|km|mi|abbr=off}} from [[Abuja]], the nation's capital, Jos is linked by road, rail and air to the rest of the country.

Jos]''' {{IPAc-en|'|d\u0292|o\u02d0|s}} is a city in the [[Middle Belt]] of [[Nigeria]]. The city has a population of about 900,000 residents based on the 2006 census.<ref name=\"nigerianstat.gov.ng\"/> Popularly called \"'''J-Town'''\", it is the administrative capital and largest city of [[Plateau State]].\n\nThe city is located on the [[Jos Plateau]] at about {{convert|1238|m|ft|0|disp=or}} above sea level. During [[British Empire|British]] [[Colonialism|colonial rule]], Jos was an important centre for [[Tin|tin mining]] and is the trading hub of the state as commercial activities are steadily increasing.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest known settlers of the land that would come to be known as Nigeria were the [[Nok culture|Nok people]] (circa 1000&nbsp;BC), skilled artisans from around the Jos area who mysteriously vanished in the late first millennium.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-62-74.jpg|thumb|left|Early British settlement in Jos, 1905]]\nAccording to the historian Sen Luka Gwom Zangabadt,<ref>History of Jos and political development of Nigeria; Sen Luka Gwom Zangabadt</ref> the area known as Jos today was inhabited by [[indigenous]] [[ethnic groups of Nigeria|ethnic groups]] who were mostly farmers. According to Billy J. Dudley,<ref>Billy J. Dudley. Parties and politics in Northern Nigeria</ref> the British colonialists used direct rule for the indigenous ethnic groups on the Jos Plateau since they were not under the [[Fulani]] [[emirate]]s where indirect rule was used. According to the historian Samuel N Nwabara,<ref>Samuel N Nwabara; The Fulani conquest and the rule of the Hausa kingdom of Northern  Nigeria (1804\u20131900){{Page needed|date=May 2014}}</ref> the [[Fula people|Fulani]] empire controlled most of [[northern Nigeria]], except the Plateau province and the [[Berom people|Berom]], [[Mwaghavul language|Mwaghavul]], [[Ngas language|Ngas]], [[Tiv people|Tiv]], [[Jukun people (West Africa)|Jukun]] and [[Idoma people|Idoma]] ethnic groups. It was the discovery of [[tin]] by the British that led to the influx of other ethnic groups such as the [[Hausa\u2013Fulani|Hausa]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], thus making Jos a cosmopolitan city.\n\nAccording to the white paper of the commission of inquiry into the 1994 crisis, Ames, a British colonial administrator, said that the original name for Jos was Gwosh which was a village situated at the current site of the city; according to Ames, the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] wrongly pronounced Gwosh as Jos and it stuck.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petitiononline.com|title=Petition Online - Petition Online has been retired|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> Another version was that \"Jos\" came from the word \"Jasad\" meaning body. To distinguish it from the hill tops, it was called \"Jas\", which was mis-pronounced by the British as \"Jos\". It grew rapidly after the British discovered vast [[tin]] deposits in the vicinity. Both tin and [[columbite]] were extensively mined in the area up until the 1960s. They were transported by railway to both [[Port Harcourt]] and [[Lagos]] on the coast, then exported from those ports. Jos is still often referred to as \"Tin City\". It was made capital of [[Benue-Plateau State]] in 1967, and became the capital of the new Plateau State in 1975.\n[[File:CENTRAL MOSQUE JOS NIGERIA - panoramio.jpg|left|thumb|Jos Central Mosque]]\n[[File:Gunshot victim and mother.jpg|thumb|A hospitalized gunshot victim (left) from the 2001 Jos Riots]]\nJos has become an important national administrative, commercial, and tourist centre. Tin mining has led to the influx of [[migrant]]s (mostly Igbos, Yorubas and [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]]) who constitute more than half of the population of Jos. This \"melting pot\" of race, ethnicity and religion makes Jos one of the most cosmopolitan cities in Nigeria. For this reason, [[Plateau State]] is known in Nigeria as the \"home of peace and tourism\". \n\n==Religious violence==\nJos is inhabited by predominantly [[Christianity in Nigeria|Christian]] communities, but clashes have occurred between [[Christians]] and [[Islam in Nigeria|Muslims]]. In September 2001, [[2001 Jos riots|riots]] occurred in Jos between the divided and Christian and [[Muslim]] populations, in which about a thousand people were killed.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/regional-publications/GD-WP-Jos-deadly-cycle.pdf|title = A Deadly Cycle of Ethno-religious violence|last = Krause|first = Jana|date = 2011|journal = Working Paper|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 18 October 2015|pages = 13|isbn = 978-2-9700771-0-7|publisher = Geneva Declaration}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/nigeria/07812.pdf|title = The Jos Crisis: A Recurrent Nigerian Tragedy|last = Higazi|first = Adam|date = January 2011|journal = Working Paper|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 19 October 2015|issue = 2|publisher = Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung|pages = 17\u201318}}</ref> In 2004, the former governor of Plateau State, [[Joshua Dariye]], was suspended for six months for failing to control the violence. \n[[File:Residential Area In Tudun Wada, Jos, Plateau State (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|Residential area in Jos]]\nIn [[2008 Jos riots|November 2008]] and [[2010 Jos riots|January 2010]], further riots occurred in Jos.

The city proper lies between Jos north and Jos south. Jos east houses the prestigious National Center For Remote Sensing. Jos north is the state capital and the area where most commercial activities of the state takes place, although due to the recent communal clashes a lot of commercial activities are shifting to Jos south. The Governor's office is located in an area in Jos North called \"Jise\" in Berom language, \"Gise\" in Afizere (Jarawa) language or \"Tudun-Wada\" in Hausa language. Jos south is the seat of the Deputy Governor i.e. the old Government House in Rayfield and the industrial centre of Plateau State due to the presence of industries like the NASCO group, Standard Biscuits, Grand Cereals and Oil Mills, Zuma steel west Africa, aluminium roofing industries, Jos International Breweries among others. Jos south also houses prestigious institutions like the [[National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies]] (NIPSS), the highest academic awarding institution in Nigeria, the National Veterinary Research Institute, the Police Staff College, the [[Nigerian Television Authority|NTA]] television college and the [[Nigerian Film Corporation]]. Jos north is the location of the University of Jos and its teaching hospital.

In the last three decades, Gilbert has grown at an extremely high rate, increasing in population from 5,717 in 1980 to 208,453 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The town grew at an average annual growth rate of nearly 13% during this 30-year period. In 2018, the town's population was estimated to be at 248,279.\n\n==History==\nGilbert owes its beginnings to William \"Bobby\" Gilbert, who provided land to the Arizona Eastern Railway in 1902 to construct a rail line between Phoenix and Florence, Arizona. Ayer's Grocery Store, the first store in Gilbert, opened in 1910 and became the location of the first post office in 1912. The location of the town post office moved several times before settling on the east side of Gilbert Road in downtown, where it still stands today.  In 1912, many Mormons who had fled the [[Mormon colonies in Mexico]] due to the actions of the forces of [[Pancho Villa]] settled in Gilbert. By 1915, they began holding church meetings at the Gilbert Elementary School. In 1918, they were organized into the Gilbert Ward.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thechurchnews.com/archive/2010-11-19/gilbert-arizona-communitys-roots-date-to-1920-36358 |title=Gilbert Arizona Community's roots date to 1920|newspaper=[[Church News]] |date=November 19, 2010 |accessdate=September 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIncorporated in July 1920, Gilbert was primarily a farming community fueled by the rail line and construction of the Roosevelt Dam and the Eastern and Consolidated Canals.

town in [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]], Arizona, United States, located southeast of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], within the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]]. Once known as the \"Hay Shipping Capital of the World\",<ref>[http://www.usacitiesonline.com/azcountygilbert.htm Gilbert Profile]</ref> It is the sixth-largest municipality in Arizona, and the fifth-largest in the Metropolitan Phoenix Area.\n\nGilbert encompasses {{convert|76|sqmi|km2|0}} and has made a rapid transformation from an agriculture-based community to an economically diverse suburban center located in the southeast valley of the Greater Phoenix area. In the last three decades, Gilbert has grown at an extremely high rate, increasing in population from 5,717 in 1980 to 208,453 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The town grew at an average annual growth rate of nearly 13% during this 30-year period. In 2018, the town's population was estimated to be at 248,279.\n\n==History==\nGilbert owes its beginnings to William \"Bobby\" Gilbert, who provided land to the Arizona Eastern Railway in 1902 to construct a rail line between Phoenix and Florence, Arizona. Ayer's Grocery Store, the first store in Gilbert, opened in 1910 and became the location of the first post office in 1912. The location of the town post office moved several times before settling on the east side of Gilbert Road in downtown, where it still stands today.  In 1912, many Mormons who had fled the [[Mormon colonies in Mexico]] due to the actions of the forces of [[Pancho Villa]] settled in Gilbert. By 1915, they began holding church meetings at the Gilbert Elementary School. In 1918, they were organized into the Gilbert Ward.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thechurchnews.com/archive/2010-11-19/gilbert-arizona-communitys-roots-date-to-1920-36358 |title=Gilbert Arizona Community's roots date to 1920|newspaper=[[Church News]] |date=November 19, 2010 |accessdate=September 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIncorporated in July 1920, Gilbert was primarily a farming community fueled by the rail line and construction of the Roosevelt Dam and the Eastern and Consolidated Canals.

Booth and Brennan are married and own a nightclub called \"The Lab\", but when a body is found at the club, Detectives Cam Saroyan and Jared Booth are called to investigate. However, not everything is as it seems. For example, Caroline Julian, normally a federal prosecutor, is a defense lawyer, and Sweets is the frontman of the band [[Gormogon (Bones)|Gormogon]], who was a cannibalistic serial killer. It is subsequently revealed that Booth has been in a coma for several days due to his tumor operation and that the life he saw was possibly only a dream or a hallucination. It is also revealed that Brennan had been writing at his side, possibly narrating her story out loud as she wrote it, causing Booth to hallucinate what he did. She ends up deleting her work.

It stars Shashi Kapoor, his son [[Kunal Kapoor (Kapoor family)|Kunal Kapoor]], [[Rekha]], [[Amrish Puri]] and [[Supriya Pathak]] with K.K. Raina, Raja Bundela and [[Shafi Inamdar]], who went on to become notable supporting actors in Bollywood movies.\n\n==Plot==\nAngad (Kunal Kapoor) is a confused teenager trying to find himself and is caught in between the marital problems of his Maharashtrian mother Neelima (Rekha) and Punjabi father Nihal (Shashi Kapoor), it is time for him to decide what he wants to do with his life. Angad chooses to become a fighter pilot with the [[Indian Air Force]]. What follows is his struggle to become a victor both with his self and the outer world. Angad is attracted to Anna Verghese (Supriya Pathak), who is the daughter of his flying instructor Group Captain Varghese (Amrish Puri) a [[Malayali]] [[Saint_Thomas_Christians|Syrian Christian]]. Angad must learn to adapt to flying, leaving his mom and dad for long periods of time, as well as try and woo Anna who helps him overcome his fears and realize his potential as a fighter pilot. Nihal is a clean-shaven Sikh, Neelima is a Hindu, Angad is a [[Sikh]] and Anna a [[Christians|Christian]], while Angad's fellow officers represent all religions.\n\nThe film is notable for some rarely seen aerial photography of combat aircraft active with the IAF in the 1980s. The central character of Angad is a [[MiG-21]] pilot and is shown flying the aircraft in the ground attack role in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. Much of the movie, including the climax involving a [[MiG-21]]bis, was shot at Pune. The [[Indian Air Force|IAF]] No.4 Squadron (the '[[Oorials]]') provided the pilots and planes for the film's aerial sequences. The movie included good color footage of the Oorials aircraft in flight and in operation.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Shashi Kapoor]] as Nihal Singh\n*[[Rekha]] as Neelima Singh\n*[[Supriya Pathak]] as Anna Varghese\n*[[Kunal Kapoor (Kapoor family)|Kunal Kapoor]] as Angad\n*[[Amrish Puri]] as [[Group Captain (rank)|Group Captain]] Varghese, the Chief Instructor\n*[[Om Puri]] as Arvind\n*[[Dina Pathak]] as Angad's grandmother (Biji)\n*[[Shafi Inamdar]] as [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Parulkar\n*[[Sulabha Deshpande]]\n*[[Capt Anup Ghosh]] as [[Squadron Leader (rank)|Squadron Leader]]\n\n==Music==\n#\"Bichhurat Mose Kanha\" - [[Parveen Sultana]]\n#\"Man Aanand Aanand Chhaayo\" - [[Asha Bhosle]], Satyasheel Deshpande\n#\"Man Base Mor Brindaban Ma\" - [[Manna Dey]]\n\n==Facts==\n\n* The \"senior pilots of the Indian Air Force\" who are credited with providing assistance with the aerial photography were drawn from No. 4 Squadron, IAF (\"The Fighting Oorials\").

Expenses at this time for a full year were $206.50 (equal to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|206.50|1870|r=-1}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) and remained relatively unchanged for the next 50 years.\n\n===Early history (1866\u20131897)===\nThe College was founded by and initially associated with the [[Church of the United Brethren in Christ]]. Today, Lebanon Valley College is affiliated with the [[United Methodist Church]], which occurred through a series of church mergers: The Church of the United Brethren in Christ merged with the [[Evangelical Association]] in 1946 creating the [[Evangelical United Brethren|Evangelical United Brethren Church]] (EUB), which subsequently merged with the [[Methodist Church]] in 1968 to create the [[United Methodist Church]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/ev/EvangUBC.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818141615/http://www.bartleby.com/65/ev/EvangUBC.html|archivedate=2000-08-18|title=EVANGELICAL UNITED BRETHREN CHURCH. The Columbia Encyclopedia: Sixth Edition. 2000|date=18 August 2000|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref> The ties to the Methodist Church are not as strong as they once were, which is evidenced by the lack of mandatory chapel services, but the church maintains a presence on the campus. Out of 34 colleges and academies founded by the United Brethren in Christ Church, Lebanon Valley was one of four to survive.\n\nThe campus began as a single building, the empty Annville Academy building, which was purchased for $4,500 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4500|1866|r=-4}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) by five Annville citizens. They presented the building as a gift to the East Pennsylvania Conference of the United Brethren Church to settle the argument over where to establish the college. In a little more than two months from its founding, 12 trustees were appointed, President Thomas R. Vickroy was elected, the building repaired and redecorated, a curriculum devised, faculty recruited, and classes begun. The College was entirely contained in that one building (class rooms, student residence, president's residence, and \"dining hall\") until 1868 when \"North College\" was opened at a cost of $31,500, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|31500|1868|r=-4}}}}  in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}. The Annville Academy building became known as \"South Hall\" or \"Ladies Hall\" as the North College building was now the home to the men's dormitories.\n\nA note worth mentioning: The college charter, granted in 1867, specifically stated that Lebanon Valley College was established for the education of ''both'' sexes. Indeed, Lebanon Valley College can claim that it has been coeducational longer than any other college east of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. However, the curricula were different for men and women, a condition created from a compromise after an uproar in the founding church over the equal treatment of men and women. The \"Ladies Course\" included modern languages, painting, drawing, wax flower and fruit making, and music. By 1878, the college catalog began announcing that experience showed that there was no difference between men and women in their ability to master college courses, an unpopular idea at its time.\n\nThis was also the time of the founding literary societies: Philokosmian, Clionian, and Kalozetean, which bear no resemblance to their present fraternity and sorority selves. They met regularly to debate topics and discuss essays. Other activities included mixed socials, parades, the annual Chestnut Picnic, and other special events throughout the years.\n\n===Growth (1897\u20131948)===\nThe College steadily grew during its first 35 years, and by 1904, the campus had expanded to include Engle Hall, home of the music department, and a partially completed library funded by [[Andrew Carnegie]]. On Christmas Eve 1904, North College (not to be confused with the residence hall with the same name), which stood in the current footprint of the Administration/Humanities building, burned down. The next year, the college raised funds to rebuild and also began expanding the campus further, building not only a new Administration Building (the current Humanities Building), but also North Hall (a women's dorm, currently the site of Miller Chapel), Kreider Hall (a men's residence hall where the current Neidig-Garber Science Center is located), the central heating plant (still in existence), a science building, and a gymnasium. However, funding ran out, debt rose, and building halted on the gym and science buildings. President Hervin U. Roop resigned in disgrace on New Year's Day, 1906. It was not until President Lawrence W. Keister took office on June 12, 1907 that the debt situation was solved. Thanks to his fundraising efforts, the debt was eliminated by 1911. The College landscape remained relatively unchanged for the next four decades, under the leadership of President George D. Gossard (1912\u20131932) and [[Clyde A. Lynch]] (1932\u20131950).<ref>''Pennsylvania School Journal'', Volume 81 (Pennsylvania State Education Association, 1932), p. 285</ref> <ref>\u201dDr Clyde A. Lynch\u201d (obituary) in ''The Torch'', Volumes 23-24 (International Association of Torch Clubs, 1950), p. 41</ref>\n\nCultural changes at LVC paralleled those in the rest of the country, moving through [[World War I]], the [[Roaring Twenties]], the [[Great Depression]], and the [[New Deal]].\n\n===Mid-century and modern day (1948\u2013present)===\n[[World War II]] nearly proved to be the end of Lebanon Valley College. In the Fall of 1942, LVC's first wartime registration showed only 357 students enrolled. As the second semester began in 1943, there were only 282 students: 145 women and 137 men, the first time that women outnumbered men. 1943 Fall enrollment dropped again to only 199 students, 62 of which were on limited deferment, waiting to be called to active duty. This prompted one of the first capital campaigns to help the ailing College. The campaign to raise $550,000 received 91% support from current students. The money was to go toward an endowment and a real gymnasium, which bore the name of the president who initiated the campaign\u2014Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall. Right before the war ended, LVC enrollment hit bottom at 192 students. In 1946, however, enrollment ballooned to 683 students, more than 300 of which were ex-servicemen.\n\nEnrollment steadily grew and by 1948, thanks to the [[G.I. Bill]], it had reached 817 full-time students, far beyond the college's capacity. Eventually additional facilities and residences were added to the college. Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall\u2014which included the school's first proper gymnasium\u2014was opened in 1953. In 1957, Science Hall (now the Derickson A apartments) was created out of the old Kreider Factory building on White Oak St., and Gossard Library also opened that year. In 1966, Frederic K. Miller Chapel was completed. The 1950s also saw the college expand north of Sheridan Avenue, with the Dining Hall (now Lehr and Phillips Dining Hall) built in 1958. Other current traditional residence halls were built between the 1950s and 1970s as well\u2014Mary Green (1956) and Vickroy (1960) in the 1950s-60s, Hammond and Keister Hall in 1965, and Funkhouser and Silver in the 1970s. Marquette and Dellinger were added in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and Stanson was added in 2009.\n\nEnrollment also grew, although it had stagnated by the 1980s. A turnaround began under the presidency of Arthur L. Peterson, whose tenure in office was cut short due to health issues. Soon thereafter, a highly energetic president, John Synodinos, ushered in a period of growth and change with the bold introduction of merit scholarships and the renovation and beautification of a substantial portion of the campus that included the addition of the Edward H. Arnold Sports Center and the Suzanne H. Arnold Art Gallery and Zimmerman Recital hall. With the assistance of Dr. William J. McGill, senior vice president and the dean of the faculty, academic excellence continued to be emphasized, linkages were established with other institutions and schools, an international initiative undertaken, and collaborative learning experiences developed. A new technologically advanced library, the Vernon and Doris Bishop Library, opened in January 1996.\n\nBeginning in 1996 and building on the work of his predecessor, Dr. G. David Pollick\u2019s eight-year presidency ushered in a period of continued growth. There was a 40 percent increase in undergraduate enrollment with applications more than doubling. New undergraduate and graduate degree programs were added and there was a large increase in the number of first-year students who studied abroad.  A major public relations focus to enhance the college's standing among peer institutions was followed by a major rebuilding and renovation effort on campus and the start of a $50 million campaign, Great Expectations. Pollick oversaw a growth plan that added athletic teams, more than a dozen new campus buildings and athletic facilities, and the college's signature Fasick Bridge. These additions almost tripled the usable space of the college, including five new facilities: the Marquette and Dellinger Residence Halls, the Allan W. Mund College Center, Sorrentino Gymnasium, and the Heilman Center. A revitalization of Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall and the Neidig-Garber Science Center also were begun during this period.\n[[File:LVC Peace Garden.jpg|thumb|250x250px|An aerial view of LVC's Peace Garden, taken by Blue Fuego. The Peace Garden is in the middle of the college's Residential Quad and is a popular place to study, relax, or take milestone photographs, especially weddings.]]\nToday, the campus consists of 40 buildings, including the recently renovated Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall, the Vernon and Doris Bishop Library (revitalized in 2016), the Heilman Center for communication sciences & disorders/speech-language pathology, and $20 million Jeanne and Edward H. Arnold Health Professions Pavilion (opened August 2018) for athletic training, exercise science, and physical therapy. Students received career advice from experts in the Edward and Lynn Breen Center for Graduate Success (launched programming in 2018) and study under the college's new general education curriculum, Constellation LVC (started in fall 2016). Students reside in one of 25 residence halls that include traditional single-sex and co-educational dormitories and apartment-style residences. Students may also reside in special interest houses upon proposal and approval of LVC administration. A small number of upperclassmen are allowed to live off-campus, and a significant portion of the student body are commuter students as well. Undergraduate enrollment is now over 1,638 students.\n\nThe endowment of the college is sixty-five million dollars.\n\n===Lost lore and traditions===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}{{Original research section|date=April 2017}}\nMany college traditions have disappeared and been forgotten, much to the chagrin of most alumni. At most colleges and universities, there seems to be a compulsion to make fools of the freshman students. Lebanon Valley College was no different in this regard, as most of the traditions existed for this very reason.\n\n====May Day====\nA festive tradition, this pageant was begun in 1912. Each year, a May Queen would be elected and would watch over the festival with her court. Typical [[May Day]] activities took place, including the expected [[May pole]]. This tradition seems to have persisted for 55 years until the late 1960s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/OfHighGradeASesquicentennialHistoryOfLebanonValleyCollege|title=Of High Grade: A Sesquicentennial History of Lebanon Valley College|last=Williams|first=Rev.

One evening after a football game, President Gossard had decided to change the policy and allowed the students to dance with his blessing. From then on, the literary societies began holding annual dinner dances. Formal proms were organized and any opportunity for dancing was not overlooked.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/OfHighGradeASesquicentennialHistoryOfLebanonValleyCollege|title=Of High Grade: A Sesquicentennial History of Lebanon Valley College|last=Williams|first=Rev.

The UG is a place where students can go to have fun with their classmates and friends on most Saturday nights.  The UG plays popular hits from today's music and is open to non-LVC students at a small price.\n\n'''March to the President's House'''\n\nIn a tradition that dates to the presidency of [[Clyde A. Lynch]] '18 [1932\u20131950] students march to the president's home, Kreiderheim since 1976, to request the day off before Thanksgiving when the football team defeats Albright College. LVC defeated Albright in double overtime in 2018 and President Thayne granted the students' wish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godutchmen.com/news/2018/11/12/football-day-off-you-got-it-students-march-on-kreiderheim.aspx?path=football|title=Day Off?

Expenses at this time for a full year were $206.50 (equal to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|206.50|1870|r=-1}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) and remained relatively unchanged for the next 50 years.\n\n===Early history (1866\u20131897)===\nThe College was founded by and initially associated with the [[Church of the United Brethren in Christ]]. Today, Lebanon Valley College is affiliated with the [[United Methodist Church]], which occurred through a series of church mergers: The Church of the United Brethren in Christ merged with the [[Evangelical Association]] in 1946 creating the [[Evangelical United Brethren|Evangelical United Brethren Church]] (EUB), which subsequently merged with the [[Methodist Church]] in 1968 to create the [[United Methodist Church]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/ev/EvangUBC.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818141615/http://www.bartleby.com/65/ev/EvangUBC.html|archivedate=2000-08-18|title=EVANGELICAL UNITED BRETHREN CHURCH. The Columbia Encyclopedia: Sixth Edition. 2000|date=18 August 2000|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref> The ties to the Methodist Church are not as strong as they once were, which is evidenced by the lack of mandatory chapel services, but the church maintains a presence on the campus. Out of 34 colleges and academies founded by the United Brethren in Christ Church, Lebanon Valley was one of four to survive.\n\nThe campus began as a single building, the empty Annville Academy building, which was purchased for $4,500 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4500|1866|r=-4}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) by five Annville citizens. They presented the building as a gift to the East Pennsylvania Conference of the United Brethren Church to settle the argument over where to establish the college. In a little more than two months from its founding, 12 trustees were appointed, President Thomas R. Vickroy was elected, the building repaired and redecorated, a curriculum devised, faculty recruited, and classes begun. The College was entirely contained in that one building (class rooms, student residence, president's residence, and \"dining hall\") until 1868 when \"North College\" was opened at a cost of $31,500, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|31500|1868|r=-4}}}}  in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}. The Annville Academy building became known as \"South Hall\" or \"Ladies Hall\" as the North College building was now the home to the men's dormitories.\n\nA note worth mentioning: The college charter, granted in 1867, specifically stated that Lebanon Valley College was established for the education of ''both'' sexes. Indeed, Lebanon Valley College can claim that it has been coeducational longer than any other college east of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. However, the curricula were different for men and women, a condition created from a compromise after an uproar in the founding church over the equal treatment of men and women. The \"Ladies Course\" included modern languages, painting, drawing, wax flower and fruit making, and music. By 1878, the college catalog began announcing that experience showed that there was no difference between men and women in their ability to master college courses, an unpopular idea at its time.\n\nThis was also the time of the founding literary societies: Philokosmian, Clionian, and Kalozetean, which bear no resemblance to their present fraternity and sorority selves. They met regularly to debate topics and discuss essays. Other activities included mixed socials, parades, the annual Chestnut Picnic, and other special events throughout the years.\n\n===Growth (1897\u20131948)===\nThe College steadily grew during its first 35 years, and by 1904, the campus had expanded to include Engle Hall, home of the music department, and a partially completed library funded by [[Andrew Carnegie]]. On Christmas Eve 1904, North College (not to be confused with the residence hall with the same name), which stood in the current footprint of the Administration/Humanities building, burned down. The next year, the college raised funds to rebuild and also began expanding the campus further, building not only a new Administration Building (the current Humanities Building), but also North Hall (a women's dorm, currently the site of Miller Chapel), Kreider Hall (a men's residence hall where the current Neidig-Garber Science Center is located), the central heating plant (still in existence), a science building, and a gymnasium. However, funding ran out, debt rose, and building halted on the gym and science buildings. President Hervin U. Roop resigned in disgrace on New Year's Day, 1906. It was not until President Lawrence W. Keister took office on June 12, 1907 that the debt situation was solved. Thanks to his fundraising efforts, the debt was eliminated by 1911. The College landscape remained relatively unchanged for the next four decades, under the leadership of President George D. Gossard (1912\u20131932) and [[Clyde A. Lynch]] (1932\u20131950).<ref>''Pennsylvania School Journal'', Volume 81 (Pennsylvania State Education Association, 1932), p. 285</ref> <ref>\u201dDr Clyde A. Lynch\u201d (obituary) in ''The Torch'', Volumes 23-24 (International Association of Torch Clubs, 1950), p. 41</ref>\n\nCultural changes at LVC paralleled those in the rest of the country, moving through [[World War I]], the [[Roaring Twenties]], the [[Great Depression]], and the [[New Deal]].\n\n===Mid-century and modern day (1948\u2013present)===\n[[World War II]] nearly proved to be the end of Lebanon Valley College. In the Fall of 1942, LVC's first wartime registration showed only 357 students enrolled. As the second semester began in 1943, there were only 282 students: 145 women and 137 men, the first time that women outnumbered men. 1943 Fall enrollment dropped again to only 199 students, 62 of which were on limited deferment, waiting to be called to active duty. This prompted one of the first capital campaigns to help the ailing College. The campaign to raise $550,000 received 91% support from current students. The money was to go toward an endowment and a real gymnasium, which bore the name of the president who initiated the campaign\u2014Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall. Right before the war ended, LVC enrollment hit bottom at 192 students. In 1946, however, enrollment ballooned to 683 students, more than 300 of which were ex-servicemen.\n\nEnrollment steadily grew and by 1948, thanks to the [[G.I. Bill]], it had reached 817 full-time students, far beyond the college's capacity. Eventually additional facilities and residences were added to the college. Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall\u2014which included the school's first proper gymnasium\u2014was opened in 1953. In 1957, Science Hall (now the Derickson A apartments) was created out of the old Kreider Factory building on White Oak St., and Gossard Library also opened that year. In 1966, Frederic K. Miller Chapel was completed. The 1950s also saw the college expand north of Sheridan Avenue, with the Dining Hall (now Lehr and Phillips Dining Hall) built in 1958. Other current traditional residence halls were built between the 1950s and 1970s as well\u2014Mary Green (1956) and Vickroy (1960) in the 1950s-60s, Hammond and Keister Hall in 1965, and Funkhouser and Silver in the 1970s. Marquette and Dellinger were added in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and Stanson was added in 2009.\n\nEnrollment also grew, although it had stagnated by the 1980s. A turnaround began under the presidency of Arthur L. Peterson, whose tenure in office was cut short due to health issues. Soon thereafter, a highly energetic president, John Synodinos, ushered in a period of growth and change with the bold introduction of merit scholarships and the renovation and beautification of a substantial portion of the campus that included the addition of the Edward H. Arnold Sports Center and the Suzanne H. Arnold Art Gallery and Zimmerman Recital hall. With the assistance of Dr. William J. McGill, senior vice president and the dean of the faculty, academic excellence continued to be emphasized, linkages were established with other institutions and schools, an international initiative undertaken, and collaborative learning experiences developed. A new technologically advanced library, the Vernon and Doris Bishop Library, opened in January 1996.\n\nBeginning in 1996 and building on the work of his predecessor, Dr. G. David Pollick\u2019s eight-year presidency ushered in a period of continued growth. There was a 40 percent increase in undergraduate enrollment with applications more than doubling. New undergraduate and graduate degree programs were added and there was a large increase in the number of first-year students who studied abroad.  A major public relations focus to enhance the college's standing among peer institutions was followed by a major rebuilding and renovation effort on campus and the start of a $50 million campaign, Great Expectations. Pollick oversaw a growth plan that added athletic teams, more than a dozen new campus buildings and athletic facilities, and the college's signature Fasick Bridge. These additions almost tripled the usable space of the college, including five new facilities: the Marquette and Dellinger Residence Halls, the Allan W. Mund College Center, Sorrentino Gymnasium, and the Heilman Center. A revitalization of Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall and the Neidig-Garber Science Center also were begun during this period.\n[[File:LVC Peace Garden.jpg|thumb|250x250px|An aerial view of LVC's Peace Garden, taken by Blue Fuego. The Peace Garden is in the middle of the college's Residential Quad and is a popular place to study, relax, or take milestone photographs, especially weddings.]]\nToday, the campus consists of 40 buildings, including the recently renovated Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall, the Vernon and Doris Bishop Library (revitalized in 2016), the Heilman Center for communication sciences & disorders/speech-language pathology, and $20 million Jeanne and Edward H. Arnold Health Professions Pavilion (opened August 2018) for athletic training, exercise science, and physical therapy. Students received career advice from experts in the Edward and Lynn Breen Center for Graduate Success (launched programming in 2018) and study under the college's new general education curriculum, Constellation LVC (started in fall 2016). Students reside in one of 25 residence halls that include traditional single-sex and co-educational dormitories and apartment-style residences. Students may also reside in special interest houses upon proposal and approval of LVC administration. A small number of upperclassmen are allowed to live off-campus, and a significant portion of the student body are commuter students as well. Undergraduate enrollment is now over 1,638 students.\n\nThe endowment of the college is sixty-five million dollars.\n\n===Lost lore and traditions===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}{{Original research section|date=April 2017}}\nMany college traditions have disappeared and been forgotten, much to the chagrin of most alumni. At most colleges and universities, there seems to be a compulsion to make fools of the freshman students. Lebanon Valley College was no different in this regard, as most of the traditions existed for this very reason.\n\n====May Day====\nA festive tradition, this pageant was begun in 1912. Each year, a May Queen would be elected and would watch over the festival with her court. Typical [[May Day]] activities took place, including the expected [[May pole]]. This tradition seems to have persisted for 55 years until the late 1960s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/OfHighGradeASesquicentennialHistoryOfLebanonValleyCollege|title=Of High Grade: A Sesquicentennial History of Lebanon Valley College|last=Williams|first=Rev.

One evening after a football game, President Gossard had decided to change the policy and allowed the students to dance with his blessing. From then on, the literary societies began holding annual dinner dances. Formal proms were organized and any opportunity for dancing was not overlooked.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/OfHighGradeASesquicentennialHistoryOfLebanonValleyCollege|title=Of High Grade: A Sesquicentennial History of Lebanon Valley College|last=Williams|first=Rev.

The UG is a place where students can go to have fun with their classmates and friends on most Saturday nights.  The UG plays popular hits from today's music and is open to non-LVC students at a small price.\n\n'''March to the President's House'''\n\nIn a tradition that dates to the presidency of [[Clyde A. Lynch]] '18 [1932\u20131950] students march to the president's home, Kreiderheim since 1976, to request the day off before Thanksgiving when the football team defeats Albright College. LVC defeated Albright in double overtime in 2018 and President Thayne granted the students' wish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godutchmen.com/news/2018/11/12/football-day-off-you-got-it-students-march-on-kreiderheim.aspx?path=football|title=Day Off?

It was founded on 19 April 1973 in the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Bad M\u00fcnstereifel]], by militants from the Portuguese Socialist Action ({{lang-pt|Ac\u00e7\u00e3o Socialista Portuguesa}}). The PS is one of the two [[Major party|major parties]] in Portuguese politics, its rival being the centre-right [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD). The current leader of the PS is [[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], the [[Prime Minister of Portugal]]. The party has currently 108 of 230 seats in the Portuguese Parliament following the [[2019 Portuguese legislative election|October 2019 election]], forming a minority government.\n\nPS is a member of the [[Socialist International]], [[Progressive Alliance]] and [[Party of European Socialists]], and has nine members in the [[European Parliament]] within the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|Socialists & Democrats]] (S&D) Group during the [[9th European Parliament|ninth parliament]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ant\u00f3nio Costa img 6536.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]] since November 2015 and Secretary-General since 2014.]]\n{{Social democracy sidebar}}\nThe Socialist Party (PS) was created at a conference of Portuguese Socialist Action (ASP), at that time in exile, on 19 April 1973, in [[Bad M\u00fcnstereifel]] in [[West Germany]]. The twenty-seven delegates decided to found a party of [[socialism]] and [[Political freedom|freedom]], making an explicit reference to a [[classless society]] and without [[Marxism]], redesigned as a source of principal inspiration.\n\nOn 25 April 1974, the [[Carnation Revolution]] brought down the authoritarian regime of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]], established in 1933, and democracy was restored. The general secretary of the PS, M\u00e1rio Soares, returned to Portugal after being in exile in France, and became [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Portugal)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Almeida Santos]] was appointed Minister of Interjurisdictional Coordination in one of the first provisional governments.\n\nAfter the Revolution, elections were called for 25 April 1975 and the Socialist Party (PS) won the [[1975 Portuguese Constituent Assembly election|1975 election for the Constituent Assembly]] and the [[1976 Portuguese legislative election|1976 elections for the National Assembly]], then losing to the [[Democratic Alliance (Portugal)|Democratic Alliance]] (AD) in the [[1979 Portuguese legislative election|1979 legislative election]].\n\nIn 1980, the PS made an electoral alliance called the [[Republican and Socialist Front]] (FRS), between the Independent Social Democrats (ASDI), led by Sousa Franco, and the [[Leftwing Union for the Socialist Democracy]] (UEDS), led by Lopes Cardoso. The alliance failed to defeat the AD.\n\nThey won the 1983 general election, but without an [[absolute majority]], the Socialists formed a [[grand coalition]] with the centre-right [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), creating a \"[[Central Block]]\". The new government began negotiations for Portugal to enter the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC). In 1985 the Central Block broke down and the PS at the time led by [[Almeida Santos]], lost the [[1985 Portuguese legislative election|1985 legislative election]]. Cavaco Silva's PSD won the 1985 elections and again in 1987 and 1991 with absolute majority. The PS was in opposition for more than ten years.\n\nIn 1995, the Socialist Party, then led by [[Ant\u00f3nio Guterres]], won a general election for the first time in twelve years, and in 1999, they failed to obtain what would have been an historic [[absolute majority]] for the party by only one MP. In 2001, after a massive defeat in the 2001 local elections, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres resigned as Prime Minister and called for new elections in 2002. The Socialist Party lost the [[2002 Portuguese legislative election|2002 general election]] by a small margin to the PSD, who formed a coalition government with the [[CDS \u2013 People's Party|People's Party]] (CDS\u2013PP).\n\nIn June 2004, the PS won the [[2004 European Parliament election in Portugal|2004 European elections]] by a landslide, and a few weeks later, [[Dur\u00e3o Barroso]], leader of the PSD and Prime Minister, resigned to become President of the European Commission. In December 2004, [[Jorge Sampaio]], President of the Republic, called fresh [[2005 Portuguese legislative election|elections for February 2005]]. These elections resulted in a landslide victory for the PS, winning for the first time since its foundation an absolute majority. [[Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates]], leader of the PS, became Prime Minister.\n\nIn 2009, after four-and-a-half years in power, the PS lost the [[2009 European Parliament election in Portugal|European Parliament elections]] to the PSD. However, they won the [[2009 Portuguese legislative election|general election]] held on 27 September but failed to renew the absolute majority they won in the [[2005 Portuguese legislative election|2005 election]]. The PS later introduced and legislated [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|same-sex marriage]].\n\nThe [[Eurozone crisis|financial crisis of 2011]] hit Portugal very hard, prompting S\u00f3crates' government to impose harsh [[austerity|austerity measures]]. On 23 March 2011, the entire opposition in Parliament said no to new measures proposed by the government. As a result of this, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates resigned as Prime Minister and a [[2011 Portuguese legislative election|snap election took place on 5 June 2011]].\n\nIn the elections, the PS suffered a huge setback, with 28.1% of the vote, ten points behind the PSD, who formed another coalition government with the CDS-PP. S\u00f3crates resigned as General Secretary on election night after the PS's worst result since 1987. On 23 July 2011, [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro]] was elected as S\u00f3crates' successor.\n\nThe PS, under the leadership of Seguro, won the [[2013 Portuguese local elections|2013 local elections]] making significant gains over the PSD and the Socialists again won the [[2014 European Parliament election in Portugal|European elections on May 2014]] but this time only just. They won 31.5% of the vote against the almost 28% of the alliance between the PSD and CDS-PP. The result was considered quite a disappointment to many Socialist party members and supporters and on May 27 [[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], the then mayor of Lisbon, announced that he would stand for the leadership of the Socialist Party.<ref name=\"leadership\">{{cite news |title=Ant\u00f3nio Costa avan\u00e7a para a lideran\u00e7a do PS |first1=S\u00e1 Louren\u00e7o |last1=Nuno |newspaper=[[P\u00fablico (Portugal)|P\u00fablico]] |date=27 May 2014 |url=http://www.publico.pt/politica/noticia/antonio-costa-avanca-para-a-lideranca-do-ps-1637636 |accessdate=4 September 2014}}</ref> Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro refused to call a new congress and leadership election and instead called for a [[Portuguese Socialist Party prime ministerial primary, 2014|primary election]], to be held on 28 September, to elect the party's candidate for Prime Minister in the 2015 general elections.<ref name=\"primary\">{{cite news |title=Aprovada a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de elei\u00e7\u00f5es prim\u00e1rias no PS a 28 de setembro |first1=Roque |last1=Telma |newspaper=[[Jornal de Not\u00edcias]] |date=6 June 2014 |url=http://www.jn.pt/PaginaInicial/Politica/Interior.aspx?content_id=3957251 |accessdate=4 September 2014}}</ref> Ant\u00f3nio Costa easily defeated Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro in the primaries by a 67% to 31% margin.\n\nIn the [[2015 Portuguese legislative election|2015 legislative elections]], the PS polled a disappointing second place, capturing just 32% of the votes against the 38.6% of the PSD/CDS-PP coalition called [[Portugal Ahead]]. Despite the victory of the PSD/CDS-PP coalition, the centre-left and left-wing parties achieved a clear majority in Parliament. After the second Passos Coelho cabinet fell in Parliament, with the approval of a no-confidence motion, the PS forged an agreement with [[Left Bloc|BE]] and [[Unitary Democratic Coalition|CDU]] to support a PS minority government. For the first time in Portuguese democracy, the leader of the second most voted political force became [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]].\n\nCosta led a very successful first term as Prime Minister with a growing economy, low unemployment and deficit cuts. In the [[2019 European Parliament election in Portugal|2019 May EP elections]], the PS won a landslide by achieving 33.4%, against the 22% of the PSD. The PS also won the [[2019 Portuguese legislative election|October 2019 general election]] with 36% of the votes, against the 28% of the PSD, but by a closer margin than expected. Costa 2nd cabinet was sworn in on 26 October 2019.\n\n==Election results==\n\n===Assembly of the Republic===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:100%; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"50px\"| Election\n! colspan=\"5\"| [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"170px\"| Government\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40px\"| Size\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Leader\n|-\n! width=\"85px\"| Votes\n! width=\"50px\"| %\n! width=\"40px\"| \u00b1[[Percentage point|pp]]\n! width=\"100px\"| Seats won\n! width=\"40px\"| +/\u2212\n|-\n!

It was founded on 19 April 1973 in the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Bad M\u00fcnstereifel]], by militants from the Portuguese Socialist Action ({{lang-pt|Ac\u00e7\u00e3o Socialista Portuguesa}}). The PS is one of the two [[Major party|major parties]] in Portuguese politics, its rival being the centre-right [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD). The current leader of the PS is [[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], the [[Prime Minister of Portugal]]. The party has currently 108 of 230 seats in the Portuguese Parliament following the [[2019 Portuguese legislative election|October 2019 election]], forming a minority government.\n\nPS is a member of the [[Socialist International]], [[Progressive Alliance]] and [[Party of European Socialists]], and has nine members in the [[European Parliament]] within the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|Socialists & Democrats]] (S&D) Group during the [[9th European Parliament|ninth parliament]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ant\u00f3nio Costa img 6536.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]] since November 2015 and Secretary-General since 2014.]]\n{{Social democracy sidebar}}\nThe Socialist Party (PS) was created at a conference of Portuguese Socialist Action (ASP), at that time in exile, on 19 April 1973, in [[Bad M\u00fcnstereifel]] in [[West Germany]]. The twenty-seven delegates decided to found a party of [[socialism]] and [[Political freedom|freedom]], making an explicit reference to a [[classless society]] and without [[Marxism]], redesigned as a source of principal inspiration.\n\nOn 25 April 1974, the [[Carnation Revolution]] brought down the authoritarian regime of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]], established in 1933, and democracy was restored. The general secretary of the PS, M\u00e1rio Soares, returned to Portugal after being in exile in France, and became [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Portugal)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Almeida Santos]] was appointed Minister of Interjurisdictional Coordination in one of the first provisional governments.\n\nAfter the Revolution, elections were called for 25 April 1975 and the Socialist Party (PS) won the [[1975 Portuguese Constituent Assembly election|1975 election for the Constituent Assembly]] and the [[1976 Portuguese legislative election|1976 elections for the National Assembly]], then losing to the [[Democratic Alliance (Portugal)|Democratic Alliance]] (AD) in the [[1979 Portuguese legislative election|1979 legislative election]].\n\nIn 1980, the PS made an electoral alliance called the [[Republican and Socialist Front]] (FRS), between the Independent Social Democrats (ASDI), led by Sousa Franco, and the [[Leftwing Union for the Socialist Democracy]] (UEDS), led by Lopes Cardoso. The alliance failed to defeat the AD.\n\nThey won the 1983 general election, but without an [[absolute majority]], the Socialists formed a [[grand coalition]] with the centre-right [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), creating a \"[[Central Block]]\". The new government began negotiations for Portugal to enter the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC). In 1985 the Central Block broke down and the PS at the time led by [[Almeida Santos]], lost the [[1985 Portuguese legislative election|1985 legislative election]]. Cavaco Silva's PSD won the 1985 elections and again in 1987 and 1991 with absolute majority. The PS was in opposition for more than ten years.\n\nIn 1995, the Socialist Party, then led by [[Ant\u00f3nio Guterres]], won a general election for the first time in twelve years, and in 1999, they failed to obtain what would have been an historic [[absolute majority]] for the party by only one MP. In 2001, after a massive defeat in the 2001 local elections, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres resigned as Prime Minister and called for new elections in 2002. The Socialist Party lost the [[2002 Portuguese legislative election|2002 general election]] by a small margin to the PSD, who formed a coalition government with the [[CDS \u2013 People's Party|People's Party]] (CDS\u2013PP).\n\nIn June 2004, the PS won the [[2004 European Parliament election in Portugal|2004 European elections]] by a landslide, and a few weeks later, [[Dur\u00e3o Barroso]], leader of the PSD and Prime Minister, resigned to become President of the European Commission. In December 2004, [[Jorge Sampaio]], President of the Republic, called fresh [[2005 Portuguese legislative election|elections for February 2005]]. These elections resulted in a landslide victory for the PS, winning for the first time since its foundation an absolute majority. [[Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates]], leader of the PS, became Prime Minister.\n\nIn 2009, after four-and-a-half years in power, the PS lost the [[2009 European Parliament election in Portugal|European Parliament elections]] to the PSD. However, they won the [[2009 Portuguese legislative election|general election]] held on 27 September but failed to renew the absolute majority they won in the [[2005 Portuguese legislative election|2005 election]]. The PS later introduced and legislated [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|same-sex marriage]].\n\nThe [[Eurozone crisis|financial crisis of 2011]] hit Portugal very hard, prompting S\u00f3crates' government to impose harsh [[austerity|austerity measures]]. On 23 March 2011, the entire opposition in Parliament said no to new measures proposed by the government. As a result of this, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates resigned as Prime Minister and a [[2011 Portuguese legislative election|snap election took place on 5 June 2011]].\n\nIn the elections, the PS suffered a huge setback, with 28.1% of the vote, ten points behind the PSD, who formed another coalition government with the CDS-PP. S\u00f3crates resigned as General Secretary on election night after the PS's worst result since 1987. On 23 July 2011, [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro]] was elected as S\u00f3crates' successor.\n\nThe PS, under the leadership of Seguro, won the [[2013 Portuguese local elections|2013 local elections]] making significant gains over the PSD and the Socialists again won the [[2014 European Parliament election in Portugal|European elections on May 2014]] but this time only just. They won 31.5% of the vote against the almost 28% of the alliance between the PSD and CDS-PP. The result was considered quite a disappointment to many Socialist party members and supporters and on May 27 [[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], the then mayor of Lisbon, announced that he would stand for the leadership of the Socialist Party.<ref name=\"leadership\">{{cite news |title=Ant\u00f3nio Costa avan\u00e7a para a lideran\u00e7a do PS |first1=S\u00e1 Louren\u00e7o |last1=Nuno |newspaper=[[P\u00fablico (Portugal)|P\u00fablico]] |date=27 May 2014 |url=http://www.publico.pt/politica/noticia/antonio-costa-avanca-para-a-lideranca-do-ps-1637636 |accessdate=4 September 2014}}</ref> Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro refused to call a new congress and leadership election and instead called for a [[Portuguese Socialist Party prime ministerial primary, 2014|primary election]], to be held on 28 September, to elect the party's candidate for Prime Minister in the 2015 general elections.<ref name=\"primary\">{{cite news |title=Aprovada a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de elei\u00e7\u00f5es prim\u00e1rias no PS a 28 de setembro |first1=Roque |last1=Telma |newspaper=[[Jornal de Not\u00edcias]] |date=6 June 2014 |url=http://www.jn.pt/PaginaInicial/Politica/Interior.aspx?content_id=3957251 |accessdate=4 September 2014}}</ref> Ant\u00f3nio Costa easily defeated Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro in the primaries by a 67% to 31% margin.\n\nIn the [[2015 Portuguese legislative election|2015 legislative elections]], the PS polled a disappointing second place, capturing just 32% of the votes against the 38.6% of the PSD/CDS-PP coalition called [[Portugal Ahead]]. Despite the victory of the PSD/CDS-PP coalition, the centre-left and left-wing parties achieved a clear majority in Parliament. After the second Passos Coelho cabinet fell in Parliament, with the approval of a no-confidence motion, the PS forged an agreement with [[Left Bloc|BE]] and [[Unitary Democratic Coalition|CDU]] to support a PS minority government. For the first time in Portuguese democracy, the leader of the second most voted political force became [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]].\n\nCosta led a very successful first term as Prime Minister with a growing economy, low unemployment and deficit cuts. In the [[2019 European Parliament election in Portugal|2019 May EP elections]], the PS won a landslide by achieving 33.4%, against the 22% of the PSD. The PS also won the [[2019 Portuguese legislative election|October 2019 general election]] with 36% of the votes, against the 28% of the PSD, but by a closer margin than expected.

They were nominated for a [[Juno Awards of 1983|1983 Juno Award]] as [[Juno Award for New Group of the Year|Most Promising Group of the Year]] and again in [[Juno Awards of 1985|1985]] as [[Juno Award for Group of the Year|Group of the Year]].<ref name=\"junoawards.ca\"/> Their first two albums, 1982's [[Worlds Away (Strange Advance album)|''Worlds Away'']]''<ref name=\"collectionscanada.gc.ca2\"/>'' and 1985's ''[[2WO]]'', were Canadian gold selling records.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gold/Platinum |url=https://musiccanada.com/gold-platinum/?_gp_search=strange%20advance |website=musicCanada |accessdate=3 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===1982\u20131995: Formation and Canadian popularity===\nStrange Advance was initially made up of Drew Arnott (keyboards, percussion, vocals), Darryl Kromm (lead vocals, guitars), and Paul Iverson (bass).  The three met in [[Vancouver]] and founded the group in 1980. Initially called '''Metropolis''', they were forced to change their name after discovering a band in Germany using \"Metropolis.\"\n\nThe group's first album, ''[[Worlds Away (Strange Advance album)|Worlds Away]]'' featured the title track, \"Worlds Away,\" which saw modest airplay in North American markets in 1983.  The album was produced by [[Bruce Fairbairn]], known for his work with [[Loverboy]] and [[Prism (band)|Prism]], but featured a very different sound from those groups.<ref name=\"jam.canoe.ca\" /> Rather than commercial [[hard rock]], Strange Advance's music was a fusion of [[progressive rock]] and [[New wave music|new wave]], with a heavy reliance on synthesizers and keyboards.\n\nIverson left the group after the first album and was not replaced.  The group's 1985 album ''[[2WO]]'' also went gold in Canada and was produced by Arnott, using an extensive array of session players, and brought the band their first big Canadian hit with \"We Run.\"  Strange Advance had never played a live gig prior to 1985, so Arnott and Kromm added musicians Ric deGroot (keyboards), Ian Cameron (guitar, violin), Joey Alvero (bass) and David Quinton (drums) to the line-up as session players, and supported the first two albums with a tour of Eastern Canada.\n\nStrange Advance's third album, 1988's ''[[The Distance Between]]''<ref name=\"collectionscanada.gc.ca1\"/> also used well-known session musicians (including [[Randy Bachman]] and [[Allan Holdsworth]]), and produced the top 20 single \"Love Becomes Electric.\" Following this album's release, the group became essentially inactive.\n\nIn 1995, the Strange Advance compilation album ''Worlds Away & Back'' featured a mix of previously released material, outtakes, remixes, demos, and three newly recorded tracks\u2014one from 1991, and two from 1995.\n\n===2016\u2013present: Remastering and reunion===\nOn 24 June 2016, ''[[The Distance Between]]'' was remastered and re-released on CD with two bonus tracks, an extended club mix of \"Love Becomes Electric\" and the previously unreleased song, \"Flow My Tears\".\n\nIn December 2018, ''[[Worlds Away (Strange Advance album)|Worlds Away]]'' was remastered and re-released on CD with two bonus tracks, the UK Dance Mix of \"Love Games\" (transferred from vinyl) and the b-side to \"She Controls Me\" \u2013 \"Lost in Your Eyes.\" This marks the first time their debut has seen a CD release of any kind, despite the albums' popularity. This release is only available in the Philippines, on the Sound Philosophy label, which is a new boutique label for titles not released on CD. This version appears to be sourced from the master tapes.\n\nOn 17 September 2018, Drew Arnott announced a crowdfunding campaign on Facebook to finance a summer 2019 Strange Advance reunion tour.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Drain |first1=Heather |title=Who Can Touch Us When We Run?: The Pain & Beauty of Strange Advance |url=https://diaboliquemagazine.com/who-can-touch-us-when-we-run-the-pain-beauty-of-strange-advance/ |website=Diabolique magazine |accessdate=3 July 2019 |date=5 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/strangeadvance1/status/1042583635361128448 |title= Strange Advance |publisher=Strange Advance |accessdate=3 July 2019 |date=19 September 2018}}</ref> The fundraising was successful, and the band (minus Kromm) planned to perform in 2019 for the Radical Orbits Tour.

[[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].  They were nominated for a [[Juno Awards of 1983|1983 Juno Award]] as [[Juno Award for New Group of the Year|Most Promising Group of the Year]] and again in [[Juno Awards of 1985|1985]] as [[Juno Award for Group of the Year|Group of the Year]].<ref name=\"junoawards.ca\"/>  Their first two albums, 1982's [[Worlds Away (Strange Advance album)|''Worlds Away'']]''<ref name=\"collectionscanada.gc.ca2\"/>'' and 1985's ''[[2WO]]'', were Canadian gold selling records.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gold/Platinum |url=https://musiccanada.com/gold-platinum/?_gp_search=strange%20advance |website=musicCanada |accessdate=3 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===1982\u20131995: Formation and Canadian popularity===\nStrange Advance was initially made up of Drew Arnott (keyboards, percussion, vocals), Darryl Kromm (lead vocals, guitars), and Paul Iverson (bass).  The three met in [[Vancouver]] and founded the group in 1980. Initially called '''Metropolis''', they were forced to change their name after discovering a band in Germany using \"Metropolis.\"\n\nThe group's first album, ''[[Worlds Away (Strange Advance album)|Worlds Away]]'' featured the title track, \"Worlds Away,\" which saw modest airplay in North American markets in 1983.  The album was produced by [[Bruce Fairbairn]], known for his work with [[Loverboy]] and [[Prism (band)|Prism]], but featured a very different sound from those groups.<ref name=\"jam.canoe.ca\" /> Rather than commercial [[hard rock]], Strange Advance's music was a fusion of [[progressive rock]] and [[New wave music|new wave]], with a heavy reliance on synthesizers and keyboards.\n\nIverson left the group after the first album and was not replaced.  The group's 1985 album ''[[2WO]]'' also went gold in Canada and was produced by Arnott, using an extensive array of session players, and brought the band their first big Canadian hit with \"We Run.\"  Strange Advance had never played a live gig prior to 1985, so Arnott and Kromm added musicians Ric deGroot (keyboards), Ian Cameron (guitar, violin), Joey Alvero (bass) and David Quinton (drums) to the line-up as session players, and supported the first two albums with a tour of Eastern Canada.\n\nStrange Advance's third album, 1988's ''[[The Distance Between]]''<ref name=\"collectionscanada.gc.ca1\"/> also used well-known session musicians (including [[Randy Bachman]] and [[Allan Holdsworth]]), and produced the top 20 single \"Love Becomes Electric.\" Following this album's release, the group became essentially inactive.\n\nIn 1995, the Strange Advance compilation album ''Worlds Away & Back'' featured a mix of previously released material, outtakes, remixes, demos, and three newly recorded tracks\u2014one from 1991, and two from 1995.\n\n===2016\u2013present: Remastering and reunion===\nOn June 24, 2016, ''[[The Distance Between]]'' was remastered and re-released on CD with two bonus tracks, an extended club mix of \"Love Becomes Electric\" and the previously unreleased song, \"Flow My Tears\".\n\nIn December 2018, ''[[Worlds Away (Strange Advance album)|Worlds Away]]'' was remastered and re-released on CD with two bonus tracks, the UK Dance Mix of \"Love Games\" (transferred from vinyl) and the b-side to \"She Controls Me\" - \"Lost In Your Eyes.\" This marks the first time their debut has seen a CD release of any kind, despite the albums' popularity. This release is only available in the Philippines, on the Sound Philosophy label, which is a new boutique label for titles not released on CD. This version appears to be sourced from the master tapes.\n\nOn September 17, 2018, Drew Arnott announced a crowdfunding campaign on Facebook to finance a summer 2019 Strange Advance reunion tour.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Drain |first1=Heather |title=Who Can Touch Us When We Run?: The Pain & Beauty of Strange Advance |url=https://diaboliquemagazine.com/who-can-touch-us-when-we-run-the-pain-beauty-of-strange-advance/ |website=Diabolique magazine |accessdate=3 July 2019 |date=5 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/strangeadvance1/status/1042583635361128448 |title= Strange Advance |publisher=Strange Advance |accessdate=3 July 2019 |date=19 September 2018}}</ref> The fundraising was successful, and the band (minus Kromm) planned to perform in 2019 for the Radical Orbits Tour.
