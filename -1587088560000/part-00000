Burnt out after the success of Weezer's [[Weezer (Blue Album)|self-titled debut album]], Cuomo enrolled at [[Harvard University]] but dropped out to record Weezer's second album, [[Pinkerton (album)|''Pinkerton'']] (1996); he re-enrolled and graduated in 2008. Though ''Pinkerton'' is now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s and has been [[certified platinum]], it was initially a commercial and critical failure, pushing Cuomo's songwriting toward pop music.\n\nCuomo has also released three compilation albums of home demos: ''[[Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo]]'' (2007), ''[[Alone II: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo]]'' (2008) and [[Alone III: The Pinkerton Years|''Alone III: The'' Pinkerton ''Years'']] (2011). He has collaborated with a number of artists; in 2013, he and [[Scott Murphy (musician)|Scott Murphy]] released a self-titled Japanese-language album under the name [[Scott & Rivers]].\n\n== Early life ==\nRivers Cuomo was born in [[Manhattan]] to parents of [[Italian American|Italian]] and [[German American|German]]-[[English American|English]] descent.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jun/29/popandrock|title=My sporting life: Rivers Cuomo, front man of American rock band Weezer|last=Collinge|first=Miranda|date=2008-06-29|work=The Guardian|location=London}}</ref> Accounts differ as to the origin of his name. According to one account, Cuomo's mother Beverly Shoenberger named him Rivers either because he was born between [[East River|East]] and [[Hudson River|Hudson]] rivers in Manhattan or because she could hear a river outside her hospital window. However, his father, Frank Cuomo, a musician who played drums on the 1971 album ''[[Odyssey of Iska]]'' by jazz saxophonist [[Wayne Shorter]], claims Cuomo was named after three prominent soccer players.<ref name=\"page 32\">Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 3</ref><ref name=\"Odysseya2\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r147526|pure_url=yes}}|title=Odyssey of Iska &gt; Overview|last=Yanow|first=Scott|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=2008-01-06}}</ref>\n\nRivers was raised in [[Rochester, New York]] at the [[Rochester Zen Center]], until his father left the family in 1975. His mother relocated the family to [[Yogaville]], an [[ashram]] in [[Pomfret, Connecticut]]. Cuomo attended the Pomfret Community School, and his mother married Stephen Kitts.<ref name=\"page 52\">Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 5</ref>\n\nIn 1980, Yogaville relocated to [[Virginia]].

Burnt out after the success of Weezer's [[Weezer (Blue Album)|self-titled debut album]], Cuomo enrolled at [[Harvard University]] but dropped out to record Weezer's second album, [[Pinkerton (album)|''Pinkerton'']] (1996); he re-enrolled and graduated in 2008. Though ''Pinkerton'' is now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s and has been [[certified platinum]], it was initially a commercial and critical failure, pushing Cuomo's songwriting toward pop music.\n\nCuomo has also released three compilation albums of home demos: ''[[Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo]]'' (2007), ''[[Alone II: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo]]'' (2008) and [[Alone III: The Pinkerton Years|''Alone III: The'' Pinkerton ''Years'']] (2011).

According to one account, Cuomo's mother Beverly Shoenberger named him Rivers either because he was born between [[East River|East]] and [[Hudson River|Hudson]] rivers in Manhattan or because she could hear a river outside her hospital window. However, his father, Frank Cuomo, a musician who played drums on the 1971 album ''[[Odyssey of Iska]]'' by jazz saxophonist [[Wayne Shorter]], claims Cuomo was named after three prominent soccer players.<ref name=\"page 32\">Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 3</ref><ref name=\"Odysseya2\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r147526|pure_url=yes}}|title=Odyssey of Iska &gt; Overview|last=Yanow|first=Scott|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=2008-01-06}}</ref>\n\nRivers was raised in [[Rochester, New York]] at the [[Rochester Zen Center]], until his father left the family in 1975.

The South Slavs today include the nations of [[Bosniaks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Croats]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]] and [[Slovenes]]. They are the main population of the [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]]an countries of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovenia]].\n\nIn the 20th century, the country of [[Yugoslavia]] (lit. \"South Slavia\"/\"Southern Slavland\") united the regions inhabited by South Slavic nations{{spaced ndash}} with the key exception of [[Bulgaria]]{{spaced ndash}} into a single state. The concept of ''Yugoslavia'', a single state for all South Slavic peoples, emerged in the late 17th century and gained prominence through the 19th-century [[Illyrian movement]]. The [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, was proclaimed on 1 December 1918, following the unification of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] with the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe South Slavs are known in Serbian, Macedonian and Montenegrin as ''Ju\u017eni Sloveni'' ({{cyrl|\u0408\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438}}); in Bulgarian as ''Yuzhni Slavyani'' ({{cyrl|\u042e\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0438}}); in Croatian and Bosnian as ''Ju\u017eni Slaveni''; in Slovene as ''Ju\u017eni Slovani''. The Slavic root ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/jug\u044a|*jug\u044a]]'' means \"south\". The [[Slavic ethnonym]] itself was used by 6th-century writers to describe the southern group of Early Slavs (the ''[[Sclaveni]]''); West Slavs were called ''[[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]]'' and East Slavs ''[[Antes (people)|Antes]]''.{{sfn|Kmietowicz|1976}} The South Slavs are also called \"Balkan Slavs\",<ref>{{harvnb|Kmietowicz|1976}}, {{harvnb|Vlasto|1970}}</ref> although this term does not encompass the Slovenes.\n\nAnother name popular in the early modern period was \"Illyrians\", the name of a pre-Slavic Balkan people, a name first adopted by Dalmatian intellectuals in the late 15th century to refer to South Slavic lands and population.{{sfn|URI|2000|p=104}} It was then used by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Illyrian Provinces|France]], and notably adopted by the 19th-century Croatian nationalist and Pan-Slavist [[Illyrian movement]].{{sfn|Hupchick|2002|p=199}} Eventually, the idea of [[Yugoslavism]] appeared, aimed at uniting all South Slav-populated territories into a common state.

Often, the Byzantine Empire was stretched, defending its rich Asian provinces from Arabs, Persians and others. This meant that even numerically small, disorganised early Slavic raids were capable of causing much disruption, but could not capture the larger, fortified cities.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The first Slavic raid south of the Danube was recorded by Procopius, who mentions an attack of the Antes, \"who dwell close to the Sclaveni\", probably in 518.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Curta|2001|p=75}}</ref> Sclaveni are first mentioned in the context of the military policy on the Danube frontier of Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527\u2013565).{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=76}} Throughout the century, Slavs raided and plundered deep into the Balkans, from Dalmatia to Greece and Thrace, and were also at times recruited as mercenaries, fighting the [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=78\u201386}} Justinian seems to have used the strategy of '[[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]]', and the Sclaveni and Antes are mentioned as fighting each other.{{sfn|James|2014|p=97}} The Antes are last mentioned as anti-Byzantine belligerents in 545, and the Sclaveni continued to raid the Balkans.<ref name=Byzantinoslavica-2003-78>{{cite book|title=Byzantinoslavica |volume=61\u201362 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twwrAQAAIAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Academia|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> In 558 the [[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] arrived at the Black Sea steppe, and defeated the Antes between the Dnieper and Dniester.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=536}} The Avars subsequently allied themselves with the Sclaveni,{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=537\u2013539}} although there was an episode in which the Sclavene [[Daurentius]] (fl. 577\u2013579), the first Slavic chieftain recorded by name, dismissed Avar suzerainty and retorted that \"Others do not conquer our land, we conquer theirs [...] so it shall always be for us\", and had the Avar envoys slain.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=47, 91}} By the 580s, as the Slav communities on the Danube became larger and more organized, and as the Avars exerted their influence, raids became larger and resulted in permanent settlement. Most scholars consider the period of 581-584 as the beginning of large-scale Slavic settlement in the Balkans.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=31}} F. Curta points out that evidence of substantial Slavic presence does not appear before the 7th century and remains qualitatively different from the \"Slavic culture\" found north of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=308}} In the mid-6th century, the Byzantines re-asserted their control of the Danube frontier, thereby reducing the economic value of Slavic raiding. This growing economic isolation, combined with external threats from the Avars and Byzantines, led to political and military mobilisation. Meanwhile, the itinerant form of agriculture (lacking [[crop rotation]]) may have encouraged micro-regional mobility. Seventh-century archaeological sites show earlier hamlet collections evolving into larger communities with differentiated zones for public feasts, craftmanship, etc.{{sfn|Curta|2007|p=61}} It has been suggested that the Sclaveni were the ancestors of the Serbo-Croatian group while the Antes were that of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavs]], with much mixture in the contact zones.<ref>{{harvnb|Hupchick|2004}}, {{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=26}}</ref> The diminished pre-Slavic inhabitants, also including also Romanized native peoples,{{Cref2|a}} fled from the barbarian invasions and sought refuge inside fortified cities and islands, whilst others fled to remote mountains and forests and adopted a [[transhumant]] lifestyle.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=37}} The Romance speakers within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]] managed to retain their culture and language for a long time.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Meanwhile, the numerous Slavs mixed with and assimilated the descendants of the indigenous population.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=38, 41}}\n\nSubsequent information about Slavs' interaction with the Greeks and early Slavic states comes from the 10th-century ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (DAI) by Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]], the 7th-century compilations of the ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'' (MSD) and the ''History'' by [[Theophylact Simocatta]]. DAI mentions the beginnings of the Croatian, Serbian and Bulgarian states from the early 7th to the mid-10th century. MSD and Theophylact Simocatta mention the Slavic tribes in Thessaly and Macedonia at the beginning of the 7th century. The 9th-century ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'' (RFA) also mention Slavic tribes in contact with the [[Franks]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nBy 700 AD, Slavs had settled in most of the Central and Southeast Europe, from Austria even down to the Peloponnese of Greece, and from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, with the exception of the coastal areas and certain mountainous regions of the Greek peninsula.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=36}} The [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], who arrived in Europe in the late 550s and had a great impact in the Balkans, had from their base in the Carpathian plain, west of main Slavic settlements, asserted control over Slavic tribes with whom they besieged Roman cities. Their influence in the Balkans however diminished by the early 7th century and they were finally defeated and disappeared as a power at the turn of the 9th century by [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and the [[Frankish Empire]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=29\u201343}} The first South Slavic polity and regional power was [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], a state formed in 681 as a union between the much numerous [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavic]] [[Sclaveni|tribes]] and the [[bulgars]] of [[Asparuh of Bulgaria|Khan Asparuh]]. The scattered Slavs in Greece, the ''Sklavinia'', were Hellenized.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=41}} Romance-speakers lived within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Traditional historiography, based on DAI, holds that the migration of [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] to the Balkans was part of a second Slavic wave, placed during Heraclius' reign.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=66}}\n \nInhabiting the territory between the Franks in the north and Byzantium in the south, the Slavs were exposed to competing influences.{{sfn|Portal|1969|p=90}} In 863 to Christianized [[Great Moravia]] were sent two Byzantine brothers monks [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], Slavs from Thessaloniki on missionary work. They created the [[Glagolitic script]] and the first Slavic written language, [[Old Church Slavonic]], which they used to translate Biblical works. At the time, the West and South Slavs still spoke a similar language.

In 1371, the Ottomans defeated a large Serbian army at the [[Battle of Maritsa]], and in 1389 defeated the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Kosovo]]. By now, Serbian and Bulgarian rulers became Ottoman vassals, the southern Serbian provinces and Bulgaria holding out until annexation in the 1390s. The Ottomans conquered Constantinople (1453), Greece (1453\u201360), the [[Serbian Despotate]] (1459) and [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]] (1463). Much of the Balkans was under Ottoman rule throughout the [[early modern period]]. Ottoman rule lasted from the 14th into the early 20th century in some territories. Ottoman society was multi-ethnic and multi-religious, and confessional groups were divided according to the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|''millet'' system]], in which Orthodox Christians (Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, etc.) constituted the [[Rum Millet]]. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Christians had ''[[dhimmi]]'' status, which entailed certain taxes and lesser rights. Through Islamization, communities of [[Slavic Muslims]] emerged, which survive until today in Bosnia, south Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bulgaria. \n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] controlled what is today Slovenia, Croatia and northern Serbia. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], which included smaller parts of what is today Croatia, was a crown land of the Habsburg emperor. The early modern period saw large-scale migrations of Orthodox Slavs (mainly Serbs) to the north and west. The [[Military Frontier]] was set up as the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' against Ottoman incursions. There were several rebellions against Ottoman rule, but it was not until the 18th century that parts of the Balkans, namely [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Serbia, were liberated]] for a longer period. While [[Pan-Slavism]] has its origins in the 17th-century Slavic Catholic clergymen in the Republic of Venice and Republic of Ragusa, it crystallized only in the mid-19th century amidst rise of nationalism in the Ottoman and Habsburg empires.\n\n==Statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

These Serbo-Croatian standards are all based on the [[Shtokavian]] dialect group. Other dialect groups, which have lower intelligibility with Shtokavian, are [[Chakavian]] in [[Dalmatia]] and [[Kajkavian]] in [[Croatia proper]]. The dominance of Shtokavian across Serbo-Croatian speaking lands is due to historical westward migration during the Ottoman period. Slovene is South Slavic but has many features shared with West Slavic languages. The [[Prekmurje Slovene]] and [[Kajkavian]] are especially close, and there is no sharp delineation between them. In southeastern Serbia, dialects enter a transitional zone with Bulgarian and Macedonian, with features of both groups, and are commonly called [[Torlakian]].\n\nThe Eastern South Slavic languages are Bulgarian and Macedonian. Bulgarian has retained more archaic Slavic features in relation to the other languages. Bulgarian has two main [[yat]] splits. Slavic Macedonian was codified in Communist Yugoslavia in 1945 and was historically classified as Bulgarian. The [[Macedonian dialects]], divided into three main groups, are regarded overall as being transitional to Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian. The westernmost [[Bulgarian dialects]] (called [[Shopi]]) share features with Serbo-Croatian. Furthermore, in Greece there is a notable Slavic-speaking population [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|in Greek Macedonia]] and [[Pomaks|western Thrace]].\n\nBalkan Slavic languages are part of a \"[[Balkan sprachbund]]\" with [[areal feature]]s shared with other non-Slavic languages in the Balkans.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Plos.Balkans.2.png|thumb|400px|\"Admixture plot\" of automosal SNPs in 7 major population groups, including in Balkans (middle columns).]]\nThe earliest [[Genetic analysis|genetic studies]] for population affinities were according to 'classical markers', i.e. protein and blood group polymorphisms, according to which Cavalli-Sforza's team suggested several European cluster groups: \"Germanic\", \"Scandinavian\", \"Celtic\", south-western European and eastern European. The Yugoslavs (Bulgarians were not tested) did not group into any of the above but formed a group of their own, attributed to internal heterogeneity.\n\nAccording to a 2006 Y-DNA study, most South Slavs clustered together, while western Croats and Slovenians were instead clustered with West and East Slavic populations.

South of the [[Jire\u010dek line]] were the [[Greeks]]. To the north, there were [[Illyrians]], [[Thracians]] and [[Dacians]]. They were mainly tribalistic and generally lacked awareness of any ethno-political affiliation. Over the classical ages, they were at times invaded, conquered and influenced by [[Celts]], [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]]. Roman influence, however, was initially limited to cities concentrated along the Dalmatian coast, later spreading to a few scattered cities inside the Balkan interior, particularly along the river Danube ([[Sirmium]], [[Belgrade]], [[Ni\u0161]]). Roman citizens from throughout the empire settled in these cities and in the adjacent countryside. Following the fall of Rome and numerous barbarian raids, the population in the Balkans dropped, as did commerce and general standards of living. Many people were killed or taken prisoner by invaders. This demographic decline was particularly attributed to a drop in the number of indigenous peasants living in rural areas. They were the most vulnerable to raids and were also hardest hit by the financial crises that plagued the falling empire. However, the Balkans were not desolate, and considerable numbers of indigenous people remained. Only certain areas tended to be affected by the raids (e.g. lands around major land routes, such as the Morava corridor).{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=9\u201312, 37}} In addition to the autochthons, there were remnants of previous invaders such as \"[[Huns]]\" and various [[Germanic peoples]] when the Slavs arrived. [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian tribes]] such as the [[Iazyges]] were still recorded as living in the [[Banat]] region of the Danube.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=57}} The mixing of Slavs and other peoples is evident in

The South Slavs today include the nations of [[Bosniaks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Croats]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]] and [[Slovenes]]. They are the main population of the [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]]an countries of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovenia]].\n\nIn the 20th century, the country of [[Yugoslavia]] (lit. \"South Slavia\"/\"Southern Slavland\") united the regions inhabited by South Slavic nations{{spaced ndash}} with the key exception of [[Bulgaria]]{{spaced ndash}} into a single state. The concept of ''Yugoslavia'', a single state for all South Slavic peoples, emerged in the late 17th century and gained prominence through the 19th-century [[Illyrian movement]]. The [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, was proclaimed on 1 December 1918, following the unification of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] with the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe South Slavs are known in Serbian, Macedonian and Montenegrin as ''Ju\u017eni Sloveni'' ({{cyrl|\u0408\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438}}); in Bulgarian as ''Yuzhni Slavyani'' ({{cyrl|\u042e\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0438}}); in Croatian and Bosnian as ''Ju\u017eni Slaveni''; in Slovene as ''Ju\u017eni Slovani''. The Slavic root ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/jug\u044a|*jug\u044a]]'' means \"south\". The [[Slavic ethnonym]] itself was used by 6th-century writers to describe the southern group of Early Slavs (the ''[[Sclaveni]]''); West Slavs were called ''[[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]]'' and East Slavs ''[[Antes (people)|Antes]]''.{{sfn|Kmietowicz|1976}} The South Slavs are also called \"Balkan Slavs\",<ref>{{harvnb|Kmietowicz|1976}}, {{harvnb|Vlasto|1970}}</ref> although this term does not encompass the Slovenes.\n\nAnother name popular in the early modern period was \"Illyrians\", the name of a pre-Slavic Balkan people, a name first adopted by Dalmatian intellectuals in the late 15th century to refer to South Slavic lands and population.{{sfn|URI|2000|p=104}} It was then used by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Illyrian Provinces|France]], and notably adopted by the 19th-century Croatian nationalist and Pan-Slavist [[Illyrian movement]].{{sfn|Hupchick|2002|p=199}} Eventually, the idea of [[Yugoslavism]] appeared, aimed at uniting all South Slav-populated territories into a common state.

Often, the Byzantine Empire was stretched, defending its rich Asian provinces from Arabs, Persians and others. This meant that even numerically small, disorganised early Slavic raids were capable of causing much disruption, but could not capture the larger, fortified cities.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The first Slavic raid south of the Danube was recorded by Procopius, who mentions an attack of the Antes, \"who dwell close to the Sclaveni\", probably in 518.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Curta|2001|p=75}}</ref> Sclaveni are first mentioned in the context of the military policy on the Danube frontier of Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527\u2013565).{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=76}} Throughout the century, Slavs raided and plundered deep into the Balkans, from Dalmatia to Greece and Thrace, and were also at times recruited as mercenaries, fighting the [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=78\u201386}} Justinian seems to have used the strategy of '[[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]]', and the Sclaveni and Antes are mentioned as fighting each other.{{sfn|James|2014|p=97}} The Antes are last mentioned as anti-Byzantine belligerents in 545, and the Sclaveni continued to raid the Balkans.<ref name=Byzantinoslavica-2003-78>{{cite book|title=Byzantinoslavica |volume=61\u201362 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twwrAQAAIAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Academia|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> In 558 the [[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] arrived at the Black Sea steppe, and defeated the Antes between the Dnieper and Dniester.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=536}} The Avars subsequently allied themselves with the Sclaveni,{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=537\u2013539}} although there was an episode in which the Sclavene [[Daurentius]] (fl. 577\u2013579), the first Slavic chieftain recorded by name, dismissed Avar suzerainty and retorted that \"Others do not conquer our land, we conquer theirs [...] so it shall always be for us\", and had the Avar envoys slain.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=47, 91}} By the 580s, as the Slav communities on the Danube became larger and more organized, and as the Avars exerted their influence, raids became larger and resulted in permanent settlement. Most scholars consider the period of 581-584 as the beginning of large-scale Slavic settlement in the Balkans.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=31}} F. Curta points out that evidence of substantial Slavic presence does not appear before the 7th century and remains qualitatively different from the \"Slavic culture\" found north of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=308}} In the mid-6th century, the Byzantines re-asserted their control of the Danube frontier, thereby reducing the economic value of Slavic raiding. This growing economic isolation, combined with external threats from the Avars and Byzantines, led to political and military mobilisation. Meanwhile, the itinerant form of agriculture (lacking [[crop rotation]]) may have encouraged micro-regional mobility. Seventh-century archaeological sites show earlier hamlet collections evolving into larger communities with differentiated zones for public feasts, craftmanship, etc.{{sfn|Curta|2007|p=61}} It has been suggested that the Sclaveni were the ancestors of the Serbo-Croatian group while the Antes were that of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavs]], with much mixture in the contact zones.<ref>{{harvnb|Hupchick|2004}}, {{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=26}}</ref> The diminished pre-Slavic inhabitants, also including also Romanized native peoples,{{Cref2|a}} fled from the barbarian invasions and sought refuge inside fortified cities and islands, whilst others fled to remote mountains and forests and adopted a [[transhumant]] lifestyle.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=37}} The Romance speakers within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]] managed to retain their culture and language for a long time.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Meanwhile, the numerous Slavs mixed with and assimilated the descendants of the indigenous population.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=38, 41}}\n\nSubsequent information about Slavs' interaction with the Greeks and early Slavic states comes from the 10th-century ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (DAI) by Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]], the 7th-century compilations of the ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'' (MSD) and the ''History'' by [[Theophylact Simocatta]]. DAI mentions the beginnings of the Croatian, Serbian and Bulgarian states from the early 7th to the mid-10th century. MSD and Theophylact Simocatta mention the Slavic tribes in Thessaly and Macedonia at the beginning of the 7th century. The 9th-century ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'' (RFA) also mention Slavic tribes in contact with the [[Franks]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nBy 700 AD, Slavs had settled in most of the Central and Southeast Europe, from Austria even down to the Peloponnese of Greece, and from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, with the exception of the coastal areas and certain mountainous regions of the Greek peninsula.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=36}} The [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], who arrived in Europe in the late 550s and had a great impact in the Balkans, had from their base in the Carpathian plain, west of main Slavic settlements, asserted control over Slavic tribes with whom they besieged Roman cities.

In 1371, the Ottomans defeated a large Serbian army at the [[Battle of Maritsa]], and in 1389 defeated the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Kosovo]]. By now, Serbian and Bulgarian rulers became Ottoman vassals, the southern Serbian provinces and Bulgaria holding out until annexation in the 1390s. The Ottomans conquered Constantinople (1453), Greece (1453\u201360), the [[Serbian Despotate]] (1459) and [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]] (1463). Much of the Balkans was under Ottoman rule throughout the [[early modern period]]. Ottoman rule lasted from the 14th into the early 20th century in some territories. Ottoman society was multi-ethnic and multi-religious, and confessional groups were divided according to the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|''millet'' system]], in which Orthodox Christians (Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, etc.) constituted the [[Rum Millet]]. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Christians had ''[[dhimmi]]'' status, which entailed certain taxes and lesser rights. Through Islamization, communities of [[Slavic Muslims]] emerged, which survive until today in Bosnia, south Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bulgaria. \n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] controlled what is today Slovenia, Croatia and northern Serbia. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], which included smaller parts of what is today Croatia, was a crown land of the Habsburg emperor. The early modern period saw large-scale migrations of Orthodox Slavs (mainly Serbs) to the north and west. The [[Military Frontier]] was set up as the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' against Ottoman incursions. There were several rebellions against Ottoman rule, but it was not until the 18th century that parts of the Balkans, namely [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Serbia, were liberated]] for a longer period. While [[Pan-Slavism]] has its origins in the 17th-century Slavic Catholic clergymen in the Republic of Venice and Republic of Ragusa, it crystallized only in the mid-19th century amidst rise of nationalism in the Ottoman and Habsburg empires.\n\n==Statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

These Serbo-Croatian standards are all based on the [[Shtokavian]] dialect group. Other dialect groups, which have lower intelligibility with Shtokavian, are [[Chakavian]] in [[Dalmatia]] and [[Kajkavian]] in [[Croatia proper]]. The dominance of Shtokavian across Serbo-Croatian speaking lands is due to historical westward migration during the Ottoman period. Slovene is South Slavic but has many features shared with West Slavic languages. The [[Prekmurje Slovene]] and [[Kajkavian]] are especially close, and there is no sharp delineation between them. In southeastern Serbia, dialects enter a transitional zone with Bulgarian and Macedonian, with features of both groups, and are commonly called [[Torlakian]].\n\nThe Eastern South Slavic languages are Bulgarian and Macedonian. Bulgarian has retained more archaic Slavic features in relation to the other languages. Bulgarian has two main [[yat]] splits. Slavic Macedonian was codified in Communist Yugoslavia in 1945 and was historically classified as Bulgarian. The [[Macedonian dialects]], divided into three main groups, are regarded overall as being transitional to Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian. The westernmost [[Bulgarian dialects]] (called [[Shopi]]) share features with Serbo-Croatian. Furthermore, in Greece there is a notable Slavic-speaking population [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|in Greek Macedonia]] and [[Pomaks|western Thrace]].\n\nBalkan Slavic languages are part of a \"[[Balkan sprachbund]]\" with [[areal feature]]s shared with other non-Slavic languages in the Balkans.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Plos.Balkans.2.png|thumb|400px|\"Admixture plot\" of automosal SNPs in 7 major population groups, including in Balkans (middle columns).]]\nThe earliest [[Genetic analysis|genetic studies]] for population affinities were according to 'classical markers', i.e. protein and blood group polymorphisms, according to which Cavalli-Sforza's team suggested several European cluster groups: \"Germanic\", \"Scandinavian\", \"Celtic\", south-western European and eastern European. The Yugoslavs (Bulgarians were not tested) did not group into any of the above but formed a group of their own, attributed to internal heterogeneity.\n\nAccording to a 2006 Y-DNA study, most South Slavs clustered together, while western Croats and Slovenians were instead clustered with West and East Slavic populations. Southern-Slavic populations (Serbs, Bosnians, Macedonians, and northern Croats) are\ngenetically distinct from their northern linguistic relatives.<ref name=\"R\u0119ba\u0142a ''et al.'' 2007\">{{cite journal | pmid = 17364156 | year = 2007 | last1 = Reba\u0142a | first1 = K | last2 = Mikulich | first2 = AI | last3 = Tsybovsky | first3 = IS | last4 = Siv\u00e1kov\u00e1 | first4 = D | last5 = Dzupinkov\u00e1 | first5 = Z | last6 = Szczerkowska-Dobosz | first6 = A | last7 = Szczerkowska | first7 = Z | title = Y-STR variation among Slavs: Evidence for the Slavic homeland in the middle Dnieper basin | volume = 52 | issue = 5 | pages = 406\u201314 | doi = 10.1007/s10038-007-0125-6 | journal = Journal of Human Genetics | doi-access = free }}</ref> A 2008 study concluded that except for some isolated communities, Europeans are somewhat genetically homogeneous, and individual population groups are often closely related to their immediate neighbours (irrespective of language or ethnicity).<ref>{{Citation |last=Novembre |first=J |last2=Johnson |first2=T |last3=Bryc |first3=K |title=Genes mirror geography within Europe |journal=Nature |volume=456 |issue=7218 |pages=98\u2013101 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18758442 |doi=10.1038/nature07331 |pmc=2735096|bibcode = 2008Natur.456...98N |displayauthors=1 |last4=Kutalik |last5=Boyko |first5=AR |last6=Auton |first6=A |last7=Indap |first7=A |last8=King |first8=KS |last9=Bergmann |first9=S |last10=Nelson |first10=MR |last11=Stephens |first11=M |last12=Bustamante|first12=CD}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |vauthors=Lao O, Lu TT, Nothnagel M, etal |title=Correlation between genetic and geographic structure in Europe |journal=Curr.

South of the [[Jire\u010dek line]] were the [[Greeks]]. To the north, there were [[Illyrians]], [[Thracians]] and [[Dacians]]. They were mainly tribalistic and generally lacked awareness of any ethno-political affiliation. Over the classical ages, they were at times invaded, conquered and influenced by [[Celts]], [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]]. Roman influence, however, was initially limited to cities concentrated along the Dalmatian coast, later spreading to a few scattered cities inside the Balkan interior, particularly along the river Danube ([[Sirmium]], [[Belgrade]], [[Ni\u0161]]). Roman citizens from throughout the empire settled in these cities and in the adjacent countryside. Following the fall of Rome and numerous barbarian raids, the population in the Balkans dropped, as did commerce and general standards of living. Many people were killed or taken prisoner by invaders. This demographic decline was particularly attributed to a drop in the number of indigenous peasants living in rural areas. They were the most vulnerable to raids and were also hardest hit by the financial crises that plagued the falling empire. However, the Balkans were not desolate, and considerable numbers of indigenous people remained. Only certain areas tended to be affected by the raids (e.g. lands around major land routes, such as the Morava corridor).{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=9\u201312, 37}} In addition to the autochthons, there were remnants of previous invaders such as \"[[Huns]]\" and various [[Germanic peoples]] when the Slavs arrived. [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian tribes]] such as the [[Iazyges]] were still recorded as living in the [[Banat]] region of the Danube.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=57}} The mixing of Slavs and other peoples is evident in

His home was attacked again in 1995 after he had published a letter to President [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani|Rafsanjani]] in which he openly criticized certain governmental policies. His books and parts of his writing were confiscated and his youngest son, Javad, arrested and later sentenced to three years imprisonment. Furthermore, Rohani was pledged \u201cnot to continue as \u2018Source of Emulation\u2019 for his seven million followers and not to have any visitors.\u201d\n\nAfter the fall of [[Saddam Hussein]], Rohani attempted to relocate to Iraq but has been barred from leaving the country.

It was preceded by the [[Sui dynasty]] and followed by the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] in Chinese history. Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization, and a [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] of cosmopolitan culture.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p= 1}} Tang territory, acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers, rivaled that of the [[Han dynasty]]. The Tang capital at [[Chang'an]] (present-day [[Xi'an]]) was the most populous city in the world in its day.\n\nThe [[House of Li|L\u01d0 family]] ({{Lang-zh|c=\u674e|s=|t=|labels=no}}) founded the dynasty, seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire. The dynasty was interrupted for 15 years when Empress [[Wu Zetian]] seized the throne, proclaiming the [[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Wu Zhou dynasty]] and becoming the only legitimate Chinese [[empress regnant]]. In two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries, the Tang records estimated the population by number of registered households at about 50 million people.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p= 91}}{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|pp= 111, 141}}  Yet, even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century, it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people.{{sfn|Du|1998|p= 37}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p= 106}}{{efn|During the rule of the Tang the world population grew from about 190 million to approximately 240&nbsp;million, a difference of 50&nbsp;million. See also [[medieval demography]].}}  With its large population base, the dynasty was able to raise professional and conscripted armies of hundreds of thousands of troops to contend with nomadic powers in dominating [[Inner Asia]] and the lucrative trade-routes along the [[Silk Road]].  [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|Various kingdoms and states paid tribute]] to the Tang court, while the Tang also conquered or subdued several regions which it indirectly controlled through a [[protectorate]] system.  Besides political [[hegemony]], the Tang also exerted a powerful cultural influence over neighboring [[East Asia]]n states such as those in [[History of Japan#Classical Japan|Japan]] and [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Korea]].\n\nThe Tang dynasty was largely a period of progress and stability in the first half of the dynasty's rule, until the devastating [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (755\u2013763) and the decline of central authority in the later half of the dynasty. Like the previous [[Sui dynasty]], the Tang dynasty maintained a civil-service system by recruiting [[scholar-official]]s through [[Imperial examination|standardized examinations]] and recommendations to office.  The rise of regional military governors known as ''[[jiedushi]]'' during the 9th century undermined this civil order.  [[Chinese culture]] flourished and further matured during the Tang era; it is traditionally considered the greatest age for [[Chinese poetry]].{{sfn|Yu|1998|pp= 73\u201387}}  Two of China's most famous poets, [[Li Bai]] and [[Du Fu]], belonged to this age, as did many famous painters such as [[Han Gan]], [[Zhang Xuan]], and [[Zhou Fang (Tang dynasty)|Zhou Fang]].  Scholars of this period compiled a rich variety of [[Chinese historiography|historical literature]], as well as encyclopedias and geographical works. The adoption of the title [[Khan of Heaven]] by the Tang emperor [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Taizong]] in addition to his title as [[Emperor of China|emperor]] was eastern Asia's first \"simultaneous kingship\".{{sfn|Skaff|2012|p= 127}}\n\nMany notable innovations occurred under the Tang, including the development of [[woodblock printing]]. [[Buddhism]] became a major influence in Chinese culture, with [[Chinese Buddhism|native Chinese sects]] gaining prominence. However, in the 840s the [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang]] [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|enacted policies to persecute Buddhism]], which subsequently declined in influence. The dynasty and central government had gone into decline by the latter half of the 9th century; agrarian rebellions resulted in damaging atrocities such as the [[Guangzhou massacre]] of 878\u2013879.

After a series of rebellions between 781 and 784 in today's Hebei, [[Shandong]], Hubei and [[Henan]] provinces, the government had to officially acknowledge the jiedushi's hereditary ruling without accreditation. The Tang government relied on these governors and their armies for protection and to suppress locals that would take up arms against the government.

These had their own signature and that of a witness and scribe in order to prove in court (if necessary) that their claim to property was legitimate. The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han dynasty, while contractual language became even more common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=59}}\n\nThe center of the political power of the Tang was the capital city of [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]), where the emperor maintained his large palace quarters and entertained political emissaries with music, sports, [[Acrobatics|acrobatic]] stunts, poetry, paintings, and [[Pear Garden|dramatic theater performances]]. The capital was also filled with incredible amounts of riches and resources to spare. When the Chinese [[prefecture|prefectural]] government officials traveled to the capital in the year 643 to give the annual report of the affairs in their districts, Emperor Taizong discovered that many had no proper quarters to rest in and were renting rooms with merchants. Therefore, Emperor Taizong ordered the government agencies in charge of [[Township|municipal]] construction to build every visiting official his own private [[mansion]] in the capital.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=59}}\n\n===Imperial examinations===\n{{Main|Imperial examination}}\n{{Further|Imperial examination in Chinese mythology}}\n\n[[File:Civilserviceexam1.jpg|thumb|left|Civil service exam candidates gather around the wall where results had been posted.

But perhaps an even greater consideration for the Tang rulers, aware that imperial dependence on powerful aristocratic families and [[warlord]]s would have destabilizing consequences, was to create a body of career officials having no autonomous territorial or functional [[Base (politics)|power base]]. The Tang law code ensured equal division of inherited property amongst legitimate heirs, allowing a bit of [[social mobility]] and preventing the families of powerful court officials from becoming [[landed nobility]] through [[primogeniture]].{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=83}} As it turned out, these scholar-officials acquired status in their local communities and in family ties, while they also shared values that connected them to the imperial court. From Tang times until the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912, [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-officials]] functioned often as intermediaries between the [[grassroots]] level and the government. Yet the potential of a widespread examination system was not fully realized until the Song dynasty, when the merit-driven scholar official largely shed his aristocratic habits and defined his social status through the examination system.{{sfn |Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=159}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=95}}{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=54}} As historian Patricia Ebrey states of the Song period scholar-officials:\n{{quote|The examination system, used only on a small scale in Sui and Tang times, played a central role in the fashioning of this new elite.

In his bid for power, Li Yuan had attracted a following by claiming descent from the [[Taoism|Daoist]] sage [[Laozi]] ({{floruit}}&nbsp;6th century&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}).{{sfn|Graff|2000|p=79}} People bidding for office would have monks from Buddhist temples pray for them in public in return for cash donations or gifts if the person was selected. Before the persecution of Buddhism in the 9th century, Buddhism and Daoism were accepted side by side, and [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] (r. 712\u2013756) invited monks and clerics of both religions to his court. At the same time Xuanzong exalted the ancient Laozi by granting him grand titles, wrote commentary on the Daoist ''Laozi'', set up a school to prepare candidates for examinations on Daoist scriptures, and called upon the Indian monk [[Vajrabodhi]] (671\u2013741) to perform [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] rites to avert a drought in the year 726. In 742 Emperor Xuanzong personally held the incense burner during a ceremony led by [[Amoghavajra]] (705\u2013774, patriarch of the [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon school]]) reciting \"mystical incantations to secure the victory of Tang forces.\"{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=99}}\n\nWhile religion played a role in politics, politics also played a role in religion. In the year 714, Emperor Xuanzong forbade shops and vendors in the city of Chang'an to sell copied Buddhist sutras, instead giving the Buddhist clergy of the monasteries the sole right to distribute sutras to the [[laity]].{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=57}} In the previous year of 713, Emperor Xuanzong had liquidated the highly lucrative [[Chang'an#Northwestern Chang'an|Inexhaustible Treasury]], which was run by a prominent Buddhist monastery in Chang'an. This monastery collected vast amounts of money, silk, and treasures through multitudes of anonymous people's repentances, leaving the donations on the monastery's premise. Although the monastery was generous in donations, Emperor Xuanzong issued a decree abolishing their treasury on grounds that their [[History of banking in China|banking]] practices were fraudulent, collected their riches, and distributed the wealth to various other Buddhist monasteries and Daoist abbeys, and to repair statues, halls, and bridges in the city.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=61}}\n\n===Taxes and the census===\n\nThe Tang dynasty government attempted to create an accurate census of the size of their empire's population, mostly for effective taxation and matters of military conscription for each region. The early Tang government established both the grain tax and cloth tax at a relatively low rate for each household under the empire. This was meant to encourage households to enroll for taxation and not avoid the authorities, thus providing the government with the most accurate estimate possible.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} In the census of 609, the population was tallied by efforts of the government at a size of 9 million households, or about 50&nbsp;million people.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} The Tang census of 742 again approximated the size of China's population at about 50&nbsp;million people.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=141}} Patricia Ebrey writes that even if a rather significant number of people had avoided the registration process of the tax census, the population size during the Tang had not grown significantly since the earlier Han dynasty (the [[History of the Han dynasty|census of the year 2]] recording a population of roughly 58 million people in China).{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}}{{sfn|Nishijima|1986|pp=595\u2013596}} S.A.M. Adshead disagrees, estimating that there were about 75 million people by 750.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=72}}\n\nIn the Tang census of the year 754, there were 1,859 cities, 321 [[Prefecture (China)|prefectures]], and 1,538 [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|counties]] throughout the empire.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=45}} Although there were many large and prominent cities during the Tang, the rural and agrarian areas comprised the majority of China's population at some 80 to 90%.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=32}} There was also a dramatic migratory shift of the population from [[Northern and southern China|northern to southern China]], as the North held 75% of the overall population at the dynasty's inception, but by its end was reduced to 50%.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=75}}\n\nChinese population size would not dramatically increase until the Song dynasty period, when the population doubled to 100 million people because of extensive rice cultivation in central and southern China, coupled with rural farmers holding more abundant yields of food that they could easily provide to the growing market.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=156}}\n\n==Military and foreign policy==\n{{main|Military history of the Sui\u2013Tang dynasties|Naval history of China|Jimi system}}\n{{Further|Imperial Guards (Tang dynasty)}}\n\n[[File:Emperor Taizong gives an audience to the ambassador of Tibet.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]] (r. 626\u2013649) receives [[Gar Tongtsen Y\u00fclsung]], ambassador of the [[Tibetan Empire]], at his court; [[Emperor Taizong Receiving the Tibetan Envoy|later copy]] of an original painted in 641 by [[Yan Liben]] (600\u2013673)]]\n\n===Protectorates and tributaries===\n\nThe 7th and first half of the 8th century are generally considered to be the era in which the Tang reached the zenith of its power. In this period, Tang control extended further west than any previous dynasty, stretching from north Vietnam in the south, to a point north of [[Kashmir]] bordering Persia in the west, to northern Korea in the north-east.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=xii, 4}}\n\nSome of the kingdoms paying tribute to the Tang dynasty included [[Kashmir region|Kashmir]], Nepal, [[Khotan]], [[Kucha]], [[Kashgar]], [[Silla]], [[Champa]], and kingdoms located in [[Amu Darya]] and [[Syr Darya]] valley.{{sfn|Whitfield|2004|p=47}}{{sfn|Twitchett|2000|pp=116\u2013118}} Turkic nomads addressed the Emperor of Tang China as ''[[Tian Kehan]]''.{{sfn|Twitchett|2000|p=124}} After the widespread G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk revolt of [[Shabol\u00fce Khan]] (d. 658) was put down at [[Issyk Kul]] in 657 by [[Su Dingfang]] (591\u2013667), Emperor Gaozong established several protectorates governed by a Protectorate General or Grand Protectorate General, which extended the Chinese [[sphere of influence]] as far as [[Herat]] in Western Afghanistan.{{sfn|Twitchett|2000|pp=118, 122}} Protectorate Generals were given a great deal of autonomy to handle local crises without waiting for central admission. After Xuanzong's reign, military governors (jiedushi) were given enormous power, including the ability to maintain their own armies, collect taxes, and pass their titles on hereditarily. This is commonly recognized as the beginning of the fall of Tang's central government.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}}{{sfn|Wang|2003|p=91}}\n\n[[File:Tang Pottery Warrior.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Tang dynasty tomb figures|Pottery tomb figure]] of a warrior from Duan's Tomb, [[Shaanxi]].]]\n\n===Soldiers and conscription===\n\nBy the year 737, Emperor Xuanzong discarded the policy of conscripting soldiers that were replaced every three years, replacing them with long-service soldiers who were more battle-hardened and efficient. It was more economically feasible as well, since training new recruits and sending them out to the frontier every three years drained the treasury.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=9}} By the late 7th century, the ''[[Fubing system|fubing]]'' troops began abandoning military service and the homes provided to them in the equal-field system. The supposed standard of 100 ''[[Mu (unit of area)|mu]]'' of land allotted to each family was in fact decreasing in size in places where population expanded and the wealthy bought up most of the land.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=208}} Hard-pressed peasants and vagrants were then induced into military service with benefits of exemption from both taxation and corv\u00e9e labor service, as well as provisions for farmland and dwellings for dependents who accompanied soldiers on the frontier.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=209}} By the year 742 the total number of enlisted troops in the Tang armies had risen to about 500,000 men.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=9}}\n\n===Eastern regions===\n{{See also|Protectorate General to Pacify the East}}\n\nIn East Asia, Tang Chinese military campaigns were less successful elsewhere than in previous imperial Chinese dynasties.

[[Silla\u2013Tang alliance|Allying with the Korean Silla Kingdom]], the Chinese fought against [[Baekje]] and their [[Kofun period|Yamato Japanese]] allies in the [[Battle of Baekgang]] in August 663, a decisive Tang\u2013Silla victory.

In another joint invasion with Silla, the Tang army severely weakened the Goguryeo Kingdom in the north by taking out its outer forts in the year 645. With joint attacks by Silla and Tang armies under commander [[Li Shiji]] (594\u2013669), the Kingdom of Goguryeo was destroyed by 668.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=4}}\n\n[[File:Mogao Cave 61, painting of Mount Wutai monasteries.jpg|thumb|A 10th-century mural painting in the [[Mogao Caves]] at [[Dunhuang]] showing monastic architecture from [[Mount Wutai]], Tang dynasty; [[Japanese architecture]] of this period was influenced by Tang Chinese architecture]]\n\nAlthough they were formerly enemies, the Tang accepted officials and generals of Goguryeo into their administration and military, such as the brothers [[Yeon Namsaeng]] (634\u2013679) and [[Yeon Namsan]] (639\u2013701). From 668 to 676, the Tang Empire would control northern Korea. However, in 671 Silla broke the alliance and began the [[Silla\u2013Tang War]] to expel the Tang forces.

With a population of about a million, Luoyang became the second largest city in the empire, and with its close proximity to the Luo River it benefited from southern agricultural fertility and trade traffic of the Grand Canal. However, the Tang court eventually demoted its capital status and did not visit Luoyang after the year 743, when Chang'an's problem of acquiring adequate supplies and stores for the year was solved.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=46}} As early as 736, granaries were built at critical points along the route from Yangzhou to Chang'an, which eliminated shipment delays, spoilage, and pilfering.{{sfn|Schafer|1985|pp=18\u201319}} An artificial lake used as a transshipment pool was dredged east of Chang'an in 743, where curious northerners could finally see the array of boats found in southern China, delivering tax and tribute items to the imperial court.{{sfn|Schafer|1985|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n===Literature===\n{{main|Chinese literature|Tang poetry}}\n\n[[File:\"Lan-ting Xu\" Preface to the Poems Composed at the Orchid Pavilion, copy by an artist in the Tang dynasty - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|A Tang dynasty era copy of the preface to the ''[[Lantingji Xu]]'' poems composed at the [[Orchid Pavilion Gathering]], originally attributed to [[Wang Xizhi]] (303\u2013361 AD) of the [[Jin dynasty (265-420)|Jin dynasty]]]]\n\n[[File:LiBai-Kalligraphie.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A poem by [[Li Bai]] (701\u2013762 AD), the only surviving example of Li Bai's [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]], housed in the [[Collections of the Palace Museum|Palace Museum]] in Beijing.]]\n\nThe Tang period was a [[golden age]] of Chinese literature and [[Chinese art|art]].

''Jintishi'' poetry, or regulated verse, is in the form of eight-line [[stanza]]s or seven [[Chinese characters|characters]] per line with a fixed pattern of tones that required the second and third couplets to be antithetical (although the [[antithesis]] is often lost in translation to other languages).{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=102}} Tang poems remained popular and great emulation of Tang era poetry began in the Song dynasty; in that period, Yan Yu (\u56b4\u7fbd; active 1194\u20131245) was the first to confer the poetry of the High Tang (c. 713\u2013766) era with \"canonical status within the classical poetic tradition.\" Yan Yu reserved the position of highest esteem among all Tang poets for [[Du Fu]] (712\u2013770), who was not viewed as such in his own era, and was branded by his peers as an anti-traditional rebel.{{sfn|Yu|1998|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nThe [[Classical Prose Movement]] was spurred in large part by the writings of Tang authors [[Liu Zongyuan]] (773\u2013819) and [[Han Yu]] (768\u2013824). This new prose style broke away from the poetry tradition of the ''piantiwen'' ({{lang|zh|\u9a19\u9ad4\u6587}}, \"parallel prose\") style begun in the Han dynasty. Although writers of the Classical Prose Movement imitated ''piantiwen'', they criticized it for its often vague content and lack of colloquial language, focusing more on clarity and precision to make their writing more direct.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=106}} This ''guwen'' (archaic prose) style can be traced back to Han Yu, and would become largely associated with [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[Neo-Confucianism]].{{sfn|Huters|1987|p=52}}\n\nShort story fiction and tales were also popular during the Tang, one of the more famous ones being ''Yingying's Biography'' by [[Yuan Zhen]] (779\u2013831), which was widely circulated in his own time and by the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1279\u20131368) became the basis for plays in [[Chinese opera]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp=104\u2013105}}{{sfn|Wong|1979|p=97}} Timothy C.

The ''[[Shitong]]'' written by [[Liu Zhiji]] in 710 was a meta-history, as it covered the history of [[Chinese historiography]] in past centuries until his time. The ''[[Great Tang Records on the Western Regions]]'', compiled by [[Bianji]], recounted the journey of [[Xuanzang]], the Tang era's most renowned [[Buddhist monk]].\n\nOther important literary offerings included [[Duan Chengshi]]'s (d. 863) ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]'', an entertaining collection of foreign legends and hearsay, reports on natural phenomena, short [[anecdote]]s, mythical and mundane tales, as well as notes on various subjects.

The 8th-century author [[Lu Yu]] (known as the Sage of Tea) even wrote a treatise on the art of drinking tea, called ''[[The Classic of Tea]]''.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=95}} Although [[gift wrapping|wrapping paper]] had been used in China since the 2nd century BC,{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=122}} during the Tang dynasty the Chinese were using wrapping paper as folded and sewn square bags to hold and preserve the flavor of tea leaves.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=122}} Indeed, paper found many other uses besides writing and wrapping during the Tang era.\n\nEarlier, the first recorded use of [[toilet paper]] was made in 589 by the scholar-official [[Yan Zhitui]] (531\u2013591),{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=123}} and in 851 an [[Arabs|Arab]] Muslim traveler commented on how he believed the Tang era Chinese were not careful about cleanliness because they did not wash with water (as was his people's habit) when going to the bathroom; instead, he said, the Chinese simply used paper to wipe themselves.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=123}}\n\nIn ancient times, the Chinese had outlined the five most basic foodstuffs known as the five grains: [[sesamum]], [[legume]]s, wheat, [[panicle]]d [[millet]], and [[glutinous]] millet.{{sfn|Song|1966|pp=3\u20134}} The [[Ming dynasty]] [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedist]] [[Song Yingxing]] (1587\u20131666) noted that rice was not counted amongst the five grains from the time of the legendary and deified Chinese sage [[Shennong]] (the existence of whom Yingxing wrote was \"an uncertain matter\") into the 2nd millenniums BC, because the properly wet and humid climate in southern China for growing rice was not yet fully settled or cultivated by the Chinese.{{sfn|Song|1966|pp=3\u20134}} But Song Yingxing also noted that in the Ming dynasty, seven tenths of civilians' food was rice. In fact, in the Tang dynasty rice was not only the most important staple in southern China, but had also became popular in the north, which was for a long time the center of China.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tang Cuisine|last=Wang|first=Saishi|publisher=Qilu Publishing House|year=2003|isbn=978-7-5333-1174-2|location=Dongying, Shandong|pages=18}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dame Chine Guimet 291003.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|[[Tang dynasty tomb figures|Tomb figure]] of a lady attendant, 7th- to 8th-century; during the Tang era, female hosts prepared feasts, tea parties, and played drinking games with their guests.]]\n\nDuring the Tang dynasty, wheat replaced the position of millet and became the main staple crop.

Like the Rougamo in modern Chinese cuisine, steamed cake was usually stuffed by meat and vegetable. There were plenty of shops and packmen selling steamed cake in Chang\u2019an, and its price was also far from expensive.

The definition here was very broad, including current day wonton, noodles, and many other kinds of food that soak wheat in water. Consuming boiled cake was treated as an effective and popular way of diet therapy. While aristocrats favored wonton, civilians usually consumed noodles and noodle slice soup, because the process to make wonton was heavy and complicated.<ref name=\"Wang 2003 6\">{{Cite book|title=Tang Cuisine|last=Wang|first=Saishi|publisher=Qilu Publisher House|year=2003|isbn=978-7-5333-1174-2|location=Dongying|pages=6}}</ref>\n\nPancake was hard to find in China before the Tang.

The common people used simple methods of preservation, such as digging deep ditches and trenches, [[brining]], and salting their foods.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=126\u2013127}} The emperor had large ice pits located in the parks in and around Chang'an for preserving food, while the wealthy and elite had their own smaller ice pits.

Previous advancements in clockworks and timekeeping included the mechanical gear systems of [[Zhang Heng]] (78\u2013139) and [[Ma Jun]] (fl. 3rd century), which gave the Tang mathematician, mechanical engineer, astronomer, and monk [[Yi Xing]] (683\u2013727) inspiration when he invented the world's first clockwork [[escapement]] mechanism in 725.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=319}} This was used alongside a [[Water clock|clepsydra]] clock and [[waterwheel]] to power a rotating [[armillary sphere]] in representation of [[astronomical]] observation.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=473\u2013475}} Yi Xing's device also had a mechanically timed bell that was struck automatically every hour, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter-hour; essentially, a [[striking clock]].{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=473\u2013474}} Yi Xing's [[astronomical clock]] and water-powered armillary sphere became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to write an essay on the device as an exam requirement.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=475}} However, the most common type of public and palace timekeeping device was the inflow clepsydra. Its design was improved c. 610 by the Sui-dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai. They provided a [[steelyard balance]] that allowed seasonal adjustment in the [[pressure head]] of the compensating tank and could then control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=480}}\n\nThere were many other mechanical inventions during the Tang era. These included a 3&nbsp;ft (0.91&nbsp;m) tall mechanical wine server of the early 8th century that was in the shape of an artificial mountain, carved out of iron and rested on a [[lacquer]]ed-wooden tortoise frame. This intricate device used a hydraulic pump that siphoned wine out of metal [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]-headed faucets, as well as tilting bowls that were timed to dip wine down, by force of [[gravity]] when filled, into an artificial lake that had intricate iron leaves popping up as trays for placing party treats.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=144}} Furthermore, as the historian Charles Benn describes it:\n\n{{Quote|Midway up the southern side of the mountain was a dragon\u2026the beast opened its mouth and spit brew into a goblet seated on a large [iron] lotus leaf beneath. When the cup was 80% full, the dragon ceased spewing ale, and a guest immediately seized the goblet. If he was slow in draining the cup and returning it to the leaf, the door of a pavilion at the top of the mountain opened and a mechanical wine server, dressed in a cap and gown, emerged with a wooden bat in his hand. As soon as the guest returned the goblet, the dragon refilled it, the wine server withdrew, and the doors of the pavilion closed\u2026A pump siphoned the ale that flowed into the ale pool through a hidden hole and returned the brew to the reservoir [holding more than 16 quarts/15 liters of wine] inside the mountain.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=144}}}}\n\nYet the use of a teasing mechanical puppet in this wine-serving device wasn't exactly a novel invention of the Tang, since the use of mechanical puppets in China date back to the [[Qin dynasty]] (221\u2013207 BC). In the 3rd century [[Ma Jun]] had an entire mechanical puppet theater operated by the rotation of a waterwheel.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=158}} There was also an automatic wine-server known in the ancient [[Greco-Roman]] world, a design of the Greek inventor [[Heron of Alexandria]] that employed an urn with an inner valve and a lever device similar to the one described above. There are many stories of [[automaton]]s used in the Tang, including general Yang Wulian's wooden statue of a monk who stretched his hands out to collect contributions; when the amount of coins reached a certain weight, the mechanical figure moved his arms to deposit them in a satchel.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163}} This weight-and-lever mechanism was exactly like Heron's penny [[slot machine]].{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163 footnote c}} Other devices included one by Wang Ju, whose \"wooden otter\" could allegedly catch fish; Needham suspects a [[Spring (device)|spring trap]] of some kind was employed here.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163}}\n\nIn the realm of structural engineering and technical [[Chinese architecture]], there were also government standard building codes, outlined in the early Tang book of the ''Yingshan Ling'' (National Building Law).{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=1}} Fragments of this book have survived in the ''Tang L\u00fc'' (The Tang Code),{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=3}} while the Song dynasty architectural manual of the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'' (State Building Standards) by [[Architecture of the Song dynasty#Literature|Li Jie]] (1065\u20131101) in 1103 is the oldest existing technical treatise on Chinese architecture that has survived in full.{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=1}} During the reign of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] (712\u2013756) there were 34,850 registered [[Artisan|craftsmen]] serving the state, managed by the Agency of Palace Buildings (Jingzuo Jian).{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=3}}\n\n===Woodblock printing===\n{{Main|Woodblock printing|Playing cards|Chinese playing cards}}\n[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The [[Diamond Sutra]], printed in 868, is the world's first widely printed book to include a specific date of printing.]]\n\n[[Woodblock printing]] made the written word available to vastly greater audiences.

When the Tang chancellor [[Pei Ju]] (547\u2013627) was working for the Sui dynasty as a Commercial Commissioner in 605, he created a well-known gridded map with a [[Scale (map)|graduated scale]] in the tradition of [[Pei Xiu]] (224\u2013271).{{sfn|Needham|1986a|pp=538\u2013540, 543}} The Tang chancellor [[Xu Jingzong]] (592\u2013672) was also known for his map of China drawn in the year 658.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} In the year 785 the [[Emperor Dezong of Tang|Emperor Dezong]] had the geographer and cartographer [[Jia Dan]] (730\u2013805) complete a map of China and her former colonies in Central Asia.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} Upon its completion in 801, the map was 9.1&nbsp;m (30&nbsp;ft) in length and 10&nbsp;m (33&nbsp;ft) in height, mapped out on a grid scale of one inch equaling one hundred ''[[li (unit)|li]]'' (Chinese unit of measuring distance).{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} A Chinese map of 1137 is similar in complexity to the one made by Jia Dan, carved on a stone stele with a grid scale of 100 li.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=Plate LXXXI}} However, the only type of map that has survived from the Tang period are [[star chart]]s.

One of the surviving sources of the ''Old Book of Tang'', primarily covering up to 756, is the ''[[Tongdian]]'', which [[Du You]] presented to the emperor in 801. The Tang period was again placed into the enormous [[universal history]] text of the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', edited, compiled, and completed in 1084 by a team of scholars under the Song dynasty Chancellor [[Sima Guang]] (1019\u20131086). This historical text, written with three million [[Chinese characters]] in 294 volumes, covered the history of China from the beginning of the [[Warring States]] (403 BC) until the beginning of the Song dynasty (960).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China|History}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Chinese emperors family tree (middle)#Tang and Second Zhou Dynasties|The family tree of the Tang dynasty emperors]]\n* [[Di Renjie]]\n* [[Dongyi Protectorate]]\n* [[Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup]]\n* ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' (government newspaper for officials)\n* [[List of emperors of the Tang dynasty]]\n* [[List of tributaries of Imperial China]]\n* [[Nine Pinnacle Pagoda]]\n* [[Qianling Mausoleum]]\n* [[Tang dynasty in Inner Asia]]\n* [[Tang poetry]]\n* [[Taxation in premodern China]]\n* [[Wei Zheng]]\n* [[Yan Zhenqing]]\n* [[Yijing (monk)]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Works cited ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{citation |last=Adshead |first=S.A.M. |title = China in World History |edition=2nd |year=1995 |orig-year=1988 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] and St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-333-62132-5}}\n* {{citation |last=Adshead |first=S.A.M. |title = T'ang China: The Rise of the East in World History|year=2004|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4039-3456-7}}\n* {{citation |last=Andrew |first=Anita N. |last2=Rapp |first2=John A. |title=Autocracy and Cina's Rebel Founding Emperors: Comparing Chairman Mao and Ming Taizu |year=2000 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |location=Lanham |isbn=978-0-8476-9580-5}}\n* {{citation |last=Bai |first=Shouyi|authorlink=Bai Shouyi |title = A History of Chinese Muslim (Vol. 2)|year=2003|publisher=Zhonghua Book Company |location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-101-02890-4}}\n* {{citation |last=Ball |first=Warwick |authorlink=Warwick Ball |title = Rome in the East: Transformation of an Empire |edition=2nd |year=2016 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-72078-6}}\n* {{citation |last=Beckwith|first=Christopher I.|title=The Tibetan Empire in Central Asia|year=1987|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-691-02469-1}}\n* {{citation |last=Benn|first=Charles|title=China's Golden Age: Everyday Life in the Tang dynasty|year=2002|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-517665-0}}\n* {{Citation |last=Bernhardt|first=Kathryn|date=July 1995|title=The Inheritance Right of Daughters: the Song Anomaly?|journal=Modern China|pages=269\u2013309}}\n* {{citation |last=Bowman|first=John S.|title=Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture|year=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}\n* {{citation |last=Brook|first=Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Brook (historian)|title=The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China|year=1998|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-22154-3|title-link=The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China }}\n* {{citation |last=Chen|first=Yan|title=Maritime Silk Route and Chinese-Foreign Cultural Exchanges|year=2002|publisher=Peking University Press|location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-301-03029-5}}\n* {{citation |last=Cui|first=Mingde|title=The History of Chinese Heqin|year=2005|publisher=Renmin Chubanshe|location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-01-004828-4}}\n* {{cite book |title=Tang China and the Collapse of the Uighur Empire: A Documentary History |author-first=Michael R. |author-last=Drompp |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NB6DEdAxLOsC |series=Brill's Inner Asian Library |year=2004 |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-14129-2 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Drompp |first=Michael R. |authormask=3 |chapter=Late-Tang Foreign Relations: The Uyghur Crisis |title=Hawai'i Reader in Traditional Chinese Culture |editor1-last=Mair |editor1-first=Victor H. |editor2=Nancy S.

It was preceded by the [[Sui dynasty]] and followed by the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] in Chinese history. Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization, and a [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] of cosmopolitan culture.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p= 1}} Tang territory, acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers, rivaled that of the [[Han dynasty]]. The Tang capital at [[Chang'an]] (present-day [[Xi'an]]) was the most populous city in the world in its day.\n\nThe [[House of Li|L\u01d0 family]] ({{Lang-zh|c=\u674e|s=|t=|labels=no}}) founded the dynasty, seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire. The dynasty was interrupted for 15 years when Empress [[Wu Zetian]] seized the throne, proclaiming the [[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Wu Zhou dynasty]] and becoming the only legitimate Chinese [[empress regnant]]. In two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries, the Tang records estimated the population by number of registered households at about 50 million people.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p= 91}}{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|pp= 111, 141}}  Yet, even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century, it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people.{{sfn|Du|1998|p= 37}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p= 106}}{{efn|During the rule of the Tang the world population grew from about 190 million to approximately 240&nbsp;million, a difference of 50&nbsp;million. See also [[medieval demography]].}}  With its large population base, the dynasty was able to raise professional and conscripted armies of hundreds of thousands of troops to contend with nomadic powers in dominating [[Inner Asia]] and the lucrative trade-routes along the [[Silk Road]].  [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|Various kingdoms and states paid tribute]] to the Tang court, while the Tang also conquered or subdued several regions which it indirectly controlled through a [[protectorate]] system.  Besides political [[hegemony]], the Tang also exerted a powerful cultural influence over neighboring [[East Asia]]n states such as those in [[History of Japan#Classical Japan|Japan]] and [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Korea]].\n\nThe Tang dynasty was largely a period of progress and stability in the first half of the dynasty's rule, until the devastating [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (755\u2013763) and the decline of central authority in the later half of the dynasty. Like the previous [[Sui dynasty]], the Tang dynasty maintained a civil-service system by recruiting [[scholar-official]]s through [[Imperial examination|standardized examinations]] and recommendations to office.  The rise of regional military governors known as ''[[jiedushi]]'' during the 9th century undermined this civil order.  [[Chinese culture]] flourished and further matured during the Tang era; it is traditionally considered the greatest age for [[Chinese poetry]].{{sfn|Yu|1998|pp= 73\u201387}}  Two of China's most famous poets, [[Li Bai]] and [[Du Fu]], belonged to this age, as did many famous painters such as [[Han Gan]], [[Zhang Xuan]], and [[Zhou Fang (Tang dynasty)|Zhou Fang]].  Scholars of this period compiled a rich variety of [[Chinese historiography|historical literature]], as well as encyclopedias and geographical works. The adoption of the title [[Khan of Heaven]] by the Tang emperor [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Taizong]] in addition to his title as [[Emperor of China|emperor]] was eastern Asia's first \"simultaneous kingship\".{{sfn|Skaff|2012|p= 127}}\n\nMany notable innovations occurred under the Tang, including the development of [[woodblock printing]].

There were also six ministries ({{zh|t=\u90e8|hp=b\u00f9|links=no}}) under the administrations that implemented policy, each of which was assigned different tasks. These [[Three Departments and Six Ministries]] included the personnel administration, finance, rites, military, justice, and public works\u2014an administrative model which would last until the fall of the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644\u20131912).{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=78}}\n\nAlthough the founders of the Tang related to the glory of the earlier [[Han dynasty]] (3rd century&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}\u20133rd century&nbsp;{{sc|ad}}), the basis for much of their administrative organization was very similar to the previous [[Northern and Southern dynasties]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} The [[Northern Zhou]] (6th century) [[fubing system]] of divisional militia was continued by the Tang, along with farmer-soldiers serving in rotation from the capital or frontier in order to receive appropriated farmland. The [[equal-field system]] of the [[Northern Wei]] (4th\u20136th centuries) was also kept, although there were a few modifications.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}}\n\nAlthough the central and local governments kept an enormous number of records about land property in order to assess taxes, it became common practice in the Tang for literate and affluent people to create their own private documents and signed contracts. These had their own signature and that of a witness and scribe in order to prove in court (if necessary) that their claim to property was legitimate. The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han dynasty, while contractual language became even more common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=59}}\n\nThe center of the political power of the Tang was the capital city of [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]), where the emperor maintained his large palace quarters and entertained political emissaries with music, sports, [[Acrobatics|acrobatic]] stunts, poetry, paintings, and [[Pear Garden|dramatic theater performances]]. The capital was also filled with incredible amounts of riches and resources to spare. When the Chinese [[prefecture|prefectural]] government officials traveled to the capital in the year 643 to give the annual report of the affairs in their districts, Emperor Taizong discovered that many had no proper quarters to rest in and were renting rooms with merchants. Therefore, Emperor Taizong ordered the government agencies in charge of [[Township|municipal]] construction to build every visiting official his own private [[mansion]] in the capital.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=59}}\n\n===Imperial examinations===\n{{Main|Imperial examination}}\n{{Further|Imperial examination in Chinese mythology}}\n\n[[File:Civilserviceexam1.jpg|thumb|left|Civil service exam candidates gather around the wall where results had been posted. Artwork by [[Qiu Ying]].]]\n\nStudents of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] studies were potential candidates for the [[imperial examination]]s, the graduates of which could be appointed as state bureaucrats in the local, provincial, and central government. There were two types of exams that were given, ''mingjing'' ({{lang|zh|\u660e\u7d93}}; \"illuminating the classics\") and ''jinshi'' ({{lang|zh|\u9032\u58eb}}; \"presented scholar\").{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp = 91\u201392}} The ''mingjing'' was based upon the [[Chinese classic texts|Confucian classics]] and tested the student's knowledge of a broad variety of texts.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp=91\u201392}} The ''jinshi'' tested a student's literary abilities in writing essay-style responses to questions on matters of governance and politics, as well as their skills in composing [[Chinese poetry|poetry]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=92}} Candidates were also judged on their skills of deportment, appearance, speech, and level of skill in [[calligraphy]], all of which were subjective criteria that allowed the already wealthy members of society to be chosen over ones of more modest means who were unable to be educated in [[rhetoric]] or fanciful writing skills.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=97}} There was a disproportionate number of civil officials coming from aristocratic as opposed to non-aristocratic families.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=97}} The exams were open to all male subjects whose fathers were not of the [[Four occupations|artisan or merchant classes]],{{sfn|Gascoigne|Gascoigne|2003|p= 95}} although having wealth or noble status was not a prerequisite in receiving a recommendation.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=97}} In order to promote widespread Confucian education, the Tang government established state-run schools and issued standard versions of the [[Five Classics]] with selected commentaries.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p= 112}}\n\nThis competitive procedure was designed to draw the best talent into government. But perhaps an even greater consideration for the Tang rulers, aware that imperial dependence on powerful aristocratic families and [[warlord]]s would have destabilizing consequences, was to create a body of career officials having no autonomous territorial or functional [[Base (politics)|power base]]. The Tang law code ensured equal division of inherited property amongst legitimate heirs, allowing a bit of [[social mobility]] and preventing the families of powerful court officials from becoming [[landed nobility]] through [[primogeniture]].{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=83}} As it turned out, these scholar-officials acquired status in their local communities and in family ties, while they also shared values that connected them to the imperial court. From Tang times until the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912, [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-officials]] functioned often as intermediaries between the [[grassroots]] level and the government. Yet the potential of a widespread examination system was not fully realized until the Song dynasty, when the merit-driven scholar official largely shed his aristocratic habits and defined his social status through the examination system.{{sfn |Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=159}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=95}}{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=54}} As historian Patricia Ebrey states of the Song period scholar-officials:\n{{quote|The examination system, used only on a small scale in Sui and Tang times, played a central role in the fashioning of this new elite.

In his bid for power, Li Yuan had attracted a following by claiming descent from the [[Taoism|Daoist]] sage [[Laozi]] ({{floruit}}&nbsp;6th century&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}).{{sfn|Graff|2000|p=79}} People bidding for office would have monks from Buddhist temples pray for them in public in return for cash donations or gifts if the person was selected. Before the persecution of Buddhism in the 9th century, Buddhism and Daoism were accepted side by side, and [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] (r. 712\u2013756) invited monks and clerics of both religions to his court. At the same time Xuanzong exalted the ancient Laozi by granting him grand titles, wrote commentary on the Daoist ''Laozi'', set up a school to prepare candidates for examinations on Daoist scriptures, and called upon the Indian monk [[Vajrabodhi]] (671\u2013741) to perform [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] rites to avert a drought in the year 726. In 742 Emperor Xuanzong personally held the incense burner during a ceremony led by [[Amoghavajra]] (705\u2013774, patriarch of the [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon school]]) reciting \"mystical incantations to secure the victory of Tang forces.\"{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=99}}\n\nWhile religion played a role in politics, politics also played a role in religion. In the year 714, Emperor Xuanzong forbade shops and vendors in the city of Chang'an to sell copied Buddhist sutras, instead giving the Buddhist clergy of the monasteries the sole right to distribute sutras to the [[laity]].{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=57}} In the previous year of 713, Emperor Xuanzong had liquidated the highly lucrative [[Chang'an#Northwestern Chang'an|Inexhaustible Treasury]], which was run by a prominent Buddhist monastery in Chang'an. This monastery collected vast amounts of money, silk, and treasures through multitudes of anonymous people's repentances, leaving the donations on the monastery's premise. Although the monastery was generous in donations, Emperor Xuanzong issued a decree abolishing their treasury on grounds that their [[History of banking in China|banking]] practices were fraudulent, collected their riches, and distributed the wealth to various other Buddhist monasteries and Daoist abbeys, and to repair statues, halls, and bridges in the city.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=61}}\n\n===Taxes and the census===\n\nThe Tang dynasty government attempted to create an accurate census of the size of their empire's population, mostly for effective taxation and matters of military conscription for each region. The early Tang government established both the grain tax and cloth tax at a relatively low rate for each household under the empire. This was meant to encourage households to enroll for taxation and not avoid the authorities, thus providing the government with the most accurate estimate possible.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} In the census of 609, the population was tallied by efforts of the government at a size of 9 million households, or about 50&nbsp;million people.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} The Tang census of 742 again approximated the size of China's population at about 50&nbsp;million people.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=141}} Patricia Ebrey writes that even if a rather significant number of people had avoided the registration process of the tax census, the population size during the Tang had not grown significantly since the earlier Han dynasty (the [[History of the Han dynasty|census of the year 2]] recording a population of roughly 58 million people in China).{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}}{{sfn|Nishijima|1986|pp=595\u2013596}} S.A.M. Adshead disagrees, estimating that there were about 75 million people by 750.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=72}}\n\nIn the Tang census of the year 754, there were 1,859 cities, 321 [[Prefecture (China)|prefectures]], and 1,538 [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|counties]] throughout the empire.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=45}} Although there were many large and prominent cities during the Tang, the rural and agrarian areas comprised the majority of China's population at some 80 to 90%.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=32}} There was also a dramatic migratory shift of the population from [[Northern and southern China|northern to southern China]], as the North held 75% of the overall population at the dynasty's inception, but by its end was reduced to 50%.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=75}}\n\nChinese population size would not dramatically increase until the Song dynasty period, when the population doubled to 100 million people because of extensive rice cultivation in central and southern China, coupled with rural farmers holding more abundant yields of food that they could easily provide to the growing market.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=156}}\n\n==Military and foreign policy==\n{{main|Military history of the Sui\u2013Tang dynasties|Naval history of China|Jimi system}}\n{{Further|Imperial Guards (Tang dynasty)}}\n\n[[File:Emperor Taizong gives an audience to the ambassador of Tibet.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]] (r. 626\u2013649) receives [[Gar Tongtsen Y\u00fclsung]], ambassador of the [[Tibetan Empire]], at his court; [[Emperor Taizong Receiving the Tibetan Envoy|later copy]] of an original painted in 641 by [[Yan Liben]] (600\u2013673)]]\n\n===Protectorates and tributaries===\n\nThe 7th and first half of the 8th century are generally considered to be the era in which the Tang reached the zenith of its power.

After Xuanzong's reign, military governors (jiedushi) were given enormous power, including the ability to maintain their own armies, collect taxes, and pass their titles on hereditarily. This is commonly recognized as the beginning of the fall of Tang's central government.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}}{{sfn|Wang|2003|p=91}}\n\n[[File:Tang Pottery Warrior.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Tang dynasty tomb figures|Pottery tomb figure]] of a warrior from Duan's Tomb, [[Shaanxi]].]]\n\n===Soldiers and conscription===\n\nBy the year 737, Emperor Xuanzong discarded the policy of conscripting soldiers that were replaced every three years, replacing them with long-service soldiers who were more battle-hardened and efficient. It was more economically feasible as well, since training new recruits and sending them out to the frontier every three years drained the treasury.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=9}} By the late 7th century, the ''[[Fubing system|fubing]]'' troops began abandoning military service and the homes provided to them in the equal-field system.

In another joint invasion with Silla, the Tang army severely weakened the Goguryeo Kingdom in the north by taking out its outer forts in the year 645.

From 668 to 676, the Tang Empire would control northern Korea. However, in 671 Silla broke the alliance and began the [[Silla\u2013Tang War]] to expel the Tang forces.

The poet [[Lu Tong]] (790\u2013835) devoted most of his poetry to his love of tea. The 8th-century author [[Lu Yu]] (known as the Sage of Tea) even wrote a treatise on the art of drinking tea, called ''[[The Classic of Tea]]''.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=95}} Although [[gift wrapping|wrapping paper]] had been used in China since the 2nd century BC,{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=122}} during the Tang dynasty the Chinese were using wrapping paper as folded and sewn square bags to hold and preserve the flavor of tea leaves.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=122}} Indeed, paper found many other uses besides writing and wrapping during the Tang era.\n\nEarlier, the first recorded use of [[toilet paper]] was made in 589 by the scholar-official [[Yan Zhitui]] (531\u2013591),{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=123}} and in 851 an [[Arabs|Arab]] Muslim traveler commented on how he believed the Tang era Chinese were not careful about cleanliness because they did not wash with water (as was his people's habit) when going to the bathroom; instead, he said, the Chinese simply used paper to wipe themselves.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=123}}\n\nIn ancient times, the Chinese had outlined the five most basic foodstuffs known as the five grains: [[sesamum]], [[legume]]s, wheat, [[panicle]]d [[millet]], and [[glutinous]] millet.{{sfn|Song|1966|pp=3\u20134}} The [[Ming dynasty]] [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedist]] [[Song Yingxing]] (1587\u20131666) noted that rice was not counted amongst the five grains from the time of the legendary and deified Chinese sage [[Shennong]] (the existence of whom Yingxing wrote was \"an uncertain matter\") into the 2nd millenniums BC, because the properly wet and humid climate in southern China for growing rice was not yet fully settled or cultivated by the Chinese.{{sfn|Song|1966|pp=3\u20134}} But Song Yingxing also noted that in the Ming dynasty, seven tenths of civilians' food was rice.

Like the Rougamo in modern Chinese cuisine, steamed cake was usually stuffed by meat and vegetable. There were plenty of shops and packmen selling steamed cake in Chang\u2019an, and its price was also far from expensive.

The definition here was very broad, including current day wonton, noodles, and many other kinds of food that soak wheat in water. Consuming boiled cake was treated as an effective and popular way of diet therapy.

Previous advancements in clockworks and timekeeping included the mechanical gear systems of [[Zhang Heng]] (78\u2013139) and [[Ma Jun]] (fl. 3rd century), which gave the Tang mathematician, mechanical engineer, astronomer, and monk [[Yi Xing]] (683\u2013727) inspiration when he invented the world's first clockwork [[escapement]] mechanism in 725.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=319}} This was used alongside a [[Water clock|clepsydra]] clock and [[waterwheel]] to power a rotating [[armillary sphere]] in representation of [[astronomical]] observation.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=473\u2013475}} Yi Xing's device also had a mechanically timed bell that was struck automatically every hour, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter-hour; essentially, a [[striking clock]].{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=473\u2013474}} Yi Xing's [[astronomical clock]] and water-powered armillary sphere became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to write an essay on the device as an exam requirement.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=475}} However, the most common type of public and palace timekeeping device was the inflow clepsydra. Its design was improved c. 610 by the Sui-dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai. They provided a [[steelyard balance]] that allowed seasonal adjustment in the [[pressure head]] of the compensating tank and could then control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=480}}\n\nThere were many other mechanical inventions during the Tang era. These included a 3&nbsp;ft (0.91&nbsp;m) tall mechanical wine server of the early 8th century that was in the shape of an artificial mountain, carved out of iron and rested on a [[lacquer]]ed-wooden tortoise frame. This intricate device used a hydraulic pump that siphoned wine out of metal [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]-headed faucets, as well as tilting bowls that were timed to dip wine down, by force of [[gravity]] when filled, into an artificial lake that had intricate iron leaves popping up as trays for placing party treats.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=144}} Furthermore, as the historian Charles Benn describes it:\n\n{{Quote|Midway up the southern side of the mountain was a dragon\u2026the beast opened its mouth and spit brew into a goblet seated on a large [iron] lotus leaf beneath. When the cup was 80% full, the dragon ceased spewing ale, and a guest immediately seized the goblet. If he was slow in draining the cup and returning it to the leaf, the door of a pavilion at the top of the mountain opened and a mechanical wine server, dressed in a cap and gown, emerged with a wooden bat in his hand. As soon as the guest returned the goblet, the dragon refilled it, the wine server withdrew, and the doors of the pavilion closed\u2026A pump siphoned the ale that flowed into the ale pool through a hidden hole and returned the brew to the reservoir [holding more than 16 quarts/15 liters of wine] inside the mountain.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=144}}}}\n\nYet the use of a teasing mechanical puppet in this wine-serving device wasn't exactly a novel invention of the Tang, since the use of mechanical puppets in China date back to the [[Qin dynasty]] (221\u2013207 BC). In the 3rd century [[Ma Jun]] had an entire mechanical puppet theater operated by the rotation of a waterwheel.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=158}} There was also an automatic wine-server known in the ancient [[Greco-Roman]] world, a design of the Greek inventor [[Heron of Alexandria]] that employed an urn with an inner valve and a lever device similar to the one described above. There are many stories of [[automaton]]s used in the Tang, including general Yang Wulian's wooden statue of a monk who stretched his hands out to collect contributions; when the amount of coins reached a certain weight, the mechanical figure moved his arms to deposit them in a satchel.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163}} This weight-and-lever mechanism was exactly like Heron's penny [[slot machine]].{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163 footnote c}} Other devices included one by Wang Ju, whose \"wooden otter\" could allegedly catch fish; Needham suspects a [[Spring (device)|spring trap]] of some kind was employed here.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163}}\n\nIn the realm of structural engineering and technical [[Chinese architecture]], there were also government standard building codes, outlined in the early Tang book of the ''Yingshan Ling'' (National Building Law).{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=1}} Fragments of this book have survived in the ''Tang L\u00fc'' (The Tang Code),{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=3}} while the Song dynasty architectural manual of the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'' (State Building Standards) by [[Architecture of the Song dynasty#Literature|Li Jie]] (1065\u20131101) in 1103 is the oldest existing technical treatise on Chinese architecture that has survived in full.{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=1}} During the reign of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] (712\u2013756) there were 34,850 registered [[Artisan|craftsmen]] serving the state, managed by the Agency of Palace Buildings (Jingzuo Jian).{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=3}}\n\n===Woodblock printing===\n{{Main|Woodblock printing|Playing cards|Chinese playing cards}}\n[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The [[Diamond Sutra]], printed in 868, is the world's first widely printed book to include a specific date of printing.]]\n\n[[Woodblock printing]] made the written word available to vastly greater audiences.

When the Tang chancellor [[Pei Ju]] (547\u2013627) was working for the Sui dynasty as a Commercial Commissioner in 605, he created a well-known gridded map with a [[Scale (map)|graduated scale]] in the tradition of [[Pei Xiu]] (224\u2013271).{{sfn|Needham|1986a|pp=538\u2013540, 543}} The Tang chancellor [[Xu Jingzong]] (592\u2013672) was also known for his map of China drawn in the year 658.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} In the year 785 the [[Emperor Dezong of Tang|Emperor Dezong]] had the geographer and cartographer [[Jia Dan]] (730\u2013805) complete a map of China and her former colonies in Central Asia.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} Upon its completion in 801, the map was 9.1&nbsp;m (30&nbsp;ft) in length and 10&nbsp;m (33&nbsp;ft) in height, mapped out on a grid scale of one inch equaling one hundred ''[[li (unit)|li]]'' (Chinese unit of measuring distance).{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} A Chinese map of 1137 is similar in complexity to the one made by Jia Dan, carved on a stone stele with a grid scale of 100 li.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=Plate LXXXI}} However, the only type of map that has survived from the Tang period are [[star chart]]s. Despite this, [[Chinese cartography|the earliest extant terrain maps of China]] come from the ancient [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]]; maps from the 4th century BC that were excavated in 1986.{{sfn|Hsu|1993|p=90}}\n\n===Medicine===\nThe Chinese of the Tang era were also very interested in the benefits of officially classifying all of the [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medicines]] used in [[pharmacology]]. In 657, [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]] (r. 649\u2013683) commissioned the literary project of publishing an official ''[[materia medica]]'', complete with text and illustrated drawings for 833 different medicinal substances taken from different stones, minerals, metals, plants, herbs, animals, vegetables, fruits, and cereal crops.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=235}} In addition to compiling pharmacopeias, the Tang fostered learning in medicine by upholding imperial medical colleges, state examinations for doctors, and publishing forensic manuals for physicians.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=83}} Authors of medicine in the Tang include Zhen Chuan (d. 643) and [[Sun Simiao]] (581\u2013682), the former who first identified in writing that patients with [[diabetes]] had an excess of sugar in their [[urine]], and the latter who was the first to recognize that diabetic patients should avoid consuming alcohol and [[starch]]y foods.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=132\u2013133}} As written by Zhen Chuan and others in the Tang, the [[thyroid]] glands of sheep and pigs were successfully used to treat [[goiter]]s; thyroid extracts were not used to treat patients with goiter in the West until 1890.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=134\u2013135}} The use of the [[Amalgam (dentistry)|dental amalgam]], manufactured from tin and silver, was first introduced in the medical text ''Xinxiu Bencao'' written by Su Gong in 659.<ref name=czarnetzki>{{cite journal|last=Czarnetzki|first=A.|author2=Ehrhardt S. |title=Re-dating the Chinese amalgam-filling of teeth in Europe|journal=International Journal of Anthropology|year=1990|volume=5|issue=4|pages=325\u2013332}}</ref>\n\n===Alchemy, gas cylinders, and air conditioning===\nChinese scientists of the Tang period employed complex chemical formulas for an array of different purposes, often found through experiments of [[alchemy]]. These included a [[waterproof]] and dust-repelling cream or [[varnish]] for clothes and weapons, [[fireproof]] cement for glass and porcelain wares, a waterproof cream applied to silk clothes of [[underwater diving|underwater divers]], a cream designated for polishing bronze mirrors, and many other useful formulas.{{sfn|Needham|1986e|p=452}} The vitrified, translucent ceramic known as [[porcelain]] was invented in China during the Tang, although many types of glazed ceramics preceded it.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=80}}{{sfn|Wood|1999|p=49}}\n\nEver since the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BC \u2013 220 AD), the Chinese had drilled deep [[borehole]]s to transport natural gas from [[Pipeline transport|bamboo pipelines]] to stoves where [[cast iron]] evaporation pans boiled [[brine]] to extract salt.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=78\u201379}} During the Tang dynasty, a [[gazetteer]] of Sichuan province stated that at one of these 182&nbsp;m (600&nbsp;ft) 'fire wells', men collected natural gas into portable bamboo tubes which could be carried around for dozens of km (mi) and still produce a flame.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=79\u201380}} These were essentially the first [[gas cylinder]]s; Robert Temple assumes [[Tap (valve)|some sort of tap]] was used for this device.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=79\u201380}}\n\nThe inventor [[Ding Huan]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 180 AD) of the Han dynasty invented a [[Fan (mechanical)|rotary fan]] for [[air conditioning]], with seven wheels 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) in diameter and manually powered.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=99, 151, 233}} In 747, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] had a \"Cool Hall\" built in the imperial palace, which the ''[[Tang Yulin]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5510\u8a9e\u6797}}) describes as having water-powered fan wheels for air conditioning as well as rising jet streams of water from fountains.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=134, 151}} During the subsequent Song dynasty, written sources mentioned the air conditioning rotary fan as even more widely used.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=151}}\n\n==Historiography==\n{{See also|Chinese historiography}}\n\nThe first classic work about the Tang is the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' by Liu Xu (887\u2013946) et al. of the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]], who redacted it during the last years of his life. This was edited into another history (labelled the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'') in order to distinguish it, which was a work by the Song historians [[Ouyang Xiu]] (1007\u20131072), Song Qi (998\u20131061), et al. of the Song dynasty (between the years 1044 and 1060). Both of them were based upon earlier annals, yet those are now lost.<ref>{{cite book|author=Denis Crispin Twitchett |title=The Writing of Official History Under the T'ang |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-521-41348-0}}</ref> Both of them also rank among the ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]'' of China. One of the surviving sources of the ''Old Book of Tang'', primarily covering up to 756, is the ''[[Tongdian]]'', which [[Du You]] presented to the emperor in 801. The Tang period was again placed into the enormous [[universal history]] text of the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', edited, compiled, and completed in 1084 by a team of scholars under the Song dynasty Chancellor [[Sima Guang]] (1019\u20131086). This historical text, written with three million [[Chinese characters]] in 294 volumes, covered the history of China from the beginning of the [[Warring States]] (403 BC) until the beginning of the Song dynasty (960).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China|History}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Chinese emperors family tree (middle)#Tang and Second Zhou Dynasties|The family tree of the Tang dynasty emperors]]\n* [[Di Renjie]]\n* [[Dongyi Protectorate]]\n* [[Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup]]\n* ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' (government newspaper for officials)\n* [[List of emperors of the Tang dynasty]]\n* [[List of tributaries of Imperial China]]\n* [[Nine Pinnacle Pagoda]]\n* [[Qianling Mausoleum]]\n* [[Tang dynasty in Inner Asia]]\n* [[Tang poetry]]\n* [[Taxation in premodern China]]\n* [[Wei Zheng]]\n* [[Yan Zhenqing]]\n* [[Yijing (monk)]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Works cited ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{citation |last=Adshead |first=S.A.M. |title = China in World History |edition=2nd |year=1995 |orig-year=1988 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] and St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-333-62132-5}}\n* {{citation |last=Adshead |first=S.A.M. |title = T'ang China: The Rise of the East in World History|year=2004|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4039-3456-7}}\n* {{citation |last=Andrew |first=Anita N. |last2=Rapp |first2=John A. |title=Autocracy and Cina's Rebel Founding Emperors: Comparing Chairman Mao and Ming Taizu |year=2000 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |location=Lanham |isbn=978-0-8476-9580-5}}\n* {{citation |last=Bai |first=Shouyi|authorlink=Bai Shouyi |title = A History of Chinese Muslim (Vol. 2)|year=2003|publisher=Zhonghua Book Company |location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-101-02890-4}}\n* {{citation |last=Ball |first=Warwick |authorlink=Warwick Ball |title = Rome in the East: Transformation of an Empire |edition=2nd |year=2016 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-72078-6}}\n* {{citation |last=Beckwith|first=Christopher I.|title=The Tibetan Empire in Central Asia|year=1987|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-691-02469-1}}\n* {{citation |last=Benn|first=Charles|title=China's Golden Age: Everyday Life in the Tang dynasty|year=2002|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-517665-0}}\n* {{Citation |last=Bernhardt|first=Kathryn|date=July 1995|title=The Inheritance Right of Daughters: the Song Anomaly?|journal=Modern China|pages=269\u2013309}}\n* {{citation |last=Bowman|first=John S.|title=Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture|year=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}\n* {{citation |last=Brook|first=Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Brook (historian)|title=The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China|year=1998|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-22154-3|title-link=The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China }}\n* {{citation |last=Chen|first=Yan|title=Maritime Silk Route and Chinese-Foreign Cultural Exchanges|year=2002|publisher=Peking University Press|location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-301-03029-5}}\n* {{citation |last=Cui|first=Mingde|title=The History of Chinese Heqin|year=2005|publisher=Renmin Chubanshe|location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-01-004828-4}}\n* {{cite book |title=Tang China and the Collapse of the Uighur Empire: A Documentary History |author-first=Michael R. |author-last=Drompp |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NB6DEdAxLOsC |series=Brill's Inner Asian Library |year=2004 |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-14129-2 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Drompp |first=Michael R. |authormask=3 |chapter=Late-Tang Foreign Relations: The Uyghur Crisis |title=Hawai'i Reader in Traditional Chinese Culture |editor1-last=Mair |editor1-first=Victor H. |editor2=Nancy S.
