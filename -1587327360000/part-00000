Vietnamese communists saw this as a second phase of their revolution, the US now substituting for the French.\n\nBetween the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva accords in 1954]] and 1956, the two states created by the talks were still forming; the influence of major powers, especially [[France]] and the [[United States]], and to a lesser extent [[China]] and the [[Soviet Union]], were as much an influence as any internal matters. There is little question that in 1957-1958, there was a definite early guerilla movement against the Di\u1ec7m government, involving individual assassinations, expropriations, recruiting, shadow government. The insurgents were South Vietnamese rebels or northerners who had been living there for some time. While there was clearly communications and perhaps arms supply from the north, there is little evidence of any Northern units in the South, although organizers may well have infiltrated.\n\nThere was endemic insurgency in South Vietnam throughout the period 1954\u20131960. It can also be established-but less surely- that the Di\u1ec7m regime alienated itself from one after another of those domestic sectors which might have offered it political support, and was grievously at fault in its rural programs. That these conditions engendered animosity toward the Southern dictatorship seems almost certain, and they could have led to a major resistance movement even without North Vietnamese help.\n\nThere is little doubt that there was some kind of [[Viet Minh]]-derived \"[[stay behind]]\" organization between 1954 and 1960, but it is unclear that they were directed to take over action until 1957 or later. Before that, they were unquestionably recruiting and preparing.\n\nWhile the visible guerilla incidents increased gradually, the key policy decisions by the North were made in 1959. Early in this period, there was a greater degree of conflict in Laos than in South Vietnam. US combat involvement was, at first, greater in Laos, but the activity of advisors, and increasingly US direct support to South Vietnamese soldiers, increased, under US military authority, in late 1959 and early 1960. Communications intercepts in 1959, for example, confirmed the start of the Ho Chi Minh trail and other preparation for large-scale fighting. North Vietnam declared its public support for communist insurgents in South Vietnam. The communist forces in South Vietnam established the [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam]] (Viet Cong). At the same time, the United States helped the South Vietnamese regime conduct its war strategy. Despite this assistance, the communist forces still won on the battlefield, fighting several large campaigns next to the big cities. Di\u1ec7m was unable to take control of political crisis and was overthrown by the Council of Revolutionary Military (some documents of both sides suggest that it was the United States which had given the green light for this coup). After several years of chaos, the Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m government came to an end in 1963 and South Vietnam then fell into management crisis.\n\n==Competing strategies==\nOn April 1959, a branch of the Lao Dong ([[Worker's Party of Vietnam]]), of which [[Ho Chi Minh]] became Secretary-General in 1956, was formed in the South, and [[communist]] underground activity increased. Some of the 90,000 [[Viet Minh]] troops that had returned to the North following the Geneva Agreements had begun filtering back into the South to take up leadership positions in the insurgency apparat. Mass demonstrations, punctuated by an occasional raid on an isolated post, were the major activities in the initial stage of this insurgency. Communist-led uprisings launched in 1959 in the lower [[Mekong Delta]] and [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] resulted in the establishment of liberated zones, including an area of nearly fifty villages in [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Province]]. In areas under communist control in 1959, the guerrillas established their own government, levied taxes, trained troops, built defense works, and provided education and medical care. In order to direct and coordinate the new policies in the South, it was necessary to revamp the party leadership apparatus and form a new united front group.\n\nNorth Vietnam committed, in May 1959, to war in the South; this was confirmed by [[communications intelligence]]. Di\u1ec7m, well before that point, had constantly pushed a generic [[anticommunism]], but how much of this was considered a real threat, and how much a nucleus around which he justified his controls, is less clear. Those controls, and the shutdown of most indigenous opposition by 1959, were clearly alienating the Di\u1ec7m government from significant parts of the Southern population. The government was massively mismanaging rural reforms and overemphasizing its power base in the cities, which might have had an independent rebellion. North Vietnam, however, clearly began to exploit that alienation. The US, however, did not recognize a significant threat, even with such information as intelligence on the formation of the logistics structure for infiltration. The presentation of hard evidence &mdash; communications intelligence about the organization building the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] &mdash; of Hanoi's involvement in the developing strife became evident. Not until 1960, however, did the US recognize both Di\u1ec7m was in danger, that the Di\u1ec7m structure was inadequate to deal with the problems, and present the first \"[[Counterinsurgency Plan for Vietnam]] (CIP)\"\n\n===Republic of Vietnam strategy===\nQuite separate from its internal problems, South Vietnam faced an unusual military challenge. On the one hand, there was a threat of a conventional, cross-border strike from the North, reminiscent of the [[Korean War]]. In the fifties, the U.S. advisors focused on building a \"mirror image\" of the [[U.S. Army]], designed to meet and defeat a conventional invasion.<ref name=PntV1Ch05Sec0314-346>{{citation\n | title =The Pentagon Papers, Gravel Edition\n | volume=2\n | contribution = Chapter 6, \"The Advisory Build-Up, 1961-1967\", Section 1, pp. 408-457\n | url = http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon2/pent11.htm}}</ref>\n\nDi\u1ec7m (and his successors) were primarily interested in using the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) as a device to secure power, rather than as a tool to unify the nation and defeat their enemies. Province and District Chiefs in the rural areas were usually military officers, but reported to political leadership in Saigon rather than the military operational [[command hierarchy|chain of command]]. The 1960 \"Counterinsurgency Plan for Vietnam (CIP)\" from the U.S. [[Military Assistance Advisory Group]] (MAAG) was a proposal to change what appeared to be a dysfunctional structure.<ref name=PntV1Ch05Sec0314-346 /> Further analysis showed the situation was not only a jockeying for power, but also reflected that the province chiefs indeed had security authority that could conflict with that of tactical military operations in progress, but also had responsibility for the civil administration of the province. That civil administration function became more and more intertwined, starting in 1964 and with acceleration in 1966, of the \"other war\" of rural development.<ref name=Eckhardt>{{citation\n| title = Vietnam Studies: Command and Control 1950-1969\n| first = George S. | last = Eckhardt\n| publisher = Center of Military History, U.S. Department of the Army | year = 1991\n| url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/Vietnam/Comm-Control/index.htm#contents}}, pp. 68-71</ref>\n\nAn issue that remains unclear is whether or not any of the post-Di\u1ec7m governments seriously explored a neutralist solution through direct negotiations with Hanoi, which would have been against U.S. policy. Contemporary intelligence analyses discount such negotiations, although they remained an undercurrent; [[Robert McNamara]]'s 1999 book says that [[\"Big\" Minh]], the leader of the coup that actually overthrew Di\u1ec7m, was actively exploring such an approach without informing the U.S.<ref name=McNamara1999>{{citation\n| title = Argument Without End: In Search of Answers to the Vietnam Tragedy\n| first1 = Robert S. | last1 = McNamara | first2 = James G. | last2 =Blight |first3= Robert Kendall | last3=Brigham\n| publisher=PublicAffairs | year= 1999\n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=CH--mDP5sGoC&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=%22Ho+Chi+Minh%22+Moscow+1955+OR+1956#PPA95,M1\n| isbn = 1586486217 }}, pp. 113-114</ref>\n\nThroughout this period, there clearly was a lack of information about South Vietnamese motivations. Analyses by the [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]] (INR) of the [[U.S. Department of State]] define the political problems from a viewpoint different from that of the military.<ref name=INR-VN4>{{citation\n | title = Vietnam 1961-1968 as interpreted in INR's Production\n | contribution = IV.

It saw the Minh-Tho government  as enjoying an initial period of popular support as it removed some of the most disliked aspects of the Di\u1ec7m government. During this time, the increase in VC attacks was largely coincidental; they were resulting from the VC having reached a level of offensive capability rather than capitalizing on the overthrow of Di\u1ec7m.\n\nContrary to the INR analysis, [[Douglas Pike]] said that there was a substantial defection from the NLF after the overthrow of Di\u1ec7m, especially among [[Cao \u0110\u00e0i]] that had considered themselves as especially persecuted by Di\u1ec7m. Pike believed that a portion of the NLF was variously anti-Di\u1ec7m, or simply in search of political power, rather than Communist. When this part left, the NLF came much more closely under Hanoi's control.<ref name=Pike-Oral>{{citation\n | date = June 4, 1981\n | title = Oral History interview of [[Douglas Pike]]\n | author = Ted Gittinger\n | publisher = Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library}}, p. I-8</ref>\n\nDuring this period, INR observed, in a December 23 paper, the U.S. needed to reexamine its strategy focused on the [[Strategic Hamlet Program]], since it was getting much more accurate &mdash; if pessimistic &mdash; from the new government than it had from Di\u1ec7m. Secretary McNamara, however, testified to the House Armed Services Committee, on December 27, that only a maximum effort of American power could salvage the situation. Two days later, the Minh-Tho government was overthrown.<ref name=INR-VN4 />\n\nINR looked pessimistically at Kh\u00e1nh, who claimed that Minh had been making overtures to Hanoi for a neutralist settlement.<ref>INR-VN4, p. 12</ref> It was the contemporary assessment of INR that Minh had been making no such overtures, although this is contradicted by Secretary McNamara's 1999 book.\n\nWhether or not Kh\u00e1nh was right about Minh's plan, INR judged Minh as motivated primarily by personal ambition. Where Minh had tried to form a government of technicians, Kh\u00e1nh, admittedly with U.S. urging, brought in political elements, which quickly led to factionalism not present under Minh's period of good will. INR saw Kh\u00e1nh as having a contradictory policy in terms of U.S. goals: while he did increase security, he did so by means judged counterproductive in broadening the political base of the government.\n\nINR considered new student demonstrations, in April 1964, as the first warning of a new wave of protest, which became more manifest in August.  Those demonstrations contained anti-American messages, but INR was uncertain if they represented true anti-Americanism, or simply opposition to American support of Kh\u00e1nh. As opposed to Di\u1ec7m's catastrophic handling of the Buddhist crisis, Kh\u00e1nh responded with moderation, and, on August 28, INR concluded he was, in fact, improving the political situation. Evidence cited including the dissolution, in the next two weeks, of Minh's military triumvirate and Minh's election as chairman of a new Provisional Steering Committee, as well as release of some jailed generals that had supported Minh. INR suggested that Kh\u00e1nh may have caused the unrest by supporting the genuinely popular Kh\u00e1nh. Kh\u00e1nh, however, promptly sent Minh to exile in Thailand.\n\nNote that Minh was exiled within the same month as the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]], with its obvious ramifications of increased U.S. involvement.\n\n===Communist strategy===\nThe North had clearly defined political objectives, and a grand strategy, involving military, diplomatic, covert action and psychological operations to achieve those objectives. Whether or not one agreed with those objectives, there was a clear relationship between long-term goals and short-term actions. Its military first focused on guerilla  and raid warfare in the south (i.e., Mao's \"Phase I\"), simultaneously improving the air defenses of the north.  By the mid-sixties, they were operating in [[battalion]] and larger military formations that would remain in contact as long as the correlation of forces was to their advantage, and then retreat &mdash; Mao's \"Phase II\".\n\nIn the Viet Cong, and in the North Vietnam regular army ([[PAVN]]), every unit had political and military cadre to ensure ''dau tranh'' was carried out.\n\nGuerilla attacks increased in the early 1960s, at the same time as the new [[John F. Kennedy]] administration made Presidential decisions to increase its influence. Di\u1ec7m, as other powers were deciding their policies, was clearly facing disorganized attacks and internal political dissent. There were unquestioned conflicts between the government, dominated by minority Northern Catholics, and both the majority Buddhists and minorities such as the [[Montagnard (Vietnam)|Montagnard]]s, [[Cao \u0110\u00e0i]], and [[H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o]]. These conflicts were exploited, initially at the level of propaganda and recruiting, by stay-behind [[Viet Minh]] receiving orders from the North.\n\n==Events==\n\n===1959===\nDi\u1ec7m, in early 1959, felt under attack and broadly reacted against all forms of opposition, which was presented as a  \"Communist Denunciation Campaign\", as well as some significant and unwelcome rural resettlement, the latter to be distinguished from land reform.\n\n====Increased activity in Laos====\nIn May, the North Vietnamese made the commitment to an armed overthrow of the South, creating the [[559th Transportation Group]], named after the creation date, to operate the land route that became known as the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. Additional transportation groups were created for maritime supply to the South: Group 759 ran sea-based operations, while Group 959 supplied the Pathet Lao by land routes.<ref name=Goscha2002>{{citation \n | first1 = Christopher E. | last1 = Goscha\n | title = The Maritime Nature of the Wars for Vietnam (1945-75)\n | url = http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/vietnamcenter/events/2002_Symposium/2002Papers_files/goscha.htm\n | date = April 2002\n | conference = 4th Triennial Vietnam Symposium, Texas Tech University Vietnam Center}}</ref>  Group 959 also provided secure communications to the Pathet Lao.<ref name=NSAVN-3>{{citation\n | chapter = Chapter 3 - \"To Die in the South\": SIGINT, the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and the Infiltration Problem, [Deleted] 1968\n | title = Spartans in Darkness: American SIGINT and the Indochina War, 1945-1975\n | first1 = Robert J. | last1 =Hanyok\n | publisher = Center for Cryptologic History, National Security Agency\n | year = 2002\n | url = http://www.fas.org/irp/nsa/spartans/chapter3.pdf }}</ref>\n\nThe Pathet Lao both were operating against the Laotian government, but also working with NVA Group 959 to supply the southern insurgency; much of the original Trail was in Laos, first supplying the Pathet Lao. Nevertheless. the Laotian government did not want it known that it was being assisted by the US in the [[Laotian Civil War]] against the [[Pathet Lao]].  U.S. military assistance could also be considered a violation of the Geneva agreement, although North Vietnam, and its suppliers, were equally in violation.\n\nIn July, CIA sent a unit from [[United States Army Special Forces]], who arrived on CIA proprietary airline [[Air America (airline)|Air America]], wearing civilian clothes and having no obvious US connection. These soldiers led [[Miao people|Miao]] and [[Hmong people#The \"Secret War\"|Hmong]] tribesmen against Communist forces. The covert program was called [[Operation Hotfoot]]. At the US Embassy, BG John Heintges was called the head of the \"Program Evaluation Office.\"<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://cgsc.cdmhost.com/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/p4013coll2&CISOPTR=979&filename=980.pdf\n | title=Seminole Negro Indians, Macabebes, and Civilian Irregulars: Models for the Future Employment of Indigenous Forces\n | work=US Army Command and General Staff College\n | author = Holman, Victor\n | year = 1995\n}}</ref>\n\nCIA directed Air America, in August 1959, to train two helicopter pilots.

This move would enable advisers to give on-the-spot advice and effectively assess the end result of the advisory effort. He also requested [[United States Army Special Forces]] (SF) mobile training teams (MTT) to assist in training ARVN units in [[counterinsurgency]].\n\nOn 8 July, the MAAG-V headquarters at Bien Hoa was raided by the Viet Cong; two South Vietnamese guards were killed along with two advisors, Major Dale Buis and Master Sergeant Chester Ovnand. These were the first American battle deaths in the Vietnam War.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">Vietnam Perspectives - Vol. 1, No. 1, Aug., 1965. Chronology of Events Relative to Vietnam, 1954-1965, p. 20. https://www.jstor.org/stable/30182459</ref>\n\n====Structural barriers to effectiveness of RVN forces====\nWhen the MAAG was instructed to improve the effectiveness of the RVN, the most fundamental problem was that the Di\u1ec7m government had organized the military and paramilitary forces not for effectiveness, but for political control and patronage. The most obvious manifestation of Di\u1ec7m's goal was that there were two parallel organizations, the regular military under the  Department of National Defense and the local defense forces under the Ministry of the Interior. Di\u1ec7m was the only person who could give orders to both.\n\n=====Command and control=====\nPresident Di\u1ec7m appointed the Secretary of State for National Defense and the Minister of the Interior. The Defense Secretary directed of General Staff chief and several special sub-departments. The General staff chief, in turn, commanded the Joint General Staff (JGS), which was both the top-level staff and the top of the military chain of command.\n\nThere were problems with the military structure, even before considering the paramilitary forces under the Interior Ministry. The JGS itself had conflicting components with no clear authority. For example, support for the Air Force came both from a Director of Air Technical Service and a Deputy Chief of Air Staff for Mat\u00e9riel. The Director was, in principle, under the Chief of Staff, but actually reported to the Director General of Administration, Budget, and Comptroller for fiscal matters).\n\nCombat units also had conflicting chains of command. A division commander might receive orders both from the corps-level tactical commander who actually carried out the [[operational art]] role of [[corps]] commanders in most militaries, but also from the regional commander of the home base of the division &mdash; even if the division was operating in another area. The chiefs of branches of service (e.g., [[infantry]], [[artillery]]), who in most armies were responsible only for preparation and training of personnel of their branch, and orders only before they were deployed, would give direct operational orders to units in the field.\n\nDi\u1ec7m himself, who had no significant military background, could be the worst [[micromanager]] of all, getting on a radio in the garden of the Presidential Palace, and issuing orders to regiments, bypassing the Department of National Defense, Joint General Staff, operational commanders, and division commanders. He also consciously played subordinates against one another to avoid the formation of opposition; the [[Battle of Ap Bac]] was a defeat caused by a lack of unity of command, with conflicts between the military commander and province chief.\n\nIn fairness to Di\u1ec7m, [[Lyndon Johnson]] and his political advisors would do detailed air operations planning for attacks in the North, with no input from experienced air officers. [[Henry Kissinger]], in the [[Mayaguez incident]], got onto the tactical radio net and confused the local commanders with German-accented and obscure commands.  Johnson and Kissinger did have had more military experience than Di\u1ec7m; Johnson had briefly served in the Naval Reserve, and Kissinger lectured on politics at the end of World War II and the start of the Occupation, with a high status but an actual rank of Private, United States Army.  Di\u1ec7m had never put on a uniform.\n\n\"The Department of National Defense and most of the central organizations and the ministerial services were located in downtown Saigon, while the General Staff (less air and navy elements) was inefficiently located in a series of company-size troop barracks on the edge of the city. The chief of the General Staff was thus removed several miles from the Department of National Defense. The navy and air staffs were also separately located in downtown Saigon. With such a physical layout, staff action and decision-making unduly delayed on even the simplest of matters.\n\n\"The over-all ministerial structure described above was originally set up by the French and slightly modified by presidential decree on 3 October 1957. Military Assistance Advisory Group, Vietnam, had proposed a different command structure which would have placed the ministry and the \"general staff\" in closer proximity both physically and in command relationship.\" Di\u1ec7m, however,  made a practice of keeping individuals or small groups from having too much authority.\n\nThe chain of command of both the Civil Guard and Self-Defense Corps, went from the Ministry of the Interior to the province chiefs, district chiefs, and village councils. Even though the province chiefs and district chiefs were often military officers, ARVN units operating in a province or district could not give orders to these units. Instead, they had to pass a request through military channels to the Ministry of Defense in Saigon. If the officials there agreed, they would convey the request to their counterparts in the Ministry of the Interior, who would then send orders down its chain of command to the local units.\n\n=====Regular military=====\n*Three corps headquarters and a special military district:<ref>Collins, pp. 9-10</ref>\n**I Corps at [[Da Nang]] for the northern and central areas; the Central Highlands were separate\n**II Corps at [[Pleiku]] for the Central Highlands provinces\n**III Corps at [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] for the southern part of the country\n**Saigon city  special military district.\n*Seven divisions of 10,450 men\n**three infantry regiments\n**artillery battalion\n**mortar battalion\n**engineer battalion\n**company-size support elements\n*Airborne group of five battalion groups\n*four armored cavalry \"regiments\" (approximately the equivalent of a U.S. Army cavalry squadron)\n**one squadron (U.S. troop) of M24 light tanks\n**two squadrons of M8 self-propelled 75-mm. howitzers\n*Eight independent artillery battalions with U.S. 105-mm, and 155-mm. pieces.\n\n=====Local defense forces=====\nCreated by presidential decree in April 1955, and originally under the direct control of President Di\u1ec7m, with control passed to the Ministry of the Interior in September 1958, the Civil Guard was made up of wartime paramilitary veterans. Its major duty was to relieve the ARVN of static security missions, freeing it for mobile operations, with additional responsibility for local intelligence collection and [[counterintelligence]]. in 1956, had 68,000 men organized into companies and platoons, the Civil Guard was represented by two to eight companies in each province. It had a centrally controlled reserve of eight mobile battalions of 500 men each.\n\nOperating on a local basis since 1955 and formally created in 1956, the Self-Defense corps was a village-level police organization, for protection against intimidation and subversion. It put units of 4-10 men into villages of 1,000 or more residents. In 1956, it had 48,000 non-uniformed troops armed with French weapons. The Self-Defense Corps, like the Civil Guard, was established to free regular forces from internal security duties by providing a police organization at village level to protect the population from subversion and intimidation. Units of four to ten men each were organized in villages of 1,000 or more inhabitants.\n\nThe Civil Guard and the Self-Defense Corps were poorly trained and ill-equipped to perform their missions, and by 1959 their numbers had declined to about 46,000 and 40,000, respectively.\n\n===1960===\nAs mentioned in the introduction to this section, the U.S. was urging the RVN to revise its parallel province/district command and military operations command structure; the Counterinsurgency Plan (CIP) was the first of several such proposals.\n\n====Laotian operations====\nAfter the 180-day assignment of the Special Forces personnel in Laos, the name changed to Operation White Star, under COL [[Arthur Simons|Arthur \"Bull\" Simons]].\n\n====Beginning of Phase II raids====\nOn 25 January 1960, a Communist force  of 300 to 500 men escalated with a direct raid on an ARVN base at [[T\u00e2y Ninh]], killing 23 soldiers and taking large quantities of munitions. Four days later, a guerilla group seized a town for several hours, and stole cash from a French citizen. These were still in the first Maoist stage, as raids rather than hit-and-run battles.  Still, larger guerilla forces broke lines of communications within areas of South Vietnam.\n\nThere was uncertainty, expressed by Bernard Fall and in a March U.S. intelligence assessment, that there were distinct plans to conduct larger-scale operations  \"under the flag of the People's Liberation Movement\", which was identified as \"red, with a blue star.\" It was uncertain if their intent was to continue to build bases in the Mekong Delta, or to isolate Saigon. The ''Pentagon Papers'' stated the guerillas were establishing three options, of which they could exercise one or more;\n# incite an ARVN revolt\n#set up a popular front government in the lower Delta\n#force the GVN into such repressive countermeasures that popular uprisings will follow.\n\n====South Vietnam corruption breeds discontent====\n{{main|Caravelle Manifesto|1960 South Vietnamese coup attempt}}\n{{see also|1962 South Vietnamese Independence Palace bombing}}\nOn April 1960, eighteen distinguished nationalists in South Vietnam sent a petition to President Di\u1ec7m advocating that he reform his rigid, family-run, and increasingly corrupt, government. Di\u1ec7m ignored their advice and instead closed several opposition newspapers and arrests journalists and intellectuals. On 5 May 1960, MAAG strength was increased from 327 to 685 personnel.\n\n====Formation of the NLF====\nIn December, the  [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam]] (NLF) formally declared its existence, although it did not hold its first full congress until 1962.\n\nThe NLF platform recognized some of the internal stresses under the Di\u1ec7m government, and put language in its platform  to create autonomous regions in minority areas and for the abolition of the \"U.S.-Di\u00eam clique's present policy of ill-treatment and forced assimilation of the minority nationalities\".<ref name=HRW-RoM-Ch03>{{citation\n | title = Repression of Montagnards:  Conflicts over Land and Religion in  Vietnam's Central Highlands\n | author = Human Rights Watch\n | contribution = III.

In the early 1960s, NLF political organizers went to the Montagnard areas in the Central Highlands, and worked both to increase alienation from the GVN and directly recruit supporters.\n\n===1961: Slow U.S. engagement===\nNot surprisingly, with a change in U.S. administration, there were changes in policy, and also continuations of some existing activities. There were changes in outlook. \nDefense Secretary [[Robert S. McNamara]] (in office 1961-68) told President [[John F. Kennedy]] (in office 1961-63) in 1961 it was \"absurd to think that a nation of 20 million people can be subverted by 15-20 thousand active guerrillas if the government and the people of that country do not wish to be subverted.\"<ref>Rusk/McNamara memorandum. Nov. 11, 1961, [http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon2/pent3.htm online at ''Pentagon Papers'']</ref>  McNamara, a manufacturing executive and expert in statistical management, had no background in [[guerilla warfare]] or other than Western culture, and rejected advice from area specialists and military officers. He preferred to consult with his personal team, often called the \"Whiz Kids\"; his key foreign policy advisor was a law professor, John McNaughton, while economist Alain Enthoven was perhaps his closest colleague.\n\nStill trying to resolve the problems of GVN conflicting command, a new reorganizational proposal, the \"Geographically Phased Plan\". The goal was to have a coherent national plan, which was, in 1962, to be expressed as the [[Strategic Hamlet Program]].\n\n====Kennedy pushes for covert operations against the North====\nOn January 28, 1961, shortly after his inauguration, John F. Kennedy told a [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] meeting that he wanted covert operations launched against North Vietnam, in retaliation for their equivalent actions in the South.<ref name=Shultz>{{citation|\n title = the Secret War against Hanoi: the untold story of spies, saboteurs, and covert warriors in North Vietnam\n | first = Richard H., Jr. | last = Shultz |author-link=Richard H. Shultz\n | publisher = Harper Collins Perennial | year = 2000}}, p. 3</ref> It is not suggested that this was an inappropriate decision, but the existence of covert operations against the North, has to be understood in analyzing later events, especially the [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident]].\n\nEven earlier, he issued National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 2, directing the military to prepare counterinsurgency forces, although not yet targeting the North.<ref name=Whitcomb2005>{{citation\n | date = December 2005\n | volume = 88\n | issue = 12\n | title=Farm Gate: In 1961, the Air Force took its first step into a very long war.\n | first = Darrel | last = Whitcomb | journal = Air Force Magazine\n | url = http://www.afa.org/magazine/Dec2005/1205farmgate.html}}</ref>\n\nKennedy discovered that little had progressed by mid-March, and issued National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 28, ordering the CIA respond to his desire to launch guerilla operations against the North. Herb Weisshart, deputy chief of the Saigon CIA station, observed the actual CIA action plan was \"very modest\". Given the Presidential priority, Weisshart said it was modest because [[William Colby]], then Saigon station chief, said it would consume too many resources needed in the South. He further directed, in April, a presidential task force to draft a \"Program of Action for Vietnam\".\n\nIn April, the [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] of Cuba, under the CIA, had failed, and Kennedy lost confidence in the CIA's paramilitary operations. Kennedy himself had some responsibility for largely cutting the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] out of operational planning. The JCS believed the operation was ill-advised, but, if it was to be done, American air support was essential. Kennedy, however, had made a number of changes to create [[plausible deniability]], only allowing limited air strikes by CIA-sponsored pilots acting as Cuban dissidents. After it was learned that the main strike had left behind a few jet aircraft, he refused a follow-up strike; those aircraft savaged the poorly organized amphibious ships and their propeller-driven air support.\n\nThe [[U.S. Air Force]], however, responded to NSAM 2 by creating, on April 14, 1961, the 4400th Combat Crew Training Squadron (CCTS), code named \"Jungle Jim.\" The unit, of about 350 men, had 16 [[C-47]] transports, eight [[A-26 Invader|B-26]] bombers, and eight [[North American T-28 Trojan|T-28]] trainers (equipped for ground attack), with an official of training indigenous air forces in counterinsurgency and conduct air operations. A volunteer unit, they would deploy in October, to begin FARM GATE missions.\n\nThe task force reported back in May, with a glum assessment of the situation in the South, and a wide-ranging but general plan of action, which became NSAM 52. In June, Kennedy issued a set of NSAMs transferring paramilitary operations to the Department of Defense.<ref>Shultz 2000, pp. 17\u201323</ref> These transfers of responsibility should be considered not only in respect to the specific operations against the North, but in the level of covert military operation in the South in the upcoming months. This transfer also cut the experienced MG [[Edward Lansdale]] out of the process, as while he was a [[U.S. Air Force]] officer, the military saw him as belonging to CIA.\n\n====Intelligence support====\nAlso in May, the first U.S. [[signals intelligence]] unit, from the [[United States Army Security Agency|Army Security Agency]] under [[National Security Agency]] control, entered Vietnam operating under the cover name \"3rd Radio Research Unit.\" Organizationally, it provided support to MAAG-V, and trained ARVN personnel, the latter within security constraints. The general policy, throughout the war, was that ARVN intelligence personnel were not given access above the collateral SECRET (i.e., with no access to material with the additional special restrictions of \"code word\" [[communications intelligence]]  (CCO or SI). {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nTheir principal initial responsibility was [[direction finding]] of Viet Cong radio transmitters, which they started doing from vehicles equipped with sensors. On December 22, 1961, an Army Security Agency soldier, SP4 James T. Davis, was killed in an ambush leading an ARVN squad on one of these direction finding missions. After Johnson became President of the United States several years later, he referred to Davis in a speech as the first American killed in Vietnam; in reality, there had been fifteen battle deaths before Davis.<ref>James Thomas Davis - The Virtual Wall http://www.virtualwall.org/dd/DavisJT01a.htm</ref>\n\n====Covert U.S. air support enters the South====\nMore U.S. personnel, officially designated as advisors, arrived in the South and took an increasingly active, although covert, role. In October, a [[U.S. Air Force]] special operations squadron, part of the 4400th CCTS deployed to SVN, officially in a role of advising and training. The aircraft were painted in South Vietnamese colors, and the aircrew wore uniforms without insignia and without U.S. ID. Sending military forces to South Vietnam was a violation of the Geneva Accords of 1954, and the U.S. wanted [[plausible deniability]].\n\nThe deployment package consisted of 155 airmen, eight T-28s, and four modified and redesignated SC-47s and subsequently received B-26s. U.S. personnel flew combat as long as a VNAF person was aboard. FARMGATE stayed covert until after the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]].<ref name=Whitcomb2005 />\n\n====Building the South Vietnamese Civil Irregular Defense Groups====\nUnder the operational control of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]],<ref name=McClintock2002Ch09>{{citation\n | title = Instruments of Statecraft: U.S. Guerilla Warfare, Counterinsurgency, and Counterterrorism, 1940-1990\n | contribution = Chapter 9, The Heart of Doctrine\n | url = http://www.statecraft.org/chapter9.html\n | year = 2002 \n | first = Michael | last = McClintock\n | publisher = Pantheon Books, Division of Random House\n}}</ref> initial [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] involvement came in October, with the Rhade.<ref name=Kelly1973>{{citation\n | title = Vietnam Studies: U.S. Army Special Forces 1961-1971\n | id = CMH Publication 90-23\n | publisher = Center of Military History, Department of the Army\n | year = 1973\n | url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/Vietnam/90-23/90-23C.htm\n | first = Francis John | last = Kelly}}, p. 4</ref> The Civilian Irregular Defense Groups (CIDG), were under [[Central Intelligence Agency]] operational control until  July 1, 1963, when MACV took control.<ref>Collins 1974, p. 70</ref> Army documents refer to control by \"CAS Saigon\", a cover name for the CIA station. According to Kelly, the SF and CIA rationale for establishing the CIDG program with the Montagnards was that minority participation would broaden the GVN counterinsurgency program, but, more critically, \n\n<blockquote>the Montagnards and other minority groups were prime targets for Communist propaganda, partly because of their dissatisfaction with the Vietnamese government, and it was important to prevent the Viet Cong from recruiting them and taking complete control of their large and strategic land holdings.<ref>Kelly 1974, p. 19</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt was in mid-November when Kennedy decided to take on operational as well as advisory roles. Under U.S. [[U.S. foreign military assistance organizations#doctrine for assisting other countries|a Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG)]], such as the senior U.S. military organization in Vietnam, is a support and advisory organization. A Military Assistance Command (MAC) is designed to carry out MAAG duties, but also to command combat troops.<ref>Eckhardt, p. 25</ref> There was considerable discussion about the reporting structure of this of the organization: a separate theater reporting to the [[National Command Authority]] or part of [[United States Pacific Command]].\n\n====First Honolulu Conference====\nAfter meetings in Vietnam by GEN Taylor, the Secretaries of State and Defense issued a set of recommendations, on November 11.<ref name=RuskMac>{{citation\n | title = United States National Interests in South Viet-Nam; report to the President\n | first1 = Dean | last1 = Rusk |first2 = Robert | last2 = McNamara\n | date = November 11, 1961\n | url = http://vietnam.vassar.edu/doc7.html}}</ref> Kennedy accepted all except the use of large U.S. combat forces.\n\nMcNamara held the first Honolulu Conference, at [[United States Pacific Command]] headquarters, with the Vietnam commanders present. He addressed short-term possibilities, urging concentration on stabilizing one province: \"I'll guarantee it (the money and equipment) provided you have a plan based on one province. Take one place, sweep it and hold it in a plan.\" Or, put another way, let us demonstrate that in some place, in some way, we can achieve demonstrable gains.<ref name=\"PntV1Ch05Sec0314-346 2\">{{citation\n | title =The Pentagon Papers, Gravel Edition\n | volume=2\n | contribution = Chapter 2, \"The Strategic Hamlet Program, 1961-1963\"\n | pages=128\u2013159\n | url = http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon2/pent4.htm}}</ref>\n\n====First U.S. direct support to an ARVN combat operation====\nOn 11 December 1961 the United States aircraft carrier ''USNS Card'' docked in downtown Saigon with 82 U.

It  was the first time U.S. forces directly and overtly supported ARVN units in combat, although the American forces did not directly attack the guerillas. Approximately 1,000 Vietnamese paratroopers were airlifted into a suspected Viet Cong headquarters complex about ten miles west of the Vietnamese capital, achieving tactical surprise and capturing a radio station.<ref name=Tolson1974>{{citation\n | id = Tolson 1974\n | title = Vietnam Studies: Airmobility 1961-1971\n | first = John J. | last = Tolson\n | year = 1974 | publisher = Center of Military History, Department of the Army\n | url =http://www.history.army.mil/books/Vietnam/Airmobility/airmobility-fm.html}}, p. 4</ref>\n\n===1962: Getting in deeper===\nFrom the U.S. perspective, the [[Strategic Hamlet Program]] was the consensus approach to pacifying the countryside.<ref name=PntV1Ch05Sec0314-346 /> There was a sense, however, that this was simply not a high priority for Di\u1ec7m, who considered his power base to be in the cities. The Communists, willing to fill a vacuum, became more and more active in rural areas where the GVN was invisible, irrelevant, or actively a hindrance.\n\n====Special Forces operations====\nIn 1962, the U.S. Military Assistance Command\u2013Vietnam (MACV) established Army Special Forces camps near villages. The Americans wanted a military presence there to block the infiltration of enemy forces from Laos, to provide a base for launching patrols into Laos to monitor the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and to serve as a western anchor for defense along the DMZ.<ref name=HN-KS>{{citation\n | title =  Battle of Khe Sanh: Recounting the Battle's Casualties\n | first = Peter | last = Brush \n | url = http://www.historynet.com/battle-of-khe-sanh-recounting-the-battlescasualties.htm}}</ref> These defended villages were not part of the Strategic Hamlet Program, but did provide examples that were relevant.\n\n====U.S. ground command structure established====\nU.S. command structures continued to emerge. On February 8, [[Paul Harkins|Paul D. Harkins]], then Deputy Commanding General, U.S. Army Pacific, under Pacific Command, was promoted to [[general]] and assigned to command the new [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] (MAC-V).\n\nMilitary Assistance Command-Thailand was created on May 15, 1962, but reported to Harkins at MAC-V. In a departure from usual practice, the MAAG was retained as an organization subordinate to MAC-V, rather than being absorbed into it. The MAAG continued to command U.S. advisors and direct support to the ARVN. At first, MAC-V delegated control of U.S. combat units to the MAAG. While it was not an immediate concern, MAC-V never controlled all the Air Force and Navy units that would operate in Vietnam, but from outside its borders. These remained under the control of Pacific Command, or, in some cases, the [[Strategic Air Command]].\n\nNo regular ARVN units were under the command of U.S. military commanders, although there were exceptions for irregular units under Special Forces. Indeed, there could be situations where, in a joint operation, U.S. combat troops were under a U.S. commander, while the ARVN units were under an ARVN officer with a U.S. advisor. Relationships in particular operations often were more a matter of personalities and politics rather than ideal command. U.S. troops also did not report to ARVN officers; while many RVN officers had their post through political connections, others would have been outstanding commanders in any army.\n\nAt the same time, the U.S. was beginning to explore withdrawing forces.<ref name=PntPapV4Ch2-160-200>{{citation\n | title = The Pentagon Papers, Gravel Edition, Volume 2\n | contribution = Chapter 3, \"Phased Withdrawal of U.S. Forces, 1962-1964\", pp. 160-200.\n | url = http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon2/pent5.htm}}</ref>\n\n====Intelligence support refines====\n{{See also|Signals intelligence in the Cold War}}\nThe USMC 1st Composite Radio Company deployed, on January 2, 1962, to Pleiku, South Vietnam as Detachment One.

It remains unclear as to what extent the South Vietnamese were exploring solutions based a neutralist Vietnam, but this apparently existed at some level, without U.S. knowledge.\n\n===Organizations and personnel===\nOrganizations and commands would change with time. In January, for example, Major General Don became Commander-in-Chief of the RVN armed forces, GEN [[William Westmoreland]] was named deputy to GEN [[Paul Harkins]] to replace him later. In a structural reorganization, the ARVN made the Saigon Special Region the [[III Corps tactical zone]];<ref name=MACV-Chron64>{{citation\n | url=http://www.carrscompendiums.com/ccSEA/Chronology/MACV_1964.html\n | author = Military Assistance Command, Vietnam\n | title = MACV Command History Chronology - 1964}}</ref> the former III Corps for the Mekong Delta became [[IV Corps tactical zone]]\n\n===January 1963: Question of ARVN effectiveness===\nSouth Vietnamese forces, with U.S. advisors, took severe defeats at the [[Battle of Ap Bac]] in January, and the [[Battle of Go Cong]] in September.<ref name=Sheehan>{{citation\n | first = Neil | last = Sheehan\n | title = A Bright and Shining Lie\n | publisher = Vintage | year = 1989}}</ref>  This has been considered the trigger for an increasingly skeptical, although small, American press corps in Vietnam. Ap Bac was of particular political sensitivity, as [[John Paul Vann]], a highly visible American officer, was the advisor, and the U.S. press took note of what he considered to be ARVN shortcomings.\n\nWhile the [[Buddhist crisis]] and [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|military coup]] that ended with the killing of Di\u1ec7m was an obvious major event, it was by no means the only event of the year. In keeping with the President's expressed desires, covert operations against the North were escalated. Of course, the assassination of Kennedy himself brought [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]], with a different philosophy toward the war. Kennedy was an activist, but had a sense of unconventional warfare and geopolitics, and, as is seen in the documentary record, discussed policy development with a wide range of advisors, specifically including military leaders although he distrusted the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]].<ref name=McMaster>{{citation\n | first = H.

He also spoke with a much smaller advisory circle than Kennedy, and excluded active military officers.\n\n====The Buddhist crisis begins====\n{{main|Buddhist crisis}}\nWhile there had been long-standing animosity between Di\u1ec7m and the Buddhists. April 1963. For unclear reasons, the central government ordered the provincial authorities to enforce a ban on the display of all religious flags. This ban had rarely been enforced, but, since the order went out shortly before the major festival, Vesek (informally called Buddha's Birthday), which fell on May 8, many Buddhists perceived this as a direct attack on their customs.\n\nIn May, a government paramilitary unit fired into demonstrators. As part of a wave of protests, a Buddhist monk immolated himself; photographs of his body, apparently seated calmly in the lotus position as he burned to death, drew worldwide attention. By early June, the government was negotiating with the Buddhists as it had never done, with Vice President Tho, a Buddhist, apparently being an effective negotiator in spite of Di\u1ec7m's brother and political advisor Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu's announcing \"if the Buddhists want to have another barbecue, I will be glad to supply the gasoline\".\n\n====May 1963 Honolulu conference; covert warfare a major issue====\nAt the May 6 Honolulu conference, the decision was made to increase, as the President had been pushing, covert operations against the North. A detailed plan for covert operations, Pacific Command Operations Plan 34A (OPPLAN 34A) went to GEN Taylor, now [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], did not approve it until September 9. Shultz suggests the delay had three aspects:\n#Washington was preoccupied with the Buddhist crisis\n#MACV had no established covert operations force, so even if he approved a plan, there was no one to execute it\n#Taylor, although a distinguished Airborne (paratroopers once being believed special operators) officer, disagreed with Kennedy's emphasis on covert operations, did not have the appropriate resources in the Department of Defense, and he did not believe it was a proper job for soldiers.\n#Di\u1ec7m, fighting for survival, was not interested\n\nIt is unclear if Taylor did not believe covert operations should not be attempted at all, or if he regarded it as a CIA mission. If the latter, Kennedy would have been unlikely to support him, given the President's loss of confidence after the [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] fiasco.<ref>Shultz, pp. 32\u201333.</ref>\n\n====Interim government====\n{{main|1963 South Vietnamese coup|Arrest and assassination of Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m|Reaction to the 1963 South Vietnamese coup}}\nDi\u1ec7m was overthrown and killed on November 1.\n\nSecretary of State Rusk counseled a delay in meeting with the coup leadership, which had started calling itself the \"Revolutionary Committee\", to avoid appearance of it being a U.S. coup. Apparently unknown to the U.S., the plotters had negotiated, beforehand, with vice-president [[Nguyen Ngoc Tho]], who, himself a Buddhist, had been the chief government negotiator in the Buddhist crisis. In the immediate followup of the coup, Di\u1ec7m's cabinet were told to resign, and there were no reprisals.

Afterwards, Lodge reported, \"Minh seemed tired and somewhat frazzled; obviously a good, well-intentioned man. Will he be strong enough to get on top of things?\" The new government was announced on the 6th: General Minh was Chairman, Don and Dinh were Deputy Chairmen, and nine other generals, including Kim, Khi\u00eam, \"little\" Minh, Chieu, and Thieu were members.  General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh]], the commander of [[II Corps (South Vietnam)|II Corps]] tactical zone in central Vietnam, was not in the government.\n\n====After two assassinations====\nKennedy and Di\u1ec7m both died in November 1963. [[Lyndon Johnson]] became the new President of the United States. Johnson was far more focused on domestic politics than the international activist, Kennedy. Some of the Kennedy team left quickly, while others, sometimes surprisingly given extremely different personalities, stayed on; the formal and logical [[Robert McNamara]] quickly bonded with the emotional and deal-making Johnson.\n\nMcNamara was insistent that a rational enemy would not accept the massive casualties that indeed were inflicted on the Communists.

Vietnamese communists saw this as a second phase of their revolution, the US now substituting for the French.\n\nBetween the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva accords in 1954]] and 1956, the two states created by the talks were still forming; the influence of major powers, especially [[France]] and the [[United States]], and to a lesser extent [[China]] and the [[Soviet Union]], were as much an influence as any internal matters. There is little question that in 1957-1958, there was a definite early guerilla movement against the Di\u1ec7m government, involving individual assassinations, expropriations, recruiting, shadow government. The insurgents were South Vietnamese rebels or northerners who had been living there for some time. While there was clearly communications and perhaps arms supply from the north, there is little evidence of any Northern units in the South, although organizers may well have infiltrated.\n\nThere was endemic insurgency in South Vietnam throughout the period 1954\u20131960. It can also be established-but less surely- that the Di\u1ec7m regime alienated itself from one after another of those domestic sectors which might have offered it political support, and was grievously at fault in its rural programs. That these conditions engendered animosity toward the Southern dictatorship seems almost certain, and they could have led to a major resistance movement even without North Vietnamese help.\n\nThere is little doubt that there was some kind of [[Viet Minh]]-derived \"[[stay behind]]\" organization between 1954 and 1960, but it is unclear that they were directed to take over action until 1957 or later. Before that, they were unquestionably recruiting and preparing.\n\nWhile the visible guerilla incidents increased gradually, the key policy decisions by the North were made in 1959. Early in this period, there was a greater degree of conflict in Laos than in South Vietnam. US combat involvement was, at first, greater in Laos, but the activity of advisors, and increasingly US direct support to South Vietnamese soldiers, increased, under US military authority, in late 1959 and early 1960. Communications intercepts in 1959, for example, confirmed the start of the Ho Chi Minh trail and other preparation for large-scale fighting. North Vietnam declared its public support for communist insurgents in South Vietnam. The communist forces in South Vietnam established the [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam]] (Viet Cong). At the same time, the United States helped the South Vietnamese regime conduct its war strategy. Despite this assistance, the communist forces still won on the battlefield, fighting several large campaigns next to the big cities. Di\u1ec7m was unable to take control of political crisis and was overthrown by the Council of Revolutionary Military (some documents of both sides suggest that it was the United States which had given the green light for this coup). After several years of chaos, the Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m government came to an end in 1963 and South Vietnam then fell into management crisis.\n\n==Competing strategies==\nOn April 1959, a branch of the Lao Dong ([[Worker's Party of Vietnam]]), of which [[Ho Chi Minh]] became Secretary-General in 1956, was formed in the South, and [[communist]] underground activity increased. Some of the 90,000 [[Viet Minh]] troops that had returned to the North following the Geneva Agreements had begun filtering back into the South to take up leadership positions in the insurgency apparat. Mass demonstrations, punctuated by an occasional raid on an isolated post, were the major activities in the initial stage of this insurgency. Communist-led uprisings launched in 1959 in the lower [[Mekong Delta]] and [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] resulted in the establishment of liberated zones, including an area of nearly fifty villages in [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Province]]. In areas under communist control in 1959, the guerrillas established their own government, levied taxes, trained troops, built defense works, and provided education and medical care. In order to direct and coordinate the new policies in the South, it was necessary to revamp the party leadership apparatus and form a new united front group.\n\nNorth Vietnam committed in, May 1959, to war in the South; this was confirmed by [[communications intelligence]]. [[Di\u1ec7m]], well before that point, had constantly pushed a generic [[anticommunism]], but how much of this was considered a real threat, and how much a nucleus around which he justified his controls, is less clear. Those controls, and the shutdown of most indigenous opposition by 1959, was clearly alienating the Di\u1ec7m government from significant parts of the Southern population, was massively mismanaging rural reforms and overemphasizing the power base in the cities,  and might have had an independent rebellion.  North Vietnam, however, clearly began to exploit that alienation. The US, however, did not recognize a significant threat, even with such information as intelligence on the formation of the logistics structure for infiltration. The presentation of hard evidence &mdash; communications intelligence about the organization building the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] &mdash;  Hanoi's involvement in the developing strife became evident. Not until 1960, however, did the US recognize both Di\u1ec7m was in danger, that the Di\u1ec7m structure was inadequate to deal with the problems, and present the first \"[[Counterinsurgency Plan for Vietnam]] (CIP)\"\n\n===Republic of Vietnam strategy===\nQuite separate from its internal problems, South Vietnam faced an unusual military challenge. On the one hand, there was a threat of a conventional, cross-border strike from the North, reminiscent of the [[Korean War]]. In the fifties, the U.S. advisors focused on building a \"mirror image\" of the [[U.S. Army]], designed to meet and defeat a conventional invasion.<ref name=PntV1Ch05Sec0314-346>{{citation\n | title =The Pentagon Papers, Gravel Edition\n | volume=2\n | contribution = Chapter 6, \"The Advisory Build-Up, 1961-1967\", Section 1, pp. 408-457\n | url = http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon2/pent11.htm}}</ref>\n\nDi\u1ec7m (and his successors) were primarily interested in using the ARVN as a device to secure power, rather than as a tool to unify the nation and defeat its enemies. Province and District Chiefs in the rural areas were usually military officers, but reported to political leadership in Saigon rather than the military operational [[command hierarchy|chain of command]].   The 1960 \"Counterinsurgency Plan for Vietnam (CIP)\" from the U.S. MAAG was a proposal to change what appeared to be a dysfunctional structure.<ref name=PntV1Ch05Sec0314-346 />  Further analysis showed the situation was not only jockeying for power, but also reflected that the province chief indeed had security authority that could conflict with that of tactical military operations in progress, but also had responsibility for the civil administration of the province. That civil administration function became more and more intertwined, starting in 1964 and with acceleration in 1966, of the \"other war\" of rural development.<ref name=Eckhardt>{{citation\n| title = Vietnam Studies: Command and Control 1950-1969\n| first = George S. | last = Eckhardt\n| publisher = Center of Military History, U.S. Department of the Army | year = 1991\n| url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/Vietnam/Comm-Control/index.htm#contents}}, pp. 68-71</ref>\n\nAn issue that remains unclear is whether or not any of the post-Di\u1ec7m governments seriously explored a neutralist solution through direct negotiations with Hanoi, which would have been against U.S. policy. Contemporary intelligence analyses discount such negotiations, although they remained an undercurrent; [[Robert McNamara]]'s 1999 book says that [[\"Big\" Minh]], the leader of the coup that actually overthrew Di\u1ec7m, was actively exploring such an approach without informing the U.S.<ref name=McNamara1999>{{citation\n| title = Argument Without End: In Search of Answers to the Vietnam Tragedy\n| first1 = Robert S. | last1 = McNamara | first2 = James G. | last2 =Blight |first3= Robert Kendall | last3=Brigham\n| publisher=PublicAffairs | year= 1999\n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=CH--mDP5sGoC&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=%22Ho+Chi+Minh%22+Moscow+1955+OR+1956#PPA95,M1\n| isbn = 1586486217 }}, pp. 113-114</ref>\n\nThroughout this period, there clearly was a disconnect about South Vietnamese motivations. Analyses by the [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]] (INR) of the [[U.S. Department of State]] define the political problems from a viewpoint different from that of the military.<ref name=INR-VN4>{{citation\n | title = Vietnam 1961-1968 as interpreted in INR's Production\n | contribution = IV.

It saw the Minh-Tho government  as enjoying an initial period of popular support as it removed some of the most disliked aspects of the Di\u1ec7m government. During this time, the increase in VC attacks was largely coincidental; they were resulting from the VC having reached a level of offensive capability rather than capitalizing on the overthrow of Di\u1ec7m.\n\nContrary to the INR analysis, [[Douglas Pike]] said that there was a substantial defection from the NLF after the overthrow of Di\u1ec7m, especially among [[Cao \u0110\u00e0i]] that had considered themselves as especially persecuted by Di\u1ec7m. Pike believed that a portion of the NLF was variously anti-Di\u1ec7m, or simply in search of political power, rather than Communist. When this part left, the NLF came much more under Hanoi's control.<ref name=Pike-Oral>{{citation\n | date = June 4, 1981\n | title = Oral History interview of [[Douglas Pike]]\n | author = Ted Gittinger\n | publisher = Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library}}, p. I-8</ref>\n\nDuring this period, INR observed, in a December 23 paper, the U.S. needed to reexamine its strategy focused on the [[Strategic Hamlet Program]], since it was getting much more accurate &mdash; if pessimistic &mdash; from the new government than it had from Di\u1ec7m. Secretary McNamara, however, testified to the House Armed Service Committee, on December 27, that only a maximum effort of American power could salvage the situation. Two days later, the Minh-Tho government was overthrown.<ref name=INR-VN4 />\n\nINR looked pessimistically at Kh\u00e1nh, who claimed that Minh had been making overtures to Hanoi for a neutralist settlement.<ref>INR-VN4, p. 12</ref> It was the contemporary assessment of INR that Minh had been making no such overtures, although this is contradicted by Secretary McNamara's 1999 book.\n\nWhether or not Kh\u00e1nh was right about Minh's plan, INR judged Minh as motivated primarily by personal ambition. Where Minh had tried to form a government of technicians, Kh\u00e1nh, admittedly with U.S. urging, brought in political elements, which quickly led to factionalism not present under Minh's period of good will. INR saw Kh\u00e1nh as having a contradictory policy in terms of U.S. goals: while he did increase security, he did so by means judged counterproductive in broadening the political base of the government.\n\nINR considered new student demonstrations, in April 1964, as the first warning of a new wave of protest, which became more manifest in August.  Those demonstrations contained anti-American messages, but INR was uncertain if they represented true anti-Americanism, or simply opposition to American support of Kh\u00e1nh. As opposed to Di\u1ec7m's catastrophic handling of the Buddhist crisis, Kh\u00e1nh responded with moderation, and, on August 28, INR concluded he was, in fact, improving the political situation. Evidence cited including the dissolution, in the next two weeks, of Minh's military triumvirate and Minh's election as chairman of a new Provisional Steering Committee, as well as release of some jailed generals that had supported Minh. INR suggested that Kh\u00e1nh may have caused the unrest by supporting the genuinely popular Kh\u00e1nh. Kh\u00e1nh, however, promptly sent Minh to exile in Thailand.\n\nNote that Minh was exiled within the same month as the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]], with its obvious ramifications of increased U.S. involvement.\n\n===Communist strategy===\nThe North had clearly defined political objectives, and a grand strategy, involving military, diplomatic, covert action and psychological operations to achieve those objectives. Whether or not one agreed with those objectives, there was a clear relationship between long-term goals and short-term actions. Its military first focused on guerilla  and raid warfare in the south (i.e., Mao's \"Phase I\"), simultaneously improving the air defensives of the north.  By the mid-sixties, they were operating in [[battalion]] and larger military formation that would remain in contact as long as the correlation of forces was to their advantage, and then retreat &mdash; Mao's \"Phase II\".\n\nIn the Viet Cong, and in the North Vietnam regular army ([[PAVN]]), every unit had political and military cadre to ensure ''dau tranh'' was carried out.\n\nGuerilla attacks increased in the early 1960s, at the same time as the new [[John F. Kennedy]] administration made Presidential decisions to increase its influence. Di\u1ec7m, as other powers were deciding their policies, was clearly facing disorganized attacks and internal political dissent. There were unquestioned conflicts between the government, dominated by minority Northern Catholics, and both the majority Buddhists and minorities such as the [[Montagnard (Vietnam)|Montagnard]]s, [[Cao \u0110\u00e0i]], and [[H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o]]. These conflicts were exploited, initially at the level of propaganda and recruiting, by stay-behind [[Viet Minh]] receiving orders from the North.\n\n==Events==\n\n===1959===\nDi\u1ec7m, in early 1959, felt under attack and broadly reacted against all forms of opposition, which was presented as a  \"Communist Denunciation Campaign\", as well as some significant and unwelcome rural resettlement, the latter to be distinguished from land reform.\n\n====Increased activity in Laos====\nIn May, the North Vietnamese made the commitment to an armed overthrow of the South, creating the [[559th Transportation Group]], named after the creation date, to operate the land route that became known as the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. Additional transportation groups were created for maritime supply to the South: Group 759 ran sea-based operations, while Group 959 supplied the Pathet Lao by land routes.<ref name=Goscha2002>{{citation \n | first1 = Christopher E. | last1 = Goscha\n | title = The Maritime Nature of the Wars for Vietnam (1945-75)\n | url = http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/vietnamcenter/events/2002_Symposium/2002Papers_files/goscha.htm\n | date = April 2002\n | conference = 4th Triennial Vietnam Symposium, Texas Tech University Vietnam Center}}</ref>  Group 959 also provided secure communications to the Pathet Lao.<ref name=NSAVN-3>{{citation\n | chapter = Chapter 3 - \"To Die in the South\": SIGINT, the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and the Infiltration Problem, [Deleted] 1968\n | title = Spartans in Darkness: American SIGINT and the Indochina War, 1945-1975\n | first1 = Robert J. | last1 =Hanyok\n | publisher = Center for Cryptologic History, National Security Agency\n | year = 2002\n | url = http://www.fas.org/irp/nsa/spartans/chapter3.pdf }}</ref>\n\nThe Pathet Lao both were operating against the Laotian government, but also working with NVA Group 959 to supply the southern insurgency; much of the original Trail was in Laos, first supplying the Pathet Lao.

U.S. military assistance could also be considered a violation of the Geneva agreement, although North Vietnam, and its suppliers, were equally in violation.\n\nIn July, CIA sent a unit from [[United States Army Special Forces]], who arrived on CIA proprietary airline [[Air America (airline)|Air America]], wearing civilian clothes and having no obvious US connection. These soldiers led [[Miao people|Miao]] and [[Hmong people#The \"Secret War\"|Hmong]] tribesmen against Communist forces. The covert program was called [[Operation Hotfoot]].

He also requested [[United States Army Special Forces]] (SF) mobile training teams (MTT) to assist in training ARVN units in [[counterinsurgency]].\n\nOn 8 July, the MAAG-V headquarters at Bien Hoa was raided by the Viet Cong; two South Vietnamese guards were killed along with two advisors, Major Dale Buis and Master Sergeant Chester Ovnand. These were the first American battle deaths in the Vietnam War.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">Vietnam Perspectives - Vol. 1, No. 1, Aug., 1965. Chronology of Events Relative to Vietnam, 1954-1965, p. 20. https://www.jstor.org/stable/30182459</ref>\n\n====Structural barriers to effectiveness of RVN forces====\nWhen the MAAG was instructed to improve the effectiveness of the RVN, the most fundamental problem was that the Di\u1ec7m government had organized the military and paramilitary forces not for effectiveness, but for political control and patronage. The most obvious manifestation of Di\u1ec7m's goal was that there were two parallel organizations, the regular military under the  Department of National Defense and the local defense forces under the Ministry of the Interior. Di\u1ec7m was the only person who could give orders to both.\n\n=====Command and control=====\nPresident Di\u1ec7m appointed the Secretary of State for National Defense and the Minister of the Interior. The Defense Secretary directed of General Staff chief and several special sub-departments. The General staff chief, in turn, commanded the Joint General Staff (JGS), which was both the top-level staff and the top of the military chain of command.\n\nThere were problems with the military structure, even before considering the paramilitary forces under the Interior Ministry. The JGS itself had conflicting components with no clear authority. For example, support for the Air Force came both from a Director of Air Technical Service and a Deputy Chief of Air Staff for Mat\u00e9riel. The Director was, in principle, under the Chief of Staff, but actually reported to the Director General of Administration, Budget, and Comptroller for fiscal matters).\n\nCombat units also had conflicting chains of command. A division commander might receive orders both from the corps-level tactical commander who actually carried out the [[operational art]] role of [[corps]] commanders in most militaries, but also from the regional commander of the home base of the division &mdash; even if the division was operating in another area. The chiefs of branches of service (e.g., [[infantry]], [[artillery]]), who in most armies were responsible only for preparation and training of personnel of their branch, and orders only before they were deployed, would give direct operational orders to units in the field.\n\nDi\u1ec7m himself, who had no significant military background, could be the worst [[micromanager]] of all, getting on a radio in the garden of the Presidential Palace, and issuing orders to regiments, bypassing the Department of National Defense, Joint General Staff, operational commanders, and division commanders. He also consciously played subordinates against one another to avoid the formation of opposition; the [[Battle of Ap Bac]] was a defeat caused by a lack of unity of command, with conflicts between the military commander and province chief.\n\nIn fairness to Di\u1ec7m, [[Lyndon Johnson]] and his political advisors would do detailed air operations planning for attacks in the North, with no input from experienced air officers. [[Henry Kissinger]], in the [[Mayaguez incident]], got onto the tactical radio net and confused the local commanders with German-accented and obscure commands.  Johnson and Kissinger did have had more military experience than Di\u1ec7m; Johnson had briefly served in the Naval Reserve, and Kissinger lectured on politics at the end of World War II and the start of the Occupation, with a high status but an actual rank of Private, United States Army.  Di\u1ec7m had never put on a uniform.\n\n\"The Department of National Defense and most of the central organizations and the ministerial services were located in downtown Saigon, while the General Staff (less air and navy elements) was inefficiently located in a series of company-size troop barracks on the edge of the city. The chief of the General Staff was thus removed several miles from the Department of National Defense. The navy and air staffs were also separately located in downtown Saigon. With such a physical layout, staff action and decision-making unduly delayed on even the simplest of matters.\n\n\"The over-all ministerial structure described above was originally set up by the French and slightly modified by presidential decree on 3 October 1957. Military Assistance Advisory Group, Vietnam, had proposed a different command structure which would have placed the ministry and the \"general staff\" in closer proximity both physically and in command relationship.\" Di\u1ec7m, however,  made a practice of keeping individuals or small groups from having too much authority.\n\nThe chain of command of both the Civil Guard and Self-Defense Corps, went from the Ministry of the Interior to the province chiefs, district chiefs, and village councils. Even though the province chiefs and district chiefs were often military officers, ARVN units operating in a province or district could not give orders to these units. Instead, they had to pass a request through military channels to the Ministry of Defense in Saigon. If the officials there agreed, they would convey the request to their counterparts in the Ministry of the Interior, who would then send orders down its chain of command to the local units.\n\n=====Regular military=====\n*Three corps headquarters and a special military district:<ref>Collins, pp. 9-10</ref>\n**I Corps at [[Da Nang]] for the northern and central areas; the Central Highlands were separate\n**II Corps at [[Pleiku]] for the Central Highlands provinces\n**III Corps at [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] for the southern part of the country\n**Saigon city  special military district.\n*Seven divisions of 10,450 men\n**three infantry regiments\n**artillery battalion\n**mortar battalion\n**engineer battalion\n**company-size support elements\n*Airborne group of five battalion groups\n*four armored cavalry \"regiments\" (approximately the equivalent of a U.S. Army cavalry squadron)\n**one squadron (U.S. troop) of M24 light tanks\n**two squadrons of M8 self-propelled 75-mm. howitzers\n*Eight independent artillery battalions with U.S. 105-mm, and 155-mm. pieces.\n\n=====Local defense forces=====\nCreated by presidential decree in April 1955, and originally under the direct control of President Di\u1ec7m, with control passed to the Ministry of the Interior in September 1958, the Civil Guard was made up of wartime paramilitary veterans. Its major duty was to relieve the ARVN of static security missions, freeing it for mobile operations, with additional responsibility for local intelligence collection and [[counterintelligence]]. in 1956, had 68,000 men organized into companies and platoons, the Civil Guard was represented by two to eight companies in each province. It had a centrally controlled reserve of eight mobile battalions of 500 men each.\n\nOperating on a local basis since 1955 and formally created in 1956, the Self-Defense corps was a village-level police organization, for protection against intimidation and subversion. It put units of 4-10 men into villages of 1,000 or more residents. In 1956, it had 48,000 non-uniformed troops armed with French weapons. The Self-Defense Corps, like the Civil Guard, was established to free regular forces from internal security duties by providing a police organization at village level to protect the population from subversion and intimidation. Units of four to ten men each were organized in villages of 1,000 or more inhabitants.\n\nThe Civil Guard and the Self-Defense Corps were poorly trained and ill-equipped to perform their missions, and by 1959 their numbers had declined to about 46,000 and 40,000, respectively.\n\n===1960===\nAs mentioned in the introduction to this section, the U.S. was urging the RVN to revise its parallel province/district command and military operations command structure; the Counterinsurgency Plan (CIP) was the first of several such proposals.\n\n====Laotian operations====\nAfter the 180-day assignment of the Special Forces personnel in Laos, the name changed to Operation White Star, under COL [[Arthur Simons|Arthur \"Bull\" Simons]].\n\n====Beginning of Phase II raids====\nOn 25 January 1960, a Communist force  of 300 to 500 men escalated with a direct raid on an ARVN base at [[T\u00e2y Ninh]], killing 23 soldiers and taking large quantities of munitions. Four days later, a guerilla group seized a town for several hours, and stole cash from a French citizen. These were still in the first Maoist stage, as raids rather than hit-and-run battles.  Still, larger guerilla forces broke lines of communications within areas of South Vietnam.\n\nThere was uncertainty, expressed by Bernard Fall and in a March U.S. intelligence assessment, that there were distinct plans to conduct larger-scale operations  \"under the flag of the People's Liberation Movement\", which was identified as \"red, with a blue star.\" It was uncertain if their intent was to continue to build bases in the Mekong Delta, or to isolate Saigon. The ''Pentagon Papers'' stated the guerillas were establishing three options, of which they could exercise one or more;\n# incite an ARVN revolt\n#set up a popular front government in the lower Delta\n#force the GVN into such repressive countermeasures that popular uprisings will follow.\n\n====South Vietnam corruption breeds discontent====\n{{main|Caravelle Manifesto|1960 South Vietnamese coup attempt}}\n{{see also|1962 South Vietnamese Independence Palace bombing}}\nOn April 1960, eighteen distinguished nationalists in South Vietnam sent a petition to President Di\u1ec7m advocating that he reform his rigid, family-run, and increasingly corrupt, government. Di\u1ec7m ignored their advice and instead closed several opposition newspapers and arrests journalists and intellectuals. On 5 May 1960, MAAG strength was increased from 327 to 685 personnel.\n\n====Formation of the NLF====\nIn December, the  [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam]] (NLF) formally declared its existence, although it did not hold its first full congress until 1962.\n\nThe NLF platform recognized some of the internal stresses under the Di\u1ec7m government, and put language in its platform  to create autonomous regions in minority areas and for the abolition of the \"U.S.-Di\u00eam clique's present policy of ill-treatment and forced assimilation of the minority nationalities\".<ref name=HRW-RoM-Ch03>{{citation\n | title = Repression of Montagnards:  Conflicts over Land and Religion in  Vietnam's Central Highlands\n | author = Human Rights Watch\n | contribution = III.

In the early 1960s, NLF political organizers went to the Montagnard areas in the Central Highlands, and worked both to increase alienation from the GVN and directly recruit supporters.\n\n===1961: Slow U.S. engagement===\nNot surprisingly, with a change in U.S. administration, there were changes in policy, and also continuations of some existing activities. There were changes in outlook. \nDefense Secretary [[Robert S. McNamara]] (in office 1961-68) told President [[John F. Kennedy]] (in office 1961-63) in 1961 it was \"absurd to think that a nation of 20 million people can be subverted by 15-20 thousand active guerrillas if the government and the people of that country do not wish to be subverted.\"<ref>Rusk/McNamara memorandum. Nov. 11, 1961, [http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon2/pent3.htm online at ''Pentagon Papers'']</ref>  McNamara, a manufacturing executive and expert in statistical management, had no background in [[guerilla warfare]] or other than Western culture, and rejected advice from area specialists and military officers. He preferred to consult with his personal team, often called the \"Whiz Kids\"; his key foreign policy advisor was a law professor, John McNaughton, while economist Alain Enthoven was perhaps his closest colleague.\n\nStill trying to resolve the problems of GVN conflicting command, a new reorganizational proposal, the \"Geographically Phased Plan\". The goal was to have a coherent national plan, which was, in 1962, to be expressed as the [[Strategic Hamlet Program]].\n\n====Kennedy pushes for covert operations against the North====\nOn January 28, 1961, shortly after his inauguration, John F. Kennedy told a [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] meeting that he wanted covert operations launched against North Vietnam, in retaliation for their equivalent actions in the South.<ref name=Shultz>{{citation|\n title = the Secret War against Hanoi: the untold story of spies, saboteurs, and covert warriors in North Vietnam\n | first = Richard H., Jr. | last = Shultz |author-link=Richard H. Shultz\n | publisher = Harper Collins Perennial | year = 2000}}, p. 3</ref> It is not suggested that this was an inappropriate decision, but the existence of covert operations against the North, has to be understood in analyzing later events, especially the [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident]].\n\nEven earlier, he issued National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 2, directing the military to prepare counterinsurgency forces, although not yet targeting the North.<ref name=Whitcomb2005>{{citation\n | date = December 2005\n | volume = 88\n | issue = 12\n | title=Farm Gate: In 1961, the Air Force took its first step into a very long war.\n | first = Darrel | last = Whitcomb | journal = Air Force Magazine\n | url = http://www.afa.org/magazine/Dec2005/1205farmgate.html}}</ref>\n\nKennedy discovered that little had progressed by mid-March, and issued National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 28, ordering the CIA respond to his desire to launch guerilla operations against the North. Herb Weisshart, deputy chief of the Saigon CIA station, observed the actual CIA action plan was \"very modest\". Given the Presidential priority, Weisshart said it was modest because [[William Colby]], then Saigon station chief, said it would consume too many resources needed in the South. He further directed, in April, a presidential task force to draft a \"Program of Action for Vietnam\".\n\nIn April, the [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] of Cuba, under the CIA, had failed, and Kennedy lost confidence in the CIA's paramilitary operations. Kennedy himself had some responsibility for largely cutting the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] out of operational planning. The JCS believed the operation was ill-advised, but, if it was to be done, American air support was essential. Kennedy, however, had made a number of changes to create [[plausible deniability]], only allowing limited air strikes by CIA-sponsored pilots acting as Cuban dissidents. After it was learned that the main strike had left behind a few jet aircraft, he refused a follow-up strike; those aircraft savaged the poorly organized amphibious ships and their propeller-driven air support.\n\nThe [[U.S. Air Force]], however, responded to NSAM 2 by creating, on April 14, 1961, the 4400th Combat Crew Training Squadron (CCTS), code named \"Jungle Jim.\" The unit, of about 350 men, had 16 [[C-47]] transports, eight [[A-26 Invader|B-26]] bombers, and eight [[North American T-28 Trojan|T-28]] trainers (equipped for ground attack), with an official of training indigenous air forces in counterinsurgency and conduct air operations. A volunteer unit, they would deploy in October, to begin FARM GATE missions.\n\nThe task force reported back in May, with a glum assessment of the situation in the South, and a wide-ranging but general plan of action, which became NSAM 52. In June, Kennedy issued a set of NSAMs transferring paramilitary operations to the Department of Defense.<ref>Shultz 2000, pp. 17\u201323</ref> These transfers of responsibility should be considered not only in respect to the specific operations against the North, but in the level of covert military operation in the South in the upcoming months. This transfer also cut the experienced MG [[Edward Lansdale]] out of the process, as while he was a [[U.S. Air Force]] officer, the military saw him as belonging to CIA.\n\n====Intelligence support====\nAlso in May, the first U.S. [[signals intelligence]] unit, from the [[United States Army Security Agency|Army Security Agency]] under [[National Security Agency]] control, entered Vietnam operating under the cover name \"3rd Radio Research Unit.\" Organizationally, it provided support to MAAG-V, and trained ARVN personnel, the latter within security constraints. The general policy, throughout the war, was that ARVN intelligence personnel were not given access above the collateral SECRET (i.e., with no access to material with the additional special restrictions of \"code word\" [[communications intelligence]]  (CCO or SI). {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nTheir principal initial responsibility was [[direction finding]] of Viet Cong radio transmitters, which they started doing from vehicles equipped with sensors. On December 22, 1961, an Army Security Agency soldier, SP4 James T. Davis, was killed in an ambush leading an ARVN squad on one of these direction finding missions. After Johnson became President of the United States several years later, he referred to Davis in a speech as the first American killed in Vietnam; in reality, there had been fifteen battle deaths before Davis.<ref>James Thomas Davis - The Virtual Wall http://www.virtualwall.org/dd/DavisJT01a.htm</ref>\n\n====Covert U.S. air support enters the South====\nMore U.S. personnel, officially designated as advisors, arrived in the South and took an increasingly active, although covert, role. In October, a [[U.S. Air Force]] special operations squadron, part of the 4400th CCTS deployed to SVN, officially in a role of advising and training. The aircraft were painted in South Vietnamese colors, and the aircrew wore uniforms without insignia and without U.S. ID. Sending military forces to South Vietnam was a violation of the Geneva Accords of 1954, and the U.S. wanted [[plausible deniability]].\n\nThe deployment package consisted of 155 airmen, eight T-28s, and four modified and redesignated SC-47s and subsequently received B-26s. U.S. personnel flew combat as long as a VNAF person was aboard. FARMGATE stayed covert until after the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]].<ref name=Whitcomb2005 />\n\n====Building the South Vietnamese Civil Irregular Defense Groups====\nUnder the operational control of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]],<ref name=McClintock2002Ch09>{{citation\n | title = Instruments of Statecraft: U.S. Guerilla Warfare, Counterinsurgency, and Counterterrorism, 1940-1990\n | contribution = Chapter 9, The Heart of Doctrine\n | url = http://www.statecraft.org/chapter9.html\n | year = 2002 \n | first = Michael | last = McClintock\n | publisher = Pantheon Books, Division of Random House\n}}</ref> initial [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] involvement came in October, with the Rhade.<ref name=Kelly1973>{{citation\n | title = Vietnam Studies: U.S. Army Special Forces 1961-1971\n | id = CMH Publication 90-23\n | publisher = Center of Military History, Department of the Army\n | year = 1973\n | url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/Vietnam/90-23/90-23C.htm\n | first = Francis John | last = Kelly}}, p. 4</ref> The Civilian Irregular Defense Groups (CIDG), were under [[Central Intelligence Agency]] operational control until  July 1, 1963, when MACV took control.<ref>Collins 1974, p. 70</ref> Army documents refer to control by \"CAS Saigon\", a cover name for the CIA station. According to Kelly, the SF and CIA rationale for establishing the CIDG program with the Montagnards was that minority participation would broaden the GVN counterinsurgency program, but, more critically, \n\n<blockquote>the Montagnards and other minority groups were prime targets for Communist propaganda, partly because of their dissatisfaction with the Vietnamese government, and it was important to prevent the Viet Cong from recruiting them and taking complete control of their large and strategic land holdings.<ref>Kelly 1974, p. 19</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt was in mid-November when Kennedy decided to take on operational as well as advisory roles. Under U.S. [[U.S. foreign military assistance organizations#doctrine for assisting other countries|a Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG)]], such as the senior U.S. military organization in Vietnam, is a support and advisory organization. A Military Assistance Command (MAC) is designed to carry out MAAG duties, but also to command combat troops.<ref>Eckhardt, p. 25</ref> There was considerable discussion about the reporting structure of this of the organization: a separate theater reporting to the [[National Command Authority]] or part of [[United States Pacific Command]].\n\n====First Honolulu Conference====\nAfter meetings in Vietnam by GEN Taylor, the Secretaries of State and Defense issued a set of recommendations, on November 11.<ref name=RuskMac>{{citation\n | title = United States National Interests in South Viet-Nam; report to the President\n | first1 = Dean | last1 = Rusk |first2 = Robert | last2 = McNamara\n | date = November 11, 1961\n | url = http://vietnam.vassar.edu/doc7.html}}</ref> Kennedy accepted all except the use of large U.S. combat forces.\n\nMcNamara held the first Honolulu Conference, at [[United States Pacific Command]] headquarters, with the Vietnam commanders present. He addressed short-term possibilities, urging concentration on stabilizing one province: \"I'll guarantee it (the money and equipment) provided you have a plan based on one province. Take one place, sweep it and hold it in a plan.\" Or, put another way, let us demonstrate that in some place, in some way, we can achieve demonstrable gains.<ref name=\"PntV1Ch05Sec0314-346 2\">{{citation\n | title =The Pentagon Papers, Gravel Edition\n | volume=2\n | contribution = Chapter 2, \"The Strategic Hamlet Program, 1961-1963\"\n | pages=128\u2013159\n | url = http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon2/pent4.htm}}</ref>\n\n====First U.S. direct support to an ARVN combat operation====\nOn 11 December 1961 the United States aircraft carrier ''USNS Card'' docked in downtown Saigon with 82 U.

It  was the first time U.S. forces directly and overtly supported ARVN units in combat, although the American forces did not directly attack the guerillas. Approximately 1,000 Vietnamese paratroopers were airlifted into a suspected Viet Cong headquarters complex about ten miles west of the Vietnamese capital, achieving tactical surprise and capturing a radio station.<ref name=Tolson1974>{{citation\n | id = Tolson 1974\n | title = Vietnam Studies: Airmobility 1961-1971\n | first = John J. | last = Tolson\n | year = 1974 | publisher = Center of Military History, Department of the Army\n | url =http://www.history.army.mil/books/Vietnam/Airmobility/airmobility-fm.html}}, p. 4</ref>\n\n===1962: Getting in deeper===\nFrom the U.S. perspective, the [[Strategic Hamlet Program]] was the consensus approach to pacifying the countryside.<ref name=PntV1Ch05Sec0314-346 /> There was a sense, however, that this was simply not a high priority for Di\u1ec7m, who considered his power base to be in the cities. The Communists, willing to fill a vacuum, became more and more active in rural areas where the GVN was invisible, irrelevant, or actively a hindrance.\n\n====Special Forces operations====\nIn 1962, the U.S. Military Assistance Command\u2013Vietnam (MACV) established Army Special Forces camps near villages. The Americans wanted a military presence there to block the infiltration of enemy forces from Laos, to provide a base for launching patrols into Laos to monitor the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and to serve as a western anchor for defense along the DMZ.<ref name=HN-KS>{{citation\n | title =  Battle of Khe Sanh: Recounting the Battle's Casualties\n | first = Peter | last = Brush \n | url = http://www.historynet.com/battle-of-khe-sanh-recounting-the-battlescasualties.htm}}</ref> These defended villages were not part of the Strategic Hamlet Program, but did provide examples that were relevant.\n\n====U.S. ground command structure established====\nU.S. command structures continued to emerge. On February 8, [[Paul Harkins|Paul D. Harkins]], then Deputy Commanding General, U.S. Army Pacific, under Pacific Command, was promoted to [[general]] and assigned to command the new [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] (MAC-V).\n\nMilitary Assistance Command-Thailand was created on May 15, 1962, but reported to Harkins at MAC-V. In a departure from usual practice, the MAAG was retained as an organization subordinate to MAC-V, rather than being absorbed into it. The MAAG continued to command U.S. advisors and direct support to the ARVN. At first, MAC-V delegated control of U.S. combat units to the MAAG. While it was not an immediate concern, MAC-V never controlled all the Air Force and Navy units that would operate in Vietnam, but from outside its borders. These remained under the control of Pacific Command, or, in some cases, the [[Strategic Air Command]].\n\nNo regular ARVN units were under the command of U.S. military commanders, although there were exceptions for irregular units under Special Forces. Indeed, there could be situations where, in a joint operation, U.S. combat troops were under a U.S. commander, while the ARVN units were under an ARVN officer with a U.S. advisor. Relationships in particular operations often were more a matter of personalities and politics rather than ideal command. U.S. troops also did not report to ARVN officers; while many RVN officers had their post through political connections, others would have been outstanding commanders in any army.\n\nAt the same time, the U.S. was beginning to explore withdrawing forces.<ref name=PntPapV4Ch2-160-200>{{citation\n | title = The Pentagon Papers, Gravel Edition, Volume 2\n | contribution = Chapter 3, \"Phased Withdrawal of U.S. Forces, 1962-1964\", pp. 160-200.\n | url = http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon2/pent5.htm}}</ref>\n\n====Intelligence support refines====\n{{See also|Signals intelligence in the Cold War}}\nThe USMC 1st Composite Radio Company deployed, on January 2, 1962, to Pleiku, South Vietnam as Detachment One.

It remains unclear as to what extent the South Vietnamese were exploring solutions based a neutralist Vietnam, but this apparently existed at some level, without U.S. knowledge.\n\n===Organizations and personnel===\nOrganizations and commands would change with time. In January, for example, Major General Don became Commander-in-Chief of the RVN armed forces, GEN [[William Westmoreland]] was named deputy to GEN [[Paul Harkins]] to replace him later. In a structural reorganization, the ARVN made the Saigon Special Region the [[III Corps tactical zone]];<ref name=MACV-Chron64>{{citation\n | url=http://www.carrscompendiums.com/ccSEA/Chronology/MACV_1964.html\n | author = Military Assistance Command, Vietnam\n | title = MACV Command History Chronology - 1964}}</ref> the former III Corps for the Mekong Delta became [[IV Corps tactical zone]]\n\n===January 1963: Question of ARVN effectiveness===\nSouth Vietnamese forces, with U.S. advisors, took severe defeats at the [[Battle of Ap Bac]] in January, and the [[Battle of Go Cong]] in September.<ref name=Sheehan>{{citation\n | first = Neil | last = Sheehan\n | title = A Bright and Shining Lie\n | publisher = Vintage | year = 1989}}</ref>  This has been considered the trigger for an increasingly skeptical, although small, American press corps in Vietnam. Ap Bac was of particular political sensitivity, as [[John Paul Vann]], a highly visible American officer, was the advisor, and the U.S. press took note of what he considered to be ARVN shortcomings.\n\nWhile the [[Buddhist crisis]] and [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|military coup]] that ended with the killing of Di\u1ec7m was an obvious major event, it was by no means the only event of the year. In keeping with the President's expressed desires, covert operations against the North were escalated. Of course, the assassination of Kennedy himself brought [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]], with a different philosophy toward the war. Kennedy was an activist, but had a sense of unconventional warfare and geopolitics, and, as is seen in the documentary record, discussed policy development with a wide range of advisors, specifically including military leaders although he distrusted the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]].<ref name=McMaster>{{citation\n | first = H.

April 1963. For unclear reasons, the central government ordered the provincial authorities to enforce a ban on the display of all religious flags. This ban had rarely been enforced, but, since the order went out shortly before the major festival, Vesek (informally called Buddha's Birthday), which fell on May 8, many Buddhists perceived this as a direct attack on their customs.\n\nIn May, a government paramilitary unit fired into demonstrators. As part of a wave of protests, a Buddhist monk immolated himself; photographs of his body, apparently seated calmly in the lotus position as he burned to death, drew worldwide attention. By early June, the government was negotiating with the Buddhists as it had never done, with Vice President Tho, a Buddhist, apparently being an effective negotiator in spite of Di\u1ec7m's brother and political advisor Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu's announcing \"if the Buddhists want to have another barbecue, I will be glad to supply the gasoline\".\n\n====May 1963 Honolulu conference; covert warfare a major issue====\nAt the May 6 Honolulu conference, the decision was made to increase, as the President had been pushing, covert operations against the North. A detailed plan for covert operations, Pacific Command Operations Plan 34A (OPPLAN 34A) went to GEN Taylor, now [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], did not approve it until September 9. Shultz suggests the delay had three aspects:\n#Washington was preoccupied with the Buddhist crisis\n#MACV had no established covert operations force, so even if he approved a plan, there was no one to execute it\n#Taylor, although a distinguished Airborne (paratroopers once being believed special operators) officer, disagreed with Kennedy's emphasis on covert operations, did not have the appropriate resources in the Department of Defense, and he did not believe it was a proper job for soldiers.\n#Di\u1ec7m, fighting for survival, was not interested\n\nIt is unclear if Taylor did not believe covert operations should not be attempted at all, or if he regarded it as a CIA mission. If the latter, Kennedy would have been unlikely to support him, given the President's loss of confidence after the [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] fiasco.<ref>Shultz, pp. 32\u201333.</ref>\n\n====Interim government====\n{{main|1963 South Vietnamese coup|Arrest and assassination of Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m|Reaction to the 1963 South Vietnamese coup}}\nDi\u1ec7m was overthrown and killed on November 1.\n\nSecretary of State Rusk counseled a delay in meeting with the coup leadership, which had started calling itself the \"Revolutionary Committee\", to avoid appearance of it being a U.S. coup. Apparently unknown to the U.S., the plotters had negotiated, beforehand, with vice-president [[Nguyen Ngoc Tho]], who, himself a Buddhist, had been the chief government negotiator in the Buddhist crisis. In the immediate followup of the coup, Di\u1ec7m's cabinet were told to resign, and there were no reprisals. Tho, however, was negotiating with the committee, especially the most powerful general, [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] knowing that the military leaders wanted him in the new civilian government.\n\nGenerals [[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n \u0110\u00f4n]], chief of staff, and [[L\u00ea V\u0103n Kim]], his deputy,  called at the [[US Embassy, Saigon]], on November 3.<ref name=PntPapV2Ch4-2320276>{{citation\n | title = The Pentagon Papers, Gravel Edition, Volume 2\n | contribution = Chapter 4, \"The Overthrow of Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m\", May\u2013November 1963, Section 2, pp. 232\u2013276\n | url = http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon2/pent7.htm}}</ref> Explaining that Minh was, as they spoke, with Tho, they said would be a two-tiered government structure with a military committee presided over by General D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh overseeing a regular cabinet that would be mostly civilian with Tho as prime minister.\n\nOn the 4th, Lodge and Conein met with Lodge, Generals Minh and Don. Afterwards, Lodge reported, \"Minh seemed tired and somewhat frazzled; obviously a good, well-intentioned man. Will he be strong enough to get on top of things?\" The new government was announced on the 6th: General Minh was Chairman, Don and Dinh were Deputy Chairmen, and nine other generals, including Kim, Khi\u00eam, \"little\" Minh, Chieu, and Thieu were members.  General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh]], the commander of [[II Corps (South Vietnam)|II Corps]] tactical zone in central Vietnam, was not in the government.\n\n====After two assassinations====\nKennedy and Di\u1ec7m both died in November 1963. [[Lyndon Johnson]] became the new President of the United States. Johnson was far more focused on domestic politics than the international activist, Kennedy. Some of the Kennedy team left quickly, while others, sometimes surprisingly given extremely different personalities, stayed on; the formal and logical [[Robert McNamara]] quickly bonded with the emotional and deal-making Johnson.\n\nMcNamara was insistent that a rational enemy would not accept the massive casualties that indeed were inflicted on the Communists. The enemy, however, was willing to accept those casualties.<ref name=Adams>{{citation\n | author = Adams, Sam\n | title = War of Numbers: An Intelligence Memoiree\n | publisher = Steerforth Press | year= 1994}}</ref> McNamara was insistent that the enemy would comply with his concepts of cost-effectiveness, of which Ho and Giap were unaware.

Roe had made arrangement for both parties to return to the [[Swan River Colony]] via an alternative route. The route was intended to join the settlements of King George Sound, [[York, Western Australia|York]] and the Swan River Colony along with the newly established settlement of [[Williams, Western Australia|Williams]]. This expedition passed through the area of Avondale sighting the [[Dale River (Western Australia)|Dale River]] and a granite hill that Roe name Bald Hill on 27 December. Bald Hill was to become the primary reference point for surveying the region.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nIn 1836, the surveyor [[Thomas Watson (surveyor)|Thomas Watson]] returned to area and used Bald Hill as the principal trigonometric reference. Watson was to map out a number of lots in the area including the western boundary for Beverley town site. Two of the lots surveyed were Avon location 14 with {{convert|5000|acre|km2}}, and Avon location K with {{convert|4000|acre|km2}}; location 14 was given to Captain Mark Currie, Fremantle Harbour Master, while location K was given to Stirling. Stirling as Governor and Currie as harbour master were not paid salaries by the colony but given land grants as compensation for their services. In 1978, surveyors using current equipment were engaged to determine the exact location of these original holdings, and commented on the remarkable accuracy of Watson's survey 142 years before.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nCurrie sold his grant of land to a [[Nicholas Carey]] in September 1838 for \u20a4330. Carey entered into a lease agreement in December with Governor Stirling for his grant, which included Carey purchasing the property at the end of the lease for \u20a4750 in 1846. Carey also purchased {{convert|3000|acre|km2}} to west of location 14 he also received an additional grant of land in 1849. With all the land in the vee formed by the [[Avon River (Western Australia)|Avon River]] and the Dale River the property was now {{convert|13330|acre|km2}} in size and was named ''Avondale Estate''. During the late 1840s Carey moved to [[Guernsey]] leaving Avondale to be operated by an unknown caretaker.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\n[[File:Avondale ag rs gnangarra 06.JPG|thumb|250px|Inside the stables at Avondale]]\nUpon Carey's death in March 1889, Avondale was inherited by his 16-year-old [[Nephew|grand nephew]] [[William Herbert deLisle]]. deLisle arrived and took up residence there in 1893, and assumed the land title in 1894. Avondale had been a pastoral property until deLisle's arrival, over the next ten years sections of the estate were sold off to fund its development. During this period, the house was expanded and the stable built, which included 20 horse stalls with hollow walls and an overhead loft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/A%20Reg/Avondale%20Res%20Stn%20(I).PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901160519/http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/A%20Reg/Avondale%20Res%20Stn%20(I).PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-09-01 |title=Interim Entry No. 05566 Register of Heritage Places |accessdate=2007-10-12 |format=pdf |work=[[Heritage Council of Western Australia]] }}</ref> The hollow walls enable feed from the loft to gravitate directly to the feed bins in each stall.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nThe remaining {{convert|5232|acre|km2|1}} were sold to [[William James Butcher]] and [[Charles John Hunt Butcher]] in 1904. The brothers purchased adjoining properties adding {{convert|4403|acre|km2|1}} which enlarged Avondale to {{convert|9635|acre|km2|1}}. In 1908 they offered to sell Avondale to the Western Australian Government for \u00a35/10/- per acre. The Government countered with an offer of \u00a35/5/- per acre, which was accepted. Avondale was purchased in March 1910 under the Agricultural Land Purchase act for a total of \u00a351,494/12/6, equivalent to approximately [[Australian Dollar|A$]]5,500,000 in 2006.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\n===1910 to 1924===\n[[File:Avondale ag museum gnangarra 01.jpg|thumb|250px|A display in the museum]]\nEven though the Butcher brothers' farming operations continued until January 1911, the government began preparations for subdivision. John Hall was sent to Avondale in April 1910 to locate all improvements and draw subdivision lines following existing fencing where possible. His arrival sparked considerable controversy, because not only had he set up camp on the golf course but the golf club also had leased {{convert|40|acre|m2}} of Avondale that joined the edge of town. Investigations found that the lease was terminated when the land was sold.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nHall divided Avondale into nine substantial size farms whose boundaries have remained unchanged since, the {{convert|40|acre|m2}} that had been occupied by the golf course was made into small lots which have since been further subdivided. Lands Department accountants calculated that the sale of the lots would return \u00a38,768/3/3 after expenses, and the estate was gazetted and land made available on 21 December 1910. Of the nine substantial lots only four were taken up as settlers were unable to pay the \u00a36 per acre price. Lot 1 was taken up by George Hancock, the father of mining magnate [[Lang Hancock]], and George's brother Richard took up Lot 2. Lot 13 was taken up by G.W. Isbister, and Lot 4 was taken up by former Premier [[Newton Moore|Sir Newton Moore]], who then proceeded to London with the plans. As [[Agent General]] Newton was to offer to prospective settlers lots at Avondale, although a number telegram inquiries to ascertain availability of lots at Avondale were sent, there is no record any lots being allocated in London.<ref name=\"book\" />\n[[File:Avondale ag rs gnangarra 02.JPG|thumb|right|The heritage listed [[weighbridge]] {{circa|1936}} in foreground with the heritage listed {{circa|1927}} silo behind]]\n\nAs none of the remaining 5 substantial lots had been taken up by November 1911, it was suggested that 4 of those remaining be used for an Agricultural College with the Lands Department responsible for continuing to farm the remaining lots. This left one lot known as Drumclyer available, in 1914 a [[Dowerin, Western Australia|Dowerin]] farmer tried to lease Drumclyer after losing his property there from drought, but was unable to negotiate an acceptable rate. In December, the Hancock brothers had abandoned lots 1 & 2, Isbister had also abandoned Lot 13, although it is not known exactly when, leaving only the {{convert|780|acre|km2}} of Lot 4 in private hands. With the outbreak of [[World War I]] the Agricultural College plans were abandoned as well.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nNear the end of 1916, the Beverley community requested that Avondale be subdivided into 20 lots for returning soldiers. It was also suggested that Avondale be a nursery where soldiers are given small allotments and those that succeed are then given larger grants elsewhere in the state. In July 1918, it was decided that Avondale would have 6 lots made available for servicemen from the Beverley area and that {{convert|1740|acre|km2}} which included the area around the homestead was to remain under control of the Lands Department.<ref name=\"assess\">{{cite web |url=http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/A%20-%20A-D/Avondale%20Res%20Stn%20(I-AD).PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831050815/http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/A%20-%20A-D/Avondale%20Res%20Stn%20(I-AD).PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-08-31 |title=Heritage Assessment Document 15/08/2003 |accessdate=2007-10-17 |format=pdf |work=Register of Heritage Places, Heritage Council of Western Australia }}</ref>\n\n==Department of Agriculture==\nThe original homestead block faced an uncertain future for many years, until it was given to the Department of Agriculture in 1924. Initially intended for the production of pure seed [[wheat]] and [[oats]], very little was produced for several years. Avondale was used as an assembly and holding ground for [[dairy]] [[cattle]], prior to them being sent to [[Group Settlement Scheme|group settlers]] in the state's [[South West (Western Australia)|South West]]. During this period, the silo was built with a capacity of 100 tonnes; the silo is now heritage listed.<ref name=\"heritage\" /><ref name=\"book\" />\n\nThe local farming community raised concerns about cattle being unsuitable for the area, while the concerns were not immediately addressed Avondale was turned towards seed production and research.

From 1931 for several years experiments were conducted with the object of determining how to best produce prime export lambs. This investigated various breeds and cross breeds determining that cross-bred ewes where significantly more productive than pure-bred [[Merino]]s.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nIn 1934, Bennetts teamed with state botanist [[Charles Gardner (botanist)|Charles Gardner]] to study the toxic effect of native plants species on sheep. Gardner would collect the plants and supply them fresh to Bennetts who would then feed them to the sheep. They confirmed 24 species of plants as being poisonous, most which were from the native pea genera ''[[Gastrolobium]]'' and ''[[Oxylobium]]''.

Roe had made arrangement for both parties to return to the [[Swan River Colony]] via an alternative route. The route was intended to join the settlements of King George Sound, [[York, Western Australia|York]] and the Swan River Colony along with the newly established settlement of [[Williams, Western Australia|Williams]]. This expedition passed through the area of Avondale sighting the [[Dale River (Western Australia)|Dale River]] and a granite hill that Roe name Bald Hill on 27 December. Bald Hill was to become the primary reference point for surveying the region.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nIn 1836, the surveyor [[Thomas Watson (surveyor)|Thomas Watson]] returned to area and used Bald Hill as the principal trigonometric reference. Watson was to map out a number of lots in the area including the western boundary for Beverley town site. Two of the lots surveyed were Avon location 14 with {{convert|5000|acre|km2}}, and Avon location K with {{convert|4000|acre|km2}}; location 14 was given to Captain Mark Currie, Fremantle Harbour Master, while location K was given to Stirling. Stirling as Governor and Currie as harbour master were not paid salaries by the colony but given land grants as compensation for their services. In 1978, surveyors using current equipment were engaged to determine the exact location of these original holdings, and commented on the remarkable accuracy of Watson's survey 142 years before.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nCurrie sold his grant of land to a [[Nicholas Carey]] in September 1838 for \u20a4330. Carey entered into a lease agreement in December with Governor Stirling for his grant, which included Carey purchasing the property at the end of the lease for \u20a4750 in 1846. Carey also purchased {{convert|3000|acre|km2}} to west of location 14 he also received an additional grant of land in 1849. With all the land in the vee formed by the [[Avon River (Western Australia)|Avon River]] and the Dale River the property was now {{convert|13330|acre|km2}} in size and was named ''Avondale Estate''. During the late 1840s Carey moved to [[Guernsey]] leaving Avondale to be operated by an unknown caretaker.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\n[[File:Avondale ag rs gnangarra 06.JPG|thumb|250px|Inside the stables at Avondale]]\nUpon Carey's death in March 1889, Avondale was inherited by his 16-year-old [[Nephew|grand nephew]] [[William Herbert deLisle]]. deLisle arrived and took up residence there in 1893, and assumed the land title in 1894. Avondale had been a pastoral property until deLisle's arrival, over the next ten years sections of the estate were sold off to fund its development. During this period, the house was expanded and the stable built, which included 20 horse stalls with hollow walls and an overhead loft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/A%20Reg/Avondale%20Res%20Stn%20(I).PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901160519/http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/A%20Reg/Avondale%20Res%20Stn%20(I).PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-09-01 |title=Interim Entry No. 05566 Register of Heritage Places |accessdate=2007-10-12 |format=pdf |work=[[Heritage Council of Western Australia]] }}</ref> The hollow walls enable feed from the loft to gravitate directly to the feed bins in each stall.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nThe remaining {{convert|5232|acre|km2|1}} were sold to [[William James Butcher]] and [[Charles John Hunt Butcher]] in 1904. The brothers purchased adjoining properties adding {{convert|4403|acre|km2|1}} which enlarged Avondale to {{convert|9635|acre|km2|1}}. In 1908 they offered to sell Avondale to the Western Australian Government for \u00a35/10/- per acre. The Government countered with an offer of \u00a35/5/- per acre, which was accepted. Avondale was purchased in March 1910 under the Agricultural Land Purchase act for a total of \u00a351,494/12/6, equivalent to approximately [[Australian Dollar|A$]]5,500,000 in 2006.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\n===1910 to 1924===\n[[File:Avondale ag museum gnangarra 01.jpg|thumb|250px|A display in the museum]]\nEven though the Butcher brothers' farming operations continued until January 1911, the government began preparations for subdivision. John Hall was sent to Avondale in April 1910 to locate all improvements and draw subdivision lines following existing fencing where possible. His arrival sparked considerable controversy, because not only had he set up camp on the golf course but the golf club also had leased {{convert|40|acre|m2}} of Avondale that joined the edge of town. Investigations found that the lease was terminated when the land was sold.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nHall divided Avondale into nine substantial size farms whose boundaries have remained unchanged since, the {{convert|40|acre|m2}} that had been occupied by the golf course was made into small lots which have since been further subdivided. Lands Department accountants calculated that the sale of the lots would return \u00a38,768/3/3 after expenses, and the estate was gazetted and land made available on 21 December 1910. Of the nine substantial lots only four were taken up as settlers were unable to pay the \u00a36 per acre price. Lot 1 was taken up by George Hancock, the father of mining magnate [[Lang Hancock]], and George's brother Richard took up Lot 2. Lot 13 was taken up by G.W. Isbister, and Lot 4 was taken up by former Premier [[Newton Moore|Sir Newton Moore]], who then proceeded to London with the plans. As [[Agent General]] Newton was to offer to prospective settlers lots at Avondale, although a number telegram inquiries to ascertain availability of lots at Avondale were sent, there is no record any lots being allocated in London.<ref name=\"book\" />\n[[File:Avondale ag rs gnangarra 02.JPG|thumb|right|The heritage listed [[weighbridge]] {{circa|1936}} in foreground with the heritage listed {{circa|1927}} silo behind]]\n\nAs none of the remaining 5 substantial lots had been taken up by November 1911, it was suggested that 4 of those remaining be used for an Agricultural College with the Lands Department responsible for continuing to farm the remaining lots. This left one lot known as Drumclyer available, in 1914 a [[Dowerin, Western Australia|Dowerin]] farmer tried to lease Drumclyer after losing his property there from drought, but was unable to negotiate an acceptable rate. In December, the Hancock brothers had abandoned lots 1 & 2, Isbister had also abandoned Lot 13, although it is not known exactly when, leaving only the {{convert|780|acre|km2}} of Lot 4 in private hands. With the outbreak of [[World War I]] the Agricultural College plans were abandoned as well.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nNear the end of 1916, the Beverley community requested that Avondale be subdivided into 20 lots for returning soldiers. It was also suggested that Avondale be a nursery where soldiers are given small allotments and those that succeed are then given larger grants elsewhere in the state. In July 1918, it was decided that Avondale would have 6 lots made available for servicemen from the Beverley area and that {{convert|1740|acre|km2}} which included the area around the homestead was to remain under control of the Lands Department.<ref name=\"assess\">{{cite web |url=http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/A%20-%20A-D/Avondale%20Res%20Stn%20(I-AD).PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831050815/http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/A%20-%20A-D/Avondale%20Res%20Stn%20(I-AD).PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-08-31 |title=Heritage Assessment Document 15/08/2003 |accessdate=2007-10-17 |format=pdf |work=Register of Heritage Places, Heritage Council of Western Australia }}</ref>\n\n==Department of Agriculture==\nThe original homestead block faced an uncertain future for many years, until it was given to the Department of Agriculture in 1924.

Avondale was used as an assembly and holding ground for [[dairy]] [[cattle]], prior to them being sent to [[Group Settlement Scheme|group settlers]] in the state's [[South West (Western Australia)|South West]]. During this period, the silo was built with a capacity of 100 tonnes; the silo is now heritage listed.<ref name=\"heritage\" /><ref name=\"book\" />\n\nThe local farming community raised concerns about cattle being unsuitable for the area, while the concerns were not immediately addressed Avondale was turned towards seed production and research.

It is bordered by the [[Sea of Japan]] to the west and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the east, and spans from the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in the north to the [[East China Sea]] and [[Philippine Sea]] in the south. Part of the Pacific [[Ring of Fire]], Japan encompasses an [[Japanese archipelago|archipelago]] of about [[List of islands of Japan|6,852 islands]], with five main islands ([[Hokkaido]], [[Honshu]], [[Kyushu]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]]) comprising 97% of the country's area.\n\nJapan is divided into [[Prefectures of Japan|47 prefectures]] and traditionally into [[List of regions of Japan|eight regions]]. Approximately two-thirds of [[Geography of Japan|the country's terrain]] is mountainous and heavily forested, and less than one-eighth of its land is suitable for agriculture. Consequently, Japan is among the [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|most densely populated]] and [[Urbanization_by_country|urbanized countries in the world]]. The largest urban area is the [[Greater Tokyo Area|metropolitan area]] centered on the capital city of [[Tokyo]], which is the [[List of metropolitan areas by population|most populous in the world]]. Japan itself is the [[List of countries by population|world's eleventh most populous country]].\n\nThe [[kanji]] that make up the [[Names of Japan|name of Japan]] mean \"sun origin\"; in the Western world, the country is often known by the [[sobriquet]] \"Land of the Rising Sun\". While archaeological evidence indicates that [[Japanese Paleolithic|Japan was inhabited]] as early as the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period, the first written mention of the archipelago appears in [[Book of Han|Chinese texts]] from the first century AD. Between the fourth and ninth centuries, the kingdoms of Japan gradually unified under [[Emperor of Japan|an Emperor]] and [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial court]] based in [[Heian-ky\u014d]] (modern [[Kyoto]]). However, beginning in the twelfth century, ''[[de facto]]'' political power came to be held by a succession of military dictators (''[[sh\u014dgun]]'') and feudal lords (''[[daimy\u014d]]'') and enforced by a class of warrior nobility known as [[samurai]]. After [[Sengoku period|a century-long period of civil war]], Japan was reunified in 1603 under the rule of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], which enacted a [[Sakoku|policy of isolationism]]. This period ended in 1853 when [[Perry Expedition|a United States fleet]] forced Japan to [[Bakumatsu|open to the West]], leading to the [[Boshin War|fall of the shogunate]] and [[Meiji Restoration|the restoration of imperial power]] in 1868. In the following [[Meiji era]], Japan adopted a [[Meiji Constitution|Western-style government]] and pursued a program of [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]]; this transformed the feudal society into a [[great power]], with Japan establishing [[Japanese colonial empire|a colonial empire in East Asia]] after decisive victories in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and [[Russo-Japanese War]]. In 1937, the [[Empire of Japan]] invaded [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]], beginning the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]; in 1940, it signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] and entered [[World War II]] the following year on the side of the [[Axis powers]]. After suffering major defeats in [[Pacific War|the Pacific]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|two atomic bombings]], Japan [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered to the Allies]] in 1945, coming under [[Occupation of Japan|a brief occupation]] and adopting [[Constitution of Japan|a new post-war constitution]]. Japan has since maintained a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[constitutional monarchy]] with the Emperor as a ceremonial [[head of state]] and an elected legislature known as the [[National Diet]].\n\nToday, Japan is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], the [[G7]], and the [[G20]]. Although it has [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|officially renounced its right to declare war]], Japan maintains a [[Japanese Self Defense Forces|modern military]] for [[peacekeeping]] and self-defense, which has been ranked as the [[Military#Capability_development|world's fourth most powerful]]. Following World War II, Japan experienced [[Japanese economic miracle|record economic growth]] to become [[Economic history of Japan|the world's second-largest economy]] by 1980. Today, [[Economy of Japan|Japan's economy]] is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|world's third-largest by nominal GDP]] and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fourth-largest by purchasing power parity]]; it is also the [[List of countries by imports|fourth-largest importer]] and [[List of countries by exports|exporter]] and a global leader in the [[Automotive industry in Japan|automotive]] and [[Electronics industry in Japan|electronics]] industries. Japan is ranked \"very high\" on the [[Human Development Index]]; its population enjoys high levels of [[Education in Japan|education]] and the [[List of countries by life expectancy|second-highest life expectancy]] in the world, though it currently is experiencing [[Aging of Japan|a projected decline]] due to low [[Total fertility rate|birth rates]]. Culturally, [[Japanese culture|Japan is renowned]] for its [[Japanese art|art]], [[Japanese cuisine|cuisine]], [[Japanese literature|literature]], [[Cinema of Japan|cinema]], [[Japanese music|music]], and [[Japanese popular culture|popular culture]].\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Main|Names of Japan}}\n\nThe Japanese word for Japan is {{nihongo2|\u65e5\u672c}}, which is pronounced ''Nihon'' or ''Nippon''. The character {{nihongo||\u65e5|nichi}} means \"sun\" or \"day\"; {{nihongo||\u672c|hon}} means \"base\" or \"origin\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Where does the name Japan come from?|url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/japan.html|accessdate=January 29, 2017}}</ref> The compound therefore means \"origin of the sun\" and is the source of the popular Western [[epithet]] \"Land of the Rising Sun\".<ref>{{cite book|title=The emergence of Japanese kingship|first=Joan R. |last=Piggott|year=1997|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2832-4|pages=143\u2013144|url={{Google books|BruaJSZmjHcC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} }}</ref>\n\n[[File:King of Na gold seal faces.jpg|thumb|The \"[[King of Na gold seal]]\", said to have been granted to [[Nakoku|Na]] king of [[Wa (Japan)]] by [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]] in 57 CE. The seal reads \"{{Nihongo2|\u6f22\u59d4\u5974\u570b\u738b}}\". [[Tokyo National Museum]]]]\nThe earliest record of the name ''Nihon'' appears in the Chinese ''[[Old Book of Tang]]''. Prior to the adoption of ''Nihon'', other terms such as {{Nihongo|''[[Yamato people|Yamato]]''|\u5927\u548c||extra=or \"Great Wa\"}} and {{Nihongo|''Wakoku''|\u502d\u56fd}} were used. The term {{Nihongo|''Wa''|\u548c}} is a homophone of ''Wo'' {{Nihongo2|\u502d}} (pronounced \"Wa\" by the Japanese), which has been used by the Chinese as a designation for the Japanese as early as the third century [[Three Kingdoms]] period. However, the Japanese disliked some connotation of [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]] {{Nihongo2|\u502d}} (which has been associated in China with concepts like \"dwarf\" or \"pygmy\"), and it was therefore replaced with the substitute character {{Nihongo|''Wa''|\u548c}}, meaning \"togetherness, harmony\".<ref name=\"fuzita\">{{cite web|title=Why Japan is Japan?

It is bordered by the [[Sea of Japan]] to the west and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the east, and spans from the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in the north to the [[East China Sea]] and [[Philippine Sea]] in the south. Part of the Pacific [[Ring of Fire]], Japan encompasses an [[Japanese archipelago|archipelago]] of about [[List of islands of Japan|6,852 islands]], with five main islands ([[Hokkaido]], [[Honshu]], [[Kyushu]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]]) comprising 97% of the country's area.\n\nJapan is divided into [[Prefectures of Japan|47 prefectures]] and traditionally into [[List of regions of Japan|eight regions]]. Approximately two-thirds of [[Geography of Japan|the country's terrain]] is mountainous and heavily forested, and less than one-eighth of its land is suitable for agriculture. Consequently, Japan is among the [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|most densely populated]] and [[Urbanization_by_country|urbanized countries in the world]]. The largest urban area is the [[Greater Tokyo Area|metropolitan area]] centered on the capital city of [[Tokyo]], which is the [[List of metropolitan areas by population|most populous in the world]]. Japan itself is the [[List of countries by population|world's eleventh most populous country]].\n\nThe [[kanji]] that make up the [[Names of Japan|name of Japan]] mean \"sun origin\"; in the Western world, the country is often known by the [[sobriquet]] \"Land of the Rising Sun\". While archaeological evidence indicates that [[Japanese Paleolithic|Japan was inhabited]] as early as the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period, the first written mention of the archipelago appears in [[Book of Han|Chinese texts]] from the first century AD. Between the fourth and ninth centuries, the kingdoms of Japan gradually unified under [[Emperor of Japan|an Emperor]] and [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial court]] based in [[Heian-ky\u014d]] (modern [[Kyoto]]). However, beginning in the twelfth century, ''[[de facto]]'' political power came to be held by a succession of military dictators (''[[sh\u014dgun]]'') and feudal lords (''[[daimy\u014d]]'') and enforced by a class of warrior nobility known as [[samurai]]. After [[Sengoku period|a century-long period of civil war]], Japan was reunified in 1603 under the rule of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], which enacted a [[Sakoku|policy of isolationism]]. This period ended in 1853 when [[Perry Expedition|a United States fleet]] forced Japan to [[Bakumatsu|open to the West]], leading to the [[Boshin War|fall of the shogunate]] and [[Meiji Restoration|the restoration of imperial power]] in 1868. In the following [[Meiji era]], Japan adopted a [[Meiji Constitution|Western-style government]] and pursued a program of [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]]; this transformed the feudal society into a [[great power]], with Japan establishing [[Japanese colonial empire|a colonial empire in East Asia]] after decisive victories in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and [[Russo-Japanese War]]. In 1937, the [[Empire of Japan]] invaded [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]], beginning the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]; in 1940, it signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] and entered [[World War II]] the following year on the side of the [[Axis powers]]. After suffering major defeats in [[Pacific War|the Pacific]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|two atomic bombings]], Japan [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered to the Allies]] in 1945, coming under [[Occupation of Japan|a brief occupation]] and adopting [[Constitution of Japan|a new post-war constitution]]. Japan has since maintained a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[constitutional monarchy]] with the Emperor as a ceremonial [[head of state]] and an elected legislature known as the [[National Diet]].\n\nToday, Japan is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], the [[G7]], and the [[G20]]. Although it has [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|officially renounced its right to declare war]], Japan maintains a [[Japanese Self Defense Forces|modern military]] for [[peacekeeping]] and self-defense, which has been ranked as the [[Military#Capability_development|world's fourth most powerful]]. Following World War II, Japan experienced [[Japanese economic miracle|record economic growth]] to become [[Economic history of Japan|the world's second-largest economy]] by 1980. Today, [[Economy of Japan|Japan's economy]] is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|world's third-largest by nominal GDP]] and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fourth-largest by purchasing power parity]]; it is also the [[List of countries by imports|fourth-largest importer]] and [[List of countries by exports|exporter]] and a global leader in the [[Automotive industry in Japan|automotive]] and [[Electronics industry in Japan|electronics]] industries. Japan is ranked \"very high\" on the [[Human Development Index]]; its population enjoys high levels of [[Education in Japan|education]] and the [[List of countries by life expectancy|second-highest life expectancy]] in the world, though it currently is experiencing [[Aging of Japan|a projected decline]] due to low [[Total fertility rate|birth rates]]. Culturally, [[Japanese culture|Japan is renowned]] for its [[Japanese art|art]], [[Japanese cuisine|cuisine]], [[Japanese literature|literature]], [[Cinema of Japan|cinema]], [[Japanese music|music]], and [[Japanese popular culture|popular culture]].\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Main|Names of Japan}}\n\nThe Japanese word for Japan is {{nihongo2|\u65e5\u672c}}, which is pronounced ''Nihon'' or ''Nippon''. The character {{nihongo||\u65e5|nichi}} means \"sun\" or \"day\"; {{nihongo||\u672c|hon}} means \"base\" or \"origin\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Where does the name Japan come from?|url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/japan.html|accessdate=January 29, 2017}}</ref> The compound therefore means \"origin of the sun\" and is the source of the popular Western [[epithet]] \"Land of the Rising Sun\".<ref>{{cite book|title=The emergence of Japanese kingship|first=Joan R. |last=Piggott|year=1997|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2832-4|pages=143\u2013144|url={{Google books|BruaJSZmjHcC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} }}</ref>\n\n[[File:King of Na gold seal faces.jpg|thumb|The \"[[King of Na gold seal]]\", said to have been granted to [[Nakoku|Na]] king of [[Wa (Japan)]] by [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]] in 57 CE. The seal reads \"{{Nihongo2|\u6f22\u59d4\u5974\u570b\u738b}}\". [[Tokyo National Museum]]]]\nThe earliest record of the name ''Nihon'' appears in the Chinese ''[[Old Book of Tang]]''. Prior to the adoption of ''Nihon'', other terms such as {{Nihongo|''[[Yamato people|Yamato]]''|\u5927\u548c||extra=or \"Great Wa\"}} and {{Nihongo|''Wakoku''|\u502d\u56fd}} were used. The term {{Nihongo|''Wa''|\u548c}} is a homophone of ''Wo'' {{Nihongo2|\u502d}} (pronounced \"Wa\" by the Japanese), which has been used by the Chinese as a designation for the Japanese as early as the third century [[Three Kingdoms]] period. However, the Japanese disliked some connotation of [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]] {{Nihongo2|\u502d}} (which has been associated in China with concepts like \"dwarf\" or \"pygmy\"), and it was therefore replaced with the substitute character {{Nihongo|''Wa''|\u548c}}, meaning \"togetherness, harmony\".<ref name=\"fuzita\">{{cite web|title=Why Japan is Japan?
