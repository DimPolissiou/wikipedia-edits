Meet Cody & Zack |publisher=Tv.disney.go.com|accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref> Zack does not perform particularly well academically, but he manages to graduate in the series' finale episode. He performs very well physically and enjoys physical sports, especially basketball and football. Zack acts selfish at times but he also sincerely cares for his brother and friends, even if he does not always show it. He flirts with most of the girls on the ship by using various pick-up lines, although he rarely ever stays with them for more than one episode. At the beginning of the third season, he starts to develop strong feelings for a new student on the ship named Maya. At first, she refuses to go out with him since he was a \"player,\" but eventually he wins her over by throwing a surprise party for her. He then surprises his friends by being a good boyfriend. Although initially there is confusion as to whether he loved her or whether he was just taking her on as a challenge, he proves to have strong feelings for her in later episodes. She breaks up with him in the episode \"Graduation on Deck\" because of a Peace Corps assignment she accepts, but they remain close friends.\n* [[Cody Martin]], portrayed by [[Dylan and Cole Sprouse|Cole Sprouse]], is a sweet naive, innocent, typically the intelligent, kind-hearted, and sensitive twin. Cody performs well academically, is a straight A student, and has shown to have a great interest in academics; however, he does not perform well in sports. Cody has been noted to be ten minutes younger than Zack and often plays into Zack's crazy schemes. Cody is usually picked on by Zack, but Zack becomes very defensive when other people do it. Likewise, Cody cares very deeply for Zack, despite his picking on him constantly. At the end of season one, Cody begins dating Bailey Pickett, but they pause their romantic relationship in the second-season finale due to a misunderstanding in Paris. However, near the end of the third season, they get back together again after confessing that they never stopped loving each other. In \"[[List of The Suite Life on Deck episodes#ep54|Das Boots]]\", it is revealed that he has multiple allergies, said by Sasha, a [[Russians|Russian]] girl who lost to him in a [[chess]] championship. Also, in \"[[List of The Suite Life on Deck episodes#ep64|A London Carol]]\", a future version of Cody and Bailey are married. cole spouse is a very talented actor he makes it so darn believable, he has also played many other acting job and is worth over 8 million dollars, i love him so much and he makes me so happy as he does to many other girls\n* [[London Tipton]], portrayed by [[Brenda Song]], is the [[socialite]] of the four main teenage characters. She is a parody of [[Paris Hilton]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wiest|first1=Brianna|title=People Think Paris Hilton STOLE This Meme About \"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody\"|url=http://www.teenvogue.com/story/paris-hilton-accused-stealing-viral-post|website=Teen Vogue|language=en}}</ref> She is the daughter of [[List of recurring characters in The Suite Life of Zack & Cody#Tipton staff|Wilfred Tipton]], a multi-billionaire and the owner of the Tipton Hotel chains, including the one in Boston and the SS ''Tipton''. London is typically selfish, dim-witted, spoiled, gullible and meticulous about her appearance but she is happy and heartwarming, and she does care for her friends (even if she can't remember the difference between Zack and Cody). She also has a [[Pomeranian (dog)|pomeranian]] pet dog named Ivana. When she is happy, she usually claps her hands and repeatedly jumps up and down while saying her catchphrase, \"Yay me!\" Mr. Moseby fools London into thinking that she is on the SS ''Tipton'' for a vacation, to trick her into boarding the ship. London gets enrolled at the Seven Seas High School program because her father wants her to live in the real world. London does not live in a first class suite on the SS ''Tipton'', but a small cabin. London reluctantly agrees to accept Bailey Pickett (Debby Ryan) as her new roommate, although she does so after unsuccessfully trying to bribe Bailey into leaving as she did with her previous roommate. The two later become good friends. In ''The Suite Life of Zack & Cody'', when London resided at the Tipton Hotel, it seemed that she was living in her own bubble. On the SS ''Tipton'', London became more aware of the real world and faced several difficulties to help her when she takes over her father's business.\n* [[Bailey Pickett]], portrayed by [[Debby Ryan]], is a teenage girl from the fictional town of Kettlecorn, [[Kansas]]. She is very intelligent just like Cody, seemingly the perfect girl-next-door and has been described as a \"small town, down-to-earth girl.\" She shares a room with the wealthy  London Tipton, in which the two later form a close friendship and end up becoming best friends. Bailey is a student at Seven Seas High and attends classes with her new friends Zack, Cody, London, and Woody. She boarded the ship to leave Kettlecorn, where she lived on a farm, because she longed for the big city. She pretends to be a boy in the pilot in order to get a room on the SS ''Tipton'' because the girls' cabins were filled. Eventually, she moves in with London after people find out she is a girl. London tries to bribe her not to move in, but Bailey refuses. Both Zack and Cody have a crush on her at the beginning of the series, but when they find out more about Bailey's life and her ex-boyfriend, Zack lets Cody have her, claiming that she was \"carrying too much baggage.\" However, a couple seasons later he says that he doesn't blame Cody for not being able to get over Bailey and called her \"smokin',\" showing he still thinks she's attractive even if he doesn't like her \"that way\". Cody tries several times throughout the first season to attract Bailey, but is unsuccessful until the crossover episode \"[[Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana]]\" in which they start dating. They eventually end their romantic relationship in the second-season finale due to a misunderstanding in Paris. However, near the end of the third season, they get back together again after confessing that they still loved each other. In \"[[List of The Suite Life on Deck episodes#ep64|A London Carol]]\", a future version of Cody and Bailey are married. In the series finale, she reveals that she chose to attend Yale University. \n* [[Mr. Moseby|Marion Moseby]], portrayed by [[Phill Lewis]], the uptight and serious former manager of [[the Tipton Hotel]] in ''The Suite Life of Zack and Cody'', is now the chaperon and manager of the SS ''Tipton''. He speaks with a wide vocabulary and an urbane vernacular, minimal tolerance for fun of any kind, and is therefore often annoyed by Zack and Cody's schemes. He has raised London Tipton like his own daughter. His repeated catch phrases, \"Good luck with that,\" and \"If you'll excuse me,\" have become his trademark. He loves bad jokes, has a passion for collecting handkerchiefs, and has a penchant for ballet, which becomes a running joke throughout the series. Though he acts as though he does not care about Zack and Cody, he actually has a great deal of affection for them and tells them he will miss them in the end of the Graduation on Deck episode. He's constantly running from stem to stern keeping the Martin twins and London out of trouble. Moseby is a father figure in London's life, because of London's father's absence in the series. He looks after her constantly and cares for her very deeply. Moseby reportedly tricked London in order for her to be enrolled in the Seven Seas High School program. He told London she was going on a vacation on the SS ''Tipton'' to get her on the ship. Mr. Moseby is continuously trying to \"court\" Ms. Tutwieler and, in the final episode of the series, proposes to her, deciding he wants them to be together rather than apart. In an act of true bravery in the final episode, Moseby tells off Mr. Tipton for having the ship dismantled during graduation; he follows up by telling the shocked crowd that he was already losing his job anyway.\n\n<!-- Do not remove or move this section.

After hitting [[puberty]], causing his voice to change, he lost his fame and career. He attends Seven Seas High and shares a room with Zack. Marcus lived in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], as mentioned on his sash in \"The Beauty and the Fleeced.\" He first appears in the second-season episode \"[[List of The Suite Life on Deck episodes#ep30|Roomies]]\". He has a crush on London, and is shown to be quite gullible, often believing Woody's tall tales. Marcus has as many famous contacts as London does; however, he is sensitive about the loss of his fame because he believes his celebrity friends won't like him, though he was later proven wrong in the episode \"Crossing Jordin.\" Marcus eventually leaves the ship in the episode \"Bon Voyage\" after choosing to star in a musical based on his hit song \"Retainer Baby.\" Cody is proud of him for this because he'll be entertaining people while promoting proper dental care.\n\n===Recurring===\n{{Main|List of recurring characters in The Suite Life on Deck}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He stated, \"Our audience has shown us that after 88 episodes, 'The Suite Life of Zack & Cody' remains one of their favorite sitcoms ever, we decided to find a new way for Zack, Cody, London, and Mr. Moseby to live 'The Suite Life' in a whole new setting \u2013 this time aboard a luxury cruise liner.\"<ref name=\"DC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dcmedianet.com/DNR/2008/doc/SLonDeck.doc|title=Disney Media Net|publisher=Disney Media Net|accessdate=March 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004072040/http://www.dcmedianet.com/DNR/2008/doc/SLonDeck.doc|archivedate=October 4, 2011}}</ref> The series original creator, [[Danny Kallis]] was announced to be involved with the project.

An on-board theater serves as an \"organic\" set-up for musical numbers.<ref name=\"Spinoff\">{{cite web|url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3iade5585233ac618013bedad814a85e61|title=Spinoff voyage for Zack and Cody|first=Kimberly|last=Nordyke|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 4, 2008|accessdate=September 3, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415023958/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3iade5585233ac618013bedad814a85e61|archivedate=April 15, 2008}}</ref> Most of the action in the series occurs on board the SS ''Tipton''. However, the ship travels to a variety of places around the world which are often unfamiliar places to both Zack and Cody Martin.\n\n====SS ''Tipton''====\n{{anchor|SS Tipton}}The SS ''Tipton'' is a [[cruise ship]] belonging to [[London Tipton]]'s father. The ship had its first canon appearance in ''The Suite Life of Zack and Cody'' episode \"[[List of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody episodes#21|Let Us Entertain You]]\". Unlike most cruise ships it also includes a school, Seven Seas High School, which is a common setting on the ship, as are the Sky Deck, the lobby, the corridors outside the students' cabins and the cabins themselves. In the third season, the Aqua Lounge, a newly refurbished space on the ship, was shown, and it replaced the Sky Deck as the main hangout (although the Sky Deck is still commonly shown). There are also various areas on the SS ''Tipton'' that are mentioned, but never seen, including several decks and the ship's putt-putt golf course, where the captain spends most of his time. In the [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] episode of ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'', \"[[Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana#Cast-Away (To Another Show)|Cast-Away (To Another Show)]],\" [[Mr. Moseby]] reveals that the ship itself weighs 87,000 [[ton]]s.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Cast-Away (To Another Show)|series=Wizards of Waverly Place| season=2|number=25}}</ref> After the events in \"Graduation on Deck\" the SS ''Tipton'' was sold and later dismantled. Mr Moseby mentioned in the season 1 episode \"Cruisin' for a Bruisin'\", that the ship was not the first ship with the SS ''Tipton'' name (indicating that the Tipton cruiseline had been in service long before the events of the first series). [[Wilfred Tipton|Mr Tipton]] commissioned a scale model \"replica-in-a-bottle\" of the first SS ''Tipton'' as a gift for Captain Lansferd.\n\n====Other settings====\n<!-- In order to qualify as a \"setting\", the location must actually be shown, not merely mentioned.

He works in the juice bar on the ship as a result of using up both Cody's and his money for the semester. Cody is forced to obtain the job as a towel boy.<ref name=\"Yo Us!\">{{cite web|url=http://tv.disney.go.com/disneychannel/suitelifeondeck/yous/ |title=Their blog Yo Us! Meet Cody & Zack |publisher=Tv.disney.go.com|accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref> Zack does not perform particularly well academically, but he manages to graduate in the series' finale episode. He performs very well physically and enjoys physical sports, especially basketball and football. Zack acts selfish at times but he also sincerely cares for his brother and friends, even if he does not always show it. He flirts with most of the girls on the ship by using various pick-up lines, although he rarely ever stays with them for more than one episode. At the beginning of the third season, he starts to develop strong feelings for a new student on the ship named Maya. At first, she refuses to go out with him since he was a \"player,\" but eventually he wins her over by throwing a surprise party for her. He then surprises his friends by being a good boyfriend. Although initially there is confusion as to whether he loved her or whether he was just taking her on as a challenge, he proves to have strong feelings for her in later episodes. She breaks up with him in the episode \"Graduation on Deck\" because of a Peace Corps assignment she accepts, but they remain close friends.\n* [[Cody Martin]], portrayed by [[Dylan and Cole Sprouse|Cole Sprouse]], is a sweet naive, innocent, typically the intelligent, kind-hearted, and sensitive twin. Cody performs well academically, is a straight A student, and has shown to have a great interest in academics; however, he does not perform well in sports. Cody has been noted to be ten minutes younger than Zack and often plays into Zack's crazy schemes. Cody is usually picked on by Zack, but Zack becomes very defensive when other people do it. Likewise, Cody cares very deeply for Zack, despite his picking on him constantly. At the end of season one, Cody begins dating Bailey Pickett, but they pause their romantic relationship in the second-season finale due to a misunderstanding in Paris. However, near the end of the third season, they get back together again after confessing that they never stopped loving each other. In \"[[List of The Suite Life on Deck episodes#ep54|Das Boots]]\", it is revealed that he has multiple allergies, said by Sasha, a [[Russians|Russian]] girl who lost to him in a [[chess]] championship. Also, in \"[[List of The Suite Life on Deck episodes#ep64|A London Carol]]\", a future version of Cody and Bailey are married.\n* [[London Tipton]], portrayed by [[Brenda Song]], is the [[socialite]] of the four main teenage characters. She is a parody of [[Paris Hilton]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wiest|first1=Brianna|title=People Think Paris Hilton STOLE This Meme About \"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody\"|url=http://www.teenvogue.com/story/paris-hilton-accused-stealing-viral-post|website=Teen Vogue|language=en}}</ref> She is the daughter of [[List of recurring characters in The Suite Life of Zack & Cody#Tipton staff|Wilfred Tipton]], a multi-billionaire and the owner of the Tipton Hotel chains, including the one in Boston and the SS ''Tipton''. London is typically selfish, dim-witted, spoiled, gullible and meticulous about her appearance but she is happy and heartwarming, and she does care for her friends (even if she can't remember the difference between Zack and Cody). She also has a [[Pomeranian (dog)|pomeranian]] pet dog named Ivana. When she is happy, she usually claps her hands and repeatedly jumps up and down while saying her catchphrase, \"Yay me!\" Mr. Moseby fools London into thinking that she is on the SS ''Tipton'' for a vacation, to trick her into boarding the ship. London gets enrolled at the Seven Seas High School program because her father wants her to live in the real world. London does not live in a first class suite on the SS ''Tipton'', but a small cabin. London reluctantly agrees to accept Bailey Pickett (Debby Ryan) as her new roommate, although she does so after unsuccessfully trying to bribe Bailey into leaving as she did with her previous roommate. The two later become good friends. In ''The Suite Life of Zack & Cody'', when London resided at the Tipton Hotel, it seemed that she was living in her own bubble. On the SS ''Tipton'', London became more aware of the real world and faced several difficulties to help her when she takes over her father's business.\n* [[Bailey Pickett]], portrayed by [[Debby Ryan]], is a teenage girl from the fictional town of Kettlecorn, [[Kansas]]. She is very intelligent just like Cody, seemingly the perfect girl-next-door and has been described as a \"small town, down-to-earth girl.\" She shares a room with the wealthy  London Tipton, in which the two later form a close friendship and end up becoming best friends. Bailey is a student at Seven Seas High and attends classes with her new friends Zack, Cody, London, and Woody. She boarded the ship to leave Kettlecorn, where she lived on a farm, because she longed for the big city. She pretends to be a boy in the pilot in order to get a room on the SS ''Tipton'' because the girls' cabins were filled. Eventually, she moves in with London after people find out she is a girl. London tries to bribe her not to move in, but Bailey refuses. Both Zack and Cody have a crush on her at the beginning of the series, but when they find out more about Bailey's life and her ex-boyfriend, Zack lets Cody have her, claiming that she was \"carrying too much baggage.\" However, a couple seasons later he says that he doesn't blame Cody for not being able to get over Bailey and called her \"smokin',\" showing he still thinks she's attractive even if he doesn't like her \"that way\". Cody tries several times throughout the first season to attract Bailey, but is unsuccessful until the crossover episode \"[[Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana]]\" in which they start dating. They eventually end their romantic relationship in the second-season finale due to a misunderstanding in Paris. However, near the end of the third season, they get back together again after confessing that they still loved each other. In \"[[List of The Suite Life on Deck episodes#ep64|A London Carol]]\", a future version of Cody and Bailey are married. In the series finale, she reveals that she chose to attend Yale University. \n* [[Mr. Moseby|Marion Moseby]], portrayed by [[Phill Lewis]], the uptight and serious former manager of [[the Tipton Hotel]] in ''The Suite Life of Zack and Cody'', is now the chaperon and manager of the SS ''Tipton''. He speaks with a wide vocabulary and an urbane vernacular, minimal tolerance for fun of any kind, and is therefore often annoyed by Zack and Cody's schemes. He has raised London Tipton like his own daughter. His repeated catch phrases, \"Good luck with that,\" and \"If you'll excuse me,\" have become his trademark. He loves bad jokes, has a passion for collecting handkerchiefs, and has a penchant for ballet, which becomes a running joke throughout the series. Though he acts as though he does not care about Zack and Cody, he actually has a great deal of affection for them and tells them he will miss them in the end of the Graduation on Deck episode. He's constantly running from stem to stern keeping the Martin twins and London out of trouble. Moseby is a father figure in London's life, because of London's father's absence in the series. He looks after her constantly and cares for her very deeply. Moseby reportedly tricked London in order for her to be enrolled in the Seven Seas High School program. He told London she was going on a vacation on the SS ''Tipton'' to get her on the ship. Mr. Moseby is continuously trying to \"court\" Ms. Tutwieler and, in the final episode of the series, proposes to her, deciding he wants them to be together rather than apart. In an act of true bravery in the final episode, Moseby tells off Mr. Tipton for having the ship dismantled during graduation; he follows up by telling the shocked crowd that he was already losing his job anyway.\n\n<!-- Do not remove or move this section.

After hitting [[puberty]], causing his voice to change, he lost his fame and career. He attends Seven Seas High and shares a room with Zack. Marcus lived in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], as mentioned on his sash in \"The Beauty and the Fleeced.\" He first appears in the second-season episode \"[[List of The Suite Life on Deck episodes#ep30|Roomies]]\". He has a crush on London, and is shown to be quite gullible, often believing Woody's tall tales. Marcus has as many famous contacts as London does; however, he is sensitive about the loss of his fame because he believes his celebrity friends won't like him, though he was later proven wrong in the episode \"Crossing Jordin.\" Marcus eventually leaves the ship in the episode \"Bon Voyage\" after choosing to star in a musical based on his hit song \"Retainer Baby.\" Cody is proud of him for this because he'll be entertaining people while promoting proper dental care.\n\n===Recurring===\n{{Main|List of recurring characters in The Suite Life on Deck}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He stated, \"Our audience has shown us that after 88 episodes, 'The Suite Life of Zack & Cody' remains one of their favorite sitcoms ever, we decided to find a new way for Zack, Cody, London, and Mr. Moseby to live 'The Suite Life' in a whole new setting \u2013 this time aboard a luxury cruise liner.\"<ref name=\"DC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dcmedianet.com/DNR/2008/doc/SLonDeck.doc|title=Disney Media Net|publisher=Disney Media Net|accessdate=March 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004072040/http://www.dcmedianet.com/DNR/2008/doc/SLonDeck.doc|archivedate=October 4, 2011}}</ref> The series original creator, [[Danny Kallis]] was announced to be involved with the project.

However, the ship travels to a variety of places around the world which are often unfamiliar places to both Zack and Cody Martin.\n\n====SS ''Tipton''====\n{{anchor|SS Tipton}}The SS ''Tipton'' is a [[cruise ship]] belonging to [[London Tipton]]'s father. The ship had its first canon appearance in ''The Suite Life of Zack and Cody'' episode \"[[List of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody episodes#21|Let Us Entertain You]]\". Unlike most cruise ships it also includes a school, Seven Seas High School, which is a common setting on the ship, as are the Sky Deck, the lobby, the corridors outside the students' cabins and the cabins themselves. In the third season, the Aqua Lounge, a newly refurbished space on the ship, was shown, and it replaced the Sky Deck as the main hangout (although the Sky Deck is still commonly shown). There are also various areas on the SS ''Tipton'' that are mentioned, but never seen, including several decks and the ship's putt-putt golf course, where the captain spends most of his time. In the [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] episode of ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'', \"[[Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana#Cast-Away (To Another Show)|Cast-Away (To Another Show)]],\" [[Mr. Moseby]] reveals that the ship itself weighs 87,000 [[ton]]s.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Cast-Away (To Another Show)|series=Wizards of Waverly Place| season=2|number=25}}</ref> After the events in \"Graduation on Deck\" the SS ''Tipton'' was sold and later dismantled. Mr Moseby mentioned in the season 1 episode \"Cruisin' for a Bruisin'\", that the ship was not the first ship with the SS ''Tipton'' name (indicating that the Tipton cruiseline had been in service long before the events of the first series). [[Wilfred Tipton|Mr Tipton]] commissioned a scale model \"replica-in-a-bottle\" of the first SS ''Tipton'' as a gift for Captain Lansferd.\n\n====Other settings====\n<!-- In order to qualify as a \"setting\", the location must actually be shown, not merely mentioned.

However, because this spelling had been abandoned since Phillips (1871), ''Pliosaurus'' should be preserved according to Article 33.3.1 of the ICZN.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/> The [[name of a biological genus|generic name]] is derived from \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c9\u03bd, ''pleion'', meaning \"more\" and \u03c3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, ''sauros'', meaning \"lizard\" in [[Ancient Greek]], in reference to Owen' belief that ''Pliosaurus'' was more closely related to \"[[sauria]]ns\" (including [[crocodilia]]ns) than ''Plesiosaurus'' was.<ref name=Owen1841/> The etymology of the [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] was not specified, but it probably refers to the shorter teeth of ''P. brachydeirus'' compared to teeth of other species then referred to ''Plesiosaurus''.<ref name=Owen1842/> The specific name has occasionally erroneously been spelled as ''brachydirus'', for example by [[Richard Lydekker]] (1889a, 1889b).<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/>\n[[File:Pliosaurus brachydeirus flipper (cast), Wrexham Museum (3)..JPG|thumb|Cast of a flipper referred to ''P. brachydeirus'']] \n''P. brachydeirus'' is known from the [[holotype]] which includes seven specimens found in association and housed at [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]], OUMNH J.9245, OUMNH J.9247 through OUMNH J.9301 and OUMNH J.10453. The specimen consists of a partial [[skull]] and [[lower jaw]], several [[vertebral column|axial]] elements and limb material. Other specimens that are referable to this species include OUMNH J.9285, and OUMNH J.9192 through OUMNH J.9301, all described by Owen (1841\u20131842) and were found associated with the holotype. The specimens were collected by Prof. [[William Buckland]]<ref name=Owen1841/> at [[Market Rasen]], [[Lincolnshire]], from the ''Rasenia cymodoce'' ammonite zone of the lower [[Kimmeridge Clay Formation]], dating to the early [[Kimmeridgian]] stage.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/><ref name=Pliosaurus2013/>\n\nKnutsen (2012) revised the validity of this species and was able to diagnose it on a basis of combination of traits. ''P. brachydeirus'' had approximately 70 teeth in the lower jaw (72 according to Benson ''et al.'' (2013)), 8-9 or more pairs of symphyseal teeth in dorsal view (12 pairs according to Benson ''et al.'' (2013)) and 5 or more [[premaxilla]]ry teeth. It shows \"type III\" retroarticular process and [[autapomorphies|autapomorphic]] (unique) traits of the [[cervical vertebrae]], which had a smooth ventral surface and a ventral keel, unlike rounded to flat ventral surface seen in other species. Benson ''et al.'' (2013) also noted that it lacks anisodont premaxillary dentition. The [[ontogenetic stage]] of the holotype of ''P. brachydeirus'' is not known, but the rounded edge on the distal end of the femur and lack of separation between the femoral capitulum and trochanter suggests that it is from a relatively young individual.

These specimens were collected at [[Headington]] Pits near Oxford, [[Oxfordshire]], England, from the [[Kimmeridge Clay]]. It was later noted by Pocock (1908), that the material was found in the lower part of the Kimmeridge Clay, as the pits expose the contact between the Kimmeridge Clay Formation and the underlying Corallian beds. Several other cervical centra from the same strata at [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], Dorsetshire, that had been named ''Plesiosaurus giganteus'' by Conybeare (1824), were also referred to ''Plesiosaurus brachyspondylus'' by Owen (1839). Eichwald (1868) reassigned ''P. brachyspondylus'' to ''Pliosaurus'' but did not provide diagnosis to distinguished these vertebrae from those of the type species of the genus. ''P. giganteus'' was later synonymised by Lydekker (1889a) with ''P. brachydeirus'', the type species.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/>\n\nAccording to Tarlo (1959a), the holotypes of ''P. giganteus'' and ''P. brachyspondylus'' have been lost or destroyed since their initial descriptions.<ref name=Tarlo1959a>{{cite journal | last1 = Tarlo | first1 = Lambert Beverly | year = 1959 | title = ''Pliosaurus brachyspondylus'' (Owen) from the Kimmeridge Clay | journal = Palaeontology | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 283\u2013291 }}</ref> Therefore, he selected a single posterior cervical centrum, CAMSM J.29564, as the [[neotype]] of ''P. brachyspondylus'', while ''P. giganteus'' became a ''[[nomen oblitum]]'', forgotten name, as ''P. brachyspondylus'' had traditionally been given priority over it. This centrum was the only not dorsal centrum from a series of thirty associated centra listed by [[Harry Seeley]] (1869) as belonging to ''P. brachyspondylus''. They were collected at the Roswell (Roslyn) pit near [[Ely, Cambridgeshire]], also in England, from between the ''Aulacostephanus mutabilis'' or ''Aulacostephanus eudoxus'' ammonite zones, of the lower Kimmeridge Clay Formation. Although the measurements of the neotype agree with these of the lost holotype, they are also similar to these of referred specimens of ''P. brachydeirus'' (OUMNH J.9291-9301) and ''[[Pliosaurus andrewsi|\"Pliosaurus\" andrewsi]]'' (NHMUK R.1243, cast of mid-cervical centrum referred to ''P. evansi''). Additionally, Seeley's referral was based on a single character, \"articular surface is very slightly concave, with a small round depression at the centre\", a feature that is now known to be common in other [[pliosaurid]]s as well. Thus, Tarlo's choice of the neotype of ''P. brachyspondylus'' relies solely on the similarity in size to the original material described by Owen (1839), which is also similar to ''P. brachydeirus''.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/> The neotype centrum, CAMSM J.29564, differs from the holotype of ''P. brachydeirus'' in the following two traits; it has ventral surface ornamentation but lacks a ventral keel. Nevertheless, the neotype for ''P. brachyspondylus'' is non-diagnostic from other species of ''Pliosaurus'', and thus the name must be considered a ''[[nomen dubium]]''.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/><ref name=Pliosaurus2013/>\n\nIn the same paper, Tarlo (1959a) described an associated pliosaur skeleton, CAMSM J.35991, and referred it to ''P. brachyspondylus''.<ref name=Tarlo1959a/> CAMSM J.35991 consists of a complete [[mandible]], most of the axial skeleton and parts of the [[appendicular skeleton]]. It was found in 1889 in the ''Aulacostephanus eudoxus'' ammonite zone of the lower Kimmeridge Clay, at the same locality as CAMSM J.29564 (the neotype for ''P. brachyspondylus''). Knutsen (2012) suggested to replace the neotype for ''P. brachyspondylus'', with CAMSM J.35991 as the new neotype, because both specimens and possibly the lost holotype are from the same locality and horizon, and similar in size. CAMSM J.35991 is much more complete and can be distinguished from all other species of ''Pliosaurus''.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/> Benson ''et al.'' (2013) agreed with this suggestion, but considered ''P. brachyspondylus'' to be [[Thalassophonea]] indet., until a petition to the ICZN is made.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/> Based on CAMSM J.35991, Knutsen (2012) provisionally diagnosed ''P. brachyspondylus'' as a ''Pliosaurus'' with approximately 60 (58 according to Benson ''et al.'' (2013)) teeth in the lower jaw, 9 pairs of symphyseal teeth in dorsal view. It had \"type II\" retroarticular process and proportionally shorter humeri than ''P. funkei''. As also seen in CAMSM J.29564, it had cervical centra with ventral surface ornamentation, but lacking a ventral keel. According to Benson ''et al.''

(2012) diagnosed the species based on a unique combination of characters of the holotype. ''P. funkei'' has a possibly unique \"type I\" retroarticular process, unlike ''P. brachydeirus'', ''P. brachyspondylus'' and ''P. macromerus''. Unlike ''P. brachydeirus'', its cervical centra possess a rugose ventral surface, but lack ventral keel. Finally, it possesses comparatively longer forelimbs than other known pliosaurids, with a long humerus, more than 7 times the average width of cervical vertebral centra, in comparison to ''P. brachyspondylus'' and ''P. rossicus'', which have humeri less than 4.5 times the cervical width. Its complete teeth count is not known, however, it has at least six pairs of teeth in the mandibular symphysis, and at least five premaxillary tooth pairs. The two known individuals of ''P. funkei'' preserve mostly different regions of the skeleton and overlap only by cervical vertebrae. Nevertheless, these cervical vertebrae are morphologically indistinguishable, and both individuals were found in proximity to one another, at exactly the same stratigraphic horizon of the Slottsm\u00f8ya member, strongly supporting the referral of PMO 214.136 to ''P. funkei''. Knutsen ''et al.'' (2012) suggested that ''P. funkei'' is more similar to ''P. rossicus'' and the proposed neotype of ''P. macromerus'' than to ''P. brachydeirus'' and the proposed neotype of ''P. brachyspondylus'' in its cranial morphology.<ref name=P.funkei/>\n\nAnalysis of bones from the four flippers suggest that the animal cruised using only the fore-flippers, using the back flippers for extra speed when pursuing and capturing prey.\n\nPredator X's brain was of a similar type and size, proportionally, to that of today's [[great white shark]], the team says.<ref name=NS />\n\nA television programme entitled ''[[Predator X (TV program)|Predator X]]'' first aired on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] in 2009.

The specimen was collected at Wyke Siltstone bed of [[Osmington Bay]], from the ''Rasenia cymodoce'' ammonite zone, Kimmeridge Clay Formation of the Ancholme Group, dating to the early Kimmeridgian. DORCM G.13,675 was collected over a period of eight years as pieces up to 60&nbsp;kg in mass weathered out of the sea-cliff of Black Head. Most pieces were collected from loose or fallen blocks without any permits required, while other parts were collected [[in situ]] and purchased from land owners. They were first identified as a pliosaurid skull by Richard Edmonds, Earth Sciences Manager for Dorset and East Devon Coast [[World Heritage Site]] Team. Due to its large size and completeness, the specimen gained extensive media coverage, and its acquisition was announced publicly in October 2009. Additional elements were later donated by Patrick Clarke and purchased from Shirley Swaine. DORCM G.13,675 went on display in Dorchester County Museum in July 2011, after being in preparation between March 2010 and March 2011. Preparation of the lower jaws took 200 hours and a further 365 hours were needed to complete preparation of the skull. ''P. kevani'' was first described and named by Roger B. J.

(2013) diagnosed the species based on four [[autapomorphies]] of the holotype. The subrectangular sheet of the maxilla extends anteriorly on alveolar surface of the premaxilla to contact the distalmost premaxillary alveolus, while in other species of ''Pliosaurus'' an interdigitating premaxilla-maxilla suture is located midway between the mesialmost maxillary and distalmost premaxillary alveoli. Its pineal foramen is surrounded by a raised rim, while other [[thalassophonea]]ns have a shallow fossa containing anteroposteriorly oriented grooves or ridges, that extends anteriorly from the pineal foramen. The mesial postsymphysial dentary alveoli are everted to face dorsolaterally, and not dorsally as seen in other species. Finally, the lateral surface of the mandible dorsoventrally [[wikt:Special:Search/concave|concave]] posteriorly, while other thalassophoneans show flat or weakly convex lateral surface of the postedentary bones. ''P. kevani'' also possesses a unique combination of characters, including: high dentary alveolar count including 22 postsymphysial alveoli and an estimated total count of 36\u201337; high count of symphysial dentary alveoli including at least 7, estimated as 14\u201315; subtrihedral teeth, possessing a suboval cross-section with slightly flattened labial surface bearing only thinly distributed enamel ridges; pronounced mediolateral expansion of caniniform regions of the premaxilla and maxilla; six closely spaced premaxillary alveoli; anisodont premaxillary dentition; and premaxilla\u2013parietal suture located level with the anterior region of the orbit.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/>\n\nCAMSM J.35990, a complete [[postcrania]]l skeleton originally referred to ''Stretosaurus macromerus'', and later to ''Pliosaurus sp.'', might also pertain to ''P. kevani''. Although non-diagnostic at the species level, Benson ''et al.'' (2013) differentiated it from most specimens of ''Pliosaurus'' based on its subtrihedral teeth, which are otherwise present only in ''Pliosaurus kevani'', and possibly also in ''[[Gallardosaurus iturraldei]]'' from the [[Oxfordian (stage)|Oxfordian]] of [[Cuba]]. Even though it shares with the holotype of ''P. kevani'' a very large body size and stratigraphically closer to it, otherwise the specimens cannot be directly compared. Therefore, it was tentatively referred to as ''Pliosaurus'' cf. ''kevani''. A subtrihedral tooth from the Kimmeridge Clay of Ely, [[New Walk Museum and Art Gallery, Leicester|LEICT]] G418.1965.108, is also referred to ''Pliosaurus'' cf.

Knutsen (2012) noted that there is no overlap between the cranial portions of CAMSM J.35990 and NHMUK PV OR 39362 or OUMNH J.10454. Halstead (1989) referred a more recently discovered, complete specimen (NHMUK R8928) to ''P. brachyspondylus'' based on its long mandibular symphysis. Using this specimen he re-identified the \"[[scapula]]\" of CAMSM J.35990 as an [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]], but in spite of their similar ilial morphology, reassigned ''S. macromerus'' to ''[[Liopleurodon]]''.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/> According to No\u00e8 ''et al.'' (2004), the specimens of ''S. macromerus'' should be referred to ''P. macromerus'' as the name ''Stretosaurus'' is invalid, and NHMUK PV OR 39362 and CAMSM J.35990 exhibit the [[autapomorphies|autapomorphic]] trihedral teeth of ''Pliosaurus''.<ref name=Noeetal2004/>\n[[File:Pliosaurus grandis paddle.JPG|thumb|left|Paddle referred to ''P. grandis'']] \nKnutsen (2012) suggested to replace the lectotype of ''P. macromerus'', with NHMUK PV OR 39362 as a [[neotype]], because the lectotype (as well as the remaining [[syntype]]s) is indistinguishable from all species of ''Pliosaurus'', apart from ''P. brachydeirus'' due to vertebral ornamentation. NHMUK PV OR 39362 is much more complete and can be distinguished from all other species of ''Pliosaurus''. NHMUK PV OR 39362 has been traditionally assigned to ''P. macromerus'', and even though it has previously been assigned to ''P. grandis'', Lydekker (1889a) showed that there is no evidence that the syntypes of ''P. grandis'' even belong to ''Pliosaurus'', and there is no overlapping material between them and NHMUK PV OR 39362.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/> Benson ''et al.'' (2013) agreed with the suggestion to assign a neotype of ''P. macromerus'', but considered it to be [[Thalassophonea]] indet., until a petition to the ICZN is made.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/> Based on NHMUK PV OR 39362, Knutsen (2012) provisionally diagnosed ''P. brachyspondylus'' as a ''Pliosaurus'' with at least 50 teeth in the lower jaw (probably 54), at least 7 pairs (probably 9) of symphyseal teeth and 5 pairs of premaxillary teeth. It also has \"type III\" retroarticular process. Benson ''et al.'' (2013) noted that it lacks anisodont premaxillary dentition.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/><ref name=Pliosaurus2013/>\n\nOther specimens previously referred to ''P. macromerus'' are currently assigned to other species of ''Pliosaurus''. Knutsen (2012) referred CAMSM J.35990 to ''Pliosaurus sp.'', stating that it is non-diagnostic at the species level. Benson ''et al.'' (2013) agreed that it cannot be confidently diagnosed as a distinct species, or referred to an existing species with certainty. Nevertheless, they differentiated CAMSM J.35990 from most specimens of ''Pliosaurus'' based on its subtrihedral teeth, which are otherwise present only in ''Pliosaurus kevani'', and possibly also in ''[[Gallardosaurus iturraldei]]'' from the [[Oxfordian (stage)|Oxfordian]] of [[Cuba]]. Furthermore, it shares with ''P. kevani'' a very large body size and stratigraphically closer to ''P. kevani'', but cannot be otherwise compared to it. Therefore, it was tentatively referred to as ''Pliosaurus'' cf. ''kevani''.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/> According to Knutsen (2012), OUMNH J.10454 is referable to ''P. macromerus'', together with two associated fragments, OUMNH J.50376 and OUMNH J.50377, each constituting one ramus of a lower jaw from a single individual. All three specimens were collected from the same pit, are of similar size, and have \"type III\" retroarticular process. The referral to ''P. macromerus'' was based on this trait, a suggested similar symphyseal tooth count (six) between OUMNH J.10454 and the proposed neotype of ''P. macromerus'', and their occurrence at approximately the same stratigraphic level.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/> However, a reexamination of NHMUK PV OR 39362 (proposed neotype of ''P. macromerus'') by Benson ''et al.'' (2013), revealed that it had at least seven symphyseal tooth, but more likely nine. Therefore, they considered ''P. rossicus'' to be a valid species of ''Pliosaurus'' based on the presence of an autapomorphic short symphysis containing only six alveoli, and tentatively referred OUMNH J.10454 (and thus possibly OUMNH J.50376 and OUMNH J.50377) to ''P. ? rossicus''. Another possible difference between NHMUK PV OR 39362 and OUMNH J.10454, is that the latter had greater mandibular tooth count of approximately 60,<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/> however this is possibly an artifact of its reconstruction according to Knutsen (2012).<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/>\n\n===''Pliosaurus rossicus''===\n''P. rossicus'' was first described and named by [[Nestor Ivanovich Novozhilov]] in [[1948 in paleontology|1948]]. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] is derived from the name of [[Russia]], where the holotype was found. The [[holotype]] of ''P. rossicus'', PIN 304/1 housed at [[Paleontological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences]], consists of cranial and some postcranial remains of a relatively small pliosaur. It was collected at the right bank of the [[Volga River]], of [[Chuvashia]], European part of [[Russia]], from the Buinsk Mine oil shales, ''Dorsoplanites panderi'' ammonite zone, dating to the middle Volgian stage (also known as middle [[Tithonian]]).<ref name=Novozhilov1948>{{cite journal | last1 = Novozhilov | first1 = N.I. | year = 1948 | title = Two new pliosaurs from the Lower Volga Beds Provolzhe (Right bank of Volga) | url = | journal = Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 115\u2013118 }}</ref> Novozhilov (1964) later also described some pectoral remains associated with the holotype.<ref name=Novozhilov1964>{{cite journal | last1 = Novozhilov | first1 = N.I. | year = 1964 | title = Order Sauropterygia | url = | journal = Osnovy Paleontologii | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 309\u2013332 }}</ref> The holotype preserved trihedral teeth like other members of ''Pliosaurus'', and bears 6 tooth pairs in the mandibular symphysis, similar to OUMNH J.10454. Halstead (1971) reassigned this species to ''Liopleurodon'' based on this symphyseal tooth count,<ref name=Halstead1971/> but Knutsen (2012) and Benson ''et al.'' (2013) referred it back to ''Pliosaurus'', as it exhibits the diagnostic traits of the genus such as trihedral teeth.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/> PIN 304/1 has also been interpreted as a juvenile by both Halstead (1971) and Storrs ''et al.'' (2000) based on its relatively small size and poorly developed dorsal blade and anteroventral ramus of the scapula.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/>\n[[File:Pliosaurus rossicus.jpg|thumb|''P. rossicus'' restoration]]\nHalstead (1971) referred a second, larger specimen PIN 2440/1 consisting of a partial [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] and hind limb, to ''P. rossicus''.<ref name=Halstead1971>{{cite journal | last1 = Halstead | first1 = L.

''grandis'' by Rozhdestvenskii (1947), but later referred to ''P. rossicus'' based on the presence of a similar number of mandibular symphyseal teeth with the holotye and their relative stratigraphic co-occurrence. Another specimen of large pliosaur was tentatively assigned to ''P. rossicus'' by Malakhov (1999). The specimen was collected from the lower Volgian (early Tithonian) of [[Kazakhstan]], and represents postcranial remains No. 13-1958, at Institute of Zoology MS-AS RK.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/>\n \nKnutsen (2012) suggested possible synonymy between ''P. macromerus'' and ''P. rossicus'' based on the presence of only six symphysial and five premaxillary alveoli in both. Nevertheless, he provisionally retained ''P. rossicus'' as a separate species, as the stratigraphic ranges of the two taxa do not overlap, and the specimens were not adequate described.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/> However, a reexamination of NHMUK PV OR 39362 (proposed neotype of ''P. macromerus'') by Benson ''et al.'' (2013), revealed that it had at least seven symphyseal tooth, but more likely nine. Therefore, they considered ''P. rossicus'' to be a valid species of ''Pliosaurus'' based on the presence of an autapomorphic short symphysis containing only six alveoli. Based on the presence of this trait, they tentatively referred OUMNH J.10454 (and thus possibly OUMNH J.50376 and OUMNH J.50377) to ''P. ? rossicus''.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/> These specimens were all collected at Chawley brick pit, of the upper part of the Lower Kimmeridge Clay, dating to the late Kimmeridgian, and were originally assigned to ''P. macromerus''.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/> OXFUM J.10454 is a highly reconstructed and fragmentary specimen, with a total length of {{convert|287.5|cm|ft|abbr=on}}. Tarlo estimated that the skull length of this individual had originally been more than {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}},<ref name=Tarlo1959b/> however Benson ''et al.'' (2013) argued that this cannot be currently determined. Apart from the [[autapomorphy]] noted above<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/> and trihedral teeth, ''P. rossicus'' possesses the following combination of characters (based on its holotype): 5 premaxillary tooth pairs; cervical vertebrae with ornamented ventral surface, but lacking ventral keel; proportionally shorter humeri than ''P. funkei'', less than 4.5 times the average width of cervical centra, versus more than 7 times.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/>\n\n===''Pliosaurus westburyensis''===\n[[File:Pliosaurus westburyensis BRSMG cc332.JPG|thumb|right|The skull of BRSMG Cc332]]\n''P. westburyensis'' is known solely from the [[holotype]] BRSMG Cc332, a nearly complete [[skull]] and postcranial fragments, including four [[cervical vertebrae]] housed at [[Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery]], Bristol. The specimen was collected at the Westbury Clay pit, [[Wiltshire]], England, from subdivision E5 of the ''Aulacostephanus eudoxus'' ammonite zone, one metre below the [[Crussoliceras Limestone]] of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation, dating to the late Kimmeridgian.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/> Nicknamed \"Westbury pliosaur I\", it was first described by Taylor & Cruickshank (1993) and referred to ''P. brachyspondylus'' based on the absence of a ventral keel on the cervical vertebral centra.<ref name=TaylorCruickshank1993/> BRSMG Cc332 was assigned tentatively to ''Pliosaurus sp.'' by Sassoon ''et al.'' (2012) and Knutsen (2012)<ref name=Sassoonetal2012/><ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/> and reassigned to its own species by Roger B. J. Benson, Mark Evans, Adam S. Smith, Judyth Sassoon, Scott Moore-Faye, Hilary F. Ketchum and Richard Forrest in [[2013 in paleontology|2013]]. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] honours the town of [[Westbury, Wiltshire|Westbury]] near which the holotype was found.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/>\n\nThe mandible of BRSMG Cc332 is approximately 50&nbsp;cm longer than CAMSM J.35991 (proposed neotype for ''P. brachyspondylus''), but is shorter than the two French specimens referred to ''P. brachyspondylus''. Knutsen (2012) distinguished BRSMG Cc332 from ''P. brachyspondylus'' as the former has a \"type IV\" retroarticular process and a much lower degree of fusion between the anterior mandibular bones.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/> Benson ''et al.'' (2013) diagnosed the species based on three [[autapomorphies]]. ''P. westburyensis'' has widely spaced premaxillary alveoli, with interalveolar walls approximately half the anteroposterior length of a single alveolus. It also has a long, sheet-like process of the maxilla that extends back to the anterolateral part of the maxilla\u2013frontal contact medial to the external naris, and terminates just anterior to midlength of the orbital. Finally, the suture between the [[premaxilla]] and [[parietal bone]] is located around orbital midlength. ''P. westburyensis'' also possesses a unique combination of characters, including: low dentary alveolar count including only 18 postsymphysial alveoli; teeth fully trihedral in cross-section, possessing a flat, anteroposteriorly broad labial surface lacking enamel ridges; relatively slight mediolateral expansion of premaxilla and maxillary caniniform region; six premaxillary alveoli; lack of anisodont premaxillary dentition; lack of diastema between maxillary and premaxillary alveolar rows; and cervical centra lacking ventral ridge.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/>\n\n===Other species===\n[[File:Plesiosaurus chilensis paddle.jpg|thumb|Paddle of ''P. chilensis'']] \nApart from the species listed above, only ''Pliosaurus irgisensis'' might represent another valid species of ''Pliosaurus''. It was first described and named by [[Nestor Ivanovich Novozhilov]] in [[1948 in paleontology|1948]], under the name ''[[Peloneustes]] irgisensis''. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] is derived from the name of the [[Maly Irgiz River]], where the holotype was found. The [[holotype]], PIN 426 housed at [[Paleontological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences]], consists of partial cranium and postcranium of a medium-sized individual. The cranial remains of PIN 426 are currently suffering from the effects of [[Pyrite|pyrite decay]], and its associated remains have been lost. It was collected at Savel-evsk Mine No. 1, of eastern [[Saratov Oblast]], European part of [[Russia]], from the middle Volgian stage (also known as middle [[Tithonian]]). Novozhilov (1964) reassigned the material to a new genus, ''Strongylokrotaphus'', meaning \"round\" (''strongylos'') \"[[temple (anatomy)|temple]]\" or \"head\" (''krotaphos'') in [[Ancient Greek]]. These assignments were criticized by other workers, including Tarlo (1960), Halstead (1971) and Storrs ''et al.'' (2000), because of the general and non-specific diagnosis for ''Strongylokrotaphus'', and differences from the type species of ''Peloneustes''. ''P. irgisensis'' might be synonymous with ''P. rossicus'' based on their similar sizes and stratigraphic co-occurrence, as the only difference between the species is [[Ontogeny|ontogenetic]]. Knutsen (2012) considered the material to be non-diagnostic and referred ''P. irgisensis'' to [[Pliosauridae]] indet, as dentition, which is autapomorphic in ''Pliosaurus'', was not described from PIN 426.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/> Benson ''et al.'' (2013) also considered this species to be a ''[[nomen dubium]]'', referring it to [[Thalassophonea]] indet, and stating that PIN 426 requires re-description.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/>\n\n''Pliosaurus portentificus'' is known from the late Kimmeridgian of England. Considered by Knutsen (2012) and Benson ''et al.'' (2013) to be a ''[[nomen dubium]]'', with its holotype specimen most likely being a juvenile individual of one of the other species of ''Pliosaurus''<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/><ref name=Pliosaurus2013/>\n\n==Phylogeny==\nThe [[cladogram]] below follows a 2013 analysis by paleontologists Benson ''et al''.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/>\n\n{{clade| style=font-size:85%;line-height:85%\n|label1=[[Pliosauridae]]\n|1={{clade\n   |1=''[[Thalassiodracon hawkinsii]]''\n   |2={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n         |1=''[[Hauffiosaurus longirostris]]''\n         |2=''[[Hauffiosaurus tomistomimus]]''\n         |3=''[[Hauffiosaurus zanoni]]''}}\n      |2={{clade\n         |1=''[[Attenborosaurus conybeari]]''\n            |2={{clade\n               |1=''[[Marmornectes candrewi]]''\n               |label2=[[Thalassophonea]]\n               |2={{clade\n                  |1=''[[Peloneustes philarchus]]''\n                  |2={{clade\n                     |1='''''\"Pliosaurus\" andrewsi'''''\n                     |2={{clade\n                        |1=''[[Simolestes vorax]]''\n                        |2={{clade\n                           |1=''[[Liopleurodon ferox]]''\n                           |2={{clade\n                              |label1=[[Brachaucheninae]]\n                              |1={{clade\n                                 |1=''[[Kronosaurus]] sp'' <small>(MCZ 1285)</small>\n                                 |2={{clade\n                                    |1=MNA V9433\n                                    |2=''[[Brachauchenius lucasi]]''\n                                    |3=''[[Megacephalosaurus eulerti]]''\n                                    |4=''[[Polyptychodon interruptus]]'' <small>(DOKDM G/1\u20132)</small>}} }}\n                              |label2='''''Pliosaurus'''''\n                              |2={{clade\n                                 |1='''''Pliosaurus brachydeirus'''''\n                                 |2='''''Pliosaurus brachyspondylus''''' <small>(proposed neotype)</small>\n                                 |3='''''Pliosaurus macromerus''''' <small>(proposed neotype)</small>\n                                 |4='''''Pliosaurus westburyensis'''''\n                                 |5='''''Pliosaurus almanzaensis'''''\n                                 |6={{clade\n                                    |1={{clade\n                                       |1='''''Pliosaurus'' cf.

However, because this spelling had been abandoned since Phillips (1871), ''Pliosaurus'' should be preserved according to Article 33.3.1 of the ICZN.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/> The [[name of a biological genus|generic name]] is derived from \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c9\u03bd, ''pleion'', meaning \"more\" and \u03c3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, ''sauros'', meaning \"lizard\" in [[Ancient Greek]], in reference to Owen' belief that ''Pliosaurus'' was more closely related to \"[[sauria]]ns\" (including [[crocodilia]]ns) than ''Plesiosaurus'' was.<ref name=Owen1841/> The etymology of the [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] was not specified, but it probably refers to the shorter teeth of ''P. brachydeirus'' compared to teeth of other species then referred to ''Plesiosaurus''.<ref name=Owen1842/> The specific name has occasionally erroneously been spelled as ''brachydirus'', for example by [[Richard Lydekker]] (1889a, 1889b).<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/>\n[[File:Pliosaurus brachydeirus flipper (cast), Wrexham Museum (3)..JPG|thumb|Cast of a flipper referred to ''P. brachydeirus'']] \n''P. brachydeirus'' is known from the [[holotype]] which includes seven specimens found in association and housed at [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]], OUMNH J.9245, OUMNH J.9247 through OUMNH J.9301 and OUMNH J.10453. The specimen consists of a partial [[skull]] and [[lower jaw]], several [[vertebral column|axial]] elements and limb material. Other specimens that are referable to this species include OUMNH J.9285, and OUMNH J.9192 through OUMNH J.9301, all described by Owen (1841\u20131842) and were found associated with the holotype. The specimens were collected by Prof. [[William Buckland]]<ref name=Owen1841/> at [[Market Rasen]], [[Lincolnshire]], from the ''Rasenia cymodoce'' ammonite zone of the lower [[Kimmeridge Clay Formation]], dating to the early [[Kimmeridgian]] stage.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/><ref name=Pliosaurus2013/>\n\nKnutsen (2012) revised the validity of this species and was able to diagnose it on a basis of combination of traits. ''P. brachydeirus'' had approximately 70 teeth in the lower jaw (72 according to Benson ''et al.'' (2013)), 8-9 or more pairs of symphyseal teeth in dorsal view (12 pairs according to Benson ''et al.'' (2013)) and 5 or more [[premaxilla]]ry teeth. It shows \"type III\" retroarticular process and [[autapomorphies|autapomorphic]] (unique) traits of the [[cervical vertebrae]], which had a smooth ventral surface and a ventral keel, unlike rounded to flat ventral surface seen in other species. Benson ''et al.'' (2013) also noted that it lacks anisodont premaxillary dentition. The [[ontogenetic stage]] of the holotype of ''P. brachydeirus'' is not known, but the rounded edge on the distal end of the femur and lack of separation between the femoral capitulum and trochanter suggests that it is from a relatively young individual. According to Benson ''et al.'' (2013), the flat morphology of the proximal surface of the radius or tibia also suggests that it is a juvenile.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/><ref name=Pliosaurus2013/>\n\n===''Pliosaurus brachyspondylus''===\n[[File:Pliosaurus brachyspondylus kimmeridgian francia.JPG|thumb|uprigh|upright|Lower jaw from France, MNHN cat.24.1, previously referred to ''P. brachyspondylus'']] \n''Pliosaurus brachyspondylus'' was first described and named by Owen in [[1839 in paleontology|1839]], as a species of ''[[Plesiosaurus]]''. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] is derived from \u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03c5\u03c2, ''brachus'', meaning \"short\" and \u03c3\u03c0\u03cc\u03bd\u03b4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, ''spondylos'', meaning \"vertebra\" in [[Ancient Greek]].<ref name=Owen1839>{{cite journal | last1 = Owen | first1 = Richard | year = 1839 | title = Report on British fossil reptiles, part 1 | journal = Report of the Ninth Meeting for the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Birmingham | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 43\u2013126 }}</ref> It was named on the basis of a series of unassociated [[cervical vertebrae]] as the [[holotype]]. These specimens were collected at [[Headington]] Pits near Oxford, [[Oxfordshire]], England, from the [[Kimmeridge Clay]]. It was later noted by Pocock (1908), that the material was found in the lower part of the Kimmeridge Clay, as the pits expose the contact between the Kimmeridge Clay Formation and the underlying Corallian beds. Several other cervical centra from the same strata at [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], Dorsetshire, that had been named ''Plesiosaurus giganteus'' by Conybeare (1824), were also referred to ''Plesiosaurus brachyspondylus'' by Owen (1839). Eichwald (1868) reassigned ''P. brachyspondylus'' to ''Pliosaurus'' but did not provide diagnosis to distinguished these vertebrae from those of the type species of the genus. ''P. giganteus'' was later synonymised by Lydekker (1889a) with ''P. brachydeirus'', the type species.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/>\n\nAccording to Tarlo (1959a), the holotypes of ''P. giganteus'' and ''P. brachyspondylus'' have been lost or destroyed since their initial descriptions.<ref name=Tarlo1959a>{{cite journal | last1 = Tarlo | first1 = Lambert Beverly | year = 1959 | title = ''Pliosaurus brachyspondylus'' (Owen) from the Kimmeridge Clay | journal = Palaeontology | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 283\u2013291 }}</ref> Therefore, he selected a single posterior cervical centrum, CAMSM J.29564, as the [[neotype]] of ''P. brachyspondylus'', while ''P. giganteus'' became a ''[[nomen oblitum]]'', forgotten name, as ''P. brachyspondylus'' had traditionally been given priority over it. This centrum was the only not dorsal centrum from a series of thirty associated centra listed by [[Harry Seeley]] (1869) as belonging to ''P. brachyspondylus''. They were collected at the Roswell (Roslyn) pit near [[Ely, Cambridgeshire]], also in England, from between the ''Aulacostephanus mutabilis'' or ''Aulacostephanus eudoxus'' ammonite zones, of the lower Kimmeridge Clay Formation. Although the measurements of the neotype agree with these of the lost holotype, they are also similar to these of referred specimens of ''P. brachydeirus'' (OUMNH J.9291-9301) and ''[[Pliosaurus andrewsi|\"Pliosaurus\" andrewsi]]'' (NHMUK R.1243, cast of mid-cervical centrum referred to ''P. evansi''). Additionally, Seeley's referral was based on a single character, \"articular surface is very slightly concave, with a small round depression at the centre\", a feature that is now known to be common in other [[pliosaurid]]s as well. Thus, Tarlo's choice of the neotype of ''P. brachyspondylus'' relies solely on the similarity in size to the original material described by Owen (1839), which is also similar to ''P. brachydeirus''.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/> The neotype centrum, CAMSM J.29564, differs from the holotype of ''P. brachydeirus'' in the following two traits; it has ventral surface ornamentation but lacks a ventral keel. Nevertheless, the neotype for ''P. brachyspondylus'' is non-diagnostic from other species of ''Pliosaurus'', and thus the name must be considered a ''[[nomen dubium]]''.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/><ref name=Pliosaurus2013/>\n\nIn the same paper, Tarlo (1959a) described an associated pliosaur skeleton, CAMSM J.35991, and referred it to ''P. brachyspondylus''.<ref name=Tarlo1959a/> CAMSM J.35991 consists of a complete [[mandible]], most of the axial skeleton and parts of the [[appendicular skeleton]]. It was found in 1889 in the ''Aulacostephanus eudoxus'' ammonite zone of the lower Kimmeridge Clay, at the same locality as CAMSM J.29564 (the neotype for ''P. brachyspondylus''). Knutsen (2012) suggested to replace the neotype for ''P. brachyspondylus'', with CAMSM J.35991 as the new neotype, because both specimens and possibly the lost holotype are from the same locality and horizon, and similar in size. CAMSM J.35991 is much more complete and can be distinguished from all other species of ''Pliosaurus''.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/> Benson ''et al.'' (2013) agreed with this suggestion, but considered ''P. brachyspondylus'' to be [[Thalassophonea]] indet., until a petition to the ICZN is made.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/> Based on CAMSM J.35991, Knutsen (2012) provisionally diagnosed ''P. brachyspondylus'' as a ''Pliosaurus'' with approximately 60 (58 according to Benson ''et al.'' (2013)) teeth in the lower jaw, 9 pairs of symphyseal teeth in dorsal view. It had \"type II\" retroarticular process and proportionally shorter humeri than ''P. funkei''. As also seen in CAMSM J.29564, it had cervical centra with ventral surface ornamentation, but lacking a ventral keel. According to Benson ''et al.'' (2013), the flat morphology of the proximal surface of the radius or tibia suggests that CAMSM J.35991 is a juvenile.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/><ref name=Pliosaurus2013/>\n\nAccording to Knutsen (2012), Bardet ''et al.'' (1993) referred two additional [[mandible]]s to ''P. brachyspondylus'' based solely on a similar number of dentary and symphyseal teeth; [[Mus\u00e9e-sur-Mer|BHN]] 2R.370, collected at the Moulin-Wibert quarry, from the ''Rasenia cymodoce'' ammonite zone of the [[Calcaires de Moulin-Wibert Formation]] of Nord-Pas-de-Calais, and [[Mus\u00e9um national d'Histoire naturelle|MNHN]] cat.24.1 collected at [[Le Havre]], [[Normandy]], both from the early Kimmeridgian of [[France]].<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/> Benson ''et al.'' (2013) discussed only BHN 2R.370 originally referred to ''Pliosaurus grandis'', stating that ''P. carpenteri'' has a similar count of dentary and symphysial teeth, and thus the specimen cannot be identified to species level. However it was referred to ''Pliosaurus'' indet. as it has a broad, dorsolaterally facing surangular fossa, bounded laterally by a fossa and ridge.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/> Another specimen, BRSMG Cc332, was referred to ''P. brachyspondylus'' by Taylor and Cruickshank (1993) and to ''Pliosaurus sp.'' by Sassoon ''et al.''

The specimen was collected at the Westbury Clay pit, [[Wiltshire]], from subdivision E4 of the ''Aulacostephanus eudoxus'' ammonite zone, seven metres below the [[Crussoliceras Limestone]] of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation, dating to the late Kimmeridgian.

(2012) diagnosed the species based on a unique combination of characters of the holotype. ''P. funkei'' has a possibly unique \"type I\" retroarticular process, unlike ''P. brachydeirus'', ''P. brachyspondylus'' and ''P. macromerus''. Unlike ''P. brachydeirus'', its cervical centra possess a rugose ventral surface, but lack ventral keel. Finally, it possesses comparatively longer forelimbs than other known pliosaurids, with a long humerus, more than 7 times the average width of cervical vertebral centra, in comparison to ''P. brachyspondylus'' and ''P. rossicus'', which have humeri less than 4.5 times the cervical width. Its complete teeth count is not known, however, it has at least six pairs of teeth in the mandibular symphysis, and at least five premaxillary tooth pairs. The two known individuals of ''P. funkei'' preserve mostly different regions of the skeleton and overlap only by cervical vertebrae. Nevertheless, these cervical vertebrae are morphologically indistinguishable, and both individuals were found in proximity to one another, at exactly the same stratigraphic horizon of the Slottsm\u00f8ya member, strongly supporting the referral of PMO 214.136 to ''P. funkei''. Knutsen ''et al.'' (2012) suggested that ''P. funkei'' is more similar to ''P. rossicus'' and the proposed neotype of ''P. macromerus'' than to ''P. brachydeirus'' and the proposed neotype of ''P. brachyspondylus'' in its cranial morphology.<ref name=P.funkei/>\n\nAnalysis of bones from the four flippers suggest that the animal cruised using only the fore-flippers, using the back flippers for extra speed when pursuing and capturing prey.\n\nPredator X's brain was of a similar type and size, proportionally, to that of today's [[great white shark]], the team says.<ref name=NS />\n\nA television programme entitled ''[[Predator X (TV program)|Predator X]]'' first aired on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] in 2009.

The specimen was collected at Wyke Siltstone bed of [[Osmington Bay]], from the ''Rasenia cymodoce'' ammonite zone, Kimmeridge Clay Formation of the Ancholme Group, dating to the early Kimmeridgian. DORCM G.13,675 was collected over a period of eight years as pieces up to 60&nbsp;kg in mass weathered out of the sea-cliff of Black Head. Most pieces were collected from loose or fallen blocks without any permits required, while other parts were collected [[in situ]] and purchased from land owners. They were first identified as a pliosaurid skull by Richard Edmonds, Earth Sciences Manager for Dorset and East Devon Coast [[World Heritage Site]] Team. Due to its large size and completeness, the specimen gained extensive media coverage, and its acquisition was announced publicly in October 2009. Additional elements were later donated by Patrick Clarke and purchased from Shirley Swaine. DORCM G.13,675 went on display in Dorchester County Museum in July 2011, after being in preparation between March 2010 and March 2011. Preparation of the lower jaws took 200 hours and a further 365 hours were needed to complete preparation of the skull. ''P. kevani'' was first described and named by Roger B. J. Benson, Mark Evans, Adam S. Smith, Judyth Sassoon, Scott Moore-Faye, Hilary F. Ketchum and Richard Forrest in [[2013 in paleontology|2013]]. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] honors Kevan Sheehan, the owner of a small caf\u00e9 overlooking the sea at Osmington Mills, who collected most of the holotype during daily walks along the foreshore.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/>\n[[File:Teeth of Pliosaurus kevani.png|thumb|upright|Teeth of ''P. kevani'']] \nBenson ''et al.'' (2013) diagnosed the species based on four [[autapomorphies]] of the holotype. The subrectangular sheet of the maxilla extends anteriorly on alveolar surface of the premaxilla to contact the distalmost premaxillary alveolus, while in other species of ''Pliosaurus'' an interdigitating premaxilla-maxilla suture is located midway between the mesialmost maxillary and distalmost premaxillary alveoli. Its pineal foramen is surrounded by a raised rim, while other [[thalassophonea]]ns have a shallow fossa containing anteroposteriorly oriented grooves or ridges, that extends anteriorly from the pineal foramen. The mesial postsymphysial dentary alveoli are everted to face dorsolaterally, and not dorsally as seen in other species. Finally, the lateral surface of the mandible dorsoventrally [[wikt:Special:Search/concave|concave]] posteriorly, while other thalassophoneans show flat or weakly convex lateral surface of the postedentary bones. ''P. kevani'' also possesses a unique combination of characters, including: high dentary alveolar count including 22 postsymphysial alveoli and an estimated total count of 36\u201337; high count of symphysial dentary alveoli including at least 7, estimated as 14\u201315; subtrihedral teeth, possessing a suboval cross-section with slightly flattened labial surface bearing only thinly distributed enamel ridges; pronounced mediolateral expansion of caniniform regions of the premaxilla and maxilla; six closely spaced premaxillary alveoli; anisodont premaxillary dentition; and premaxilla\u2013parietal suture located level with the anterior region of the orbit.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/>\n\nCAMSM J.35990, a complete [[postcrania]]l skeleton originally referred to ''Stretosaurus macromerus'', and later to ''Pliosaurus sp.'', might also pertain to ''P. kevani''. Although non-diagnostic at the species level, Benson ''et al.'' (2013) differentiated it from most specimens of ''Pliosaurus'' based on its subtrihedral teeth, which are otherwise present only in ''Pliosaurus kevani'', and possibly also in ''[[Gallardosaurus iturraldei]]'' from the [[Oxfordian (stage)|Oxfordian]] of [[Cuba]]. Even though it shares with the holotype of ''P. kevani'' a very large body size and stratigraphically closer to it, otherwise the specimens cannot be directly compared. Therefore, it was tentatively referred to as ''Pliosaurus'' cf. ''kevani''. A subtrihedral tooth from the Kimmeridge Clay of Ely, [[New Walk Museum and Art Gallery, Leicester|LEICT]] G418.1965.108, is also referred to ''Pliosaurus'' cf.

Lydekker (1889a) amended the ''Pleiosaurus macromerus'' into ''Pliosaurus'', and reassigned NHMUK PV OR 39362 to this species with other material, based solely on large size.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/> NHMUK PV OR 39362, a complete skull and mandible, was first described by Owen (1869) who referred it to ''Pliosaurus grandis''.

Tarlo (1959b) also erected a new generic name for ''P. macromerus'', ''Stretosaurus'', due to the unusual scapular morphology of a specimen he described and referred to it, CAMSM J.35990.<ref name=Tarlo1959b/> It was found at [[Stretham]], southwest of Ely in [[Cambridgeshire]], probably from the early Kimmeridgian ''Aulacostephanus mutabilis'' ammonite zone. It represents an associated fragmentary skull and a relatively complete [[postcranial]] skeleton. Tarlo (1959b) referred CAMSM J.35990, and two other very large, anterior cervical vertebral centra, CAMSM J.29562 and CAMSM J.30057, to ''Stretosaurus macromerus'' based on similar size and ornamentation of the cervical vertebrae. Knutsen (2012) noted that this ornamentation is shared with ''P. westburyensis'' and the proposed neotype of ''P. brachyspondylus''.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/>\n\nBased on similar number of mandibular symphyseal teeth with NHMUK PV OR 39362, Tarlo (1959b) also assigned to ''S. macromerus'' a partial [[mandible]], OUMNH J.10454, represented by an anterior rostral tip and associated trihedral teeth.<ref name=Tarlo1959b/> Nicknamed \"Cumnor mandible\", it was collected at Chawley brick pit, [[Oxfordshire]], alongside ''[[Cumnoria prestwichii]]''. This locality most likely belongs to the ''Aulacostephanus eudoxus'' or ''A. autissidorensis'' ammonite zone, of the upper part of the Lower Kimmeridge Clay. Knutsen (2012) noted that there is no overlap between the cranial portions of CAMSM J.35990 and NHMUK PV OR 39362 or OUMNH J.10454. Halstead (1989) referred a more recently discovered, complete specimen (NHMUK R8928) to ''P. brachyspondylus'' based on its long mandibular symphysis. Using this specimen he re-identified the \"[[scapula]]\" of CAMSM J.35990 as an [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]], but in spite of their similar ilial morphology, reassigned ''S. macromerus'' to ''[[Liopleurodon]]''.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/> According to No\u00e8 ''et al.'' (2004), the specimens of ''S. macromerus'' should be referred to ''P. macromerus'' as the name ''Stretosaurus'' is invalid, and NHMUK PV OR 39362 and CAMSM J.35990 exhibit the [[autapomorphies|autapomorphic]] trihedral teeth of ''Pliosaurus''.<ref name=Noeetal2004/>\n[[File:Pliosaurus grandis paddle.JPG|thumb|left|Paddle referred to ''P. grandis'']] \nKnutsen (2012) suggested to replace the lectotype of ''P. macromerus'', with NHMUK PV OR 39362 as a [[neotype]], because the lectotype (as well as the remaining [[syntype]]s) is indistinguishable from all species of ''Pliosaurus'', apart from ''P. brachydeirus'' due to vertebral ornamentation. NHMUK PV OR 39362 is much more complete and can be distinguished from all other species of ''Pliosaurus''. NHMUK PV OR 39362 has been traditionally assigned to ''P. macromerus'', and even though it has previously been assigned to ''P. grandis'', Lydekker (1889a) showed that there is no evidence that the syntypes of ''P. grandis'' even belong to ''Pliosaurus'', and there is no overlapping material between them and NHMUK PV OR 39362.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/> Benson ''et al.'' (2013) agreed with the suggestion to assign a neotype of ''P. macromerus'', but considered it to be [[Thalassophonea]] indet., until a petition to the ICZN is made.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/> Based on NHMUK PV OR 39362, Knutsen (2012) provisionally diagnosed ''P. brachyspondylus'' as a ''Pliosaurus'' with at least 50 teeth in the lower jaw (probably 54), at least 7 pairs (probably 9) of symphyseal teeth and 5 pairs of premaxillary teeth. It also has \"type III\" retroarticular process. Benson ''et al.'' (2013) noted that it lacks anisodont premaxillary dentition.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/><ref name=Pliosaurus2013/>\n\nOther specimens previously referred to ''P. macromerus'' are currently assigned to other species of ''Pliosaurus''. Knutsen (2012) referred CAMSM J.35990 to ''Pliosaurus sp.'', stating that it is non-diagnostic at the species level. Benson ''et al.'' (2013) agreed that it cannot be confidently diagnosed as a distinct species, or referred to an existing species with certainty. Nevertheless, they differentiated CAMSM J.35990 from most specimens of ''Pliosaurus'' based on its subtrihedral teeth, which are otherwise present only in ''Pliosaurus kevani'', and possibly also in ''[[Gallardosaurus iturraldei]]'' from the [[Oxfordian (stage)|Oxfordian]] of [[Cuba]]. Furthermore, it shares with ''P. kevani'' a very large body size and stratigraphically closer to ''P. kevani'', but cannot be otherwise compared to it. Therefore, it was tentatively referred to as ''Pliosaurus'' cf. ''kevani''.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/> According to Knutsen (2012), OUMNH J.10454 is referable to ''P. macromerus'', together with two associated fragments, OUMNH J.50376 and OUMNH J.50377, each constituting one ramus of a lower jaw from a single individual. All three specimens were collected from the same pit, are of similar size, and have \"type III\" retroarticular process. The referral to ''P. macromerus'' was based on this trait, a suggested similar symphyseal tooth count (six) between OUMNH J.10454 and the proposed neotype of ''P. macromerus'', and their occurrence at approximately the same stratigraphic level.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/> However, a reexamination of NHMUK PV OR 39362 (proposed neotype of ''P. macromerus'') by Benson ''et al.'' (2013), revealed that it had at least seven symphyseal tooth, but more likely nine. Therefore, they considered ''P. rossicus'' to be a valid species of ''Pliosaurus'' based on the presence of an autapomorphic short symphysis containing only six alveoli, and tentatively referred OUMNH J.10454 (and thus possibly OUMNH J.50376 and OUMNH J.50377) to ''P. ? rossicus''. Another possible difference between NHMUK PV OR 39362 and OUMNH J.10454, is that the latter had greater mandibular tooth count of approximately 60,<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/> however this is possibly an artifact of its reconstruction according to Knutsen (2012).<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/>\n\n===''Pliosaurus rossicus''===\n''P. rossicus'' was first described and named by [[Nestor Ivanovich Novozhilov]] in [[1948 in paleontology|1948]].

(2013) diagnosed the species based on three [[autapomorphies]]. ''P. westburyensis'' has widely spaced premaxillary alveoli, with interalveolar walls approximately half the anteroposterior length of a single alveolus. It also has a long, sheet-like process of the maxilla that extends back to the anterolateral part of the maxilla\u2013frontal contact medial to the external naris, and terminates just anterior to midlength of the orbital. Finally, the suture between the [[premaxilla]] and [[parietal bone]] is located around orbital midlength. ''P. westburyensis'' also possesses a unique combination of characters, including: low dentary alveolar count including only 18 postsymphysial alveoli; teeth fully trihedral in cross-section, possessing a flat, anteroposteriorly broad labial surface lacking enamel ridges; relatively slight mediolateral expansion of premaxilla and maxillary caniniform region; six premaxillary alveoli; lack of anisodont premaxillary dentition; lack of diastema between maxillary and premaxillary alveolar rows; and cervical centra lacking ventral ridge.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/>\n\n===Other species===\n[[File:Plesiosaurus chilensis paddle.jpg|thumb|Paddle of ''P. chilensis'']] \nApart from the species listed above, only ''Pliosaurus irgisensis'' might represent another valid species of ''Pliosaurus''. It was first described and named by [[Nestor Ivanovich Novozhilov]] in [[1948 in paleontology|1948]], under the name ''[[Peloneustes]] irgisensis''. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] is derived from the name of the [[Maly Irgiz River]], where the holotype was found. The [[holotype]], PIN 426 housed at [[Paleontological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences]], consists of partial cranium and postcranium of a medium-sized individual. The cranial remains of PIN 426 are currently suffering from the effects of [[Pyrite|pyrite decay]], and its associated remains have been lost. It was collected at Savel-evsk Mine No. 1, of eastern [[Saratov Oblast]], European part of [[Russia]], from the middle Volgian stage (also known as middle [[Tithonian]]). Novozhilov (1964) reassigned the material to a new genus, ''Strongylokrotaphus'', meaning \"round\" (''strongylos'') \"[[temple (anatomy)|temple]]\" or \"head\" (''krotaphos'') in [[Ancient Greek]]. These assignments were criticized by other workers, including Tarlo (1960), Halstead (1971) and Storrs ''et al.'' (2000), because of the general and non-specific diagnosis for ''Strongylokrotaphus'', and differences from the type species of ''Peloneustes''. ''P. irgisensis'' might be synonymous with ''P. rossicus'' based on their similar sizes and stratigraphic co-occurrence, as the only difference between the species is [[Ontogeny|ontogenetic]]. Knutsen (2012) considered the material to be non-diagnostic and referred ''P. irgisensis'' to [[Pliosauridae]] indet, as dentition, which is autapomorphic in ''Pliosaurus'', was not described from PIN 426.<ref name=KnutsenPliosaurus/> Benson ''et al.'' (2013) also considered this species to be a ''[[nomen dubium]]'', referring it to [[Thalassophonea]] indet, and stating that PIN 426 requires re-description.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013/>\n\n''Pliosaurus portentificus'' is known from the late Kimmeridgian of England. Considered by Knutsen (2012) and Benson ''et al.''
