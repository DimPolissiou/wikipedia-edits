Scholars have noted several important themes in the novel: the impact of heredity on behavior; racial superiority; civilization, especially as Tarzan struggles with his identity as a human; sexuality; and escapism.\n\n==Plot summary==\nJohn and Alice (Rutherford) Clayton, Viscount and Lady Greystoke from [[England]], are marooned in the western coastal [[jungle]]s of equatorial [[Africa]] in 1888.  Some time later, their son John Clayton II <ref>Tarzan of the Apes, Chapter XXV, where the following line (a diary entry by John Clayton, Tarzan's father) appears: \"Somehow, even against all reason, I seem to see him a grown man, taking his father's place in the world\u2014the second John Clayton\u2014and bringing added honors to the house of Greystoke.\"</ref> is born. When he is one year old his mother dies, and soon thereafter his father is killed by the savage king ape [[Kerchak]]. The infant is then adopted by the she-ape [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]].\n\nClayton is named \"Tarzan\" (\"White Skin\" in the [[Mangani|ape language]]) and raised in ignorance of his human heritage.\n\nAs a boy, feeling alienated from his peers due to their physical differences, he discovers his true parents' cabin, where he first learns of others like himself in their books. Using basic primers with pictures, over many years he teaches himself to read English, but having never heard it, cannot speak it.\n\nUpon his return from one visit to the cabin, he is attacked by a huge gorilla which he manages to kill with his father's knife, although he is terribly wounded in the struggle. As he grows up, Tarzan becomes a skilled hunter, exciting the jealousy of Kerchak, the ape leader, who finally attacks him. Tarzan kills Kerchak and takes his place as \"king\" of the apes.\n\nLater, a tribe of black Africans settle in the area, and Tarzan's adopted mother, Kala, is killed by one of its hunters. Avenging himself on the killer, Tarzan begins an antagonistic relationship with the tribe, raiding its village for weapons and practicing cruel pranks on them.  They, in turn, regard him as an evil spirit and attempt to placate him.\n\nA few years later when Tarzan is 21 years of age, a new party is marooned on the coast, including 19 year old [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]], the first white woman Tarzan has ever seen.  Tarzan's cousin, [[William Cecil Clayton]], unwitting usurper of the ape man's ancestral English estate, is also among the party. Tarzan spies on the newcomers, aids them in secret, and saves Jane from the perils of the jungle.\n\nAmong the party was French naval officer Paul D'Arnot. While rescuing D'Arnot from the natives, a rescue ship recovers the castaways. D'Arnot teaches Tarzan to speak French and offers to take Tarzan to the land of white men where he might connect with Jane again. On their journey, D'Arnot teaches him how to behave among white men.  In the ensuing months, Tarzan eventually learns to speak English, as well.\n\nUltimately, Tarzan travels to find Jane in [[Wisconsin]], USA where he rescues her from a fire. Tarzan learns the bitter news that she has become engaged to William Clayton. Meanwhile, clues from his parents' cabin have enabled D'Arnot to prove Tarzan's true identity as John Clayton II, the Earl of Greystoke.  Instead of reclaiming his inheritance from William, Tarzan chooses rather to conceal and renounce his heritage for the sake of Jane's happiness.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUczCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT95|title=Edgar Rice Burroughs: Master of Adventure|last=Lupoff|first=Richard A.|date=2015-08-27|publisher=Orion|isbn=9781473208711|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Characters in order of appearance==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*John Clayton, Earl of Greystoke\n*Alice Clayton (Rutherford), Countess of Greystoke\n*Captain Billings\n*Black Michael\n*Kerchak\n*Kala\n*Tarzan (a. k. a.

''The All-Story'' published it in its entirety in installments, and it was published in 1914 as a novel.<ref name=\":62\"/>\n\nThough ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' is sometimes cited as an influence on Burroughs' ''Tarzan of the Apes'', he claimed that his only inspiration was the Roman myth of [[Romulus and Remus]].<ref name=\":3\" /> [[Rudyard Kipling]] commented that Burroughs \"had 'jazzed' the motif of the Jungle Books and, I imagine, thoroughly enjoyed himself.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Rudyard|last=Kipling|title=Something of Myself|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.525263|year=1937|publisher=Macmillan & Co.|location=London}}</ref>\n\n== Major themes ==\nRecent [[literary criticism]] often focuses on the identity of the eponymous protagonist of ''Tarzan of the Apes.''  Literary scholars, such as Jeff Berglund, Mikko Tuhkanen, J. Michelle Coughlan, Bijana Oklop\u010di\u0107, and Catherine Jurca have examined the overlapping themes of Tarzan's heredity, race, civilized behavior, sexuality, and escapist appeal. Writers in popular culture, such as Gore Vidal, often emphasize Tarzan's escapist appeal.\n\n=== Heredity ===\nBurroughs himself acknowledged the centrality of the theme of heredity in the novel, and its conflict with the environment. According to his biographer, John Taliaferro, he claimed in a ''[[Writer's Digest|Writer\u2019s Digest]],'' \"I was mainly interested in playing with the idea of a contest between heredity and environment. For this purpose I selected an infant child of a race strongly marked by hereditary characteristics of the finer and nobler sort, and at an age at which he could not have been influenced by association with creatures of his own kind I threw him into an environment as diametrically opposite that to which he had been born as I might well conceive\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/tarzanforeverlif00tali/page/14|title=Tarzan Forever: The Life of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Creator of Tarzan|last1=Taliaferro|first1=John|date=1999|publisher=Scribner|isbn=0-684-83359-X|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/tarzanforeverlif00tali/page/14 14]}}</ref>\n\nThe scholar Jeff Burglund notices that although Tarzan was brought up in the jungle far from other humans, he is inexplicably drawn back to his parents\u2019 cabin and the objects which he finds there.<ref name=\":0\" />  He discovers a capacity for gentlemanly behavior around Jane despite no one teaching it to him.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Berglund|first1=Jeff|date=1999|title=Write, Right, White, Rite: Literacy, Imperialism, Race, and Cannibalism in Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan of the Apes|journal=Studies in American Literature|volume=27|issue=1|page=63|doi=10.1353/saf.1999.0011}}</ref>  Although the African tribes which he fights practice cannibalism, he suddenly feels revulsion when he considers eating one of the African men he kills.

She claims that Tarzan represents white, male opposition to the \"black rapist\" stereotype which was prevalent in the Southern U.S. at the time of its publication because the language which describes apes parallels propaganda against people of African descent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oklop\u010di\u0107|first=Biljana|date=|title=Adapting the Adapted: Adapting the Adapted: The Black Rapist Myth in E.R. Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes and Its Film Adaptations|url=|journal=Anafora|volume=4|pages=318, 321|via=}}</ref>\n\nCatherine Jurca similarly analyzes Tarzan as opposed to tolerating the presence of people of other races and classes in favor of preserving his own culture. The way that Tarzan defends his corner of civilization, his parents\u2019 home, from the \"savages\" who want to destroy it, reflects an early twentieth-century American attitude; as darker-skinned immigrants flooded the country, especially urban areas, white Americans feared that their culture would be destroyed by newcomers who did not understand or care about it, and tried to protect the suburbs in the same way that Tarzan tries to protect his home.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Jurca|first=Catherine|date=1996|title=Tarzan, Lord of the Suburbs|url=|journal=Modern Language Quarterly|volume=57|issue=3|pages=483|doi=10.1215/00267929-57-3-479}}</ref>\n\nThough Burroughs\u2019 admirers have tried to downplay claims of racism, or to explain that it was a common stereotype at the time the book was written, John Newsinger examines the extent to which Burroughs unfavorably described black characters. He wrote that ''Tarzan'' is the story of the \"whiteman\u2019s conquest of African savagery\", where the native Africans are portrayed as brutes whom Tarzan enjoys taunting and killing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Newsinger|first=John|date=October 1, 1986|title=Lord Greystoke and Darkest Africa: the politics of the Tarzan stories|url=|journal=Race and Class|volume=XXVIII|issue=2|pages=61\u201364|doi=10.1177/030639688602800204}}</ref>\n\n=== Civilization ===\nTarzan's jungle upbringing and eventual exposure to Western civilization form another common theme in literary criticism of the novel. Berglund notes that Tarzan's ability to read and write sets him apart from the apes, the African villagers, and the lower-class sailors in the novel, and culminates in Tarzan recognizing himself as a human for the first time; moreover, he sees himself as a man who is superior to others unlike himself. Jeff Berglund argues that this realization exemplifies Burroughs' portrayal of whiteness and literacy as fundamental to civilization through implying that Tarzan's growth into a perfectly civilized person stems from his Western, white heritage and ability to read and write.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Berglund|first=Jeff|title=Write, Right, White, Rite: Literacy, Imperialism, Race, and Cannibalism in Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes|journal=Studies in American Fiction|volume=27|issue=1|pages=58|doi=10.1353/saf.1999.0011|year=1999}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Mikko Tuhkanen claims that the apparently civilized qualities of Tarzan, such as his interest in reading, threaten his survival as a human in the jungle. For Tuhkanen, Tarzan represents the fluidity with which humans should define themselves. He asserts, \"[T]he human and the nonhuman become grotesquely indistinguishable\" in the novel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tukhanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=32|via=}}</ref> Humans mistake apes for other humans,<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=35|via=}}</ref> an ape tries to rape Jane,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=37|via=}}</ref> Tarzan finds a surrogate ape mother when he cries out like an ape,<ref name=\":5\" /> and he must act against his human instincts by jumping into a dangerous body of water in order to survive an attack from a lion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=38|via=}}</ref> Because simian and human behavior blend, and because civilized habits seem to threaten human survival, Tuhkanen claims that humans must contradict the expectations of civilization regarding the characteristics of humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=43|via=}}</ref>  For Tuhkanen, the novel exemplifies \u201cqueer ethics,\u201d encouraging \u201cperverse sexuality\u201d along with other behaviors which Western civilization often discouraged.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=48, 33|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nJ. Michelle Coughlan argues that Tarzan displays behavior which seems outside of the bounds of traditional manhood in her article \"Absolutely Punk: Queer Economies of Desire in ''Tarzan of the Apes''.\" Coughlan analyzes Burroughs' fans complaints regarding the 'punk ending\" in order to prove that contemporary readers understood Tarzan's renunciation of Jane as unmanly.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Must Read: Rediscovering American Bestsellers: From Charlotte Temple to The DaVinci Code|last=Coughlan|first=J.

The first two were the silent films ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (1918 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' (1918) and ''[[The Romance of Tarzan]]'' (1918), both starring [[Elmo Lincoln]] as Tarzan, based on the first and second parts of the novel, respectively. The next and most famous adaptation was ''[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan the Ape Man]]'' (1932), starring [[Johnny Weissmuller]], who went on to star in 11 other Tarzan films. Lincoln was replaced by Weissmuller (as actor); similarly Clayton was replaced by [[Harry Holt (Tarzan)|Harry Holt]] (the character in the films). It was remade twice, as ''[[Tarzan, the Ape Man (1959)|Tarzan, the Ape Man]]'' (1959), featuring Denny Miller, and ''[[Tarzan, the Ape Man (1981 film)|Tarzan, the Ape Man]]'' (1981), with [[Miles O'Keeffe]] as Tarzan and [[Bo Derek]] as Jane.\n\nThe 1935 12-part serial, ''[[The New Adventures of Tarzan]]'', starred Herman Brix (later, \"[[Bruce Bennett]]\"). This was produced contemporaneously with the Weissmuller versions.\n\nFour more movie adaptations have been made to date: ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]'' (1984), a film starring [[Christopher Lambert]] that is more faithful to the book; ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (1999 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' (1999), a direct-to-video animated film; ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' (1999), a Disney animated film with [[Tony Goldwyn]] as the voice of Tarzan; and ''[[The Legend of Tarzan (film)|The Legend of Tarzan]]'' (2016), a more historically contextualized update starring [[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]] and [[Margot Robbie]], as well as [[Christoph Waltz]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]], portraying actual figures in the Congo at that time, the brutal Belgian Captain [[L\u00e9on Rom]] and American Civil War soldier [[George Washington Williams]], respectively.\n\nA number of Burroughs' other Tarzan novels have also been adapted for the screen.  Numerous Tarzan films have been made with no connection to his writings other than the character.\n\n===Comic adaptations===\nThe book has been adapted into [[Tarzan (comics)|comic]] form on a number of occasions, both in the original Tarzan [[comic strip]] and [[comic book]]s. The strip itself began with [[Hal Foster]]'s adaptation of the story. Notable adaptations into comic book form include those of [[Gold Key Comics]] in ''Tarzan'' no. 155 (script by [[Gaylord DuBois]], art by [[Russ Manning]]), dated September 1966 (reprinted in no. 178, dated October 1969), [[DC Comics]] in ''Tarzan'' nos. 207-210, dated April\u2013July 1972, and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] in ''Tarzan Super Special'' no. 1 (reprinted in ''Tarzan of the Apes'' nos. 1-2, dated July\u2013August 1984). Probably the most prestigious comic version, however, was illustrator and former ''Tarzan'' comic strip artist [[Burne Hogarth]]'s 1972 adaptation of the first half of the book into his showcase graphic novel ''Tarzan of the Apes''. (Hogarth subsequently followed up with another graphic novel ''Jungle Tales of Tarzan'' (1976), which adapted four stories from Burroughs' [[Jungle Tales of Tarzan|identically titled collection]] of Tarzan stories). [[Dynamite Entertainment]] adapted the story for the first six issues of ''Lord of the Jungle'', albeit loosely; for example, the cannibal tribe was replaced by a village of literal apemen.\n\n===Radio adaptations===\n''See main article, ''[[Tarzan (radio program)]]''.''\n\nThree [[old-time radio]] series were based on the Tarzan character. Burroughs himself revised each script in the 1932-1934 series as needed for accuracy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stebbins|first1=Barton A.|title=\"Tarzan\": A Modern Radio Success Story|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/33-OCR/1933-01-15-BC-OCR-Page-0007.pdf|accessdate=9 September 2016|work=Broadcasting|date=January 15, 1933|page=7}}</ref> That series had Burroughs' daughter, Joan, in the role of Jane.<ref name=\"bc121532\">{{cite news|title=\"Tarzan\" Series Tests Produce 93,000 Letters In First Eight Weeks|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/32-OCR/1932-12-15-BC-OCR-Page-0013.pdf|accessdate=9 September 2016|work=Broadcasting|date=December 15, 1932|page=13}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource}}\n*{{cite book | last=Bleiler | first=Everett | authorlink=Everett F.

Scholars have noted several important themes in the novel: the impact of heredity on behavior; racial superiority; civilization, especially as Tarzan struggles with his identity as a human; sexuality; and escapism.\n\n==Plot summary==\nJohn and Alice (Rutherford) Clayton, Viscount and Lady Greystoke from [[England]], are marooned in the western coastal [[jungle]]s of equatorial [[Africa]] in 1888.  Some time later, their son John Clayton II <ref>Tarzan of the Apes, Chapter XXV, where the following line (a diary entry by John Clayton, Tarzan's father) appears: \"Somehow, even against all reason, I seem to see him a grown man, taking his father's place in the world\u2014the second John Clayton\u2014and bringing added honors to the house of Greystoke.\"</ref> is born. When he is one year old his mother dies, and soon thereafter his father is killed by the savage king ape [[Kerchak]]. The infant is then adopted by the she-ape [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]].\n\nClayton is named \"Tarzan\" (\"White Skin\" in the [[Mangani|ape language]]) and raised in ignorance of his human heritage.\n\nAs a boy, feeling alienated from his peers due to their physical differences, he discovers his true parents' cabin, where he first learns of others like himself in their books. Using basic primers with pictures, over many years he teaches himself to read English, but having never heard it, cannot speak it.\n\nUpon his return from one visit to the cabin, he is attacked by a huge gorilla which he manages to kill with his father's knife, although he is terribly wounded in the struggle. As he grows up, Tarzan becomes a skilled hunter, exciting the jealousy of Kerchak, the ape leader, who finally attacks him. Tarzan kills Kerchak and takes his place as \"king\" of the apes.\n\nLater, a tribe of black Africans settle in the area, and Tarzan's adopted mother, Kala, is killed by one of its hunters. Avenging himself on the killer, Tarzan begins an antagonistic relationship with the tribe, raiding its village for weapons and practicing cruel pranks on them.  They, in turn, regard him as an evil spirit and attempt to placate him.\n\nA few years later when Tarzan is 21 years of age, a new party is marooned on the coast, including 19 year old [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]], the first white woman Tarzan has ever seen.  Tarzan's cousin, [[William Cecil Clayton]], unwitting usurper of the ape man's ancestral English estate, is also among the party. Tarzan spies on the newcomers, aids them in secret, and saves Jane from the perils of the jungle.\n\nAmong the party was French naval officer Paul D'Arnot. While rescuing D'Arnot from the natives, a rescue ship recovers the castaways. D'Arnot teaches Tarzan to speak French and offers to take Tarzan to the land of white men where he might connect with Jane again. On their journey, D'Arnot teaches him how to behave among white men.  In the ensuing months, Tarzan eventually learns to speak English, as well.\n\nUltimately, Tarzan travels to find Jane in [[Wisconsin]], USA where he rescues her from a fire. Tarzan learns the bitter news that she has become engaged to William Clayton. Meanwhile, clues from his parents' cabin have enabled D'Arnot to prove Tarzan's true identity as John Clayton II, the Earl of Greystoke.  Instead of reclaiming his inheritance from William, Tarzan chooses rather to conceal and renounce his heritage for the sake of Jane's happiness.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUczCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT95|title=Edgar Rice Burroughs: Master of Adventure|last=Lupoff|first=Richard A.|date=2015-08-27|publisher=Orion|isbn=9781473208711|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Characters in order of appearance==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*John Clayton, Earl of Greystoke\n*Alice Clayton (Rutherford), Countess of Greystoke\n*Captain Billings\n*Black Michael\n*Kerchak\n*Kala\n*Tarzan (a. k. a.

Literary scholars, such as Jeff Berglund, Mikko Tuhkanen, J. Michelle Coughlan, Bijana Oklop\u010di\u0107, and Catherine Jurca have examined the overlapping themes of Tarzan's heredity, race, civilized behavior, sexuality, and escapist appeal. Writers in popular culture, such as Gore Vidal, often emphasize Tarzan's escapist appeal.\n\n=== Heredity ===\nBurroughs himself acknowledged the centrality of the theme of heredity in the novel, and its conflict with the environment. According to his biographer, John Taliaferro, he claimed in a ''[[Writer's Digest|Writer\u2019s Digest]],'' \"I was mainly interested in playing with the idea of a contest between heredity and environment. For this purpose I selected an infant child of a race strongly marked by hereditary characteristics of the finer and nobler sort, and at an age at which he could not have been influenced by association with creatures of his own kind I threw him into an environment as diametrically opposite that to which he had been born as I might well conceive\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/tarzanforeverlif00tali/page/14|title=Tarzan Forever: The Life of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Creator of Tarzan|last1=Taliaferro|first1=John|date=1999|publisher=Scribner|isbn=0-684-83359-X|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/tarzanforeverlif00tali/page/14 14]}}</ref>\n\nThe scholar Jeff Burglund notices that although Tarzan was brought up in the jungle far from other humans, he is inexplicably drawn back to his parents\u2019 cabin and the objects which he finds there.<ref name=\":0\" />  He discovers a capacity for gentlemanly behavior around Jane despite no one teaching it to him.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Berglund|first1=Jeff|date=1999|title=Write, Right, White, Rite: Literacy, Imperialism, Race, and Cannibalism in Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan of the Apes|journal=Studies in American Literature|volume=27|issue=1|page=63|doi=10.1353/saf.1999.0011}}</ref>  Although the African tribes which he fights practice cannibalism, he suddenly feels revulsion when he considers eating one of the African men he kills.

She claims that Tarzan represents white, male opposition to the \"black rapist\" stereotype which was prevalent in the Southern U.S. at the time of its publication because the language which describes apes parallels propaganda against people of African descent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oklop\u010di\u0107|first=Biljana|date=|title=Adapting the Adapted: Adapting the Adapted: The Black Rapist Myth in E.R.

The way that Tarzan defends his corner of civilization, his parents\u2019 home, from the \"savages\" who want to destroy it, reflects an early twentieth-century American attitude; as darker-skinned immigrants flooded the country, especially urban areas, white Americans feared that their culture would be destroyed by newcomers who did not understand or care about it, and tried to protect the suburbs in the same way that Tarzan tries to protect his home.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Jurca|first=Catherine|date=1996|title=Tarzan, Lord of the Suburbs|url=|journal=Modern Language Quarterly|volume=57|issue=3|pages=483|doi=10.1215/00267929-57-3-479}}</ref>\n\nThough Burroughs\u2019 admirers have tried to downplay claims of racism, or to explain that it was a common stereotype at the time the book was written, John Newsinger examines the extent to which Burroughs unfavorably described black characters. He wrote that ''Tarzan'' is the story of the \"whiteman\u2019s conquest of African savagery\", where the native Africans are portrayed as brutes whom Tarzan enjoys taunting and killing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Newsinger|first=John|date=October 1, 1986|title=Lord Greystoke and Darkest Africa: the politics of the Tarzan stories|url=|journal=Race and Class|volume=XXVIII|issue=2|pages=61\u201364|doi=10.1177/030639688602800204}}</ref>\n\n=== Civilization ===\nTarzan's jungle upbringing and eventual exposure to Western civilization form another common theme in literary criticism of the novel. Berglund notes that Tarzan's ability to read and write sets him apart from the apes, the African villagers, and the lower-class sailors in the novel, and culminates in Tarzan recognizing himself as a human for the first time; moreover, he sees himself as a man who is superior to others unlike himself. Jeff Berglund argues that this realization exemplifies Burroughs' portrayal of whiteness and literacy as fundamental to civilization through implying that Tarzan's growth into a perfectly civilized person stems from his Western, white heritage and ability to read and write.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Berglund|first=Jeff|title=Write, Right, White, Rite: Literacy, Imperialism, Race, and Cannibalism in Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes|journal=Studies in American Fiction|volume=27|issue=1|pages=58|doi=10.1353/saf.1999.0011|year=1999}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Mikko Tuhkanen claims that the apparently civilized qualities of Tarzan, such as his interest in reading, threaten his survival as a human in the jungle. For Tuhkanen, Tarzan represents the fluidity with which humans should define themselves. He asserts, \"[T]he human and the nonhuman become grotesquely indistinguishable\" in the novel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tukhanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=32|via=}}</ref> Humans mistake apes for other humans,<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=35|via=}}</ref> an ape tries to rape Jane,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=37|via=}}</ref> Tarzan finds a surrogate ape mother when he cries out like an ape,<ref name=\":5\" /> and he must act against his human instincts by jumping into a dangerous body of water in order to survive an attack from a lion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=38|via=}}</ref> Because simian and human behavior blend, and because civilized habits seem to threaten human survival, Tuhkanen claims that humans must contradict the expectations of civilization regarding the characteristics of humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=43|via=}}</ref>  For Tuhkanen, the novel exemplifies \u201cqueer ethics,\u201d encouraging \u201cperverse sexuality\u201d along with other behaviors which Western civilization often discouraged.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=48, 33|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nJ. Michelle Coughlan argues that Tarzan displays behavior which seems outside of the bounds of traditional manhood in her article \"Absolutely Punk: Queer Economies of Desire in ''Tarzan of the Apes''.\" Coughlan analyzes Burroughs' fans complaints regarding the 'punk ending\" in order to prove that contemporary readers understood Tarzan's renunciation of Jane as unmanly.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Must Read: Rediscovering American Bestsellers: From Charlotte Temple to The DaVinci Code|last=Coughlan|first=J.

The first two were the silent films ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (1918 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' (1918) and ''[[The Romance of Tarzan]]'' (1918), both starring [[Elmo Lincoln]] as Tarzan, based on the first and second parts of the novel, respectively. The next and most famous adaptation was ''[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan the Ape Man]]'' (1932), starring [[Johnny Weissmuller]], who went on to star in 11 other Tarzan films. Lincoln was replaced by Weissmuller (as actor); similarly Clayton was replaced by [[Harry Holt (Tarzan)|Harry Holt]] (the character in the films). It was remade twice, as ''[[Tarzan, the Ape Man (1959)|Tarzan, the Ape Man]]'' (1959), featuring Denny Miller, and ''[[Tarzan, the Ape Man (1981 film)|Tarzan, the Ape Man]]'' (1981), with [[Miles O'Keeffe]] as Tarzan and [[Bo Derek]] as Jane.\n\nThe 1935 12-part serial, ''[[The New Adventures of Tarzan]]'', starred Herman Brix (later, \"[[Bruce Bennett]]\"). This was produced contemporaneously with the Weissmuller versions.\n\nFour more movie adaptations have been made to date: ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]'' (1984), a film starring [[Christopher Lambert]] that is more faithful to the book; ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (1999 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' (1999), a direct-to-video animated film; ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' (1999), a Disney animated film with [[Tony Goldwyn]] as the voice of Tarzan; and ''[[The Legend of Tarzan (film)|The Legend of Tarzan]]'' (2016), a more historically contextualized update starring [[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]] and [[Margot Robbie]], as well as [[Christoph Waltz]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]], portraying actual figures in the Congo at that time, the brutal Belgian Captain [[L\u00e9on Rom]] and American Civil War soldier [[George Washington Williams]], respectively.\n\nA number of Burroughs' other Tarzan novels have also been adapted for the screen.  Numerous Tarzan films have been made with no connection to his writings other than the character.\n\n===Comic adaptations===\nThe book has been adapted into [[Tarzan (comics)|comic]] form on a number of occasions, both in the original Tarzan [[comic strip]] and [[comic book]]s. The strip itself began with [[Hal Foster]]'s adaptation of the story. Notable adaptations into comic book form include those of [[Gold Key Comics]] in ''Tarzan'' no. 155 (script by [[Gaylord DuBois]], art by [[Russ Manning]]), dated September 1966 (reprinted in no. 178, dated October 1969), [[DC Comics]] in ''Tarzan'' nos. 207-210, dated April\u2013July 1972, and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] in ''Tarzan Super Special'' no. 1 (reprinted in ''Tarzan of the Apes'' nos. 1-2, dated July\u2013August 1984). Probably the most prestigious comic version, however, was illustrator and former ''Tarzan'' comic strip artist [[Burne Hogarth]]'s 1972 adaptation of the first half of the book into his showcase graphic novel ''Tarzan of the Apes''. (Hogarth subsequently followed up with another graphic novel ''Jungle Tales of Tarzan'' (1976), which adapted four stories from Burroughs' [[Jungle Tales of Tarzan|identically titled collection]] of Tarzan stories). [[Dynamite Entertainment]] adapted the story for the first six issues of ''Lord of the Jungle'', albeit loosely; for example, the cannibal tribe was replaced by a village of literal apemen.\n\n===Radio adaptations===\n''See main article, ''[[Tarzan (radio program)]]''.''\n\nThree [[old-time radio]] series were based on the Tarzan character. Burroughs himself revised each script in the 1932-1934 series as needed for accuracy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stebbins|first1=Barton A.|title=\"Tarzan\": A Modern Radio Success Story|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/33-OCR/1933-01-15-BC-OCR-Page-0007.pdf|accessdate=9 September 2016|work=Broadcasting|date=January 15, 1933|page=7}}</ref> That series had Burroughs' daughter, Joan, in the role of Jane.<ref name=\"bc121532\">{{cite news|title=\"Tarzan\" Series Tests Produce 93,000 Letters In First Eight Weeks|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/32-OCR/1932-12-15-BC-OCR-Page-0013.pdf|accessdate=9 September 2016|work=Broadcasting|date=December 15, 1932|page=13}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource}}\n*{{cite book | last=Bleiler | first=Everett | authorlink=Everett F.

Its closest relatives were the [[Mauritius starling]] and the [[hoopoe starling]] from nearby islands; all three appear to be of Southeast Asian origin. The bird was only reported by French sailor [[Julien Tafforet]], who was marooned on the island from 1725 to 1726. Tafforet observed it on the offshore [[islet]] of [[\u00cele Gombrani]]. [[Subfossil]] remains found on the mainland were described in 1879, and were suggested to belong to the bird mentioned by Tafforet. There was much confusion about the bird and its taxonomic relations throughout the 20th century.\n\nThe Rodrigues starling was {{convert|25\u201330|cm|abbr=off|0}} long, and had a stout beak. It was described as having a white body, partially black wings and tail, and a yellow bill and legs. Little is known about its behaviour. Its diet included eggs and dead tortoises, which it processed with its strong bill. Predation by rats introduced to the area was probably responsible for the bird's extinction some time in the 18th century. It first became extinct on mainland Rodrigues, then on \u00cele Gombrani, its last refuge.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - RMNH.AVES.110050 - Fregilupus varius (Boddaert, 1783) - R\u00e9union Starling - specimen - video.webm|thumb|left|alt=Perching hoopoe starling museum specimen|thumbtime=0:02|Turnaround video showing a specimen of the related [[hoopoe starling]], [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center]]]]\nIn 1725, the French sailor [[Julien Tafforet]] was marooned on the [[Mascarene]] island of [[Rodrigues]] for nine months, and his report of his time there was later published as ''Relation d'\u00eele Rodrigue''. In the report, he described encounters with various indigenous species, including a white and black bird which fed on eggs and dead tortoises. He stated that it was confined to the offshore islet of [[\u00cele Gombrani]], which was then called au M\u00e2t. [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat]], a Frenchman who was also marooned on Rodrigues from 1691 to 1693 and had written about several species there (his account was published in 1708), did not have a boat, and therefore could not explore the various islets as Tafforet did.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\">{{cite book\n| last1 = Hume\n| first1 = J.

As the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings seem to be more closely related to each other than to the hoopoe starling, which appears to be closer to Southeast Asian starlings, there may have been two separate colonisations of starlings in the Mascarenes from Asia, with the hoopoe starling being the latest arrival. Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings.

These birds are a little larger than a blackbird [R\u00e9union bulbul (''[[Hypsipetes borbonicus]]'')], and have white plumage, part of the wings and tail black, the beak yellow as well as the feet, and make a wonderful warbling.

He made several comparisons between the faunas of different locations, so the fact that he did not mention a crest on the Rodrigues starling indicates that it was absent. His description of their colouration is similar.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n[[File:Necropsar rodericanus skull.png|thumb|upright|left|Skull and [[temporomandibular joint]]]]\nHume notes that the skull of the Rodrigues starling was about the same size as that of the hoopoe starling, but the skeleton was smaller. Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The [[maxilla]] of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/> Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was [[sexually dimorphic]].<ref name=\"Greenway\"/> Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but this may be due to individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\nG\u00fcnther and Newton noted that the [[skull]] of the Rodrigues starling was shaped somewhat differently and longer than that of the hoopoe starling, being about {{convert|29|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from the [[occipital condyle]]; it was also narrower, being {{convert|21\u201322|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The eyes were set slightly lower, and the upper rims of the [[eye socket]]s were about {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} apart. The [[interorbital septum]] was more delicate, with a larger hole in its centre. The bill was about {{convert|36\u201339|mm|in|abbr=on}} long, less curved and proportionally a little deeper than in the hoopoe starling. It also seems to have had larger [[nostril]]s, with the nostril openings in the bone being {{convert|12\u201313|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The mandible was about {{convert|52\u201360|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4\u20135|mm|in|abbr=on}} deep [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximally]]. The skull had an attachment scar above the [[temporal fossa]]. The [[supraoccipital ridge]] on the skull was quite strongly developed, and a [[biventer]] muscle attachment in the [[Parietal bone|parietal]] region below it was conspicuous. This indicates that the starling had strong neck and jaw muscles.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/>\n\nAccording to G\u00fcnther and Newton, the ulna of the Rodrigues starling was somewhat shorter than that of the hoopoe starling, measuring {{convert|37\u201340|mm|in|abbr=on}}; the humerus measured {{convert|32\u201335|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the keel on its sternum was a bit lower. It had strong [[quill knob]]s on the ulna, indicating that the secondary [[remiges]] were well developed. One coracoid measured {{convert|27.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length, and one [[carpometacarpus]] was {{convert|22.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. The leg and feet had the same proportions. The femur measured around {{convert|33|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the [[tibiotarsus]] {{convert|52\u201359|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the [[tarsometatarsus]] {{convert|36\u201341|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\n[[File:Leguat1891frontispieceFr1708.jpg|upright|thumb|Frontispiece to [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat]]'s 1708 memoir, showing his settlement on Rodrigues, with tortoises and rats at the bottom|alt=Drawing of houses on Rodrigues]]\nLittle is known about the behaviour of the Rodrigues starling, apart from Tafforet's description, from which various inferences can be made. The robustness of its limbs and the strong jaws with the ability to gape indicates that it foraged on the ground. Its diet may have consisted of the various snails and invertebrates of Rodrigues, as well as scavenged items.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Rodrigues had large colonies of seabirds and now-extinct ''[[Cylindraspis]]'' land tortoises, as well as marine turtles, which would have provided a large amount of food for the starling, particularly during the breeding seasons. Tafforet reported that the pigeons and parrots on the offshore southern islets only came to the mainland to drink water, and Leguat noted that the pigeons only bred on the islets due to persecution from rats on the mainland; the starling may have also done this. Originally, the Rodrigues starling may have been widely distributed on Rodrigues, with seasonal visits to the islets. Tafforet's description also indicates that it had a complex song.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n[[File:Rodrigues.jpg|thumb|left|Leguat's map of pristine Rodrigues|alt=Map of Rodrigues, decorated with Solitaires]]\nThe stouter build and more bent shape of the mandible shows that the Rodrigues starling used greater force than the hoopoe starling when searching and perhaps digging for food. It probably also had the ability to remove objects and forcefully open entrances when searching for food; it did this by inserting its wedge-shaped bill and opening its mandibles, as other starlings and crows do. This ability supports Tafforet's claim that the bird fed on eggs and dead tortoises.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/> It could have torn dead, presumably juvenile, turtles and tortoises out of their shells. Tafforet did not see any Rodrigues starlings on the mainland, but he stated that they could easily be reared by feeding them meat, which indicates that he brought young birds from a breeding population on \u00cele Gombrani.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Tafforet was marooned on Rodrigues during the summer and was apparently able to procure juvenile individuals; some other Rodrigues birds are known to breed at this time, so it is likely that the starling did the same.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\nMany other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's ecosystem is heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests completely covered the island, but very little remains today. The Rodrigues starling lived alongside other recently extinct birds, such as the [[Rodrigues solitaire]], the [[Rodrigues parrot]], [[Newton's parakeet]], the [[Rodrigues rail]], the [[Rodrigues owl]], the [[Rodrigues night heron]], and the [[Rodrigues pigeon]]. Extinct reptiles include the [[domed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], the [[saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], and the [[Rodrigues day gecko]].<ref name=\"Lost Land\">{{cite book\n| last1 = Cheke | first1 = A.

This may be the reason why Tafforet only observed the Rodrigues starling on an islet. By Tafforet's visit in 1726, the bird must have either been absent or very rare on mainland Rodrigues. Rats could have arrived in 1601, when a Dutch fleet surveyed Rodrigues. The islets would have been the last refuge for the bird, until the rats colonised them, too. The Rodrigues starling was extinct by the time French scientist [[Alexandre Guy Pingr\u00e9]] visited Rodrigues during the French [[Transit of Venus#1761 and 1769|1761 Transit of Venus expedition]].<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/>\n\nThe large populations of tortoises and marine turtles on Rodrigues resulted in the export of thousands of animals, and cats were introduced to control the rats, but the cats attacked the native birds and tortoises as well. The Rodrigues starling was already extinct on the mainland by this time. Rats are adept at crossing water, and inhabit almost all islets off Rodrigues today. At least five species of ''[[Aplonis]]'' starlings have become extinct in islands of the Pacific Ocean, and rats also contributed to their demise.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 55\u201358\">Hume, J. P.

It was described as having a white body, partially black wings and tail, and a yellow bill and legs. Little is known about its behaviour. Its diet included eggs and dead tortoises, which it processed with its strong bill. Predation by rats introduced to the area was probably responsible for the bird's extinction some time in the 18th century. It first became extinct on mainland Rodrigues, then on \u00cele Gombrani, its last refuge.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - RMNH.AVES.110050 - Fregilupus varius (Boddaert, 1783) - R\u00e9union Starling - specimen - video.webm|thumb|left|alt=Perching hoopoe starling museum specimen|thumbtime=0:02|Turnaround video showing a specimen of the related [[hoopoe starling]], [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center]]]]\nIn 1725, the French sailor [[Julien Tafforet]] was marooned on the [[Mascarene]] island of [[Rodrigues]] for nine months, and his report of his time there was later published as ''Relation d'\u00eele Rodrigue''.

Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings.

Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The [[maxilla]] of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/> Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was [[sexually dimorphic]].<ref name=\"Greenway\"/> Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but this may be due to individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\nG\u00fcnther and Newton noted that the [[skull]] of the Rodrigues starling was shaped somewhat differently and longer than that of the hoopoe starling, being about {{convert|29|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from the [[occipital condyle]]; it was also narrower, being {{convert|21\u201322|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The eyes were set slightly lower, and the upper rims of the [[eye socket]]s were about {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} apart. The [[interorbital septum]] was more delicate, with a larger hole in its centre. The bill was about {{convert|36\u201339|mm|in|abbr=on}} long, less curved and proportionally a little deeper than in the hoopoe starling. It also seems to have had larger [[nostril]]s, with the nostril openings in the bone being {{convert|12\u201313|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The mandible was about {{convert|52\u201360|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4\u20135|mm|in|abbr=on}} deep [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximally]]. The skull had an attachment scar above the [[temporal fossa]]. The [[supraoccipital ridge]] on the skull was quite strongly developed, and a [[biventer]] muscle attachment in the [[Parietal bone|parietal]] region below it was conspicuous. This indicates that the starling had strong neck and jaw muscles.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/>\n\nAccording to G\u00fcnther and Newton, the ulna of the Rodrigues starling was somewhat shorter than that of the hoopoe starling, measuring {{convert|37\u201340|mm|in|abbr=on}}; the humerus measured {{convert|32\u201335|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the keel on its sternum was a bit lower. It had strong [[quill knob]]s on the ulna, indicating that the secondary [[remiges]] were well developed. One coracoid measured {{convert|27.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length, and one [[carpometacarpus]] was {{convert|22.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. The leg and feet had the same proportions. The femur measured around {{convert|33|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the [[tibiotarsus]] {{convert|52\u201359|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the [[tarsometatarsus]] {{convert|36\u201341|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\n[[File:Leguat1891frontispieceFr1708.jpg|upright|thumb|Frontispiece to [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat]]'s 1708 memoir, showing his settlement on Rodrigues, with tortoises and rats at the bottom|alt=Drawing of houses on Rodrigues]]\nLittle is known about the behaviour of the Rodrigues starling, apart from Tafforet's description, from which various inferences can be made. The robustness of its limbs and the strong jaws with the ability to gape indicates that it foraged on the ground. Its diet may have consisted of the various snails and invertebrates of Rodrigues, as well as scavenged items.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Rodrigues had large colonies of seabirds and now-extinct ''[[Cylindraspis]]'' land tortoises, as well as marine turtles, which would have provided a large amount of food for the starling, particularly during the breeding seasons. Tafforet reported that the pigeons and parrots on the offshore southern islets only came to the mainland to drink water, and Leguat noted that the pigeons only bred on the islets due to persecution from rats on the mainland; the starling may have also done this. Originally, the Rodrigues starling may have been widely distributed on Rodrigues, with seasonal visits to the islets. Tafforet's description also indicates that it had a complex song.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n[[File:Rodrigues.jpg|thumb|left|Leguat's map of pristine Rodrigues|alt=Map of Rodrigues, decorated with Solitaires]]\nThe stouter build and more bent shape of the mandible shows that the Rodrigues starling used greater force than the hoopoe starling when searching and perhaps digging for food. It probably also had the ability to remove objects and forcefully open entrances when searching for food; it did this by inserting its wedge-shaped bill and opening its mandibles, as other starlings and crows do. This ability supports Tafforet's claim that the bird fed on eggs and dead tortoises.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/> It could have torn dead, presumably juvenile, turtles and tortoises out of their shells. Tafforet did not see any Rodrigues starlings on the mainland, but he stated that they could easily be reared by feeding them meat, which indicates that he brought young birds from a breeding population on \u00cele Gombrani.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Tafforet was marooned on Rodrigues during the summer and was apparently able to procure juvenile individuals; some other Rodrigues birds are known to breed at this time, so it is likely that the starling did the same.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\nMany other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's ecosystem is heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests completely covered the island, but very little remains today. The Rodrigues starling lived alongside other recently extinct birds, such as the [[Rodrigues solitaire]], the [[Rodrigues parrot]], [[Newton's parakeet]], the [[Rodrigues rail]], the [[Rodrigues owl]], the [[Rodrigues night heron]], and the [[Rodrigues pigeon]]. Extinct reptiles include the [[domed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], the [[saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], and the [[Rodrigues day gecko]].<ref name=\"Lost Land\">{{cite book\n| last1 = Cheke | first1 = A.

This may be the reason why Tafforet only observed the Rodrigues starling on an islet. By Tafforet's visit in 1726, the bird must have either been absent or very rare on mainland Rodrigues. Rats could have arrived in 1601, when a Dutch fleet surveyed Rodrigues. The islets would have been the last refuge for the bird, until the rats colonised them, too. The Rodrigues starling was extinct by the time French scientist [[Alexandre Guy Pingr\u00e9]] visited Rodrigues during the French [[Transit of Venus#1761 and 1769|1761 Transit of Venus expedition]].<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/>\n\nThe large populations of tortoises and marine turtles on Rodrigues resulted in the export of thousands of animals, and cats were introduced to control the rats, but the cats attacked the native birds and tortoises as well. The Rodrigues starling was already extinct on the mainland by this time. Rats are adept at crossing water, and inhabit almost all islets off Rodrigues today.
