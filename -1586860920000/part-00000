On the same block of land, directly to the east, is the all female [[Mother McAuley Liberal Arts High School]], while [[Saint Xavier University]] is just to the south of Mother McAuley, and to the southeast of Brother Rice. Its enrollment is mostly drawn from local [[neighborhoods of Chicago|neighborhoods]] such as [[Beverly, Chicago|Beverly]], [[Mount Greenwood, Chicago|Mt. Greenwood]], [[West Lawn, Chicago|West Lawn]], [[Morgan Park, Chicago|Morgan Park]], and [[Ashburn, Chicago|Ashburn]], as well as local suburban municipalities such as [[Oak Lawn, Illinois|Oak Lawn]], [[Evergreen Park, Illinois|Evergreen Park]], [[Palos Heights, Illinois|Palos Heights]], [[Orland Park, Illinois|Orland Park]], [[Tinley Park, Illinois|Tinley Park]], [[Burbank, Illinois|Burbank]], and [[Alsip, Illinois|Alsip]]. The [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] of [[Ireland]] founded the school in 1956. The school's namesake is the founder of their religious order, [[Beatification|Blessed]] [[Edmund Ignatius Rice]]. It is affiliated with Brother Rice High School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.\n\n==School colors and seal ==\nThe school colors are maroon and orange. The maroon was taken from the maroon and gold colors of [[Iona College (New York)|Iona College]] founded in 1940 by the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers]] and in New Rochelle, New York. The orange is taken from the black and orange colors of [[Leo Catholic High School|Leo High School]] in Chicago, Illinois and also opened by the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] in 1926. The Brother Rice school seal has similar design features to the seal of Iona College from New Rochelle, New York.<ref>[http://www.brrice.org/AboutUs/aboutUs_colorsSeal.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828050531/http://www.brrice.org/AboutUs/aboutUs_colorsSeal.htm |date=August 28, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\nThe school is a college preparatory school.

On the same block of land, directly to the east, is the all female [[Mother McAuley Liberal Arts High School]], while [[Saint Xavier University]] is just to the south of Mother McAuley, and to the southeast of Brother Rice. Its enrollment is mostly drawn from local [[neighborhoods of Chicago|neighborhoods]] such as [[Beverly, Chicago|Beverly]], [[Mount Greenwood, Chicago|Mt. Greenwood]], [[West Lawn, Chicago|West Lawn]], [[Morgan Park, Chicago|Morgan Park]], and [[Ashburn, Chicago|Ashburn]], as well as local suburban municipalities such as [[Oak Lawn, Illinois|Oak Lawn]], [[Evergreen Park, Illinois|Evergreen Park]], [[Palos Heights, Illinois|Palos Heights]], [[Orland Park, Illinois|Orland Park]], [[Tinley Park, Illinois|Tinley Park]], [[Burbank, Illinois|Burbank]], and [[Alsip, Illinois|Alsip]]. The [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] of [[Ireland]] founded the school in 1956. The school's namesake is the founder of their religious order, [[Beatification|Blessed]] [[Edmund Ignatius Rice]]. It is affiliated with Brother Rice High School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.\n\n==School colors and seal ==\nThe school colors are maroon and orange. The maroon was taken from the maroon and gold colors of [[Iona College (New York)|Iona College]] founded in 1940 by the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers]] and in New Rochelle, New York. The orange is taken from the black and orange colors of [[Leo Catholic High School|Leo High School]] in Chicago, Illinois and also opened by the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] in 1926. The Brother Rice school seal has similar design features to the seal of Iona College from New Rochelle, New York.<ref>[http://www.brrice.org/AboutUs/aboutUs_colorsSeal.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828050531/http://www.brrice.org/AboutUs/aboutUs_colorsSeal.htm |date=August 28, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\nThe school is a college preparatory school.
