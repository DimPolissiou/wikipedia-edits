He came from the same province as he, and he was one of the founders of the review called ''[[Archivo Ibero-Americano]]'' (AIA). Ivars replaced him as representative of the Franciscan province of Valencia, and since then he wrote in this review. In 1919 he became vice-director and, finally in 1928, director. He came back to his province for some time, where he did several tasks: Master of Students and Chronicler among others. From 1920 until 1936 he lived in [[Madrid]], and he was devoted to historical research. Many of them were published in the already mentioned review AIA.

After that, a whole spectrum of diseases named NMOSD (NMO spectrum diseases) or anti-AQP4 diseases has been accepted.<ref name=\"Misu\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Misu T, Fujihara K | title = Neuromyelitis optica spectrum and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody\u2010related disseminated encephalomyelitis. | journal = Clinical and Experimental Neuroimmunology | date = February 2019 | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages= 9\u201317 | doi = 10.1111/cen3.12491 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nLater, it was found that some cases of MS were presenting [[myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein|anti-MOG autoantibodies]], mainly overlapping with the [[Marburg multiple sclerosis|Marburg variant]]. Anti-MOG autoantibodies were found to be also present in ADEM, and now a second spectrum of separated diseases is being considered. At this moment, it is named inconsistently across different authors, but it is normally something similar to [[Anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis|anti-MOG demyelinating disease]]s.<ref name=\"Misu\"/>\n\nFinally, a third kind of auto-antibodies is accepted. They are several [[neurofascin|anti-neurofascin]] auto-antibodies which damage the Ranvier nodes of the neurones. These antibodies are more related to the peripheral nervous demyelination, but they were also found in chronic progressive PPMS and [[combined central and peripheral demyelination]] (CCPD, which is considered another atypical MS presentation).<ref name=\"Kira\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kira JI, Yamasaki R, Ogata H | title = Anti-neurofascin autoantibody and demyelination | journal = Neurochemistry International | volume = 130| issue = | pages = 104360| pmid = 30582947 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuint.2018.12.011 | year = 2019 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nBesides all this autoantibodies found, four different patterns of demyelination have been reported in MS, opening the door to consider MS as an [[heterogeneous disease]].<ref name=\"pmid23917093\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Popescu BF, Pirko I, Lucchinetti CF | title = Pathology of multiple sclerosis: where do we stand? | journal = Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.) | volume = 19 | issue = 4 Multiple Sclerosis | pages = 901\u201321 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23917093 | pmc = 3915566 | doi = 10.1212/01.CON.0000433291.23091.65 }}</ref>\n\n===Disease biomarkers===\n[[File:Journal.pone.0057573.g005 cropped.png|thumb|upright|[[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] brain scan produced using a ''Gradient-echo phase sequence'' showing an iron deposit in a white matter lesion (inside green box in the middle of the image; enhanced and marked by red arrow top-left corner)<ref name=\"pmid23516409\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mehta V, Pei W, Yang G, Li S, Swamy E, Boster A, Schmalbrock P, Pitt D | title = Iron is a sensitive biomarker for inflammation in multiple sclerosis lesions | journal = PLOS One | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = e57573 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23516409 | pmc = 3597727 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0057573 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...857573M }}</ref>]]\n\nWhile diagnostic criteria are not expected to change in the near future, work to develop [[biomarker]]s that help with diagnosis and prediction of disease progression is ongoing.<ref name=\"pmid21425270\"/> New diagnostic methods that are being investigated include work with anti-myelin antibodies, and studies with serum and cerebrospinal fluid, but none of them has yielded reliably positive results.<ref name=\"pmid19712003\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris VK, Sadiq SA | title = Disease biomarkers in multiple sclerosis: potential for use in therapeutic decision making | journal = Molecular Diagnosis & Therapy | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 225\u201344 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19712003 | doi = 10.1007/BF03256329 }}</ref>\n\nAt the current time, there are no laboratory investigations that can predict prognosis.

At this moment, it is named inconsistently across different authors, but it is normally something similar to [[Anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis|anti-MOG demyelinating disease]]s.<ref name=\"Misu\"/>\n\nFinally, a third kind of auto-antibodies is accepted. They are several [[neurofascin|anti-neurofascin]] auto-antibodies which damage the Ranvier nodes of the neurones.

The favoured habitat is open plains and woodlands, where they stalk slowly at night in search of invertebrates such as insects. The grey-brown coloration is distinguished by dark streaks, its eyes are large and legs are long. They are capable of flight, but rely on the camouflage of their plumage to evade detection during the day; the bush curlew will adopt a rigid posture when it becomes aware of an observer. Both sexes care for two eggs laid on the bare ground, usually sited near bush in a shaded position or next to a fallen branch.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe bush stone-curlew was first described by the English ornithologist [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]] in 1801 under the [[binomial name]] ''Charadius grallarius''.<ref name=\"Latham1801\" />\nLatham published three names simultaneously; however, the seniority of ''C. grallarius'' follows the publication of the names in [[John Gould]]'s ''[[Birds of Australia (Gould)|Birds of Australia]]'' in 1845.<ref name=\"Gould1845\" /><ref name=\"AFD\" />\n\nUntil a revision determining the priority of names assigned to this species, ornithologists cited the description under the epithet ''magnirostris''. Descriptions of subspecies were published by [[Gregory Mathews]] in 1912, ''Burhinus magnirostris rufescens'' and ''B. magnirostris broomei'' describing specimens collected in western Australia and  ''Burhinus magnirostris ramsayi'' collected in the east at Queensland. These descriptions are recognised as synonymous with ''Burhinus grallarius''.<ref name=\"AFD\" />\n\nA species of the widely distributed [[Burhinidae]] family, also represented in Australia by the beach stone-curlew ''[[Esacus magnirostris]]'', it is terrestrial forager of semi-arid inland environments related to the shorebirds and waders of the [[Charadriiformes]] order.\n\nCommon names for this species are southern, bush and scrub stone-curlew, the bush thick-knee and southern stone plover.<ref name=\"RDB1982\" /> A name used by the Indigenous peoples of Western Australia, '''''wee-lo''''', was reported by [[John Gilbert (naturalist)|John Gilbert]] and published by Gould in 1845. Later authorities included this name as current at the [[North West Cape|Northwest Cape]] and [[Southwest Australia (ecoregion)|Southwest Australia]], the similar ''wee-loo'' at [[Pallinup River]] and ''welojabbin'', also in the southwest, and ''windoo'' at a district in the western interior.<ref name=\"Serventy1951\" />\n\n==Description==\nA species of ''[[Burhinus]]'', a genus of large-eyed and long legged terrestrial foragers known as thick-knees, it is slender in form and a grey and brown colour with distinctive markings. The bird has conspicuous dark streaks over the buff and greyish white feathers of the upperparts and spotted markings on the wings. The plumage at lower side of the bird is also strongly streaked with dark brown over white and buff feathers.<ref name=\"Serventy1951\" />\nThe total length of the species, including a bill around 45 millimetres and tail 180&nbsp;mm, is 550&nbsp;mm; the wingspan approaches 1 metre across.\nBlack flight feathers on the wing reveal a light buff patch when extended, and the plumage has a light area at the shoulder.\nThe head is distinguished by a band of dark feathers over the eye and down the neck, and a buff colour at the forehead and brow over the eye. The iris is bright yellow, bare skin near the eye is black. The long legs of the species are an olive-green colour, the bill is darkish in tone.<ref name=\"RDB1982\" /><ref name=\"Serventy1951\" />\n\nThe sexes are similar, juveniles display a paler plumage that otherwise resembles the adults.<ref name=\"Serventy1951\" />\n\nThis stone-curlew's voice is loud and can be heard at a great distance. The call of \"weeloo\" has an eerie and plaintive tone and is a familiar sound of the night in the Australian bush.<ref name=\"Serventy1951\" />\nThe frequency of calls increases when weather conditions are changing, especially when rain is approaching an area. \nSeveral individuals may join their voices in chorus, greatly intensifying the extraordinary quality of their nocturnal calling.<ref name=\"RDB1982\" />\n  \nThe coloration of the egg shell is generally a stone grey with brownish blotching, although this is variable and often matches the environment to provide camouflage. Size of the egg is also variable, on average it is 53 \u00d7 39 millimetres, yet differences in  nearby nests or between the two eggs of the same brood are recorded.<ref name=\"Serventy1951\" />\n\nNo other Australian bird resembles the bush curlew. Another species of the family, the beach stone-curlew also known as a wee-lo, is distinguished by its plumage and larger bill and is only found at the coast. Confusion with the nightjars is possible, but the species of ''[[Caprimulgus]]'' are smaller and fly in a different manner.<ref name=\"IUCN\" />\n\n==Behaviour==\nLike most [[stone-curlew]]s, it is mainly nocturnal and specialises in hunting small grassland animals: frogs, spiders, insects, molluscs, crustaceans, snakes, lizards and small mammals are all taken, mostly gleaned or probed from soft soil or rotting wood; also a few seeds or tubers, particularly in drought years. Birds usually forage individually or in pairs over a large home range, particularly on moonlit nights.\n\nDuring the day, bush stone-curlews tend to remain inactive, sheltering amongst tall grass or the shade of shrubs and trees, relying on their cryptic plumage to protect them from predators.<ref name=\"RDB1982\" /> When disturbed, they freeze motionless, often in odd-looking postures. For visual predators like raptors and humans this works well, but it serves little purpose with animals that hunt by scent such as foxes, [[dingo]]es or [[goanna]]s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\nApproaching the camouflaged individual does not dissuade it from this behaviour, maintaining the rigid posture even if handled.<ref name=\"Abbott2008\" /> \nIf moving from a disturbance they crouch and walk stealthily into vegetation, only attempting to fly if vigorously pursued.<ref name=\"RDB1982\" />\n[[File:Bush stone curlew camoflauge pose.jpg|thumb|A [[crypsis|cryptic]] motionless individual]]\n\nDespite their ungainly appearance and habit of freezing motionless, they are sure-footed, fast and agile on the ground, and although they seldom fly during daylight hours, they are far from clumsy in the air; flight is rapid and direct on long, broad wings.\n\nThe bush stone-curlew is probably heard more than it is seen. Its call sounds like a wail or a scream in the night. When scared, it screeches \u2013 a sound similar to the screech of a [[Phalangeriformes|possum]].<ref name=\"Goodfellow2005\" /> \nA field report from [[Brookton, Western Australia]] noted that their call was heard in response to the cry of possums shot by hunters.<ref name=\"Hill1903\">{{cite journal |last1=Hill |first1=H.E. |title=Some Notes from Brookton, W.A. |journal=The Emu |date=1903 |volume=3 |url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/9035313 |publisher=Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union}}</ref> When threatened (presumably in the presence of a nest), they may raise their wings wide and high in an impressive threat posture and emit a loud, hoarse hissing noise.\n[[File:Bush Stone-curlew chicks.jpg|thumb|Chicks in cryptic pose]]\n\nThe bush curlew is sometimes recorded in flocks. However, when the breeding season occurs, the number of birds in a locality is the usually just a mating pair.<ref name=\"RDB1982\" /> Like other ground nesting birds, the females only selects a site to lay the eggs and provides no other adornment to the nest; care of the site is performed by both parents. The brooding parent will discreetly move from the site if disturbed in the first few days of incubation, but remains to defend an egg at a later stage of development. The parent will adopt its frozen posture and lay over the eggs in an attempt to hide them. \nAn egg that has been discovered by an intruder may be moved a short distance away.<ref name=\"Serventy1951\" />\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe bush stone-curlew has a broad habitat preference, but is rarely seen at rainforest or arid desert and in urbanised or agricultural regions. The species can be found in open forest, eucalyptus woodland, rainforest edges, grassy plains, arid scrubland and along inland watercourses. They are not a migratory species, although weather conditions may cause them to relocate to another site in a local area.<ref name=\"RDB1982\" /> It is a common species near the cities of [[Brisbane]], [[Cairns]] and [[Townsville]] of Australia northeast, but is not found around urban areas in the south of its range. It can be found throughout Australia apart from the West Australian coast and [[Tasmania]]. It is still abundant in the tropical and sub-tropical north, but has become very rare in the less fertile south where it was once common.\n\nHistorical records of the species occurrence in Southwest Australia indicate it was common, sometimes abundant, but the population greatly declined in this region during the twentieth century. The cause of their extirpation is largely attributed to the introduction of the red fox ''[[Vulpes vulpes]]'', the threat from predation by cats is noted as sometimes absent where the fox had already established itself. The attempts to control another exotic pest, the European rabbit, was also a threatening factor to this species, succumbing to control methods of water poisoning and inadvertent capture in rabbit traps.<ref name=\"Abbott2008\" />\nBush curlew's distribution range included most of the mainland of the Australian continent, although this has become reduced by around 90%, and is also found on offshore and nearby islands. A very small population is recorded breeding at a site in southern New Guinea.<ref name=\"IUCN\" />\nThe curlew was reported to sometimes find protection from foxes by residing near rural properties, receiving the consideration of farmers and defended by their dogs.\nYoung birds have been known to become partially domesticated at rural properties.<ref name=\"Abbott2008\" />\n\nAgricultural activity sometimes favoured the local populations, [[Frederick Whitlock]] noted in 1903 that the weelo gained access to open water and favoured the partial clearing of forest where remnant shrubland remained. However, the dramatic decline in former strongholds that were converted to European farming practices was recorded in the mid-twentieth century.<ref name=\"Abbott2008\" /><ref name=\"RDB1982\" />\n\n==Conservation status==\n[[File:Bush Thick-knee rushck.ogg|thumb|Adult and young, Rush Creek, SE Queensland]]\nBush stone-curlews remain reasonably common in the north of Australia, but have become rare in the less fertile south. Many experts believe that fox predation is a prime factor in their decline, although there are areas where foxes are common yet the bush stone-curlew population remains healthy, so the true causes remain uncertain.  Large-scale [[habitat destruction]] and fragmentation has undoubtedly been important, and may well be the major factor, although there is some evidence which suggests that the species favours agricultural land with patches of remnant native vegetation over intact areas of vegetation.<ref name=\"Gates2005\" />\n\nStarting in 2014, bush-stone curlews have been reintroduced to a protected area in [[Mulligans Flat Woodland Sanctuary|Mulligans Flat Woodland Sanctuary]] in Canberra using a combination of hard and soft release strategies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mulligansflat.org.au/bush-stone-curlew-fact-sheet/|title=Bush Stone-Curlew Fact Sheet \u2013 Mulligans Flat Woodland Sanctuary|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\nThe assessment noted in the [[IUCN Red List|IUCN ''Red List'']] is not threatened, revising an earlier listing of near threatened with extinction. The population is declining and estimated at 10,000 to 15,000 individuals in 2016. Historical declines recorded during colonisation of Australia are thought to have abated in the thirty two years (three generations) prior to the IUCN's 2016 assessment.<ref name=\"IUCN\" />\n\nThe bush stone-curlew is not listed as threatened on the [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]]. It is common in [[Queensland]], and not considered to be regionally threatened there. In [[New South Wales]] it is considered [[Endangered species|endangered]] under the [[Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995]].

The grey-brown coloration is distinguished by dark streaks, its eyes are large and legs are long. They are capable of flight, but rely on the camouflage of their plumage to evade detection during the day; the bush curlew will adopt a rigid posture when it becomes aware of an observer. Both sexes care for two eggs laid on the bare ground, usually sited near bush in a shaded position or next to a fallen branch.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe bush stone-curlew was first described by the English ornithologist [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]] in 1801 under the [[binomial name]] ''Charadius grallarius''.<ref name=\"Latham1801\" />\nLatham published three names simultaneously; however, the seniority of ''C. grallarius'' follows the publication of the names in [[John Gould]]'s ''[[Birds of Australia (Gould)|Birds of Australia]]'' in 1845.<ref name=\"Gould1845\" /><ref name=\"AFD\" />\n\nUntil a revision determining the priority of names assigned to this species, ornithologists cited the description under the epithet ''magnirostris''. Descriptions of subspecies were published by [[Gregory Mathews]] in 1912, ''Burhinus magnirostris rufescens'' and ''B. magnirostris broomei'' describing specimens collected in western Australia and  ''Burhinus magnirostris ramsayi'' collected in the east at Queensland. These descriptions are recognised as synonymous with ''Burhinus grallarius''.<ref name=\"AFD\" />\n\nA species of the widely distributed [[Burhinidae]] family, also represented in Australia by the beach stone-curlew ''[[Esacus magnirostris]]'', it is terrestrial forager of semi-arid inland environments related to the shorebirds and waders of the [[Charadriiformes]] order.\n\nCommon names for this species are southern, bush and scrub stone-curlew, the bush thick-knee and southern stone plover.<ref name=\"RDB1982\" /> A name used by the Indigenous peoples of Western Australia, '''''wee-lo''''', was reported by [[John Gilbert (naturalist)|John Gilbert]] and published by Gould in 1845. Later authorities included this name as current at the [[North West Cape|Northwest Cape]] and [[Southwest Australia (ecoregion)|Southwest Australia]], the similar ''wee-loo'' at [[Pallinup River]] and ''welojabbin'', also in the southwest, and ''windoo'' at a district in the western interior.<ref name=\"Serventy1951\" />\n\n==Description==\nA species of ''[[Burhinus]]'', a genus of large-eyed and long legged terrestrial foragers known as thick-knees, it is slender in form and a grey and brown colour with distinctive markings. The bird has conspicuous dark streaks over the buff and greyish white feathers of the upperparts and spotted markings on the wings. The plumage at lower side of the bird is also strongly streaked with dark brown over white and buff feathers.<ref name=\"Serventy1951\" />\nThe total length of the species, including a bill around 45 millimetres and tail 180&nbsp;mm, is 550&nbsp;mm; the wingspan approaches 1 metre across.\nBlack flight feathers on the wing reveal a light buff patch when extended, and the plumage has a light area at the shoulder.\nThe head is distinguished by a band of dark feathers over the eye and down the neck, and a buff colour at the forehead and brow over the eye. The iris is bright yellow, bare skin near the eye is black. The long legs of the species are an olive-green colour, the bill is darkish in tone.<ref name=\"RDB1982\" /><ref name=\"Serventy1951\" />\n\nThe sexes are similar, juveniles display a paler plumage that otherwise resembles the adults.<ref name=\"Serventy1951\" />\n\nThis stone-curlew's voice is loud and can be heard at a great distance. The call of \"weeloo\" has an eerie and plaintive tone and is a familiar sound of the night in the Australian bush.<ref name=\"Serventy1951\" />\nThe frequency of calls increases when weather conditions are changing, especially when rain is approaching an area. \nSeveral individuals may join their voices in chorus, greatly intensifying the extraordinary quality of their nocturnal calling.<ref name=\"RDB1982\" />\n  \nThe coloration of the egg shell is generally a stone grey with brownish blotching, although this is variable and often matches the environment to provide camouflage. Size of the egg is also variable, on average it is 53 \u00d7 39 millimetres, yet differences in  nearby nests or between the two eggs of the same brood are recorded.<ref name=\"Serventy1951\" />\n\nNo other Australian bird resembles the bush curlew. Another species of the family, the beach stone-curlew also known as a wee-lo, is distinguished by its plumage and larger bill and is only found at the coast. Confusion with the nightjars is possible, but the species of ''[[Caprimulgus]]'' are smaller and fly in a different manner.<ref name=\"IUCN\" />\n\n==Behaviour==\nLike most [[stone-curlew]]s, it is mainly nocturnal and specialises in hunting small grassland animals: frogs, spiders, insects, molluscs, crustaceans, snakes, lizards and small mammals are all taken, mostly gleaned or probed from soft soil or rotting wood; also a few seeds or tubers, particularly in drought years. Birds usually forage individually or in pairs over a large home range, particularly on moonlit nights.\n\nDuring the day, bush stone-curlews tend to remain inactive, sheltering amongst tall grass or the shade of shrubs and trees, relying on their cryptic plumage to protect them from predators.<ref name=\"RDB1982\" /> When disturbed, they freeze motionless, often in odd-looking postures. For visual predators like raptors and humans this works well, but it serves little purpose with animals that hunt by scent such as foxes, [[dingo]]es or [[goanna]]s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\nApproaching the camouflaged individual does not dissuade it from this behaviour, maintaining the rigid posture even if handled.<ref name=\"Abbott2008\" /> \nIf moving from a disturbance they crouch and walk stealthily into vegetation, only attempting to fly if vigorously pursued.<ref name=\"RDB1982\" />\n[[File:Bush stone curlew camoflauge pose.jpg|thumb|A [[crypsis|cryptic]] motionless individual]]\n\nDespite their ungainly appearance and habit of freezing motionless, they are sure-footed, fast and agile on the ground, and although they seldom fly during daylight hours, they are far from clumsy in the air; flight is rapid and direct on long, broad wings.\n\nThe bush stone-curlew is probably heard more than it is seen. Its call sounds like a wail or a scream in the night. When scared, it screeches \u2013 a sound similar to the screech of a [[Phalangeriformes|possum]].<ref name=\"Goodfellow2005\" /> \nA field report from [[Brookton, Western Australia]] noted that their call was heard in response to the cry of possums shot by hunters.<ref name=\"Hill1903\">{{cite journal |last1=Hill |first1=H.E. |title=Some Notes from Brookton, W.A. |journal=The Emu |date=1903 |volume=3 |url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/9035313 |publisher=Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union}}</ref> When threatened (presumably in the presence of a nest), they may raise their wings wide and high in an impressive threat posture and emit a loud, hoarse hissing noise.\n[[File:Bush Stone-curlew chicks.jpg|thumb|Chicks in cryptic pose]]\n\nThe bush curlew is sometimes recorded in flocks. However, when the breeding season occurs, the number of birds in a locality is the usually just a mating pair.<ref name=\"RDB1982\" /> Like other ground nesting birds, the females only selects a site to lay the eggs and provides no other adornment to the nest; care of the site is performed by both parents. The brooding parent will discreetly move from the site if disturbed in the first few days of incubation, but remains to defend an egg at a later stage of development. The parent will adopt its frozen posture and lay over the eggs in an attempt to hide them. \nAn egg that has been discovered by an intruder may be moved a short distance away.<ref name=\"Serventy1951\" />\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe bush stone-curlew has a broad habitat preference, but is rarely seen at rainforest or arid desert and in urbanised or agricultural regions. The species can be found in open forest, eucalyptus woodland, rainforest edges, grassy plains, arid scrubland and along inland watercourses. They are not a migratory species, although weather conditions may cause them to relocate to another site in a local area.<ref name=\"RDB1982\" /> It is a common species near the cities of [[Brisbane]], [[Cairns]] and [[Townsville]] of Australia northeast, but is not found around urban areas in the south of its range. It can be found throughout Australia apart from the West Australian coast and [[Tasmania]]. It is still abundant in the tropical and sub-tropical north, but has become very rare in the less fertile south where it was once common.\n\nHistorical records of the species occurrence in Southwest Australia indicate it was common, sometimes abundant, but the population greatly declined in this region during the twentieth century. The cause of their extirpation is largely attributed to the introduction of the red fox ''[[Vulpes vulpes]]'', the threat from predation by cats is noted as sometimes absent where the fox had already established itself. The attempts to control another exotic pest, the European rabbit, was also a threatening factor to this species, succumbing to control methods of water poisoning and inadvertent capture in rabbit traps.<ref name=\"Abbott2008\" />\nBush curlew's distribution range included most of the mainland of the Australian continent, although this has become reduced by around 90%, and is also found on offshore and nearby islands. A very small population is recorded breeding at a site in southern New Guinea.<ref name=\"IUCN\" />\nThe curlew was reported to sometimes find protection from foxes by residing near rural properties, receiving the consideration of farmers and defended by their dogs.\nYoung birds have been known to become partially domesticated at rural properties.<ref name=\"Abbott2008\" />\n\nAgricultural activity sometimes favoured the local populations, [[Frederick Whitlock]] noted in 1903 that the weelo gained access to open water and favoured the partial clearing of forest where remnant shrubland remained. However, the dramatic decline in former strongholds that were converted to European farming practices was recorded in the mid-twentieth century.<ref name=\"Abbott2008\" /><ref name=\"RDB1982\" />\n\n==Conservation status==\n[[File:Bush Thick-knee rushck.ogg|thumb|Adult and young, Rush Creek, SE Queensland]]\nBush stone-curlews remain reasonably common in the north of Australia, but have become rare in the less fertile south. Many experts believe that fox predation is a prime factor in their decline, although there are areas where foxes are common yet the bush stone-curlew population remains healthy, so the true causes remain uncertain.  Large-scale [[habitat destruction]] and fragmentation has undoubtedly been important, and may well be the major factor, although there is some evidence which suggests that the species favours agricultural land with patches of remnant native vegetation over intact areas of vegetation.<ref name=\"Gates2005\" />\n\nStarting in 2014, bush-stone curlews have been reintroduced to a protected area in [[Mulligans Flat Nature Reserve|Mulligans Flat Woodland Sanctuary]] in Canberra using a combination of hard and soft release strategies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mulligansflat.org.au/bush-stone-curlew-fact-sheet/|title=Bush Stone-Curlew Fact Sheet \u2013 Mulligans Flat Woodland Sanctuary|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\nThe assessment noted in the [[IUCN Red List|IUCN ''Red List'']] is not threatened, revising an earlier listing of near threatened with extinction. The population is declining and estimated at 10,000 to 15,000 individuals in 2016. Historical declines recorded during colonisation of Australia are thought to have abated in the thirty two years (three generations) prior to the IUCN's 2016 assessment.<ref name=\"IUCN\" />\n\nThe bush stone-curlew is not listed as threatened on the [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]]. It is common in [[Queensland]], and not considered to be regionally threatened there. In [[New South Wales]] it is considered [[Endangered species|endangered]] under the [[Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995]]. It is listed as \"vulnerable\" in South Australia on the [[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972]]<ref>Kirkwood J 2005, \"Bush-stone Curlew (Burhinus grallarius)\", Threatened Species Day fact sheet, Department of the Environment and Heritage</ref>, and listed as \"threatened\" on the Victorian [[Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act]] 1988.<ref name=\"DSE2005\" /> Under this Act, an Action Statement for the recovery and future management of this species has been prepared.<ref name=\"DSE\" /> On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, this species is listed as [[endangered]].<ref name=\"DSE200\" />\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=160 style=\"font-size:100%; line-height:130%\">File:Bush Stone-curlew444.jpg|Adult facial markings\nFile:Bush Stone-curlew pair.jpg|Pair\nFile:Bush Thick Knee crouching.jpg|Preening in crouched position\nFile:Burhinus grallarius 4.jpg|[[Crypsis|Blending]] into environment\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Burhinus grallarius}}\n{{Wikispecies|Burhinus grallarius}}\n{{reflist|1|refs=\n<ref name=\"Abbott2008\">{{cite journal |last1=Abbott |first1=I. |author-link=Ian Abbott|title=Historical perspectives of the ecology of some conspicuous vertebrate species in south-west Western Australia |journal=Conservation Science W.

Egan later became an assistant coach under Popovich for the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nDuring his time with the coaching staff of the U.S. Air Force Academy, Popovich attended the [[University of Denver]] and earned his [[master's degree]] in [[physical education]] and sports sciences. In 1979, he was named the head basketball coach of [[Claremont Colleges|Pomona-Pitzer]]'s men's team. Popovich coached Pomona-Pitzer men's basketball from 1979 to 1988, leading the team to its first outright title in 68 years.\n\nDuring his time as head coach at Pomona-Pitzer, Popovich became a disciple and later a close friend of head coach [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] at [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|the University of Kansas]]. Popovich took off the 1985\u201386 season at Pomona-Pitzer to become a volunteer assistant at Kansas, where he could study directly under Brown. Popovich returned to Pomona-Pitzer and resumed his duties as head coach the next season.\n\nFollowing the 1987\u201388 season, Popovich joined Brown as the lead assistant coach for the Spurs. From 1988 to 1992, Popovich was Brown's top assistant, until the entire staff, including [[R. C. Buford]], [[Alvin Gentry]] and [[Ed Manning]], were fired by owner [[Red McCombs]]. Popovich moved to the [[Golden State Warriors]] for a brief stint in 1992, serving as an assistant under future [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Don Nelson]] and bringing with him [[Avery Johnson]], who had been cut by the Spurs.\n\n===San Antonio Spurs (1996\u2013present)===\n[[File:Pop sitting down.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Popovich in 2010]]\n\nIn 1994, Popovich returned to San Antonio as the general manager and Vice President of Basketball Operations after [[Peter Holt]] purchased the team. Popovich's first move was to sign Avery Johnson as the team's starting [[point guard]]. Another one of Popovich's early moves in San Antonio was to trade [[Dennis Rodman]] to the [[Chicago Bulls]] for [[Will Perdue]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/03/sports/pro-basketball-unhappy-rodman-is-dealt-from-spurs-to-the-bulls.html PRO BASKETBALL;Unhappy Rodman Is Dealt From Spurs to the Bulls]. New York Times, October 3, 1995</ref> Rodman was not fond of Popovich, as Rodman said in his first book ''[[Bad As I Wanna Be]]''.<ref>{{Citation| last = Rodman| first = Dennis| year = 1996| title = Bad as I Wanna Be| publisher  = Delacorte Press| page = 85}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Spurs had a 3\u201315 start in the 1996\u201397 season, with [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] sidelined with a preseason back injury, Popovich fired coach [[Bob Hill]] and named himself head coach. Robinson then broke his foot after only six games and was lost for the season. [[Sean Elliott]] was also limited to 39 games due to injury, and [[Chuck Person]] missed the entire season. With a reduced roster that included an aging [[Dominique Wilkins]], the Spurs struggled and won only 17 games for the remainder of the season for an overall record of 20\u201362. The Spurs' disastrous season allowed them the first overall pick in the 1997 NBA draft, which they used to draft [[Tim Duncan]] out of [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's basketball|Wake Forest University]].\n\nThe Spurs blossomed as the 6'11\" Duncan teamed up with the 7'1\" Robinson in a \"Twin Tower\" offense and defense for several years. After recovering to win 56 games in 1997-1998 (Popovich's first full year as coach), the Spurs won their first NBA title in [[1999 NBA Finals|1999]].\n\nIn 2002, Popovich relinquished his position as general manager to [[R. C. Buford]], who had served as the team's head scout. Popovich and Buford were both given their starts in the NBA in 1988 as assistants on Brown's coaching staff with the Spurs.\n\nPopovich has won five championships with the Spurs\u2014[[1999 NBA Finals|1999]], [[2003 NBA Finals|2003]], [[2005 NBA Finals|2005]], [[2007 NBA Finals|2007]] and [[2014 NBA Finals|2014]]. He was named [[NBA Coach of the Year]] in 2003, 2012, and 2014.\n\nOn April 4, 2008, Popovich returned to the U.S. Air Force Academy to receive the academy's award of Distinguished Graduate. Despite his four NBA titles at the time, Popovich said it was the most meaningful award he had ever received.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koaa.com/aaaa_sports_news/x9317948 |title=Gregg Popovich honored at Air Force Academy |publisher=KOAA |date=April 4, 2008 |accessdate= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201192035/http://www.koaa.com/aaaa_sports_news/x9317948 |archivedate=December 1, 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\nOn May 2, 2012, Popovich won his second Coach of the Year Award for the [[2011\u201312 NBA season]].<ref name=\"Coach of the Year\">{{cite web|last=Official Release|title=Spurs' Popovich named Coach of the Year|url=http://www.nba.com/2012/news/05/01/coach-of-the-year/index.html?ls=iref:nbahpt2|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507222028/http://www.nba.com/2012/news/05/01/coach-of-the-year/index.html?ls=iref%3Anbahpt2|archivedate=May 7, 2012|df=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greg Popovich interviewed by David Aldridge Spurs-Magic.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Popovich interview by [[David Aldridge]]]]\nOn November 29, 2012, Popovich sat out starters Tim Duncan, [[Tony Parker]], [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]], and [[Danny Green (basketball)|Danny Green]] for a nationally televised game against the [[Miami Heat]].

Egan later became an assistant coach under Popovich for the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nDuring his time with the coaching staff of the U.S. Air Force Academy, Popovich attended the [[University of Denver]] and earned his [[master's degree]] in [[physical education]] and sports sciences. In 1979, he was named the head basketball coach of [[Claremont Colleges|Pomona-Pitzer]]'s men's team. Popovich coached Pomona-Pitzer men's basketball from 1979 to 1988, leading the team to its first outright title in 68 years.\n\nDuring his time as head coach at Pomona-Pitzer, Popovich became a disciple and later a close friend of head coach [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] at [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|the University of Kansas]]. Popovich took off the 1985\u201386 season at Pomona-Pitzer to become a volunteer assistant at Kansas, where he could study directly under Brown. Popovich returned to Pomona-Pitzer and resumed his duties as head coach the next season.\n\nFollowing the 1987\u201388 season, Popovich joined Brown as the lead assistant coach for the Spurs. From 1988 to 1992, Popovich was Brown's top assistant, until the entire staff, including [[R. C. Buford]], [[Alvin Gentry]] and [[Ed Manning]], were fired by owner [[Red McCombs]]. Popovich moved to the [[Golden State Warriors]] for a brief stint in 1992, serving as an assistant under future [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Don Nelson]] and bringing with him [[Avery Johnson]], who had been cut by the Spurs.\n\n===San Antonio Spurs (1996\u2013present)===\n[[File:Pop sitting down.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Gregg Popovich in 2010]]\n\nIn 1994, Popovich returned to San Antonio as the general manager and Vice President of Basketball Operations after [[Peter Holt]] purchased the team. Popovich's first move was to sign Avery Johnson as the team's starting [[point guard]]. Another one of Popovich's early moves in San Antonio was to trade [[Dennis Rodman]] to the [[Chicago Bulls]] for [[Will Perdue]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/03/sports/pro-basketball-unhappy-rodman-is-dealt-from-spurs-to-the-bulls.html PRO BASKETBALL;Unhappy Rodman Is Dealt From Spurs to the Bulls]. New York Times, October 3, 1995</ref> Rodman was not fond of Popovich, as Rodman said in his first book ''[[Bad As I Wanna Be]]''.<ref>{{Citation| last = Rodman| first = Dennis| year = 1996| title = Bad as I Wanna Be| publisher  = Delacorte Press| page = 85}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Spurs had a 3\u201315 start in the 1996\u201397 season, with [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] sidelined with a preseason back injury, Popovich fired coach [[Bob Hill]] and named himself head coach. Robinson then broke his foot after only six games and was lost for the season. [[Sean Elliott]] was also limited to 39 games due to injury, and [[Chuck Person]] missed the entire season. With a reduced roster that included an aging [[Dominique Wilkins]], the Spurs struggled and won only 17 games for the remainder of the season for an overall record of 20\u201362. The Spurs' disastrous season allowed them the first overall pick in the 1997 NBA draft, which they used to draft [[Tim Duncan]] out of [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's basketball|Wake Forest University]].\n\nThe Spurs blossomed as the 6'11\" Duncan teamed up with the 7'1\" Robinson in a \"Twin Tower\" offense and defense for several years. After recovering to win 56 games in 1997-1998 (Popovich's first full year as coach), the Spurs won their first NBA title in [[1999 NBA Finals|1999]].\n\nIn 2002, Popovich relinquished his position as general manager to [[R. C. Buford]], who had served as the team's head scout. Popovich and Buford were both given their starts in the NBA in 1988 as assistants on Brown's coaching staff with the Spurs.\n\nPopovich has won five championships with the Spurs\u2014[[1999 NBA Finals|1999]], [[2003 NBA Finals|2003]], [[2005 NBA Finals|2005]], [[2007 NBA Finals|2007]] and [[2014 NBA Finals|2014]]. He was named [[NBA Coach of the Year]] in 2003, 2012, and 2014.\n\nOn April 4, 2008, Popovich returned to the U.S. Air Force Academy to receive the academy's award of Distinguished Graduate. Despite his four NBA titles at the time, Popovich said it was the most meaningful award he had ever received.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koaa.com/aaaa_sports_news/x9317948 |title=Gregg Popovich honored at Air Force Academy |publisher=KOAA |date=April 4, 2008 |accessdate= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201192035/http://www.koaa.com/aaaa_sports_news/x9317948 |archivedate=December 1, 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\nOn May 2, 2012, Popovich won his second Coach of the Year Award for the [[2011\u201312 NBA season]].<ref name=\"Coach of the Year\">{{cite web|last=Official Release|title=Spurs' Popovich named Coach of the Year|url=http://www.nba.com/2012/news/05/01/coach-of-the-year/index.html?ls=iref:nbahpt2|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507222028/http://www.nba.com/2012/news/05/01/coach-of-the-year/index.html?ls=iref%3Anbahpt2|archivedate=May 7, 2012|df=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greg Popovich interviewed by David Aldridge Spurs-Magic.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Popovich interview by [[David Aldridge]]]]\nOn November 29, 2012, Popovich sat out starters Tim Duncan, [[Tony Parker]], [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]], and [[Danny Green (basketball)|Danny Green]] for a nationally televised game against the [[Miami Heat]].

The report found that the primary reason for the price increases was that the [[world economy]] had [[economic expansion|expanded]] at its fastest pace in decades, resulting in substantial increases in the demand for oil, while the [[oil production]] grew sluggishly, compounded by production shortfalls in oil-exporting countries.\n\nThe report stated that as a result of the imbalance and low [[price elasticity]], very large price increases occurred as the [[Market (economics)|market]] attempted to balance scarce [[price elasticity of supply|supply]] against growing [[price elasticity of demand|demand]], particularly in the last three years. The report forecast that this imbalance would persist in the future, leading to continued upward pressure on oil prices, and that large or rapid movements in oil prices are likely to occur even in the absence of activity by speculators.

The report forecast that this imbalance would persist in the future, leading to continued upward pressure on oil prices, and that large or rapid movements in oil prices are likely to occur even in the absence of activity by speculators.

On the other hand, lower commodity prices led to an improvement in the trade balance\u2014through lower the cost of raw materials and fuels\u2014across commodity importing economies, particularly Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal and other remote island nations (Kiribati, Maldives, Micronesia (F.S), Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu) which are highly dependent on fuel and agricultural imports.<ref>{{citation |ssrn=2617542 |date= 2015|title= Commodity Price Crash: Risks to Exports and Economic Growth in Asia-Pacific LDCs and LLDCs |publisher=United Nations ESCAP |author1=Saggu, A. |author2=Anukoonwattaka, W. |lastauthoramp=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn early 2015, the US oil price fell below $50 per barrel dragging Brent oil to just below $50 as well.<ref name=\"BBC_below_50\">{{citation|title=US oil price falls below $50 on supply glut fears|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30687669}}</ref>\n\nIn mid-January 2015, Goldman Sachs predicted the U.S. oil benchmark to average $40.50 a barrel and Brent to average $42 a barrel in the second quarter.

It was written and produced by [[Stock Aitken Waterman]]. The song was released as the first single from Astley's debut album, ''[[Whenever You Need Somebody]]'' (1987). The song was a worldwide number-one hit, initially in the singer's native United Kingdom in 1987, where it stayed [[List of UK Singles Chart number ones|at the top of the chart]] for five weeks and was the best-selling single of that year. It eventually topped the charts in 25 countries, including the United States and West Germany.<ref name=\"MikeStock\">{{cite web|title= Biography |publisher= Mike Stock Music |accessdate= 14 November 2011 |url= http://www.mikestockmusic.com/index.php?page=Biography02&section=sectionBiography |archivedate= 3 October 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111003132814/http://www.mikestockmusic.com/index.php?page=Biography02&section=sectionBiography |url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\nThe song won Best British Single at the 1988 [[Brit Awards]].

His works span the transition from the [[Classical period (music)|classical]] period to the [[Romantic music|romantic]] era in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period in which he forged his craft, is typically seen to last until 1802. His \"middle\" period, (sometimes characterised as \"heroic\") showing an individual development from the \"classical\" styles of [[Franz Joseph Haydn|Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], covers the years 1802 to 1812, during which he increasingly suffered from deafness. In the \"late\" period from 1812 to his death in 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.\n\nBeethoven was born in [[Bonn]]. His musical talent was obvious at an early age, and he was initially harshly and intensively taught by his father [[Johann van Beethoven]]. He was later taught by the composer and conductor [[Christian Gottlob Neefe]], under whose tuition he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of [[Helene von Breuning]], whose children he loved, befriended and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to [[Vienna]], which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and he was soon courted by [[Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky]] for compositions, which resulted in his three [[Piano Trios, Op. 1 (Beethoven)|Opus 1]] [[piano trio]]s (the earliest works to which he accorded an [[opus number]]) in 1795.\n\nHis first major orchestral work, the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First Symphony]], appeared in 1800, and his [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|first set of string quartets]] was published in 1801. During this period, his hearing began to deteriorate, but he continued to conduct, premiering his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth]] [[symphony|Symphonies]] in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] appeared in 1806. His [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|last piano concerto]] (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the 'Emperor'), dedicated to his frequent patron [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria]], was premiered in 1810, but not with Beethoven as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. He described his problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life in two letters, his \"[[Heiligenstadt Testament]]\" (1802) to his brothers and his unsent love letter to an unknown \"[[Immortal Beloved]]\" (1812).\n\nIn the years from 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works including his later symphonies and his mature [[chamber music]] and [[piano sonata]]s. His only opera, ''[[Fidelio]]'', which had been first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. He composed his ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' in the years 1819\u20131823, and his final, [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]], Symphony, one of the first examples of a [[choral symphony]], in 1822\u20131824.

In addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works, Kaspar also began selling some of his earlier unpublished compositions, and encouraged him (against Beethoven's preference) to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations.

In 1807 the musician and publisher [[Muzio Clementi]] secured the rights for publishing his works in England, and Haydn's former patron [[Nikolaus II, Prince Esterh\u00e1zy|Prince Esterh\u00e1zy]] commissioned a mass (the [[Mass in C major (Beethoven)|Mass in C]], Op. 86) for his wife's name-day. But he could not count on such recognition alone. A colossal benefit concert which he organized in December 1808, and was widely advertised, included the premieres of the Fifth and [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth (''Pastoral'')]] symphonies, the [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]], extracts from the Mass in C, the [[aria|scena and aria]] ''[[Ah! perfido]]'' Op. 65 and the [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy op. 80]]. There was a large audience, (including Czerny and the young [[Ignaz Moscheles]]). But it was under-rehearsed, involved many stops and starts, and during the Fantasia Beethoven was noted shouting at the musicians \"badly played, wrong, again!\" The financial outcome is unknown.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=445-448}}\n\n[[File:Rudolf-habsburg-olmuetz.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven's patron, [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria (1788\u20131831)|Archduke Rudolf]]; portrait by [[Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder|Johann Baptist von Lampi]]]]In the autumn of 1808, after having been rejected for a position at the Royal Theatre, Beethoven had received an offer from Napoleon's brother [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], then king of [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]], for a well-paid position as [[Kapellmeister]] at the court in [[Kassel|Cassel]].

Other works of this period in a similar vein were the F minor [[String Quartet No. 11 (Beethoven)|String Quartet Op. 95]], to which Beethoven gave the subtitle ''Quartetto serioso'', and the Op. 97 [[Piano Trio, Op. 97 (Beethoven)|Piano Trio in B flat major]] known, from its dedication to his patron Rudolph as the ''Archduke Trio''.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 7}}\n\nIn the spring of 1811 Beethoven became seriously ill, suffering headaches and high fever.

The other was  the invitation by the publisher [[Antonio Diabelli]] to fifty Viennese composers , including Beethoven, [[Franz Schubert]], Czerny and the 8-year old [[Franz Liszt]], to compose a variation each on a theme which he provided. Beethoven was spurred to outdo the competition and by mid-1819 had already completed 20 variations of what were to become the 33 ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'' op. 120. Neither of these works were to be completed however for a few years.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 8}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=45}} A significant tribute of 1819, however, was Archduke Rudolf's set of forty piano variations on a theme written for him by Beethoven (WoO 200), and dedicated to the master.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=741, 745}} Beethoven's portrait by Ferdinand Schimon of this year, which was one of the most familiar images of him for the next century, was described by Schindler as, despite its artistic weaknesses, \"in the rendering of that particular look, the majestic forehead [...] the firmly shut mouth and the chin shaped like a shell, [...] truer to nature than any other picture.\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=742}}\n\nBeethoven's status was confirmed by the series of ''Concerts sprituels'' given in Vienna by the choirmaster Franz Xaver Gebauer in the 1819/1820 and 1820/1821 seasons, during which all eight of his symphonies to date, plus the oratorio ''Christus'' and the Mass in C, were performed.

Despite this he continued work on the remaining piano sonatas he had promised to Schlesinger (the [[Piano Sonata No. 32 (Beethoven)|Sonata in A flat major Op. 110]] was published in December), and on the Mass.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 776-777, 781-782}} In early 1822 Beethoven sought a reconciliation with his brother Johann, whose marriage in 1812 had met with his disapproval, and Johann now became a regular visitor (as witnessed by the conversation books of the period) and began to assist him in his business affairs, including him lending him money against ownership of some of his compositions. He also sought some reconciliation with the mother of his nephew, including supporting her income, although this did not meet with the approval of the contrary Karl.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp= 362 -363}} Two commissions at the end of 1822 improved Beethoven's financial prospects. In November the [[Philharmonic Society]] of London offered a commission for a symphony, which he accepted with delight, as an appropriate home for the Ninth Symphony on which was working.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 833-834}} Also in November Prince [[Nikolai Borisovich Galitzin|Nikolai Galitzin]] of [[Saint Petersburg]] offered to pay Beethoven's asking price for three string quartets.

One of the few who took up this offer was [[Louis XVIII]] of France, who also sent Beethoven a heavy gold medallion.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=812-829}} The Symphony and the variations took up most of the rest of Beethoven's working year. Diabelli hoped to publish both works, but the potential prize of the Mass excited may other publishers to lobby Beethoven for it, including Schlesinger and [[Carl Friedrich Peters]]. (In the end it was obtained by [[Schott Music|Schotts]]).{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=186}}\n\nBeethoven had become critical of the Viennese reception of his works. He told the visiting [[Johann Friedrich Rochlitz]] in 1822:<blockquote>You will hear nothing of me here [...] ''Fidelio''? They cannot give it, nor do they want to listen to it. The symphonies? They have no time for them. My concertos? Everyone grinds out only the stuff he himself has made. The solo pieces? They went out of fashion long ago, and here fashion is everything. At the most, [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh|Schuppanzigh]] occasionally digs up a quartet.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=801}}</blockquote> He therefore enquired about premiering the ''Missa'' and the Ninth Symphony in Berlin. When his Viennese admirers learnt of this, they pleaded with him to arrange local performances. Beethoven was won over, and the symphony was first performed, along with sections of the ''Missa Solemnis'', on 7 May 1824, to great acclaim at the [[K\u00e4rntnertortheater]].{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 9}}{{refn|The first full performance of the ''Missa Solemnis'' had already been given in St. Petersburg by Golitsin, who had been a subscriber for the manuscript 'preview' that Beethoven had arranged.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}}|group=n}} Beethoven stood by the conductor [[Michael Umlauf]] during the concert beating time (although Umlauf had warned the singers and orchestra to ignore him), and because of his deafness was not even aware of the applause which followed until he was turned to witness it.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=351}} The ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' gushed, \"inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world\", and Carl Czerny wrote that the Symphony \"breathes such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit&nbsp;... so much power, innovation, and beauty as ever [came] from the head of this original man, although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads.\" The concert did not make much money for Beethoven, as the expenses of mounting it were very high.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=317}} A second concert on 24 May, in which the producer guaranteed him a minimum fee, was poorly attended; nephew Karl noted that \"many people [had] already gone into the country\". It was Beethoven's last public concert.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 318}}\n\nBeethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for Galitzin, despite failing health. The first of these, the [[String Quartet No. 12 (Beethoven)|quartet in E\u266d major, Op. 127]] was premiered by the [[Schuppanzigh Quartet]] in March 1825. While writing the next,  the [[String Quartet No. 15 (Beethoven)|quartet in A minor, Op. 132]], in April 1825, he was struck by a sudden illness. Recuperating in [[Baden]], he included in the quartet its slow movement to which he gave the title \"Holy song of thanks ('Heiliger Dankgesang') to the Divinity, from a convalescent, in the [[Lydian mode]].\" {{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} The next quartet to be completed was the [[String Quartet No. 13 (Beethoven)|Thirteenth, op. 130]], in B\u266d major. In six movements, the last, contrapuntal movement proved to be very difficult for both the performers and the audience at its premiere in March 1826 (again by the Schuppanzigh Quartet). Beethoven was persuaded by the publisher [[Artaria]], for an additional fee, to write a new finale, and to issue the last movement as a separate work (the [[Grosse Fugue]], Op. 133).{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 974-975}} Beethoven's favourite was the last of this series, the [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|quartet in C{{music|#}} minor Op. 131]], which he rated as his most perfect single work.{{sfn|Morris|2010|p=213}}\n\nBeethoven's relations with his nephew Karl had continued to be stormy; Beethoven's letters to him were demanding and reproachful. In August, Karl, who had been seeing his mother again against Beethoven's wishes, attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. He survived and after discharge from hospital went to recuperate in the village of [[Gneixendorf]] with Beethoven and his other uncle Johann. Whilst in Gneixendorf Beethoven completed a further quartet,  ([[String Quartet No. 16 (Beethoven)|Op. 135 in F major]]) which he sent to Schlesinger. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement Beethoven wrote in the manuscript \"Muss es sein?\" (\"Must it be?\");  the response, over the faster main theme of the movement, is \"Es muss sein!\" (\"It must be!\"). The whole movement is headed \"Der schwer gefasste Entschluss\" (\"The Difficult Decision\").{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=977}} Following this in November Beethoven completed his last composition, the new finale for the op. 130 quartet.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} Beethoven at this time was already ill and depressed;{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710 }} he began to quarrel with Johann, insisting that Johann made Karl his heir, in preference to Johann's wife.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p= 1014}}\n\n=== Death ===\n{{Main|Death of Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n[[ File:Beethoven on his deathbed.jpg|thumb|right|Beethoven on his deathbed; sketch by [[Josef Danhauser]]]]On his return to Vienna from Gneixendorf in December 1826, illness struck Beethoven again. He was attended until his death by Dr. Andreas Wawruch, who throughout December noticed symptoms including [[jaundice]] and [[dropsy]], with swollen limbs and  breathing difficulties. Operations were carried out to tap off the excess fluid from his abdomen.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}}{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=1017-1024}}\n\nKarl stayed by Beethoven's bedside during December, but left at the beginning of January to join  the army at [[Jihlava|Iglau]] and did not see his uncle again, although he wrote to him shortly afterwards \"My dear father [...] I am living in contentment and regret only that I am separated from you.\" Immediately following Karl's departure, Beethoven wrote a will making Karl his sole heir.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=377}} Later in January Beethoven was attended by Dr. Malfatti, whose treatment (recognizing the seriousness of his patient's condition) was largely centred on alcohol. As news spread of the severity of Beethoven's condition, many friends, both old and new, came to visit, including Diabelli, Schuppanzigh, Lichnowsky, Schindler, the composer [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]] and his pupil [[Ferdinand Hiller]]. Many tributes were also sent, including \u00a3100 from the Philharmonic Society in London and a case of wine from Schotts.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=378-379}}{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} During this period he was almost completely bedridden despite occasional brave efforts to rouse himself. On March 24, he said to Schindler and the others present \"Plaudite, amici, comoedia finita est\" (\"Applaud, friends, the comedy is over.\") Later that day, when the wine from Schott arrived, he whispered \"Pity \u2013 too late.\"{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=380-381}}\n\nHe died on 26 March 1827 at the age of 56; only his friend [[Anselm H\u00fcttenbrenner]] and a \"Frau van Beethoven\" (possibly his old enemy Johanna van Beethoven) were present. According to H\u00fcttenbrenner, at about 5 in the afternoon there was a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder: \"Beethoven opened his eyes, lifted his right hand  and looked up for several seconds with his first clenched [...] not another breath, not a heartbeat more.\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=1050-1051}} Many visitors came to the death-bed; locks of the dead man's hair were retained by H\u00fcttenbrenner and Hiller, amongst others.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=381-382}}{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=44}} An [[autopsy]] revealed significant [[liver]] damage, which may have been due to heavy alcohol consumption.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 318, 349}} It also revealed considerable dilation of the auditory and other related nerves.{{sfn|SaccentiSmildeSaris|2011}}{{sfn|SaccentiSmildeSaris|2012}}{{refn|There is dispute about the cause of his death: [[alcoholic cirrhosis]], [[syphilis]], [[infectious hepatitis]], [[lead poisoning]], [[sarcoidosis]] and [[Whipple's disease]] have all been proposed.{{sfn|Mai|2006}} Surviving locks of his hair have been subjected to additional analysis, as have skull fragments removed during the 1863 [[exhumation]].{{sfn|Meredith|2005 |pp=2\u20133}} Some of these analyses have led to controversial assertions that he was accidentally [[poison]]ed by excessive doses of lead-based treatments administered under instruction from his doctor.{{sfn|Eisinger|2008}}{{sfn|Lorenz|2007}}|group=n}}\n\nBeethoven's funeral procession in Vienna on 29 March 1827 was attended by an estimated 10,000 people.{{sfn|Taruskin|2010|p=687}}[[Franz Schubert]] and the violinist [[Joseph Mayseder]] were among the torchbearers. A funeral oration by the poet [[Franz Grillparzer]] was read. He was buried in a dedicated grave in the [[W\u00e4hring]] cemetery, north-west of Vienna, after a requiem mass at the church of the Holy Trinity (Dreifaltigkeitskirche) in Alserstrasse. His remains were [[exhume]]d for study in 1863, and moved in 1888 to Vienna's [[Zentralfriedhof]] where they were reinterred in a grave adjacent to that of Schubert.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 318, 349}}{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=1053-1056}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{further|Beethoven's musical style|Beethoven and C minor|List of compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n\n=== The \"three periods\" ===\nThe historian William Drabkin notes that as early as 1818 a writer had proposed a three-period division of Beethoven's works, and that such a division (albeit often adopting different dates or works to denote changes in period) eventually became a convention adopted by all of Beethoven's biographers, starting with Schindler, [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis|F.-J. F\u00e9tis]] and  [[Wilhelm von Lenz]]. Later writers sought to identify sub-periods within this generally accepted structure. Its drawbacks include that it generally omits a fourth period, that is, the early years in Bonn, whose works are less often considered; and that it ignores the differential development of Beethoven's composing styles over the years for different categories of work. The piano sonatas, for example, were written throughout Beethoven's life in a progression that can be interpreted as continuous development; the symphonies do not all demonstrate linear progress; of all of the types of composition, perhaps the quartets, which seem to group themselves in three periods (Op. 18 in 1801-1802, Opp. 59, 74 and 95 in 1806-1814, and the quartets, today known as 'late', from 1824 onwards) fit this categorization most neatly. Drabkin concludes  that \"now that we have lived with them so long [...] as long as there are programme notes, essays written to accompany recordings, and all-Beethoven recitals, it is hard to imagine us ever giving up the notion of discrete stylistic periods.\" {{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=198-200}}{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 11}}\n\n===Bonn===\nSome forty compositions, including ten very early works written by Beethoven up to 1785, survive from the years that Beethoven lived in Bonn. It has been suggested that Beethoven largely abandoned composition between 1785 and 1790, possibly as a result of negative critical reaction to his first published works. A 1784 review in [[Johann Nikolaus Forkel]]'s influential ''Musikalischer Almanack'' compared Beethoven's efforts to those of rank beginners.{{sfn|Solomon|1972|p=169}} Most of Beethoven's surviving works from this period were written after he turned twenty, between 1790 and 1792.  Scholars generally regard these early efforts as bland and uninspired and have concluded that his first efforts at writing in the classical sonata style (with the exception of his Wind Octet) were poorly conceived. [[Gustav Nottebohm]], for example, wrote of Beethoven's Dressler Variations (WoO 63), \"they show not a trace of contrapuntal independent part-writing. They are figural variations of the simplest kind\".<ref>Nottebohm, Gustav (1873) [https://archive.org/details/beethovensstudi01nottgoog ''Beethovens Studien'']. Leipzig & Winterthur. p. 10</ref> [[T\u00e9odor de Wyzewa]] considered his early \"Kurf\u00fcrsten Sonatas\" written in 1783 (WoO 47) as merely \"correct imitations of Haydn.\".<ref>Wyzewa, T\u00e9odor de (1914) ''Beethoven et Wagner''. Paris. p. 44</ref> Considered as a whole, Beethoven's compositional efforts in Bonn demonstrate the importance of his move to Vienna in terms of the development of his musical style and the sophistication of his grasp of classical form and idiom.\n\n===The first period===\nThe conventional \"first period\" begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known today from [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a [[scherzo]] rather than a [[minuet and trio]]; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 13}}\n\nHe also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|first]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|second]] symphonies, the set of six string quartets [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|Opus 18]], the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so [[Beethoven's piano sonatas|piano sonatas]], including the famous ''[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Path\u00e9tique]]'' sonata, Op. 13.\n\n===The middle period===\nHis middle (heroic) period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3\u20138), the last two piano concertos, the [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] and [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|violin concerto]], five string quartets (Nos. 7\u201311), several piano sonatas (including the ''[[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|Waldstein]]'' and ''[[Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)|Appassionata]]'' sonatas), the ''[[Violin Sonata No. 9 (Beethoven)|Kreutzer]]'' violin sonata and his only [[opera]], ''[[Fidelio]]''.\n\nThe \"middle period\" is sometimes associated with a \"heroic\" manner of composing,<ref name=\"Solomon1990\">{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Maynard|authorlink=Maynard Solomon|title=Beethoven essays|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2ZH3v2_-4F4C|page=124}}|accessdate=4 August 2011|year=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06379-2|page=124}}</ref> but the use of the term \"heroic\" has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship.

He began a renewed study of older music, including works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions. The overture ''[[The Consecration of the House (overture)|The Consecration of the House]]'' (1822) was an early work to attempt to incorporate these influences. A new style emerged, now called his \"late period\". He returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade: the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the late string quartets (see below), and two works for very large forces: the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|String Quartet, Op. 131]] has seven linked movements, and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.{{sfn|GroveOnline}} Other compositions from this period include the ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'', the last five string quartets (including the massive ''[[Gro\u00dfe Fuge]]'') and the last five piano sonatas.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Zentralfriedhof Vienna - Beethoven.JPG|thumb|upright|Beethoven's grave at Vienna [[Zentralfriedhof]]]]The [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] in Bonn was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of his birth. It was the first statue of a composer created in Germany, and the music festival that accompanied the unveiling was the impetus for the very hasty construction of the original [[Beethovenhalle]] in Bonn (it was designed and built within less than a month, on the urging of [[Franz Liszt]]).

His works span the transition from the [[Classical period (music)|classical]] period to the [[Romantic music|romantic]] era in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period in which he forged his craft, is typically seen to last until 1802. His \"middle\" period, (sometimes characterised as \"heroic\") showing an individual development from the \"classical\" styles of [[Franz Joseph Haydn|Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], covers the years 1802 to 1812, during which he increasingly suffered from deafness. In the \"late\" period from 1812 to his death in 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.\n\nBeethoven was born in [[Bonn]]. His musical talent was obvious at an early age, and he was initially harshly and intensively taught by his father [[Johann van Beethoven]]. He was later taught by the composer and conductor [[Christian Gottlob Neefe]], under whose tuition he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of [[Helene von Breuning]], whose children he loved, befriended and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to [[Vienna]], which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and he was soon courted by [[Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky]] for compositions, which resulted in his three [[Piano Trios, Op. 1 (Beethoven)|Opus 1]] [[piano trio]]s (the earliest works to which he accorded an [[opus number]]) in 1795.\n\nHis first major orchestral work, the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First Symphony]], appeared in 1800, and his [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|first set of string quartets]] was published in 1801. During this period, his hearing began to deteriorate, but he continued to conduct, premiering his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth]] [[symphony|Symphonies]] in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] appeared in 1806. His [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|last piano concerto]] (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the 'Emperor'), dedicated to his frequent patron [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria]], was premiered in 1810, but not with Beethoven as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. He described his problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life in two letters, his \"[[Heiligenstadt Testament]]\" (1802) to his brothers and his unsent love letter to an unknown \"[[Immortal Beloved]]\" (1812).\n\nIn the years from 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works including his later symphonies and his mature [[chamber music]] and [[piano sonata]]s. His only opera, ''[[Fidelio]]'', which had been first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. He composed his ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' in the years 1819\u20131823, and his final, [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]], Symphony, one of the first examples of a [[choral symphony]], in 1822\u20131824. Written in his last years, his [[Late string quartets (Beethoven)|late string quartets]] of 1825\u201326 are amongst his final achievements. After some months of bedridden illness he [[Death of Ludwig van Beethoven|died in 1827]]. Beethoven's works remain mainstays of the classical music repertoire.\n\n== Life and career ==\n=== Family and early life ===\n[[File:Beethoven house of birth Bonn 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven's birthplace at Bonngasse&nbsp;20, Bonn, now the [[Beethoven House]] museum]]\nBeethoven was the grandson of [[Ludwig van Beethoven (1712\u20131773)|Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1712\u20131773), a musician from the town of [[Mechelen]] in the Austrian [[Duchy of Brabant]] (in what is now the [[Flemish region]] of Belgium) who had moved to [[Bonn]] at the age of 21.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}}{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=407}} Ludwig was employed as a [[bass (voice type)|bass]] singer at the court of [[Clemens August of Bavaria|Clemens August]], [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop-Elector of Cologne]], eventually rising to become, in 1761, [[Kapellmeister]] (music director) and hence a pre-eminent musician in Bonn. The portrait he commissioned of himself towards the end of his life remained displayed in his grandson's rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=12\u201317}} Ludwig had one son, [[Johann van Beethoven|Johann]] (1740\u20131792), who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and [[violin]] lessons to supplement his income.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}}\n\nJohann married [[Maria Magdalena Keverich]] in 1767; she was the daughter of Heinrich Keverich (1701\u20131751), who had been the head chef at the court of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|Archbishopric of Trier]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=50}} Beethoven was born of this marriage in Bonn at what is now the [[Beethoven House]] Museum, Bonnstrasse 20.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.beethoven.de/en/about-us#history |title=Beethoven-Haus History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Beethoven-Haus Bonn |publisher= |access-date=16 April 2020 |quote=}}</ref> There is no authentic record of the date of his birth; however, the registry of his [[baptism]], in the Catholic Parish of St. Remigius on 17 December 1770, survives, and the custom in the region at the time was to carry out baptism within 24 hours of birth. There is a consensus, (with which Beethoven himself agreed) that his birth date was 16 December, but no documentary proof of this.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=53}}\n\nOf the seven children born to Johann van Beethoven, only Ludwig, the second-born, and two younger brothers survived infancy. [[Kaspar Anton Karl van Beethoven|Kaspar Anton Karl]] was born on 8 April 1774, and [[Nikolaus Johann van Beethoven|Nikolaus Johann]], (generally known as Johann) the youngest, was born on 2 October 1776.{{sfn|Stanley|2000|p=7}}\n\nBeethoven's first music teacher was his father. He later had other local teachers: the court [[organist]] Gilles van den Eeden (d. 1782), Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer (a family friend, who provided keyboard tuition), and Franz Rovantini (a relative, who instructed him in playing the violin and [[viola]]).{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}} From the outset his tuition regime, which began in his fifth year, was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears; with the involvement of the insomniac Pfeiffer there were irregular late-night sessions with the young Beethoven being dragged from his bed to the keyboard.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=22, 32}} His musical talent was obvious at a young age. Johann, aware of [[Leopold Mozart]]'s successes in this area (with his son [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang]] and daughter [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]]), attempted to promote his son as a [[child prodigy]], claiming that Beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for his first public performance in March 1778.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=57\u20138}}\n\n===1780\u20131792: Bonn ===\n[[File:Christian Gottlob Neefe.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|Christian Gottlob Neefe.

In addition, some minor works not listed with opus numbers or in the WoO list have [[Catalogues of Beethoven compositions#Hess catalogue|Hess catalogue]] numbers.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=210}}|group=n}} Beethoven soon began working with Neefe as assistant organist, at first unpaid (1782), and then as a paid employee (1784) of the court chapel.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=65\u201370}} His [[Three Piano Sonatas, WoO 47 (Beethoven)|first three piano sonatas]], WoO 47, sometimes known as \"{{lang|de|[[Kurf\u00fcrst]]}}\" (\"Elector\") for their dedication to the Elector [[Maximilian Friedrich von K\u00f6nigsegg-Rothenfels|Maximilian Friedrich]] (1708\u20131784), were published in 1783.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=69}} In the same year the first printed reference to Beethoven appeared in the ''Magazin der Musik'' \u2013 \"Louis van Beethoven [sic] ... a boy of 11 years and most promising talent.

He gave some support to Beethoven, appointing him Court Organist and paying towards his visit to Vienna of 1792. {{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=50}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=50}}\n\nHe was introduced in these years to several people who became important in his life. He often visited the cultivated von Breuning family, at whose home he taught piano to some of the children, and where the widowed Frau von Breuning offered him a motherly friendship. Here he also met [[Franz Gerhard Wegeler|Franz Wegeler]], a young medical student, who became a lifelong friend (and was to marry one of the von Breuning daughters). The von Breuning family environment offered an alternative to his home life, which was increasingly dominated by his father's decline. Another frequenter of the von Breunings was [[Count Ferdinand Ernst Gabriel von Waldstein|Count Ferdinand von Waldstein]], who became a friend and financial supporter during Beethoven's Bonn period.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 2}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=55}}{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp= 51\u201352}} Waldstein was to commission in 1791 Beethoven's first work for the stage, the ballet ''Musik zu einem Ritterballett'' (WoO 1).{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p= 121\u2013122}}\n\n[[File:Count von Waldstein.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Count Waldstein: portrait by  [[Anton\u00edn Machek]], c. 1800]]In the period 1785\u201390 there is virtually no record of Beethoven's activity as a composer. This may be attributed to the lukewarm response his initial publications had attracted, and also to ongoing problems in the Beethoven family.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=36\u201337}} His mother died in 1787, shortly after Beethoven\u2019s first visit to Vienna, where he stayed for about two weeks and almost certainly met Mozart.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 2}} In 1789 Beethoven's father was forcibly retired from the service of the Court (as a consequence of his alcoholism) and it was ordered that half of his father's pension be paid directly to Ludwig for support of the family.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=95}} He contributed further to the family's income by teaching (to which Wegeler said he had \"an extraordinary aversion\"{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=51}}) and by playing [[viola]] in the court orchestra. This familiarized him with a variety of operas, including works by Mozart, [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] and [[Giovanni Paisiello|Paisiello]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=95\u201398}} Here he also befriended [[Anton Reicha]], a composer, [[flute|flautist]] and violinist of about his own age who was a nephew of the court orchestra's conductor, [[Josef Reicha]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=96}}\n\nFrom 1790 to 1792, Beethoven composed a number of works (none were published at the time) showing a growing range and maturity. [[Musicologist]]s have identified a theme similar to those of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]] in a set of variations written in 1791.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 35\u201341}} It was perhaps on Neefe's recommendation that Beethoven received his first commissions; the Literary Society in Bonn commissioned a cantata to mark the occasion of the death in 1790 of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (WoO 87),  and a further cantata, to celebrate the subsequent accession of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (WoO 88), may have been commissioned by the Elector.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=93\u201394}} These two ''Emperor Cantatas'' were never performed at the time and they remained lost until the 1880s, when they were described by [[Johannes Brahms]] as \"Beethoven through and through\" and as such prophetic of the style which would mark his music as distinct from the classical tradition.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=107\u2013111}}\n\nBeethoven was probably first introduced to [[Joseph Haydn]] in late 1790, when the latter was travelling to London and stopped in Bonn around Christmas time.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 35}} A year and a half later, they met in Bonn on Haydn's return trip from London to Vienna in July 1792, when Beethoven played in the orchestra at the [[Redoute, Bad Godesberg|Redoute in Godesberg]]. It is likely that arrangements were made at that time for Beethoven to study with the older master.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 41}} Waldstein wrote to him before his departure: \u201cYou are going to Vienna in fulfilment of your long-frustrated wishes [\u2026] With the help of assiduous labour you shall receive Mozart\u2019s spirit from Haydn\u2019s hands.\u201d{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 2}}\n\n===1792\u20131802: Vienna \u2013 the early years ===\n[[File:Beethoven Riedel 1801.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Beethoven as a young man, c. 1800, by Carl Traugott Riedel (1769\u20131832)]]Beethoven left Bonn for Vienna in November 1792, amid rumours of [[First Coalition|war spilling out of France]]; he learned shortly after his arrival that his father had died.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 42}}  Over the next few years, Beethoven responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased Mozart by studying that master's work and writing works with a distinctly Mozartian flavour.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 43}}\n\nHe did not immediately set out to establish himself as a composer, but rather devoted himself to study and performance. Working under Haydn's direction,{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 3}} he sought to master [[counterpoint]]. He also studied violin under [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 47, 54}} Early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from [[Antonio Salieri]], primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly as late as 1809.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=149}}\n\nWith Haydn's departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home to Bonn. He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with [[Johann Georg Albrechtsberger|Johann Albrechtsberger]] and other teachers. In any case, by this time it must have seemed clear to his employer that Bonn would fall to the French, as it did in October 1794, effectively leaving Beethoven without a stipend or the necessity to return.{{sfn|Ronge|2013}} However, a number of Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them [[Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz|Prince Joseph Franz Lobkowitz]], [[Karl Alois Johann-Nepomuk Vinzenz, F\u00fcrst Lichnowsky|Prince Karl Lichnowsky]], and Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}}\n\nAssisted by his connections with Haydn and Waldstein, Beethoven began to develop a reputation as a performer and improviser in the salons of the Viennese nobility.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=59}} His friend [[Nikolaus Simrock]] began publishing his compositions, starting with a set of keyboard variations on a theme of [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf|Dittersdorf]] (WoO 66).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 46}} By 1793, he had established a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their eventual appearance would have greater impact.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}}\n\n[[File:\u00d6lenhainz - Franz Joseph Maximilian von Lobkowitz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Prince Lobkowitz: portrait by [[August Friedrich Oelenhainz]]]]His first public performance in Vienna was in March 1795, where he first performed one of his [[piano concerto]]s.{{refn|It is uncertain whether this was the [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] or [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]].

They were published in 1801. He also completed his [[Septet (Beethoven)|Septet]] (Op. 20) in 1799, which was one of his most popular works during his lifetime. With premieres of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]] Symphonies in 1800 and 1803, he became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following Haydn and Mozart. But his melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences, and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 58}}  For the premiere of his First Symphony, he hired the [[Burgtheater]] on 2 April 1800, and staged an extensive programme, including works by Haydn and Mozart, as well as his Septet, the Symphony, and one of his piano concertos (the latter three works all then unpublished). The concert, which the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' described as \"the most interesting concert in a long time,\" was not without difficulties; among the criticisms was that \"the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 90}} By the end of 1800, Beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 97}}\n\n[[File:Josephine Brunsvik.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Josephine Brunsvik, pencil miniature (unknown artist), before 1804.]]In May 1799, he taught piano to the daughters of Hungarian Countess Anna Brunsvik.

The young [[Carl Czerny]], who later became a renowned music teacher himself, studied with Beethoven from 1801 to 1803. In late 1801, he met a young countess, [[Julie Guicciardi]], through the Brunsvik family; he mentions his love for Julie in a November 1801 letter to a friend, but class difference prevented any consideration of pursuing this.

In addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works, Kaspar also began selling some of his earlier unpublished compositions, and encouraged him (against Beethoven's preference) to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations.

The idea of creating a symphony based on the career of [[Napoleon]] may have been suggested to Beethoven by [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Count Bernadotte]] in 1798.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 4}} Beethoven, sympathetic to the ideal of the heroic revolutionary leader, originally gave the symphony the title \"Bonaparte\", but disillusioned by Napoleon [[1804 French constitutional referendum|declaring himself Emperor in 1804]], he scratched Napoleon's name from the manuscript's title page, and the symphony was published in 1806 with its present title and the subtitle \"to celebrate the memory of a great man.\"{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 6}} The ''Eroica'' was longer and larger in scope than any previous symphony.

Some of his early patrons, including Prince Lobkowitz and Prince Lichnowsky, gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 78\u201379}} Perhaps his most important aristocratic patron was [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria ]], the youngest son of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II]], who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with him.  They became friends, and their meetings continued until 1824.{{sfn|Lockwood|2005|pp=300\u201301}} Beethoven was to dedicate 14 compositions to Rudolf, including some of his major works such as the [[Piano Trio No. 7 (Beethoven)|''Archduke'' Trio]] Op. 97 (1811) and ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'' Op. 123 (1823).\n\nHis position at the Theater an der Wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804, and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of Vienna with his friend Stephan von Breuning. This slowed work on ''Leonore'', (his original title for his opera), his largest work to date, for a time. It was delayed again by the Austrian [[censorship|censor]], and finally premiered, under its present tile of ''Fidelio'' in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the [[War of the Third Coalition|French occupation of the city]]. In addition to being a financial failure, this version of ''Fidelio'' was also a critical failure, and Beethoven began revising it.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 150}}\n\nDespite this failure, Beethoven continued to attract recognition. In 1807 the musician and publisher [[Muzio Clementi]] secured the rights for publishing his works in England, and Haydn's former patron [[Nikolaus II, Prince Esterh\u00e1zy|Prince Esterh\u00e1zy]] commissioned a mass (the [[Mass in C major (Beethoven)|Mass in C]], Op. 86) for his wife's name-day. But he could not count on such recognition alone. A colossal benefit concert which he organized in December 1808, and was widely advertised, included the premieres of the Fifth and [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth (''Pastoral'')]] symphonies, the [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]], extracts from the Mass in C, the [[aria|scena and aria]] ''[[Ah! perfido]]'' Op. 65 and the [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy op. 80]]. There was a large audience, (including Czerny and the young [[Ignaz Moscheles]]). But it was under-rehearsed, involved many stops and starts, and during the Fantasia Beethoven was noted shouting at the musicians \"badly played, wrong, again!\" The financial outcome is unknown.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=445-448}}\n\n[[File:Rudolf-habsburg-olmuetz.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven's patron, [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria (1788\u20131831)|Archduke Rudolf]]; portrait by [[Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder|Johann Baptist von Lampi]]]]In the autumn of 1808, after having been rejected for a position at the Royal Theatre, Beethoven had received an offer from Napoleon's brother [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], then king of [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]], for a well-paid position as [[Kapellmeister]] at the court in [[Kassel|Cassel]].

[[Egmont (Beethoven)|The result]] (an overture, and nine additional [[entracte]]s and vocal pieces, Op. 84), which appeared in 1810 fitted well with Beethoven's \"heroic\" style and he became interested in Goethe, setting three of his poems as songs (Op. 83) and learning about the poet from a mutual acquaintance, [[Bettina Brentano]] (who also wrote to Goethe at this time about Beethoven). Other works of this period in a similar vein were the F minor [[String Quartet No. 11 (Beethoven)|String Quartet Op. 95]], to which Beethoven gave the subtitle ''Quartetto serioso'', and the Op. 97 [[Piano Trio, Op. 97 (Beethoven)|Piano Trio in B flat major]] known, from its dedication to his patron Rudolph as the ''Archduke Trio''.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 7}}\n\nIn the spring of 1811 Beethoven became seriously ill, suffering headaches and high fever.

Unsympathetic to the sorts of trends in German romanticism that featured the supernatural (as in operas by [Spohr, [[Heinrich Marschner]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber]], he also \"resisted the impending Romantic fragmentation of the [...] cyclic forms of the Classical era into small forms and lyric mood pieces\" and turned towards study of Bach, [[George Frederic Handel|Handel]] and [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]].{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=295}} An old connection was renewed in 1817 when Maelzel sought, and obtained, Beethoven's endorsement for his newly developed [[metronome]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=684-686}} During these years the few major works completed include Beethoven's only [[song cycle]], ''[[An die ferne Geliebte]]'' Op. 98, (1816), and the gigantic [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|''Hammerklavier'' Sonata]] (Sonata No. 29 in B flat major, Op. 106) (1818).{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 659, 717}} It was also in 1818 that he began musical sketches that eventually form part of his final Ninth Symphony.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=322}}\n\nBy early 1818 Beethoven's health had improved, and his nephew Karl, now aged 11, moved in with him in January, (although within a year Karl's mother had won him back in the courts).{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=41}} By now his hearing had again significantly deteriorated, necessitating Beethoven and his interlocutors writing in notebooks to carry out conversations. These 'conversation books' are a rich written resource for his life from this period onwards. They contain discussions about music, business and personal life; they are also a valuable source for his contacts and for investigations into how he intended his music should be performed, and of his opinions of the art of music.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=164-167}} {{refn|It was suggested by Beethoven's  biographer [[Alexander Wheelock Thayer]] that, of 400 conversation books, 264 were destroyed (and others were altered) after his death by his secretary  Schindler, who wished only an idealised biography to survive.{{sfn|Clive|2001|p=239}} The music historian [[Theodore Albrecht]] has however demonstrated that Thayer's allegations were over the top. \"[It is now] abundantly clear that Schindler never possessed as many as c. 400 conversation books, and that he never destroyed roughly five-eighths of that number.\"{{sfn|Albrecht|2009|p=181}} Schindler did however insert a number of fraudulent entries that bolstered his own profile and his prejudices.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=52}}{{sfn|Nettl|1994|p=103}} Presently 136 books covering the period 1819-1827 are preserved at the [[Staatsbibliothek Berlin]], with another two at the Beethoven-Haus in Bonn.{{sfn|Hammelmann|1965|p=187}}|group=n}} His household management had also improved somewhat; Nanette Streicher, who had assisted in his care during his illness, continued to provide some support, and he finally found a skilled cook.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 260}} A testimonial to the esteem in which Beethoven was held in England was the presentation to him in this year by Thomas Broadwood, the proprietor of the company, of a [[John Broadwood & Sons|Broadwood piano]], for which Beethoven expressed grateful thanks.

The first was the announcement of Archduke Rudolf's promotion to [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]]-[[Archbishop]] as Archbishop of [[Olomouc]] (now in Czechia), which triggered the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' Op. 123, intended to be ready for his installation in Olomouc in March 1820. The other was  the invitation by the publisher [[Antonio Diabelli]] to fifty Viennese composers , including Beethoven, [[Franz Schubert]], Czerny and the 8-year old [[Franz Liszt]], to compose a variation each on a theme which he provided. Beethoven was spurred to outdo the competition and by mid-1819 had already completed 20 variations of what were to become the 33 ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'' op. 120. Neither of these works were to be completed however for a few years.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 8}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=45}} A significant tribute of 1819, however, was Archduke Rudolf's set of forty piano variations on a theme written for him by Beethoven (WoO 200), and dedicated to the master.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=741, 745}} Beethoven's portrait by Ferdinand Schimon of this year, which was one of the most familiar images of him for the next century, was described by Schindler as, despite its artistic weaknesses, \"in the rendering of that particular look, the majestic forehead [...] the firmly shut mouth and the chin shaped like a shell, [...] truer to nature than any other picture.\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=742}}\n\nBeethoven's status was confirmed by the series of ''Concerts sprituels'' given in Vienna by the choirmaster Franz Xaver Gebauer in the 1819/1820 and 1820/1821 seasons, during which all eight of his symphonies to date, plus the oratorio ''Christus'' and the Mass in C, were performed. Beethoven was typically underwhelmed:  when in an April 1820 conversation book a friend mentioned Gebauer,  Beethoven wrote in reply \"Geh!

Despite this he continued work on the remaining piano sonatas he had promised to Schlesinger (the [[Piano Sonata No. 32 (Beethoven)|Sonata in A flat major Op. 110]] was published in December), and on the Mass.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 776-777, 781-782}} In early 1822 Beethoven sought a reconciliation with his brother Johann, whose marriage in 1812 had met with his disapproval, and Johann now became a regular visitor (as witnessed by the conversation books of the period) and began to assist him in his business affairs, including him lending him money against ownership of some of his compositions. He also sought some reconciliation with the mother of his nephew, including supporting her income, although this did not meet with the approval of the contrary Karl.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp= 362 -363}} Two commissions at the end of 1822 improved Beethoven's financial prospects. In November the [[Philharmonic Society]] of London offered a commission for a symphony, which he accepted with delight, as an appropriate home for the Ninth Symphony on which was working.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 833-834}} Also in November Prince [[Nikolai Borisovich Galitzin|Nikolai Galitzin]] of [[Saint Petersburg]] offered to pay Beethoven's asking price for three string quartets. Beethoven set the price at the high level of 50 ducats per quartet in a letter dictated to his nephew Karl, who was then living with him.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=815-816}}\n\n===1823\u20131827: The final years===\n[[File:Beethoven Waldmuller 1823.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Beethoven in 1823 by [[Ferdinand Georg Waldm\u00fcller]]]]The year 1823 saw the completion of three notable works, all of which had occupied Beethoven for some years, namely the ''Missa Solemnis'', the Ninth Symphony and the ''Diabelli Variations''.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p= 879}}\n\nBeethoven at last presented the manuscript of the completed ''Missa'' to Rudolph on 19 March (more than a year after the Archduke's enthronement as Archbishop). He was not however in a hurry to get it published or performed as he had formed a notion that he could profitably sell manuscripts of the work to various courts in Germany and Europe at 50 ducats each. One of the few who took up this offer was [[Louis XVIII]] of France, who also sent Beethoven a heavy gold medallion.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=812-829}} The Symphony and the variations took up most of the rest of Beethoven's working year. Diabelli hoped to publish both works, but the potential prize of the Mass excited may other publishers to lobby Beethoven for it, including Schlesinger and [[Carl Friedrich Peters]]. (In the end it was obtained by [[Schott Music|Schotts]]).{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=186}}\n\nBeethoven had become critical of the Viennese reception of his works. He told the visiting [[Johann Friedrich Rochlitz]] in 1822:<blockquote>You will hear nothing of me here [...] ''Fidelio''? They cannot give it, nor do they want to listen to it. The symphonies? They have no time for them. My concertos? Everyone grinds out only the stuff he himself has made. The solo pieces? They went out of fashion long ago, and here fashion is everything. At the most, [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh|Schuppanzigh]] occasionally digs up a quartet.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=801}}</blockquote> He therefore enquired about premiering the ''Missa'' and the Ninth Symphony in Berlin. When his Viennese admirers learnt of this, they pleaded with him to arrange local performances. Beethoven was won over, and the symphony was first performed, along with sections of the ''Missa Solemnis'', on 7 May 1824, to great acclaim at the [[K\u00e4rntnertortheater]].{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 9}}{{refn|The first full performance of the ''Missa Solemnis'' had aldready been given in St. Petersburg by Golitsin, who had been a subscriber for the manuscript 'preview' that Beethoven had arranged.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}}|group=n}} Beethoven stood by the conductor [[Michael Umlauf]] during the concert beating time (although Umlauf had warned the singers and orchestra to ignore him), and because of his deafness was not even aware of the applause which followed until he was turned to witness it.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=351}} The ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' gushed, \"inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world\", and Carl Czerny wrote that the Symphony \"breathes such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit&nbsp;... so much power, innovation, and beauty as ever [came] from the head of this original man, although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads.\" The concert did not make much money for Beethoven, as the expenses of mounting it were very high.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=317}} A second concert on 24 May, in which the producer guaranteed him a minimum fee, was poorly attended; nephew Karl noted that \"many people [had] already gone into the country\". It was Beethoven's last public concert.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 318}}\n\nBeethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for Galitzin, despite failing health. The first of these, the [[String Quartet No. 12 (Beethoven)|quartet in E\u266d major, Op. 127]] was premiered by the [[Schuppanzigh Quartet]] in March 1825. While writing the next,  the [[String Quartet No. 15 (Beethoven)|quartet in A minor, Op. 132]], in April 1825, he was struck by a sudden illness. Recuperating in [[Baden]], he included in the quartet its slow movement to which he gave the title \"Holy song of thanks ('Heiliger Dankgesang') to the Divinity, from a convalescent, in the [[Lydian mode]].\" {{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} The next quartet to be completed was the [[String Quartet No. 13 (Beethoven)|Thirteenth, op. 130]], in B\u266d major. In six movements, the last, contrapuntal movement proved to be very difficult for both the performers and the audience at its premiere in March 1826 (again by the Schuppanzigh Quartet). Beethoven was persuaded by the publisher [[Artaria]], for an additional fee, to write a new finale, and to issue the last movement as a separate work (the [[Grosse Fugue]], Op. 133).{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 974-975}} Beethoven's favourite was the last of this series, the [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|quartet in C{{music|#}} minor Op. 131]], which he rated as his most perfect single work.{{sfn|Morris|2010|p=213}}\n\nBeethoven's relations with his nephew Karl had continued to be stormy; Beethoven's letters to him were demanding and reproachful. In August, Karl, who had been seeing his mother again against Beethoven's wishes, attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. He survived and after discharge from hospital went to recuperate in the village of [[Gneixendorf]] with Beethoven and his other uncle Johann. Whilst in Gneixendorf Beethoven completed a further quartet,  ([[String Quartet No. 16 (Beethoven)|Op. 135 in F major]]) which he sent to Schlesinger. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement Beethoven wrote in the manuscript \"Muss es sein?\" (\"Must it be?\");  the response, over the faster main theme of the movement, is \"Es muss sein!\" (\"It must be!\"). The whole movement is headed \"Der schwer gefasste Entschluss\" (\"The Difficult Decision\").{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=977}} Following this in November Beethoven completed his last composition, the new finale for the op. 130 quartet.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} Beethoven at this time was already ill and depressed;{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710 }} he began to quarrel with Johann, insisting that Johann made Karl his heir, in preference to Johann's wife.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p= 1014}}\n\n=== Death ===\n{{Main|Death of Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n[[ File:Beethoven on his deathbed.jpg|thumb|right|Beethoven on his deathbed; sketch by [[Josef Danhauser]]]]On his return to Vienna from Gneixendorf in December 1826, illness struck Beethoven again.

As news spread of the severity of Beethoven's condition, many friends, both old and new, came to visit, including Diabelli, Schuppanzigh, Lichnowsky, Schindler, the composer [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]] and his pupil [[Ferdinand Hiller]]. Many tributes were also sent, including \u00a3100 from the Philharmonic Society in London and a case of wine from Schotts.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=378-379}}{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} During this period he was almost completely bedridden despite occasional brave efforts to rouse himself.

F\u00e9tis]] and  [[Wilhelm von Lenz]]. Later writers sought to identify sub-periods within this generally accepted structure. Its drawbacks include that it generally omits a fourth period, that is, the early years in Bonn, whose works are less often considered; and that it ignores the differential development of Beethoven's composing styles over the years for different categories of work. The piano sonatas, for example, were written throughout Beethoven's life in a progression that can be interpreted as continuous development; the symphonies do not all demonstrate linear progress; of all of the types of composition, perhaps the quartets, which seem to group themselves in three periods (Op. 18 in 1801-1802, Opp. 59, 74 and 95 in 1806-1814, and the quartets, today known as 'late', from 1824 onwards) fit this categorization most neatly. Drabkin concludes  that \"now that we have lived with them so long [...] as long as there are programme notes, essays written to accompany recordings, and all-Beethoven recitals, it is hard to imagine us ever giving up the notion of discrete stylistic periods.\" {{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=198-200}}{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 11}}\n\n===Bonn===\nSome forty compositions, including ten very early works written by Beethoven up to 1785, survive from the years that Beethoven lived in Bonn. It has been suggested that Beethoven largely abandoned composition between 1785 and 1790, possibly as a result of negative critical reaction to his first published works. A 1784 review in [[Johann Nikolaus Forkel]]'s influential ''Musikalischer Almanack'' compared Beethoven's efforts to those of rank beginners.{{sfn|Solomon|1972|p=169}} Most of Beethoven's surviving works from this period were written after he turned twenty, between 1790 and 1792.  Scholars generally regard these early efforts as bland and uninspired and have concluded that his first efforts at writing in the classical sonata style (with the exception of his Wind Octet) were poorly conceived. [[Gustav Nottebohm]], for example, wrote of Beethoven's Dressler Variations (WoO 63), \"they show not a trace of contrapuntal independent part-writing. They are figural variations of the simplest kind\".<ref>Nottebohm, Gustav (1873) [https://archive.org/details/beethovensstudi01nottgoog ''Beethovens Studien'']. Leipzig & Winterthur. p. 10</ref> [[T\u00e9odor de Wyzewa]] considered his early \"Kurf\u00fcrsten Sonatas\" written in 1783 (WoO 47) as merely \"correct imitations of Haydn.\".<ref>Wyzewa, T\u00e9odor de (1914) ''Beethoven et Wagner''. Paris. p. 44</ref> Considered as a whole, Beethoven's compositional efforts in Bonn demonstrate the importance of his move to Vienna in terms of the development of his musical style and the sophistication of his grasp of classical form and idiom.\n\n===The first period===\nThe conventional \"first period\" begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known today from [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a [[scherzo]] rather than a [[minuet and trio]]; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 13}}\n\nHe also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|first]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|second]] symphonies, the set of six string quartets [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|Opus 18]], the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so [[Beethoven's piano sonatas|piano sonatas]], including the famous ''[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Path\u00e9tique]]'' sonata, Op. 13.\n\n===The middle period===\nHis middle (heroic) period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3\u20138), the last two piano concertos, the [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] and [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|violin concerto]], five string quartets (Nos. 7\u201311), several piano sonatas (including the ''[[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|Waldstein]]'' and ''[[Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)|Appassionata]]'' sonatas), the ''[[Violin Sonata No. 9 (Beethoven)|Kreutzer]]'' violin sonata and his only [[opera]], ''[[Fidelio]]''.\n\nThe \"middle period\" is sometimes associated with a \"heroic\" manner of composing,<ref name=\"Solomon1990\">{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Maynard|authorlink=Maynard Solomon|title=Beethoven essays|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2ZH3v2_-4F4C|page=124}}|accessdate=4 August 2011|year=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06379-2|page=124}}</ref> but the use of the term \"heroic\" has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship. The term is more frequently used as an alternative name for the middle period.<ref name=\"Steinberg2006\">{{cite book|last=Steinberg|first=Michael P.|authorlink=Michael P.

He began a renewed study of older music, including works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions. The overture ''[[The Consecration of the House (overture)|The Consecration of the House]]'' (1822) was an early work to attempt to incorporate these influences. A new style emerged, now called his \"late period\". He returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade: the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the late string quartets (see below), and two works for very large forces: the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|String Quartet, Op. 131]] has seven linked movements, and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.{{sfn|GroveOnline}} Other compositions from this period include the ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'', the last five string quartets (including the massive ''[[Gro\u00dfe Fuge]]'') and the last five piano sonatas.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Zentralfriedhof Vienna - Beethoven.JPG|thumb|upright|Beethoven's grave at Vienna [[Zentralfriedhof]]]]The [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] in Bonn was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of his birth. It was the first statue of a composer created in Germany, and the music festival that accompanied the unveiling was the impetus for the very hasty construction of the original [[Beethovenhalle]] in Bonn (it was designed and built within less than a month, on the urging of [[Franz Liszt]]). A statue to Mozart had been unveiled in [[Salzburg]], Austria, in 1842. Vienna did not honour Beethoven with a statue until 1880.{{sfn|Comini|2008|p=316}}\n\nThere is a museum, the [[Beethoven House]], the place of his birth, in central Bonn.

As of 2019, Parramatta's home ground stadium has been rebuilt and they now play as the majority tenants at [[Western Sydney Stadium]], which sits on the same site that was once [[Parramatta Stadium]].\n\nIt took thirty years for the club to make the grand final, which they did in 1976 and 1977, losing on both occasions. However, this period foreshadowed their most successful period in the early 1980s, when they won four premierships and qualified for five grand finals in six seasons. This was a golden era for the club and yielded their only premiership titles. In 2016, a [[Parramatta Eels salary cap breach|salary cap breach]] saw them stripped of their 2016 Auckland Nines premiership. The club plays in the [[National Rugby League]], the premier [[rugby league]] football competition in Australia. Parramatta sides are also fielded in lower grades and junior competitions run by the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] where they regularly win premierships in various grades.\n\n==History==\nThe playing of [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]] in Parramatta lie in the 19th century with the formation of the [[Parramatta Two Blues|Parramatta Rugby Club]] in 1879. With the advent of a Sydney District competition in 1900, the Parramatta club merged with [[West Harbour RFC|Western Suburbs]] and played some of its matches at [[Parramatta Stadium|Cumberland Oval]]. On a local level, rugby league began to be played in 1910 when a district competition was formed.

The proposal was rejected by all clubs except [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] who, despite having the most to lose from the entrance of a Parramatta side (with much of their territory being lost to Parramatta), voted for the entrance of the new club. The advent of World War II put the establishment of the club on hold and a Parramatta district club was not proposed again until 1946 when the club was successfully admitted into the Premiership.<ref name=\"Parramatta\">{{cite web|last=Fagan|first=Sean|url=http://www.rl1908.com/Clubs/Parramatta-Eels.htm|publisher=RL1908|title=Parramatta Eels|accessdate=18 September 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102842/http://www.rl1908.com/Clubs/Parramatta-Eels.htm|archivedate=29 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Foundation and early years===\n\nParramatta saw very little success in their early years, despite narrowly missing out on finals qualification [[1949 NSWRFL season|in 1949]] under the guidance of former [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] and [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] five-eighth [[Vic Hey]]. Between [[1952 NSWRFL season|1952]] [[1961 NSWRFL season|and 1961]], they finished last eight times and won only 35 of 180 matches.  The reasons behind the club doing so poorly in the early years was due to a lack of resources and a weak playing roster.  Where other teams fielded test and representative players, Parramatta fielded mainly amateur players or park footballers.  The only players of note during this dark period were [[Billy Rayner]] and [[Brian Hambly]].<ref>https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/rugby-league-great-dies/news-story/b395e812413287fd7c91d11a97235ec4?sv=384d84464812c2ee8055237f6b415e91</ref><ref>https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/seven-clubs-in-mix-for-nrl-wooden-spoon-and-the-most-unwanted-tag-in-rugby-league/news-story/082c6d690be0411e0d4059bc089e2f6c</ref>\n\nIn 1962, Parramatta made the finals for the first time; this achievement was repeated for the three following seasons under coach [[Ken Kearney]].  Around this time the club managed to finally attract better players such as [[Ken Thornett]], [[Dick Thornett]] and [[Bob O'Reilly]]. However, the club slid back down the ladder in the following years, collecting the wooden spoon in 1970 and 1972.

After 18 rounds and incredibly inconsistent form, the Parramatta Eels had won only 5 games and were sitting third-last and were in direct contention for the dreaded 2009 NRL Wooden Spoon. TAB SportsBet had the Eels as $151 outsiders to win the [[NRL]] Premiership.\n\nThough beginning in Round 19, upset victories against the [[Melbourne Storm]] and the [[Bulldogs Rugby League Football Club|Canterbury Bulldogs]] set the platform for an unexpected 10 wins from the next 11 games, which propelled the Eels into the Top 8 and consequently, premiership contention. This unanticipated winning streak was directly attributed by many sporting experts including Rugby League legend [[Andrew Johns]] to the spectacular run of form of star fullback [[Jarryd Hayne]]. Winning the award for man-of-the-match in every game from Round 19-24, and again in the first week of the finals, Hayne was described as \"the best player in any code of football in Australia\" by premiership-winning coach Phil Gould. Following his astonishing string of 7-man-of-the-match performances, Hayne won the award for Dally M Fullback of the Year and was crowned the best and fairest player in the game, winning the [[Dally M Medal]] for 2009.\n\nAfter a 7-game winning streak, the Eels succumbed to a heavy defeat by the minor premiers [[St George-Illawarra Dragons]], however they returned to Kogarah in Week 1 of the 2009 NRL Finals Series and defeated the Dragons 25\u201312 featuring an impressive late game try by Dally M medal winner [[Jarryd Hayne]]. Following successive wins against the [[Gold Coast Titans]] (a team that Parramatta had never beaten before), 27\u20132 at SFS and the [[Bulldogs Rugby League Football Club|Bulldogs]], 22\u201312 in front of a record-breaking non-Grand Final crowd of 74,549 at ANZ stadium, the Eels qualified for their first Grand Final since 2001, becoming the first 8th-placed team to ever qualify for a Grand Final.

The names of the new trains were to be \"The Hayne Train\" and \"The Fuifui Moimoi Express\". They were to be painted blue and gold, and run along the western line of the railway network.<ref>http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/meet-the-wags-who-kept-the-parramatta-eels-hopes-alive/news-story/79f3a813cb39ce7dc81460253f58a180?sv=f329a5e3720a58d0cff90780b3d5ed4d</ref>\n\n===2010s===\n\nOn 22 April 2010 the Melbourne Storm were stripped of the premiership as a result of long-term gross salary cap breaches disclosed by the NRL. However, the premiership for 2009 was not handed over to the Parramatta Eels, instead remaining vacant.\n\nIn 2010, the Parramatta Eels were picked at the beginning of the year by many leading betting agencies to take out the premiership for 2010 following their surge of form which took them to the Grand Final in 2009. But, after a relatively poor to the season, and then a 4-game winning streak, the Parramatta Eels once again returned to the inconsistent form of past seasons. This inconsistent form, recognised by all Rugby League fans, saw them miss out on the Top 8 in 2010.\n\nAfter a season of unrelenting disappointment which saw five-eighth [[Daniel Mortimer]] dropped to reserve grade, centre [[Timana Tahu]] being suspended for an on-field confrontation against the [[Newcastle Knights]] and reports of player rifts, [[Daniel Anderson (rugby league)|Daniel Anderson]] was sacked unceremoniously as Parramatta coach and replaced by New Zealand World Cup-winning coach [[Stephen Kearney]].\n\nThe Eels made several new player signings for the 2011 season. In the forwards, the Eels added former [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] centre [[Carl Webb]] and former [[Bulldogs (NRL team)|Bulldogs]] and [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks|Cronulla]] as well as one-time [[Australia national rugby league team|Kangaroo]] [[Reni Maitua]]. To bolster the backs after the retirement of [[Eric Grothe, Jr.|Eric Grothe Jr]] and the departure of [[Timana Tahu]], the Eels signed the experienced pair of [[Chris Walker (rugby league)|Chris Walker]] and [[Chris Hicks (rugby league)|Chris Hicks]].\n\nThe 2011 season was to be considered a year of \"almosts\u201c for Parramatta, with the team losing over half of their matches by four points or fewer, many of which were conceded after attaining leads over their opponents. The Eels pushed a record four games into [[Golden Point]] during the season, however were unable to win any, resulting in a draw against the [[St George Illawarra Dragons]] and one-point losses to the [[Penrith Panthers]], [[Sydney Roosters]] and the [[Canterbury Bulldogs]].\n\nThroughout the 2011 season, coach Stephen Kearney motioned several reshuffles of the Parramatta side, the most high-profile change being fullback Jarryd Hayne's switch to five-eighth after his ball-playing abilities were considered by several experts including the NSW State of Origin coach Ricky Stuart, as his strongest point. Other switches include the moving of [[Luke Burt]] to fullback, second-rower Ben Smith to right centre, and the resting of five-eighth [[Daniel Mortimer]].\n\nBefore the final match of their season, the Eels had won only five of their 24 games and were in contention for the dreaded wooden spoon. During their final match, the Parramatta side emerged victorious over the [[Gold Coast Titans]] who were also direct contenders for last place. The wooden spoon was awarded to the Gold Coast side, finishing 16th on the NRL ladder, the Eels finishing in 14th position.\n\nThe 2012 season saw the retirement of Eels legends [[Luke Burt]] and [[Nathan Hindmarsh]]. It would also mark the first time since [[1972 NSWRFL season|1972]] that the team would succumb to the dreaded wooden spoon. The Eels struggled all year, securing just their first win of the season in Round 5 against defending premiers [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] before ending a six-game losing streak against the [[Cronulla Sharks]]. This horror start to the season, and a win rate of less than 25% over almost two seasons with the club, coach [[Stephen Kearney]] was forced to resign and Assistant Coach Brad Arthur would become caretaker. The team responded to this producing 3 wins from 4 games, including competition front-runners [[Melbourne Storm]] and [[Brisbane Broncos]] to give the fans some hope for the rest of the season. However this was short lived and following a 38-6 thumping to the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] in Round 25 of the Telstra Premiership were officially unable to avoid the wooden spoon.\n\nWhilst Parramatta's problems in 2012 were largely attributed to their relatively poor defence, numerous pundits blamed them on the recurring absences of star fullback [[Jarryd Hayne]]. Even whilst producing higher per-match statistics than any other fullback in the game (8 tries, 14 try-assists), Hayne only managed to complete 10 games from the season's 24, due to both injury and [[State of Origin series|State of Origin duty]].\n\nThroughout the season many of the Eels players came under scrutiny and were dropped to the [[NSW Cup]], including high-profile recruit [[Chris Sandow]], who at the time was touted as overweight and unfit,<ref name=\"overweight\">http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/sterling-slams-overweight-sandow/story-e6frexnr-1226322603592</ref> and veteran [[Luke Burt]]. As a result, players Matt Ryan, [[Jake Mullaney]] and [[Nathan Smith (rugby league born 1988)|Nathan Smith]] were called up to the top squad and have impressed in their roles of Second-Row, Fullback and Hooker respectively, making a suitable replacement for injured stars [[Jarryd Hayne]] and [[Matt Keating]].\n\nTowards the end of the season [[Ricky Stuart]] was announced as the new coach for the Parramatta Eels from 2013.<ref name=\"newcoach\">http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/nrl/ricky-stuart-to-coach-parramatta-eels-for-next-three-seasons/story-e6frfgbo-1226435192460</ref>\n\nAnother wooden spoon followed in 2013, with the club suffering their second biggest loss ever (4\u201364 to Melbourne in Round 24), and conceding three other scores of 50 or more. On 12 September 2013 it was announced Ricky Stuart would leave the Eels to take up the head coaching role at Canberra for the 2014 season.\n\nThe Eels determined to continue their rebuilding process in the off season after receiving the wooden spoon two years running. The club has done this by releasing 12 players and signing more in key areas to help them achieve success in the 2014 season.<ref>http://www.zerotackle.com/nrl/rugby-league/teams/parramatta-eels/</ref>\n\nParramatta also recruited a new coach in [[Brad Arthur]], formerly an Assistant Coach at the club, as Ricky Stuart reneged on the final two years of his contract. This was in order to return to his hometown of Canberra and coach the Raiders, the team he played for during his youth. Before the 2014 season started, Brad Arthur and Parramatta implemented a new recruitment policy and made strong signings including future NSW hooker [[Nathan Peats]], promising star [[Corey Norman]] and [[William Hopoate]] who was a 2011 premiership winner and NSW representative before leaving rugby league to join a two-year Mormon mission.<ref>https://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/five-new-eels-recruits-have-given-parramatta-fans-a-reason-to-believe-once-again/news-story/f6fd862d0cdc0912c62eed615d14f568</ref>\n\nThe 2014 season started off in great style as Parramatta won 4 out of their first 6 matches. Parramatta then went into their Easter Monday clash at Stadium Australia sitting 5th on the ladder but lost the match controversially 21-18 in front of 50,000 fans. In round 24 Parramatta were sitting 8th on the ladder and looked destined to play in the finals for the first time since 2009 and only needed to win one of their last two remaining games against sides lower than them on the table which were Canberra and Newcastle. Parramatta lost both matches and missed out on the finals series by two competition points.<ref>http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/teams/knights/parramatta-eels-finals-hopes-hit-by-a-secondhalf-blitz-from-newcastle-knights/news-story/ef379d470227dd9162766cf13a340f3b</ref><ref>https://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/rugby-league-match-centre/parramatta-eels-v-wests-tigers-20140417-36vfv.html</ref>\n\nThe 2015 season was a year to forget for Parramatta as they finished 12th on the table.

In addition to being fined $1 million, Parramatta also had its 2016 NRL Auckland Nines title revoked.[35][36]. On 19 July 2016 the Parramatta Leagues Club board was sacked by the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority, and an administrator appointed. This effectively also removed the Eels board as the seven directors on both boards were the same people. Max Donnelly, of Ferrier Hodgson was appointed as administrator.[37]. At the time of the 12-point deduction, Parramatta were sitting 5th on the ladder but then found themselves at 14th position. Their first match played after the points deduction was against South Sydney at Parramatta Stadium, Parramatta lost the match 22-20 in a close game. 2016 would also prove to be the final year that Parramatta would play at Parramatta Stadium as it was due to be demolished at seasons end to make way for a new 30,000 seat stadium. The final home game played at Parramatta Stadium was against The St George Dragons in front of 13,553 spectators. Parramatta went on to beat St George 30-18. Parramatta's final game of 2016 saw them travel to New Zealand to play The Auckland Warriors. Parramatta won the match 40-18 with Bevan French scoring 3 tries. At the end of the season, Parramatta finished in 14th place on the ladder but if they had not been stripped of the 12 competition points they would have played in the finals.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-13/souths-break-parramatta-hearts-as-eels-fans-rally-around-club/7414160</ref><ref>http://www.theroar.com.au/2016/09/04/new-zealand-warriors-vs-parramatta-eels-nrl-live-scores-blog-3/</ref><ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-29/bevan-french-parramatta-eels-st-george-illawarra-dragons-nrl/7796414</ref> The 2016 season was also difficult for Parramatta as to become salary cap compliant the club needed to release players such as [[Nathan Peats]] and [[Junior Paulo (rugby league, born 1993)|Junior Paulo]] to be able to play for points. Star recruit [[Kieran Foran]] who signed only months earlier on a $1 million a year contract also walked out on the club mid-season due to numerous personal problems and off field issues.<ref>https://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/reaction-to-kieran-foran-reportedly-quitting-the-nrl/news-story/5191e1414f841785ff645779385fcafa</ref>\n\nThe 2017 season saw a major turnaround for the club with Parramatta finishing fourth on the table and making the finals for the first time since 2009. Some of the highlights throughout the year were the club winning nine out of their final ten matches and defeating Brisbane twice including a 52-34 win at [[Suncorp Stadium]] and eventual premiers Melbourne.<ref>http://www.nrl.com/eels-2017-season-review/tabid/10874/newsid/112225/default.aspx</ref><ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-24/parramatta-eels-brisbane-broncos-nrl/8834608</ref> Parramatta then went on to play premiership favorites Melbourne in the first qualifying final, going into the second half Parramatta had stunned everyone by leading the match and it took Melbourne the last play of the game to hold on and win 18-16.<ref>https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrlfinals/live-nrl-finals-melbourne-storm-v-parramatta-eels-score-updates-result-blog/news-story/225e83d53f61bd57e9d3a3eebbb11ebf</ref> The following week, Parramatta played against North Queensland in the sudden death elimination final.  Parramatta led 10-6 at halftime but went on to lose the match 24-16 in what would be one of the biggest upsets of the season.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-16/nrl-north-queensland-cowboys-beat-parramatta-eels/8940644</ref>\n\nFor the 2018 season, Parramatta were predicted by many before the season to finish in the top 8 and challenge for the premiership. Those predictions were matched in the opening round of the season as Parramatta lead Penrith 14-0 early on but after a second half capitulation lost the game 24-14.  In Round 2, Parramatta were humiliated 54-0 by Manly at [[Brookvale Oval]]. Parramatta went on to lose the opening 6 games of the season before eventually winning their first game of the season defeating Manly 44-10 in Round 7.  In Round 8, Parramatta defeated Wests 24-22 to make it back to back victories for the club. The Eels then went on to lose the next 5 games in a row before eventually winning their third game of the season defeating North Queensland 20-14 in Darwin in which [[Jarryd Hayne]] returned from injury scoring two tries. The following weeks were filled with disappointment as the club came close to pulling off upset wins against top of the table St George only for the club to concede two tries in 5 minutes to lose 20-18 and South Sydney after leading 20-6 late into the game only for The Rabbitohs to score late tries and win 26-20. In Round 18, Parramatta lost 18-16 to Newcastle with The Eels being denied a last minute try after it was ruled winger [[Bevan French]] had put his foot over the sideline. The following week, Parramatta defeated arch rivals Canterbury 14-8 in what the media dubbed the \"Spoon Bowl\". There were hopes that Parramatta could avoid the wooden spoon as going into the second last game of the season the club sat above North Queensland on the table due to for and against. In what was the retiring Jonathan Thurston's final home game, both clubs needed a win to avoid the wooden spoon. North Queensland won the match 44-6. In the final game of the season, Parramatta were defeated 44-10 by the Sydney Roosters ensuring that the club finished last and claimed their 14th wooden spoon and the Roosters claiming the minor premiership. Before the match, the Roosters needed to defeat Parramatta by 27 points to overtake Melbourne and finish first on the table.<ref>https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/teams/eels/parramatta-eels-season-2018-review-peter-sterlings-biggest-fear-after-horror-campaign/news-story/14f79c1c637fa8d03bbfa6d6b63b55f1</ref><ref>https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/03/03/expert-predictions-for-nrl-top-eight-in-2018/</ref><ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-28/nrl-st-george-illawarra-edge-out-paramatta/9914596</ref>\n\nBefore the start of the [[2019 NRL season]], Parramatta were predicted by many to finish towards the bottom of the table or claim another wooden spoon.  The club started off the year with back to back victories over [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]] and arch rivals [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]].  In Round 6 of the [[2019 NRL season]], Parramatta played their first game at the new [[Western Sydney Stadium]] against the [[Wests Tigers]] and ran out 51-6 winners in front of a sold-out crowd.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-22/parramatta-eels-thrash-west-tigers-nrl/11034182/|title=Parramatta Eels thrash Wests Tigers 51-6 to christen new Parramatta Stadium|website=www.abc.net.au}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/11/22/fans-predictions-where-each-club-will-finish-in-2019/|title=Where each club will finish in 2019|website=NRL}}</ref>\n\nIn Round 9 against Melbourne, Parramatta suffered one of their worst ever defeats losing 64-10 at [[Suncorp Stadium]].  In the aftermath of the defeat, coach [[Brad Arthur]] and the players were placed under intense scrutiny but just a week after the loss, Arthur was given a two-year contract extension by the Parramatta board.  The club would then go on to lose against North Queensland and last placed Penrith in the coming weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2019/05/13/arthur-set-to-sign-new-contract-with-parramatta/|title=Arthur signs new contract with Parramatta|website=www.nrl.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/parramatta-eels-sign-coach-brad-arthur-to-new-nrl-deal/news-story/85369a404dc833f39d17678006eb8d93/|title=Parramatta Eels sign coach Brad Arthur to new NRL deal|website=www.foxsports.com.au}}</ref>\n\nBetween Round 12 and Round 22 of the 2019 season, Parramatta would go on to win 8 of their 10 games.  In Round 22 against the [[Gold Coast Titans]], Parramatta qualified for the 2019 finals series with a 36-12 victory at [[Cbus Super Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://7news.com.au/sport/rugby-league/moses-guides-eels-past-sorry-titans-in-nrl-c-403444/|title=Moses guides Eels past sorry Titans in NRL|website=7 News}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 2019 regular season, Parramatta finished 5th on the table and qualified for the finals.  In the elimination final against Brisbane, Parramatta won the match 58-0 at the new [[Western Sydney Stadium]].  The victory was the biggest finals win in history, eclipsing Newtown's 55-7 win over St George in 1944.  The match was also Parramatta's biggest win over Brisbane and Brisbane's worst ever loss since entering the competition in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-15/eels-make-history-with-58-point-finals-flogging-of-broncos/11505120/|title=Parramatta Eels eliminate Brisbane Broncos from the NRL Finals with a thumping 58-0 win|website=ABC}}</ref>\nThe following week against Melbourne in the elimination semi final, Parramatta were defeated 32-0 at [[AAMI Park]] which ended their season.  The loss against Melbourne was also the sixth time Parramatta had been defeated by Melbourne in a finals game since 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-21/nrl-live-semi-final-melbourne-storm-parramatta-eels/11527200/|title=Melbourne Storm crush Parramatta 32-0 in their semi-final to set up prelim against the Roosters|website=ABC}}</ref>\n\n==Club identity==\n\n===Name and emblem===\nLike most NSWRFL clubs founded before the 1980s, Parramatta was established with no official nickname or mascot. The only nickname Parramatta had ever been known by was the \"Fruitpickers\", a reference to the [[orchard]]s spread throughout the District and surrounding suburbs in the first half of the 20th century. As the competition and the clubs themselves became more focused on marketing in the 1970s, Parramatta adopted an official club mascot.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn the mid-1960s, [[Peter Frilingos]], a Sydney rugby league journalist, suggested that the club should be known as the \"[[Eel]]s\". This reasoning was based on the name of the Parramatta, anglicised from the Aboriginal dialect \"Barramattagal\" meaning \"place where the Eels dwell\". After this, the team was commonly called \"The Eels\" and it became an official nickname in the late 1970s.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nAs a result, the club's crest was changed in 1980, to a design featuring an eel. This crest remained, despite several changes in jersey design, until a new eel logo was introduced in 2000. In 2004, the club mascot featured on the crest reverted to an eel drawing similar to that featured on the original crest.\n\nParramatta has also used two separate crests based on [[City of Parramatta|Parramatta City]]'s crest. The first was a highly detailed scene showing a typical scene on the foreshore of the Parramatta River in the early days of European settlement.  It is an apparent tribute to the District's original occupants, the [[Darug people|Barramattagal]] tribe. In the foreground of the original crest, a male [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] is preparing to spear a fish while a woman in a canoe watches. In the background a paddle steamer is visible as well as the tree-lined banks of the Parramatta River. This crest was used by the Club until the 1970s when a more stylised version showing only the hunter, and the club's name on a scroll, was used.  This crest is still used in 2006 by the Parramatta District Junior Rugby League Football Club.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn 2009, the Parramatta Eels announced they were returning to their original 1980s club emblem in the 2011 season with the numbers 1947 added, this being the year of conception of the Eels.\n\n===Colours===\nWhen a Parramatta District Club was first proposed in 1936, the colours put forward to the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] by the District were emerald green and white, as these were the colours worn by the Western Districts President's Cup side and the Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club.<ref name=\"Cumberland\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?c=7-724-0-0-0&sID=3256|publisher=SportingPulse|title=60 Years of Parramatta Junior League|accessdate=6 September 2006}}</ref> However, when the proposal for a Parramatta club was next put to the NSWRL in 1946, the proposed colours for the new District side were blue and gold. These colours are said to have been selected based on the [[navy]], [[sky blue]] and gold colours used by [[Arthur Phillip High School]].<ref name=\"Parramatta\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://faxmentis.org/html/badge01.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030612094926/http://faxmentis.org/html/badge01.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 June 2003|publisher=Parramatta High School|title=Parramatta High School Badge|accessdate=18 September 2007}}</ref> These colours were also adopted by the [[Parramatta Two Blues|Parramatta District Rugby Union club]] in 1936 and also suggested in [[Parramatta City Council|Parramatta City Council's]] use of livery of blue and golden-orange in their crest. While this colour scheme has remained consistent throughout the history of the club, the shades of blue and gold have changed several times.\n\nThe original Parramatta jersey used in 1947 was of a blue design with a single yellow hoop around the middle of the jersey, extending across the sleeves. This original design was altered in 1949 to a design based on blue and gold hoops and remained unchanged until the 1970s when a jersey comprising stripes on a predominantly blue or gold background was adopted. Over the years, the design has changed gradually from one based on blue and gold stripes to a design incorporating different blue and gold designs around the fringes of a predominantly blue or gold jersey.\n\n==Stadium==\n{{details|Parramatta Stadium|ANZ Stadium|Western Sydney Stadium}}\n\nRugby league was played at Cumberland Oval from as early as 1909 by local clubs such as Parramatta Iona, Endeavours and the Western Districts representative side. When the club was admitted into the NSWRL Premiership in 1947, Cumberland Oval became its home ground. The club played its first match in the premiership on 12 April 1947 against [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]], being defeated 34\u201312 in front of 6,000 spectators. Cumberland Oval remained the home ground of the Parramatta Eels until 1981; the club played their last match there against the [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parramattastadium.com.au/article.phtml?artid=13|publisher=Parramatta Stadium|title=Cumberland|accessdate=14 July 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070812170033/http://www.parramattastadium.com.au/article.phtml?artid=13 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 12 August 2007}}</ref> Later that year, after the Parramatta Eels secured their first-ever Premiership trophy, Eels fans rallied at Cumberland Oval; during the celebrations, fans set fire to the ground's soon-to-be-demolished stand.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1985, the club used [[Belmore Oval]], home of the [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]], as a temporary home ground while a new facility [[Parramatta Stadium]] was built. The new stadium to be built on the site of Cumberland Oval was approved by the [[New South Wales]] Government for development in 1983 and the contract for the construction and design of the Stadium was put to competitive tender.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parramattastadium.com.au/content/view/90/55/ |publisher=Parramatta Stadium |title=Redevelopment |accessdate=24 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212131530/http://www.parramattastadium.com.au/content/view/90/55/ |archivedate=12 February 2010 }}</ref> After construction was completed in November 1985, the club played its first match at the new stadium on 16 March 1986 winning this opening game 36\u20136 against the [[St. George Dragons]].

The largest ever rugby league attendance at Parramatta Stadium was set on 6 July 1994 when 27,918 saw [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] defeat [[France national rugby league team|France]] 58-0 in a one-off [[1994 French rugby league Oceania tour|mid-season Test match]]. This was also the first test match held in Sydney since 1914 that wasn't played at either the [[Sydney Showground (Moore Park)|Agricultural Ground]], the SCG, or the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].\n\nParramatta Stadium was closed & demolished in 2017 with the [[Western Sydney Stadium]] being built in the same location. This stadium has a 30,000 seat capacity and was opened in 2019.  The first NRL match to be played at the new venue was in Round 6 2019 between Parramatta and [[Wests Tigers]].  Parramatta won the match 51-6 in front of a full house.

The clubs also competed in several play-off finals matches during this period including a controversial drawn semi-final and subsequent replay in 1978. The famous rivalry between the clubs was also marked in an advertising [[jingle]] in a 1970s [[Tooheys]] television commercial.

The Eels were the Dragons' first-ever opponents as a joint-venture and the match was also the second ever held at [[Stadium Australia]] which would be the venue for the Olympic Games the following year. The Eels won 20-10 but the Dragons later moved on to make the Grand Final. The rivalry was not based on geographic location or tribalism as it was more based on both teams being in the finals hunt and pursuit of the premiership. In recent years there were some memorable, not to mention controversial matches, including:\n*Round 18, 2005: Dragons captain [[Trent Barrett]] and Eels hooker [[PJ Marsh]] instigated an all-in brawl as Barrett kicked down-field and Marsh attempted to smother his kick. Barrett took exception to the tackle and punched Marsh in the back of the head whilst Eels fullback [[Wade McKinnon]] fielded the kick and ran 80 metres to score. It turned out to be the turning point to the match as the Eels would go on to win 40-14.\n*Round 13, 2006: After 70 minutes without a score, Parramatta kicked a field goal to go 1-0 up before 8 unanswered points by the Dragons got them home 8-1 in one of the weirdest matches ever in NRL history. This match was played in driving rain at [[WIN Jubilee Oval]], [[Kogarah, New South Wales|Kogarah]].\n*Round 26, 2009: With the minor premiership seemingly all but lost, the Dragons thrashed the Eels 37-0 to actually finish on top of the NRL ladder from the Bulldogs who had lost 34-18 against the [[Wests Tigers]] in the second match played on the same night as the Dragons vs Eels match. The win by the Dragons ended Parramatta's late season surge and it saw the Eels finish eighth.\n*4th Qualifying Final, 2009: But in the qualifying final nine days later, the Eels turned the tables on the Dragons and beat the premiership favourites 25-12, a 50-point turnaround. The Eels would then go on to make the Grand Final (which they ultimately lost to the disgraced [[Melbourne Storm]]) whilst the Dragons would exit the finals altogether after losing to the [[Brisbane Broncos]] 24-10.\n*Round 13, 2011: After being thrashed 30-0 against the Dragons in a previous round the Eels began the match as underdogs. The Eels got out to a 14-0 lead only for it to be chased down by the Dragons. After 10 minutes of extra time and neither side being able to break the dead-lock, the game was declared a draw. However, Eels fullback Jarryd Hayne almost pulled off a miracle field goal from close to 60 metres out only for the kick to fade late and miss by half a metre.\n\n===Parramatta Eels vs Melbourne Storm rivalry===\n\nThe Eels have also developed a rivalry with the [[Melbourne Storm]]. After the Storm were found to have breached the salary cap from 2006-2010 the Eels felt robbed of a premiership, having gone down to the Storm in the 2009 Grand Final and wanted a chance at redemption. In 2010 the Eels got this chance.\n*Round 13, 2010: After Melbourne were found to have breached the salary cap over the previous five years and robbed several teams of premiership glory including the Parramatta Eels, the Eels got their chance at redemption. In front of a loud and proud home crowd who let Melbourne know what they'd done, the Eels beat the Storm, who still had their illegal roster but could no longer accrue points, 24-10. The game was marred by two fights which erupted. The first started after Eels fullback Jarryd Hayne and Storm fullback Billy Slater came head to head after Hayne had worked Slater over in a tackle. Hayne proceeded to head-butt Slater who responded with a punch and the 2 had to be separated. The second occurred again after Hayne and Slater came together. This time Slater was the aggressor and appeared to lead with an elbow when tackling Hayne. The Eels' Five-Eighth Daniel Mortimer was then put in the Sin-Bin for being the third man in. The Eels fired-up after this incident with prop Fuifui Moimoi charging onto the ball from the ensuing penalty and gaining 20 metres. The Eels kept their heads and won the game by a comfortable margin in the end.\n\nAs of 21 September 2019, Parramatta has never defeated Melbourne in a finals game having lost all six encounters in the 1999 preliminary final, 2006 qualifying final, 2007 preliminary final, The [[2009 NRL Grand Final]], 2017 qualifying final and the 2019 elimination semi final.<ref>https://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/melbourne-storm-survive-huge-scare-to-topple-parramatta-to-book-preliminary-final-berth-20170909-gye5jn.html</ref><ref>http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/Custom/Ny0tLS0tLS0tLS0tNS0tbi0tLS0tLS0t</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/21/storm-beat-eels-but-must-wait-on-captain-smiths-fate/|title=Storm beat Eels but must wait on captain Smith's fate|website=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n==Players==\n{{Main|List of Parramatta Eels players}}\n\n===Current squad===\n{{Parramatta Eels current squad}}\n\n===2020 Transfers===\n'''Gains'''\n* [[Regan Campbell-Gillard]] '''From''' [[Penrith Panthers]] \n* [[Ryan Matterson]] '''From''' [[West Tigers]]\n\n'''Losses'''\n* [[Manu Ma'u]] '''To''' [[Hull F.C.]]\n* [[Tepai Moeroa]] '''To''' Rugby Union\n* [[Tim Mannah]] Retired\n\n===Notable players===\nIn 2002 a team of the greatest Parramatta players, known as the ''Parramatta Legends'', were selected based on a public vote of fans.

As of 2019, Parramatta's home ground stadium has been rebuilt and they now play as the majority tenants at [[Western Sydney Stadium]], which sits on the same site that was once [[Parramatta Stadium]].\n\nIt took thirty years for the club to make the grand final, which they did in 1976 and 1977, losing on both occasions. However, this period foreshadowed their most successful period in the early 1980s, when they won four premierships and qualified for five grand finals in six seasons. This was a golden era for the club and yielded their only premiership titles. In 2016, a [[Parramatta Eels salary cap breach|salary cap breach]] saw them stripped of their 2016 Auckland Nines premiership. The club plays in the [[National Rugby League]], the premier [[rugby league]] football competition in Australia. Parramatta sides are also fielded in lower grades and junior competitions run by the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] where they regularly win premierships in various grades.\n\n==History==\nThe playing of [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]] in Parramatta lie in the 19th century with the formation of the [[Parramatta Two Blues|Parramatta Rugby Club]] in 1879. With the advent of a Sydney District competition in 1900, the Parramatta club merged with [[West Harbour RFC|Western Suburbs]] and played some of its matches at [[Parramatta Stadium|Cumberland Oval]]. On a local level, rugby league began to be played in 1910 when a district competition was formed.  Other clubs in the Parramatta district also emerged; over the ensuing decades, clubs established in suburbs throughout the area.<ref name=\"Cumberland\">{{cite web|url=http://www.parramattastadium.com.au/content/view/23/|publisher=Parramatta Stadium|title=Cumberland Oval|accessdate=24 February 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nPressure in the area for a local club to participate in the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership]] began in the mid-1930s with a formal proposal put to the NSWRL in 1936 by local rugby league identities such as [[Jack Argent]] and [[Jack Scullin]]. The proposal was rejected by all clubs except [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] who, despite having the most to lose from the entrance of a Parramatta side (with much of their territory being lost to Parramatta), voted for the entrance of the new club. The advent of World War II put the establishment of the club on hold and a Parramatta district club was not proposed again until 1946 when the club was successfully admitted into the Premiership.<ref name=\"Parramatta\">{{cite web|last=Fagan|first=Sean|url=http://www.rl1908.com/Clubs/Parramatta-Eels.htm|publisher=RL1908|title=Parramatta Eels|accessdate=18 September 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102842/http://www.rl1908.com/Clubs/Parramatta-Eels.htm|archivedate=29 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Foundation and early years===\n\nParramatta saw very little success in their early years, despite narrowly missing out on finals qualification [[1949 NSWRFL season|in 1949]] under the guidance of former [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] and [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] five-eighth [[Vic Hey]]. Between [[1952 NSWRFL season|1952]] [[1961 NSWRFL season|and 1961]], they finished last eight times and won only 35 of 180 matches.  The reasons behind the club doing so poorly in the early years was due to a lack of resources and a weak playing roster.  Where other teams fielded test and representative players, Parramatta fielded mainly amateur players or park footballers.  The only players of note during this dark period were [[Billy Rayner]] and [[Brian Hambly]].<ref>https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/rugby-league-great-dies/news-story/b395e812413287fd7c91d11a97235ec4?sv=384d84464812c2ee8055237f6b415e91</ref><ref>https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/seven-clubs-in-mix-for-nrl-wooden-spoon-and-the-most-unwanted-tag-in-rugby-league/news-story/082c6d690be0411e0d4059bc089e2f6c</ref>\n\nIn 1962, Parramatta made the finals for the first time; this achievement was repeated for the three following seasons under coach [[Ken Kearney]].  Around this time the club managed to finally attract better players such as [[Ken Thornett]], [[Dick Thornett]] and [[Bob O'Reilly]]. However, the club slid back down the ladder in the following years, collecting the wooden spoon in 1970 and 1972.

In the [[1998 NRL season]] Parramatta finished 4th and defeated [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]] in the first week of the finals 25-12. The following week Parramatta traveled to Brisbane in the major semi final and won the match 15-10 earning the week off.\n\nIn the 1998 preliminary final Parramatta were leading arch rivals Canterbury 18-2 with less than 10 minutes to play and then what can only be described as the greatest choke in Rugby League preliminary finals history occurred. Canterbury managed to fight their way back into the match and with a minute left on the scoreboard, winger [[Daryl Halligan]] kicked a conversion from out on the far touchline to send the game into extra time. Canterbury won in extra time 32-20.

After 18 rounds and incredibly inconsistent form, the Parramatta Eels had won only 5 games and were sitting third-last and were in direct contention for the dreaded 2009 NRL Wooden Spoon. TAB SportsBet had the Eels as $151 outsiders to win the [[NRL]] Premiership.\n\nThough beginning in Round 19, upset victories against the [[Melbourne Storm]] and the [[Bulldogs Rugby League Football Club|Canterbury Bulldogs]] set the platform for an unexpected 10 wins from the next 11 games, which propelled the Eels into the Top 8 and consequently, premiership contention. This unanticipated winning streak was directly attributed by many sporting experts including Rugby League legend [[Andrew Johns]] to the spectacular run of form of star fullback [[Jarryd Hayne]]. Winning the award for man-of-the-match in every game from Round 19-24, and again in the first week of the finals, Hayne was described as \"the best player in any code of football in Australia\" by premiership-winning coach Phil Gould. Following his astonishing string of 7-man-of-the-match performances, Hayne won the award for Dally M Fullback of the Year and was crowned the best and fairest player in the game, winning the [[Dally M Medal]] for 2009.\n\nAfter a 7-game winning streak, the Eels succumbed to a heavy defeat by the minor premiers [[St George-Illawarra Dragons]], however they returned to Kogarah in Week 1 of the 2009 NRL Finals Series and defeated the Dragons 25\u201312 featuring an impressive late game try by Dally M medal winner [[Jarryd Hayne]]. Following successive wins against the [[Gold Coast Titans]] (a team that Parramatta had never beaten before), 27\u20132 at SFS and the [[Bulldogs Rugby League Football Club|Bulldogs]], 22\u201312 in front of a record-breaking non-Grand Final crowd of 74,549 at ANZ stadium, the Eels qualified for their first Grand Final since 2001, becoming the first 8th-placed team to ever qualify for a Grand Final.

The names of the new trains were to be \"The Hayne Train\" and \"The Fuifui Moimoi Express\". They were to be painted blue and gold, and run along the western line of the railway network.<ref>http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/meet-the-wags-who-kept-the-parramatta-eels-hopes-alive/news-story/79f3a813cb39ce7dc81460253f58a180?sv=f329a5e3720a58d0cff90780b3d5ed4d</ref>\n\n===2010s===\n\nOn 22 April 2010 the Melbourne Storm were stripped of the premiership as a result of long-term gross salary cap breaches disclosed by the NRL. However, the premiership for 2009 was not handed over to the Parramatta Eels, instead remaining vacant.\n\nIn 2010, the Parramatta Eels were picked at the beginning of the year by many leading betting agencies to take out the premiership for 2010 following their surge of form which took them to the Grand Final in 2009. But, after a relatively poor to the season, and then a 4-game winning streak, the Parramatta Eels once again returned to the inconsistent form of past seasons. This inconsistent form, recognised by all Rugby League fans, saw them miss out on the Top 8 in 2010.\n\nAfter a season of unrelenting disappointment which saw five-eighth [[Daniel Mortimer]] dropped to reserve grade, centre [[Timana Tahu]] being suspended for an on-field confrontation against the [[Newcastle Knights]] and reports of player rifts, [[Daniel Anderson (rugby league)|Daniel Anderson]] was sacked unceremoniously as Parramatta coach and replaced by New Zealand World Cup-winning coach [[Stephen Kearney]].\n\nThe Eels made several new player signings for the 2011 season. In the forwards, the Eels added former [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] centre [[Carl Webb]] and former [[Bulldogs (NRL team)|Bulldogs]] and [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks|Cronulla]] as well as one-time [[Australia national rugby league team|Kangaroo]] [[Reni Maitua]]. To bolster the backs after the retirement of [[Eric Grothe, Jr.|Eric Grothe Jr]] and the departure of [[Timana Tahu]], the Eels signed the experienced pair of [[Chris Walker (rugby league)|Chris Walker]] and [[Chris Hicks (rugby league)|Chris Hicks]].\n\nThe 2011 season was to be considered a year of \"almosts\u201c for Parramatta, with the team losing over half of their matches by four points or fewer, many of which were conceded after attaining leads over their opponents. The Eels pushed a record four games into [[Golden Point]] during the season, however were unable to win any, resulting in a draw against the [[St George Illawarra Dragons]] and one-point losses to the [[Penrith Panthers]], [[Sydney Roosters]] and the [[Canterbury Bulldogs]].\n\nThroughout the 2011 season, coach Stephen Kearney motioned several reshuffles of the Parramatta side, the most high-profile change being fullback Jarryd Hayne's switch to five-eighth after his ball-playing abilities were considered by several experts including the NSW State of Origin coach Ricky Stuart, as his strongest point. Other switches include the moving of [[Luke Burt]] to fullback, second-rower Ben Smith to right centre, and the resting of five-eighth [[Daniel Mortimer]].\n\nBefore the final match of their season, the Eels had won only five of their 24 games and were in contention for the dreaded wooden spoon. During their final match, the Parramatta side emerged victorious over the [[Gold Coast Titans]] who were also direct contenders for last place. The wooden spoon was awarded to the Gold Coast side, finishing 16th on the NRL ladder, the Eels finishing in 14th position.\n\nThe 2012 season saw the retirement of Eels legends [[Luke Burt]] and [[Nathan Hindmarsh]]. It would also mark the first time since [[1972 NSWRFL season|1972]] that the team would succumb to the dreaded wooden spoon. The Eels struggled all year, securing just their first win of the season in Round 5 against defending premiers [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] before ending a six-game losing streak against the [[Cronulla Sharks]]. This horror start to the season, and a win rate of less than 25% over almost two seasons with the club, coach [[Stephen Kearney]] was forced to resign and Assistant Coach Brad Arthur would become caretaker. The team responded to this producing 3 wins from 4 games, including competition front-runners [[Melbourne Storm]] and [[Brisbane Broncos]] to give the fans some hope for the rest of the season. However this was short lived and following a 38-6 thumping to the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] in Round 25 of the Telstra Premiership were officially unable to avoid the wooden spoon.\n\nWhilst Parramatta's problems in 2012 were largely attributed to their relatively poor defence, numerous pundits blamed them on the recurring absences of star fullback [[Jarryd Hayne]]. Even whilst producing higher per-match statistics than any other fullback in the game (8 tries, 14 try-assists), Hayne only managed to complete 10 games from the season's 24, due to both injury and [[State of Origin series|State of Origin duty]].\n\nThroughout the season many of the Eels players came under scrutiny and were dropped to the [[NSW Cup]], including high-profile recruit [[Chris Sandow]], who at the time was touted as overweight and unfit,<ref name=\"overweight\">http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/sterling-slams-overweight-sandow/story-e6frexnr-1226322603592</ref> and veteran [[Luke Burt]]. As a result, players Matt Ryan, [[Jake Mullaney]] and [[Nathan Smith (rugby league born 1988)|Nathan Smith]] were called up to the top squad and have impressed in their roles of Second-Row, Fullback and Hooker respectively, making a suitable replacement for injured stars [[Jarryd Hayne]] and [[Matt Keating]].\n\nTowards the end of the season [[Ricky Stuart]] was announced as the new coach for the Parramatta Eels from 2013.<ref name=\"newcoach\">http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/nrl/ricky-stuart-to-coach-parramatta-eels-for-next-three-seasons/story-e6frfgbo-1226435192460</ref>\n\nAnother wooden spoon followed in 2013, with the club suffering their second biggest loss ever (4\u201364 to Melbourne in Round 24), and conceding three other scores of 50 or more. On 12 September 2013 it was announced Ricky Stuart would leave the Eels to take up the head coaching role at Canberra for the 2014 season.\n\nThe Eels determined to continue their rebuilding process in the off season after receiving the wooden spoon two years running. The club has done this by releasing 12 players and signing more in key areas to help them achieve success in the 2014 season.<ref>http://www.zerotackle.com/nrl/rugby-league/teams/parramatta-eels/</ref>\n\nParramatta also recruited a new coach in [[Brad Arthur]], formerly an Assistant Coach at the club, as Ricky Stuart reneged on the final two years of his contract. This was in order to return to his hometown of Canberra and coach the Raiders, the team he played for during his youth. Before the 2014 season started, Brad Arthur and Parramatta implemented a new recruitment policy and made strong signings including future NSW hooker [[Nathan Peats]], promising star [[Corey Norman]] and [[William Hopoate]] who was a 2011 premiership winner and NSW representative before leaving rugby league to join a two-year Mormon mission.<ref>https://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/five-new-eels-recruits-have-given-parramatta-fans-a-reason-to-believe-once-again/news-story/f6fd862d0cdc0912c62eed615d14f568</ref>\n\nThe 2014 season started off in great style as Parramatta won 4 out of their first 6 matches. Parramatta then went into their Easter Monday clash at Stadium Australia sitting 5th on the ladder but lost the match controversially 21-18 in front of 50,000 fans. In round 24 Parramatta were sitting 8th on the ladder and looked destined to play in the finals for the first time since 2009 and only needed to win one of their last two remaining games against sides lower than them on the table which were Canberra and Newcastle. Parramatta lost both matches and missed out on the finals series by two competition points.<ref>http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/teams/knights/parramatta-eels-finals-hopes-hit-by-a-secondhalf-blitz-from-newcastle-knights/news-story/ef379d470227dd9162766cf13a340f3b</ref><ref>https://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/rugby-league-match-centre/parramatta-eels-v-wests-tigers-20140417-36vfv.html</ref>\n\nThe 2015 season was a year to forget for Parramatta as they finished 12th on the table.

In addition to being fined $1 million, Parramatta also had its 2016 NRL Auckland Nines title revoked.[35][36]. On 19 July 2016 the Parramatta Leagues Club board was sacked by the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority, and an administrator appointed. This effectively also removed the Eels board as the seven directors on both boards were the same people. Max Donnelly, of Ferrier Hodgson was appointed as administrator.[37]. At the time of the 12-point deduction, Parramatta were sitting 5th on the ladder but then found themselves at 14th position. Their first match played after the points deduction was against South Sydney at Parramatta Stadium, Parramatta lost the match 22-20 in a close game. 2016 would also prove to be the final year that Parramatta would play at Parramatta Stadium as it was due to be demolished at seasons end to make way for a new 30,000 seat stadium. The final home game played at Parramatta Stadium was against The St George Dragons in front of 13,553 spectators. Parramatta went on to beat St George 30-18. Parramatta's final game of 2016 saw them travel to New Zealand to play The Auckland Warriors. Parramatta won the match 40-18 with Bevan French scoring 3 tries. At the end of the season, Parramatta finished in 14th place on the ladder but if they had not been stripped of the 12 competition points they would have played in the finals.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-13/souths-break-parramatta-hearts-as-eels-fans-rally-around-club/7414160</ref><ref>http://www.theroar.com.au/2016/09/04/new-zealand-warriors-vs-parramatta-eels-nrl-live-scores-blog-3/</ref><ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-29/bevan-french-parramatta-eels-st-george-illawarra-dragons-nrl/7796414</ref> The 2016 season was also difficult for Parramatta as to become salary cap compliant the club needed to release players such as [[Nathan Peats]] and [[Junior Paulo (rugby league, born 1993)|Junior Paulo]] to be able to play for points. Star recruit [[Kieran Foran]] who signed only months earlier on a $1 million a year contract also walked out on the club mid-season due to numerous personal problems and off field issues.<ref>https://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/reaction-to-kieran-foran-reportedly-quitting-the-nrl/news-story/5191e1414f841785ff645779385fcafa</ref>\n\nThe 2017 season saw a major turnaround for the club with Parramatta finishing fourth on the table and making the finals for the first time since 2009. Some of the highlights throughout the year were the club winning nine out of their final ten matches and defeating Brisbane twice including a 52-34 win at [[Suncorp Stadium]] and eventual premiers Melbourne.<ref>http://www.nrl.com/eels-2017-season-review/tabid/10874/newsid/112225/default.aspx</ref><ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-24/parramatta-eels-brisbane-broncos-nrl/8834608</ref> Parramatta then went on to play premiership favorites Melbourne in the first qualifying final, going into the second half Parramatta had stunned everyone by leading the match and it took Melbourne the last play of the game to hold on and win 18-16.<ref>https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrlfinals/live-nrl-finals-melbourne-storm-v-parramatta-eels-score-updates-result-blog/news-story/225e83d53f61bd57e9d3a3eebbb11ebf</ref> The following week, Parramatta played against North Queensland in the sudden death elimination final.  Parramatta led 10-6 at halftime but went on to lose the match 24-16 in what would be one of the biggest upsets of the season.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-16/nrl-north-queensland-cowboys-beat-parramatta-eels/8940644</ref>\n\nFor the 2018 season, Parramatta were predicted by many before the season to finish in the top 8 and challenge for the premiership. Those predictions were matched in the opening round of the season as Parramatta lead Penrith 14-0 early on but after a second half capitulation lost the game 24-14.  In Round 2, Parramatta were humiliated 54-0 by Manly at [[Brookvale Oval]]. Parramatta went on to lose the opening 6 games of the season before eventually winning their first game of the season defeating Manly 44-10 in Round 7.  In Round 8, Parramatta defeated Wests 24-22 to make it back to back victories for the club. The Eels then went on to lose the next 5 games in a row before eventually winning their third game of the season defeating North Queensland 20-14 in Darwin in which [[Jarryd Hayne]] returned from injury scoring two tries. The following weeks were filled with disappointment as the club came close to pulling off upset wins against top of the table St George only for the club to concede two tries in 5 minutes to lose 20-18 and South Sydney after leading 20-6 late into the game only for The Rabbitohs to score late tries and win 26-20. In Round 18, Parramatta lost 18-16 to Newcastle with The Eels being denied a last minute try after it was ruled winger [[Bevan French]] had put his foot over the sideline. The following week, Parramatta defeated arch rivals Canterbury 14-8 in what the media dubbed the \"Spoon Bowl\". There were hopes that Parramatta could avoid the wooden spoon as going into the second last game of the season the club sat above North Queensland on the table due to for and against. In what was the retiring Jonathan Thurston's final home game, both clubs needed a win to avoid the wooden spoon. North Queensland won the match 44-6. In the final game of the season, Parramatta were defeated 44-10 by the Sydney Roosters ensuring that the club finished last and claimed their 14th wooden spoon and the Roosters claiming the minor premiership. Before the match, the Roosters needed to defeat Parramatta by 27 points to overtake Melbourne and finish first on the table.<ref>https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/teams/eels/parramatta-eels-season-2018-review-peter-sterlings-biggest-fear-after-horror-campaign/news-story/14f79c1c637fa8d03bbfa6d6b63b55f1</ref><ref>https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/03/03/expert-predictions-for-nrl-top-eight-in-2018/</ref><ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-28/nrl-st-george-illawarra-edge-out-paramatta/9914596</ref>\n\nBefore the start of the [[2019 NRL season]], Parramatta were predicted by many to finish towards the bottom of the table or claim another wooden spoon.  The club started off the year with back to back victories over [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]] and arch rivals [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]].  In Round 6 of the [[2019 NRL season]], Parramatta played their first game at the new [[Western Sydney Stadium]] against the [[Wests Tigers]] and ran out 51-6 winners in front of a sold-out crowd.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-22/parramatta-eels-thrash-west-tigers-nrl/11034182/|title=Parramatta Eels thrash Wests Tigers 51-6 to christen new Parramatta Stadium|website=www.abc.net.au}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/11/22/fans-predictions-where-each-club-will-finish-in-2019/|title=Where each club will finish in 2019|website=NRL}}</ref>\n\nIn Round 9 against Melbourne, Parramatta suffered one of their worst ever defeats losing 64-10 at [[Suncorp Stadium]].  In the aftermath of the defeat, coach [[Brad Arthur]] and the players were placed under intense scrutiny but just a week after the loss, Arthur was given a two-year contract extension by the Parramatta board.  The club would then go on to lose against North Queensland and last placed Penrith in the coming weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2019/05/13/arthur-set-to-sign-new-contract-with-parramatta/|title=Arthur signs new contract with Parramatta|website=www.nrl.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/parramatta-eels-sign-coach-brad-arthur-to-new-nrl-deal/news-story/85369a404dc833f39d17678006eb8d93/|title=Parramatta Eels sign coach Brad Arthur to new NRL deal|website=www.foxsports.com.au}}</ref>\n\nBetween Round 12 and Round 22 of the 2019 season, Parramatta would go on to win 8 of their 10 games.  In Round 22 against the [[Gold Coast Titans]], Parramatta qualified for the 2019 finals series with a 36-12 victory at [[Cbus Super Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://7news.com.au/sport/rugby-league/moses-guides-eels-past-sorry-titans-in-nrl-c-403444/|title=Moses guides Eels past sorry Titans in NRL|website=7 News}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 2019 regular season, Parramatta finished 5th on the table and qualified for the finals.  In the elimination final against Brisbane, Parramatta won the match 58-0 at the new [[Western Sydney Stadium]].  The victory was the biggest finals win in history, eclipsing Newtown's 55-7 win over St George in 1944.  The match was also Parramatta's biggest win over Brisbane and Brisbane's worst ever loss since entering the competition in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-15/eels-make-history-with-58-point-finals-flogging-of-broncos/11505120/|title=Parramatta Eels eliminate Brisbane Broncos from the NRL Finals with a thumping 58-0 win|website=ABC}}</ref>\nThe following week against Melbourne in the elimination semi final, Parramatta were defeated 32-0 at [[AAMI Park]] which ended their season.  The loss against Melbourne was also the sixth time Parramatta had been defeated by Melbourne in a finals game since 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-21/nrl-live-semi-final-melbourne-storm-parramatta-eels/11527200/|title=Melbourne Storm crush Parramatta 32-0 in their semi-final to set up prelim against the Roosters|website=ABC}}</ref>\n\n==Club identity==\n\n===Name and emblem===\nLike most NSWRFL clubs founded before the 1980s, Parramatta was established with no official nickname or mascot. The only nickname Parramatta had ever been known by was the \"Fruitpickers\", a reference to the [[orchard]]s spread throughout the District and surrounding suburbs in the first half of the 20th century. As the competition and the clubs themselves became more focused on marketing in the 1970s, Parramatta adopted an official club mascot.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn the mid-1960s, [[Peter Frilingos]], a Sydney rugby league journalist, suggested that the club should be known as the \"[[Eel]]s\". This reasoning was based on the name of the Parramatta, anglicised from the Aboriginal dialect \"Barramattagal\" meaning \"place where the Eels dwell\". After this, the team was commonly called \"The Eels\" and it became an official nickname in the late 1970s.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nAs a result, the club's crest was changed in 1980, to a design featuring an eel. This crest remained, despite several changes in jersey design, until a new eel logo was introduced in 2000. In 2004, the club mascot featured on the crest reverted to an eel drawing similar to that featured on the original crest.\n\nParramatta has also used two separate crests based on [[City of Parramatta|Parramatta City]]'s crest. The first was a highly detailed scene showing a typical scene on the foreshore of the Parramatta River in the early days of European settlement.  It is an apparent tribute to the District's original occupants, the [[Darug people|Barramattagal]] tribe. In the foreground of the original crest, a male [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] is preparing to spear a fish while a woman in a canoe watches. In the background a paddle steamer is visible as well as the tree-lined banks of the Parramatta River. This crest was used by the Club until the 1970s when a more stylised version showing only the hunter, and the club's name on a scroll, was used.  This crest is still used in 2006 by the Parramatta District Junior Rugby League Football Club.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn 2009, the Parramatta Eels announced they were returning to their original 1980s club emblem in the 2011 season with the numbers 1947 added, this being the year of conception of the Eels.\n\n===Colours===\nWhen a Parramatta District Club was first proposed in 1936, the colours put forward to the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] by the District were emerald green and white, as these were the colours worn by the Western Districts President's Cup side and the Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club.<ref name=\"Cumberland\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?c=7-724-0-0-0&sID=3256|publisher=SportingPulse|title=60 Years of Parramatta Junior League|accessdate=6 September 2006}}</ref> However, when the proposal for a Parramatta club was next put to the NSWRL in 1946, the proposed colours for the new District side were blue and gold. These colours are said to have been selected based on the [[navy]], [[sky blue]] and gold colours used by [[Arthur Phillip High School]].<ref name=\"Parramatta\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://faxmentis.org/html/badge01.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030612094926/http://faxmentis.org/html/badge01.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 June 2003|publisher=Parramatta High School|title=Parramatta High School Badge|accessdate=18 September 2007}}</ref> These colours were also adopted by the [[Parramatta Two Blues|Parramatta District Rugby Union club]] in 1936 and also suggested in [[Parramatta City Council|Parramatta City Council's]] use of livery of blue and golden-orange in their crest. While this colour scheme has remained consistent throughout the history of the club, the shades of blue and gold have changed several times.\n\nThe original Parramatta jersey used in 1947 was of a blue design with a single yellow hoop around the middle of the jersey, extending across the sleeves. This original design was altered in 1949 to a design based on blue and gold hoops and remained unchanged until the 1970s when a jersey comprising stripes on a predominantly blue or gold background was adopted. Over the years, the design has changed gradually from one based on blue and gold stripes to a design incorporating different blue and gold designs around the fringes of a predominantly blue or gold jersey.\n\n==Stadium==\n{{details|Parramatta Stadium|ANZ Stadium|Western Sydney Stadium}}\n\nRugby league was played at Cumberland Oval from as early as 1909 by local clubs such as Parramatta Iona, Endeavours and the Western Districts representative side. When the club was admitted into the NSWRL Premiership in 1947, Cumberland Oval became its home ground. The club played its first match in the premiership on 12 April 1947 against [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]], being defeated 34\u201312 in front of 6,000 spectators. Cumberland Oval remained the home ground of the Parramatta Eels until 1981; the club played their last match there against the [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parramattastadium.com.au/article.phtml?artid=13|publisher=Parramatta Stadium|title=Cumberland|accessdate=14 July 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070812170033/http://www.parramattastadium.com.au/article.phtml?artid=13 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 12 August 2007}}</ref> Later that year, after the Parramatta Eels secured their first-ever Premiership trophy, Eels fans rallied at Cumberland Oval; during the celebrations, fans set fire to the ground's soon-to-be-demolished stand.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1985, the club used [[Belmore Oval]], home of the [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]], as a temporary home ground while a new facility [[Parramatta Stadium]] was built. The new stadium to be built on the site of Cumberland Oval was approved by the [[New South Wales]] Government for development in 1983 and the contract for the construction and design of the Stadium was put to competitive tender.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parramattastadium.com.au/content/view/90/55/ |publisher=Parramatta Stadium |title=Redevelopment |accessdate=24 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212131530/http://www.parramattastadium.com.au/content/view/90/55/ |archivedate=12 February 2010 }}</ref> After construction was completed in November 1985, the club played its first match at the new stadium on 16 March 1986 winning this opening game 36\u20136 against the [[St. George Dragons]].

The largest ever rugby league attendance at Parramatta Stadium was set on 6 July 1994 when 27,918 saw [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] defeat [[France national rugby league team|France]] 58-0 in a one-off [[1994 French rugby league Oceania tour|mid-season Test match]]. This was also the first test match held in Sydney since 1914 that wasn't played at either the [[Sydney Showground (Moore Park)|Agricultural Ground]], the SCG, or the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].\n\nParramatta Stadium was closed & demolished in 2017 with the [[Western Sydney Stadium]] being built in the same location. This stadium has a 30,000 seat capacity and was opened in 2019.  The first NRL match to be played at the new venue was in Round 6 2019 between Parramatta and [[Wests Tigers]].  Parramatta won the match 51-6.

The clubs also competed in several play-off finals matches during this period including a controversial drawn semi-final and subsequent replay in 1978. The famous rivalry between the clubs was also marked in an advertising [[jingle]] in a 1970s [[Tooheys]] television commercial.

The Eels were the Dragons' first-ever opponents as a joint-venture and the match was also the second ever held at [[Stadium Australia]] which would be the venue for the Olympic Games the following year. The Eels won 20-10 but the Dragons later moved on to make the Grand Final. The rivalry was not based on geographic location or tribalism as it was more based on both teams being in the finals hunt and pursuit of the premiership. In recent years there were some memorable, not to mention controversial matches, including:\n*Round 18, 2005: Dragons captain [[Trent Barrett]] and Eels hooker [[PJ Marsh]] instigated an all-in brawl as Barrett kicked down-field and Marsh attempted to smother his kick. Barrett took exception to the tackle and punched Marsh in the back of the head whilst Eels fullback [[Wade McKinnon]] fielded the kick and ran 80 metres to score. It turned out to be the turning point to the match as the Eels would go on to win 40-14.\n*Round 13, 2006: After 70 minutes without a score, Parramatta kicked a field goal to go 1-0 up before 8 unanswered points by the Dragons got them home 8-1 in one of the weirdest matches ever in NRL history. This match was played in driving rain at [[WIN Jubilee Oval]], [[Kogarah, New South Wales|Kogarah]].\n*Round 26, 2009: With the minor premiership seemingly all but lost, the Dragons thrashed the Eels 37-0 to actually finish on top of the NRL ladder from the Bulldogs who had lost 34-18 against the [[Wests Tigers]] in the second match played on the same night as the Dragons vs Eels match. The win by the Dragons ended Parramatta's late season surge and it saw the Eels finish eighth.\n*4th Qualifying Final, 2009: But in the qualifying final nine days later, the Eels turned the tables on the Dragons and beat the premiership favourites 25-12, a 50-point turnaround. The Eels would then go on to make the Grand Final (which they ultimately lost to the disgraced [[Melbourne Storm]]) whilst the Dragons would exit the finals altogether after losing to the [[Brisbane Broncos]] 24-10.\n*Round 13, 2011: After being thrashed 30-0 against the Dragons in a previous round the Eels began the match as underdogs. The Eels got out to a 14-0 lead only for it to be chased down by the Dragons. After 10 minutes of extra time and neither side being able to break the dead-lock, the game was declared a draw. However, Eels fullback Jarryd Hayne almost pulled off a miracle field goal from close to 60 metres out only for the kick to fade late and miss by half a metre.\n\n===Parramatta Eels vs Melbourne Storm rivalry===\n\nThe Eels have also developed a rivalry with the [[Melbourne Storm]]. After the Storm were found to have breached the salary cap from 2006-2010 the Eels felt robbed of a premiership, having gone down to the Storm in the 2009 Grand Final and wanted a chance at redemption. In 2010 the Eels got this chance.\n*Round 13, 2010: After Melbourne were found to have breached the salary cap over the previous five years and robbed several teams of premiership glory including the Parramatta Eels, the Eels got their chance at redemption. In front of a loud and proud home crowd who let Melbourne know what they'd done, the Eels beat the Storm, who still had their illegal roster but could no longer accrue points, 24-10. The game was marred by two fights which erupted. The first started after Eels fullback Jarryd Hayne and Storm fullback Billy Slater came head to head after Hayne had worked Slater over in a tackle. Hayne proceeded to head-butt Slater who responded with a punch and the 2 had to be separated. The second occurred again after Hayne and Slater came together. This time Slater was the aggressor and appeared to lead with an elbow when tackling Hayne. The Eels' Five-Eighth Daniel Mortimer was then put in the Sin-Bin for being the third man in. The Eels fired-up after this incident with prop Fuifui Moimoi charging onto the ball from the ensuing penalty and gaining 20 metres. The Eels kept their heads and won the game by a comfortable margin in the end.\n\nAs of 21 September 2019, Parramatta has never defeated Melbourne in a finals game having lost all six encounters in the 1999 preliminary final, 2006 qualifying final, 2007 preliminary final, The [[2009 NRL Grand Final]], 2017 qualifying final and the 2019 elimination semi final.<ref>https://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/melbourne-storm-survive-huge-scare-to-topple-parramatta-to-book-preliminary-final-berth-20170909-gye5jn.html</ref><ref>http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/Custom/Ny0tLS0tLS0tLS0tNS0tbi0tLS0tLS0t</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/21/storm-beat-eels-but-must-wait-on-captain-smiths-fate/|title=Storm beat Eels but must wait on captain Smith's fate|website=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n==Players==\n{{Main|List of Parramatta Eels players}}\n\n===Current squad===\n{{Parramatta Eels current squad}}\n\n===2020 Transfers===\n'''Gains'''\n* [[Regan Campbell-Gillard]] '''From''' [[Penrith Panthers]] \n* [[Ryan Matterson]] '''From''' [[West Tigers]]\n\n'''Losses'''\n* [[Manu Ma'u]] '''To''' [[Hull F.C.]]\n* [[Tepai Moeroa]] '''To''' Rugby Union\n* [[Tim Mannah]] Retired\n\n===Notable players===\nIn 2002 a team of the greatest Parramatta players, known as the ''Parramatta Legends'', were selected based on a public vote of fans.
