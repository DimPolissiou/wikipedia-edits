After Violet saves his life, he admits she's a better Woodchuck and forfeits the competition. Meanwhile, Scrooge finds a map to the treasure of famed adventurer Isabella Finch, but his attempts to find it are thwarted when the rest of the family decide to follow a strange bird instead. While he insists they are missing out, the others remind him that it is more meaningful to have your own adventure than to follow someone else's. The bird ultimately leads them to Finch's treasure: her lost adventure journal which contains a list of legendary treasures she was unable to find. The group resolve to hunt the treasures down, unaware that F.O.W.L. is spying on them and plotting to claim them first.\n|LineColor        = 960018\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 49\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Quack Pack!\n |RTitle          =\n |DirectedBy      = Tanner Johnson\n |WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Francisco Angones, Madison Bateman, Colleen Evanson, Christian Magalhaes & Bob Snow|t=Snow}}\n |Aux2            = Vince Aparo, Kristen Gish & Victoria Harris\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|4}}\n |ProdCode        = 303\n |Viewers         = 0.19<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-saturday-cable-originals-network-finals-4-4-20.html|title=Top 150 Saturday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 4.4.2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|author=Mitch Metcalf|date=April 7, 2020|access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = While on an adventure to find the Lost Lamp of Collie Baba, Donald wishes for a normal life, unaware he was next to the lamp. Fulfilling Donald's wish, [[List of DuckTales characters#Gene the Genie|Gene the Genie]] ([[Jaleel White]]) sends the family into a '90s sitcom called ''[[Quack Pack]]'' and erases their memories. While focusing on taking the perfect family photo, Huey suspects something is wrong after hearing Donald's normal voice and slowly manages to convince the others. Donald tries his best to hide his secret by maintaining the plot and reluctantly hiring his wacky neighbor, [[Goofy]] ([[Bill Farmer]]), to be the photographer. The family eventually finds Gene and demand he send them back home, but he tells them only Donald can reverse the wish since he made it. Donald refuses and storms off with Goofy. When the others try to escape, the wish fights back to maintain itself. Using his son [[Max Goof|Max]] as inspiration, Goofy helps Donald realize that different families can have their own idea of \"normal\" before helping him save his. Amidst the chaos, Goofy finds the lamp and Donald uses his second wish to undo his first.

After Scrooge locks the boys in a room for making fun of him, the triplets come across Webby Vanderquack, who befriends them and shows off a collection of relics and artifacts that Scrooge and Donald collected during their previous adventures, only to accidentally release various ancient evils housed in them. After the kids help him contain them, Scrooge finds his thirst for adventure rekindled and decides to take them all, along with his driver/pilot Launchpad McQuack, to find the Lost Jewel of [[Atlantis]]. However, the group are unaware that Scrooge's rival, [[Flintheart Glomgold]] ([[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]]), seeks the jewel as well and has hired Donald as his sailor; leading to a race against time to claim the relic. During their quest, Dewey argues with Scrooge about locking him and his brothers up and not wanting them around, though they later reconcile. In the end, Scrooge gets the Jewel, and Donald and the boys move into McDuck Manor after an accident costs them their houseboat.

However, it fails and Lunaris reveals his plan to make the Earth revolve around the Moon using a planetary engine. Elsewhere, Della flies the kids to safety, disguising it as a recruitment drive, but they're attacked and crash on an island, where they find Donald. Della tries to sway the others from leaving, until Louie helps her see that it's okay to have bad experiences because there will be good ones. Gladstone and Fethry soon find them and take them back to Duckburg on Mitzi. Meanwhile, Scrooge reluctantly teams up with Glomgold and defeats Lunaris with a dumb, but successful plan. Lunaris flees in his ship and attempts to blow up the Earth, leading to a space battle against the Ducks. In the end, Penumbra arrives and damages Lunaris' ship, leaving him stranded in space. Afterwards, the Moonlanders stop the invasion and the family celebrates, unaware of F.O.W.L watching them.\n |LineColor       = F89E32\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 3 (2020) ===\n{{Episode table|background=#960018|overall=|season=|title=|director=|writer=|aux2=|aux2T=Storyboard by|airdate=|prodcode=|prodcodeR=<ref name=WDTV>{{cite web|url=https://www.wdtvpress.com/disneyxd/shows/ducktales/episodes/|title=Disney XD - DuckTales: Episode Info|website=Walt Disney Television Press|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref>|viewers=|country=U.S.|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 48\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!\n |RTitle          = \n |DirectedBy      = Matthew Humphreys\n |WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Francisco Angones, Madison Bateman, Colleen Evanson, Christian Magalhaes & Bob Snow|t=Angones & Bateman}}\n |Aux2            = Stephanie Gonzaga, Krystal Ureta & Brandon Warren\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|4}}\n |ProdCode        =  304\n |Viewers         = 0.19<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-saturday-cable-originals-network-finals-4-4-20.html|title=Top 150 Saturday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 4.4.2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|author=Mitch Metcalf|date=April 7, 2020|access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = As part of their Junior Woodchuck graduation, Huey and Violet must compete in a challenge to earn the title of Senior Woodchuck. Panicked by the possibility of losing, Huey hallucinates a talking Junior Woodchuck guidebook ([[Stephen Root]]) to aid him and ignores Violet when she is endangered. After Violet saves his life, he admits she's a better Woodchuck and forfeits the competition. Meanwhile, Scrooge finds a map to the treasure of famed adventurer Isabella Finch, but his attempts to find it are thwarted when the rest of the family decide to follow a strange bird instead. While he insists they are missing out, the others remind him that it is more meaningful to have your own adventure than to follow someone else's. The bird ultimately leads them to Finch's treasure: her lost adventure journal which contains a list of legendary treasures she was unable to find.

Fulfilling Donald's wish, [[List of DuckTales characters#Gene the Genie|Gene the Genie]] ([[Jaleel White]]) sends the family into a '90s sitcom called ''[[Quack Pack]]'' and erases their memories. While focusing on taking the perfect family photo, Huey suspects something is wrong after hearing Donald's normal voice and slowly manages to convince the others. Donald tries his best to hide his secret by maintaining the plot and reluctantly hiring his wacky neighbor, [[Goofy]] ([[Bill Farmer]]), to be the photographer. The family eventually finds Gene and demand he send them back home, but he tells them only Donald can reverse the wish since he made it. Donald refuses and storms off with Goofy. When the others try to escape, the wish fights back to maintain itself. Using his son [[Max Goof|Max]] as inspiration, Goofy helps Donald realize that different families can have their own idea of \"normal\" before helping him save his. Amidst the chaos, Goofy finds the lamp and Donald uses his second wish to undo his first.

Once they get to the concert they find the same blue van and Val throws a small firecracker into it causing the three boys inside to climb out. Ivan owns the van and his buddy Kovacs and Mark who is said to be leaving for LA soon are interested in the girls. After the show Alexis invites the boys to her fathers empty house which turns out to be a mansion. Bev and Mark seem to like each other yet Bev seems to almost avoid him. The girls drug the boys drinks and reveal they are going to murder them and make it appear as a Satanic Cult killing. The church the girls are a part of has murdered eighteen other people in the same way in order to create fear and send more people to their religion. Alexis is shown to be the most insane and stabs Ivan after he criticizes her religious belief in Christ and he bleeds to death. Mark and Kovacs briefly escape hiding in a pantry when Alexis\u2019s soon to be ex step mother Susan comes home to retrieve a passport. She reveals she\u2019d called the police because she\u2019d seen the strange blue van and lights on. Susan then discovers Ivan\u2019s body and Alexis stabs her to death. The Police Officer arrives and is suspicious so Alexis runs from him and into the house where he chases her, gun raised. The Officer finds the injured Kovacs and Mark who pleads for help but Val kills him from behind. Alexis and Val fight over the gun and Bev appears threatening her friends with a chain saw. Val and Alexis tell Bev they are doing the Lords work but Bev declares she will let Mark and Kovacs go. Alexis\u2019s father (Johnny Knoxville) is the Pastor of the church Alexis praises. Bev tries to help Mark and Kovacs, the latter who is bleeding out and won\u2019t last much longer unless he gets to a hospital. Alexis has the car keys so Mark goes after her to retrieve them. When Kovacs sees car lights he goes outside struggling to walk to find Alexis\u2019s father the Pastor. Mark gets the keys but Alexis attacks him and they fight. Val attacks Bev and tries to kill her but Bev lights Val on fire (her hair being full of hair spray). The Pastor attacks Kovacs off screen and he makes it back into the house where Bev finds him. Just before he dies he tells her to \u201csave Mark.\u201d The Pastor shoots Mark as he is strangling Alexis. He then berates his daughter for doing a terrible job at murdering and covering it up. He tells Alexis they have to make some sacrifices to get out of the predicament she has caused. He tells her she is reckless and careless. He attempts to kill Alexis when Bev comes up and knocks him out. Alexis is over the top crazy and Bev throws her out of a window in a dramatic and exaggerated fashion. Mark is still alive and Bev and him drive away together only to reveal Alexis in the road. Off camera Bev runs Alexis over. The Pastor is still alive and makes himself into a victim. Bev and Mark leave town together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alexandra Daddario]] as Alexis Butler \n* [[Keean Johnson]] as Mark  \n* [[Maddie Hasson]] as Val  \n* [[Logan Miller]] as Kovacs \n* [[Amy Forsyth]] as Beverly \n* [[Austin Swift]] as Ivan\n* [[Allison McAtee]] as Susan  \n* [[Johnny Knoxville]] as Pastor John Henry Butler \n\n==Reception==\nThe film currently holds an approval rating of 67% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10.

Alexis is shown to be the most insane and stabs Ivan after he criticizes her religious belief in Christ and he bleeds to death. Mark and Kovacs briefly escape hiding in a pantry when Alexis\u2019s soon to be ex step mother Susan comes home to retrieve a passport. She reveals she\u2019d called the police because she\u2019d seen the strange blue van and lights on. Susan then discovers Ivan\u2019s body and Alexis stabs her to death. The Police Officer arrives and is suspicious so Alexis runs from him and into the house where he chases her, gun raised. The Officer finds the injured Kovacs and Mark who pleads for help but Val kills him from behind. Alexis and Val fight over the gun and Bev appears threatening her friends with a chain saw. Val and Alexis tell Bev they are doing the Lords work but Bev declares she will let Mark and Kovacs go. Alexis\u2019s father (Johnny Knoxville) is the Pastor of the church Alexis praises. Bev tries to help Mark and Kovacs, the latter who is bleeding out and won\u2019t last much longer unless he gets to a hospital. Alexis has the car keys so Mark goes after her to retrieve them. When Kovacs sees car lights he goes outside struggling to walk to find Alexis\u2019s father the Pastor. Mark gets the keys but Alexis attacks him and they fight. Val attacks Bev and tries to kill her but Bev lights Val on fire (her hair being full of hair spray). The Pastor attacks Kovacs off screen and he makes it back into the house where Bev finds him. Just before he dies he tells her to \u201csave Mark.\u201d The Pastor shoots Mark as he is strangling Alexis. He then berates his daughter for doing a terrible job at murdering and covering it up. He tells Alexis they have to make some sacrifices to get out of the predicament she has caused. He tells her she is reckless and careless. He attempts to kill Alexis when Bev comes up and knocks him out. Alexis is over the top crazy and Bev throws her out of a window in a dramatic and exaggerated fashion. Mark is still alive and Bev and him drive away together only to reveal Alexis in the road. Off camera Bev runs Alexis over. The Pastor is still alive and makes himself into a victim. Bev and Mark leave town together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alexandra Daddario]] as Alexis\n* [[Keean Johnson]] as Mark  \n* [[Maddie Hasson]] as Val  \n* [[Logan Miller]] as Kovacs \n* [[Amy Forsyth]] as Beverly \n* [[Austin Swift]] as Ivan\n* [[Allison McAtee]] as Susan  \n* [[Johnny Knoxville]] as Pastor John Henry Butler \n\n==Reception==\nThe film currently holds an approval rating of 67% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10.

It has since moved away from Red Hat's distribution and has become a completely separate distribution in its own right. Mandriva now includes a number of original tools, mostly to ease system configuration. Mandriva Linux is the brainchild of [[Ga\u00ebl Duval]], who wanted to focus on ease of use for new users.\n\nThis goal was met as Mandrake Linux gained a reputation as \"one of the easiest to install and user-friendly Linux distributions\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/52240-review-mandrake-linux-90|title=Review: Mandrake Linux 9.0|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528010342/http://www.extremetech.com/computing/52240-review-mandrake-linux-90|archivedate=2014-05-28}}</ref> At this time [[Internet Explorer]] held a dominant share of the web browser market, and [[Microsoft]] a near monopoly in operating systems. Web browsers for Linux were limited to [[Mozilla]], followed by a variety of poorly performing Linux-specific browsers such as [[Konqueror]] or [[Galeon]]. Mandrake Linux earned praise as a Linux distribution that users could use all the time, without [[dual booting]] into Windows for compatibility with web sites or software unavailable under Linux.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mozillaquest.com/Linux02/Mandrake_Linux_9-0_FirstLook_story-01.html |title=Mandrake Linux 9.0, Desktop Magic You Can Use: A First Look |quote=Many people have multi-boot boxes with both the Linux and Microsoft Windows operating systems installed on them.

From version 8.1 to 9.2 the distribution name was reversed and called Mandrake Linux.\n\nIn February 2004, MandrakeSoft lost a court case against [[Hearst Corporation]], owners of [[King Features Syndicate]]. Hearst contended that MandrakeSoft infringed upon King Features' [[trademark]]ed character [[Mandrake the Magician]]. As a precaution, MandrakeSoft renamed its products by removing the space between the brand name and the product name and changing the first letter of the product name to lower case, thus creating one word. Starting from version 10.0, Mandrake Linux became known as mandrakelinux, and its logo changed accordingly. Similarly, MandrakeMove (a [[Live CD]] version) became Mandrakemove.\n\nIn April 2005, Mandrakesoft announced the corporate acquisition of [[Conectiva]], a Brazilian-based company that produced a Linux distribution for Portuguese-speaking (Brazil) and Spanish-speaking Latin America. As a result of this acquisition and the legal dispute with Hearst Corporation, Mandrakesoft announced that the company was changing its name to Mandriva, and that their Linux distribution ''Mandrake Linux'' would henceforward be known as Mandriva Linux.<ref>{{cite web |title=Behind the New Mandriva |url=http://linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reports/5811/1/ |publisher=linuxplanet.com |accessdate=2008-03-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601100919/http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reports/5811/1/ |archivedate=2008-06-01 }}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n===Installation, control and administration===\nMandriva Linux contained the [[drakconf|Mandriva Control Center]], which eases configuration of some settings. It has many programs known as Drakes or Draks, collectively named drakxtools, to configure many different settings. Examples include MouseDrake to set up a mouse, DiskDrake to set up disk partitions and drakconnect to set up a network connection. They are written using [[GTK+]] and [[Perl]], and most of them can run in both graphical and text mode using the [[ncurses]] interface.\n\n===Desktops===\nMandriva Linux 2011 was released only with [[KDE Plasma Desktop]], whereas other desktop environments were available but not officially supported.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.openmandriva.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=2011.0_Tour|title=2011.0 Tour - Mandriva Community Wiki|last=|first=|date=|website=archive.openmandriva.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-20|quote=Starting with Mandriva Desktop 2011 only KDE Plasma Desktop is officially supported.

It is similar to [[APT (software)|apt]] from [[Debian]] & [[Ubuntu (software)|Ubuntu]], [[pacman (Arch Linux)|pacman]] from Arch Linux, [[yum (software)|yum]] or [[DNF (software)|dnf]] from [[Fedora (software)|Fedora]] in that it allows seamless installation of a given software package by automatically installing the other packages needed. It is also media-transparent due to its ability to retrieve packages from various media, including network/Internet, CD/DVD and local disk. Urpmi also has an easy-to-use graphical front-end called [[rpmdrake]], which is integrated into the Mandriva Control Center.\n\n===Live USB===\nA [[Live USB]] of Mandriva Linux can be created manually or with [[UNetbootin]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UNetbootin \u2013 Universal Netboot In|url=http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/|publisher=[[SourceForge.net]]|accessdate=2013-03-01|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201042353/http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/|archivedate=2012-12-01}}.

Each edition is derived from the same master tree, most of which is available on the public mirrors: all free / open source software, and all non-free software which is under a license that allows unrestricted distribution to the general public, is available from the public mirrors. Only commercial software under a license that does not allow unrestricted distribution to the general public (but for which Mandriva has negotiated an agreement to distribute it with paid copies) is not available from public mirrors.\n\n===Mandriva Linux Free===\nMandriva Linux Free was a 'traditional' distribution (i.e. one that comes with a dedicated installer,<ref>{{cite web |title=Free Software / Open Source Software |url=http://www.mandriva.com/en/community/free-software |publisher=mandriva.com |accessdate=2008-03-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017023214/http://www.mandriva.com/en/community/free-software |archivedate=2007-10-17 }}</ref> to install the distribution to the computer before it is run). It was 'free' [[gratis versus libre|in both senses]]: it consists entirely of [[free software|free]] and [[open-source software]], and it was made available for public download at no charge. It was usually available in CD (three or four discs) and DVD editions for [[x86]] 32- and 64-bit CPU architectures. It was aimed at users to whom software freedom is important, and also at users who prefer a traditional installer to the installable live CD system used by One. The package selection was tailored towards regular desktop use. It consisted of a subset of packages from the 'main' and 'contrib' sections of the master tree. Mandriva Linux Free was phased in 2011 in favor of a single edition approach with Mandriva Desktop 2011.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Mandriva Linux One===\n[[Image:MandrivaOne 2008.1.jpg|thumb|100|Mandriva Linux One's Live CD]]\nMandriva Linux One was a free to download hybrid distribution, being both a [[Live CD]] and an installer (with an installation wizard that includes disk partitioning tools).\n\nSeveral Mandriva Linux One versions were provided for each Mandriva Linux release preceding Mandriva 2008. Users could choose between different languages, select either the KDE or GNOME desktops and include or exclude non-free software. The default version included the KDE desktop with non-free software included. The One images consist of a subset of packages from the 'main', 'contrib' and 'non-free' sections of the master tree, with the documentation files stripped from the packages to save space.\n\nMandriva Linux One 2008 has a smaller range of versions. There are KDE and GNOME versions with the default set of languages. There are also two KDE versions with alternative sets of languages. All versions include non-free software.\n\n===Mandriva Linux Powerpack===\nMandriva Linux Powerpack was a 'traditional' distribution (in other words, one that comes with a dedicated installer, DrakX, which is first used to install the distribution to the hard disk of the computer before it is run). It is the main commercial edition of Mandriva Linux, and as such, requires payment for its use. It contains several non-free packages intended to add value for the end user, including non-free drivers like the NVIDIA and ATI graphics card drivers, non-free firmware for wireless chips and modems, some [[web browser|browser]] plugins such as Java and Flash, and some full applications such as [[Cedega (software)|Cedega]], Adobe Reader and RealPlayer. It was sold directly from the Mandriva Store website and through authorized resellers. It was also made available via a subscription service, which allowed unlimited downloads of Powerpack editions for the last few Mandriva releases for a set yearly fee. It consisted of a subset of packages from the 'main', 'contrib', 'non-free' and 'restricted' sections of the master tree.\n\nIn Mandriva Linux 2008, the Discovery and Powerpack+ editions have been merged into Powerpack, which will become Mandriva's only commercial offering. Users will be able to choose between a novice-friendly Discovery-like setup or an installation process and desktop aimed at power users.\n\n===Mandriva Linux Discovery===\nMandriva Linux Discovery was a commercial distribution aimed at first-time and novice Linux users. It was sold via the Mandriva Store website and authorized resellers, or could be downloaded by some subscribers to the Mandriva Club. Mandriva Linux 2008 does not include a Discovery edition, having added optional novice-friendly features to the Powerpack edition.\n\nIn releases prior to Mandriva Linux 2007, Discovery was a 'traditional' distribution built on the DrakX installer. In Mandriva Linux 2007 and 2007 Spring, Discovery is a hybrid [[Live CD|\"Live DVD\"]] which can be booted without installation or installed to hard disk in the traditional manner.\n\nDiscovery was a DVD rather than a CD, allowing all languages to be provided on one disc. It consisted of a subset of packages from the 'main', 'contrib', 'non-free' and 'non-free-restricted' sections of the master tree. The package selection was tailored towards novice desktop users. A theme chosen to be appealing to novice users was used, and the 'simplified' menu layout in which applications are described rather than named and not all applications are included was the default (for all other editions, the default menu layout was the 'traditional' layout, where all graphical applications installed on the system were included and were listed by name).\n\n===Mandriva Linux Powerpack+===\nMandriva Linux Powerpack+ was a version of Powerpack with additional packages, mostly commercial software. Like Powerpack, it was sold directly from the Mandriva Store website and through authorized resellers; it was also a free download for Mandriva Club members of the Gold level and above. Powerpack+ was aimed at SOHO (small office / home office) users, with the expectation that it could be used to run a small home or office server machine as well as desktop and development workstations. The package selection was tailored with this in mind, including a wide range of server packages. It consisted of a subset of packages from the 'main', 'contrib', 'non-free' and 'restricted' sections of the master tree.\n\nMandriva 2008 no longer includes a Powerpack+ edition; instead, the Powerpack edition includes all the available packages.\n\n==Derivatives==\nDerivatives are distributions that are based on Mandriva Linux, some by Mandriva itself, others by independent projects. Some maintain compatibility with Mandriva Linux, so that installing a Mandriva Linux [[.rpm]] also works on the offspring.\n* [[OpenMandriva Lx]] - a continuation of Mandriva by the community\n* [[Mageia]] - a fork of Mandriva by the former laid off developers\n* [[PCLinuxOS]] - initially derived from Mandrake\n* [[ROSA Linux]] - a fork of Mandriva by the former laid off developers\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons}}\n* {{DistroWatch|mandriva|NAME=Mandriva Linux}}\n{{Linux distributions}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:Discontinued Linux distributions]]\n[[Category:KDE]]\n[[Category:Mandriva Linux]]\n[[Category:RPM-based Linux distributions]]\n[[Category:X86-64 Linux distributions]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox OS\n| name                   = Mandriva Linux\n| logo                   = [[File:Mandriva-Logo.svg|200px]]\n| screenshot             = Mandriva Desktop-2011-default-view.png\n| caption                = Mandriva Linux 2011\n| developer              = [[Mandriva]]\n| family                 = [[Unix-like]]\n| working state = Discontinued\n| released               = {{Start date and age|df=yes|1998|07|23}}\n| language               = Multilingual\n| userland               = [[GNU Core Utilities|GNU]]\n| ui                     = [[KDE Plasma Desktop]] (official)\n| license                = Various [[free software]] licenses, plus proprietary [[binary blob]]s.<ref name=\"kernelblobs\" />\n| website                = {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523021945/http://www.mandriva.com/en/products-services/mbs/technical-specifications/ |date=23 May 2015 }}\n| source_model           = [[open source software|Open source]] (with exceptions)<ref name=\"kernelblobs\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html#Mandriva |title=Explaining Why We Don't Endorse Other Systems |publisher=the [[Free Software Foundation]] |accessdate=2011-03-03 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424061731/http://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html#Mandriva |archivedate=2011-04-24 }}</ref>\n| package_manager        = [[urpmi]] ([[command-line]] frontend)<br>[[rpmdrake]] ([[GTK]] frontend)<br>[[.rpm]] (package format)\n| updatemodel            = [[Long-term support]]\n| latest_release_version = 2011\n| latest_release_date    = {{Start date and age|df=yes|2011|08|28}}\n| kernel_type            = [[Monolithic kernel|Monolithic]] ([[Linux kernel|Linux]])\n| supported_platforms    = [[amd64]], [[i686]], [[i586]], [[i486]], [[i386]], [[HAL SPARC64|sparc64]], [[ppc64]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[ARM architecture|arm]], [[ia64]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]\n}}\n'''Mandriva Linux''' (a fusion of the French distribution '''Mandrake Linux''' and the Brazilian distribution '''Conectiva Linux''') is a discontinued [[Linux distribution]] developed by [[Mandriva]] S.A.\n\nEach release lifetime was 18 months for base updates ([[Linux (kernel)|Linux]], [[system software]], etc.) and 12 months for desktop updates ([[window managers]], [[desktop environments]], [[web browsers]], etc.).

It has since moved away from Red Hat's distribution and has become a completely separate distribution in its own right. Mandriva now includes a number of original tools, mostly to ease system configuration. Mandriva Linux is the brainchild of [[Ga\u00ebl Duval]], who wanted to focus on ease of use for new users.\n\nThis goal was met as Mandrake Linux gained a reputation as \"one of the easiest to install and user-friendly Linux distributions\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/52240-review-mandrake-linux-90|title=Review: Mandrake Linux 9.0|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528010342/http://www.extremetech.com/computing/52240-review-mandrake-linux-90|archivedate=2014-05-28}}</ref> At this time [[Internet Explorer]] held a dominant share of the web browser market, and [[Microsoft]] a near monopoly in operating systems. Web browsers for Linux were limited to [[Mozilla]], followed by a variety of poorly performing Linux-specific browsers such as [[Konqueror]] or [[Galeon]]. Mandrake Linux earned praise as a Linux distribution that users could use all the time, without [[dual booting]] into Windows for compatibility with web sites or software unavailable under Linux.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mozillaquest.com/Linux02/Mandrake_Linux_9-0_FirstLook_story-01.html |title=Mandrake Linux 9.0, Desktop Magic You Can Use: A First Look |quote=Many people have multi-boot boxes with both the Linux and Microsoft Windows operating systems installed on them.

From version 8.1 to 9.2 the distribution name was reversed and called Mandrake Linux.\n\nIn February 2004, MandrakeSoft lost a court case against [[Hearst Corporation]], owners of [[King Features Syndicate]]. Hearst contended that MandrakeSoft infringed upon King Features' [[trademark]]ed character [[Mandrake the Magician]]. As a precaution, MandrakeSoft renamed its products by removing the space between the brand name and the product name and changing the first letter of the product name to lower case, thus creating one word. Starting from version 10.0, Mandrake Linux became known as mandrakelinux, and its logo changed accordingly. Similarly, MandrakeMove (a [[Live CD]] version) became Mandrakemove.\n\nIn April 2005, Mandrakesoft announced the corporate acquisition of [[Conectiva]], a Brazilian-based company that produced a Linux distribution for Portuguese-speaking (Brazil) and Spanish-speaking Latin America. As a result of this acquisition and the legal dispute with Hearst Corporation, Mandrakesoft announced that the company was changing its name to Mandriva, and that their Linux distribution ''Mandrake Linux'' would henceforward be known as Mandriva Linux.<ref>{{cite web |title=Behind the New Mandriva |url=http://linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reports/5811/1/ |publisher=linuxplanet.com |accessdate=2008-03-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601100919/http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reports/5811/1/ |archivedate=2008-06-01 }}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n===Installation, control and administration===\nMandriva Linux contained the [[drakconf|Mandriva Control Center]], which eases configuration of some settings. It has many programs known as Drakes or Draks, collectively named drakxtools, to configure many different settings. Examples include MouseDrake to set up a mouse, DiskDrake to set up disk partitions and drakconnect to set up a network connection. They are written using [[GTK+]] and [[Perl]], and most of them can run in both graphical and text mode using the [[ncurses]] interface.\n\n===Desktops===\nMandriva Linux 2011 was released only with [[KDE Plasma Desktop]], whereas other desktop environments were available but not officially supported.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.openmandriva.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=2011.0_Tour|title=2011.0 Tour - Mandriva Community Wiki|last=|first=|date=|website=archive.openmandriva.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-20|quote=Starting with Mandriva Desktop 2011 only KDE Plasma Desktop is officially supported.

It is similar to [[APT (software)|apt]] from [[Debian]] & [[Ubuntu (software)|Ubuntu]], [[pacman (Arch Linux)|pacman]] from Arch Linux, [[yum (software)|yum]] or [[DNF (software)|dnf]] from [[Fedora (software)|Fedora]] in that it allows seamless installation of a given software package by automatically installing the other packages needed. It is also media-transparent due to its ability to retrieve packages from various media, including network/Internet, CD/DVD and local disk. Urpmi also has an easy-to-use graphical front-end called [[rpmdrake]], which is integrated into the Mandriva Control Center.\n\n===Live USB===\nA [[Live USB]] of Mandriva Linux can be created manually or with [[UNetbootin]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UNetbootin \u2013 Universal Netboot In|url=http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/|publisher=[[SourceForge.net]]|accessdate=2013-03-01|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201042353/http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/|archivedate=2012-12-01}}.

Each edition is derived from the same master tree, most of which is available on the public mirrors: all free / open source software, and all non-free software which is under a license that allows unrestricted distribution to the general public, is available from the public mirrors. Only commercial software under a license that does not allow unrestricted distribution to the general public (but for which Mandriva has negotiated an agreement to distribute it with paid copies) is not available from public mirrors.\n\n===Mandriva Linux Free===\nMandriva Linux Free was a 'traditional' distribution (i.e. one that comes with a dedicated installer,<ref>{{cite web |title=Free Software / Open Source Software |url=http://www.mandriva.com/en/community/free-software |publisher=mandriva.com |accessdate=2008-03-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017023214/http://www.mandriva.com/en/community/free-software |archivedate=2007-10-17 }}</ref> to install the distribution to the computer before it is run). It was 'free' [[gratis versus libre|in both senses]]: it consists entirely of [[free software|free]] and [[open-source software]], and it was made available for public download at no charge. It was usually available in CD (three or four discs) and DVD editions for [[x86]] 32- and 64-bit CPU architectures. It was aimed at users to whom software freedom is important, and also at users who prefer a traditional installer to the installable live CD system used by One. The package selection was tailored towards regular desktop use. It consisted of a subset of packages from the 'main' and 'contrib' sections of the master tree. Mandriva Linux Free was phased in 2011 in favor of a single edition approach with Mandriva Desktop 2011.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Mandriva Linux One===\n[[Image:MandrivaOne 2008.1.jpg|thumb|100|Mandriva Linux One's Live CD]]\nMandriva Linux One was a free to download hybrid distribution, being both a [[Live CD]] and an installer (with an installation wizard that includes disk partitioning tools).\n\nSeveral Mandriva Linux One versions were provided for each Mandriva Linux release preceding Mandriva 2008. Users could choose between different languages, select either the KDE or GNOME desktops and include or exclude non-free software. The default version included the KDE desktop with non-free software included. The One images consist of a subset of packages from the 'main', 'contrib' and 'non-free' sections of the master tree, with the documentation files stripped from the packages to save space.\n\nMandriva Linux One 2008 has a smaller range of versions. There are KDE and GNOME versions with the default set of languages. There are also two KDE versions with alternative sets of languages. All versions include non-free software.\n\n===Mandriva Linux Powerpack===\nMandriva Linux Powerpack was a 'traditional' distribution (in other words, one that comes with a dedicated installer, DrakX, which is first used to install the distribution to the hard disk of the computer before it is run). It is the main commercial edition of Mandriva Linux, and as such, requires payment for its use. It contains several non-free packages intended to add value for the end user, including non-free drivers like the NVIDIA and ATI graphics card drivers, non-free firmware for wireless chips and modems, some [[web browser|browser]] plugins such as Java and Flash, and some full applications such as [[Cedega (software)|Cedega]], Adobe Reader and RealPlayer. It was sold directly from the Mandriva Store website and through authorized resellers. It was also made available via a subscription service, which allowed unlimited downloads of Powerpack editions for the last few Mandriva releases for a set yearly fee. It consisted of a subset of packages from the 'main', 'contrib', 'non-free' and 'restricted' sections of the master tree.\n\nIn Mandriva Linux 2008, the Discovery and Powerpack+ editions have been merged into Powerpack, which will become Mandriva's only commercial offering. Users will be able to choose between a novice-friendly Discovery-like setup or an installation process and desktop aimed at power users.\n\n===Mandriva Linux Discovery===\nMandriva Linux Discovery was a commercial distribution aimed at first-time and novice Linux users. It was sold via the Mandriva Store website and authorized resellers, or could be downloaded by some subscribers to the Mandriva Club. Mandriva Linux 2008 does not include a Discovery edition, having added optional novice-friendly features to the Powerpack edition.\n\nIn releases prior to Mandriva Linux 2007, Discovery was a 'traditional' distribution built on the DrakX installer. In Mandriva Linux 2007 and 2007 Spring, Discovery is a hybrid [[Live CD|\"Live DVD\"]] which can be booted without installation or installed to hard disk in the traditional manner.\n\nDiscovery was a DVD rather than a CD, allowing all languages to be provided on one disc. It consisted of a subset of packages from the 'main', 'contrib', 'non-free' and 'non-free-restricted' sections of the master tree. The package selection was tailored towards novice desktop users. A theme chosen to be appealing to novice users was used, and the 'simplified' menu layout in which applications are described rather than named and not all applications are included was the default (for all other editions, the default menu layout was the 'traditional' layout, where all graphical applications installed on the system were included and were listed by name).\n\n===Mandriva Linux Powerpack+===\nMandriva Linux Powerpack+ was a version of Powerpack with additional packages, mostly commercial software. Like Powerpack, it was sold directly from the Mandriva Store website and through authorized resellers; it was also a free download for Mandriva Club members of the Gold level and above. Powerpack+ was aimed at SOHO (small office / home office) users, with the expectation that it could be used to run a small home or office server machine as well as desktop and development workstations. The package selection was tailored with this in mind, including a wide range of server packages. It consisted of a subset of packages from the 'main', 'contrib', 'non-free' and 'restricted' sections of the master tree.\n\nMandriva 2008 no longer includes a Powerpack+ edition; instead, the Powerpack edition includes all the available packages.\n\n==Derivatives==\nDerivatives are distributions that are based on Mandriva Linux, some by Mandriva itself, others by independent projects. Some maintain compatibility with Mandriva Linux, so that installing a Mandriva Linux [[.rpm]] also works on the offspring.\n* [[OpenMandriva Lx]] - a continuation of Mandriva by the community\n* [[Mageia]] - a fork of Mandriva by the former laid off developers\n* [[PCLinuxOS]] - initially derived from Mandrake\n* [[ROSA Linux]] - a fork of Mandriva by the former laid off developers\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons}}\n* {{DistroWatch|mandriva|NAME=Mandriva Linux}}\n{{Linux distributions}}\n\n[[Category:Discontinued Linux distributions]]\n[[Category:KDE]]\n[[Category:Mandriva Linux]]\n[[Category:RPM-based Linux distributions]]\n[[Category:X86-64 Linux distributions]]\n", "name_user": "MathXplore", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandriva_Linux"}
