The team was founded by the Sports Authority of Thailand in collaboration with the Football Association of Thailand.\n\nIn 2008 they were promoted from the [[Regional League Division 2]] to take them back to the [[Thai Division 1 League|Thai First Division]].\n\n===Promotion to the Thai Premier League===\nSisaket were promoted to the Premier league in 2010 after finishing third in the [[2009 Thai Division 1 League]].\n\n===Name change and relocation===\nIn 2012 the club relocated to [[Ubon Ratchathani Province]] after the local Sisaket government decided to back the newly formed [[Sisaket United F.C.]]. The club also changed their name to '''Esan United'''. Esan United finished the season in 6th, a record for the club.\n\n===Return to Sisaket===\nIn 2013 the [[Football Association of Thailand]] found Esan United guilty of forging documents, causing the club return to Sisaket. Due to legal conflicts, Sisaket were suspended for the rest of the [[2013 Thai Premier League|season]] but were not relegated.\n\nThe club returned to the Thai Premier League in 2014, returning to their old name of '''Sisaket F.C''' and used [[Sri Nakhon Lamduan Stadium]] as their home ground.\n\n==Stadium and locations by season records==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

the [[1999\u20132000 Thailand Provincial League]] and currently competes in [[Thai League 2]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sisaket FC 2017.jpg|thumb|Sisaket FC in 2017]]\n\n===The early years===\nThe club was founded as Sisaket F.C. in 2009 and won the [[1999\u20132000 Thailand Provincial League|Thai Provincial League]]. The team was founded by the Sports Authority of Thailand in collaboration with the Football Association of Thailand.\n\nIn 2008 they were promoted from the [[Regional League Division 2]] to take them back to the [[Thai Division 1 League|Thai First Division]].\n\n===Promotion to the Thai Premier League===\nSisaket were promoted to the Premier league in 2010 after finishing third in the [[2009 Thai Division 1 League]].\n\n===Name change and relocation===\nIn 2012 the club relocated to [[Ubon Ratchathani Province]] after the local Sisaket government decided to back the newly formed [[Sisaket United F.C.]]. The club also changed their name to '''Esan United'''. Esan United finished the season in 6th, a record for the club.\n\n===Return to Sisaket===\nIn 2013 the [[Football Association of Thailand]] found Esan United guilty of forging documents, causing the club return to Sisaket. Due to legal conflicts, Sisaket were suspended for the rest of the [[2013 Thai Premier League|season]] but were not relegated.\n\nThe club returned to the Thai Premier League in 2014, returning to their old name of '''Sisaket F.C''' and used [[Sri Nakhon Lamduan Stadium]] as their home ground.\n\n==Stadium and locations by season records==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Kuro's last egg hatches, giving birth to a baby owl whom Ori, Naru, and Gumo name Ku and, while also continuing their life together, raise her as a family. Ku soon becomes the age to start flying, but being born with a damaged wing, she is unable to until Gumo affixes Kuro's feather to her wing. Ku and Ori go off on a flight, eventually taking them out of Nibel and into Niwen, where a storm causes them to be separated. \n\nRegaining consciousness from the fall, Ori's search for Ku leads them to Kwolok, a toad looking over the Inkwater Marsh and some of Niwen's inhabitants, the Moki. He tells Ori that Ku is in the Silent Woods, the Moki's former home now turned into a desolate graveyard of owls, but with the waters of Niwen unclean, Ori must set the wheels of The Wellspring back into motion to enter the Silent Woods. Kwolok also gives Ori a wisp, the Voice of the Forest, to guide them on their journey. At the same time that Ori enters The Wellspring, Naru and Gumo, realizing where Ori and Ku are, head off to Niwen via a [[raft]] to find them. Upon setting The Wellspring's wheels back into motion, clearing Niwen's water, Ori proceeds to enter the Silent Woods. There they soon reunite with Ku, but shortly after encounters Shriek, a deformed owl ruling over the Silent Woods and terrorizing Niwen who was an orphan at birth and rejected by the rest of her kind, turning her cold and vicious. Shriek attacks the pair and kills Ku.\n\nAfter mourning over Ku, Kwolok explains to Ori the Voice of the Forest is not at full power and as such, is unable to help Ku in its current state. Due to the Spirit Willow's passing, the light that it carried was shattered into five wisps that scattered across Niwen, leaving the forest vulnerable to corruption and decay that killed the Willow's guardian spirits and Shriek's parents before her birth. Kwolok tasks Ori with seeking out the other four wisps of the Spirit Willow's light: the Memory, Eyes, Strength, and Heart of the Forest, and merge them with the Voice to reform the tree's light. Kwolok leaves his marsh to help Ori find one of the wisps, but his body is forcibly taken over by the Stink Spirit, a creature born from out of the forest's decay whose body jamming the wheels of The Wellspring was the cause of their non-functionality. Ori breaks the spirit's control over Kwolok, allowing him to kill it but leaving him mortally wounded. Before dying, Kwolok pleads to Ori to restore and protect Niwen in his place.\n\nOri eventually finds all five wisps and merges them together to reform Seir, the Golden Light. Ori and Seir head to the Spirit Willow and Seir revives it. However, the tree tells Ori that its time has passed and it can no longer carry Seir, asking Ori to merge with the light to restore Niwen, though they would have to leave their previous life behind. The Spirit Willow passes Seir onto Ori, but Shriek reappears and snatches it. Ori defeats Shriek, who returns to the Silent Woods and dies in the wings of her parents' husks. \n\nDespite being injured by Shriek, Ori limps their way over to Seir and merges with it, healing Niwen and reviving Ku with her damaged wing restored in the process, which Naru and Gumo arrive in time to witness. Ku, Naru, and Gumo find where Ori and Seir merged, and they watch as a Spirit Tree begins to grow there. They help the tree flourish and continue their life together, as the Spirit Tree reveals that it was Ori all along, retelling the events leading up to when it merged with Seir. Eventually, the tree completely grows and life begins anew as a new spirit guardian falls from it.\n\n== Development and release ==\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"A lot of people completed ''Blind Forest'' in roughly eight hours, and thought that it was a positive experience,\" explains Daniel Smith, senior producer at Xbox Games Studios, who has been attached to the Ori projects since before the first title launched.\n\n\"But our community told us that there wasn't a lot of draw to come back in once they'd completed the title.

It's one of the best platformers ever made, and it's an easy front-runner for game of the year. If you liked the first game, you will love this one. And if you haven't experienced Ori's story, you owe it to yourself to dive in now, especially with both games now on Xbox Game Pass. I'll be replaying this game, listening to its soundtrack, and reminiscing over its characters for years to come.\" However, Wood acknowledged some negatives regarding a few of the game's abilities and called the final level \"slightly underwhelming\".<ref name=\"GRadarreview\"/> Brandin Tyrrel of ''[[IGN]]'' also praised the game, saying that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an excellent return to this bright and beautiful open-world platformer, with an affecting story to bolster the white-knuckle challenge.\" Tyrrell further complimented the game for staying true to the original, while at the same time adding more content than its predecessor.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s critic Tyler Wilde gave the game a favorable review, praising the platforming, boss fights and the visuals. Wilde mentioned some criticism regarding the fighting though, saying that \"it's not much fun\".<ref name=\"PCG review\"/> Writing for ''VideoGamer'', Josh Wise acclaimed the game for its graphics, music and platforming, stating that \"In the beauty stakes and beyond, there are very few, in the rarefied realms of indie or AAA, who can challenge it\".

From its hauntingly beautiful visuals to its ambient, responsive music, there is so much to love about the look and feel of this long-awaited sequel.\" Onanuga acknowledged some less positive aspects of the game, calling the story \"melancholy at times\" and stating that fighting \"the more common enemies can feel a little tedious after a while\". She ended her review in a positive manner, saying that \"Peppered with devious puzzles, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisp[s]'' is an irresistible challenge.

Unlike its predecessor ''[[Ori and the Blind Forest|The Blind Forest]]'', ''Will of the Wisps'' relies on autosaving rather than manually placed \"soul links\", and the sequential upgrade system of the first title has been abandoned for a \"shard\" system that allows players to upgrade Ori in various ways, like sticking to walls and those that are equipped can be changed on the fly.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.gamesradar.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-is-taking-serious-inspiration-from-zelda-with-its-new-focus-on-fluid-combat/ |title= Ori and the Will of the Wisps is taking serious inspiration from Zelda with its new focus on fluid combat |last= Loveridge |first= Sam |date= February 27, 2020 |accessdate= March 3, 2020 |work= [[GamesRadar+]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200303061750/https://www.gamesradar.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-is-taking-serious-inspiration-from-zelda-with-its-new-focus-on-fluid-combat/ |archive-date= March 3, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref> Some of the foundational gameplay elements were inspired by the ''[[Rayman]]'' and ''[[Metroid]]'' franchises.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.videogamer.com/news/soul-links-in-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-didnt-make-sense-says-developer |title= Soul Links in Ori and the Will of the Wisps \"didn't make sense\", says developer |last= Donovan |first= Imogen |date= March 9, 2020 |accessdate= March 15, 2020 |work= VideoGamer |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200314191058/https://www.videogamer.com/news/soul-links-in-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-didnt-make-sense-says-developer |archive-date= March 14, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nA new mode called Spirit Trials was revealed at [[Gamescom]] 2018.

Kuro's last egg hatches, giving birth to a baby owl whom Ori, Naru, and Gumo name Ku and, while also continuing their life together, raise her as a family. Ku soon becomes the age to start flying, but being born with a damaged wing, she is unable to until Gumo affixes Kuro's feather to her wing. Ku and Ori go off on a flight, eventually taking them out of Nibel and into Niwen, where a storm causes them to be separated. \n\nRegaining consciousness from the fall, Ori's search for Ku leads them to Kwolok, a toad looking over the Inkwater Marsh and some of Niwen's inhabitants, the Moki. He tells Ori that Ku is in the Silent Woods, the Moki's former home now turned into a desolate graveyard of owls, but with the waters of Niwen unclean, Ori must set the wheels of The Wellspring back into motion to enter the Silent Woods. Kwolok also gives Ori a wisp, the Voice of the Forest, to guide them on their journey. At the same time that Ori enters The Wellspring, Naru and Gumo, realizing where Ori and Ku are, head off to Niwen via a [[raft]] to find them. Upon setting The Wellspring's wheels back into motion, clearing Niwen's water, Ori proceeds to enter the Silent Woods. There they soon reunite with Ku, but shortly after encounters Shriek, a deformed owl ruling over the Silent Woods and terrorizing Niwen who was an orphan at birth and rejected by the rest of her kind, turning her cold and vicious. Shriek attacks the pair and kills Ku.\n\nAfter mourning over Ku, Kwolok explains to Ori the Voice of the Forest is not at full power and as such, is unable to help Ku in its current state. Due to the Spirit Willow's passing, the light that it carried was shattered into five wisps that scattered across Niwen, leaving the forest vulnerable to corruption and decay that killed the Willow's guardian spirits and Shriek's parents before her birth. Kwolok tasks Ori with seeking out the other four wisps of the Spirit Willow's light: the Memory, Eyes, Strength, and Heart of the Forest, and merge them with the Voice to reform the tree's light. Kwolok leaves his marsh to help Ori find one of the wisps, but his body is forcibly taken over by the Stink Spirit, a creature born from out of the forest's decay whose body jamming the wheels of The Wellspring was the cause of their non-functionality. Ori breaks the spirit's control over Kwolok, allowing him to kill it but leaving him mortally wounded. Before dying, Kwolok pleads to Ori to restore and protect Niwen in his place.\n\nOri eventually finds all five wisps and merges them together to reform Seir, the Golden Light. Ori and Seir head to the Spirit Willow and Seir revives it. However, the tree tells Ori that its time has passed and it can no longer carry Seir, asking Ori to merge with the light to restore Niwen, though they would have to leave their previous life behind. The Spirit Willow passes Seir onto Ori, but Shriek reappears and snatches it. Ori defeats Shriek, who returns to the Silent Woods and dies in the wings of her parents' husks. \n\nDespite being injured by Shriek, Ori limps their way over to Seir and merges with it, healing Niwen and reviving Ku with her damaged wing restored in the process, which Naru and Gumo arrive in time to witness. Ku, Naru, and Gumo find where Ori and Seir merged, and they watch as a Spirit Tree begins to grow there. They help the tree flourish and continue their life together, as the Spirit Tree reveals that it was Ori all along, retelling the events leading up to when it merged with Seir. Eventually, the tree completely grows and life begins anew as a new spirit guardian falls from it.\n\n== Development and release ==\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"A lot of people completed ''Blind Forest'' in roughly eight hours, and thought that it was a positive experience,\" explains Daniel Smith, senior producer at Xbox Games Studios, who has been attached to the Ori projects since before the first title launched.\n\n\"But our community told us that there wasn't a lot of draw to come back in once they'd completed the title.

He described the game as \"A hallmark of excellence\", saying that \"There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage\". Carter particularly praised the game's visuals, combat improvements from the game's predecessor, as well as the \"dramatic chase sequences\". However, he mentioned some [[frame rate]] issues regarding the Xbox One version of the game.<ref name=\"Carter\"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''{{'}}s Michael Goroff stated positive opinions regarding the game, while pointing out the performance issues which the [[Xbox One]] edition of the game suffered from before the day-one [[patch (computing)|patch]] was released. Goroff further mentioned that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' does everything that a good sequel is supposed to do. It refines ''The Blind Forest''{{'}}s mechanics, expands on the world, and throws in a whole bunch of new moves and concepts. But in an era that's rich with 'emotional platformers', ''Will of the Wisps'' doesn't do anything to make itself stand out. It's a fine, if not forgettable, experience\".<ref name=\"EGMreview\"/> Writing for ''[[Game Informer]]'', Andrew Reiner praised the game's graphics, story and combat, subsequently calling the game better than its predecessor. Reiner said that \"The story is fantastic, the world is breathtaking, and all of that pales in comparison to the wonderfully made gameplay that soars both as a platforming and combat game. Moon Studios has outdone itself with ''Will of the Wisps'', delivering an experience that doesn't have any lulls, makes the player feel clever, and just keeps getting better as it goes.\"<ref name=\"Game Informer\"/> ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s critic Steve Watts gave the game a positive review, commending the combat, exploring elements, story as well as the \"Gorgeous animation and environments\". Moreover, he highlighted occasional visual bugs as negative aspects of the game.<ref name=\"GSreview\"/> \n\nAustin Wood, reviewer for ''[[GamesRadar+]]'', acclaimed the game and its \"breathtaking music\", world and its platforming. Wood stated that \"There are a few minor stumbles here and there, but make no mistake: I ''adore'' ''Ori and The Will of the Wisps''. It's one of the best platformers ever made, and it's an easy front-runner for game of the year. If you liked the first game, you will love this one. And if you haven't experienced Ori's story, you owe it to yourself to dive in now, especially with both games now on Xbox Game Pass. I'll be replaying this game, listening to its soundtrack, and reminiscing over its characters for years to come.\" However, Wood acknowledged some negatives regarding a few of the game's abilities and called the final level \"slightly underwhelming\".<ref name=\"GRadarreview\"/> Brandin Tyrrel of ''[[IGN]]'' also praised the game, saying that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an excellent return to this bright and beautiful open-world platformer, with an affecting story to bolster the white-knuckle challenge.\" Tyrrell further complimented the game for staying true to the original, while at the same time adding more content than its predecessor.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s critic Tyler Wilde gave the game a favorable review, praising the platforming, boss fights and the visuals. Wilde mentioned some criticism regarding the fighting though, saying that \"it's not much fun\".<ref name=\"PCG review\"/> Writing for ''VideoGamer'', Josh Wise acclaimed the game for its graphics, music and platforming, stating that \"In the beauty stakes and beyond, there are very few, in the rarefied realms of indie or AAA, who can challenge it\". However, Wise pointed out some negatives towards the game's plot, calling it \"thin\".<ref name=\"VGreview\"/> Tola Onanuga of ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the game, saying that \"More than anything else, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an intoxicating feast for the senses. From its hauntingly beautiful visuals to its ambient, responsive music, there is so much to love about the look and feel of this long-awaited sequel.\" Onanuga acknowledged some less positive aspects of the game, calling the story \"melancholy at times\" and stating that fighting \"the more common enemies can feel a little tedious after a while\". She ended her review in a positive manner, saying that \"Peppered with devious puzzles, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisp[s]'' is an irresistible challenge. There is extraordinary attention to detail - the entire world feels alive with excitement and danger.\"<ref name=\"Guardianreview\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.orithegame.com/ Official website]\n*[https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/ori-will-of-the-wisps Official Xbox website for the game]\n{{Authority control}}{{Portal bar|Video games}}\n\n[[Category:Adventure games]]\n[[Category:Fantasy games]]\n[[Category:Indie video games]]\n[[Category:Microsoft games]]\n[[Category:Orphans in fiction]]\n[[Category:Platform games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Unity (game engine) games]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One X enhanced games]]\n[[Category:Metroidvania games]]\n[[Category:2020 video games]]\n[[Category:Video game art]]\n[[Category:Video game sequels]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring female antagonists]]\n", "name_user": "Awakes", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added the additional writers listed in the credits of the game, taken from Mobygames: https://www.mobygames.com/game/xbox-one/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps/credits", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ori_and_the_Will_of_the_Wisps"}

It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nDuring the development of ''Worms 2'', Andy Davidson wrote ''Worms \u2013 The Director's Cut'', a special edition produced exclusively for the AGA chipset Amiga. Only 5000 copies were ever sold. It was also the last version released for the Commodore Amiga platform from which the game originated.\n\nThe references to the developers' home county, [[Yorkshire]], is visible, with a soundbank named \"Tykes\", which is a Yorkshire accent, and in the \"Hell\" level found in the single player mission mode, a sign with \"Welcome to [[Ossett]]! Ha! ha! ha!\" written on it.\n\nThe North American release of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was the subject of considerable negotiation, as Sony Computer Entertainment of America had a policy against 2D games being published for the console. The [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was a straight port of the PlayStation version.\n\nIn 1995, Team17 began development on a port of ''Worms'' to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Boy]] platform.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\">{{cite magazine|author=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MicromaniaTerceraEpocaSpanishIssue8#page/n57/mode/1up|title=Reportaje: Extra\u00f1a mezcla... de gusanos - Worms|magazine=[[Microman\u00eda]]|volume=3|issue=8|publisher=HobbyPress|date=September 1995|page=58|lang=es}}</ref> The game was to be published by Ocean, but was canceled only weeks into development as a result of Nintendo's discontinuation of the console.<ref>[http://www.vr32.de/modules/games/?u030 VR32.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322181752/http://www.vr32.de/modules/games/?u030 |date=2009-03-22 }}</ref> A [[32X]] release was also planned but never released as well.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\"/>\n\nAn [[Atari Jaguar]] version was also developed by Team17 and published by [[Telegames]] in May 15, 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Charlton|first=Frank|url=http://www.stformat.com/stf85/pages_nx1500/stf85_010.jpg|title=STF News... - Worms wriggles in|magazine=[[ST Format]]|issue=85|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=August 1996|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jason|url=http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|title=Atari Jaguar Timeline|website=jaguarsector.com|accessdate=2018-09-13|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629025431/http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|archivedate=29 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Telegames announced the release of this version after becoming the last remaining software publisher for the Jaguar and like other games published following the system's discontinuation,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AEGM_US_094.pdf&page=24|title=Tidbits...|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=24}}</ref> ''Worms'' could be purchased either through [[Direct selling|direct order]] from Telegames' US and UK websites or select retailers such as [[EB Games|Electronics Boutique]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_105.pdf&page=22|title=News Bits|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=105|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1997|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_5_Issue_10#page/n41|title=Recent Sightings of an Endangered Species|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=5|issue=10|publisher=Shinno Media|date=October 1997|page=36}}</ref> It also served as the final title released for the console to be officially licensed with the Atari name, as the rights to said name and other [[intellectual property]] rights of [[Atari Corporation]] were sold to [[Hasbro Interactive]] before [[JT Storage]]'s bankruptcy in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|title=Hasbro Interactive Acquires Legendary Atari Game Property Assets|website=Nine Lives|date=March 16, 1998|accessdate=2018-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107232949/http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|archivedate=7 November 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Character, level and sound design===\nThe game's graphics and sound design is primarily 'cartoon-like' (though less so than the later games in the series). Levels designs are randomly generated by the use of alpha-numeric strings as their [[Random seed|seeds]]. The object and landscape sets used to generate the field are arranged into 'themes' including forests, martian landscapes, beaches and 'hell'.\n\n==Remake==\n''Worms'' is the first in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of games. A [[Video game remake|remake]], also called ''[[Worms (2007 video game)|Worms]]'', for the Xbox 360 was released in 2007. It has since been released to the PS3, in April 2009, and on the [[iPhone]] on July 11, 2009.\n\n==Worms Reinforcements==\n''Worms Reinforcements'' ([[1996 in video gaming|1996]]) is an expansion pack for ''Worms'', which was later amalgamated with the original game to create ''Worms and Reinforcements United'' (a.k.a. ''Worms United'' or ''Worms Utd.'') the same year. Released only for the [[personal computer|PC]], it added a single player campaign and the ability to add custom levels and soundpacks (which was already available for the [[Amiga]] version). It also included an introductory FMV.\n\n==Worms: The Director's Cut==\n''[[Worms: The Director's Cut]]'' ([[1997 in video gaming|1997]]) is a sequel to ''Worms'', available only on the Amiga. It is largely built upon the original Amiga game engine with various gameplay enhancement and additions, as well as graphical improvements and fixes.\n\n== Reception ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; font-size:80%; text-align:center; margin:1em; margin-top:0; padding:0; background:none;\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n! colspan=10 style=\"font-size: 100%\" | Reception\n|-\n! colspan=10 | Aggregate scores\n|-\n! rowspan=2  | Aggregator\n! colspan=10 | Scores\n|-\n!

By March 1996, its sales had reached almost 250,000 copies, following its release in November 1995.<ref name=wormssales>{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018190644/http://www.nuke.com:80/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm | url=http://www.nuke.com:80/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm | title=Sales of ''Worms'' skyrockets | author=Staff | date=March 1996 | archivedate=October 18, 1996 | work=[[Computer Game Review]] | url-status=dead }}</ref> Across all its ports, the game ultimately sold above 5 million units by 2006.<ref name=retrogamer>{{cite journal | author=Day, Ashley | title=The Making of...

Reviewing the Saturn version, ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' especially praised Worms's unexpected complexity and the fun of multiplayer mode, and called it \"Quite simply the most playable game to hit the Saturn so far.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\n''Maximum'' commented that \"Basically, ''Worms'' is ''Lemmings'', but it's without the puzzles and with weapons instead.\" While firmly stating that they found the game dull and unappealing, they acknowledged that it was clearly well-liked by gamers.<ref name=\"MaximumSSw\"/><ref name=\"MaximumSSw/>\n\nA ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic argued while the game resembles ''Lemmings'' on a cursory examination, in actuality it is much more similar to ''Cannon Fodder''. Praising the need for both strategy and skill, the multiplayer design, and the randomly generated landscapes, he described ''Worms'' as \"the kind of game that makes no excuses for its lack of texture-mapped polygons or its minimalist gameplay. ''Worms'' is a fun game with an infectious spirit and near endless replay value.\"<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/><ref name=\"NGenSSw\"/>\n\nCoach Kyle of ''[[GamePro]]'' summarized that \"A humorous concept never really pays off in ''Worms''.\" He criticized that the tiny size of the characters and their weapons makes them unappealing and even hard to make out. While allowing that the use of the different weapons is interesting at first, he found the action too slow-paced and repetitive to maintain interest.<ref name=\"GProSSw\"/>\n\nThe four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' commented that \"Some games have great graphics and control, but ''Worms'' doesn't need either because the fun factor is a 10+. With multiplayer ability of up to four people, ''Worms'' is one of those games that is so unique, it doesn't fit into any category - except innovative and incredibly addictive.\"<ref name=\"EGMSSw\"/> They later named it one of their \"Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 1997|page=152}}</ref>\n\n''[[GameSpot]]'' criticized the slowness of large multiplayer sessions and the imprecision of the keyboard controls, but, like ''Sega Saturn Magazine'', they lauded the combination of surface simplicity and underlying complexity, summarizing that \"Like the board game [[Othello (game)|Othello]], ''Worms'' takes only a few minutes to learn, but may take a lifetime to master.\"<ref name=\"GSpotPCw\"/>\n\nConversely, the ''[[Amiga Power]]'' review, written in the style of a magazine personality quiz, whilst praising the detail of the animation, described frustrating imbalances especially in relation to the vaunted 16-player multi-player mode and was critical of the puerility of the game's humour.<ref name=\"APA500w\"/>\n\n''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' named ''Worms'' a runner-up for Strategy Game of the Year (behind ''[[Dragon Force]]'').<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=88}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official website|http://worms.team17.com/}} ''Worms'' series\n*{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08C-ttHHKFs Total Wormage trailer]\n\n{{Team17}}\n{{Virtual Boy}}\n{{Worms series}}\n{{Portal bar|1990s|United Kingdom|Video games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worms (1995 video game)}}\n[[Category:Worms games| 01]]\n[[Category:1995 video games]]\n[[Category:Ocean Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox]]\n[[Category:Amiga games]]\n[[Category:Artillery video games]]\n[[Category:Atari Jaguar games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Sega 32X games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Virtual Boy games]]\n[[Category:CD32 games]]\n[[Category:DOS games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation (console) games]]\n[[Category:Sega Genesis games]]\n[[Category:Sega Saturn games]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Team17]]\n[[Category:Telegames games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Allister Brimble]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||the 2007 game|Worms (2007 video game)|the 1983 game|Worms?}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title        = Worms\n| image        = Worms-win-cover.jpg\n| image_size   = 256px\n| caption      = \n| developer    = [[Team17]]\n| publisher    = [[Ocean Software]]\n| designer     = [[Andy Davidson (game designer)|Andy Davidson]]\n|composer      = [[Bj\u00f8rn Lynne]]\n| series       = ''[[Worms (series)|Worms]]''\n| engine       = \n| released     = '''Amiga, CD32, Game Boy & Mac'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|1995<ref>{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}</ref><ref>[http://amr.abime.net/review_10209 Worms review from CU Amiga Magazine (Dec 1995) \u2013 Amiga Magazine Rack] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220093731/http://amr.abime.net/review_10209 |date=2012-02-20 }}</ref>}}'''Mega Drive'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|June 1, 1995}}'''PC (DOS)'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|October 31, 1995 (Retail)|EU|1995|NA|October 19, 2011 (Steam)}}'''PlayStation'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|1996|EU|November, 1995<ref name=\"CTW565\">{{cite magazine |title=Christmas Games Guide |magazine=Computer Trade Weekly |location=United Kingdom |date=27 November 1995 |issue=565 |page=43 }}</ref>|JP|February 28, 1997}}'''SNES'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|September 29, 1996}}'''Saturn'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|1996|EU|1995|JP|March 14, 1997}}'''Jaguar'''<br />{{vgrelease|NA|May 15, 1998}}\n| genre        = [[Artillery game|Artillery]], [[Strategy video game|Strategy]]\n| modes        = [[Single-player]], [[multiplayer]]\n| platforms    = [[Amiga]], [[Amiga CD32]], [[Game Boy]], [[Sega Genesis]], [[Atari Jaguar]], [[Mac OS]], [[IBM PC compatible]] ([[MS-DOS]]), [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]\n}}\n'''''Worms''''' is a 2D [[Artillery game|artillery]] [[Strategy video game|tactical]] video game developed by [[Team17]] and released in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]]. It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nDuring the development of ''Worms 2'', Andy Davidson wrote ''Worms \u2013 The Director's Cut'', a special edition produced exclusively for the AGA chipset Amiga. Only 5000 copies were ever sold. It was also the last version released for the Commodore Amiga platform from which the game originated.\n\nThe references to the developers' home county, [[Yorkshire]], is visible, with a soundbank named \"Tykes\", which is a Yorkshire accent, and in the \"Hell\" level found in the single player mission mode, a sign with \"Welcome to [[Ossett]]! Ha! ha! ha!\" written on it.\n\nThe North American release of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was the subject of considerable negotiation, as Sony Computer Entertainment of America had a policy against 2D games being published for the console. The [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was a straight port of the PlayStation version.\n\nIn 1995, Team17 began development on a port of ''Worms'' to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Boy]] platform.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\">{{cite magazine|author=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MicromaniaTerceraEpocaSpanishIssue8#page/n57/mode/1up|title=Reportaje: Extra\u00f1a mezcla... de gusanos - Worms|magazine=[[Microman\u00eda]]|volume=3|issue=8|publisher=HobbyPress|date=September 1995|page=58|lang=es}}</ref> The game was to be published by Ocean, but was canceled only weeks into development as a result of Nintendo's discontinuation of the console.<ref>[http://www.vr32.de/modules/games/?u030 VR32.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322181752/http://www.vr32.de/modules/games/?u030 |date=2009-03-22 }}</ref> A [[32X]] release was also planned but never released as well.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\"/>\n\nAn [[Atari Jaguar]] version was also developed by Team17 and published by [[Telegames]] in May 15, 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Charlton|first=Frank|url=http://www.stformat.com/stf85/pages_nx1500/stf85_010.jpg|title=STF News... - Worms wriggles in|magazine=[[ST Format]]|issue=85|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=August 1996|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jason|url=http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|title=Atari Jaguar Timeline|website=jaguarsector.com|accessdate=2018-09-13|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629025431/http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|archivedate=29 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Telegames announced the release of this version after becoming the last remaining software publisher for the Jaguar and like other games published following the system's discontinuation,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AEGM_US_094.pdf&page=24|title=Tidbits...|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=24}}</ref> ''Worms'' could be purchased either through [[Direct selling|direct order]] from Telegames' US and UK websites or select retailers such as [[EB Games|Electronics Boutique]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_105.pdf&page=22|title=News Bits|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=105|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1997|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_5_Issue_10#page/n41|title=Recent Sightings of an Endangered Species|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=5|issue=10|publisher=Shinno Media|date=October 1997|page=36}}</ref> It also served as the final title released for the console to be officially licensed with the Atari name, as the rights to said name and other [[intellectual property]] rights of [[Atari Corporation]] were sold to [[Hasbro Interactive]] before [[JT Storage]]'s bankruptcy in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|title=Hasbro Interactive Acquires Legendary Atari Game Property Assets|website=Nine Lives|date=March 16, 1998|accessdate=2018-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107232949/http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|archivedate=7 November 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Character, level and sound design===\nThe game's graphics and sound design is primarily 'cartoon-like' (though less so than the later games in the series). Levels designs are randomly generated by the use of alpha-numeric strings as their [[Random seed|seeds]]. The object and landscape sets used to generate the field are arranged into 'themes' including forests, martian landscapes, beaches and 'hell'.\n\n==Remake==\n''Worms'' is the first in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of games. A [[Video game remake|remake]], also called ''[[Worms (2007 video game)|Worms]]'', for the Xbox 360 was released in 2007. It has since been released to the PS3, in April 2009, and on the [[iPhone]] on July 11, 2009.\n\n==Worms Reinforcements==\n''Worms Reinforcements'' ([[1996 in video gaming|1996]]) is an expansion pack for ''Worms'', which was later amalgamated with the original game to create ''Worms and Reinforcements United'' (a.k.a. ''Worms United'' or ''Worms Utd.'') the same year. Released only for the [[personal computer|PC]], it added a single player campaign and the ability to add custom levels and soundpacks (which was already available for the [[Amiga]] version). It also included an introductory FMV.\n\n==Worms: The Director's Cut==\n''[[Worms: The Director's Cut]]'' ([[1997 in video gaming|1997]]) is a sequel to ''Worms'', available only on the Amiga. It is largely built upon the original Amiga game engine with various gameplay enhancement and additions, as well as graphical improvements and fixes.\n\n== Reception ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; font-size:80%; text-align:center; margin:1em; margin-top:0; padding:0; background:none;\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n! colspan=10 style=\"font-size: 100%\" | Reception\n|-\n! colspan=10 | Aggregate scores\n|-\n! rowspan=2  | Aggregator\n! colspan=10 | Scores\n|-\n!

By March 1996, its sales had reached almost 250,000 copies, following its release in November 1995.<ref name=wormssales>{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018190644/http://www.nuke.com:80/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm | url=http://www.nuke.com:80/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm | title=Sales of ''Worms'' skyrockets | author=Staff | date=March 1996 | archivedate=October 18, 1996 | work=[[Computer Game Review]] | url-status=dead }}</ref> Across all its ports, the game ultimately sold above 5 million units by 2006.<ref name=retrogamer>{{cite journal | author=Day, Ashley | title=The Making of... ''Worms'' | journal=[[Retro Gamer]] | issue=23 | date=April 2006 | pages=26\u201329 }}</ref>\n\n''Worms'' sharply divided critics. Reviewing the Saturn version, ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' especially praised Worms's unexpected complexity and the fun of multiplayer mode, and called it \"Quite simply the most playable game to hit the Saturn so far.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\n''Maximum'' commented that \"Basically, ''Worms'' is ''Lemmings'', but it's without the puzzles and with weapons instead.\" While firmly stating that they found the game dull and unappealing, they acknowledged that it was clearly well-liked by gamers.<ref name=\"MaximumSSw\"/><ref name=\"MaximumSSw/>\n\nA ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic argued while the game resembles ''Lemmings'' on a cursory examination, in actuality it is much more similar to ''Cannon Fodder''. Praising the need for both strategy and skill, the multiplayer design, and the randomly generated landscapes, he described ''Worms'' as \"the kind of game that makes no excuses for its lack of texture-mapped polygons or its minimalist gameplay. ''Worms'' is a fun game with an infectious spirit and near endless replay value.\"<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/><ref name=\"NGenSSw\"/>\n\nCoach Kyle of ''[[GamePro]]'' summarized that \"A humorous concept never really pays off in ''Worms''.\" He criticized that the tiny size of the characters and their weapons makes them unappealing and even hard to make out. While allowing that the use of the different weapons is interesting at first, he found the action too slow-paced and repetitive to maintain interest.<ref name=\"GProSSw\"/>\n\nThe four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' commented that \"Some games have great graphics and control, but ''Worms'' doesn't need either because the fun factor is a 10+. With multiplayer ability of up to four people, ''Worms'' is one of those games that is so unique, it doesn't fit into any category - except innovative and incredibly addictive.\"<ref name=\"EGMSSw\"/> They later named it one of their \"Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 1997|page=152}}</ref>\n\n''[[GameSpot]]'' criticized the slowness of large multiplayer sessions and the imprecision of the keyboard controls, but, like ''Sega Saturn Magazine'', they lauded the combination of surface simplicity and underlying complexity, summarizing that \"Like the board game [[Othello (game)|Othello]], ''Worms'' takes only a few minutes to learn, but may take a lifetime to master.\"<ref name=\"GSpotPCw\"/>\n\nConversely, the ''[[Amiga Power]]'' review, written in the style of a magazine personality quiz, whilst praising the detail of the animation, described frustrating imbalances especially in relation to the vaunted 16-player multi-player mode and was critical of the puerility of the game's humour.<ref name=\"APA500w\"/>\n\n''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' named ''Worms'' a runner-up for Strategy Game of the Year (behind ''[[Dragon Force]]'').<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=88}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official website|http://worms.team17.com/}} ''Worms'' series\n*{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08C-ttHHKFs Total Wormage trailer]\n\n{{Team17}}\n{{Virtual Boy}}\n{{Worms series}}\n{{Portal bar|1990s|United Kingdom|Video games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worms (1995 video game)}}\n[[Category:Worms games| 01]]\n[[Category:1995 video games]]\n[[Category:Ocean Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox]]\n[[Category:Amiga games]]\n[[Category:Artillery video games]]\n[[Category:Atari Jaguar games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Sega 32X games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Virtual Boy games]]\n[[Category:CD32 games]]\n[[Category:DOS games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation (console) games]]\n[[Category:Sega Genesis games]]\n[[Category:Sega Saturn games]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Team17]]\n[[Category:Telegames games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Allister Brimble]]\n", "name_user": "KGRAMR", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReception", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_(1995_video_game)"}
