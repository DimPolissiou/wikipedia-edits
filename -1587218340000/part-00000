When Jason offers to sell Charlie the carcass, he refuses and threatens to report Donnelly to the police for the illegal sale of a scientific discovery.

His father, Frank, who is supposed to be looking after him, is nowhere to be seen. Liam opens up his bedroom window, and climbs barefoot into the snow.

Such term does not include programs, projects, or activities of the military departments to acquire intelligence solely for the planning and conduct of tactical military operations by the United States Armed Forces\". Under the law, the DNI is responsible for directing and overseeing the NIP, though the ability to do so is limited (see the Organization structure and leadership section).\n* The '''Military Intelligence Program''' ('''MIP''') refers to the programs, projects, or activities of the military departments to acquire intelligence solely for the planning and conduct of tactical military operations by the United States Armed Forces. The MIP is directed and controlled by the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence. In 2005 the Department of Defense combined the '''Joint Military Intelligence Program''' and the '''Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities''' program to form the MIP.\n\nSince the definitions of the NIP and MIP overlap when they address [[military intelligence]], assignment of intelligence activities to the NIP and MIP sometimes proves problematic.\n\n===Organizational structure and leadership===\n[[File:IC Circle.jpg|thumb]]\nThe overall organization of the IC is primarily governed by the [[National Security Act of 1947]] (as amended) and {{ExecutiveOrder|12333}}. The statutory organizational relationships were substantially revised with the 2004 [[Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act]] (IRTPA) amendments to the 1947 National Security Act.\n\nThough the IC characterizes itself as a [[federation]] of its member elements,<ref name=\"What is Intelligence?\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.odni.gov/index.php/what-we-do/what-is-intelligence |title=What is Intelligence? |website=www.odni.gov |publisher=Office of the Director of National Intelligence |language=en-gb |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117211801/https://www.odni.gov/index.php/what-we-do/what-is-intelligence |archive-date=17 November 2018|accessdate=17 November 2018}}</ref> its overall structure is better characterized as a [[confederation]] due to its lack of a well-defined, unified leadership and governance structure.  Prior to 2004, the [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (DCI) was the head of the IC, in addition to being the director of the CIA.  A major criticism of this arrangement was that the DCI had little or no actual authority over the budgetary authorities of the other IC agencies and therefore had limited influence over their operations.\n\nFollowing the passage of IRTPA in 2004, the head of the IC is the [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI). The DNI exerts leadership of the IC primarily through statutory authorities under which he or she:\n* controls the \"National Intelligence Program\" budget;\n* establishes objectives, priorities, and guidance for the IC; and\n* manages and directs the tasking of, collection, analysis, production, and dissemination of national intelligence by elements of the IC.\n\nHowever, the DNI has no authority to direct and control any element of the IC except his own staff\u2014the Office of the DNI\u2014neither does the DNI have the authority to hire or fire personnel in the IC except those on his own staff. The member elements in the executive branch are directed and controlled by their respective department heads, all cabinet-level officials reporting to the President. By law, only the [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]] reports to the DNI.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn light of major intelligence failures in recent years that called into question how well Intelligence Community ensures U.S. national security, particularly those identified by the [[9/11 Commission]] (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States), and the \"[[Iraq Intelligence Commission|WMD Commission]]\" (Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction), the authorities and powers of the DNI and the overall organizational structure of the IC have become subject of intense debate in the United States.\n\n===Interagency cooperation===\nPreviously, interagency cooperation and the flow of information among the member agencies was hindered by policies that sought to limit the pooling of information out of privacy and security concerns. Attempts to modernize and facilitate interagency cooperation within the IC include technological, structural, procedural, and cultural dimensions. Examples include the [[Intellipedia]] [[wiki]] of encyclopedic security-related information; the creation of the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]], [[National Counterterrorism Center|National Intelligence Centers]], [[Program Manager Information Sharing Environment]], and [[Information Sharing Council]]; legal and policy frameworks set by the [[Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004]], information sharing [[s:Executive Order 13354|Executive Orders 13354]] and [[Executive Order 13388]], and the 2005 [[National Intelligence Strategy of the United States of America|National Intelligence Strategy]].\n\n===Budget===\n[[File:US intelligence budget.png|thumb|300px|Data visualization of U.S. intelligence black budget (2013)]]\n\nThe [[United States intelligence budget|U.S. intelligence budget]] (excluding the Military Intelligence Program) in fiscal year 2013 was appropriated as $52.7 billion, and reduced by the amount sequestered to $49.0 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/191-press-releases-2013/957-dni-releases-budget-figure-for-2013-national-intelligence-program|title=DNI Releases Budget Figure for 2013 National Intelligence Program|publisher=Office of the Director of National Intelligence|accessdate={{date|2 aug 2014}}|date=30 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302194422/http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/191-press-releases-2013/957-dni-releases-budget-figure-for-2013-national-intelligence-program|archive-date=2 March 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In fiscal year 2012 it peaked at $53.9 billion, according to a disclosure required under a recent law implementing recommendations of the [[9/11 Commission]].<ref>[http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/96-press-releases-2012/756-dni-releases-fy-2012-appropriated-budget-figure?highlight=YTozOntpOjA7czo2OiJidWRnZXQiO2k6MTtzOjk6ImJ1ZGdldGluZyI7aToyO3M6NzoiYnVkZ2V0cyI7fQ== DNI Releases FY 2012 Appropriated Budget Figure].

Such term does not include programs, projects, or activities of the military departments to acquire intelligence solely for the planning and conduct of tactical military operations by the United States Armed Forces\". Under the law, the DNI is responsible for directing and overseeing the NIP, though the ability to do so is limited (see the Organization structure and leadership section).\n* The '''Military Intelligence Program''' ('''MIP''') refers to the programs, projects, or activities of the military departments to acquire intelligence solely for the planning and conduct of tactical military operations by the United States Armed Forces. The MIP is directed and controlled by the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence. In 2005 the Department of Defense combined the '''Joint Military Intelligence Program''' and the '''Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities''' program to form the MIP.\n\nSince the definitions of the NIP and MIP overlap when they address [[military intelligence]], assignment of intelligence activities to the NIP and MIP sometimes proves problematic.\n\n===Organizational structure and leadership===\n[[File:IC Circle.jpg|thumb]]\nThe overall organization of the IC is primarily governed by the [[National Security Act of 1947]] (as amended) and {{ExecutiveOrder|12333}}. The statutory organizational relationships were substantially revised with the 2004 [[Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act]] (IRTPA) amendments to the 1947 National Security Act.\n\nThough the IC characterizes itself as a [[federation]] of its member elements,<ref name=\"What is Intelligence?\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.odni.gov/index.php/what-we-do/what-is-intelligence |title=What is Intelligence? |website=www.odni.gov |publisher=Office of the Director of National Intelligence |language=en-gb |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117211801/https://www.odni.gov/index.php/what-we-do/what-is-intelligence |archive-date=17 November 2018|accessdate=17 November 2018}}</ref> its overall structure is better characterized as a [[confederation]] due to its lack of a well-defined, unified leadership and governance structure.  Prior to 2004, the [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (DCI) was the head of the IC, in addition to being the director of the CIA.  A major criticism of this arrangement was that the DCI had little or no actual authority over the budgetary authorities of the other IC agencies and therefore had limited influence over their operations.\n\nFollowing the passage of IRTPA in 2004, the head of the IC is the [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI). The DNI exerts leadership of the IC primarily through statutory authorities under which he or she:\n* controls the \"National Intelligence Program\" budget;\n* establishes objectives, priorities, and guidance for the IC; and\n* manages and directs the tasking of, collection, analysis, production, and dissemination of national intelligence by elements of the IC.\n\nHowever, the DNI has no authority to direct and control any element of the IC except his own staff\u2014the Office of the DNI\u2014neither does the DNI have the authority to hire or fire personnel in the IC except those on his own staff. The member elements in the executive branch are directed and controlled by their respective department heads, all cabinet-level officials reporting to the President. By law, only the [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]] reports to the DNI.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn light of major intelligence failures in recent years that called into question how well Intelligence Community ensures U.S. national security, particularly those identified by the [[9/11 Commission]] (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States), and the \"[[Iraq Intelligence Commission|WMD Commission]]\" (Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction), the authorities and powers of the DNI and the overall organizational structure of the IC have become subject of intense debate in the United States.\n\n===Interagency cooperation===\nPreviously, interagency cooperation and the flow of information among the member agencies was hindered by policies that sought to limit the pooling of information out of privacy and security concerns. Attempts to modernize and facilitate interagency cooperation within the IC include technological, structural, procedural, and cultural dimensions. Examples include the [[Intellipedia]] [[wiki]] of encyclopedic security-related information; the creation of the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]], [[National Counterterrorism Center|National Intelligence Centers]], [[Program Manager Information Sharing Environment]], and [[Information Sharing Council]]; legal and policy frameworks set by the [[Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004]], information sharing [[s:Executive Order 13354|Executive Orders 13354]] and [[Executive Order 13388]], and the 2005 [[National Intelligence Strategy of the United States of America|National Intelligence Strategy]].\n\n===Budget===\n[[File:US intelligence budget.png|thumb|300px|Data visualization of U.S. intelligence black budget (2013)]]\n\nThe [[United States intelligence budget|U.S. intelligence budget]] (excluding the Military Intelligence Program) in fiscal year 2013 was appropriated as $52.7 billion, and reduced by the amount sequestered to $49.0 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/191-press-releases-2013/957-dni-releases-budget-figure-for-2013-national-intelligence-program|title=DNI Releases Budget Figure for 2013 National Intelligence Program|publisher=Office of the Director of National Intelligence|accessdate={{date|2 aug 2014}}|date=30 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302194422/http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/191-press-releases-2013/957-dni-releases-budget-figure-for-2013-national-intelligence-program|archive-date=2 March 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In fiscal year 2012 it peaked at $53.9 billion, according to a disclosure required under a recent law implementing recommendations of the [[9/11 Commission]].<ref>[http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/96-press-releases-2012/756-dni-releases-fy-2012-appropriated-budget-figure?highlight=YTozOntpOjA7czo2OiJidWRnZXQiO2k6MTtzOjk6ImJ1ZGdldGluZyI7aToyO3M6NzoiYnVkZ2V0cyI7fQ== DNI Releases FY 2012 Appropriated Budget Figure].
