Investigators may ignore this kind of failure because it may remain undetected for a long time.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Human error: models and management|journal = BMJ : British Medical Journal|date = 2000-03-18|issn = 0959-8138|pmc = 1117770|pmid = 10720363|pages = 768\u2013770|volume = 320|issue = 7237|first = James|last = Reason|doi=10.1136/bmj.320.7237.768}}</ref> During the investigation of latent failure, investigators have three levels to assess. The first is the factor that directly affects the operator's behavior: precondition (fatigue and illness). On February 12, 2009, [[Colgan Air Flight 3407]], a Bombardier DHC-8-400 was on approach to Buffalo-Niagara International Airport. The pilots were experiencing fatigue and their inattentiveness cost the lives of everyone on board and one person on the ground when it crashed near the airport.<ref>{{cite web|title = Aviation Accident Report AAR-10-01|url = http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/AAR1001.aspx|website = www.ntsb.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}</ref> The investigation suggested that both pilots were tired and their conversation was not related to the flight operation, which indirectly caused the accident.<ref>{{cite web|title = A double tragedy: Colgan Air Flight 3407 \u2013 Air Facts Journal|url = http://airfactsjournal.com/2014/03/double-tragedy-colgan-air-flight-3407/|website = Air Facts Journal|accessdate = 2015-10-26|language = en-US|date = 2014-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title = Crew Schedules, Sleep Deprivation, and Aviation Performance|journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science|date = 2012-04-01|issn = 0963-7214|pages = 85\u201389|volume = 21|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/0963721411435842|first = John A.|last = Caldwell}}</ref> The second level investigator will track precursors of accidents related to latent threats. On June 1, 2009, Air France Flight 447 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean and 228 people on broad were killed.

She took over the charge of the office of Vice Chancellor on 5th July 2019.\n\nLahore College for Women University, with a full time enrollment of about 15,000 students and a teaching faculty of more than 600, is one of the most prestigious institutions of Pakistan. It admits students at the Intermediate, Graduate, Masters and Ph.D. levels.\n\nAt the time of autonomy, in 1990, there were Masters classes in only six areas, but now with the University status, LCWU is offering degrees at graduate, postgraduate and doctoral levels. BS 4 year degree program is being offered in 39 disciplines and 5 years Phram-D and Architecture degree is being offered. University is offering M.A/M.Sc. in 6 subjects and MS/M.Phil degree in 28 subjects. The University is also offering Ph.D. programs in 16 disciplines i.e. Chemistry, Bio-Technology, Botany,\nZoology, Computer Science, City & Regional Planning, Mathematics, Environmental Science, Physics, Political Science, Education, Applied Psychology, Islamic Studies, Urdu, Punjabi and Fine Arts.\n\nLahore College for Women University, established in May 1922 as an intermediate residential college, was originally housed in a building on Hall Road, Lahore, with strength of 60 students (25 boarders) and 13 staff members. By 1950, the College strength increased to 600 students and was shifted to the present building on Jail Road.\nLCWU by 1922 was affiliated with the University of the Punjab for undergraduate program in 18 subjects. Within the next two years the institution had graduate programs in 14 subjects. Post graduate classes in English were initiated in 1940 and Honours classes in five subjects were introduced in 1949. B.Sc. classes started in 1955 while Post-graduate classes in the subjects of Economics and Physics started in 1966. By 1979 Islamic Studies, Political Science and Psychology were also added to the ever increasing list of programs.\n\nThe year 1990, when Administrative and Financial Autonomy was given to the institution, proved to be the turning point in the history of LCWU. On 13 August 1999, it was declared a Degree-Awarding institution. The institution was elevated to the status of a Women University on 10 September 2002.\nThe 21st century has brought a drastic revolution in science, which has completely transformed the world. Today sciences are exploring areas that defy imagination. Keeping in line with the importance of the sciences in today's world, LCWU has been fulfilling the demand of the female students in the area, as this was the only institution offering science subjects at undergraduate level. This is evident from the fact that majority of the female doctors, serving and retired, have at some stage (F.Sc. or B.Sc.) studied at Lahore College for Women. Since 1922 the college has proved its worth as the highest seat of learning for science subjects. At the moment Botany, Chemistry, Physics, Zoology, Bio-Technology, Mathematics, Economics, Statistics, Electronics, Environmental Science, Computer Science and Pharmacy are taught at Graduate, Postgraduate and Doctoral levels.\n\nLCWU is cognizant of the significance of social sciences and liberal arts since they contribute to the aesthetic sense of human beings and are essential for the society. The Department of English, being more than 70 years old, is the oldest post-graduate department of the University. Founded by Prof Mrs. U.K. Siraj-ud-Din, it still is rooted in the traditions of scholarship and academic excellence. Besides English, Urdu, Punjabi, Islamic Studies, International Relations, Political Science, Fine Arts, Pakistan Studies, Mass Communication and Gender and Development Studies are being offered at graduate and postgraduate level. The graduates of LCWU take their place in moral, intellectual and professional leadership in all walks of national life.\n\nAmong its alumni are an extra ordinary number of teachers, physicians and professionals in all fields of life. At F.A./F.Sc. level the Intermediate College of LCWU is affiliated with the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Lahore for the purpose of examinations. This Intermediate College has proved to be a very fruitful nursery in providing women force for professional education in the province.\n\nSince the establishment of LCWU as a university, the institution has striven for improvement in Higher Education. MoU with various national industries and linkages with Foreign Universities have been established in the field of Pharmacy, Electronics, Environmental Science, Fine Arts, Economics, Mass Communication and Gender & Development Studies.\n\n\n==Current Vice Chancellor - Prof. Dr. Bushra Mirza T.I==\n'''Prof. Dr. Bushra Mirza''' is the current '''Vice Chancellor''' of LCWU.

She remained a regular faculty member of Quaid-i-Azam University since 1999 till 2019 when she joined Lahore College Women University as Vice Chancellor. During this period, she has been working on several research projects. She pioneered the establishment of research laboratory to produce transgenic plants, in Quaid-i-Azam University. Her research interests include evaluation of medicinal activity of various plants and their genetic transformation for improvement. She has also been involved in analysing medicinal activities of newly synthesized compounds. \n\nTwenty two PhD and 120 M. Phil students have completed their research work successfully under her supervision. She has published more than 180 papers in the refereed journals of international repute with total impact factor and citation more than 300 and 2000 respectively. Apart from lab work, she has been interested in the bioethical aspect of Biotechnology as well and has been working at various levels in this regard. In 2001, she represented Pakistan at Salzberg Seminar \u201cBiotechnology: Legal, ethical and moral issues\u201d held at Salzburg, Austria. As a consequence of that seminar, she contributed to a book entitled \u201cCross Cultural Biotechnology\u201d published by Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. Maryland, USA in 2004.  \n\nIn 2013, she was awarded an honorary position of '''ISESCO Women Science Chair'''. In this regard she has organized several events especially for the female scientists working in OIC countries. In 2017 she participated in the joint meeting of presidents of ISESCO Women Science Chairs at ISESCO\u2019s Headquarters, Rabat, to develop a roadmap for promotion of science and technology by focusing on contribution of females in the region. Furthermore, she has been involved in volunteer work as well in different capacities.

She is very intelligent, having placed top in the nation in the college practice entrance exams at their [[cram school]]. She is popular, beautiful but constantly tries to hide this as she studies to gain entrance to Todai. However, she has an extremely fiery temper and has a tendency to inflict violent physical punishment (mostly on Keitaro).  She arrived at the Hinata Inn as a result (she believes) of her friendship with Kitsune, who introduced her to Granny Hina. At that stage she does not remember staying at the Hinata Inn as a very young child.\n\nOf all the girls at the Hinata Inn, she is most often the unwilling and unwitting victim of Keitaro's clumsiness, which often results in her ending up naked, partially clothed, or placed in any number compromising positions. Keitaro invariably suffers as a result.\n\nDespite initially taking a (literally) violent dislike to Keitaro, she comes to develop very strong feelings for him.  The main part of her character arc is that she has great difficulty in admitting these feelings, both to herself, to the hopeless Keitaro and to the world in general.  Due to this she often becomes annoyed or irritated with Keitaro when she believes he is not taking things seriously. Naru had repeatedly denied having feelings for Keitaro even when asked. Naru while speaking to Mutsumi has said \"What could you possibly see in a guy like that? You probably don't know this Mutsumi-san but he's clumsy, stupid, and a total pervert that has no redeeming qualities whatsoever!\".\nShe also says to Kanako she would definitely spy on him or sabotage any dates he did get but finds the idea of dating him herself disgusting. This comment and similar situations are played for laughs.\nWhen they do date, she hits Keitaro occasionally..\nLike Keitaro, she strives to get into Tokyo University for two reasons: the first is a promise she made to her one-time tutor (and object of an enormous crush) Noriyasu Seta, the second is the dimly recalled promise made to someone whose name and face she cannot remember.\n\n{{Voiced by2|Naru|[[Yui Horie]]|[[Dorothy Elias-Fahn|Dorothy Melendrez]]|type=tv}}<ref name=\"voices\">{{cite AV media | medium = DVD | title = Love Hina, Volume 5 - Summer By The Sea | work = Bandai | url = http://www.worldcat.org/title/love-hina-5-summer-by-the-sea/oclc/100653746&referer=brief_results | date = 2002 | isbn = 9781594097201 }}  - select Extras, Credits, page to \"Original Japanese Cast\" and \"Featuring the Voices Of\"</ref>\n\n===Mutsumi Otohime===\n{{nihongo|'''Mutsumi Otohime'''|\u4e59\u59eb \u3080\u3064\u307f|Otohime Mutsumi}} is a very sweet, gentle, kind, and soft-spoken 20-year-old girl. Naru and Keitaro first encounter her while taking some time off for a brief vacation after the three of them failed on their Todai entrance exam. Keitaro and Mutsumi failed for a third successive time, and Naru failed for the first time.\n\nDespite her ditziness, she is very intelligent and [[empathetic]]. Mutsumi also has [[anemia]] which caused all sorts of situations, but she is actually extremely resilient, having a strong vice-like grip even when she first appeared and just like Keitaro is seemingly able to recover quickly. Naru notices in both the manga and anime the similarities between Keitaro and Mutsumi many times. One such notable time was when they believed they first met Mutsumi (they are actually all friends from childhood) on Naru and Keitaro's trip to Kyoto. She has a very sweet and generous personality. Being very empathetic to others Mutsumi often puts others happiness before herself. She can also be comically clumsy at times, another trait like Keitaro. She lives on a small island off the west coast of [[Okinawa]]'s main island city [[Naha]] with her parents and seven younger siblings before moving closer to the Hinata herself. Over the course of the manga she gradually gets over her anemia to the point that in the latter parts it has left her.\n\nBoth beautiful and kind hearted, Mutsumi shows superlative optimism when faced with even the most difficult of situations. She has a number of unusual abilities, such as being able to speak \"turtlese\", which she uses to communicate with her turtles, namely Tama; the extreme habit of putting others' happiness before her own; a very strong propensity for [[watermelon]]s; and sleepwalking on a few rare occasions (which led her into trouble once as she sleepwalked out of her window and was hit by a car). Despite her many eccentricities she is ''extremely'' intelligent, scoring full marks in the practice exams. Yet she still fails to get into Tokyo University because, among other things, she forgets to write her name on the test paper, causing her to obtain a grade of Z, or fainting from her anemia.\n\nIn both manga and the anime, Mutsumi is very intuitive and has a keen eye for details, noticing things her friends do not, such as but not limited to, being the only one to know that Pararakelse island was on the opposite side of the international dateline which meant Keitaro would still be able to send his letter in time to Tokyo U and thus finally be able to attend. In the anime she is the only one who could instinctively tell Keitaro and Kaolla Su's brother (cousin) apart and knew which was which at all times excluding Keitaro and Lamba themselves.\n\nIt is revealed in volume 10 that as a young child Mutsumi spent some time living at the Hinata inn. She had learned of the stories of how if a couple was to attend Tokyo U together they will find happiness and in turn told Keitaro of the story, because she (Mutsumi) wanted to go to Tokyo U with Keitaro. She then played matchmaker for Naru and Keitaro after it became clear that Naru liked Keitaro. Mutsumi let him go for Naru's sake by deliberately losing a game of rock-paper-scissors to decide which of them would become Keitaro's wife (deliberately losing a game of rock-paper-scissors is something she would do a second time in the manga during the mock wedding started to help her regain her memory after falling from a tree while she was trying to help Naru down from the tree), although she (Mutsumi) loved Keitaro (and admits that she ''still'' loves him to Naru).\n\nBut even after that Naru had forgotten all about her promise to Keitaro, Mutsumi then made a subsequent promise with Naru that both of them would later go to Tokyo University so Naru would remember the promise made to Keitaro. Before leaving Hinata, she gave Naru her Liddo-kun doll in memory of their friendship. She eventually moves to an apartment very close to the Hinata Inn and starts working at the Hinata Teashop for Haruka Urashima, even staying in a spare room at Haruka's Teashop after her apartment burnt down on New Year's Eve. Like Keitaro and Naru, she finally passes the Todai entrance exam, discovering her result just before setting off to rescue Keitaro from the island of Pararakelse.\n\nShe studies at Todai, and later is the only one of the group to enter a graduate school. At the end of the manga she helps out in organizing Keitaro and Naru's wedding and she brings a plethora of watermelons.\n\nMutsumi is skilled at cooking and like Keitaro is exceptional at baking cakes and other confectioneries.\n\nTamago or Tama for short was originally Mutsumi's pet turtle, That she gives to Naru after she and Keitaro help her get back to her home in Okinawa.\nBut Tama's friendship with her is as strong as ever.\n\nMutsumi is also the only one of the girls to never intentionally cause physical harm to Keitaro.\n\nShe enjoys collecting photo stickers, a hobby she and Keitaro share.\n\nMutsumi is stated as being very well-endowed even though her hourglass figure is downplayed by her clothes. Her bust is the biggest of all the girls, which is used for comical effect and fan service many times throughout the anime/manga series.\n\nTokyopop sometimes misspells her name as \"Mitsumi\" or \"Matsumi\".\n\nIn the anime television series, Mutsumi is voiced by [[Satsuki Yukino]] in Japanese and [[Julie Ann Taylor]] in English.\n\n===Shinobu Maehara===\n\n{{nihongo|'''Shinobu Maehara'''|\u524d\u539f \u3057\u306e\u3076|Maehara Shinobu}} is a 13-year-old schoolgirl who, after getting off to a bad start with Keitaro, develops a crush on him. Shinobu is a boarder at the Hinata Inn, in room 201. In the anime, she is first introduced as a grieving girl who has run away from home due to domestic turmoil; however, in the manga, she is already at the Hinata Inn when Keitaro arrives and her parents are still together. Shinobu is quite skilled in both cooking and household chores, so she became the resident cook (in the anime, her family once owned a restaurant in town prior to their divorce). Quiet and shy, she contributes to her own emotional frailty.\n\nShe is the first girl to fall for Keitaro and in the manga attempts to avoid him because of this. In both the anime and manga, she thinks highly of Keitaro and will often be at the verge of tears when she thinks that he is in trouble or likes someone else. In the epilogue 4 years later she has since grown her hair out and has become more mature, though she retains her sincere personality. She still has a crush on Keitaro and hasn't given up on her dream of being his girlfriend (even though Keitaro was already set to marry Naru).\n\nThe reason Shinobu decided to leave home and live at the Hinata Inn was because of the marital problems between her father,<ref>Source: Christmas episode</ref> and her mother, whose names are never mentioned. In the anime, their marital problems lead to their divorce. Shinobu's parents arrive at the Hinata Inn and argue over who Shinobu should live with. However, Shinobu decides to remain at the Hinata Inn, to which her mother is against as she believes the Hinata Inn is a bad place full of rowdy young girls. They eventually concede, allowing Shinobu to remain living at the Inn.\n\n{{Voiced by2|Shinobu|[[Masayo Kurata]]|[[Bridget Hoffman|Ellen Arden]]|type=tv}}<ref name=\"voices\"/>\n\n===Motoko Aoyama===\n\n{{nihongo|'''Motoko Aoyama'''|\u9752\u5c71 \u7d20\u5b50|Aoyama Motoko}} is an intense 15-year-old school girl, who practices the martial art of ''[[kendo]]'', as well as being a member of the Shinmei-ry\u016b sword school (which is also referred to in Akamatsu's later work Mahou Sensei Negima, as the school of the character Setsuna). Motoko is a resident at the Hinata Inn, living in room 302.\n\nShe has difficulty relating to other people, especially men, whom she finds to be a distraction that keeps her from being able to concentrate fully on her studies and practice. She also dislikes men because her sister left the dojo to marry. Her relationship with Keitaro initially resembles Naru's relationship with him in some ways; all too often he finds himself on the receiving end of various attacks as a result of his frequent mishaps or simply bad luck. She eventually warms up to him somewhat and eventually finds herself developing strong feelings for him which she vehemently denies until near the end of the series. On two occasions this causes severe problems for both Motoko and Keitaro. In later volumes she develops a habit of writing trashy romance stories involving the two of them, often involuntarily.\n\nMotoko has an older sister, Tsuruko, who gave up the life of the sword to marry. Tsuruko is far stronger at kendo than Motoko; Motoko both greatly admires and fears her older sister.  However, Tsuruko believes that Motoko has more potential than she herself does, and that Motoko lost her drive to improve when Tsuruko married.  Motoko is also the next in line to inherit the Aoyama family's Kyoto dojo as she is not married.  It is notable that Tsuruko is actually Motoko's biological sister as they are two of the few characters in the series who are siblings by blood relation (the second siblings couple is presented by Kaolla and Amalla Su).\n\nMotoko has only two serious fears in the world: Tsuruko and, for some unspecified reason, turtles (even though Tsuruko correlates it to her intense dislike for men).\n\nIn the anime, Motoko is popular at her school for her kendo skills. She frequently spends time with {{nihongo|'''Sachiyo Matsumoto'''|\u677e\u672c \u5e78\u4ee3|Matsumoto Sachiyo}}, {{nihongo|'''Emi Ichikawa'''|\u5e02\u5ddd \u3048\u307f|Ichikawa Emi}} and {{nihongo|'''Kikuko Onoue'''|\u5c3e\u4e0a \u83ca\u5b50|Onoue Kikuko}}, who are all fans of her. Kikuko is especially protective of Motoko and has criticised Motoko's change in personality and decline in kendo skills since Keitaro began living at Hinata Inn, referring to him as a distraction.\n{{Voiced by2|Motoko|[[Y\u016b Asakawa]]|[[Mona Marshall]]|type=tv}}\n\n===Kaolla Su===\n{{nihongo|'''Kaolla Su'''|\u30ab\u30aa\u30e9\u30fb\u30b9\u30a5|Kaora S\u016b}} is a 13-year-old foreign transfer student. She is also a boarder at the Hinata Inn, in room 301.\n\nSu is the princess of Molmol, a fictional island nation located near the [[International Date Line]]. The dot on her forehead seems to have something to do with the 3-eyed symbol of Molmol. She is often barefoot and dressed in nothing else except her heavily altered school uniform in almost every anime episode and manga chapter, or some otherwise scant costume. To top her personality, she is above all extremely hyperactive, usually hugging (or, in Keitaro's case, kicking) someone, trying to eat something, especially bananas and/or Tama-chan, or inventing some potentially dangerous new device. She also has a tendency to snuggle against a person while she is sleeping and usually crushes them while doing it.\n\nMolmol is a kingdom where the moon sometimes appears red. It also uses a western naming order, although the Hinata Inn residents never seem to pick this up until later: Su is actually Kaolla Su's family name.\n\nSu likes all the other residents in the Hinata Apartments and gets along well with them, though they have difficulty keeping up with her hyperactive tendencies; only the athletic Motoko seems to be able to tolerate and keep up with her. Her like for Keitaro stems from the fact that he reminds her of the person she refers to as her older brother (actually her cousin, whom she grew up with). However, it can be inferred that she eventually comes to care about Keitaro as much as and perhaps even more than her older brother.\n\nWhile she has stated that she likes everyone in the Hinata apartments (including Sarah, who was sent there for a short period of time), it is apparent that Kaolla shares a much deeper relationship with Sarah and Motoko as compared to the other residents. Her ambition is to return to her homeland to start a computing school and transform her country into a technological power that will rival, and eventually conquer, Japan.\n\nAs if her never ending energy, strange customs, and mechanical finesse were not strange enough, Su also possesses the ability to transform into a more adult version of herself on a single night every year, when the moon glows red. In the anime, she admitted to have fallen in love with Keitaro while she was in this form, despite her transformation just last a few seconds because there was no red moon. Though this is not explicitly stated in the manga, it is implied extremely heavily with the adult Su even kissing Keitaro and proclaiming herself his girlfriend afterwards.\n\nHer room in the Hinata Inn is a faithful recreation of Molmol's natural habitat, complete with banana trees, a waterfall, and a small lake, along with a high-tech laboratory. {{Voiced by2|Su|[[Reiko Takagi]]|[[Wendee Lee]]|type=tv}}<ref name=\"voices\"/>\n\n===Mitsune \"Kitsune\" Konno===\n\n{{nihongo|'''Mitsune Konno'''|\u7d3a\u91ce \u307f\u3064\u306d|Konno Mitsune}}, also known as [[Kitsune]], which means \"fox\" in Japanese, is a 19-year-old freelance writer (who never seems to write anything). She is frequently drunk and seems to enjoy teasing Keitaro at every opportunity. Kitsune is also a boarder at the Hinata Inn, in room 205. She rarely pays any rent or contributes and  has had a number of low paying jobs. Despite this she has never been evicted from the lodge. Her best friend is Naru. Although Naru is the more intellectual of the two, Kitsune is often the one to see things sensibly (although often she will encourage madness out of boredom), though she usually tries to reason when things are really out of control.\nHer nickname comes from a combination of her first and last names, and the fact that she hardly ever fully opens both eyes at the same time (mostly when she is surprised). As a result, she has a perpetually fox-like, vulpine expression. She's a practical joker and troublemaker; her mission in life seems to be to ensure that things never get too dull or those around her too complacent. She is also seen drinking a lot. She speaks with a [[Kansai dialect]]. In the [[manga]] (Volume 4) Kitsune's bedroom walls are densely lined with bottles of alcoholic drinks. She is also the one who taught Kaolla Japanese.\n\nKitsune is more flirtatious, especially with Keitaro, than any of the other residents. Mostly this is to tease him; however, she does develop a strong crush on him; eventually she shows little serious romantic interest in him. She is also the bustiest in the household, her bust being second only to Mutsumi Otohime in size, and is unafraid of using her charms to get what she wants, whatever it might be. Her relationship with Keitaro eventually develops into a \"little brother/big sister\" connection (though Keitaro is actually older than she is).\n\nShe also is a bit greedy, as seen in a flashback sequence when she tells Keitaro about how much Naru's innocence ended up dismissing possible boyfriends; Kitsune was shown to encourage her to date a rich boy just because of his wealth. Also, when the girls are traveling to Molmol to try and bring Keitaro back to Hinata Inn, the only thing she thinks of is the inheritance that will be left to him and the girl that he chooses whenever Hina returns, even though, later on, Kitsune lets him stay with Naru. She eventually takes over the Hinata Tea House when Haruka leaves and picks up Haruka's habit of smoking.  Between the start and the finish Kitsune held two other jobs.  Her name is derived from the name of manga artist [[Mitsune Ayasaka]].<ref name=\"manga artist\"/> {{Voiced by2|Kitsune|[[Junko Noda]]|[[Barbara Goodson]]|type=tv}}<ref name=\"voices\"/>\n\n==Relatives==\n\n===Haruka Urashima===\n\n{{nihongo|'''Haruka Urashima'''|\u6d66\u5cf6 \u306f\u308b\u304b|Urashima Haruka}} is Keitaro Urashima's \"aunt\" (actually his cousin). In the anime she dislikes being called aunt by Keitaro and often smashes him in the face when she is referred to as and corrects him by saying \"its Haruka-san\" (san being a respectful term to your elder in most cases)\n\nHaruka Urashima is the only child of Hinata Urashima's eldest daughter, Yoko Urashima; her second daughter was Keitaro's mother. After the death of Yoko, Hinata adopted her granddaughter. Therefore, Haruka is Keitaro's legal aunt in addition to being his actual cousin.<ref>{{cite book |title=Love Hina Mugendai |year=2002 |publisher=Kodansha |isbn=4-06-334578-5 |page= 26}}</ref> It was as a teenager that, while working at the inn, she was first called \"Aunty Haruka\" by her baby cousin Keitaro&nbsp;\u2013 the same time that Keitaro first met both Mutsumi and Naru.\n\nHaruka is the ''ry\u014dbo'' (\"house-mother\") of the ''Joshi Seny\u014d Ry\u014d Hinata-s\u014d'' (\"Women's Only Dormitory, Hinata House\") and runs the ''Waf\u016b Chab\u014d Hinata'' (\"Traditional Japanese Tea-Room Hinata\"). Haruka is constantly seen smoking a cigarette. Like Naru, she has a fiery temper (and great physical prowess to match), which she hides under a calm, detached exterior.\n\nHaving traveled the world with Seta and Sara's mom, and it is hinted that a love triangle existed between the three at one point (or at least that Haruka and Seta were romantically involved); this is explored more fully in the manga, to the point that Haruka and Seta get married. Haruka's skills in martial arts rival Seta's and can even surpass his when she is angry. She is also very skilled with firearms, which shows when she shoots Kaolla's missiles at Seta's head after being teased by him. {{Voiced by2|Haruka|[[Megumi Hayashibara]]|[[Mari Devon|Jane Alan]]|type-tv}}<ref name=\"voices\"/>\n\n===Hinata Urashima===\n{{nihongo|'''Hinata Urashima'''|\u6d66\u5cf6 \u3072\u306a\u305f|Urashima Hinata}}, also known as Grandma Hina, is the original manager of Hinata.

Like Keitaro, he was a third-year ''ronin''. He's clumsy&nbsp;\u2014 especially with women, and his relationship to Haruka seems to be similar to Keitaro's relationship with Naru (i.e. both get physically thrashed around by their respective female and are married to them eventually as well as both of them apparently being invulnerable to just about everything), a terrible driver (his arrival often heralded by his van crashing down from the sky), and an exceptionally skilled martial artist, all partly due to his complete lack of self-preservation. Seta spends a good deal of his time traveling the world on one expedition or another. His goal seems to be to find evidence of the ancient turtle civilization that once flourished throughout east Asia.\n\nSeta is also something of an adventurer, and possesses a van that shares his indestructible nature, and apparently has a submarine mode. In the past, Haruka had a major crush on him, though he seemed oblivious. They went on many expeditions together. Along with them on the expeditions was Sara's mother, an [[Americans|American]] that looked remarkably like Naru, who later died. Her last request was that Seta marry Haruka. This wish was granted, and Haruka and Seta married at the ruins of Todai, capital of the Turtle civilization. Seta is Sara's guardian, and she refers to him as \"papa.\"\n\nSeta is most probably a practitioner of ''[[Jeet Kune Do]]''{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}.

There, she develops a close friendship with Su, most likely because of their shared disdain for the general order of things. In both the manga and anime version, Sarah even comments on how \"Kaolla and I are not Japanese!\" during a meal, when Motoko forces them all&nbsp;\u2013 sans Naru, who is in a field trip to Kyoto&nbsp;\u2013 to have a samurai-like diet. Sara quickly becomes Su's new playmate, taking the place of Motoko, who was the only person in the house to keep up with Su's energy. Sara and Su eventually become so close they change their hairstyles to match, both of them with two pigtails. Sara eventually does return to travelling with Seta after his marriage to Haruka.\n\nSarah has an uncle in California; in the anime, it was implied that she had stayed with, and been the victim of abuse, at the hands of her biological relatives. Her mother, now deceased, formerly worked with Seta and Haruka on an archaeological dig and competed for Seta's romantic attention.\n\nSara possesses no unusual talents or skills, save for a certain gift for ''[[Jeet Kune Do]]'' learned from Seta, though she is adept at bashing Keitaro on the head with priceless artifacts [[Hammerspace|often pulled out of nowhere]]. She has a panda-shaped birthmark on her buttocks, which she avoids showing at all costs. She shares her family name with Cynthia McDougal from Ken Akamatsu's previous manga series ''[[A.I.

Kanako is a master of disguise and is able to impersonate anyone, which she uses to try to get control over the Hinata Inn (Keitaro is the only one who can see through her disguise at simple view), and she also has a strong fable and skills in [[Japanese bondage]] techniques. Kanako never came to see Keitaro as a brother, and had loved him since they were children. When they promised to run an inn together when they grew up, she had assumed it would be as husband and wife. However, Keitaro does not share these thoughts and only sees her as a sister.\n\nShe first appears in Volume 11 in the manga, and in the ''Love Hina Again'' OVA. Her appearance is often accompanied by the sound of a bell carried on the tail of her unusual cat Kuro.\n\nAfter travelling with her grandmother for some years, she returns to Japan to fulfill her promise to her brother to run an inn together. She arrives while Keitaro was away in the United States, and after assuming control, immediately changes the Hinata Inn from a girls' dormitory back into an inn. The residents are forced to either stay and work for her, or to leave.\n\nShe soon realizes that all of the girls in Hinata Inn have some sort of affection for her brother, and tests their affection in a variety of ways. She then tries to drive them away by being as mean and cruel as she could to them. At first it seemed to be working, as one by one everyone but Naru left the new Hinata Inn. When the girls (except for Naru) start to suspect Kanako's feelings for Keitaro and why she forces them to be mean to him, they form the \"Hinata House Liberation Front\" in order to reclaim the Inn. Kanako, Naru and Mutsumi form the ''Hinata-r\u014dshi'' (\u65e5\u5411\u6d6a\u58eb, translated as \"Hinata Rebel Alliance\") to reclaim it under the name ''Urashima Kanako-no-suke'' (\u6d66\u5cf6\u53ef\u5948\u5b50\u4e4b\u52a9). <!--seen in Chapter 96 (Make as reference)-->\n\nEven without knowing her, Kanako had harbored a deep hatred for the little girl to which Keitaro promised to go to Tokyo University with, as she believes that the promise is what plagued his life with bad luck. As such, she believed that by eliminating this girl, the \"curse\" would be lifted. At first, she thought that Kitsune, who was leading the \"Liberation Front\", was this girl, but in the nick of time, Naru ended up revealing that she was most likely the girl. Disheartened for having trusted her unwilling sworn enemy, Kanako attempted to sabotage Naru's relationship with Keitaro upon his return. However, in the end, she recognized that it was Naru whom he liked, and reluctantly accepts their relationship. {{Voiced by2|Kanako|[[Natsuko Kuwatani]]|[[Melissa Fahn]]|type=tv}}\n\n==Minor characters==\n\n===Amalla Su===\n{{nihongo|'''Amalla Su'''|\u30a2\u30de\u30e9\u30fb\u30b9\u30a5|Amara S\u016b}} is Kaolla Su's older sister. She has long white hair, blue eyes, and wears an outfit resembling that of an [[India]]n/[[Arab]]ian princess. Both she and her sister are [[magical girl]]s, and both are members of the royal family of the kingdom of Molmol. Amalla has been in love with cousin Crown Prince Lamba Lu for a long time, but has never admitted her feelings to him. She speaks Japanese in an [[Edokko]] accent, and claims to be from the deserts of [[Edo]] (Edo is an old name for [[Tokyo]], which of course has no deserts). In combat, she possesses two weapons: a magical flute that controls the weather, and her pet albino alligator Shiro. She is referenced in the manga and has several appearances in the anime. {{Voiced by2|Amalla|[[Aya Hisakawa]]|[[Wendee Lee]]|type=tv}}\n\n===Lamba Lu===\n\"Brother\" to Amalla and Kaolla. In reality, he is a cousin of theirs, but they have grown up as siblings. He is the king of their nation, and in the tradition of their people, he has to serve in the military for a period of time. Before that happens, he is required to marry. Once when Kaolla was a very young girl he promised to marry her, but then he realises that she only sees him as a brother, whereas Amalla is in love with him. He marries Amalla instead.\n\nLamba Lu looks almost exactly like Keitaro when they both have their glasses on; the only striking differences are that he's a bit more tanned than Keitaro is, has darker hair and dark green eyes, and a somewhat [[India]]n/[[South Asia]]n appearance. Unlike Keitaro, however, Lamba Lu is very calm, collected, and 'together', and not at all clumsy or awkward.\n\nWhile Lamba Lu does not appear explicitly in the manga, he does interact with Keitaro at one point and has a different role. In volume 14, Keitaro receives a letter from Lamba Lu inviting the former ''ronin'' to take part in a joint research project between Tokyo University and the University of Molmol (in which case Lamba Lu is actually the chairman of the joint research project) on the Lost Todai Ruins. {{Voiced by2|Lamba|[[Y\u016bji Ueda]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]]|type=tv}}\n\n===Kentaro Sakata===\n{{nihongo|'''Kentaro Sakata'''|\u5742\u7530 \u5065\u592a\u6717|Sakata Kentar\u014d}}, an anime-specific character, had a crush on Naru. Originally Keitaro's rival for Narusegawa, he eventually loses all of his money in his pursuit of her. He remained fairly tenacious for a time, but eventually gave up after getting deep into debt with the Hinata Inn. Haruka let him try to work off his debts at a very low pay rate of $1.50 an hour; from that point on, Kentaro became an occasional background character and plot device, like giving advice to Keitaro and supporting his feelings for Narusegawa.\n\nAlso, Kentaro has been repeatedly mispronounced as 'Keitaro' by the residents, and occasionally by himself, mainly before they grew too familiar with him. Strangely enough though, he has absolutely nothing, besides his original affection for Naru, in common with Keitaro. {{Voiced by2|Kentaro|[[Ryotaro Okiayu]]|Steve Areno|type=tv}}\n\n===Mei Narusegawa===\n{{nihongo|'''Mei Narusegawa'''|\u6210\u702c\u5ddd \u30e1\u30a4|Narusegawa Mei}} is Naru's younger sister. Naru describes her as her \"half-sister\" in manga volumes 11 and 14. On the other hand, in the anime, episode 22, Mei said \"My father married her mother.\" This leads some to speculate that they are stepsisters, although this is never confirmed. She initially tries to get Keitaro and Mutsumi together in the hopes that Naru would return home if Keitaro were taken. She gives up on this when she and Naru clear up a few family misconceptions. Also, in ''Love Hina Again'', she makes a very brief appearance to help all the Hinata residents about Keitaro and Naru's relationship & help speed it up. She also appears in the last volume of the manga, seen standing off on the side with the rest of the residents of Hinata Inn while Naru is chasing Keitaro down after accidentally undressing her. She also plays a minor role in the Spring Movie.\n\nMei was created for and appears primarily in the ''Love Hina'' anime, though she is referred to in at least two places in the manga and is seen in the last chapter of the final volume of the manga. {{Voiced by2|Mei|[[Yuri Shiratori]]|[[Rebecca Forstadt]]|type=tv}}\n\n===Tsuruko Aoyama===\n{{nihongo|'''Tsuruko Aoyama'''|\u9752\u5c71 \u9db4\u5b50|Aoyama Tsuruko}} is Motoko's older sister and the one currently entrusted with the keeping of their family's Shinmeiryuu tradition. She is not active in running the school, having given up the life of the sword for marriage, and it is her duty to hand the school over to Motoko's care when the time comes.\n\nThough Motoko has lived in fear of Tsuruko for years, Tsuruko has Motoko's best interests at heart and her only real wish is for her sister to be happy on whatever path she chooses to walk. Unfortunately, she has a habit of trying to kill her sister when she lies to her (when she tried to take Motoko back to Kyoto and, to prevent this, she pretended to be engaged with Keitaro) or does not tell her the full details of a situation (when Motoko admitted that she flunked the Todai admittance exam). She also gets into a bloodthirsty mood whenever Motoko is lazy and does not do her best (this is only seen in a nightmare sequence of Motoko).\n\nWhile her usual appearance is that of a very proper lady well versed in Japanese culture, she sometimes has the eyes of a demon and becomes extremely violent. She is an incredible swordswoman whom few could hope to face, even though she abandoned the dojo after getting married. She is a very serious character, but also very just and in her own weird way, only cares for the well being of her sister.\n\nShe has a beautiful pet [[Crane (bird)|crane]] named \"Shippu\", which she later gives to Motoko in the thirteenth volume after Motoko finally defeats her. Like her sister, her sword techniques are centered around the destruction of evil, using ki attacks with her slash, some of them hurting only evil beings, but mostly slashing through rocks, people or larger objects (like a sports car, driven by Kentaro, that was 'accidentally' about to run over Keitaro&nbsp;\u2013 in the manga, it was a truck whose driver was drunk and sleepy) as if they were made of paper. {{Voiced by2|Tsuruko|[[Miki Nagasawa]]|[[Philece Sampler]]|type=tv}}\n\n===Kimiaki Shirai===\n{{nihongo|'''Kimiaki Shirai'''|\u767d\u4e95 \u529f\u660e|Shirai Kimiaki}} is one of Keitaro's friends. He loves to make fun of Keitaro, calling him a failure in girls and academics, but pulls back later on when Keitaro becomes more successful. He almost always appears with Haitani. His main interests are in women, and one of his only upside is some degree of skill in computers. He also seems to have an interest in older woman like Haruka. He is short, and is almost always shown with big round glasses. In the manga's fifth volume, Su even calls him a \"small, fat, Hobbit\". {{Voiced by2|Shirai|[[Michio Miyashita]]|[[Gene Holliday]]|type=tv}}\n\n===Masayuki Haitani===\n{{nihongo|'''Masayuki Haitani'''|\u7070\u8c37 \u771f\u4e4b|Haitani Masayuki}} is one of Keitaro's friends, and is (apart from a few physical differences) almost exactly like Shirai. He is taller, wearing tiny round glasses, and enters a university before Shirai or Keitaro. Like Shirai, Haitani's primary interests lie in women, relying on his charm to attract female attention, but to no avail. He appears to be the leader of the trio, formulating many schemes to gain girlfriends for himself, Keitaro, and Shirai (despite Keitaro's reluctance to go along with them), most notably the Hinata tenants, but they end in constant failure, getting them into trouble (if not all three, then only Keitaro) with the girls. {{Voiced by2|Haitani|[[Hiroyuki Yoshino]]|[[Steven Blum]]|type=tv}}\n\n===Ema Maeda===\n{{nihongo|'''Ema Maeda'''|\u771f\u679d \u7d75\u99ac|Maeda Ema}} appears in the epilogue of the ''Love Hina'' manga, Volume 14, which is set three years (four in the English manga) after the end of the main storyline.\n\nA timid 15-year-old girl who dabbles in conspiracy theories, Ema hopes to get into Tokyo University so she can improve her life and have people notice her. Due to her poor grades, she left home in order to live at the \"legendary\" Hinata Inn, which is believed to have the power to get anyone into Tokyo University. Being very clumsy, her arrival at the Hinata Inn mirrors Keitaro's initial arrival, as she is mistaken for a peeping tom and is chased out of the hot springs. In awe of all the beautiful girls living at the Hinata Inn, she accidentally steals Naru's wedding veil, tripping a theft alarm in the process. She is rescued by and flees with Keitaro. Despite a shaky first day, everything is set right when she is given a thank you kiss by Naru for finding and returning both her veil and groom. She then realizes that she can achieve her dreams if she tries hard enough. She has a pet [[chameleon]] named Leon.\n\n===Nyamo Namo===\n{{nihongo|'''Nyamo Namo'''|\u30cb\u30e3\u30e2\u30fb\u30ca\u30fc\u30e2|Nyamo N\u0101mo}} is a young girl of the island Pararakelse. Her grandfather was once an acquaintance of Seta, and after her grandfather's death, Nyamo decided to work with Seta on his excavations to continue her grandfather's work. Nyamo is physically almost identical to Shinobu, except for her darker skin and longer hair. She also shares a number of other traits with Shinobu as well, including her extreme initial shyness and reluctance to speak and a crush on Keitaro (which is shown when she glomps Keitaro in her second appearance and for which Naru punches him into the ground for \"assaulting\" Nyamo). She also seems to have developed a fear of Naru after seeing her bludgeon Keitaro into the air (even hiding behind her giant tortoise when she saw Naru afterwards) though she is also very hard to surprise, often having the same innocent quizzical expression in any situation. Nyamo and Shinobu quickly become good friends and correspond when apart. In the manga, when she visits the Hinata Dorms, she brings with her a pet giant [[tortoise]] named Gidget. {{Voiced by2|Nyamo|[[Nana Mizuki]]|[[Michelle Ruff]]|type=tv}}\n\n===Ken Akamatsu===\n{{nihongo|'''Ken Akamatsu'''|\u8d64\u677e \u5065|Akamatsu Ken}} makes brief cameo appearances in the anime television series and Love Hina Specials, serving as a minor plot device character. He is referred as Akamatsu Sensei, and is voiced by Akamatsu himself.\n\n==Animals/Pets==\n\n===Tama-chan===\n{{nihongo|'''Tama'''|\u30bf\u30de}} (in full {{nihongo||\u6e29\u6cc9 \u305f\u307e\u3054|Onsen Tamago|lit. \"Hot Springs Egg\"}} is the turtle given to Keitaro by Mutsumi. Keitaro points out that the turtle is male, but the girls are convinced he is a 'she' and so 'he' is referred to as 'she' throughout the manga. She is an 'onsen kame' or hot-springs turtle, and like others of her species, it appears that she can fly. Su, Mutsumi, Seta, and (later in the series) Keitaro appear to have the ability to speak with Tama-chan, and Su occasionally develops the urge to eat her, though sometimes it is just to tease Shinobu (in the manga, it is said on a side note that Su drops this habit in order to wait for Tama-chan to reproduce). She appears in ''[[Negima]]'' on [[Characters of Negima (16-31)#Chizuru Naba|Chizuru Naba]]'s apron on the back cover of volume 8, in chapter 85 of volume 10, and in other places as pictures. {{Voiced by2|Tama|Yukie Maeda|[[Wendee Lee]]|type=tv}}\n\n===Mecha-Tama-chan===\nSu, convinced she is going to have to face Tama-chan down at some point (Su wants to eat her), has designed multiple mechanical versions of Tama. Every Mecha-Tama has turned out to be dangerous to the residents of the Hinata Inn.\n* Mecha-Tama-Chan 0 (a prototype): Volume 11\n* Mecha-Tama-chan 1: Volume 5\n* Mecha-Tama-chan 2: Volume 5\n* Mecha-Tama-chan Mark 3: Volume 7\n* Mecha-Tama-chan 4: Volume 8\n* Mecha-Tamago 5: Volume 13\n* Mecha-Tama-chan 6: Volume 14\n* Mecha-Tama-chan 30: Volume 14\n\nApparently, Su has been developing Mecha Tama-chans during the three years that pass since the end of the main story until the marriage of Keitaro and Naru, the latest version being the 30th. Kanako Urashima somehow gets a hold of Su's prototype Mecha-Tama in her reign over the house in volume 11, and is probably the only time someone other than Su used a Mecha-Tama, aside from Naru in volume 7 while trying to keep Keitaro and Mutsumi apart.\n\n===Kuro===\n{{nihongo|'''Kuro'''|\u30af\u30ed|Kuro lit. Black}} is a black cat with huge ears which follows Kanako. It first appears in book 11 in the manga, and in the ''Love Hina Again'' OVA. It becomes friends with Tama-chan. Kaolla is very interested in researching it and Sarah calls him \"witch cat\" after knowing about Kuro's unusual abilities to fly (using its oversized ears) and talk. In the anime, Kuro can talk, but in the manga, instead of Kuro being able to talk, it is just Kanako's ventriloquism. It carries a bell on its tail, which sounds as characteristic when Kanako appears.\nAs a footnote, Ken Akamatsu explained in his notes in Volume 14, page 148 that Tama, Kuro, Shippu, and Leon were inspired by the \"[[Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Four Legendary Animals of Japanese Mythology]]\". Tama was inspired by [[Black Tortoise|Genbu]], Kuro by [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|Byakko]], Shippu by [[Vermilion Bird|Suzaku]], and Leon by [[Azure Dragon|Seiryuu]]. {{Voiced by2|Kuro|[[Yuki Matsuoka]]|[[Sandy Fox]]|type=tv}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Love Hina}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Love Hina Characters}}\n[[Category:Love Hina]]\n[[Category:Lists of anime and manga characters|Love Hina characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Love Hina'' characters}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=February 2009}}\n{{tone|date=January 2009}}\n}}\n\nThis is a list of [[Character (arts)|fictional characters]] in the [[anime]] and [[manga]] series ''[[Love Hina]]'' created by [[Ken Akamatsu]].

As a child, the young Keitaro made a promise with a girl, based on a story the children overheard that two people who love each other will live \"happily ever after\" if they enter 'Todai'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Akamatsu |first=Ken |authorlink=Ken Akamatsu |title=Love Hina, Volume 1 |publisher=[[TokyoPop]] |date=2002-05-07 |pages=7\u20138 |isbn=1-931514-94-1 }}</ref>  Keitaro is set on gaining entrance to Todai to fulfill the promise he made to his childhood friend, even though he cannot properly remember either her name or her face. Later, in volume 13, it is revealed that Todai may not even refer to Tokyo University after all.\n\nAfter failing to pass the entrance exams on his second attempt Keitaro's parents seem either unwilling, or unable, to let him continue living at home while he studies. He then receives a call from his grandmother. As a result, he travels to \"Hinata Inn\", a hotel owned by his grandmother to find a place to stay and study.<ref>{{cite book |last=Akamatsu |first=Ken |authorlink=Ken Akamatsu |title=Love Hina, Volume 1 |publisher=[[TokyoPop]] |date=2002-05-07 |pages=8\u201311 |isbn=1-931514-94-1 }}</ref> Following a misunderstanding where the residents believe him to be a burglar and peeping tom, Keitaro discovers the hotel is now a female-only dormitory.<ref>{{cite book |last=Akamatsu |first=Ken |authorlink=Ken Akamatsu |title=Love Hina, Volume 1 |publisher=[[TokyoPop]] |date=2002-05-07 |page=26 |isbn=1-931514-94-1 }}</ref>\n\nTo compound the confusion, Keitaro's Aunt Haruka mistakenly assumes he has passed the entrance exams and is already a Todai student; consequently the residents agree he can stay.

She is very intelligent, having placed top in the nation in the college practice entrance exams at their [[cram school]]. She is popular, beautiful but constantly tries to hide this as she studies to gain entrance to Todai. However, she has an extremely fiery temper and has a tendency to inflict violent physical punishment (mostly on Keitaro).  She arrived at the Hinata Inn as a result (she believes) of her friendship with Kitsune, who introduced her to Granny Hina. At that stage she does not remember staying at the Hinata Inn as a very young child.\n\nOf all the girls at the Hinata Inn, she is most often the unwilling and unwitting victim of Keitaro's clumsiness, which often results in her ending up naked, partially clothed, or placed in any number compromising positions. Keitaro invariably suffers as a result.\n\nDespite initially taking a (literally) violent dislike to Keitaro, she comes to develop very strong feelings for him.  The main part of her character arc is that she has great difficulty in admitting these feelings, both to herself, to the hopeless Keitaro and to the world in general.  Due to this she often becomes annoyed or irritated with Keitaro when she believes he is not taking things seriously. Naru had repeatedly denied having feelings for Keitaro even when asked. Naru while speaking to Mutsumi has said \"What could you possibly see in a guy like that? You probably don't know this Mutsumi-san but he's clumsy, stupid, and a total pervert that has no redeeming qualities whatsoever!\".\nShe also says to Kanako she would definitely spy on him or sabotage any dates he did get but finds the idea of dating him herself disgusting. This comment and similar situations are played for laughs.\nWhen they do date, she hits Keitaro occasionally..\nLike Keitaro, she strives to get into Tokyo University for two reasons: the first is a promise she made to her one-time tutor (and object of an enormous crush) Noriyasu Seta, the second is the dimly recalled promise made to someone whose name and face she cannot remember.\n\n{{Voiced by2|Naru|[[Yui Horie]]|[[Dorothy Elias-Fahn|Dorothy Melendrez]]|type=tv}}<ref name=\"voices\">{{cite AV media | medium = DVD | title = Love Hina, Volume 5 - Summer By The Sea | work = Bandai | url = http://www.worldcat.org/title/love-hina-5-summer-by-the-sea/oclc/100653746&referer=brief_results | date = 2002 | isbn = 9781594097201 }}  - select Extras, Credits, page to \"Original Japanese Cast\" and \"Featuring the Voices Of\"</ref>\n\n===Mutsumi Otohime===\n{{nihongo|'''Mutsumi Otohime'''|\u4e59\u59eb \u3080\u3064\u307f|Otohime Mutsumi}} is a very sweet, gentle, kind, and soft-spoken 20-year-old girl. Naru and Keitaro first encounter her while taking some time off for a brief vacation after the three of them failed on their Todai entrance exam. Keitaro and Mutsumi failed for a third successive time, and Naru failed for the first time.\n\nDespite her ditziness, she is very intelligent and [[empathetic]]. Mutsumi also has [[anemia]] which caused all sorts of situations, but she is actually extremely resilient, having a strong vice-like grip even when she first appeared and just like Keitaro is seemingly able to recover quickly. Naru notices in both the manga and anime the similarities between Keitaro and Mutsumi many times. One such notable time was when they believed they first met Mutsumi (they are actually all friends from childhood) on Naru and Keitaro's trip to Kyoto. She has a very sweet and generous personality. Being very empathetic to others Mutsumi often puts others happiness before herself. She can also be comically clumsy at times, another trait like Keitaro. She lives on a small island off the west coast of [[Okinawa]]'s main island city [[Naha]] with her parents and seven younger siblings before moving closer to the Hinata herself. Over the course of the manga she gradually gets over her anemia to the point that in the latter parts it has left her.\n\nBoth beautiful and kind hearted, Mutsumi shows superlative optimism when faced with even the most difficult of situations. She has a number of unusual abilities, such as being able to speak \"turtlese\", which she uses to communicate with her turtles, namely Tama; the extreme habit of putting others' happiness before her own; a very strong propensity for [[watermelon]]s; and sleepwalking on a few rare occasions (which led her into trouble once as she sleepwalked out of her window and was hit by a car). Despite her many eccentricities she is ''extremely'' intelligent, scoring full marks in the practice exams. Yet she still fails to get into Tokyo University because, among other things, she forgets to write her name on the test paper, causing her to obtain a grade of Z, or fainting from her anemia.\n\nIn both manga and the anime, Mutsumi is very intuitive and has a keen eye for details, noticing things her friends do not, such as but not limited to, being the only one to know that Pararakelse island was on the opposite side of the international dateline which meant Keitaro would still be able to send his letter in time to Tokyo U and thus finally be able to attend. In the anime she is the only one who could instinctively tell Keitaro and Kaolla Su's brother (cousin) apart and knew which was which at all times excluding Keitaro and Lamba themselves.\n\nIt is revealed in volume 10 that as a young child Mutsumi spent some time living at the Hinata inn. She had learned of the stories of how if a couple was to attend Tokyo U together they will find happiness and in turn told Keitaro of the story, because she (Mutsumi) wanted to go to Tokyo U with Keitaro. She then played matchmaker for Naru and Keitaro after it became clear that Naru liked Keitaro. Mutsumi let him go for Naru's sake by deliberately losing a game of rock-paper-scissors to decide which of them would become Keitaro's wife (deliberately losing a game of rock-paper-scissors is something she would do a second time in the manga during the mock wedding started to help her regain her memory after falling from a tree while she was trying to help Naru down from the tree), although she (Mutsumi) loved Keitaro (and admits that she ''still'' loves him to Naru).\n\nBut even after that Naru had forgotten all about her promise to Keitaro, Mutsumi then made a subsequent promise with Naru that both of them would later go to Tokyo University so Naru would remember the promise made to Keitaro. Before leaving Hinata, she gave Naru her Liddo-kun doll in memory of their friendship. She eventually moves to an apartment very close to the Hinata Inn and starts working at the Hinata Teashop for Haruka Urashima, even staying in a spare room at Haruka's Teashop after her apartment burnt down on New Year's Eve. Like Keitaro and Naru, she finally passes the Todai entrance exam, discovering her result just before setting off to rescue Keitaro from the island of Pararakelse.\n\nShe studies at Todai, and later is the only one of the group to enter a graduate school. At the end of the manga she helps out in organizing Keitaro and Naru's wedding and she brings a plethora of watermelons.\n\nMutsumi is skilled at cooking and like Keitaro is exceptional at baking cakes and other confectioneries.\n\nTamago or Tama for short was originally Mutsumi's pet turtle, That she gives to Naru after she and Keitaro help her get back to her home in Okinawa.\nBut Tama's friendship with her is as strong as ever.\n\nMutsumi is also the only one of the girls to never intentionally cause physical harm to Keitaro.\n\nShe enjoys collecting photo stickers, a hobby she and Keitaro share.\n\nMutsumi is stated as being very well-endowed even though her hourglass figure is downplayed by her clothes. Her bust is the biggest of all the girls, which is used for comical effect and fan service many times throughout the anime/manga series.\n\nTokyopop sometimes misspells her name as \"Mitsumi\" or \"Matsumi\".\n\nIn the anime television series, Mutsumi is voiced by [[Satsuki Yukino]] in Japanese and [[Julie Ann Taylor]] in English.\n\n===Shinobu Maehara===\n\n{{nihongo|'''Shinobu Maehara'''|\u524d\u539f \u3057\u306e\u3076|Maehara Shinobu}} is a 13-year-old schoolgirl who after getting off to a bad start with Keitaro, develops a crush on him. Shinobu is a boarder at the Hinata Inn, in room 201. In the anime, she is first introduced as a grieving girl who has run away from home due to domestic turmoil; however, in the manga, she is already at the Hinata Inn when Keitaro arrives and her parents are still together. Shinobu is quite skilled in both cooking and household chores, so she became the resident cook (in the anime, her family once owned a restaurant in town prior to their divorce). Quiet and shy, she contributes to her own emotional frailty.\n\nShe is the first girl to fall for Keitaro and in the manga attempts to avoid him because of this. In both the anime and manga, she thinks highly of Keitaro and will often be at the verge of tears when she thinks that he is in trouble or likes someone else. In the epilogue 4 years later she has since grown her hair out and has become more mature, though she retains her sincere personality. She still has a crush on Keitaro and hasn't given up on her dream of being his girlfriend (even though Keitaro was already getting married to Naru).\n\nThe reason Shinobu decided to leave home and live at the Hinata Inn was because of the marital problems between her father,<ref>Source: Christmas episode</ref> and her mother, whose names are never mentioned. In the anime, their marital problems lead to their divorce. Shinobu's parents arrive at the Hinata Inn and argue over who Shinobu should live with. However, Shinobu decides to remain at the Hinata Inn, to which her mother is against as she believes the Hinata Inn is a bad place full of rowdy young girls. They eventually concede, allowing Shinobu to remain living at the Inn.\n\n{{Voiced by2|Shinobu|[[Masayo Kurata]]|[[Bridget Hoffman|Ellen Arden]]|type=tv}}<ref name=\"voices\"/>\n\n===Motoko Aoyama===\n\n{{nihongo|'''Motoko Aoyama'''|\u9752\u5c71 \u7d20\u5b50|Aoyama Motoko}} is an intense 15-year-old school girl, who practices the martial art of ''[[kendo]]'', as well as being a member of the Shinmei-ry\u016b sword school (which is also referred to in Akamatsu's later work Mahou Sensei Negima, as the school of the character Setsuna). Motoko is a resident at the Hinata Inn, living in room 302.\n\nShe has difficulty relating to other people, especially men, whom she finds to be a distraction that keeps her from being able to concentrate fully on her studies and practice. She also dislikes men because her sister left the dojo to marry. Her relationship with Keitaro initially resembles Naru's relationship with him in some ways; all too often he finds himself on the receiving end of various attacks as a result of his frequent mishaps or simply bad luck. She eventually warms up to him somewhat and eventually finds herself developing strong feelings for him which she vehemently denies until near the end of the series. On two occasions this causes severe problems for both Motoko and Keitaro. In later volumes she develops a habit of writing trashy romance stories involving the two of them, often involuntarily.\n\nMotoko has an older sister, Tsuruko, who gave up the life of the sword to marry. Tsuruko is far stronger at kendo than Motoko; Motoko both greatly admires and fears her older sister.  However, Tsuruko believes that Motoko has more potential than she herself does, and that Motoko lost her drive to improve when Tsuruko married.  Motoko is also the next in line to inherit the Aoyama family's Kyoto dojo as she is not married.  It is notable that Tsuruko is actually Motoko's biological sister as they are two of the few characters in the series who are siblings by blood relation (the second siblings couple is presented by Kaolla and Amalla Su).\n\nMotoko has only two serious fears in the world: Tsuruko and, for some unspecified reason, turtles (even though Tsuruko correlates it to her intense dislike for men).\n\nIn the anime, Motoko is popular at her school for her kendo skills. She frequently spends time with {{nihongo|'''Sachiyo Matsumoto'''|\u677e\u672c \u5e78\u4ee3|Matsumoto Sachiyo}}, {{nihongo|'''Emi Ichikawa'''|\u5e02\u5ddd \u3048\u307f|Ichikawa Emi}} and {{nihongo|'''Kikuko Onoue'''|\u5c3e\u4e0a \u83ca\u5b50|Onoue Kikuko}}, who are all fans of her. Kikuko is especially protective of Motoko and has criticised Motoko's change in personality and decline in kendo skills since Keitaro began living at Hinata Inn, referring to him as a distraction.\n{{Voiced by2|Motoko|[[Y\u016b Asakawa]]|[[Mona Marshall]]|type=tv}}\n\n===Kaolla Su===\n{{nihongo|'''Kaolla Su'''|\u30ab\u30aa\u30e9\u30fb\u30b9\u30a5|Kaora S\u016b}} is a 13-year-old foreign transfer student. She is also a boarder at the Hinata Inn, in room 301.\n\nSu is the princess of Molmol, a fictional island nation located near the [[International Date Line]]. The dot on her forehead seems to have something to do with the 3-eyed symbol of Molmol. She is often barefoot and dressed in nothing else except her heavily altered school uniform in almost every anime episode and manga chapter, or some otherwise scant costume. To top her personality, she is above all extremely hyperactive, usually hugging (or, in Keitaro's case, kicking) someone, trying to eat something, especially bananas and/or Tama-chan, or inventing some potentially dangerous new device. She also has a tendency to snuggle against a person while she is sleeping and usually crushes them while doing it.\n\nMolmol is a kingdom where the moon sometimes appears red. It also uses a western naming order, although the Hinata Inn residents never seem to pick this up until later: Su is actually Kaolla Su's family name.\n\nSu likes all the other residents in the Hinata Apartments and gets along well with them, though they have difficulty keeping up with her hyperactive tendencies; only the athletic Motoko seems to be able to tolerate and keep up with her. Her like for Keitaro stems from the fact that he reminds her of the person she refers to as her older brother (actually her cousin, whom she grew up with). However, it can be inferred that she eventually comes to care about Keitaro as much as and perhaps even more than her older brother.\n\nWhile she has stated that she likes everyone in the Hinata apartments (including Sarah, who was sent there for a short period of time), it is apparent that Kaolla shares a much deeper relationship with Sarah and Motoko as compared to the other residents. Her ambition is to return to her homeland to start a computing school and transform her country into a technological power that will rival, and eventually conquer, Japan.\n\nAs if her never ending energy, strange customs, and mechanical finesse were not strange enough, Su also possesses the ability to transform into a more adult version of herself on a single night every year, when the moon glows red. In the anime, she admitted to have fallen in love with Keitaro while she was in this form, despite her transformation just last a few seconds because there was no red moon. Though this is not explicitly stated in the manga, it is implied extremely heavily with the adult Su even kissing Keitaro and proclaiming herself his girlfriend afterwards.\n\nHer room in the Hinata Inn is a faithful recreation of Molmol's natural habitat, complete with banana trees, a waterfall, and a small lake, along with a high-tech laboratory. {{Voiced by2|Su|[[Reiko Takagi]]|[[Wendee Lee]]|type=tv}}<ref name=\"voices\"/>\n\n===Mitsune \"Kitsune\" Konno===\n\n{{nihongo|'''Mitsune Konno'''|\u7d3a\u91ce \u307f\u3064\u306d|Konno Mitsune}}, also known as [[Kitsune]], which means \"fox\" in Japanese, is a 19-year-old freelance writer (who never seems to write anything). She is frequently drunk and seems to enjoy teasing Keitaro at every opportunity. Kitsune is also a boarder at the Hinata Inn, in room 205. She rarely pays any rent or contributes and  has had a number of low paying jobs. Despite this she has never been evicted from the lodge. Her best friend is Naru. Although Naru is the more intellectual of the two, Kitsune is often the one to see things sensibly (although often she will encourage madness out of boredom), though she usually tries to reason when things are really out of control.\nHer nickname comes from a combination of her first and last names, and the fact that she hardly ever fully opens both eyes at the same time (mostly when she is surprised). As a result, she has a perpetually fox-like, vulpine expression. She's a practical joker and troublemaker; her mission in life seems to be to ensure that things never get too dull or those around her too complacent. She is also seen drinking a lot. She speaks with a [[Kansai dialect]]. In the [[manga]] (Volume 4) Kitsune's bedroom walls are densely lined with bottles of alcoholic drinks. She is also the one who taught Kaolla Japanese.\n\nKitsune is more flirtatious, especially with Keitaro, than any of the other residents. Mostly this is to tease him; however, she does develop a strong crush on him; eventually she shows little serious romantic interest in him. She is also the bustiest in the household, her bust being second only to Mutsumi Otohime in size, and is unafraid of using her charms to get what she wants, whatever it might be. Her relationship with Keitaro eventually develops into a \"little brother/big sister\" connection (though Keitaro is actually older than she is).\n\nShe also is a bit greedy, as seen in a flashback sequence when she tells Keitaro about how much Naru's innocence ended up dismissing possible boyfriends; Kitsune was shown to encourage her to date a rich boy just because of his wealth. Also, when the girls are traveling to Molmol to try and bring Keitaro back to Hinata Inn, the only thing she thinks of is the inheritance that will be left to him and the girl that he chooses whenever Hina returns, even though, later on, Kitsune lets him stay with Naru. She eventually takes over the Hinata Tea House when Haruka leaves and picks up Haruka's habit of smoking.  Between the start and the finish Kitsune held two other jobs.  Her name is derived from the name of manga artist [[Mitsune Ayasaka]].<ref name=\"manga artist\"/> {{Voiced by2|Kitsune|[[Junko Noda]]|[[Barbara Goodson]]|type=tv}}<ref name=\"voices\"/>\n\n==Relatives==\n\n===Haruka Urashima===\n\n{{nihongo|'''Haruka Urashima'''|\u6d66\u5cf6 \u306f\u308b\u304b|Urashima Haruka}} is Keitaro Urashima's \"aunt\" (actually his cousin). In the anime she dislikes being called aunt by Keitaro and often smashes him in the face when she is referred to as and corrects him by saying \"its Haruka-san\" (san being a respectful term to your elder in most cases)\n\nHaruka Urashima is the only child of Hinata Urashima's eldest daughter, Yoko Urashima; her second daughter was Keitaro's mother. After the death of Yoko, Hinata adopted her granddaughter. Therefore, Haruka is Keitaro's legal aunt in addition to being his actual cousin.<ref>{{cite book |title=Love Hina Mugendai |year=2002 |publisher=Kodansha |isbn=4-06-334578-5 |page= 26}}</ref> It was as a teenager that, while working at the inn, she was first called \"Aunty Haruka\" by her baby cousin Keitaro&nbsp;\u2013 the same time that Keitaro first met both Mutsumi and Naru.\n\nHaruka is the ''ry\u014dbo'' (\"house-mother\") of the ''Joshi Seny\u014d Ry\u014d Hinata-s\u014d'' (\"Women's Only Dormitory, Hinata House\") and runs the ''Waf\u016b Chab\u014d Hinata'' (\"Traditional Japanese Tea-Room Hinata\"). Haruka is constantly seen smoking a cigarette. Like Naru, she has a fiery temper (and great physical prowess to match), which she hides under a calm, detached exterior.\n\nHaving traveled the world with Seta and Sara's mom, and it is hinted that a love triangle existed between the three at one point (or at least that Haruka and Seta were romantically involved); this is explored more fully in the manga, to the point that Haruka and Seta end up getting married. Haruka's skills in martial arts rival Seta's and can even surpass his when she is angry. She is also very skilled with firearms, which shows when she shoots Kaolla's missiles at Seta's head after being teased by him. {{Voiced by2|Haruka|[[Megumi Hayashibara]]|[[Mari Devon|Jane Alan]]|type-tv}}<ref name=\"voices\"/>\n\n===Hinata Urashima===\n{{nihongo|'''Hinata Urashima'''|\u6d66\u5cf6 \u3072\u306a\u305f|Urashima Hinata}}, also known as Grandma Hina, is the original manager of Hinata. Upon retiring, she entrusted Keitaro with looking over the Hinata Inn so she could travel the world.\n\nIn the manga, Grandma Hina knew all along that Naru was the girl Keitaro promised to go to Tokyo U with. She also knew the location of the Liddo-Kun shaped [[time capsule]] Keitaro, Naru, and Mutsumi buried beneath the sandbox when they were children.<ref>{{cite book |last=Akamatsu |first=Ken |authorlink=Ken Akamatsu |title=Love Hina, Volume 14 |publisher=[[TokyoPop]] |date=2002-05-07 |page=137 |isbn=1-59182-120-7 }}</ref> {{Voiced by2|Grandma Hina|[[Masako Nozawa]]|[[Barbara Goodson]]|type=tv}}<ref name=\"voices\"/>\n\n===Noriyasu Seta===\n{{nihongo|'''Noriyasu Seta'''|\u702c\u7530 \u8a18\u5eb7|Seta Noriyasu}} is a [[Tokyo University]] graduate and professor who specialises in [[archaeology]], appearing to be a parody of [[Indiana Jones]]. Like Keitaro, he was a third-year ''ronin''. He's clumsy&nbsp;\u2014 especially with women, and his relationship to Haruka seems to be similar to Keitaro's relationship with Naru (i.e. both get physically thrashed around by their respective female and are married to them eventually as well as both of them apparently being invulnerable to just about everything), a terrible driver (his arrival often heralded by his van crashing down from the sky), and an exceptionally skilled martial artist, all partly due to his complete lack of self-preservation. Seta spends a good deal of his time traveling the world on one expedition or another. His goal seems to be to find evidence of the ancient turtle civilization that once flourished throughout east Asia.\n\nSeta is also something of an adventurer, and possesses a van that shares his indestructible nature, and apparently has a submarine mode. In the past, Haruka had a major crush on him, though he seemed oblivious. They went on many expeditions together. Along with them on the expeditions was Sara's mother, an [[Americans|American]] that looked remarkably like Naru, who later died. Her last request was that Seta marry Haruka. This wish was granted, and Haruka and Seta married at the ruins of Todai, capital of the Turtle civilization. Seta is Sara's guardian, and she refers to him as \"papa.\"\n\nSeta is most probably a practitioner of ''[[Jeet Kune Do]]''{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. In most situations, his fighting stance is almost an exact mirror of [[Bruce Lee]]'s proprietary stance{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. Also, in the anime, Sara even uses the term \"Jeet Kune Do\" in reference to her father's fighting technique{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. {{Voiced by2|Seta|[[Yasunori Matsumoto]]|[[Kirk Thornton]]|type=tv}}\n\nHis name is derived from the name of manga artist [[Noriyasu Seta]].<ref name=\"manga artist\"/><ref name=\"voices\"/>\n\n===Sarah McDougal===\n{{nihongo|'''Sarah McDougal'''|\u30b5\u30e9\u30fb\u30de\u30af\u30c9\u30a5\u30ac\u30eb|Sara MakuDugaru}}, is a 9-year-old American from [[California]] and Seta's adopted daughter.<ref>{{cite book |title= Love Hina Mugendai |publisher= Kodansha |year= 2002 |isbn= 4-06-334578-5 |page=30 }}</ref> She initially delights in making Keitaro's life miserable, however, like most of the girls in the story, she eventually warms up to him, even if she still calls him a dork.\n\nSarah is left for a time in the care of the Hinata Inn residents by Seta, as he feels that travelling the world with him on expeditions would be too disruptive to her childhood. There, she develops a close friendship with Su, most likely because of their shared disdain for the general order of things. In both the manga and anime version, Sarah even comments on how \"Kaolla and I are not Japanese!\" during a meal, when Motoko forces them all&nbsp;\u2013 sans Naru, who is in a field trip to Kyoto&nbsp;\u2013 to have a samurai-like diet. Sara quickly becomes Su's new playmate, taking the place of Motoko, who was the only person in the house to keep up with Su's energy. Sara and Su eventually become so close they change their hairstyles to match, both of them with two pigtails. Sara eventually does return to travelling with Seta after his marriage to Haruka.\n\nSarah has an uncle in California; in the anime, it was implied that she had stayed with, and been the victim of abuse, at the hands of her biological relatives. Her mother, now deceased, formerly worked with Seta and Haruka on an archaeological dig and competed for Seta's romantic attention.\n\nSara possesses no unusual talents or skills, save for a certain gift for ''[[Jeet Kune Do]]'' learned from Seta, though she is adept at bashing Keitaro on the head with priceless artifacts [[Hammerspace|often pulled out of nowhere]]. She has a panda-shaped birthmark on her buttocks, which she avoids showing at all costs. She shares her family name with Cynthia McDougal from Ken Akamatsu's previous manga series ''[[A.I. Love You]]''. {{Voiced by2|Sarah|[[Yumiko Kobayashi]]|[[Julie Maddalena]]|type=tv}}<ref name=\"voices\"/>\n\n===Kanako Urashima===\n{{nihongo|'''Kanako Urashima'''|\u6d66\u5cf6 \u53ef\u5948\u5b50|Urashima Kanako}} is Keitaro's adopted younger sister. Kanako is a master of disguise and is able to impersonate anyone, which she uses to try to get control over the Hinata Inn (Keitaro is the only one who can see through her disguise at simple view), and she also has a strong fable and skills in [[Japanese bondage]] techniques. Kanako never came to see Keitaro as a brother, and had loved him since they were children. When they promised to run an inn together when they grew up, she had assumed it would be as husband and wife. However, Keitaro does not share these thoughts and only sees her as a sister.\n\nShe first appears in Volume 11 in the manga, and in the ''Love Hina Again'' OVA. Her appearance is often accompanied by the sound of a bell carried on the tail of her unusual cat Kuro.\n\nAfter travelling with her grandmother for some years, she returns to Japan to fulfill her promise to her brother to run an inn together. She arrives while Keitaro was away in the United States, and after assuming control, immediately changes the Hinata Inn from a girls' dormitory back into an inn. The residents are forced to either stay and work for her, or to leave.\n\nShe soon realizes that all of the girls in Hinata Inn have some sort of affection for her brother, and tests their affection in a variety of ways. She then tries to drive them away by being as mean and cruel as she could to them. At first it seemed to be working, as one by one everyone but Naru left the new Hinata Inn. When the girls (except for Naru) start to suspect Kanako's feelings for Keitaro and why she forces them to be mean to him, they form the \"Hinata House Liberation Front\" in order to reclaim the Inn. Kanako, Naru and Mutsumi form the ''Hinata-r\u014dshi'' (\u65e5\u5411\u6d6a\u58eb, translated as \"Hinata Rebel Alliance\") to reclaim it under the name ''Urashima Kanako-no-suke'' (\u6d66\u5cf6\u53ef\u5948\u5b50\u4e4b\u52a9). <!--seen in Chapter 96 (Make as reference)-->\n\nEven without knowing her, Kanako had harbored a deep hatred for the little girl to which Keitaro promised to go to Tokyo University with, as she believes that the promise is what plagued his life with bad luck. As such, she believed that by eliminating this girl, the \"curse\" would be lifted. At first, she thought that Kitsune, who was leading the \"Liberation Front\", was this girl, but in the nick of time, Naru ended up revealing that she was most likely the girl. Disheartened for having trusted her unwilling sworn enemy, Kanako attempted to sabotage Naru's relationship with Keitaro upon his return. However, in the end, she recognized that it was Naru whom he liked, and reluctantly accepts their relationship. {{Voiced by2|Kanako|[[Natsuko Kuwatani]]|[[Melissa Fahn]]|type=tv}}\n\n==Minor characters==\n\n===Amalla Su===\n{{nihongo|'''Amalla Su'''|\u30a2\u30de\u30e9\u30fb\u30b9\u30a5|Amara S\u016b}} is Kaolla Su's older sister. She has long white hair, blue eyes, and wears an outfit resembling that of an [[India]]n/[[Arab]]ian princess. Both she and her sister are [[magical girl]]s, and both are members of the royal family of the kingdom of Molmol. Amalla has been in love with cousin Crown Prince Lamba Lu for a long time, but has never admitted her feelings to him. She speaks Japanese in an [[Edokko]] accent, and claims to be from the deserts of [[Edo]] (Edo is an old name for [[Tokyo]], which of course has no deserts). In combat, she possesses two weapons: a magical flute that controls the weather, and her pet albino alligator Shiro. She is referenced in the manga and has several appearances in the anime. {{Voiced by2|Amalla|[[Aya Hisakawa]]|[[Wendee Lee]]|type=tv}}\n\n===Lamba Lu===\n\"Brother\" to Amalla and Kaolla. In reality, he is a cousin of theirs, but they have grown up as siblings. He is the king of their nation, and in the tradition of their people, he has to serve in the military for a period of time. Before that happens, he is required to marry. Once when Kaolla was a very young girl he promised to marry her, but then he realises that she only sees him as a brother, whereas Amalla is in love with him. He marries Amalla instead.\n\nLamba Lu looks almost exactly like Keitaro when they both have their glasses on; the only striking differences are that he's a bit more tanned than Keitaro is, has darker hair and dark green eyes, and a somewhat [[India]]n/[[South Asia]]n appearance. Unlike Keitaro, however, Lamba Lu is very calm, collected, and 'together', and not at all clumsy or awkward.\n\nWhile Lamba Lu does not appear explicitly in the manga, he does interact with Keitaro at one point and has a different role. In volume 14, Keitaro receives a letter from Lamba Lu inviting the former ''ronin'' to take part in a joint research project between Tokyo University and the University of Molmol (in which case Lamba Lu is actually the chairman of the joint research project) on the Lost Todai Ruins. {{Voiced by2|Lamba|[[Y\u016bji Ueda]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]]|type=tv}}\n\n===Kentaro Sakata===\n{{nihongo|'''Kentaro Sakata'''|\u5742\u7530 \u5065\u592a\u6717|Sakata Kentar\u014d}}, an anime-specific character, had a crush on Naru. Originally Keitaro's rival for Narusegawa, he eventually loses all of his money in his pursuit of her. He remained fairly tenacious for a time, but eventually gave up after getting deep into debt with the Hinata Inn. Haruka let him try to work off his debts at a very low pay rate of $1.50 an hour; from that point on, Kentaro became an occasional background character and plot device, like giving advice to Keitaro and supporting his feelings for Narusegawa.\n\nAlso, Kentaro has been repeatedly mispronounced as 'Keitaro' by the residents, and occasionally by himself, mainly before they grew too familiar with him. Strangely enough though, he has absolutely nothing, besides his original affection for Naru, in common with Keitaro. {{Voiced by2|Kentaro|[[Ryotaro Okiayu]]|Steve Areno|type=tv}}\n\n===Mei Narusegawa===\n{{nihongo|'''Mei Narusegawa'''|\u6210\u702c\u5ddd \u30e1\u30a4|Narusegawa Mei}} is Naru's younger sister. Naru describes her as her \"half-sister\" in manga volumes 11 and 14. On the other hand, in the anime, episode 22, Mei said \"My father married her mother.\" This leads some to speculate that they are stepsisters, although this is never confirmed. She initially tries to get Keitaro and Mutsumi together in the hopes that Naru would return home if Keitaro were taken. She gives up on this when she and Naru clear up a few family misconceptions. Also, in ''Love Hina Again'', she makes a very brief appearance to help all the Hinata residents about Keitaro and Naru's relationship & help speed it up. She also appears in the last volume of the manga, seen standing off on the side with the rest of the residents of Hinata Inn while Naru is chasing Keitaro down after accidentally undressing her. She also plays a minor role in the Spring Movie.\n\nMei was created for and appears primarily in the ''Love Hina'' anime, though she is referred to in at least two places in the manga and is seen in the last chapter of the final volume of the manga. {{Voiced by2|Mei|[[Yuri Shiratori]]|[[Rebecca Forstadt]]|type=tv}}\n\n===Tsuruko Aoyama===\n{{nihongo|'''Tsuruko Aoyama'''|\u9752\u5c71 \u9db4\u5b50|Aoyama Tsuruko}} is Motoko's older sister and the one currently entrusted with the keeping of their family's Shinmeiryuu tradition. She is not active in running the school, having given up the life of the sword for marriage, and it is her duty to hand the school over to Motoko's care when the time comes.\n\nThough Motoko has lived in fear of Tsuruko for years, Tsuruko has Motoko's best interests at heart and her only real wish is for her sister to be happy on whatever path she chooses to walk. Unfortunately, she has a habit of trying to kill her sister when she lies to her (when she tried to take Motoko back to Kyoto and, to prevent this, she pretended to be engaged with Keitaro) or does not tell her the full details of a situation (when Motoko admitted that she flunked the Todai admittance exam). She also gets into a bloodthirsty mood whenever Motoko is lazy and does not do her best (this is only seen in a nightmare sequence of Motoko).\n\nWhile her usual appearance is that of a very proper lady well versed in Japanese culture, she sometimes has the eyes of a demon and becomes extremely violent. She is an incredible swordswoman whom few could hope to face, even though she abandoned the dojo after getting married. She is a very serious character, but also very just and in her own weird way, only cares for the well being of her sister.\n\nShe has a beautiful pet [[Crane (bird)|crane]] named \"Shippu\", which she later gives to Motoko in the thirteenth volume after Motoko finally defeats her. Like her sister, her sword techniques are centered around the destruction of evil, using ki attacks with her slash, some of them hurting only evil beings, but mostly slashing through rocks, people or larger objects (like a sports car, driven by Kentaro, that was 'accidentally' about to run over Keitaro&nbsp;\u2013 in the manga, it was a truck whose driver was drunk and sleepy) as if they were made of paper. {{Voiced by2|Tsuruko|[[Miki Nagasawa]]|[[Philece Sampler]]|type=tv}}\n\n===Kimiaki Shirai===\n{{nihongo|'''Kimiaki Shirai'''|\u767d\u4e95 \u529f\u660e|Shirai Kimiaki}} is one of Keitaro's friends. He loves to make fun of Keitaro, calling him a failure in girls and academics, but pulls back later on when Keitaro becomes more successful. He almost always appears with Haitani. His main interests are in women, and one of his only upside is some degree of skill in computers. He also seems to have an interest in older woman like Haruka. He is short, and is almost always shown with big round glasses. In the manga's fifth volume, Su even calls him a \"small, fat, Hobbit\". {{Voiced by2|Shirai|[[Michio Miyashita]]|[[Gene Holliday]]|type=tv}}\n\n===Masayuki Haitani===\n{{nihongo|'''Masayuki Haitani'''|\u7070\u8c37 \u771f\u4e4b|Haitani Masayuki}} is one of Keitaro's friends, and is (apart from a few physical differences) almost exactly like Shirai. He is taller, wearing tiny round glasses, and enters a university before Shirai or Keitaro. Like Shirai, Haitani's primary interests lie in women, relying on his charm to attract female attention, but to no avail. He appears to be the leader of the trio, formulating many schemes to gain girlfriends for himself, Keitaro, and Shirai (despite Keitaro's reluctance to go along with them), most notably the Hinata tenants, but they end in constant failures, getting them into trouble (if not all three, then only Keitaro) with the girls. {{Voiced by2|Haitani|[[Hiroyuki Yoshino]]|[[Steven Blum]]|type=tv}}\n\n===Ema Maeda===\n{{nihongo|'''Ema Maeda'''|\u771f\u679d \u7d75\u99ac|Maeda Ema}} appears in the epilogue of the ''Love Hina'' manga, Volume 14, which is set three years (four in the English manga) after the end of the main storyline.\n\nA timid 15-year-old girl who dabbles in conspiracy theories, Ema hopes to get into Tokyo University so she can improve her life and have people notice her. Due to her poor grades, she left home in order to live at the \"legendary\" Hinata Inn, which is believed to have the power to get anyone into Tokyo University. Being very clumsy, her arrival at the Hinata Inn mirrors Keitaro's initial arrival, as she is mistaken for a peeping tom and is chased out of the hot springs. In awe of all the beautiful girls living at the Hinata Inn, she accidentally steals Naru's wedding veil, tripping a theft alarm in the process. She is rescued by and flees with Keitaro. Despite a shaky first day, everything is set right when she is given a thank you kiss by Naru for finding and returning both her veil and groom. She then realizes that she can achieve her dreams if she tries hard enough. She has a pet [[chameleon]] named Leon.\n\n===Nyamo Namo===\n{{nihongo|'''Nyamo Namo'''|\u30cb\u30e3\u30e2\u30fb\u30ca\u30fc\u30e2|Nyamo N\u0101mo}} is a young girl of the island Pararakelse. Her grandfather was once an acquaintance of Seta, and after her grandfather's death, Nyamo decided to work with Seta on his excavations to continue her grandfather's work. Nyamo is physically almost identical to Shinobu, except for her darker skin and longer hair. She also shares a number of other traits with Shinobu as well, including her extreme initial shyness and reluctance to speak and a crush on Keitaro (which is shown when she glomps Keitaro in her second appearance and for which Naru punches him into the ground for \"assaulting\" Nyamo). She also seems to have developed a fear of Naru after seeing her bludgeon Keitaro into the air (even hiding behind her giant tortoise when she saw Naru afterwards) though she is also very hard to surprise, often having the same innocent quizzical expression in any situation. Nyamo and Shinobu quickly become good friends and correspond when apart. In the manga, when she visits the Hinata Dorms, she brings with her a pet giant [[tortoise]] named Gidget. {{Voiced by2|Nyamo|[[Nana Mizuki]]|[[Michelle Ruff]]|type=tv}}\n\n===Ken Akamatsu===\n{{nihongo|'''Ken Akamatsu'''|\u8d64\u677e \u5065|Akamatsu Ken}} makes brief cameo appearances in the anime television series and Love Hina Specials, serving as a minor plot device character.

Keitaro points out that the turtle is male, but the girls are convinced he is a 'she' and so 'he' is referred to as 'she' throughout the manga. She is an 'onsen kame' or hot-springs turtle, and like others of her species, it appears that she can fly. Su, Mutsumi, Seta, and (later in the series) Keitaro appear to have the ability to speak with Tama-chan, and Su occasionally develops the urge to eat her, though sometimes it is just to tease Shinobu (in the manga, it is said on a side note that Su drops this habit in order to wait for Tama-chan to reproduce). She appears in ''[[Negima]]'' on [[Characters of Negima (16-31)#Chizuru Naba|Chizuru Naba]]'s apron on the back cover of volume 8, in chapter 85 of volume 10, and in other places as pictures. {{Voiced by2|Tama|Yukie Maeda|[[Wendee Lee]]|type=tv}}\n\n===Mecha-Tama-chan===\nSu, convinced she is going to have to face Tama-chan down at some point (Su wants to eat her), has designed multiple mechanical versions of Tama. Every Mecha-Tama has turned out to be dangerous to the residents of the Hinata Inn.\n* Mecha-Tama-Chan 0 (a prototype): Volume 11\n* Mecha-Tama-chan 1: Volume 5\n* Mecha-Tama-chan 2: Volume 5\n* Mecha-Tama-chan Mark 3: Volume 7\n* Mecha-Tama-chan 4: Volume 8\n* Mecha-Tamago 5: Volume 13\n* Mecha-Tama-chan 6: Volume 14\n* Mecha-Tama-chan 30: Volume 14\n\nApparently, Su has been developing Mecha Tama-chans during the three years that pass since the end of the main story until the marriage of Keitaro and Naru, the latest version being the 30th. Kanako Urashima somehow gets a hold of Su's prototype Mecha-Tama in her reign over the house in volume 11, and is probably the only time someone other than Su used a Mecha-Tama, aside from Naru in volume 7 while trying to keep Keitaro and Mutsumi apart.\n\n===Kuro===\n{{nihongo|'''Kuro'''|\u30af\u30ed|Kuro lit. Black}} is a black cat with huge ears which follows Kanako. It first appears in book 11 in the manga, and in the ''Love Hina Again'' OVA. It becomes friends with Tama-chan. Kaolla is very interested in researching it and Sarah calls him \"witch cat\" after knowing about Kuro's unusual abilities to fly (using its oversized ears) and talk. In the anime, Kuro can talk, but in the manga, instead of Kuro being able to talk, it is just Kanako's ventriloquism. It carries a bell on its tail, which sounds as characteristic when Kanako appears.\nAs a footnote, Ken Akamatsu explained in his notes in Volume 14, page 148 that Tama, Kuro, Shippu, and Leon were inspired by the \"[[Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Four Legendary Animals of Japanese Mythology]]\". Tama was inspired by [[Black Tortoise|Genbu]], Kuro by [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|Byakko]], Shippu by [[Vermilion Bird|Suzaku]], and Leon by [[Azure Dragon|Seiryuu]]. {{Voiced by2|Kuro|[[Yuki Matsuoka]]|[[Sandy Fox]]|type=tv}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Love Hina}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Love Hina Characters}}\n[[Category:Love Hina]]\n[[Category:Lists of anime and manga characters|Love Hina characters]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Love_Hina_characters"}

Zola scored three goals in Chelsea's run to the Champions League quarter-finals, including a curling free kick against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], and he again won the [[1999\u20132000 FA Cup|FA Cup]] with the club, with his free-kick in the [[2000 FA Cup Final|final]] against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] setting up [[Roberto Di Matteo]]'s winner. His later years with Chelsea saw his appearances restricted by the new strike pairing of [[Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink]] and [[Ei\u00f0ur Gu\u00f0johnsen]].

Zola was limited to infrequent starts and many substitute appearances due to Ranieri's new policy of decreasing the average age of the Chelsea squad, preferring to play the gifted Icelandic youngster Gudjohnsen with Hasselbaink. Zola did draw attention, however, for his dominant performance when he scored with a notable backheeled effort in mid-air from a corner-kick, in an [[2001\u201302 FA Cup|FA Cup]] tie against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] on 16 January 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title=I 10 gol pi\u00f9 belli della storia del calcio: Zola, Chelsea-Norwich City 2001\u201302|url=http://www.repubblica.it/speciale/2002/mondiali2002/topgol/video/06.html|accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Io, Zola, eroe d' Inghilterra per caso|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2002/gennaio/21/Zola_eroe_Inghilterra_per_caso_co_0_0201211108.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518150811/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2002/gennaio/21/Zola_eroe_Inghilterra_per_caso_co_0_0201211108.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 May 2009|accessdate=23 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Manager [[Claudio Ranieri]] described the goal as \"fantasy, magic\".<ref>{{cite news| date=17 January 2002 | url=http://www.4thegame.com/club/cfc/news/173371/Zola+announces+retirement.html | archive-url=https://archive.today/20071021105549/http://www.4thegame.com/club/cfc/news/173371/Zola+announces+retirement.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=21 October 2007 | title=Zola adds his touch of magic | publisher=The Guardian | accessdate=20 December 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303]], his final season with Chelsea, he enjoyed a renaissance, scoring 16 goals, his highest seasonal tally for Chelsea, and was voted the club's player of the year after helping Chelsea qualify for the Champions League. Zola scored his final goal for Chelsea, a lob from outside the penalty area against Everton, on Easter Monday 2003, and made his final competitive appearance for the club on the final day of the season with a 20-minute cameo against Liverpool, beating four Liverpool players during a fantastic dribble late on in the match, gaining applause from both sets of fans.

Its history can be traced back to the mid-19th century with the construction of a limited passenger line in [[Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico|Mayag\u00fcez]]. Between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Puerto Rico's rail transport system expanded significantly, becoming one of the largest rail systems in the Caribbean at the time thanks to an [[Boom and bust|economic boom]] in agriculture industries, especially the [[sugar cane]] industry. The rail system was expanded to include passenger travel with a direct line from the island's northern capital of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] to the western and southern cities and towns, greatly improving travel and communication within the island. However, the entire system was soon overshadowed by the arrival of the automobile, and by the 1950s was completely abandoned. Small remnants of this system still exist in some parts of Puerto Rico, some conserved for [[Heritage railway|tourism purposes]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:TranviaMayaguez3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Early horse-drawn passenger rail system in Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico, circa 1872.]]\n[[File:TranviaMayaguez2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A passenger car in Suau Park in Mayag\u00fcez in 1898.]]\n\n=== Early Mayag\u00fcez passenger system ===\nAlthough Puerto Rico did not have a national railroad system until the last decade of the 19th, between the 1870s and 1890s, the city of [[Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico|Mayag\u00fcez]] did have a small passenger rail system for transporting its residents, mainly along the current [[Calle Mendez Vigo (Mayag\u00fcez)|Mendez Vigo Avenue]].<ref name=\"IPRAC\">[http://iprac.aspira.org/iprac_transportation.htm ''Puerto Rico: Society and Culture Before the US Invasion of 1898: Transportation''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060809000358/http://iprac.aspira.org/iprac_transportation.htm |date=2006-08-09 }} Institute of Puerto Rican Arts and Culture (IPRAC) {{in lang|es}}</ref> It was originally proposed by Jose A.

The simple [[tram|street railway]] system consisted of small wagons on rails pulled by horses, and connected the center part of the town with the ''Playa'' sector (now Port sector). It faced numerous difficulties, including inclined routes and poor street conditions, which were troublesome for the animals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The system stopped in 1887 after the company was unable to obtain certain permits, but was revived in 1893 after a proposal by the company ''Sociedad An\u00f3nima Tranvia de Mayag\u00fcez'' (the Mayag\u00fcez Tramways Anonymous Society) and renewed operations in 1895.<ref name=\"Mayag\u00fcez\"/>\n\nThe new system operated more efficiently,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} offering more comfortable cars and more stops, including one in the town Market Place (''Plaza del Mercado'') and another in the Guanajibo neighborhood. The routes were altered to pass through [[Calle de la Candelaria (Mayag\u00fcez)|McKinley Street]], which was less inclined and with better road conditions than previous routes benefiting both the ride and the horses. It lasted until 1912, when the Mayag\u00fcez Tramways Anonymous Society ceased operations and was replaced by the Mayag\u00fcez Tramway Company in 1913.<ref name=\"Mayag\u00fcez\"/> The third operator of the system introduced new larger electric-powered cars, although the service was now limited from the ''Playa'' sector directly to the Balboa neighborhood.
