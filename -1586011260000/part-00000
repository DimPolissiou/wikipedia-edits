Written by [[Robbie van Leeuwen]], the song topped the charts in nine countries. In 1981, it was used to open the \"[[Stars on 45 (song)|Stars on 45]]\" medley.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Grein |first=Paul |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT5&dq=Medley |title=Chart Beat |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=98 |issue=36 |date=6 September 1986 |page=6 |issn=0006-2510 |accessdate=21 August 2019 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> In 1986, English girl group [[Bananarama]] covered \"Venus\" for their third studio album, ''[[True Confessions (album)|True Confessions]]'', reaching number one in six countries. The composition has been featured in numerous films, television shows and commercials, and covered dozens of times by artists around the world.\n\n==Shocking Blue (original)==\n[[File:Popgroep Shocking Blue gaf persconferentie in verband met succes van plaat Ve, Bestanddeelnr 923-1956.jpg|thumb|left|Shocking Blue in 1970]] \n\n===Background===\n\"Venus\" was issued in the Netherlands in July 1969 as a single, backed with \"Hot Sand\", on the Pink Elephant label. The song peaked at number three on the [[Dutch Top 40]] on 12 July 1969, and remained at that position for a total of five weeks. Later that year, \"Venus\" was issued in several European countries and other worldwide nations. In the United States, \"Venus\" reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on 7 February 1970. On 28 January 1970, it was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for sales in excess of one million copies in the United States.<ref name=\"RIAA\"/> Worldwide, the single has sold over 7.5 million copies.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ig8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA40&dq=Venus |title=Shocking Blue: huge success around world |magazine=Billboard |volume=84 |issue=49 |date=2 December 1972 |page=40 |issn=0006-2510 |accessdate=21 August 2019 |via=Google Books}}</ref> \n\n\"Venus\" was included as a bonus track on the 1989 CD reissue of the group's second studio album, ''[[At Home (Shocking Blue album)|At Home]]'', originally released in 1969.\n\nThe song's lead vocals are performed by [[Mariska Veres]]. The music is from \"The Banjo Song\" by Tim Rose and the Big 3 with new lyrics by [[Robbie van Leeuwen]], the band's guitarist, [[sitar]]ist and background vocalist, who also produced along with record producer [[Jerry Ross (record producer)|Jerry Ross]]. Van Leeuwen originally miswrote the line \"...the ''goddess'' on the mountain top...\" as \"...the ''godness'' on the mountain top...\", so Veres sang it this way on the recording of the song. This was corrected in later versions.{{cn|date=June 2017}} The [[Hohner|Hohner electric piano]] on the single was played by [[:nl:Cees Schrama|Cees Schrama]].{{cn|date=June 2017}}\n\nVan Leeuwen was inspired by \"The Banjo Song\", a composition by [[Tim Rose]], for [[The Big 3 (folk_group)|The Big 3]], that set [[Stephen Foster]]'s lyrics to \"[[Oh!

The group's three members, [[Sara Dallin]], [[Siobhan Fahey]], and [[Keren Woodward]], had the idea of turning the song into a [[dance music]] tune, but they were met with resistance from their producers at the time, [[Jolley & Swain|Steve Jolley and Tony Swain]]. Bananarama brought the idea to the production trio of [[Stock Aitken Waterman]], and it became Bananarama's first collaboration with them.\n\nDallin, Fahey, and Woodward had nearly completed recording their third studio album, ''[[True Confessions (album)|True Confessions]]'', with Jolley and Swain. Stock, Aitken and Waterman also resisted the idea because they believed that \"Venus\" would not make a good dance record. After persistence by the women, SAW relented. Bananarama's \"Venus\" peaked at number one in the United States, Australia, Finland, New Zealand, Switzerland, and South Africa, while reaching number two in Germany and the top 10 in Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and their native United Kingdom (number eight on the [[UK Singles Chart]]). It also topped the US [[Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance/Disco]] chart for two weeks.<ref>{{cite book |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |title=Hot Dance/Disco: 1974\u20132003 |publisher=Record Research |year=2004 |page=28}}</ref>\n\nThe collaboration on \"Venus\" led Bananarama and SAW to work together on the group's follow-up album ''[[Wow! (Bananarama album)|Wow!]]'' the following year.\n\nA new mix of the track appeared as B-side to the 1989 limited release \"Megarama '89\" in Germany and France.  Bananarama has since re-recorded the track for their 2001 album ''[[Exotica (Bananarama album)|Exotica]]'' and it was later [[remix]]ed by [[Marc Almond]], with re-recorded vocals, and included on their 2005 album ''[[Drama (Bananarama album)|Drama]]''.\n\n===Music video===\nThe music video, directed by [[Peter Care]], with choreography by [[Bruno Tonioli]], received extensive play on [[MTV]] and video channels across the world, and presented Bananarama in various costumes, including a [[Succubus|she-devil]], a French [[temptress]], a [[vampiress]], and several [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[goddess]]es. In one sequence of the video, [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s painting ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' is adapted as a ''[[tableau vivant]]''. The video marked a pivotal shift towards a more glamorous and sexual image for the girls that contrasted with the tomboyish style of their earlier work.\n\n===Track listings===\n*'''UK / US / Canadian 7-inch single'''\n''UK: London Records NANA 10 / US: London Records 886-056-7 / Canada: London Records LDS 227 / Australia: Liberation Records LS 1789''\n#\"Venus\" \u2013 3:30\n#\"White Train\" \u2013 3:50\n#:<small>S.Dallin/S.

The group's three members, [[Sara Dallin]], [[Siobhan Fahey]], and [[Keren Woodward]], had the idea of turning the song into a [[dance music]] tune, but they were met with resistance from their producers at the time, [[Jolley & Swain|Steve Jolley and Tony Swain]]. Bananarama brought the idea to the production trio of [[Stock Aitken Waterman]], and it became Bananarama's first collaboration with them.\n\nDallin, Fahey, and Woodward had nearly completed recording their third studio album, ''[[True Confessions (album)|True Confessions]]'', with Jolley and Swain. Stock, Aitken and Waterman also resisted the idea because they believed that \"Venus\" would not make a good dance record. After persistence by the women, SAW relented. Bananarama's \"Venus\" peaked at number one in the United States, Australia, Finland, New Zealand, Switzerland, and South Africa, while reaching number two in Germany and the top 10 in Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and their native United Kingdom (number eight on the [[UK Singles Chart]]). It also topped the US [[Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance/Disco]] chart for two weeks.<ref>{{cite book |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |title=Hot Dance/Disco: 1974\u20132003 |publisher=Record Research |year=2004 |page=28}}</ref>\n\nThe collaboration on \"Venus\" led Bananarama and SAW to work together on the group's follow-up album ''[[Wow! (Bananarama album)|Wow!]]'' the following year.\n\nA new mix of the track appeared as B-side to the 1989 limited release \"Megarama '89\" in Germany and France.  Bananarama has since re-recorded the track for their 2001 album ''[[Exotica (Bananarama album)|Exotica]]'' and it was later [[remix]]ed by [[Marc Almond]], with re-recorded vocals, and included on their 2005 album ''[[Drama (Bananarama album)|Drama]]''.\n\n===Music video===\nThe music video, directed by [[Peter Care]], with choreography by [[Bruno Tonioli]], received extensive play on [[MTV]] and video channels across the world, and presented Bananarama in various costumes, including a [[Succubus|she-devil]], a French [[temptress]], a [[vampiress]], and several [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[goddess]]es. In one sequence of the video, [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s painting ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' is adapted as a ''[[tableau vivant]]''. The video marked a pivotal shift towards a more glamorous and sexual image for the girls that contrasted with the tomboyish style of their earlier work.\n\n===Track listings===\n*'''UK / US / Canadian 7-inch single'''\n''UK: London Records NANA 10 / US: London Records 886-056-7 / Canada: London Records LDS 227 / Australia: Liberation Records LS 1789''\n#\"Venus\" \u2013 3:30\n#\"White Train\" \u2013 3:50\n#:<small>S.Dallin/S.

Given a differentiable function <math>f(x, y)</math> with real values, one can approximate  <math>f(x, y)</math> for <math>(x, y)</math> close to <math>(a, b)</math> by the formula\n:<math>f(x,y)\\ \\approx\\ f(a,b)+\\tfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} (a,b)\\,(x-a)+\\tfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(a,b)\\,(y-b).</math>\n\nThe right-hand side is the equation of the plane tangent to the graph of <math>z=f(x, y)</math> at <math>(a, b).</math>\n\n===Optimization===\n{{main|Mathematical optimization}}\nFor a continuously differentiable [[function of several real variables]], a point ''P'' (that is a set of values for the input variables, which is viewed as a point in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>) is '''critical''' if all of the [[partial derivative]]s of the function are zero at ''P'', or, equivalently, if its [[gradient]] is zero. The critical values are the values of the function at the critical points.\n\nIf the function is [[smooth function|smooth]], or, at least twice continuously differentiable, a critical point may be either a [[local maximum]], a [[local minimum]] or a [[saddle point]]. The different cases may be distinguished by considering the [[eigenvalue]]s of the [[Hessian matrix]] of second derivatives.\n\nBy [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)|Fermat's theorem]], all local [[maxima and minima]] of a differentiable function occur at critical points. Therefore, to find the local maxima and minima, it suffices, theoretically, to compute the zeros of the gradient and the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at these zeros.\n\n===Physics and engineering===\nVector calculus is particularly useful in studying:\n*[[Center of mass]]\n*[[Field theory (physics)|Field theory]]\n*[[Kinematics]]\n*[[Maxwell's equations]]\n\n==Generalizations==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\n===Different 3-manifolds===\nVector calculus is initially defined for [[Euclidean space|Euclidean 3-space]], <math>\\mathbb{R}^3,</math> which has additional structure beyond simply being a 3-dimensional real vector space, namely: a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] (giving a notion of length) defined via an [[inner product]] (the [[dot product]]), which in turn gives a notion of angle, and an [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]], which gives a notion of left-handed and right-handed. These structures give rise to a [[volume form]], and also the [[cross product]], which is used pervasively in vector calculus.\n\nThe gradient and divergence require only the inner product, while the curl and the cross product also requires the handedness of the [[coordinate system]] to be taken into account (see [[Cross product#Cross product and handedness|cross product and handedness]] for more detail).\n\nVector calculus can be defined on other 3-dimensional real vector spaces if they have an inner product (or more generally a symmetric [[nondegenerate form]]) and an orientation; note that this is less data than an isomorphism to Euclidean space, as it does not require a set of coordinates (a frame of reference), which reflects the fact that vector calculus is invariant under rotations (the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(3)).\n\nMore generally, vector calculus can be defined on any 3-dimensional oriented [[Riemannian manifold]], or more generally [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]. This structure simply means that the [[tangent space]] at each point has an inner product (more generally, a symmetric nondegenerate form) and an orientation, or more globally that there is a symmetric nondegenerate [[metric tensor]] and an orientation, and works because vector calculus is defined in terms of tangent vectors at each point.\n\n=== Other dimensions ===\nMost of the analytic results are easily understood, in a more general form, using the machinery of [[differential geometry]], of which vector calculus forms a subset. Grad and div generalize immediately to other dimensions, as do the gradient theorem, divergence theorem, and Laplacian (yielding [[harmonic analysis]]), while curl and cross product do not generalize as directly.\n\nFrom a general point of view, the various fields in (3-dimensional) vector calculus are uniformly seen as being ''k''-vector fields: scalar fields are 0-vector fields, vector fields are 1-vector fields, pseudovector fields are 2-vector fields, and pseudoscalar fields are 3-vector fields. In higher dimensions there are additional types of fields (scalar/vector/pseudovector/pseudoscalar corresponding to 0/1/''n''&minus;1/''n'' dimensions, which is exhaustive in dimension 3), so one cannot only work with (pseudo)scalars and (pseudo)vectors.\n\nIn any dimension, assuming a nondegenerate form, grad of a scalar function is a vector field, and div of a vector field is a scalar function, but only in dimension 3 or 7<ref>Lizhong Peng & Lei Yang (1999) \"The curl in seven dimensional space and its applications\", ''Approximation Theory and Its Applications'' 15(3): 66 to 80 {{doi|10.1007/BF02837124}}</ref> (and, trivially, in dimension 0 or 1) is the curl of a vector field a vector field, and only in 3 or [[seven-dimensional cross product|7]] dimensions can a cross product be defined (generalizations in other dimensionalities either require <math>n-1</math> vectors to yield 1 vector, or are alternative [[Lie algebra]]s, which are more general antisymmetric bilinear products). The generalization of grad and div, and how curl may be generalized is elaborated at [[Curl (mathematics)#Generalizations|Curl: Generalizations]]; in brief, the curl of a vector field is a [[bivector]] field, which may be interpreted as the [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]] of infinitesimal rotations; however, this cannot be identified with a vector field because the dimensions differ \u2013 there are 3 dimensions of rotations in 3 dimensions, but 6 dimensions of rotations in 4 dimensions (and more generally <math>\\textstyle{\\binom{n}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)}</math> dimensions of rotations in ''n'' dimensions).\n\nThere are two important alternative generalizations of vector calculus. The first, [[geometric algebra]], uses [[multivector|''k''-vector]] fields instead of vector fields (in 3 or fewer dimensions, every ''k''-vector field can be identified with a scalar function or vector field, but this is not true in higher dimensions). This replaces the cross product, which is specific to 3 dimensions, taking in two vector fields and giving as output a vector field, with the [[exterior product]], which exists in all dimensions and takes in two vector fields, giving as output a bivector (2-vector) field. This product yields [[Clifford algebra]]s as the algebraic structure on vector spaces (with an orientation and nondegenerate form). Geometric algebra is mostly used in generalizations of physics and other applied fields to higher dimensions.\n\nThe second generalization uses [[differential form]]s (''k''-covector fields) instead of vector fields or ''k''-vector fields, and is widely used in mathematics, particularly in [[differential geometry]], [[geometric topology]], and [[harmonic analysis]], in particular yielding [[Hodge theory]] on oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. From this point of view, grad, curl, and div correspond to the [[exterior derivative]] of 0-forms, 1-forms, and 2-forms, respectively, and the key theorems of vector calculus are all special cases of the general form of [[Stokes' theorem]].\n\nFrom the point of view of both of these generalizations, vector calculus implicitly identifies mathematically distinct objects, which makes the presentation simpler but the underlying mathematical structure and generalizations less clear.\nFrom the point of view of geometric algebra, vector calculus implicitly identifies ''k''-vector fields with vector fields or scalar functions: 0-vectors and 3-vectors with scalars, 1-vectors and 2-vectors with vectors. From the point of view of differential forms, vector calculus implicitly identifies ''k''-forms with scalar fields or vector fields: 0-forms and 3-forms with scalar fields, 1-forms and 2-forms with vector fields. Thus for example the curl naturally takes as input a vector field or 1-form, but naturally has as output a 2-vector field or 2-form (hence pseudovector field), which is then interpreted as a vector field, rather than directly taking a vector field to a vector field; this is reflected in the curl of a vector field in higher dimensions not having as output a vector field.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Real-valued function]]\n* [[Function of a real variable]]\n* [[Function of several real variables]]\n* [[Vector calculus identities]]\n* [[Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates]]\n* [[Directional derivative]]\n* [[Conservative vector field]]\n* [[Solenoidal vector field]]\n* [[Laplacian vector field]]\n* [[Helmholtz decomposition]]\n* [[Orthogonal coordinates]]\n* [[Skew coordinates]]\n* [[Curvilinear coordinates]]\n* [[Tensor]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Sandro Caparrini (2002) \"[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs004070200001?LI=true The discovery of the vector representation of moments and angular velocity]\", Archive for History of Exact Sciences 56:151\u201381.\n* {{cite book | first = Michael J. |last = Crowe  | title = A History of Vector Analysis : The Evolution of the Idea of a Vectorial System | publisher = Dover Publications |edition = reprint | year= 1967 | isbn = 978-0-486-67910-5 | title-link = A History of Vector Analysis }}\n* {{cite book | first = J.

L and M are functions of (x, y).\n|}\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Linear approximations===\n{{main|Linear approximation}}\nLinear approximations are used to replace complicated functions with linear functions that are almost the same. Given a differentiable function <math>f(x, y)</math> with real values, one can approximate  <math>f(x, y)</math> for <math>(x, y)</math> close to <math>(a, b)</math> by the formula\n:<math>f(x,y)\\approx f(a,b)+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} (a,b)(x-a)+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(a,b)(y-b).</math>\n\nThe right-hand side is the equation of the plane tangent to the graph of <math>z=f(x, y)</math> at <math>(a, b).</math>\n\n===Optimization===\n{{main|Mathematical optimization}}\nFor a continuously differentiable [[function of several real variables]], a point ''P'' (that is a set of values for the input variables, which is viewed as a point in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>) is '''critical''' if all of the [[partial derivative]]s of the function are zero at ''P'', or, equivalently, if its [[gradient]] is zero. The critical values are the values of the function at the critical points.\n\nIf the function is [[smooth function|smooth]], or, at least twice continuously differentiable, a critical point may be either a [[local maximum]], a [[local minimum]] or a [[saddle point]]. The different cases may be distinguished by considering the [[eigenvalue]]s of the [[Hessian matrix]] of second derivatives.\n\nBy [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)|Fermat's theorem]], all local [[maxima and minima]] of a differentiable function occur at critical points. Therefore, to find the local maxima and minima, it suffices, theoretically, to compute the zeros of the gradient and the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at these zeros.\n\n===Physics and engineering===\nVector calculus is particularly useful in studying:\n*[[Center of mass]]\n*[[Field theory (physics)|Field theory]]\n*[[Kinematics]]\n*[[Maxwell's equations]]\n\n==Generalizations==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\n===Different 3-manifolds===\nVector calculus is initially defined for [[Euclidean space|Euclidean 3-space]], <math>\\mathbb{R}^3,</math> which has additional structure beyond simply being a 3-dimensional real vector space, namely: a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] (giving a notion of length) defined via an [[inner product]] (the [[dot product]]), which in turn gives a notion of angle, and an [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]], which gives a notion of left-handed and right-handed. These structures give rise to a [[volume form]], and also the [[cross product]], which is used pervasively in vector calculus.\n\nThe gradient and divergence require only the inner product, while the curl and the cross product also requires the handedness of the [[coordinate system]] to be taken into account (see [[Cross product#Cross product and handedness|cross product and handedness]] for more detail).\n\nVector calculus can be defined on other 3-dimensional real vector spaces if they have an inner product (or more generally a symmetric [[nondegenerate form]]) and an orientation; note that this is less data than an isomorphism to Euclidean space, as it does not require a set of coordinates (a frame of reference), which reflects the fact that vector calculus is invariant under rotations (the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(3)).\n\nMore generally, vector calculus can be defined on any 3-dimensional oriented [[Riemannian manifold]], or more generally [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]. This structure simply means that the [[tangent space]] at each point has an inner product (more generally, a symmetric nondegenerate form) and an orientation, or more globally that there is a symmetric nondegenerate [[metric tensor]] and an orientation, and works because vector calculus is defined in terms of tangent vectors at each point.\n\n=== Other dimensions ===\nMost of the analytic results are easily understood, in a more general form, using the machinery of [[differential geometry]], of which vector calculus forms a subset. Grad and div generalize immediately to other dimensions, as do the gradient theorem, divergence theorem, and Laplacian (yielding [[harmonic analysis]]), while curl and cross product do not generalize as directly.\n\nFrom a general point of view, the various fields in (3-dimensional) vector calculus are uniformly seen as being ''k''-vector fields: scalar fields are 0-vector fields, vector fields are 1-vector fields, pseudovector fields are 2-vector fields, and pseudoscalar fields are 3-vector fields. In higher dimensions there are additional types of fields (scalar/vector/pseudovector/pseudoscalar corresponding to 0/1/''n''&minus;1/''n'' dimensions, which is exhaustive in dimension 3), so one cannot only work with (pseudo)scalars and (pseudo)vectors.\n\nIn any dimension, assuming a nondegenerate form, grad of a scalar function is a vector field, and div of a vector field is a scalar function, but only in dimension 3 or 7<ref>Lizhong Peng & Lei Yang (1999) \"The curl in seven dimensional space and its applications\", ''Approximation Theory and Its Applications'' 15(3): 66 to 80 {{doi|10.1007/BF02837124}}</ref> (and, trivially, in dimension 0 or 1) is the curl of a vector field a vector field, and only in 3 or [[seven-dimensional cross product|7]] dimensions can a cross product be defined (generalizations in other dimensionalities either require <math>n-1</math> vectors to yield 1 vector, or are alternative [[Lie algebra]]s, which are more general antisymmetric bilinear products). The generalization of grad and div, and how curl may be generalized is elaborated at [[Curl (mathematics)#Generalizations|Curl: Generalizations]]; in brief, the curl of a vector field is a [[bivector]] field, which may be interpreted as the [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]] of infinitesimal rotations; however, this cannot be identified with a vector field because the dimensions differ \u2013 there are 3 dimensions of rotations in 3 dimensions, but 6 dimensions of rotations in 4 dimensions (and more generally <math>\\textstyle{\\binom{n}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)}</math> dimensions of rotations in ''n'' dimensions).\n\nThere are two important alternative generalizations of vector calculus. The first, [[geometric algebra]], uses [[multivector|''k''-vector]] fields instead of vector fields (in 3 or fewer dimensions, every ''k''-vector field can be identified with a scalar function or vector field, but this is not true in higher dimensions). This replaces the cross product, which is specific to 3 dimensions, taking in two vector fields and giving as output a vector field, with the [[exterior product]], which exists in all dimensions and takes in two vector fields, giving as output a bivector (2-vector) field. This product yields [[Clifford algebra]]s as the algebraic structure on vector spaces (with an orientation and nondegenerate form). Geometric algebra is mostly used in generalizations of physics and other applied fields to higher dimensions.\n\nThe second generalization uses [[differential form]]s (''k''-covector fields) instead of vector fields or ''k''-vector fields, and is widely used in mathematics, particularly in [[differential geometry]], [[geometric topology]], and [[harmonic analysis]], in particular yielding [[Hodge theory]] on oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. From this point of view, grad, curl, and div correspond to the [[exterior derivative]] of 0-forms, 1-forms, and 2-forms, respectively, and the key theorems of vector calculus are all special cases of the general form of [[Stokes' theorem]].\n\nFrom the point of view of both of these generalizations, vector calculus implicitly identifies mathematically distinct objects, which makes the presentation simpler but the underlying mathematical structure and generalizations less clear.\nFrom the point of view of geometric algebra, vector calculus implicitly identifies ''k''-vector fields with vector fields or scalar functions: 0-vectors and 3-vectors with scalars, 1-vectors and 2-vectors with vectors. From the point of view of differential forms, vector calculus implicitly identifies ''k''-forms with scalar fields or vector fields: 0-forms and 3-forms with scalar fields, 1-forms and 2-forms with vector fields. Thus for example the curl naturally takes as input a vector field or 1-form, but naturally has as output a 2-vector field or 2-form (hence pseudovector field), which is then interpreted as a vector field, rather than directly taking a vector field to a vector field; this is reflected in the curl of a vector field in higher dimensions not having as output a vector field.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Real-valued function]]\n* [[Function of a real variable]]\n* [[Function of several real variables]]\n* [[Vector calculus identities]]\n* [[Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates]]\n* [[Directional derivative]]\n* [[Conservative vector field]]\n* [[Solenoidal vector field]]\n* [[Laplacian vector field]]\n* [[Helmholtz decomposition]]\n* [[Orthogonal coordinates]]\n* [[Skew coordinates]]\n* [[Curvilinear coordinates]]\n* [[Tensor]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Sandro Caparrini (2002) \"[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs004070200001?LI=true The discovery of the vector representation of moments and angular velocity]\", Archive for History of Exact Sciences 56:151\u201381.\n* {{cite book | first = Michael J. |last = Crowe  | title = A History of Vector Analysis : The Evolution of the Idea of a Vectorial System | publisher = Dover Publications |edition = reprint | year= 1967 | isbn = 978-0-486-67910-5 | title-link = A History of Vector Analysis }}\n* {{cite book | first = J.

He has a romantic relationship with Angel Aasirvatham, a [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] who comically refuses to marry any groom at the last minute due to their love during her wedding. He has a running feud with a rival don named Daniel. One night, Daniel attacks Michael and his close friend Kathir, who is the coach of the [[Tamil Nadu]] women's [[association football|football]] team. Kathir suffers spinal injuries during the attack, due to which he is paralyzed for a year. To allow the women's football team to take part in the upcoming National Championship in [[Delhi]], Kathir requests to the Tamil Nadu Football Federation to replace him with his former teammate named \"Bigil\", who is none other than Michael. The story then shifts to Michael's past as a football player.\n\nSeven years earlier, Michael was an aspiring footballer and contributed to victories for the Tamil Nadu football team along with Kathir. His father was Rayappan, a don who had a feud with a rival don named Alex, who was Daniel's father. Rayappan encouraged his son's passion for football as he did not want him to end up as a criminal like him. When Michael was unable to make it to the [[India national football team|Indian football team]] due to Rayappan's criminal record, Rayappan personally took up the matter with the [[All India Football Federation]] president J. K. Sharma and forcefully ensured Sharma to include Michael and Kathir in the Indian team probable list. However, despite Rayappan's efforts, Michael's football career was cut short as he witnessed Rayappan being killed by Alex and Daniel, just when he was about to leave for Delhi to attend the selection trial for the Indian football team. Michael then killed Alex in front of Daniel, thereby taking revenge for Rayappan's death, and stayed back in Chennai to become the new leader of his father's gang.\n\nIn the present day, Michael accepts Kathir's request to coach the women's football team and leaves for Delhi with the team, with Angel also accompanying them as team physiotherapist. However, due to his criminal background, the girls refuse to cooperate with him, even blaming him for the team's opening loss to [[Manipur]] in the National Championship and requesting the Federation to have him removed. Dejected, Michael gives his resignation to Sharma, but he soon realises that Sharma is targeting him in revenge for the humiliation that he had faced at the hands of Rayappan to allow him into the Indian football team. Sharma sends armed assailants to attack Michael; however, Michael subdues the assailants and withdraws his resignation. He convinces the girls to support him and starts training them hard with the sole focus of winning the Championship. He even manages to bring back two former key players to boost the team's strength: Gayathri, a [[Tamil Brahmin|Brahmin]] girl who had to quit playing football after she was married to a conservative family; and Anitha, who went into depression and refused to leave her room after a man [[acid attack|threw acid]] on her face as she spurned his advances. Despite Sharma trying to rig the team's next match against [[Haryana]] so that they will be eliminated and sent home, they manage to beat Haryana and win all their remaining matches, eventually qualifying for the Final at Chennai, where they are to play Manipur again.\n\nOn the eve of the Final, one of the team's players, Vembu, is kidnapped and forcefully injected with [[cocaine]] by Daniel, who is hired by Sharma in order to sabotage the team's chances of winning the Championship. Though she recovers, she is unable to play in the final as she would fail the dope test. The team's captain, Thendral, is also kidnapped by Daniel, who attempts to forcefully inject cocaine on her as well; however, Michael manages to rescue her. Michael proceeds to kill Daniel once and for all, but when he sees Daniel's young son, he changes his mind and spares Daniel, as he does not want the young boy's future to end up like him by seeing his father die. The next day, Tamil Nadu plays the Final against Manipur without Vembu. The match turns out to be a thriller with Tamil Nadu winning the Championship through a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Michael and the team dedicate their success to Kathir, who is watching the match from the dugout in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring the [[Closing credits|credits]], Michael gets Sharma framed for drug possession, leading to Sharma's arrest in [[Malaysia]], where he is on a holiday. A few months later, Michael, no longer a rowdy, takes up football coaching for children, with one of his wards being the son of Daniel, who has made peace with Michael.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] in dual roles as Michael (Bigil), and as his father, Rayappan\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Angel Aasirvatham, Michael's love interest\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as J.

He has a romantic relationship with Angel Aasirvatham, a [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] who comically refuses to marry any groom at the last minute due to their love during her wedding. He has a running feud with a rival don named Daniel. One night, Daniel attacks Michael and his close friend Kathir, who is the coach of the [[Tamil Nadu]] women's [[association football|football]] team. Kathir suffers spinal injuries during the attack, due to which he is paralyzed for a year. To allow the women's football team to take part in the upcoming National Championship in [[Delhi]], Kathir requests to the Tamil Nadu Football Federation to replace him with his former teammate named \"Bigil\", who is none other than Michael. The story then shifts to Michael's past as a football player.\n\nSeven years earlier, Michael was an aspiring footballer and contributed to victories for the Tamil Nadu football team along with Kathir. His father was Rayappan, a don who had a feud with a rival don named Alex, who was Daniel's father. Rayappan encouraged his son's passion for football as he did not want him to end up as a criminal like him. When Michael was unable to make it to the [[India national football team|Indian football team]] due to Rayappan's criminal record, Rayappan personally took up the matter with the [[All India Football Federation]] president J. K. Sharma and forcefully ensured Sharma to include Michael and Kathir in the Indian team probable list. However, despite Rayappan's efforts, Michael's football career was cut short as he witnessed Rayappan being killed by Alex and Daniel, just when he was about to leave for Delhi to attend the selection trial for the Indian football team. Michael then killed Alex in front of Daniel, thereby taking revenge for Rayappan's death, and stayed back in Chennai to become the new leader of his father's gang.\n\nIn the present day, Michael accepts Kathir's request to coach the women's football team and leaves for Delhi with the team, with Angel also accompanying them as team physiotherapist. However, due to his criminal background, the girls refuse to cooperate with him, even blaming him for the team's opening loss to [[Manipur]] in the National Championship and requesting the Federation to have him removed. Dejected, Michael gives his resignation to Sharma, but he soon realises that Sharma is targeting him in revenge for the humiliation that he had faced at the hands of Rayappan to allow him into the Indian football team. Sharma sends armed assailants to attack Michael; however, Michael subdues the assailants and withdraws his resignation. He convinces the girls to support him and starts training them hard with the sole focus of winning the Championship. He even manages to bring back two former key players to boost the team's strength: Gayathri, a [[Tamil Brahmin|Brahmin]] girl who had to quit playing football after she was married to a conservative family; and Anitha, who went into depression and refused to leave her room after a man [[acid attack|threw acid]] on her face as she spurned his advances. Despite Sharma trying to rig the team's next match against [[Haryana]] so that they will be eliminated and sent home, they manage to beat Haryana and win all their remaining matches, eventually qualifying for the Final at Chennai, where they are to play Manipur again.\n\nOn the eve of the Final, one of the team's players, Vembu, is kidnapped and forcefully injected with [[cocaine]] by Daniel, who is hired by Sharma in order to sabotage the team's chances of winning the Championship. Though she recovers, she is unable to play in the final as she would fail the dope test. The team's captain, Thendral, is also kidnapped by Daniel, who attempts to forcefully inject cocaine on her as well; however, Michael manages to rescue her. Michael proceeds to kill Daniel once and for all, but when he sees Daniel's young son, he changes his mind and spares Daniel, as he does not want the young boy's future to end up like him by seeing his father die. The next day, Tamil Nadu plays the Final against Manipur without Vembu. The match turns out to be a thriller with Tamil Nadu winning the Championship through a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Michael and the team dedicate their success to Kathir, who is watching the match from the dugout in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring the [[Closing credits|credits]], Michael gets Sharma framed for drug possession, leading to Sharma's arrest in [[Malaysia]], where he is on a holiday.

The game is chronologically the sixth installment in the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, which is part of the larger ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise. It was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation 4]] in Japan in September 2016 and worldwide in April 2017. It was published by Atlus in Japan and North America and by [[Deep Silver]] in Europe and Australia. An expanded version featuring new content, '''''Persona 5 Royal''''',{{efn|Known as ''Persona 5: The Royal'' {{nihongo||\u30da\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca5 \u30b6\u30fb\u30ed\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb|Perusona Faibu Za Roiyaru}} in Japanese}} was released in Japan in October 2019 and worldwide in March 2020.\n\n''Persona 5'' takes place in modern-day [[Tokyo]] and follows [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] after his transfer to Shujin Academy due to being put on probation for an assault of which he was falsely accused. During a school year, he and other students awaken to special powers, becoming a group of secret [[vigilante]]s known as the [[Phantom Thieves of Hearts]]. They explore the Metaverse, a supernatural realm born from humanity's subconscious desires, to steal malevolent intent from the hearts of adults. As with previous games in the series, the party battles enemies known as Shadows using physical manifestations of their psyche known as the [[Persona (series)#Personas|Persona]]. The game incorporates role-playing and [[dungeon crawl]]ing elements alongside [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] scenarios.\n\n''Persona 5'' was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus led by game director and producer [[Katsura Hashino]]. Along with Hashino, returning staff from earlier ''Persona'' games included character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]] and music composer [[Shoji Meguro]]. Preparatory work began during the development of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning after the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011. First announced in 2013, ''Persona 5'' was delayed from its original late 2014 release date due to the game not being fully finished. The game's themes revolved around attaining freedom from the limitations of modern society, while its story was strongly inspired by [[picaresque fiction]] and the party's Personas being based on well-known literary outlaws and rebels.\n\n''Persona 5'' was met with critical acclaim, with praise given to its visual presentation and art direction, cast, gameplay, and music. The game is considered to be one of the greatest role-playing games of all time and was nominated for and won multiple awards. The game shipped over three million copies worldwide by the end of 2019, making it the best-selling entry in the overall ''Megami Tensei'' franchise. Several other media, including two spin-off games, ''[[Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight]]'' and ''[[Persona 5 Scramble]]'', as well as manga and [[Persona 5: The Animation|anime adaptations]], have also been released. The game's cast has also made appearances in other games, such as Joker appearing as a playable character in the 2018 crossover fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{See also|Persona (series)#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of the Persona series}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| footer = [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], the game's protagonist, has two alternating lifestyles: a normal student life ''(top)'', and adventures into otherworldly locations ''(bottom)''.\n| image1 = Persona 5 Classroom.jpg\n| width1 = 250\n| image2 = Persona 5 Palace Combat.jpg\n| width2 = 250\n}}\n''Persona 5'' is a [[role-playing video game]] where the player takes on the role of a high school student, codenamed [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], who lives out a single year while attending school in modern-day [[Tokyo]]. The game is governed by a day-night cycle and weather systems that determine general behavior similar to a [[social simulation game]]. The year is punctuated by both scripted and random events as Joker attends school. He can perform part-time jobs and pursue leisure activities or create battle items. These various activities raise character attributes, which grant passive [[Status effect#Buffs|buffing]] effects during battle.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/> When in the real world, the main protagonist can develop character relationships known as ''Confidants''; an evolution of the ''Social Link'' system from ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''[[Persona 4]]''. With this system, the main protagonist can converse with and improve his relationship with other characters he meets, with some leading to possible romances. Improving Confidant ranks with [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] members unlocks various abilities for use in combat, such as the \"Baton Pass\" ability, which allows the player to directly select another character after a critical hit while granting a temporary attack boost.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/> Improving ranks with non-party Confidants grant other bonuses, such as giving access to new [[Item (gaming)|items]] and equipment and boosting [[experience point]] and yen gain.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nAlongside the normal school life is [[dungeon crawl]]ing gameplay of two different types within a realm called the Metaverse: story-specific dungeons called Palaces and randomly-generated Mementos dungeons. Both are populated by Shadows, physical manifestations of suppressed psyches that are modeled after mythological and religious figures. Within Mementos dungeons, the party can fulfill requests from [[non-playable character]]s (NPCs) received from a \"Confidant\" links.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> While navigating, the party uses stealth to avoid the sight of enemy Shadows, and some areas hold puzzles that can be solved using an insight ability known as \"Third Eye\",<ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/> which highlights interactable objects and enemy strength compared to the party. When exploring story-centered Palaces, an \"Alertness Meter\" is present, where the party being spotted or fleeing combat results in security being raised. If security reaches 100%, the party is forced to leave the Palace. The Alertness level can be lowered by launching surprise attacks on and eliminating enemies, and also lowers automatically overnight.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/> Throughout Palaces are locations known as \"safe rooms\". In them, the player can [[Saved game|save their game]], heal their party, and [[fast travel]] to other safe rooms within the Palace.\n\nAs with previous entries in the series, the game uses a [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] combat system: battles can be initiated when the party runs into an enemy, or they can launch a surprise attack and gain an advantage in battle. In battle, the party has access to both melee and gun weapons, in addition to being able to summon Personas, manifestations of the main characters' inner psyche used mainly for special attacks.<ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"ShackMasks\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |title=Persona 5 Royal New PS4 Game 2020?? |last=Teja|first=Ravi |publisher=Raviteja|date=March 4, 2020 |accessdate=March 4, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830213249/https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |archivedate=March 4, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ShackMasks\"/> If a character strikes an enemy's weakness, they knock the enemy down and are awarded an additional turn. If all enemies are knocked down, a \"Hold Up\" is triggered. During one, the party can launch a devastating \"All-Out Attack\", demand money or items, or enter a negotiation. Negotiation allows Joker to win the selected Shadow over to their side to become a new Persona: they can only be persuaded to join if Joker is their level or higher.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"DigiGameplay\"/> Similar to previous entries, party members can be knocked out, and if the main character is knocked out, the game ends. At times, if a party member is knocked out, they can be captured by enemy Shadows, and is unable to return to the party if the resultant negotiation fails.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\nNew Personas are gained from battle through successful negotiation, and different Persona types are represented through different arcana linked to Confidant links. Personas can be combined, or \"fused\", or otherwise further manipulated within the Velvet Room, a realm Joker visits as part of his journey through the story.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/><ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/> In the Velvet Room, Personas can be fused with \"Guillotine\" fusion processes, with the resultant Persona inheriting skills and stats from its parents. The more skills a Persona has, the more are passed on to the fused Persona. How powerful Personas are through fusion depends on how advanced its associated Confidant link is. Also, Personas can be sacrificed in various ways, also styled after styles of capital punishment: \"Hanging\" grants a sacrificed Persona's experience points to another chosen Persona, and \"Electric Chair\" sacrifice one to create a high-end item. A Persona can also be sent into \"Solitary Confinement\", where they undergo intensive training and gain additional skills quicker than normal. The number of days a Persona must remain to gain strength lessens based on its arcana strength.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/>\n\nMinor multiplayer elements are incorporated into the game through the \"Thieves Guild\" feature. Similar to the \"Vox Populi\" system from ''Persona 4 Golden'', players have the option of seeing what activities other players did during any given day. Players can send messages to each other, in addition to affecting the Alertness meter in the player's favor, and aiding in battle when a party member is taken hostage by an enemy.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting and characters===\n{{Main Article|List of Persona 5 characters}}\n''Persona 5'' takes place within the ''Persona'' universe, revolving around a group of high school students who harness Personas, physical manifestations of their inner psyche.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/> ''Persona 5'' is set in modern-day Tokyo, in April of the year \"20XX\", with navigable real-world locations within the city including [[Akihabara]], [[Shinjuku]] and [[Shibuya]].<ref name=\"P5year\"/> Alongside larger environments, there are specific locations that can be entered, such as shops, restaurants and movie theaters. A major setting throughout the game is Shujin Academy, a high school that the protagonist attends.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/> The second major location is the \"Metaverse\", a supernatural realm consisting of the physical manifestation of humanity's subconscious desires. In the Metaverse, people with corrupted enough desires form their own unique \"Palace\", which is modeled after their distorted perception of the world, along with a Shadow version of themselves possessing a \"Treasure\" symbolic of their desires.<ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"PMythDetail\"/> Returning from earlier entries is the Velvet Room, a place that exists for the growth of Persona users that shifts appearance depending on the current guest: in ''Persona 5'', it takes the form of a prison.<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe [[player character]] is a [[silent protagonist]], a commonplace feature in other ''Persona'' games, codenamed [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]]. He becomes the leader of a [[vigilante]] group known as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, who change the hearts of criminals and other malevolent people through the Metaverse.<ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> He forms it with Morgana, a mysterious cat-like creature who serves as the Thieves' second-in-command, who wants to discover his origins and restore his true form. Other founding members include school delinquent Ryuji Sakamoto and fashion model Ann Takamaki. More people join the group throughout the game, including art prodigy Yusuke Kitagawa, student council president [[Makoto Niijima]], [[hikikomori]] computer hacker Futaba Sakura, and cultured corporate heiress Haru Okumura.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Also interacting with Joker are Goro Akechi, a high school detective; Sae Niijima, public prosecutor and Makoto's older sister; and the residents of the Velvet Room, Igor and his two assistants Caroline and Justine.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"KotakuLysis\"/> Joker also has interactions with other confidants, including his caretaker and Futaba's adoptive father Sojiro Sakura, classmate Yuuki Mishima, his teacher and part-time maid Sadayo Kawakami, arcade gamer Shinya Oda, journalist Ichiko Ohya, [[fortune teller]] Chihaya Mifune, [[shogi]] master Hifumi Togo, doctor Tae Takemi, politician Toranosuke Yoshida, and [[model gun]] store owner Munehisa Iwai.\n\n===Plot===\nAfter Joker defends a woman from being abused by a drunken man on the street, he is falsely charged with assault and put on [[probation]], resulting in expulsion from his school. Joker is sent to Tokyo to stay with his family associate Sojiro Sakura and attend Shujin Academy during his year-long probation. After his arrival, he is drawn into the Velvet Room, where Igor warns him that he must \"rehabilitate\" to avoid forthcoming ruin, and grants him access to a supernatural mobile app that leads Joker into the Metaverse and the Palace of the school's abusive volleyball coach Suguru Kamoshida. Joker meets Morgana, who informs him of the ability to change wicked people's hearts by stealing their \"Treasure\", the emotional root of their behavior, from the Palaces ruled by their Shadow selves. After successfully reforming Kamoshida, Ryuji, Joker, Ann, and Morgana form the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, stealing corruption from the hearts of adults to reform the city.\n\nAs the number of the Phantom Thieves' members and successes grows, they attract the attention of the public and police, including public prosecutor Sae Niijima and detective prodigy Goro Akechi. The Phantom Thieves learn that another secret group, including a black-masked assassin, is using the Metaverse to murder their targets and then framing the Phantom Thieves of Hearts for the killings. In pursuit of the conspiracy, the group is joined by Akechi, who is subsequently revealed to be the black-masked assassin. Escaping into hiding with Sae's help, the Phantom Thieves deduce that the conspiracy's leader is politician Masayoshi Shido, who has been using Akechi's ability to infiltrate the Metaverse to remove obstacles to his becoming Prime Minister and imposing his reforms on Japan, as well as the one who pressed assault charges against Joker. When the Phantom Thieves infiltrate Shido's Palace, they face Akechi, who reveals himself to be Shido's illegitimate son. He also reveals that he has been secretly plotting to exact his revenge on Shido for years of neglect and summons his true Persona: Loki. Once defeated, Akechi sacrifices himself to protect the Phantom Thieves from a group of enemies, allowing them to escape and reach Shido.\n\nDespite Shido's arrest and confession after his change of heart, the public remains uninterested and has lost trust in both authority and the Phantom Thieves. In response, the Phantom Thieves make a final heist to infiltrate the depths of Mementos and steal the treasure at its core. Inside, they discover that the public is in chaos and has chosen to give up their autonomy. The Phantom Thieves are then ejected from Mementos by the Treasure, taking form as the Holy Grail, and vanish after witnessing the Metaverse merge with reality. Waking in the Velvet Room, Joker confronts Igor, Caroline, and Justine. Caroline and Justine regain their memories and merge into Lavenza, their true form. Lavenza reveals the Igor Joker has been seeing in the Velvet room up until this point to be an imposter who imprisoned the real Igor. The imposter is then revealed to be [[Yaldabaoth]], the Holy Grail, who was created from humanity's wish to give up control. Through a bet made with Igor over humanity's goals, Yaldabaoth had given Joker and Akechi their abilities to see whether the world would be preserved or be destroyed through their actions, all while steering the game in his favor.\n\nJoker rejects Yaldabaoth's offer to return to his world at the cost of his freedom, and he, along with the rest of the Phantom Thieves, fight him. Joker's confidants rally the popular support of the people, rebelling against Yaldabaoth's control of humanity and allowing Joker to awaken his ultimate persona to destroy Yaldabaoth and the Metaverse. After Yaldabaoth's defeat, in order for Shido to be prosecuted, Joker must turn himself into the police. While Joker is incarcerated, the rest of the Phantom Thieves and his confidants successfully help secure evidence of Joker's innocence in the assault charge, leading to his conviction being overturned. By spring, Joker's friends drive him back to his hometown.\n\n===''Royal''===\nIn ''Persona 5 Royal'', two new characters interact with the Phantom Thieves: Kasumi Yoshizawa, an accomplished rhythmic gymnast who transferred to Shujin at the same time as the protagonist, and Takuto Maruki, a school counselor hired after Kamoshida is exposed. Kasumi awakens to her Persona after calling the protagonist to a new Palace in Odaiba that quickly vanishes. Maruki, in turn, talks to each of the Phantom Thieves, learning their deepest wishes. After defeating Yaldabaoth, the still-living Akechi turns himself over to Sae in the protagonist's place. At the beginning of the following year, the protagonist finds reality distorted; Akechi was released without reason, and each Phantom Thief member has had their deepest wish granted. The protagonist and Akechi, together with the also-aware Kasumi, return to the Odaiba Palace and investigate. The Palace's master is Maruki, who reveals that \"Kasumi\" is Sumire, sister to the original Kasumi, who died in a car accident saving Sumire.\n\nMaruki can use his Persona to alter a person's reality, with his first use of it being to make his then-girlfriend forget her parents' murder. Yaldabaoth's manipulation of the world drove Maruki and his Persona over the edge, and they became the new controllers of Mementos and warped all reality into a dream-like ideal. Sumire turns against the protagonist to protect her identity as \"Kasumi.\" The protagonist snaps his friends out of Maruki's reality, then frees Sumire from his influence. Depending on player choices, it is revealed that Akechi's survival is dependant on the new reality, and Maruki offers the protagonist the option of accepting it to save Akechi. Refusing the offer, the reformed Phantom Thieves, including Akechi and Sumire, defeat Maruki. Reality returns to normal, and with Akechi missing and the protagonist in prison.\n\nOn their final meeting after the protagonist's release, each member of the Phantom Thieves chooses to pursue their dreams within the current reality. On the day he is due to return home, the protagonist escapes tailing government agents with help from both the Phantom Thieves and a reformed Maruki. At the station, Sumire bids him farewell. If Akechi's confidant level is at its highest, and with the right dialogue choices, a man wearing Akechi's clothes is briefly seen passing through the train window that the protagonist is riding.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus dedicated to handling the ''Persona'' series. Preparatory development of the game began in 2008, following the release of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning following the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011.<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/><ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Hashino was only fully involved in development after ''Catherine'' was finished, later calling the latter game a test for the next ''Persona'' game's development. Development lasted five years.<ref name=\"PersonaBlog\"/><ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> ''Persona 5'' would be Hashino's last game in the series as the leader of P-Studio, as he would afterwards form a separate internal team called Studio Zero.<ref name=\"P5studioA\"/><ref name=\"P5studioB\"/> When production started, the staff consisted of around 40 people. During full production, this number expanded to 70: 15 planners, 15 programmers, and between 30 and 45 designers. These included the game's lead designer Naoya Maeda, who had previously done modeling work for the ''[[Trauma Center (video game series)|Trauma Center]]'' series. The general development was a challenge for the team, as they intentionally changed their development structure due to the more powerful hardware they were working with.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/>\n\nWhile the final game retained the turn-based system from earlier entries, one of the early design drafts was for an action-based system incorporating real-time elements foreign to the series. This idea was ultimately scrapped, but real-time command elements were introduced into the battle system, allowing the gameplay to evolve without extensive changes to the core system.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> A major new addition was the inclusions of unique dungeons with locked layouts as opposed to the dominant randomly generated dungeons of previous ''Persona'' games. This was done to both emulate the game's themes and provide veteran players with something different.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\"/> A returning feature from both earlier ''Persona'' games and the mainline ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series was Negotiation: as it was considered a key part of the overall franchise by fans, Hashino decided to reintroduce it after being absent from the previous two mainline entries. The Negotiation system for ''Persona 5'' was tied into the origins of Shadows as suppressed psyches within the Collective Unconscious. The \"Hold Up\" function was inspired by scenes in films where the antagonist would hold people at gunpoint and make demands. These functions were incorporated due to the game being in part a celebration of the series' history.<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> While designing the gameplay elements, the weather, and environmental elements were all designed to reflect the real world. Dungeon layout was split into three distinct types: the Tokyo overworld environments, \"institutions\" such as Joker's high school, and dungeon environments.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Some segments took control away from the player aside from limited dialogue choices; this was chosen as it reflected the controlled environment of Japanese high schoolers.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/>\n\nWhile ''Catherine'' used the third-party [[Gamebryo]] [[game engine]], ''Persona 5'' used a specially-created engine. Hashino believed that the new engine would make rendering their ideas much easier, although it would result in a long wait by fans for the game.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CathBryon\"/> The event scene software was also developed internally by Atlus, with an estimated 1,160 being featured in the final game. The tools for developing and handling them were greatly expanded over the previous two entries to properly communicate them to players on the more advanced hardware.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Character modeling, in general, was handled with a specially-developed toon shader which helped properly translate the character designs into the game, while also allowing for easy adjustment of shaders and lighting effects during fine-tuning.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> The characters were originally rendered realistically like in ''Catherine'', but the team felt that it was \"wrong\" for the ''Persona'' series. With this in mind, the team did some trial and error before finding a style that satisfied them, doing something similar for the interface and menu design.<ref name=\"P5magazine\"/> In contrast to ''Persona 4'', which had a general deformed look to hardware limitations on the variety of body shapes, the technology available to the team for ''Persona 5'' enabled unique customization for all relevant character models. Two different models were used for members of the main cast: a detailed model for real-time cutscenes, and a general-use model for general event scenes and gameplay.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> ''Persona 5'' was the first time a large number of Personas had been rendered in high definition, something which proved a grueling challenge for the team.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/>\n\n===Story and themes===\nThe original story concept was written by Hashino, while the scenario was co-written by Shinji Yamamoto and Yuichiro Tanaka.<ref name=\"P5credits\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/> The initial concept was for a storyline that diverged from the established paths of ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'', with \"self-discovery\" and \"journey\" being its keywords.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Originally using the concept of a [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking trip]] around the world as a framing device for the story, Hashino decided to refocus on Japan in the wake of the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]].<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> More specifically, it has been noted that the Japanese government's actions in response to the earthquake and tsunami's fallout, along with Japanese citizens' reactions to how the government acted during that time, may have served as partial influences on the game's themes.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|title=The Real-World Problems Behind Persona 5|last=McCarthy|first=Caty|date=May 5, 2017|website=USgamer|language=en|access-date=June 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603100720/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|archive-date=June 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Following that crisis and seeing how people were bonding in the face of it, Hashino decided to have the story take place solely in Japan, with the journeying being done through the ever-shifting Palaces.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Ultimately, the story's central concepts were inspired by equivalent social changes he saw in modern society, particularly in Japan.<ref name=\"PMythDetail\" /> Hashino also described the central theme of the game as being about freedom and how the characters attain it.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> He wanted to make the game more \"thematically approachable\" for newcomers to the series, and to be an emotional experience that left its audience with a strong sense of [[catharsis]] and the inspiration to take on problems in their lives.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/><ref name=\"SilCath\"/>\n\nThe narrative of ''Persona 5'' was designed like an omnibus, with the antagonists pursued by the party changing regularly.<ref name=\"P5persona\"/> As inspiration, the development team has also cited three main stories: the Chinese novel ''[[Water Margin]]'', the Japanese crime movie ''Hakuchuu no Shikaku'', and the Spanish novel ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]''.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> Furthermore, the setting and style was compared to a [[Picaresque novel|picaresque fiction]]; the team originally asked the question of how a character like [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]] might win appeal in modern society.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> This picaresque theme was carried over into the aesthetics of Persona fusion and sacrifice, which were themed after styles of capital punishment.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> Having a more \"stereotypical\" theme enabled the team to create surprising story developments, mixing contemporary drama with the setting of the ''Persona'' series. The series' recurring motif of \"masks\" was used more overtly in the game's plot than previous entries as well,<ref name=\"SilP5Fam\"/> and the game's main locations were based heavily on their real-world counterparts.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nThe main characters, according to Hashino, share a mindset that they \"no longer have a place where they belong in society\": the events of the game give them a sense of belonging.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Hashino stated that while the last few games were about the protagonists chasing the antagonists, ''Persona 5'' would instead more prominently feature the antagonists and phenomena caused by them chasing the protagonists during the latter's activities. The characters have been described as \"juvenile academics,\"<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> with their activities as thieves being part of the way they break from societal norms and express themselves. Adhering with this concept, the game's main aim was to show the characters finding the courage to go outside the normal limits of society as set by previous generations.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> In contrast to previous ''Persona'' casts, the party of ''Persona 5'' willingly embrace the unfolding unusual events in their role of masked vigilantes rather than being dragged into them.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> The cast was originally going to be larger with character Hifumi Togo becoming a Phantom Thief, but as the story was already very large, she was relegated to an optional role as part of the Confidant system.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> Technological advances such as [[smartphones]] and the use of [[social media]] were integrated into both the story and gameplay due to their growing prevalence in modern society and how the public responds to real-world scandals.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe characters' initial Personas ([[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin|Ars\u00e8ne]], [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]], [[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]], [[Zorro]], [[Ishikawa Goemon|Goemon]], [[Pope Joan|Johanna]], [[Necronomicon]], [[Milady de Winter|Milady]], [[Robin Hood]]) were themed after outlaws and picaresque heroes to reflect the function and dominant suppressed passions forming the Palace, and also represent aspects of their owners' personalities.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> Joker's initial Persona was originally the German demon [[Mephistopheles]], but it was changed to Ars\u00e8ne as the latter character better fit the game's themes.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> The cast's alternate Personas ([[Satan]]ael, [[Sun Wukong|Seiten Taisei]], [[Hecate]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]], [[Susano-o|Kamu Susanoo]], [[Anat]], [[Prometheus]], [[Astarte]], [[Loki]]) are taken from mythical beings who act as tricksters or rebels.<ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> The three main inspirations behind Joker's alter ego were [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin]], [[The Fiend with Twenty Faces]], and Japanese outlaw hero Ishikawa Goemon.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> The name of Joker's high school, \"Shujin\", was chosen because it was a [[homonym]] of {{nihongo|''Sh\u016bjin''|\u56da\u4eba}}, the Japanese word for \"prisoner\".<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaB\"/> Following a trend from earlier entries, the Velvet Room assistants are named after characters from the novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]].<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe use of adults as antagonists was a more overt expression of narrative elements previously explored in ''Persona 4''. The relation to police activities was also carried over from ''Persona 4'', but this time with the role of protagonists and antagonists reversed.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\" /> Several writers have highlighted the parallels between the game's various antagonists and real incidents/figures in different sectors of Japanese society (e.g. political, corporate, academic), and how the game's story and characters serve as social commentary on life in Japan.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|title=The Real Japan Behind Persona 5|last=Gay|first=Elliot|date=May 12, 2017|website=Anime News Network|language=en|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630013134/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|archive-date=June 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The game's villains and protagonists were also constructed to be parallels of each other, both groups being misfits trying to shape a world they saw as unsatisfactory or corrupted. This was intended to create moral ambiguity about the Phantom Thieves' actions, causing the player to question their concept of justice and their mission as a whole.<ref name=\"4Gstory\" /> In addition, the way a vocal minority online could draw attention to and shift public opinion on events and scandals in the news was cited as an inspiration for the ambiguous nature of the Phantom Thieves' actions.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\" />\n\n===Art design===\n[[Shigenori Soejima]], who had worked on the last two main-series ''Persona'' games, returned as character designer.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> The game's art director was Masayoshi Suto, whose most notable work on earlier games included the [[user interface]] (UI) displays.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> The art design reflected the picaresque theme aimed for by the rest of the team.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> As the team considered previous ''Persona'' games to be \"fun\" but not well marketed, they designed the UI in such a way as to attract a larger, more mainstream audience.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/> According to Soejima, he was working on prospective designs for the game while ''Persona 4'' was still in development, with his designs evolving as the story for ''Persona 5'' came together.<ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/> Aesthetically, the team felt that they were picking up where ''Persona 4'' left off. Its styling presentation was an unintentional reflection on the hurdles the team needed to overcome during development.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> Following the respective thematic coloring of ''Persona 3'' and ''4''{{'s}} blue and yellow, ''Persona 5'' used red, which was chosen to a harsh feeling.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/><ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Because of this, Suto tested multiple font colors until settling on black and white, as it stood out best against it.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> There was also a wish, especially in the teaser image used for the game's announcement, which represented the main characters' being chained down by the rules of the modern world.<ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Soejima designed the logo to convey the high-speed existences of the young cast, while elements such as Joker's Persona Ars\u00e8ne were designed to appear old-fashioned by comparison. This presented challenges as Soejima needed to balance this with a strong sense of style.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The main aim for the game's environments was to create a sense of realism, with Tokyo being modeled after real locations.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=Persona 5's In-Game Locations Compared To The Real World|url=https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|website=Kotaku|accessdate=January 27, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031184625/https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|archivedate=October 31, 2017}}</ref> When creating the UI, Hashino wanted to demonstrate how a shift in perspective could alter a dull life into an exciting one in the context of the story. Early UI designs were so \"aggressively animated\" that it obscured what was happening in the game. Because of this, the animations were toned down and text orientation was altered, toning down the UI's graphical elements to present a balance between user-friendliness and style.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/> Rather than the use of sub-colors for earlier entries, the UI used only the primary red, black and white colors aside from health and magic point meters, with the menus using a special moving 3D model of Joker which would change position depending on the selected menu.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/>\n\nThe first character sketches were submitted in 2012.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaB\"/> Soejima worked closely with Hashino so the characters and environments reflected the game's themes.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> Due to being high school students, Soejima found it difficult to make each main character's uniform design distinctive, so he expressed their individuality through their thief costumes.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Joker's design was cited by Soejima as his most challenging recent work. Joker needed to both convey a taste of the game's overall art style and to act as an avatar for the player. As the main theme and narrative of ''Persona 5'' revolved around crime and vigilantes triggered by Joker voluntarily choosing that path, Soejima needed to convey this while allowing the character to suit whatever dialogue choices the player decided upon. Due to these difficulties, Joker was given multiple designs in a trial and error process to find the best one. As the \"phantom thief\" premise was a common stereotype in fiction, Soejima initially drew Joker and main cast in a style similar to [[sh\u014dnen manga]], but these designs were scrapped as they clashed with the ''Persona'' series' realistic aesthetics. As with previous entries, Joker was a silent character, so as with previous protagonist Soejima had to work out a way he could communicate without dialogue. His solution was to imagine him as the type of person who made plans but did not share them with others.<ref name=\"FamSoejima\"/> The Persona designs, being based on characters from literature, were intended to evoke both familiarity and surprise from players. Once the names were chosen, Soejima designed the Personas based on that character.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/>\n\nThe game's animated [[cutscene]]s were produced by [[Production I.G]] and Domerica, and were directed and supervised by Toshiyuki Kono.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"Domerica\"/> Kono was contacted three and a half years before the game's completion by Hashino: faced with the project, Kono felt a great deal of pressure in his role. ''Persona 5'' was the first time Production I.G had worked on the series, though many staff at the studio were fans. Despite this, the studio did not change their standard animation process, focusing on characters as they had done for many of their previous projects. The most important part of the cutscenes was getting the character's expressions right, particularly when it came to the general-mute protagonist. The game's animated opening sequence was directed by [[Sayo Yamamoto]].<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/> The concept behind the characters figure skating around the environment was done as a visual symbolization of the game's overall theme, breaking free of an oppressive force, and was similar to her work in ''[[Yuri on Ice]]''.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The scene where Joker first summoned his Persona was requested by Atlus to appear \"wild\", which again was difficult to Joker's purpose as an extension of the player. The blue flame effects related to the Persona were not created with CGI, but hand-drawn by the animators. All the anime cutscenes together were estimated as containing over an hour of footage.<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe game's original score was composed, performed, and produced by series sound director [[Shoji Meguro]].<ref name=\"P5liners\"/> Further contributions, among other general sound design, was handled by Toshiki Konishi, Kenichi Tsuchiya, Atsushi Kitajoh, and Ryota Kozuka; all of them having previously worked on the series as well.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Meguro was given full creative freedom to work on the soundtrack, with around 80% of the tracks used in the game being his, which lasted around three years in total.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Seven tracks were performed in English by Lyn Inaizumi, a [[jazz]] and [[soul music]] singer.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/><ref name=\"LynTwitter\"/> Her first performance in a video game, Inaizumi claimed that the most difficult part of her contributions was performing a rap segment in the opening theme, \"Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There\".<ref name=\"PSCmusic\"/> The lyrics were written by Benjamin Franklin, while the ending song, \"Hoshi To Bokura To\", had lyrics written in Japanese by Shigeo Komori.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/>\n\nTo express the game's mood, Meguro incorporated strong [[acid jazz]] elements into the score.<ref name=\"SilComposer\"/> He also aimed to make the music sound more realistic than previous ''Persona'' games, aiming to match the game's visuals.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Meguro also changed the way the music flowed when compared to the last two ''Persona'' games. Instead of the opening and ending themes being conglomerates of the overall score, he described the entire score as a single continuous work. A recurring musical element he included was described as a \"[[Solmization|do-la]]\" syllable: the opening used \"so la re mi\" on strings as a hook, which then led into the \"do-la\" syllable for other tracks, including the normal battle theme. While he was creating the music, Meguro received positive comments from Hashino when he made early tracks created for an internal demo.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/>\n\nA three-disc soundtrack was released in Japan by Mastard Records on January 17, 2017.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Upon its debut, the album reached fifth on the [[Oricon]] charts with sales of over 29,000.<ref name=\"P5OSToricon\"/> The album featured 110 tracks with commentary from the sound team, while the cover and [[liner note]] artwork were designed by Soejima.<ref name=\"P5AlbumInfo\"/> In addition to the soundtrack, a 19-track disc featuring a selection of the main themes from the game, ''Persona 5: Sounds of the Rebellion'', was released as part of the North American and European collector's edition bundle.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> The complete soundtrack later received a localized English release on [[iTunes]] on April 18, 2017, and on vinyl later that year by [[iam8bit]].<ref name=\"P5ostItunes\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Arif|first1=Shabana|title=Persona 5's complete soundtrack is available to pre-order on vinyl as a 6 LP deluxe edition for $175|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|website=VG24/7|accessdate=January 2, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102141737/https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|archivedate=January 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Sega promotional models and Persona 5 title, Taipei Game Show 20170123.jpg|thumb|Promotion of ''Persona 5'' at the 2017 Taipei Game Show]]\n''Persona 5'' was first announced with a teaser trailer in 2013, alongside spin-off games ''[[Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Persona 4: Dancing All Night]]'', and the [[PlayStation 3]] [[Porting|port]] of ''[[Persona 4 Arena Ultimax]]''.<ref name=\"PolyPersona\" /> The game was originally announced for a late 2014 release exclusively for the PlayStation 3. During a Sony press conference in September 2014, it was announced that the game would also be released for the PlayStation 4, also announcing that it had been delayed into 2015. According to director Katsura Hashino, the game was delayed to fully develop for the PlayStation 4, and improve the general quality of the game for both versions.<ref name=\"PersonaPS4\" /> The game's first gameplay trailer was revealed during a special livestream on February 5, 2015. A [[Blu-ray Disc]] containing an exclusive trailer for the game was bundled with first print copies of ''Persona 4: Dancing All Night'' in Japan on June 25, 2015.<ref name=\"ANNreveal\" /> The song used in the first gameplay trailer was an instrumental version of the main theme.<ref name=\"SilComposer\" /> During a special livestream for the game at the 2015 [[Tokyo Game Show]], it was announced that the game would be delayed once again to late 2016.<ref name=\"GIdelay\" /> Speaking in a staff interview, Hashino apologized for the delay and stated that it was necessary to deliver a high-quality product without having to hold back in terms of content.<ref name=\"PersonaDelay\" />\n\nIn April 2016, Atlus launched an official countdown relating to the game that counted down to May 5, 2016.

The game is chronologically the sixth installment in the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, which is part of the larger ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise. It was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation 4]] in Japan in September 2016 and worldwide in April 2017. It was published by Atlus in Japan and North America and by [[Deep Silver]] in Europe and Australia. An expanded version featuring new content, '''''Persona 5 Royal''''',{{efn|Known as ''Persona 5: The Royal'' {{nihongo||\u30da\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca5 \u30b6\u30fb\u30ed\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb|Perusona Faibu Za Roiyaru}} in Japanese}} was released in Japan in October 2019 and worldwide in March 2020.\n\n''Persona 5'' takes place in modern-day [[Tokyo]] and follows [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] after his transfer to Shujin Academy due to being put on probation for an assault of which he was falsely accused. During a school year, he and other students awaken to special powers, becoming a group of secret [[vigilante]]s known as the [[Phantom Thieves of Hearts]]. They explore the Metaverse, a supernatural realm born from humanity's subconscious desires, to steal malevolent intent from the hearts of adults. As with previous games in the series, the party battles enemies known as Shadows using physical manifestations of their psyche known as the [[Persona (series)#Personas|Persona]]. The game incorporates role-playing and [[dungeon crawl]]ing elements alongside [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] scenarios.\n\n''Persona 5'' was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus led by game director and producer [[Katsura Hashino]]. Along with Hashino, returning staff from earlier ''Persona'' games included character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]] and music composer [[Shoji Meguro]]. Preparatory work began during the development of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning after the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011. First announced in 2013, ''Persona 5'' was delayed from its original late 2014 release date due to the game not being fully finished. The game's themes revolved around attaining freedom from the limitations of modern society, while its story was strongly inspired by [[picaresque fiction]] and the party's Personas being based on well-known literary outlaws and rebels.\n\n''Persona 5'' was met with critical acclaim, with praise given to its visual presentation and art direction, cast, gameplay, and music. The game is considered to be one of the greatest role-playing games of all time and was nominated for and won multiple awards. The game shipped over three million copies worldwide by the end of 2019, making it the best-selling entry in the overall ''Megami Tensei'' franchise. Several other media, including two spin-off games, ''[[Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight]]'' and ''[[Persona 5 Scramble]]'', as well as manga and [[Persona 5: The Animation|anime adaptations]], have also been released. The game's cast has also made appearances in other games, such as Joker appearing as a playable character in the 2018 crossover fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{See also|Persona (series)#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of the Persona series}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| footer = [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], the game's protagonist, has two alternating lifestyles: a normal student life ''(top)'', and adventures into otherworldly locations ''(bottom)''.\n| image1 = Persona 5 Classroom.jpg\n| width1 = 250\n| image2 = Persona 5 Palace Combat.jpg\n| width2 = 250\n}}\n''Persona 5'' is a [[role-playing video game]] where the player takes on the role of a high school student, codenamed [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], who lives out a single year while attending school in modern-day [[Tokyo]]. The game is governed by a day-night cycle and weather systems that determine general behavior similar to a [[social simulation game]]. The year is punctuated by both scripted and random events as Joker attends school. He can perform part-time jobs and pursue leisure activities or create battle items. These various activities raise character attributes, which grant passive [[Status effect#Buffs|buffing]] effects during battle.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/> When in the real world, the main protagonist can develop character relationships known as ''Confidants''; an evolution of the ''Social Link'' system from ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''[[Persona 4]]''. With this system, the main protagonist can converse with and improve his relationship with other characters he meets, with some leading to possible romances. Improving Confidant ranks with [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] members unlocks various abilities for use in combat, such as the \"Baton Pass\" ability, which allows the player to directly select another character after a critical hit while granting a temporary attack boost.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/> Improving ranks with non-party Confidants grant other bonuses, such as giving access to new [[Item (gaming)|items]] and equipment and boosting [[experience point]] and yen gain.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nAlongside the normal school life is [[dungeon crawl]]ing gameplay of two different types within a realm called the Metaverse: story-specific dungeons called Palaces and randomly-generated Mementos dungeons. Both are populated by Shadows, physical manifestations of suppressed psyches that are modeled after mythological and religious figures. Within Mementos dungeons, the party can fulfill requests from [[non-playable character]]s (NPCs) received from a \"Confidant\" links.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> While navigating, the party uses stealth to avoid the sight of enemy Shadows, and some areas hold puzzles that can be solved using an insight ability known as \"Third Eye\",<ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/> which highlights interactable objects and enemy strength compared to the party. When exploring story-centered Palaces, an \"Alertness Meter\" is present, where the party being spotted or fleeing combat results in security being raised. If security reaches 100%, the party is forced to leave the Palace. The Alertness level can be lowered by launching surprise attacks on and eliminating enemies, and also lowers automatically overnight.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/> Throughout Palaces are locations known as \"safe rooms\". In them, the player can [[Saved game|save their game]], heal their party, and [[fast travel]] to other safe rooms within the Palace.\n\nAs with previous entries in the series, the game uses a [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] combat system: battles can be initiated when the party runs into an enemy, or they can launch a surprise attack and gain an advantage in battle. In battle, the party has access to both melee and gun weapons, in addition to being able to summon Personas, manifestations of the main characters' inner psyche used mainly for special attacks.<ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"ShackMasks\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |title=Persona 5 Royal New PS4 Game 2020?? |last=Teja|first=Ravi |publisher=Raviteja|date=March 4, 2020 |accessdate=March 4, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830213249/https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |archivedate=March 4, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ShackMasks\"/> If a character strikes an enemy's weakness, they knock the enemy down and are awarded an additional turn. If all enemies are knocked down, a \"Hold Up\" is triggered. During one, the party can launch a devastating \"All-Out Attack\", demand money or items, or enter a negotiation. Negotiation allows Joker to win the selected Shadow over to their side to become a new Persona: they can only be persuaded to join if Joker is their level or higher.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"DigiGameplay\"/> Similar to previous entries, party members can be knocked out, and if the main character is knocked out, the game ends. At times, if a party member is knocked out, they can be captured by enemy Shadows, and is unable to return to the party if the resultant negotiation fails.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\nNew Personas are gained from battle through successful negotiation, and different Persona types are represented through different arcana linked to Confidant links. Personas can be combined, or \"fused\", or otherwise further manipulated within the Velvet Room, a realm Joker visits as part of his journey through the story.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/><ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/> In the Velvet Room, Personas can be fused with \"Guillotine\" fusion processes, with the resultant Persona inheriting skills and stats from its parents. The more skills a Persona has, the more are passed on to the fused Persona. How powerful Personas are through fusion depends on how advanced its associated Confidant link is. Also, Personas can be sacrificed in various ways, also styled after styles of capital punishment: \"Hanging\" grants a sacrificed Persona's experience points to another chosen Persona, and \"Electric Chair\" sacrifice one to create a high-end item. A Persona can also be sent into \"Solitary Confinement\", where they undergo intensive training and gain additional skills quicker than normal. The number of days a Persona must remain to gain strength lessens based on its arcana strength.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/>\n\nMinor multiplayer elements are incorporated into the game through the \"Thieves Guild\" feature. Similar to the \"Vox Populi\" system from ''Persona 4 Golden'', players have the option of seeing what activities other players did during any given day. Players can send messages to each other, in addition to affecting the Alertness meter in the player's favor, and aiding in battle when a party member is taken hostage by an enemy.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting and characters===\n{{Main Article|List of Persona 5 characters}}\n''Persona 5'' takes place within the ''Persona'' universe, revolving around a group of high school students who harness Personas, physical manifestations of their inner psyche.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/> ''Persona 5'' is set in modern-day Tokyo, in April of the year \"20XX\", with navigable real-world locations within the city including [[Akihabara]], [[Shinjuku]] and [[Shibuya]].<ref name=\"P5year\"/> Alongside larger environments, there are specific locations that can be entered, such as shops, restaurants and movie theaters. A major setting throughout the game is Shujin Academy, a high school that the protagonist attends.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/> The second major location is the \"Metaverse\", a supernatural realm consisting of the physical manifestation of humanity's subconscious desires. In the Metaverse, people with corrupted enough desires form their own unique \"Palace\", which is modeled after their distorted perception of the world, along with a Shadow version of themselves possessing a \"Treasure\" symbolic of their desires.<ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"PMythDetail\"/> Returning from earlier entries is the Velvet Room, a place that exists for the growth of Persona users that shifts appearance depending on the current guest: in ''Persona 5'', it takes the form of a prison.<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe [[player character]] is a [[silent protagonist]], a commonplace feature in other ''Persona'' games, codenamed [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]]. He becomes the leader of a [[vigilante]] group known as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, who change the hearts of criminals and other malevolent people through the Metaverse.<ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> He forms it with Morgana, a mysterious cat-like creature who serves as the Thieves' second-in-command, who wants to discover his origins and restore his true form. Other founding members include school delinquent Ryuji Sakamoto and fashion model Ann Takamaki. More people join the group throughout the game, including art prodigy Yusuke Kitagawa, student council president [[Makoto Niijima]], [[hikikomori]] computer hacker Futaba Sakura, and cultured corporate heiress Haru Okumura.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Also interacting with Joker are Goro Akechi, a high school detective; Sae Niijima, public prosecutor and Makoto's older sister; and the residents of the Velvet Room, Igor and his two assistants Caroline and Justine.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"KotakuLysis\"/> Joker also has interactions with other confidants, including his caretaker and Futaba's adoptive father Sojiro Sakura, classmate Yuuki Mishima, his teacher and part-time maid Sadayo Kawakami, arcade gamer Shinya Oda, journalist Ichiko Ohya, [[fortune teller]] Chihaya Mifune, [[shogi]] master Hifumi Togo, doctor Tae Takemi, politician Toranosuke Yoshida, and [[model gun]] store owner Munehisa Iwai.\n\n===Plot===\nAfter Joker defends a woman from being abused by a drunken man on the street, he is falsely charged with assault and put on [[probation]], resulting in expulsion from his school. Joker is sent to Tokyo to stay with his family associate Sojiro Sakura and attend Shujin Academy during his year-long probation. After his arrival, he is drawn into the Velvet Room, where Igor warns him that he must \"rehabilitate\" to avoid forthcoming ruin, and grants him access to a supernatural mobile app that leads Joker into the Metaverse and the Palace of the school's abusive volleyball coach Suguru Kamoshida. Joker meets Morgana, who informs him of the ability to change wicked people's hearts by stealing their \"Treasure\", the emotional root of their behavior, from the Palaces ruled by their Shadow selves. After successfully reforming Kamoshida, Ryuji, Joker, Ann, and Morgana form the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, stealing corruption from the hearts of adults to reform the city.\n\nAs the number of the Phantom Thieves' members and successes grows, they attract the attention of the public and police, including public prosecutor Sae Niijima and detective prodigy Goro Akechi. The Phantom Thieves learn that another secret group, including a black-masked assassin, is using the Metaverse to murder their targets and then framing the Phantom Thieves of Hearts for the killings. In pursuit of the conspiracy, the group is joined by Akechi, who is subsequently revealed to be the black-masked assassin. Escaping into hiding with Sae's help, the Phantom Thieves deduce that the conspiracy's leader is politician Masayoshi Shido, who has been using Akechi's ability to infiltrate the Metaverse to remove obstacles to his becoming Prime Minister and imposing his reforms on Japan, as well as the one who pressed assault charges against Joker. When the Phantom Thieves infiltrate Shido's Palace, they face Akechi, who reveals himself to be Shido's illegitimate son. He also reveals that he has been secretly plotting to exact his revenge on Shido for years of neglect and summons his true Persona: Loki. Once defeated, Akechi sacrifices himself to protect the Phantom Thieves from a group of enemies, allowing them to escape and reach Shido.\n\nDespite Shido's arrest and confession after his change of heart, the public remains uninterested and has lost trust in both authority and the Phantom Thieves. In response, the Phantom Thieves make a final heist to infiltrate the depths of Mementos and steal the treasure at its core. Inside, they discover that the public is in chaos and has chosen to give up their autonomy. The Phantom Thieves are then ejected from Mementos by the Treasure, taking form as the Holy Grail, and vanish after witnessing the Metaverse merge with reality. Waking in the Velvet Room, Joker confronts Igor, Caroline, and Justine. Caroline and Justine regain their memories and merge into Lavenza, their true form. Lavenza reveals the Igor Joker has been seeing in the Velvet room up until this point to be an imposter who imprisoned the real Igor. The imposter is then revealed to be [[Yaldabaoth]], the Holy Grail, who was created from humanity's wish to give up control. Through a bet made with Igor over humanity's goals, Yaldabaoth had given Joker and Akechi their abilities to see whether the world would be preserved or be destroyed through their actions, all while steering the game in his favor.\n\nJoker rejects Yaldabaoth's offer to return to his world at the cost of his freedom, and he, along with the rest of the Phantom Thieves, fight him. Joker's confidants rally the popular support of the people, rebelling against Yaldabaoth's control of humanity and allowing Joker to awaken his ultimate persona to destroy Yaldabaoth and the Metaverse. After Yaldabaoth's defeat, in order for Shido to be prosecuted, Joker must turn himself into the police. While Joker is incarcerated, the rest of the Phantom Thieves and his confidants successfully help secure evidence of Joker's innocence in the assault charge, leading to his conviction being overturned. By spring, Joker's friends drive him back to his hometown.\n\n===''Royal''===\nIn ''Persona 5 Royal'', two new characters interact with the Phantom Thieves: Kasumi Yoshizawa, an accomplished rhythmic gymnast who transferred to Shujin at the same time as the protagonist, and Takuto Maruki, a school counselor hired after Kamoshida is exposed. Kasumi awakens to her Persona after calling the protagonist to a new Palace in Odaiba that quickly vanishes. Maruki, in turn, talks to each of the Phantom Thieves, learning their deepest wishes. After defeating Yaldabaoth, the still-living Akechi turns himself over to Sae in the protagonist's place. At the beginning of the following year, the protagonist finds reality distorted; Akechi was released without reason, and each Phantom Thief member has had their deepest wish granted. The protagonist and Akechi, together with the also-aware Kasumi, return to the Odaiba Palace and investigate. The Palace's master is Maruki, who reveals that \"Kasumi\" is Sumire, sister to the original Kasumi, who died in a car accident saving Sumire.\n\nMaruki can use his Persona to alter a person's reality, with his first use of it being to make his then-girlfriend forget her parents' murder. Yaldabaoth's manipulation of the world drove Maruki and his Persona over the edge, and they became the new controllers of Mementos and warped all reality into a dream-like ideal. Sumire turns against the protagonist to protect her identity as \"Kasumi.\" The protagonist snaps his friends out of Maruki's reality, then frees Sumire from his influence. Depending on player choices, it is revealed that Akechi's survival is dependant on the new reality, and Maruki offers the protagonist the option of accepting it to save Akechi. Refusing the offer, the reformed Phantom Thieves, including Akechi and Sumire, defeat Maruki. Reality returns to normal, and with Akechi missing and the protagonist in prison.\n\nOn their final meeting after the protagonist's release, each member of the Phantom Thieves chooses to pursue their dreams within the current reality. On the day he is due to return home, the protagonist escapes tailing government agents with help from both the Phantom Thieves and a reformed Maruki. At the station, Sumire bids him farewell. If Akechi's confidant level is at its highest, and with the right dialogue choices, a man wearing Akechi's clothes is briefly seen passing through the train window that the protagonist is riding.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus dedicated to handling the ''Persona'' series. Preparatory development of the game began in 2008, following the release of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning following the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011.<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/><ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Hashino was only fully involved in development after ''Catherine'' was finished, later calling the latter game a test for the next ''Persona'' game's development. Development lasted five years.<ref name=\"PersonaBlog\"/><ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> ''Persona 5'' would be Hashino's last game in the series as the leader of P-Studio, as he would afterwards form a separate internal team called Studio Zero.<ref name=\"P5studioA\"/><ref name=\"P5studioB\"/> When production started, the staff consisted of around 40 people. During full production, this number expanded to 70: 15 planners, 15 programmers, and between 30 and 45 designers. These included the game's lead designer Naoya Maeda, who had previously done modeling work for the ''[[Trauma Center (video game series)|Trauma Center]]'' series. The general development was a challenge for the team, as they intentionally changed their development structure due to the more powerful hardware they were working with.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/>\n\nWhile the final game retained the turn-based system from earlier entries, one of the early design drafts was for an action-based system incorporating real-time elements foreign to the series. This idea was ultimately scrapped, but real-time command elements were introduced into the battle system, allowing the gameplay to evolve without extensive changes to the core system.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> A major new addition was the inclusions of unique dungeons with locked layouts as opposed to the dominant randomly generated dungeons of previous ''Persona'' games. This was done to both emulate the game's themes and provide veteran players with something different.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\"/> A returning feature from both earlier ''Persona'' games and the mainline ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series was Negotiation: as it was considered a key part of the overall franchise by fans, Hashino decided to reintroduce it after being absent from the previous two mainline entries. The Negotiation system for ''Persona 5'' was tied into the origins of Shadows as suppressed psyches within the Collective Unconscious. The \"Hold Up\" function was inspired by scenes in films where the antagonist would hold people at gunpoint and make demands. These functions were incorporated due to the game being in part a celebration of the series' history.<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> While designing the gameplay elements, the weather, and environmental elements were all designed to reflect the real world. Dungeon layout was split into three distinct types: the Tokyo overworld environments, \"institutions\" such as Joker's high school, and dungeon environments.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Some segments took control away from the player aside from limited dialogue choices; this was chosen as it reflected the controlled environment of Japanese high schoolers.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/>\n\nWhile ''Catherine'' used the third-party [[Gamebryo]] [[game engine]], ''Persona 5'' used a specially-created engine. Hashino believed that the new engine would make rendering their ideas much easier, although it would result in a long wait by fans for the game.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CathBryon\"/> The event scene software was also developed internally by Atlus, with an estimated 1,160 being featured in the final game. The tools for developing and handling them were greatly expanded over the previous two entries to properly communicate them to players on the more advanced hardware.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Character modeling, in general, was handled with a specially-developed toon shader which helped properly translate the character designs into the game, while also allowing for easy adjustment of shaders and lighting effects during fine-tuning.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> The characters were originally rendered realistically like in ''Catherine'', but the team felt that it was \"wrong\" for the ''Persona'' series. With this in mind, the team did some trial and error before finding a style that satisfied them, doing something similar for the interface and menu design.<ref name=\"P5magazine\"/> In contrast to ''Persona 4'', which had a general deformed look to hardware limitations on the variety of body shapes, the technology available to the team for ''Persona 5'' enabled unique customization for all relevant character models. Two different models were used for members of the main cast: a detailed model for real-time cutscenes, and a general-use model for general event scenes and gameplay.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> ''Persona 5'' was the first time a large number of Personas had been rendered in high definition, something which proved a grueling challenge for the team.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/>\n\n===Story and themes===\nThe original story concept was written by Hashino, while the scenario was co-written by Shinji Yamamoto and Yuichiro Tanaka.<ref name=\"P5credits\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/> The initial concept was for a storyline that diverged from the established paths of ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'', with \"self-discovery\" and \"journey\" being its keywords.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Originally using the concept of a [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking trip]] around the world as a framing device for the story, Hashino decided to refocus on Japan in the wake of the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]].<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> More specifically, it has been noted that the Japanese government's actions in response to the earthquake and tsunami's fallout, along with Japanese citizens' reactions to how the government acted during that time, may have served as partial influences on the game's themes.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|title=The Real-World Problems Behind Persona 5|last=McCarthy|first=Caty|date=May 5, 2017|website=USgamer|language=en|access-date=June 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603100720/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|archive-date=June 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Following that crisis and seeing how people were bonding in the face of it, Hashino decided to have the story take place solely in Japan, with the journeying being done through the ever-shifting Palaces.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Ultimately, the story's central concepts were inspired by equivalent social changes he saw in modern society, particularly in Japan.<ref name=\"PMythDetail\" /> Hashino also described the central theme of the game as being about freedom and how the characters attain it.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> He wanted to make the game more \"thematically approachable\" for newcomers to the series, and to be an emotional experience that left its audience with a strong sense of [[catharsis]] and the inspiration to take on problems in their lives.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/><ref name=\"SilCath\"/>\n\nThe narrative of ''Persona 5'' was designed like an omnibus, with the antagonists pursued by the party changing regularly.<ref name=\"P5persona\"/> As inspiration, the development team has also cited three main stories: the Chinese novel ''[[Water Margin]]'', the Japanese crime movie ''Hakuchuu no Shikaku'', and the Spanish novel ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]''.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> Furthermore, the setting and style was compared to a [[Picaresque novel|picaresque fiction]]; the team originally asked the question of how a character like [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]] might win appeal in modern society.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> This picaresque theme was carried over into the aesthetics of Persona fusion and sacrifice, which were themed after styles of capital punishment.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> Having a more \"stereotypical\" theme enabled the team to create surprising story developments, mixing contemporary drama with the setting of the ''Persona'' series. The series' recurring motif of \"masks\" was used more overtly in the game's plot than previous entries as well,<ref name=\"SilP5Fam\"/> and the game's main locations were based heavily on their real-world counterparts.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nThe main characters, according to Hashino, share a mindset that they \"no longer have a place where they belong in society\": the events of the game give them a sense of belonging.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Hashino stated that while the last few games were about the protagonists chasing the antagonists, ''Persona 5'' would instead more prominently feature the antagonists and phenomena caused by them chasing the protagonists during the latter's activities. The characters have been described as \"juvenile academics,\"<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> with their activities as thieves being part of the way they break from societal norms and express themselves. Adhering with this concept, the game's main aim was to show the characters finding the courage to go outside the normal limits of society as set by previous generations.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> In contrast to previous ''Persona'' casts, the party of ''Persona 5'' willingly embrace the unfolding unusual events in their role of masked vigilantes rather than being dragged into them.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> The cast was originally going to be larger with character Hifumi Togo becoming a Phantom Thief, but as the story was already very large, she was relegated to an optional role as part of the Confidant system.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> Technological advances such as [[smartphones]] and the use of [[social media]] were integrated into both the story and gameplay due to their growing prevalence in modern society and how the public responds to real-world scandals.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe characters' initial Personas ([[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin|Ars\u00e8ne]], [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]], [[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]], [[Zorro]], [[Ishikawa Goemon|Goemon]], [[Pope Joan|Johanna]], [[Necronomicon]], [[Milady de Winter|Milady]], [[Robin Hood]]) were themed after outlaws and picaresque heroes to reflect the function and dominant suppressed passions forming the Palace, and also represent aspects of their owners' personalities.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> Joker's initial Persona was originally the German demon [[Mephistopheles]], but it was changed to Ars\u00e8ne as the latter character better fit the game's themes.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> The cast's alternate Personas ([[Satan]]ael, [[Sun Wukong|Seiten Taisei]], [[Hecate]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]], [[Susano-o|Kamu Susanoo]], [[Anat]], [[Prometheus]], [[Astarte]], [[Loki]]) are taken from mythical beings who act as tricksters or rebels.<ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> The three main inspirations behind Joker's alter ego were [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin]], [[The Fiend with Twenty Faces]], and Japanese outlaw hero Ishikawa Goemon.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> The name of Joker's high school, \"Shujin\", was chosen because it was a [[homonym]] of {{nihongo|''Sh\u016bjin''|\u56da\u4eba}}, the Japanese word for \"prisoner\".<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaB\"/> Following a trend from earlier entries, the Velvet Room assistants are named after characters from the novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]].<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe use of adults as antagonists was a more overt expression of narrative elements previously explored in ''Persona 4''. The relation to police activities was also carried over from ''Persona 4'', but this time with the role of protagonists and antagonists reversed.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\" /> Several writers have highlighted the parallels between the game's various antagonists and real incidents/figures in different sectors of Japanese society (e.g. political, corporate, academic), and how the game's story and characters serve as social commentary on life in Japan.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|title=The Real Japan Behind Persona 5|last=Gay|first=Elliot|date=May 12, 2017|website=Anime News Network|language=en|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630013134/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|archive-date=June 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The game's villains and protagonists were also constructed to be parallels of each other, both groups being misfits trying to shape a world they saw as unsatisfactory or corrupted. This was intended to create moral ambiguity about the Phantom Thieves' actions, causing the player to question their concept of justice and their mission as a whole.<ref name=\"4Gstory\" /> In addition, the way a vocal minority online could draw attention to and shift public opinion on events and scandals in the news was cited as an inspiration for the ambiguous nature of the Phantom Thieves' actions.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\" />\n\n===Art design===\n[[Shigenori Soejima]], who had worked on the last two main-series ''Persona'' games, returned as character designer.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> The game's art director was Masayoshi Suto, whose most notable work on earlier games included the [[user interface]] (UI) displays.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> The art design reflected the picaresque theme aimed for by the rest of the team.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> As the team considered previous ''Persona'' games to be \"fun\" but not well marketed, they designed the UI in such a way as to attract a larger, more mainstream audience.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/> According to Soejima, he was working on prospective designs for the game while ''Persona 4'' was still in development, with his designs evolving as the story for ''Persona 5'' came together.<ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/> Aesthetically, the team felt that they were picking up where ''Persona 4'' left off. Its styling presentation was an unintentional reflection on the hurdles the team needed to overcome during development.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> Following the respective thematic coloring of ''Persona 3'' and ''4''{{'s}} blue and yellow, ''Persona 5'' used red, which was chosen to a harsh feeling.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/><ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Because of this, Suto tested multiple font colors until settling on black and white, as it stood out best against it.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> There was also a wish, especially in the teaser image used for the game's announcement, which represented the main characters' being chained down by the rules of the modern world.<ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Soejima designed the logo to convey the high-speed existences of the young cast, while elements such as Joker's Persona Ars\u00e8ne were designed to appear old-fashioned by comparison. This presented challenges as Soejima needed to balance this with a strong sense of style.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The main aim for the game's environments was to create a sense of realism, with Tokyo being modeled after real locations.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=Persona 5's In-Game Locations Compared To The Real World|url=https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|website=Kotaku|accessdate=January 27, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031184625/https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|archivedate=October 31, 2017}}</ref> When creating the UI, Hashino wanted to demonstrate how a shift in perspective could alter a dull life into an exciting one in the context of the story. Early UI designs were so \"aggressively animated\" that it obscured what was happening in the game. Because of this, the animations were toned down and text orientation was altered, toning down the UI's graphical elements to present a balance between user-friendliness and style.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/> Rather than the use of sub-colors for earlier entries, the UI used only the primary red, black and white colors aside from health and magic point meters, with the menus using a special moving 3D model of Joker which would change position depending on the selected menu.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/>\n\nThe first character sketches were submitted in 2012.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaB\"/> Soejima worked closely with Hashino so the characters and environments reflected the game's themes.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> Due to being high school students, Soejima found it difficult to make each main character's uniform design distinctive, so he expressed their individuality through their thief costumes.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Joker's design was cited by Soejima as his most challenging recent work. Joker needed to both convey a taste of the game's overall art style and to act as an avatar for the player. As the main theme and narrative of ''Persona 5'' revolved around crime and vigilantes triggered by Joker voluntarily choosing that path, Soejima needed to convey this while allowing the character to suit whatever dialogue choices the player decided upon. Due to these difficulties, Joker was given multiple designs in a trial and error process to find the best one. As the \"phantom thief\" premise was a common stereotype in fiction, Soejima initially drew Joker and main cast in a style similar to [[sh\u014dnen manga]], but these designs were scrapped as they clashed with the ''Persona'' series' realistic aesthetics. As with previous entries, Joker was a silent character, so as with previous protagonist Soejima had to work out a way he could communicate without dialogue. His solution was to imagine him as the type of person who made plans but did not share them with others.<ref name=\"FamSoejima\"/> The Persona designs, being based on characters from literature, were intended to evoke both familiarity and surprise from players. Once the names were chosen, Soejima designed the Personas based on that character.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/>\n\nThe game's animated [[cutscene]]s were produced by [[Production I.G]] and Domerica, and were directed and supervised by Toshiyuki Kono.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"Domerica\"/> Kono was contacted three and a half years before the game's completion by Hashino: faced with the project, Kono felt a great deal of pressure in his role. ''Persona 5'' was the first time Production I.G had worked on the series, though many staff at the studio were fans. Despite this, the studio did not change their standard animation process, focusing on characters as they had done for many of their previous projects. The most important part of the cutscenes was getting the character's expressions right, particularly when it came to the general-mute protagonist. The game's animated opening sequence was directed by [[Sayo Yamamoto]].<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/> The concept behind the characters figure skating around the environment was done as a visual symbolization of the game's overall theme, breaking free of an oppressive force, and was similar to her work in ''[[Yuri on Ice]]''.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The scene where Joker first summoned his Persona was requested by Atlus to appear \"wild\", which again was difficult to Joker's purpose as an extension of the player. The blue flame effects related to the Persona were not created with CGI, but hand-drawn by the animators. All the anime cutscenes together were estimated as containing over an hour of footage.<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe game's original score was composed, performed, and produced by series sound director [[Shoji Meguro]].<ref name=\"P5liners\"/> Further contributions, among other general sound design, was handled by Toshiki Konishi, Kenichi Tsuchiya, Atsushi Kitajoh, and Ryota Kozuka; all of them having previously worked on the series as well.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Meguro was given full creative freedom to work on the soundtrack, with around 80% of the tracks used in the game being his, which lasted around three years in total.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Seven tracks were performed in English by Lyn Inaizumi, a [[jazz]] and [[soul music]] singer.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/><ref name=\"LynTwitter\"/> Her first performance in a video game, Inaizumi claimed that the most difficult part of her contributions was performing a rap segment in the opening theme, \"Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There\".<ref name=\"PSCmusic\"/> The lyrics were written by Benjamin Franklin, while the ending song, \"Hoshi To Bokura To\", had lyrics written in Japanese by Shigeo Komori.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/>\n\nTo express the game's mood, Meguro incorporated strong [[acid jazz]] elements into the score.<ref name=\"SilComposer\"/> He also aimed to make the music sound more realistic than previous ''Persona'' games, aiming to match the game's visuals.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Meguro also changed the way the music flowed when compared to the last two ''Persona'' games. Instead of the opening and ending themes being conglomerates of the overall score, he described the entire score as a single continuous work. A recurring musical element he included was described as a \"[[Solmization|do-la]]\" syllable: the opening used \"so la re mi\" on strings as a hook, which then led into the \"do-la\" syllable for other tracks, including the normal battle theme. While he was creating the music, Meguro received positive comments from Hashino when he made early tracks created for an internal demo.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/>\n\nA three-disc soundtrack was released in Japan by Mastard Records on January 17, 2017.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Upon its debut, the album reached fifth on the [[Oricon]] charts with sales of over 29,000.<ref name=\"P5OSToricon\"/> The album featured 110 tracks with commentary from the sound team, while the cover and [[liner note]] artwork were designed by Soejima.<ref name=\"P5AlbumInfo\"/> In addition to the soundtrack, a 19-track disc featuring a selection of the main themes from the game, ''Persona 5: Sounds of the Rebellion'', was released as part of the North American and European collector's edition bundle.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> The complete soundtrack later received a localized English release on [[iTunes]] on April 18, 2017, and on vinyl later that year by [[iam8bit]].<ref name=\"P5ostItunes\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Arif|first1=Shabana|title=Persona 5's complete soundtrack is available to pre-order on vinyl as a 6 LP deluxe edition for $175|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|website=VG24/7|accessdate=January 2, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102141737/https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|archivedate=January 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Sega promotional models and Persona 5 title, Taipei Game Show 20170123.jpg|thumb|Promotion of ''Persona 5'' at the 2017 Taipei Game Show]]\n''Persona 5'' was first announced with a teaser trailer in 2013, alongside spin-off games ''[[Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Persona 4: Dancing All Night]]'', and the [[PlayStation 3]] [[Porting|port]] of ''[[Persona 4 Arena Ultimax]]''.<ref name=\"PolyPersona\" /> The game was originally announced for a late 2014 release exclusively for the PlayStation 3.

Some variants copy the string tails into the buckets. As the buckets grow beyond a predetermined threshold, the buckets are \"burst\" into tries, giving the sort its name. A more recent variant uses a bucket index with smaller sub-buckets to reduce memory usage. Most implementations delegate to multikey quicksort, an extension of three-way radix quicksort, to sort the contents of the buckets. By dividing the input into buckets with common prefixes, the sorting can be done in a cache-efficient manner.\n\nBurstsort was introduced as a sort that is similar to [[Radix sort#Most significant digit radix sorts|MSD radix sort]],<ref name=\"ref1\" /> but is faster due to being aware of caching and related radixes being stored closer to each other due to specifics of trie structure.

They are variants of the traditional [[radix sort]] but faster for large [[data set]]s of common strings, first published in 2003, with some optimizing versions published in later years.<ref name=\"ref1\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Sinha | first1 = R. | last2 = Zobel | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1145/1005813.1041517 | title = Cache-conscious sorting of large sets of strings with dynamic tries | journal = Journal of Experimental Algorithmics| volume = 9 | url = https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/jzobel/fulltext/acmjea04.pdf| pages = 1.5 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = | citeseerx = 10.1.1.599.861 }}</ref>\n\nBurstsort algorithms use a [[trie]] to store prefixes of strings, with [[Dynamic array|growable arrays]] of pointers as end nodes containing sorted, unique, suffixes (referred to as ''buckets''). Some variants copy the string tails into the buckets. As the buckets grow beyond a predetermined threshold, the buckets are \"burst\" into tries, giving the sort its name. A more recent variant uses a bucket index with smaller sub-buckets to reduce memory usage. Most implementations delegate to multikey quicksort, an extension of three-way radix quicksort, to sort the contents of the buckets. By dividing the input into buckets with common prefixes, the sorting can be done in a cache-efficient manner.\n\nBurstsort was introduced as a sort that is similar to [[Radix sort#Most significant digit radix sorts|MSD radix sort]],<ref name=\"ref1\" /> but is faster due to being aware of caching and related radixes being stored closer to each other due to specifics of trie structure. It exploits specifics of strings that are usually encountered in real world. And although asymptotically it is the same as radix sort, with time complexity of {{math|''O''(''wn'')}} (''w'' \u2013 word length and ''n'' \u2013 number of strings to be sorted), but due to better memory distribution it tends to be twice as fast on big data sets of strings.

The song \"Out of Touch\" (the first single) was a #1 pop hit, and charted in several other areas (#24 Hot Black Singles, #8 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] charts and #1 on the dance charts, #48 in the UK).

The song \"Out of Touch\" (the first single) was a #1 pop hit, and charted in several other areas (#24 Hot Black Singles, #8 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] charts and #1 on the dance charts, #48 in the UK). Another song taken from the album, the Daryl Hall and [[Janna Allen]]-penned \"Method of Modern Love\" reached a high point of #5, and \"Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid,\" reached #18.\n\nMusical styles on the album include [[Pop music|pop]], [[Rock music|rock]], and [[dance-rock]], with [[R&B]]/[[Soul music|soul]] influences.

[[Bob Clearmountain]], one of the producers, and, [[Mickey Curry]], the drummer, recorded various drum sounds, manipulating delays and reverbs to create huge dramatic bottom end that is emblematic of this album and the 1980s in general.<ref name=\"Oates2017\"/>\n\nThanks to the new [[polyphonic synthesizer]]s, the duo experimented with new sounds, for example, recording Boy Scout canteens, cardboard boxes, vocals, footsteps in gravel, etc., and combined them with the use of newer and more sophisticated drum machines.<ref name=\"Oates2017\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = ''Big Bam Boom'' {{nobold|\u2013 Standard edition}}<ref name=\"liner\">{{cite AV media notes|title=Big Bam Boom|others=[[Daryl Hall & John Oates]]|date=1984|type=Album liner notes|publisher=[[RCA Records]]|id=PCD1-5336}}</ref>\n| total_length    = 40:13\n| title1          = Dance on Your Knees\n| writer1         = [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]], [[Daryl Hall]]\n| length1         = 1:25\n| title2          = [[Out of Touch]]\n| writer2         = [[Daryl Hall]], [[John Oates]]\n| length2         = 4:21\n| title3          = [[Method of Modern Love]]\n| writer3         = [[Daryl Hall]], [[Janna Allen]]\n| length3         = 5:32\n| title4          = Bank on Your Love\n| writer4         = [[Daryl Hall]], [[John Oates]], [[Sara Allen]]\n| length4         = 4:17\n| title5          = Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid\n| writer5         = [[Daryl Hall]]\n| length5         = 5:27\n| title6          = Going Thru The Motions\n| writer6         = [[Daryl Hall]], [[John Oates]], Sara Allen, Janna Allen\n| length6         = 5:39\n| title7          = Cold Dark and Yesterday\n| writer7         = [[John Oates]]\n| length7         = 4:41\n| title8          = All American Girl\n| writer8         = [[Daryl Hall]], [[John Oates]], Sara Allen\n| length8         = 4:28\n| title9          = Possession Obsession\n| writer9         = [[Daryl Hall]], [[John Oates]], Sara Allen\n| length9         = 4:36\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| total_length    = \n| headline        = ''Big Bam Boom'' {{nobold|\u2013 2004 remastered edition (bonus tracks)}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Big Bam Boom (Remastered) by Daryl Hall & John Oates on Apple Music|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/big-bam-boom-remastered/id217752303|publisher=iTunes Store|accessdate=August 19, 2017|format=}}</ref>\n| collapsed       = yes\n| extra_column    = Producer(s)\n| title10         = Out of Touch\n| note10          = 12\" Version\n| writer10        = \n|length10        = 7:35\n| title11         = Method of Modern Love\n| note11          = 12\" Version\n| writer11        = \n|length11        = 7:48\n| title12         = Possession Obsession\n| note12          = 12\" Version\n| writer12        = \n|length12        = 6:28\n| title13         = Dance on Your Knees\n| note13          = 12\" Version\n| writer13        = \n|length13        = 6:38\n}}\n\n==Promotion==\nIn order to promote the album, the duo embarked the ''Big Bam Boom Tour \u2013 Live Through '85''.<ref name=\"BB84\">{{cite book|title=Billboard \u2013 October 27, 1984|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Billboard-IDX/IDX/80s/1984/BB-1984-10-27-OCR-Page-0058.pdf|work=[[Billboard Magazine]]|publisher=|section=...newsline...|accessdate=August 26, 2017|pages=60}}</ref> It was their last major roadtrip together for a Hall & Oates record;

In Erlewine's opinion, it was a disappointment coming after a trio of albums that had very few flaws.
