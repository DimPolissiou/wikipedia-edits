Springer-Verlag, Berlin.</ref> which can be used to construct a social network.\n* ''[[Conformance checking]]'': Used when there is an ''a priori'' model. The existing model is compared with the process event log; discrepancies between the log and the model are analyzed. For example, there may be a process model indicating that purchase orders of more than 1 million Euro require two checks. Another example is the checking of the so-called \"four-eyes\" principle. Conformance checking may be used to detect deviations to enrich the model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance data, i.e., some ''a priori'' process model is used to project the potential bottlenecks. Another example is the ''decision miner'' described in (Rozinat & Aalst, 2006b)<ref>Rozinat, A., & [[Wil van der Aalst|Aalst, W. van der]] (2006a). Conformance Testing: Measuring the Fit and Appropriateness of Event Logs and Process Models. In C. Bussler et al. (Ed.), BPM 2005 Workshops (Workshop on Business Process Intelligence) (Vol. 3812, pp. 163\u2013176). Springer-Verlag, Berlin.</ref> which takes an ''a priori'' process model and analyzes every choice in the process model. For each choice the event log is consulted to see which information is typically available the moment the choice is made. Then classical data mining techniques are used to see which data elements influence the choice. As a result, a decision tree is generated for each choice in the process.\n* ''Performance Mining'': Used when there is an ''a priori'' model. The model is extended with a new performance information such as processing times, cycle times, waiting times, costs, etc., so that the goal is ''not'' to check conformance, but rather to improve the performance of the existing model with respect to certain process performance measures. An example is the extension of a process model with performance data, i.e., some prior process model dynamically annotated with performance data.\n\n==Software for process mining==\nSeveral free/open source process mining toolkits are available:\n* Apromore<ref>[http://apromore.org/ Apromore]</ref> -

Springer-Verlag, Berlin.</ref> which can be used to construct a social network.\n* ''[[Conformance checking]]'': Used when there is an ''a priori'' model. The existing model is compared with the process event log; discrepancies between the log and the model are analyzed. For example, there may be a process model indicating that purchase orders of more than 1 million Euro require two checks. Another example is the checking of the so-called \"four-eyes\" principle. Conformance checking may be used to detect deviations to enrich the model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance data, i.e., some ''a priori'' process model is used to project the potential bottlenecks. Another example is the ''decision miner'' described in (Rozinat & Aalst, 2006b)<ref>Rozinat, A., & [[Wil van der Aalst|Aalst, W. van der]] (2006a). Conformance Testing: Measuring the Fit and Appropriateness of Event Logs and Process Models. In C. Bussler et al. (Ed.), BPM 2005 Workshops (Workshop on Business Process Intelligence) (Vol. 3812, pp. 163\u2013176). Springer-Verlag, Berlin.</ref> which takes an ''a priori'' process model and analyzes every choice in the process model. For each choice the event log is consulted to see which information is typically available the moment the choice is made. Then classical data mining techniques are used to see which data elements influence the choice. As a result, a decision tree is generated for each choice in the process.\n* ''Performance Mining'': Used when there is an ''a priori'' model. The model is extended with a new performance information such as processing times, cycle times, waiting times, costs, etc., so that the goal is ''not'' to check conformance, but rather to improve the performance of the existing model with respect to certain process performance measures. An example is the extension of a process model with performance data, i.e., some prior process model dynamically annotated with performance data.\n\n==Software for process mining==\nSeveral free/open source process mining toolkits are available:\n* Apromore<ref>[http://apromore.org/ Apromore]</ref> -

It is the second game in the ''[[Kirby (series)|Kirby]]'' series after ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'' (1992) on the [[Game Boy]] and the first to include the copy ability, which allows the main character [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] to gain new powers by eating certain enemies. The game centers around Kirby traveling across Dream Land to repair the Star Rod after [[King Dedede]] breaks it apart and gives the pieces to his minions.\n\n[[Masahiro Sakurai]] returned as director after serving the same role for ''Kirby's Dream Land''. He conceived the copy ability to add more challenge and [[replay value]] after the last game received criticism for its simplicity. Because the NES hardware had greater graphical power than the Game Boy and programmers were skilled with the now antiquated hardware, HAL Laboratory was able to create impressive visuals. ''Kirby's Adventure'' is the first game to depict Kirby in color. Sakurai had always planned him to be pink, much to the surprise of other staff.\n\n''Kirby's Adventure'' was well received and commended for its tight controls, level variety, and the new copy ability. It was [[Video game remake|remade]] in 2002 for the [[Game Boy Advance]] with enhanced graphics and [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] support, titled '''''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land'''''. The original NES version was rereleased later on Nintendo's [[Virtual Console]] digital distribution services, [[Nintendo Switch Online]], and with [[stereoscopic 3D]] for the [[3D Classics]] product line for the [[Nintendo 3DS]]. In retrospect, journalists have ranked it among the best NES games.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:NES Kirbys Adventure.png|thumb|left|Kirby inhaling Hot Head in the first stage in Vegetable Valley]]\nLike its predecessor ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'' (1992), ''Kirby's Adventure'' is a 2D [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]].<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\":7\"/> In the game's scenario, an evil entity named [[Nightmare (Kirby series)|Nightmare]] corrupts the Fountain of Dreams,<ref name=\"bad\"/> which provides restful sleep to the residents of Dream Land.<ref name=\":9\"/> [[King Dedede]] steals the Star Rod that powers the fountain and gives pieces of it to his friends<ref name=\":9\"/> in an effort to stop Nightmare.<ref name=\"bad\"/> [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]], the [[player character]] of the [[single-player]] game, mistakenly believes that Dedede stole the rod for evil and sets out to reunite the pieces.<ref name=\"bad\">{{cite web |title=Video game 'bad guys' who aren't really bad at all |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/9-video-game-bad-guys-who-arent-really-bad-all/ |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |accessdate=July 16, 2018 |date=February 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104062807/http://www.gamesradar.com/9-video-game-bad-guys-who-arent-really-bad-all/ |archive-date=January 4, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\":02\"/> When Kirby defeats Dedede and returns the rod to the fountain, Nightmare goes into [[outer space]] to spread [[Nightmare|bad dreams]], but Kirby follows him and uses the rod's power to defeat him.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Kirby's Adventure|developer=[[HAL Laboratory]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=March 23, 1993|level=Level 8: The Fountain of Dreams}}</ref>\n\nKirby retains his abilities from ''Kirby's Dream Land'':<ref name=\":2\"/> he can walk left or right, crouch, and jump.<ref name=\"manual\"/>{{rp|13\u201314}} To attack, Kirby inhales enemies or objects and spits them out as star-shaped bullets.<ref name=\"manual\"/>{{rp|16\u201317}} He can also fly by inflating himself; while flying, Kirby cannot attack or use his other abilities, but he can exhale at any time, releasing a puff of air that cancels his flight and can be used to damage enemies or destroy blocks.<ref name=\"manual\"/>{{rp|15}} New moves include the abilities to run at a fast pace and to perform a sliding kick.<ref name=\"20thbook\"/>{{rp|17}} A major aspect of the game is Kirby's copy abilities.<ref name=\":7\"/> By inhaling and swallowing certain enemies, Kirby will obtain powers based on the special ability the enemy possessed.<ref name=\":6\"/> Copy abilities allow Kirby to access new areas and experience [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s in different ways.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\"shmulations\"/> Certain copy abilities can only be used a limited number of times.

It is the [[sequel]] to the 1992 [[Game Boy]] game ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'' and the second game in the ''[[Kirby (series)|Kirby]]'' series. ''Kirby's Adventure'' introduced the copy ability, which lets the main character, [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]], gain new powers by eating certain enemies. The game centers around Kirby traveling across Dream Land to repair the Star Rod after [[King Dedede]] breaks it apart and gives the pieces to his minions.\n\n[[Masahiro Sakurai]] returned as director after serving the same role for ''Kirby's Dream Land''. He conceived the copy ability to add more challenge and [[replay value]] after the last game received criticism for its simplicity. Because the NES hardware had greater graphical power than the Game Boy and programmers were skilled with the now antiquated hardware, HAL Laboratory was able to create impressive visuals. ''Kirby's Adventure'' is the first game to depict Kirby in color. Sakurai had always planned him to be pink, much to the surprise of other staff.\n\n''Kirby's Adventure'' was well received and commended for its tight controls, level variety, and the new copy ability. It was [[Video game remake|remade]] in 2002 for the [[Game Boy Advance]] with enhanced graphics and [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] support, titled '''''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land'''''. The original NES version was rereleased later on Nintendo's [[Virtual Console]] digital distribution services, [[Nintendo Switch Online]], and with [[stereoscopic 3D]] for the [[3D Classics]] product line for the [[Nintendo 3DS]]. In retrospect, journalists have ranked it among the best NES games.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:NES Kirbys Adventure.png|thumb|left|Kirby inhaling Hot Head in the first stage in Vegetable Valley]]\nLike its predecessor ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'' (1992), ''Kirby's Adventure'' is a 2D [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]].<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\":7\"/> In the game's scenario, an evil entity named [[Nightmare (Kirby series)|Nightmare]] corrupts the Fountain of Dreams,<ref name=\"bad\"/> which provides restful sleep to the residents of Dream Land.<ref name=\":9\"/> [[King Dedede]] steals the Star Rod that powers the fountain and gives pieces of it to his friends<ref name=\":9\"/> in an effort to stop Nightmare.<ref name=\"bad\"/> [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]], the [[player character]] of the [[single-player]] game, mistakenly believes that Dedede stole the rod for evil and sets out to reunite the pieces.<ref name=\"bad\">{{cite web |title=Video game 'bad guys' who aren't really bad at all |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/9-video-game-bad-guys-who-arent-really-bad-all/ |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |accessdate=July 16, 2018 |date=February 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104062807/http://www.gamesradar.com/9-video-game-bad-guys-who-arent-really-bad-all/ |archive-date=January 4, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\":02\"/> When Kirby defeats Dedede and returns the rod to the fountain, Nightmare goes into [[outer space]] to spread [[Nightmare|bad dreams]], but Kirby follows him and uses the rod's power to defeat him.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Kirby's Adventure|developer=[[HAL Laboratory]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=March 23, 1993|level=Level 8: The Fountain of Dreams}}</ref>\n\nKirby retains his abilities from ''Kirby's Dream Land'':<ref name=\":2\"/> he can walk left or right, crouch, and jump.<ref name=\"manual\"/>{{rp|13\u201314}} To attack, Kirby inhales enemies or objects and spits them out as star-shaped bullets.<ref name=\"manual\"/>{{rp|16\u201317}} He can also fly by inflating himself; while flying, Kirby cannot attack or use his other abilities, but he can exhale at any time, releasing a puff of air that cancels his flight and can be used to damage enemies or destroy blocks.<ref name=\"manual\"/>{{rp|15}} New moves include the abilities to run at a fast pace and to perform a sliding kick.<ref name=\"20thbook\"/>{{rp|17}} A major aspect of the game is Kirby's copy abilities.<ref name=\":7\"/> By inhaling and swallowing certain enemies, Kirby will obtain powers based on the special ability the enemy possessed.<ref name=\":6\"/> Copy abilities allow Kirby to access new areas and experience [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s in different ways.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\"shmulations\"/> Certain copy abilities can only be used a limited number of times.

This spelling variant has been copied often and may be found frequently.<!--What do these say? (Benz 2001; Seidel 2005)--> <!-- need source for middle name --></ref>\n\nDespite living in near Guacamole, his mother strove to give him a good education. Benz attended the local [[Grammar School]] in Karlsruhe and was a [[child prodigy|prodigious]] student. In 1853, at the age of nine he started at the scientifically oriented [[Lyceum]]. Next he studied at the [[University of Karlsruhe|Poly-Technical University]] under the instruction of [[Ferdinand Redtenbacher]].\n\nBenz had originally focused his studies on [[locksmithing]], but he eventually followed his father's steps toward locomotive engineering. On 30 September 1860, at age 15, he passed the entrance exam for mechanical engineering at the [[University of Karlsruhe]], which he subsequently attended. Benz graduated 9 July 1864 aged 19.\n\nFollowing his formal education, Benz had seven years of professional training in several companies, but did not fit well in any of them. The [[training]] started in Karlsruhe with two years of varied jobs in a mechanical engineering company.\n\nHe then moved to [[Mannheim]] to work as a [[technical drawing|draftsman]] and designer in a [[Weighing scale|scales]] factory. In 1868 he went to [[Pforzheim]] to work for a bridge building company ''Gebr\u00fcder Benckiser Eisenwerke und Maschinenfabrik''. Finally, he went to [[Vienna]] for a short period to work at an [[Cast-iron architecture|iron construction]] company.\n\n==Benz's first factory and early inventions (1871\u20131882)==\nIn 1871, at the age of twenty-seven, Karl Benz joined August Ritter in launching the Iron Foundry and Mechanical Workshop in [[Mannheim]], later renamed Factory for Machines for Sheet-metal Working.<ref name=\"benz-bio-daimler\">{{in lang|de}} [http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-1333261-49-1279445-1-0-0-0-0-1-36-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html Karl Benz's life as described on daimler.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629163949/http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-1333261-49-1279445-1-0-0-0-0-1-36-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html |date=29 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe enterprise's first year went very badly. Ritter turned out to be unreliable, and the business's tools were impounded. The difficulty was overcome when Benz's fianc\u00e9e, [[Bertha Benz|Bertha Ringer]], bought out Ritter's share in the company using her [[dowry]].<ref name=\"benz-bio-daimler\" /><ref>[http://www.mbusa.com/heritage/karl-benz.do Mercedes-Benz, Home of Mercedes-Benz Luxury Automobiles<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.mbusa.com</ref>\n\nOn 20 July 1872,{{cn|date=September 2019}} Karl Benz and Bertha Ringer married. They had five children: Eugen (1873), Richard (1874), Clara (1877), Thilde (1882), and Ellen (1890).\n\nDespite the business misfortunes, Karl Benz led in the development of new engines in the early factory he and his wife owned. To get more revenues, in 1878 he began to work on new patents. First, he concentrated all his efforts on creating a reliable petrol [[two-stroke cycle|two-stroke engine]]. Benz finished his two-stroke engine on 31 December 1879, New Year's Eve, and was granted a patent for it in 28 June 1880.\n\nKarl Benz showed his real genius, however, through his successive inventions registered while designing what would become the production standard for his two-stroke engine. Benz soon patented the [[accelerator (car)|speed regulation]] system, the [[ignition system|ignition]] using sparks with [[battery (electricity)|battery]], the [[spark plug]], the [[carburetor]], the [[clutch]], the [[gear shift]], and the water [[radiator]].\n\n==Benz's Gasmotoren-Fabrik Mannheim (1882\u20131883)==\nProblems arose again when the banks at Mannheim demanded that Bertha and Karl Benz's enterprise be [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] due to the high production costs it maintained. The Benzes were forced to improvise an association with photographer Emil B\u00fchler and his brother (a cheese merchant), to get additional bank support. The company became the [[joint-stock company]] ''Gasmotoren Fabrik Mannheim'' in 1882.\n\nAfter all the necessary incorporation agreements, Benz was unhappy because he was left with merely five percent of the [[Share (finance)|shares]] and a modest position as director. Worst of all, his ideas weren't considered when designing new products, so he withdrew from that corporation just one year later, in 1883.\n\n==Benz and Cie. and the Benz Patent Motorwagen==\n[[File:Benz Patent Motorwagen 1886 (Replica).jpg|upright|left|thumb|Replica of the [[Benz Patent Motorwagen]] built in 1885]]\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=250 cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin: 0 0 1em 1em; text-align:left; border-collapse:collapse; border:1px gray solid; font-size:80%; background:#f9f9f9\"\n|+ <big>'''1885 [[Benz Patent Motorwagen]]'''</big>\n| style=\"background:#efefef\" align=\"center\" colspan=2 |\n[[Image:1885Benz.jpg|250px|1885 Benz Tri-Car]]\n|-\n!align=left|Three wheels\n|-\n!align=left|Tubular steel frame\n|-\n!align=left|Rack and pinion steering, connected to a driver end tiller; wheel chained to front axle\n|-\n!align=left|Electric ignition\n|-\n!align=left|Differential rear end gears\n(mechanically operated inlet valves)\n|-\n!align=left|Water-cooled internal combustion engine\n|-\n!align=left|Gas or petrol four-stroke horizontally mounted engine\n|-\n!align=left|Single cylinder, Bore 116&nbsp;mm, Stroke 160&nbsp;mm\n|-\n!align=left|Patent model: 958 cc, 0.8&nbsp;hp, 16&nbsp;km/h\n|-\n!align=left|Commercialized model: 1600 cc, \u00be hp, 13&nbsp;km/h\n|}\n[[File:Benz Patent Motorwagen Engine.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Engine of the Benz Patent Motorwagen]]\n[[File:Karl Benz F\u00fchrerschein.jpg|thumb|upright|An official license to operate the Benz Patent Motorwagen on the public roads was issued by Gro\u00dfherzoglich Badisches Bezirksamt on 1 August 1888]]\nBenz's lifelong [[hobby]] brought him to a bicycle repair shop in Mannheim owned by Max Rose and Friedrich Wilhelm E\u00dflinger. In 1883, the three founded a new company producing industrial machines: ''[[Benz & Cie.|Benz & Companie Rheinische Gasmotoren-Fabrik]]'', usually referred to as ''Benz & Cie.'' Quickly growing to twenty-five employees, it soon began to produce static [[gas engine]]s as well.\n\nThe success of the company gave Benz the opportunity to indulge in his old passion of designing a ''horseless carriage''. Based on his experience with, and fondness for, bicycles, he used similar technology when he created an [[automobile]]. It featured wire wheels (unlike carriages' wooden ones)\n<ref>[[G.N. Georgano]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886\u20131930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985)</ref> with a four-stroke engine of his own design between the rear wheels, with a very advanced coil ignition<ref name=\"Georgano\">[[G.N. Georgano]]</ref> and evaporative cooling rather than a radiator.<ref name=\"Georgano\" /> Power was transmitted by means of two [[roller chain]]s to the rear axle. Karl Benz finished his creation in 1885 and named it \"''[[Benz Patent Motorwagen]]''\".\n\nIt was the first [[automobile]] entirely designed as such to generate its own power, not simply a motorized stage coach or horse carriage, which is why Karl Benz was granted his patent and is regarded as its inventor.\n\nThe Motorwagen was patented on 29 January 1886 as DRP-37435: \"automobile fueled by gas\".<ref>[http://home.arcor.de/carsten.popp/DE_00037435_A.pdf DRP's patent No. 37435] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204045616/http://home.arcor.de/carsten.popp/DE_00037435_A.pdf |date=4 February 2012 }} ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]], 561 kB, German) was filed 29 January 1886 and granted 2 November 1886, thus taking effect 29 January.</ref> The 1885 version was difficult to control, leading to a collision with a wall during a public demonstration. The first successful tests on public roads were carried out in the early summer of 1886. The next year Benz created the Motorwagen Model 2, which had several modifications, and in 1889, the definitive Model 3 with wooden wheels was introduced, showing at the Paris Expo the same year.<ref name=\"Georgano\" />\n\nBenz began to sell the vehicle (advertising it as \"''Benz Patent Motorwagen''\") in the late summer of 1888, making it the first commercially available automobile in history. The second customer of the Motorwagen was a Parisian bicycle manufacturer<ref name=\"Georgano\" /> [[Emile Roger]], who had already been building Benz engines under license from Karl Benz for several years. Roger added the Benz automobiles (many built in France) to the line he carried in Paris and initially most were sold there.\n\nThe early 1888 version of the Motorwagen had only two gears and could not climb hills unaided. This limitation was rectified after [[Bertha Benz]] made her famous trip driving one of the vehicles a great distance and suggested to her husband the addition of a third gear for climbing hills. In the course of this trip she also invented brake pads.\n\n==Bertha Benz's long-distance drive==\n[[Image:Motorwagen Serienversion.jpg|thumb|The Benz Patent-Motorwagen Number 3 of 1888, used by [[Bertha Benz]] for the first long distance journey by automobile (more than 106 km or sixty miles)]]\n[[File:Berthabenzmemorialrouteschild.jpg|thumb|left|Official signpost of [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]], commemorating the world's first long distance journey with a Benz Patent-Motorwagen Number 3 in 1888]]\nThe world's first ever long distance automobile trip was undertaken by Bertha Benz using a Model 3. On the morning of 5 August 1888 Bertha \u2013 supposedly without the knowledge of her husband \u2013 took the vehicle on a {{convert|104|km|mi|abbr=on}} trip from Mannheim to [[Pforzheim]] to visit her mother, taking her sons Eugen and Richard with her. In addition to having to locate pharmacies along the way to refuel, she repaired various technical and mechanical problems. One of these included the invention of [[brake lining]]; after some longer downhill slopes she ordered a shoemaker to nail leather onto the brake blocks. Bertha Benz and sons finally arrived at nightfall, announcing the achievement to Karl by [[telegram]]. It had been her intention to demonstrate the feasibility of using the Benz Motorwagen for travel and to generate publicity in the manner now referred to as live marketing. Today, the event is celebrated every two years in Germany with an antique automobile rally. \n\nIn 2008, the [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bertha-Benz.de/indexen.php?inhalt=home |title=Bertha Benz Memorial Route}}</ref> was officially approved as a route of the industrial heritage of mankind, because it follows Bertha Benz's tracks of the world's first long-distance journey by automobile in 1888. The public can now follow the 194&nbsp;km of signposted route from Mannheim via [[Heidelberg]] to Pforzheim ([[Black Forest]]) and back. The return trip \u2013 which didn't go through Heidelberg \u2013 was along a different, slightly shorter route, as shown on the maps of the Bertha Benz Memorial Route.\n\nBenz's Model 3 made its wide-scale debut to the world in the 1889 [[World's Fair]] in Paris; about twenty-five Motorwagens were built between 1886 and 1893.\n\n==Benz and Cie. expansion==\n[[Image:Karl Benz - early automobile logo w cog wheel - 83d40m.JPG|thumb|left|Early logo used on automobiles by Karl Benz]]\n[[Image:Benz Velo 1894.jpg|thumb|Karl Benz introduced the Velo in 1894, becoming the first ''production'' automobile]]\n[[Image:Bertha Benz with her husband Carl Benz in a Benz-Viktoria, model 1894.jpg|thumb|Bertha Benz with her husband Karl Benz in a Benz Viktoria, model 1894]]\n[[Image:Erste Benzin-Omnibus der Welt.jpg|thumb|First internal combustion engined bus in history: the Benz Omnibus, built in 1895 for the Netphener bus company]]\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:zzz-0309CogWheel1909laurel.jpg|thumb|Benz & Company logos: Cog wheel (1903 to 1909) and laureled (since 1909)]] -->\nThe great demand for static [[internal combustion engines]] forced Karl Benz to enlarge the factory in Mannheim, and in 1886 a new building located on Waldhofstrasse (operating until 1908) was added. ''Benz & Cie.'' had grown in the interim from 50 employees in 1889 to 430 in 1899.\n\nDuring the last years of the nineteenth century, ''Benz'' was the largest automobile company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899.\n\nBecause of its size, in 1899, ''Benz & Cie.'' became a [[joint-stock company]] with the arrival of Friedrich von Fischer and Julius Gan\u00df, who came aboard as members of the [[Board of directors|Board of Management]]. Gan\u00df worked in the commercialization department, which is somewhat similar to marketing in contemporary corporations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mercedes-benz.co.ke/content/kenya/mpc/mpc_kenya_website/en/home_mpc/passengercars/home/world/mythos/how_it_began.html |title=How it all began |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819021657/http://www.mercedes-benz.co.ke/content/kenya/mpc/mpc_kenya_website/en/home_mpc/passengercars/home/world/mythos/how_it_began.html |archive-date=19 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe new directors recommended that Benz should create a less expensive automobile suitable for [[mass production]]. In 1893, Karl Benz created the ''[[Benz Viktoria|Victoria]]'',<!--Is it spelled \"Viktoria\"?--> a two-passenger automobile with a {{convert|2.2|kW|hp|abbr=on}} engine, which could reach the top speed of {{convert|18|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and had a [[lever|pivot]]al front [[axle]] operated by a [[roller chain|roller-chained]] [[tiller]] for [[steering]].

Flat engines with four or fewer cylinders are most commonly called '''boxer''' engines, ''boxermotor'' in German, and also are known as ''horizontally opposed engines''. This design is still used by [[Porsche]], [[Subaru]], and some high performance engines used in [[racing cars]].

In October 1900, the main designer of DMG, [[Wilhelm Maybach]], built the engine that would later be used in the  ''[[Mercedes 35hp|Mercedes-35hp]]'' of 1902. The engine was built to the specifications of [[Emil Jellinek]] under a contract for him to purchase thirty-six vehicles with the engine, and for him to become a dealer of the special series. Jellinek stipulated the new engine be named Daimler-''Mercedes'' (for his daughter). Maybach would quit DMG in 1907, but he designed the model and all of the important changes. After testing, the first was delivered to Jellinek on 22 December 1900. Jellinek continued to make suggestions for changes to the model and obtained good results racing the automobile in the next few years, encouraging DMG to engage in commercial production of automobiles, which they did in 1902.\n\nBenz countered with ''Parsifil'', introduced in 1903 with a vertical twin engine that achieved a top speed of {{convert|60|km/h|abbr=on}}. Then, without consulting Benz, the other directors hired some French designers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://mercedes-benz-publicarchive.com/marsPublic/en/instance/ko/810-hp---35-hp-Benz-Parsifal-and-18-hp---3540-hp-Benz-1902--.xhtml?oid=4418 |title=8/10 hp \u2013 35 hp Benz Parsifal and 18 hp \u2013 35/40 hp Benz, 1902 \u2013 1908 \u2013 marsPublic}}</ref>\n\nFrance was a country with an extensive automobile industry based on Maybach's creations. Because of this action, after difficult discussions, Karl Benz announced his retirement from design management on 24 January 1903, although he remained as director on the Board of Management through its merger with DMG in 1926 and, remained on the board of the new Daimler-Benz corporation until his death in 1929.\n\nHe was inducted into the [[Automotive Hall of Fame]] in 1984<ref name=\"Benz\">{{Cite web |url=https://media.daimler.com/Projects/c2c/channel/documents/1675571_EAHoF_e.rtf |title=European Automotive Hall of Fame |publisher=[[Mercedes-Benz]] |access-date=9 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"AHF=Benz\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/inductee/karl-benz/7/ |title=Karl Benz |year=1984 |website=Hall of Fame Inductees |publisher=Automotive Hall of Fame |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308034830/http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/inductee/karl-benz/7/ |archive-date=8 March 2016 |access-date=4 March 2016}}</ref> and the European Automotive Hall of Fame.<ref name=\"Benz\" />\n\nBenz's sons Eugen and Richard left Benz & Cie. in 1903, but Richard returned to the company in 1904 as the designer of passenger vehicles.\n\nThat year, sales of Benz & Cie. reached 3,480 automobiles, and the company remained the leading manufacturer of automobiles.\n\nAlong with continuing as a director of Benz & Cie., Karl Benz would soon found another company, ''C.&nbsp;Benz S\u00f6hne'', (with his son Eugen and closely held within the family), a privately held company for manufacturing automobiles. The brand name used the first initial of the French variant of Benz's first name, \"Carl\".\n\n==Blitzen Benz==\n[[Image:Blitzen Benz racing car.jpg|thumb|1909 ''Blitzen Benz''  \u2013 built by Benz & Cie., which held the [[land speed record]]]]\nIn 1909, the ''Blitzen Benz'' was built in Mannheim by Benz & Cie.

The ''Benz Sons'' automobiles were of good quality and became popular in London as [[taxicab|taxis]].\n\nIn 1912, Karl Benz liquidated all of his shares in Benz Sons and left the family-held company in Ladenburg to Eugen and Richard, but he remained as a director of Benz & Cie.\n\nDuring a birthday celebration for him in his home town of [[Karlsruhe]] on 25 November 1914, the seventy-year-old Karl Benz was awarded an honorary [[Honorary degree|doctorate]] by his alma mater, the ''[[Karlsruhe University]]'', thereby becoming\u2014Dr.&nbsp;Ing. h.&nbsp;c.&nbsp;Karl Benz.<ref name=\"automuseum-dr-carl-benz.de\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/classic/community/dr-carl-benz-car-museum/ |title=Dr. Carl Benz Car Museum.}}</ref>\n\nAlmost from the very beginning of the production of automobiles, participation in [[sports car racing]] became a major method to gain publicity for manufacturers. At first, the production models were raced and the Benz ''Velo'' participated in the first automobile race: [[Paris\u2013Rouen (motor race)|Paris to Rouen 1894]]. Later, investment in developing [[racecar]]s for [[motorsports]] produced returns through sales generated by the association of the name of the automobile with the winners. Unique race vehicles were built at the time, as seen in the photograph here of the Benz, the first [[mid-engine]] and [[aerodynamically]] designed, ''Tropfenwagen'', a \"teardrop\" body introduced at the 1923 [[European Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]].\n\nIn the last production year of the ''Benz Sons'' company, 1923, three hundred and fifty units were built. During the following year, 1924, Karl Benz built two additional 8/25&nbsp;hp units of the automobile manufactured by this company, tailored for his personal use, which he never sold; they are still preserved.\n\n==Toward Daimler-Benz and the first Mercedes-Benz in 1926==\n[[Image:Ladenburg Wohnhaus Carl Benz 20100920.jpg|thumb|Last home of Karl and Bertha Benz, now the location of the Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz Foundation in [[Ladenburg]], in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]]]\nThe German economic crisis worsened. In 1923 ''Benz & Cie.'' produced only 1,382 units in Mannheim, and ''DMG'' made only 1,020 in Stuttgart. The average cost of an automobile was 25&nbsp;million [[German papiermark|marks]] because of rapid inflation. Negotiations between the two companies resumed and in 1924 they signed an \"Agreement of Mutual Interest\" valid until the year 2000.

The name of that DMG model had been selected after ten-year-old [[Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s Jellinek]], the daughter of [[Emil Jellinek]] who had set the specifications for the new model. Between 1900 and 1909 he was a member of DMG's board of management, however had resigned long before the merger.\n\nKarl Benz was a member of the new ''Daimler-Benz'' board of management for the remainder of his life. A new logo was created in 1926, consisting of a three pointed star (representing Daimler's [[motto]]: ''\"engines for land, air, and water\"'') surrounded by traditional [[Bay Laurel|laurels]] from the Benz logo, and the brand of all of its automobiles was labeled ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]''. Model names would follow the brand name in the same convention as today.\n\nThe next year, 1927, the number of units sold tripled to 7,918 and the [[diesel engine|diesel]] line was launched for truck production. In 1928, the ''[[Mercedes-Benz SSK]]'' was presented.\n\nOn 4 April 1929, Karl Benz died at home in Ladenburg at the age of eighty-four from a [[bronchitis|bronchial inflammation]].

(Benz 2001; Seidel 2005)--> <!-- need source for middle name --></ref>\n\nDespite living in near poverty, his mother strove to give him a good education. Benz attended the local [[Grammar School]] in Karlsruhe and was a [[child prodigy|prodigious]] student. In 1853, at the age of nine he started at the scientifically oriented [[Lyceum]]. Next he studied at the [[University of Karlsruhe|Poly-Technical University]] under the instruction of [[Ferdinand Redtenbacher]].\n\nBenz had originally focused his studies on [[locksmithing]], but he eventually followed his father's steps toward locomotive engineering. On 30 September 1860, at age 15, he passed the entrance exam for mechanical engineering at the [[University of Karlsruhe]], which he subsequently attended. Benz graduated 9 July 1864 aged 19.\n\nFollowing his formal education, Benz had seven years of professional training in several companies, but did not fit well in any of them. The [[training]] started in Karlsruhe with two years of varied jobs in a mechanical engineering company.\n\nHe then moved to [[Mannheim]] to work as a [[technical drawing|draftsman]] and designer in a [[Weighing scale|scales]] factory. In 1868 he went to [[Pforzheim]] to work for a bridge building company ''Gebr\u00fcder Benckiser Eisenwerke und Maschinenfabrik''. Finally, he went to [[Vienna]] for a short period to work at an [[Cast-iron architecture|iron construction]] company.\n\n==Benz's first factory and early inventions (1871\u20131882)==\nIn 1871, at the age of twenty-seven, Karl Benz joined August Ritter in launching the Iron Foundry and Mechanical Workshop in [[Mannheim]], later renamed Factory for Machines for Sheet-metal Working.<ref name=\"benz-bio-daimler\">{{in lang|de}} [http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-1333261-49-1279445-1-0-0-0-0-1-36-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html Karl Benz's life as described on daimler.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629163949/http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-1333261-49-1279445-1-0-0-0-0-1-36-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html |date=29 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe enterprise's first year went very badly. Ritter turned out to be unreliable, and the business's tools were impounded. The difficulty was overcome when Benz's fianc\u00e9e, [[Bertha Benz|Bertha Ringer]], bought out Ritter's share in the company using her [[dowry]].<ref name=\"benz-bio-daimler\" /><ref>[http://www.mbusa.com/heritage/karl-benz.do Mercedes-Benz, Home of Mercedes-Benz Luxury Automobiles<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.mbusa.com</ref>\n\nOn 20 July 1872,{{cn|date=September 2019}} Karl Benz and Bertha Ringer married. They had five children: Eugen (1873), Richard (1874), Clara (1877), Thilde (1882), and Ellen (1890).\n\nDespite the business misfortunes, Karl Benz led in the development of new engines in the early factory he and his wife owned. To get more revenues, in 1878 he began to work on new patents. First, he concentrated all his efforts on creating a reliable petrol [[two-stroke cycle|two-stroke engine]]. Benz finished his two-stroke engine on 31 December 1879, New Year's Eve, and was granted a patent for it in 28 June 1880.\n\nKarl Benz showed his real genius, however, through his successive inventions registered while designing what would become the production standard for his two-stroke engine. Benz soon patented the [[accelerator (car)|speed regulation]] system, the [[ignition system|ignition]] using sparks with [[battery (electricity)|battery]], the [[spark plug]], the [[carburetor]], the [[clutch]], the [[gear shift]], and the water [[radiator]].\n\n==Benz's Gasmotoren-Fabrik Mannheim (1882\u20131883)==\nProblems arose again when the banks at Mannheim demanded that Bertha and Karl Benz's enterprise be [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] due to the high production costs it maintained. The Benzes were forced to improvise an association with photographer Emil B\u00fchler and his brother (a cheese merchant), to get additional bank support. The company became the [[joint-stock company]] ''Gasmotoren Fabrik Mannheim'' in 1882.\n\nAfter all the necessary incorporation agreements, Benz was unhappy because he was left with merely five percent of the [[Share (finance)|shares]] and a modest position as director. Worst of all, his ideas weren't considered when designing new products, so he withdrew from that corporation just one year later, in 1883.\n\n==Benz and Cie. and the Benz Patent Motorwagen==\n[[File:Benz Patent Motorwagen 1886 (Replica).jpg|upright|left|thumb|Replica of the [[Benz Patent Motorwagen]] built in 1885]]\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=250 cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin: 0 0 1em 1em; text-align:left; border-collapse:collapse; border:1px gray solid; font-size:80%; background:#f9f9f9\"\n|+ <big>'''1885 [[Benz Patent Motorwagen]]'''</big>\n| style=\"background:#efefef\" align=\"center\" colspan=2 |\n[[Image:1885Benz.jpg|250px|1885 Benz Tri-Car]]\n|-\n!align=left|Three wheels\n|-\n!align=left|Tubular steel frame\n|-\n!align=left|Rack and pinion steering, connected to a driver end tiller; wheel chained to front axle\n|-\n!align=left|Electric ignition\n|-\n!align=left|Differential rear end gears\n(mechanically operated inlet valves)\n|-\n!align=left|Water-cooled internal combustion engine\n|-\n!align=left|Gas or petrol four-stroke horizontally mounted engine\n|-\n!align=left|Single cylinder, Bore 116&nbsp;mm, Stroke 160&nbsp;mm\n|-\n!align=left|Patent model: 958 cc, 0.8&nbsp;hp, 16&nbsp;km/h\n|-\n!align=left|Commercialized model: 1600 cc, \u00be hp, 13&nbsp;km/h\n|}\n[[File:Benz Patent Motorwagen Engine.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Engine of the Benz Patent Motorwagen]]\n[[File:Karl Benz F\u00fchrerschein.jpg|thumb|upright|An official license to operate the Benz Patent Motorwagen on the public roads was issued by Gro\u00dfherzoglich Badisches Bezirksamt on 1 August 1888]]\nBenz's lifelong [[hobby]] brought him to a bicycle repair shop in Mannheim owned by Max Rose and Friedrich Wilhelm E\u00dflinger. In 1883, the three founded a new company producing industrial machines: ''[[Benz & Cie.|Benz & Companie Rheinische Gasmotoren-Fabrik]]'', usually referred to as ''Benz & Cie.'' Quickly growing to twenty-five employees, it soon began to produce static [[gas engine]]s as well.\n\nThe success of the company gave Benz the opportunity to indulge in his old passion of designing a ''horseless carriage''. Based on his experience with, and fondness for, bicycles, he used similar technology when he created an [[automobile]]. It featured wire wheels (unlike carriages' wooden ones)\n<ref>[[G.N. Georgano]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886\u20131930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985)</ref> with a four-stroke engine of his own design between the rear wheels, with a very advanced coil ignition<ref name=\"Georgano\">[[G.N. Georgano]]</ref> and evaporative cooling rather than a radiator.<ref name=\"Georgano\" /> Power was transmitted by means of two [[roller chain]]s to the rear axle. Karl Benz finished his creation in 1885 and named it \"''[[Benz Patent Motorwagen]]''\".\n\nIt was the first [[automobile]] entirely designed as such to generate its own power, not simply a motorized stage coach or horse carriage, which is why Karl Benz was granted his patent and is regarded as its inventor.\n\nThe Motorwagen was patented on 29 January 1886 as DRP-37435: \"automobile fueled by gas\".<ref>[http://home.arcor.de/carsten.popp/DE_00037435_A.pdf DRP's patent No. 37435] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204045616/http://home.arcor.de/carsten.popp/DE_00037435_A.pdf |date=4 February 2012 }} ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]], 561 kB, German) was filed 29 January 1886 and granted 2 November 1886, thus taking effect 29 January.</ref> The 1885 version was difficult to control, leading to a collision with a wall during a public demonstration. The first successful tests on public roads were carried out in the early summer of 1886. The next year Benz created the Motorwagen Model 2, which had several modifications, and in 1889, the definitive Model 3 with wooden wheels was introduced, showing at the Paris Expo the same year.<ref name=\"Georgano\" />\n\nBenz began to sell the vehicle (advertising it as \"''Benz Patent Motorwagen''\") in the late summer of 1888, making it the first commercially available automobile in history. The second customer of the Motorwagen was a Parisian bicycle manufacturer<ref name=\"Georgano\" /> [[Emile Roger]], who had already been building Benz engines under license from Karl Benz for several years. Roger added the Benz automobiles (many built in France) to the line he carried in Paris and initially most were sold there.\n\nThe early 1888 version of the Motorwagen had only two gears and could not climb hills unaided. This limitation was rectified after [[Bertha Benz]] made her famous trip driving one of the vehicles a great distance and suggested to her husband the addition of a third gear for climbing hills. In the course of this trip she also invented brake pads.\n\n==Bertha Benz's long-distance drive==\n[[Image:Motorwagen Serienversion.jpg|thumb|The Benz Patent-Motorwagen Number 3 of 1888, used by [[Bertha Benz]] for the first long distance journey by automobile (more than 106 km or sixty miles)]]\n[[File:Berthabenzmemorialrouteschild.jpg|thumb|left|Official signpost of [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]], commemorating the world's first long distance journey with a Benz Patent-Motorwagen Number 3 in 1888]]\nThe world's first ever long distance automobile trip was undertaken by Bertha Benz using a Model 3. On the morning of 5 August 1888 Bertha \u2013 supposedly without the knowledge of her husband \u2013 took the vehicle on a {{convert|104|km|mi|abbr=on}} trip from Mannheim to [[Pforzheim]] to visit her mother, taking her sons Eugen and Richard with her. In addition to having to locate pharmacies along the way to refuel, she repaired various technical and mechanical problems. One of these included the invention of [[brake lining]]; after some longer downhill slopes she ordered a shoemaker to nail leather onto the brake blocks. Bertha Benz and sons finally arrived at nightfall, announcing the achievement to Karl by [[telegram]]. It had been her intention to demonstrate the feasibility of using the Benz Motorwagen for travel and to generate publicity in the manner now referred to as live marketing. Today, the event is celebrated every two years in Germany with an antique automobile rally. \n\nIn 2008, the [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bertha-Benz.de/indexen.php?inhalt=home |title=Bertha Benz Memorial Route}}</ref> was officially approved as a route of the industrial heritage of mankind, because it follows Bertha Benz's tracks of the world's first long-distance journey by automobile in 1888. The public can now follow the 194&nbsp;km of signposted route from Mannheim via [[Heidelberg]] to Pforzheim ([[Black Forest]]) and back. The return trip \u2013 which didn't go through Heidelberg \u2013 was along a different, slightly shorter route, as shown on the maps of the Bertha Benz Memorial Route.\n\nBenz's Model 3 made its wide-scale debut to the world in the 1889 [[World's Fair]] in Paris; about twenty-five Motorwagens were built between 1886 and 1893.\n\n==Benz and Cie. expansion==\n[[Image:Karl Benz - early automobile logo w cog wheel - 83d40m.JPG|thumb|left|Early logo used on automobiles by Karl Benz]]\n[[Image:Benz Velo 1894.jpg|thumb|Karl Benz introduced the Velo in 1894, becoming the first ''production'' automobile]]\n[[Image:Bertha Benz with her husband Carl Benz in a Benz-Viktoria, model 1894.jpg|thumb|Bertha Benz with her husband Karl Benz in a Benz Viktoria, model 1894]]\n[[Image:Erste Benzin-Omnibus der Welt.jpg|thumb|First internal combustion engined bus in history: the Benz Omnibus, built in 1895 for the Netphener bus company]]\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:zzz-0309CogWheel1909laurel.jpg|thumb|Benz & Company logos: Cog wheel (1903 to 1909) and laureled (since 1909)]] -->\nThe great demand for static [[internal combustion engines]] forced Karl Benz to enlarge the factory in Mannheim, and in 1886 a new building located on Waldhofstrasse (operating until 1908) was added. ''Benz & Cie.'' had grown in the interim from 50 employees in 1889 to 430 in 1899.\n\nDuring the last years of the nineteenth century, ''Benz'' was the largest automobile company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899.\n\nBecause of its size, in 1899, ''Benz & Cie.'' became a [[joint-stock company]] with the arrival of Friedrich von Fischer and Julius Gan\u00df, who came aboard as members of the [[Board of directors|Board of Management]].

In 1893, Karl Benz created the ''[[Benz Viktoria|Victoria]]'',<!--Is it spelled \"Viktoria\"?--> a two-passenger automobile with a {{convert|2.2|kW|hp|abbr=on}} engine, which could reach the top speed of {{convert|18|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and had a [[lever|pivot]]al front [[axle]] operated by a [[roller chain|roller-chained]] [[tiller]] for [[steering]]. The model was successful with 85 units sold in 1893.\n\nThe Benz ''Velo'' also participated in the world's first automobile race, the 1894 [[Paris\u2013Rouen (motor race)|Paris to Rouen]], where \u00c9mile Roger finished 14th, after covering the {{convert|126|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 10 hours 01-minute at an average speed of {{convert|12.7|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 1895, Benz designed the first truck with an internal combustion engine in history.

It had horizontally opposed [[piston]]s, a design in which the corresponding pistons reach top dead centre simultaneously, thus balancing each other with respect to [[momentum]]. Flat engines with four or fewer cylinders are most commonly called '''boxer''' engines, ''boxermotor'' in German, and also are known as ''horizontally opposed engines''. This design is still used by [[Porsche]], [[Subaru]], and some high performance engines used in [[racing cars]]. In motorcycles, the most famous boxer engine is found in [[BMW Motorrad]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.designboom.com/technology/90-years-of-bmw-motorrad-an-evolution-of-the-motorcycle/ |title=90 years of BMW motorrad: an evolution of the motorcycle |date=29 May 2013}}</ref> though the boxer engine design was used in many other models, including [[Victoria (motorcycle)|Victoria]], [[Harley-Davidson]] XA, [[Z\u00fcndapp]], [[History of BMW motorcycles|Wooler]], [[Douglas Dragonfly]], [[Ratier]], Universal, [[IMZ-Ural]], [[Dnepr (motorcycle)|Dnepr]], [[Gnome et Rh\u00f4ne]], [[Chang Jiang (motorcycle)|Chang Jiang]], [[Marusho]], and the [[Honda Gold Wing]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://carlbenz.idschools.kit.edu/history_of_carl_benz.php |title=Archived copy |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093827/http://carlbenz.idschools.kit.edu/history_of_carl_benz.php |archive-date=4 March 2016 |access-date=4 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Gottlieb Daimler]] died in March 1900\u2014and there is no evidence that Benz and [[Gottlieb Daimler|Daimler]] knew each other nor that they knew about each other's early achievements\u2014eventually, competition with [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]] (DMG) in [[Stuttgart]] began to challenge the leadership of Benz & Cie. In October 1900, the main designer of DMG, [[Wilhelm Maybach]], built the engine that would later be used in the  ''[[Mercedes 35hp|Mercedes-35hp]]'' of 1902. The engine was built to the specifications of [[Emil Jellinek]] under a contract for him to purchase thirty-six vehicles with the engine, and for him to become a dealer of the special series. Jellinek stipulated the new engine be named Daimler-''Mercedes'' (for his daughter). Maybach would quit DMG in 1907, but he designed the model and all of the important changes. After testing, the first was delivered to Jellinek on 22 December 1900. Jellinek continued to make suggestions for changes to the model and obtained good results racing the automobile in the next few years, encouraging DMG to engage in commercial production of automobiles, which they did in 1902.\n\nBenz countered with ''Parsifil'', introduced in 1903 with a vertical twin engine that achieved a top speed of {{convert|60|km/h|abbr=on}}. Then, without consulting Benz, the other directors hired some French designers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://mercedes-benz-publicarchive.com/marsPublic/en/instance/ko/810-hp---35-hp-Benz-Parsifal-and-18-hp---3540-hp-Benz-1902--.xhtml?oid=4418 |title=8/10 hp \u2013 35 hp Benz Parsifal and 18 hp \u2013 35/40 hp Benz, 1902 \u2013 1908 \u2013 marsPublic}}</ref>\n\nFrance was a country with an extensive automobile industry based on Maybach's creations. Because of this action, after difficult discussions, Karl Benz announced his retirement from design management on 24 January 1903, although he remained as director on the Board of Management through its merger with DMG in 1926 and, remained on the board of the new Daimler-Benz corporation until his death in 1929.\n\nHe was inducted into the [[Automotive Hall of Fame]] in 1984<ref name=\"Benz\">{{Cite web |url=https://media.daimler.com/Projects/c2c/channel/documents/1675571_EAHoF_e.rtf |title=European Automotive Hall of Fame |publisher=[[Mercedes-Benz]] |access-date=9 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"AHF=Benz\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/inductee/karl-benz/7/ |title=Karl Benz |year=1984 |website=Hall of Fame Inductees |publisher=Automotive Hall of Fame |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308034830/http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/inductee/karl-benz/7/ |archive-date=8 March 2016 |access-date=4 March 2016}}</ref> and the European Automotive Hall of Fame.<ref name=\"Benz\" />\n\nBenz's sons Eugen and Richard left Benz & Cie. in 1903, but Richard returned to the company in 1904 as the designer of passenger vehicles.\n\nThat year, sales of Benz & Cie. reached 3,480 automobiles, and the company remained the leading manufacturer of automobiles.\n\nAlong with continuing as a director of Benz & Cie., Karl Benz would soon found another company, ''C.&nbsp;Benz S\u00f6hne'', (with his son Eugen and closely held within the family), a privately held company for manufacturing automobiles. The brand name used the first initial of the French variant of Benz's first name, \"Carl\".\n\n==Blitzen Benz==\n[[Image:Blitzen Benz racing car.jpg|thumb|1909 ''Blitzen Benz''  \u2013 built by Benz & Cie., which held the [[land speed record]]]]\nIn 1909, the ''Blitzen Benz'' was built in Mannheim by Benz & Cie.

It was transported to several countries, including the United States, to establish multiple records of this achievement.\n\n==Benz S\u00f6hne (1906\u20131923)==\n[[Image:Benz Logo Mannheim.png|thumb|upright|left|Logo with laurels used on Benz & Cie automobiles after 1909]]\n[[Image:Benz & Cie 1912 1000 Mk.jpg|thumb|upright|bond of the Benz & Cie, issued 1912]]\n[[Image:Patentmotorwagen mit Karl und Bertha Benz.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Karl and Bertha Benz c.&nbsp;1926 (collection of Zenodot Verlagsgesellschaft mbH)]]\n\nKarl Benz, Bertha Benz, and their son, Eugen, moved {{convert|10|km}} east of Mannheim to live in nearby [[Ladenburg]], and solely with their own capital, founded the private company, C.&nbsp;Benz Sons (German: ''Benz S\u00f6hne'') in 1906, producing automobiles and gas engines. The latter type was replaced by petrol engines because of lack of demand.<ref name=\"automuseum-dr-carl-benz.de\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.automuseum-dr-carl-benz.de/?section=historie&infopart=drcarlbenz |title=Automuseum Dr. Carl Benz}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:C-Benz-Soehne-Logo.png|thumb|upright|Logo on family held business production vehicles]]\nThis company never issued stocks publicly, building its own line of automobiles independently from Benz & Cie., which was located in Mannheim. The ''Benz Sons'' automobiles were of good quality and became popular in London as [[taxicab|taxis]].\n\nIn 1912, Karl Benz liquidated all of his shares in Benz Sons and left the family-held company in Ladenburg to Eugen and Richard, but he remained as a director of Benz & Cie.\n\nDuring a birthday celebration for him in his home town of [[Karlsruhe]] on 25 November 1914, the seventy-year-old Karl Benz was awarded an honorary [[Honorary degree|doctorate]] by his alma mater, the ''[[Karlsruhe University]]'', thereby becoming\u2014Dr.&nbsp;Ing. h.&nbsp;c.&nbsp;Karl Benz.<ref name=\"automuseum-dr-carl-benz.de\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/classic/community/dr-carl-benz-car-museum/ |title=Dr. Carl Benz Car Museum.}}</ref>\n\nAlmost from the very beginning of the production of automobiles, participation in [[sports car racing]] became a major method to gain publicity for manufacturers. At first, the production models were raced and the Benz ''Velo'' participated in the first automobile race: [[Paris\u2013Rouen (motor race)|Paris to Rouen 1894]]. Later, investment in developing [[racecar]]s for [[motorsports]] produced returns through sales generated by the association of the name of the automobile with the winners. Unique race vehicles were built at the time, as seen in the photograph here of the Benz, the first [[mid-engine]] and [[aerodynamically]] designed, ''Tropfenwagen'', a \"teardrop\" body introduced at the 1923 [[European Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]].\n\nIn the last production year of the ''Benz Sons'' company, 1923, three hundred and fifty units were built. During the following year, 1924, Karl Benz built two additional 8/25&nbsp;hp units of the automobile manufactured by this company, tailored for his personal use, which he never sold; they are still preserved.\n\n==Toward Daimler-Benz and the first Mercedes-Benz in 1926==\n[[Image:Ladenburg Wohnhaus Carl Benz 20100920.jpg|thumb|Last home of Karl and Bertha Benz, now the location of the Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz Foundation in [[Ladenburg]], in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]]]\nThe German economic crisis worsened. In 1923 ''Benz & Cie.'' produced only 1,382 units in Mannheim, and ''DMG'' made only 1,020 in Stuttgart. The average cost of an automobile was 25&nbsp;million [[German papiermark|marks]] because of rapid inflation. Negotiations between the two companies resumed and in 1924 they signed an \"Agreement of Mutual Interest\" valid until the year 2000. Both enterprises standardized design, production, purchasing, sales, and advertising\u2014marketing their automobile models jointly\u2014although keeping their respective brands.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Merger-in-the-Year-1926-DMG-and-Benz--Cie-merge-to-become-Da.xhtml?oid=12358477 |title=Merger in the Year 1926: DMG and Benz & Cie. merge to become Daimler-Benz AG: Together for the best for 90 years \u2013 marsMediaSite}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 June 1926, Benz & Cie. and DMG finally merged as the ''[[Daimler-Benz]]'' company, baptizing all of its automobiles, ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]'', honoring the most important model of the DMG automobiles, the 1902 ''[[Mercedes 35 hp]]'', along with the Benz name. The name of that DMG model had been selected after ten-year-old [[Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s Jellinek]], the daughter of [[Emil Jellinek]] who had set the specifications for the new model. Between 1900 and 1909 he was a member of DMG's board of management, however had resigned long before the merger.\n\nKarl Benz was a member of the new ''Daimler-Benz'' board of management for the remainder of his life. A new logo was created in 1926, consisting of a three pointed star (representing Daimler's [[motto]]: ''\"engines for land, air, and water\"'') surrounded by traditional [[Bay Laurel|laurels]] from the Benz logo, and the brand of all of its automobiles was labeled ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]''. Model names would follow the brand name in the same convention as today.\n\nThe next year, 1927, the number of units sold tripled to 7,918 and the [[diesel engine|diesel]] line was launched for truck production. In 1928, the ''[[Mercedes-Benz SSK]]'' was presented.\n\nOn 4 April 1929, Karl Benz died at home in Ladenburg at the age of eighty-four from a [[bronchitis|bronchial inflammation]]. Until her death on 5 May 1944, [[Bertha Benz]] continued to reside in their last home. Members of the family resided in the home for thirty more years. The Benz home now has been designated as [[historic preservation|historic]] and is used as a scientific meeting facility for a nonprofit foundation, the ''Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz Foundation'', that honors both Bertha and Karl Benz for their roles in the history of automobiles.\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nCarl-Benz-Memorial (1).jpg|The Carl Benz monument in Mannheim (2015)\nCarl-Benz-Memorial (2).jpg|The Carl Benz monument in Mannheim (2015)\nCarl-Benz-Memorial (3).jpg|The Carl Benz monument in Mannheim (2015)\nCarl-Benz-Memorial (4).jpg|The Carl Benz monument in Mannheim (2015)\nCarl-Benz-Memorial (5).jpg|The Carl Benz monument in Mannheim (2015)\nCarl-Benz-Denkmal (1) 2015.jpg|The Carl Benz monument in Mannheim, in the evening (2015)\n</gallery>\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn 2011, a dramatized television movie about the life of Karl and Bertha Benz was made named ''Carl & Bertha'' which premiered on 11 May<ref>{{in lang|de}} [http://www.swr.de/carlundbertha Genialer T\u00fcftler und bedingungslose Unterst\u00fctzerin], [[S\u00fcdwestrundfunk|SWR]]</ref> and was aired by [[Das Erste]] on 23 May.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1753569/ |title=Carl & Bertha (TV Movie 2011) |date=25 May 2011 |publisher=IMDb}}</ref><ref>{{in lang|de}} [http://programm.daserste.de/pages/programm/detail.aspx?id=30C8FA62CEBE516F83D1AE6F7AE2B2C0 ARD-Themenwoche \"Der mobile Mensch\" Carl & Bertha]</ref> A trailer of the movie<ref>{{in lang|de}} {{YouTube|gS9_XyEwyI4|Carl & Bertha \u2013 Eine Liebe f\u00fcr das Automobil \u2013 SWR \u2013 DAS ERSTE}}</ref> and a \"making of\" special were released on YouTube.<ref>{{YouTube|yHIFE4vOeEo|Making of 'Carl & Bertha' (Film)}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Benz (unit)]]\n*[[German inventors and discoverers]]\n*[[History of the internal combustion engine]]\n*[[Siegfried Marcus]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book |title=Lebensfahrt eines deutschen Erfinders : meine Erinnerungen / Karl Benz |last=Benz |first=Carl |publisher=Koehler und Amelang |year=2001 |isbn=3-7338-0302-7 |location=M\u00fcnchen |language=de}} (autobiography)[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027082313/http://geocities.com/MotorCity/Lane/4444/]\n:''The life of a German inventor: my memories / Karl Benz''\n*{{Cite book |title=Lebensfahrt eines deutschen erfinders; erinnerungen eines achtzigjahrigen |last=Benz |first=Carl Friedrich |publisher=Koehler & Amelang |year=c. 1925 |location=Leipzig |language=de}} (first edition) ([http://catnyp.nypl.org/record=b3903459 bibrec]{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})\n:''The life of a German inventor; memories of an octogenarian''\n*Elis, Angela: ''Mein Traum ist l\u00e4nger als die Nacht.
