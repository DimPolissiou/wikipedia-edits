It comprises both [[District of Columbia Army National Guard|D.C. Army National Guard]] and [[District of Columbia Air National Guard|D.C.

National Guard ===\n[[File:CGs.jpg|thumb|left|(From left to right): District of Columbia Militia commanding generals, Brig. Gen. Richard Simms (January 18, 1918 \u2013 March 31, 1920), Maj. Gen. Anton Stephan (April 28, 1920 \u2013 April 10, 1934) and Brig. Gen. William Harvey (June 4, 1913 \u2013 August 17, 1917)]]\n\nThe D.C. National Guard came about in part due to the efforts of President [[Thomas Jefferson]], the first president to spend his term in District of Columbia He came into office during a time when strife between two major political parties was threatening to tear the new country apart. Soon, the commanding generals of the two closest militia units were members of President Jefferson's rival political party. At this point, there was only a very small regular army, and they were mostly patrolling the border. If one of the state's militias tried to force political will, there would be no way to keep them from marching on the Capitol and coercing\u2014or even overthrowing\u2014the government.\n\nPresident Jefferson saw how vulnerable America's democracy would be if the will of a military general could keep the legislative body from enacting the will of the people. To prevent this, the Militia of the District of Columbia was created in the Assumption Act of May 3, 1802.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Acts of Congress, in Relation to the District of Columbia |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:United_States_Statutes_at_Large_Volume_2.djvu/231 |publisher=U.S. Government |accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe D.C. National Guard is the only local National Guard with a national mission\u2014to protect our Federal Government \u2013 a mission reflected in its motto \"Capital Guardians.\"\n\nOn October 30, 1802, the D.C. Militia held its first muster. President Jefferson hand-selected his new officers and was known to enjoy attending drills. A year later, the Congress officially recognized the organization.\n\n=== The Bladensburg races ===\n\nThe fledgling D.C. Militia was tested during the [[War of 1812]] and the [[Battle of Bladensburg]]. Maryland and Virginia, preoccupied with attacks on their own territory, were sluggish to send troops to D.C. The D.C. Militia, even when augmented by regular forces, was overwhelmed and ordered to withdraw. They watched their nation's capital burn. After the incident, Congress too noticed and increased the size and equipment of the D.C. Militia.\n\nOther than the Headquarters itself, which traces its lineage to 1776 as an elements of the Maryland Militia in Georgetown and Bladensburg, the oldest continuous unit of the D.C. National Guard is Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC), 372nd Military Police Battalion which traces its lineage to the Washington Light Infantry organized in 1836 by John A. Blake.<ref>Compendium, 1986, unpublished, ''District of Columbia Militia & National Guard: Organized and Volunteer Units, 1789 through 1917'', B. Michael Berger & Charles A. Shaughnessy.</ref>\n\n=== Francis Scott Key and the national anthem ===\n\nThe war of 1812 would produce an American treasure and one of the most famous veterans of the D.C. National Guard: [[Francis Scott Key]], a lieutenant with the [[Georgetown, District of Columbia|Georgetown]] Field Artillery of the D.C. Militia. During the British bombardment in Baltimore Barbour, he was sent to Maryland to negotiate with the British for a prisoner exchange. After negotiations, the ship's commander felt Key had seen too much and needed to stay on the ship through the rest of the attack on Baltimore's Fort McHenry. In the morning he observed the flag still flying above the Fort and was inspired to write the poem that became the lyrics to [[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\u2014 the national anthem of the United States. Since Key was on military orders to guarantee his safe passage, it may be said that the Star Spangled Banner was written by a District of Columbia national guardsman on temporary active duty.\n\n=== Inaugural heritage ===\n\nThe D.C. National Guard has played a special role in [[United States presidential inauguration|presidential Inaugurations]], a tradition starting in the earliest days of the nation. The D.C. Militia or National Guard has been at every presidential Inauguration beginning with an honor detail which rode with [[George Washington|President Washington]] in recognition of his time as Virginia's militia commander.\n\n[[File:2013 Presidential Inauguration.png|thumb|right|A D.C. National Guard soldier helps local civilian authorities with traffic control and crowd management, among other activities, at the 2013 presidential inauguration]]\n\nThe D.C. Guard's participation in inaugurations may be that old, but certainly takes form in 1860. The election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] triggered several southern states to eventually secede from the Union. At Lincoln's first inaugural, [[Winfield Scott|Lieutenant General Winfield Scott]], General-in-Chief of the Army, ordered the D.C. Militia to protect the president-elect from harm. The D.C. Militia guarded the parade routes, [[sapper]]s preceded the president-elect, and D.C. [[United States Cavalry|Cavalry]] rode alongside of him, bucking their horses to make it difficult for snipers to take a shot. Upon arriving at the White House the new president received his first military salute from volunteer members of the D.C. Militia and an unbroken tradition of inaugural service was born.\n\nWhen necessary, members of the D.C. National Guard may be deputized as special police, a role the active Army and Air Force cannot perform. That makes the National Guard an important element in large-scale events such as an inauguration. In 2009, the D.C. National Guard led a group of over ten thousand National Guard soldiers and airmen in support of the largest inauguration in history.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Guard to support inauguration |url=http://www.ang.af.mil/Media/Article-Display/Article/436247/national-guard-to-support-inauguration/ |publisher=U.S. Air Force |accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== American Civil War ===\nAs war approached, the D.C. Militia was commanded by [[Major General]] Roger C. Weightman, one of six District of Columbia Mayors to serve as D.C. Militia Colonels or Generals.  His subordinates included Major General Force; [[Brigadier General|brigadier general]]s Bacon and Carrington; and Brigadier General [[Robert Ould]], who would move to Virginia and later join the [[Confederate States Army]].<ref>[[Charles Pomeroy Stone]], \"Washington on the Eve of the War\", in [[Robert Underwood Johnson]] and [[Clarence Clough Buel]] (1887), ''Battles and Leaders of the Civil War'', reprint, Secaucus, NJ:  Castle, pp. 12, {{ISBN|0-89009-569-8}}.</ref>\n\nMaryland and Virginia were both slave states at the beginning of the war, surrounding District of Columbia with potential enemy territory. Three days before the shots at [[Fort Sumter]], President Lincoln called in the D.C. Militia to protect the capital, making it famous for providing \"the first man\u2026first company\u2026first regiment\" mobilized for the [[American Civil War]].\n\nThe D.C. Militia saw an unfortunate first when Private Manual C. Causten became the first Union [[prisoner of war]] captured by the Confederacy during the Civil War.\n\nD.C. Militia soldiers served on active duty for up to four years, engaging in combat during the [[First Battle of Bull Run|Battle of Manassas]] and the [[Jackson's Valley Campaign|Valley Campaign]]. They also maintained their historical role as protectors of the Capital, manning the forts which encircled Washington, D.C. At [[Fort Stevens (Washington, D.C.)|Fort Stevens]], in District of Columbia soldiers included African-American quartermaster clerks who were originally not allowed to join combat regiments.  As D.C. faced attack from the [[Confederate States Army]], they were issued weapons and told to defend their city. President Abraham Lincoln traveled to Fort Stevens to view the fighting. It is said that he was brusquely ordered from harm's way by an officer, possibly Horatio Wright, although other probably apocryphal stories claim that it was [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], later Acting Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. It would be the only time in history that a serving president would face enemy fire.\n\n=== Black militia: 1867\u20131898 ===\nThe Butler [[Zouave|Zouaves]], named after [[Gen. Benjamin F. Butler]], and the Stanton Guard, named after Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]], were the first post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] African-American units to organize. The Butler Zouaves survived the decline of the militia in the late 1870s and, in 1887, entered the then new National Guard of the District of Columbia as its Fifth Battalion. The first unit destined to become a permanent part of the D.C. Guard, however, was the Washington Cadet Corps, established June 12, 1880, as a single company (\"Company A\"), and expanded in October 1884 as a three-company battalion, reaching its full four-company strength in 1885.<ref name=\"Columbia-Historical-Soc 1971-72, Vols. 71-72\" />\n\n=== Protecting the nation's borders ===\nFrom its earliest days, the D.C. National Guard has remained ready to accept the call to protect the [[United States]], participating in the [[Creek War]], [[Seminole Wars]] and Spanish-American In 1898, the D.C's 1st Volunteer Infantry fought alongside the United States Volunteers during the War, where they earned credit for the Santiago Campaign.\n\nThe D.C National Guard served with border patrols on the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Southwest border]] in 1916 during the [[Pancho Villa]] raids, a mission similar to the one they would return to in the 21st century in support of the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]].\n\n=== World War I ===\n\n[[File:Arms room.jpg|thumb|right|Enlisted men of the 1st Separate Battalion, an all African-American unit, examining weapons in the old army arms room prior to [[World War I]]]]\n\nIn 1917, fearing espionage, D.C. National Guard elements were mobilized 12 days before the U.S. officially entered World War I to protect reservoirs and power plants around District of Columbia Military officials were concerned that too many of the D.C. units were made up of men with foreign roots, thus the job of protecting vital facilities fell to the all-black 1st Separate Infantry, the only unit the military believed could be trusted with this mission.\n\nEventually the 1st Separate was mustered into active service and re-designated the 1st Battalion of the [[372nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|372nd Infantry]]. In France, unsure of what to do with an African-American regiment, the 372nd was attached the [[157th Infantry Division (France)|French army's 157th \"Red Hand\" Division]]. The Soldiers fought in [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive|Meuse-Argonne]], [[Lorraine]] and [[Alsace]], where they were awarded the [[Croix de Guerre]]\u2014one of the highest honors bestowed by the French military. [[Mariano Goybet|G\u00e9n\u00e9ral '''Goybet''']], the 157th commanding general, gave the unit a Red Hand insignia in honor of their service. The red hand appears today on the crest of the 372nd Military Police Battalion. Although many D.C. National Guard units were mobilized, the 372nd was the only one to actually see combat during the war.\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nWhen the U.S. entered World War II, the D.C. Guard was immediately mobilized. Ground units served in both the Pacific and European theaters and air units saw service along the Atlantic coast in anti-submarine defense. The D.C. National Guard's 121st Engineer Combat Battalion was among the units in the first wave on Omaha beach in [[Normandy]] on [[Normandy landings|D-Day]], and is immortalized in the 1962 movie, ''The Longest Day''.\n\nIn 1940, the 121st Observation Squadron was organized and began operations at [[Bolling Air Force Base|Bolling Field]] (today Bolling Air Force Base) in District of Columbia It ended the war as the 121st Fighter Squadron. At the end of the war the U.S. Army Air Corps (later the U.S. Air Force) decided to preserve the history of its most famous fighter unit, the 352nd Fighter Group (know affectionately as the ''Bluenosed Bastards of Bodney''), and allocated it to the [[113th Wing|D.C Air National Guard's 113th Wing]]. Since the 113th Wing includes the 121st, it carries the campaign credit from the Antisubmarine Campaign, the Po Valley Campaign, the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|North Apennines Campaign]] and the Rome-Arno Campaign.\n\n=== The Cold War era ===\n\nAt the end of World War II, the D.C. National Guard faced the enormous task of restructuring and retraining. The [[Cold War]] years marked a new relationship between the National Guard and active military. In 1947, the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] was designated a separate branch of the military; the D.C. [[Air National Guard]] became a reality in 1950, when the 113th Wing received federal recognition.\n\nIn 1951, the D.C. Army National Guard's 715th Truck Company became one of the few National Guard units mobilized for the [[Korean War]] to actually go to Korea. They called their orderly room in Korea the [[President's Guest House|Blair House]] after the president's Guest House.\n\nIn 1961, the 113th Wing was activated for a year in support of the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961|Berlin Crisis]]. In 1968, they were again activated by [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B. Johnson]] in response to the Pueblo Crisis. The bulk of the unit was assigned to [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]. Later, many of these airmen deployed as individuals to Vietnam in support of the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n=== Vietnam ===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War most National Guard units were purposefully left out of the war over concern that a National Guard call-up would increase the unpopularity of the war. As part of the individual or \"levied\" replacement program, Air National Guard pilots were allowed to volunteer for deployment to Vietnam. The 113th Wing established a Replacement Training Unit to send [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100C Super Sabre]] pilots to the conflict. In 1968, Lieutenant Colonel Sherman Flanagan, who had been a D.C. air guardsman, was shot down and killed over Vietnam, one of the few National Guard casualties.\n\n=== 9/11 response ===\n\nContinuous combat air patrols were maintained over Washington, D.C., and New York City until the spring of 2002. Today, the D.C. Air National Guard's 113th Aerospace Control Alert Detachment, day, night, rain or shine, are on alert 24/7 protecting the skies of Washington, D.C.\n\nOn the morning of September 11, 2001, a duty officer from the 113th Wing, D.C. Air National Guard, received a call from the [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]] with instructions from the White House to get the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]] in the air. [[The Pentagon]] had just been hit, and the White House knew another airliner, [[United Airlines Flight 93|United Flight 93]]\u2014had been hijacked. After a call with the White House operations center, the 113th Wing commander issued a scrambled order to set up a combat air patrol over D.C. and to deter all aircraft within 20 miles with \"whatever force is necessary\u2026to keep from hitting a building downtown.\" As the F-16 crew returned due to fuel, the next crew went out. There was no time to arm them with missiles, so each fighter went out carrying only 500 training bullets\u2014just enough for a five-second burst. At the time, they believed that there may be more hostile aircraft. Each committed to doing whatever necessary to stop any hostile aircraft they encountered, up to and including ramming the airliner.<ref>{{cite web|title=Memorandum for Record LtCol Marc H Saseville |url=https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2012-042-doc16.pdf |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref> By this point, fighters from [[Langley Air Force Base]] and the fighters from the D.C. National Guard were put in contact with each other. Flight 93 was no longer a threat, but the two units worked together to escort aircraft out of the airspace.\n\nMeanwhile, with little more information that several people at the Pentagon were dead and several more injured, the D.C. Army National Guard helicopter pilots were launched from Davidson Army Air Field to the site of the attack on the Pentagon. They began ferrying casualties to [[Walter Reed National Military Medical Center]] and medical personnel back to the Pentagon.\n\nIn the days after September 11, 600 soldiers from the D.C. Army National Guard were mobilized around the city, including the Capitol building. The Mobilization Augmentation Command reported to duty immediately, becoming the first National Guard unit mobilized for the [[War on Terror|Global War on Terror.]]\n\n=== Global War on Terror ===\nThe D.C. National Guard has deployed more than 1,200 soldiers and airmen to support the Global War on Terror. The D.C. Guard completed over 90 whole-unit deployments, including tours in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Guantanamo Bay]], Saudi Arabia and stateside missions as part of [[Operation Noble Eagle]]. Many D.C. National Guard soldiers and airmen served multiple deployments. Since September 11, 2001, the 113th Wing has provided 24-hour protective coverage over the skies of the [[United States]]'s Capitals, as the \"D.C. National Guard Capitol Guardians.\"\n\nThe D.C National Guard served with border patrols on the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Southwest border]] in 1916 during the [[Pancho Villa]] raids, a mission similar to the one they would return to in the 21st century in support of the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]].\n\n== Unique law ==\nNormally, U.S. [[federal law]] specifically charges the [[National Guard of the United States|U.S. National Guard]] with dual federal and state missions. As [[Maryland]] gave the U.S. federal government jurisdiction in the District of Columbia to establish a [[federal district]], there is no elected governor to command this guard unit. The D.C. National Guard is the only National Guard that reports only to the [[President of the United States|president]].\n\nSupervision and control of D.C. National Guard was delegated by the president to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|defense secretary]] pursuant to Executive Order 10030, 26 January 1949 with authority to designate National Military Establishment officials to administer affairs of the D.C. National Guard. The [[United States Secretary of the Army|Army secretary]] was directed to act in all matters pertaining to the ground component, and the [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Air Force secretary]] was directed to act in all matters pertaining to the air component.\n\nThe D.C. National Guard is the only U.S. military force empowered to carry out federal functions in a state or, in this case, a district. Those functions range from limited actions during non-emergency situations to full scale law enforcement of [[martial law]] when local law enforcement officials can no longer maintain civil control. The National Guard may be called into federal service in response to a call by the president or [[United States Congress|Congress]].\n\nWhen the D.C. National Guard is called to federal service, the president serves as [[Commander-in-Chief|commander-in-chief]]. The federal mission assigned to the U.S. National Guard is \"To provide properly trained and equipped units for prompt mobilization for war, National emergency or as otherwise needed.\"\n\n==List of commanding generals==\nThe District of Columbia commanding general is the senior military officer and commander of the District of Columbia National Guard.\n\nHowever, the Congressional Act of 1871 placed a governor at the head of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Militia, and from 1871 to 1887, there was no commanding general. in 1887, the position of governor was eliminated and a commissioner form of government was established with five appointed commissioners, and the position of commanding general returned.\n\nAs of today, there have been 23 commanding generals of the District of Columbia National Guard.\n\n{|border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Rank\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Appointment\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Date of Relief\n|-\n|Brig.

It usually is constituted as part of a larger local or Federal effort to prepare for or react to an emerging situation, including [[National Special Security Events]].\n\nIt is tasked to support presidential inaugurations, [[State of the Union]] (SOTA) addresses, summits like the [[Nuclear Security Summit]], protests, [[Snowmageddon|weather-related storms]], the annual Washington, D.C., [[Fourth of July]] event, among others.\n\nJTF-DC participates in all inter-agency planning and conducts planning with joint partners in the [[National Capital Region]] (NCR). Additionally, JTF-DC provides support, including traffic control, crowd management and security, for presidential inaugurations and related official ceremonies and events throughout the inaugural period, continuing the tradition of military participation in the presidential inauguration of the commander-in-chief dating back to the inauguration of George Washington in 1789.\n\n== State Partnership Program ==\n[[File:Walker Jamaica Visit.jpg|thumb|right|Brig.

In 1801, The Organic Act designed District of Columbia as the capital of the United States and put its governance under the control of Congress. Which militia would protect a city without a governor under the control of Congress?<ref>\u201cAn act additional to, and amendatory of, an act entitled \u2018An act concerning the District of Columbia\u2019,\u201d approved 3 May 1802, 2 Statutes at Large 195.</ref><ref>\u201cAn act more effectively to provide for the organization of the militia of the District of Columbia,\u201d approved 3 March 1803, 2 Statues at Large 215.</ref>\n\n=== Establishing the D.C. National Guard ===\n[[File:CGs.jpg|thumb|left|(From left to right): District of Columbia Militia commanding generals, Brig. Gen. Richard Simms (January 18, 1918 \u2013 March 31, 1920), Maj. Gen. Anton Stephan (April 28, 1920 \u2013 April 10, 1934) and Brig. Gen. William Harvey (June 4, 1913 \u2013 August 17, 1917)]]\n\nThe D.C. National Guard came about in part due to the efforts of President [[Thomas Jefferson]], the first president to spend his term in District of Columbia He came into office during a time when strife between two major political parties was threatening to tear the new country apart. Soon, the commanding generals of the two closest militia units were members of President Jefferson's rival political party. At this point, there was only a very small regular army, and they were mostly patrolling the border. If one of the state's militias tried to force political will, there would be no way to keep them from marching on the Capitol and coercing\u2014or even overthrowing\u2014the government.\n\nPresident Jefferson saw how vulnerable America's democracy would be if the will of a military general could keep the legislative body from enacting the will of the people. To prevent this, the Militia of the District of Columbia was created in the Assumption Act of May 3, 1802.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Acts of Congress, in Relation to the District of Columbia |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:United_States_Statutes_at_Large_Volume_2.djvu/231 |publisher=U.S. Government |accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe D.C. National Guard is the only local National Guard with a national mission\u2014to protect our Federal Government \u2013 a mission reflected in its motto \"Capital Guardians.\"\n\nOn October 30, 1802, the D.C. Militia held its first muster. President Jefferson hand-selected his new officers and was known to enjoy attending drills. A year later, the Congress officially recognized the organization.\n\n=== The Bladensburg races ===\n\nThe fledgling D.C. Militia was tested during the [[War of 1812]] and the [[Battle of Bladensburg]]. Maryland and Virginia, preoccupied with attacks on their own territory, were sluggish to send troops to D.C. The D.C. Militia, even when augmented by regular forces, was overwhelmed and ordered to withdraw. They watched their nation's capital burn. After the incident, Congress too noticed and increased the size and equipment of the D.C. Militia.\n\nOther than the Headquarters itself, which traces its lineage to 1776 as an elements of the Maryland Militia in Georgetown and Bladensburg, the oldest continuous unit of the D.C. National Guard is Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC), 372nd Military Police Battalion which traces its lineage to the Washington Light Infantry organized in 1836 by John A. Blake.<ref>Compendium, 1986, unpublished, ''District of Columbia Militia & National Guard: Organized and Volunteer Units, 1789 through 1917'', B. Michael Berger & Charles A. Shaughnessy.</ref>\n\n=== Francis Scott Key and the national anthem ===\n\nThe war of 1812 would produce an American treasure and one of the most famous veterans of the D.C. National Guard: [[Francis Scott Key]], a lieutenant with the [[Georgetown, District of Columbia|Georgetown]] Field Artillery of the D.C. Militia. During the British bombardment in Baltimore Barbour, he was sent to Maryland to negotiate with the British for a prisoner exchange. After negotiations, the ship's commander felt Key had seen too much and needed to stay on the ship through the rest of the attack on Baltimore's Fort McHenry. In the morning he observed the flag still flying above the Fort and was inspired to write the poem that became the lyrics to [[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\u2014 the national anthem of the United States. Since Key was on military orders to guarantee his safe passage, it may be said that the Star Spangled Banner was written by a District of Columbia national guardsman on temporary active duty.\n\n=== Inaugural heritage ===\n\nThe D.C. National Guard has played a special role in [[United States presidential inauguration|presidential Inaugurations]], a tradition starting in the earliest days of the nation. The D.C. Militia or National Guard has been at every presidential Inauguration beginning with an honor detail which rode with [[George Washington|President Washington]] in recognition of his time as Virginia's militia commander.\n\n[[File:2013 Presidential Inauguration.png|thumb|right|A D.C. National Guard soldier helps local civilian authorities with traffic control and crowd management, among other activities, at the 2013 presidential inauguration]]\n\nThe D.C. Guard's participation in inaugurations may be that old, but certainly takes form in 1860. The election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] triggered several southern states to eventually secede from the Union. At Lincoln's first inaugural, [[Winfield Scott|Lieutenant General Winfield Scott]], General-in-Chief of the Army, ordered the D.C. Militia to protect the president-elect from harm. The D.C. Militia guarded the parade routes, [[sapper]]s preceded the president-elect, and D.C. [[United States Cavalry|Cavalry]] rode alongside of him, bucking their horses to make it difficult for snipers to take a shot. Upon arriving at the White House the new president received his first military salute from volunteer members of the D.C. Militia and an unbroken tradition of inaugural service was born.\n\nWhen necessary, members of the D.C. National Guard may be deputized as special police, a role the active Army and Air Force cannot perform. That makes the National Guard an important element in large-scale events such as an inauguration. In 2009, the D.C. National Guard led a group of over ten thousand National Guard soldiers and airmen in support of the largest inauguration in history.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Guard to support inauguration |url=http://www.ang.af.mil/Media/Article-Display/Article/436247/national-guard-to-support-inauguration/ |publisher=U.S. Air Force |accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== American Civil War ===\nAs war approached, the D.C. Militia was commanded by [[Major General]] Roger C. Weightman, one of six District of Columbia Mayors to serve as D.C. Militia Colonels or Generals.  His subordinates included Major General Force; [[Brigadier General|brigadier general]]s Bacon and Carrington; and Brigadier General [[Robert Ould]], who would move to Virginia and later join the [[Confederate States Army]].<ref>[[Charles Pomeroy Stone]], \"Washington on the Eve of the War\", in [[Robert Underwood Johnson]] and [[Clarence Clough Buel]] (1887), ''Battles and Leaders of the Civil War'', reprint, Secaucus, NJ:  Castle, pp. 12, {{ISBN|0-89009-569-8}}.</ref>\n\nMaryland and Virginia were both slave states at the beginning of the war, surrounding District of Columbia with potential enemy territory. Three days before the shots at [[Fort Sumter]], President Lincoln called in the D.C. Militia to protect the capital, making it famous for providing \"the first man\u2026first company\u2026first regiment\" mobilized for the [[American Civil War]].\n\nThe D.C. Militia saw an unfortunate first when Private Manual C. Causten became the first Union [[prisoner of war]] captured by the Confederacy during the Civil War.\n\nD.C. Militia soldiers served on active duty for up to four years, engaging in combat during the [[First Battle of Bull Run|Battle of Manassas]] and the [[Jackson's Valley Campaign|Valley Campaign]]. They also maintained their historical role as protectors of the Capital, manning the forts which encircled Washington, D.C. At [[Fort Stevens (Washington, D.C.)|Fort Stevens]], in District of Columbia soldiers included African-American quartermaster clerks who were originally not allowed to join combat regiments.  As D.C. faced attack from the [[Confederate States Army]], they were issued weapons and told to defend their city. President Abraham Lincoln traveled to Fort Stevens to view the fighting. It is said that he was brusquely ordered from harm's way by an officer, possibly Horatio Wright, although other probably apocryphal stories claim that it was [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], later Acting Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. It would be the only time in history that a serving president would face enemy fire.\n\n=== Black militia: 1867\u20131898 ===\nThe Butler [[Zouave|Zouaves]], named after [[Gen. Benjamin F. Butler]], and the Stanton Guard, named after Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]], were the first post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] African-American units to organize. The Butler Zouaves survived the decline of the militia in the late 1870s and, in 1887, entered the then new National Guard of the District of Columbia as its Fifth Battalion. The first unit destined to become a permanent part of the D.C. Guard, however, was the Washington Cadet Corps, established June 12, 1880, as a single company (\"Company A\"), and expanded in October 1884 as a three-company battalion, reaching its full four-company strength in 1885.<ref name=\"Columbia-Historical-Soc 1971-72, Vols. 71-72\" />\n\n=== Protecting the nation's borders ===\nFrom its earliest days, the D.C. National Guard has remained ready to accept the call to protect the [[United States]], participating in the [[Creek War]], [[Seminole Wars]] and Spanish-American In 1898, the D.C's 1st Volunteer Infantry fought alongside the United States Volunteers during the War, where they earned credit for the Santiago Campaign.\n\nThe D.C National Guard served with border patrols on the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Southwest border]] in 1916 during the [[Pancho Villa]] raids, a mission similar to the one they would return to in the 21st century in support of the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]].\n\n=== World War I ===\n\n[[File:Arms room.jpg|thumb|right|Enlisted men of the 1st Separate Battalion, an all African-American unit, examining weapons in the old army arms room prior to [[World War I]]]]\n\nIn 1917, fearing espionage, D.C. National Guard elements were mobilized 12 days before the U.S. officially entered World War I to protect reservoirs and power plants around District of Columbia Military officials were concerned that too many of the D.C. units were made up of men with foreign roots, thus the job of protecting vital facilities fell to the all-black 1st Separate Infantry, the only unit the military believed could be trusted with this mission.\n\nEventually the 1st Separate was mustered into active service and re-designated the 1st Battalion of the [[372nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|372nd Infantry]]. In France, unsure of what to do with an African-American regiment, the 372nd was attached the [[157th Infantry Division (France)|French army's 157th \"Red Hand\" Division]]. The Soldiers fought in [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive|Meuse-Argonne]], [[Lorraine]] and [[Alsace]], where they were awarded the [[Croix de Guerre]]\u2014one of the highest honors bestowed by the French military. [[Mariano Goybet|G\u00e9n\u00e9ral '''Goybet''']], the 157th commanding general, gave the unit a Red Hand insignia in honor of their service. The red hand appears today on the crest of the 372nd Military Police Battalion. Although many D.C. National Guard units were mobilized, the 372nd was the only one to actually see combat during the war.\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nWhen the U.S. entered World War II, the D.C. Guard was immediately mobilized. Ground units served in both the Pacific and European theaters and air units saw service along the Atlantic coast in anti-submarine defense. The D.C. National Guard's 121st Engineer Combat Battalion was among the units in the first wave on Omaha beach in [[Normandy]] on [[Normandy landings|D-Day]], and is immortalized in the 1962 movie, ''The Longest Day''.\n\nIn 1940, the 121st Observation Squadron was organized and began operations at [[Bolling Air Force Base|Bolling Field]] (today Bolling Air Force Base) in District of Columbia It ended the war as the 121st Fighter Squadron. At the end of the war the U.S. Army Air Corps (later the U.S. Air Force) decided to preserve the history of its most famous fighter unit, the 352nd Fighter Group (know affectionately as the ''Bluenosed Bastards of Bodney''), and allocated it to the [[113th Wing|D.C Air National Guard's 113th Wing]]. Since the 113th Wing includes the 121st, it carries the campaign credit from the Antisubmarine Campaign, the Po Valley Campaign, the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|North Apennines Campaign]] and the Rome-Arno Campaign.\n\n=== The Cold War era ===\n\nAt the end of World War II, the D.C. National Guard faced the enormous task of restructuring and retraining. The [[Cold War]] years marked a new relationship between the National Guard and active military. In 1947, the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] was designated a separate branch of the military; the D.C. [[Air National Guard]] became a reality in 1950, when the 113th Wing received federal recognition.\n\nIn 1951, the D.C. Army National Guard's 715th Truck Company became one of the few National Guard units mobilized for the [[Korean War]] to actually go to Korea. They called their orderly room in Korea the [[President's Guest House|Blair House]] after the president's Guest House.\n\nIn 1961, the 113th Wing was activated for a year in support of the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961|Berlin Crisis]]. In 1968, they were again activated by [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B. Johnson]] in response to the Pueblo Crisis. The bulk of the unit was assigned to [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]. Later, many of these airmen deployed as individuals to Vietnam in support of the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n=== Vietnam ===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War most National Guard units were purposefully left out of the war over concern that a National Guard call-up would increase the unpopularity of the war. As part of the individual or \"levied\" replacement program, Air National Guard pilots were allowed to volunteer for deployment to Vietnam. The 113th Wing established a Replacement Training Unit to send [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100C Super Sabre]] pilots to the conflict. In 1968, Lieutenant Colonel Sherman Flanagan, who had been a D.C. air guardsman, was shot down and killed over Vietnam, one of the few National Guard casualties.\n\n=== 9/11 response ===\n\nContinuous combat air patrols were maintained over Washington, D.C., and New York City until the spring of 2002. Today, the D.C. Air National Guard's 113th Aerospace Control Alert Detachment, day, night, rain or shine, are on alert 24/7 protecting the skies of Washington, D.C.\n\nOn the morning of September 11, 2001, a duty officer from the 113th Wing, D.C. Air National Guard, received a call from the [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]] with instructions from the White House to get the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]] in the air. [[The Pentagon]] had just been hit, and the White House knew another airliner, [[United Airlines Flight 93|United Flight 93]]\u2014had been hijacked. After a call with the White House operations center, the 113th Wing commander issued a scrambled order to set up a combat air patrol over D.C. and to deter all aircraft within 20 miles with \"whatever force is necessary\u2026to keep from hitting a building downtown.\" As the F-16 crew returned due to fuel, the next crew went out. There was no time to arm them with missiles, so each fighter went out carrying only 500 training bullets\u2014just enough for a five-second burst. At the time, they believed that there may be more hostile aircraft. Each committed to doing whatever necessary to stop any hostile aircraft they encountered, up to and including ramming the airliner.<ref>{{cite web|title=Memorandum for Record LtCol Marc H Saseville |url=https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2012-042-doc16.pdf |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref> By this point, fighters from [[Langley Air Force Base]] and the fighters from the D.C. National Guard were put in contact with each other. Flight 93 was no longer a threat, but the two units worked together to escort aircraft out of the airspace.\n\nMeanwhile, with little more information that several people at the Pentagon were dead and several more injured, the D.C. Army National Guard helicopter pilots were launched from Davidson Army Air Field to the site of the attack on the Pentagon. They began ferrying casualties to [[Walter Reed National Military Medical Center]] and medical personnel back to the Pentagon.\n\nIn the days after September 11, 600 soldiers from the D.C. Army National Guard were mobilized around the city, including the Capitol building. The Mobilization Augmentation Command reported to duty immediately, becoming the first National Guard unit mobilized for the [[War on Terror|Global War on Terror.]]\n\n=== Global War on Terror ===\nThe D.C. National Guard has deployed more than 1,200 soldiers and airmen to support the Global War on Terror. The D.C. Guard completed over 90 whole-unit deployments, including tours in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Guantanamo Bay]], Saudi Arabia and stateside missions as part of [[Operation Noble Eagle]]. Many D.C. National Guard soldiers and airmen served multiple deployments. Since September 11, 2001, the 113th Wing has provided 24-hour protective coverage over the skies of the [[United States]]'s Capitals, as the \"D.C. National Guard Capitol Guardians.\"\n\nThe D.C National Guard served with border patrols on the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Southwest border]] in 1916 during the [[Pancho Villa]] raids, a mission similar to the one they would return to in the 21st century in support of the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]].\n\n== Unique law ==\nNormally, U.S. [[federal law]] specifically charges the [[National Guard of the United States|U.S. National Guard]] with dual federal and state missions. As [[Maryland]] gave the U.S. federal government jurisdiction in the District of Columbia to establish a [[federal district]], there is no elected governor to command this guard unit. The D.C. National Guard is the only National Guard that reports only to the [[President of the United States|president]].\n\nSupervision and control of D.C. National Guard was delegated by the president to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|defense secretary]] pursuant to Executive Order 10030, 26 January 1949 with authority to designate National Military Establishment officials to administer affairs of the D.C. National Guard. The [[United States Secretary of the Army|Army secretary]] was directed to act in all matters pertaining to the ground component, and the [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Air Force secretary]] was directed to act in all matters pertaining to the air component.\n\nThe D.C. National Guard is the only U.S. military force empowered to carry out federal functions in a state or, in this case, a district. Those functions range from limited actions during non-emergency situations to full scale law enforcement of [[martial law]] when local law enforcement officials can no longer maintain civil control. The National Guard may be called into federal service in response to a call by the president or [[United States Congress|Congress]].\n\nWhen the D.C. National Guard is called to federal service, the president serves as [[Commander-in-Chief|commander-in-chief]]. The federal mission assigned to the U.S. National Guard is \"To provide properly trained and equipped units for prompt mobilization for war, National emergency or as otherwise needed.\"\n\n==List of commanding generals==\nThe District of Columbia commanding general is the senior military officer and commander of the District of Columbia National Guard.\n\nHowever, the Congressional Act of 1871 placed a governor at the head of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Militia, and from 1871 to 1887, there was no commanding general. in 1887, the position of governor was eliminated and a commissioner form of government was established with five appointed commissioners, and the position of commanding general returned.\n\nAs of today, there have been 23 commanding generals of the District of Columbia National Guard.\n\n{|border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Rank\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Appointment\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Date of Relief\n|-\n|Brig.

It usually is constituted as part of a larger local or Federal effort to prepare for or react to an emerging situation, including [[National Special Security Events]].\n\nIt is tasked to support presidential inaugurations, [[State of the Union]] (SOTA) addresses, summits like the [[Nuclear Security Summit]], protests, [[Snowmageddon|weather-related storms]], the annual Washington, D.C., [[Fourth of July]] event, among others.\n\nJTF-DC participates in all inter-agency planning and conducts planning with joint partners in the [[National Capital Region]] (NCR). Additionally, JTF-DC provides support, including traffic control, crowd management and security, for presidential inaugurations and related official ceremonies and events throughout the inaugural period, continuing the tradition of military participation in the presidential inauguration of the commander-in-chief dating back to the inauguration of George Washington in 1789.\n\n== State Partnership Program ==\n[[File:Walker Jamaica Visit.jpg|thumb|right|Brig. Gen. William J. Walker of the D.C. National Guard during his first official visit to Jamiaca, which serves as a State Partnership Program partner with the D.C. National Guard. During his three-day visit, the general met with key [[Jamaica Defense Force]] leaders to discuss continued collaborative training opportunities and visited JDF military facilities around the island to learn more about the capabilities of the JDF.]]\n\nThe [[State Partnership Program]] (SPP) is a joint program of the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) and the individual [[U.S. state|states]], [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|territories]], and [[District of Columbia]].\n\nThe SPP has 73 security partnerships involving 79 nations around the globe. SPP links a component of the Department of Defense \u2013 a state's National Guard \u2013 with the armed forces or equivalent of a partner country in a cooperative, mutually beneficial relationship.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe District of Columbia has one country in the SPP. Jamaica joined the SPP with the District of Columbia National Guard in 1999. Jamaica fall under the area of operations of [[SOUTHCOM]].\n\n== D.C. National Guard Museum ==\nThe D.C. National Guard Museum, also known as Brigadier General Wes Hamilton Museum, is a [[Museum#military museum|military museum]] of the District of Columbia National Guard. It is located at the District of Columbia National Guard headquarters at the [[D.C. Armory]], adjacent to the Stadium-Armory Metro Stop near [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]].\n\nThe collection includes (inside) military artifacts and memorabilia including National Guard weapons, uniforms and diaries, and outside, static displays including an [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]] and a [[Bell UH-1Y Venom|UH-1Y Venom Huey]] helicopter.\n\n== D.C. National Guard decorations ==\n[[Awards and decorations of the National Guard#District of Columbia|Awards and decorations of the D.C. National Guard]] are presented to members of the [[United States National Guard]] in addition to regular [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|United States military decorations]]. The District of Columbia National Guard maintains a series of military decorations for issuance with such awards presented under the authority of the District of Columbia Commanding General.\n\nDistrict of Columbia National Guard Awards:\n* [[File:DC Distinguished Service Medal.png|80px]] District of Columbia Distinguished Service Medal\n* [[File:DC NG Meritorious Service Medal.JPG|80px]] District of Columbia Meritorious Service Medal\n* [[File:DC NG Commendation Medal.JPG|80px]] District of Columbia Commendation Medal\n* [[File:DC NG Achievement Medal.JPG|80px]] District of Columbia Achievement Medal\n* [[File:DC NG Homeland Defense.JPG|80px]] District of Columbia Homeland Defense Medal (ribbon has three red stars in the center).\n* [[File:DC NCO Commendation Ribbon.png|80px]] District of Columbia NCO Commendation Ribbon\n* [[File:DC Enlisted Excellence Ribbon.png|80px]] District of Columbia Enlisted Excellence Ribbon\n* [[File:DC NG Long & Faithful Service Medal.JPG|80px]] District of Columbia Long and Faithful Service Medal (one medal for three years, recognition for five years and additional five-year increments noted with Roman Numerals up to 45 years)\n* [[File:DC Emergency Service Ribbon.png|80px]] District of Columbia Emergency Service Ribbon (Deactivated)\n* [[File:DC Recognition Ribbon.png|80px]] District of Columbia Recognition Ribbon\n* [[File:DC Special Award Ribbon.png|80px]] District of Columbia Special Award Ribbon\n* [[File:DC Recruiting and Retention Ribbon.png|80px]] District of Columbia Recruiting and Retention Ribbon (Deactivated)\n* [[File:DC Community Service Ribbon.png|80px]] District of Columbia Community Service Ribbon\n* [[File:DC Ceremonial Drill Team Color Guard Ribbon.png|80px]] District of Columbia Ceremonial/Drill Team/Color Guard Ribbon\n* [[File:DC Active Duty Ribbon.png|80px]] District of Columbia Active Duty Ribbon (Deactivated)\n* [[File:DC Attendance Ribbon.png|80px]] District of Columbia Attendance Ribbon\n* [[File:DC Commanding General's Outstanding Unit Award.png|80px]] District of Columbia Commanding General's Outstanding Unit Award\n\n== Notable D.C.

[[Kirk Gibson]] carried the Dodger offense, winning the [[National League]] [[Most Valuable Player Award]]. [[Orel Hershiser]] dominated on the mound, throwing a record [[Orel Hershiser's scoreless inning streak|59 consecutive scoreless innings]] on his way to winning the [[Cy Young Award]].\n\n==Offseason==\n* December 11, 1987: Acquired [[Alfredo Griffin]], [[Jay Howell]] and [[Jesse Orosco]] in a three-team deal with the [[Oakland Athletics]] and [[New York Mets]] for [[Bob Welch (baseball)|Bob Welch]], [[Jack Savage]] and [[Matt Young]]\n*January 29, 1988: [[Kirk Gibson]] was signed as a Free Agent.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/g/gibsoki01.shtml</ref>\n*April 1, 1988: Acquired [[John Gibbons]] from the [[New York Mets]] for [[Craig Shipley]]\n\nWith the sub-par 1987 performance fresh in their minds, General Manager [[Fred Claire]] and Field Manager [[Tom Lasorda]] knew what needed to be fixed.  They started the off-season by allowing poor performers such as [[Glenn Hoffman]], [[Ken Landreaux]] and [[Phil Garner]] explore the free agent market.  On December 11, 1987, Claire pulled the trigger on a trade that helped solidify the Dodgers' defense and [[bullpen]], despite giving up one of the top pitchers of the National League in 1987 in Bob Welch.  The Dodgers acquired [[shortstop]] [[Alfredo Griffin]] and [[relief pitchers]] [[Jay Howell]] and [[Jesse Orosco]] in a three-team trade ironically with the Athletics and Mets, the two teams they would eventually defeat in the '88 postseason.  In an attempt to boost the offense for the upcoming season, the Dodgers signed [[Mike Davis (baseball)|Mike Davis]] on December 15, 1987.  The biggest move of the off-season was still to come.\n\nOn January 29, 1988, the Dodgers signed free agent slugger [[Kirk Gibson]] from the [[Detroit Tigers]].  Gibson, who was a 9 year veteran at the time of the signing, was known for his power at the plate and speed on the basepaths, but was also brought in to be a clubhouse leader.  To help solidify their roster the Dodgers went on to sign 21-year veteran pitcher [[Don Sutton]] and 20-year veteran catcher [[Rick Dempsey]].  Dempsey, known for his fiery personality, joined Gibson as the veteran clubhouse leaders.\n\nIt was Gibson, however, who would make the biggest impact.  Some spring training instances brought this out, as follows:\n\n-One day, newly acquired shortstop [[Alfredo Griffin]] was pitching batting practice and was lobbing his pitches to the plate, presenting no challenge to the hitters, at least on the pitches he got over the plate.  A frustrated Gibson yelled, \"Why the (expletive) do we take batting practice if we aren't getting anything out of it?\"\n\n-Preparing for his first spring training game as a Dodger, Gibson began his pregame warm-ups in the outfield. Taking off his hat to wipe sweat from his head, Gibson noticed people laughing. He soon realized that someone had greased the inside of his cap with eyeblack and he had unknowingly wiped it all over himself.  He immediately took off for the visitors' clubhouse, warning manager [[Tommy Lasorda]] on the way, \"Tommy, you find out (expletive) did this, because I'm going to tear his head off!\" Lasorda tried to smooth things over, and culprit [[Jesse Orosco]] eventually tried to apologize, but to no avail.\n\n-Finally, the Dodgers used to play a game called \"flinch\", where a person would fake throwing a punch at another and, if the other person flinched, the one who faked the blow would get to punch the other in the chest.  [[Orel Hershiser]] tried this with Gibson, and Gibson responded by shoving Hershiser with his forearm (\"forearm shiver\") and telling him sternly, \"I don't play 'Flinch'!\"\n\nAll of the above instances served notice that Gibson came to the Dodgers to win, and if Gibson was going to be serious about it, all the other players had better be, too.\n\nKey player from the 1987 team were also brought back.

The Dodgers opening day pitcher was Valenzuela.  The opening day lineup featured Sax, Griffin, Gibson, Marshall, Shelby, Davis, Scioscia and [[Third Baseman]] [[Pedro Guerrero (baseball)|Pedro Guerrero]].  The first pitch of the season, to Sax by Giants pitcher [[Dave Dravecky]], was hit into the Left Field seats at [[Dodger Stadium]].  However, Valenzuela would then give up the lead and the Dodgers would eventually lose the game 5-1. The team would go on to win their next five games and finish April with a 13-7 record which included a four-game sweep of the [[Atlanta Braves]].  Hershiser finished the month of April with a 5-0 record.\n\n===May===\nThe Dodgers went 14-13 during the month of May.  As it had always been, May was one of the toughest months for the Dodgers.  On May 21, 1988, Griffin was hit by a pitch from Mets pitcher [[Dwight Gooden]] on the hand.  Griffin would miss over two months with a broken hand.  This heated up the Dodger-Met rivalry which would last the remainder of the season.  In fact, the next day, May 22, 1988, Mets starting pitcher [[David Cone]] hit Pedro Guerrero in the head in the 6th inning.  As a show of disgust at what the Dodgers felt was headhunting by the Mets pitchers, Guerrero proceeded to stand up, throw his bat in Cone's direction and charge the mound.  A benches clearing m\u00eal\u00e9e ensued and Guerrero and Lasorda were ejected from the game.  Because Griffin had to be placed on the [[disabled list]] with a broken hand the Dodgers were left with a hole at shortstop, though they had a solid replacement in the form of veteran [[Dave Anderson (infielder)|Dave Anderson]].  At times during May, the lead over the Astros neared five games.  By the end of the month the Dodgers' lead in the NL West Division was only a half of a game over the [[Houston Astros]].\n\n===June===\nThe Dodgers had a solid month of June compiling a record of 17-9 over the month.  Hershiser continued his successful year by finishing the month of June with a record of 12-3.  Much of the Dodgers' success to this point in the season could be attributed to solid starting pitching from Hershiser, Leary and the emerging rookie [[Tim Belcher]].  However, the best pitchers of the Dodgers' pitching staff were those who came out of the bullpen.  Orosco, Howell, [[Brian Holton]] and [[Alejandro Pe\u00f1a]] were all enjoying successful seasons.  After a slow start in April, Gibson was now hitting .288 with 15 HR's, 40 RBI, 53 runs scored and 15 SB's.\n\n===August===\nThe summer success continued for the Dodgers as they completed August with a 17-12 record.\nDon Sutton was released August 10 after GM Fred Claire discovered Sutton had informally  discussed a possible front office job with the Houston Astros. Sutton was 3-6 with a 3.92 ERA at the time. Sutton did not sign with another team. His 233 career wins with the Dodgers remains the team record.\n\n===Dramatic summer moments===\nMany{{who|date=September 2014}} who have followed the Dodgers have pointed to a few moments during the months of July and August that got the season going in the right direction, keep the successes going and exemplified what the 1988 Dodgers were all about.\n* July 6, 1988-  Down 3-0 in the bottom of the 8th inning against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], the Dodgers scored three runs then Anderson, [[Mike Sharperson]] and Sax loaded the bases.  The Cardinals would bring in closer [[Todd Worrell]] in an attempt to snuff out the rally.  However, First Baseman [[Franklin Stubbs]] would drive a Worrell offering into the right field seats for a game winning [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]].\n* August 13, 1988- The Dodgers and Giants take the Dodger Stadium fans to the 11th inning with a tie.  Guerrero starts the Dodgers side of the 11th inning with a fly ball to right that Giants outfielder [[Candy Maldonado]] loses in the lights.  A passed ball allows Guerrero to go to second.  However, Guerrero and Lasorda are then ejected from the game arguing that the Giants' pitcher had balked.  Because of this, Stubbs had to pinch run for Guerrero leaving the Dodgers with no additional pinch hitters on their bench.  When pitcher Alejandro Pe\u00f1a's batting spot comes around in the lineup they are forced to pinch hit for him with another pitcher, Tim Leary.  Amazingly, Leary singled back up the middle and Stubbs scored giving the Dodgers the extra inning walk off win.\n* A week after Leary's dramatic game-winning hit, the Dodgers had another walk off win.  The Dodgers entered the bottom of the 9th inning at Dodger Stadium trailing the [[Montreal Expos]] 3-2.  The Expos brought in [[Joe Hesketh]] to close out the game.  After getting Sax out, Hesketh allowed Mickey Hatcher to double.  Anderson ran for Hatcher and Kirk Gibson singled home Anderson.  One out later with John Shelby at the plate, Gibson stole second base.  With John Shelby at the plate, Hesketh threw a wild pitch through catcher [[Nelson Santovenia]].  Gibson advanced to third but did not stop there; the former [[linebacker]] kept going, charging toward the plate that was being covered by pitcher Hesketh.  Santovenia threw back to Hesketh but Gibson beat the throw to the plate giving the Dodgers the win.  Gibson later revealed that part of his reasoning for attempting to take home was that he knew Hesketh had suffered a broken leg earlier in his career and Gibson felt he would not be willing to risk a collision by stepping into the basepath to block off the plate.\n\n===September/October===\nHershiser would begin a scoreless inning streak in September that he would eventually take to over 59 innings and pass Dodger legend [[Don Drysdale]] for the record for most consecutive scoreless innings.  Hershiser would throw complete game shutouts against the Braves on September 5, the Reds on September 10,  the Braves again on September 14, the Astros on September 19 and the Giants on September 23 to take him within 9 innings of Drysdale's record.  Before Hershiser would get a chance to break the record the Dodgers needed to clinch the National League West Championship.  Their chance came in [[San Diego]]  on September 26.  The [[San Diego Padres]] would take a 2-0 lead in the first inning.  But the Dodgers would get 3 runs back and win the game 3-2, clinching the division.  Hershiser would get his next start on September 28 and he would pitch 10 scoreless innings against the Padres to break Drysdale's record.\n\n===Game log===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"width:100%;

Of those, 11 of them would eventually play Major League baseball. The Dodgers lost their second round pick to the [[Oakland Athletics]] as compensation for their signing free agent outfielder [[Mike Davis (baseball)|Mike Davis]].\n\nThe top pick in the draft was Pitcher Bill Bene out of [[California State University, Los Angeles]]. In nine seasons in the Minors he had a record of 18-34 with a 5.45 ERA in 252 games (49 starts). In 2012, he was arrested and sentenced to six months in prison for operating a counterfeit [[karaoke]] business and failing to pay federal taxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20120924/ex-dodgers-pitcher-bill-bene-gets-6-months-in-jail-for-dodging-taxes|title=Ex-Dodgers pitcher Bill Bene gets 6 months in jail for dodging taxes|work=LA Daily News|date=September 23, 2012|accessdate=November 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107015837/http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20120924/ex-dodgers-pitcher-bill-bene-gets-6-months-in-jail-for-dodging-taxes|archive-date=November 7, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThis draft produced two of the Dodgers top players of the 1990s. In the sixth round they selected first baseman [[Eric Karros]] from [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. The 1992 Rookie of the Year and a 1995 Silver Slugger Award winner, Karros hit .268 with 284 homers and 1,027 RBI in 14 seasons (12 of them with the Dodgers) and is the L.A. Dodgers all-time home run leader.\n\nIn the 62nd round with their last pick of the draft the Dodgers selected [[Mike Piazza]] from [[Miami Dade College]] as a favor to his god-father, manager [[Tommy Lasorda]]. Piazza would win the 1993 Rookie of the Year Award and was a 12 time All-Star and 10 time Silver Slugger Award winner in his 16 seasons (mostly with the Dodgers and [[New York Mets]]).

[[Kirk Gibson]] carried the Dodger offense, winning the [[National League]] [[Most Valuable Player Award]]. [[Orel Hershiser]] dominated on the mound, throwing a record [[Orel Hershiser's scoreless inning streak|59 consecutive scoreless innings]] on his way to winning the [[Cy Young Award]].\n\n==Offseason==\n* December 11, 1987: Acquired [[Alfredo Griffin]], [[Jay Howell]] and [[Jesse Orosco]] in a three-team deal with the [[Oakland Athletics]] and [[New York Mets]] for [[Bob Welch (baseball)|Bob Welch]], [[Jack Savage]] and [[Matt Young]]\n*January 29, 1988: [[Kirk Gibson]] was signed as a Free Agent.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/g/gibsoki01.shtml</ref>\n*April 1, 1988: Acquired [[John Gibbons]] from the [[New York Mets]] for [[Craig Shipley]]\n\nWith the sub-par 1987 performance fresh in their minds, General Manager [[Fred Claire]] and Field Manager [[Tom Lasorda]] knew what needed to be fixed.  They started the off-season by allowing poor performers such as [[Glenn Hoffman]], [[Ken Landreaux]] and [[Phil Garner]] explore the free agent market.  On December 11, 1987, Claire pulled the trigger on a trade that helped solidify the Dodgers' defense and [[bullpen]], despite giving up one of the top pitchers of the National League in 1987 in Bob Welch.  The Dodgers acquired [[shortstop]] [[Alfredo Griffin]] and [[relief pitchers]] [[Jay Howell]] and [[Jesse Orosco]] in a three-team trade ironically with the Athletics and Mets, the two teams they would eventually defeat in the '88 postseason.  In an attempt to boost the offense for the upcoming season, the Dodgers signed [[Mike Davis (baseball)|Mike Davis]] on December 15, 1987.  The biggest move of the off-season was still to come.\n\nOn January 29, 1988, the Dodgers signed free agent slugger [[Kirk Gibson]] from the [[Detroit Tigers]].  Gibson, who was a 9 year veteran at the time of the signing, was known for his power at the plate and speed on the basepaths, but was also brought in to be a clubhouse leader.  To help solidify their roster the Dodgers went on to sign 21-year veteran pitcher [[Don Sutton]] and 20-year veteran catcher [[Rick Dempsey]].  Dempsey, known for his fiery personality, joined Gibson as the veteran clubhouse leaders.\n\nIt was Gibson, however, who would make the biggest impact.  Some spring training instances brought this out, as follows:\n\n-One day, newly acquired shortstop [[Alfredo Griffin]] was pitching batting practice and was lobbing his pitches to the plate, presenting no challenge to the hitters, at least on the pitches he got over the plate.  A frustrated Gibson yelled, \"Why the (expletive) do we take batting practice if we aren't getting anything out of it?\"\n\n-Preparing for his first spring training game as a Dodger, Gibson began his pregame warm-ups in the outfield. Taking off his hat to wipe sweat from his head, Gibson noticed people laughing. He soon realized that someone had greased the inside of his cap with eyeblack and he had unknowingly wiped it all over himself.  He immediately took off for the visitors' clubhouse, warning manager [[Tommy Lasorda]] on the way, \"Tommy, you find out (expletive) did this, because I'm going to tear his head off!\" Lasorda tried to smooth things over, and culprit [[Jesse Orosco]] eventually tried to apologize, but to no avail.\n\n-Finally, the Dodgers used to play a game called \"flinch\", where a person would fake throwing a punch at another and, if the other person flinched, the one who faked the blow would get to punch the other in the chest.  [[Orel Hershiser]] tried this with Gibson, and Gibson responded by shoving Hershiser with his forearm (\"forearm shiver\") and telling him sternly, \"I don't play 'Flinch'!\"\n\nAll of the above instances served notice that Gibson came to the Dodgers to win, and if Gibson was going to be serious about it, all the other players had better be, too.\n\nKey player from the 1987 team were also brought back.  These players included [[right fielder]] [[Mike Marshall (outfielder)|Mike Marshall]], [[center fielder]] [[John Shelby]], [[catcher]] [[Mike Scioscia]], [[Second Baseman]] [[Steve Sax]], Utilityman [[Mickey Hatcher]], and [[pitchers]] [[Orel Hershiser]], [[Fernando Valenzuela]], and [[Tim Leary (baseball)|Tim Leary]].\n\n==Regular season==\n\n===Season standings===\n{{1988 NL West standings}}\n\n===Record vs. opponents===\n{{1988 NL Record vs. opponents|team=LAD}}\n\n=== Opening Day lineup ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|+\n!

The Dodgers opening day pitcher was Valenzuela.  The opening day lineup featured Sax, Griffin, Gibson, Marshall, Shelby, Davis, Scioscia and [[Third Baseman]] [[Pedro Guerrero (baseball)|Pedro Guerrero]].  The first pitch of the season, to Sax by Giants pitcher [[Dave Dravecky]], was hit into the Left Field seats at [[Dodger Stadium]].  However, Valenzuela would then give up the lead and the Dodgers would eventually lose the game 5-1. The team would go on to win their next five games and finish April with a 13-7 record which included a four-game sweep of the [[Atlanta Braves]].  Hershiser finished the month of April with a 5-0 record.\n\n===May===\nThe Dodgers went 14-13 during the month of May.  As it had always been, May was one of the toughest months for the Dodgers.  On May 21, 1988, Griffin was hit by a pitch from Mets pitcher [[Dwight Gooden]] on the hand.  Griffin would miss over two months with a broken hand.  This heated up the Dodger-Met rivalry which would last the remainder of the season.  In fact, the next day, May 22, 1988, Mets starting pitcher [[David Cone]] hit Pedro Guerrero in the head in the 6th inning.  As a show of disgust at what the Dodgers felt was headhunting by the Mets pitchers, Guerrero proceeded to stand up, throw his bat in Cone's direction and charge the mound.  A benches clearing m\u00eal\u00e9e ensued and Guerrero and Lasorda were ejected from the game.  Because Griffin had to be placed on the [[disabled list]] with a broken hand the Dodgers were left with a hole at shortstop, though they had a solid replacement in the form of veteran [[Dave Anderson (infielder)|Dave Anderson]].  At times during May, the lead over the Astros neared five games.  By the end of the month the Dodgers' lead in the NL West Division was only a half of a game over the [[Houston Astros]].\n\n===June===\nThe Dodgers had a solid month of June compiling a record of 17-9 over the month.  Hershiser continued his successful year by finishing the month of June with a record of 12-3.  Much of the Dodgers' success to this point in the season could be attributed to solid starting pitching from Hershiser, Leary and the emerging rookie [[Tim Belcher]].  However, the best pitchers of the Dodgers' pitching staff were those who came out of the bullpen.  Orosco, Howell, [[Brian Holton]] and [[Alejandro Pe\u00f1a]] were all enjoying successful seasons.  After a slow start in April, Gibson was now hitting .288 with 15 HR's, 40 RBI, 53 runs scored and 15 SB's.\n\n===August===\nThe summer success continued for the Dodgers as they completed August with a 17-12 record.\nDon Sutton was released August 10 after GM Fred Claire discovered Sutton had informally  discussed a possible front office job with the Houston Astros. Sutton was 3-6 with a 3.92 ERA at the time. Sutton did not sign with another team. His 233 career wins with the Dodgers remains the team record.\n\n===Dramatic summer moments===\nMany{{who|date=September 2014}} who have followed the Dodgers have pointed to a few moments during the months of July and August that got the season going in the right direction, keep the successes going and exemplified what the 1988 Dodgers were all about.\n* July 6, 1988-  Down 3-0 in the bottom of the 8th inning against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], the Dodgers scored three runs then Anderson, [[Mike Sharperson]] and Sax loaded the bases.  The Cardinals would bring in closer [[Todd Worrell]] in an attempt to snuff out the rally.  However, First Baseman [[Franklin Stubbs]] would drive a Worrell offering into the right field seats for a game winning [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]].\n* August 13, 1988- The Dodgers and Giants take the Dodger Stadium fans to the 11th inning with a tie.  Guerrero starts the Dodgers side of the 11th inning with a fly ball to right that Giants outfielder [[Candy Maldonado]] loses in the lights.  A passed ball allows Guerrero to go to second.  However, Guerrero and Lasorda are then ejected from the game arguing that the Giants' pitcher had balked.  Because of this, Stubbs had to pinch run for Guerrero leaving the Dodgers with no additional pinch hitters on their bench.  When pitcher Alejandro Pe\u00f1a's batting spot comes around in the lineup they are forced to pinch hit for him with another pitcher, Tim Leary.  Amazingly, Leary singled back up the middle and Stubbs scored giving the Dodgers the extra inning walk off win.\n* A week after Leary's dramatic game-winning hit, the Dodgers had another walk off win.  The Dodgers entered the bottom of the 9th inning at Dodger Stadium trailing the [[Montreal Expos]] 3-2.  The Expos brought in [[Joe Hesketh]] to close out the game.  After getting Sax out, Hesketh allowed Mickey Hatcher to double.  Anderson ran for Hatcher and Kirk Gibson singled home Anderson.  One out later with John Shelby at the plate, Gibson stole second base.  With John Shelby at the plate, Hesketh threw a wild pitch through catcher [[Nelson Santovenia]].  Gibson advanced to third but did not stop there; the former [[linebacker]] kept going, charging toward the plate that was being covered by pitcher Hesketh.  Santovenia threw back to Hesketh but Gibson beat the throw to the plate giving the Dodgers the win.  Gibson later revealed that part of his reasoning for attempting to take home was that he knew Hesketh had suffered a broken leg earlier in his career and Gibson felt he would not be willing to risk a collision by stepping into the basepath to block off the plate.\n\n===September/October===\nHershiser would begin a scoreless inning streak in September that he would eventually take to over 59 innings and pass Dodger legend [[Don Drysdale]] for the record for most consecutive scoreless innings.  Hershiser would throw complete game shutouts against the Braves on September 5, the Reds on September 10,  the Braves again on September 14, the Astros on September 19 and the Giants on September 23 to take him within 9 innings of Drysdale's record.  Before Hershiser would get a chance to break the record the Dodgers needed to clinch the National League West Championship.  Their chance came in [[San Diego]]  on September 26.  The [[San Diego Padres]] would take a 2-0 lead in the first inning.  But the Dodgers would get 3 runs back and win the game 3-2, clinching the division.  Hershiser would get his next start on September 28 and he would pitch 10 scoreless innings against the Padres to break Drysdale's record.\n\n===Game log===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"width:100%;

Of those, 11 of them would eventually play Major League baseball. The Dodgers lost their second round pick to the [[Oakland Athletics]] as compensation for their signing free agent outfielder [[Mike Davis (baseball)|Mike Davis]].\n\nThe top pick in the draft was Pitcher Bill Bene out of [[California State University, Los Angeles]]. In nine seasons in the Minors he had a record of 18-34 with a 5.45 ERA in 252 games (49 starts). In 2012, he was arrested and sentenced to six months in prison for operating a counterfeit [[karaoke]] business and failing to pay federal taxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20120924/ex-dodgers-pitcher-bill-bene-gets-6-months-in-jail-for-dodging-taxes|title=Ex-Dodgers pitcher Bill Bene gets 6 months in jail for dodging taxes|work=LA Daily News|date=September 23, 2012|accessdate=November 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107015837/http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20120924/ex-dodgers-pitcher-bill-bene-gets-6-months-in-jail-for-dodging-taxes|archive-date=November 7, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThis draft produced two of the Dodgers top players of the 1990s. In the sixth round they selected first baseman [[Eric Karros]] from [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. The 1992 Rookie of the Year and a 1995 Silver Slugger Award winner, Karros hit .268 with 284 homers and 1,027 RBI in 14 seasons (12 of them with the Dodgers) and is the L.A.

Athletics manager [[Tony La Russa]] and Reds manager [[Lou Piniella]] were old friends and teammates from their [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] [[American Legion]] Post 248 team.\n\nBefore the Series, while Peter Gammons of [[ESPN]] had predicted an Oakland sweep, [[Chicago Tribune]] columnist [[Mike Royko]] issued the stunning prediction that the heavily favored A's were \"doomed\", based on the ''[[Ex-Cubs Factor]]''. When the prediction came true, it fueled new interest in that arguably spurious correlation.\n\n[[Cincinnati Reds]] owner [[Marge Schott]], who was drunk at the time,<ref>[http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/10532174/mlb-marge-schott-today-world Marge Schott: 'A mouth unfiltered'] Accessed April 27, 2014</ref> made a major verbal slip-up when she dedicated the 1990 World Series to ''\"our women and men in the [[Far East]]\"'' (Schott meant to say Middle East).  In the first inning of Game 1, Reds center fielder [[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]] hit a home run in left center that nearly hit the CBS television studio where anchor [[Pat O'Brien (television)|Pat O'Brien]] was sitting.\n\nAlso in Game 1, Billy Hatcher helped out offensively in a big way by starting his streak of 7 straight hits in the series (after a walk in the 1st).  Jos\u00e9 Rijo settled in after the early lead and cruised to a surprise Cincinnati victory. The following day, the headline of the ''Cincinnati Post'' newspaper captured the city's surprise with the headline, \"DAVIS STUNS GOLIATH.\"\n\nDuring Game 2, Reds pitcher [[Tom Browning]]'s pregnant wife Debbie went into labor during the game. Debbie left her seat in the fifth inning to drive herself to the hospital. As the game went on, the Reds wanted Browning ready to pitch just in case the game went well into extra innings. Thinking that Browning was en route to a nearby hospital, the Reds had their radio broadcaster [[Marty Brennaman]] put out an [[All Points Bulletin]] on Browning, a bulletin that was picked up by [[Tim McCarver]] on CBS television, who passed it along in the ninth inning.\n\nGame 4 was a pitchers duel between Dave Stewart and Jos\u00e9 Rijo (the Game 1 starters) that eventually culminated in the Reds sweeping the series.  The A's got on the board in the first when Willie McGee doubled and Carney Lansford singled him in.  The game remained 1-0 until the 8th when the Reds finally got to Stewart.\n\nBarry Larkin singled up the middle, Herm Winningham followed with a bunt single, and [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]] reached on a throwing error by Stewart that loaded the bases.  Glen Braggs's groundout and Hal Morris's sacrifice fly gave the Reds a precious 2-1 edge which was preserved by both Rijo, who at one point retired 20 straight batters. Randy Myers, one of the Nasty Boys, appeared in relief and got the final two outs.\n\nThe [[1990 World Series]] would be the Reds 5th championship but would also be remembered as one of the biggest upsets in baseball history. This was the last [[World Series]] to be scheduled to begin play on a Tuesday, and the only since [[1984 World Series|1984]]. The schedule called for the seven-game series to be held Tue-Wed, Fri-Sat-Sun, Tue-Wed. Games 5, 6, and 7, however were not necessary.\n\n===Highlights===\nThe three primary members of the bullpen; [[Norm Charlton]], [[Randy Myers]], and [[Rob Dibble]] (who threw a fastball in excess of 99&nbsp;mph) were known as the \"[[Nasty Boys (Cincinnati Reds)|Nasty Boys]]\" \u2013 and wouldn't let the A's score against them in nearly nine innings of work.  Media talk of a forthcoming A's dynasty led Reds fans to call their own team the \"dyNASTY.\"\n\nReds outfielder [[Billy Hatcher]] set a [[World Series]] record with seven consecutive hits. In addition, Hatcher's .750 batting average, (9 for 12), broke a mark for a four-game World Series that was previously set by [[Babe Ruth]] (.625 in [[1928 World Series|1928]]).\n\n[[Cincinnati Reds]]' pitcher [[Jos\u00e9 Rijo]] became the second [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] born player to earn [[World Series MVP]] honors. The first Dominican born to earn World Series MVP honors was [[Pedro Guerrero (baseball)|Pedro Guerrero]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].\n\n===Matchups===\n\n====Game 1====\nOctober 16, 1990, at [[Riverfront Stadium]] in [[Cincinnati]]\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"  style=\"width:425px; margin-left:3em;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#e6e6e6;\"\n!

Athletics manager [[Tony La Russa]] and Reds manager [[Lou Piniella]] were old friends and teammates from their [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] [[American Legion]] Post 248 team.\n\nBefore the Series, while Peter Gammons of [[ESPN]] had predicted an Oakland sweep, [[Chicago Tribune]] columnist [[Mike Royko]] issued the stunning prediction that the heavily favored A's were \"doomed\", based on the ''[[Ex-Cubs Factor]]''. When the prediction came true, it fueled new interest in that arguably spurious correlation.\n\n[[Cincinnati Reds]] owner [[Marge Schott]], who was drunk at the time,<ref>[http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/10532174/mlb-marge-schott-today-world Marge Schott: 'A mouth unfiltered'] Accessed April 27, 2014</ref> made a major verbal slip-up when she dedicated the 1990 World Series to ''\"our women and men in the [[Far East]]\"'' (Schott meant to say Middle East).  In the first inning of Game 1, Reds center fielder [[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]] hit a home run in left center that nearly hit the CBS television studio where anchor [[Pat O'Brien (television)|Pat O'Brien]] was sitting.\n\nAlso in Game 1, Billy Hatcher helped out offensively in a big way by starting his streak of 7 straight hits in the series (after a walk in the 1st).  Jos\u00e9 Rijo settled in after the early lead and cruised to a surprise Cincinnati victory. The following day, the headline of the ''Cincinnati Post'' newspaper captured the city's surprise with the headline, \"DAVIS STUNS GOLIATH.\"\n\nDuring Game 2, Reds pitcher [[Tom Browning]]'s pregnant wife Debbie went into labor during the game. Debbie left her seat in the fifth inning to drive herself to the hospital. As the game went on, the Reds wanted Browning ready to pitch just in case the game went well into extra innings. Thinking that Browning was en route to a nearby hospital, the Reds had their radio broadcaster [[Marty Brennaman]] put out an [[All Points Bulletin]] on Browning, a bulletin that was picked up by [[Tim McCarver]] on CBS television, who passed it along in the ninth inning.\n\nGame 4 was a pitchers duel between Dave Stewart and Jos\u00e9 Rijo (the Game 1 starters) that eventually culminated in the Reds sweeping the series.  The A's got on the board in the first when Willie McGee doubled and Carney Lansford singled him in.  The game remained 1-0 until the 8th when the Reds finally got to Stewart.\n\nBarry Larkin singled up the middle, Herm Winningham followed with a bunt single, and [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]] reached on a throwing error by Stewart that loaded the bases.  Glen Braggs's groundout and Hal Morris's sacrifice fly gave the Reds a precious 2-1 edge which was preserved by both Rijo, who at one point retired 20 straight batters. Randy Myers, one of the Nasty Boys, appeared in relief and got the final two outs.\n\nThe [[1990 World Series]] would be the Reds 5th championship but would also be remembered as one of the biggest upsets in baseball history. This was the last [[World Series]] to be scheduled to begin play on a Tuesday, and the only since [[1984 World Series|1984]]. The schedule called for the seven-game series to be held Tue-Wed, Fri-Sat-Sun, Tue-Wed. Games 5, 6, and 7, however were not necessary.\n\n===Highlights===\nThe three primary members of the bullpen; [[Norm Charlton]], [[Randy Myers]], and [[Rob Dibble]] (who threw a fastball in excess of 99&nbsp;mph) were known as the \"[[Nasty Boys (Cincinnati Reds)|Nasty Boys]]\" \u2013 and wouldn't let the A's score against them in nearly nine innings of work.  Media talk of a forthcoming A's dynasty led Reds fans to call their own team the \"dyNASTY.\"\n\nReds outfielder [[Billy Hatcher]] set a [[World Series]] record with seven consecutive hits. In addition, Hatcher's .750 batting average, (9 for 12), broke a mark for a four-game World Series that was previously set by [[Babe Ruth]] (.625 in [[1928 World Series|1928]]).\n\n[[Cincinnati Reds]]' pitcher [[Jos\u00e9 Rijo]] became the second [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] born player to earn [[World Series MVP]] honors. The first Dominican born to earn World Series MVP honors was [[Pedro Guerrero (baseball)|Pedro Guerrero]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].\n\n===Matchups===\n\n====Game 1====\nOctober 16, 1990, at [[Riverfront Stadium]] in [[Cincinnati]]\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"  style=\"width:425px; margin-left:3em;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#e6e6e6;\"\n!
