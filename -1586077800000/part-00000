This finish is produced by polishing with a 220\u2013280 grit belt or wheel softened with a 220\u2013230 greaseless compound or very fine non woven abrasive belt or pad. Polishing lines will be soft and less reflective than a #4 architectural finish.\n\n; #7 Finish\nA #7 finish is produced by polishing with a 280\u2013320 belt or wheel and sisal buffing with a cut and color compound. This is a semi-bright finish that will still have some polishing lines but they will be very dull. Carbon steel and iron are commonly polished to a #7 finish before chrome plating. A #7 finish can be made bright by color buffing with coloring compound and a cotton buff. This is commonly applied to keep polishing costs down when a part needs to be shiny but not flawless.\n\n; #8 Finish\nAlso known as a mirror finish. This finish is produced by polishing with at least a 320 grit belt or wheel finish. Care will be taken in making sure all surface defects are removed. The part is sisal buffed and then color buffed to achieve a mirror finish.  The quality of this finish is dependent on the quality of the metal being polished. Some alloys of steel and aluminum cannot be brought to a mirror finish. Castings that have slag or pits will also be difficult, if not impossible, to polish to a #8.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Industrial finishing]]\n*[[Surface engineering]]\n*[[Surface science]]\n*[[Textile finishing]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Citation | last = Degarmo | first = E.

This finish enhances the physical appearance of the metal as well as increases the sanitary benefits. <ref>http://www.ofrmetals.com/services/polishing</ref>One takes great care to remove any surface defects in the metal, like pits, that could allow bacteria to grow. A #4 dairy or sanitary finish is produced by polishing with a 180\u2013240 grit belt or wheel finish softened with 120\u2013240 grit greaseless compound or a fine non woven abrasive belt or pad.\n\n; #6 Finish\nAlso known as a fine satin finish. This finish is produced by polishing with a 220\u2013280 grit belt or wheel softened with a 220\u2013230 greaseless compound or very fine non woven abrasive belt or pad. Polishing lines will be soft and less reflective than a #4 architectural finish.\n\n; #7 Finish\nA #7 finish is produced by polishing with a 280\u2013320 belt or wheel and sisal buffing with a cut and color compound. This is a semi-bright finish that will still have some polishing lines but they will be very dull. Carbon steel and iron are commonly polished to a #7 finish before chrome plating. A #7 finish can be made bright by color buffing with coloring compound and a cotton buff. This is commonly applied to keep polishing costs down when a part needs to be shiny but not flawless.\n\n; #8 Finish\nAlso known as a mirror finish. This finish is produced by polishing with at least a 320 grit belt or wheel finish. Care will be taken in making sure all surface defects are removed. The part is sisal buffed and then color buffed to achieve a mirror finish.  The quality of this finish is dependent on the quality of the metal being polished. Some alloys of steel and aluminum cannot be brought to a mirror finish. Castings that have slag or pits will also be difficult, if not impossible, to polish to a #8.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Industrial finishing]]\n*[[Surface engineering]]\n*[[Surface science]]\n*[[Textile finishing]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Citation | last = Degarmo | first = E.

In a combat arms role, a sergeant first class is typically in charge of from 18 soldiers and four tanks in an armor platoon to 40 soldiers in a rifle platoon. A sergeant first class's primary responsibilities are tactical logistics, tactical casualty evacuations, and serving as the senior tactical adviser to the platoon leader.  Sergeant first class replaced the rank of [[technical sergeant]] in 1948. (However, the U.S. Air Force, which separated from the Army in 1947, retained the rank of technical sergeant and the U.S. Marine Corps had the rank of technical sergeant until 1959.)\n\nA sergeant first class is addressed as \"sergeant\" except in certain situations, such as field artillery units, in which a sergeant first class serving as platoon sergeant is commonly referred to as \"Smoke.\" If a sergeant first class is appointed to fill the role of [[first sergeant]], he or she is addressed as \"First Sergeant.\" Typically a sergeant first class assigned on a manning document to fill a first sergeant role while being promotable to master sergeant can be [[frocking|frocked]] to first sergeant rank and hold the insignia due its position.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nSergeant first class is the first enlisted rank in the U.S. Army to be selected by the centralized promotion system. As such, it is considerably more difficult to achieve than the previous ranks. A sergeant first class is the first enlisted rank to be considered a senior non-commissioned officer, and a soldier achieving the rank gains not only prestige, but several benefits due to the position. For example, a sergeant first class cannot be demoted by standard [[Non-judicial punishment|non-judicial punishment]]. To demote a senior non-commissioned officer requires a court martial, or congressional approval, and normally occurs only for offenses that carry heavy punishments.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe rank title of sergeant first class (SFC) existed in the Army from 1890 <ref>26-Stat-653</ref> until 1920 when it was eliminated in an army-wide simplification of enlisted ranks which had grown into a system containing 128 different rank insignia. The rank of SFC was used in several technical branches such as the Army Medical Department and in the Ordnance, Signal, and Quartermaster Corps and was equivalent to the field service ranks at the company/battery/troop \"staff\" NCO level, such as color sergeant, supply sergeant, or radio sergeant. The Army restored the rank of SFC in 1948 when it replaced [[technical sergeant]]. (Perrenot, 2009)<ref>Perrenot,P.

In a combat arms role, a sergeant first class is typically in charge of from 18 soldiers and four tanks in an armor platoon to 40 soldiers in a rifle platoon. A sergeant first class's primary responsibilities are tactical logistics, tactical casualty evacuations, and serving as the senior tactical adviser to the platoon leader.  Sergeant first class replaced the rank of [[technical sergeant]] in 1948. (However, the U.S. Air Force, which separated from the Army in 1947, retained the rank of technical sergeant and the U.S. Marine Corps had the rank of technical sergeant until 1959.)\n\nA sergeant first class is addressed as \"sergeant\" except in certain situations, such as field artillery units, in which a sergeant first class serving as platoon sergeant is commonly referred to as \"Smoke.\" If a sergeant first class is appointed to fill the role of [[first sergeant]], he or she is addressed as \"First Sergeant.\" Typically a sergeant first class assigned on a manning document to fill a first sergeant role while being promotable to master sergeant can be [[frocking|frocked]] to first sergeant rank and hold the insignia due its position.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nSergeant first class is the first enlisted rank in the U.S. Army to be selected by the centralized promotion system. As such, it is considerably more difficult to achieve than the previous ranks. A sergeant first class is the first enlisted rank to be considered a senior non-commissioned officer, and a soldier achieving the rank gains not only prestige, but several benefits due to the position. For example, a sergeant first class cannot be demoted by standard non-judicial punishment. To demote a senior non-commissioned officer requires a court martial, or congressional approval, and normally occurs only for offenses that carry heavy punishments.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe rank title of sergeant first class (SFC) existed in the Army from 1890 <ref>26-Stat-653</ref> until 1920 when it was eliminated in an army-wide simplification of enlisted ranks which had grown into a system containing 128 different rank insignia. The rank of SFC was used in several technical branches such as the Army Medical Department and in the Ordnance, Signal, and Quartermaster Corps and was equivalent to the field service ranks at the company/battery/troop \"staff\" NCO level, such as color sergeant, supply sergeant, or radio sergeant. The Army restored the rank of SFC in 1948 when it replaced [[technical sergeant]]. (Perrenot, 2009)<ref>Perrenot,P.

Thus they are often referred to in English-language research as \"[[Viking]] Rus'\". The scholarly consensus <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/viking/the-vikings-at-home/|title=The Vikings at home|website=History Extra}}</ref> is that the Rus' people originated in what is currently coastal [[East Middle Sweden|eastern Sweden]] around the eighth century and that their name has the same origin as [[Roslagen]] in [[Sweden]] (with the older name being ''[[Roden, Sweden|Roden]]'').\n\nBasing themselves among [[Slavs]] and [[Volga Finns]] in the upper [[Volga region]], they formed a diaspora of traders and raiders exchanging furs and slaves for silk, silver and other commodities available to the east and south. Around the ninth century, on the river routes to the [[Black Sea]], they had an unclear but significant role in forming the principality of [[Kievan Rus]], gradually assimilating with local [[Slavic peoples|Slavic populations]]. They also extended their operations much further east and south, among the [[Bulgars]] and [[Khazars]], on the routes to the [[Caspian Sea]]. By around the eleventh century, the word ''Rus{{'}}'' was increasingly associated with the principality of Kiev, and the term ''[[Varangian]]'' was becoming more common as a term for Scandinavians traveling the river-routes.\n\nLittle, however, is certain about the Rus{{'}}. This is to a significant extent because, although Rus{{'}} people were active over a long period and vast distances, textual evidence for their activities is very sparse and almost never produced by contemporary Rus' people themselves. It is believed that writing was brought to the Rus by the Slavs for religious reasons, but this happened long after their early history. The word ''Rus{{'}}'' in the primary sources does not always mean the same thing as it does when used by today's scholars. Meanwhile, archaeological evidence and researchers' understanding of it is accumulating only gradually. As a trading diaspora, Rus' people intermingled extensively with Finnic, Slavic, and Turkic peoples and their customs and identity seem correspondingly to have varied considerably over time and space.\n\nThe other key reason for dispute about the origins of Rus' people is the likelihood that they had a role in ninth- to tenth-century state formation in eastern Europe (ultimately giving their name to [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]]), making them relevant to what are today seen as the national histories of [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Sweden]], [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], [[Finland]] and [[Baltic states]]. \n\n== Key sources ==\n=== Etymology ===\n{{Main|Rus' (name)}}\n[[File:Europe 814.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Europe]] in the 9th century.

This is partly because of a widespread assumption that by identifying the linguistic origin of the name ''Rus{{'}}'', scholars can identify the origins of the people whom it described.

There was no law among them, but tribe rose against tribe. Discord thus ensued among them, and they began to war one against the other. They said to themselves, \"Let us seek a prince who may rule over us, and judge us according to the Law\". They accordingly went overseas to the Varangian Russes: these particular Varangians were known as Russes, just as some are called [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]], and others [[Normans]], [[Angles|English]], and [[Gutes|Gotlanders]], for they were thus named. The Chuds, the Slavs, the Krivichians and the Ves' then said to the people of Rus', \"Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign over us\". Thus they selected three brothers, with their kinsfolk, who took with them all the Russes and migrated. The oldest, Rurik, located himself in Novgorod; the second, [[Sineus and Truvor|Sineus]], at [[Beloozero]]; and the third, [[Sineus and Truvor|Truvor]], in [[Izborsk]].

The Varangians (''Varyags'', in [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]]) are first mentioned by the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' as having exacted tribute from the Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859. It was the time of rapid expansion of the Vikings in Northern Europe; England began to pay [[Danegeld]] in 859, and the [[Curonians]] of [[Grobin]] faced an invasion by the Swedes at about the same date.\n\nIt has been argued that the word ''Varangian'', in its many forms, does not appear in primary sources until the eleventh century (though it does appear frequently in later sources describing earlier periods). This suggests that the term ''Rus{{'}}'' was used broadly to denote Scandinavians until it became too firmly associated with the now extensively Slavicised elite of Kievan Rus. At that point, the new term ''Varangian'' was increasingly preferred to name Scandinavians, probably mostly from what is currently Sweden,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Forte|first1=Angelo|first2=Richard|last2=Oram|first3=Frederik|last3=Pedersen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vEd859jvk0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Viking Empires|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year= 2005|ISBN= 0-521-82992-5|pages=13\u201314}}</ref> plying the river-routes between the Baltic and the Black/Caspian Seas.<ref>Marika M\u00e4gi, ''In <i>Austrvegr</i>: The Role of the Eastern Baltic in Viking Age Communication Across the Baltic Sea'', The Northern World, 84 (Leiden: Brill, 2018), p. 195, citing Alf Thulin, 'The Rus' of Nestor's Chronicle', ''Mediaeval Scandinavia'', 13 (2000), 70-96.</ref>\n\nDue largely to geographic considerations, it is often argued that most of the Varangians who traveled and settled in the lands of eastern Baltic, modern Russian Federation and lands to the south came from the area of modern [[Sweden]].\n\nThe Varangians left a number of [[varangian runestones|rune stones]] in their native [[Sweden]] that tell of their journeys to what is today Russia, Ukraine, Greece, and Belarus. Most of these rune stones can be seen today, and are a telling piece of historical evidence. The [[Varangian runestones]] tell of many notable Varangian expeditions, and even account for the fates of individual warriors and travelers.\n\nIn Russian history, two cities are used to describe the beginnings of the country: Kiev and Novgorod.<ref name=\"auto9\">Duczko, Wladyslaw. Viking Rus\u202f: Studies on the Presence of Scandinavians in Eastern Europe. The Northern World. Leiden: Brill, 2004.</ref> In the first part of the eleventh century the former was already a Slav metropolis, rich and powerful, a fast growing center of civilization adopted from Byzantium. The latter town, Novgorod, was another center of the same culture but founded in different surroundings, where some old local traditions molded this commercial city into a mighty oligarchic republic of a kind otherwise unknown in this part of Europe. These towns have tended to overshadow other places of a significance that they had acquired long before Kiev and Novgorod. The two original centers of Rus were Staraja Ladoga and Rurikovo Gorodishche, two points on the ends the Volkhov, a river running for 200 km between [[Lake Ilmen]] in the south to [[Lake Ladoga]] in the north<ref name=\"auto9\"/>. This was the territory that most probably was originally called by the Norsemen Gardar, a name that long after Viking Age was given much wider content and become Gardariki, denomination for whole Old Russian State. The area between the lakes was the original Rus, and it was from here its name was transferred to the Slav territories on the middle Dnieper, which eventually became \u201cRuskaja zemlja\u201d.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> The pre-history of the first territory of Rus has been sought in the developments around the mid eighth century, when Staraja Ladoga was founded as a trading place, serving the operations of Scandinavian hunters and dealers in furs obtained in the north-eastern forest zone of Eastern Europe. In the early period (the second part of the eighth and first part of the ninth century) Norse presence is only visible at Staraja Ladoga, and to a much lesser degree at a few other sites in the northern parts of Eastern Europe. The objects that represent Norse material culture of this period are rare outside Ladoga and mostly known as single finds. This rarity continues through the ninth century until the whole situation changes radically during the next century, when historians meet, at many places and in relatively large quantities, the material remains of a thriving Scandinavian culture.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> For a short period of time, some areas of Eastern Europe became as much part of the Norse world as were Danish and Norwegian territories in the West. The culture of the Rus contained Norse elements used as a manifestation of their Scandinavian background. These elements, which were current in tenth century Scandinavia, appear at various places in form of collections of many types of metal ornaments, mainly female but even male, such as weapons, decorated parts of horse bridle, and diverse objects embellished in current Norse art styles.<ref name=\"auto9\"/>\n\n== Debate on the origins of the Rus' ==\nThe historiography of the origins of the Rus' is infamously contentious, due to its perceived importance for the legitimation of nation-building, imperialism, and independence movements within the Slavonic-speaking world, and for legitimating different political relationships between eastern and western European countries.

At the beginning of an important speech in 1749, later published as ''Origines gentis et nominis Russorum'' ('The Origins of the People and the Name of the Russians'), M\u00fcller argued that Russia owed its name and early ruling dynasty to ethnically Scandinavian Varangians.<ref name=\"auto11\">Serhii Plokhy, ''Ukraine and Russia: Representations of the Past'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008), chapter 1.</ref><ref>Elena Melnikova, 'The \"Varangian Problem\": Science in the Grip of Ideology and Politics', in ''Russia's Identity in International Relations: Images, Perceptions, Misperceptions'', ed. by Ray Taras (Abingdon: Routledge, 2013), pp. 42-52 (p. 43).</ref> This statement caused anger in his Russian audience, and earned him much animosity during his professional career in Russia.<ref name=\"auto11\"/><ref name=\"auto10\"/> Scathing criticism from [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Lomonosov]], [[Stepan Krasheninnikov|Krasheninnikov]], and other Russian historians led to M\u00fcller being forced to suspend his work on the issue until Lomonosov's death.

Lunt offer explanations that go beyond simplistic attempts to attribute 'ethnicity' on ''prima facie'' interpretation of literary, philological, and archaeological evidence. They view the Rus' as disparate, and often mutually antagonistic, clans of charismatic warriors and traders who formed wide-ranging networks across the North and Baltic Seas.<ref name=\"Pritsak 1981 14\">{{harvtxt|Pritsak|1981|p=14}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Lunt|1975|p=271}}</ref> They were a \"multi-ethnic, multilingual and non-territorial community of sea nomads and trading settlements\" that contained numerous Norsemen\u2014but equally Slavs, Balts, and Finns.<ref name=\"Pritsak 1981 14\"/>\n\nEvidence provided by the ''Primary Chronicle'', written some three centuries later, cannot be taken as an accurate ethnographic account; as tales of 'migration' from distant lands were common literary ''topoi'' used by rulers to legitimise their contemporary rule whilst at the same time differentiating themselves from their \"Baltic\" and \"Slavic\" subject tribes.

The Rus' appeared to emulate aspects of [[Khazar]] political organization\u2014hence the mention of a Rus' ''[[Khagan|chaganus]]'' in the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] court in 839 (''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'').

Devoid of any silver dirham finds in the 8th century AD, it was situated west of the profitable fur and silver trade networks that spanned from the Baltic to the Muslim lands, via the [[Volga region|Volga]]-[[Kama River|Kama]] basins. At the prime hill in Kiev, fortifications and other symbols of consolidation and power appear from the 9th century, thus preceding the literary appearance of 'Rus' in the middle Dnieper region. By the 10th century, the lowlands around Kiev had extensive 'Slavic' styled settlements, and there is evidence of growing trade with the Byzantine lands. This might have attracted Rus' movements, and a shift in power, from the north to Kiev.<ref>{{harvtxt|Franklin|1996|pp=90\u2013122}}</ref> Thus, Kiev does not appear to have evolved from the infrastructure of the Scandinavian trade networks, but rather it forcibly took them over, as evidenced by the destruction of numerous earlier trade settlements in the north, including the famous [[Staraya Ladoga|Staraja Ladoga]].<ref>Tolochko p. 186</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* ''The Annals of Saint-Bertin'', transl.

Thus they are often referred to in English-language research as \"[[Viking]] Rus'\". The scholarly consensus <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/viking/the-vikings-at-home/|title=The Vikings at home|website=History Extra}}</ref> is that the Rus' people originated in what is currently coastal [[East Middle Sweden|eastern Sweden]] around the eighth century and that their name has the same origin as [[Roslagen]] in [[Sweden]] (with the older name being ''[[Roden, Sweden|Roden]]'').\n\nBasing themselves among [[Slavs]] and [[Volga Finns]] in the upper [[Volga region]], they formed a diaspora of traders and raiders exchanging furs and slaves for silk, silver and other commodities available to the east and south. Around the ninth century, on the river routes to the [[Black Sea]], they had an unclear but significant role in forming the principality of [[Kievan Rus]], gradually assimilating with local [[Slavic peoples|Slavic populations]]. They also extended their operations much further east and south, among the [[Bulgars]] and [[Khazars]], on the routes to the [[Caspian Sea]]. By around the eleventh century, the word ''Rus{{'}}'' was increasingly associated with the principality of Kiev, and the term ''[[Varangian]]'' was becoming more common as a term for Scandinavians traveling the river-routes.\n\nLittle, however, is certain about the Rus{{'}}. This is to a significant extent because, although Rus{{'}} people were active over a long period and vast distances, textual evidence for their activities is very sparse and almost never produced by contemporary Rus' people themselves. It is believed that writing was brought to the Rus by the Slavs for religious reasons, but this happened long after their early history. The word ''Rus{{'}}'' in the primary sources does not always mean the same thing as it does when used by today's scholars. Meanwhile, archaeological evidence and researchers' understanding of it is accumulating only gradually. As a trading diaspora, Rus' people intermingled extensively with Finnic, Slavic, and Turkic peoples and their customs and identity seem correspondingly to have varied considerably over time and space.\n\nThe other key reason for dispute about the origins of Rus' people is the likelihood that they had a role in ninth- to tenth-century state formation in eastern Europe (ultimately giving their name to [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]]), making them relevant to what are today seen as the national histories of [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Sweden]], [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], [[Finland]] and [[Baltic states]]. \n\n== Key sources ==\n=== Etymology ===\n{{Main|Rus' (name)}}\n[[File:Europe 814.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Europe]] in the 9th century. [[Roslagen]] is located along the coast of the northern tip of the pink area marked ''\"Swedes and Goths\"''.]]\n\nThe etymology and semantic history of the word ''Rus{{'}}'' has been a highly contentious topic, on which debate is ongoing.

The Chuds, the Slavs, the Krivichians and the Ves' then said to the people of Rus', \"Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign over us\". Thus they selected three brothers, with their kinsfolk, who took with them all the Russes and migrated.

The Varangians (''Varyags'', in [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]]) are first mentioned by the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' as having exacted tribute from the Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859. It was the time of rapid expansion of the Vikings in Northern Europe; England began to pay [[Danegeld]] in 859, and the [[Curonians]] of [[Grobin]] faced an invasion by the Swedes at about the same date.\n\nIt has been argued that the word ''Varangian'', in its many forms, does not appear in primary sources until the eleventh century (though it does appear frequently in later sources describing earlier periods). This suggests that the term ''Rus{{'}}'' was used broadly to denote Scandinavians until it became too firmly associated with the now extensively Slavicised elite of Kievan Rus. At that point, the new term ''Varangian'' was increasingly preferred to name Scandinavians, probably mostly from what is currently Sweden,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Forte|first1=Angelo|first2=Richard|last2=Oram|first3=Frederik|last3=Pedersen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vEd859jvk0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Viking Empires|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year= 2005|ISBN= 0-521-82992-5|pages=13\u201314}}</ref> plying the river-routes between the Baltic and the Black/Caspian Seas.<ref>Marika M\u00e4gi, ''In <i>Austrvegr</i>: The Role of the Eastern Baltic in Viking Age Communication Across the Baltic Sea'', The Northern World, 84 (Leiden: Brill, 2018), p. 195, citing Alf Thulin, 'The Rus' of Nestor's Chronicle', ''Mediaeval Scandinavia'', 13 (2000), 70-96.</ref>\n\nDue largely to geographic considerations, it is often argued that most of the Varangians who traveled and settled in the lands of eastern Baltic, modern Russian Federation and lands to the south came from the area of modern [[Sweden]].\n\nThe Varangians left a number of [[varangian runestones|rune stones]] in their native [[Sweden]] that tell of their journeys to what is today Russia, Ukraine, Greece, and Belarus. Most of these rune stones can be seen today, and are a telling piece of historical evidence. The [[Varangian runestones]] tell of many notable Varangian expeditions, and even account for the fates of individual warriors and travelers.\n\nIn Russian history, two cities are used to describe the beginnings of the country: Kiev and Novgorod.<ref name=\"auto9\">Duczko, Wladyslaw. Viking Rus\u202f: Studies on the Presence of Scandinavians in Eastern Europe. The Northern World. Leiden: Brill, 2004.</ref> In the first part of the eleventh century the former was already a Slav metropolis, rich and powerful, a fast growing center of civilization adopted from Byzantium. The latter town, Novgorod, was another centre of the same culture but founded in different surroundings, where some old local traditions molded this commercial city into a mighty oligarchic republic of a kind otherwise unknown in this part of Europe. These towns have tended to overshadow other places of a significance that they had acquired long before Kiev and Novgorod. The two original centers of Rus were Staraja Ladoga and Rurikovo Gorodishche, two points on the ends the Volkhov, a river running for 200 km between [[Lake Ilmen]] in the south to [[Lake Ladoga]] in the north<ref name=\"auto9\"/>. This was the territory that most probably was originally called by the Norsemen Gardar, a name that long after Viking Age was given much wider content and become Gardariki, denomination for whole Old Russian State. The area between the lakes was the original Rus, and it was from here its name was transferred to the Slav territories on the middle Dnieper, which eventually became \u201cRuskaja zemlja\u201d.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> The pre-history of the first territory of Rus has been sought in the developments around the mid eighth century, when Staraja Ladoga was founded as a trading place, serving the operations of Scandinavian hunters and dealers in furs obtained in the north-eastern forest zone of Eastern Europe. In the early period (the second part of the eighth and first part of the ninth century) Norse presence is only visible at Staraja Ladoga, and to a much lesser degree at a few other sites in the northern parts of Eastern Europe. The objects that represent Norse material culture of this period are rare outside Ladoga and mostly known as single finds. This rarity continues through the ninth century until the whole situation changes radically during the next century, when historians meet, at many places and in relatively large quantities, the material remains of a thriving Scandinavian culture.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> For a short period of time, some areas of Eastern Europe became as much part of the Norse world as were Danish and Norwegian territories in the West.

Lunt offer explanations that go beyond simplistic attempts to attribute 'ethnicity' on ''prima facie'' interpretation of literary, philological, and archaeological evidence. They view the Rus' as disparate, and often mutually antagonistic, clans of charismatic warriors and traders who formed wide-ranging networks across the North and Baltic Seas.<ref name=\"Pritsak 1981 14\">{{harvtxt|Pritsak|1981|p=14}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Lunt|1975|p=271}}</ref> They were a \"multi-ethnic, multilingual and non-territorial community of sea nomads and trading settlements\" that contained numerous Norsemen\u2014but equally Slavs, Balts, and Finns.<ref name=\"Pritsak 1981 14\"/>\n\nEvidence provided by the ''Primary Chronicle'', written some three centuries later, cannot be taken as an accurate ethnographic account; as tales of 'migration' from distant lands were common literary ''topoi'' used by rulers to legitimise their contemporary rule whilst at the same time differentiating themselves from their \"Baltic\" and \"Slavic\" subject tribes. Tolochko argues \"the story of the royal clan's journey is a device with its own function within the narrative of the chronicle. ... Yet if we take it for what it actually is, if we accept that it is not a documentary ethnographic description of the 10th century, but a medieval ''origo gentis''{{efn|[[Origin myth#Founding myth|founding myth]]}} masterfully constructed by a Christian cleric of the early 12th century, then we have to reconsider the established scholarly narrative of the earliest phase of East European history, which owes so much to the ''Primary Chronicle''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Tolochko|2008|p=184 & 188, resp}}</ref>\n\nArchaeological research, synthesizing a wide range of twentieth-century excavations, has begun to develop what Jonathan Shepard has called a 'bottom up' vision of the formation of the Rus' polity, in which, during the ninth and tenth century increasingly intensive trade networks criss-crossed linguistically and ethnically diverse groups around rivers like the Volga, the Don, the Dnieper. This may have produced 'an essentially voluntary convergence of groupings in common pursuit of primary produce exchangeable for artifacts from afar'.<ref>Jonathan Shepherd, 'Review Article: Back in Old Rus and the USSR: Archaeology, History and Politics', ''English Historical Review'', vol. 131 (no. 549) (2016), 384-405 {{DOI|10.1093/ehr/cew104}} (pp. 389-402, quoting p. 397).</ref> This fits well with the image of Rus' that dominates the Arabic sources, focusing further south and east, around the Black and Caspian Seas, the Caucasus and the Volga Bulghars.<ref>Thorir Jonsson Hraundal, 'New Perspectives on Eastern Vikings/Rus in Arabic Sources', ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'', 10 (2014), 65\u201369 {{DOI|10.1484/J.VMS.5.1052}} (pp. 70-71).</ref> Yet this narrative, though plausible, contends with the 'top-down' image of state development implied by the ''Primary Chronicle'', archaeological assemblages indicating Scandinavian-style weapon-bearing elites on the Upper Volga, and evidence for slave-trading and violent destruction of fortified settlements.<ref>Jonathan Shepherd, 'Review Article: Back in Old Rus and the USSR: Archaeology, History and Politics', ''English Historical Review'', vol. 131 (no. 549) (2016), 384-405 {{DOI|10.1093/ehr/cew104}} (pp. 389-402).</ref><ref>Thorir Jonsson Hraundal, 'New Perspectives on Eastern Vikings/Rus in Arabic Sources', ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'', 10 (2014), 65\u201369 {{DOI|10.1484/J.VMS.5.1052}} (p. 71).</ref>\n\nNumerous artefacts of Scandinavian affinity have been found in northern Russia. However, exchange between the north and southern shores of the Baltic had occurred since the Iron Age (albeit limited to immediately coastal areas).<ref>{{harvtxt|Franklin|1996|p=9}}</ref> Northern Russia and adjacent Finnic lands had become a profitable meeting ground for peoples of diverse origins, especially for the trade of furs, and attracted by the presence of oriental silver from the mid-8th century AD.<ref>{{harvtxt|Franklin|1996|p=12}}</ref> There is an undeniable presence of goods and people of Scandinavian origin; however, the predominant people remained the local (Baltic and Finnic) peoples.<ref>{{harvtxt|Franklin|1996|pp=22-25}}</ref>\n\nThe increasing volume of trade and internal competition necessitated higher forms of organization. The Rus' appeared to emulate aspects of [[Khazar]] political organization\u2014hence the mention of a Rus' ''[[Khagan|chaganus]]'' in the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] court in 839 (''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]''). Legitimization was sought by way of adopting a Christian and linguistically Slavic ''high culture'' that became the ''Kieven Rus<nowiki>'</nowiki>''.<ref>Pritsak, p. 31</ref> The burials ('chamber' or 'retainer' graves) attributed to the Kievan Rus' have only a superficial resemblance to supposed Scandinavian prototypes\u2014only the grave construction was similar, whilst the range of accompanying artefacts, the inclusion of weapons, horses and slave girls have no parallels in Scandinavia.<ref>Shephard, pp. 122\u20133</ref> Moreover, there is doubt if the emerging Kievan Rus' were the same clan as the \"Rus\" who visited the Carolingians in 839 or who attacked Constantinople in 860&nbsp;AD.<ref>Tolochko, p. 187</ref>\n\nThe rise of Kiev itself is mysterious. Devoid of any silver dirham finds in the 8th century AD, it was situated west of the profitable fur and silver trade networks that spanned from the Baltic to the Muslim lands, via the [[Volga region|Volga]]-[[Kama River|Kama]] basins. At the prime hill in Kiev, fortifications and other symbols of consolidation and power appear from the 9th century, thus preceding the literary appearance of 'Rus' in the middle Dnieper region. By the 10th century, the lowlands around Kiev had extensive 'Slavic' styled settlements, and there is evidence of growing trade with the Byzantine lands. This might have attracted Rus' movements, and a shift in power, from the north to Kiev.<ref>{{harvtxt|Franklin|1996|pp=90\u2013122}}</ref> Thus, Kiev does not appear to have evolved from the infrastructure of the Scandinavian trade networks, but rather it forcibly took them over, as evidenced by the destruction of numerous earlier trade settlements in the north, including the famous [[Staraya Ladoga|Staraja Ladoga]].<ref>Tolochko p. 186</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* ''The Annals of Saint-Bertin'', transl.

He was born and raised until the age of 10 in Israel, where his experiences with entertainment would later influence his storytelling techniques. He studied computer science at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], before searching for work in the video game industry.\n\nDruckmann's first video game work was as an intern at Naughty Dog. In 2004, he became a programmer on ''[[Jak 3]]'' and ''[[Jak X: Combat Racing]]'', before becoming game designer for ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' and ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]''. He was later chosen to lead [[Development of The Last of Us|development]] on ''The Last of Us'' as creative director, a role he continued during the development of ''Uncharted 4: A Thief's End''. In addition, Druckmann has also written comic books. He worked on the motion comic ''[[Uncharted: Eye of Indra]]'', prior to the creation of his own graphic novel ''[[A Second Chance at Sarah]]''. He later co-wrote ''[[The Last of Us: American Dreams]]'' with artist [[Faith Erin Hicks]], and is currently working on a sequel to ''The Last of Us'', subtitled ''[[The Last of Us Part II|Part II]]'', and a television adaptation.\n\nDruckmann has received high praise for his work on ''The Last of Us'', receiving several awards and nominations for his contributions, including two [[British Academy Games Awards|BAFTA Awards]], two [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences|DICE Awards]], and three [[Writers Guild of America Awards]]. His work on ''Uncharted 4'' was also praised and awarded.\n\n== Early life ==\nNeil Druckmann was born in [[Israel]] on December 5, 1978,<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/><ref name=\"ETC\"/><ref name=\"Creative\"/> to Yehudit \"Judy\" and Jerry Ilan Druckmann.<ref name=\"Israel\"/><ref name=\"Ynet parents\"/> At a young age, Druckmann's older brother Emanuel showed him comic books, video games, and movies.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> These forms of entertainment, particularly video games by [[Sierra Entertainment]] and [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/> helped Druckmann learn English.<ref name=\"ETC\"/> Druckmann became particularly interested in storytelling, and wrote his own comic books.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> He moved to the United States with his family in 1989.<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/> He attended middle school and high school in [[Miami, Florida]], then studied criminology at the [[University of Florida]].<ref name=\"Creative\"/> His brother sneaked him into the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"Brother E3\"/> Druckmann worked as a clerk at [[My Favorite Muffin]] and as a sales person at [[PacSun]].<ref name=\"Twitter Jobs\"/>\n\nDruckmann soon became a graphics research assistant at [[Florida State University]], while living in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/><ref name=\"Twitter Jobs\"/> He spent a year at the university working at the Visualization Lab<ref name=\"CMU work\"/> within the School of Computational Science and Information Technology, beginning in July 2002. During this time, he began developing the game ''Pink-Bullet'', for [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows]], with some friends.<ref name=\"FSU resume\"/> At one point, he wanted to be an animator, which required enlisting in art classes, but his parents forbade him from doing so.<ref name=\"Newsarama\"/> After taking a programming class, Druckmann realized that it was his preference,<ref name=\"Creative\"/> and began a [[Bachelor of Computer Science]] in December 2002, which he completed the following year.<ref name=\"FSU resume\"/> Druckmann moved to [[Pittsburgh]], where he attended [[Carnegie Mellon University]];<ref name=\"Creative\"/> in August 2003, he began his Master's degree in Entertainment Technology,<ref name=\"FSU resume\"/> which he earned in 2005<ref name=\"Creative\"/> from the [[Entertainment Technology Center]].<ref name=\"Edge\"/> In April 2004, Druckmann developed the game ''Dikki Painguin in: TKO for the Third Reich'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] as a student at Carnegie Mellon, in collaboration with fellow student Allan Blomquist.<ref name=\"Dikki Painguin\"/><ref name=\"Dikki Painguin 2\"/>\n\n== Career ==\nAt the [[Game Developers Conference]], Druckmann met [[Naughty Dog]] co-founder [[Jason Rubin]]. After Druckmann \"bugged\" Rubin, the latter gave him his business card.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> In 2004, Druckmann joined Naughty Dog as a programming intern, before being promoted to a full-time position as a gameplay programmer a few months later.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> During the development of ''[[Jak 3]]'' (2004) and ''[[Jak X: Combat Racing]]'' (2005), Druckmann continued to ask co-president Evan Wells about joining the design team. Wells restrained from moving him to the design team, as he was originally employed as a programmer, but agreed to review Druckmann's design work if he completed them after working hours. Following the development of ''Jak X'', Wells concluded that Druckmann was skilled in the field of design, and gave him the role of game designer for ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' (2007).<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/> In this position, he worked closely with [[Amy Hennig]] to construct the story of ''Uncharted'', before working on ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]'' (2009) as a lead game designer, becoming more involved with the core writing of the game.<ref name=\"Creative\"/><ref name=\"Edge\"/> Druckmann also worked on the original design and story of ''[[Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier]]'' (2009), prior to Naughty Dog's abandonment of the game; [[High Impact Games]] completed development.<ref name=\"Frontier\"/>\n\nIn 2009, Druckmann worked on the motion comic ''[[Uncharted: Eye of Indra]]'', as writer and director. A prequel to ''Drake's Fortune'', ''Eye of Indra'' tells the story of [[Nathan Drake (character)|Nathan Drake]] prior to the events of the first game.<ref name=\"Indra\"/> Druckmann's first [[graphic novel]], ''[[A Second Chance at Sarah]]'', was published by Ape Entertainment in February 2010.<ref name=\"ASCAS2\"/> With illustrations by artist Joysuke Wong, the novel relates Druckmann's interest in traveling back in time to meet his wife at a younger age. \"There's something cute and poetic about that idea,\" Druckmann explained.<ref name=\"ASCAS\"/> He felt that he shares many similarities with the novel's protagonist Johnny, and that \"a lot of Johnny's flaws and fears are based on [his] own shortcomings\".<ref name=\"ASCAS\"/> The comic was originally released on February 24, 2010;<ref name=\"ASCAS3\"/> critics particularly praised Wong's illustrations, as well as Druckmann's writing and character development.<ref name=\"ASCAS4\"/>\n\nFollowing the development of ''Uncharted 2'', Naughty Dog split into two teams to work on projects concurrently. With one team working on ''[[Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception]]'' (2011), co-presidents Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra chose Druckmann and [[Bruce Straley]] to lead [[Development of The Last of Us|development]] on a new game; Druckmann was chosen for his determination and talent for design.<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/> Though they were originally set to develop a new game in the ''[[Jak and Daxter]]'' series, the team felt that they \"weren't doing service to the fans of [the] franchise\", and decided to create a new [[Intellectual property|game]], titled ''[[The Last of Us]]''.<ref name=\"Jak 4\"/>\n\n[[File:Bruce Straley and Neil Druckmann, PAX Prime 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Druckmann (right) with game director [[Bruce Straley]] (left) at [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX Prime]] 2014. The two worked closely throughout the development of ''The Last of Us'' and ''Uncharted 4: A Thief's End''.|alt=A man with short brown hair, sitting next to a man with curly black hair hugging a plush giraffe, both smiling at something to the right of the camera.]]\n\nWhen conceiving ideas for ''The Last of Us'', Druckmann used a concept that he created as a student at Carnegie Mellon University. His idea was to merge the gameplay of ''[[Ico]]'' (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968), with a lead character similar to [[John Hartigan]] from ''[[Sin City]]'' (1991\u20132000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to his heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. He based ''The Last of Us'' on this concept, replacing the police officer with Joel, and naming the young girl [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]].<ref name=\"failure\"/> Druckmann wrote ''The Last of Us'' with the intention of having the story \"rooted firmly within reality\", a stark departure from Naughty Dog's previous \"light and loose\" feeling. \"It needed to go a little darker [than ''Uncharted''] to explore a sadder theme,\" he explained.<ref name=\"OPM Look Back\"/> Prior to directing the game, Druckmann took acting classes in order to \"talk to [the actors] in the same language\".<ref name=\"Edge\"/> The game was released on June 14, 2013, with praise for Druckmann's work on the story.<ref name=\"TLOU Roundup\"/> He earned numerous awards, including a [[British Academy Video Games Awards|BAFTA]],<ref name=\"BAFTA\"/> a [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences|DICE Award]],<ref name=\"DICE\"/> a [[Game Developers Choice Awards|Game Developers Choice Award]],<ref name=\"GDCA\"/> a [[Golden Joystick Awards|Golden Joystick Award]],<ref name=\"CVG_2013\"/> and a [[Writers Guild of America Awards|Writers Guild of America Award]].<ref name=\"WGAA\"/>\n\nDruckmann later worked on the [[Downloadable content|downloadable]] [[expansion pack]] ''[[The Last of Us: Left Behind]]'', a prequel focusing on Ellie's relationship with her friend Riley,<ref name=\"TLOULB\"/> which received critical acclaim.<ref name=\"VG247\"/> He earned additional accolades for his work on ''Left Behind'', including a second BAFTA<ref name=\"BAFTA15\"/> and Writers Guild of America Award.<ref name=\"WGAA15\"/> In particular, he was praised for writing a scene involving a kiss between two female characters, which was named a \"breakthrough moment\" for video games.<ref name=\"Kotaku breakthrough\"/> He also co-wrote the four-issue comic book miniseries ''[[The Last of Us: American Dreams]]'', with writer and artist [[Faith Erin Hicks]]. It was published by [[Dark Horse Comics]], with the first issue released in April 2013,<ref name=\"TLOUAD\"/> and was lauded for Druckmann's writing and character development, as well as Hicks' simplistic illustrations.<ref name=\"TLOUAD BD\"/><ref name=\"TLOUAD IGN\"/>\n\nFollowing Hennig's departure from Naughty Dog in March 2014, it was announced that Druckmann and Straley were working on ''[[Uncharted 4: A Thief's End]]'' (2016) as creative director and game director respectively.<ref name=\"UC4\"/> Initial reports claimed that Hennig was \"forced out\" of Naughty Dog by Druckmann and Straley, though co-presidents Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra later denied this.<ref name=\"Hennig\"/> Druckmann co-wrote the story alongside Josh Scherr;<ref name=\"U4 Ending\"/> Druckmann considered Scherr the \"funny one\", allowing him to write the humour of ''Uncharted 4'' due to Druckmann's self-professed inability to write jokes. He appreciated the collaboration of writing on ''Uncharted 4'', having written ''The Last of Us'' almost entirely independently.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> The game was released on May 10, 2016 to and praised for its story.<ref name=\"U4 Roundup\"/> It was awarded Best Narrative at [[The Game Awards 2016]],<ref name=\"Game Awards\"/> and Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing at the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2016|69th Writers Guild of America Awards]].<ref name=\"WGAA17\"/> Druckmann acted as head of narrative development for ''[[Uncharted: The Lost Legacy]]'', released in August 2017.<ref name=\"UCLL\"/>\n\nIn March 2014, Sony announced that Druckmann was writing a film adaptation of ''The Last of Us'', produced by [[Sam Raimi]] and distributed by [[Screen Gems]].<ref name=\"IGN Movie\"/> By January 2015, he had written the script's second draft, and performed a [[read-through]] with some actors.<ref name=\"IGN Movie2\"/> Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered [[development hell]],<ref name=\"IGN Movie3\"/> and in February 2018 said \"I don't want that movie to be made.\"<ref name=\"DoG Movie\"/> Druckmann is currently co-writing a sequel to the first game, titled ''The Last of Us Part II'', alongside Halley Gross;<ref name=\"Gross\"/> Straley will not return to co-direct the game.<ref name=\"TLOU2 Straley\"/> Druckmann worked as a playtester for ''[[What Remains of Edith Finch]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"Edith Finch\"/> In August 2017, he was featured as a guest judge on an episode of ''[[Face Off (TV series)|Face Off]]''.<ref name=\"Face Off\"/> Druckmann was promoted to Vice President of Naughty Dog in March 2018.<ref name=\"VP\"/>\n\nDruckmann is acting as a writer and executive producer on a television adaptation of ''The Last of Us'' for [[HBO]], expected to cover events of this game and possibly some parts of its sequel.<ref name=\"TLOU HBO\"/>\n\n== Writing style ==\nDruckmann's writing philosophy, which he realized while talking to game designer [[Cory Barlog]], is \"simple story, complex characters\"; Druckmann dislikes video games with complicated exposition, but enjoys writing complex character relationships.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> Throughout his writing, Druckmann approaches scenes with focus on every character, attempting to enter the mindset of each one.

He was born and raised until the age of 10 in Israel, where his experiences with entertainment would later influence his storytelling techniques. He studied computer science at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], before searching for work in the video game industry.\n\nDruckmann's first video game work was as an intern at Naughty Dog. In 2004, he became a programmer on ''[[Jak 3]]'' and ''[[Jak X: Combat Racing]]'', before becoming game designer for ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' and ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]''. He was later chosen to lead [[Development of The Last of Us|development]] on ''The Last of Us'' as creative director, a role he continued during the development of ''Uncharted 4: A Thief's End''. In addition, Druckmann has also written comic books. He worked on the motion comic ''[[Uncharted: Eye of Indra]]'', prior to the creation of his own graphic novel ''[[A Second Chance at Sarah]]''. He later co-wrote ''[[The Last of Us: American Dreams]]'' with artist [[Faith Erin Hicks]], and is currently working on a sequel to ''The Last of Us'', subtitled ''[[The Last of Us Part II|Part II]]'', and a television adaptation.\n\nDruckmann has received high praise for his work on ''The Last of Us'', receiving several awards and nominations for his contributions, including two [[British Academy Games Awards|BAFTA Awards]], two [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences|DICE Awards]], and three [[Writers Guild of America Awards]]. His work on ''Uncharted 4'' was also praised and awarded.\n\n== Early life ==\nNeil Druckmann was born in [[Israel]] on December 5, 1978,<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/><ref name=\"ETC\"/><ref name=\"Creative\"/> to Yehudit \"Judy\" and Jerry Ilan Druckmann.<ref name=\"Israel\"/><ref name=\"Ynet parents\"/> At a young age, Druckmann's older brother Emanuel showed him comic books, video games, and movies.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> These forms of entertainment, particularly video games by [[Sierra Entertainment]] and [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/> helped Druckmann learn English.<ref name=\"ETC\"/> Druckmann became particularly interested in storytelling, and wrote his own comic books.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> He moved to the United States with his family in 1989.<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/> He attended middle school and high school in [[Miami, Florida]], then studied criminology at the [[University of Florida]].<ref name=\"Creative\"/> His brother sneaked him into the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"Brother E3\"/> Druckmann worked as a clerk at [[My Favorite Muffin]] and as a sales person at [[PacSun]].<ref name=\"Twitter Jobs\"/>\n\nDruckmann soon became a graphics research assistant at [[Florida State University]], while living in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/><ref name=\"Twitter Jobs\"/> He spent a year at the university working at the Visualization Lab<ref name=\"CMU work\"/> within the School of Computational Science and Information Technology, beginning in July 2002. During this time, he began developing the game ''Pink-Bullet'', for [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows]], with some friends.<ref name=\"FSU resume\"/> At one point, he wanted to be an animator, which required enlisting in art classes, but his parents forbade him from doing so.<ref name=\"Newsarama\"/> After taking a programming class, Druckmann realized that it was his preference,<ref name=\"Creative\"/> and began a [[Bachelor of Computer Science]] in December 2002, which he completed the following year.<ref name=\"FSU resume\"/> Druckmann moved to [[Pittsburgh]], where he attended [[Carnegie Mellon University]];<ref name=\"Creative\"/> in August 2003, he began his Master's degree in Entertainment Technology,<ref name=\"FSU resume\"/> which he earned in 2005<ref name=\"Creative\"/> from the [[Entertainment Technology Center]].<ref name=\"Edge\"/> In April 2004, Druckmann developed the game ''Dikki Painguin in: TKO for the Third Reich'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] as a student at Carnegie Mellon, in collaboration with fellow student Allan Blomquist.<ref name=\"Dikki Painguin\"/><ref name=\"Dikki Painguin 2\"/>\n\n== Career ==\nAt the [[Game Developers Conference]], Druckmann met [[Naughty Dog]] co-founder [[Jason Rubin]]. After Druckmann \"bugged\" Rubin, the latter gave him his business card.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> In 2004, Druckmann joined Naughty Dog as a programming intern, before being promoted to a full-time position as a gameplay programmer a few months later.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> During the development of ''[[Jak 3]]'' (2004) and ''[[Jak X: Combat Racing]]'' (2005), Druckmann continued to ask co-president Evan Wells about joining the design team. Wells restrained from moving him to the design team, as he was originally employed as a programmer, but agreed to review Druckmann's design work if he completed them after working hours. Following the development of ''Jak X'', Wells concluded that Druckmann was skilled in the field of design, and gave him the role of game designer for ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' (2007).<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/> In this position, he worked closely with [[Amy Hennig]] to construct the story of ''Uncharted'', before working on ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]'' (2009) as a lead game designer, becoming more involved with the core writing of the game.<ref name=\"Creative\"/><ref name=\"Edge\"/> Druckmann also worked on the original design and story of ''[[Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier]]'' (2009), prior to Naughty Dog's abandonment of the game; [[High Impact Games]] completed development.<ref name=\"Frontier\"/>\n\nIn 2009, Druckmann worked on the motion comic ''[[Uncharted: Eye of Indra]]'', as writer and director. A prequel to ''Drake's Fortune'', ''Eye of Indra'' tells the story of [[Nathan Drake (character)|Nathan Drake]] prior to the events of the first game.<ref name=\"Indra\"/> Druckmann's first [[graphic novel]], ''[[A Second Chance at Sarah]]'', was published by Ape Entertainment in February 2010.<ref name=\"ASCAS2\"/> With illustrations by artist Joysuke Wong, the novel relates Druckmann's interest in traveling back in time to meet his wife at a younger age. \"There's something cute and poetic about that idea,\" Druckmann explained.<ref name=\"ASCAS\"/> He felt that he shares many similarities with the novel's protagonist Johnny, and that \"a lot of Johnny's flaws and fears are based on [his] own shortcomings\".<ref name=\"ASCAS\"/> The comic was originally released on February 24, 2010;<ref name=\"ASCAS3\"/> critics particularly praised Wong's illustrations, as well as Druckmann's writing and character development.<ref name=\"ASCAS4\"/>\n\nFollowing the development of ''Uncharted 2'', Naughty Dog split into two teams to work on projects concurrently. With one team working on ''[[Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception]]'' (2011), co-presidents Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra chose Druckmann and [[Bruce Straley]] to lead [[Development of The Last of Us|development]] on a new game; Druckmann was chosen for his determination and talent for design.<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/> Though they were originally set to develop a new game in the ''[[Jak and Daxter]]'' series, the team felt that they \"weren't doing service to the fans of [the] franchise\", and decided to create a new [[Intellectual property|game]], titled ''[[The Last of Us]]''.<ref name=\"Jak 4\"/>\n\n[[File:Bruce Straley and Neil Druckmann, PAX Prime 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Druckmann (right) with game director [[Bruce Straley]] (left) at [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX Prime]] 2014. The two worked closely throughout the development of ''The Last of Us'' and ''Uncharted 4: A Thief's End''.|alt=A man with short brown hair, sitting next to a man with curly black hair hugging a plush giraffe, both smiling at something to the right of the camera.]]\n\nWhen conceiving ideas for ''The Last of Us'', Druckmann used a concept that he created as a student at Carnegie Mellon University. His idea was to merge the gameplay of ''[[Ico]]'' (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968), with a lead character similar to [[John Hartigan]] from ''[[Sin City]]'' (1991\u20132000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to his heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. He based ''The Last of Us'' on this concept, replacing the police officer with Joel, and naming the young girl [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]].<ref name=\"failure\"/> Druckmann wrote ''The Last of Us'' with the intention of having the story \"rooted firmly within reality\", a stark departure from Naughty Dog's previous \"light and loose\" feeling. \"It needed to go a little darker [than ''Uncharted''] to explore a sadder theme,\" he explained.<ref name=\"OPM Look Back\"/> Prior to directing the game, Druckmann took acting classes in order to \"talk to [the actors] in the same language\".<ref name=\"Edge\"/> The game was released on June 14, 2013, with praise for Druckmann's work on the story.<ref name=\"TLOU Roundup\"/> He earned numerous awards, including a [[British Academy Video Games Awards|BAFTA]],<ref name=\"BAFTA\"/> a [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences|DICE Award]],<ref name=\"DICE\"/> a [[Game Developers Choice Awards|Game Developers Choice Award]],<ref name=\"GDCA\"/> a [[Golden Joystick Awards|Golden Joystick Award]],<ref name=\"CVG_2013\"/> and a [[Writers Guild of America Awards|Writers Guild of America Award]].<ref name=\"WGAA\"/>\n\nDruckmann later worked on the [[Downloadable content|downloadable]] [[expansion pack]] ''[[The Last of Us: Left Behind]]'', a prequel focusing on Ellie's relationship with her friend Riley,<ref name=\"TLOULB\"/> which received critical acclaim.<ref name=\"VG247\"/> He earned additional accolades for his work on ''Left Behind'', including a second BAFTA<ref name=\"BAFTA15\"/> and Writers Guild of America Award.<ref name=\"WGAA15\"/> In particular, he was praised for writing a scene involving a kiss between two female characters, which was named a \"breakthrough moment\" for video games.<ref name=\"Kotaku breakthrough\"/> He also co-wrote the four-issue comic book miniseries ''[[The Last of Us: American Dreams]]'', with writer and artist [[Faith Erin Hicks]]. It was published by [[Dark Horse Comics]], with the first issue released in April 2013,<ref name=\"TLOUAD\"/> and was lauded for Druckmann's writing and character development, as well as Hicks' simplistic illustrations.<ref name=\"TLOUAD BD\"/><ref name=\"TLOUAD IGN\"/>\n\nFollowing Hennig's departure from Naughty Dog in March 2014, it was announced that Druckmann and Straley were working on ''[[Uncharted 4: A Thief's End]]'' (2016) as creative director and game director respectively.<ref name=\"UC4\"/> Initial reports claimed that Hennig was \"forced out\" of Naughty Dog by Druckmann and Straley, though co-presidents Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra later denied this.<ref name=\"Hennig\"/> Druckmann co-wrote the story alongside Josh Scherr;<ref name=\"U4 Ending\"/> Druckmann considered Scherr the \"funny one\", allowing him to write the humour of ''Uncharted 4'' due to Druckmann's self-professed inability to write jokes. He appreciated the collaboration of writing on ''Uncharted 4'', having written ''The Last of Us'' almost entirely independently.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> The game was released on May 10, 2016 to and praised for its story.<ref name=\"U4 Roundup\"/> It was awarded Best Narrative at [[The Game Awards 2016]],<ref name=\"Game Awards\"/> and Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing at the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2016|69th Writers Guild of America Awards]].<ref name=\"WGAA17\"/> Druckmann acted as head of narrative development for ''[[Uncharted: The Lost Legacy]]'', released in August 2017.<ref name=\"UCLL\"/>\n\nIn March 2014, Sony announced that Druckmann was writing a film adaptation of ''The Last of Us'', produced by [[Sam Raimi]] and distributed by [[Screen Gems]].<ref name=\"IGN Movie\"/> By January 2015, he had written the script's second draft, and performed a [[read-through]] with some actors.<ref name=\"IGN Movie2\"/> Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered [[development hell]],<ref name=\"IGN Movie3\"/> and in February 2018 said \"I don't want that movie to be made.\"<ref name=\"DoG Movie\"/> Druckmann is currently co-writing a sequel to the first game, titled ''The Last of Us Part II'', alongside Halley Gross;<ref name=\"Gross\"/> Straley will not return to co-direct the game.<ref name=\"TLOU2 Straley\"/> Druckmann worked as a playtester for ''[[What Remains of Edith Finch]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"Edith Finch\"/> In August 2017, he was featured as a guest judge on an episode of ''[[Face Off (TV series)|Face Off]]''.<ref name=\"Face Off\"/> Druckmann was promoted to Vice President of Naughty Dog in March 2018.<ref name=\"VP\"/>\n\nDruckmann is acting as a writer and executive producer on a television adaptation of ''The Last of Us'' for [[HBO]], expected to cover events of this game and possibly some parts of its sequel.<ref name=\"TLOU HBO\"/>\n\n== Writing style ==\nDruckmann's writing philosophy, which he realized while talking to game designer [[Cory Barlog]], is \"simple story, complex characters\"; Druckmann dislikes video games with complicated exposition, but enjoys writing complex character relationships.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> Throughout his writing, Druckmann approaches scenes with focus on every character, attempting to enter the mindset of each one.
