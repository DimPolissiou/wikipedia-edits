In World War II, he distinguished himself as the commander of the [[7th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|7th Panzer Division]] during the [[Battle of France|1940 invasion of France]]. His leadership of German and Italian forces in the [[North African campaign]] established his reputation as one of the most able tank commanders of the war, and earned him the nickname ''der W\u00fcstenfuchs'', \"the Desert Fox\". Among his British adversaries he had a reputation for [[chivalry]], and his phrase \"war without hate\" has been used to describe the North African campaign.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bierman |first= John | last2= Smith| first2=Colin | author-link2 = Colin Smith (journalist) |year=2004 |title=War Without Hate: The Desert Campaign of 1940\u201343 |url= |location= |publisher=Penguin Books |page= |isbn= 978-0142003947 }}</ref> He later commanded the German forces opposing the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] cross-channel [[invasion of Normandy]] in June 1944.\n\nRommel supported the [[Nazi seizure of power]] and [[Adolf Hitler]], although his reluctant stance towards [[antisemitism]] and [[Nazi ideology]] and his level of knowledge of [[the Holocaust]] remain matters of debate among scholars.{{sfn|Remy|2002|pp=28, 355, 361}}{{sfn|Scheck|2010}}{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=18, 122, 139, 147}}{{sfn|Hart|2014|pp=128-52}}{{sfn|Von Fleischhauer|Friedmann|2012|}} In 1944, Rommel was [[#Plot against Hitler|implicated]] in the [[20 July plot]] to assassinate Hitler. Because of Rommel's status as a national hero, Hitler desired to eliminate him quietly instead of immediately executing him, as many other plotters were. Rommel was given a choice between committing [[suicide]], in return for assurances that his reputation would remain intact and that his family would not be persecuted following his death, or facing a trial that would result in his disgrace and execution; he chose the former and committed suicide using a [[cyanide pill]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/world/europe/manfred-rommel-son-of-german-field-marshal-dies-at-84.html|title=Manfred Rommel, Son of German Field Marshal, Dies at 84|first=Douglas|last=Martin|date=9 November 2013|publisher=|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> Rommel was given a state funeral, and it was announced that he had succumbed to his injuries from the strafing of his staff car in Normandy.\n\nRommel has become a larger-than-life figure in both Allied and [[Nazi propaganda]], and in postwar popular culture, with numerous authors considering him an apolitical, brilliant commander and a victim of the [[Third Reich]] although this assessment is contested by other authors as the [[Rommel myth]].

Several of Rommel's former subordinates, notably his chief of staff [[Hans Speidel]], played key roles in [[Wiederbewaffnung|German rearmament]] and integration into [[NATO]] in the postwar era.

He was the third of five children to Erwin Rommel Senior (1860\u20131913) and his wife Helene von Lutz, whose father, [[Karl von Luz]], headed the local government council. As a young man, Rommel's father had been an artillery lieutenant.

On 27 November the British attack on Tobruk linked up with the defenders, and Rommel, having suffered losses that could not easily be replaced, had to concentrate on regrouping the divisions that had attacked into Egypt. By 7 December Rommel fell back to a defensive line at Gazala, just west of Tobruk, all the while under heavy attack from the [[Desert Air Force]]. The Bardia garrison surrendered on 2 January and Halfaya on 17 January 1942.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|pp=291\u2013293}} The Allies kept up the pressure, and Rommel was forced to retreat all the way back to the starting positions he had held in March, reaching [[El Agheila]] in December 1941.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=304}} The British had retaken almost all of Cyrenaica, but Rommel's retreat dramatically shortened his supply lines.{{sfn|Douglas-Home|1973|p=131}}\n\n==== Battle of Gazala and capture of Tobruk ====\n\n{{Main|Battle of Gazala|Axis capture of Tobruk}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-785-0296-22A, Nordafrika, Rommel im Befehlsfahrzeug \"Greif\".jpg|thumb|left|North Africa, Rommel in a [[Sd.Kfz. 250]]/3]]\n\nOn 5 January 1942 the Afrika Korps received 55 tanks and new supplies and Rommel started planning a counterattack.

The Axis forces retook Benghazi on 29 January and [[Timimi]] on 3 February, with the Allies pulling back to a defensive line just before the Tobruk area south of the coastal town of Gazala. Rommel placed a thin screen of mobile forces before them, and held the main force of the Panzerarmee well back near Antela and Mersa Brega.{{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=106}} Between December 1941 and June 1942, Rommel had excellent information about the disposition and intentions of the Commonwealth forces.

He knew the British were planning offensive operations as well, and he hoped to pre-empt them.  While out on reconnaissance on 6 April, he was severely bruised in the abdomen when his vehicle was the target of artillery fire.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=319}} The British had 900 tanks in the area, 200 of which were new [[M3 Lee|Grant]] tanks. Unlike the British, the Axis forces had no armoured reserve; all operable equipment was put into immediate service. Rommel's [[Panzer Army Africa]] had a force of 320 German tanks; 50 of these were the light [[Panzer II]] model. In addition, 240 Italian tanks were in service, but these were under-gunned and poorly armoured.{{sfn|Rommel|1982|p=196}}\n\n[[File:Map of siege of Tobruk 1942.jpg|thumb|Situation in \"the Cauldron\", 27 May 1942]]\n\nEarly in the afternoon of 26 May 1942, Rommel attacked first and the [[Battle of Gazala]] commenced. Italian infantry supplemented with small numbers of armoured forces assaulted the centre of the Gazala fortifications. To give the impression that this was the main assault, spare aircraft engines mounted on trucks were used to create huge clouds of dust. Ritchie was not convinced by this display, and left the 4th and 22nd Armoured Brigades in position at the south end of the Commonwealth position.{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=323\u2013324}} Under the cover of darkness, the bulk of Rommel's motorized and armoured forces (15th and 21st Panzers, 90th Light Division, and the Italian Ariete and Trieste Divisions) drove south to skirt the left flank of the British, coming up behind them and attacking to the north the following morning.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=45}} Throughout the day a running armour battle occurred, where both sides took heavy losses. The Grant tanks proved to be impossible to knock out except at close range.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=326}}\n\nRenewing the attack on the morning of 28 May, Rommel concentrated on encircling and destroying separate units of the British armour. Repeated British counterattacks threatened to cut off and destroy the Afrika Korps. Running low on fuel, Rommel assumed a defensive posture, forming \"the Cauldron\". He made use of the extensive British minefields to shield his western flank. Meanwhile, Italian infantry cleared a path through the mines to provide supplies. On 30 May Rommel resumed the offensive, attacking westwards to link with elements of Italian X Corps, which had cleared a path through the Allied minefields to establish a supply line.{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=325\u2013327}} On 1 June, Rommel accepted the surrender of some 3,000 soldiers of the 150th Brigade.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=330}} On 6 June, 90th Light Division and the ''Trieste'' Division assaulted the Free French strongpoint in the [[Battle of Bir Hakeim]], but the defenders continued to thwart the attack until finally evacuating on 10 June.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=331}} With his communications and the southern strongpoint of the British line thus secured, Rommel shifted his attack north again, relying on the British minefields of the Gazala lines to protect his left flank.{{sfn|Rommel|1982|p=217}} Threatened with being completely cut off, the British began a retreat eastward toward Egypt on 14 June, the so-called \"Gazala Gallop\".{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=334}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-785-0293-11, Tobruk, Sch\u00fctzenpanzer, Panzer.jpg|thumb|left|The Afrika Korps enters Tobruk.]]\n\nOn 15 June Axis forces reached the coast, cutting off the escape for the Commonwealth forces still occupying the Gazala positions. With this task completed, Rommel struck for Tobruk while the enemy was still confused and disorganised.{{sfn|Rommel|1982|p=224}} Tobruk's defenders were at this point the 2nd South African Infantry Division, 4th Antiaircraft Brigade, 11th Indian Infantry, 32nd Army Tank, and 201st Guards Brigades, all under command of Major General [[Hendrik Klopper]]. The assault on Tobruk began at dawn on 20 June, and Klopper surrendered at dawn the following day.{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=334\u2013335}} With Tobruk, Rommel achieved the capture of 32,000 defenders, the port, and huge quantities of supplies.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=337}} Only at the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], earlier that year, had more [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] troops been captured at one time.

However, Hitler viewed the North African campaign primarily as a way to assist his Italian allies, not as an objective in and of itself. He would not consider sending Rommel the reinforcements and supplies he needed to take and hold Egypt, as this would have required diverting men and supplies from his primary focus: the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=911\u2013912}}\n\nRommel's success at Tobruk worked against him, as Hitler no longer felt it was necessary to proceed with [[Operation Herkules]], the proposed attack on Malta.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=342}} Auchinleck relieved Ritchie of command of the Eighth Army on 25 June, and temporarily took command himself.{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=339, 343}} Rommel knew that delay would only benefit the British, who continued to receive supplies at a faster rate than Rommel could hope to achieve.

On 1 July the [[First Battle of El Alamein]] began. Rommel had around 100 available tanks. The Allies were able to achieve local air superiority, with heavy bombers attacking the 15th and 21st Panzers, who had also been delayed by a sandstorm. The 90th Light Division veered off course and were pinned down by South African artillery fire.

The terrain left Rommel with no choice but to follow a similar tactic as he had at previous battles: the bulk of the forces attempted to sweep around from the south while secondary attacks were launched on the remainder of the front. It took much longer than anticipated to get through the minefields in the southern sector, and the tanks got bogged down in unexpected patches of quicksand (Montgomery had arranged for Rommel to acquire a falsified map of the terrain).{{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=48}}{{sfn|Douglas-Home|1973|p=165}} Under heavy fire from British artillery and aircraft, and in the face of well prepared positions that Rommel could not hope to outflank due to lack of fuel, the attack stalled.

Montgomery called off further action to preserve his strength and allow for further desert training for his forces.{{sfn|Carver|1962|p=70}} In the attack Rommel had suffered 2,940 casualties and lost 50 tanks, a similar number of guns, and 400 lorries, vital for supplies and movement. The British losses, except tank losses of 68, were much less, further adding to the numerical inferiority of Panzer Army Afrika. The Desert Air Force inflicted the highest proportions of damage on Rommel's forces.

By the end of 25 October, the 15th Panzer, the defenders in this sector, had only 31 serviceable tanks remaining of their initial force of 119.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=373}} Rommel brought the 21st Panzer and Ariete Divisions north on 26 October, to bolster the sector. On 28 October, Montgomery shifted his focus to the coast, ordering his 1st and 10th Armoured Divisions to attempt to swing around and cut off Rommel's line of retreat. Meanwhile, Rommel concentrated his attack on the Allied [[Salient (military)|salient]] at Kidney Ridge, inflicting heavy losses. However, Rommel had only 150 operational tanks remaining, and Montgomery had 800, many of them [[M4 Sherman|Shermans]].{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=378\u2013380}}\n\nMontgomery, seeing his armoured brigades losing tanks at an alarming rate, stopped major attacks until the early hours of 2 November, when he opened Operation Supercharge, with a massive artillery barrage.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=378}} This was followed by penetration at the salient by two armoured and two infantry divisions.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=385}} Rommel's counterattack at 11:00 inflicted severe casualties on the Commonwealth troops, but by 20:00, with only 35 tanks remaining, he ordered his forces to disengage and begin to withdraw.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|pp=379\u2013380}} At midnight, he informed the OKW of his decision, and received a reply directly from Hitler the following afternoon: he ordered Rommel and his troops to hold their position to the last man.

Heavy rains slowed movements and grounded the Desert Air Force, which aided the withdrawal. According to Kourt von Esebeck, those German parts of Panzerarmee Africa that were motorized slipped away from El Alamein, all vehicles had been taken away from Italian forces, leaving them behind,<ref>Kourt von Esebeck, Rommel, Damianos publishing, Athens,1966, page 151</ref> but were under pressure from the pursuing Eighth Army. According to officers of the Italian X Corps, they were not deliberately abandoned and an effort to save all divisions would only have led to destruction of more units.{{sfn|Scianna|2018|pp=135}} A series of short delaying actions was fought over the coastal highway, but no line could be held for any length of time, as Rommel lacked the armour and fuel to defend his open southern flank.{{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=190}} Rommel continued to retreat west, abandoning Halfaya Pass, Sollum, Mersa Brega and El Agheila.{{sfn|Coggins|1980|p=11}} The line Rommel was aiming for was 'Gabes gap' in Tunisia.{{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=192}} Luftwaffe Field Marshal Kesselring strongly criticized Rommel's decision to retreat all the way to Tunisia, as each airfield the Germans abandoned extended the range of the Allied bombers and fighters. Rommel defended his decision, pointing out that if he tried to assume a defensive position the Allies would destroy his forces and take the airfields anyway; the retreat saved the lives of his remaining men and shortened his supply lines. By now, Rommel's remaining forces fought in reduced strength combat groups, whereas the Allied forces had great numerical superiority and control of the air. Upon his arrival in [[Tunisia]], Rommel noted with some bitterness the reinforcements, including the 10th Panzer Division, arriving in Tunisia following the Allied invasion of Morocco.{{sfn|Rommel|1982|pp=342\u2013357}}\n\n===== Tunisia =====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1990-071-31, Nordafrika, Rommel, Bayerlein.jpg|thumb|left|Rommel speaks with troops who are using a captured American M3 half-track, Tunisia.]]\n\nHaving reached Tunisia, Rommel launched an attack against the [[U.S. II Corps]] which was threatening to cut his lines of supply north to Tunis. Rommel inflicted a sharp defeat on the American forces at the [[Battle of the Kasserine Pass|Kasserine Pass]] in February, his last battlefield victory of the war, and his first engagement against the United States Army.{{sfn|Coggins|1980|p=129}}\n\nRommel immediately turned back against the British forces, occupying the [[Mareth Line]] (old French defences on the Libyan border). While Rommel was at Kasserine at the end of January 1943, the Italian General [[Giovanni Messe]] was appointed commander of Panzer Army Africa, renamed the Italo-German Panzer Army in recognition of the fact that it consisted of one German and three Italian corps. Though Messe replaced Rommel, he diplomatically deferred to him, and the two coexisted in what was theoretically the same command. On 23 February ''Armeegruppe Afrika'' was created with Rommel in command. It included the Italo-German Panzer Army under Messe (renamed 1st Italian Army) and the German 5th Panzer Army in the north of Tunisia under General [[Hans-J\u00fcrgen von Arnim]].\n\nThe last Rommel offensive in North Africa was on 6 March 1943, when he attacked Eighth Army at the [[Battle of Medenine]].{{sfn|Coggins|1980|p=134}} The attack was made with [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th]], [[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th]], and [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st]] Panzer Divisions. Alerted by [[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]] intercepts, Montgomery deployed large numbers of anti-tank guns in the path of the offensive. After losing 52 tanks, Rommel called off the assault.{{sfn|Coggins|1980|p=135}} On 9 March he returned to Germany.{{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=209}} Command was handed over to General Hans-J\u00fcrgen von Arnim. Rommel never returned to Africa.{{sfn|Coggins|1980|p=136}} The fighting there continued on for another two months, until 13 May 1943, when General Messe surrendered the ''Armeegruppe Afrika'' to the Allies.\n\n=== Italy 1943 ===\nOn 23 July 1943 Rommel was moved to [[Greece]] as commander of [[Army Group E]] to counter a possible British invasion. He arrived in Greece on 25 July, but was recalled to Berlin the same day due to the overthrow of Mussolini. Rommel was to be posted to Italy as commander of the newly formed [[Army Group B]]. On 16 August 1943 Rommel's headquarters moved to [[Lake Garda]] in northern Italy and formally assumed command of the army group, which consisted of the [[44th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|44th Infantry Division]], the [[26th Panzer Division]] and the [[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler]]. When Italy announced its armistice with the Allies on 8 September, his forces took part in [[Operation Achse]], disarming the Italian forces.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|pp=115\u2013116}}\n\nHitler met with Rommel and Kesselring to discuss future operations in Italy on 30 September 1943. Rommel insisted on a defensive line north of Rome, while Kesselring was more optimistic and advocated holding a line south of Rome. Hitler preferred Kesselring's recommendation, and therefore revoked his previous decision for the subordination of Kesselring's forces to Rommel's army group. On 19 October Hitler decided that Kesselring would be the overall commander of the forces in Italy, sidelining Rommel.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|p=117}}\n\nRommel had wrongly predicted that the collapse of the German line in Italy would be fast. On 21 November Hitler gave Kesselring overall command of the Italian theater, moving Rommel and Army Group B to [[Normandy]] in France with responsibility for defending the French coast against the long anticipated Allied invasion.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=117}}\n\n=== Atlantic Wall 1944 ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-300-1863-29, Riva-Bella, Waffenvorf\u00fchrung Panzerwerfer, Rommel.jpg|thumb|right|Rommel observes the fall of shot at Riva-Bella, just north of Caen in the area that would become [[Sword Beach]] in Normandy.]]\nOn 4 November 1943, Rommel became General Inspector of the Western Defences. He was given a staff that befitted an army group commander, and the powers to travel, examine and make suggestions on how to improve the defences, but not a single soldier. Hitler, who was having a disagreement with him over military matters, intended to use Rommel as a psychological trump card.{{sfn|Remy|2002|p=215}}\n\nThere was broad disagreement in the German High Command as to how best to meet the expected allied invasion of Northern France. The Commander-in-Chief West, Gerd von Rundstedt, believed there was no way to stop the invasion near the beaches due to the firepower possessed by the Allied navies, as had been experienced at [[Allied invasion of Italy#German counterattacks|Salerno]].{{sfn|Willmott|1984|p=69}} He argued that the German armour should be held in reserve well inland near [[Paris]], where they could be used to counter-attack in force in a more traditional military doctrine. The allies could be allowed to extend themselves deep into France, where a battle for control would be fought, allowing the Germans to envelop the allied forces in a pincer movement, cutting off their avenue of retreat. He feared the piecemeal commitment of their armoured forces would cause them to become caught in a battle of attrition which they could not hope to win.{{sfn|Willmott|1984|p=69}}\n\n<!---[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J16796, Rommel mit Soldaten der Legion \"Freies Indien\".jpg|thumb|Inspecting the [[Indische Legion|Free India Legion]], France, 1944]]--->\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-719-0240-35, Pas de Calais, Atlantikwall, Luftlandehindernisse.jpg|thumb|left| A sketch by Rommel.

These tactics were still effective on the Eastern Front, where control of the air was important but did not dominate the action. Rommel's own experiences at the end of the North African campaign revealed to him that the Germans would not be allowed to preserve their armour from air attack for this type of massed assault.{{sfn|Willmott|1984|p=69}} Rommel believed their only opportunity would be to oppose the landings directly at the beaches, and to counterattack there before the invaders could become well established. Though there had been some defensive positions established and gun emplacements made, the [[Atlantic Wall]] was a token defensive line. Rundstedt had confided to Rommel that it was for propaganda purposes only.{{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=213}}\n\nUpon arriving in Northern France Rommel was dismayed by the lack of completed works. According to [[Friedrich Ruge|Ruge]], Rommel was in a staff position and could not issue orders, but he took every effort to explain his plan to commanders down to the platoon level, who took up his words eagerly, but \"more or less open\" opposition from the above slowed down the process.<ref name=\"Ruge160415\"/> Finally, Rundstedt, who only respected Rommel grudgingly (he called him Field Marshal Cub),{{sfn|Mitcham|1997|pp=15, 23}}{{sfn|Messenger|2009|p=166}} intervened and supported Rommel's request for being made a commander.{{sfn|Brighton|2008|p=247}} It was granted in 15 January 1944, when \"much valuable time had been lost.\"<ref name=\"Ruge160415\">{{cite web|last1=Ruge|last2=Dihm|first1=Friedrich|first2=Friedrich|title=Rommel and the Atlantic Wall December 1943 - July 1944 Oral History - World War II - Invasion of Normandy (1944)|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/r/rommel-atlantic-wall.html#352|website=Naval History and Heritage Command (US)|date=16 April 2015|accessdate=16 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe set out to improve the fortifications along the [[Atlantic Wall]] with great energy and engineering skill.{{refn|Lieb: Of course, Rommel did not conceive all these devices himself&nbsp;...

This was a compromise: Rommel now commanded the 7th and 15th armies; he also had authority over a 20-kilometer-wide strip of coastal land between [[Zuiderzee]] and the mouth of the Loire. The chain of command was convoluted: the airforce and navy had their own chiefs, as did the South and Southwest France and the Panzer group; Rommel also needed Hitler's permissions to use the tank divisions.{{sfn|Remy|2002|p=219}} Undeterred, Rommel had millions of mines laid and thousands of tank traps and obstacles set up on the beaches and throughout the countryside, including in fields suitable for glider aircraft landings, the so-called [[Rommel's asparagus]].{{sfn|Lieb|2014|p=121}}(The Allies would later counter these with [[Hobart's Funnies]]){{sfn|Rice|2009|p=90}} In April 1944 Rommel promised Hitler that the preparations would be complete by 1 May, but by the time of the Allied invasion the preparations were far from finished.

In late April, he ordered the [[I SS Panzer Corps]] placed near Paris, far enough inland to be useless to Rommel, but not far enough for Rundstedt. Rommel moved those armoured formations under his command as far forward as possible, ordering General [[Erich Marcks]], commanding the 84th Corps defending the Normandy section, to move his reserves into the frontline. Although Rommel was the dominating personality in Normandy with Rundstedt willing to delegate most of the responsibilities to him (the central reserve was Rundstedt's idea but he did not oppose to some form of coastal defense, and gradually came under the influence of Rommel's thinking), Rommel's strategy of an armor-supported coastal defense line was opposed by some officers, most notably [[Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg]], who was supported by Guderian.{{sfn|Cad\u0111ick-Adams|2013|p=221}}{{sfn|Willmott|1984|p=69}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Gordon|title=US Army in WW II: European Theater of Operations, Cross Channel Attack|date=1951|isbn=978-0-7948-3739-6|page=247|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSAW3D9GIHQC&pg=PA247}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Andrew|title=D-Day To Berlin|date=2004|isbn=978-0-340-83397-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSAW3D9GIHQC&pg=PA247}}</ref>{{sfn|Brighton|2008|p=247}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Keegan|first1=John|title=The Book of War: 25 Centuries of Great War Writing -On the Other Side of the Hill|date=1999|isbn=978-0-14-029655-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4c6n8T9rNeMC&pg=PT359}}</ref> Hitler compromised and gave Rommel three divisions (the 2nd, the 21st and the 116th Panzer), let Rundstedt retain four and turned the other three to Army Group G, pleasing no one.{{sfn|Mitcham|1997|p=198}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=Joshua|title=Operation Fortitude: The Story of the Spies and the Spy Operation That Saved D-Day|date=22 November 2011|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7627-7735-8|pages=7\u20139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQWiCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA8}}</ref>\n\nThe Allies staged elaborate deceptions for [[D-Day]] (see [[Operation Fortitude]]), giving the impression that the landings would be at Calais. Although Hitler himself expected a Normandy invasion for a while, Rommel and most Army commanders in France believed there would be two invasions, with the main invasion coming at the Pas-de-Calais. Rommel drove defensive preparations all along the coast of Northern France, particularly concentrating fortification building in the [[River Somme]] estuary. By D-Day on 6 June 1944 nearly all the German staff officers, including Hitler's staff, believed that Pas-de-Calais was going to be the main invasion site, and continued to believe so even after the landings in Normandy had occurred.{{sfn|Willmott|1984|p=89}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-718-0149-12A, Paris, Rommel, von Rundstedt, Gause und Zimmermann.jpg|thumb|left|Generalfeldmarsch\u00e4lle [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] and Erwin Rommel meeting in Paris]]\n\nThe 5 June storm in the channel seemed to make a landing very unlikely, and a number of the senior officers were away from their units for training exercises and various other efforts. On 4 June the chief meteorologist of the 3 Air Fleet reported that weather in the channel was so poor there could be no landing attempted for two weeks. On 5 June Rommel left France and on 6 June he was at home celebrating his wife's birthday.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|p=121}} He was recalled and returned to his headquarters at 10{{nbsp}}pm. Meanwhile, earlier in the day, Rundstedt had requested the reserves be transferred to his command. At 10{{nbsp}}am Keitel advised that Hitler declined to release the reserves but that Rundstedt could move the [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend]] closer to the coast, with the [[Panzer-Lehr-Division]] placed on standby. Later in the day, Rundstedt received authorisation to move additional units in preparation for a counterattack, which Rundstedt decided to launch on 7 June. Upon arrival, Rommel concurred with the plan. By nightfall, Rundstedt, Rommel and Speidel continued to believe that the Normandy landing might have been a diversionary attack, as the Allied deception measures still pointed towards Calais.

Rommel believed that if his armies pulled out of range of Allied naval fire, it would give them a chance to regroup and re-engage them later with a better chance of success.

In the autumn of 1941 and early winter of 1941/1942, he was mentioned in the British press almost daily. Toward the end of the year, the Reich propaganda machine also used Rommel's successes in Africa as a diversion from the Wehrmacht's challenging situation in the Soviet Union with the stall of [[Operation Barbarossa]].{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=136\u2013139}}{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2012|p=471}}{{refn|group=N|[[Peter Caddick-Adams]]: \"Rommel's advances over the winter 1941\u201342 became a very useful distraction away from Germany's failure before Moscow.\"{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2012|p=471}}}} The American press soon began to take notice of Rommel as well, following the country's entry into the war on 11 December 1941, writing that \"The British (...) admire him because he beat them and were surprised to have beaten in turn such a capable general.\" General Auchinleck distributed a directive to his commanders seeking to dispel the notion that Rommel was a \"superman\".{{sfn|Watson|1999|pp=166\u2013167}}{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=141\u2013143}} Rommel, no matter how hard the situation was, made a deliberate effort at always spending some time with soldiers and patients, his own and POWs alike, which contributed greatly to his reputation of not only being a great commander but also \"a decent chap\" among the troops.<ref name=\"Auchinleck: The Lonely Soldier\"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Majdalany|first1=Fred|title=The Battle of El Alamein: Fortress in the Sand|date=2003|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-1850-3|pages=31\u201332|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9JDXgTOgEgC&pg=PA31}}</ref>\n\nThe attention of the Western and especially the British press thrilled Goebbels, who wrote in his diary in early 1942: \"Rommel continues to be the recognized darling of even the enemies' news agencies.\"{{sfn|Reuth|2005|p=144}} The Field Marshal was pleased by the media attention, although he knew the downsides of having a reputation.{{sfn|Reuth|2005|p=144}}{{refn|group=N|Quote from one of Rommel's letters, January 1942: \"The opinion of me in the world press has improved.\"{{sfn|Reuth|2005|p=144}}}}{{sfn|Zaloga|2013|p=24}} Hitler took note of the British propaganda as well, commenting in the summer of 1942 that Britain's leaders must have hoped \"to be able to explain their defeat to their own nation more easily by focusing on Rommel\".{{sfn|Reuth|2005|p=148}}\n\nThe Field Marshal was the German commander most frequently covered in the German media, and the only one to be given a press conference, which took place in October 1942.{{sfn|Citino|2012}}{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=144\u2013146}} The press conference was moderated by Goebbels and was attended by both domestic and foreign media. Rommel declared: \"Today we (...) have the gates of Egypt in hand, and with the intent to act!\" Keeping the focus on Rommel distracted the German public from Wehrmacht losses elsewhere as the tide of the war began to turn. He became a symbol that was used to reinforce the German public's faith in an ultimate Axis victory.{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=150\u2013152}}\n\n===Military reverses===\n\nIn the wake of the successful British offensive in November 1942 and other military reverses, the Propaganda Ministry directed the media to emphasize Rommel's invincibility. The charade was maintained until the spring of 1943, even as the German situation in Africa became increasingly precarious. To ensure that the inevitable defeat in Africa would not be associated with Rommel's name, Goebbels had the [[OKH|Supreme High Command]] announce in May 1943 that Rommel was on a two-month leave for health reasons.{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=154\u2013158}}{{refn|group=N|[[Peter Lieb]]: \"Hitler was well aware that it would be unwise (...) to link the downfall of Army Group Africa to the name of Rommel, the child of Joseph Goebbel's propaganda machinery.\"{{sfn|Lieb|2014|p=113}}}} Instead, the campaign was presented by Berndt, who resumed his role in the Propaganda Ministry, as a ruse to tie down the British Empire while Germany was turning Europe into an impenetrable fortress with Rommel at the helm of this success. After the radio program ran in May 1943, Rommel sent Berndt a case of cigars as a sign of his gratitude.{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=154\u2013158}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-719-0243-33, Atlantikwall, Inspektion Erwin Rommel mit Offizieren.jpg|thumb|right|One of the many propaganda photographs of Rommel on inspection tours of the [[Atlantic wall]]]]\nAlthough Rommel then entered a period without a significant command, he remained a household name in Germany, synonymous with the aura of invincibility.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|pp=113\u2013115, 117\u2013118}} Hitler then made Rommel part of his defensive strategy for [[Fortress Europe]] (''Festung Europa'') by sending him to the West to inspect fortifications along the [[Atlantic Wall]]. Goebbels supported the decision, noting in his diary that Rommel was \"undoubtedly the suitable man\" for the task. The propaganda minister expected the move to reassure the German public and at the same time to have a negative impact on the Allied forces' morale.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nIn France, a Wehrmacht propaganda company frequently accompanied Rommel on his inspection trips to document his work for both domestic and foreign audiences.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|p=120}}{{sfn|Reuth|2005|p=159}} In May 1944 the German newsreels reported on Rommel's speech at a Wehrmacht conference, where he stated his conviction that \"every single German soldier will make his contribution against the Anglo-American spirit that it deserves for its criminal and bestial air war campaign against our homeland.\" The speech led to an upswing in morale and sustained confidence in Rommel.{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=159\u2013161}}\n\nWhen Rommel was seriously wounded on 17 July 1944, the Propaganda Ministry undertook efforts to conceal the injury so as not to undermine domestic morale. Despite those, the news leaked to the British press. To counteract the rumors of a serious injury and even death, Rommel was required to appear at the 1 August press conference. On 3 August, the German press published an official report that Rommel had been injured in a car accident. Rommel noted in his diary his dismay at this twisting of the truth, belatedly realising how much the Reich propaganda was using him for its own ends.{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=159\u2013161}}\n\n===Rommel's views on propaganda===\n\nRommel was interested in propaganda beyond the promotion of his own image. In 1944, after visiting Rommel in France and reading his proposals on counteracting Allied propaganda, Alfred-Ingemar Berndt remarked: \"He is also interested in this propaganda business and wants to develop it by all means. He has even thought and brought out practical suggestions for each program and subject.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fischer|first1=Thomas|title=Propaganda-Star Ein Mythos entsteht|url=http://www.swr.de/rommel/propaganda-start/ein-mythos-entsteht/-/id=10224974/did=10224880/nid=10224974/ktgj7v/index.html|accessdate= 2016-08-04 |date=2 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nRommel saw the propaganda and education values in his and his nation's deeds (He also did value justice itself: According to Admiral Ruge's diary, Rommel told Ruge: \"Justice is the indispensable foundation of a nation. Unfortunately, the higher-ups are not clean. The slaughterings are grave sins.\"{{sfn|Remy|2002|p=247}}) The key to the successful creating of an image, according to Rommel, was leading by example: \"The men tend to feel no kind of contact with a commander who, they know, is sitting somewhere in headquarters.

When Rommel came to North Africa, it was picked up and disseminated in the West by the British press as the Allies sought to explain their continued inability to defeat the Axis forces in North Africa.{{sfn|Major|2008}} The British military and political figures contributed to the heroic image of the man as Rommel resumed offensive operations in January 1942 against the British forces weakened by redeployments to the Far East. During parliamentary debate following the fall of Tobruk, Churchill described Rommel as an \"extraordinary bold and clever opponent\" and a \"great field commander\".{{sfn|Watson|1999|pp=166\u2013167}}{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=141\u2013143}}\n\nAccording to ''Der Spiegel'' following the war's end, West Germany yearned for father figures who were needed to replace the former ones who had been unmasked as criminals. Rommel was chosen because he embodied the decent soldier, cunning yet fair-minded, and if guilty by association, not so guilty that he became unreliable, and additionally, former comrades reported that he was close to the Resistance.{{sfn|Von Fleischhauer|Friedmann|2012|}} While everyone else was disgraced, his star became brighter than ever, and he made the historically unprecedented leap over the threshold between eras: from Hitler's favourite general to the young republic's hero. Cornelia Hecht notes that despite the change of times, Rommel has become the symbol of different regimes and concepts, which is paradoxical, whoever the man he really was.{{r|Welt180808}}<ref>{{cite book |editor-last1=Hecht|editor-first1=Cornelia |last1=H\u00e4ussler |first1=Johannes |last2=Linder |first2=Rainer |date=2008 |title=Mythos Rommel |publisher=Haus der Geschichte Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg |isbn=978-3-933726-28-5 |pp=9\u201311 }}</ref> Ulrich vom Hagen reports that Rommel, for the admiration shown towards him by all sides after the war, was used as a unity symbol that led to the \"elegant settlement\" of the conflict between fascistic, small-bourgeois elements and the aristocratic traditionalists during the early years after the formation of the Bundeswehr.<ref>{{cite book|last=vom Hagen|first=Ulrich|title=Homo militaris: Perspektiven einer kritischen Milit\u00e4rsoziologie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5rTWBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA184|publisher=transcript Verlag (transcript)|year=2014|isbn=978-3-8394-1937-3|pp=183\u2013184}}</ref> Simon Ball describes how various elements in the German and British armies and governments extensively used Rommel's image in dealing with their inner struggles, promoting aspects of his that each group associated with themselves. [[Eric Dorman-Smith]] claimed that it was a \"pity we could not have combined with Rommel to clean up the whole mess on both sides\".{{sfn|Ball|2016|pp=92, 102\u2013104}} Already in September 1944, the officer Heinz Eugen Eberbach (later a leading figure in the Bundeswehr) anticipated that the Allied victors would have to turn to Rommel and men like him, because he was accepted by both the old regime and the working class, whom the English would not be able to win over by telling them: \"The entire previous system is rotten to the core\".{{sfn|Neitzel|2007|p=105}}\n\nAt the same time, the Western Allies, and particularly the British, depicted Rommel as the \"good German\". His reputation for conducting a clean war was used in the interest of the [[Wiederbewaffnung|West German rearmament]] and reconciliation between the former enemies\u2014Britain and the United States on one side and the new Federal Republic of Germany on the other.{{sfn|Searle|2014|p=9}} When Rommel's alleged involvement in the plot to kill Hitler became known after the war, his stature was enhanced in the eyes of his former adversaries. Rommel was often cited in Western sources as a patriotic German willing to stand up to Hitler. Churchill wrote about him in 1950: \"[Rommel] (...) deserves our respect because, although a loyal German soldier, he came to hate Hitler and all his works and took part in the conspiracy of 1944 to rescue Germany by displacing the maniac and tyrant.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1950|p=200}}\n\n===Foundational works===\nThe German rearmament of the early 1950s was highly dependent on the moral rehabilitation that the Wehrmacht needed. The journalist and historian [[Basil Liddell Hart]], an early proponent of these two interconnected initiatives, provided the first widely available source on Rommel in his 1948 book on Hitler's generals, updated in 1951, portraying Rommel in a positive light and as someone who stood apart from the regime.{{sfn|Searle|2014|pp=8, 27}}\n\nThe other foundational text was the influential and laudatory 1950 biography ''[[Rommel: The Desert Fox]]'' by Brigadier Desmond Young.{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2012|p=478}}{{sfn|Beckett|2014|loc=I.F.W.

Speidel contributed as well, starting from the early 1950s to bring up Rommel's and his own role in the plot, boosting his [Speidel's] suitability for a future role in the new military force of the Federal Republic, the [[Bundeswehr]], and then in [[NATO]].{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2012|p=474}}\n\nFurther in 1953 was the publication of Rommel's writings of the war period as ''The Rommel Papers,'' edited by Liddell Hart.{{sfn|Connelly|2014|p=163}} The book contributed to the perception of Rommel as a brilliant commander; in an introduction, Liddell Hart drew comparisons between Rommel and [[Lawrence of Arabia]], \"two masters of desert warfare\".{{sfn|Major|2008|p=526}} Liddell Hart had a personal interest in the work: by having coaxed Rommel's widow to include material favorable to himself, he could present Rommel as his \"pupil\". The controversy was described by the political scientist [[John Mearsheimer]], who concluded that, by \"manipulating history\", Liddell Hart was in a position to show that he was at the root of the dramatic German success in 1940.{{sfn|Mearsheimer|1988|pp=199\u2013200}}{{sfn|Luvaas|1990|pp=12\u201313}}\n\n===Elements of the myth===\n[[File:Rommel's Africa uniform.jpg|thumb|upright|Allegedly Rommel's desert uniform and [[death mask]] (right) displayed at the [[German Tank Museum]] in [[Munster, Lower Saxony|Munster]]]]\nAccording to Mark Connelly, Young and Liddell Hart laid the foundation for the Anglo-American myth, which consisted of three themes: Rommel's ambivalence towards Nazism; his military genius; and the emphasis of the chivalrous nature of the fighting in North Africa.{{sfn|Connelly|2014|p=163}} Their works lent support to the image of the \"[[clean Wehrmacht]]\" and were generally not questioned, since they came from British authors, rather than German revisionists.{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2012|p=483}}{{refn|group=N|Kitchen: \"The North African campaign has usually been seen, as in the title of Rommel's account, as 'War without Hate,' and thus as further proof that the German army was not involved in any sordid butchering, which was left to Himmler's SS.

According to Watson, the most dominant element is Rommel the Superior Soldier; the second being Rommel the Common Man; and the last one Rommel the Martyr.{{sfn|Watson|1999|pp=157\u2013161}} The German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' described the myth in 2007 as \"Gentleman warrior, military genius\".{{sfn|Friedmann|2007}}{{refn|group=N|[[Spiegel Online]]: \"Gentleman warrior, military genius.

According to the prominent German historian [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], the modern consensus agrees with post-war sources that Rommel treated the Allied captives decently, and he personally thinks that the movie ''[[Rommel (film)|Rommel]]'' does not overstate his conscience.  Also according to Wehler, scholars in England and the US still show a lot of admiration towards Rommel the military commander.{{r|FrankAllg112012}} Some authors, notably Wolfgang Proske, see Rommel as a criminal whose memorials should be removed, although these represent the unorthodox minority (which is admitted by Proske).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kanold|first1=J\u00fcrgen|title=Denkmal des Ansto\u00dfes|url=http://www.swp.de/ulm/lokales/ulm_neu_ulm/Denkmal-des-Anstosses;art4329,1355468 |accessdate= 2016-08-04 |date=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Paterson|first1=Tony|title=Was the Desert Fox an honest soldier or just another Nazi?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/was-the-desert-fox-an-honest-soldier-or-just-another-nazi-6272076.html|agency=www.independent.co.uk/|date=2011}}</ref> Perry and Massari note that the majority of historians continue to describe Rommel as a brilliant, chivalrous commander.{{sfn|Perry|2012|p=165}}<ref name=Massari>{{cite book|last1=Massari|first1=Ivano|title=Erwin Rommel \u2013 Desert Fox \u2013 The Bold and the Brave|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdYTAAAAQBAJ&dq=rommel+chivalrous+montgomery|website=warhistoryonline|accessdate=12 October 2016|isbn=9781447235538|date=11 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nModern historians who agree with the image of the apolitical, chivalrous genius{{sfn|Knopp|2013|p=54}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fredriksen|first1=John C.|title=America's Military Adversaries: From Colonial Times to the Present|date=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-603-3|page=435|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJlm7AQK-T4C&pg=PA435}}</ref>{{sfn|Strawson|2014|p=124}}<ref name=Massari/>{{sfn|Wistrich|2001|p=107}}{{sfn|Holmes|2009|p=129}}{{sfn|Bradford|2011|pp=66, 183}}{{sfn|Sadler|2016|p=63}} also have different opinions regarding details.

Instead, --> Rommel was a \"complicated man of many contradictions,\"{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2012|pp=485\u2013486}} while Beckett notes that \"Rommel's myth (...) has proved remarkably resilient\" and that more work is needed to put him in proper historical context.{{sfn|Beckett|2014|p=6}} Watson opines that historians often portray Rommel as someone they want him to be, \"coward&nbsp;... hero, fool, villain or hypocrite,\" and that he seemed to be all of these things, except coward, with perhaps a naive loyalty.{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=122}} Hansen counters that Rommel was hardly naive, always judged military and political situations with cold objectivity, and shared a lot of characteristics with Hitler,{{sfn|Hansen|2014|pp=48, 69, 71, 354}} an opinion shared by psychoanalyst and historian Geoffrey Cocks who writes that Rommel \"embodies the modern synergy of technical expertise and self-promotion&nbsp;... arriviste,&nbsp;... professionally ambitious, adept at cultivating a mass media image&nbsp;... like Hitler\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cocks|first1=Geoffrey|title=The State of Health: Illness in Nazi Germany|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-969567-6|page=206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DMUDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206}}</ref>\n\nThere is also, especially in Germany, an increasing tendency to portray Rommel as someone who cannot be explained in concrete details yet.

This ideal of modern knighthood is connected and combined with the anachronistic [[Miles Christianus]] model, the more recent \"Miles Protector\" model,{{sfn|D\u00e4niker|2002|p=117}} the \"Soldier-Statesman\" concept, and the traditional monofunctional combatant.{{sfn|vom Hagen|2014|pp=183\u2013184}}\n\nCertain modern military historians, such as Larry T. Addington, Niall Barr, [[Douglas Porch]] and [[Robert Citino]], are skeptical of Rommel as an operational, let alone strategic level commander. They point to Rommel's lack of appreciation for Germany's strategic situation, his misunderstanding of the relative importance of his theatre to the German High Command, his poor grasp of logistical realities, and, according to the historian Ian Beckett, his \"penchant for glory hunting\".{{sfn|Beckett|2014|loc=I.F.W.

Compounding the problem was the Wehrmacht's institutional tendency to discount logistics, industrial output and their opponents' capacity to learn from past mistakes.{{sfn|Porch|2004|p=206}}\n\nThe historian [[Geoffrey P. Megargee]] points out Rommel's playing the German and Italian command structures against each other to his advantage. Rommel used the confused structure (the OKW ([[OKW|Supreme Command of the Wehrmacht]]), the OKH ([[OKH|Supreme High Command of the Army]]) and the Italian Supreme Command) to disregard orders that he disagreed with or to appeal to whatever authority he felt would be most sympathetic to his requests.{{sfn|Megargee|2000|p=97}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-263-1598-04, Frankreich, Rommel, \"Indische Legion\".jpg|thumb|Inspecting the soldiers of the anti-British [[Indische Legion|Free India Legion]], France, 1944]]\nSome historians take issue with Rommel's absence from Normandy on the day of the Allied invasion, 6 June 1944.

Storbeck, Deputy Inspector General of the Bundeswehr (1987\u20131991), remarks that, Rommel's leadership style and offensive thinking, although carrying inherent risks like losing the overview of the situation and creating overlapping of authority, have been proved effective, and have been analysed and incorporated in the training of officers by \"us, our Western allies, the Warsaw Pact, and even the Israel Defense Forces\".{{r|Storbeck041213}} Maurice Remy and [[Samuel W.

1891&nbsp;\u2013 14 October 1944) was a German general and military theorist. Popularly known as the '''Desert Fox''', he served as [[field marshal]] in the [[Wehrmacht]] (Defense Force) of [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]], as well as serving in the [[Reichswehr]] of the [[Weimar Republic]], and the army of [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]].\n\nRommel was a highly decorated officer in World War I and was awarded the ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]'' for his actions on the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]]. In 1937 he published his classic book on military tactics, ''[[Infantry Attacks]]'', drawing on his experiences in that war. In World War II, he distinguished himself as the commander of the [[7th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|7th Panzer Division]] during the [[Battle of France|1940 invasion of France]]. His leadership of German and Italian forces in the [[North African campaign]] established his reputation as one of the most able tank commanders of the war, and earned him the nickname ''der W\u00fcstenfuchs'', \"the Desert Fox\". Among his British adversaries he had a reputation for [[chivalry]], and his phrase \"war without hate\" has been used to describe the North African campaign.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bierman |first= John | last2= Smith| first2=Colin | author-link2 = Colin Smith (journalist) |year=2004 |title=War Without Hate: The Desert Campaign of 1940\u201343 |url= |location= |publisher=Penguin Books |page= |isbn= 978-0142003947 }}</ref> He later commanded the German forces opposing the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] cross-channel [[invasion of Normandy]] in June 1944.\n\nRommel supported the [[Nazi seizure of power]] and [[Adolf Hitler]], although his reluctant stance towards [[antisemitism]] and [[Nazi ideology]] and his level of knowledge of [[the Holocaust]] remain matters of debate among scholars.{{sfn|Remy|2002|pp=28, 355, 361}}{{sfn|Scheck|2010}}{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=18, 122, 139, 147}}{{sfn|Hart|2014|pp=128-52}}{{sfn|Von Fleischhauer|Friedmann|2012|}} In 1944, Rommel was [[#Plot against Hitler|implicated]] in the [[20 July plot]] to assassinate Hitler. Because of Rommel's status as a national hero, Hitler desired to eliminate him quietly instead of immediately executing him, as many other plotters were. Rommel was given a choice between committing [[suicide]], in return for assurances that his reputation would remain intact and that his family would not be persecuted following his death, or facing a trial that would result in his disgrace and execution; he chose the former and committed suicide using a [[cyanide pill]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/world/europe/manfred-rommel-son-of-german-field-marshal-dies-at-84.html|title=Manfred Rommel, Son of German Field Marshal, Dies at 84|first=Douglas|last=Martin|date=9 November 2013|publisher=|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> Rommel was given a state funeral, and it was announced that he had succumbed to his injuries from the strafing of his staff car in Normandy.\n\nRommel has become a larger-than-life figure in both Allied and [[Nazi propaganda]], and in postwar popular culture, with numerous authors considering him an apolitical, brilliant commander and a victim of the [[Third Reich]] although this assessment is contested by other authors as the [[Rommel myth]]. Rommel's reputation for conducting a clean war was used in the interest of the [[Wiederbewaffnung|West German rearmament]] and reconciliation between the former enemies \u2013 the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] on one side and the new [[Federal Republic of Germany]] on the other. Several of Rommel's former subordinates, notably his chief of staff [[Hans Speidel]], played key roles in [[Wiederbewaffnung|German rearmament]] and integration into [[NATO]] in the postwar era. The German Army's largest military base, the [[Field Marshal Rommel Barracks, Augustdorf]], is named in his honour.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== Early life and career ==\nRommel was born on 15 November 1891, in [[Southern Germany]] at [[Heidenheim an der Brenz|Heidenheim]], {{convert|45|km|mi}} from [[Ulm]], in the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]], then part of the [[German Empire]]. He was the third of five children to Erwin Rommel Senior (1860\u20131913) and his wife Helene von Lutz, whose father, [[Karl von Luz]], headed the local government council. As a young man, Rommel's father had been an artillery lieutenant. Rommel had one older sister who was an art teacher and his favorite sibling, one older brother named Manfred who died in infancy and two younger brothers, of whom one became a successful dentist and the other an opera singer.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=8}}{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=26\u201327}}{{sfn|Remy|2002|p=12}}{{sfn|Pimlott|2003|p=9}}\n\nAt age 18 Rommel joined the local 124th W\u00fcrttemberg Infantry Regiment as a ''[[F\u00e4hnrich]]'' ([[Ensign (rank)|ensign]]), in 1910, studying at the Officer Cadet School in [[Danzig]].{{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=10}} He graduated in November 1911 and was commissioned as a [[lieutenant]] in January 1912 and was assigned to the 124th Infantry in [[Weingarten, W\u00fcrttemberg|Weingarten]].{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=30\u201331}} He was posted to Ulm in March 1914 to the 46th Field Artillery Regiment, [[XIII (Royal W\u00fcrttemberg) Corps]], as a battery commander. He returned to the 124th when war was declared.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=43}} While at Cadet School, Rommel met his future wife, 17-year-old Lucia (Lucie) Maria Mollin (1894\u20131971), of Polish and Italian descent.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=31}}\n\n== World War I ==\n[[File:Erwin Rommel.jpg|thumb|upright|Lieutenant Rommel in Italy, 1917]]\n\nDuring World War I, Rommel fought in [[France]] as well as in the [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|Romanian]] (notably at the [[Second Battle of the Jiu Valley]]) and [[Italian campaign (World War I)|Italian campaigns]].

On 27 November the British attack on Tobruk linked up with the defenders, and Rommel, having suffered losses that could not easily be replaced, had to concentrate on regrouping the divisions that had attacked into Egypt. By 7 December Rommel fell back to a defensive line at Gazala, just west of Tobruk, all the while under heavy attack from the [[Desert Air Force]]. The Bardia garrison surrendered on 2 January and Halfaya on 17 January 1942.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|pp=291\u2013293}} The Allies kept up the pressure, and Rommel was forced to retreat all the way back to the starting positions he had held in March, reaching [[El Agheila]] in December 1941.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=304}} The British had retaken almost all of Cyrenaica, but Rommel's retreat dramatically shortened his supply lines.{{sfn|Douglas-Home|1973|p=131}}\n\n==== Battle of Gazala and capture of Tobruk ====\n\n{{Main|Battle of Gazala|Axis capture of Tobruk}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-785-0296-22A, Nordafrika, Rommel im Befehlsfahrzeug \"Greif\".jpg|thumb|left|North Africa, Rommel in a [[Sd.Kfz. 250]]/3]]\n\nOn 5 January 1942 the Afrika Korps received 55 tanks and new supplies and Rommel started planning a counterattack.

The Axis forces retook Benghazi on 29 January and [[Timimi]] on 3 February, with the Allies pulling back to a defensive line just before the Tobruk area south of the coastal town of Gazala. Rommel placed a thin screen of mobile forces before them, and held the main force of the Panzerarmee well back near Antela and Mersa Brega.{{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=106}} Between December 1941 and June 1942, Rommel had excellent information about the disposition and intentions of the Commonwealth forces.

He knew the British were planning offensive operations as well, and he hoped to pre-empt them.  While out on reconnaissance on 6 April, he was severely bruised in the abdomen when his vehicle was the target of artillery fire.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=319}} The British had 900 tanks in the area, 200 of which were new [[M3 Lee|Grant]] tanks. Unlike the British, the Axis forces had no armoured reserve; all operable equipment was put into immediate service. Rommel's [[Panzer Army Africa]] had a force of 320 German tanks; 50 of these were the light [[Panzer II]] model. In addition, 240 Italian tanks were in service, but these were under-gunned and poorly armoured.{{sfn|Rommel|1982|p=196}}\n\n[[File:Map of siege of Tobruk 1942.jpg|thumb|Situation in \"the Cauldron\", 27 May 1942]]\n\nEarly in the afternoon of 26 May 1942, Rommel attacked first and the [[Battle of Gazala]] commenced. Italian infantry supplemented with small numbers of armoured forces assaulted the centre of the Gazala fortifications. To give the impression that this was the main assault, spare aircraft engines mounted on trucks were used to create huge clouds of dust. Ritchie was not convinced by this display, and left the 4th and 22nd Armoured Brigades in position at the south end of the Commonwealth position.{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=323\u2013324}} Under the cover of darkness, the bulk of Rommel's motorized and armoured forces (15th and 21st Panzers, 90th Light Division, and the Italian Ariete and Trieste Divisions) drove south to skirt the left flank of the British, coming up behind them and attacking to the north the following morning.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=45}} Throughout the day a running armour battle occurred, where both sides took heavy losses. The Grant tanks proved to be impossible to knock out except at close range.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=326}}\n\nRenewing the attack on the morning of 28 May, Rommel concentrated on encircling and destroying separate units of the British armour. Repeated British counterattacks threatened to cut off and destroy the Afrika Korps. Running low on fuel, Rommel assumed a defensive posture, forming \"the Cauldron\". He made use of the extensive British minefields to shield his western flank. Meanwhile, Italian infantry cleared a path through the mines to provide supplies. On 30 May Rommel resumed the offensive, attacking westwards to link with elements of Italian X Corps, which had cleared a path through the Allied minefields to establish a supply line.{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=325\u2013327}} On 1 June, Rommel accepted the surrender of some 3,000 soldiers of the 150th Brigade.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=330}} On 6 June, 90th Light Division and the ''Trieste'' Division assaulted the Free French strongpoint in the [[Battle of Bir Hakeim]], but the defenders continued to thwart the attack until finally evacuating on 10 June.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=331}} With his communications and the southern strongpoint of the British line thus secured, Rommel shifted his attack north again, relying on the British minefields of the Gazala lines to protect his left flank.{{sfn|Rommel|1982|p=217}} Threatened with being completely cut off, the British began a retreat eastward toward Egypt on 14 June, the so-called \"Gazala Gallop\".{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=334}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-785-0293-11, Tobruk, Sch\u00fctzenpanzer, Panzer.jpg|thumb|left|The Afrika Korps enters Tobruk.]]\n\nOn 15 June Axis forces reached the coast, cutting off the escape for the Commonwealth forces still occupying the Gazala positions. With this task completed, Rommel struck for Tobruk while the enemy was still confused and disorganised.{{sfn|Rommel|1982|p=224}} Tobruk's defenders were at this point the 2nd South African Infantry Division, 4th Antiaircraft Brigade, 11th Indian Infantry, 32nd Army Tank, and 201st Guards Brigades, all under command of Major General [[Hendrik Klopper]]. The assault on Tobruk began at dawn on 20 June, and Klopper surrendered at dawn the following day.{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=334\u2013335}} With Tobruk, Rommel achieved the capture of 32,000 defenders, the port, and huge quantities of supplies.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=337}} Only at the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], earlier that year, had more [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] troops been captured at one time.

However, Hitler viewed the North African campaign primarily as a way to assist his Italian allies, not as an objective in and of itself. He would not consider sending Rommel the reinforcements and supplies he needed to take and hold Egypt, as this would have required diverting men and supplies from his primary focus: the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=911\u2013912}}\n\nRommel's success at Tobruk worked against him, as Hitler no longer felt it was necessary to proceed with [[Operation Herkules]], the proposed attack on Malta.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=342}} Auchinleck relieved Ritchie of command of the Eighth Army on 25 June, and temporarily took command himself.{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=339, 343}} Rommel knew that delay would only benefit the British, who continued to receive supplies at a faster rate than Rommel could hope to achieve.

On 1 July the [[First Battle of El Alamein]] began. Rommel had around 100 available tanks. The Allies were able to achieve local air superiority, with heavy bombers attacking the 15th and 21st Panzers, who had also been delayed by a sandstorm. The 90th Light Division veered off course and were pinned down by South African artillery fire.

The terrain left Rommel with no choice but to follow a similar tactic as he had at previous battles: the bulk of the forces attempted to sweep around from the south while secondary attacks were launched on the remainder of the front. It took much longer than anticipated to get through the minefields in the southern sector, and the tanks got bogged down in unexpected patches of quicksand (Montgomery had arranged for Rommel to acquire a falsified map of the terrain).{{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=48}}{{sfn|Douglas-Home|1973|p=165}} Under heavy fire from British artillery and aircraft, and in the face of well prepared positions that Rommel could not hope to outflank due to lack of fuel, the attack stalled.

Montgomery called off further action to preserve his strength and allow for further desert training for his forces.{{sfn|Carver|1962|p=70}} In the attack Rommel had suffered 2,940 casualties and lost 50 tanks, a similar number of guns, and 400 lorries, vital for supplies and movement. The British losses, except tank losses of 68, were much less, further adding to the numerical inferiority of Panzer Army Afrika. The Desert Air Force inflicted the highest proportions of damage on Rommel's forces.

By the end of 25 October, the 15th Panzer, the defenders in this sector, had only 31 serviceable tanks remaining of their initial force of 119.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=373}} Rommel brought the 21st Panzer and Ariete Divisions north on 26 October, to bolster the sector. On 28 October, Montgomery shifted his focus to the coast, ordering his 1st and 10th Armoured Divisions to attempt to swing around and cut off Rommel's line of retreat. Meanwhile, Rommel concentrated his attack on the Allied [[Salient (military)|salient]] at Kidney Ridge, inflicting heavy losses. However, Rommel had only 150 operational tanks remaining, and Montgomery had 800, many of them [[M4 Sherman|Shermans]].{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=378\u2013380}}\n\nMontgomery, seeing his armoured brigades losing tanks at an alarming rate, stopped major attacks until the early hours of 2 November, when he opened Operation Supercharge, with a massive artillery barrage.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=378}} This was followed by penetration at the salient by two armoured and two infantry divisions.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=385}} Rommel's counterattack at 11:00 inflicted severe casualties on the Commonwealth troops, but by 20:00, with only 35 tanks remaining, he ordered his forces to disengage and begin to withdraw.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|pp=379\u2013380}} At midnight, he informed the OKW of his decision, and received a reply directly from Hitler the following afternoon: he ordered Rommel and his troops to hold their position to the last man.

Heavy rains slowed movements and grounded the Desert Air Force, which aided the withdrawal. According to Kourt von Esebeck, those German parts of Panzerarmee Africa that were motorized slipped away from El Alamein, all vehicles had been taken away from Italian forces, leaving them behind,<ref>Kourt von Esebeck, Rommel, Damianos publishing, Athens,1966, page 151</ref> but were under pressure from the pursuing Eighth Army. According to officers of the Italian X Corps, they were not deliberately abandoned and an effort to save all divisions would only have led to destruction of more units.{{sfn|Scianna|2018|pp=135}} A series of short delaying actions was fought over the coastal highway, but no line could be held for any length of time, as Rommel lacked the armour and fuel to defend his open southern flank.{{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=190}} Rommel continued to retreat west, abandoning Halfaya Pass, Sollum, Mersa Brega and El Agheila.{{sfn|Coggins|1980|p=11}} The line Rommel was aiming for was 'Gabes gap' in Tunisia.{{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=192}} Luftwaffe Field Marshal Kesselring strongly criticized Rommel's decision to retreat all the way to Tunisia, as each airfield the Germans abandoned extended the range of the Allied bombers and fighters. Rommel defended his decision, pointing out that if he tried to assume a defensive position the Allies would destroy his forces and take the airfields anyway; the retreat saved the lives of his remaining men and shortened his supply lines. By now, Rommel's remaining forces fought in reduced strength combat groups, whereas the Allied forces had great numerical superiority and control of the air. Upon his arrival in [[Tunisia]], Rommel noted with some bitterness the reinforcements, including the 10th Panzer Division, arriving in Tunisia following the Allied invasion of Morocco.{{sfn|Rommel|1982|pp=342\u2013357}}\n\n===== Tunisia =====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1990-071-31, Nordafrika, Rommel, Bayerlein.jpg|thumb|left|Rommel speaks with troops who are using a captured American M3 half-track, Tunisia.]]\n\nHaving reached Tunisia, Rommel launched an attack against the [[U.S. II Corps]] which was threatening to cut his lines of supply north to Tunis. Rommel inflicted a sharp defeat on the American forces at the [[Battle of the Kasserine Pass|Kasserine Pass]] in February, his last battlefield victory of the war, and his first engagement against the United States Army.{{sfn|Coggins|1980|p=129}}\n\nRommel immediately turned back against the British forces, occupying the [[Mareth Line]] (old French defences on the Libyan border). While Rommel was at Kasserine at the end of January 1943, the Italian General [[Giovanni Messe]] was appointed commander of Panzer Army Africa, renamed the Italo-German Panzer Army in recognition of the fact that it consisted of one German and three Italian corps. Though Messe replaced Rommel, he diplomatically deferred to him, and the two coexisted in what was theoretically the same command. On 23 February ''Armeegruppe Afrika'' was created with Rommel in command. It included the Italo-German Panzer Army under Messe (renamed 1st Italian Army) and the German 5th Panzer Army in the north of Tunisia under General [[Hans-J\u00fcrgen von Arnim]].\n\nThe last Rommel offensive in North Africa was on 6 March 1943, when he attacked Eighth Army at the [[Battle of Medenine]].{{sfn|Coggins|1980|p=134}} The attack was made with [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th]], [[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th]], and [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st]] Panzer Divisions. Alerted by [[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]] intercepts, Montgomery deployed large numbers of anti-tank guns in the path of the offensive. After losing 52 tanks, Rommel called off the assault.{{sfn|Coggins|1980|p=135}} On 9 March he returned to Germany.{{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=209}} Command was handed over to General Hans-J\u00fcrgen von Arnim. Rommel never returned to Africa.{{sfn|Coggins|1980|p=136}} The fighting there continued on for another two months, until 13 May 1943, when General Messe surrendered the ''Armeegruppe Afrika'' to the Allies.\n\n=== Italy 1943 ===\nOn 23 July 1943 Rommel was moved to [[Greece]] as commander of [[Army Group E]] to counter a possible British invasion. He arrived in Greece on 25 July, but was recalled to Berlin the same day due to the overthrow of Mussolini. Rommel was to be posted to Italy as commander of the newly formed [[Army Group B]]. On 16 August 1943 Rommel's headquarters moved to [[Lake Garda]] in northern Italy and formally assumed command of the army group, which consisted of the [[44th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|44th Infantry Division]], the [[26th Panzer Division]] and the [[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler]]. When Italy announced its armistice with the Allies on 8 September, his forces took part in [[Operation Achse]], disarming the Italian forces.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|pp=115\u2013116}}\n\nHitler met with Rommel and Kesselring to discuss future operations in Italy on 30 September 1943. Rommel insisted on a defensive line north of Rome, while Kesselring was more optimistic and advocated holding a line south of Rome. Hitler preferred Kesselring's recommendation, and therefore revoked his previous decision for the subordination of Kesselring's forces to Rommel's army group. On 19 October Hitler decided that Kesselring would be the overall commander of the forces in Italy, sidelining Rommel.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|p=117}}\n\nRommel had wrongly predicted that the collapse of the German line in Italy would be fast. On 21 November Hitler gave Kesselring overall command of the Italian theater, moving Rommel and Army Group B to [[Normandy]] in France with responsibility for defending the French coast against the long anticipated Allied invasion.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=117}}\n\n=== Atlantic Wall 1944 ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-300-1863-29, Riva-Bella, Waffenvorf\u00fchrung Panzerwerfer, Rommel.jpg|thumb|right|Rommel observes the fall of shot at Riva-Bella, just north of Caen in the area that would become [[Sword Beach]] in Normandy.]]\nOn 4 November 1943, Rommel became General Inspector of the Western Defences. He was given a staff that befitted an army group commander, and the powers to travel, examine and make suggestions on how to improve the defences, but not a single soldier. Hitler, who was having a disagreement with him over military matters, intended to use Rommel as a psychological trump card.{{sfn|Remy|2002|p=215}}\n\nThere was broad disagreement in the German High Command as to how best to meet the expected allied invasion of Northern France. The Commander-in-Chief West, Gerd von Rundstedt, believed there was no way to stop the invasion near the beaches due to the firepower possessed by the Allied navies, as had been experienced at [[Allied invasion of Italy#German counterattacks|Salerno]].{{sfn|Willmott|1984|p=69}} He argued that the German armour should be held in reserve well inland near [[Paris]], where they could be used to counter-attack in force in a more traditional military doctrine. The allies could be allowed to extend themselves deep into France, where a battle for control would be fought, allowing the Germans to envelop the allied forces in a pincer movement, cutting off their avenue of retreat. He feared the piecemeal commitment of their armoured forces would cause them to become caught in a battle of attrition which they could not hope to win.{{sfn|Willmott|1984|p=69}}\n\n<!---[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J16796, Rommel mit Soldaten der Legion \"Freies Indien\".jpg|thumb|Inspecting the [[Indische Legion|Free India Legion]], France, 1944]]--->\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-719-0240-35, Pas de Calais, Atlantikwall, Luftlandehindernisse.jpg|thumb|left| A sketch by Rommel.

These tactics were still effective on the Eastern Front, where control of the air was important but did not dominate the action. Rommel's own experiences at the end of the North African campaign revealed to him that the Germans would not be allowed to preserve their armour from air attack for this type of massed assault.{{sfn|Willmott|1984|p=69}} Rommel believed their only opportunity would be to oppose the landings directly at the beaches, and to counterattack there before the invaders could become well established. Though there had been some defensive positions established and gun emplacements made, the [[Atlantic Wall]] was a token defensive line. Rundstedt had confided to Rommel that it was for propaganda purposes only.{{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=213}}\n\nUpon arriving in Northern France Rommel was dismayed by the lack of completed works. According to [[Friedrich Ruge|Ruge]], Rommel was in a staff position and could not issue orders, but he took every effort to explain his plan to commanders down to the platoon level, who took up his words eagerly, but \"more or less open\" opposition from the above slowed down the process.<ref name=\"Ruge160415\"/> Finally, Rundstedt, who only respected Rommel grudgingly (he called him Field Marshal Cub),{{sfn|Mitcham|1997|pp=15, 23}}{{sfn|Messenger|2009|p=166}} intervened and supported Rommel's request for being made a commander.{{sfn|Brighton|2008|p=247}} It was granted in 15 January 1944, when \"much valuable time had been lost.\"<ref name=\"Ruge160415\">{{cite web|last1=Ruge|last2=Dihm|first1=Friedrich|first2=Friedrich|title=Rommel and the Atlantic Wall December 1943 - July 1944 Oral History - World War II - Invasion of Normandy (1944)|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/r/rommel-atlantic-wall.html#352|website=Naval History and Heritage Command (US)|date=16 April 2015|accessdate=16 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe set out to improve the fortifications along the [[Atlantic Wall]] with great energy and engineering skill.{{refn|Lieb: Of course, Rommel did not conceive all these devices himself&nbsp;...

This was a compromise: Rommel now commanded the 7th and 15th armies; he also had authority over a 20-kilometer-wide strip of coastal land between [[Zuiderzee]] and the mouth of the Loire. The chain of command was convoluted: the airforce and navy had their own chiefs, as did the South and Southwest France and the Panzer group; Rommel also needed Hitler's permissions to use the tank divisions.{{sfn|Remy|2002|p=219}} Undeterred, Rommel had millions of mines laid and thousands of tank traps and obstacles set up on the beaches and throughout the countryside, including in fields suitable for glider aircraft landings, the so-called [[Rommel's asparagus]].{{sfn|Lieb|2014|p=121}}(The Allies would later counter these with [[Hobart's Funnies]]){{sfn|Rice|2009|p=90}} In April 1944 Rommel promised Hitler that the preparations would be complete by 1 May, but by the time of the Allied invasion the preparations were far from finished.

In late April, he ordered the [[I SS Panzer Corps]] placed near Paris, far enough inland to be useless to Rommel, but not far enough for Rundstedt. Rommel moved those armoured formations under his command as far forward as possible, ordering General [[Erich Marcks]], commanding the 84th Corps defending the Normandy section, to move his reserves into the frontline. Although Rommel was the dominating personality in Normandy with Rundstedt willing to delegate most of the responsibilities to him (the central reserve was Rundstedt's idea but he did not oppose to some form of coastal defense, and gradually came under the influence of Rommel's thinking), Rommel's strategy of an armor-supported coastal defense line was opposed by some officers, most notably [[Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg]], who was supported by Guderian.{{sfn|Cad\u0111ick-Adams|2013|p=221}}{{sfn|Willmott|1984|p=69}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Gordon|title=US Army in WW II: European Theater of Operations, Cross Channel Attack|date=1951|isbn=978-0-7948-3739-6|page=247|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSAW3D9GIHQC&pg=PA247}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Andrew|title=D-Day To Berlin|date=2004|isbn=978-0-340-83397-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSAW3D9GIHQC&pg=PA247}}</ref>{{sfn|Brighton|2008|p=247}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Keegan|first1=John|title=The Book of War: 25 Centuries of Great War Writing -On the Other Side of the Hill|date=1999|isbn=978-0-14-029655-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4c6n8T9rNeMC&pg=PT359}}</ref> Hitler compromised and gave Rommel three divisions (the 2nd, the 21st and the 116th Panzer), let Rundstedt retain four and turned the other three to Army Group G, pleasing no one.{{sfn|Mitcham|1997|p=198}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=Joshua|title=Operation Fortitude: The Story of the Spies and the Spy Operation That Saved D-Day|date=22 November 2011|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7627-7735-8|pages=7\u20139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQWiCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA8}}</ref>\n\nThe Allies staged elaborate deceptions for [[D-Day]] (see [[Operation Fortitude]]), giving the impression that the landings would be at Calais. Although Hitler himself expected a Normandy invasion for a while, Rommel and most Army commanders in France believed there would be two invasions, with the main invasion coming at the Pas-de-Calais. Rommel drove defensive preparations all along the coast of Northern France, particularly concentrating fortification building in the [[River Somme]] estuary. By D-Day on 6 June 1944 nearly all the German staff officers, including Hitler's staff, believed that Pas-de-Calais was going to be the main invasion site, and continued to believe so even after the landings in Normandy had occurred.{{sfn|Willmott|1984|p=89}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-718-0149-12A, Paris, Rommel, von Rundstedt, Gause und Zimmermann.jpg|thumb|left|Generalfeldmarsch\u00e4lle [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] and Erwin Rommel meeting in Paris]]\n\nThe 5 June storm in the channel seemed to make a landing very unlikely, and a number of the senior officers were away from their units for training exercises and various other efforts. On 4 June the chief meteorologist of the 3 Air Fleet reported that weather in the channel was so poor there could be no landing attempted for two weeks. On 5 June Rommel left France and on 6 June he was at home celebrating his wife's birthday.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|p=121}} He was recalled and returned to his headquarters at 10{{nbsp}}pm. Meanwhile, earlier in the day, Rundstedt had requested the reserves be transferred to his command. At 10{{nbsp}}am Keitel advised that Hitler declined to release the reserves but that Rundstedt could move the [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend]] closer to the coast, with the [[Panzer-Lehr-Division]] placed on standby. Later in the day, Rundstedt received authorisation to move additional units in preparation for a counterattack, which Rundstedt decided to launch on 7 June. Upon arrival, Rommel concurred with the plan. By nightfall, Rundstedt, Rommel and Speidel continued to believe that the Normandy landing might have been a diversionary attack, as the Allied deception measures still pointed towards Calais.

Rommel believed that if his armies pulled out of range of Allied naval fire, it would give them a chance to regroup and re-engage them later with a better chance of success.

In the autumn of 1941 and early winter of 1941/1942, he was mentioned in the British press almost daily. Toward the end of the year, the Reich propaganda machine also used Rommel's successes in Africa as a diversion from the Wehrmacht's challenging situation in the Soviet Union with the stall of [[Operation Barbarossa]].{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=136\u2013139}}{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2012|p=471}}{{refn|group=N|[[Peter Caddick-Adams]]: \"Rommel's advances over the winter 1941\u201342 became a very useful distraction away from Germany's failure before Moscow.\"{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2012|p=471}}}} The American press soon began to take notice of Rommel as well, following the country's entry into the war on 11 December 1941, writing that \"The British (...) admire him because he beat them and were surprised to have beaten in turn such a capable general.\" General Auchinleck distributed a directive to his commanders seeking to dispel the notion that Rommel was a \"superman\".{{sfn|Watson|1999|pp=166\u2013167}}{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=141\u2013143}} Rommel, no matter how hard the situation was, made a deliberate effort at always spending some time with soldiers and patients, his own and POWs alike, which contributed greatly to his reputation of not only being a great commander but also \"a decent chap\" among the troops.<ref name=\"Auchinleck: The Lonely Soldier\"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Majdalany|first1=Fred|title=The Battle of El Alamein: Fortress in the Sand|date=2003|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-1850-3|pages=31\u201332|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9JDXgTOgEgC&pg=PA31}}</ref>\n\nThe attention of the Western and especially the British press thrilled Goebbels, who wrote in his diary in early 1942: \"Rommel continues to be the recognized darling of even the enemies' news agencies.\"{{sfn|Reuth|2005|p=144}} The Field Marshal was pleased by the media attention, although he knew the downsides of having a reputation.{{sfn|Reuth|2005|p=144}}{{refn|group=N|Quote from one of Rommel's letters, January 1942: \"The opinion of me in the world press has improved.\"{{sfn|Reuth|2005|p=144}}}}{{sfn|Zaloga|2013|p=24}} Hitler took note of the British propaganda as well, commenting in the summer of 1942 that Britain's leaders must have hoped \"to be able to explain their defeat to their own nation more easily by focusing on Rommel\".{{sfn|Reuth|2005|p=148}}\n\nThe Field Marshal was the German commander most frequently covered in the German media, and the only one to be given a press conference, which took place in October 1942.{{sfn|Citino|2012}}{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=144\u2013146}} The press conference was moderated by Goebbels and was attended by both domestic and foreign media. Rommel declared: \"Today we (...) have the gates of Egypt in hand, and with the intent to act!\" Keeping the focus on Rommel distracted the German public from Wehrmacht losses elsewhere as the tide of the war began to turn. He became a symbol that was used to reinforce the German public's faith in an ultimate Axis victory.{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=150\u2013152}}\n\n===Military reverses===\n\nIn the wake of the successful British offensive in November 1942 and other military reverses, the Propaganda Ministry directed the media to emphasize Rommel's invincibility. The charade was maintained until the spring of 1943, even as the German situation in Africa became increasingly precarious. To ensure that the inevitable defeat in Africa would not be associated with Rommel's name, Goebbels had the [[OKH|Supreme High Command]] announce in May 1943 that Rommel was on a two-month leave for health reasons.{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=154\u2013158}}{{refn|group=N|[[Peter Lieb]]: \"Hitler was well aware that it would be unwise (...) to link the downfall of Army Group Africa to the name of Rommel, the child of Joseph Goebbel's propaganda machinery.\"{{sfn|Lieb|2014|p=113}}}} Instead, the campaign was presented by Berndt, who resumed his role in the Propaganda Ministry, as a ruse to tie down the British Empire while Germany was turning Europe into an impenetrable fortress with Rommel at the helm of this success. After the radio program ran in May 1943, Rommel sent Berndt a case of cigars as a sign of his gratitude.{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=154\u2013158}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-719-0243-33, Atlantikwall, Inspektion Erwin Rommel mit Offizieren.jpg|thumb|right|One of the many propaganda photographs of Rommel on inspection tours of the [[Atlantic wall]]]]\nAlthough Rommel then entered a period without a significant command, he remained a household name in Germany, synonymous with the aura of invincibility.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|pp=113\u2013115, 117\u2013118}} Hitler then made Rommel part of his defensive strategy for [[Fortress Europe]] (''Festung Europa'') by sending him to the West to inspect fortifications along the [[Atlantic Wall]]. Goebbels supported the decision, noting in his diary that Rommel was \"undoubtedly the suitable man\" for the task. The propaganda minister expected the move to reassure the German public and at the same time to have a negative impact on the Allied forces' morale.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nIn France, a Wehrmacht propaganda company frequently accompanied Rommel on his inspection trips to document his work for both domestic and foreign audiences.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|p=120}}{{sfn|Reuth|2005|p=159}} In May 1944 the German newsreels reported on Rommel's speech at a Wehrmacht conference, where he stated his conviction that \"every single German soldier will make his contribution against the Anglo-American spirit that it deserves for its criminal and bestial air war campaign against our homeland.\" The speech led to an upswing in morale and sustained confidence in Rommel.{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=159\u2013161}}\n\nWhen Rommel was seriously wounded on 17 July 1944, the Propaganda Ministry undertook efforts to conceal the injury so as not to undermine domestic morale. Despite those, the news leaked to the British press. To counteract the rumors of a serious injury and even death, Rommel was required to appear at the 1 August press conference. On 3 August, the German press published an official report that Rommel had been injured in a car accident. Rommel noted in his diary his dismay at this twisting of the truth, belatedly realising how much the Reich propaganda was using him for its own ends.{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=159\u2013161}}\n\n===Rommel's views on propaganda===\n\nRommel was interested in propaganda beyond the promotion of his own image. In 1944, after visiting Rommel in France and reading his proposals on counteracting Allied propaganda, Alfred-Ingemar Berndt remarked: \"He is also interested in this propaganda business and wants to develop it by all means. He has even thought and brought out practical suggestions for each program and subject.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fischer|first1=Thomas|title=Propaganda-Star Ein Mythos entsteht|url=http://www.swr.de/rommel/propaganda-start/ein-mythos-entsteht/-/id=10224974/did=10224880/nid=10224974/ktgj7v/index.html|accessdate= 2016-08-04 |date=2 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nRommel saw the propaganda and education values in his and his nation's deeds (He also did value justice itself: According to Admiral Ruge's diary, Rommel told Ruge: \"Justice is the indispensable foundation of a nation. Unfortunately, the higher-ups are not clean. The slaughterings are grave sins.\"{{sfn|Remy|2002|p=247}}) The key to the successful creating of an image, according to Rommel, was leading by example: \"The men tend to feel no kind of contact with a commander who, they know, is sitting somewhere in headquarters.

When Rommel came to North Africa, it was picked up and disseminated in the West by the British press as the Allies sought to explain their continued inability to defeat the Axis forces in North Africa.{{sfn|Major|2008}} The British military and political figures contributed to the heroic image of the man as Rommel resumed offensive operations in January 1942 against the British forces weakened by redeployments to the Far East. During parliamentary debate following the fall of Tobruk, Churchill described Rommel as an \"extraordinary bold and clever opponent\" and a \"great field commander\".{{sfn|Watson|1999|pp=166\u2013167}}{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=141\u2013143}}\n\nAccording to ''Der Spiegel'' following the war's end, West Germany yearned for father figures who were needed to replace the former ones who had been unmasked as criminals. Rommel was chosen because he embodied the decent soldier, cunning yet fair-minded, and if guilty by association, not so guilty that he became unreliable, and additionally, former comrades reported that he was close to the Resistance.{{sfn|Von Fleischhauer|Friedmann|2012|}} While everyone else was disgraced, his star became brighter than ever, and he made the historically unprecedented leap over the threshold between eras: from Hitler's favourite general to the young republic's hero. Cornelia Hecht notes that despite the change of times, Rommel has become the symbol of different regimes and concepts, which is paradoxical, whoever the man he really was.{{r|Welt180808}}<ref>{{cite book |editor-last1=Hecht|editor-first1=Cornelia |last1=H\u00e4ussler |first1=Johannes |last2=Linder |first2=Rainer |date=2008 |title=Mythos Rommel |publisher=Haus der Geschichte Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg |isbn=978-3-933726-28-5 |pp=9\u201311 }}</ref> Ulrich vom Hagen reports that Rommel, for the admiration shown towards him by all sides after the war, was used as a unity symbol that led to the \"elegant settlement\" of the conflict between fascistic, small-bourgeois elements and the aristocratic traditionalists during the early years after the formation of the Bundeswehr.<ref>{{cite book|last=vom Hagen|first=Ulrich|title=Homo militaris: Perspektiven einer kritischen Milit\u00e4rsoziologie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5rTWBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA184|publisher=transcript Verlag (transcript)|year=2014|isbn=978-3-8394-1937-3|pp=183\u2013184}}</ref> Simon Ball describes how various elements in the German and British armies and governments extensively used Rommel's image in dealing with their inner struggles, promoting aspects of his that each group associated with themselves. [[Eric Dorman-Smith]] claimed that it was a \"pity we could not have combined with Rommel to clean up the whole mess on both sides\".{{sfn|Ball|2016|pp=92, 102\u2013104}} Already in September 1944, the officer Heinz Eugen Eberbach (later a leading figure in the Bundeswehr) anticipated that the Allied victors would have to turn to Rommel and men like him, because he was accepted by both the old regime and the working class, whom the English would not be able to win over by telling them: \"The entire previous system is rotten to the core\".{{sfn|Neitzel|2007|p=105}}\n\nAt the same time, the Western Allies, and particularly the British, depicted Rommel as the \"good German\". His reputation for conducting a clean war was used in the interest of the [[Wiederbewaffnung|West German rearmament]] and reconciliation between the former enemies\u2014Britain and the United States on one side and the new Federal Republic of Germany on the other.{{sfn|Searle|2014|p=9}} When Rommel's alleged involvement in the plot to kill Hitler became known after the war, his stature was enhanced in the eyes of his former adversaries. Rommel was often cited in Western sources as a patriotic German willing to stand up to Hitler. Churchill wrote about him in 1950: \"[Rommel] (...) deserves our respect because, although a loyal German soldier, he came to hate Hitler and all his works and took part in the conspiracy of 1944 to rescue Germany by displacing the maniac and tyrant.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1950|p=200}}\n\n===Foundational works===\nThe German rearmament of the early 1950s was highly dependent on the moral rehabilitation that the Wehrmacht needed. The journalist and historian [[Basil Liddell Hart]], an early proponent of these two interconnected initiatives, provided the first widely available source on Rommel in his 1948 book on Hitler's generals, updated in 1951, portraying Rommel in a positive light and as someone who stood apart from the regime.{{sfn|Searle|2014|pp=8, 27}}\n\nThe other foundational text was the influential and laudatory 1950 biography ''[[Rommel: The Desert Fox]]'' by Brigadier Desmond Young.{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2012|p=478}}{{sfn|Beckett|2014|loc=I.F.W.

Speidel contributed as well, starting from the early 1950s to bring up Rommel's and his own role in the plot, boosting his [Speidel's] suitability for a future role in the new military force of the Federal Republic, the [[Bundeswehr]], and then in [[NATO]].{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2012|p=474}}\n\nFurther in 1953 was the publication of Rommel's writings of the war period as ''The Rommel Papers,'' edited by Liddell Hart.{{sfn|Connelly|2014|p=163}} The book contributed to the perception of Rommel as a brilliant commander; in an introduction, Liddell Hart drew comparisons between Rommel and [[Lawrence of Arabia]], \"two masters of desert warfare\".{{sfn|Major|2008|p=526}} Liddell Hart had a personal interest in the work: by having coaxed Rommel's widow to include material favorable to himself, he could present Rommel as his \"pupil\". The controversy was described by the political scientist [[John Mearsheimer]], who concluded that, by \"manipulating history\", Liddell Hart was in a position to show that he was at the root of the dramatic German success in 1940.{{sfn|Mearsheimer|1988|pp=199\u2013200}}{{sfn|Luvaas|1990|pp=12\u201313}}\n\n===Elements of the myth===\n[[File:Rommel's Africa uniform.jpg|thumb|upright|Allegedly Rommel's desert uniform and [[death mask]] (right) displayed at the [[German Tank Museum]] in [[Munster, Lower Saxony|Munster]]]]\nAccording to Mark Connelly, Young and Liddell Hart laid the foundation for the Anglo-American myth, which consisted of three themes: Rommel's ambivalence towards Nazism; his military genius; and the emphasis of the chivalrous nature of the fighting in North Africa.{{sfn|Connelly|2014|p=163}} Their works lent support to the image of the \"[[clean Wehrmacht]]\" and were generally not questioned, since they came from British authors, rather than German revisionists.{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2012|p=483}}{{refn|group=N|Kitchen: \"The North African campaign has usually been seen, as in the title of Rommel's account, as 'War without Hate,' and thus as further proof that the German army was not involved in any sordid butchering, which was left to Himmler's SS.

According to Watson, the most dominant element is Rommel the Superior Soldier; the second being Rommel the Common Man; and the last one Rommel the Martyr.{{sfn|Watson|1999|pp=157\u2013161}} The German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' described the myth in 2007 as \"Gentleman warrior, military genius\".{{sfn|Friedmann|2007}}{{refn|group=N|[[Spiegel Online]]: \"Gentleman warrior, military genius.

According to the prominent German historian [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], the modern consensus agrees with post-war sources that Rommel treated the Allied captives decently, and he personally thinks that the movie ''[[Rommel (film)|Rommel]]'' does not overstate his conscience.  Also according to Wehler, scholars in England and the US still show a lot of admiration towards Rommel the military commander.{{r|FrankAllg112012}} Some authors, notably Wolfgang Proske, see Rommel as a criminal whose memorials should be removed, although these represent the unorthodox minority (which is admitted by Proske).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kanold|first1=J\u00fcrgen|title=Denkmal des Ansto\u00dfes|url=http://www.swp.de/ulm/lokales/ulm_neu_ulm/Denkmal-des-Anstosses;art4329,1355468 |accessdate= 2016-08-04 |date=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Paterson|first1=Tony|title=Was the Desert Fox an honest soldier or just another Nazi?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/was-the-desert-fox-an-honest-soldier-or-just-another-nazi-6272076.html|agency=www.independent.co.uk/|date=2011}}</ref> Perry and Massari note that the majority of historians continue to describe Rommel as a brilliant, chivalrous commander.{{sfn|Perry|2012|p=165}}<ref name=Massari>{{cite book|last1=Massari|first1=Ivano|title=Erwin Rommel \u2013 Desert Fox \u2013 The Bold and the Brave|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdYTAAAAQBAJ&dq=rommel+chivalrous+montgomery|website=warhistoryonline|accessdate=12 October 2016|isbn=9781447235538|date=11 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nModern historians who agree with the image of the apolitical, chivalrous genius{{sfn|Knopp|2013|p=54}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fredriksen|first1=John C.|title=America's Military Adversaries: From Colonial Times to the Present|date=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-603-3|page=435|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJlm7AQK-T4C&pg=PA435}}</ref>{{sfn|Strawson|2014|p=124}}<ref name=Massari/>{{sfn|Wistrich|2001|p=107}}{{sfn|Holmes|2009|p=129}}{{sfn|Bradford|2011|pp=66, 183}}{{sfn|Sadler|2016|p=63}} also have different opinions regarding details.

Instead, --> Rommel was a \"complicated man of many contradictions,\"{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2012|pp=485\u2013486}} while Beckett notes that \"Rommel's myth (...) has proved remarkably resilient\" and that more work is needed to put him in proper historical context.{{sfn|Beckett|2014|p=6}} Watson opines that historians often portray Rommel as someone they want him to be, \"coward&nbsp;... hero, fool, villain or hypocrite,\" and that he seemed to be all of these things, except coward, with perhaps a naive loyalty.{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=122}} Hansen counters that Rommel was hardly naive, always judged military and political situations with cold objectivity, and shared a lot of characteristics with Hitler,{{sfn|Hansen|2014|pp=48, 69, 71, 354}} an opinion shared by psychoanalyst and historian Geoffrey Cocks who writes that Rommel \"embodies the modern synergy of technical expertise and self-promotion&nbsp;... arriviste,&nbsp;... professionally ambitious, adept at cultivating a mass media image&nbsp;... like Hitler\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cocks|first1=Geoffrey|title=The State of Health: Illness in Nazi Germany|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-969567-6|page=206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DMUDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206}}</ref>\n\nThere is also, especially in Germany, an increasing tendency to portray Rommel as someone who cannot be explained in concrete details yet.

This ideal of modern knighthood is connected and combined with the anachronistic [[Miles Christianus]] model, the more recent \"Miles Protector\" model,{{sfn|D\u00e4niker|2002|p=117}} the \"Soldier-Statesman\" concept, and the traditional monofunctional combatant.{{sfn|vom Hagen|2014|pp=183\u2013184}}\n\nCertain modern military historians, such as Larry T. Addington, Niall Barr, [[Douglas Porch]] and [[Robert Citino]], are skeptical of Rommel as an operational, let alone strategic level commander. They point to Rommel's lack of appreciation for Germany's strategic situation, his misunderstanding of the relative importance of his theatre to the German High Command, his poor grasp of logistical realities, and, according to the historian Ian Beckett, his \"penchant for glory hunting\".{{sfn|Beckett|2014|loc=I.F.W.

Compounding the problem was the Wehrmacht's institutional tendency to discount logistics, industrial output and their opponents' capacity to learn from past mistakes.{{sfn|Porch|2004|p=206}}\n\nThe historian [[Geoffrey P. Megargee]] points out Rommel's playing the German and Italian command structures against each other to his advantage. Rommel used the confused structure (the OKW ([[OKW|Supreme Command of the Wehrmacht]]), the OKH ([[OKH|Supreme High Command of the Army]]) and the Italian Supreme Command) to disregard orders that he disagreed with or to appeal to whatever authority he felt would be most sympathetic to his requests.{{sfn|Megargee|2000|p=97}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-263-1598-04, Frankreich, Rommel, \"Indische Legion\".jpg|thumb|Inspecting the soldiers of the anti-British [[Indische Legion|Free India Legion]], France, 1944]]\nSome historians take issue with Rommel's absence from Normandy on the day of the Allied invasion, 6 June 1944.

Storbeck, Deputy Inspector General of the Bundeswehr (1987\u20131991), remarks that, Rommel's leadership style and offensive thinking, although carrying inherent risks like losing the overview of the situation and creating overlapping of authority, have been proved effective, and have been analysed and incorporated in the training of officers by \"us, our Western allies, the Warsaw Pact, and even the Israel Defense Forces\".{{r|Storbeck041213}} Maurice Remy and [[Samuel W.

[[Correspondence chess]] has been played by mail for centuries. ''[[Diplomacy (board game)|Diplomacy]]'' has been played by mail since 1963, introducing a multi-player aspect to PBM games.<ref name=Babcock13>[[#Bab13|Babcock 2013]]. p. 16.</ref> [[Flying Buffalo Inc]] pioneered the first commercially available PBM game in 1970. A small number of PBM companies followed in the 1970s, with an explosion of hundreds of startup PBM companies in the 1980s at the peak of PBM gaming popularity, many of them small hobby companies\u2014more than 90 percent of which eventually folded. A number of independent PBM magazines also started in the 1980s, including ''[[Flagship magazine]]'', ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', and ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''. These magazines eventually went out of print, replaced in the 21st century by the online PBM journal ''[[Suspense and Decision]]''.\n\nPlay-by-mail games have a number of advantages and disadvantages related to other gaming genres. PBM games allow plenty of time\u2014sometimes days or weeks\u2014to consider moves or turns and players never run out of opponents to face. Additionally, the complexity of PBM games can be far beyond that allowed by a board game in an afternoon, and pits players against live opponents in these conditions, a challenge some players enjoy. Some games allow the number of opponents or teams in the dozens, even as high as fifty. PBM games also allow gamers to interact with others globally. And games with low turn costs compare well with expensive board or video games. Some drawbacks include the price for some PBM games with high setup and/or turn costs, and the lack of ability for face-to-face roleplaying. Additionally, for some players, some games can be overly complex, and delays in turn processing can be a negative.\n\nPlay-by-mail games are multifaceted. In their earliest form they involved two players alternatively sending moves directly to each other by postal mail, such as in correspondence chess. Multi-player games, such as ''Diplomacy'' or more complex games available today, involve a [[game master]] who receives, processes, and adjudicates turn results for players. These games also introduce the element of [[diplomacy]] in which participants can discuss gameplay with each other, strategize, and form [[alliances]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, turn results were sometimes adjudicated completely by humans. Over time, partial or complete turn adjudication by computer became the norm. Games also involve open and closed end variants. Open ended games do not end and players can develop their positions to the fullest extent possible, whereas in closed end games, players typically pursue a set of victory conditions until game conclusion. Finally, PBM games enable players to explore a diverse array of roles, from characters in fantasy or medieval settings, space operas, inner city gangs, or even more unusual ones such as assuming the role of microorganisms or monsters.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Postcard-for-correspondence-chess (trimmed image).png|thumb|right|Postcard for international correspondence chess]]\nThe earliest play-by-mail games developed as a way for geographically separated gamers to compete with each other using [[postal mail]]. [[Chess]] is the oldest example of this type. It has been played for hundreds of years in various countries by mail. In this two player game, players send moves directly to each other. Multi-player games emerged later. ''[[Diplomacy (game)|Diplomacy]]'' is an example of this type in which a central [[game master]] manages the game, receiving moves and publishing adjudications. ''Diplomacy'' was first played by mail in 1963.<ref name=Babcock13/> In the early 1970s, in the United States, [[Rick Loomis]], of [[Flying Buffalo Inc]], began a number of multi-player play-by-mail games;<ref>[[#Loo13|Loomis 2013]]. p. 38.</ref> this included games such as ''[[Nuclear Destruction (play-by-mail)|Nuclear Destruction]]'', which launched in 1970.<ref>[[#Fly20|Flying Buffalo 2020]].</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = \"[Rick Loomis] is generally recognized as the founder of the PBM industry.\"\n| source = \u2014 ''The Editors of Space Gamer Magazine, 1985''.<ref>[[#Edi85|The Editors 1985]]. p. 35.</ref>\n| width  = 27%\n| align  = left| style = padding:8px;\n}}\n\nThis began the professional PBM industry in the United States. Professional game moderation started in 1971 at Flying Buffalo which added games such as [[Battleplan (play-by-mail game)|''Battleplan'']], ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'', ''[[Starweb]]'', and others, which by the late 1980s were all computer moderated.<ref name=Townsend88a>[[#Tow88|Townsend 1988]]. p. 20.</ref> For approximately five years, Flying Buffalo was the single dominant company in the US PBM industry until [[Schubel & Son]] entered the field in \"roughly\" 1976 with the human-moderated ''[[The Tribes of Crane|Tribes of Crane]]'' game.<ref name=Townsend88a/> Schubel & Son introduced fee structure innovations which allowed players to pay additional fees for additional options or special actions outside of the rules. This provided players with larger bankrolls the advantage or the ability to abuse game systems.<ref name=Townsend88a/>\n\nThe next \"big entrance\" was [[Superior Simulations]] with its game ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' in 1978.<ref name=Townsend88a/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that it was \"the most complex game system on Earth\" with some large position turn results 1,000 pages in length.<ref name=Townsend88a/> By 1980, the PBM field was growing but still nascent: there were still only two sizable commercial PBM companies, and only a few small ones.<ref name=Popo90>[[#Pop90|Popolizio, Leblanc, and Popolizio 1990]]. p. 8.</ref> The most popular games of 1980 were ''Starweb'' and ''Tribes of Crane''.<ref name=Popo90/>\n\nSome players, unhappy with their experiences with Schubel & Son and Superior Simulations, launched their own company\u2014Adventures by Mail\u2014with game, ''[[Beyond the Stellar Empire (play-by-mail game)|''Beyond the Stellar Empire'']]'', which became \"immensely popular\".<ref name=Townsend88a/> In this same way, many people have launched PBM companies, trying their hand at finding the right mix of action and strategy for the gaming audience of the period. According to Jim Townsend: <blockquote>In the late 70's and all of the 80's, many small PBM firms have opened their doors and better than 90% of them have failed. Although PBM is an easy industry to get into, staying in business is another thing entirely. Literally hundreds of PBM companies have come and gone, most of them taking the money of would-be-customers with them.<ref name=Townsend88a/></blockquote>\n\nTownsend emphasized the risks for the PBM industry in that \"The new PBM company has such a small chance of surviving that no insurance company would write a policy to cover them. Skydivers are a better risk.\"<ref>[[#Tow89|Townsend 1989]]. p. 55.</ref> By the late 1980s, of the more than one hundred play-by-mail companies operating, the majority were hobbies\u2013not run as businesses to make money.<ref name=Townsend12>[[#Tow12|Townsend 1988]]. p. 19.</ref> Jim Townsend estimated that, in 1988, there were about a dozen profitable PBM companies in the United States\u2014with an additional few in the [[United Kingdom]] and the same in [[Australia]].<ref name=Townsend12/>\n\nThe proliferation of PBM companies in the 1980s supported the publication of a number of newsletters from individual play-by-mail companies as well as independent publications which focused solely on the play-by-mail gaming industry such as the relatively short-lived ''[[The Nuts & Bolts of PBM]]'' and ''[[Gaming Universal]]''. The PBM genre's \"two preeminent magazines\" of the period were [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] and ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''.<ref>[[#Pad93|Paduch 1993]]. p. RC21.</ref> Also in the mid-1980s, \"general gaming magazines\" began carrying articles on PBM and run PBM advertisements, and the Origins Awards began a \"Best PBM Game\" category.<ref>[[#Loo85|Loomis 1985]]. p. 35.</ref> \n\nThe 1990s brought the onset of the digital age of computers, with many gamers shifting to digital platforms versus play-by-mail games. But with the shift to the digital age has come new opportunities as well. PBM companies have introduced play-by-email (PBeM) options or games that are run in a turn-based fashion by email only.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the PBM industry still maintained some of the momentum from the 1980s. In 1993, ''Flagship'' magazine listed 185 active play-by-mail games.<ref>[[#Pro93|Procter 1993]]. p. 51.</ref> However, over time, the play-by-mail industry has gradually declined.\n\nIn 1998, ''Paper Mayhem'' magazine ceased publication suddenly after the unexpected death of its longtime editor in chief, David Webber.<ref>[[#Mui13|Muir 2013]]. p. 14.</ref> The last of the play-by-mail magazines started in the 1980s, ''Flagship'', went out of print in 2010. The number of remaining play-by-mail publications is relatively small\u2014mostly newsletters associated with play-by-mail companies, although ''[[Suspense and Decision]]'' remains as an independent online journal for play-by-mail gamers in the 21st century.<ref>[[#Sus20|Suspense & Decision 2020]].</ref>\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages of PBM gaming==\nJudith Proctor noted that play-by-mail games have a number of advantages. These include (1) plenty of time\u2014potentially days\u2014to plan a move, (2) never lacking players to face who have \"new tactics and ideas\", (3) the ability to play an \"incredibly complex\" game against live opponents, (4) meeting diverse gamers from far-away locations, and (5) relatively low costs.<ref>[[#Pro93a|Procter 1993]]. p. 51.</ref> Andrew Greenberg also pointed to the number of players possible in a multi-player game (\"as many as fifty teams\"), comparing it to his past failure at once trying to host an eleven-player [[Dungeons and Dragons]] Game.<ref name=Green93>[[#Gre93|Greenberg 1993]]. p. 51.</ref> \n\nGreenberg identified a number of drawbacks for play-by-mail games. He stated that the \"most obvious\" was the cost, because most games require a setup cost and a fee per turn, and some games can become expensive.<ref name=Green93/> Another drawback is the lack of face-to-face roleplaying inherent in play-by-mail games.<<ref name=Green93/> Finally, game complexity in some cases and occasional delays in turn processing can also be negatives in the genre.<ref name=Green93/>\n\n==Description==\nIn 1993, ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''\u2014a magazine for play-by-mail gamers\u2014described play-by-mail games thusly: <blockquote>PBM Games vary in the size of the games, turn around time, length of time a game lasts, and prices. An average PBM game has 10\u201320 players in it, but there are also games that have hundreds of players. Turn around time is the length of time it takes to get your turn back from a company. The average turnaround time is 2 weeks. Some games never end. They can go on virtually forever or until you decide to drop. Many games have victory conditions that can be achieved within a year or two. Prices vary for the different PBM games, but the average price per turn [in 1993] is about $5.00.<ref name=MayhemFeb93>[[#Fro93|Paper Mayhem Jan/Feb 1993]]. p. 1.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Mechanics===\nAfter the initial setup of a PBM game, players begin submitting turn orders. In general, players fill out a turn sheet for a game and mail it back to the gaming company.<ref name=MayhemFeb93/> The company processes the turns and sends back turns sheets to the players so they can make subsequent moves.<ref name=MayhemFeb93/>\n\nR. Danard further separates a typical PBM turn into four parts. First, the company informs players on the results of the last turn. Next players conduct diplomatic activities, if desired. Then, they send their next turn sheets to the Game Master. Finally, the turn sheets are processed and the cycle is repeated. This continues until the game or a player is done.<ref>[[#Dan20|danard.net 2020]].</ref>\n\n===Diplomacy===\nAccording to ''Paper Mayhem'' assistant editor Jim Townsend, <blockquote>The most important aspect of PBM games is the diplomacy. If you don't communicate with the other players you will be labeled a \"loner,\" \"mute,\" or just plain \"dead meat.\" You must talk with the others to survive.<ref>[[#Tow87|Townsend 1987]]. p. 29.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Player roles===\nPlay-by-mail games provide a wide array of possible [[Role-playing game|roles to play]], from pirates to space characters to \"previously unknown creatures\".<ref name=Loth42>[[#Lot86|John Kevin Loth III 1986]]. p. 42.</ref> In the game ''[[Monster Island (play-by-mail game)|Monster Island]]'', players assume the role of a monster which explores a massive island.<ref>[[#Hel93|Helzer 1993]]. p. 12.</ref> And the title of the PBM game ''You're An Amoeba, GO!'' indicates an unusual role as players struggle \"in a 3D pool of primordial ooze [directing] the evolution of a legion of micro-organisms\".<ref>[[#Pap94|Paper Mayhem 1994]]. p. 42.</ref> Loth advises that closer identification with a role increases enjoyment, but a higher importance of this aspect requires more time searching for the right PBM game.<ref name=Loth42/>\n\n===Closed versus open ended===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth III, \"In theory, an open ended game lasts forever\" and there is no \"ultimate goal\" or way to win the game.<ref name=Loth42/> In open ended games, the designer has provided a system that enables players to develop with no upper limit. A drawback of this type is that mature games have \"factions of significant power and knowledge\" that can pose an unmanageable problem for the beginner\u2014although some may see this situation as a challenge of sorts.<ref name=Loth42/> Examples of open ended games are ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'',<ref>[[#Tow87a|Townsend 1987]]. p. 24.</ref> [[Monster Island (play-by-mail game)|''Monster Island'']],<ref>[[#DuB97|DuBois 1997]]. p. 4.</ref> and ''SuperNova: Rise of the Empire''.<ref>[[#Sus19|Suspense & Decision 2019]]. pp. 35\u201340.</ref> \n\nLoth states that most players in closed end games start equally and the games are \"faster paced, usually more intense...presenting frequent player confrontation; [and] the game terminates when a player or alliance of players has achieved specific conditions or eliminated all opposition\".<ref name=Loth42/> Examples of closed end games are ''[[Hyborian War]]'', ''[[It's a Crime (play-by-mail game)|It's a Crime]]'', and ''[[Starweb]]''.\n\n===Computer versus human moderated===\nIn the 1980s, play-by-mail gaming companies began leveraging computers to moderate games. To some degree this was an economic decision, as computers allowed the processing of more turns than humans, but with less of a human touch in the prose of a turn result. According to John Kevin Loth III, 100 percent computer moderated games would also kill a player's \"character or empire\" emotionlessly, regardless of effort invested.<ref name=Loth42/> Alternatively, Loth noted that those preferring exquisite pages of prose would gravitate toward 100 percent human moderation.<ref name=Loth42/> Loth provided ''Beyond the Quadra Zone'' and ''Earthwood'' as popular computer moderated examples in 1986 and ''Silverdawn'' and ''Sword Lords'' as 100 percent human moderated examples of the period.<ref name=Loth42/>\n\n===Complexity===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth, \"Novices should appreciate that some games are best played by veterans.\"<ref name=Loth42/> He noted in 1986 that Midguard was a \"very complex game\" with a 100-page instruction manual and \"255 possible line entries\".<ref name=Loth42/><ref name=Townsend88a/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' was \"the most complex game system on Earth\".<ref name=Townsend88a/> Other games, like Galactic Prisoners began simply and gradually increased in complexity.<ref name=Loth42/>\n\n==Cost and turn processing time==\nLoth noted that, in 1986, $3\u20135 per turn was the most prevalent cost.<ref name=Loth43>[[#Lot86a|John Kevin Loth III 1986]]. p. 43.</ref> At the time, some games were free, while some costed as much as $100 per turn.<ref name=Loth43/>\n\nPlay-by-mail magazine ''Paper Mayhem'' stated that the average turn processing time in 1987 was two weeks, and Loth noted that this was also the most popular.<ref>[[#Pap87d|Paper Mayhem Sep/Oct 1987]]. p. 1.</ref><ref name=Loth43/> In 1986, play-by-email was a nascent service only being offered by the largest PBM companies.<ref name=Loth43/>\n\n==Information sources==\nJohn Kevin Loth stated that, in 1986, the \"three major information sources in PBM\" were ''Paper Mayhem'', ''Flagship Magazine'', and the [[Play By Mail Association]].<ref name=Loth43/> Minor sources included magazines such as \"''[[Different Worlds]]'', [[Dragon (magazine)|''Dragon'']], ''[[Game New]]'', [[Imagine (game magazine)|''Imagine'']], and [[White Dwarf (magazine)|''White Dwarf'']]\".<ref name=Loth43/> Game and company-specific publications also provided significant information, as well as \"alliances, associations, and senior players\".<ref name=Loth43/> ''[[White Wolf Magazine]]'' also began a regular PBM column beginning in issue #11 as well as publishing an annual PBM issue beginning with issue #16.<ref>[[#Whi88|White Wolf 1988]]. p. 2.</ref><ref>[[#Whi89|White Wolf 1989]]. p. 1.</ref>\n\n''Flagship Magazine'' ran into the 21st Century, but ceased publication in 2010.

[[Correspondence chess]] has been played by mail for centuries. ''[[Diplomacy (board game)|Diplomacy]]'' has been played by mail since 1963, introducing a multi-player aspect to PBM games.<ref name=Babcock13>[[#Bab13|Babcock 2013]]. p. 16.</ref> [[Flying Buffalo Inc]] pioneered the first commercially available PBM game in 1970. A small number of PBM companies followed in the 1970s, with an explosion of hundreds of startup PBM companies in the 1980s at the peak of PBM gaming popularity, many of them small hobby companies\u2014more than 90 percent of which eventually folded. A number of independent PBM magazines also started in the 1980s, including ''[[Flagship magazine]]'', ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', and ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''. These magazines eventually went out of print, replaced in the 21st century by the online PBM journal ''[[Suspense and Decision]]''.\n\nPlay-by-mail games have a number of advantages and disadvantages related to other gaming genres. PBM games allow plenty of time\u2014sometimes days or weeks\u2014to consider moves or turns and players never run out of opponents to face. Additionally, the complexity of PBM games can be far beyond that allowed by a board game in an afternoon, and pits players against live opponents in these conditions, a challenge some players enjoy. Some games allow the number of opponents or teams in the dozens, even as high as fifty. PBM games also allow gamers to interact with others globally. And games with low turn costs compare well with expensive board or video games. Some drawbacks include the price for some PBM games with high setup and/or turn costs, and the lack of ability for face-to-face roleplaying. Additionally, for some players, some games can be overly complex, and delays in turn processing can be a negative.\n\nPlay-by-mail games are multifaceted. In their earliest form they involved two players alternatively sending moves directly to each other by postal mail, such as in correspondence chess. Multi-player games, such as ''Diplomacy'' or more complex games available today, involve a [[game master]] who receives, processes, and adjudicates turn results for players. These games also introduce the element of [[diplomacy]] in which participants can discuss gameplay with each other, strategize, and form [[alliances]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, turn results were sometimes adjudicated completely by humans. Over time, partial or complete turn adjudication by computer became the norm. Games also involve open and closed end variants. Open ended games do not end and players can develop their positions to the fullest extent possible, whereas in closed end games, players typically pursue a set of victory conditions until game conclusion. Finally, PBM games enable players to explore a diverse array of roles, from characters in fantasy or medieval settings, space operas, inner city gangs, or even more unusual ones such as assuming the role of microorganisms or monsters.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Postcard-for-correspondence-chess (trimmed image).png|thumb|right|Postcard for international correspondence chess]]\nThe earliest play-by-mail games developed as a way for geographically separated gamers to compete with each other using [[postal mail]]. [[Chess]] is the oldest example of this type. It has been played for hundreds of years in various countries by mail. In this two player game, players send moves directly to each other. Multi-player games emerged later. ''[[Diplomacy (game)|Diplomacy]]'' is an example of this type in which a central [[game master]] manages the game, receiving moves and publishing adjudications. ''Diplomacy'' was first played by mail in 1963.<ref name=Babcock13/> In the early 1970s, in the United States, [[Rick Loomis]], of [[Flying Buffalo Inc]], began a number of multi-player play-by-mail games;<ref>[[#Loo13|Loomis 2013]]. p. 38.</ref> this included games such as ''[[Nuclear Destruction (play-by-mail)|Nuclear Destruction]]'', which launched in 1970.<ref>[[#Fly20|Flying Buffalo 2020]].</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = \"[Rick Loomis] is generally recognized as the founder of the PBM industry.\"\n| source = \u2014 ''The Editors of Space Gamer Magazine, 1985''.<ref>[[#Edi85|The Editors 1985]]. p. 35.</ref>\n| width  = 27%\n| align  = left| style = padding:8px;\n}}\n\nThis began the professional PBM industry in the United States. Professional game moderation started in 1971 at Flying Buffalo which added games such as [[Battleplan (play-by-mail game)|''Battleplan'']], ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'', ''[[Starweb]]'', and others, which by the late 1980s were all computer moderated.<ref name=Townsend88a>[[#Tow88|Townsend 1988]]. p. 20.</ref> For approximately five years, Flying Buffalo was the single dominant company in the US PBM industry until [[Schubel & Son]] entered the field in \"roughly\" 1976 with the human-moderated ''[[The Tribes of Crane|Tribes of Crane]]'' game.<ref name=Townsend88a/> Schubel & Son introduced fee structure innovations which allowed players to pay additional fees for additional options or special actions outside of the rules. This provided players with larger bankrolls the advantage or the ability to abuse game systems.<ref name=Townsend88a/>\n\nThe next \"big entrance\" was [[Superior Simulations]] with its game ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' in 1978.<ref name=Townsend88a/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that it was \"the most complex game system on Earth\" with some large position turn results 1,000 pages in length.<ref name=Townsend88a/> By 1980, the PBM field was growing but still nascent: there were still only two sizable commercial PBM companies, and only a few small ones.<ref name=Popo90>[[#Pop90|Popolizio, Leblanc, and Popolizio 1990]]. p. 8.</ref> The most popular games of 1980 were ''Starweb'' and ''Tribes of Crane''.<ref name=Popo90/>\n\nSome players, unhappy with their experiences with Schubel & Son and Superior Simulations, launched their own company\u2014Adventures by Mail\u2014with game, ''[[Beyond the Stellar Empire (play-by-mail game)|''Beyond the Stellar Empire'']]'', which became \"immensely popular\".<ref name=Townsend88a/> In this same way, many people have launched PBM companies, trying their hand at finding the right mix of action and strategy for the gaming audience of the period. According to Jim Townsend: <blockquote>In the late 70's and all of the 80's, many small PBM firms have opened their doors and better than 90% of them have failed. Although PBM is an easy industry to get into, staying in business is another thing entirely. Literally hundreds of PBM companies have come and gone, most of them taking the money of would-be-customers with them.<ref name=Townsend88a/></blockquote>\n\nTownsend emphasized the risks for the PBM industry in that \"The new PBM company has such a small chance of surviving that no insurance company would write a policy to cover them. Skydivers are a better risk.\"<ref>[[#Tow89|Townsend 1989]]. p. 55.</ref> By the late 1980s, of the more than one hundred play-by-mail companies operating, the majority were hobbies\u2013not run as businesses to make money.<ref name=Townsend12>[[#Tow12|Townsend 1988]]. p. 19.</ref> Jim Townsend estimated that, in 1988, there were about a dozen profitable PBM companies in the United States\u2014with an additional few in the [[United Kingdom]] and the same in [[Australia]].<ref name=Townsend12/>\n\nThe proliferation of PBM companies in the 1980s supported the publication of a number of newsletters from individual play-by-mail companies as well as independent publications which focused solely on the play-by-mail gaming industry such as the relatively short-lived ''[[The Nuts & Bolts of PBM]]'' and ''[[Gaming Universal]]''. The PBM genre's \"two preeminent magazines\" of the period were [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] and ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''.<ref>[[#Pad93|Paduch 1993]]. p. RC21.</ref> Also in the mid-1980s, gamer magazines began carrying articles on PBM and run PBM advertisements, and the Origins Awards began a \"Best PBM Game\" category. \n\nThe 1990s brought the onset of the digital age of computers, with many gamers shifting to digital platforms versus play-by-mail games. But with the shift to the digital age has come new opportunities as well. PBM companies have introduced play-by-email (PBeM) options or games that are run in a turn-based fashion by email only.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the PBM industry still maintained some of the momentum from the 1980s. In 1993, ''Flagship'' magazine listed 185 active play-by-mail games.<ref>[[#Pro93|Procter 1993]]. p. 51.</ref> However, over time, the play-by-mail industry has gradually declined.\n\nIn 1998, ''Paper Mayhem'' magazine ceased publication suddenly after the unexpected death of its longtime editor in chief, David Webber.<ref>[[#Mui13|Muir 2013]]. p. 14.</ref> The last of the play-by-mail magazines started in the 1980s, ''Flagship'', went out of print in 2010. The number of remaining play-by-mail publications is relatively small\u2014mostly newsletters associated with play-by-mail companies, although ''[[Suspense and Decision]]'' remains as an independent online journal for play-by-mail gamers in the 21st century.<ref>[[#Sus20|Suspense & Decision 2020]].</ref>\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages of PBM gaming==\nJudith Proctor noted that play-by-mail games have a number of advantages. These include (1) plenty of time\u2014potentially days\u2014to plan a move, (2) never lacking players to face who have \"new tactics and ideas\", (3) the ability to play an \"incredibly complex\" game against live opponents, (4) meeting diverse gamers from far-away locations, and (5) relatively low costs.<ref>[[#Pro93a|Procter 1993]]. p. 51.</ref> Andrew Greenberg also pointed to the number of players possible in a multi-player game (\"as many as fifty teams\"), comparing it to his past failure at once trying to host an eleven-player [[Dungeons and Dragons]] Game.<ref name=Green93>[[#Gre93|Greenberg 1993]]. p. 51.</ref> \n\nGreenberg identified a number of drawbacks for play-by-mail games. He stated that the \"most obvious\" was the cost, because most games require a setup cost and a fee per turn, and some games can become expensive.<ref name=Green93/> Another drawback is the lack of face-to-face roleplaying inherent in play-by-mail games.<<ref name=Green93/> Finally, game complexity in some cases and occasional delays in turn processing can also be negatives in the genre.<ref name=Green93/>\n\n==Description==\nIn 1993, ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''\u2014a magazine for play-by-mail gamers\u2014described play-by-mail games thusly: <blockquote>PBM Games vary in the size of the games, turn around time, length of time a game lasts, and prices. An average PBM game has 10\u201320 players in it, but there are also games that have hundreds of players. Turn around time is the length of time it takes to get your turn back from a company. The average turnaround time is 2 weeks. Some games never end. They can go on virtually forever or until you decide to drop. Many games have victory conditions that can be achieved within a year or two. Prices vary for the different PBM games, but the average price per turn [in 1993] is about $5.00.<ref name=MayhemFeb93>[[#Fro93|Paper Mayhem Jan/Feb 1993]]. p. 1.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Mechanics===\nAfter the initial setup of a PBM game, players begin submitting turn orders. In general, players fill out a turn sheet for a game and mail it back to the gaming company.<ref name=MayhemFeb93/> The company processes the turns and sends back turns sheets to the players so they can make subsequent moves.<ref name=MayhemFeb93/>\n\nR. Danard further separates a typical PBM turn into four parts. First, the company informs players on the results of the last turn. Next players conduct diplomatic activities, if desired. Then, they send their next turn sheets to the Game Master. Finally, the turn sheets are processed and the cycle is repeated. This continues until the game or a player is done.<ref>[[#Dan20|danard.net 2020]].</ref>\n\n===Diplomacy===\nAccording to ''Paper Mayhem'' assistant editor Jim Townsend, <blockquote>The most important aspect of PBM games is the diplomacy. If you don't communicate with the other players you will be labeled a \"loner,\" \"mute,\" or just plain \"dead meat.\" You must talk with the others to survive.<ref>[[#Tow87|Townsend 1987]]. p. 29.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Player roles===\nPlay-by-mail games provide a wide array of possible [[Role-playing game|roles to play]], from pirates to space characters to \"previously unknown creatures\".<ref name=Loth42>[[#Lot86|John Kevin Loth III 1986]]. p. 42.</ref> In the game ''[[Monster Island (play-by-mail game)|Monster Island]]'', players assume the role of a monster which explores a massive island.<ref>[[#Hel93|Helzer 1993]]. p. 12.</ref> And the title of the PBM game ''You're An Amoeba, GO!'' indicates an unusual role as players struggle \"in a 3D pool of primordial ooze [directing] the evolution of a legion of micro-organisms\".<ref>[[#Pap94|Paper Mayhem 1994]]. p. 42.</ref> Loth advises that closer identification with a role increases enjoyment, but a higher importance of this aspect requires more time searching for the right PBM game.<ref name=Loth42/>\n\n===Closed versus open ended===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth III, \"In theory, an open ended game lasts forever\" and there is no \"ultimate goal\" or way to win the game.<ref name=Loth42/> In open ended games, the designer has provided a system that enables players to develop with no upper limit. A drawback of this type is that mature games have \"factions of significant power and knowledge\" that can pose an unmanageable problem for the beginner\u2014although some may see this situation as a challenge of sorts.<ref name=Loth42/> Examples of open ended games are ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'',<ref>[[#Tow87a|Townsend 1987]]. p. 24.</ref> [[Monster Island (play-by-mail game)|''Monster Island'']],<ref>[[#DuB97|DuBois 1997]]. p. 4.</ref> and ''SuperNova: Rise of the Empire''.<ref>[[#Sus19|Suspense & Decision 2019]]. pp. 35\u201340.</ref> \n\nLoth states that most players in closed end games start equally and the games are \"faster paced, usually more intense...presenting frequent player confrontation; [and] the game terminates when a player or alliance of players has achieved specific conditions or eliminated all opposition\".<ref name=Loth42/> Examples of closed end games are ''[[Hyborian War]]'', ''[[It's a Crime (play-by-mail game)|It's a Crime]]'', and ''[[Starweb]]''.\n\n===Computer versus human moderated===\nIn the 1980s, play-by-mail gaming companies began leveraging computers to moderate games. To some degree this was an economic decision, as computers allowed the processing of more turns than humans, but with less of a human touch in the prose of a turn result. According to John Kevin Loth III, 100 percent computer moderated games would also kill a player's \"character or empire\" emotionlessly, regardless of effort invested.<ref name=Loth42/> Alternatively, Loth noted that those preferring exquisite pages of prose would gravitate toward 100 percent human moderation.<ref name=Loth42/> Loth provided ''Beyond the Quadra Zone'' and ''Earthwood'' as popular computer moderated examples in 1986 and ''Silverdawn'' and ''Sword Lords'' as 100 percent human moderated examples of the period.<ref name=Loth42/>\n\n===Complexity===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth, \"Novices should appreciate that some games are best played by veterans.\"<ref name=Loth42/> He noted in 1986 that Midguard was a \"very complex game\" with a 100-page instruction manual and \"255 possible line entries\".<ref name=Loth42/><ref name=Townsend88a/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' was \"the most complex game system on Earth\".<ref name=Townsend88a/> Other games, like Galactic Prisoners began simply and gradually increased in complexity.<ref name=Loth42/>\n\n==Cost and turn processing time==\nLoth noted that, in 1986, $3\u20135 per turn was the most prevalent cost.<ref name=Loth43>[[#Lot86a|John Kevin Loth III 1986]]. p. 43.</ref> At the time, some games were free, while some costed as much as $100 per turn.<ref name=Loth43/>\n\nPlay-by-mail magazine ''Paper Mayhem'' stated that the average turn processing time in 1987 was two weeks, and Loth noted that this was also the most popular.<ref>[[#Pap87d|Paper Mayhem Sep/Oct 1987]]. p. 1.</ref><ref name=Loth43/> In 1986, play-by-email was a nascent service only being offered by the largest PBM companies.<ref name=Loth43/>\n\n==Information sources==\nJohn Kevin Loth stated that, in 1986, the \"three major information sources in PBM\" were ''Paper Mayhem'', ''Flagship Magazine'', and the [[Play By Mail Association]].<ref name=Loth43/> Minor sources included magazines such as \"''[[Different Worlds]]'', [[Dragon (magazine)|''Dragon'']], ''[[Game New]]'', [[Imagine (game magazine)|''Imagine'']], and [[White Dwarf (magazine)|''White Dwarf'']]\".<ref name=Loth43/> Game and company-specific publications also provided significant information, as well as \"alliances, associations, and senior players\".<ref name=Loth43/> ''[[White Wolf Magazine]]'' also began a regular PBM column beginning in issue #11 as well as publishing an annual PBM issue beginning with issue #16.<ref>[[#Whi88|White Wolf 1988]]. p. 2.</ref><ref>[[#Whi89|White Wolf 1989]]. p. 1.</ref>\n\n''Flagship Magazine'' ran into the 21st Century, but ceased publication in 2010. In November 2013, an online journal for play-by-mail games, [[Suspense and Decision]], began publication.<ref>[[#Sus13|Suspense & Decision 2013]].</ref> \n\n==See also==\n* [[List of play-by-mail games]]\n* [[Play-by-post role-playing game]]\n* [[Turn-based]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite magazine |last= Babcock|first= Chris  |date= December 2013|title= Diplomacy|url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue2.pdf |magazine= Suspense and Decision|location= |publisher= | issue = 2|pages= 16|accessdate= March 20, 2020|ref=Bab13}}\n* {{Cite magazine |last= DuBois |first= Steven |date=January\u2013February 1997 |title= Monster Island: A Review|magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=82|page= 4 |ref= DuB97}}\n* {{Cite magazine |first= |last= Editors|date=July\u2013August 1985 |title= Rick Loomis on Play-By-Mail [Editor Intro] |magazine= [[The Space Gamer]] |issue= #75|page= 35 |ref= Edi85}} \n* {{Cite magazine |last= Greenberg|first= Andrew |date=May\u2013June 1993 |title= PBM Corner: A Beginning in Play-By-Mail; Is it Worth It? |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]] |number=36|page= 51 |ref= Gre93}}\n* {{Cite magazine |last= Helzer|first= Herb |date= January\u2013February 1993 |title= Monster Island: Just One Destination for PBM Company |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=58|page= 12 |ref= Hel93}}\n* {{Cite magazine |last= Loomis|First= Rick|date=July\u2013August 1985 |title= Rick Loomis on Play-By-Mail |magazine= [[The Space Gamer]] |issue= #75|pages= 35\u201336 |ref= Loo85}} \n* {{Cite magazine |first= Rick|last= Loomis|date=May 1999 |title= The History of Play-by-Mail and Flying Buffalo |magazine= Flying Buffalo Quarterly |number=79|pages= 2\u20135 |url=http://flyingbuffalo.com/download/fbq79.pdf|accessdate= April 17, 2020|ref= Loo99}} \n* {{cite magazine |last= Loomis|first= Rick  |date= December 2013|title= Letter from Rick Loomis to the Play By Mail/Email/Web/Turn Based Games Community|url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue2.pdf |magazine= Suspense and Decision|location= |publisher= The Paper Mayhem Association| issue = 2|page= 38|accessdate= March 20, 2020|ref=Loo13}}\n* {{Cite magazine |first= John Kevin|last= Loth III|date=March\u2013April 1986 |title= A PBM Primer |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=17|page= 42 |ref= Lot86}}\n* {{Cite magazine |first= John Kevin|last= Loth III|date=March\u2013April 1986 |title= A PBM Primer |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=17|page= 43 |ref= Lot86a}}\n* {{cite magazine |last= Muir|first= Shannon|date= December 2013|title= Using Play By Mail in a Novel's Plot: The Story Behind for the Love of Airagos|url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue-5-Suspense&Decision.pdf|dead-url= |magazine= Suspense and Decision||issue= 5 |publisher= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date= February 15, 2020|ref= Mui13}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/nucdest.htm|title= Nuclear Destruction|author= |date= |work= Flying Buffalo, Inc|publisher= Flying Buffalo, Inc|accessdate= March 27, 2020|ref=Fly20}}\n* {{cite news |last= Paduch|first= Sally|date= June 27, 1993 |title= Email Brings Immediacy to Play-By-Mail Games|url= |work= New York Times|location= |page= RC21|access-date= |ref= Pad93}}\n* {{cite magazine |last1= Popolizio|first1= Mike |last2= LeBlanc|first2= Liz |last3= Popolizio|first3= Marti |date= January\u2013February 1990|title= Revamping a Classic!

Much like Alice, Wilma plays the strong-willed, level-headed person in her marriage, often criticizing Fred for pursuing his various ill-fated schemes. Wilma is often the one to bail out Fred when one of his schemes lands him in trouble or brings up the problem.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nSimilar to Fred Flintstones family, Wilma came from \"Arkanstone\" [Arkansas]. As a young adult, Wilma worked with Betty as a cigarette girl at a resort. There, they first met and fell in love with their future husbands, Fred and Barney, who were working there as bellhops.<ref name=\"bachelor\">\"Bachelor Daze,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref>\n\nWilma and Fred eventually married, and Wilma became a [[homemaker]], keeping house with such prehistoric aids as a baby [[elephant]] [[vacuum cleaner]] and [[pelican]] [[washing machine]]. Wilma is a good cook; one of her specialties is \"gravelberry pie,\" the recipe for which she eventually sold to the \"[[Safeway Inc.|Safestone]]\" supermarket chain.<ref>\"The Gravelberry Pie King,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 6</ref>  Wilma also enjoys volunteering for various charitable and women's organizations in Bedrock, shopping, and occasionally getting to meet the celebrities of their world, including [[Tony Curtis|Stony Curtis]],<ref>\"The Return of Stony Curtis,\" ''The Flintstones,'' season 6</ref> [[Rock Hudson|Rock Quarry]],<ref>\"The Rock Quarry Story,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> and [[James Darren|Jimmy Darrock]].<ref>\"Surfin' Fred,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 5</ref> Despite her petite appearance Wilma when she becomes angry is quite capabule of causing havoc: Such as knocking a prizefighter out with one blow <ref>\"\"The Engagement Ring\" season 1</ref>;  knocking out crooks with her stone purse<ref>\"The Soft Touchables\" Season 2</ref> or in fights with Fred Flintstone hitting him with a club <ref>\"The Flintstone Flyer\" season 1</ref> or a frying pan <ref>\"Hot Lips Hannigan\" season 1</ref>\n\nIn the original series' third season, Wilma becomes pregnant and gives birth to the couple's only child, Pebbles.\n\nWhen Pebbles is a teenager, Wilma gains employment as a [[reporter]] for one of Bedrock's [[newspaper]]s, the ''Daily Granite'' (a spoof of the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' of [[Superman]] fame), under editor Lou Granite (a parody of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show|The Mary Tyler Moore Show's]]'' [[Lou Grant (fictional character)|Lou Grant]]). While employed there, Wilma shares various adventures with prehistoric [[superhero]] [[Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels|Captain Caveman]], who, in a [[secret identity]], also works for the newspaper.<ref name=\"comedyshow\" />\n\nLater still, after Pebbles grows up and leaves home, Wilma starts a successful catering business with her neighbor and friend Betty, before becoming a [[grandmother]] to Pebbles' twin children, Chip and Roxy.<ref name=\"hollyrock\" />\n\n==Maiden name==\n[[File:Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06020 nevit.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Wilma and [[Fred Flintstone]] figurines, [[Ankara]] Amusement Park]]\nWilma's maiden name is the subject of a [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] error. Several early episodes in the original series clearly stated Wilma's maiden name was \"Pebble.\" In the second-season episode \"The Entertainer\", Wilma's old friend Greta Gravel remembers her as \"Wilma Pebble\", and in the third-season episode \"Dial S for Suspicion\", one of Wilma's old boyfriends, calls her \"Wilma Pebble.\"\n\nHowever, later episodes and spin-offs firmly state her maiden name is indeed \"Slaghoople\", based upon the name of Wilma's mother in the original series, Pearl Slaghoople. Flintstones' writer Earl Kress explained the discrepancy as such: \"Unfortunately, it's just as simple as [Hanna-Barbera] not caring about the continuity.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Wilma Flintstone: A fox in leopard clothing?|url=http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/story.html?id=400b0b01-ec31-42e1-8421-1cb78f133c7c&k=44564|publisher=Canada.com|accessdate=19 October 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622033230/http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/story.html?id=400b0b01-ec31-42e1-8421-1cb78f133c7c&k=44564|archivedate=22 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wilma Flintstone Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06018 nevit.jpg|thumb|120px|Wilma figurine.]]\n\n==Portrayal==\n[[Jean Vander Pyl]] was the original voice artist of Wilma until her death in 1999.<ref>{{cite news|title= Jean Vander Pyl; Cartoon Voice of Wilma Flintstone |publisher= The Los Angeles Times|date=1999-04-15|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1999/apr/15/news/mn-27591|accessdate=2010-08-24}}</ref>  Since then, [[Tress MacNeille]] has taken over as Wilma's voice.\n\nIn ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'', Wilma was voiced by [[Julie McWhirter|Julie McWhirter Dees]] and [[Elizabeth Lyn Frasier]] at different points.\n\nIn the live-action film ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]'', Wilma was played by [[Elizabeth Perkins]], although Vander Pyl made a cameo at Fred's surprise party (in the conga line behind [[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]]).

[[television]] [[animated series]] ''[[The Flintstones]]''. Wilma is the red-headed wife of [[caveman]] [[Fred Flintstone]], daughter of [[Pearl Slaghoople]], and mother of [[Pebbles Flintstone]]. Her best friend is her next door neighbor, [[Betty Rubble]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Meet Jean Vander Pyl, the Real Voice Behind Wilma Flintstone |publisher= The Los Angeles Times|date=1989-09-29|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-29/news/li-377_1_vander-pyl|accessdate=2010-08-24}}</ref>\n\nWilma's personality is based on that of [[Alice Kramden]], wife of [[Ralph Kramden]] on the 1950s television series ''[[The Honeymooners]]''. Much like Alice, Wilma plays the strong-willed, level-headed person in her marriage, often criticizing Fred for pursuing his various ill-fated schemes. Wilma is often the one to bail out Fred when one of his schemes lands him in trouble or brings up the problem.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nSimilar to Fred Flintstones family, Wilma came from \"Arkanstone\" [Arkansas]. As a young adult, Wilma worked with Betty as a cigarette girl at a resort. There, they first met and fell in love with their future husbands, Fred and Barney, who were working there as bellhops.<ref name=\"bachelor\">\"Bachelor Daze,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref>\n\nWilma and Fred eventually married, and Wilma became a [[homemaker]], keeping house with such prehistoric aids as a baby [[elephant]] [[vacuum cleaner]] and [[pelican]] [[washing machine]]. Wilma is a good cook; one of her specialties is \"gravelberry pie,\" the recipe for which she eventually sold to the \"[[Safeway Inc.|Safestone]]\" supermarket chain.<ref>\"The Gravelberry Pie King,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 6</ref>  Wilma also enjoys volunteering for various charitable and women's organizations in Bedrock, shopping, and occasionally getting to meet the celebrities of their world, including [[Tony Curtis|Stony Curtis]],<ref>\"The Return of Stony Curtis,\" ''The Flintstones,'' season 6</ref> [[Rock Hudson|Rock Quarry]],<ref>\"The Rock Quarry Story,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> and [[James Darren|Jimmy Darrock]].<ref>\"Surfin' Fred,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 5</ref> Despite her petite appearance Wilma when she becomes angry is quite capabule of causing havoc: Such as knocking a prizefighter out with one blow <ref>\"\"The Engagement Ring\" season 1</ref>;  knocking out crooks with her stone purse<ref>\"The Soft Touchables\" Season 2</ref> or in fights with Fred Flintstone hitting him with a club <ref>\"The Flintstone Flyer\" season 1</ref> or a frying pan <ref>\"Hot Lips Hannigan\" season 1</ref>\n\nIn the original series' third season, Wilma becomes pregnant and gives birth to the couple's only child, Pebbles.\n\nWhen Pebbles is a teenager, Wilma gains employment as a [[reporter]] for one of Bedrock's [[newspaper]]s, the ''Daily Granite'' (a spoof of the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' of [[Superman]] fame), under editor Lou Granite (a parody of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show|The Mary Tyler Moore Show's]]'' [[Lou Grant (fictional character)|Lou Grant]]). While employed there, Wilma shares various adventures with prehistoric [[superhero]] [[Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels|Captain Caveman]], who, in a [[secret identity]], also works for the newspaper.<ref name=\"comedyshow\" />\n\nLater still, after Pebbles grows up and leaves home, Wilma starts a successful catering business with her neighbor and friend Betty, before becoming a [[grandmother]] to Pebbles' twin children, Chip and Roxy.<ref name=\"hollyrock\" />\n\n==Maiden name==\n[[File:Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06020 nevit.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Wilma and [[Fred Flintstone]] figurines, [[Ankara]] Amusement Park]]\nWilma's maiden name is the subject of a [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] error. Several early episodes in the original series clearly stated Wilma's maiden name was \"Pebble.\" In the second-season episode \"The Entertainer\", Wilma's old friend Greta Gravel remembers her as \"Wilma Pebble\", and in the third-season episode \"Dial S for Suspicion\", one of Wilma's old boyfriends, calls her \"Wilma Pebble.\"\n\nHowever, later episodes and spin-offs firmly state her maiden name is indeed \"Slaghoople\", based upon the name of Wilma's mother in the original series, Pearl Slaghoople. Flintstones' writer Earl Kress explained the discrepancy as such: \"Unfortunately, it's just as simple as [Hanna-Barbera] not caring about the continuity.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Wilma Flintstone: A fox in leopard clothing?|url=http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/story.html?id=400b0b01-ec31-42e1-8421-1cb78f133c7c&k=44564|publisher=Canada.com|accessdate=19 October 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622033230/http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/story.html?id=400b0b01-ec31-42e1-8421-1cb78f133c7c&k=44564|archivedate=22 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wilma Flintstone Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06018 nevit.jpg|thumb|120px|Wilma figurine.]]\n\n==Portrayal==\n[[Jean Vander Pyl]] was the original voice artist of Wilma until her death in 1999.<ref>{{cite news|title= Jean Vander Pyl; Cartoon Voice of Wilma Flintstone |publisher= The Los Angeles Times|date=1999-04-15|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1999/apr/15/news/mn-27591|accessdate=2010-08-24}}</ref>  Since then, [[Tress MacNeille]] has taken over as Wilma's voice.\n\nIn ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'', Wilma was voiced by [[Julie McWhirter|Julie McWhirter Dees]] and [[Elizabeth Lyn Frasier]] at different points.\n\nIn the live-action film ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]'', Wilma was played by [[Elizabeth Perkins]], although Vander Pyl made a cameo at Fred's surprise party (in the conga line behind [[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]]).

Reasons for becoming a single parent include divorce, break-up, abandonment, death of the other parent, childbirth by a single woman or single-person adoption. A ''single parent family'' is a family with children that is headed by a single parent.<ref>Miriam-Webster Dictionary [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/single%20parent single parent, noun]</ref><ref>Collins English Dictionary [https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/single-parent single parent]</ref><ref>US Legal, [https://definitions.uslegal.com/s/single-parent/ Single Parent Law and Legal Definition]</ref><ref>The Social History of the American Family: An Encyclopedia, [http://edge.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/10.7_Single-Parent_Families.pdf Single-Parent Families], Sage Publications</ref>\n\n==History==\nSingle parenthood has been common historically due to parental [[mortality rate]] due to [[disease]], [[war]]s and [[maternal mortality]].

Low-income women are less likely to receive mental health care for numerous reasons. Mental health services remain inequitable for low-income, more so, low-income single women are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, and other poor mental health outcomes. Researchers Copeland and Snyder (2011) addressed the barriers low-income single mothers have on receiving mental health care, \"Visible barriers often include the lack of community resources, transportation, child care, convenient hours, and financial resources.\" Meanwhile, low-income single mothers are more likely to bring their children in for mental health treatment than themselves. Researchers Copeland and Snyder analyzed sixty-four African American mothers who brought their children in for mental health treatment. These mothers were than screened for mild, moderate, and severe depression and/or anxiety. After three months the researchers used an ethnographic interview to address whether or not the participants used mental health services that were referred to them. Results indicated that the majority of the participants did not use the referred mental health care services for reasons that included: fear of losing their children, being hospitalized and/or stigmatized by their community counterparts.<ref>Copeland, Valire C. & Kimberly Snyder. 2011. \u201cBarriers to Mental Health Treatment Services for Low-Income African American Women Whose Children Receive Behavioral Health Services: An Ethnographic Investigation.\u201d Social Work in Public Health \t26:1, 78\u201395</ref>\n\n== Impact on children ==\nAccording to [[David Blankenhorn]],<ref>Blankenhorn, 1995 D.

[[Physical custody]] refers to which parent the child lives with. Among divorced parents, \"parallel parenting\" refers to parenting after divorce in which each parent does so independently; this is most common. In comparison, cooperative parenting occurs when the parents involved in the child's life work together around all involved parties' schedules and activities, and this is far less common. After a certain \"crisis period,\" most children resume normal development; however, their future relationships are often affected, as they lack a model upon which to base a healthy long term relationship. Nonetheless, as adults children of divorcees cope better with change.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=A.L.|author2=Ben-Ami, N.|title=Adult Recall of Childhood psychological maltreatment in \"Adult Children of divorce\": Prevalence and associations with concurrent measures of well being|journal=Journal of Divorce & Remarriage|volume=52|issue=4|pages=203\u2013219|doi=10.1080/10502556.2011.556973|year=2011|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e1a8a51b477457673e4e3f20146b637fc9a567cc}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=D.A.|author2=Woodside, M.|title=Resilience in adult children of divorce: A multiple case study|journal=Marriage & Family Review|volume=47|issue=4|pages=213\u2013234|doi=10.1080/01494929.2011.586300|year=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cherlin|first=Andrew|title=Public and Private Families|year=2010|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-340435-6}}</ref>\n\nChildren are affected by divorce in many different ways, varying by the circumstances and age of the child. Young children ages two to six are generally the most fearful of parental separation, and often feel abandoned or confused. Both boys and girls have the same amount of trouble coping, but often show this in different ways. Nonetheless this age group adapts best to their situations, as they are often too young to remember their non-custodial parent vividly. Children ages seven to twelve are much better at expressing emotions and accepting parentage breakage, but often distrust their parents, rely on outside help and support for encouragement, and may manifest social and academic problems. Adolescents cope the worst with divorce; they often struggle most with the change, and may even turn away from their family entirely, dealing with their situation on their own. They often have problems expressing feelings, similar to far younger children, and may have adjustment issues with long-term relationships due to these feelings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher = Psych Page | last=Niolon, PhD|first=Richard|title=Children of Divorce and Adjustment| url= http://www.psychpage.com/family/divorce/childrenadjust.html|accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref> Keeping in touch with both parents and having a healthy relationship with both mother and father appears to have the most effect on a child's behavior; which leads to an easier time coping with the divorce as well as development through the child's life.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hess|first=Robert D.|last2=Camara|first2=Kathleen A.|date=1979-10-01|title=Post-Divorce Family Relationships as Mediating Factors in the Consequences of Divorce for Children|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=79\u201396|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1979.tb00814.x|issn=1540-4560}}</ref> Children will do better with their parents divorce if they have a smooth adjustment period.

As well as instability \"fragile families\" are often limited in resources such as human capital and financial resources, the kids that come from these families are more likely to be hindered within school and don't succeed as well as kids who have strictly single parents or two parent homes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Waldfogel|first=Jane|last2=Craigie|first2=Terry-Ann|last3=Brooks-Gunn|first3=Jeanne|date=2010-01-01|title=Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing|journal=The Future of Children |volume=20|issue=2|pages=87\u2013112|issn=1054-8289|pmc=3074431|pmid=20964133|doi=10.1353/foc.2010.0002}}</ref> Usually within these families the father plans to stick around and help raise the child but once the child is born the fathers do not stay for much longer and only one third stay after five years of the child's birth.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McLanahan|first=Sara|last2=Beck|first2=Audrey N.|date=2010-01-01|title=Parental relationships in fragile families|journal=The Future of Children|volume=20|issue=2|pages=17\u201337|issn=1054-8289|pmc=3053572|pmid=20964130|doi=10.1353/foc.2010.0007}}</ref> Most of these fragile families come from low economic status to begin with and the cycle appears to continue; once the child grows up they are just as likely to still be poor and live in poverty as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McLanahan|first=Sara|date=2009-01-01|title=Fragile Families and the Reproduction of Poverty|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|language=en|volume=621|issue=1|pages=111\u2013131|doi=10.1177/0002716208324862|issn=0002-7162|pmc=2831755|pmid=20204078}}</ref> Most fragile families end with the mother becoming a single parent, leaving it even more difficult to come out of the poverty cycle.

Others choose to adopt. Typically referred to in the West as \"Single Mothers by Choice\" or \"Choice Moms\" though, fathers also (less commonly) may choose to become single parents through adoption or surrogacy. Many turn to single parenthood by choice after not finding the right person to raise children with, and for women, it often comes out of a desire to have biological children before it is too late to do so.\n\n===Single-parent adoption===\n[[File:Doing the best she can.jpg|thumb|right|A single mother and child]]\n\n====History of single parent adoptions====\nSingle parent adoptions have existed since the mid 19th century. Men were rarely considered as adoptive parents, and were considered far less desired. Often, children adopted by a single person were raised in pairs rather than alone, and many adoptions by lesbians and gay men were arranged as single parent adoptions. During the mid 19th century many state welfare officials made it difficult if not impossible for single persons to adopt, as agencies searched for \"normal\" families with married men and women. In 1965, the Los Angeles Bureau of Adoptions sought single African-Americans for African-American orphans for whom married families could not be found. In 1968, the [[Child Welfare League of America]] stated that married couples were preferred, but there were \"exceptional circumstances\" where single parent adoptions were permissible.<ref name=\"Single Parent Adoptions\">{{cite web|title=Single Parent Adoptions | url= http://pages.uoregon.edu/adoption/topics/singleparentadoptions.htm |work=The Adoption History Project| publisher= University of Oregon|date =  24 February 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nNot much has changed with the adoption process since the 1960s.

Single-parent households tend to find difficulty with the lack of help they receive. More often than not a single parent finds it difficult to find help because there is a lack of support, whether it be a second parent or other family members. This tends to put a strain on not only the parent but also the relationship between the parent and their child.  Furthermore, dependency is a hardship that many parents find difficult to overcome.  As the single parent becomes closer to their child, the child grows more and more dependent upon that parent.  This dependency, while common, may reach far past childhood, damaging the child due to their lack of independence from their parent. \"Social isolation of single parents might be a stress factor that they transmit to children. Another explanation may be that the parents do not have the time needed to support and supervise their children. This can have a negative impact on the child.\"<ref name=\"Children in Single Parent Homes and Emotional Problems\">{{cite news |title = Children in Single Parent Homes and Emotional Problems |first = Erica |last = Williams |date = February 6, 2003 |newspaper = The Hilltop |url = http://www.thehilltoponline.com/2.4839/children-in-single-parent-homes-and-emotional-problems-1.472758 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090403002923/http://www.thehilltoponline.com/2.4839/children-in-single-parent-homes-and-emotional-problems-1.472758 |url-status = dead |archive-date = April 3, 2009 |publisher = Howard University |accessdate = 14 November 2011 }}</ref>\n\nJust as above, it has been found that little 'specific' research to the positives of the father as a single parent has been done; however, there are various proven pros that accompany single parenting.  One proven statistic about single fathers states that a single father tends to use more positive parenting techniques than a married father.  As far as non-specific pros, a strong bond tends to be formed between parent and child in single-parenting situations, allowing for an increase in maturity and closeness in the household.  Gender roles are also less likely to be enforced in a single parent home because the work and chores are more likely to be shared among all individuals rather than specifically a male or female.<ref name=\"Single Parenting\">{{cite web|title=Better Health Channel|url=http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/single_parenting?open|work=Online Article|publisher=State Government of Victoria|accessdate=2 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020121402/http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Single_parenting?open|archivedate=20 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== Living arrangements for single parents ====\nThe newest census  that the majority of America\u2019s 73.7 million children under age 18 live in families with two parents (69 percent), according to new statistics released from the U.S. Census Bureau.

Low-income women are less likely to receive mental health care for numerous reasons. Mental health services remain inequitable for low-income, more so, low-income single women are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, and other poor mental health outcomes. Researchers Copeland and Snyder (2011) addressed the barriers low-income single mothers have on receiving mental health care, \"Visible barriers often include the lack of community resources, transportation, child care, convenient hours, and financial resources.\" Meanwhile, low-income single mothers are more likely to bring their children in for mental health treatment than themselves. Researchers Copeland and Snyder analyzed sixty-four African American mothers who brought their children in for mental health treatment.

There are many parents who may single parent, but do so without official custody, further biasing statistics.\n\n====Children and divorce====\n{{See also|Implications of divorce}}\n\n[[Child custody]] in reference to [[divorce]] refers to which parent is allowed to make important decisions about the children involved. [[Physical custody]] refers to which parent the child lives with. Among divorced parents, \"parallel parenting\" refers to parenting after divorce in which each parent does so independently; this is most common. In comparison, cooperative parenting occurs when the parents involved in the child's life work together around all involved parties' schedules and activities, and this is far less common. After a certain \"crisis period,\" most children resume normal development; however, their future relationships are often affected, as they lack a model upon which to base a healthy long term relationship. Nonetheless, as adults children of divorcees cope better with change.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=A.L.|author2=Ben-Ami, N.|title=Adult Recall of Childhood psychological maltreatment in \"Adult Children of divorce\": Prevalence and associations with concurrent measures of well being|journal=Journal of Divorce & Remarriage|volume=52|issue=4|pages=203\u2013219|doi=10.1080/10502556.2011.556973|year=2011|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e1a8a51b477457673e4e3f20146b637fc9a567cc}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=D.A.|author2=Woodside, M.|title=Resilience in adult children of divorce: A multiple case study|journal=Marriage & Family Review|volume=47|issue=4|pages=213\u2013234|doi=10.1080/01494929.2011.586300|year=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cherlin|first=Andrew|title=Public and Private Families|year=2010|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-340435-6}}</ref>\n\nChildren are affected by divorce in many different ways, varying by the circumstances and age of the child. Young children ages two to six are generally the most fearful of parental separation, and often feel abandoned or confused. Both boys and girls have the same amount of trouble coping, but often show this in different ways. Nonetheless this age group adapts best to their situations, as they are often too young to remember their non-custodial parent vividly. Children ages seven to twelve are much better at expressing emotions and accepting parentage breakage, but often distrust their parents, rely on outside help and support for encouragement, and may manifest social and academic problems. Adolescents cope the worst with divorce; they often struggle most with the change, and may even turn away from their family entirely, dealing with their situation on their own. They often have problems expressing feelings, similar to far younger children, and may have adjustment issues with long-term relationships due to these feelings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher = Psych Page | last=Niolon, PhD|first=Richard|title=Children of Divorce and Adjustment| url= http://www.psychpage.com/family/divorce/childrenadjust.html|accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref> Keeping in touch with both parents and having a healthy relationship with both mother and father appears to have the most effect on a child's behavior; which leads to an easier time coping with the divorce as well as development through the child's life.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hess|first=Robert D.|last2=Camara|first2=Kathleen A.|date=1979-10-01|title=Post-Divorce Family Relationships as Mediating Factors in the Consequences of Divorce for Children|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=79\u201396|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1979.tb00814.x|issn=1540-4560}}</ref> Children will do better with their parents divorce if they have a smooth adjustment period.

Others choose to adopt. Typically referred to in the West as \"Single Mothers by Choice\" or \"Choice Moms\" though, fathers also (less commonly) may choose to become single parents through adoption or surrogacy. Many turn to single parenthood by choice after not finding the right person to raise children with, and for women, it often comes out of a desire to have biological children before it is too late to do so.\n\n===Single-parent adoption===\n[[File:Doing the best she can.jpg|thumb|right|A single mother and child]]\n\n====History of single parent adoptions====\nSingle parent adoptions have existed since the mid 19th century. Men were rarely considered as adoptive parents, and were considered far less desired. Often, children adopted by a single person were raised in pairs rather than alone, and many adoptions by lesbians and gay men were arranged as single parent adoptions. During the mid 19th century many state welfare officials made it difficult if not impossible for single persons to adopt, as agencies searched for \"normal\" families with married men and women. In 1965, the Los Angeles Bureau of Adoptions sought single African-Americans for African-American orphans for whom married families could not be found. In 1968, the [[Child Welfare League of America]] stated that married couples were preferred, but there were \"exceptional circumstances\" where single parent adoptions were permissible.<ref name=\"Single Parent Adoptions\">{{cite web|title=Single Parent Adoptions | url= http://pages.uoregon.edu/adoption/topics/singleparentadoptions.htm |work=The Adoption History Project| publisher= University of Oregon|date =  24 February 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nNot much has changed with the adoption process since the 1960s.

Single-parent households tend to find difficulty with the lack of help they receive. More often than not a single parent finds it difficult to find help because there is a lack of support, whether it be a second parent or other family members. This tends to put a strain on not only the parent but also the relationship between the parent and their child.  Furthermore, dependency is a hardship that many parents find difficult to overcome.  As the single parent becomes closer to their child, the child grows more and more dependent upon that parent.  This dependency, while common, may reach far past childhood, damaging the child due to their lack of independence from their parent. \"Social isolation of single parents might be a stress factor that they transmit to children. Another explanation may be that the parents do not have the time needed to support and supervise their children.

One proven statistic about single fathers states that a single father tends to use more positive parenting techniques than a married father.  As far as non-specific pros, a strong bond tends to be formed between parent and child in single-parenting situations, allowing for an increase in maturity and closeness in the household.

In 2010 declared the [[Celebration of Mexican political anniversaries in 2010|Bicentennial]] Dessert of Mexico.]]\n\t\n'''Mexican cuisine''' began about 9000 years ago, when agricultural communities such as the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] formed, domesticating [[maize]], creating the standard process of [[maize]] [[nixtamalization]], and establishing their [[Maya cuisine|foodways]]. Successive waves of other [[Mesoamerica]]n groups brought with them their own cooking methods. These included the [[Olmec]], [[Teotihuacan]]os, [[Toltec]], [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], [[Otomi people|Otomi]], [[Tarascan state|Pur\u00e9pecha]], [[Totonac]], [[Mazatec]], and [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]].\n\nThe [[Mexica]] establishment of the [[Aztec Empire]] created a multi-ethnic society where many different foodways became [[Aztec cuisine|infused]]. The staples are native foods, such as corn ([[maize]]), [[bean]]s, [[squash (plant)|squash]], [[amaranth]], [[Chia seed|chia]], [[avocado]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[tomatillo]]s, [[cocoa bean|cacao]], [[vanilla]], [[agave]], [[turkey meat|turkey]], [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)#Historical use|spirulina]], [[sweet potato]], [[Cactus#Food|cactus]], and [[chili pepper]].\n\nAfter the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] in the 16th century and the subsequent [[Spanish_conquest_of_Yucat\u00e1n|conquest of the Maya area]], Europeans introduced a number of  [[European cuisine|other foods]], the most important of which were meats from domesticated animals ([[beef]], [[pork]], [[chicken]], [[goat]], and [[sheep]]), dairy products (especially cheese and milk), and [[rice]]. While the Spanish initially tried to impose their own diet on the country, this was not possible.\n\n[[Asian cuisine|Asian]] and [[African cuisine|African influences]] were also introduced into the [[indigenous cuisine]] during this era as a result of [[Afro-Mexican#African slavery in Mexico|African slavery in New Spain]] and the [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon]]s.<ref name=\"CONACULTA\">{{cite web|title= La cocina del virreinato| url=http://sic.conaculta.gob.mx/ficha.php?table=gastronomia&table_id=101 |publisher=[[CONACULTA]] |accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nOver the centuries, this resulted in regional cuisines based on local conditions, such as those in [[Oaxaca]], [[Veracruz]] and the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. Mexican cuisine is an important aspect of the culture, social structure and popular traditions of Mexico. The most important example of this connection is the use of [[Mole sauce|mole]] for special occasions and holidays, particularly in the South and Central regions of the country. For this reason and others, traditional Mexican cuisine was inscribed in 2010 on the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=\"UNESCO\">{{cite web |url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/traditional-mexican-cuisine-ancestral-ongoing-community-culture-the-michoacan-paradigm-00400 |title=Traditional Mexican cuisine - ancestral, ongoing community culture, the Michoac\u00e1n paradigm |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=January 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Basic elements==\n[[File:Still-life_by_Jos\u00e9_Agust\u00edn_Arrieta,_San_Diego_Museum_of_Art.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Still-life, oil on canvas painting by [[Agust\u00edn Arrieta|Jos\u00e9 Agust\u00edn Arrieta]] (Mexican), c. 1870, San Diego Museum of Art]]\n[[File:Huitlacoche, quintoniles, huauhzontles, flor de calabaza et al., Santa Maria la Ribera Market.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ingredients at a market in Mexico City, including [[Amaranthus hybridus|quintoniles]], [[huauzontle]], [[huitlacoche]] and [[Squash blossom|squash flowers]].]]\n\nMexican cuisine is a complex and ancient cuisine, with techniques and skills developed over thousands of years of history.<ref name=\"fife\">{{cite journal |last= MacNeil-Fife |first= Karen |date=September 2000 |title= Beyond beer: Wine with Mexican food |journal=Sunset |volume=205 |issue=3 |page=194 }}</ref> It is created mostly with ingredients native to [[Mexico]], as well as those [[Columbian Exchange|brought over]] by the [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s, with some new influences since then.<ref name=\"malat88\">Malat, p. 88.</ref> Mexican cuisine has been influenced by its proximity to the US-Mexican border. For example, burritos were thought to have been invented for easier transportation of beans by wrapping them in [[tortillas]] for field labor. Modifications like these brought Mexican cuisine to the [[United States]], where states like Arizona further adapted burritos by deep frying them, creating the modern [[chimichanga]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/963509617|title=|website=ProQuest}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to staples, such as corn and chile peppers, native ingredients include [[tomato]]es, [[Squash (plant)|squashes]], [[avocado]]s, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[vanilla]],<ref name=\"UNESCO\" /> as well as ingredients not generally used in other cuisines, such as [[edible flowers]], vegetables like [[huauzontle]] and [[Porophyllum ruderale|papaloquelite]], or small [[avocado#history|criollo]] avocados, whose skin is edible.<ref name=\"adapon11\">Adapon, p. 11.</ref> [[Chocolate]] originated in Mexico and was prized by the Aztecs.

While it is eaten fresh, most corn is dried, [[Nixtamalization|nixtamalized]] and ground into a dough called ''[[masa]]''.<ref name=\"iturr43\">Iturriaga, p. 43.</ref><ref name=\"othergods\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2093-rice-the-gift-of-the-other-gods |title= Rice: The Gift Of The Other Gods |first=Karen Hursh | last = Graber |date= January 1, 2003  |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=October 24, 2012 }}</ref> This dough is used both fresh and fermented to make a wide variety of dishes from drinks (atole, pozol, etc.) to tamales, [[sope]]s, and much more. However, the most common way to eat corn in Mexico is in the form of a tortilla, which accompanies almost every dish. Tortillas are made of corn in most of the country, but other versions exist, such as wheat in the north or [[Cooking banana|plantain]], [[yuca]] and wild greens in [[Oaxaca]].<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/><ref name=\"iturr43\"/>\n\n===Chili peppers===\n[[File:Chile Rellenos.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chile relleno]]s, stuffed Chile peppers.]]\n\nThe other basic ingredient in all parts of Mexico is the [[Chili pepper|chile pepper]].<ref name=\"adapon7\">Adapon, p. 7.</ref> Mexican food has a reputation for being very spicy, but it has a wide range of flavors and while many spices are used for cooking, not all are spicy. Many dishes also have subtle flavors.<ref name=\"fife\"/><ref name=\"adapon11\"/> Chiles are indigenous to Mexico and their use dates back thousands of years. They are used for their flavors and not just their heat, with Mexico using the widest variety. If a savory dish or snack does not contain chile pepper, hot sauce is usually added, and chile pepper is often added to fresh fruit and sweets.<ref name=\"adapon7\"/>\n\n[[File:Molcajete y tejolote.jpg|thumb|A [[molcajete]] and tejolote, the traditional [[mortar and pestle]] of Mexico.]]\n\nThe importance of the chile goes back to the [[Mesoamerican]] period, where it was considered to be as much of a staple as corn and beans. In the 16th century, [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] wrote that without chiles, the [[indigenous people]] did not think they were eating. Even today, most [[Mexicans]] believe that their national identity would be at a loss without chiles and the many varieties of sauces and salsas created using chiles as their base.<ref name=\"adapon8\">Adapon, p. 8.</ref>\n\nMany dishes in Mexico are defined by their sauces and the chiles those sauces contain (which are usually very spicy), rather than the meat or vegetable that the sauce covers. These dishes include [[entomatada]] (in tomato sauce), [[adobo]] or adobados, pipians and [[Mole sauce|moles]]. A hominy soup called [[pozole]] is defined as white, green or red depending on the chile sauce used or omitted. Tamales are differentiated by the filling which is again defined by the sauce (red or green chile pepper strips or mole). Dishes without a sauce are rarely eaten without a salsa or without fresh or pickled chiles. This includes street foods, such as [[taco]]s, [[torta]]s, [[Chicken soup#Mexico|soup]], [[sope]]s, [[tlacoyo]]s, [[tlayuda]]s, [[gordita]]s and [[sincronizada]]s.<ref name=\"adapon114\">Adapon, p. 114.</ref> For most dishes, it is the type of chile used that gives it its main flavor.<ref name=\"adapon8\"/>  [[Chipotle]],  smoked-dried jalape\u00f1o pepper, is very common in Mexican cuisine.\n\n===Spanish contributions===\n{{See also|Cheeses of Mexico}}\n[[File:Pechuga Adobada.jpg|thumb|''Pechuga [[adobada]]'', chicken breast in [[adobo]] with a side of [[chayote]], mushrooms, corn and [[Poblano|poblano rajas]]. Adobo, including a key item, [[vinegar]], arrived with the Spanish. A common characteristic of Mexican adobo is its incorporation of [[chile ancho]].]]\n\nNext to corn, [[rice]] is the most common grain in Mexican cuisine. According to food writer Karen Hursh Graber, the initial introduction of rice to Spain from [[North Africa]] in the 14th century led to the Spanish introduction of rice to Mexico at the port of Veracruz in the 1520s. This, Graber says, created one of the earliest instances of the world's greatest [[Fusion cuisine]]s.\n\nSome of the main contributions of the Spanish were several kind of meat, dairy products and wheat to name few, as the Mesoamerican diet contained very little meat besides [[domesticated turkey]], and dairy products were absent. The Spanish also introduced the technique of frying in [[Lard|pork fat]]. Today, the main meats found in Mexico are pork, chicken, beef, goat, and sheep. Native seafood and [[Fish as food|fish]] remains popular, especially along the coasts.<ref name=\"malat8889\">Malat, pp. 88-89.</ref>\n\n[[Cheeses of Mexico|Cheesemaking in Mexico]] has evolved its own specialties. It is an important economic activity, especially in the north, and is frequently done at home. The main cheese making areas are [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Quer\u00e9taro]], and [[Chiapas]].

This refers to [[dinner]] or [[supper]]. It sometimes begins with [[soup]], often [[chicken broth]] with [[pasta]] or a \"dry soup\", which is pasta or rice flavored with [[onions]], [[garlic]] or vegetables.

Food preparation, especially for family and social events, is considered to be an investment in order to maintain social relationships.<ref name=\"adapon20\">Adapon, p. 20.</ref> Even the idea of flavor is considered to be social, with meals prepared for certain dinners and certain occasions when they are considered the most tasty.<ref name=\"adapon117\">Adapon, p. 117.</ref>\n\nThe ability to cook well, called \"saz\u00f3n\" (lit. seasoning) is considered to be a gift generally gained from experience and a sense of commitment to the diners.<ref name=\"abarca62\">Abarca, p. 62.</ref>  For the [[Day of the Dead]] festival, foods such as tamales and mole are set out on altars and it is believed that the visiting dead relatives eat the essence of the food. If eaten afterwards by the living it is considered to be tasteless.<ref name=\"adapon117\"/> In central Mexico, the main festival foods are mole, [[barbacoa]], [[carnitas]] and [[mixiote]]s. They are often prepared to feed hundreds of guests, requiring groups of cooks. The cooking is part of the social custom meant to bind families and communities.<ref name=\"adapon89\">Adapon, p. 89.</ref>\n\n[[File:Barbacoa (en Hidalgo).JPG|miniaturadeimagen|220px|left|thumb|Barbacoa in [[Actopan (Hidalgo)|Actopan]], [[Estado de Hidalgo|Hidalgo]]. The barbecue in a ground oven is a typical dish from the Mezquital Valley.]]\n[[File:Caf\u00e9_de_olla_.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Fruit punch]] is popular around Christmas time during [[Las Posadas]].]]\n\nMexican regional home cooking is completely different from the food served in most Mexican restaurants outside Mexico, which is usually some variety of [[Tex-Mex]].<ref name=\"adapon11\"/> Some of Mexico's traditional foods involved complex or long cooking processes. Before industrialization, traditional women spent several hours a day boiling dried corn then grinding it on a [[metate]] to make the dough for tortillas, cooking them one-by-one on a [[Comal (cookware)|comal]] griddle. In some areas, tortillas are still made this way. Sauces and salsas were also ground in a mortar called a [[molcajete]]. Today, blenders are more often used, though the texture is a bit different. Most people in Mexico would say that those made with a molcajete taste better, but few do this now.<ref name=\"adapon15\">Adapon, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe most important food for festivals and other special occasions is [[Mole sauce|mole]], especially mole poblano in the center of the country.<ref name=\"adapon89\" /><ref name=\"adapon97\">Adapon, p. 97.</ref> Mole is served at Christmas, Easter, Day of the Dead and at birthdays, baptisms, weddings and funerals, and tends to be eaten only for special occasions because it is such a complex and time-consuming dish.<ref name=\"adapon89\" /><ref name=\"adapon99\">Adapon, p. 99.</ref> While still dominant in this way, other foods have become acceptable for these occasions, such as barbacoa, carnitas and mixiotes, especially since the 1980s. This may have been because of economic crises at that time, allowing for the substitution of these cheaper foods, or the fact that they can be bought ready-made or may already be made as part of the family business.<ref name=\"adapon101\" /><ref name=\"adapon107\">Adapon, p. 107.</ref>\n\nAnother important festive food is the [[tamale]], also known as ''tamal'' in Spanish. This is a filled cornmeal dumpling, steamed in a wrapping (usually a corn [[husk]] or banana leaf) and one of the basic staples in most regions of Mexico. It has its origins in the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Hispanic era]] and today is found in many varieties in all of Mexico. Like mole, it is complicated to prepare and best done in large amounts.<ref name=\"knepp\">{{Cite thesis |type=PhD |chapter= |title=Tamaladas and the role of food in Mexican-immigrant and Mexican-American cultures in Texas |last= Knepp |first= Mark Dustin |year=2010 |publisher= State University of New York at Albany |docket=3412031 }}</ref> Tamales are associated with certain celebrations such as [[Candlemas]].<ref name=\"adapon101\">Adapon, p. 101.</ref> They are wrapped in corn husks in the highlands and desert areas of Mexico and in banana leaves in the tropics.<ref name=\"iturr8489\">Iturriaga, p. 84-89.</ref>\n\n===Street food===\n{{Main|Mexican street food}}\n\nMexican street food is one of the most varied parts of the cuisine. It can include tacos, [[quesadilla]]s, [[pambazo]]s, tamales, [[Huarache (food)|huaraches]], [[alambre]]s, [[al pastor]], and food not suitable to cook at home, including barbacoa, carnitas, and since many homes in Mexico do not have or make use of ovens, [[Roast chicken|roasted chicken]].<ref name=\"adapon123\">Adapon, p. 123.</ref> One attraction of street food in Mexico is the satisfaction of hunger or craving without all the social and emotional connotation of eating at home, although longtime customers can have something of a friendship/familial relationship with a chosen vendor.<ref name=\"adapon126\">Adapon, p. 126.</ref>\n\nThe best known of Mexico's street foods is the taco, whose origin is based on the pre-Hispanic custom of picking up other foods with tortillas as utensils were not used.<ref name=\"iturr43\"/> The origin of the word is in dispute, with some saying it is derived from [[Nahuatl]] and others from various Spanish phrases.<ref name=\"iturr4344\">Iturriaga, p. 43-44.</ref> Tacos are not eaten as the main meal; they are generally eaten before midday or late in the evening. Just about any other foodstuff can be wrapped in a tortilla, and in Mexico, it varies from rice, to meat (plain or in sauce), to cream, to vegetables, to cheese, or simply with plain chile peppers or fresh salsa. Preferred fillings vary from region to region with pork generally found more often in the center and south, beef in the north, seafood along the coasts, and chicken and [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] in most of the country.<ref name=\"iturr44\">Iturriaga, p. 44.</ref>\n\nAnother popular street food, especially in [[Mexico City]] and the surrounding area is the [[Torta#Mexican sandwich|torta]]. It consists of a roll of some type, stuffed with several ingredients. This has its origins in the 19th century, when the French introduced a number of new kinds of bread. The torta began by splitting the roll and adding beans. Today, [[refried beans]] can still be found on many kinds of tortas. In Mexico City, the most common roll used for tortas is called ''[[Telera (bread)|telera]]'', a relatively flat roll with two splits on the upper surface. In Puebla, the preferred bread is called a [[cemita]], as is the sandwich. In both areas, the bread is stuffed with various fillings, especially if it is a hot sandwich, with beans, [[cream]] ([[mayonnaise]] is rare) and some kind of hot chile pepper.<ref name=\"iturr130133\">Iturriaga, p. 130-133.</ref>\n\nThe influence of American fast food on Mexican street food grew during the late 20th century. One example of this is the craving of the [[Sonoran hot dog|hot dog, but prepared Sonoran style]]. They are usually boiled then wrapped in [[bacon]] and fried together. They are served in the usual bun, but the condiments are typically a combination of diced tomatoes, onions and [[jalape\u00f1o]] peppers.<ref name=\"iturr130133\"/>\n\nAlong the US-Mexican border, specifically dense areas like Tijuana, Mexican vendors sell their food like [[Fruit salad|fruit melanged]] with [[Taj\u00edn (seasoning)|Tajin]] spice to people crossing the border via carts. In recent years, these [[food carts]] have been threatened by tightened border security at the Port of Entry. Both US and Mexican governments have proposed a project that would widen the streets of the border, allowing for more people to pass through the border. Widening the border would decimate neighboring [[Marketplace|mercados]] that rely on the business of travelers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/10/20/498285701/food-merchants-at-tijuana-border-fight-for-their-right-to-feed|title=Tijuana Border Plan Could Oust A Rich Food Culture And Its Cooks|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref>\n\nBesides food, street vendors also sell various kinds of drinks (including [[aguas frescas]], [[tejuino]], and [[tepache]]) and treats (such as [[bionico]]s, [[tostilocos]], and [[raspados]]). Most tamale stands will sell [[atole]] as a standard accompaniment.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:001_Tacos_de_carnitas,_carne_asada_y_al_pastor.jpg|[[Tacos]] of [[Carnitas]], [[Carne Asada]] and [[Al pastor]].\nFile:Tostadas_shrimp_cooking_food_dinner_salsa.jpg|[[Tostada (tortilla)|Tostada]]\nFile:tortamex.jpg|alt=Typical Mexican Torta|Mexican-style torta with typical accompaniments\nFile:ElBajio02.JPG|Mini bean [[gordita]] flavored with avocado leaf Veracruz style.\n</gallery>\n\n==History==\n===Pre-Hispanic period===\n{{See also|Aztec cuisine|Gamesa}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = horizontal\n   |total_width = 400\n   | header    =\n   | align     = right\n   | image1    =Mayan people and chocolate.jpg\n   |width1   = 418\n   |height1 = 333 \n   | caption1  = A [[Maya civilization|Maya]] lord sits before an individual with a container of frothed [[chocolate]].\n   | image2    = Guacomole.jpg\n   |width2   = 6048\n   |height2 =  4032 \n   | caption2  = [[Guacamole]] ([[Nahuatl]] ''\u0101huacamolli''), an avocado-based sauce that began in pre-Hispanic Mexico\n  }}\n\n[[File:Tool_(metate)-UBC_2010.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A native American grinder stone tool or \"[[metate]]\" from Central Mexico.]]\n\nAround 7000 BCE, the indigenous peoples of Mexico and Central America hunted [[Game (hunting)|game]] and gathered [[Plant-based diet|plants]], including wild chile peppers. Corn was not yet cultivated, so one main source of calories was roasted [[agave]] hearts. By 1200 BCE, corn was domesticated and a process called [[nixtamalization]], or treatment with lye, was developed to soften corn for grinding and improve its nutritional value.

Mexican cooking was of course still practiced in what is now the [[Cuisine of the Southwestern United States|Southwest United States]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], but [[Diana Kennedy]], in her book ''The Cuisines of Mexico'' (published in 1972), drew a sharp distinction between Mexican food and Tex-Mex.<ref name=\"sharpe\"/>\n\nTex-Mex food was developed from Mexican and Anglo influences, and was traced to the late 19th century in Texas. It still continues to develop with flour tortillas becoming popular north of the border only in the latter 20th century.<ref name=\"sharpe\"/> From north to south, much of the influence has been related to food industrialization, as well as the greater availability overall of food, especially after the [[Mexican Revolution]]. One other very visible sign of influence from the United States is the appearance of [[fast foods]], such as [[hamburgers]], [[hot dogs]] and [[pizza]].<ref name=\"luengas8085\">Luengas, pp. 80-85.</ref>\n\n[[File:Pujol_20.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Pujol (restaurant)|Pujol]] was named by ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' as the best in [[Mexico City]].<ref name=\"STAN SESSER\">{{cite news  \n| last=  SESSER\n| first=  STAN \n| url=  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123215425094092359.html\n| title=  The World's Greatest Food City? \n| newspaper=  [[Wall Street Journal]] \n| date=      January 17, 2009\n| accessdate= January 17, 2011}}</ref>]]\n\n[[File:Portada-chilaquiles-rojos.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[Chilaquiles]]]]\n\nIn the latter 20th century, international influence in Mexico has led to interest and development of [[haute cuisine]]. In Mexico, many professional chefs are trained in French or international cuisine, but the use of Mexican staples and flavors is still favored, including the simple foods of traditional markets. It is not unusual to see some quesadillas or small tacos among the other [[hors d'oeuvre]]s at fancy dinner parties in Mexico.<ref name=\"adapon11\"/>\n\nProfessional cookery in Mexico is growing and includes an emphasis upon traditional methods and ingredients. In the cities, there is interest in publishing and preserving what is authentic Mexican food. This movement is traceable to 1982 with the Mexican Culinary Circle of Mexico City. It was created by a group of women chefs and other culinary experts as a reaction to the fear of traditions being lost with the increasing introduction of foreign techniques and foods.<ref name=\"adapon11\"/> In 2010, Mexico's cuisine was recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>\n\nIn contemporary times, various world cuisines have become popular in Mexico, thus adopting a Mexican fusion. For example, [[sushi]] in Mexico is often made by using a variety of sauces based on [[mango]] and [[tamarind]], and very often served with [[Serrano pepper|serrano]]-chili blended [[soy]] sauce, or complemented with [[vinegar]], [[habanero pepper]]s, and chipotle peppers.\n\n==Beverages==\n{{See also|Mexican wine|Jarritos|Beer in Mexico|}}\n\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = horizontal\n   |total_width =400\n   | header    =\n   | align     = left\n   | image1    = ManekiNeko horchata jar.jpg\n   |width1   = 500\n   |height1 = 531\n   | caption1  = Two large jars of aguas frescas.

Corn is the base of a hot drink called [[atole]], which is then flavored with fruit, chocolate, rice or other flavors. Fermented corn is the base of a cold drink, which goes by different names and varieties, such as [[tejuino]], [[pozol]] and others. [[Aguas frescas]] are flavored drinks usually made from fruit, water and sugar. Beverages also include [[hibiscus]] iced tea, one made from [[tamarind]] and one from rice called \"[[horchata]]\".

This led to the dominance of meat, especially beef, in the region, and some of the most popular dishes include [[machaca]], [[arrachera]] and [[cabrito]].<ref name=\"rperez\"/><ref name=\"mexnorte\"/> The region's distinctive cooking technique is grilling, as ranch culture has promoted outdoor cooking done by men.<ref name=\"mexnorte\"/>\n\nThe ranch culture has also prompted cheese production and the north produces the [[Cheeses of Mexico|widest varieties of cheese in Mexico]]. These include [[Queso blanco|queso fresco]] (fresh farmer's cheese), ranchero (similar to Monterey Jack), [[cuajada]] (a mildly sweet, creamy curd of fresh milk), [[reques\u00f3n]] (similar to [[cottage cheese]] or [[ricotta]]), Chihuahua's creamy semi-soft queso [[Queso Chihuahua|menonita]], and fifty-six varieties of asadero (smoked cheese).<ref name=\"rperez\"/>\n\nAnother important aspect of northern cuisine is the presence of wheat, especially in the use of [[flour]] tortillas. The area has at least forty different types of [[flour tortillas]].<ref name=\"rperez\"/> The main reason for this is that much of the land supports wheat production, introduced by the Spanish. These large tortillas allowed for the creation of burritos, usually filled with machaca in [[Sonora]], which eventually gained popularity in the [[Southwest United States]].<ref name=\"mexnorte\"/>\n\n[[File:Carne a la tampique\u00f1a.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|[[Carne a la tampique\u00f1a]]]]\n\nThe variety of foodstuffs in the north is not as varied as in the south of Mexico, because of the mostly desert climate. Much of the cuisine of this area is dependent on food preservation techniques, namely dehydration and canning. Dried foods include meat, chiles, squash, [[peas]], corn, [[lentils]], beans and [[dried fruit]]. A number of these are also canned. Preservation techniques change the flavor of foods; for example, many chiles are less hot after drying.<ref name=\"rperez\"/>\n\nIn Northeastern Mexico, during the Spanish colonial period, [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]] was founded and settled by Spanish families of Jewish origin ([[Crypto-Jews]]). They contributed significantly to the regional cuisine with dishes, such as Pan de Semita or \"Semitic Bread\" (a type of bread made without [[leavening]]), [[capirotada]] (a type of dessert), and cabrito or \"baby goat\", which is the typical food of Monterrey and the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, as well as some regions of [[Coahuila]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Traditional food of Nuevo Le\u00f3n|url=http://www.nl.gob.mx/?P=nl_comida_tradicional|publisher=Gobierno del Estado de Nuevo Le\u00f3n|accessdate=16 March 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=138&letter=C Jewish Encyclopedia: Carabajal].

However, it was the first area to experience the mixing of foods and cooking styles, while central Mexico was still recuperating. Despite its size, the state has a wide variety of ecosystems and a wide variety of native foods. Vegetables are grown in the central valley, seafood is abundant on the coast and the area bordering Veracruz grows tropical fruits.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nMuch of the state's cooking is influenced by that of the [[Mixtec people|Mixtec]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]]. Later in the colonial period, Oaxaca lost its position as a major food supplier and the area's cooking returned to a more indigenous style, keeping only a small number of foodstuffs, such as chicken and pork. It also adapted [[mozzarella]], brought by the Spanish, and modified it to what is now known as [[Oaxaca cheese]].<ref name=\"unioax\">{{cite book |title= Cocina Estado por estado: Oaxaca  |trans-title=State by state cuisine: Oaxaca |year=2007 |publisher= El Universal /Radar Editores |volume=1 |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish }}</ref><ref name=\"oaxcuis\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2266-the-cuisine-of-oaxaca-land-of-the-seven-moles |title= The Cuisine of Oaxaca, Land of the Seven Moles  |first=Karen Hursh | last = Graber |date= January 1, 2006 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=October 24, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:EnchiladasTasajoOcotlan.JPG|thumb|[[Enchilada]]s with [[tasajo]] beef.]]\n\nOne major feature of Oaxacan cuisine is its seven [[Mole sauce|mole]] varieties, second only to mole poblano in popularity.

Tortillas are called blandas and are a part of every meal. Corn is also used to make empanadas, tamales and more. Black beans are favored, often served in soup or as a sauce for enfrijoladas. Oaxaca's regional chile peppers include [[pasilla]] oaxaque\u00f1a (red, hot and smoky), along with amarillos (yellow), [[chilhuacles]], chilcostles and coste\u00f1os. These, along with herbs, such as hoja santa, give the food its unique taste.<ref name=\"oaxcuis\"/>\n\nAnother important aspect to Oaxacan cuisine is [[chocolate]], generally consumed as a beverage.

The indigenous contribution is in the use of corn as a staple, as well as vanilla (native to the state) and herbs called acuyo and [[hoja santa]]. It is also supplemented by a wide variety of tropical fruits, such as [[papaya]], [[Pouteria sapota|mamey]] and [[zapote]], along with the introduction of [[citrus fruit]] and [[pineapple]] by the Spanish. The Spanish also introduced European herbs, such as [[parsley]], [[thyme]], [[marjoram]], [[bay laurel]], [[cilantro]] and others, which characterize much of the state's cooking. They are found in the best known dish of the region [[Huachinango a la veracruzana]], a red snapper dish.\n\nThe African influence is from the importation of [[slaves]] through the [[Caribbean]], who brought foods with them, which had been introduced earlier to Africa by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. As it borders the Gulf [[coast]], seafood figures prominently in most of the state. The state's role as a gateway to Mexico has meant that the dietary staple of corn is less evident than in other parts of Mexico, with rice as a heavy favorite. Corn dishes include [[Garnaches|garnachas]] (a kind of corn cake), which are readily available especially in the mountain areas, where indigenous influence is strongest.<ref name=\"veracuis\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2085-the-cuisine-of-veracruz-a-tasty-blend-of-cultures|title= The cuisine of Veracruz: a tasty blend of cultures |first=Karen Hursh | last = Graber |date= January 1, 2006 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=October 24, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Western Mexico===\nWest of Mexico City are the states of [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Jalisco]] and [[Colima]], as well as the Pacific coast. The cuisine of Michoacan is based on the [[Pur\u00e9pecha|Purepecha]] culture, which still dominates most of the state. The area has a large network of rivers and lakes providing [[Fish as food|fish]]. Its use of corn is perhaps the most varied. While [[atole]] is drunk in most parts of Mexico, it is made with more different flavors in Michoac\u00e1n, including [[blackberry]], [[cascabel chili]] and more. Tamales come in different shapes, wrapped in corn husks. These include those folded into polyhedrons called [[corunda]]s and can vary in name if the filling is different. In the [[Baj\u00edo]] area, tamales are often served with a meat [[stew]] called churipo, which is flavored with [[Opuntia|cactus fruit]].<ref name=\"mexmich\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2430-the-cuisine-of-michoac%C3%A1n-mexican-soul-food |title= The Cuisine of Michoac\u00e1n: Mexican Soul Food |first=Karen Hursh | last = Graber |date= January 1, 2004 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=October 24, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"univmich\">{{cite book |title= Cocina Estado por estado: Michoac\u00e1n  |trans-title=State by state cuisine: Michoac\u00e1n |year=2007 |publisher= El Universal /Radar Editores |volume=5 |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish }}</ref>\n\nThe main Spanish contributions to Michoac\u00e1n cuisine are rice, pork and spices.

In 2010 declared the [[Celebration of Mexican political anniversaries in 2010|Bicentennial]] Dessert of Mexico.]]\n\t\n'''Mexican cuisine''' began about 9000 years ago, when agricultural communities such as the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] formed, domesticating [[maize]], creating the standard process of [[maize]] [[nixtamalization]], and establishing their [[Maya cuisine|foodways]]. Successive waves of other [[Mesoamerica]]n groups brought with them their own cooking methods. These included the [[Olmec]], [[Teotihuacan]]os, [[Toltec]], [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], [[Otomi people|Otomi]], [[Tarascan state|Pur\u00e9pecha]], [[Totonac]], [[Mazatec]], and [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]].\n\nThe [[Mexica]] establishment of the [[Aztec Empire]] created a multi-ethnic society where many different foodways became [[Aztec cuisine|infused]]. The staples are native foods, such as corn ([[maize]]), [[bean]]s, [[squash (plant)|squash]], [[amaranth]], [[Chia seed|chia]], [[avocado]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[tomatillo]]s, [[cocoa bean|cacao]], [[vanilla]], [[agave]], [[turkey meat|turkey]], [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)#Historical use|spirulina]], [[sweet potato]], [[Cactus#Food|cactus]], and [[chili pepper]].\n\nAfter the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] in the 16th century and the subsequent [[Spanish_conquest_of_Yucat\u00e1n|conquest of the Maya area]], Europeans introduced a number of  [[European cuisine|other foods]], the most important of which were meats from domesticated animals ([[beef]], [[pork]], [[chicken]], [[goat]], and [[sheep]]), dairy products (especially cheese and milk), and [[rice]]. While the Spanish initially tried to impose their own diet on the country, this was not possible.\n\n[[Asian cuisine|Asian]] and [[African cuisine|African influences]] were also introduced into the [[indigenous cuisine]] during this era as a result of [[Afro-Mexican#African slavery in Mexico|African slavery in New Spain]] and the [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon]]s.<ref name=\"CONACULTA\">{{cite web|title= La cocina del virreinato| url=http://sic.conaculta.gob.mx/ficha.php?table=gastronomia&table_id=101 |publisher=[[CONACULTA]] |accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nOver the centuries, this resulted in regional cuisines based on local conditions, such as those in [[Oaxaca]], [[Veracruz]] and the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. Mexican cuisine is an important aspect of the culture, social structure and popular traditions of Mexico. The most important example of this connection is the use of [[Mole sauce|mole]] for special occasions and holidays, particularly in the South and Central regions of the country. For this reason and others, traditional Mexican cuisine was inscribed in 2010 on the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=\"UNESCO\">{{cite web |url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/traditional-mexican-cuisine-ancestral-ongoing-community-culture-the-michoacan-paradigm-00400 |title=Traditional Mexican cuisine - ancestral, ongoing community culture, the Michoac\u00e1n paradigm |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=January 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Basic elements==\n[[File:Still-life_by_Jos\u00e9_Agust\u00edn_Arrieta,_San_Diego_Museum_of_Art.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Still-life, oil on canvas painting by [[Agust\u00edn Arrieta|Jos\u00e9 Agust\u00edn Arrieta]] (Mexican), c. 1870, San Diego Museum of Art]]\n[[File:Huitlacoche, quintoniles, huauhzontles, flor de calabaza et al., Santa Maria la Ribera Market.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ingredients at a market in Mexico City, including [[Amaranthus hybridus|quintoniles]], [[huauzontle]], [[huitlacoche]] and [[Squash blossom|squash flowers]].]]\n\nMexican cuisine is a complex and ancient cuisine, with techniques and skills developed over thousands of years of history.<ref name=\"fife\">{{cite journal |last= MacNeil-Fife |first= Karen |date=September 2000 |title= Beyond beer: Wine with Mexican food |journal=Sunset |volume=205 |issue=3 |page=194 }}</ref> It is created mostly with ingredients native to [[Mexico]], as well as those [[Columbian Exchange|brought over]] by the [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s, with some new influences since then.<ref name=\"malat88\">Malat, p. 88.</ref> Mexican cuisine has been influenced by its proximity to the US-Mexican border.

However, the most common way to eat corn in Mexico is in the form of a tortilla, which accompanies almost every dish. Tortillas are made of corn in most of the country, but other versions exist, such as wheat in the north or [[Cooking banana|plantain]], [[yuca]] and wild greens in [[Oaxaca]].<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/><ref name=\"iturr43\"/>\n\n===Chili peppers===\n[[File:Chile Rellenos.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chile relleno]]s, stuffed Chile peppers.]]\n\nThe other basic ingredient in all parts of Mexico is the [[Chili pepper|chile pepper]].<ref name=\"adapon7\">Adapon, p. 7.</ref> Mexican food has a reputation for being very spicy, but it has a wide range of flavors and while many spices are used for cooking, not all are spicy. Many dishes also have subtle flavors.<ref name=\"fife\"/><ref name=\"adapon11\"/> Chiles are indigenous to Mexico and their use dates back thousands of years. They are used for their flavors and not just their heat, with Mexico using the widest variety. If a savory dish or snack does not contain chile pepper, hot sauce is usually added, and chile pepper is often added to fresh fruit and sweets.<ref name=\"adapon7\"/>\n\n[[File:Molcajete y tejolote.jpg|thumb|A [[molcajete]] and tejolote, the traditional [[mortar and pestle]] of Mexico.]]\n\nThe importance of the chile goes back to the [[Mesoamerican]] period, where it was considered to be as much of a staple as corn and beans. In the 16th century, [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] wrote that without chiles, the [[indigenous people]] did not think they were eating. Even today, most [[Mexicans]] believe that their national identity would be at a loss without chiles and the many varieties of sauces and salsas created using chiles as their base.<ref name=\"adapon8\">Adapon, p. 8.</ref>\n\nMany dishes in Mexico are defined by their sauces and the chiles those sauces contain (which are usually very spicy), rather than the meat or vegetable that the sauce covers. These dishes include [[entomatada]] (in tomato sauce), [[adobo]] or adobados, pipians and [[Mole sauce|moles]]. A hominy soup called [[pozole]] is defined as white, green or red depending on the chile sauce used or omitted. Tamales are differentiated by the filling which is again defined by the sauce (red or green chile pepper strips or mole). Dishes without a sauce are rarely eaten without a salsa or without fresh or pickled chiles. This includes street foods, such as [[taco]]s, [[torta]]s, [[Chicken soup#Mexico|soup]], [[sope]]s, [[tlacoyo]]s, [[tlayuda]]s, [[gordita]]s and [[sincronizada]]s.<ref name=\"adapon114\">Adapon, p. 114.</ref> For most dishes, it is the type of chile used that gives it its main flavor.<ref name=\"adapon8\"/>  [[Chipotle]],  smoked-dried jalape\u00f1o pepper, is very common in Mexican cuisine.\n\n===Spanish contributions===\n{{See also|Cheeses of Mexico}}\n[[File:Pechuga Adobada.jpg|thumb|''Pechuga [[adobada]]'', chicken breast in [[adobo]] with a side of [[chayote]], mushrooms, corn and [[Poblano|poblano rajas]]. Adobo, including a key item, [[vinegar]], arrived with the Spanish. A common characteristic of Mexican adobo is its incorporation of [[chile ancho]].]]\n\nNext to corn, [[rice]] is the most common grain in Mexican cuisine. According to food writer Karen Hursh Graber, the initial introduction of rice to Spain from [[North Africa]] in the 14th century led to the Spanish introduction of rice to Mexico at the port of Veracruz in the 1520s. This, Graber says, created one of the earliest instances of the world's greatest [[Fusion cuisine]]s.\n\nSome of the main contributions of the Spanish were several kind of meat, dairy products and wheat to name few, as the Mesoamerican diet contained very little meat besides [[domesticated turkey]], and dairy products were absent. The Spanish also introduced the technique of frying in [[Lard|pork fat]]. Today, the main meats found in Mexico are pork, chicken, beef, goat, and sheep. Native seafood and [[Fish as food|fish]] remains popular, especially along the coasts.<ref name=\"malat8889\">Malat, pp. 88-89.</ref>\n\n[[Cheeses of Mexico|Cheesemaking in Mexico]] has evolved its own specialties.

Food preparation, especially for family and social events, is considered to be an investment in order to maintain social relationships.<ref name=\"adapon20\">Adapon, p. 20.</ref> Even the idea of flavor is considered to be social, with meals prepared for certain dinners and certain occasions when they are considered the most tasty.<ref name=\"adapon117\">Adapon, p. 117.</ref>\n\nThe ability to cook well, called \"saz\u00f3n\" (lit. seasoning) is considered to be a gift generally gained from experience and a sense of commitment to the diners.<ref name=\"abarca62\">Abarca, p. 62.</ref>  For the [[Day of the Dead]] festival, foods such as tamales and mole are set out on altars and it is believed that the visiting dead relatives eat the essence of the food. If eaten afterwards by the living it is considered to be tasteless.<ref name=\"adapon117\"/> In central Mexico, the main festival foods are mole, [[barbacoa]], [[carnitas]] and [[mixiote]]s. They are often prepared to feed hundreds of guests, requiring groups of cooks. The cooking is part of the social custom meant to bind families and communities.<ref name=\"adapon89\">Adapon, p. 89.</ref>\n\n[[File:Barbacoa (en Hidalgo).JPG|miniaturadeimagen|220px|left|thumb|Barbacoa in [[Actopan (Hidalgo)|Actopan]], [[Estado de Hidalgo|Hidalgo]]. The barbecue in a ground oven is a typical dish from the Mezquital Valley.]]\n[[File:Caf\u00e9_de_olla_.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Fruit punch]] is popular around Christmas time during [[Las Posadas]].]]\n\nMexican regional home cooking is completely different from the food served in most Mexican restaurants outside Mexico, which is usually some variety of [[Tex-Mex]].<ref name=\"adapon11\"/> Some of Mexico's traditional foods involved complex or long cooking processes. Before industrialization, traditional women spent several hours a day boiling dried corn then grinding it on a [[metate]] to make the dough for tortillas, cooking them one-by-one on a [[Comal (cookware)|comal]] griddle. In some areas, tortillas are still made this way. Sauces and salsas were also ground in a mortar called a [[molcajete]]. Today, blenders are more often used, though the texture is a bit different. Most people in Mexico would say that those made with a molcajete taste better, but few do this now.<ref name=\"adapon15\">Adapon, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe most important food for festivals and other special occasions is [[Mole sauce|mole]], especially mole poblano in the center of the country.<ref name=\"adapon89\" /><ref name=\"adapon97\">Adapon, p. 97.</ref> Mole is served at Christmas, Easter, Day of the Dead and at birthdays, baptisms, weddings and funerals, and tends to be eaten only for special occasions because it is such a complex and time-consuming dish.<ref name=\"adapon89\" /><ref name=\"adapon99\">Adapon, p. 99.</ref> While still dominant in this way, other foods have become acceptable for these occasions, such as barbacoa, carnitas and mixiotes, especially since the 1980s. This may have been because of economic crises at that time, allowing for the substitution of these cheaper foods, or the fact that they can be bought ready-made or may already be made as part of the family business.<ref name=\"adapon101\" /><ref name=\"adapon107\">Adapon, p. 107.</ref>\n\nAnother important festive food is the [[tamale]], also known as ''tamal'' in Spanish. This is a filled cornmeal dumpling, steamed in a wrapping (usually a corn [[husk]] or banana leaf) and one of the basic staples in most regions of Mexico. It has its origins in the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Hispanic era]] and today is found in many varieties in all of Mexico. Like mole, it is complicated to prepare and best done in large amounts.<ref name=\"knepp\">{{Cite thesis |type=PhD |chapter= |title=Tamaladas and the role of food in Mexican-immigrant and Mexican-American cultures in Texas |last= Knepp |first= Mark Dustin |year=2010 |publisher= State University of New York at Albany |docket=3412031 }}</ref> Tamales are associated with certain celebrations such as [[Candlemas]].<ref name=\"adapon101\">Adapon, p. 101.</ref> They are wrapped in corn husks in the highlands and desert areas of Mexico and in banana leaves in the tropics.<ref name=\"iturr8489\">Iturriaga, p. 84-89.</ref>\n\n===Street food===\n{{Main|Mexican street food}}\n\nMexican street food is one of the most varied parts of the cuisine. It can include tacos, [[quesadilla]]s, [[pambazo]]s, tamales, [[Huarache (food)|huaraches]], [[alambre]]s, [[al pastor]], and food not suitable to cook at home, including barbacoa, carnitas, and since many homes in Mexico do not have or make use of ovens, [[Roast chicken|roasted chicken]].<ref name=\"adapon123\">Adapon, p. 123.</ref> One attraction of street food in Mexico is the satisfaction of hunger or craving without all the social and emotional connotation of eating at home, although longtime customers can have something of a friendship/familial relationship with a chosen vendor.<ref name=\"adapon126\">Adapon, p. 126.</ref>\n\nThe best known of Mexico's street foods is the taco, whose origin is based on the pre-Hispanic custom of picking up other foods with tortillas as utensils were not used.<ref name=\"iturr43\"/> The origin of the word is in dispute, with some saying it is derived from [[Nahuatl]] and others from various Spanish phrases.<ref name=\"iturr4344\">Iturriaga, p. 43-44.</ref> Tacos are not eaten as the main meal; they are generally eaten before midday or late in the evening. Just about any other foodstuff can be wrapped in a tortilla, and in Mexico, it varies from rice, to meat (plain or in sauce), to cream, to vegetables, to cheese, or simply with plain chile peppers or fresh salsa. Preferred fillings vary from region to region with pork generally found more often in the center and south, beef in the north, seafood along the coasts, and chicken and [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] in most of the country.<ref name=\"iturr44\">Iturriaga, p. 44.</ref>\n\nAnother popular street food, especially in [[Mexico City]] and the surrounding area is the [[Torta#Mexican sandwich|torta]]. It consists of a roll of some type, stuffed with several ingredients. This has its origins in the 19th century, when the French introduced a number of new kinds of bread. The torta began by splitting the roll and adding beans. Today, [[refried beans]] can still be found on many kinds of tortas. In Mexico City, the most common roll used for tortas is called ''[[Telera (bread)|telera]]'', a relatively flat roll with two splits on the upper surface. In Puebla, the preferred bread is called a [[cemita]], as is the sandwich. In both areas, the bread is stuffed with various fillings, especially if it is a hot sandwich, with beans, [[cream]] ([[mayonnaise]] is rare) and some kind of hot chile pepper.<ref name=\"iturr130133\">Iturriaga, p. 130-133.</ref>\n\nThe influence of American fast food on Mexican street food grew during the late 20th century. One example of this is the craving of the [[Sonoran hot dog|hot dog, but prepared Sonoran style]]. They are usually boiled then wrapped in [[bacon]] and fried together. They are served in the usual bun, but the condiments are typically a combination of diced tomatoes, onions and [[jalape\u00f1o]] peppers.<ref name=\"iturr130133\"/>\n\nAlong the US-Mexican border, specifically dense areas like Tijuana, Mexican vendors sell their food like [[Fruit salad|fruit melanged]] with [[Taj\u00edn (seasoning)|Tajin]] spice to people crossing the border via carts. In recent years, these [[food carts]] have been threatened by tightened border security at the Port of Entry. Both US and Mexican governments have proposed a project that would widen the streets of the border, allowing for more people to pass through the border. Widening the border would decimate neighboring [[Marketplace|mercados]] that rely on the business of travelers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/10/20/498285701/food-merchants-at-tijuana-border-fight-for-their-right-to-feed|title=Tijuana Border Plan Could Oust A Rich Food Culture And Its Cooks|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref>\n\nBesides food, street vendors also sell various kinds of drinks (including [[aguas frescas]], [[tejuino]], and [[tepache]]) and treats (such as [[bionico]]s, [[tostilocos]], and [[raspados]]). Most tamale stands will sell [[atole]] as a standard accompaniment.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:001_Tacos_de_carnitas,_carne_asada_y_al_pastor.jpg|[[Tacos]] of [[Carnitas]], [[Carne Asada]] and [[Al pastor]].\nFile:Tostadas_shrimp_cooking_food_dinner_salsa.jpg|[[Tostada (tortilla)|Tostada]]\nFile:tortamex.jpg|alt=Typical Mexican Torta|Mexican-style torta with typical accompaniments\nFile:ElBajio02.JPG|Mini bean [[gordita]] flavored with avocado leaf Veracruz style.\n</gallery>\n\n==History==\n===Pre-Hispanic period===\n{{See also|Aztec cuisine|Gamesa}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = horizontal\n   |total_width = 400\n   | header    =\n   | align     = right\n   | image1    =Mayan people and chocolate.jpg\n   |width1   = 418\n   |height1 = 333 \n   | caption1  = A [[Maya civilization|Maya]] lord sits before an individual with a container of frothed [[chocolate]].\n   | image2    = Guacomole.jpg\n   |width2   = 6048\n   |height2 =  4032 \n   | caption2  = [[Guacamole]] ([[Nahuatl]] ''\u0101huacamolli''), an avocado-based sauce that began in pre-Hispanic Mexico\n  }}\n\n[[File:Tool_(metate)-UBC_2010.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A native American grinder stone tool or \"[[metate]]\" from Central Mexico.]]\n\nAround 7000 BCE, the indigenous peoples of Mexico and Central America hunted [[Game (hunting)|game]] and gathered [[Plant-based diet|plants]], including wild chile peppers. Corn was not yet cultivated, so one main source of calories was roasted [[agave]] hearts. By 1200 BCE, corn was domesticated and a process called [[nixtamalization]], or treatment with lye, was developed to soften corn for grinding and improve its nutritional value. This allowed the creation of tortillas and other kinds of flat breads.<ref name=\"sharpe\">{{cite journal |last= Sharpe |first= Patricia|date=December 2004 |title= More Mexican\u2014It's About Time; Mexican food through the ages. |journal=Texas Monthly |volume=32 |issue=12 |page=1  }}</ref> The indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica had numerous stories about the origin of corn, usually related to being a gift of one or more gods, such as [[Quetzalcoatl]].<ref name=\"luengas2728\">Luengas, pp. 27-28.</ref>\n\nThe other staple was beans, eaten with corn and some other plants as a complementary protein. Despite this, studies of bones have shown problems with the lack of protein in the indigenous diet {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}, as meat was difficult to obtain. Other protein sources included [[amaranth]], [[domesticated turkey]], insects such as [[grasshopper]]s, [[beetle]]s and [[ant]] larvae, [[iguana]]s, and [[turtle]] eggs on the [[coast]]lines.<ref name=\"luengas30\">Luengas, p. 30.</ref> Vegetables included squash and their seeds; [[chilacayote]]; [[jicama]], a kind of sweet potato; and [[edible flower]]s, especially those of squash. The chile pepper was used as food, ritual and as medicine.<ref name=\"luengas30\"/>\n\nWhen the Spanish arrived, the [[Aztec]]s had sophisticated [[agricultural]] techniques and an abundance of food, which was the base of their economy. It allowed them to expand an empire, bringing in [[tribute]] which consisted mostly of foods the Aztecs could not grow themselves.<ref name=\"adapon8\"/> According to [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]], the [[Nahua peoples]] of central Mexico ate corn, beans, turkey, fish, small game, insects and a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, [[pulses]], [[seeds]], [[tubers]], wild [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], plants and [[herbs]] that they collected or cultivated.<ref name=\"adapon9\">Adapon, p. 9.</ref>\n\n===Post-conquest===\n{{See also|Mexican breads}}\n[[File:Tortilleras Nebel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Las Tortilleras'', an 1836 [[lithograph]] after a painting by [[Carl Nebel]] of women grinding corn and making tortillas.]]\n\nMexican educator [[Justo Sierra]] said that \"the grocer, not the conquistador, is the real Spanish father of Mexican society.\"<ref name=\"losquesos\"/>\n\nAfter the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]], the Spanish introduced a variety of foodstuffs and cooking techniques from [[Europe]]. Spanish cooking at that time was already a mixture of ingredients because of eight centuries of [[Arab cuisine|Arab]] influence.<ref name=\"adapon10\">Adapon, p. 10.</ref> The original aim of the introduction was to reproduce their home cuisine, but over time it was incorporated with native ingredients and cooking techniques.<ref name=\"adapon9\"/> Introduced foods included [[olive oil]], rice, onions, garlic, [[oregano]], [[coriander]], [[cinnamon]], [[clove]]s, and many other herbs and spices.<ref name=\"adapon10\"/> More importantly, they introduced domesticated animals, such as pigs, cows, chickens, goats and sheep for meat and milk, raising the consumption of protein. Cheese became the most important dairy product.<ref name=\"losquesos\"/><ref name=\"adapon10\"/> The most important cooking technique introduced by the Spanish was [[frying]].<ref name=\"adapon10\"/>\n\n[[File:KitchenSMAHuejotzingo.JPG|thumb|left|250px|A reconstructed kitchen at the 16th century former monastery of San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel, [[Huejotzingo]], Puebla.]]\n\nDespite the domination of Spanish culture, Mexican cuisine has maintained its base of corn, beans and chili peppers.<ref name=\"adapon10\"/> One reason for this was the overwhelming population of indigenous people in the earlier colonial period, and the fact that many ingredients for Spanish cooking were not available or very expensive in Mexico. One of the main avenues for the mixing of the two cuisines was in [[convents]].<ref name=\"adapon10\"/>\n\n[[File:Puesto_de_Dulces_mexicanos_-_panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mexican [[candy]] stand.]]\n\nFor example, the Spanish brought rice to Mexico and it has since grown well in [[Veracruz]]. [[New World]] tomatoes eventually replaced the use of expensive Spanish [[saffron]], as well as other local ingredients.<ref name=\"othergods\"/> [[Sugar cane]] was brought to the country and grew as well, leading to the creation of many kinds of sweets, especially local fruits in [[syrup]]. A [[sugar]]-based candy craft called [[alfe\u00f1ique]] was adapted, but often with indigenous themes, especially today for [[Day of the Dead]].<ref name=\"luengas37\">Luengas, p. 37.</ref>\n\nIn the eighteenth century, an Italian [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] friar, [[Ilarione da Bergamo]], wrote a travel narrative of his seven years in Mexico, which includes descriptions of food.  He notes that the poor as well as the well-to-do eat tortillas.  He describes lunch fare as pork products like chorizo and ham being eaten between tortillas, with a piquant red chili sauce. For drink they alcoholic drink [[pulque]], as well as corn-based [[atole]], as well as drink chocolate twice a day, for those who can afford it. He notes that coffee is not drunk, nor is wine. He describes how the evening meal ends with a small portion of beans in a thick soup, \"served to set the stage for drinking water.\"<ref>''Daily Life in Colonial Mexico: The Journey of Friar Ilarione da Bergamo, 1761-1768''\", chap. 8 \"Foods and Plants of New Spain.

Mexican cooking was of course still practiced in what is now the [[Cuisine of the Southwestern United States|Southwest United States]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], but [[Diana Kennedy]], in her book ''The Cuisines of Mexico'' (published in 1972), drew a sharp distinction between Mexican food and Tex-Mex.<ref name=\"sharpe\"/>\n\nTex-Mex food was developed from Mexican and Anglo influences, and was traced to the late 19th century in Texas. It still continues to develop with flour tortillas becoming popular north of the border only in the latter 20th century.<ref name=\"sharpe\"/> From north to south, much of the influence has been related to food industrialization, as well as the greater availability overall of food, especially after the [[Mexican Revolution]]. One other very visible sign of influence from the United States is the appearance of [[fast foods]], such as [[hamburgers]], [[hot dogs]] and [[pizza]].<ref name=\"luengas8085\">Luengas, pp. 80-85.</ref>\n\n[[File:Pujol_20.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Pujol (restaurant)|Pujol]] was named by ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' as the best in [[Mexico City]].<ref name=\"STAN SESSER\">{{cite news  \n| last=  SESSER\n| first=  STAN \n| url=  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123215425094092359.html\n| title=  The World's Greatest Food City? \n| newspaper=  [[Wall Street Journal]] \n| date=      January 17, 2009\n| accessdate= January 17, 2011}}</ref>]]\n\n[[File:Portada-chilaquiles-rojos.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[Chilaquiles]]]]\n\nIn the latter 20th century, international influence in Mexico has led to interest and development of [[haute cuisine]]. In Mexico, many professional chefs are trained in French or international cuisine, but the use of Mexican staples and flavors is still favored, including the simple foods of traditional markets. It is not unusual to see some quesadillas or small tacos among the other [[hors d'oeuvre]]s at fancy dinner parties in Mexico.<ref name=\"adapon11\"/>\n\nProfessional cookery in Mexico is growing and includes an emphasis upon traditional methods and ingredients. In the cities, there is interest in publishing and preserving what is authentic Mexican food. This movement is traceable to 1982 with the Mexican Culinary Circle of Mexico City. It was created by a group of women chefs and other culinary experts as a reaction to the fear of traditions being lost with the increasing introduction of foreign techniques and foods.<ref name=\"adapon11\"/> In 2010, Mexico's cuisine was recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>\n\nIn contemporary times, various world cuisines have become popular in Mexico, thus adopting a Mexican fusion. For example, [[sushi]] in Mexico is often made by using a variety of sauces based on [[mango]] and [[tamarind]], and very often served with [[Serrano pepper|serrano]]-chili blended [[soy]] sauce, or complemented with [[vinegar]], [[habanero pepper]]s, and chipotle peppers.\n\n==Beverages==\n{{See also|Mexican wine|Jarritos|Beer in Mexico|}}\n\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = horizontal\n   |total_width =400\n   | header    =\n   | align     = left\n   | image1    = ManekiNeko horchata jar.jpg\n   |width1   = 500\n   |height1 = 531\n   | caption1  = Two large jars of aguas frescas.

Popular foods in the city include [[barbacoa]] (a specialty of the central highlands), [[birria]] (from western Mexico), [[cabrito]] (from the north), [[carnitas]] (originally from [[Michoac\u00e1n]]), [[Mole (sauce)|mole]] sauces (from [[Puebla]] and central Mexico), tacos with many different fillings, and large [[Submarine sandwich|sub]]-like sandwiches called [[Torta#Mexico|torta]]s, usually served at specialized shops called 'Torter\u00edas'.<ref>{{cite web | title = 5 Sandwiches You Should Eat in Mexico | url = http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/03/mexican-sandwiches-torta-pambazo-chanclas-pelona-cemita.html | first = Naomi | last = Tomky | date = March 2012 | work = Serious Eats | publisher = Serious Eats Inc.}}</ref> This is also the area where most of Mexico's [[haute cuisine]] can be found.<ref name=\"dfcuisine\"/> There are eateries that specialize in pre-Hispanic food, including dishes with [[insects]].\n\n===Northern Mexico===\n[[File:Cabrito - Monterrey.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A ''cabrito'' (goat) on a spit in Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n.]]\n\nThe foods eaten in what is now the north of Mexico have differed from those in the south since the pre-Hispanic era.

This led to the dominance of meat, especially beef, in the region, and some of the most popular dishes include [[machaca]], [[arrachera]] and [[cabrito]].<ref name=\"rperez\"/><ref name=\"mexnorte\"/> The region's distinctive cooking technique is grilling, as ranch culture has promoted outdoor cooking done by men.<ref name=\"mexnorte\"/>\n\nThe ranch culture has also prompted cheese production and the north produces the [[Cheeses of Mexico|widest varieties of cheese in Mexico]]. These include [[Queso blanco|queso fresco]] (fresh farmer's cheese), ranchero (similar to Monterey Jack), [[cuajada]] (a mildly sweet, creamy curd of fresh milk), [[reques\u00f3n]] (similar to [[cottage cheese]] or [[ricotta]]), Chihuahua's creamy semi-soft queso [[Queso Chihuahua|menonita]], and fifty-six varieties of asadero (smoked cheese).<ref name=\"rperez\"/>\n\nAnother important aspect of northern cuisine is the presence of wheat, especially in the use of [[flour]] tortillas. The area has at least forty different types of [[flour tortillas]].<ref name=\"rperez\"/> The main reason for this is that much of the land supports wheat production, introduced by the Spanish. These large tortillas allowed for the creation of burritos, usually filled with machaca in [[Sonora]], which eventually gained popularity in the [[Southwest United States]].<ref name=\"mexnorte\"/>\n\n[[File:Carne a la tampique\u00f1a.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|[[Carne a la tampique\u00f1a]]]]\n\nThe variety of foodstuffs in the north is not as varied as in the south of Mexico, because of the mostly desert climate. Much of the cuisine of this area is dependent on food preservation techniques, namely dehydration and canning. Dried foods include meat, chiles, squash, [[peas]], corn, [[lentils]], beans and [[dried fruit]]. A number of these are also canned. Preservation techniques change the flavor of foods; for example, many chiles are less hot after drying.<ref name=\"rperez\"/>\n\nIn Northeastern Mexico, during the Spanish colonial period, [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]] was founded and settled by Spanish families of Jewish origin ([[Crypto-Jews]]). They contributed significantly to the regional cuisine with dishes, such as Pan de Semita or \"Semitic Bread\" (a type of bread made without [[leavening]]), [[capirotada]] (a type of dessert), and cabrito or \"baby goat\", which is the typical food of Monterrey and the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, as well as some regions of [[Coahuila]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Traditional food of Nuevo Le\u00f3n|url=http://www.nl.gob.mx/?P=nl_comida_tradicional|publisher=Gobierno del Estado de Nuevo Le\u00f3n|accessdate=16 March 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=138&letter=C Jewish Encyclopedia: Carabajal].

However, it was the first area to experience the mixing of foods and cooking styles, while central Mexico was still recuperating. Despite its size, the state has a wide variety of ecosystems and a wide variety of native foods. Vegetables are grown in the central valley, seafood is abundant on the coast and the area bordering Veracruz grows tropical fruits.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nMuch of the state's cooking is influenced by that of the [[Mixtec people|Mixtec]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]]. Later in the colonial period, Oaxaca lost its position as a major food supplier and the area's cooking returned to a more indigenous style, keeping only a small number of foodstuffs, such as chicken and pork. It also adapted [[mozzarella]], brought by the Spanish, and modified it to what is now known as [[Oaxaca cheese]].<ref name=\"unioax\">{{cite book |title= Cocina Estado por estado: Oaxaca  |trans-title=State by state cuisine: Oaxaca |year=2007 |publisher= El Universal /Radar Editores |volume=1 |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish }}</ref><ref name=\"oaxcuis\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2266-the-cuisine-of-oaxaca-land-of-the-seven-moles |title= The Cuisine of Oaxaca, Land of the Seven Moles  |first=Karen Hursh | last = Graber |date= January 1, 2006 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=October 24, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:EnchiladasTasajoOcotlan.JPG|thumb|[[Enchilada]]s with [[tasajo]] beef.]]\n\nOne major feature of Oaxacan cuisine is its seven [[Mole sauce|mole]] varieties, second only to mole poblano in popularity.  The seven are Negro (black), Amarillo (yellow), Coloradito (little red), Mancha Manteles (table cloth stainer), Chichilo (smoky stew), Rojo (red), and Verde (green).<ref name=\"oaxcuis\"/>\n\nCorn is the staple food in the region. Tortillas are called blandas and are a part of every meal. Corn is also used to make empanadas, tamales and more. Black beans are favored, often served in soup or as a sauce for enfrijoladas. Oaxaca's regional chile peppers include [[pasilla]] oaxaque\u00f1a (red, hot and smoky), along with amarillos (yellow), [[chilhuacles]], chilcostles and coste\u00f1os. These, along with herbs, such as hoja santa, give the food its unique taste.<ref name=\"oaxcuis\"/>\n\nAnother important aspect to Oaxacan cuisine is [[chocolate]], generally consumed as a beverage. It is frequently hand ground and combined with [[almonds]], cinnamon and other ingredients.<ref name=\"oaxcuis\"/>\n\n===Veracruz===\n{{Main|Cuisine of Veracruz}}\n[[File:HuachinangoVeracruzana.JPG|thumb|[[Huachinango a la veracruzana]], a dish based on [[Northern red snapper|red snapper]].]]\n\nThe cuisine of [[Veracruz]] is a mix of indigenous, [[Afro-Mexican]] and Spanish. The indigenous contribution is in the use of corn as a staple, as well as vanilla (native to the state) and herbs called acuyo and [[hoja santa]]. It is also supplemented by a wide variety of tropical fruits, such as [[papaya]], [[Pouteria sapota|mamey]] and [[zapote]], along with the introduction of [[citrus fruit]] and [[pineapple]] by the Spanish. The Spanish also introduced European herbs, such as [[parsley]], [[thyme]], [[marjoram]], [[bay laurel]], [[cilantro]] and others, which characterize much of the state's cooking. They are found in the best known dish of the region [[Huachinango a la veracruzana]], a red snapper dish.\n\nThe African influence is from the importation of [[slaves]] through the [[Caribbean]], who brought foods with them, which had been introduced earlier to Africa by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. As it borders the Gulf [[coast]], seafood figures prominently in most of the state. The state's role as a gateway to Mexico has meant that the dietary staple of corn is less evident than in other parts of Mexico, with rice as a heavy favorite. Corn dishes include [[Garnaches|garnachas]] (a kind of corn cake), which are readily available especially in the mountain areas, where indigenous influence is strongest.<ref name=\"veracuis\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2085-the-cuisine-of-veracruz-a-tasty-blend-of-cultures|title= The cuisine of Veracruz: a tasty blend of cultures |first=Karen Hursh | last = Graber |date= January 1, 2006 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=October 24, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Western Mexico===\nWest of Mexico City are the states of [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Jalisco]] and [[Colima]], as well as the Pacific coast. The cuisine of Michoacan is based on the [[Pur\u00e9pecha|Purepecha]] culture, which still dominates most of the state. The area has a large network of rivers and lakes providing [[Fish as food|fish]]. Its use of corn is perhaps the most varied. While [[atole]] is drunk in most parts of Mexico, it is made with more different flavors in Michoac\u00e1n, including [[blackberry]], [[cascabel chili]] and more. Tamales come in different shapes, wrapped in corn husks. These include those folded into polyhedrons called [[corunda]]s and can vary in name if the filling is different. In the [[Baj\u00edo]] area, tamales are often served with a meat [[stew]] called churipo, which is flavored with [[Opuntia|cactus fruit]].<ref name=\"mexmich\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2430-the-cuisine-of-michoac%C3%A1n-mexican-soul-food |title= The Cuisine of Michoac\u00e1n: Mexican Soul Food |first=Karen Hursh | last = Graber |date= January 1, 2004 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=October 24, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"univmich\">{{cite book |title= Cocina Estado por estado: Michoac\u00e1n  |trans-title=State by state cuisine: Michoac\u00e1n |year=2007 |publisher= El Universal /Radar Editores |volume=5 |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish }}</ref>\n\nThe main Spanish contributions to Michoac\u00e1n cuisine are rice, pork and spices. One of the best-known dishes from the state is [[Morisqueta|morisquesta]], which is a sausage and rice dish, closely followed by carnitas, which is deep-fried pork. The latter can be found in many parts of Mexico, often claimed to be authentically Michoac\u00e1n. Other important ingredients in the cuisine include wheat (where bread symbolizes fertility) found in breads and [[pastries]]. Another is sugar, giving rise to a wide variety of desserts and sweets, such as [[Fruit preserves|fruit jellies]] and [[ice cream]], mostly associated with the town of [[Tocumbo Municipality|Tocumbo]]. The town of [[Cotija, Michoac\u00e1n|Cotija]] has a cheese named after it.

with death by hanging or up to 25 years in prison. However, only once case of marital rape has been reported in Pakistan despite it being a common problem. A woman in Lahore filed a marital rape complaint against her husband in 2007. The husband expressed deep remorse, confessed to his crime, and sought forgiveness from his wife saying that he was pressurized by the wife's mother to try and consummate their marriage as they had been married for three months. The wife initially turned down husband's pleas saying that being a highly educated man he should have known better, and sought maximum penalty under the law. However, the couple later agreed to a settlement in which the husband was given a punishment of 200 lashes with the whip and ordered to pay a fine of Rs 1 million to his wife. Wife attended the flogging and participated in whipping him before forgiving his crime and accepting him back. The case highlights several problems in Pakistani society. Firstly, the role of cultural pressures and expectations from a woman in marriage, with wife's own mother encouraging the husband to try and consummate the marriage against wife's will. Secondly, justice is only available to educated and resourceful Pakistani women who have access to female police willing to swiftly arrest the perpetrator of the crime. Thirdly, justice was served in this case due to husband's confession, without which even resourceful Pakistani women would have to wait years to get any justice. \n\n===Child sexual abuse===\n[[Child sexual abuse]] is widespread in Pakistani [[Madrasa|Islamic schools]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Kathy |last=Gannon |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/ap-probe-sex-abuse-pervasive-070436794.html |title=Sexual abuse is pervasive in Islamic schools in Pakistan |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=21 November 2017|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref> In a study of child sexual abuse in [[Rawalpindi]] and [[Islamabad]], out of a sample of 300 children 17% claimed to have been abused and in 1997 one child a day was reported as raped, gang raped or kidnapped for sexual gratification.<ref name=\"Rasheed\" /> In September 2014, the British [[Channel 4]] broadcast a [[documentary]] called ''Pakistan's Hidden Shame'', directed by [[Mohammed Ali Naqvi|Mohammed Naqvi]] and produced by [[Jamie Doran]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/pakistans-hidden-shame/4od |title=Pakistan's Hidden Shame|publisher=[[Channel 4]] |date=1 September 2014 |accessdate=25 September 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Coilin |last=O'Connor |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/pakistan--hidden-shame-sex-abuse-peshawar/26574900.html |title=New Film Lays Bare 'Pakistan's Hidden Shame' |publisher=[[Radio Free Europe]] |date=9 September 2014 }}</ref> which highlighted the problem of sexual abuse of street children in particular, an estimated 90 percent of whom have been sexually abused.\n\nThe NGO Sahil reported 3,832 cases of child abuse in 2018 which is an 11 per cent increase from 2017 (3,445 cases).
