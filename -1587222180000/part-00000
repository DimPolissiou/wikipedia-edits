Brown died on 15 April 2020 at the age of 89.\n\n==Early life==\nBrown was born the seventh and last child of a family in [[Ardwick, Manchester]], England.<ref name=BMC /> His father was a builder and merchant seaman who died in 1931 when Brown was eight months old. Brown's mother was forced to take in washing before she began work as a cleaner. In his biography, 'The Hard Years', Brown remembered being banned from the Scouts for refusing to go on a church parade and recalled how he began exploring the countryside \u2013 camping out, playing and climbing in old quarries. At around 16 he came to Kinder Downfall and, having read Colin Kirkus' 'Let's Go Climbing', he decided to begin climbing. Legend has it that he borrowed his mother's old washing line to use as a rope, but Brown himself explained that in fact he stole rope that was placed around roadworks.<ref name=BMC /><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.livefortheoutdoors.com/outdoorfeatures/2016/9/30/ogrmbzbm5omiqhkmsk13ji057r7zog | title=Mountain Legends Part 2: Joe Brown | last=Ingram|first=Simon | publisher=Trail Magazine | date=2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving school he trained as an apprentice plumber and general builder, working for a company called Archies.<ref name=\"Joe Brown Biography 2012\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20120512003631/http://www.joe-brown.com/docman/joe-brown/joe-browns-biography/download.html \"Joe Brown Biography\"] Joe-Brown.com.</ref> In 1949\u201350, he was [[Conscription in the United Kingdom#After 1945|enlisted]] for 18 months in the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]], where he spent his free time climbing with friends.

Together with his early climbing partner, [[Don Whillans]], he was one of a new breed of British post-war climbers who came from working-class backgrounds in contrast to the [[upper class|upper]] and [[middle class]] professionals who had dominated the sport up to the [[Second World War]]. Some of his climbs were televised and he assisted with mountaineering scenes in several films. Brown died on 15 April 2020 at the age of 89.\n\n==Early life==\nBrown was born the seventh and last child of a family in [[Ardwick, Manchester]], England.<ref name=BMC /> His father was a builder and merchant seaman who died in 1931 when Brown was eight months old. Brown's mother was forced to take in washing before she began work as a cleaner. In his biography, 'The Hard Years', Brown remembered being banned from the Scouts for refusing to go on a church parade and recalled how he began exploring the countryside \u2013 camping out, playing and climbing in old quarries. At around 16 he came to Kinder Downfall and, having read Colin Kirkus' 'Let's Go Climbing', he decided to begin climbing. Legend has it that he borrowed his mother's old washing line to use as a rope, but Brown himself explained that in fact he stole rope that was placed around roadworks.<ref name=BMC /><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.livefortheoutdoors.com/outdoorfeatures/2016/9/30/ogrmbzbm5omiqhkmsk13ji057r7zog | title=Mountain Legends Part 2: Joe Brown | last=Ingram|first=Simon | publisher=Trail Magazine | date=2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving school he trained as an apprentice plumber and general builder, working for a company called Archies.<ref name=\"Joe Brown Biography 2012\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20120512003631/http://www.joe-brown.com/docman/joe-brown/joe-browns-biography/download.html \"Joe Brown Biography\"] Joe-Brown.com.</ref> In 1949\u201350, he was [[Conscription in the United Kingdom#After 1945|enlisted]] for 18 months in the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]], where he spent his free time climbing with friends.

They have not done so because the situation in the Valley remains unstable and they fear a risk to their lives. Most of them lost their properties after the exodus and many are unable to go back and sell them. Their status as displaced people has adversely harmed them in the realm of education. Many Hindu families could not afford to send their children to well regarded public schools. Furthermore, Hindus faced institutional discrimination by predominantly Muslim state bureaucrats. As a result of the inadequate ad hoc schools and colleges formed in the refugee camps, it became harder for the children of Hindus to access education. They suffered in higher education as well, as they could not claim admission in PG colleges of Jammu university, while getting admitted in the institutes of Kashmir valley was out of question.

They have not done so because the situation in the Valley remains unstable and they fear a risk to their lives. Most of them lost their properties after the exodus and many are unable to go back and sell them. Their status as displaced people has adversely harmed them in the realm of education. Many Hindu families could not afford to send their children to well regarded public schools. Furthermore, Hindus faced institutional discrimination by predominantly Muslim state bureaucrats. As a result of the inadequate ad hoc schools and colleges formed in the refugee camps, it became harder for the children of Hindus to access education. They suffered in higher education as well, as they could not claim admission in PG colleges of Jammu university, while getting admitted in the institutes of Kashmir valley was out of question.

He regards each role as a learning experience.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fashion: Celebs And Their Style- Christopher Walken|date=7 June 2010|url=http://www.elsaelsa.com/astrology/fashion-style-christopher-walken/|accessdate=28 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330033451/http://www.elsaelsa.com/astrology/fashion-style-christopher-walken/|archive-date=30 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> A rare example of a role Walken turned down was that of Ray Ruby in the film ''[[Go Go Tales]]'' (2007). According to film director [[Abel Ferrara]], the character was originally written for Walken but the latter \"didn't want to do it\". The role was then given to Walken's ''[[New Rose Hotel (film)|New Rose Hotel]]'' (1998) co-star [[Willem Dafoe]].<ref>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FskaT9FcNsI Cryptekeeper 044 Abel Ferrara/New Rose Hotel] at YouTube</ref>\n\n===Appearances on ''Saturday Night Live''===\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2019}}\nWalken has hosted the comedy sketch and satire TV series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'') seven times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/playlist/christopher-walken-collection-129711|title=Christopher Walken Collection|work=[[Saturday Night Live]]|accessdate=September 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911000848/http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/playlist/christopher-walken-collection-129711|archive-date=September 11, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOne of Walken's more famous ''SNL'' performances was a spoof of ''[[Behind the Music]]'', featuring a recording session of [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]'s \"[[(Don't Fear) the Reaper]]\". In the guise of record producer Bruce Dickinson (not to be confused with the real [[Bruce Dickinson]], lead singer for [[Iron Maiden]]), Walken makes passionate and slightly unhinged speeches to the band and is obsessed with getting \"[[More Cowbell]]\" into the song. The phrase \"I gotta have more cowbell\" has since been adapted to merchandise. The producer who suggested the cowbell on the original B\u00d6C recording is [[David Lucas (composer)|David Lucas]].\n\nWalken is also known for his part in one of [[Will Ferrell]] and [[Rachel Dratch]]'s \"The Luvahs\" skits.<ref>[https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/luvahs/n11683 \"The Luvahs\" sketch on ''SNL''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190211215018/http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/luvahs/n11683 |date=2019-02-11 }} (2/23/03) at nbc.com</ref> His character brought a lady friend to meet The Luvahs, and she is subjected to learning the past history that Walken's character shares with The Luvahs. He also divulges private information about his sex life with his girlfriend, much to her horror (\"She was willing to accept her lover's body in places no one had ever trespassed...specifically, the ear canal\").\n\nWalken spoofed his starring role from ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]'' (1983) in a sketch titled \"Ed Glosser: Trivial [[Psychic]]\" (1992).<ref>[https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/ed-glosser-trivial-psychic/n10314 ''SNL'' sketch \"Ed Glosser: Trivial Psychic] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190916035234/https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/ed-glosser-trivial-psychic/n10314 |date=2019-09-16 }} (10/24/92) at nbc.com</ref> In the film, Walken's character can predict deaths and catastrophes, while Glosser can accurately predict meaningless, trivial future but with the same emotional intensity as in the film: \"You're going to get an [[ice cream headache]]. It's going to hurt real bad, right here, [touches forehead] for eight, nine seconds.\").\n\nHis character in ''[[A View to a Kill]]'' was parodied in a sketch titled \"Lease with an Option to Kill\", in which he reprised his role as [[Max Zorin]]. Zorin, who had taken on some qualities of other notable Bond villains ([[Blofeld]]'s cat and suit, [[Emilio Largo]]'s eye patch), was upset that everything was going wrong for him. His lair was still under construction; his henchmen had jump suits that didn't fit; and his shark tank lacked sharks, having a giant [[sea sponge]] instead. A captive [[James Bond]], portrayed by [[Phil Hartman]], offered to get Zorin \"a good deal\" on the abandoned Blofeld volcanic lair if Zorin let him go, to which he reluctantly agreed.\n\nHe performed a song and dance rendition of the [[Irving Berlin]] standard, \"[[Let's Face the Music and Dance]]\". Finally, there was the \"Colonel Angus\" sketch,<ref>[https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/colonel-angus-comes-home/2750240 ''SNL'' sketch \"Colonel Angus Comes Home\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819150039/https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/colonel-angus-comes-home/2750240 |date=2018-08-19 }} (2/22/03) at nbc.com</ref> laden with ribald [[double entendre]]s, in which Walken played a dishonored [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officer.\n\nUntil 2003, Walken had a recurring ''SNL'' sketch called \"[[The Continental (Saturday Night Live)|The Continental]]\",<ref>[http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/cast/christopher-walken-57396/character/the-continental-16691 Christopher Walken in three \"Continental\" sketches] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191115234122/http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/cast/christopher-walken-57396/character/the-continental-16691 |date=2019-11-15 }} on ''SNL'' at nbc.com</ref> in which Walken played a \"suave ladies' man\" who in reality cannot do anything to keep a woman (a neighbor in his apartment building) from giving him the cold shoulder. Though he is outwardly chivalrous, his more perverted tendencies inevitably drive away his date over his pleading objections. For instance, he invites the woman to wash up in his bathroom; once she is inside, it becomes obvious that the bathroom mirror is a [[two-way mirror]] when he is seen lighting up a cigarette. In \"The Continental\", only the hand of his neighbor is ever seen; the camera always shows her point of view.\n\n[[File:Christopher Walken 2012.jpg|thumb|Walken in September 2012]]\n\nThe April 5, 2008 ''Saturday Night Live'' show was the first time an episode hosted by Walken did not have a \"Continental\" sketch or a monologue in which he sang and danced. This episode, however, did include one sketch titled \"Walken Family Reunion\",<ref>[https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/meet-the-family/n12231 ''SNL'' sketch \"Walken Family Reunion\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191115133002/https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/meet-the-family/n12231 |date=2019-11-15 }} (4/5/08) at nbc.com</ref> which spoofs many of Walken's [[idiosyncrasies]]. The sketch depicts a fictional Walken [[family reunion]], where all of Christopher's relatives have his mannerisms and speech patterns, and sport his trademark [[pompadour hairstyle]]. In order of appearance, the other Walkens are Christopher's cousin Stanley ([[Bill Hader]]); Stanley's brother John ([[Jason Sudeikis]]); John's son Scott ([[Andy Samberg]]) and daughter Maxine ([[Amy Poehler]]) (who carries a [[doll]] that also has a pompadour); Nathan ([[Fred Armisen]]), a gay relative for whom \"[[effeminacy|flamboyance]]\" means dressing all in black and running his finger around the rim of a [[cosmopolitan (cocktail)|cosmo]] glass; Uncle Richard ([[Darrell Hammond]]) and Aunt Martha ([[Kristen Wiig]]), who think that ''The Deer Hunter'' was hilarious, and who are hosts of a [[Nigerian]] [[foreign exchange student]] named Oleki ([[Kenan Thompson]]). When he came to live with them, Oleki\u2014who has absorbed all of the Walken Family traits\u2014could not speak any English. But now (he says) he \"talks like a normal teenaged American boy\". The biggest laugh of the sketch occurs when Christopher expresses his sympathies for Scott's teenaged attitude: \"I appreciate your situation. For a Walken, adolescence is a difficult time. You feel like you're the only normal person in a school full of nutjobs.\" Scott's response: \"Wow! It's like you're lookin' right into my noggin!\" ([[Will Forte]] also appears as a waiter at the beginning of the sketch, but does not do a Walken impression.)\n\nIn September 2004, ''SNL'' released a DVD titled ''The Best of Christopher Walken'' through [[Lionsgate]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Saturday-Night-Live-Christopher-Walken/dp/B0002I84EE |title=Saturday Night Live - The Best of Christopher Walken |access-date=2019-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181226061547/https://www.amazon.com/Saturday-Night-Live-Christopher-Walken/dp/B0002I84EE |archive-date=2018-12-26 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Presidential candidacy hoax===\nWalken became the subject of a hoax controversy in 2006, when a fake website started in August of that year by members of Internet forum Genmay.com announced that he was running for [[President of the United States]].

He regards each role as a learning experience.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fashion: Celebs And Their Style- Christopher Walken|date=7 June 2010|url=http://www.elsaelsa.com/astrology/fashion-style-christopher-walken/|accessdate=28 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330033451/http://www.elsaelsa.com/astrology/fashion-style-christopher-walken/|archive-date=30 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> A rare example of a role Walken turned down was that of Ray Ruby in the film ''[[Go Go Tales]]'' (2007). According to film director [[Abel Ferrara]], the character was originally written for Walken but the latter \"didn't want to do it\". The role was then given to Walken's ''[[New Rose Hotel (film)|New Rose Hotel]]'' (1998) co-star [[Willem Dafoe]].<ref>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FskaT9FcNsI Cryptekeeper 044 Abel Ferrara/New Rose Hotel] at YouTube</ref>\n\n===Appearances on ''Saturday Night Live''===\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2019}}\nWalken has hosted the comedy sketch and satire TV series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'') seven times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/playlist/christopher-walken-collection-129711|title=Christopher Walken Collection|work=[[Saturday Night Live]]|accessdate=September 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911000848/http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/playlist/christopher-walken-collection-129711|archive-date=September 11, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOne of Walken's more famous ''SNL'' performances was a spoof of ''[[Behind the Music]]'', featuring a recording session of [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]'s \"[[(Don't Fear) the Reaper]]\". In the guise of record producer Bruce Dickinson (not to be confused with the real [[Bruce Dickinson]], lead singer for [[Iron Maiden]]), Walken makes passionate and slightly unhinged speeches to the band and is obsessed with getting \"[[More Cowbell]]\" into the song. The phrase \"I gotta have more cowbell\" has since been adapted to merchandise. The producer who suggested the cowbell on the original B\u00d6C recording is [[David Lucas (composer)|David Lucas]].\n\nWalken is also known for his part in one of [[Will Ferrell]] and [[Rachel Dratch]]'s \"The Luvahs\" skits.<ref>[https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/luvahs/n11683 \"The Luvahs\" sketch on ''SNL''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190211215018/http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/luvahs/n11683 |date=2019-02-11 }} (2/23/03) at nbc.com</ref> His character brought a lady friend to meet The Luvahs, and she is subjected to learning the past history that Walken's character shares with The Luvahs. He also divulges private information about his sex life with his girlfriend, much to her horror (\"She was willing to accept her lover's body in places no one had ever trespassed...specifically, the ear canal\").\n\nWalken spoofed his starring role from ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]'' (1983) in a sketch titled \"Ed Glosser: Trivial [[Psychic]]\" (1992).<ref>[https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/ed-glosser-trivial-psychic/n10314 ''SNL'' sketch \"Ed Glosser: Trivial Psychic] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190916035234/https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/ed-glosser-trivial-psychic/n10314 |date=2019-09-16 }} (10/24/92) at nbc.com</ref> In the film, Walken's character can predict deaths and catastrophes, while Glosser can accurately predict meaningless, trivial future but with the same emotional intensity as in the film: \"You're going to get an [[ice cream headache]]. It's going to hurt real bad, right here, [touches forehead] for eight, nine seconds.\").\n\nHis character in ''[[A View to a Kill]]'' was parodied in a sketch titled \"Lease with an Option to Kill\", in which he reprised his role as [[Max Zorin]]. Zorin, who had taken on some qualities of other notable Bond villains ([[Blofeld]]'s cat and suit, [[Emilio Largo]]'s eye patch), was upset that everything was going wrong for him. His lair was still under construction; his henchmen had jump suits that didn't fit; and his shark tank lacked sharks, having a giant [[sea sponge]] instead. A captive [[James Bond]], portrayed by [[Phil Hartman]], offered to get Zorin \"a good deal\" on the abandoned Blofeld volcanic lair if Zorin let him go, to which he reluctantly agreed.\n\nHe performed a song and dance rendition of the [[Irving Berlin]] standard, \"[[Let's Face the Music and Dance]]\". Finally, there was the \"Colonel Angus\" sketch,<ref>[https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/colonel-angus-comes-home/2750240 ''SNL'' sketch \"Colonel Angus Comes Home\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819150039/https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/colonel-angus-comes-home/2750240 |date=2018-08-19 }} (2/22/03) at nbc.com</ref> laden with ribald [[double entendre]]s, in which Walken played a dishonored [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officer.\n\nUntil 2003, Walken had a recurring ''SNL'' sketch called \"[[The Continental (Saturday Night Live)|The Continental]]\",<ref>[http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/cast/christopher-walken-57396/character/the-continental-16691 Christopher Walken in three \"Continental\" sketches] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191115234122/http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/cast/christopher-walken-57396/character/the-continental-16691 |date=2019-11-15 }} on ''SNL'' at nbc.com</ref> in which Walken played a \"suave ladies' man\" who in reality cannot do anything to keep a woman (a neighbor in his apartment building) from giving him the cold shoulder. Though he is outwardly chivalrous, his more perverted tendencies inevitably drive away his date over his pleading objections. For instance, he invites the woman to wash up in his bathroom; once she is inside, it becomes obvious that the bathroom mirror is a [[two-way mirror]] when he is seen lighting up a cigarette. In \"The Continental\", only the hand of his neighbor is ever seen; the camera always shows her point of view.\n\n[[File:Christopher Walken 2012.jpg|thumb|Walken in September 2012]]\n\nThe April 5, 2008 ''Saturday Night Live'' show was the first time an episode hosted by Walken did not have a \"Continental\" sketch or a monologue in which he sang and danced. This episode, however, did include one sketch titled \"Walken Family Reunion\",<ref>[https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/meet-the-family/n12231 ''SNL'' sketch \"Walken Family Reunion\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191115133002/https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/meet-the-family/n12231 |date=2019-11-15 }} (4/5/08) at nbc.com</ref> which spoofs many of Walken's [[idiosyncrasies]]. The sketch depicts a fictional Walken [[family reunion]], where all of Christopher's relatives have his mannerisms and speech patterns, and sport his trademark [[pompadour hairstyle]]. In order of appearance, the other Walkens are Christopher's cousin Stanley ([[Bill Hader]]); Stanley's brother John ([[Jason Sudeikis]]); John's son Scott ([[Andy Samberg]]) and daughter Maxine ([[Amy Poehler]]) (who carries a [[doll]] that also has a pompadour); Nathan ([[Fred Armisen]]), a gay relative for whom \"[[effeminacy|flamboyance]]\" means dressing all in black and running his finger around the rim of a [[cosmopolitan (cocktail)|cosmo]] glass; Uncle Richard ([[Darrell Hammond]]) and Aunt Martha ([[Kristen Wiig]]), who think that ''The Deer Hunter'' was hilarious, and who are hosts of a [[Nigerian]] [[foreign exchange student]] named Oleki ([[Kenan Thompson]]). When he came to live with them, Oleki\u2014who has absorbed all of the Walken Family traits\u2014could not speak any English. But now (he says) he \"talks like a normal teenaged American boy\". The biggest laugh of the sketch occurs when Christopher expresses his sympathies for Scott's teenaged attitude: \"I appreciate your situation. For a Walken, adolescence is a difficult time. You feel like you're the only normal person in a school full of nutjobs.\" Scott's response: \"Wow! It's like you're lookin' right into my noggin!\" ([[Will Forte]] also appears as a waiter at the beginning of the sketch, but does not do a Walken impression.)\n\nIn September 2004, ''SNL'' released a DVD titled ''The Best of Christopher Walken'' through [[Lionsgate]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Saturday-Night-Live-Christopher-Walken/dp/B0002I84EE |title=Saturday Night Live - The Best of Christopher Walken |access-date=2019-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181226061547/https://www.amazon.com/Saturday-Night-Live-Christopher-Walken/dp/B0002I84EE |archive-date=2018-12-26 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Presidential candidacy hoax===\nWalken became the subject of a hoax controversy in 2006, when a fake website started in August of that year by members of Internet forum Genmay.com announced that he was running for [[President of the United States]].

There were some exploratory town-founding rumblings in 1870, followed by a petition to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, filed January 26, 1871. State approval was granted April 19, 1871. In return, the new town paid Sudbury and Stow about $23,600 and $8,000 respectively. Sudbury received more money because more land came from Sudbury and Sudbury owned shares in the railroad, and the wool mill and paper mill were located in Sudbury. The population of the newly formed town \u2013 at 1,820 \u2013 was larger than either of its parent towns.<ref name=CentennialBook>Sheridan, Ralph (1971). A History of Maynard 1871\u20131971.

Near-by Hudson, with its cluster of leather processing and shoe-making mills, seceded from Marlborough and Stow in 1866. In fact, the originally much larger Stow formed in 1683 lost land to Harvard, Shirley, Boxborough, Hudson and Maynard. The usual reason to petition the State's Committee on Towns was that a fast-growing population cluster \u2013 typically centered around mills \u2013 was too far from the schools, churches and Meeting Hall of the parent town.<ref>Fuller, Ralph.

The community grew along with the [[Assabet Woolen Mill]] and made wool cloth for U.S. military uniforms for the Civil War.

Some townspeople were upset that Amory Maynard had not left the town a gift before he died in 1890, and more were upset that Lorenzo Maynard, Amory's son, had withdrawn his own money from the Mill before it went bankrupt in 1898. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts decided to keep the name as \"Maynard\" without allowing the topic to come to a vote by the residents.<ref name=\"Gutteridge\" /><ref name=MarkHHM/>\n\nIn the early twentieth century, the village of Maynard was more modern and urbanized than many of the surrounding areas, and people would visit Maynard to shop, including [[Babe Ruth]] who lived in nearby Sudbury during the baseball off-season, and would visit Maynard to buy cigars and play pool at pool halls on Main Street. The town had a train station, an electric trolley, hotels and movie halls.<ref name=MarkHHM/>\n\nIn 1942 the U.S. Army seized one-fifth of the town's land area, from the south side, to created a munitions storage facility. Land owners were evicted. The land remained military property for years.

Major tenants included [[Raytheon]] and Dennison Manufacturing Company. [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)]] moved into the complex in 1957, initially renting only {{convert|8680|ft2|m2}} for $300/month. The company grew and grew until it bought the entire complex in 1974, which led to Maynard's nickname \"Mini Computer Capital of the World\".

The site houses many businesses, including the headquarters of [[Powell Flutes]]. The mill complex is also home to the oldest, still-working, hand-wound clock in the country (see image). The clock tower was constructed in 1892 by Lorenzo Maynard as a gift to the town. The weights that power the E. Howard & Co. tower clock and bell-ringing mechanisms are wound up once a week \u2013 more than 6,000 times since the clock was installed. The process takes one to two hours.

Five generations later, Isaac Maynard was operating a mill in Marlborough. When he died in 1820 at age 41 his teenage son, Amory Maynard, took over the family business. The City of Boston bought Amory's water rights to Fort Meadow Pond in 1846. He partnered with William Knight to start up a woolen mill operation on the Assabet River. Amory and his wife Mary (Priest) Maynard had three sons: Lorenzo (1829\u20131904), William (1833\u20131906) and Harlan (1843\u20131861). Amory managed the mill from 1847 to 1885 (Knight retired in 1852). Lorenzo took over from 1885 to 1898. William had less to do with the family business \u2013 he lived in Boston a while, then Maynard again, then off to Pasadena, California, in 1885 for reasons of ill health (possibly tuberculosis). He recovered and moved back east to Worcester in 1888 for the remainder of his life. Harlan died at age 18.<ref name=CentennialBook/><ref name=MarkHHM/>\n\nLorenzo married Lucy Davidson and had five children, but all of them died without issue \u2013 the four daughters passing away before their parents. William married Mary Adams and had seven children. Descendants of two \u2013 Harlan James and Lessie Louise \u2013 are alive today, but not living locally. William's granddaughter, Mary Augusta Sanderson, who died in 1947, was the last descendant to live in Maynard.<ref name=CentennialBook/><ref name=MarkHHM/>\n\nThe Maynard Crypt is a prominent feature on the north side of Glenwood Cemetery, within sight of passers-by on Route 27. It is an imposing earth-covered mound with a granite facade facing the road. The mound is {{convert|90|ft|m|0}} across and about {{convert|12|ft|m|0}} tall. The stonework facade is approximately {{convert|30|ft|m|0}} across. The ceiling of the crypt has a glass skylight surmounted by an exterior cone of iron grillwork. The granite lintel above the door reads \"MAYNARD.\" Chiseled above the lintel are the year 1880 and the Greek letters Alpha and Omega entwined with a Fleur-de-lis Cross. Amory Maynard, his wife, Mary, and twenty-one of their descendants or spouses thereof are interred in the crypt. At one point in time Amory's first son, Lorenzo, along with Lorenzo's wife and their four daughters, were also in the crypt, but in October 1904 Lorenzo's son arranged to have his six family members moved to a newly constructed mausoleum in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Lorenzo had contracted for the mausoleum while still alive but died before it was completed. William, Amory's second son, was buried in the Hope Cemetery, Worcester, along with his wife and four of their seven children.<ref name=MarkHHM/> \n \n[[File:Maynard MA Clock Tower Place.jpg|thumb|250px|Clock Tower, completed 1892, seen from Main Street.

Average elevation is roughly {{convert|200|ft|0|disp=x| (~|)}} above sea level; the highest point is Summer Hill, elevation {{convert|358|ft|1}}; the lowest is the Maynard/Acton border next to the Assabet River, at {{convert|145|ft|1}}.\n\nThe [[Assabet River]] flows through Maynard from west to east, spanned by seven road bridges and one foot bridge. The river's vertical drop from the Stow border to the Acton border is {{convert|30|ft|0}}. Initially, this was sufficient to hydropower the wool and paper mills, but both later added coal-powered steam engines. Average flow in the river is {{convert|200|cuft/s|m3/s}}.

Anyone may attend a town meeting, but only registered voters may vote. Before the meeting, a warrant is distributed to households in Maynard and posted on the town's website. Each article in the warrant is debated and voted on separately. A minimum of 75 registered voters is required as a [[quorum]] to hold a town meeting and vote on town business. The quorum requirement was reduced from 100 in 2009 because at times, meetings were failing to achieve a quorum. Important budgetary issues approved at a town meeting must be passed by a subsequent ballot vote. Maynard's elected officials are a five-member Board of Selectmen. Each member is elected to a three-year term. Also filled by election are the School Committee, Housing Authority, Maynard Public Library Trustees and a Moderator to preside over the town meetings. Positions filled by appointment include the Town Administrator and other positions. Details of government are in the Maynard Town Charter and Town of Maynard Bylaws.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.townofmaynard-ma.gov/gov/charter-and-bylaws/ |title=Charter and Bylaws |last= |first= |date= |website=Town of Maynard, Massachusetts |access-date=17 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===State and federal government===\nIn the [[Massachusetts General Court]], Maynard is represented by Rep.

There were some exploratory town-founding rumblings in 1870, followed by a petition to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, filed January 26, 1871. State approval was granted April 19, 1871. In return, the new town paid Sudbury and Stow about $23,600 and $8,000 respectively. Sudbury received more money because more land came from Sudbury and Sudbury owned shares in the railroad, and the wool mill and paper mill were located in Sudbury. The population of the newly formed town \u2013 at 1,820 \u2013 was larger than either of its parent towns.<ref name=CentennialBook>Sheridan, Ralph (1971). A History of Maynard 1871\u20131971.

Near-by Hudson, with its cluster of leather processing and shoe-making mills, seceded from Marlborough and Stow in 1866. In fact, the originally much larger Stow formed in 1683 lost land to Harvard, Shirley, Boxborough, Hudson and Maynard. The usual reason to petition the State's Committee on Towns was that a fast-growing population cluster \u2013 typically centered around mills \u2013 was too far from the schools, churches and Meeting Hall of the parent town.<ref>Fuller, Ralph.

Some townspeople were upset that Amory Maynard had not left the town a gift before he died in 1890, and more were upset that Lorenzo Maynard, Amory's son, had withdrawn his own money from the Mill before it went bankrupt in 1898. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts decided to keep the name as \"Maynard\" without allowing the topic to come to a vote by the residents.<ref name=\"Gutteridge\" /><ref name=MarkHHM/>\n\nIn the early twentieth century, the village of Maynard was more modern and urbanized than many of the surrounding areas, and people would visit Maynard to shop, including [[Babe Ruth]] who lived in nearby Sudbury during the baseball off-season, and would visit Maynard to buy cigars and play pool at pool halls on Main Street. The town had a train station, an electric trolley, hotels and movie halls.<ref name=MarkHHM/>\n\nIn 1942 the U.S. Army seized one-fifth of the town's land area, from the south side, to created a munitions storage facility.

Five generations later, Isaac Maynard was operating a mill in Marlborough. When he died in 1820 at age 41 his teenage son, Amory Maynard, took over the family business. The City of Boston bought Amory's water rights to Fort Meadow Pond in 1846. He partnered with William Knight to start up a woolen mill operation on the Assabet River. Amory and his wife Mary (Priest) Maynard had three sons: Lorenzo (1829\u20131904), William (1833\u20131906) and Harlan (1843\u20131861). Amory managed the mill from 1847 to 1885 (Knight retired in 1852). Lorenzo took over from 1885 to 1898. William had less to do with the family business \u2013 he lived in Boston a while, then Maynard again, then off to Pasadena, California, in 1885 for reasons of ill health (possibly tuberculosis). He recovered and moved back east to Worcester in 1888 for the remainder of his life. Harlan died at age 18.<ref name=CentennialBook/><ref name=MarkHHM/>\n\nLorenzo married Lucy Davidson and had five children, but all of them died without issue \u2013 the four daughters passing away before their parents. William married Mary Adams and had seven children. Descendants of two \u2013 Harlan James and Lessie Louise \u2013 are alive today, but not living locally. William's granddaughter, Mary Augusta Sanderson, who died in 1947, was the last descendant to live in Maynard.<ref name=CentennialBook/><ref name=MarkHHM/>\n\nThe Maynard Crypt is a prominent feature on the north side of Glenwood Cemetery, within sight of passers-by on Route 27. It is an imposing earth-covered mound with a granite facade facing the road. The mound is {{convert|90|ft|m|0}} across and about {{convert|12|ft|m|0}} tall. The stonework facade is approximately {{convert|30|ft|m|0}} across. The ceiling of the crypt has a glass skylight surmounted by an exterior cone of iron grillwork. The granite lintel above the door reads \"MAYNARD.\" Chiseled above the lintel are the year 1880 and the Greek letters Alpha and Omega entwined with a Fleur-de-lis Cross. Amory Maynard, his wife, Mary, and twenty-one of their descendants or spouses thereof are interred in the crypt. At one point in time Amory's first son, Lorenzo, along with Lorenzo's wife and their four daughters, were also in the crypt, but in October 1904 Lorenzo's son arranged to have his six family members moved to a newly constructed mausoleum in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Lorenzo had contracted for the mausoleum while still alive but died before it was completed. William, Amory's second son, was buried in the Hope Cemetery, Worcester, along with his wife and four of their seven children.<ref name=MarkHHM/> \n \n[[File:Maynard MA Clock Tower Place.jpg|thumb|250px|Clock Tower, completed 1892, seen from Main Street.

Anyone may attend a town meeting, but only registered voters may vote. Before the meeting, a warrant is distributed to households in Maynard and posted on the town's website. Each article in the warrant is debated and voted on separately. A minimum of 75 registered voters is required as a [[quorum]] to hold a town meeting and vote on town business. The quorum requirement was reduced from 100 in 2009 because at times, meetings were failing to achieve a quorum. Important budgetary issues approved at a town meeting must be passed by a subsequent ballot vote. Maynard's elected officials are a five-member Board of Selectmen. Each member is elected to a three-year term. Also filled by election are the School Committee, Housing Authority, Maynard Public Library Trustees and a Moderator to preside over the town meetings. Positions filled by appointment include the Town Administrator and other positions. Details of government are in the Maynard Town Charter and Town of Maynard Bylaws.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.townofmaynard-ma.gov/gov/charter-and-bylaws/ |title=Charter and Bylaws |last= |first= |date= |website=Town of Maynard, Massachusetts |access-date=17 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===State and federal government===\nIn the [[Massachusetts General Court]], Maynard is represented by Rep.
