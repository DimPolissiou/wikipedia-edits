The interconnected lines which facilitate this movement are known as a ''transmission network''. This is distinct from the local wiring between high-voltage substations and customers, which is typically referred to as [[electric power distribution]]. The combined transmission and distribution network is part of [[electricity delivery]], known as the \"[[power grid]]\" in [[North America]], or just \"the grid\". In the [[United Kingdom]], [[India]], [[Tanzania]], [[Myanmar]], [[Malaysia]] and [[New Zealand]], the network is known as the National Grid.\n\nA  [[wide area synchronous grid]], also known as an \"interconnection\" in North America, directly connects many generators delivering AC power with the same relative ''frequency'' to many consumers. For example, there are four major interconnections in North America (the [[Western Interconnection]], the [[Eastern Interconnection]], the [[Quebec Interconnection]] and the [[Electric Reliability Council of Texas]] (ERCOT) grid). In Europe [[Synchronous grid of Continental Europe|one large grid connects most of continental Europe]].\n\nHistorically, transmission and distribution lines were owned by the same company, but starting in the 1990s, many countries have [[Electricity liberalization|liberalized]] the regulation of the [[electricity market]] in ways that have led to the separation of the electricity transmission business from the distribution business.<ref name=femp01>{{cite journal|url=https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-13906.pdf|title=A Primer on Electric Utilities, Deregulation, and Restructuring of U.S. Electricity Markets|publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]] [[Federal Energy Management Program]] (FEMP)|date=May 2002|format=PDF|accessdate=October 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== System ==\nMost transmission lines are high-voltage [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] [[alternating current]] (AC), although [[single-phase electric power|single phase]] AC is sometimes used in [[railway electrification system]]s. [[High-voltage direct current|High-voltage direct-current]] (HVDC) technology is used for greater efficiency over very long distances (typically hundreds of miles). HVDC technology is also used in [[submarine power cable]]s (typically longer than 30 miles (50&nbsp;km)), and in the interchange of power between grids that are not mutually synchronized. HVDC links are used to stabilize large power distribution networks where sudden new loads, or blackouts, in one part of a network can result in synchronization problems and [[cascading failure]]s.\n\n[[File:Electricity grid simple- North America.svg|thumb|400px|left|Diagram of an electric power system; transmission system is in blue]]\n\nElectricity is transmitted at [[high voltage]]s (66&nbsp;kV or above) to reduce the energy loss which occurs  in long-distance transmission. Power is usually transmitted through [[overhead power line]]s. [[Undergrounding|Underground power transmission]] has a significantly higher installation cost and greater operational limitations, but reduced maintenance costs. Underground transmission is sometimes used in urban areas or environmentally sensitive locations.\n\nA lack of electrical energy storage facilities in transmission systems leads to a key limitation. Electrical energy must be generated at the same rate at which it is consumed. A sophisticated control system is required to ensure that the [[power generation]] very closely matches the demand. If the demand for power exceeds supply, the imbalance can cause generation plant(s) and transmission equipment to automatically disconnect or shut down to prevent damage. In the worst case, this may lead to a cascading series of shut downs and a major regional [[power outage|blackout]]. Examples include the US Northeast blackouts of [[Northeast Blackout of 1965|1965]], [[New York City blackout of 1977|1977]], [[Northeast blackout of 2003|2003]], and major blackouts in other US regions in [[1996 Western North America blackouts|1996]] and [[2011 Southwest blackout|2011]]. Electric transmission networks are interconnected into regional, national, and even continent wide networks to reduce the risk of such a failure by providing multiple [[redundancy (engineering)|redundant]], alternative routes for power to flow should such shut downs occur. Transmission companies determine the maximum reliable capacity of each line (ordinarily less than its physical or thermal limit) to ensure that spare capacity is available in the event of a failure in another part of the network.\n\n== Overhead transmission ==\n{{Main|Overhead power line}}\n[[File:High Voltage Lines in Washington State.tif|thumb|upright=0.75|left|3-phase high-voltage lines in Washington State, \"Bundled\" 3-ways]]\n\n{{multiple image\n |direction = vertical\n |align = right\n |width = 225\n |image1=Electric power transmission line.JPG\n |image2=Sample cross-section of high tension power (pylon) line.jpg\n |caption1=Four-circuit, two-voltage power transmission line; \"Bundled\" 2-ways\n |caption2=A typical [[Aluminium-conductor steel-reinforced cable|ACSR]]. The conductor consists of seven strands of steel surrounded by four layers of aluminium.\n}}\n\nHigh-voltage overhead conductors are not covered by insulation. The conductor material is nearly always an [[aluminum]] alloy, made into several strands and possibly reinforced with steel strands. Copper was sometimes used for overhead transmission, but aluminum is lighter, yields only marginally reduced performance and costs much less. Overhead conductors are a commodity supplied by several companies worldwide. Improved conductor material and shapes are regularly used to allow increased capacity and modernize transmission circuits. Conductor sizes range from 12&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup> (#6 [[American wire gauge]]) to 750&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup> (1,590,000&nbsp;[[circular mil]]s area), with varying resistance and [[current-carrying capacity]]. For normal AC lines thicker wires would lead to a relatively small increase in capacity due to the [[skin effect]] (which causes most of the current to flow close to the surface of the wire). Because of this current limitation, multiple parallel cables (called [[bundle conductor]]s) are used when higher capacity is needed. Bundle conductors are also used at high voltages to reduce energy loss caused by [[corona discharge]].\n\nToday, transmission-level voltages are usually considered to be 110&nbsp;kV and above. Lower voltages, such as 66&nbsp;kV and 33&nbsp;kV, are usually considered [[#Subtransmission|subtransmission]] voltages, but are occasionally used on long lines with light loads. Voltages less than 33&nbsp;kV are usually used for [[electricity distribution|distribution]]. Voltages above 765&nbsp;kV are considered [[high voltage#Power lines|extra high voltage]] and require different designs compared to equipment used at lower voltages.\n\nSince overhead transmission wires depend on air for insulation, the design of these lines requires minimum clearances to be observed to maintain safety. Adverse weather conditions, such as high winds and low temperatures, can lead to power outages. Wind speeds as low as {{convert|23|kn|km/h}} can permit conductors to encroach operating clearances, resulting in a [[Electric arc|flashover]] and loss of supply.<ref>Hans Dieter Betz, Ulrich Schumann, Pierre Laroche (2009).

Retrieved on 13&nbsp;May 2009.</ref>\nOscillatory motion of the physical line can be termed [[conductor gallop|conductor gallop or flutter]] depending on the frequency and amplitude of oscillation.\n\n== Underground transmission ==\n{{Main|Undergrounding}}\n\nElectric power can also be transmitted by [[high-voltage cable|underground power cables]] instead of overhead power lines. Underground cables take up less right-of-way than overhead lines, have lower visibility, and are less affected by bad weather. However, costs of insulated cable and excavation are much higher than overhead construction. Faults in buried transmission lines take longer to locate and repair.\n\nIn some metropolitan areas, underground transmission cables are enclosed by metal pipe and insulated with dielectric fluid (usually an oil) that is either static or circulated via pumps. If an electric fault damages the pipe and produces a dielectric leak into the surrounding soil, liquid nitrogen trucks are mobilized to freeze portions of the pipe to enable the draining and repair of the damaged pipe location. This type of underground transmission cable can prolong the repair period and increase repair costs. The temperature of the pipe and soil are usually monitored constantly throughout the repair period.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/16/us/after-attacks-workers-con-edison-crews-improvise-they-rewire-truncated-system.html|title=AFTER THE ATTACKS: THE WORKERS; Con Edison Crews Improvise as They Rewire a Truncated System|first=Neela|last=Banerjee|date=September 16, 2001|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/Common/ViewDoc.aspx?DocRefId={5B2369A6-97FC-4613-AD8B-91E23D41AC05} |title=INVESTIGATION OF THE SEPTEMBER 2013 ELECTRIC OUTAGE OF A PORTION OF METRO-NORTH RAILROAD\u2019S NEW HAVEN LINE |publisher=documents.dps.ny.gov |date=2014 |accessdate=2019-12-29}}</ref><ref>NYSPSC case no. 13-E-0529</ref>\n\nUnderground lines are strictly limited by their thermal capacity, which permits less overload or re-rating than overhead lines. Long underground AC cables have significant [[capacitance]], which may reduce their ability to provide useful power to loads beyond {{convert|50|mi|abbr=off}}. DC cables are not limited in length by their capacitance, however, they do require [[HVDC converter station]]s at both ends of the line to convert from DC to AC before being interconnected with the transmission network.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of electric power transmission}}\n[[File:New York utility lines in 1890.jpg|thumb|New York City streets in 1890. Besides telegraph lines, multiple electric lines were required for each class of device requiring different voltages]]\n\nIn the early days of commercial electric power, transmission of electric power at the same voltage as used by lighting and mechanical loads restricted the distance between generating plant and consumers. In 1882, generation was with [[direct current]] (DC), which could not easily be increased in voltage for long-distance transmission. Different classes of loads (for example, lighting, fixed motors, and traction/railway systems) required different voltages, and so used different generators and circuits.<ref name=hughes>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=g07Q9M4agp4C&pg=PA122&lpg=PA122&dq=westinghouse+%22universal+system%22|pages=119\u2013122|author=Thomas P.

It was powered by a 2 kV, 130&nbsp;Hz [[Siemens & Halske]] alternator and featured several Gaulard secondary generators with their primary windings connected in series, which fed incandescent lamps. The system proved the feasibility of AC electric power transmission on long distances.<ref name=\"guarnieri 7-1\"/>\n\nThe very first AC system to operate was in service in 1885 in via dei Cerchi, [[Rome, Italy]], for public lighting. It was powered by two Siemens & Halske alternators rated 30&nbsp;hp (22&nbsp;kW), 2 kV at 120&nbsp;Hz and used 19&nbsp;km of cables and 200&nbsp;parallel-connected 2 kV to 20&nbsp;V step-down transformers provided with a closed magnetic circuit, one for each lamp. A few months later it was followed by the first British AC system, which was put into service at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]], London.

These included single phase AC systems, poly-phase AC systems, low voltage incandescent lighting, high voltage arc lighting, and existing DC motors in factories and street cars. In what was becoming a ''universal system'', these technological differences were temporarily being bridged via the development of [[rotary converter]]s and [[motor-generator]]s that would allow the large number of legacy systems to be connected to the AC grid.<ref name=\"Thomas Parke Hughes 1930, pages 120-121\">{{cite book|first=Thomas |last=Parke Hughes|title=Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880-1930|publisher=JHU Press|year=1993|pages=120\u2013121}}</ref><ref name=\"Raghu Garud 2009, page 249\">{{cite book|first1=Raghu|last1=Garud|first2=Arun|last2=Kumaraswamy|first3= Richard|last3= Langlois|title= Managing in the Modular Age: Architectures, Networks, and Organizations|publisher= John Wiley & Sons |year=2009| page=249}}</ref> These stopgaps would slowly be replaced as older systems were retired or upgraded.\n\n[[File:Tesla polyphase AC 500hp generator at 1893 exposition.jpg|thumb|right|Westinghouse alternating current [[polyphase system|polyphase]] generators on display at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition|World's Fair in Chicago]], part of their \"Tesla Poly-phase System\".

(2003). ''Overhead power lines''. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, p.&nbsp;5</ref>\n\nVoltages used for electric power transmission increased throughout the 20th&nbsp;century. By 1914, fifty-five transmission systems each operating at more than 70 kV were in service. The highest voltage then used was 150 kV.<ref>Bureau of Census data reprinted in Hughes, pp.&nbsp;282\u2013283</ref>\nBy allowing multiple generating plants to be interconnected over a wide area, electricity production cost was reduced. The most efficient available plants could be used to supply the varying loads during the day. Reliability was improved and capital investment cost was reduced, since stand-by generating capacity could be shared over many more customers and a wider geographic area. Remote and low-cost sources of energy, such as [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power or mine-mouth coal, could be exploited to lower energy production cost.<ref name=\"hughes\" /><ref name=\"guarnieri 7-2\"/>\n\nThe rapid industrialization in the 20th&nbsp;century made electrical transmission lines and grids [[critical infrastructure]] items in most industrialized nations. The interconnection of local generation plants and small distribution networks was spurred by the requirements of [[World War I]], with large electrical generating plants built by governments to provide power to munitions factories. Later these generating plants were connected to supply civil loads through long-distance transmission.<ref>Hughes, pp.&nbsp;293\u2013295</ref>{{clear left}}\n\n== Bulk power transmission ==\n[[File:Transmissionsubstation.jpg|thumb|A [[Electrical substation|transmission substation]] decreases the voltage of incoming electricity, allowing it to connect from long-distance high voltage transmission, to local lower voltage distribution. It also reroutes power to other transmission lines that serve local markets. This is the [[PacifiCorp]] Hale Substation, [[Orem, Utah]], USA]]\n\nEngineers design transmission networks to transport the energy as efficiently as possible, while at the same time taking into account the economic factors, network safety and redundancy. These networks use components such as power lines, cables, [[circuit breaker]]s, switches and [[transformer]]s. The transmission network is usually administered on a regional basis by an entity such as a [[regional transmission organization]] or [[transmission system operator]].\n\nTransmission efficiency is greatly improved by devices that increase the voltage (and thereby proportionately reduce the current), in the line conductors, thus allowing power to be transmitted with acceptable losses. The reduced current flowing through the line reduces the heating losses in the conductors. According to [[Joule's first law|Joule's Law]], energy losses are directly proportional to the square of the current. Thus, reducing the current by a factor of two will lower the energy lost to conductor resistance by a factor of four for any given size of conductor.\n\nThe optimum size of a conductor for a given voltage and current can be estimated by [[Kelvin's law for conductor size]], which states that the size is at its optimum when the annual cost of energy wasted in the resistance is equal to the annual capital charges of providing the conductor. At times of lower interest rates, Kelvin's law indicates that thicker wires are optimal; while, when metals are expensive, thinner conductors are indicated: however, power lines are designed for long-term use, so Kelvin's law has to be used in conjunction with long-term estimates of the price of copper and aluminum as well as interest rates for capital.\n\nThe increase in voltage is achieved in AC circuits by using a ''step-up [[transformer]]''. [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] systems require relatively costly conversion equipment which may be economically justified for particular projects such as submarine cables and longer distance high capacity point-to-point transmission. HVDC is necessary for the import and export of energy between grid systems that are not synchronized with each other.\n\nA transmission grid is a network of [[power station]]s, transmission lines, and [[Electrical substation|substations]]. Energy is usually transmitted within a grid with [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] [[alternating current|AC]]. Single-phase AC is used only for distribution to end users since it is not usable for large polyphase [[induction motor]]s. In the 19th&nbsp;century, two-phase transmission was used but required either four wires or three wires with unequal currents. Higher order phase systems require more than three wires, but deliver little or no benefit.\n\n[[File:ElectricityUCTE.svg|thumb|left|The [[wide area synchronous grid|synchronous grids]] of the [[European Union]]]]\n\nThe price of electric power station capacity is high, and electric demand is variable, so it is often cheaper to import some portion of the needed power than to generate it locally. Because loads are often regionally correlated (hot weather in the Southwest portion of the US might cause many people to use air conditioners), electric power often comes from distant sources. Because of the economic benefits of load sharing between regions, [[wide area synchronous grid|wide area transmission grids]] now span countries and even continents. The web of interconnections between power producers and consumers should enable power to flow, even if some links are inoperative.\n\nThe unvarying (or slowly varying over many hours) portion of the electric demand is known as the ''[[base load power plant|base load]]'' and is generally served by large facilities (which are more efficient due to economies of scale) with fixed costs for fuel and operation. Such facilities are nuclear, coal-fired or hydroelectric, while other energy sources such as [[Solar thermal energy|concentrated solar thermal]] and [[geothermal power]] have the potential to provide base load power. Renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaics, wind, wave, and tidal, are, due to their intermittency, not considered as supplying \"base load\" but will still add power to the grid. The remaining or 'peak' power demand, is supplied by [[peaking power plant]]s, which are typically smaller, faster-responding, and higher cost sources, such as combined cycle or combustion turbine plants fueled by natural gas.\n\nLong-distance transmission of electricity (hundreds of kilometers) is cheap and efficient, with costs of US$0.005\u20130.02 per kWh (compared to annual averaged large producer costs of US$0.01\u20130.025 per kWh, retail rates upwards of US$0.10 per kWh, and multiples of retail for instantaneous suppliers at unpredicted highest demand moments).<ref name=\"limits-of-very-long-distance\"/> Thus distant suppliers can be cheaper than local sources (e.g., New York often buys over 1000&nbsp;MW of electricity from Canada).<ref>{{cite web|title=NYISO Zone Maps|url=http://www.nyiso.com/public/markets_operations/market_data/maps/index.jsp|publisher=New York Independent System Operator|accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref>  Multiple '''local sources''' (even if more expensive and infrequently used) can make the transmission grid more fault tolerant to weather and other disasters that can disconnect distant suppliers.\n\n[[File:Electicaltransmissionlines3800ppx.JPG|thumb|A high-power electrical transmission tower, 230&nbsp;kV, double-circuit, also double-bundled]]\n\nLong-distance transmission allows remote renewable energy resources to be used to displace fossil fuel consumption. Hydro and wind sources cannot be moved closer to populous cities, and solar costs are lowest in remote areas where local power needs are minimal. Connection costs alone can determine whether any particular renewable alternative is economically sensible. Costs can be prohibitive for transmission lines, but various proposals for massive infrastructure investment in high capacity, very long distance [[super grid]] transmission networks could be recovered with modest usage fees.\n\n=== Grid input ===\nAt the [[power station]]s, the power is produced at a relatively low voltage between about 2.3&nbsp;kV and 30&nbsp;kV, depending on the size of the unit. The generator terminal voltage is then stepped up by the power station [[transformer]] to a higher [[voltage]] (115&nbsp;kV to 765&nbsp;kV AC, varying by the transmission system and by the country) for transmission over long distances.\n\nIn the United States, power transmission is, variously, 230&nbsp;kV to 500&nbsp;kV, with less than 230&nbsp;kV or more than 500&nbsp;kV being local exceptions.\n\nFor example, the Western System has two primary interchange voltages: 500&nbsp;kV AC at 60&nbsp;Hz, and \u00b1500&nbsp;kV (1,000&nbsp;kV net) DC from North to South ([[Columbia River]] to [[Southern California]]) and Northeast to Southwest (Utah to Southern California). The 287.5&nbsp;kV ([[Hoover Dam|Hoover]] to [[Los Angeles]] line, via [[Victorville]]) and 345&nbsp;kV ([[Arizona Public Service|APS]] line) being local standards, both of which were implemented before 500&nbsp;kV became practical, and thereafter the Western System standard for long distance AC power transmission.\n\n=== Losses ===\nTransmitting electricity at high voltage reduces the fraction of energy lost to [[Joule heating|resistance]], which varies depending on the specific conductors, the current flowing, and the length of the transmission line. For example, a {{convert|100|mile|abbr=on}} span at 765&nbsp;kV carrying 1000&nbsp;MW of power can have losses of 1.1% to 0.5%. A 345&nbsp;kV line carrying the same load across the same distance has losses of 4.2%.<ref>American Electric Power, Transmission Facts, page&nbsp;4: https://web.archive.org/web/20110604181007/https://www.aep.com/about/transmission/docs/transmission-facts.pdf</ref> For a given amount of power, a higher voltage reduces the current and thus the [[resistive loss]]es in the conductor. For example, raising the voltage by a factor of 10 reduces the current by a corresponding factor of 10 and therefore the <math>I^2 R</math> losses by a factor of 100, provided the same sized conductors are used in both cases. Even if the conductor size (cross-sectional area) is decreased ten-fold to match the lower current, the <math>I^2 R</math> losses are still reduced ten-fold. Long-distance transmission is typically done with overhead lines at voltages of 115 to 1,200&nbsp;kV. At extremely high voltages, more than 2,000&nbsp;kV exists between conductor and ground, [[corona discharge]] losses are so large that they can offset the lower resistive losses in the line conductors. Measures to reduce corona losses include conductors having larger diameters; often hollow to save weight,<ref>[http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/environment/info/aspen/deltasub/pea/16_corona_and_induced_currents.pdf California Public Utilities Commission] Corona and induced currents</ref> or bundles of two or more conductors.\n\nFactors that affect the resistance, and thus loss, of conductors used in transmission and distribution lines include temperature, spiraling, and the [[skin effect]]. The resistance of a conductor increases with its temperature. Temperature changes in electric power lines can have a significant effect on power losses in the line. Spiraling, which refers to the way stranded conductors spiral about the center, also contributes to increases in conductor resistance. The skin effect causes the effective resistance of a conductor to increase at higher alternating current frequencies.  Corona and resistive losses can be estimated using a mathematical model.<ref>{{cite web |title=AC Transmission Line Losses |author=Curt Harting |date=October 24, 2010 |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2010/ph240/harting1/ |accessdate=June 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nTransmission and distribution losses in the USA were estimated at 6.6% in 1997,<ref name=\"tonto.eia.doe.gov\">{{cite web |url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=105&t=3 |title=Where can I find data on electricity transmission and distribution losses? |date=19 November 2009 |work=Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Electricity |publisher=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]] |accessdate=29 March 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> 6.5% in 2007<ref name=\"tonto.eia.doe.gov\"/> and 5% from 2013 to 2019.<ref name=\"eia.gov\">{{cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=105&t=3|title=How much electricity is lost in electricity transmission and distribution in the United States? |date=9 January 2019 |work=Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Electricity |publisher=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]] |accessdate=27 February 2019}}</ref> In general, losses are estimated from the discrepancy between power produced (as reported by power plants) and power sold to the end customers; the difference between what is produced and what is consumed constitute transmission and distribution losses, assuming no utility theft occurs.\n\nAs of 1980, the longest cost-effective distance for [[Direct current|direct-current]] transmission was determined to be {{convert|7000|km|mi|abbr=off}}.

Currents that flow solely in \u2018reaction\u2019 to these properties of the circuit, (which together with the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] define the [[electrical impedance|impedance]]) constitute [[reactive power]] flow, which transmits no \u2018real\u2019 power to the load. These reactive currents, however, are very real and cause extra heating losses in the transmission circuit. The ratio of 'real' power (transmitted to the load) to 'apparent' power (the product of a circuit's voltage and current, without reference to phase angle) is the [[power factor]]. As reactive current increases, the reactive power increases and the power factor decreases. For transmission systems with low power factor, losses are higher than for systems with high power factor. Utilities add capacitor banks, reactors and other components (such as [[phase-shifting transformer]]s; [[static VAR compensator]]s; and [[flexible AC transmission system]]s, FACTS) throughout the system help to compensate for the reactive power flow, reduce the losses in power transmission and stabilize system voltages. These measures are collectively called 'reactive support'.\n\n=== Transposition ===\nCurrent flowing through transmission lines induces a magnetic field that surrounds the lines of each phase and affects the [[inductance]] of the surrounding conductors of other phases. The mutual inductance of the conductors is partially dependent on the physical orientation of the lines with respect to each other. Three-phase power transmission lines are conventionally strung with phases separated on different vertical levels. The mutual inductance seen by a conductor of the phase in the middle of the other two phases will be different than the inductance seen by the conductors on the top or bottom. An imbalanced inductance among the three conductors is problematic because it may result in the middle line carrying a disproportionate amount of the total power transmitted. Similarly, an imbalanced load may occur if one line is consistently closest to the ground and operating at a lower impedance. Because of this phenomenon, conductors must be periodically transposed along the length of the transmission line so that each phase sees equal time in each relative position to balance out the mutual inductance seen by all three phases. To accomplish this, line position is swapped at specially designed [[transposition tower]]s at regular intervals along the length of the transmission line in various [[Transposition (telecommunications)|transposition schemes]].\n\n=== Subtransmission ===\n[[File:Cavite, Batangas jf0557 11.jpg|thumb|175px|A 115&nbsp;kV subtransmission line in the [[Philippines]], along with 20&nbsp;kV [[Electric power distribution|distribution]] lines and a [[street light]], all mounted in a wood [[Utility pole|subtransmission pole]]]]\n[[File:Wood Pole Structure.JPG|thumb|173px|115 kV H-frame transmission tower]]\n\n'''Subtransmission''' is part of an electric power transmission system that runs at relatively lower voltages. It is uneconomical to connect all [[electrical substation|distribution substation]]s to the high main transmission voltage, because the equipment is larger and more expensive. Typically, only larger substations connect with this high voltage. It is stepped down and sent to smaller substations in towns and neighborhoods. Subtransmission circuits are usually arranged in loops so that a single line failure does not cut off service to many customers for more than a short time. Loops can be \"normally closed\", where loss of one circuit should result in no interruption, or \"normally open\" where substations can switch to a backup supply. While subtransmission circuits are usually carried on [[Overhead power line|overhead lines]], in urban areas buried cable may be used. The lower-voltage subtransmission lines use less right-of-way and simpler structures; it is much more feasible to put them underground where needed. Higher-voltage lines require more space and are usually above-ground since putting them underground is very expensive.\n\nThere is no fixed cutoff between subtransmission and transmission, or subtransmission and [[Electric power distribution|distribution]]. The voltage ranges overlap somewhat. Voltages of 69&nbsp;kV, 115&nbsp;kV, and 138&nbsp;kV are often used for subtransmission in North America. As power systems evolved, voltages formerly used for transmission were used for subtransmission, and subtransmission voltages became distribution voltages. Like transmission, subtransmission moves relatively large amounts of power, and like distribution, subtransmission covers an area instead of just point-to-point.<ref>Donald G. Fink and H. Wayne Beaty. (2007), ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers (15th&nbsp;Edition)''. McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|978-0-07-144146-9}} section&nbsp;18.5</ref>\n\n=== Transmission grid exit ===\nAt the [[electrical substation|substations]], transformers reduce the voltage to a lower level for [[Electric power distribution|distribution]] to commercial and residential users. This distribution is accomplished with a combination of sub-transmission (33 to 132&nbsp;kV) and distribution (3.3 to 25&nbsp;kV). Finally, at the point of use, the energy is transformed to low voltage (varying by country and customer requirements &ndash; see [[Mains electricity by country]]).\n\n== Advantage of high-voltage power transmission ==\n{{See also|ideal transformer}}\nHigh-voltage power transmission allows for lesser resistive losses over long distances in the wiring. This efficiency of high voltage transmission allows for the transmission of a larger proportion of the generated power to the substations and in turn to the loads, translating to operational cost savings.\n\n[[File:Power split two resistances.svg|thumb|Electrical grid without a transformer.]]\n[[File:Transformer power split.svg|thumb|Electrical grid with a transformer.]]\nIn a very simplified model, assume the [[electrical grid]] delivers electricity from a generator (modelled as an [[ideal voltage source]] with voltage <math>V</math>, delivering a power <math>P_V</math>) to a single point of consumption, modelled by a pure resistance <math>R</math>, when the wires are long enough to have a significant resistance <math>R_C</math>.\n\nIf the resistance are simply [[in series]] without any transformer between them, the circuit acts as a [[voltage divider]], because the same current <math>I=\\frac{V}{R+R_C}</math> runs through the wire resistance and the powered device. As a consequence, the useful power (used at the point of consumption) is:\n:<math>P_R= V_2\\times I = V\\frac{R}{R+R_C}\\times\\frac{V}{R+R_C} = \\frac{R}{R+R_C}\\times\\frac{V^2}{R+R_C} = \\frac{R}{R+R_C} P_V</math>\nAssume now that a transformer converts high-voltage, low-current electricity transported by the wires into low-voltage, high-current electricity for use at the consumption point. If we suppose it is an [[ideal transformer]] with a voltage ratio of <math>a</math> (i.e., the voltage is divided by <math>a</math> and the current is multiplied by <math>a</math> in the secondary branch, compared to the primary branch), then the circuit is again equivalent to a voltage divider, but the transmission wires now have apparent resistance of only <math>R_C/a^2</math>. The useful power is then:\n:<math>P_R= V_2\\times I_2 = \\frac{a^2R\\times V^2}{(a^2 R+R_C)^2} = \\frac{a^2 R}{a^2 R+R_C} P_V = \\frac{R}{R+R_C/a^2} P_V</math>\n\nFor <math>a>1</math> (i.e. conversion of high voltage to low voltage near the consumption point), a larger fraction of the generator's power is transmitted to the consumption point and a lesser fraction is lost to [[Joule heating]].\n\n== Modeling and the transmission matrix ==\n{{Main|Performance and Modelling of AC Transmission}}\n\n[[File:Transmission Line Black Box.JPG|thumb|upright=1.6|\"Black box\" model for transmission line]]Oftentimes, we are only interested in the terminal characteristics of the transmission line, which are the voltage and current at the sending and receiving ends. The transmission line itself is then modeled as a \"black box\" and a 2&nbsp;by&nbsp;2 transmission matrix is used to model its behavior, as follows:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\tV_\\mathrm{S}\\\\\n\tI_\\mathrm{S}\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\tA & B\\\\\n\tC & D\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\tV_\\mathrm{R}\\\\\n\tI_\\mathrm{R}\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe line is assumed to be a reciprocal, symmetrical network, meaning that the receiving and sending labels can be switched with no consequence. The transmission matrix '''T''' also has the following properties:\n* <math>\\det(T) = AD - BC = 1</math>\n* <math>A = D</math>\n\nThe parameters ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' differ depending on how the desired model handles the line's [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] (''R''), [[inductance]] (''L''), [[capacitance]] (''C''), and shunt (parallel, leak) [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] ''G''. The four main models are the short line approximation, the medium line approximation, the long line approximation (with distributed parameters), and the lossless line. In all models described, a capital letter such as ''R'' refers to the total quantity summed over the line and a lowercase letter such as ''c'' refers to the per-unit-length quantity.\n\n===Lossless line===\nThe '''lossless line''' approximation is the least accurate model; it is often used on short lines when the inductance of the line is much greater than its resistance. For this approximation, the voltage and current are identical at the sending and receiving ends.\n[[File:Losslessline.jpg|thumb|Voltage on sending and receiving ends for lossless line]]\nThe characteristic impedance  is pure real, which means resistive for that impedance, and it is often called '''surge impedance''' for a lossless line. When lossless line is terminated by surge impedance, there is no voltage drop. Though the phase angles of voltage and current are rotated, the magnitudes of voltage and current remain constant along the length of the line. For load&nbsp;>&nbsp;SIL, the voltage will drop from sending end and the line will \u201cconsume\u201d VARs. For load&nbsp;<&nbsp;SIL, the voltage will increase from sending end, and the line will \u201cgenerate\u201d VARs.\n\n===Short line===\nThe '''short line''' approximation is normally used for lines less than 50&nbsp;miles long. For a short line, only a series impedance ''Z'' is considered, while ''C'' and ''G'' are ignored. The final result is that '''A&nbsp;=&nbsp;D&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 per unit''', '''B&nbsp;=&nbsp;Z&nbsp;Ohms''', and '''C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0'''. The associated transition matrix for this approximation is therefore:\n:<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\tV_\\mathrm{S}\\\\\n\tI_\\mathrm{S}\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\t1 & Z\\\\\n\t0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\tV_\\mathrm{R}\\\\\n\tI_\\mathrm{R}\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\n===Medium line===\nThe '''medium line''' approximation is used for lines between 50 and 150&nbsp;miles long. In this model, the series impedance and the shunt (current leak) conductance are considered, with half of the shunt conductance being placed at each end of the line. This circuit is often referred to as a \u201cnominal [[\u03c0|''\u03c0'' (pi)]]\u201d circuit because of the shape (''\u03c0'') that is taken on when leak conductance is placed on both sides of the circuit diagram. The analysis of the medium line brings one to the following result:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nA &= D = 1 + \\frac{G Z}{2} \\text{ per unit}\\\\\nB &= Z\\Omega\\\\\nC &= G \\Big( 1 + \\frac{G Z}{4}\\Big)S\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nCounterintuitive behaviors of medium-length transmission lines:\n\n* voltage rise at no load or small current ([[Ferranti effect]])\n* receiving-end current can exceed sending-end current\n\n===Long line===\nThe '''long line''' model is used when a higher degree of accuracy is needed or when the line under consideration is more than 150&nbsp;miles long. Series resistance and shunt conductance are considered as distributed parameters, meaning each differential length of the line has a corresponding differential resistance and shunt admittance. The following result can be applied at any point along the transmission line, where <math>\\gamma</math> is the [[propagation constant]].\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nA &= D = \\cosh(\\gamma x) \\text{ per unit}\\\\[3mm]\nB &= Z_c \\sinh(\\gamma x) \\Omega\\\\[2mm]\nC &= \\frac{1}{Z_c} \\sinh(\\gamma x) S\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTo find the voltage and current at the end of the long line, <math>x</math> should be replaced with <math>l</math> (the line length) in all parameters of the transmission matrix.\n\n(For the full development of this model, see the [[Telegrapher's equations]].)\n\n== High-voltage direct current ==\n{{Main|High-voltage direct current}}\n\nHigh-voltage direct current (HVDC) is used to transmit large amounts of power over long distances or for interconnections between asynchronous grids. When electrical energy is to be transmitted over very long distances, the power lost in AC transmission becomes appreciable and it is less expensive to use [[direct current]] instead of [[alternating current]]. For a very long transmission line, these lower losses (and reduced construction cost of a DC line) can offset the additional cost of the required converter stations at each end.\n\n[[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] is also used for long [[Submarine power cable|submarine cables]] where AC cannot be used because of the cable capacitance.<ref>Donald G. Fink, H. Wayne Beatty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers 11th Edition'', McGraw Hill, 1978, {{ISBN|0-07-020974-X}},  pages 15-57 and 15-58</ref> In these cases special [[high-voltage cable]]s for DC are used. Submarine HVDC systems are often used to connect the electricity grids of islands, for example, between [[Great Britain]] and [[continental Europe]], between Great Britain and [[Ireland]], between [[Tasmania]] and the [[Australia]]n mainland, between the North and South Islands of [[New Zealand]], between [[New Jersey]] and [[New York City]], and between New Jersey and [[Long Island]]. Submarine connections up to {{convert|600|km}} in length are presently in use.<ref name=\"guarnieri 7-3\">{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2013|title=The Alternating Evolution of DC Power Transmission|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=7|issue=3|pages=60\u201363|doi=10.1109/MIE.2013.2272238|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nHVDC links can be used to control problems in the grid with AC electricity flow. The power transmitted by an AC line increases as the [[Electric power#Alternating current|phase angle]] between source end voltage and destination ends increases, but too large a phase angle will allow the systems at either end of the line to fall out of step. Since the power flow in a DC link is controlled independently of the phases of the AC networks at either end of the link, this phase angle limit does not exist, and a DC link is always able to transfer its full rated power. A DC link therefore stabilizes the AC grid at either end, since power flow and phase angle can then be controlled independently.\n\nAs an example, to adjust the flow of AC power on a hypothetical line between [[Seattle]] and [[Boston]] would require adjustment of the relative phase of the two regional electrical grids. This is an everyday occurrence in AC systems, but one that can become disrupted when AC system components fail and place unexpected loads on the remaining working grid system. With an HVDC line instead, such an interconnection would:\n# Convert AC in Seattle into HVDC;\n# Use HVDC for the {{convert|3000|mi|km}} of cross-country transmission; and \n# Convert the HVDC to locally synchronized AC in Boston,\n(and possibly in other cooperating cities along the transmission route). Such a system could be less prone to failure if parts of it were suddenly shut down. One example of a long DC transmission line is the [[Pacific DC Intertie]] located in the Western [[United States]].\n\n== Capacity ==\n<!-- Linked from wind power. -->\nThe amount of power that can be sent over a transmission line is limited. The origins of the limits vary depending on the length of the line. For a short line, the heating of conductors due to line losses sets a thermal limit. If too much current is drawn, conductors may sag too close to the ground, or conductors and equipment may be damaged by overheating. For intermediate-length lines on the order of {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=off}}, the limit is set by the [[voltage drop]] in the line. For longer AC lines, [[Power system stability|system stability]] sets the limit to the power that can be transferred. Approximately, the power flowing over an AC line is proportional to the cosine of the phase angle of the voltage and current at the receiving and transmitting ends. This angle varies depending on system loading and generation. It is undesirable for the angle to approach 90 degrees, as the power flowing decreases but the resistive losses remain. Very approximately, the allowable product of line length and maximum load is proportional to the square of the system voltage. Series capacitors or phase-shifting transformers are used on long lines to improve stability. [[Electric power transmission#High-voltage direct current|High-voltage direct current]] lines are restricted only by thermal and voltage drop limits, since the phase angle is not material to their operation.\n\nUp to now, it has been almost impossible to foresee the temperature distribution along the cable route, so that the maximum applicable current load was usually set as a compromise between understanding of operation conditions and risk minimization. The availability of industrial [[distributed temperature sensing]] (DTS) systems that measure in real time temperatures all along the cable is a first step in monitoring the transmission system capacity. This monitoring solution is based on using passive optical fibers as temperature sensors, either integrated directly inside a high voltage cable or mounted externally on the cable insulation. A solution for overhead lines is also available. In this case the optical fiber is integrated into the core of a phase wire of overhead transmission lines (OPPC). The integrated Dynamic Cable Rating (DCR) or also called Real Time Thermal Rating (RTTR) solution enables not only to continuously monitor the temperature of a high voltage cable circuit in real time, but to safely utilize the existing network capacity to its maximum. Furthermore, it provides the ability to the operator to predict the behavior of the transmission system upon major changes made to its initial operating conditions.\n\n== Control ==\nTo ensure safe and predictable operation, the components of the transmission system are controlled with generators, switches, circuit breakers and loads. The voltage, power, frequency, load factor, and reliability capabilities of the transmission system are designed to provide cost effective performance for the customers.\n\n=== Load balancing ===\nThe transmission system provides for base load and [[peaking power plant|peak load capability]], with safety and fault tolerance margins. The peak load times vary by region largely due to the industry mix. In very hot and very cold climates home air conditioning and heating loads have an effect on the overall load. They are typically highest in the late afternoon in the hottest part of the year and in mid-mornings and mid-evenings in the coldest part of the year. This makes the power requirements vary by the season and the time of day. Distribution system designs always take the base load and the peak load into consideration.\n\nThe transmission system usually does not have a large buffering capability to match the loads with the generation. Thus generation has to be kept matched to the load, to prevent overloading failures of the generation equipment.\n\nMultiple sources and loads can be connected to the transmission system and they must be controlled to provide orderly transfer of power. In centralized power generation, only local control of generation is necessary, and it involves [[alternator synchronization|synchronization of the generation units]], to prevent large transients and overload conditions.\n\nIn [[distributed generation|distributed power generation]] the generators are geographically distributed and the process to bring them online and offline must be carefully controlled. The load control signals can either be sent on separate lines or on the power lines themselves. Voltage and frequency can be used as signalling mechanisms to balance the loads.\n\nIn voltage signaling, the variation of voltage is used to increase generation. The power added by any system increases as the line voltage decreases. This arrangement is stable in principle. Voltage-based regulation is complex to use in mesh networks, since the individual components and setpoints would need to be reconfigured every time a new generator is added to the mesh.\n\nIn frequency signaling, the generating units match the frequency of the power transmission system. In [[droop speed control]], if the frequency decreases, the power is increased. (The drop in line frequency is an indication that the increased load is causing the generators to slow down.)\n\n[[Wind turbine]]s, [[vehicle-to-grid]] and other locally distributed storage and generation systems can be connected to the power grid, and interact with it to improve system operation. Internationally, the trend has been a slow move from a heavily centralized power system to a decentralized power system. The main draw of locally distributed generation systems which involve a number of new and innovative solutions is that they reduce transmission losses by leading to consumption of electricity closer to where it was produced.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url = https://www.en-powered.com/blog/the-bumpy-road-to-energy-deregulation | title = The Bumpy Road to Energy Deregulation\n  | publisher = EnPowered  | date = 2016-03-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Failure protection ===\nUnder excess load conditions, the system can be designed to fail gracefully rather than all at once. [[Brownout (electricity)|Brownouts]] occur when the supply power drops below the demand. [[Power outage|Blackouts]] occur when the supply fails completely.\n\n[[Rolling blackout]]s (also called load shedding) are intentionally engineered electrical power outages, used to distribute insufficient power when the demand for electricity exceeds the supply.\n\n== Communications ==\nOperators of long transmission lines require reliable communications for [[SCADA|control]] of the power grid and, often, associated generation and distribution facilities. Fault-sensing [[protective relay]]s at each end of the line must communicate to monitor the flow of power into and out of the protected line section so that faulted conductors or equipment can be quickly de-energized and the balance of the system restored. Protection of the transmission line from [[short circuit]]s and other faults is usually so critical that [[common carrier]] telecommunications are insufficiently reliable, and in remote areas a common carrier may not be available. Communication systems associated with a transmission project may use:\n* [[Microwave]]s\n* [[Power-line communication]]\n* [[Optical fiber]]s\nRarely, and for short distances, a utility will use pilot-wires strung along the transmission line path. Leased circuits from common carriers are not preferred since availability is not under control of the electric power transmission organization.\n\nTransmission lines can also be used to carry data: this is called power-line carrier, or [[power line communication|PLC]]. PLC signals can be easily received with a radio for the long wave range.\n\nOptical fibers can be included in the stranded conductors of a transmission line, in the overhead shield wires. These cables are known as [[optical ground wire]] (''OPGW''). Sometimes a standalone cable is used, all-dielectric self-supporting (''ADSS'') cable, attached to the transmission line cross arms.\n\nSome jurisdictions, such as [[Minnesota]], prohibit energy transmission companies from selling surplus communication bandwidth or acting as a telecommunications [[common carrier]]. Where the regulatory structure permits, the utility can sell capacity in extra [[dark fiber]]s to a common carrier, providing another revenue stream.\n\n== Electricity market reform ==\n{{Main|Electricity market}}\n\nSome regulators regard electric transmission to be a [[natural monopoly]]<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/iw/2004/08/15/stories/2004081501201300.htm\n | title = Power transmission business is a natural monopoly\n | author = Raghuvir Srinivasan\n | publisher = The Hindu\n | work = The Hindu Business Line\n | date = August 15, 2004\n | accessdate = January 31, 2008\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.reason.org/commentaries/kiesling_20030818b.shtml\n | title = Rethink the Natural Monopoly Justification of Electricity Regulation\n | author = Lynne Kiesling\n | publisher = Reason Foundation\n | date = 18 August 2003\n | accessdate = 31 January 2008\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080213034400/http://www.reason.org/commentaries/kiesling_20030818b.shtml\n | archive-date = February 13, 2008\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref> and there are moves in many countries to separately regulate transmission (see [[electricity market]]).\n\n[[Spain]] was the first country to establish a [[regional transmission organization]].

Also, it is difficult for a merchant transmission line to compete when the alternative transmission lines are subsidized by incumbent utility businesses with a monopolized and regulated rate base.<ref>{{cite book\n | author = Fiona Woolf\n | title = Global Transmission Expansion\n | publisher = Pennwell Books\n |date=February 2003\n | pages = 226, 247\n | isbn = 0-87814-862-0\n}}</ref> In the United States, the [[FERC]]'s Order 1000, issued in 2010, attempts to reduce barriers to third party investment and creation of merchant transmission lines where a public policy need is found.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ferc.gov/industries/electric/indus-act/trans-plan.asp|title=FERC: Industries - Order No. 1000 - Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation|website=www.ferc.gov}}</ref>\n\n== Health concerns ==\n{{Main|Electromagnetic radiation and health}}\n\nSome large studies, including a large study in the United States, have failed to find any link between living near power lines and developing any sickness or diseases, such as cancer. A 1997 study found that it did not matter how close one was to a power line or a sub-station, there was no increased risk of cancer or illness.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/helthrpt/stories/s175.htm Power Lines and Cancer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417202936/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/helthrpt/stories/s175.htm |date=April 17, 2011 }}, The Health Report / ABC Science - Broadcast on 7&nbsp;June 1997 (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)</ref>\n\nThe mainstream scientific evidence suggests that low-power, low-frequency, electromagnetic radiation associated with household currents and high transmission power lines does not constitute a short or long-term health hazard. Some studies, however, have found [[statistical correlation]]s between various diseases and living or working near power lines. No adverse health effects have been substantiated for people not living close to powerlines.<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs322/en/ Electromagnetic fields and public health], [[World Health Organization]]</ref>\n\nThe [[New York State Public Service Commission]] conducted a study, documented in ''Opinion No. 78-13'' (issued June 19, 1978), to evaluate potential health effects of electric fields. The study's case number is too old to be listed as a case number in the commission's online database, DMM, and so the original study can be difficult to find. The study chose to utilize the electric field strength that was measured at the edge of an existing (but newly built) right-of-way on a 765 kV transmission line from New York to Canada, 1.6 kV/m, as the interim standard maximum electric field at the edge of any new transmission line right-of-way built in New York State after issuance of the order. The opinion also limited the voltage of all new transmission lines built in New York to 345 kV. On September 11, 1990, after a similar study of magnetic field strengths, the NYSPSC issued their ''Interim Policy Statement on Magnetic Fields''. This study established a magnetic field interim standard of 200 mG at the edge of the right-of-way using the winter-normal conductor rating. This later document can also be difficult to find on the NYSPSC's online database, since it predates the online database system. As a comparison with everyday items, a hair dryer or electric blanket produces a 100 mG - 500 mG magnetic field. An electric razor can produce 2.6 kV/m. Whereas electric fields can be shielded, magnetic fields cannot be shielded, but are usually minimized by optimizing the location of each phase of a circuit in cross-section.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/Common/ViewDoc.aspx?DocRefId=%7BED95C2A2-2DEA-4FFC-A8DA-CD9C39F5D361%7D|title=EMF Report for the CHPE|pp=1\u20134|publisher=TRC|date=March 2010|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.transpower.co.nz/sites/default/files/publications/resources/EMF-fact-sheet-3-2009.pdf|title=Electric and Magnetic Field Strengths|publisher=Transpower New Zealand Ltd|p=2|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen a new transmission line is proposed, within the application to the applicable regulatory body (usually a public utility commission), there is often an analysis of electric and magnetic field levels at the edge of rights-of-way. These analyses are performed by a utility or by an electrical engineering consultant using modelling software. At least one state public utility commission has access to software developed by an engineer or engineers at the [[Bonneville Power Administration]] to analyze electric and magnetic fields at edge of rights-of-way for proposed transmission lines. Often, public utility commissions will not comment on any health impacts due to electric and magnetic fields and will refer information seekers to the state's affiliated department of health.\n\nThere are established biological effects for [[Acute toxicity|acute]] ''high'' level exposure to magnetic fields well above 100&nbsp;[[Tesla (unit)|\u00b5T]] (1&nbsp;[[Gauss (unit)|G]]) (1,000 mG).

It was originally established by Congress in 1920 as the Federal Power Commission and has since undergone multiple name and responsibility modifications. That which is not regulated by FERC, primarily electric power distribution and the retail sale of power, is under the jurisdiction of state authority.\n\nTwo of the more notable U.S. energy policies impacting electricity transmission are [[Order No. 888]] and the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]].\n\nOrder No.&nbsp;888 adopted by FERC on 24&nbsp;April 1996, was \u201cdesigned to remove impediments to competition in the wholesale bulk power marketplace and to bring more efficient, lower cost power to the Nation\u2019s electricity consumers. The legal and policy cornerstone of these rules is to remedy undue discrimination in access to the monopoly owned transmission wires that control whether and to whom electricity can be transported in interstate commerce.\u201d<ref name=\"Docket No. RM95-8-000\">{{cite web|title=Order No. 888|url=https://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/land-docs/rm95-8-00w.txt|publisher=United States of America Federal Energy Regulatory Commission}}</ref> Order No.&nbsp;888 required all public utilities that own, control, or operate facilities used for transmitting electric energy in interstate commerce, to have open access non-discriminatory transmission tariffs. These tariffs allow any electricity generator to utilize the already existing power lines for the transmission of the power that they generate. Order No.&nbsp;888 also permits public utilities to recover the costs associated with providing their power lines as an open access service.<ref name=\"Docket No. RM95-8-000\"/><ref name=\"Order No. 888\">{{cite web|last1=Order No. 888|title=Promoting Wholesale Competition Through Open Access Non-discriminatory Transmission Services by Public Utilities; Recovery of Stranded Costs by Public Utilities and Transmitting Utilities |first1=FERC|url=https://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/land-docs/order888.asp}}</ref>\n\nThe Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct) signed into law by congress on 8&nbsp;August 2005, further expanded the federal authority of regulating power transmission. EPAct gave FERC significant new responsibilities including but not limited to the enforcement of electric transmission reliability standards and the establishment of rate incentives to encourage investment in electric transmission.<ref>{{cite book|title=Energy Policy Act of 2005 Fact Sheet|date=8 August 2006|publisher=FERC Washington, D.C.|url=https://www.ferc.gov/legal/fed-sta/epact-fact-sheet.pdf}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, local governments have exercised authority over the grid and have significant disincentives to encourage actions that would benefit states other than their own. Localities with cheap electricity have a disincentive to encourage making [[interstate commerce]] in electricity trading easier, since other regions will be able to compete for local energy and drive up rates. For example, some regulators in Maine do not wish to address congestion problems because the congestion serves to keep Maine rates low.<ref name=ncep2>{{cite journal|url=http://www.oe.energy.gov/DocumentsandMedia/primer.pdf|title=Electricity Transmission: A primer|author=National Council on Electricity Policy|page=32 (page&nbsp;41 in .pdf)|format=PDF|journal=|access-date=December 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201222708/http://www.oe.energy.gov/DocumentsandMedia/primer.pdf|archive-date=December 1, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Further, vocal local constituencies can block or slow permitting by pointing to visual impact, environmental, and perceived health concerns. In the US, generation is growing four times faster than transmission, but big transmission upgrades require the coordination of multiple states, a multitude of interlocking permits, and cooperation between a significant portion of the 500 companies that own the grid. From a policy perspective, the control of the grid is [[balkanized]], and even former [[United States Secretary of Energy|energy secretary]] [[Bill Richardson]] refers to it as a ''third world grid''. There have been efforts in the EU and US to confront the problem. The US national security interest in significantly growing transmission capacity drove passage of the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005|2005 energy act]] giving the Department of Energy the authority to approve transmission if states refuse to act. However, soon after the Department of Energy used its power to designate two [[National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor]]s, 14&nbsp;senators signed a letter stating the DOE was being too aggressive.<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Wald  | first = Matthew  | title = Wind Energy Bumps into Power Grid\u2019s Limits  | date=27 August 2008  | page=A1  | accessdate=12 December 2008  | work=[[The New York Times]]  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/business/27grid.html?_r=2&ref=business&oref=slogin}}</ref>\n\n== Special transmission ==\n\n=== Grids for railways ===\n{{Main|Traction power network}}\n\nIn some countries where [[electric locomotive]]s or [[electric multiple unit]]s run on low frequency AC power, there are separate single phase [[traction power network]]s operated by the railways.

It is principally used for rural electrification, but also finds use for larger isolated loads such as water pumps. Single wire earth return is also used for HVDC over submarine power cables.\n\n=== Wireless power transmission ===\n{{Main|Wireless energy transfer}}\n\nBoth [[Nikola Tesla]] and [[Hidetsugu Yagi]] attempted to devise systems for large scale wireless power transmission in the late 1800s and early 1900s, with no commercial success.\n\nIn November 2009, LaserMotive won the NASA 2009 Power Beaming Challenge by powering a cable climber 1&nbsp;km vertically using a ground-based laser transmitter. The system produced up to 1&nbsp;kW of power at the receiver end. In August 2010, NASA contracted with private companies to pursue the design of laser power beaming systems to power low earth orbit satellites and to launch rockets using laser power beams.\n\nWireless power transmission has been studied for transmission of power from [[solar power satellite]]s to the earth.

The interconnected lines which facilitate this movement are known as a ''transmission network''. This is distinct from the local wiring between high-voltage substations and customers, which is typically referred to as [[electric power distribution]]. The combined transmission and distribution network is part of [[electricity delivery]], known as the \"[[power grid]]\" in [[North America]], or just \"the grid\". In the [[United Kingdom]], [[India]], [[Tanzania]], [[Myanmar]], [[Malaysia]] and [[New Zealand]], the network is known as the National Grid.\n\nA  [[wide area synchronous grid]], also known as an \"interconnection\" in North America, directly connects many generators delivering AC power with the same relative ''frequency'' to many consumers. For example, there are four major interconnections in North America (the [[Western Interconnection]], the [[Eastern Interconnection]], the [[Quebec Interconnection]] and the [[Electric Reliability Council of Texas]] (ERCOT) grid). In Europe [[Synchronous grid of Continental Europe|one large grid connects most of continental Europe]].\n\nHistorically, transmission and distribution lines were owned by the same company, but starting in the 1990s, many countries have [[Electricity liberalization|liberalized]] the regulation of the [[electricity market]] in ways that have led to the separation of the electricity transmission business from the distribution business.<ref name=femp01>{{cite journal|url=https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-13906.pdf|title=A Primer on Electric Utilities, Deregulation, and Restructuring of U.S. Electricity Markets|publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]] [[Federal Energy Management Program]] (FEMP)|date=May 2002|format=PDF|accessdate=October 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== System ==\nMost transmission lines are high-voltage [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] [[alternating current]] (AC), although [[single-phase electric power|single phase]] AC is sometimes used in [[railway electrification system]]s. [[High-voltage direct current|High-voltage direct-current]] (HVDC) technology is used for greater efficiency over very long distances (typically hundreds of miles). HVDC technology is also used in [[submarine power cable]]s (typically longer than 30 miles (50&nbsp;km)), and in the interchange of power between grids that are not mutually synchronized. HVDC links are used to stabilize large power distribution networks where sudden new loads, or blackouts, in one part of a network can result in synchronization problems and [[cascading failure]]s.\n\n[[File:Electricity grid simple- North America.svg|thumb|400px|left|Diagram of an electric power system; transmission system is in blue]]\n\nElectricity is transmitted at [[high voltage]]s (66&nbsp;kV or above) to reduce the energy loss which occurs  in long-distance transmission. Power is usually transmitted through [[overhead power line]]s. [[Undergrounding|Underground power transmission]] has a significantly higher installation cost and greater operational limitations, but reduced maintenance costs. Underground transmission is sometimes used in urban areas or environmentally sensitive locations.\n\nA lack of electrical energy storage facilities in transmission systems leads to a key limitation. Electrical energy must be generated at the same rate at which it is consumed. A sophisticated control system is required to ensure that the [[power generation]] very closely matches the demand. If the demand for power exceeds supply, the imbalance can cause generation plant(s) and transmission equipment to automatically disconnect or shut down to prevent damage. In the worst case, this may lead to a cascading series of shut downs and a major regional [[power outage|blackout]]. Examples include the US Northeast blackouts of [[Northeast Blackout of 1965|1965]], [[New York City blackout of 1977|1977]], [[Northeast blackout of 2003|2003]], and major blackouts in other US regions in [[1996 Western North America blackouts|1996]] and [[2011 Southwest blackout|2011]]. Electric transmission networks are interconnected into regional, national, and even continent wide networks to reduce the risk of such a failure by providing multiple [[redundancy (engineering)|redundant]], alternative routes for power to flow should such shut downs occur. Transmission companies determine the maximum reliable capacity of each line (ordinarily less than its physical or thermal limit) to ensure that spare capacity is available in the event of a failure in another part of the network.\n\n== Overhead transmission ==\n{{Main|Overhead power line}}\n[[File:High Voltage Lines in Washington State.tif|thumb|upright=0.75|left|3-phase high-voltage lines in Washington State, \"Bundled\" 3-ways]]\n\n{{multiple image\n |direction = vertical\n |align = right\n |width = 225\n |image1=Electric power transmission line.JPG\n |image2=Sample cross-section of high tension power (pylon) line.jpg\n |caption1=Four-circuit, two-voltage power transmission line; \"Bundled\" 2-ways\n |caption2=A typical [[Aluminium-conductor steel-reinforced cable|ACSR]]. The conductor consists of seven strands of steel surrounded by four layers of aluminium.\n}}\n\nHigh-voltage overhead conductors are not covered by insulation. The conductor material is nearly always an [[aluminum]] alloy, made into several strands and possibly reinforced with steel strands. Copper was sometimes used for overhead transmission, but aluminum is lighter, yields only marginally reduced performance and costs much less. Overhead conductors are a commodity supplied by several companies worldwide. Improved conductor material and shapes are regularly used to allow increased capacity and modernize transmission circuits. Conductor sizes range from 12&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup> (#6 [[American wire gauge]]) to 750&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup> (1,590,000&nbsp;[[Circular mil|circular mils]] area), with varying resistance and [[current-carrying capacity]]. For normal AC lines thicker wires would lead to a relatively small increase in capacity due to the [[skin effect]] (which causes most of the current to flow close to the surface of the wire). Because of this current limitation, multiple parallel cables (called [[bundle conductor]]s) are used when higher capacity is needed. Bundle conductors are also used at high voltages to reduce energy loss caused by [[corona discharge]].\n\nToday, transmission-level voltages are usually considered to be 110&nbsp;kV and above. Lower voltages, such as 66&nbsp;kV and 33&nbsp;kV, are usually considered [[#Subtransmission|subtransmission]] voltages, but are occasionally used on long lines with light loads. Voltages less than 33&nbsp;kV are usually used for [[electricity distribution|distribution]]. Voltages above 765&nbsp;kV are considered [[high voltage#Power lines|extra high voltage]] and require different designs compared to equipment used at lower voltages.\n\nSince overhead transmission wires depend on air for insulation, the design of these lines requires minimum clearances to be observed to maintain safety. Adverse weather conditions, such as high winds and low temperatures, can lead to power outages. Wind speeds as low as {{convert|23|kn|km/h}} can permit conductors to encroach operating clearances, resulting in a [[Electric arc|flashover]] and loss of supply.<ref>Hans Dieter Betz, Ulrich Schumann, Pierre Laroche (2009).

Underground cables take up less right-of-way than overhead lines, have lower visibility, and are less affected by bad weather. However, costs of insulated cable and excavation are much higher than overhead construction. Faults in buried transmission lines take longer to locate and repair.\n\nIn some metropolitan areas, underground transmission cables are enclosed by metal pipe and insulated with dielectric fluid (usually an oil) that is either static or circulated via pumps. If an electric fault damages the pipe and produces a dielectric leak into the surrounding soil, liquid nitrogen trucks are mobilized to freeze portions of the pipe to enable the draining and repair of the damaged pipe location. This type of underground transmission cable can prolong the repair period and increase repair costs. The temperature of the pipe and soil are usually monitored constantly throughout the repair period.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/16/us/after-attacks-workers-con-edison-crews-improvise-they-rewire-truncated-system.html|title=AFTER THE ATTACKS: THE WORKERS; Con Edison Crews Improvise as They Rewire a Truncated System|first=Neela|last=Banerjee|date=September 16, 2001|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/Common/ViewDoc.aspx?DocRefId={5B2369A6-97FC-4613-AD8B-91E23D41AC05} |title=INVESTIGATION OF THE SEPTEMBER 2013 ELECTRIC OUTAGE OF A PORTION OF METRO-NORTH RAILROAD\u2019S NEW HAVEN LINE |publisher=documents.dps.ny.gov |date=2014 |accessdate=2019-12-29}}</ref><ref>NYSPSC case no. 13-E-0529</ref>\n\nUnderground lines are strictly limited by their thermal capacity, which permits less overload or re-rating than overhead lines. Long underground AC cables have significant [[capacitance]], which may reduce their ability to provide useful power to loads beyond {{convert|50|mi|abbr=off}}. DC cables are not limited in length by their capacitance, however, they do require [[HVDC converter station]]s at both ends of the line to convert from DC to AC before being interconnected with the transmission network.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of electric power transmission}}\n[[File:New York utility lines in 1890.jpg|thumb|New York City streets in 1890. Besides telegraph lines, multiple electric lines were required for each class of device requiring different voltages]]\n\nIn the early days of commercial electric power, transmission of electric power at the same voltage as used by lighting and mechanical loads restricted the distance between generating plant and consumers. In 1882, generation was with [[direct current]] (DC), which could not easily be increased in voltage for long-distance transmission. Different classes of loads (for example, lighting, fixed motors, and traction/railway systems) required different voltages, and so used different generators and circuits.<ref name=hughes>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=g07Q9M4agp4C&pg=PA122&lpg=PA122&dq=westinghouse+%22universal+system%22|pages=119\u2013122|author=Thomas P.

These included single phase AC systems, poly-phase AC systems, low voltage incandescent lighting, high voltage arc lighting, and existing DC motors in factories and street cars.

By 1914, fifty-five transmission systems each operating at more than 70 kV were in service. The highest voltage then used was 150 kV.<ref>Bureau of Census data reprinted in Hughes, pp.&nbsp;282\u2013283</ref>\nBy allowing multiple generating plants to be interconnected over a wide area, electricity production cost was reduced. The most efficient available plants could be used to supply the varying loads during the day. Reliability was improved and capital investment cost was reduced, since stand-by generating capacity could be shared over many more customers and a wider geographic area. Remote and low-cost sources of energy, such as [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power or mine-mouth coal, could be exploited to lower energy production cost.<ref name=\"hughes\" /><ref name=\"guarnieri 7-2\"/>\n\nThe rapid industrialization in the 20th&nbsp;century made electrical transmission lines and grids [[critical infrastructure]] items in most industrialized nations. The interconnection of local generation plants and small distribution networks was spurred by the requirements of [[World War I]], with large electrical generating plants built by governments to provide power to munitions factories. Later these generating plants were connected to supply civil loads through long-distance transmission.<ref>Hughes, pp.&nbsp;293\u2013295</ref>{{clear left}}\n\n== Bulk power transmission ==\n[[File:Transmissionsubstation.jpg|thumb|A [[Electrical substation|transmission substation]] decreases the voltage of incoming electricity, allowing it to connect from long distance high voltage transmission, to local lower voltage distribution. It also reroutes power to other transmission lines that serve local markets. This is the [[PacifiCorp]] Hale Substation, [[Orem, Utah]], USA]]\n\nEngineers design transmission networks to transport the energy as efficiently as possible, while at the same time taking into account the economic factors, network safety and redundancy. These networks use components such as power lines, cables, [[circuit breaker]]s, switches and [[transformer]]s. The transmission network is usually administered on a regional basis by an entity such as a [[regional transmission organization]] or [[transmission system operator]].\n\nTransmission efficiency is greatly improved by devices that increase the voltage (and thereby proportionately reduce the current), in the line conductors, thus allowing power to be transmitted with acceptable losses. The reduced current flowing through the line reduces the heating losses in the conductors. According to [[Joule's first law|Joule's Law]], energy losses are directly proportional to the square of the current. Thus, reducing the current by a factor of two will lower the energy lost to conductor resistance by a factor of four for any given size of conductor.\n\nThe optimum size of a conductor for a given voltage and current can be estimated by [[Kelvin's law for conductor size]], which states that the size is at its optimum when the annual cost of energy wasted in the resistance is equal to the annual capital charges of providing the conductor. At times of lower interest rates, Kelvin's law indicates that thicker wires are optimal; while, when metals are expensive, thinner conductors are indicated: however, power lines are designed for long-term use, so Kelvin's law has to be used in conjunction with long-term estimates of the price of copper and aluminum as well as interest rates for capital.\n\nThe increase in voltage is achieved in AC circuits by using a ''step-up [[transformer]]''. [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] systems require relatively costly conversion equipment which may be economically justified for particular projects such as submarine cables and longer distance high capacity point-to-point transmission. HVDC is necessary for the import and export of energy between grid systems that are not synchronized with each other.\n\nA transmission grid is a network of [[power station]]s, transmission lines, and [[Electrical substation|substations]]. Energy is usually transmitted within a grid with [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] [[alternating current|AC]]. Single-phase AC is used only for distribution to end users since it is not usable for large polyphase [[induction motor]]s. In the 19th&nbsp;century, two-phase transmission was used but required either four wires or three wires with unequal currents. Higher order phase systems require more than three wires, but deliver little or no benefit.\n\n[[File:ElectricityUCTE.svg|thumb|left|The [[wide area synchronous grid|synchronous grids]] of the [[European Union]]]]\n\nThe price of electric power station capacity is high, and electric demand is variable, so it is often cheaper to import some portion of the needed power than to generate it locally. Because loads are often regionally correlated (hot weather in the Southwest portion of the US might cause many people to use air conditioners), electric power often comes from distant sources. Because of the economic benefits of load sharing between regions, [[wide area synchronous grid|wide area transmission grids]] now span countries and even continents. The web of interconnections between power producers and consumers should enable power to flow, even if some links are inoperative.\n\nThe unvarying (or slowly varying over many hours) portion of the electric demand is known as the ''[[base load power plant|base load]]'' and is generally served by large facilities (which are more efficient due to economies of scale) with fixed costs for fuel and operation. Such facilities are nuclear, coal-fired or hydroelectric, while other energy sources such as [[Solar thermal energy|concentrated solar thermal]] and [[geothermal power]] have the potential to provide base load power. Renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaics, wind, wave, and tidal, are, due to their intermittency, not considered as supplying \"base load\" but will still add power to the grid. The remaining or 'peak' power demand, is supplied by [[peaking power plant]]s, which are typically smaller, faster-responding, and higher cost sources, such as combined cycle or combustion turbine plants fueled by natural gas.\n\nLong-distance transmission of electricity (hundreds of kilometers) is cheap and efficient, with costs of US$0.005\u20130.02 per kWh (compared to annual averaged large producer costs of US$0.01\u20130.025 per kWh, retail rates upwards of US$0.10 per kWh, and multiples of retail for instantaneous suppliers at unpredicted highest demand moments).<ref name=\"limits-of-very-long-distance\"/> Thus distant suppliers can be cheaper than local sources (e.g., New York often buys over 1000&nbsp;MW of electricity from Canada).<ref>{{cite web|title=NYISO Zone Maps|url=http://www.nyiso.com/public/markets_operations/market_data/maps/index.jsp|publisher=New York Independent System Operator|accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref>  Multiple '''local sources''' (even if more expensive and infrequently used) can make the transmission grid more fault tolerant to weather and other disasters that can disconnect distant suppliers.\n\n[[File:Electicaltransmissionlines3800ppx.JPG|thumb|A high-power electrical transmission tower, 230&nbsp;kV, double-circuit, also double-bundled]]\n\nLong-distance transmission allows remote renewable energy resources to be used to displace fossil fuel consumption. Hydro and wind sources cannot be moved closer to populous cities, and solar costs are lowest in remote areas where local power needs are minimal. Connection costs alone can determine whether any particular renewable alternative is economically sensible. Costs can be prohibitive for transmission lines, but various proposals for massive infrastructure investment in high capacity, very long distance [[super grid]] transmission networks could be recovered with modest usage fees.\n\n=== Grid input ===\nAt the [[power station]]s, the power is produced at a relatively low voltage between about 2.3&nbsp;kV and 30&nbsp;kV, depending on the size of the unit. The generator terminal voltage is then stepped up by the power station [[transformer]] to a higher [[voltage]] (115&nbsp;kV to 765&nbsp;kV AC, varying by the transmission system and by the country) for transmission over long distances.\n\nIn the United States, power transmission is, variously, 230&nbsp;kV to 500&nbsp;kV, with less than 230&nbsp;kV or more than 500&nbsp;kV being local exceptions.\n\nFor example, the Western System has two primary interchange voltages: 500&nbsp;kV AC at 60&nbsp;Hz, and \u00b1500&nbsp;kV (1,000&nbsp;kV net) DC from North to South ([[Columbia River]] to [[Southern California]]) and Northeast to Southwest (Utah to Southern California). The 287.5&nbsp;kV ([[Hoover Dam|Hoover]] to [[Los Angeles]] line, via [[Victorville]]) and 345&nbsp;kV ([[Arizona Public Service|APS]] line) being local standards, both of which were implemented before 500&nbsp;kV became practical, and thereafter the Western System standard for long distance AC power transmission.\n\n=== Losses ===\nTransmitting electricity at high voltage reduces the fraction of energy lost to [[Joule heating|resistance]], which varies depending on the specific conductors, the current flowing, and the length of the transmission line. For example, a {{convert|100|mile|abbr=on}} span at 765&nbsp;kV carrying 1000&nbsp;MW of power can have losses of 1.1% to 0.5%. A 345&nbsp;kV line carrying the same load across the same distance has losses of 4.2%.<ref>American Electric Power, Transmission Facts, page&nbsp;4: https://web.archive.org/web/20110604181007/https://www.aep.com/about/transmission/docs/transmission-facts.pdf</ref> For a given amount of power, a higher voltage reduces the current and thus the [[resistive loss]]es in the conductor. For example, raising the voltage by a factor of 10 reduces the current by a corresponding factor of 10 and therefore the <math>I^2 R</math> losses by a factor of 100, provided the same sized conductors are used in both cases. Even if the conductor size (cross-sectional area) is decreased ten-fold to match the lower current, the <math>I^2 R</math> losses are still reduced ten-fold. Long-distance transmission is typically done with overhead lines at voltages of 115 to 1,200&nbsp;kV. At extremely high voltages, more than 2,000&nbsp;kV exists between conductor and ground, [[corona discharge]] losses are so large that they can offset the lower resistive losses in the line conductors. Measures to reduce corona losses include conductors having larger diameters; often hollow to save weight,<ref>[http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/environment/info/aspen/deltasub/pea/16_corona_and_induced_currents.pdf California Public Utilities Commission] Corona and induced currents</ref> or bundles of two or more conductors.\n\nFactors that affect the resistance, and thus loss, of conductors used in transmission and distribution lines include temperature, spiraling, and the [[skin effect]]. The resistance of a conductor increases with its temperature. Temperature changes in electric power lines can have a significant effect on power losses in the line. Spiraling, which refers to the way stranded conductors spiral about the center, also contributes to increases in conductor resistance. The skin effect causes the effective resistance of a conductor to increase at higher alternating current frequencies.  Corona and resistive losses can be estimated using a mathematical model.<ref>{{cite web |title=AC Transmission Line Losses |author=Curt Harting |date=October 24, 2010 |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2010/ph240/harting1/ |accessdate=June 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nTransmission and distribution losses in the USA were estimated at 6.6% in 1997,<ref name=\"tonto.eia.doe.gov\">{{cite web |url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=105&t=3 |title=Where can I find data on electricity transmission and distribution losses? |date=19 November 2009 |work=Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Electricity |publisher=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]] |accessdate=29 March 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> 6.5% in 2007<ref name=\"tonto.eia.doe.gov\"/> and 5% from 2013 to 2019.<ref name=\"eia.gov\">{{cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=105&t=3|title=How much electricity is lost in electricity transmission and distribution in the United States? |date=9 January 2019 |work=Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Electricity |publisher=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]] |accessdate=27 February 2019}}</ref> In general, losses are estimated from the discrepancy between power produced (as reported by power plants) and power sold to the end customers; the difference between what is produced and what is consumed constitute transmission and distribution losses, assuming no utility theft occurs.\n\nAs of 1980, the longest cost-effective distance for [[Direct current|direct-current]] transmission was determined to be {{convert|7000|km|mi|abbr=off}}.

Currents that flow solely in \u2018reaction\u2019 to these properties of the circuit, (which together with the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] define the [[electrical impedance|impedance]]) constitute [[reactive power]] flow, which transmits no \u2018real\u2019 power to the load. These reactive currents, however, are very real and cause extra heating losses in the transmission circuit. The ratio of 'real' power (transmitted to the load) to 'apparent' power (the product of a circuit's voltage and current, without reference to phase angle) is the [[power factor]]. As reactive current increases, the reactive power increases and the power factor decreases. For transmission systems with low power factor, losses are higher than for systems with high power factor. Utilities add capacitor banks, reactors and other components (such as [[phase-shifting transformer]]s; [[static VAR compensator]]s; and [[flexible AC transmission system]]s, FACTS) throughout the system help to compensate for the reactive power flow, reduce the losses in power transmission and stabilize system voltages. These measures are collectively called 'reactive support'.\n\n=== Transposition ===\nCurrent flowing through transmission lines induces a magnetic field that surrounds the lines of each phase and affects the [[inductance]] of the surrounding conductors of other phases. The mutual inductance of the conductors is partially dependent on the physical orientation of the lines with respect to each other. Three-phase power transmission lines are conventionally strung with phases separated on different vertical levels. The mutual inductance seen by a conductor of the phase in the middle of the other two phases will be different than the inductance seen by the conductors on the top or bottom. An imbalanced inductance among the three conductors is problematic because it may result in the middle line carrying a disproportionate amount of the total power transmitted. Similarly, an imbalanced load may occur if one line is consistently closest to the ground and operating at a lower impedance. Because of this phenomenon, conductors must be periodically transposed along the length of the transmission line so that each phase sees equal time in each relative position to balance out the mutual inductance seen by all three phases. To accomplish this, line position is swapped at specially designed [[transposition tower]]s at regular intervals along the length of the transmission line in various [[Transposition (telecommunications)|transposition schemes]].\n\n=== Subtransmission ===\n[[File:Cavite, Batangas jf0557 11.jpg|thumb|175px|A 115&nbsp;kV subtransmission line in the [[Philippines]], along with 20&nbsp;kV [[Electric power distribution|distribution]] lines and a [[street light]], all mounted in a wood [[Utility pole|subtransmission pole]]]]\n[[File:Wood Pole Structure.JPG|thumb|173px|115 kV H-frame transmission tower]]\n\n'''Subtransmission''' is part of an electric power transmission system that runs at relatively lower voltages. It is uneconomical to connect all [[electrical substation|distribution substation]]s to the high main transmission voltage, because the equipment is larger and more expensive. Typically, only larger substations connect with this high voltage. It is stepped down and sent to smaller substations in towns and neighborhoods. Subtransmission circuits are usually arranged in loops so that a single line failure does not cut off service to many customers for more than a short time. Loops can be \"normally closed\", where loss of one circuit should result in no interruption, or \"normally open\" where substations can switch to a backup supply. While subtransmission circuits are usually carried on [[Overhead power line|overhead lines]], in urban areas buried cable may be used. The lower-voltage subtransmission lines use less right-of-way and simpler structures; it is much more feasible to put them underground where needed. Higher-voltage lines require more space and are usually above-ground since putting them underground is very expensive.\n\nThere is no fixed cutoff between subtransmission and transmission, or subtransmission and [[Electric power distribution|distribution]]. The voltage ranges overlap somewhat. Voltages of 69&nbsp;kV, 115&nbsp;kV, and 138&nbsp;kV are often used for subtransmission in North America. As power systems evolved, voltages formerly used for transmission were used for subtransmission, and subtransmission voltages became distribution voltages. Like transmission, subtransmission moves relatively large amounts of power, and like distribution, subtransmission covers an area instead of just point-to-point.<ref>Donald G. Fink and H. Wayne Beaty. (2007), ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers (15th&nbsp;Edition)''. McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|978-0-07-144146-9}} section&nbsp;18.5</ref>\n\n=== Transmission grid exit ===\nAt the [[electrical substation|substations]], transformers reduce the voltage to a lower level for [[Electric power distribution|distribution]] to commercial and residential users. This distribution is accomplished with a combination of sub-transmission (33 to 132&nbsp;kV) and distribution (3.3 to 25&nbsp;kV). Finally, at the point of use, the energy is transformed to low voltage (varying by country and customer requirements &ndash; see [[Mains electricity by country]]).\n\n== Advantage of high-voltage power transmission ==\n{{See also|ideal transformer}}\nHigh-voltage power transmission allows for lesser resistive losses over long distances in the wiring. This efficiency of high voltage transmission allows for the transmission of a larger proportion of the generated power to the substations and in turn to the loads, translating to operational cost savings.\n\n[[File:Power split two resistances.svg|thumb|Electrical grid without a transformer.]]\n[[File:Transformer power split.svg|thumb|Electrical grid with a transformer.]]\nIn a very simplified model, assume the [[electrical grid]] delivers electricity from a generator (modelled as an [[ideal voltage source]] with voltage <math>V</math>, delivering a power <math>P_V</math>) to a single point of consumption, modelled by a pure resistance <math>R</math>, when the wires are long enough to have a significant resistance <math>R_C</math>.\n\nIf the resistance are simply [[in series]] without any transformer between them, the circuit acts as a [[voltage divider]], because the same current <math>I=\\frac{V}{R+R_C}</math> runs through the wire resistance and the powered device. As a consequence, the useful power (used at the point of consumption) is:\n:<math>P_R= V_2\\times I = V\\frac{R}{R+R_C}\\times\\frac{V}{R+R_C} = \\frac{R}{R+R_C}\\times\\frac{V^2}{R+R_C} = \\frac{R}{R+R_C} P_V</math>\nAssume now that a transformer converts high-voltage, low-current electricity transported by the wires into low-voltage, high-current electricity for use at the consumption point. If we suppose it is an [[ideal transformer]] with a voltage ratio of <math>a</math> (i.e., the voltage is divided by <math>a</math> and the current is multiplied by <math>a</math> in the secondary branch, compared to the primary branch), then the circuit is again equivalent to a voltage divider, but the transmission wires now have apparent resistance of only <math>R_C/a^2</math>. The useful power is then:\n:<math>P_R= V_2\\times I_2 = \\frac{a^2R\\times V^2}{(a^2 R+R_C)^2} = \\frac{a^2 R}{a^2 R+R_C} P_V = \\frac{R}{R+R_C/a^2} P_V</math>\n\nFor <math>a>1</math> (i.e. conversion of high voltage to low voltage near the consumption point), a larger fraction of the generator's power is transmitted to the consumption point and a lesser fraction is lost to [[Joule heating]].\n\n== Modeling and the transmission matrix ==\n{{Main|Performance and Modelling of AC Transmission}}\n\n[[File:Transmission Line Black Box.JPG|thumb|upright=1.6|\"Black box\" model for transmission line]]Oftentimes, we are only interested in the terminal characteristics of the transmission line, which are the voltage and current at the sending and receiving ends. The transmission line itself is then modeled as a \"black box\" and a 2&nbsp;by&nbsp;2 transmission matrix is used to model its behavior, as follows:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\tV_\\mathrm{S}\\\\\n\tI_\\mathrm{S}\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\tA & B\\\\\n\tC & D\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\tV_\\mathrm{R}\\\\\n\tI_\\mathrm{R}\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe line is assumed to be a reciprocal, symmetrical network, meaning that the receiving and sending labels can be switched with no consequence. The transmission matrix '''T''' also has the following properties:\n* <math>\\det(T) = AD - BC = 1</math>\n* <math>A = D</math>\n\nThe parameters ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' differ depending on how the desired model handles the line's [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] (''R''), [[inductance]] (''L''), [[capacitance]] (''C''), and shunt (parallel, leak) [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] ''G''. The four main models are the short line approximation, the medium line approximation, the long line approximation (with distributed parameters), and the lossless line. In all models described, a capital letter such as ''R'' refers to the total quantity summed over the line and a lowercase letter such as ''c'' refers to the per-unit-length quantity.\n\n===Lossless line===\nThe '''lossless line''' approximation is the least accurate model; it is often used on short lines when the inductance of the line is much greater than its resistance. For this approximation, the voltage and current are identical at the sending and receiving ends.\n[[File:Losslessline.jpg|thumb|Voltage on sending and receiving ends for lossless line]]\nThe characteristic impedance  is pure real, which means resistive for that impedance, and it is often called '''surge impedance''' for a lossless line. When lossless line is terminated by surge impedance, there is no voltage drop. Though the phase angles of voltage and current are rotated, the magnitudes of voltage and current remain constant along the length of the line. For load&nbsp;>&nbsp;SIL, the voltage will drop from sending end and the line will \u201cconsume\u201d VARs. For load&nbsp;<&nbsp;SIL, the voltage will increase from sending end, and the line will \u201cgenerate\u201d VARs.\n\n===Short line===\nThe '''short line''' approximation is normally used for lines less than 50&nbsp;miles long. For a short line, only a series impedance ''Z'' is considered, while ''C'' and ''G'' are ignored. The final result is that '''A&nbsp;=&nbsp;D&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 per unit''', '''B&nbsp;=&nbsp;Z&nbsp;Ohms''', and '''C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0'''. The associated transition matrix for this approximation is therefore:\n:<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\tV_\\mathrm{S}\\\\\n\tI_\\mathrm{S}\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\t1 & Z\\\\\n\t0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\tV_\\mathrm{R}\\\\\n\tI_\\mathrm{R}\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\n===Medium line===\nThe '''medium line''' approximation is used for lines between 50 and 150&nbsp;miles long. In this model, the series impedance and the shunt (current leak) conductance are considered, with half of the shunt conductance being placed at each end of the line. This circuit is often referred to as a \u201cnominal [[\u03c0|''\u03c0'' (pi)]]\u201d circuit because of the shape (''\u03c0'') that is taken on when leak conductance is placed on both sides of the circuit diagram. The analysis of the medium line brings one to the following result:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nA &= D = 1 + \\frac{G Z}{2} \\text{ per unit}\\\\\nB &= Z\\Omega\\\\\nC &= G \\Big( 1 + \\frac{G Z}{4}\\Big)S\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nCounterintuitive behaviors of medium-length transmission lines:\n\n* voltage rise at no load or small current ([[Ferranti effect]])\n* receiving-end current can exceed sending-end current\n\n===Long line===\nThe '''long line''' model is used when a higher degree of accuracy is needed or when the line under consideration is more than 150&nbsp;miles long. Series resistance and shunt conductance are considered as distributed parameters, meaning each differential length of the line has a corresponding differential resistance and shunt admittance. The following result can be applied at any point along the transmission line, where <math>\\gamma</math> is the [[propagation constant]].\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nA &= D = \\cosh(\\gamma x) \\text{ per unit}\\\\[3mm]\nB &= Z_c \\sinh(\\gamma x) \\Omega\\\\[2mm]\nC &= \\frac{1}{Z_c} \\sinh(\\gamma x) S\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTo find the voltage and current at the end of the long line, <math>x</math> should be replaced with <math>l</math> (the line length) in all parameters of the transmission matrix.\n\n(For the full development of this model, see the [[Telegrapher's equations]].)\n\n== High-voltage direct current ==\n{{Main|High-voltage direct current}}\n\nHigh-voltage direct current (HVDC) is used to transmit large amounts of power over long distances or for interconnections between asynchronous grids. When electrical energy is to be transmitted over very long distances, the power lost in AC transmission becomes appreciable and it is less expensive to use [[direct current]] instead of [[alternating current]]. For a very long transmission line, these lower losses (and reduced construction cost of a DC line) can offset the additional cost of the required converter stations at each end.\n\n[[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] is also used for long [[Submarine power cable|submarine cables]] where AC cannot be used because of the cable capacitance.<ref>Donald G. Fink, H. Wayne Beatty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers 11th Edition'', McGraw Hill, 1978, {{ISBN|0-07-020974-X}},  pages 15-57 and 15-58</ref> In these cases special [[high-voltage cable]]s for DC are used. Submarine HVDC systems are often used to connect the electricity grids of islands, for example, between [[Great Britain]] and [[continental Europe]], between Great Britain and [[Ireland]], between [[Tasmania]] and the [[Australia]]n mainland, between the North and South Islands of [[New Zealand]], between [[New Jersey]] and [[New York City]], and between New Jersey and [[Long Island]]. Submarine connections up to {{convert|600|km}} in length are presently in use.<ref name=\"guarnieri 7-3\">{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2013|title=The Alternating Evolution of DC Power Transmission|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=7|issue=3|pages=60\u201363|doi=10.1109/MIE.2013.2272238|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nHVDC links can be used to control problems in the grid with AC electricity flow. The power transmitted by an AC line increases as the [[Electric power#Alternating current|phase angle]] between source end voltage and destination ends increases, but too large a phase angle will allow the systems at either end of the line to fall out of step. Since the power flow in a DC link is controlled independently of the phases of the AC networks at either end of the link, this phase angle limit does not exist, and a DC link is always able to transfer its full rated power. A DC link therefore stabilizes the AC grid at either end, since power flow and phase angle can then be controlled independently.\n\nAs an example, to adjust the flow of AC power on a hypothetical line between [[Seattle]] and [[Boston]] would require adjustment of the relative phase of the two regional electrical grids. This is an everyday occurrence in AC systems, but one that can become disrupted when AC system components fail and place unexpected loads on the remaining working grid system. With an HVDC line instead, such an interconnection would:\n# Convert AC in Seattle into HVDC;\n# Use HVDC for the {{convert|3000|mi|km}} of cross-country transmission; and \n# Convert the HVDC to locally synchronized AC in Boston,\n(and possibly in other cooperating cities along the transmission route). Such a system could be less prone to failure if parts of it were suddenly shut down. One example of a long DC transmission line is the [[Pacific DC Intertie]] located in the Western [[United States]].\n\n== Capacity ==\n<!-- Linked from wind power. -->\nThe amount of power that can be sent over a transmission line is limited. The origins of the limits vary depending on the length of the line. For a short line, the heating of conductors due to line losses sets a thermal limit. If too much current is drawn, conductors may sag too close to the ground, or conductors and equipment may be damaged by overheating. For intermediate-length lines on the order of {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=off}}, the limit is set by the [[voltage drop]] in the line. For longer AC lines, [[Power system stability|system stability]] sets the limit to the power that can be transferred. Approximately, the power flowing over an AC line is proportional to the cosine of the phase angle of the voltage and current at the receiving and transmitting ends. This angle varies depending on system loading and generation. It is undesirable for the angle to approach 90 degrees, as the power flowing decreases but the resistive losses remain. Very approximately, the allowable product of line length and maximum load is proportional to the square of the system voltage. Series capacitors or phase-shifting transformers are used on long lines to improve stability. [[Electric power transmission#High-voltage direct current|High-voltage direct current]] lines are restricted only by thermal and voltage drop limits, since the phase angle is not material to their operation.\n\nUp to now, it has been almost impossible to foresee the temperature distribution along the cable route, so that the maximum applicable current load was usually set as a compromise between understanding of operation conditions and risk minimization. The availability of industrial [[distributed temperature sensing]] (DTS) systems that measure in real time temperatures all along the cable is a first step in monitoring the transmission system capacity. This monitoring solution is based on using passive optical fibers as temperature sensors, either integrated directly inside a high voltage cable or mounted externally on the cable insulation. A solution for overhead lines is also available. In this case the optical fiber is integrated into the core of a phase wire of overhead transmission lines (OPPC). The integrated Dynamic Cable Rating (DCR) or also called Real Time Thermal Rating (RTTR) solution enables not only to continuously monitor the temperature of a high voltage cable circuit in real time, but to safely utilize the existing network capacity to its maximum. Furthermore, it provides the ability to the operator to predict the behavior of the transmission system upon major changes made to its initial operating conditions.\n\n== Control ==\nTo ensure safe and predictable operation, the components of the transmission system are controlled with generators, switches, circuit breakers and loads. The voltage, power, frequency, load factor, and reliability capabilities of the transmission system are designed to provide cost effective performance for the customers.\n\n=== Load balancing ===\nThe transmission system provides for base load and [[peaking power plant|peak load capability]], with safety and fault tolerance margins. The peak load times vary by region largely due to the industry mix. In very hot and very cold climates home air conditioning and heating loads have an effect on the overall load. They are typically highest in the late afternoon in the hottest part of the year and in mid-mornings and mid-evenings in the coldest part of the year. This makes the power requirements vary by the season and the time of day. Distribution system designs always take the base load and the peak load into consideration.\n\nThe transmission system usually does not have a large buffering capability to match the loads with the generation. Thus generation has to be kept matched to the load, to prevent overloading failures of the generation equipment.\n\nMultiple sources and loads can be connected to the transmission system and they must be controlled to provide orderly transfer of power. In centralized power generation, only local control of generation is necessary, and it involves [[alternator synchronization|synchronization of the generation units]], to prevent large transients and overload conditions.\n\nIn [[distributed generation|distributed power generation]] the generators are geographically distributed and the process to bring them online and offline must be carefully controlled. The load control signals can either be sent on separate lines or on the power lines themselves. Voltage and frequency can be used as signalling mechanisms to balance the loads.\n\nIn voltage signaling, the variation of voltage is used to increase generation. The power added by any system increases as the line voltage decreases. This arrangement is stable in principle. Voltage-based regulation is complex to use in mesh networks, since the individual components and setpoints would need to be reconfigured every time a new generator is added to the mesh.\n\nIn frequency signaling, the generating units match the frequency of the power transmission system. In [[droop speed control]], if the frequency decreases, the power is increased. (The drop in line frequency is an indication that the increased load is causing the generators to slow down.)\n\n[[Wind turbine]]s, [[vehicle-to-grid]] and other locally distributed storage and generation systems can be connected to the power grid, and interact with it to improve system operation. Internationally, the trend has been a slow move from a heavily centralized power system to a decentralized power system. The main draw of locally distributed generation systems which involve a number of new and innovative solutions is that they reduce transmission losses by leading to consumption of electricity closer to where it was produced.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url = https://www.en-powered.com/blog/the-bumpy-road-to-energy-deregulation | title = The Bumpy Road to Energy Deregulation\n  | publisher = EnPowered  | date = 2016-03-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Failure protection ===\nUnder excess load conditions, the system can be designed to fail gracefully rather than all at once. [[Brownout (electricity)|Brownouts]] occur when the supply power drops below the demand. [[Power outage|Blackouts]] occur when the supply fails completely.\n\n[[Rolling blackout]]s (also called load shedding) are intentionally engineered electrical power outages, used to distribute insufficient power when the demand for electricity exceeds the supply.\n\n== Communications ==\nOperators of long transmission lines require reliable communications for [[SCADA|control]] of the power grid and, often, associated generation and distribution facilities. Fault-sensing [[protective relay]]s at each end of the line must communicate to monitor the flow of power into and out of the protected line section so that faulted conductors or equipment can be quickly de-energized and the balance of the system restored. Protection of the transmission line from [[short circuit]]s and other faults is usually so critical that [[common carrier]] telecommunications are insufficiently reliable, and in remote areas a common carrier may not be available. Communication systems associated with a transmission project may use:\n* [[Microwave]]s\n* [[Power-line communication]]\n* [[Optical fiber]]s\nRarely, and for short distances, a utility will use pilot-wires strung along the transmission line path. Leased circuits from common carriers are not preferred since availability is not under control of the electric power transmission organization.\n\nTransmission lines can also be used to carry data: this is called power-line carrier, or [[power line communication|PLC]]. PLC signals can be easily received with a radio for the long wave range.\n\nOptical fibers can be included in the stranded conductors of a transmission line, in the overhead shield wires. These cables are known as [[optical ground wire]] (''OPGW''). Sometimes a standalone cable is used, all-dielectric self-supporting (''ADSS'') cable, attached to the transmission line cross arms.\n\nSome jurisdictions, such as [[Minnesota]], prohibit energy transmission companies from selling surplus communication bandwidth or acting as a telecommunications [[common carrier]]. Where the regulatory structure permits, the utility can sell capacity in extra [[dark fiber]]s to a common carrier, providing another revenue stream.\n\n== Electricity market reform ==\n{{Main|Electricity market}}\n\nSome regulators regard electric transmission to be a [[natural monopoly]]<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/iw/2004/08/15/stories/2004081501201300.htm\n | title = Power transmission business is a natural monopoly\n | author = Raghuvir Srinivasan\n | publisher = The Hindu\n | work = The Hindu Business Line\n | date = August 15, 2004\n | accessdate = January 31, 2008\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.reason.org/commentaries/kiesling_20030818b.shtml\n | title = Rethink the Natural Monopoly Justification of Electricity Regulation\n | author = Lynne Kiesling\n | publisher = Reason Foundation\n | date = 18 August 2003\n | accessdate = 31 January 2008\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080213034400/http://www.reason.org/commentaries/kiesling_20030818b.shtml\n | archive-date = February 13, 2008\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref> and there are moves in many countries to separately regulate transmission (see [[electricity market]]).\n\n[[Spain]] was the first country to establish a [[regional transmission organization]].

The study's case number is too old to be listed as a case number in the commission's online database, DMM, and so the original study can be difficult to find. The study chose to utilize the electric field strength that was measured at the edge of an existing (but newly built) right-of-way on a 765 kV transmission line from New York to Canada, 1.6 kV/m, as the interim standard maximum electric field at the edge of any new transmission line right-of-way built in New York State after issuance of the order. The opinion also limited the voltage of all new transmission lines built in New York to 345 kV. On September 11, 1990, after a similar study of magnetic field strengths, the NYSPSC issued their ''Interim Policy Statement on Magnetic Fields''. This study established a magnetic field interim standard of 200 mG at the edge of the right-of-way using the winter-normal conductor rating.

As a comparison with everyday items, a hair dryer or electric blanket produces a 100 mG - 500 mG magnetic field. An electric razor can produce 2.6 kV/m. Whereas electric fields can be shielded, magnetic fields cannot be shielded, but are usually minimized by optimizing the location of each phase of a circuit in cross-section.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/Common/ViewDoc.aspx?DocRefId=%7BED95C2A2-2DEA-4FFC-A8DA-CD9C39F5D361%7D|title=EMF Report for the CHPE|pp=1\u20134|publisher=TRC|date=March 2010|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.transpower.co.nz/sites/default/files/publications/resources/EMF-fact-sheet-3-2009.pdf|title=Electric and Magnetic Field Strengths|publisher=Transpower New Zealand Ltd|p=2|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen a new transmission line is proposed, within the application to the applicable regulatory body (usually a public utility commission), there is often an analysis of electric and magnetic field levels at the edge of rights-of-way. These analyses are performed by a utility or by an electrical engineering consultant using modelling software. At least one state public utility commission has access to software developed by an engineer or engineers at the [[Bonneville Power Administration]] to analyze electric and magnetic fields at edge of rights-of-way for proposed transmission lines. Often, public utility commissions will not comment on any health impacts due to electric and magnetic fields and will refer information seekers to the state's affiliated department of health.\n\nThere are established biological effects for [[Acute toxicity|acute]] ''high'' level exposure to magnetic fields well above 100&nbsp;[[Tesla (unit)|\u00b5T]] (1&nbsp;[[Gauss (unit)|G]]) (1,000 mG).

It was originally established by Congress in 1920 as the Federal Power Commission and has since undergone multiple name and responsibility modifications. That which is not regulated by FERC, primarily electric power distribution and the retail sale of power, is under the jurisdiction of state authority.\n\nTwo of the more notable U.S. energy policies impacting electricity transmission are [[Order No. 888]] and the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]].\n\nOrder No.&nbsp;888 adopted by FERC on 24&nbsp;April 1996, was \u201cdesigned to remove impediments to competition in the wholesale bulk power marketplace and to bring more efficient, lower cost power to the Nation\u2019s electricity consumers. The legal and policy cornerstone of these rules is to remedy undue discrimination in access to the monopoly owned transmission wires that control whether and to whom electricity can be transported in interstate commerce.\u201d<ref name=\"Docket No. RM95-8-000\">{{cite web|title=Order No. 888|url=https://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/land-docs/rm95-8-00w.txt|publisher=United States of America Federal Energy Regulatory Commission}}</ref> Order No.&nbsp;888 required all public utilities that own, control, or operate facilities used for transmitting electric energy in interstate commerce, to have open access non-discriminatory transmission tariffs. These tariffs allow any electricity generator to utilize the already existing power lines for the transmission of the power that they generate. Order No.&nbsp;888 also permits public utilities to recover the costs associated with providing their power lines as an open access service.<ref name=\"Docket No. RM95-8-000\"/><ref name=\"Order No. 888\">{{cite web|last1=Order No. 888|title=Promoting Wholesale Competition Through Open Access Non-discriminatory Transmission Services by Public Utilities; Recovery of Stranded Costs by Public Utilities and Transmitting Utilities |first1=FERC|url=https://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/land-docs/order888.asp}}</ref>\n\nThe Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct) signed into law by congress on 8&nbsp;August 2005, further expanded the federal authority of regulating power transmission. EPAct gave FERC significant new responsibilities including but not limited to the enforcement of electric transmission reliability standards and the establishment of rate incentives to encourage investment in electric transmission.<ref>{{cite book|title=Energy Policy Act of 2005 Fact Sheet|date=8 August 2006|publisher=FERC Washington, D.C.|url=https://www.ferc.gov/legal/fed-sta/epact-fact-sheet.pdf}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, local governments have exercised authority over the grid and have significant disincentives to encourage actions that would benefit states other than their own. Localities with cheap electricity have a disincentive to encourage making [[interstate commerce]] in electricity trading easier, since other regions will be able to compete for local energy and drive up rates. For example, some regulators in Maine do not wish to address congestion problems because the congestion serves to keep Maine rates low.<ref name=ncep2>{{cite journal|url=http://www.oe.energy.gov/DocumentsandMedia/primer.pdf|title=Electricity Transmission: A primer|author=National Council on Electricity Policy|page=32 (page&nbsp;41 in .pdf)|format=PDF|journal=|access-date=December 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201222708/http://www.oe.energy.gov/DocumentsandMedia/primer.pdf|archive-date=December 1, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Further, vocal local constituencies can block or slow permitting by pointing to visual impact, environmental, and perceived health concerns. In the US, generation is growing four times faster than transmission, but big transmission upgrades require the coordination of multiple states, a multitude of interlocking permits, and cooperation between a significant portion of the 500 companies that own the grid. From a policy perspective, the control of the grid is [[balkanized]], and even former [[United States Secretary of Energy|energy secretary]] [[Bill Richardson]] refers to it as a ''third world grid''. There have been efforts in the EU and US to confront the problem. The US national security interest in significantly growing transmission capacity drove passage of the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005|2005 energy act]] giving the Department of Energy the authority to approve transmission if states refuse to act. However, soon after the Department of Energy used its power to designate two [[National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor]]s, 14&nbsp;senators signed a letter stating the DOE was being too aggressive.<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Wald  | first = Matthew  | title = Wind Energy Bumps into Power Grid\u2019s Limits  | date=27 August 2008  | page=A1  | accessdate=12 December 2008  | work=[[The New York Times]]  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/business/27grid.html?_r=2&ref=business&oref=slogin}}</ref>\n\n== Special transmission ==\n\n=== Grids for railways ===\n{{Main|Traction power network}}\n\nIn some countries where [[electric locomotive]]s or [[electric multiple unit]]s run on low frequency AC power, there are separate single phase [[traction power network]]s operated by the railways.

It is principally used for rural electrification, but also finds use for larger isolated loads such as water pumps. Single wire earth return is also used for HVDC over submarine power cables.\n\n=== Wireless power transmission ===\n{{Main|Wireless energy transfer}}\n\nBoth [[Nikola Tesla]] and [[Hidetsugu Yagi]] attempted to devise systems for large scale wireless power transmission in the late 1800s and early 1900s, with no commercial success.\n\nIn November 2009, LaserMotive won the NASA 2009 Power Beaming Challenge by powering a cable climber 1&nbsp;km vertically using a ground-based laser transmitter. The system produced up to 1&nbsp;kW of power at the receiver end. In August 2010, NASA contracted with private companies to pursue the design of laser power beaming systems to power low earth orbit satellites and to launch rockets using laser power beams.\n\nWireless power transmission has been studied for transmission of power from [[solar power satellite]]s to the earth. A high power array of [[microwave]] or laser transmitters would beam power to a [[rectenna]]. Major engineering and economic challenges face any solar power satellite project.\n\n== Security of control systems ==\n{{Globalize|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe [[Federal government of the United States]] admits that the power grid is susceptible to [[cyber-warfare]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7990997.stm|title=Spies 'infiltrate US power grid'|date=April 9, 2009|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/04/08/grid.threat/index.html?iref=newssearch#cnnSTCVideo|title=Hackers reportedly have embedded code in power grid - CNN.com|website=www.cnn.com}}</ref> The [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] works with industry to identify vulnerabilities and to help industry enhance the security of control system networks, the federal government is also working to ensure that security is built in as the U.S. develops the next generation of 'smart grid' networks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://in.reuters.com/article/cyberattack-usa-idINN0853911920090408|title=UPDATE 2-US concerned power grid vulnerable to cyber-attack|date=April 8, 2009|via=in.reuters.com}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2019, [[Russia]] has conceded that it is \"possible\" its [[Electricity sector in Russia|electrical grid]] is under cyber-attack by the United States.<ref>{{cite news |title=US and Russia clash over power grid 'hack attacks |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48675203 |work=BBC News |date=18 June 2019}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' reported that American hackers from the [[United States Cyber Command]] planted malware potentially capable of disrupting the Russian electrical grid.<ref>{{cite news |title=How Not To Prevent a Cyberwar With Russia |url=https://www.wired.com/story/russia-cyberwar-escalation-power-grid/ |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=18 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Records ==\n* Highest capacity system: 12 GW Zhundong\u2013Wannan\uff08\u51c6\u4e1c-\u7696\u5357\uff09\u00b11100&nbsp;kV HVDC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.e-fermat.org/files/communication/Li-COMM-ASIAEM2015-2017-Vol21-May-Jun.-017.pdf|title=Development of UHV Transmission and Insulation Technology in China|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xj.xinhuanet.com/2019-09/27/c_1125048315.htm|title=\u51c6\u4e1c-\u7696\u5357\u00b11100\u5343\u4f0f\u7279\u9ad8\u538b\u76f4\u6d41\u8f93\u7535\u5de5\u7a0b\u7ae3\u5de5\u6295\u8fd0|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n* Highest transmission voltage (AC):\n**planned: 1.20&nbsp;MV (Ultra High Voltage) on Wardha-Aurangabad line ([[India]]) - under construction.

Vaudeville states that the philosophy of Kabir and other [[Sant (religion)|sants]] of the Bhakti movement is the seeking of the Absolute. The notion of this Absolute is ''nirguna'' which, writes Vaudeville, is same as \"the [[Upanishad]]ic concept of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Brahman-Atman]] and the monistic [[Advaita]] interpretation of the Vedantic tradition, which denies any distinction between the soul [within a human being] and God, and urges man to recognize within himself his true divine nature\".{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=26}} Vaudeville notes that this philosophy of Kabir and other Bhakti sants is self-contradictory, because if God is within, then that would be a call to abolish all external [[bhakti]]. This inconsistency in Kabir's teaching may have been differentiating \"union with God\" from the concept of \"merging into God, or Oneness in all beings\". Alternatively, states Vaudeville, the ''saguna'' prema-bhakti (tender devotion) may have been prepositioned as the journey towards self-realization of the ''nirguna'' Brahman, a universality beyond monotheism.{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=27-33|ps= with footnotes}}\n\n[[David Lorenzen|David N.

Vaudeville states that the philosophy of Kabir and other [[Sant (religion)|sants]] of the Bhakti movement is the seeking of the Absolute. The notion of this Absolute is ''nirguna'' which, writes Vaudeville, is same as \"the [[Upanishad]]ic concept of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Brahman-Atman]] and the monistic [[Advaita]] interpretation of the Vedantic tradition, which denies any distinction between the soul [within a human being] and God, and urges man to recognize within himself his true divine nature\".{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=26}} Vaudeville notes that this philosophy of Kabir and other Bhakti sants is self-contradictory, because if God is within, then that would be a call to abolish all external [[bhakti]]. This inconsistency in Kabir's teaching may have been differentiating \"union with God\" from the concept of \"merging into God, or Oneness in all beings\". Alternatively, states Vaudeville, the ''saguna'' prema-bhakti (tender devotion) may have been prepositioned as the journey towards self-realization of the ''nirguna'' Brahman, a universality beyond monotheism.{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=27-33|ps= with footnotes}}\n\n[[David Lorenzen|David N. Lorenzen]] and Adri\u00e1n Mu\u00f1oz trace these ideas of God in Kabir's philosophy as ''nirguna Brahman'' to those in [[Adi Shankara]]'s theories on [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism, albeit with some differences.{{sfn | Lorenzen | Mu\u00f1oz | 2012 | p=48}}\n\n===Influence of Islam===\nLorenzen in his review of Kabir's philosophy and poetry writes, \"the extent to which Kabir borrowed elements from Islam is controversial. Many recent scholars have argued that he simply rejected Islam and took almost all his ideas and beliefs from the Hindu tradition. Contemporary Kabir Panth sadhus make roughly the same argument. Most of the vocabulary used in his songs and verses are borrowed directly from the Hindu tradition. Nonetheless, it is hard not to see the influence of Islam in his insistence on devotion to a single God, a god Kabir most often calls Ram\".{{sfn | Lorenzen | Mu\u00f1oz | 2012 | p=48}}\n\nSome scholars state that the sexual imagery in some of Kabir's poems reflect a mystic Sufi Islam influence, wherein Kabir inverts the traditional Sufi representation of a God-woman and devotee-man longing for a union, and instead uses the imagery of Lord-husband and devotee-bride.{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=177\u2013178|ps= with footnote 26}} Other scholars, in contrast, state that it is unclear if Sufi ideas influenced Bhakti sants like Kabir or it was vice versa, suggesting that they probably co-developed through mutual interaction.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wIOSb97ph3EC&pg=PA116|title=India's Agony Over Religion|last=Larson|first=Gerald James|date=1995|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=0791424111|pages=116|oclc=30544951}}</ref>\n\nKabir left Islam, states Ronald McGregor, but that does not mean Kabir adopted Hindu beliefs.<ref name=ronaldsikh/> Kabir, nevertheless, criticized practices such as killing and eating a cow by Muslims, in a manner Hindus criticized those practices:\n\n{{Quote\n|<poem>\nWe have searched the ''turaki Dharam'' ([[Delhi Sultanate|Turk's religion]], Islam), these teachers throw many thunderbolts,\nRecklessly they display boundless pride while explaining their own aims, they kill cows.\nHow can they kill the mother, whose milk they drink like that of a wet nurse?\nThe young and the old drink milk pudding, but these fools eat the cow's body.\nThese morons know nothing, they wander about in ignorance,\nWithout looking into one's heart, how can one reach paradise?\n</poem>\n|Kabir, Ramaini 1|Translated by [[David Lorenzen]]{{sfn | Lorenzen | Mu\u00f1oz | 2012 | p=27}} }}\n\n===Persecution and social impact===\nKabir's couplets suggest he was persecuted for his views, while he was alive.

The ideological messages in the legends appealed to the poor and oppressed. According to David Lorenzen, legends about Kabir reflect a \"protest against social discrimination and economic exploitation\", they present the perspective of the poor and powerless, not the rich and powerful.{{sfn|Lorenzen|1991|pp=5-6}} However, many scholars doubt that these legends of persecution are authentic, point to the lack of any corroborating evidence, consider it unlikely that a Muslim Sultan would take orders from Hindu Brahmins or Kabir's own mother demanded that the Sultan punish Kabir, and question the historicity of the legends on Kabir.{{sfn|Lorenzen|1991|pp=16-35}}\n\n==Legacy==\nKabir literature legacy was championed by two of his disciples, Bh\u0101god\u0101s and Dharmad\u0101s.

Popular renderings include Halke Gaadi Haanko, Chadariya Jhini and Chor Awega. Kabir Cafe claims that living their lives just as Kabir suggests has led to them experiencing some of these truths and it reflects in their performances.[https://m.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/our-band-s-first-member-is-kabir-neeraj-arya-s-kabir-cafe/story-MSBwRyh0z9kAPtk1bMvEOL.html]\n\nNoted classical singer, late [[Kumar Gandharva]], is widely recognized for his wonderful rendering of Kabir's poetry.\n\nDocumentary filmmaker [[Shabnam Virmani]], from the [[Kabir Project]], has produced a series of documentaries and books tracing Kabir's philosophy, music and poetry in present-day [[India]] and [[Pakistan]].

According to Twelver theologians, the attributes and names of God have no independent and hypostatic existence apart from the being and essence of God.

It would be even incorrect to say God knows by his knowledge which is in his essence but God knows by his knowledge which is his essence.

According to Twelver theologians, the attributes and names of God have no independent and hypostatic existence apart from the being and essence of God.

It would be even incorrect to say God knows by his knowledge which is in his essence but God knows by his knowledge which is his essence.

[[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]] employed a botanist to assist with collecting this information, and to complement the work on pollen counts already being measured in [[Cardiff]].

In 1955, Frankland experimented on himself by being bitten each day by the blood-sucking insect ''[[Rhodnius prolixus]]''. He was assisted in this work by the [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]], which was able to supply insects that Frankland could be sure he had never previously been exposed to. The bites eventually provoked a severe [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reaction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsaci.org/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=134068&A=SearchResult&SearchID=1670263&\n|accessdate=16 April 2015|title= Dr A W (Bill) Frankland|publisher=British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immuniology}}</ref>\n\nThis research contributed to an understanding of how long injections of allergens would need to be given to achieve desensitisation. Results varied by individual, but immunity to pollen was found on average after three years. Immunity to [[venom]]-based allergens took longer, and was found on average after five years.<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Collaboration with Alexander Fleming===\n\nDuring the 1950s, Frankland served as an assistant to [[Alexander Fleming]] in the development of penicillin. The two had a daily meeting, but due to Fleming's lack of interest in clinical medicine, Frankland said that he could not recall a patient ever being discussed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imperial.nhs.uk/about-us/blog/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-william-frankland-pollen-count-alexander-fleming-70-years-nhs |title=Grandfather of allergy, Dr William Frankland, aged 106, on popularising the pollen count, working with Alexander Fleming and spending 70 years in the NHS |publisher=[[Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust]] |date=5 July 2018 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> Frankland and Fleming were also concerned with [[antimicrobial resistance]] to penicillin, with Frankland crediting Fleming with saying that careless prescription would inadvertently lead to \"the death of man.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://healthwnews.com/health-news/discoverer-of-penicillin-foresaw-the-threat-of-antibiotic-resistance/ |title=Discoverer of penicillin foresaw the threat of antibiotic resistance |date=3 December 2018 |access-date=2 April 2020 |website=HealthWNews.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Frankland published \"[[Prophylaxis]] of summer [[Hay-fever]] and Asthma.\" The article reported the results of a trial involving 200 patients with previous histories of grass pollen sensitivity half treated with active vaccines, and half with inactive 'control' vaccines.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Frankland|first1=A.

In the former [[East Germany]] for instance, with very poor work and housing conditions, people were less allergic.\"<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Pollen count===\n\nFrankland was keen to provide patients he saw in [[London]] with information about pollens, such as the levels of pollen on any given day, and the times of the year when levels would tend to be at their highest. [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]] employed a botanist to assist with collecting this information, and to complement the work on pollen counts already being measured in [[Cardiff]]. Weekly London pollen counts were sent to members of the British Allergy Society from 1953 and shared publicly, via ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', from 1963.<ref name=Hekint>{{cite web| url= https://hekint.org/2019/05/20/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-bill-frankland-the-ardent-centenarian/| title= Grandfather of allergy: Dr. Bill Frankland, the ardent centenarian| last=Turner| first=John| publisher=Hektoen International| date=Spring 2019| accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Self-experimentation===\n\nFrankland was also a supporter of the idea of [[Desensitization (medicine)|desensitisation]], a technique that aims to reduce the level of immune response to [[allergens]] by repeated low doses of the substance to which the patient has an allergy. In 1955, Frankland experimented on himself by being bitten each day by the blood-sucking insect ''[[Rhodnius prolixus]]''. He was assisted in this work by the [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]], which was able to supply insects that Frankland could be sure he had never previously been exposed to. The bites eventually provoked a severe [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reaction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsaci.org/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=134068&A=SearchResult&SearchID=1670263&\n|accessdate=16 April 2015|title= Dr A W (Bill) Frankland|publisher=British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immuniology}}</ref>\n\nThis research contributed to an understanding of how long injections of allergens would need to be given to achieve desensitisation. Results varied by individual, but immunity to pollen was found on average after three years. Immunity to [[venom]]-based allergens took longer, and was found on average after five years.<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Collaboration with Alexander Fleming===\n\nDuring the 1950s, Frankland served as an assistant to [[Alexander Fleming]] in the development of penicillin.

His contemporaries during those years included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Shelley Berman]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Mort Sahl]], his personal favorite. Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: \"He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.\"<ref name=\"Nachman\">{{cite book |last1=Nachman |first1=Gerland |title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s |url=https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach |url-access=registration |date=2003 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-375-41030-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach/page/659 659]}}</ref>{{rp|525}}\n\nAfter Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: \"I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}}\n\nHis early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a gentle and conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although he was well rehearsed. He acted \"normal\", dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage \"personality\". And he did not improvise: \"I put very little premium on improvisation,\" he told [[Studs Terkel]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor that made them funnier: \"I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|533}}\n\nThe subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women's rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam. And although he was described as a \"classic nebbish\", he did not tell Jewish jokes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/stars-of-david-10-jewish-hollywood-icons/|title=Let There Be Laughter \u2013 Jewish Humor Around the World|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Comedy screenwriter [[Larry Gelbart]] compared Allen's style to [[Elaine May]]: \"He just styled himself completely after her,\" he said.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|546}} Like [[Nichols and May]], he often made fun of intellectuals.\n\nTelevision talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], who was among the minority who quickly appreciated Allen's unique style, recalls seeing the audience at the Blue Angel mostly ignore Allen's [[monologue]]: \"I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence, while initially unappreciated, that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, explains Nachman: \"The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised.

''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of [[Diane Keaton]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Anjelica Huston]].\n\nHe returned to lighter movies like ''[[Bullets over Broadway]]'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996).

According to Allen, the newspapers reported that she had been \"violated\".

They divorced in 1970. Lasser appeared in three of Allen's films: ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'', ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'', and ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]''. She also appeared briefly in ''[[Stardust Memories]]''.\n\nIn 1969, Allen cast [[Diane Keaton]] in his Broadway show ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]].'' During the run she and Allen became romantically involved. Although they broke up after a year, she continued to star in his films, including ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' as a futuristic poet and ''[[Love and Death]]'' as a composite character based on the novels of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]]. ''[[Annie Hall]]'' was very important in Allen's and Keaton's careers. It is said that the role was written for her, as Keaton's birth name was Diane Hall. She then starred in ''[[Interiors]]'' as a poet, followed by ''[[Manhattan]]''. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in ''[[Radio Days]]'', and she was chosen to replace [[Mia Farrow]] in ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' after Allen and Farrow began having problems with their relationship. In total Keaton has starred in eight of Allen's films.

His contemporaries during those years included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Shelley Berman]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Mort Sahl]], his personal favorite. Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: \"He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.\"<ref name=\"Nachman\">{{cite book |last1=Nachman |first1=Gerland |title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s |url=https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach |url-access=registration |date=2003 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-375-41030-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach/page/659 659]}}</ref>{{rp|525}}\n\nAfter Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: \"I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}}\n\nHis early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a gentle and conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although he was well rehearsed. He acted \"normal\", dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage \"personality\". And he did not improvise: \"I put very little premium on improvisation,\" he told [[Studs Terkel]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor that made them funnier: \"I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|533}}\n\nThe subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women's rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam. And although he was described as a \"classic nebbish\", he did not tell Jewish jokes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/stars-of-david-10-jewish-hollywood-icons/|title=Let There Be Laughter \u2013 Jewish Humor Around the World|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Comedy screenwriter [[Larry Gelbart]] compared Allen's style to [[Elaine May]]: \"He just styled himself completely after her,\" he said.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|546}} Like [[Nichols and May]], he often made fun of intellectuals.\n\nTelevision talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], who was among the minority who quickly appreciated Allen's unique style, recalls seeing the audience at the Blue Angel mostly ignore Allen's [[monologue]]: \"I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence, while initially unappreciated, that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, explains Nachman: \"The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised.

In 1967 Allen played Jimmy Bond in the 007 spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.\n\nIn 1969 Allen directed, starred in, and co-wrote (with Mickey Rose) ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'', which received positive reviews. He later signed a deal with [[United Artists]] to produce several films.

As in many Allen films, the main protagonists are upper-middle class writers and academics. ''Manhattan'' focuses on the complicated relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) and 17-year-old Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), and co-stars Diane Keaton.\n\nKeaton, who has made eight movies with Allen, has said, \"He just has a mind like nobody else.

''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of [[Diane Keaton]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Anjelica Huston]].\n\nHe returned to lighter movies like ''[[Bullets over Broadway]]'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996). The singing and dancing scenes in ''Everyone Says I Love You'' are similar to musicals starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. The comedy ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'' (1995), in which Greek drama plays a large role, won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Mira Sorvino]]. Allen's 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]'' was nominated for two Academy Awards, for [[Sean Penn]] (Best Actor) and [[Samantha Morton]] (Best Supporting Actress). In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen veered into darker satire toward the end of the decade with ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997) and ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]'' (1998).\n\nDuring this decade Allen also starred in the television film ''[[The Sunshine Boys (1996 film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'' (1995), based on the [[Neil Simon]] [[The Sunshine Boys|play of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Greg |title=Review: 'The Sunshine Boys' |url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/reviews/the-sunshine-boys-4-1200452126/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=April 3, 2016 |date=December 21, 1997}}</ref>\n\nAllen made one sitcom \"appearance\" via telephone on the show ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' in a 1997 episode, \"My Dinner with Woody\", that paid tribute to several of his films.

According to Allen, the newspapers reported that she had been \"violated\".

She also appeared briefly in ''[[Stardust Memories]]''.\n\nIn 1969, Allen cast [[Diane Keaton]] in his Broadway show ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]].'' During the run she and Allen became romantically involved. Although they broke up after a year, she continued to star in his films, including ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' as a futuristic poet and ''[[Love and Death]]'' as a composite character based on the novels of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]]. ''[[Annie Hall]]'' was very important in Allen's and Keaton's careers. It is said that the role was written for her, as Keaton's birth name was Diane Hall. She then starred in ''[[Interiors]]'' as a poet, followed by ''[[Manhattan]]''. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in ''[[Radio Days]]'', and she was chosen to replace [[Mia Farrow]] in ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' after Allen and Farrow began having problems with their relationship.

[[Cavalieri's principle]] in [[geometry]] partially anticipated [[integral calculus]]. \n== Life ==\nBorn in [[Milan]], Cavalieri joined the [[Jesuates]] order (not to be confused with the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]) at the age of fifteen, taking the name Bonaventura upon becoming a novice of the order, and remained a member until his death.<ref name=\"Eves\">{{cite journal|last=Eves|first=Howard|date=1998|title=Slicing it Thin|work=Mathematical Recreations: A Collection in Honour of Martin Gardner|editor=[[David A.

By 1616 he was a student of [[geometry]] at the [[University of Pisa]]. There he came under the tutelege of [[Benedetto Castelli]], who probably introduced him to [[Galileo Galilei]]. In 1617 he briefly joined the [[House of Medici|Medici]] court in [[Florence]], under the patronage of [[Federico Borromeo|Cardinal Federico Borromeo]], but the following year he returned to Pisa and began teaching Mathematics in place of Castelli. He applied for the Chair of Mathematics at the [[University of Bologna]], but was turned down.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1620, he returned to the Jesuate house in Milan, where he had lived as a noviate, and became a deacon under Cardinal Borromeo. He studied [[theology]] in the [[monastery]] of San Gerolamo in Milan, and was named prior of the monastery of St. Peter in [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]]. In 1623 he was made prior of St. Benedict's monastery in Parma, but was still applying for positions in mathematics. He applied again to Bologna and then, in 1626, to [[Sapienza University of Rome|Sapienza University]], but was declined each time, despite taking six months' leave of absence to support his case to Sapienza in Rome.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1626 he began to suffer from gout, which would restrict his movements for the rest of his life.<ref name=\":2\">J J O'Connor and E F Robertson, Bonaventura Francesco Cavalieri, ''MacTutor History of Mathematics'', (University of St Andrews, Scotland, July 2014) </ref> He was also turned down from a position at the [[University of Parma]], which be believed was due to his membership of the Jesuate order, as Parma was administrated by the Jesuit order at the time. In 1629 he was appointed Chair of Mathematics at the University of Bologna, which is attributed to Galileo's support of him to the Bolognese senate.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nHe published most of his work while at Bologna, though some of it had been written previously; his ''Geometria Indivisibilius'', where he outlined what would later become the [[Method of indivisibles|Method of Indivisibles]], was written in 1627 while in Parma and presented as part of his application to Bologna, but was not published until 1635. Contemporary critical reception was mixed, and ''Exercitationes geometricae sex'' (Six Exercises in Geometry) was published in 1947, partly as a response to criticism. Also at Bologna he published tables of logarithms and information on their use, promoting their use in Italy.\n\nGalileo exerted a strong influence on Cavalieri, and Cavalieri would write at least 112 letters to Galileo.  Galileo said of him, \"few, if any, since [[Archimedes]], have delved as far and as deep into the science of geometry.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> He corresponded widely; his known correspondents include [[Marin Mersenne]], [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and [[Vincenzo Viviani]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Torricelli in particular was instrumental in refining and promoting the method of indivisibles.<ref name=\":1\" /> He also benefited from the patronage of [[Cesare Marsili]].<ref name=\":3\">[http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/cavaleri.html Cavalieri, Bonaventura], at The Galileo Project</ref>\n\nTowards the end of his life, his health declined significantly. Arthritis prevented him from writing, and much of his correspondence was dictated and written by [[Stefano degli Angeli|Stephano degli Angeli]], a fellow Jesuat and student of Cavalieri. Angeli would go on to further develop Cavalieri's method. \n\nIn 1647 he died, probably of gout.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Work ==\nFrom 1632 to 1646, Cavalieri published eleven books dealing with problems in astronomy, optics, motion and geometry.\n\n==== Work in Optics ====\nCavalieri's first book, first published in 1632 and reprinted once in 1650, was ''Lo Specchio Ustorio, overo, Trattato delle settioni coniche'', or ''The [[Burning glass|Burning Mirror]], or a Treatise on Conic Sections''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ZX64AAAAIAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=%22lo+specchio+ustorio%22&ots=CzX83kjdXO&sig=bZmh3XzXN2mWZdIa32OGlyypwEk Lo Specchio Ustorio, overo, Trattato delle settioni coniche]</ref>  The aim of ''Lo Specchio Ustorio'' was to address the question of how [[Archimedes]] could have used mirrors to burn the Roman fleet as they approached [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], a question still in debate.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/experiments/deathray/10_ArchimedesResult.html|title=2.009 Product Engineering Processes: Archimedes|website=web.mit.edu|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> The book went beyond this purpose and also explored conic sections, reflections of light, and the properties of parabolas. In this book he developed the theory of mirrors shaped into [[parabola]]s, [[hyperbola]]s, and [[ellipse]]s, and various combinations of these mirrors. He demonstrated that if, as was later shown, light has a finite and determinate speed, there is minimal interference in the image at the focus of a parabolic, hyperbolic or elliptic mirror, though this was theoretical, since the mirrors required could not be constructed using contemporary technology. This would produce better images than the telescopes that existed at the time.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Stargazer, the Life and Times of the Telescope, by Fred Watson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2LZZginzib4C&pg=PA134&dq=gregory+cassegrain+mersenne p. 135]</ref>\n[[File:Cavalieri's Speccio Ustorio figures 7 and 8.jpg|thumb|Geometrical figures from ''Lo Speccio Ustorio'', used in proofs of properties of parabolic reflecting surfaces.]]\nHe also demonstrated some properties of curves. The first is that, for a light ray parallel to the axis of a parabola and reflected so as to pass through the focus, the sum of the incident angle and its reflection is equal to that of any other similar ray. He then demonstrated similar results for hyperbolas and ellipses. The second result, useful in the design of reflecting telescopes, is that if a line is extended from a point outside of a parabola to the focus, then the reflection of this line on the outside surface of the parabola is parallel to the axis. Other results include the property that if a line passes through a hyperbola and its external focus, then its reflection on the interior of the hyperbola will pass through the internal focus; the reverse of the previous, that a ray directed through the parabola to the internal focus is reflected from the outer surface to the external focus; and the property that if a line passes through one internal focus of an ellipse, its reflection on the internal surface of the ellipse will pass through the other internal focus. While some of these properties had been noted previously, Cavalieri gave the first proof of many.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Lo Specchio Ustorio'' also included a table of reflecting surfaces and modes of reflection for practical use.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCavalieri's work also contained theoretical designs for a new type of telescope using mirrors, a [[reflecting telescope]], initially developed to answer the question of Archimedes' Mirror and then applied on a much smaller scale as telescopes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ariotti|first=Piero E.|date=September 1975|title=Bonaventura Cavalieri, Marin Mersenne, and the Reflecting Telescope|journal=Isis|volume=66|issue=3|pages=303\u2013321|doi=10.1086/351471|issn=0021-1753}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eves|first=Howard|date=March 1991|title=Two Surprising Theorems on Cavalieri Congruence|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=22|issue=2|pages=118\u2013124|doi=10.2307/2686447|issn=0746-8342|jstor=2686447}}</ref> He illustrated three different concepts for incorporating reflective mirrors within his telescope model. Plan one consisted of a large, concave mirror directed towards the sun as to reflect light into a second, smaller, convex mirror. Cavalieri's second concept consisted of a main, truncated, paraboloid mirror and a second, convex mirror. His third option illustrated a strong resemblance to his previous concept, replacing the convex secondary lens with a concave lens.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Work in Geometry and the Method of Indivisibles ====\n[[File:Cavalieri - Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota, 1653 - 1250292.jpg|thumb|The frontispiece of the ''Geometria Indivisilibus.'']]\nInspired by earlier work by Galileo, Cavalieri developed a new geometrical approach called the [[method of indivisibles]] to calculus and published a treatise on the topic, ''Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota'', or ''Geometry, developed by a new method through the indivisibles of the continua''. This was written in 1627, but was not published until 1635. In this work, Cavalieri considers an entity referred to in the text as 'all the lines' or 'all the planes' of a figure, an indefinite number of parallel lines or planes within the bounds of a figure that are comparable to the area and volume, respectively, of the figure. Later mathematicians, improving on his method, would treat 'all the lines' and 'all the planes' as equivalent or equal to the area and volume, but Cavalieri, in an attempt to avoid the question of the composition of the continuum, insisted that the two were comparable but not equal.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThese parallel elements are called indivisibles respectively of area and volume and provide the building blocks of Cavalieri's method, and are also fundamental features of [[integral calculus]].  He also used the method of indivisibles to calculate the result which is now written <math>\\int_{0}^{1} x^2dx = 1/3</math>, in the process of calculating the area enclosed in an [[Archimedean spiral|Archimedean Spiral]], which he later generalised to other figures, showing, for instance, that the volume of a cylinder is one third of the volume of a circumscribed cylinder.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/mathematics|title=Mathematics - The calculus|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nAn immediate application of the method of indivisibles is [[Cavalieri's principle]], which states that the [[volume]]s of two objects are equal if the areas of their corresponding cross-sections are in all cases equal. Two cross-sections correspond if they are intersections of the body with planes equidistant from a chosen base plane. (The same principle had been previously used by [[Zu Gengzhi]] (480&ndash;525) of [[China]], in the specific case of calculating the volume of the sphere.<ref name=\"needham volume 3 143\">Needham, Joseph (1986). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3; Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth''. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd. Page 143.) and was first documented in his book 'Zhui Su'(\u300a[[:zh:\u7f00\u672f|\u7f00\u672f]]\u300b). This principle was also worked out by [[Shen Kuo]] in the 11th century.</ref>) \n\nThe method of indivisibles as set out by Cavalieri was powerful, but was limited in its usefulness in three respects. First, while Cavalieri's proofs were intuitive and later demonstrated to be correct, they were not rigorous; second, his writing was dense and opaque; third, the treatment of the continuum as being composed of [[Infinitesimal|infinitesimals]] was at the time condemned in Italy by the Jesuit order as a feature of [[atomism]], a forbidden doctrine. While many contemporary mathematicians furthered the method of indivisibles, often with little regard for the limitations that Cavalieri imposed on the use of infinitesimals in order to avoid controversy, the ''Geometria indivisibilius''' critical reception was severe. [[Andr\u00e9 Tacquet|Andre Taquet]] and [[Paul Guldin]] both published responses to the ''Geometria indivisibilus.'' Guldin's critique, which was particularly in-depth, suggested that Cavalieri's method was derived from the work of [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Bartholomew Sover]], attacked his method for a lack of rigorousness, and then argues that there can be no meaningful ratio between two infinities, and therefore it is meaningless to compare one to another.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nCavalieri's ''Exercitationes geometricae sex'', or ''Six Geometric Exercises (1647)'' was written in direct response to Guldin's criticism. It was initially drafted as a [[dialogue]] in the manner of Galileo, but correspondents advised against the format as being unnecessarily inflammatory. The charges of plagiarism were without substance, but much of the ''Exercitationes'' dealt with the mathematical substance of Guldin's arguments. He argued, disingenously, that his work regarded 'all the lines' as a separate entity from the area of a figure, and then argued that 'all the lines' and 'all the planes' dealt not with absolute but with relative infinity, and therefore could be compared. These arguments were not convincing to contemporaries.<ref name=\":1\" /> The ''Exercitationes'' nonetheless represented a significant improvement to the method of indivisibles.

[[Cavalieri's principle]] in [[geometry]] partially anticipated [[integral calculus]]. \n== Life ==\nBorn in [[Milan]], Cavalieri joined the [[Jesuates]] order (not to be confused with the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]) at the age of fifteen, taking the name Bonaventura upon becoming a novice of the order, and remained a member until his death.<ref name=\"Eves\">{{cite journal|last=Eves|first=Howard|date=1998|title=Slicing it Thin|work=Mathematical Recreations: A Collection in Honour of Martin Gardner|editor=[[David A. Klarner]]|page=100|publisher=Dover|ISBN=0-486-40089-1}}</ref> He took his vows as a full member of the order in 1615, at the age of seventeen, and shortly after joined the Jesuat house in Pisa. By 1616 he was a student of [[geometry]] at the [[University of Pisa]]. There he came under the tutelege of [[Benedetto Castelli]], who probably introduced him to [[Galileo Galilei]]. In 1617 he briefly joined the [[House of Medici|Medici]] court in [[Florence]], under the patronage of [[Federico Borromeo|Cardinal Federico Borromeo]], but the following year he returned to Pisa and began teaching Mathematics in place of Castelli. He applied for the Chair of Mathematics at the [[University of Bologna]], but was turned down.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1620, he returned to the Jesuate house in Milan, where he had lived as a noviate, and became a deacon under Cardinal Borromeo. He studied [[theology]] in the [[monastery]] of San Gerolamo in Milan, and was named prior of the monastery of St. Peter in [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]]. In 1623 he was made prior of St. Benedict's monastery in Parma, but was still applying for positions in mathematics. He applied again to Bologna and then, in 1626, to [[Sapienza University of Rome|Sapienza University]], but was declined each time, despite taking six months' leave of absence to support his case to Sapienza in Rome.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1626 he began to suffer from gout, which would restrict his movements for the rest of his life.<ref name=\":2\">J J O'Connor and E F Robertson, Bonaventura Francesco Cavalieri, ''MacTutor History of Mathematics'', (University of St Andrews, Scotland, July 2014) </ref> He was also turned down from a position at the [[University of Parma]], which be believed was due to his membership of the Jesuate order, as Parma was administrated by the Jesuit order at the time. In 1629 he was appointed Chair of Mathematics at the University of Bologna, which is attributed to Galileo's support of him to the Bolognese senate.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nHe published most of his work while at Bologna, though some of it had been written previously; his ''Geometria Indivisibilius'', where he outlined what would later become the [[Method of indivisibles|Method of Indivisibles]], was written in 1627 while in Parma and presented as part of his application to Bologna, but was not published until 1635. Contemporary critical reception was mixed, and ''Exercitationes geometricae sex'' (Six Exercises in Geometry) was published in 1947, partly as a response to criticism. Also at Bologna he published tables of logarithms and information on their use, promoting their use in Italy.\n\nGalileo exerted a strong influence on Cavalieri, and Cavalieri would write at least 112 letters to Galileo.  Galileo said of him, \"few, if any, since [[Archimedes]], have delved as far and as deep into the science of geometry.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> He corresponded widely; his known correspondents include [[Marin Mersenne]], [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and [[Vincenzo Viviani]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Torricelli in particular was instrumental in refining and promoting the method of indivisibles.<ref name=\":1\" /> He also benefited from the patronage of [[Cesare Marsili]].<ref name=\":3\">[http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/cavaleri.html Cavalieri, Bonaventura], at The Galileo Project</ref>\n\nTowards the end of his life, his health declined significantly. Arthritis prevented him from writing, and much of his correspondence was dictated and written by [[Stefano degli Angeli|Stephano degli Angeli]], a fellow Jesuat and student of Cavalieri. Angeli would go on to further develop Cavalieri's method. \n\nIn 1647 he died, probably of gout.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Work ==\nFrom 1632 to 1646, Cavalieri published eleven books dealing with problems in astronomy, optics, motion and geometry.\n\n==== Work in Optics ====\nCavalieri's first book, first published in 1632 and reprinted once in 1650, was ''Lo Specchio Ustorio, overo, Trattato delle settioni coniche'', or ''The [[Burning glass|Burning Mirror]], or a Treatise on Conic Sections''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ZX64AAAAIAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=%22lo+specchio+ustorio%22&ots=CzX83kjdXO&sig=bZmh3XzXN2mWZdIa32OGlyypwEk Lo Specchio Ustorio, overo, Trattato delle settioni coniche]</ref>  The aim of ''Lo Specchio Ustorio'' was to address the question of how [[Archimedes]] could have used mirrors to burn the Roman fleet as they approached [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], a question still in debate.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/experiments/deathray/10_ArchimedesResult.html|title=2.009 Product Engineering Processes: Archimedes|website=web.mit.edu|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> The book went beyond this purpose and also explored conic sections, reflections of light, and the properties of parabolas. In this book he developed the theory of mirrors shaped into [[parabola]]s, [[hyperbola]]s, and [[ellipse]]s, and various combinations of these mirrors. He demonstrated that if, as was later shown, light has a finite and determinate speed, there is minimal interference in the image at the focus of a parabolic, hyperbolic or elliptic mirror, though this was theoretical, since the mirrors required could not be constructed using contemporary technology. This would produce better images than the telescopes that existed at the time.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Stargazer, the Life and Times of the Telescope, by Fred Watson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2LZZginzib4C&pg=PA134&dq=gregory+cassegrain+mersenne p. 135]</ref>\n[[File:Cavalieri's Speccio Ustorio figures 7 and 8.jpg|thumb|Geometrical figures from ''Lo Speccio Ustorio'', used in proofs of properties of parabolic reflecting surfaces.]]\nHe also demonstrated some properties of curves. The first is that, for a light ray parallel to the axis of a parabola and reflected so as to pass through the focus, the sum of the incident angle and its reflection is equal to that of any other similar ray. He then demonstrated similar results for hyperbolas and ellipses. The second result, useful in the design of reflecting telescopes, is that if a line is extended from a point outside of a parabola to the focus, then the reflection of this line on the outside surface of the parabola is parallel to the axis. Other results include the property that if a line passes through a hyperbola and its external focus, then its reflection on the interior of the hyperbola will pass through the internal focus; the reverse of the previous, that a ray directed through the parabola to the internal focus is reflected from the outer surface to the external focus; and the property that if a line passes through one internal focus of an ellipse, its reflection on the internal surface of the ellipse will pass through the other internal focus. While some of these properties had been noted previously, Cavalieri gave the first proof of many.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Lo Specchio Ustorio'' also included a table of reflecting surfaces and modes of reflection for practical use.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCavalieri's work also contained theoretical designs for a new type of telescope using mirrors, a [[reflecting telescope]], initially developed to answer the question of Archimedes' Mirror and then applied on a much smaller scale as telescopes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ariotti|first=Piero E.|date=September 1975|title=Bonaventura Cavalieri, Marin Mersenne, and the Reflecting Telescope|journal=Isis|volume=66|issue=3|pages=303\u2013321|doi=10.1086/351471|issn=0021-1753}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eves|first=Howard|date=March 1991|title=Two Surprising Theorems on Cavalieri Congruence|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=22|issue=2|pages=118\u2013124|doi=10.2307/2686447|issn=0746-8342|jstor=2686447}}</ref> He illustrated three different concepts for incorporating reflective mirrors within his telescope model. Plan one consisted of a large, concave mirror directed towards the sun as to reflect light into a second, smaller, convex mirror. Cavalieri's second concept consisted of a main, truncated, paraboloid mirror and a second, convex mirror. His third option illustrated a strong resemblance to his previous concept, replacing the convex secondary lens with a concave lens.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Work in Geometry and the Method of Indivisibles ====\n[[File:Cavalieri - Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota, 1653 - 1250292.jpg|thumb|The frontispiece of the ''Geometria Indivisilibus.'']]\nInspired by earlier work by Galileo, Cavalieri developed a new geometrical approach called the [[method of indivisibles]] to calculus and published a treatise on the topic, ''Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota'', or ''Geometry, developed by a new method through the indivisibles of the continua''. This was written in 1627, but was not published until 1635. In this work, Cavalieri considers an entity referred to in the text as 'all the lines' or 'all the planes' of a figure, an indefinite number of parallel lines or planes within the bounds of a figure that are comparable to the area and volume, respectively, of the figure. Later mathematicians, improving on his method, would treat 'all the lines' and 'all the planes' as equivalent or equal to the area and volume, but Cavalieri, in an attempt to avoid the question of the composition of the continuum, insisted that the two were comparable but not equal.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThese parallel elements are called indivisibles respectively of area and volume and provide the building blocks of Cavalieri's method, and are also fundamental features of [[integral calculus]].  He also used the method of indivisibles to calculate the result which is now written <math>\\int_{0}^{1} x^2dx = 1/3</math>, in the process of calculating the area enclosed in an [[Archimedean spiral|Archimedean Spiral]], which he later generalised to other figures, showing, for instance, that the volume of a cylinder is one third of the volume of a circumscribed cylinder.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/mathematics|title=Mathematics - The calculus|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nAn immediate application of the method of indivisibles is [[Cavalieri's principle]], which states that the [[volume]]s of two objects are equal if the areas of their corresponding cross-sections are in all cases equal. Two cross-sections correspond if they are intersections of the body with planes equidistant from a chosen base plane. (The same principle had been previously used by [[Zu Gengzhi]] (480&ndash;525) of [[China]], in the specific case of calculating the volume of the sphere.<ref name=\"needham volume 3 143\">Needham, Joseph (1986). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3; Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth''. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd. Page 143.) and was first documented in his book 'Zhui Su'(\u300a[[:zh:\u7f00\u672f|\u7f00\u672f]]\u300b). This principle was also worked out by [[Shen Kuo]] in the 11th century.</ref>) \n\nThe method of indivisibles as set out by Cavalieri was powerful, but was limited in its usefulness in three respects. First, while Cavalieri's proofs were intuitive and later demonstrated to be correct, they were not rigorous; second, his writing was dense and opaque; third, the treatment of the continuum as being composed of [[Infinitesimal|infinitesimals]] was at the time condemned in Italy by the Jesuit order as a feature of [[atomism]], a forbidden doctrine. While many contemporary mathematicians furthered the method of indivisibles, often with little regard for the limitations that Cavalieri imposed on the use of infinitesimals in order to avoid controversy, the ''Geometria indivisibilius''' critical reception was severe. [[Andr\u00e9 Tacquet|Andre Taquet]] and [[Paul Guldin]] both published responses to the ''Geometria indivisibilus.'' Guldin's critique, which was particularly in-depth, suggested that Cavalieri's method was derived from the work of [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Bartholomew Sover]], attacked his method for a lack of rigorousness, and then argues that there can be no meaningful ratio between two infinities, and therefore it is meaningless to compare one to another.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nCavalieri's ''Exercitationes geometricae sex'', or ''Six Geometric Exercises (1647)'' was written in direct response to Guldin's criticism. It was initially drafted as a [[dialogue]] in the manner of Galileo, but correspondents advised against the format as being unnecessarily inflammatory. The charges of plagiarism were without substance, but much of the ''Exercitationes'' dealt with the mathematical substance of Guldin's arguments. He argued, disingenously, that his work regarded 'all the lines' as a separate entity from the area of a figure, and then argued that 'all the lines' and 'all the planes' dealt not with absolute but with relative infinity, and therefore could be compared. These arguments were not convincing to contemporaries.<ref name=\":1\" /> The ''Exercitationes'' nonetheless represented a significant improvement to the method of indivisibles. By applying transformations to his variables, he generalised his previous integral result, showing that<math>\\int_{0}^{1} x^n dx = 1/(n+1)</math> for n=3 to n=9, which is now known as [[Cavalieri's quadrature formula|Cavalieri's quadrature formula.]]<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> \n\n==== Work in Astronomy ====\nTowards the end of his life, Cavalieri published two books on [[astronomy]]. While they use the language of [[astronomy]], he states in the text that he did not believe in or practice astronomy. Those books were the ''Nuova pratica astromlogica (1639)'' and the ''Trattato della ruota planetaria perpetua'' ''(1646).''\n\n==== Other Work ====\nHe published tables of [[logarithm]]s, emphasizing their practical use in the fields of astronomy and [[geography]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nCavalieri also constructed a hydraulic pump for a monastery he was in management of.

(NASA copyright policy page or JPL Image Use Policy). -->\n\nAn '''ecoregion''' ('''ecological region''') is an [[ecology|ecologically]] and geographically defined area that is smaller than a [[bioregion]], which in turn is smaller than an [[ecozone]]. Ecoregions cover relatively large areas of land or water, and contain characteristic, geographically distinct assemblages of natural [[community (ecology)|communities]] and [[species]]. The [[biodiversity]] of [[flora (plants)|flora]], [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] and [[ecosystems]] that characterise an ecoregion tends to be distinct from that of other ecoregions. In theory, biodiversity or conservation ecoregions are relatively large areas of land or water where the probability of encountering different species and communities at any given point remains relatively constant, within an acceptable range of variation (largely undefined at this point).\n\nThree caveats are appropriate for all bio-geographic mapping approaches. Firstly, no single bio-geographic framework is optimal for all taxa. Ecoregions reflect the best compromise for as many taxa as possible. Secondly, ecoregion boundaries rarely form abrupt edges; rather, [[ecotone]]s and mosaic [[habitat]]s bound them. Thirdly, most ecoregions contain habitats that differ from their assigned [[biome]]. Biogeographic provinces may originate due to various barriers, including physical (plate tectonics, topographic highs), climatic (latitudinal variation, seasonal range) and ocean chemical related (salinity, oxygen levels).\n\n==History==\nThe history of the term is somewhat vague, and it had been used in many contexts: forest classifications (Loucks, 1962), [[biome]] classifications (Bailey, 1976, 2014), [[biogeography|biogeographic]] classifications ([[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]]/[[Global 200]] scheme of Olson & Dinerstein, 1998), etc.<ref>Loucks, O.

(2000). ''Bioregional planning: resource management beyond the new millennium.'' Harwood Academic Publishers: Sydney, Australia.</ref> Omernik (2004) elaborates on this by defining ecoregions as: \"areas within which there is spatial coincidence in characteristics of [[geographical]] phenomena associated with differences in the quality, health, and integrity of [[ecosystems]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Omernik |first=J. M. |year=2004 |title=Perspectives on the Nature and Definition of Ecological Regions |work=Environmental Management |page=34 \u2013 Supplement 1, pp.27\u201338 }}</ref> \"Characteristics of geographical phenomena\" may include [[geology]], [[physiography]], vegetation, climate, [[hydrology]], terrestrial and [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] [[fauna]], and soils, and may or may not include the impacts of human activity (e.g. land use patterns, vegetation changes). There is significant, but not absolute, spatial correlation among these characteristics, making the delineation of ecoregions an imperfect science. Another complication is that environmental conditions across an ecoregion boundary may change very gradually, e.g. the prairie-forest transition in the midwestern United States, making it difficult to identify an exact dividing boundary. Such transition zones are called [[ecotone]]s.\n\nEcoregions can be categorized using an [[algorithm]]ic approach or a holistic, \"weight-of-evidence\" approach where the importance of various factors may vary. An example of the algorithmic approach is [[Robert Bailey (geographer)|Robert Bailey]]'s work for the U.S. Forest Service, which uses a hierarchical classification that first divides land areas into very large regions based on climatic factors, and subdivides these regions, based first on dominant potential vegetation, and then by [[geomorphology]] and soil characteristics. The weight-of-evidence approach is exemplified by James Omernik's work for the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], subsequently adopted (with modification) for [[North America]] by the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]].\n\nThe intended purpose of ecoregion delineation may affect the method used. For example, the [[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]] ecoregions were developed to aid in biodiversity conservation planning, and place a greater emphasis than the Omernik or Bailey systems on floral and faunal differences between regions. The WWF classification defines an ecoregion as:\n\n<blockquote>A large area of land or water that contains a geographically distinct assemblage of natural communities that:\n:(a) Share a large majority of their species and ecological dynamics;\n:(b) Share similar environmental conditions, and;\n:(c) Interact ecologically in ways that are critical for their long-term persistence.</blockquote>\n\nAccording to WWF, the boundaries of an ecoregion approximate the original extent of the natural communities prior to any major recent disruptions or changes. WWF has identified 867 terrestrial ecoregions, and approximately 450 freshwater ecoregions across the Earth.\n\n[[File:Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World.jpg|thumb|Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World (Olson et al. 2001, BioScience)]]\n\n== Importance ==\nThe use of the term ecoregion is an outgrowth of a surge of interest in ecosystems and their functioning. In particular, there is awareness of issues relating to spatial scale in the study and management of [[landscape ecology|landscapes]]. It is widely recognized that interlinked ecosystems combine to form a whole that is \"greater than the sum of its parts\". There are many attempts to respond to ecosystems in an integrated way to achieve \"multi-functional\" landscapes, and various interest groups from [[agricultural]] researchers to [[conservationists]] are using the \"ecoregion\" as a unit of analysis.\n\nThe \"[[Global 200]]\" is the list of ecoregions identified by WWF as priorities for [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]].\n\nEcologically based movements like [[bioregionalism]] maintain that ecoregions, rather than arbitrarily defined political boundaries, provide a better foundation for the formation and governance of human communities, and have proposed ecoregions and [[drainage basin|watershed]]s as the basis for [[bioregional democracy]] initiatives.\n\n== Terrestrial ==<!-- This section is the link target for [[Terrestrial ecoregion]] -->\n[[File:Wwfeco.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|WWF terrestrial ecoregions]]\nTerrestrial ecoregions are land ecoregions, as distinct from freshwater and marine ecoregions. In this context, ''[[Landform|terrestrial]]'' is used to mean \"of land\" (soil and rock), rather than the more general sense \"of [[Earth]]\" (which includes land and oceans).\n\nWWF (World Wildlife Fund) [[ecologist]]s currently divide the land surface of the [[Earth]] into 8 major [[ecozone]]s containing 867 smaller terrestrial ecoregions (see [[List of terrestrial ecoregions (WWF)|list]]). The WWF effort is a synthesis of many previous efforts to define and classify ecoregions. Many consider this classification to be quite decisive, and some propose these as stable borders for [[bioregional democracy]] initiatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/science/ecoregions/item1267.html|title=Biomes - Conserving Biomes - WWF|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe eight terrestrial ecozones follow the major floral and faunal boundaries, identified by botanists and zoologists, that separate the world's major plant and animal communities. Ecozone boundaries generally follow [[continent]]al boundaries, or major barriers to plant and animal distribution, like the [[Himalayas]] and the [[Sahara]]. The boundaries of ecoregions are often not as decisive or well recognized, and are subject to greater disagreement.\n\nEcoregions are classified by [[biome]] type, which are the major global plant communities determined by rainfall and climate. Forests, grasslands (including savanna and shrubland), and deserts (including [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|xeric shrublands]]) are distinguished by climate ([[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] vs. [[temperate]] and [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] climates) and, for forests, by whether the trees are predominantly [[conifer]]s ([[gymnosperm]]s), or whether they are predominantly broadleaf ([[Angiosperm]]s) and mixed (broadleaf and conifer). Biome types like [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]]; [[tundra]]; and [[mangroves]] host very distinct ecological communities, and are recognized as distinct biome types as well.\n\n== Marine ==<!-- This section is the link target for [[Marine ecoregion]] and [[Wild fisheries]] -->\n[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|upright|left|upright=0.8|View of Earth, taken in 1972 by the [[Apollo 17]] crew.

Ecoregions cover relatively large areas of land or water, and contain characteristic, geographically distinct assemblages of natural [[community (ecology)|communities]] and [[species]]. The [[biodiversity]] of [[flora (plants)|flora]], [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] and [[ecosystems]] that characterise an ecoregion tends to be distinct from that of other ecoregions. In theory, biodiversity or conservation ecoregions are relatively large areas of land or water where the probability of encountering different species and communities at any given point remains relatively constant, within an acceptable range of variation (largely undefined at this point).\n\nThree caveats are appropriate for all bio-geographic mapping approaches. Firstly, no single bio-geographic framework is optimal for all taxa. Ecoregions reflect the best compromise for as many taxa as possible. Secondly, ecoregion boundaries rarely form abrupt edges; rather, [[ecotone]]s and mosaic [[habitat]]s bound them. Thirdly, most ecoregions contain habitats that differ from their assigned [[biome]]. Biogeographic provinces may originate due to various barriers, including physical (plate tectonics, topographic highs), climatic (latitudinal variation, seasonal range) and ocean chemical related (salinity, oxygen levels).\n\n==History==\nThe history of the term is somewhat vague, and it had been used in many contexts: forest classifications (Loucks, 1962), [[biome]] classifications (Bailey, 1976, 2014), [[biogeography|biogeographic]] classifications ([[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]]/[[Global 200]] scheme of Olson & Dinerstein, 1998), etc.<ref>Loucks, O.

(2000). ''Bioregional planning: resource management beyond the new millennium.'' Harwood Academic Publishers: Sydney, Australia.</ref> Omernik (2004) elaborates on this by defining ecoregions as: \"areas within which there is spatial coincidence in characteristics of [[geographical]] phenomena associated with differences in the quality, health, and integrity of [[ecosystems]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Omernik |first=J. M. |year=2004 |title=Perspectives on the Nature and Definition of Ecological Regions |work=Environmental Management |page=34 \u2013 Supplement 1, pp.27\u201338 }}</ref> \"Characteristics of geographical phenomena\" may include [[geology]], [[physiography]], vegetation, climate, [[hydrology]], terrestrial and [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] [[fauna]], and soils, and may or may not include the impacts of human activity (e.g. land use patterns, vegetation changes). There is significant, but not absolute, spatial correlation among these characteristics, making the delineation of ecoregions an imperfect science. Another complication is that environmental conditions across an ecoregion boundary may change very gradually, e.g. the prairie-forest transition in the midwestern United States, making it difficult to identify an exact dividing boundary. Such transition zones are called [[Ecotone|ecotones]].\n\nEcoregions can be categorized using an [[algorithm]]ic approach or a holistic, \"weight-of-evidence\" approach where the importance of various factors may vary. An example of the algorithmic approach is [[Robert Bailey (geographer)|Robert Bailey]]'s work for the U.S. Forest Service, which uses a hierarchical classification that first divides land areas into very large regions based on climatic factors, and subdivides these regions, based first on dominant potential vegetation, and then by [[geomorphology]] and soil characteristics. The weight-of-evidence approach is exemplified by James Omernik's work for the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], subsequently adopted (with modification) for [[North America]] by the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]].\n\nThe intended purpose of ecoregion delineation may affect the method used. For example, the [[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]] ecoregions were developed to aid in biodiversity conservation planning, and place a greater emphasis than the Omernik or Bailey systems on floral and faunal differences between regions. The WWF classification defines an ecoregion as:\n\n<blockquote>A large area of land or water that contains a geographically distinct assemblage of natural communities that:\n:(a) Share a large majority of their species and ecological dynamics;\n:(b) Share similar environmental conditions, and;\n:(c) Interact ecologically in ways that are critical for their long-term persistence.</blockquote>\n\nAccording to WWF, the boundaries of an ecoregion approximate the original extent of the natural communities prior to any major recent disruptions or changes. WWF has identified 867 terrestrial ecoregions, and approximately 450 freshwater ecoregions across the Earth.\n\n[[File:Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World.jpg|thumb|Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World (Olson et al. 2001, BioScience)]]\n\n== Importance ==\n\nThe use of the term ecoregion is an outgrowth of a surge of interest in ecosystems and their functioning. In particular, there is awareness of issues relating to spatial scale in the study and management of [[landscape ecology|landscapes]]. It is widely recognized that interlinked ecosystems combine to form a whole that is \"greater than the sum of its parts\". There are many attempts to respond to ecosystems in an integrated way to achieve \"multi-functional\" landscapes, and various interest groups from [[agricultural]] researchers to [[conservationists]] are using the \"ecoregion\" as a unit of analysis.\n\nThe \"[[Global 200]]\" is the list of ecoregions identified by WWF as priorities for [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]].\n\nEcologically based movements like [[bioregionalism]] maintain that ecoregions, rather than arbitrarily defined political boundaries, provide a better foundation for the formation and governance of human communities, and have proposed ecoregions and [[drainage basin|watershed]]s as the basis for [[bioregional democracy]] initiatives.\n\n== Terrestrial ==<!-- This section is the link target for [[Terrestrial ecoregion]] -->\n[[File:Wwfeco.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|WWF terrestrial ecoregions]]\nTerrestrial ecoregions are land ecoregions, as distinct from freshwater and marine ecoregions. In this context, ''[[Landform|terrestrial]]'' is used to mean \"of land\" (soil and rock), rather than the more general sense \"of [[Earth]]\" (which includes land and oceans).\n\nWWF (World Wildlife Fund) [[ecologist]]s currently divide the land surface of the [[Earth]] into 8 major [[ecozone]]s containing 867 smaller terrestrial ecoregions (see [[List of terrestrial ecoregions (WWF)|list]]). The WWF effort is a synthesis of many previous efforts to define and classify ecoregions. Many consider this classification to be quite decisive, and some propose these as stable borders for [[bioregional democracy]] initiatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/science/ecoregions/item1267.html|title=Biomes - Conserving Biomes - WWF|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe eight terrestrial ecozones follow the major floral and faunal boundaries, identified by botanists and zoologists, that separate the world's major plant and animal communities. Ecozone boundaries generally follow [[continent]]al boundaries, or major barriers to plant and animal distribution, like the [[Himalayas]] and the [[Sahara]]. The boundaries of ecoregions are often not as decisive or well recognized, and are subject to greater disagreement.\n\nEcoregions are classified by [[biome]] type, which are the major global plant communities determined by rainfall and climate. Forests, grasslands (including savanna and shrubland), and deserts (including [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|xeric shrublands]]) are distinguished by climate ([[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] vs. [[temperate]] and [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] climates) and, for forests, by whether the trees are predominantly [[conifer]]s ([[gymnosperm]]s), or whether they are predominantly broadleaf ([[Angiosperm]]s) and mixed (broadleaf and conifer). Biome types like [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]]; [[tundra]]; and [[mangroves]] host very distinct ecological communities, and are recognized as distinct biome types as well.\n\n== Marine ==<!-- This section is the link target for [[Marine ecoregion]] and [[Wild fisheries]] -->\n[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|upright|left|upright=0.8|View of Earth, taken in 1972 by the [[Apollo 17]] crew.
