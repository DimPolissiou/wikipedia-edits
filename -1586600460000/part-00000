The Act further defines a \"party political film\" as any film or video\n\n: ''(a) which is an advertisement made by or on behalf of any political party in Singapore or any body whose objects relate wholly or mainly to politics in Singapore, or any branch of such party or body; or''\n\n: ''(b) which is made by any person and directed towards any political end in Singapore''\n\nIn 2001, the short documentary called ''A Vision of Persistence'' on opposition politician [[J. B. Jeyaretnam]] was also banned for being a \"party political film\". The makers of the documentary, all lecturers at the Ngee Ann Polytechnic, later submitted written apologies and withdrew the documentary from being screened at the 2001 [[Singapore International Film Festival]] in April, having been told they could be charged in court. Another short documentary called ''Singapore Rebel'' by [[Martyn See]], which documented [[Singapore Democratic Party]] leader Dr [[Chee Soon Juan]]'s acts of civil disobedience, was banned from the 2005 [[Singapore International Film Festival]] on the same grounds and See is being investigated for possible violations of the Films Act.\n\nThis law, however, is often disregarded when such political films are made supporting the ruling [[People's Action Party]] (PAP). [[Channel NewsAsia]]'s five-part documentary series on Singapore's PAP ministers in 2005, for example, was not considered a party political film.\n\nExceptions are also made when political films are made concerning political parties of other nations. Films such as [[Michael Moore]]'s [[Fahrenheit 911]] are thus allowed to screen regardless of the law.\n\nSince March 2009, the Films Act has been amended to allow party political films as long as they were deemed factual and objective by a consultative committee.

In 1973, a military coup took power in Uruguay, and the State practiced censorship. For example, writer [[Eduardo Galeano]] was imprisoned and later was forced to flee. His book [[Open Veins of Latin America]] was banned by the right-wing military government, not only in Uruguay, but also in Chile and Argentina.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/5/28/eduardo|title=Fresh Off Worldwide Attention for Joining Obama's Book Collection, Uruguayan Author Eduardo Galeano Returns with \"Mirrors: Stories of Almost Everyone\"|date=28 May 2009|publisher=Democracynow.org|accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref>\n\n===State secrets and prevention of attention===\n[[File:WieczorWroclawia20marca1981.jpg|thumb|''[[Wiecz\u00f3r Wroc\u0142awia]]'' \u2013 Daily newspaper of [[Wroc\u0142aw]], [[People's Republic of Poland]], March 20\u201321, 1981, with censor intervention on first and last pages \u2013 under the headlines \"Co zdarzy\u0142o si\u0119 w Bydgoszczy?\" ([[Bydgoszcz events|What happened in Bydgoszcz?]]) and \"Pogotowie strajkowe w ca\u0142ym kraju\" (Country-wide strike alert). The censor had removed a section regarding the strike alert; hence the workers in the printing house blanked out an official propaganda section. The right-hand page also includes a hand-written confirmation of that decision by the local [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|\"Solidarno\u015b\u0107\" Trade Union]].]]\n\nIn wartime, explicit censorship is carried out with the intent of preventing the release of information that might be useful to an enemy. Typically it involves keeping times or locations secret, or delaying the release of information (e.g., an operational objective) until it is of no possible use to enemy forces. The moral issues here are often seen as somewhat different, as the proponents of this form of censorship argues that release of tactical information usually presents a greater risk of casualties among one's own forces and could possibly lead to loss of the overall conflict.\n\nDuring [[World War I]] letters written by British soldiers would have to go through censorship. This consisted of officers going through letters with a black marker and crossing out anything which might compromise operational secrecy before the letter was sent.<ref>Eberhard Demm: [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/censorship Censorship], in: [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/home.html/ 1914-1918-online. International Encyclopedia of the First World War].</ref> The [[World War II]] catchphrase \"[[Loose lips sink ships]]\" was used as a common justification to exercise official wartime censorship and encourage individual restraint when sharing potentially sensitive information.\n\nAn example of \"[[sanitization (classified information)|sanitization]]\" policies comes from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] under [[Joseph Stalin]], where publicly used photographs were often altered to remove people whom Stalin had condemned to execution. Though past photographs may have been remembered or kept, this deliberate and systematic alteration to all of history in the public mind is seen as one of the central themes of [[Stalinism]] and [[totalitarianism]].\n\nCensorship is occasionally carried out to aid authorities or to protect an individual, as with some kidnappings when attention and media coverage of the victim can sometimes be seen as unhelpful.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/29/technology/internet/29wiki.html_r=1&ref=todayspaper|title=New York Times}}</ref><ref>[http://rawstory.com/news/afp/Cat_and_mouse_at_Wikipedia_over_NYT_06292009.html The Raw Story | Investigative News and Politics]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Censorship by religion}}\nCensorship by religion is a form of censorship where [[freedom of expression]] is controlled or limited using [[religious authority]] or on the basis of the teachings of the [[religion]]. This form of censorship has a long history and is practiced in many societies and by many religions. Examples include the [[Galileo affair]], [[Edict of Compi\u00e8gne]], the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] (list of prohibited books) and the condemnation of [[Salman Rushdie]]'s novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' by [[Iran]]ian leader [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]]. Images of the Islamic figure Muhammad are also regularly censored. In some secular countries, this is sometimes done to prevent hurting religious sentiments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ncert.nic.in/textbook/textbook.htm?iess4=6-6|title=National Council Of Educational Research And Training :: Home (Page 105, Democratic Politics - Class 9)|last=|first=|date=|website=ncert.nic.in|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref>\n\n===Educational sources===\n[[File:Grech old russian censorship.jpg|thumb|Historic [[Russia]]n censorship.

The term [[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewashing]] is commonly used to refer to revisionism aimed at glossing over difficult or questionable historical events, or a biased presentation thereof. The [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|reporting of military atrocities in history]] is extremely controversial, as in the case of [[The Holocaust]] (or [[Holocaust denial]]), [[Bombing of Dresden]], the [[Nanking Massacre]] as found with [[Japanese history textbook controversies]], the [[Armenian Genocide]], the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], and the [[Winter Soldier Investigation]] of the [[Vietnam War]].\n\nIn the context of secondary school education, the way facts and history are presented greatly influences the interpretation of contemporary thought, opinion and socialization. One argument for censoring the type of information disseminated is based on the inappropriate quality of such material for the young. The use of the \"inappropriate\" distinction is in itself controversial, as it changed heavily. A Ballantine Books version of the book ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' which is the version used by most school classes<ref>Bradbury, Ray. ''Fahrenheit 451''. Del Rey Books. April 1991.</ref> contained approximately 75 separate edits, omissions, and changes from the original Bradbury manuscript.\n\nIn February 2006, a ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' cover was censored by the [[Nashravaran Journalistic Institute]].

As a result, books can be removed from schools or libraries, although these bans do not extend outside of that area.\n\n===Films===\n{{Main|Film censorship}}\nAside from the usual justifications of pornography and obscenity, some films are censored due to changing racial attitudes or [[political correctness]] in order to avoid [[ethnic stereotype|ethnic stereotyping]] and/or ethnic offense despite its historical or artistic value.

It may be carried out by governments or by private organizations either at the behest of government or on their own initiative. Individuals and organizations may engage in [[self-censorship]] on their own or due to intimidation and fear.\n\nThe issues associated with Internet censorship are similar to those for offline censorship of more traditional media. One difference is that national borders are more permeable online: residents of a country that bans certain information can find it on websites hosted outside the country. Thus censors must work to prevent access to information even though they lack physical or legal control over the websites themselves. This in turn requires the use of technical censorship methods that are unique to the Internet, such as site blocking and content filtering.<ref name=UNESCO-2011>[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/publications-and-communication-materials/publications/full-list/freedom-of-connection-freedom-of-expression-the-changing-legal-and-regulatory-ecology-shaping-the-internet/ ''Freedom of Connection, Freedom of Expression: The Changing Legal and Regulatory Ecology Shaping the Internet''], Dutton, William H.; Dopatka, Anna; Law, Ginette; Nash, Victoria, Division for Freedom of Expression, Democracy and Peace, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Paris, 2011, 103 pp., {{ISBN|978-92-3-104188-4}}</ref>\n\nUnless the censor has total control over all Internet-connected computers, such as in [[Internet censorship in North Korea|North Korea]] or [[Internet censorship in cuba|Cuba]], total censorship of information is very difficult or impossible to achieve due to the underlying distributed technology of the Internet. [[Pseudonymity]] and [[data haven]]s (such as [[Freenet]]) protect [[free speech]] using technologies that guarantee material cannot be removed and prevents the identification of authors. Technologically savvy users can often find ways to [[Internet censorship circumvention|access blocked content]]. Nevertheless, blocking remains an effective means of limiting access to sensitive information for most users when censors, such as those in [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China]], are able to devote significant resources to building and maintaining a comprehensive censorship system.<ref name=UNESCO-2011/>\n\nViews about the feasibility and effectiveness of Internet censorship have evolved in parallel with the development of the Internet and censorship technologies:\n* A 1993 ''Time Magazine'' article quotes computer scientist [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gillmore]], one of the founders of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], as saying \"The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.\"<ref>[http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/outerspace/internet-article.html \"First Nation in Cyberspace\"], Philip Elmer-Dewitt, ''Time'', 6 December 1993, No. 49</ref>\n* In November 2007, \"Father of the Internet\" [[Vint Cerf]] stated that he sees government control of the Internet failing because the Web is almost entirely privately owned.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUSN1420689320071114?sp=true \"Cerf sees government control of Internet failing\"], Pedro Fonseca, Reuters, 14 November 2007</ref>\n* A report of research conducted in 2007 and published in 2009 by the Beckman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University stated that: \"We are confident that the [censorship circumvention] tool developers will for the most part keep ahead of the governments' blocking efforts\", but also that \"...we believe that less than two percent of all filtered Internet users use circumvention tools\".<ref>[http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/sites/cyber.law.harvard.edu/files/2007_Circumvention_Landscape.pdf ''2007 Circumvention Landscape Report: Methods, Uses, and Tools''], Hal Roberts, Ethan Zuckerman, and John Palfrey, Beckman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, March 2009</ref>\n* In contrast, a 2011 report by researchers at the [[Oxford Internet Institute]] published by [[UNESCO]] concludes \"... the control of information on the Internet and Web is certainly feasible, and technological advances do not therefore guarantee greater freedom of speech.\"<ref name=UNESCO-2011/>\n\nA [[Internet censorship#BBC World Service global public opinion poll|BBC World Service poll]] of 27,973 adults in 26 countries, including 14,306 Internet users,<ref>For the BBC poll Internet users are those who used the Internet within the previous six months.</ref> was conducted between 30 November 2009 and 7 February 2010. The head of the polling organization felt, overall, that the poll showed that:\n:Despite worries about privacy and fraud, people around the world see access to the internet as their fundamental right. They think the web is a force for good, and most don't want governments to regulate it.<ref name=BBCPoll-2010>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/08_03_10_BBC_internet_poll.pdf \"BBC Internet Poll: Detailed Findings\"], BBC World Service, 8 March 2010</ref>\n\nThe poll found that nearly four in five (78%) Internet users felt that the Internet had brought them greater freedom, that most Internet users (53%) felt that \"the internet should never be regulated by any level of government anywhere\", and almost four in five Internet users and non-users around the world felt that access to the Internet was a fundamental right (50% strongly agreed, 29% somewhat agreed, 9% somewhat disagreed, 6% strongly disagreed, and 6% gave no opinion).<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8548190.stm \"Internet access is 'a fundamental right'\"], BBC News, 8 March 2010</ref>\n\n====Social media====\nThe rising usages of social media in many nations has led to the emergence of citizens organizing protests through social media, sometimes called \"[[Twitter Revolution (disambiguation)|Twitter Revolution]]s\". The most notable of these social media led protests were parts [[Social media and the Arab Spring|Arab Spring uprisings]], starting in 2010. In response to the use of social media in these protests, the Tunisian government began a hack of Tunisian citizens' Facebook accounts, and reports arose of accounts being deleted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/01/the-inside-story-of-how-facebook-responded-to-tunisian-hacks/70044/|title=The Inside Story of How Facebook Responded to Tunisian Hacks|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis C.|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-15}}</ref>\n\nAutomated systems can be used to censor [[social media]] posts, and therefore limit what citizens can say online. This most notably occurs in [[Censorship in China|China]], where social media posts are automatically censored depending on content. In 2013, Harvard political science professor [[Gary King (political scientist)|Gary King]] led a study to determine what caused social media posts to be censored and found that posts mentioning the government were not more or less likely to be deleted if they were supportive or critical of the government. Posts mentioning collective action were more likely to be deleted than those that had not mentioned collective action.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Gary|last2=Pan|first2=Jennifer|date=2014|title=Reverse-engineering censorship in China: Randomized experimentation and participant observation|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.1251722|pmid=25146296|volume=345|issue=6199|pages=1251722|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:37091695}}</ref> Currently, social media censorship appears primarily as a way to restrict Internet users' ability to organize protests.  For the Chinese government, seeing citizens unhappy with local governance is beneficial as state and national leaders can replace unpopular officials. King and his researchers were able to predict when certain officials would be removed based on the number of unfavorable social media posts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/151768150|title=Professor Gary King, Inaugural Government Regius Lecture 2015|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-04-12|date=2016-01-14}}</ref>\n\nResearch has proved that criticism is tolerable on social media sites, therefore it is not censored unless it has a higher chance of collective action. It isn't important whether the criticism is supportive or unsupportive of the states' leaders, the main priority of censoring certain social media posts is to make sure that no big actions are being made due to something that was said on the internet. Posts that challenge the Party's political leading role in the Chinese government are more likely to be censored due to the challenges it poses to the Chinese Communist Party.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shao |first1=Li |title=The Dilemma of Criticism: Disentangling the Determinants of Media Censorship in China |journal=Journal of East Asian Studies |date=11/01/2018 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=279\u2013297 |doi=10.1017/jea.2018.19}}</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n{{Main |Video game censorship |List of regionally censored video games}}\n\nSince the early 1980s, advocates of video games have emphasized their use as an [[games as art|expressive medium]], arguing for their protection under the laws governing [[freedom of speech]] and also as an educational tool.

The main organ for official censorship in the Soviet Union was the ''Chief Agency for Protection of Military and State Secrets'' generally known as the ''[[Main Administration for Safeguarding State Secrets in the Press|Glavlit]]'', its Russian acronym. The ''Glavlit'' handled censorship matters arising from domestic writings of just about any kind{{snd}}even beer and vodka labels. ''Glavlit'' censorship personnel were present in every large Soviet publishing house or newspaper; the agency employed some 70,000 censors to review information before it was disseminated by publishing houses, editorial offices, and broadcasting studios. No mass medium escaped ''Glavlit''{{'}}s control. All press agencies and radio and television stations had ''Glavlit'' representatives on their editorial staffs.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nSometimes, public knowledge of the existence of a specific document is subtly suppressed, a situation resembling censorship. The authorities taking such action will justify it by declaring the work to be \"[[subversion (politics)|subversive]]\" or \"inconvenient\". An example is [[Michel Foucault]]'s 1978 text ''[[Sexual Morality and the Law]]'' (later republished as ''The Danger of Child Sexuality''), originally published as ''La loi de la pudeur'' &#91;literally, \"the law of decency\"&#93;. This work defends the decriminalization of [[statutory rape]] and the [[age of consent reform|abolition of age of consent laws]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nWhen a publisher comes under pressure to suppress a book, but has already entered into a contract with the author, they will sometimes effectively censor the book by deliberately ordering a small print run and making minimal, if any, attempts to publicize it. This practice became known in the early 2000s as ''privishing'' ('''priv'''ate publ'''ishing''').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0711-05.htm |title=Journalists Thrown 'Into the Buzzsaw' |last=Winkler |first=David |date=11 July 2002 |publisher=CommonDreams.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804080018/http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0711-05.htm |archivedate=August 4, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n[[File:2014 Cenzura.jpg|thumb|upright| Artistic allegory of communist press censorship, 1989]]\nCensorship has been criticized throughout history for being unfair and hindering progress. In a 1997 essay on Internet censorship, social commentator Michael Landier claims that censorship is counterproductive as it prevents the censored topic from being discussed. Landier expands his argument by claiming that those who impose censorship must consider what they censor to be true, as individuals believing themselves to be correct would welcome the opportunity to disprove those with opposing views.<ref>[http://www.landier.com/michael/essays/censorship/fulltext.htm \"Internet Censorship is Absurd and Unconstitutional\"], Michael Landier, 4 June 1997</ref>\n\nCensorship is often used to impose moral values on society, as in the censorship of material considered obscene. English novelist [[E. M. Forster]] was a staunch opponent of censoring material on the grounds that it was obscene or immoral, raising the issue of moral subjectivity and the constant changing of moral values. When the novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' was [[R v Penguin Books Ltd|put on trial in 1960]], Forster wrote:<ref>[http://dangerousminds.net/comments/the_trial_of_lady_chatterleys_lover \"The Trial of ''Lady Chatterley's Lover''\"], Paul Gallagher, Dangerous Minds, 10 November 2010</ref>\n\n{{quotation|''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' is a literary work of importance...I do not think that it could be held obscene, but am in a difficulty here, for the reason that I have never been able to follow the legal definition of obscenity.

The Act further defines a \"party political film\" as any film or video\n\n: ''(a) which is an advertisement made by or on behalf of any political party in Singapore or any body whose objects relate wholly or mainly to politics in Singapore, or any branch of such party or body; or''\n\n: ''(b) which is made by any person and directed towards any political end in Singapore''\n\nIn 2001, the short documentary called ''A Vision of Persistence'' on opposition politician [[J. B. Jeyaretnam]] was also banned for being a \"party political film\". The makers of the documentary, all lecturers at the Ngee Ann Polytechnic, later submitted written apologies and withdrew the documentary from being screened at the 2001 [[Singapore International Film Festival]] in April, having been told they could be charged in court. Another short documentary called ''Singapore Rebel'' by [[Martyn See]], which documented [[Singapore Democratic Party]] leader Dr [[Chee Soon Juan]]'s acts of civil disobedience, was banned from the 2005 [[Singapore International Film Festival]] on the same grounds and See is being investigated for possible violations of the Films Act.\n\nThis law, however, is often disregarded when such political films are made supporting the ruling [[People's Action Party]] (PAP). [[Channel NewsAsia]]'s five-part documentary series on Singapore's PAP ministers in 2005, for example, was not considered a party political film.\n\nExceptions are also made when political films are made concerning political parties of other nations. Films such as [[Michael Moore]]'s [[Fahrenheit 911]] are thus allowed to screen regardless of the law.\n\nSince March 2009, the Films Act has been amended to allow party political films as long as they were deemed factual and objective by a consultative committee. Some months later, this committee lifted the ban on Singapore Rebel.\n\n==== Soviet Union ====\n{{main|Censorship in the Soviet Union}}\nIndependent journalism did not exist in the [[Soviet Union]] until [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became its leader; all reporting was directed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] or related organizations. [[Pravda]], the predominant newspaper in the Soviet Union, had a monopoly. Foreign newspapers were available only if they were published by [[communist parties]] sympathetic to the Soviet Union.\n\n==== Spain ====\n{{main|Censorship in Spain}}\n\n====Turkey====\n{{See also|Censorship in Turkey|2017 block of Wikipedia in Turkey}}\nOnline access to all language versions of [[Wikipedia]] was blocked in [[Turkey]] on 29 April 2017 by [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan|Erdo\u011fan]]'s government.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39754909|title=Turkish authorities block Wikipedia without giving reason|date=29 April 2017|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n====United Kingdom====\n{{main|Censorship in the United Kingdom}}\n\n====United States====\n{{main|Censorship in the United States|Book censorship in the United States}}In the United States, censorship occurs through books, film festivals, politics, and public schools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ncac.org/issue/books|title=Books|website=National Coalition Against Censorship|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-11}}</ref> See [[List of books banned by governments|banned books]] for more information.

In 1973, a military coup took power in Uruguay, and the State practiced censorship. For example, writer [[Eduardo Galeano]] was imprisoned and later was forced to flee. His book [[Open Veins of Latin America]] was banned by the right-wing military government, not only in Uruguay, but also in Chile and Argentina.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/5/28/eduardo|title=Fresh Off Worldwide Attention for Joining Obama's Book Collection, Uruguayan Author Eduardo Galeano Returns with \"Mirrors: Stories of Almost Everyone\"|date=28 May 2009|publisher=Democracynow.org|accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref>\n\n===State secrets and prevention of attention===\n[[File:WieczorWroclawia20marca1981.jpg|thumb|''[[Wiecz\u00f3r Wroc\u0142awia]]'' \u2013 Daily newspaper of [[Wroc\u0142aw]], [[People's Republic of Poland]], March 20\u201321, 1981, with censor intervention on first and last pages \u2013 under the headlines \"Co zdarzy\u0142o si\u0119 w Bydgoszczy?\" ([[Bydgoszcz events|What happened in Bydgoszcz?]]) and \"Pogotowie strajkowe w ca\u0142ym kraju\" (Country-wide strike alert). The censor had removed a section regarding the strike alert; hence the workers in the printing house blanked out an official propaganda section. The right-hand page also includes a hand-written confirmation of that decision by the local [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|\"Solidarno\u015b\u0107\" Trade Union]].]]\n\nIn wartime, explicit censorship is carried out with the intent of preventing the release of information that might be useful to an enemy. Typically it involves keeping times or locations secret, or delaying the release of information (e.g., an operational objective) until it is of no possible use to enemy forces. The moral issues here are often seen as somewhat different, as the proponents of this form of censorship argues that release of tactical information usually presents a greater risk of casualties among one's own forces and could possibly lead to loss of the overall conflict.\n\nDuring [[World War I]] letters written by British soldiers would have to go through censorship. This consisted of officers going through letters with a black marker and crossing out anything which might compromise operational secrecy before the letter was sent.<ref>Eberhard Demm: [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/censorship Censorship], in: [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/home.html/ 1914-1918-online. International Encyclopedia of the First World War].</ref> The [[World War II]] catchphrase \"[[Loose lips sink ships]]\" was used as a common justification to exercise official wartime censorship and encourage individual restraint when sharing potentially sensitive information.\n\nAn example of \"[[sanitization (classified information)|sanitization]]\" policies comes from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] under [[Joseph Stalin]], where publicly used photographs were often altered to remove people whom Stalin had condemned to execution. Though past photographs may have been remembered or kept, this deliberate and systematic alteration to all of history in the public mind is seen as one of the central themes of [[Stalinism]] and [[totalitarianism]].\n\nCensorship is occasionally carried out to aid authorities or to protect an individual, as with some kidnappings when attention and media coverage of the victim can sometimes be seen as unhelpful.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/29/technology/internet/29wiki.html_r=1&ref=todayspaper|title=New York Times}}</ref><ref>[http://rawstory.com/news/afp/Cat_and_mouse_at_Wikipedia_over_NYT_06292009.html The Raw Story | Investigative News and Politics]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Censorship by religion}}\nCensorship by religion is a form of censorship where [[freedom of expression]] is controlled or limited using [[religious authority]] or on the basis of the teachings of the [[religion]]. This form of censorship has a long history and is practiced in many societies and by many religions. Examples include the [[Galileo affair]], [[Edict of Compi\u00e8gne]], the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] (list of prohibited books) and the condemnation of [[Salman Rushdie]]'s novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' by [[Iran]]ian leader [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]]. Images of the Islamic figure Muhammad are also regularly censored. In some secular countries, this is sometimes done to prevent hurting religious sentiments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ncert.nic.in/textbook/textbook.htm?iess4=6-6|title=National Council Of Educational Research And Training :: Home (Page 105, Democratic Politics - Class 9)|last=|first=|date=|website=ncert.nic.in|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref>\n\n===Educational sources===\n[[File:Grech old russian censorship.jpg|thumb|Historic [[Russia]]n censorship.

The censored text was replaced by dots.]]\n\nThe content of school textbooks is often an issue of debate, since their target audience is young people. The term [[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewashing]] is commonly used to refer to revisionism aimed at glossing over difficult or questionable historical events, or a biased presentation thereof. The [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|reporting of military atrocities in history]] is extremely controversial, as in the case of [[The Holocaust]] (or [[Holocaust denial]]), [[Bombing of Dresden]], the [[Nanking Massacre]] as found with [[Japanese history textbook controversies]], the [[Armenian Genocide]], the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], and the [[Winter Soldier Investigation]] of the [[Vietnam War]].\n\nIn the context of secondary school education, the way facts and history are presented greatly influences the interpretation of contemporary thought, opinion and socialization. One argument for censoring the type of information disseminated is based on the inappropriate quality of such material for the young. The use of the \"inappropriate\" distinction is in itself controversial, as it changed heavily.

It may be carried out by governments or by private organizations either at the behest of government or on their own initiative. Individuals and organizations may engage in [[self-censorship]] on their own or due to intimidation and fear.\n\nThe issues associated with Internet censorship are similar to those for offline censorship of more traditional media. One difference is that national borders are more permeable online: residents of a country that bans certain information can find it on websites hosted outside the country. Thus censors must work to prevent access to information even though they lack physical or legal control over the websites themselves. This in turn requires the use of technical censorship methods that are unique to the Internet, such as site blocking and content filtering.<ref name=UNESCO-2011>[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/publications-and-communication-materials/publications/full-list/freedom-of-connection-freedom-of-expression-the-changing-legal-and-regulatory-ecology-shaping-the-internet/ ''Freedom of Connection, Freedom of Expression: The Changing Legal and Regulatory Ecology Shaping the Internet''], Dutton, William H.; Dopatka, Anna; Law, Ginette; Nash, Victoria, Division for Freedom of Expression, Democracy and Peace, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Paris, 2011, 103 pp., {{ISBN|978-92-3-104188-4}}</ref>\n\nUnless the censor has total control over all Internet-connected computers, such as in [[Internet censorship in North Korea|North Korea]] or [[Internet censorship in cuba|Cuba]], total censorship of information is very difficult or impossible to achieve due to the underlying distributed technology of the Internet.

They think the web is a force for good, and most don't want governments to regulate it.<ref name=BBCPoll-2010>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/08_03_10_BBC_internet_poll.pdf \"BBC Internet Poll: Detailed Findings\"], BBC World Service, 8 March 2010</ref>\n\nThe poll found that nearly four in five (78%) Internet users felt that the Internet had brought them greater freedom, that most Internet users (53%) felt that \"the internet should never be regulated by any level of government anywhere\", and almost four in five Internet users and non-users around the world felt that access to the Internet was a fundamental right (50% strongly agreed, 29% somewhat agreed, 9% somewhat disagreed, 6% strongly disagreed, and 6% gave no opinion).<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8548190.stm \"Internet access is 'a fundamental right'\"], BBC News, 8 March 2010</ref>\n\n====Social media====\nThe rising usages of social media in many nations has led to the emergence of citizens organizing protests through social media, sometimes called \"[[Twitter Revolution (disambiguation)|Twitter Revolution]]s\". The most notable of these social media led protests were parts [[Social media and the Arab Spring|Arab Spring uprisings]], starting in 2010. In response to the use of social media in these protests, the Tunisian government began a hack of Tunisian citizens' Facebook accounts, and reports arose of accounts being deleted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/01/the-inside-story-of-how-facebook-responded-to-tunisian-hacks/70044/|title=The Inside Story of How Facebook Responded to Tunisian Hacks|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis C.|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-15}}</ref>\n\nAutomated systems can be used to censor [[social media]] posts, and therefore limit what citizens can say online. This most notably occurs in [[Censorship in China|China]], where social media posts are automatically censored depending on content. In 2013, Harvard political science professor [[Gary King (political scientist)|Gary King]] led a study to determine what caused social media posts to be censored and found that posts mentioning the government were not more or less likely to be deleted if they were supportive or critical of the government. Posts mentioning collective action were more likely to be deleted than those that had not mentioned collective action.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Gary|last2=Pan|first2=Jennifer|date=2014|title=Reverse-engineering censorship in China: Randomized experimentation and participant observation|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.1251722|pmid=25146296|volume=345|issue=6199|pages=1251722|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:37091695}}</ref> Currently, social media censorship appears primarily as a way to restrict Internet users' ability to organize protests.  For the Chinese government, seeing citizens unhappy with local governance is beneficial as state and national leaders can replace unpopular officials. King and his researchers were able to predict when certain officials would be removed based on the number of unfavorable social media posts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/151768150|title=Professor Gary King, Inaugural Government Regius Lecture 2015|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-04-12|date=2016-01-14}}</ref>\n\nResearch has proved that criticism is tolerable on social media sites, therefore it is not censored unless it has a higher chance of collective action. It isn't important whether the criticism is supportive or unsupportive of the states' leaders, the main priority of censoring certain social media posts is to make sure that no big actions are being made due to something that was said on the internet. Posts that challenge the Party's political leading role in the Chinese government are more likely to be censored due to the challenges it poses to the Chinese Communist Party.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shao |first1=Li |title=The Dilemma of Criticism: Disentangling the Determinants of Media Censorship in China |journal=Journal of East Asian Studies |date=11/01/2018 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=279\u2013297 |doi=10.1017/jea.2018.19}}</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n{{Main |Video game censorship |List of regionally censored video games}}\n\nSince the early 1980s, advocates of video games have emphasized their use as an [[games as art|expressive medium]], arguing for their protection under the laws governing [[freedom of speech]] and also as an educational tool.

The main organ for official censorship in the Soviet Union was the ''Chief Agency for Protection of Military and State Secrets'' generally known as the ''[[Main Administration for Safeguarding State Secrets in the Press|Glavlit]]'', its Russian acronym. The ''Glavlit'' handled censorship matters arising from domestic writings of just about any kind{{snd}}even beer and vodka labels. ''Glavlit'' censorship personnel were present in every large Soviet publishing house or newspaper; the agency employed some 70,000 censors to review information before it was disseminated by publishing houses, editorial offices, and broadcasting studios. No mass medium escaped ''Glavlit''{{'}}s control. All press agencies and radio and television stations had ''Glavlit'' representatives on their editorial staffs.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nSometimes, public knowledge of the existence of a specific document is subtly suppressed, a situation resembling censorship. The authorities taking such action will justify it by declaring the work to be \"[[subversion (politics)|subversive]]\" or \"inconvenient\". An example is [[Michel Foucault]]'s 1978 text ''[[Sexual Morality and the Law]]'' (later republished as ''The Danger of Child Sexuality''), originally published as ''La loi de la pudeur'' &#91;literally, \"the law of decency\"&#93;. This work defends the decriminalization of [[statutory rape]] and the [[age of consent reform|abolition of age of consent laws]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nWhen a publisher comes under pressure to suppress a book, but has already entered into a contract with the author, they will sometimes effectively censor the book by deliberately ordering a small print run and making minimal, if any, attempts to publicize it. This practice became known in the early 2000s as ''privishing'' ('''priv'''ate publ'''ishing''').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0711-05.htm |title=Journalists Thrown 'Into the Buzzsaw' |last=Winkler |first=David |date=11 July 2002 |publisher=CommonDreams.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804080018/http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0711-05.htm |archivedate=August 4, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n[[File:2014 Cenzura.jpg|thumb|upright| Artistic allegory of communist press censorship, 1989]]\nCensorship has been criticized throughout history for being unfair and hindering progress. In a 1997 essay on Internet censorship, social commentator Michael Landier claims that censorship is counterproductive as it prevents the censored topic from being discussed. Landier expands his argument by claiming that those who impose censorship must consider what they censor to be true, as individuals believing themselves to be correct would welcome the opportunity to disprove those with opposing views.<ref>[http://www.landier.com/michael/essays/censorship/fulltext.htm \"Internet Censorship is Absurd and Unconstitutional\"], Michael Landier, 4 June 1997</ref>\n\nCensorship is often used to impose moral values on society, as in the censorship of material considered obscene. English novelist [[E. M. Forster]] was a staunch opponent of censoring material on the grounds that it was obscene or immoral, raising the issue of moral subjectivity and the constant changing of moral values. When the novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' was [[R v Penguin Books Ltd|put on trial in 1960]], Forster wrote:<ref>[http://dangerousminds.net/comments/the_trial_of_lady_chatterleys_lover \"The Trial of ''Lady Chatterley's Lover''\"], Paul Gallagher, Dangerous Minds, 10 November 2010</ref>\n\n{{quotation|''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' is a literary work of importance...I do not think that it could be held obscene, but am in a difficulty here, for the reason that I have never been able to follow the legal definition of obscenity.

Around the age of 13, he moved to [[Iraq]] and took up residence in the holy city of [[Najaf]] where he began studying Shia theology with the scholars of that city.  He eventually attained the rank of Ayatollah and was subsequently made a [[Marja'|marja]].  Khoei would continue to live in Najaf, becoming a teacher for the remainder of his life, and overseeing the studies of scholars who would be qualified to issue fatwas based on Shia theology.\n\nDue to his prominent position as a teacher and scholar in Najaf, he became an important leader of worldwide Shias.  He was made the most prominent Grand Ayatollah in 1971 after the death of [[Muhsin al-Hakim]].  In this position, he became a patron of numerous institutions across the globe that sought to provide welfare, and also provided scholarships to theological students from across the Muslim world.\n\nHe is considered as the architect of a distinct school of thought in the principles of jurisprudence and Islamic law, and one of the leading exponents of 'kalam'-scholastic theology- and 'rijal'- study of the biographies of transmitters of ahadith, the prophetic traditions, 'fiqh'- jurisprudence- and 'tafseer'- exegesis of the Qur'an. His interests included astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy.\n\nAl-Khoei's status as the pre-eminent scholar of his age did not go unchallenged. In the 1970s, Grand Ayatollah [[Mohammad al-Husayni al-Shirazi|Mohammed Al-Shirazi]], a radical theologian based in [[Karbala]] had a long running feud with Al Khoei and his fellow clerics in Najaf over the legitimacy of theocratic rule.

Around the age of 13, he moved to [[Iraq]] and took up residence in the holy city of [[Najaf]] where he began studying Shia theology with the scholars of that city.  He eventually attained the rank of Ayatollah and was subsequently made a [[Marja'|marja]].  Khoei would continue to live in Najaf, becoming a teacher for the remainder of his life, and overseeing the studies of scholars who would be qualified to issue fatwas based on Shia theology.\n\nDue to his prominent position as a teacher and scholar in Najaf, he became an important leader of worldwide Shias.  He was made the most prominent Grand Ayatollah in 1971 after the death of [[Muhsin al-Hakim]].  In this position, he became a patron of numerous institutions across the globe that sought to provide welfare, and also provided scholarships to theological students from across the Muslim world.\n\nHe is considered as the architect of a distinct school of thought in the principles of jurisprudence and Islamic law, and one of the leading exponents of 'kalam'-scholastic theology- and 'rijal'- study of the biographies of transmitters of ahadith, the prophetic traditions, 'fiqh'- jurisprudence- and 'tafseer'- exegesis of the Qur'an. His interests included astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy.\n\nAl-Khoei's status as the pre-eminent scholar of his age did not go unchallenged. In the 1970s, Grand Ayatollah [[Mohammad al-Husayni al-Shirazi|Mohammed Al-Shirazi]], a radical theologian based in [[Karbala]] had a long running feud with Al Khoei and his fellow clerics in Najaf over the legitimacy of theocratic rule. The dispute resulted in Al-Khoei seeking to dismiss Al Shirazi's status as a religious scholar.<ref>[http://www.aei.org/outlook/foreign-and-defense-policy/regional/middle-east-and-north-africa/has-kuwait-reached-the-sectarian-tipping-point/ Has Kuwait reached the sectarian tipping point?], [[American Enterprise Institute]], August 14, 2013</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], Khoei was arrested by [[Saddam Hussein]] during the mass Shia uprising that followed the defeat of Iraqi forces.

The cap can be pure white, or white at the edge and yellowish, pinkish, or tan at the center. It has a partial veil, or ring ([[Annulus (mycology)|annulus]]) circling the upper stalk, and the gills are \"free\", not attached to the stalk.

This structure  breaks as the young mushroom expands, leaving parts that can be found at the base of the stalk as a boot or cuplike structure, and there may be patches of removable material on the cap surface. This combination of features, all found together in the same mushroom, is the hallmark of the family. While other families may have any one or two of these features, none has them all. The cap is usually about 5\u201312&nbsp;cm across; the [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is usually {{frac|7|1|2}}\u201320&nbsp;cm long and about {{frac|1|2}}\u20132&nbsp;cm thick.

The toxin responsible for this is [[amatoxin]], which inhibits [[RNA polymerase II]] and [[RNA polymerase III|III]]. Symptoms do not appear for 5 to 24 hours, by which time the toxins may already be absorbed and the damage (destruction of liver and kidney tissues) is irreversible. As little as half a mushroom cap can be fatal if the victim is not treated quickly enough. The symptoms include vomiting, cramps, delirium, convulsions, and diarrhea.
