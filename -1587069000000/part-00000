The series is notable for its [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]] gameplay and extensive use of the [[video game console]]'s internal clock and calendar to simulate [[Real time (media)|real passage of time]].\n\nSince its [[Animal Crossing (video game)|initial release]] in 2001, five ''Animal Crossing'' games have been released worldwide, one each for the [[Nintendo 64]]/[[iQue Player]] (enhanced and reissued for the [[GameCube]]), [[Nintendo DS]], [[Wii]], [[Nintendo 3DS]] and [[Nintendo Switch]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techradar.com/news/animal-crossing-on-nintendo-switch|title=Animal Crossing on Nintendo Switch: release date, news and features|last=Hood|first=Vic|last2=Gaming|first2=Nick Pino 2019-06-18T17:06:19Z|website=TechRadar|language=en|access-date=2019-07-24}}</ref> The series has been both critically and commercially successful and has sold over 30 million units worldwide. Three spin-off games have also been released: ''[[Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer]]'' for [[Nintendo 3DS]], ''[[Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival]]'' for [[Wii U]], and ''[[Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp]]'' for mobile devices.\n\n== Common elements ==\n\n=== Characters ===\nWhile the series features various villagers for each title, certain prominent characters return in each series installment. [[Tom Nook]] is a [[Japanese raccoon dog|tanuki]] character who functions as both a shop owner and real estate broker, giving the player a loan for their house and allowing them to pay it back with no interest. He is one of the only residents of the town to follow a [[Capitalism|capitalist]] ethos. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/tom-nook-needs-to-get-with-the-times-1829149177|title=Tom Nook Needs To Get With The Times|last=Jackson|first=Gita|website=Kotaku|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref> [[Mr. Resetti]] is a mole character who appears from underground whenever players shut off the game without saving, berating them for circumventing one of the game's systems. Due to a new [[autosave]] function, he was \"laid off\" from his job in ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'', although he has gotten a new job as the Rescue Service operator. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/17/animal-crossing-new-horizons-autosave-resettis-job/|title=Animal Crossing New Horizons has autosave, so Resetti's out of a job|date=2019-06-17|website=VG247|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref>\n\n[[K.K.

This was seen by some fans as tacit support for [[music piracy]], although Nintendo denied that it was intended as [[social commentary]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/19/technology/social-commentary-or-just-a-dogs-opinion.html|title=Social Commentary, or Just a Dog's Opinion?|last=Jr|first=Tom Zeller|date=2005-12-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===Gameplay===\nIn the ''Animal Crossing'' games, the player assumes the role of a human child, aged between 9-13, who moves into a rural village populated with anthropomorphic animals and lives there indefinitely. Gameplay is [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]]: players have no defined objectives, but are instead encouraged to spend their time in the village performing any number of activities, which include collecting items, planting plants or other items, and socializing with the village's residents. ''Animal Crossing'' games are played in [[Real time (media)|real time]], utilizing the [[video game console]]'s internal clock and calendar. Thus, passage of time in the game world reflects that in reality, as well as the current season and time of day. Some in-game events, such as holidays or the growth of a tree, occur at certain times or require some duration of time to have passed.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\"/>\n\nOne notable feature of the ''Animal Crossing'' series is the high level of customization available, some of which affects the outcome of the game.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\" /> The [[player character]] is both named and gendered by the real life player at the start of the game, and their appearance can be modified by buying or designing custom clothes and accessories or changing the hairstyle (introduced in ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World|Wild World]]''). The player's house can also be furnished, decorated, and later expanded: the player can purchase and collect furniture and place it anywhere in the house, as well as change both the wallpaper and floor designs. While its terrain, building locations, and initial residents are randomly generated when the game is first begun (except in ''Animal Crossing: New Leaf'', in which the player decides between four given towns, and ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'', in which the player similarly decides between four given islands), the village's name and anthem, as well as some of the residents' catchphrases, are also determined by the player.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\"/>\n\nCollecting items is a major facet of ''Animal Crossing'': the player can explore the village and gather objects, including fruit from trees, seashells, and discarded items. Nearly all objects can be sold for Bells, the in-game currency. Players collect objects to obtain more Bells, which can then be used to buy furniture and clothing, purchase home expansions, invest in stocks, and play games. A number of specialized tools are available for other activities such as fishing and insect collecting. Special items, such as fossils and paintings, may be donated to the village museum. The player can choose to socialize with the other animal residents by engaging in conversation, sending and receiving letters, bartering, or playing hide-and-seek. Residents may move in or out of the village depending on the player's actions.\n\nAll installments of ''Animal Crossing'' allow some form of communication between players, both offline and [[Online game|online]]. A single village can house up to four human players, though only one can be exploring the village at any given time.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\">{{cite web| title=Animal Crossing Preview |last=Schneider |first=Peer |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/30/animal-crossing |date=May 30, 2002 |publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> The players can interact via written messages through the village post office or bulletin board.

Gameplay is [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]]: players have no defined objectives, but are instead encouraged to spend their time in the village performing any number of activities, which include collecting items, planting plants or other items, and socializing with the village's residents. ''Animal Crossing'' games are played in [[Real time (media)|real time]], utilizing the [[video game console]]'s internal clock and calendar. Thus, passage of time in the game world reflects that in reality, as well as the current season and time of day. Some in-game events, such as holidays or the growth of a tree, occur at certain times or require some duration of time to have passed.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\"/>\n\nOne notable feature of the ''Animal Crossing'' series is the high level of customization available, some of which affects the outcome of the game.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\" /> The [[player character]] is both named and gendered by the real life player at the start of the game, and their appearance can be modified by buying or designing custom clothes and accessories or changing the hairstyle (introduced in ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World|Wild World]]''). The player's house can also be furnished, decorated, and later expanded: the player can purchase and collect furniture and place it anywhere in the house, as well as change both the wallpaper and floor designs. While its terrain, building locations, and initial residents are randomly generated when the game is first begun (except in ''Animal Crossing: New Leaf'', in which the player decides between four given towns, and ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'', in which the player similarly decides between four given islands), the village's name and anthem, as well as some of the residents' catchphrases, are also determined by the player.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\"/>\n\nCollecting items is a major facet of ''Animal Crossing'': the player can explore the village and gather objects, including fruit from trees, seashells, and discarded items. Nearly all objects can be sold for Bells, the in-game currency. Players collect objects to obtain more Bells, which can then be used to buy furniture and clothing, purchase home expansions, invest in stocks, and play games. A number of specialized tools are available for other activities such as fishing and insect collecting. Special items, such as fossils and paintings, may be donated to the village museum. The player can choose to socialize with the other animal residents by engaging in conversation, sending and receiving letters, bartering, or playing hide-and-seek. Residents may move in or out of the village depending on the player's actions.\n\nAll installments of ''Animal Crossing'' allow some form of communication between players, both offline and [[Online game|online]]. A single village can house up to four human players, though only one can be exploring the village at any given time.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\">{{cite web| title=Animal Crossing Preview |last=Schneider |first=Peer |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/30/animal-crossing |date=May 30, 2002 |publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> The players can interact via written messages through the village post office or bulletin board.

He is said to have been descended from Prophet Mohammed's daughter [[Fatimah]]. Hence the Sheikh belonged to the [[Ashraf]] or [[Sayyid|Sada]], titles given to the descendants of the prophet. He married two local women in Somalia that left him eight sons, one of them being Abdirahman (Awal). The descendants of those eight sons are the what is known as Isaaq clan today.\n\nThe grave of Zubeyr Awal, the eponymous ancestor of the Habr Awal subclan of the [[Isaaq]], is located in Jidali in [[Sanaag]] which is about 100&nbsp;km east of the tomb of his grandfather Sheikh Ishaaq Bin Ahmed, the founding father of the [[Isaaq]] clan, whose tomb is located in the coastal town of [[Maydh]].\n\n===Medieval Period (Conquest of Abbysinia)===\n\nHistorically the Habr Awal were part of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and are mentioned in the renowned \"Futuh Al-Habash\" for their major contributions in the [[Abyssinian-Adal war]] as the Habr Magaadle along with the [[Garhajis]], Arap and Ayub clans against the [[Abyssinian empire]], and also for producing a historical figure known as Ahmad Girri bin Husain who was the righthand partner of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] and a chieftain for the Habr Magaadle forces during the Abyssinian\u2013Adal war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://makhtota.ksu.edu.sa/makhtota/554/16|title=\u0645\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0637\u0627\u062a > \u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 > \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0631\u0642\u0645 16|website=makhtota.ksu.edu.sa|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Early Modern Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal have a rich mercantile history largely due to their possession of the major Somali port of [[Berbera]], which was the chief port and settlement of Habr Awal clan during the early modern period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reerahmednuux.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/piece-of-berbera-history-reer-ahmed-nuh-ismail/ |title=Piece of Berbera History: Reer Ahmed Nuh Ismail |website=wordpress.com|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Habr Awal as a whole are a rich people, mainly thanks to the trade passing though the port of Berbera which lies in the territory of the Sa\u2019ad Musa.<ref>{{cite book|title= Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Volume 5 |date=1969|pages=24|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Berbera Mosque Engraving.jpg|thumb|350px|Engraving of Berbera, including a Mosque and fort]]\nThe Habr Awal merchants had extensive trade relations with Arab and Indian merchants from [[Arabia]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]] respectively. When these foreign traders arrived in [[Berbera]] and [[Bulhar]] to conduct trade, there was a mutually beneficial arrangement based on the abban (protection) system between them and the local Reer Yunis Nuh and Ahmed Nuh lineages of Sa\u2019ad Musa, Habr Awal:\n\n<blockquote>Before this, and prior to the British settlement at Aden in 1839, the Ayyal Yunis and Ayyal Ahmed lineages of the Habr Awal clan had held Berbera and jointly managed its trade, sharing in the profits on all commercial transactions as \u2018protectors\u2019 (abans) of foreign merchants from Arabia and India. When under the stimulus of developments at Aden the port\u2019s prosperity markedly increased, the numerically dominant Ayyal Yunis drove out their rival kinsmen and declared themselves commercial masters of Berbera. This led to a feud in which each side sought outside help; the defeated Ayyal Ahmed turned to Haji Shirmarke \u2018Ali and his Habr Yunis clansmen for support. With this backing, they were then able to re-establish themselves and to expel the Ayyal Yunis who moved to the small roadstead of Bulhar, some miles to the west of Berbera.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.M.|title= The Modern History of Somaliland: from Nation to State |date=1965|publisher=Praeger|pages=35|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNot only did the Habr Awal host foreign merchants at their ports, they also conducted trade missions on their own vessels to the Arabian ports<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prichard|first1=J. C.|title= Researches Into the Physical History of Mankind: Ethnography of the African races.|date=1837|publisher= Sherwood, Gilbert & Piper|pages=160|language=english}}</ref>. The majority of the Somali merchants who frequented Aden and other Southern Arabian ports hailed from the Habr Awal clan. They procured various raw goods from Harar and the interior in exchange for manufactured goods. During their stay, the Habr Awal rented their own houses and hired their own servants, whereas other Somali clans tended to stay with relatives already established across the Gulf. \n\n<blockquote>Merchants. \u2014 These are generally members of the Habr Awal tribe. They bring from Harrar and the Galla country, coffee, saffron (bastard), tusks (ivory), and feathers, taking away in return zinc, brass, broad cloth, and piece goods. They remain in Aden for about twenty days at a time during the trading season, which lasts about nine months,' making four trips. During their residence they hire a house, and are accompanied by their own domestics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Frederick|title=An Account of the British Settlement of Aden in Arabia|date=1877|publisher=Cengage Gale|pages=41|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the interior, Habr Awal trade caravans (khafilas) were a frequent sight according to contemporary European accounts of the Somali Peninsula:\n\n<blockquote>On leaving Hargeisa we travelled for many miles through beautiful park-like land, alive with birds and jungle fowl. We met the usual Somali khafilas [trading caravans] of Habr-Awal men, carrying their skins, gums, ghee, and coffee to our port at Bulhar, situated between Berbera and Zeila.<ref>'Twixt sirdar & Menelik: an account of a year's expedition from Zeila to Cairo, p. 18, 1901</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Somalis from the deep interior, principally those from the [[Ogaden (clan)|Ogaden]], also gained most of their resources from the Habr Awal merchants who they called \"iidoor\", an enviable pejorative meaning [[merchant]] or trader, a reference to the mercantile nature of the Habr Awal traders at the time.<ref name=\"Info\">Somali Poetry, Lewis & Adrzejewski, 1964, pp. 111\u2013115</ref> The coastal Habr Awal (mainly the Reer Ahmed Nuh) regularly acted as brokers/middlemen for the Somali clans of the interior who wished to take their goods to the ports of Berbera and Bulhar:\n\n<blockquote>The custom is for the Ayal Achmet (Berbera tribe) to act as brokers, and too often most of the profits stick to the hands of the middleman. Till lately no Ogadayn ever went to the coast, but entrusted the goods to coast traders.<ref>{{cite book|title= The Dublin Review, Volume 98|date=1886|pages=176|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===British Protectorate Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal clan came under the [[British Protectorate]] by signing a treaty with the [[British Empire]] on 14 July 1884. The Habr Awal continued to have a lucrative trading agreement with their foreign contacts, many of whom were also under British rule in their respective nations.

The SNM at 1981 founding in [[London]] it elected [[Ahmed Mohamed Gulaid]] from the Habr Awal clan as its first chairman, who stated that the group's explicit purpose was to overthrow the [[Siad Barre]] [[military regime]].<ref name=\"Metz\">Helen Chapin Metz, ''Somalia: a country study'', Volume 550, Issues 86-993, (The Division: 1993), p.xxviii.</ref> The SNM gathered its main base of support from members of the Isaaq clan, who formed and supported the movement in response to years of systematic discrimination by the Siad Barre government.\n\nMembers of the Habr Awal clan made up a significant portion of leaders and soldiers of the SNM.

When these foreign traders arrived in [[Berbera]] and [[Bulhar]] to conduct trade, there was a mutually beneficial arrangement based on the abban (protection) system between them and the local Reer Yunis Nuh and Ahmed Nuh lineages of Sa\u2019ad Musa, Habr Awal:\n\n<blockquote>Before this, and prior to the British settlement at Aden in 1839, the Ayyal Yunis and Ayyal Ahmed lineages of the Habr Awal clan had held Berbera and jointly managed its trade, sharing in the profits on all commercial transactions as \u2018protectors\u2019 (abans) of foreign merchants from Arabia and India. When under the stimulus of developments at Aden the port\u2019s prosperity markedly increased, the numerically dominant Ayyal Yunis drove out their rival kinsmen and declared themselves commercial masters of Berbera. This led to a feud in which each side sought outside help; the defeated Ayyal Ahmed turned to Haji Shirmarke \u2018Ali and his Habr Yunis clansmen for support. With this backing, they were then able to re-establish themselves and to expel the Ayyal Yunis who moved to the small roadstead of Bulhar, some miles to the west of Berbera.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.M.|title= The Modern History of Somaliland: from Nation to State |date=1965|publisher=Praeger|pages=35|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNot only did the Habr Awal host foreign merchants at their ports, they also conducted trade missions on their own vessels to the Arabian ports<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prichard|first1=J.

The majority of the Somali merchants who frequented Aden and other Southern Arabian ports hailed from the Habr Awal clan. They procured various raw goods from Harar and the interior in exchange for manufactured goods. During their stay, the Habr Awal rented their own houses and hired their own servants, whereas other Somali clans tended to stay with relatives already established across the Gulf. \n\n<blockquote>Merchants. \u2014 These are generally members of the Habr Awal tribe. They bring from Harrar and the Galla country, coffee, saffron (bastard), tusks (ivory), and feathers, taking away in return zinc, brass, broad cloth, and piece goods. They remain in Aden for about twenty days at a time during the trading season, which lasts about nine months,' making four trips.

As each senior person died, the others would move up a step.\n\nThe head of the school generally used the ''g\u014d'' (and signed his prints) as ''Toyokuni''. When [[Kunisada I]] proclaimed himself head of the school (c. 1842), he started signing as ''Toyokuni'', and the next most senior member, [[Kochoro]] (a name also previously used by Kunisada I, but not as his chief ''g\u014d''), started signing as ''Kunisada'' (Kunisada II, in this case).\n\nThe next most senior member after him, in turn, began signing as ''Kunimasa'' (Kunimasa IV, in this case), which had been Kochoro's ''g\u014d'' before he became Kunisada II. (The original [[Kunimasa|Kunimasa I]] had been a student of Toyokuni I.)\n\nFollowing is a list of some members of the main Utagawa school, giving the succession of names, along with the modern numbering of each:\n\n* Toyokuni (I)\n* Toyoshige -> Toyokuni (II)\n* Kunisada (I) -> Toyokuni (III)\n* Kochoro -> Kunimasa (III) -> Kunisada (II) -> Toyokuni (IV)\n* Kochoro (II) -> Kunimasa (IV) -> Kunisada (III) -> Toyokuni (V)\n\nSee [[List of Utagawa school members|here]] for a more extensive list.\n\n==Two different Toyokuni IIs==\n\nAn additional complexity is the fact that there are two different artists who are sometimes referred to as ''Toyokuni II''; and similarly for the later-numbered artists called \"Toyokuni\".\n\nThe first Toyokuni II was [[Toyoshige]], a mediocre pupil and son-in-law of Toyokuni I who became head of the Utagawa school after Toyokuni I died.\n\nKunisada I (Toyokuni III) apparently despised Toyoshige, and refused to acknowledge him as head of the Utagawa school. Apparently, this was because he felt that as the best pupil, he should have been named head after the old master died, and was upset with Toyoshige, who apparently got the position because of his family connection.\n\nWhen Kunisada I took the art-name Toyokuni (c. 1842), he effectively removed Toyokuni II from house history and for a period actually signed as ''Toyokuni II''. However, he is now numbered, Toyokuni III. There are prints which signed ''Toyokuni II'' which are by the artist now known as Toyokuni III.\n\nThis numbering persisted, so when Kochoro became head of the Utagawa school, he signed as ''Toyokuni III'', although he would be the fourth Toyokuni. Likewise Kochoro II eventually signed as ''Toyokuni IV'', and is now numbered Toyokuni V.\n\n<br />\n\n== Family ==\nAccording to the encyclopedia of Ukiyo-e in the late 1980s, the Utagawa school had 151 students,147 workers from Kuniyoshi, and 173 people from Kuniyoshi. Students who studied at the Utagawa school would gain the chance to receive the Utagawa name if their skill is approved. The master would give out the Utagawa surname, and the use of \u201cToshinomaru\u201d, which is Utagawa's own family crest that is only found within the Utagawa family to the best students.

Their name means ''People's Elephant'' in [[Igbo language]] and is also the nickname used for the city of Aba. Founded in 1976, the club rose to prominence in the 2000s and is considered the most successful Nigerian football club as they won two [[CAF Champions League|African Champions League]] titles, eight Nigerian championships and four [[Nigerian FA Cup|Federation Cup]]s since 2001.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nThe club was founded as a state-owned club in November 1976 by Jerry Amadi Enyeazu who was the first Director for Sports in the newly established [[Imo State]], a province in southeast Nigeria. In August 1991 Imo State was divided further and the [[Abia State]] was created from the part of Imo which included the city of Aba, Enyimba's hometown, so the new state's government took over as owners of Enyimba.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s Enyimba struggled to make a notable impact as the traditional powerhouses such as [[Enugu Rangers]], [[Shooting Stars SC|Shooting Stars]], [[Bendel Insurance F.C.|Bendel Insurance]] and local rivals [[Heartland F.C.|Iwuanyanwu Nationale]] dominated Nigerian football. Enyimba's rise to fame began in 1990 when the Professional League was inaugurated.\n\nIn their first season in the top division Enyimba finished 13th out of 16 clubs, winning just five out of 30 games with a goal difference 25\u201336. In the following season they won eight games but still finished 15th with 36 points, just one point short from escaping relegation behind [[Stationery Stores F.C.|Stationery Stores]], and were relegated to second level for the 1992 season. Enyimba then stayed in the [[Nigeria National League|second level]] for the next two seasons before winning promotion in 1993, finishing first with 29 wins out of 46 games, winning a record 96 points with a goal difference 64\u201325, with most goals scored and fewest goals conceded in the 24-team league.\n\nBack in top level, their string of good results continued, and they finished the 1994 season third, behind [[BCC Lions FC|BCC Lions]] and [[Shooting Stars SC|Shooting Stars]], missing out on a spot in the 1995 [[CAF Cup]] on goal difference. After a mediocre 1995 season, they won fourth place in 1996, before a series of inconsistent results saw them narrowly escaping relegation on goal difference in 1997 and finishing seventh in 1998.\n\n==Home ground==\nEnyimba currently uses the [[Enyimba International Stadium]] located in the city of [[Aba, Abia|Aba]] in [[Abia State]]. The stadium was renovated in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/g00/en-ng/news/enyimba-return-to-aba-stadium-after-renovations/ld40uhidib5e1j8qmrs6qdudk?i10c.ua=1&i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8=&i10c.dv=12|title=Enyimba return to Aba Stadium after completed renovations {{!}} Goal.com|website=www.goal.com|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref>\n\n===Rise to prominence===\nEnyimba's fortunes began to change in 1999 when [[Orji Uzor Kalu]] was elected [[List of Governors of Abia State|Governor of Abia State]] in the first democratic elections held in the country after several years of military rule. Kalu then proceeded to ensure generous funding for the local team and appointed Felix Anyansi Agwu as the new chairman of the club, who in turn appointed Godwin Koko Uwa as the club's first coach in the new era.\n\nThe appointment soon returned results, with Uwa leading Enyimba to their first Nigerian championship title in the 2001 season, as well as winning the Nigerian Super Cup in October 2001 by beating [[Dolphins F.C. (Port Harcourt)|Dolphins]] 2\u20130 in [[Maiduguri]]. Their first silverware marked the beginning of a period of Enyimba's dominance in Nigerian football.\n\nThe ''People's Elephant'' experienced international football for the first time in August 2001, when they were invited to play [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] at [[San Siro]] in a charity friendly which marked the return of [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] after a 21-month injury layoff and saw Enyimba thrashed 7\u20130 with four goals from [[Christian Vieri]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Ronaldo returns as Inter thrash Enyimba |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/1499571.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=19 August 2001 |accessdate=21 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nThey also had their first appearance in a continental competition in the [[2002 CAF Champions League]]. Due to the lack of a good playing pitch at their base in Aba, the club played their home matches in [[Calabar]], a neighbouring town and the capital of the [[Cross River State]]. After winning the first round tie against [[\u00c9toile Filante de Ouagadougou|\u00c9toile Filante]] 5\u20133 on aggregate, they were knocked out in the second round by the 1998 Champions [[ASEC Mimosas]] of [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]].\n\nThe defeat proved to be another turning point in the history of the club as it was the main cause for the club's rebuilding of what used to be a substandard playing pitch into the [[Enyimba International Stadium]], a 15,000 capacity stadium equipped with floodlights, electronic scoreboard and covered seats, which was later inspected by the CAF president [[Issa Hayatou]] and was officially approved for that year's CAF Champions League matches.\n\nThe club went on to win their second successive league title in 2002, and then became the first Nigerian club to win the continent's premier international club competition in the [[2003 CAF Champions League]] by beating [[Ismaily SC|Ismaily]] of [[Egypt]] 2\u20131 on aggregate, under coach [[Kadiri Ikhana]]. This was also the first time since [[1996 African Cup of Champions Clubs|1996]] that a Nigerian club had reached the final of the competition. Several key players from Enyimba's 2003 continental success have since gone on to play for [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] ([[Vincent Enyeama]], [[Obinna Nwaneri]] and [[Onyekachi Okonkwo]]) and Benin Republic National Team ([[Mouritala Ogunbiyi|Muri Ogunbiyi]])\n\nEnyimba then successfully defended their title as won their second consecutive African Champions League title in [[2004 CAF Champions League|2004]], beating [[Tunisia]]'s [[\u00c9toile Sportive du Sahel|\u00c9toile du Sahel]] in the finals. After finishing runners-up in the national championship in 2004 (behind [[Dolphins F.C. (Port Harcourt)|Dolphins]]), Enyimba won the [[Double (association football)|Double]] in 2005, winning their fourth Nigerian championship and their first [[Nigerian FA Cup|Nigerian Cup]].\n\n===2003\u20132008: Awards===\nIn [[Enyimba International F.C. season 2003|2003]], Enyimba won the best team in Africa award while coach Kadiri emerged the best coach. In 2004, the club retained the best coach award while the club's first choice goalkeeper, [[Vincent Enyeama]] won the Champions league player of the year.\n\nThese two Champions league victories in the hands of West African teams, plus the second [[CAF Super Cup]] against [[Accra Hearts of Oak SC|Accra Hearts of Oak]] finally brought Enyimba to the limelight of African football. The team signed a $300,000 uniform deal with [[Joma]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.supersport.com/football/nigeria/news/130411/NPFL_clubs_go_stylish |title=NPFL clubs go stylish |first=Ojeikere |last=Aikhoje |publisher=SuperSport |date=12 April 2013 |accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===2008\u201309 season===\nThe team finished third in the Premier League with 64 points. On 12 July, Enyimba defeated Sharks FC by a lone goal at the [[Teslim Balogun Stadium]] to lift the 2009 Federation Cup and qualified for the [[CAF Confederation Cup 2010]].\n\n===2012\u201313 season===\nThe team was on course to reclaim the League title from Kano Pillars but crowd trouble forced the match to be abandoned. A rearranged match on 9 October 2013 in Lokoja saw them lose to Pillars who eventually won the league with 63 points while Enyimba finished with 62 points.\n\nEnyimba would however go on to win the [[Nigerian FA Cup]] that year where they faced [[Warri Wolves F.C.|Warri Wolves]] in the finals. The match ended 2\u20132 and 5\u20134 on penalties.\n\n===2013\u201314 season===\nThe 2013\u201314 season started in abysmal form for the People's Elephants. They were knocked out of the [[CAF Champions League]] by [[AS Real Bamako|Real Bamako]] and they had a stuttering start to their own campaign. They ended the first half of the season in 6th place after [[Giwa FC]] who were led by Enyimba's Champions League winning coach [[Kadiri Ikhana]] held them to a goalless draw in Aba. They made a move for Ikhana at the start of the second half, firing the then technical adviser, Zachary Baraje.\n\nThe team eventually finished second in that Premier League season with 64 points. They finished behind [[Kano Pillars F.C.|Kano Pillars]] who they beat 3\u20131 on the last day of the season. It was a campaign that saw them win just 1 out of their 6 Oriental Derbies, the only win being a 2\u20131 home win to Rangers International. State Rivals Abia Warriors beat them 1\u20130 in Aba, Cletus Itodo getting the decisive goal. They also dropped points in Aba to Giwa FC and [[Heartland F.C.|Heartland]] of Owerri.\n\nEnyimba striker [[Mfon Udoh]] set a new goal scoring record of the season, scoring 23 goals. Emem Eduok of [[Dolphins F.C. (Port Harcourt)|Dolphins]] finished behind him with 21 goals both beating [[Jude Aneke]]'s record of 20 goals.\n\nThe season ended on a high like the previous season as Enyimba won the 2014 Edition of the Federations Cup at the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos on 23 November 2014, beating [[Dolphins F.C. (Port Harcourt)|Dolphins]] 2\u20131 in the finals. [[Mfon Udoh]] scored Enyimba's first while Chinonso Okonkwo got the second. Emem Eduok pulled one back for [[Dolphins F.C. (Port Harcourt)|Dolphins]].\n\n===2016 season===\nThe 2016 season was not so favorable for People's Elephants as end the season being ninth on the league with 50 points.\n\n===2017 season===\nEnyimba finished third in the league with 61 points. The third position saw Enyimba qualify to represent [[Nigeria]] at the [[CAF Confederations Cup]] the following season. <ref> {{Cite

Their first silverware marked the beginning of a period of Enyimba's dominance in Nigerian football.\n\nThe ''People's Elephant'' experienced international football for the first time in August 2001, when they were invited to play [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] at [[San Siro]] in a charity friendly which marked the return of [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] after a 21-month injury layoff and saw Enyimba thrashed 7\u20130 with four goals from [[Christian Vieri]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Ronaldo returns as Inter thrash Enyimba |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/1499571.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=19 August 2001 |accessdate=21 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nThey also had their first appearance in a continental competition in the [[2002 CAF Champions League]]. Due to the lack of a good playing pitch at their base in Aba, the club played their home matches in [[Calabar]], a neighbouring town and the capital of the [[Cross River State]]. After winning the first round tie against [[\u00c9toile Filante de Ouagadougou|\u00c9toile Filante]] 5\u20133 on aggregate, they were knocked out in the second round by the 1998 Champions [[ASEC Mimosas]] of [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]].\n\nThe defeat proved to be another turning point in the history of the club as it was the main cause for the club's rebuilding of what used to be a substandard playing pitch into the [[Enyimba International Stadium]], a 15,000 capacity stadium equipped with floodlights, electronic scoreboard and covered seats, which was later inspected by the CAF president [[Issa Hayatou]] and was officially approved for that year's CAF Champions League matches.\n\nThe club went on to win their second successive league title in 2002, and then became the first Nigerian club to win the continent's premier international club competition in the [[2003 CAF Champions League]] by beating [[Ismaily SC|Ismaily]] of [[Egypt]] 2\u20131 on aggregate, under coach [[Kadiri Ikhana]]. This was also the first time since [[1996 African Cup of Champions Clubs|1996]] that a Nigerian club had reached the final of the competition. Several key players from Enyimba's 2003 continental success have since gone on to play for [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] ([[Vincent Enyeama]], [[Obinna Nwaneri]] and [[Onyekachi Okonkwo]]) and Benin Republic National Team ([[Mouritala Ogunbiyi|Muri Ogunbiyi]])\n\nEnyimba then successfully defended their title as won their second consecutive African Champions League title in [[2004 CAF Champions League|2004]], beating [[Tunisia]]'s [[\u00c9toile Sportive du Sahel|\u00c9toile du Sahel]] in the finals. After finishing runners-up in the national championship in 2004 (behind [[Dolphins F.C. (Port Harcourt)|Dolphins]]), Enyimba won the [[Double (association football)|Double]] in 2005, winning their fourth Nigerian championship and their first [[Nigerian FA Cup|Nigerian Cup]].\n\n===2003\u20132008: Awards===\nIn [[Enyimba International F.C. season 2003|2003]], Enyimba won the best team in Africa award while coach Kadiri emerged the best coach. In 2004, the club retained the best coach award while the club's first choice goalkeeper, [[Vincent Enyeama]] won the Champions league player of the year.\n\nThese two Champions league victories in the hands of West African teams, plus the second [[CAF Super Cup]] against [[Accra Hearts of Oak SC|Accra Hearts of Oak]] finally brought Enyimba to the limelight of African football. The team signed a $300,000 uniform deal with [[Joma]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.supersport.com/football/nigeria/news/130411/NPFL_clubs_go_stylish |title=NPFL clubs go stylish |first=Ojeikere |last=Aikhoje |publisher=SuperSport |date=12 April 2013 |accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===2008\u201309 season===\nThe team finished third in the Premier League with 64 points. On 12 July, Enyimba defeated Sharks FC by a lone goal at the [[Teslim Balogun Stadium]] to lift the 2009 Federation Cup and qualified for the [[CAF Confederation Cup 2010]].\n\n===2012\u201313 season===\nThe team was on course to reclaim the League title from Kano Pillars but crowd trouble forced the match to be abandoned. A rearranged match on 9 October 2013 in Lokoja saw them lose to Pillars who eventually won the league with 63 points while Enyimba finished with 62 points.\n\nEnyimba would however go on to win the [[Nigerian FA Cup]] that year where they faced [[Warri Wolves F.C.|Warri Wolves]] in the finals. The match ended 2\u20132 and 5\u20134 on penalties.\n\n===2013\u201314 season===\nThe 2013\u201314 season started in abysmal form for the People's Elephants. They were knocked out of the [[CAF Champions League]] by [[AS Real Bamako|Real Bamako]] and they had a stuttering start to their own campaign. They ended the first half of the season in 6th place after [[Giwa FC]] who were led by Enyimba's Champions League winning coach [[Kadiri Ikhana]] held them to a goalless draw in Aba. They made a move for Ikhana at the start of the second half, firing the then technical adviser, Zachary Baraje.\n\nThe team eventually finished second in that Premier League season with 64 points. They finished behind [[Kano Pillars F.C.|Kano Pillars]] who they beat 3\u20131 on the last day of the season. It was a campaign that saw them win just 1 out of their 6 Oriental Derbies, the only win being a 2\u20131 home win to Rangers International. State Rivals Abia Warriors beat them 1\u20130 in Aba, Cletus Itodo getting the decisive goal. They also dropped points in Aba to Giwa FC and [[Heartland F.C.|Heartland]] of Owerri.\n\nEnyimba striker [[Mfon Udoh]] set a new goal scoring record of the season, scoring 23 goals. Emem Eduok of [[Dolphins F.C. (Port Harcourt)|Dolphins]] finished behind him with 21 goals both beating [[Jude Aneke]]'s record of 20 goals.\n\nThe season ended on a high like the previous season as Enyimba won the 2014 Edition of the Federations Cup at the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos on 23 November 2014, beating [[Dolphins F.C. (Port Harcourt)|Dolphins]] 2\u20131 in the finals. [[Mfon Udoh]] scored Enyimba's first while Chinonso Okonkwo got the second. Emem Eduok pulled one back for [[Dolphins F.C. (Port Harcourt)|Dolphins]].\n\n===2016 season===\nThe 2016 season was not so favorable for People's Elephants as end the season being ninth on the league with 50 points.\n\n===2017 season===\nEnyimba finished third in the league with 61 points. The third position saw Enyimba qualify to represent [[Nigeria]] at the [[CAF Confederations Cup]] the following season. <ref> {{Cite
