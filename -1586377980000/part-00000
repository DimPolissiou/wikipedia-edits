Dinakrushna Dasa is an outstanding Oriya poet of the medieval Oriya literature. Not many details about him are available. He was born in Jaleswar in the State of Orissa and was contemporary of Mukunda Deva (1651\u20131686 A.D.) and Divyasingha Deva (1686\u20131713 A.D.) the then kings of Orissa. A major part of his life was spent in Puri. His mastery over varied subjects like Sanskrit poetics, grammar, astrology, classical medicine etc., made him a figure of eminence. But his domestic life was fraught with continued poverty and ailments. The ruler of Orissa, the then king of Puri, promised him many allurements provided he wrote a panegyric in the king's honour. The poet rejected all such offers and remained resolute in glorifying only Jagannatha through his writings. It is said that he was inflicted with the leprosy and yet he used to visit the Puri temple of Jagannath and sing his devotional songs in a most moving voice everyday. Last of time he lives at ekagharia ,Dhenkanal near Bramhni rives .At his death place a Jagannath temple constructed on name Sarana Srikhetra .\n \nDinakrushna has about 15 poems to his credit, among which the most famous one is Rasakollola. Rasa Binoda, Guna Sagar, Bhaba Samudra, Amruta Sagar, Tattva Sagar, Bhuta Keli, Alankora Bali and Naba Keli are some of his notable creations. He earned a great reputation in writing Chautisa and other lyrical poems about Radha and Krushna. The most recurrent themes of his writings are the glorification and the portrayal of the divine drama of deities he worshipped, viz, Jagannath, Radha and Krishna.\n\nRasakallola has a distinct place in Oriya literature for its sheer poetic excellence and mellifluousness. It deals with the amours of Krushna with the maidens of Vraja and consists of 34 melodious cantos and each line of the cantos beings with the initial sound \u2018 Ka\u2019, the first consonant in sanscrit and oriya language. The cantos are again musically conditioned according to the Ragas and Raginis (tunes) prevalent in Orissa. Dinakrushna has shown great skill in painting the natural cycle of seasons and seasonal amours and romantic adventures associated with the seasons. Centering round the drama of Radha and Krushna, Dinakrushna has written many songs overflowing with a sort of mystically human and divine love.\n\n== References ==\n{{Wikisourcelang|or|\u0b30\u0b38\u0b15\u0b32\u0b4d\u0b32\u0b4b\u0b33|Rasakallola}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|author=Surendra Mahanty|title=Dinakrushna Das|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bG4uAAAAMAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Sahitya Akademi}}\n\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Das, Dinakrushna}}\n[[Category:Indian male poets]]\n[[Category:17th-century Indian poets]]\n[[Category:Odia-language poets]]\n[[Category:People from Balasore district]]\n[[Category:Bhakti movement]]\n[[Category:1650 births]]\n[[Category:1710 deaths]]\n[[Category:Poets from Odisha]]\n[[Category:17th-century male writers]]\n\n\n{{india-poet-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n'''Dinakrushna Das''' (1650 - 1710) was a famous poet of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] (in modern India), belonging to the [[Vaishnava]] tradition of [[bhakti movement]].

Duggan was married to Evelyn Kavanagh and together they had one son.\n\nAs a keen supporter of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], Duggan fought in the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]; however, following its failure he was subject to [[court-martial]], and was sentenced to three years' penal servitude. Under the general amnesty of 1917 he was released after 14 months in prison, and returned to Dublin where he went back to studying law.

Duggans efforts to get medical assistance were unsuccessful at Richmond hospital as the British officer who responded to the call declined the message and didn't allow it to go through. Eventually medical assistance was received but it was too late for Allen. In Duggan's region, the volunteers suffered very few injuries with the most violent fighting taking place on Friday night and Saturday morning.\n\nDuggan suffered the consequences and was then sentenced to penal servitude which lasted three years. He was interned in Maidstone, Portland and Lewes prisons.

Most of Duggan's papers consisted of letters to his fianc\u00e9e and later wife, May Duggan, which he wrote while he was in prison. Duggan's papers were very personal as they consisted of photographs of him, his family members and his political associates etc. Also information of his time as a [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] was included. In one of his letters, which Duggan wrote on 25 April 1916, he referenced 'the whole damn family' consisting of information as to  how his volunteers and he were being 'treated as princes' by the nuns in the convent nearby, receiving help from the children in the area and building barricades. In his letter, Duggan also writes about morale amongst his comrades and hearing rumours about a German who had landed in [[County Kerry]]. News had emerged of Sean Connolly's death and that the British Army were unfair in concluding the rebellion. In Duggan's note, he proclaims that the letter should be sent to May Duggan who was his fianc\u00e9e at the time.

Duggans efforts to get medical assistance were unsuccessful at Richmond hospital as the British officer who responded to the call declined the message and didn't allow it to go through. Eventually medical assistance was received but it was too late for Allen. In Duggan's region, the volunteers suffered very few injuries with the most violent fighting taking place on Friday night and Saturday morning.\n\nDuggan suffered the consequences and was then sentenced to penal servitude which lasted three years. He was interned in Maidstone, Portland and Lewes prisons.

Most of Duggan's papers consisted of letters to his fiancee and later wife, May Duggan, which he wrote while he was in prison. Duggan's papers were very personal as they consisted of photographs of him, his family members and his political associates etc. Also information of his time as a [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] was included. In one of his letters, which Duggan wrote on 25 April 1916, he referenced 'the whole damn family' consisting of information as to  how his volunteers and he were being 'treated as princes' by the nuns in the convent nearby, receiving help from the children in the area and building barricades. In his letter, Duggan also writes about morale amongst his comrades and hearing rumours about a German who had landed in [[County Kerry]]. News had emerged of Sean Connolly's death and that the British Army were unfair in concluding the rebellion. In Duggan's note, he proclaims that the letter should be sent to May Duggan who was his fiancee at the time.

Among those killed was Texas state representative Joseph Lockridge, the first black man to represent Dallas County in the Texas Legislature.

Once they arrived in Houston, there was no record of the crew being briefed about the updated weather by any Weather Bureau or [[Federal Aviation Administration]] personnel, or by any Braniff dispatcher or weather office.

As the crew attempted to recover from the ensuing steep diving turn, the aircraft experienced acceleration forces of over 4 [[g-force|''g'']], which caused the right wing to fail.

It was carrying 5 crew and 80 passengers; there were no survivors. Among those killed was Texas state representative Joseph Lockridge, the first black man to represent Dallas County in the Texas Legislature. Investigation revealed that the accident was caused by the captain's decision to penetrate an area of heavy weather followed by a structural over-stress and failure of the airframe while attempting recovery from loss of control during a steep 180-degree turn executed in an attempt to escape the weather.<ref name=asn>{{ASN accident|id=19680503-0}}.

On that previous flight, a few hours before, they encountered no significant weather along the route. Once they arrived in Houston, there was no record of the crew being briefed about the updated weather by any Weather Bureau or [[Federal Aviation Administration]] personnel, or by any Braniff dispatcher or weather office. They did, however, receive hardcopy information about all relevant en route and terminal weather reports and forecasts.<ref name=ntsb/>\n\nAt 16:11, the crew departed [[William P.

He was a suitable candidate in that he was remembered as one of the organisers of the 1914 meeting against Home Rule, he had been a well known trade unionist, he was a member of the Orange Order and he was a Mason.\nThe NW of Wednesday 27 November 1918<ref>Northern Whig, Belfast: 27 November 1918</ref> featured in its Editorial the selection of Sir Edward Carson as the Parliamentary candidate for  Duncairn in the forthcoming  election. There were 1\u00bd columns recounting his career and his seven years of leadership of the Ulster cause.\nThe NW of Saturday 30 November 1918<ref>Northern Whig, Belfast: 30 November 1918</ref> reported on electioneering in the Victoria Ward and Mr Thompson Donald's Candidature and the Meeting of Support held in the Sailor's Institute, Dock St.  \u2018Mr Donald, who was enthusiastically received\u2026..said he had the support of Sir Edward Carson.    He had been a teetotaller all his life and was in favour of prohibition\u2026..There was a need for better schools\u2026..He was out to get 10,000 comfortable workers\u2019 houses built in Belfast\u2019.    \nThe NW of Monday 2 December 1918<ref>\tNorthern Whig, Belfast: 2 December 1918</ref> gave notice of \u2018A Public Meeting of the Electors in support of Mr Thompson Donald to be held in the Old Town Hall on Friday at 8 o\u2019clock.   The Rt Hon Sir Edward Carson will be in attendance.   The Candidate will address the Meeting.\u2019  On 7 December<ref>Northern Whig, Belfast: 7 December 1918</ref> the NW carried a 3\u00bd column report largely relating to the speech Sir Edward Carson made in support of Mr Thompson Donald as a true Unionist candidate in the forthcoming election. \u2018A number of questions were then put to the candidate by members of the audience, and were answered satisfactorily, the vote of confidence being passed unanimously\u2019.\nThe NW of Saturday 14 December 1918<ref>Northern Whig, Belfast: 14 December 1918</ref> had a large advertisement addressed to the \u2018Loyal Unionists of Belfast.   Keep the Old Flag Flying. The (seven) Constitutionally Selected Candidates are\u2026Carson \u2013 Duncairn\u2026..Donald \u2013 Victoria\u2026..Whitla \u2013 Belfast University.   Vote for us and no other.     No Surrender!     Edward Carson\u2019.\nMonday 16 December 1918 was polling day. In Victoria Ward Donald had polled 9309 votes and won comfortably againstthe Labour candidate who had 3469 votes.<ref>Northern Whig, Belfast: 30 December 1918.</ref>   Thompson Donald thus became Thompson Donald MP and would remain so until the next election in 1922.   All three UULA candidates had won and were duly admitted as Members of Parliament to the Imperial Parliament at Westminster.\nAt Westminster the three were submerged in the Ulster Unionist Party.  They were entertained by the Duke of Abercorn and the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava and the experience allegedly went to their heads.   They were unable to live in London on their annual salaries of \u00a3400 and had to be assisted by the UUC.<ref>\u2018Memo of a conversation with Sir Wilson Hungerford\u2019, Document PRB 987, PRONI</ref>  As backbenchers their only role was to ask questions in the House. (It was agreed that Thompson Donald was the most active, but the presence of all three at Westminster dropped off after 1921 when they were elected to the first Northern Ireland Parliament).\nHowever the BN on Monday 6 October 1919 reported <ref>Belfast Newsletter; 6 October 1919</ref> on a Labour Unionist meeting held in Belfast.   In the absence of Carson Mr Ronald McNeill gave the major speech and paid a high tribute to the three UULA MPs in assisting the Ulster party in questions affecting labour.   Mr Thompson Donald MP said that Sinn Feiners were ousting people out of their jobs and Government should see that the demobilised soldiers got work.\nAfter the 1916 rising in Dublin and the continuing northern resistance to Home Rule the British government realised that there was not going to be a simple solution to the ongoing political problems in Ireland. In October 1919 a Cabinet committee was set up to review the Irish \u2018problem\u2019 and in February 1920 the Government of Ireland Bill was introduced at Westminster.<ref>\"Buckland\". Pages 92 - 146.</ref> It proposed two Home Rule parliaments in Ireland, one for most of the country, based in Dublin, and the other for the north, based in Belfast, with both to have strictly limited powers and continuing representation at Westminster. \nThe Ulster Unionists were now faced with having their own Parliament, which they had never sought. However, they realised that it would strengthen their position. There was then debate about the size of the North \u2013 would it include the nine counties of Ulster, a more compact six counties or the four mainly Protestant counties of Down, Londonderry, Tyrone and Antrim?   The Unionists quailed at the thought of trying to govern the 80% Catholic nationalist counties of Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal. A four county area was not economically viable so the six counties \u2013 Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone -  became Northern Ireland.  \nOn 22 July 1920 in the House of Commons Joe Devlin, the MP for West Belfast, asked questions<ref>Hansard, Westminster: 22 July 1920, columns 616 \u2013 618</ref> of the Chief Secretary for Ireland regarding recent disturbances in Harland & Wolff when all the Catholic workers had been expelled.   Thompson Donald stated \u2018this is not a question of Catholic and Protestant at all, but of Unionists and Sinn Feiners\u2026\u2026.these Protestants and Unionists were justified, in view of the fact that the Sinn Feiners were armed with revolvers, and immediately they produced revolvers the Unionists knocked them down\u2019.  The Chief Secretary ended the debate, having answered none of Joe Devlin's questions, by saying \"everything has been done before the 12th July, on the 12th, since the 12th, and now to preserve order in one of the most difficult areas in His Majesty\u2019s Dominions\".\n\n== Northern Ireland election of 1921 ==\nElections for the new 52 seat Northern Ireland Parliament were arranged for 24 May 1921 using the [[proportional representation]] system of voting for the first time. On Tuesday 3 May Carson gave his message to Ulster.<ref>Northern Whig, Belfast: 3 May 1921</ref> It was sent from his home in Eaton Place, London \u2013 \u2018Imperative need for Unity with an appeal to his supporters to apply themselves with their characteristic energy and determination to the founding of a Parliament which will be worthy of their community.\u2019 At a meeting in East Belfast Thompson Donald MP gave a short speech <ref>Northern Whig, Belfast: 4 May 1921</ref> in which he said \u2018the North would certainly have a Parliament functioning in the month of June, and he hoped the South would also have a Parliament functioning in the month of June. That was the key to the political solution of the Irish problem.\u2019\nSaturday 14 May 1921 was nomination day and 77 candidates were put forward for 52 seats.<ref>Northern Whig, Belfast: 14 May 1921</ref>  Wednesday 25 May was election day and the results were published on Friday 27 May.<ref>Northern Whig, Belfast: 27 May 1921</ref>  In East Belfast the four Unionist candidates were elected, with Thompson Donald coming third. All 40 Unionist candidates were returned. The other 12 who had been elected were either Nationalist or Sinn F\u00e9in and they refused to take their seats so it was effectively a one party Parliament. Carson was now 67 and in declining health so Sir James Craig became the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland.\n\nIn the House of Commons on 3 March 1922<ref>Hansard, Westminster: 3 March 1922, columns 739 \u2013 742</ref> the question of boundaries again arose because the Unionists were concerned that Westminster was going to nibble off bits of Tyrone, Fermanagh and Londonderry and give them to the Provisional government in Dublin.  The debate became heated and both Joe Devlin and Thompson Donald were told by the Speaker that they were out of order.  It was decided that the Parliament in NI would sort out the boundaries.\n\nFrom the records of the NI Hansards it can be seen that Thompson Donald was involved in many debates, asked many questions of ministers and it appeared that the NI Parliament was making a genuine effort to resolve problems despite the constraints imposed on them by Westminster. In this same period the South was slowly and painfully negotiating its separation from Britain.  In August 1922 Griffith died and Collins was assassinated.  Cosgrove took over and he and Craig met in London and discovered they could agree to differ. With Parliaments established in both Dublin and Belfast Ireland settled down to Partition.\nIn a debate on 26 June 1922<ref>Hansard, Northern Ireland: 22 June 1922, columns 845, 846.</ref> on the second reading of a Bill to abolish Proportional Representation (PR) as a voting system in future Northern Ireland elections Thompson Donald said that he did not like PR because it was cumbersome. However, he went on to ask  \u2018Where do the minority come in? There is no minority represented in this House. I do contend that PR gives minority representation, and I think in all fairness the minority should have representation.\u2019         \nIn 1922 Thompson Donald again ran in the Westminster elections but lost, and in the 1925 election for the NI Parliament he was also defeated.  A note in a NI Labour news-sheet in May 1925 stated \u2018If Dame Rumour is true, another of our stupid Cabinet Ministers was able to avert defeat by the sacrifices made by Thompson Donald, whose friends were appealed to vote \u20181\u2019 for Sir Dawson Bates\u2019.<ref>\"The Labour Opposition of Northern Ireland\" Vol 1 No 3, May 1925</ref>\n\nSo came to an end Donald's active participation in politics.\n\n== Later years ==\nShortly after 1925 Thompson Donald became caretaker of the Petty Sessions courts in Town Hall Street off Victoria Street in Belfast.  He subsequently lived in London for some years.  He returned to Belfast where he died of natural causes in 1957. His obituary was published in the ''Belfast Telegraph''.<ref>Belfast Telegraph: 4 March 1957</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite TIWW |article=Donald, Thompson |page=64 }}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{s-new | constituency }}\n{{s-ttl\n | title = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Belfast Victoria (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast Victoria]]\n | years = 1918\u20131922\n}}\n{{s-non|reason=Parliament abolished}}\n\n{{s-par|ni}}\n{{s-new | Parliament }}\n{{s-ttl\n | title = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Belfast East (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Belfast East]]\n | years = 1921\u20131925\n | with  = [[Herbert Dixon, 1st Baron Glentoran|Herbert Dixon]]\n | with2 = [[Dawson Bates]]\n | with3 = [[James Augustine Duff]]\n}}\n{{s-aft\n | after  = [[Herbert Dixon, 1st Baron Glentoran|Herbert Dixon]]\n | after2 = [[Dawson Bates]]\n | after3 = [[Jack Beattie]]\n | after4 = [[James Woods Gyle]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Donald, Thompson}}\n[[Category:1876 births]]\n[[Category:1957 deaths]]\n[[Category:Ulster Unionist Party members of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland]]\n[[Category:Members of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland 1921\u20131925]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Belfast constituencies (1801\u20131922)]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1918\u20131922]]\n[[Category:Members of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland for Belfast constituencies]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2015}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{primary sources|date=April 2014}}\n{{original research|date=April 2014}}\n{{POV|date=April 2014}}\n}}\n[[File:Thompson Donald.jpg|thumb|Donald in 1921]]\n'''Thompson Donald''' (1876-1957) was a [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] politician.\n\nDonald was elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] in the [[1918 Irish general election|1918 general election]] for the [[Belfast Victoria (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast Victoria constituency]] and served as MP until the constituency's abolition in 1922.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/people/mr-thompson-donald Mr Thompson Donald]</ref> Donald was elected as one of the so-called 'Labour Unionists' of the [[Ulster Unionist Labour Association]].<ref>[http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/h1918.htm The Irish Election of 1918]</ref> He was secretary of this group although as an MP for both Belfast Victoria and [[Belfast East (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Belfast East]] in the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] (1921-1925) he was effectively an [[Ulster Unionist Party]] representative.<ref>[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/stormont/biographies.html Biographies of Members of the Northern Ireland House of Commons]</ref>\n\n== Anti-Home Rule campaign ==\nDonald was born in [[Islandmagee]], [[County Antrim]].<ref>Ordnance Survey \"Memoirs of Ireland: Parishes of County Antrim III 1833, 1835, 1839-40\" Larne and Islandmagee, pages 14 - 105.
