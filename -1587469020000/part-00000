Over the course of the conflict, Kurdish factions from [[Iranian Kurdistan|Iranian]] and [[Turkish Kurdistan]], as well as Iranian, Iraqi and Turkish state forces, were drawn into the fighting, with additional involvement from American forces. Between 3,000 and 5,000 fighters and civilians were killed.\n\n==Background==\nAutonomy in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] was originally established in 1970 as the ''Kurdish Autonomous Region'' following the agreement of an Autonomy Accord between the government of Iraq and leaders of the Iraqi [[Kurds|Kurdish]] community. A Legislative Assembly was established in the city of Erbil with nominal authority over the Kurdish-populated governorates of [[Erbil Governorate|Erbil]], [[Dohuk Governorate|Dahuk]] and [[As Sulaymaniyah Governorate|As Sulaymaniyah]]. As various battles between separatist Kurds and Iraqi government forces continued until the [[1991 uprisings in Iraq]], the safety of Kurdish refugees led to the adoption of [[United Nations Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 688|Resolution 688]] which was used as a justification to implement [[Operation Provide Comfort]], a US-led multinational military operation that ensured the security of the Iraqi Kurdish region through the use of air power while simultaneously providing humanitarian aid to refugees fleeing persecution.<ref>L. Fawcett, ''Down but not out? The Kurds in International Politics'', Reviews of International Studies, Vol.27, 2001 p.117</ref> While the no-fly zone covered Dahuk and Erbil, it left out Sulaymaniyah and [[Kirkuk]]. This led to a further series of bloody clashes between Iraqi government forces and Kurdish troops. Shortly thereafter, an uneasy balance of power was reached, and Iraq withdrew its military and government officials from the region in October 1991. From that point on, Iraqi Kurdistan had achieved ''de facto'' independence under the leadership of the region's two principal Kurdish parties \u2013 the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq|Kurdish Democratic Party]] and the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]] \u2013 free from the control of [[Baghdad]]. The region then adopted its own flag and national anthem.\n\nIraqi Kurdistan held [[1992 Iraqi Kurdistan parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]] in 1992. The KDP gained an absolute majority of the votes in the [[Governorates of Iraq|governorates]] of [[Dohuk Governorate|Dohuk]] and [[Arbil Province|Arbil]], whereas the PUK garnered the broad support of the [[Sulaymaniyah Governorate|Sulaymaniyah]] governorate as well as the Kurdish portions of [[Diyala Governorate|Diyala]] (specifically the [[Kifri District|Kifri]] and [[Khanaqin District]]s). As a result of the election, the Kurdish parliament was split between [[Jalal Talabani]]'s Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and [[Massoud Barzani]]'s Kurdish Democratic Party.<ref name=\"slate.com\">{{cite web|last=Politi |first=Daniel |url=http://www.slate.com/id/1032/ |title=The Kurds - Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date= |accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter withdrawing its forces from Kurdistan in October 1991, the Iraqi government imposed an economic blockade over the region, restricting its oil and food supplies.<ref>M. Leezenberg, ''Iraqi Kurdistan: contours of a post-civil war society'', Third World Quarterly, Vol.26, No.4-5, June 2005, p.636</ref> The United Nations embargo on Iraq also significantly affected the Kurdish economy, preventing trade between the Kurds and other nations. As such, all economic dealings between Iraqi Kurdistan and the outside world were done through the [[black market]].\n\nIn March 1994 [[Turkish Armed Forces]] began [[Operation Steel]], a cross-border military incursion into [[Iraqi Kurdistan|northern Iraq]] against the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]]. On May 3 a delegation from the KDP agreed to not allow the PKK to have a base in northern Iraq. On May 4, Turkish Armed Forces left northern Iraq.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kurds in Turkey |url=http://www.asylumlaw.org/docs/turkey/mar99_turkey_kurds.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081035/http://www.asylumlaw.org/docs/turkey/mar99_turkey_kurds.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 July 2011 |website=Asylum Law |accessdate=19 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==1994 PUK\u2013KDP clashes==\n{{main|May 1994 PUK\u2013KDP clashes}}\n\nFighting broke out between the two factions in May 1994.

He made contact with the Kurdish leadership and managed to negotiate a truce between Barzani and Talabani.\n\nWithin days, Baer made contact with an Iraqi general who was plotting to assassinate [[Saddam Hussein]]. The plan was to use a unit of 100 renegade Iraqi troops to kill Saddam as he passed over a bridge near [[Tikrit]]. Baer cabled the plan to Washington but did not hear anything back. After three weeks, the plan was revised, calling for an attack by Kurdish forces in northern Iraq while rebel Iraqi troops leveled one of Saddam's houses with tank fire in order to kill the Iraqi leader. Baer again cabled the plan to Washington and received no response. On 28 February, the [[Iraqi Army]] was placed on full alert. In response, the Iranian and Turkish militaries were also placed on high alert. Baer received a message directly from National Security Advisor [[Tony Lake]] telling him his operation was compromised. This warning was passed on Baer's Kurdish and Iraqi contacts. Upon learning this, Barzani backed out of the planned offensive, leaving Talabani's PUK forces to carry it out alone.\n\nThe Iraqi Army officers planning to kill Saddam with tank fire were compromised, arrested and executed before they could carry out the operation. The PUK's offensive was still launched as planned, and within days they managed to destroy three Iraqi Army divisions and capture 5,000 prisoners.<ref name=\"wmassociation.com\">[http://www.wmassociation.com/reports/spkers/baer.html Robert Baer speech at World Media Association]  {{webarchive |url=https://archive.today/20070816094817/http://www.wmassociation.com/reports/spkers/baer.html |date=16 August 2007 }}</ref> Despite Baer's pleas for American support of the offensive, none was forthcoming, and the Kurdish troops were forced to withdraw.

On 31 August, 30,000 Iraqi troops, spearheaded by an armored division of the [[Iraqi Republican Guard]], attacked the PUK-held city of [[Erbil]], which was defended by 3,000 PUK Peshmerga led by Korsat Rasul Ali, in conjunction with KDP forces. Erbil was captured, and Iraqi troops executed 700 PUK and [[Iraqi National Congress]] [[prisoners of war]] in a field outside the city.\n\nThis attack stoked Kurdish fears that Saddam intended to launch a genocidal campaign against the Kurds similar to the campaigns of [[Al-Anfal Campaign|1988]] and [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|1991]]. The Clinton administration, unwilling to allow the Iraqi government to regain control of Iraqi Kurdistan, began [[Operation Desert Strike]] on 3 September, when American ships and [[B-52 Stratofortress]] bombers launched 27 cruise missiles at air defense sites in southern Iraq. The next day, 17 more cruise missiles were launched from American ships against Iraqi air defense sites. The United States also deployed strike aircraft and an aircraft carrier to the [[Persian Gulf]] region, and the extent of the southern no-fly zone was moved northwards to the [[33rd parallel north|33rd parallel]].<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/desert_strike.htm |title=Operation Desert Strike |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter installing the KDP in control of Erbil, [[Iraqi Army]] troops withdrew from the Kurdish region back to their initial positions. The KDP drove the PUK from its other strongholds, and with additional Iraqi Army help, captured Sulaymaniyah on 9 September. Jalal Talabani and the PUK retreated to the Iranian border, and American forces evacuated 700 Iraqi National Congress personnel and 6,000 PUK members out of northern Iraq.<ref name=\"slate.com\"/><ref name=\"globalsecurity.org\"/> On 13 October, Sulaymaniyah was recaptured by the PUK, allegedly with support of Iranian forces.<ref name=\"UNHCR\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,MARP,,IRQ,,469f38a6c,0.html|title=Refworld - Chronology for Kurds in Iraq|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=Refworld|accessdate=1 May 2016|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017070825/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2CMARP%2C%2CIRQ%2C%2C469f38a6c%2C0.html|archivedate=17 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Turkish intervention==\n{{main|Operation Hammer (1997)|Operation Dawn (1997)}}\n\nFighting continued throughout the winter between the KDP and PUK.

In the agreement, the parties agreed to share revenue, share power, deny the use of northern Iraq to the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]], and not allow Iraqi troops into the Kurdish regions. The United States pledged to use military force to protect the Kurds from possible aggression by [[Saddam Hussein]]. At the same time, implementation of the U.N. [[Oil-for-Food Programme]] brought revenue to northern Iraq, allowing for increased standards of living.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewashingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=1219 |title=Kurdish Agreement Signals New U.S. Commitment |publisher=The Washington Institute for Near East Policy |date=29 September 1998 |accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref> Iraqi Kurdistan became a relatively peaceful region, before the small terrorist group [[Ansar al-Islam]] entered the Halabja region in December 2001, bringing renewed conflict that would end in 2003 immediately prior to start of Iraq war, which mainly affected non-Kurdish areas of Iraq.\n\nAround a month later, U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the [[Iraq Liberation Act]] into law, providing for military assistance to Iraqi opposition groups, including the PUK and KDP. The KDP estimated that 58,000 of its supporters had been expelled from PUK-controlled regions from October 1996 to October 1997.

Over the course of the conflict, Kurdish factions from [[Iranian Kurdistan|Iranian]] and [[Turkish Kurdistan]], as well as Iranian, Iraqi and Turkish state forces, were drawn into the fighting, with additional involvement from American forces. Between 3,000 and 5,000 fighters and civilians were killed.\n\n==Background==\nAutonomy in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] was originally established in 1970 as the ''Kurdish Autonomous Region'' following the agreement of an Autonomy Accord between the government of Iraq and leaders of the Iraqi [[Kurds|Kurdish]] community. A Legislative Assembly was established in the city of Erbil with nominal authority over the Kurdish-populated governorates of [[Erbil Governorate|Erbil]], [[Dohuk Governorate|Dahuk]] and [[As Sulaymaniyah Governorate|As Sulaymaniyah]]. As various battles between separatist Kurds and Iraqi government forces continued until the [[1991 uprisings in Iraq]], the safety of Kurdish refugees led to the adoption of [[United Nations Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 688|Resolution 688]] which was used as a justification to implement [[Operation Provide Comfort]], a US-led multinational military operation that ensured the security of the Iraqi Kurdish region through the use of air power while simultaneously providing humanitarian aid to refugees fleeing persecution.<ref>L. Fawcett, ''Down but not out? The Kurds in International Politics'', Reviews of International Studies, Vol.27, 2001 p.117</ref> While the no-fly zone covered Dahuk and Erbil, it left out Sulaymaniyah and [[Kirkuk]]. This led to a further series of bloody clashes between Iraqi government forces and Kurdish troops. Shortly thereafter, an uneasy balance of power was reached, and Iraq withdrew its military and government officials from the region in October 1991. From that point on, Iraqi Kurdistan had achieved ''de facto'' independence under the leadership of the region's two principal Kurdish parties \u2013 the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq|Kurdish Democratic Party]] and the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]] \u2013 free from the control of [[Baghdad]]. The region then adopted its own flag and national anthem.\n\nIraqi Kurdistan held [[1992 Iraqi Kurdistan parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]] in 1992. The KDP gained an absolute majority of the votes in the [[Governorates of Iraq|governorates]] of [[Dohuk Governorate|Dohuk]] and [[Arbil Province|Arbil]], whereas the PUK garnered the broad support of the [[Sulaymaniyah Governorate|Sulaymaniyah]] governorate as well as the Kurdish portions of [[Diyala Governorate|Diyala]] (specifically the [[Kifri District|Kifri]] and [[Khanaqin District]]s). As a result of the election, the Kurdish parliament was split between [[Jalal Talabani]]'s Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and [[Massoud Barzani]]'s Kurdish Democratic Party.<ref name=\"slate.com\">{{cite web|last=Politi |first=Daniel |url=http://www.slate.com/id/1032/ |title=The Kurds - Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date= |accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter withdrawing its forces from Kurdistan in October 1991, the Iraqi government imposed an economic blockade over the region, restricting its oil and food supplies.<ref>M. Leezenberg, ''Iraqi Kurdistan: contours of a post-civil war society'', Third World Quarterly, Vol.26, No.4-5, June 2005, p.636</ref> The United Nations embargo on Iraq also significantly affected the Kurdish economy, preventing trade between the Kurds and other nations. As such, all economic dealings between Iraqi Kurdistan and the outside world were done through the [[black market]].\n\nIn March 1994 [[Turkish Armed Forces]] began [[Operation Steel]], a cross-border military incursion into [[Iraqi Kurdistan|northern Iraq]] against the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]]. On May 3 a delegation from the KDP agreed to not allow the PKK to have a base in northern Iraq.

He made contact with the Kurdish leadership and managed to negotiate a truce between Barzani and Talabani.\n\nWithin days, Baer made contact with an Iraqi general who was plotting to assassinate [[Saddam Hussein]]. The plan was to use a unit of 100 renegade Iraqi troops to kill Saddam as he passed over a bridge near [[Tikrit]]. Baer cabled the plan to Washington but did not hear anything back. After three weeks, the plan was revised, calling for an attack by Kurdish forces in northern Iraq while rebel Iraqi troops leveled one of Saddam's houses with tank fire in order to kill the Iraqi leader. Baer again cabled the plan to Washington and received no response. On 28 February, the [[Iraqi Army]] was placed on full alert. In response, the Iranian and Turkish militaries were also placed on high alert. Baer received a message directly from National Security Advisor [[Tony Lake]] telling him his operation was compromised. This warning was passed on Baer's Kurdish and Iraqi contacts. Upon learning this, Barzani backed out of the planned offensive, leaving Talabani's PUK forces to carry it out alone.\n\nThe Iraqi Army officers planning to kill Saddam with tank fire were compromised, arrested and executed before they could carry out the operation. The PUK's offensive was still launched as planned, and within days they managed to destroy three Iraqi Army divisions and capture 5,000 prisoners.<ref name=\"wmassociation.com\">[http://www.wmassociation.com/reports/spkers/baer.html Robert Baer speech at World Media Association]  {{webarchive |url=https://archive.today/20070816094817/http://www.wmassociation.com/reports/spkers/baer.html |date=16 August 2007 }}</ref> Despite Baer's pleas for American support of the offensive, none was forthcoming, and the Kurdish troops were forced to withdraw.

On 31 August, 30,000 Iraqi troops, spearheaded by an armored division of the [[Iraqi Republican Guard]], attacked the PUK-held city of [[Erbil]], which was defended by 3,000 PUK Peshmerga led by Korsat Rasul Ali, in conjunction with KDP forces. Erbil was captured, and Iraqi troops executed 700 PUK and [[Iraqi National Congress]] [[prisoners of war]] in a field outside the city.\n\nThis attack stoked Kurdish fears that Saddam intended to launch a genocidal campaign against the Kurds similar to the campaigns of [[Al-Anfal Campaign|1988]] and [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|1991]]. The Clinton administration, unwilling to allow the Iraqi government to regain control of Iraqi Kurdistan, began [[Operation Desert Strike]] on 3 September, when American ships and [[B-52 Stratofortress]] bombers launched 27 cruise missiles at air defense sites in southern Iraq. The next day, 17 more cruise missiles were launched from American ships against Iraqi air defense sites. The United States also deployed strike aircraft and an aircraft carrier to the [[Persian Gulf]] region, and the extent of the southern no-fly zone was moved northwards to the [[33rd parallel north|33rd parallel]].<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/desert_strike.htm |title=Operation Desert Strike |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter installing the KDP in control of Erbil, [[Iraqi Army]] troops withdrew from the Kurdish region back to their initial positions. The KDP drove the PUK from its other strongholds, and with additional Iraqi Army help, captured Sulaymaniyah on 9 September.

In the agreement, the parties agreed to share revenue, share power, deny the use of northern Iraq to the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]], and not allow Iraqi troops into the Kurdish regions. The United States pledged to use military force to protect the Kurds from possible aggression by [[Saddam Hussein]]. At the same time, implementation of the U.N.

Muralitharan, V. Swaminathan and G. Venugopal under the banner of [[Lakshmi Movie Makers]]. The film was written by [[Kamal Haasan]], and [[Madhan (writer)|Madhan]] provided the dialogues. ''Anbe Sivam'' features Haasan, [[R. Madhavan|Madhavan]] and [[Kiran Rathod]] in the lead roles, with [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]], [[Santhana Bharathi]], [[Seema (actress)|Seema]] and [[Uma Riyaz Khan]] playing supporting characters.\n\nThe film tells the story of an unexpected journey from [[Bhubaneswar]] to [[Chennai]] undertaken by two men of contrasting personalities, Nallasivam and Anbarasu. The musical score was composed by [[Vidyasagar (composer)|Vidyasagar]]. [[Arthur A. Wilson]] and M. Prabhaharan undertook responsibility for the film's cinematography and art direction, respectively.\n\nProduced on a budget of [[Indian rupee sign|{{INR}}]]120&nbsp;million, ''Anbe Sivam'' takes on several themes, including [[communism]], [[atheism]], and [[altruism]], and depicts Haasan's views as a [[Humanism|humanist]]. The film was released on 15 January 2003 to positive reviews from critics, but [[Box-office bomb|underperformed]] at the box office. Despite its failure, it gained recognition over the years through re-runs on television channels and is now regarded as a classic and a [[cult film]] in [[Tamil cinema]].\n\n''Anbe Sivam'' was screened as part of the Indian Panorama section of the [[International Film Festival of India]] in 2003. At the [[51st Filmfare Awards South]], it received a [[Filmfare Special Award&nbsp;\u2013 South|Special Jury Award]] and received nominations in the [[Filmfare Award for Best Film&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Film]] and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Actor]] (Haasan) categories. Madhavan was awarded [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] at the 2003 [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards]].It is the second highest rated movie on IMDB \n\n== Plot ==\nTwo men waiting for a flight to [[Chennai]] at the [[Biju Patnaik International Airport]] in [[Bhubaneswar]] engage in conversation. One is a [[commercial director]], Anbarasu, who prefers the abbreviated name A.{{nbsp}}Aras, and the other is a scarred and deformed socialist, Nallasivam, alias Nalla. When the flight is cancelled due to heavy rain, Aras initially suspects Nalla is a terrorist and informs the authorities, only to discover that he was mistaken. With the rain flooding the city, the two men are forced to share a room for the night. Both need to return to Chennai: Aras to be present at his wedding, and Nalla has to deliver a {{INR}}3,200,000{{efn|name=exchange2003}} cheque, recently awarded to him after he won a court case, to a group of union workers. After a traumatic night, and no hope for a flight, the two men take a bus to board the [[Coromandel Express]] train. Aras' bag gets stolen on the way leaving him with only his credit card, which no one accepts. Using his presence of mind, Nalla repeatedly bails Aras out of trouble while Aras tries escaping from him at every juncture, only to end up with him again. While waiting for the train at the [[Ichchapuram]] railway station, Nalla begins to tell Aras his story.\n\nA few years earlier, a healthy Nalla took part in various [[street theatre]] performances protesting against [[Foreign direct investment|multinational corporation-driven industrialisation]], that resulted in the marginalisation of the [[Workforce|labour force]]. He was at odds with Kandasamy Padayatchi, a manipulative factory owner who refused to give his workers a raise. Nalla satirically imitated Padayatchi in many of his shows. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Nalla and Padayatchi's daughter Balasaraswathi alias Bala, fell in love with each other. To avoid a potential conflict with Padayatchi, the two decided to elope to Kerala. Nalla boarded a bus bound for Kerala, and on his way to meet Bala, the bus crashed on a hillside leaving him scarred, disfigured, and partially paralysed for life. After recovering from his wounds, he visited Bala only to be informed by Padayatchi that his daughter was already married and has settled abroad. Padayatchi had earlier lied to Bala that Nalla died in the accident. It was also at this time that Nalla became a firm believer in kindness and love. Despite suffering from an inferiority complex due to his scarred and deformed body, Nalla performs community service and social work with renewed fervour while continuing to fight for union causes.\n\nUpon their arrival at Chennai, Aras delivers Nalla's cheque to the union workers. He invites Nalla to his wedding, where, to his utter astonishment, Nalla sees that Aras's bride is Bala. Padayatchi spots Nalla and asks him why he is at the wedding. He tells Padayatchi that he was invited by Aras, and later persuades him to sign the papers which will help Padayatchi's workers get a raise. To prevent the disruption of Bala's wedding and avoid damaging his own reputation, Padayatchi yields to Nalla's demands. After signing the papers, Padayatchi instructs his assistant to eliminate Nalla. However, his assistant has a change of heart as he is about to kill him. Padayatchi's assistant believes that the misdeeds he committed for Padayatchi resulted in the death of the assistant's daughter. Padayatchi's assistant requests Nalla to stay as far away from his boss as possible; Nalla assents and walks away.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| width1    = 209\n| width2    = 200\n| footer    = [[Kamal Haasan]] and [[R.

Madhavan|Madhavan]] and [[Kiran Rathod]] in the lead roles, with [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]], [[Santhana Bharathi]], [[Seema (actress)|Seema]] and [[Uma Riyaz Khan]] playing supporting characters.\n\nThe film tells the story of an unexpected journey from [[Bhubaneswar]] to [[Chennai]] undertaken by two men of contrasting personalities, Nallasivam and Anbarasu. The musical score was composed by [[Vidyasagar (composer)|Vidyasagar]]. [[Arthur A. Wilson]] and M. Prabhaharan undertook responsibility for the film's cinematography and art direction, respectively.\n\nProduced on a budget of [[Indian rupee sign|{{INR}}]]120&nbsp;million, ''Anbe Sivam'' takes on several themes, including [[communism]], [[atheism]], and [[altruism]], and depicts Haasan's views as a [[Humanism|humanist]]. The film was released on 15 January 2003 to positive reviews from critics, but [[Box-office bomb|underperformed]] at the box office. Despite its failure, it gained recognition over the years through re-runs on television channels and is now regarded as a classic and a [[cult film]] in [[Tamil cinema]].\n\n''Anbe Sivam'' was screened as part of the Indian Panorama section of the [[International Film Festival of India]] in 2003. At the [[51st Filmfare Awards South]], it received a [[Filmfare Special Award&nbsp;\u2013 South|Special Jury Award]] and received nominations in the [[Filmfare Award for Best Film&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Film]] and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Actor]] (Haasan) categories. Madhavan was awarded [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] at the 2003 [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\nTwo men waiting for a flight to [[Chennai]] at the [[Biju Patnaik International Airport]] in [[Bhubaneswar]] engage in conversation. One is a [[commercial director]], Anbarasu, who prefers the abbreviated name A.{{nbsp}}Aras, and the other is a scarred and deformed socialist, Nallasivam, alias Nalla. When the flight is cancelled due to heavy rain, Aras initially suspects Nalla is a terrorist and informs the authorities, only to discover that he was mistaken. With the rain flooding the city, the two men are forced to share a room for the night. Both need to return to Chennai: Aras to be present at his wedding, and Nalla has to deliver a {{INR}}3,200,000{{efn|name=exchange2003}} cheque, recently awarded to him after he won a court case, to a group of union workers. After a traumatic night, and no hope for a flight, the two men take a bus to board the [[Coromandel Express]] train. Aras' bag gets stolen on the way leaving him with only his credit card, which no one accepts. Using his presence of mind, Nalla repeatedly bails Aras out of trouble while Aras tries escaping from him at every juncture, only to end up with him again. While waiting for the train at the [[Ichchapuram]] railway station, Nalla begins to tell Aras his story.\n\nA few years earlier, a healthy Nalla took part in various [[street theatre]] performances protesting against [[Foreign direct investment|multinational corporation-driven industrialisation]], that resulted in the marginalisation of the [[Workforce|labour force]]. He was at odds with Kandasamy Padayatchi, a manipulative factory owner who refused to give his workers a raise. Nalla satirically imitated Padayatchi in many of his shows. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Nalla and Padayatchi's daughter Balasaraswathi alias Bala, fell in love with each other. To avoid a potential conflict with Padayatchi, the two decided to elope to Kerala. Nalla boarded a bus bound for Kerala, and on his way to meet Bala, the bus crashed on a hillside leaving him scarred, disfigured, and partially paralysed for life. After recovering from his wounds, he visited Bala only to be informed by Padayatchi that his daughter was already married and has settled abroad. Padayatchi had earlier lied to Bala that Nalla died in the accident. It was also at this time that Nalla became a firm believer in kindness and love. Despite suffering from an inferiority complex due to his scarred and deformed body, Nalla performs community service and social work with renewed fervour while continuing to fight for union causes.\n\nUpon their arrival at Chennai, Aras delivers Nalla's cheque to the union workers. He invites Nalla to his wedding, where, to his utter astonishment, Nalla sees that Aras's bride is Bala. Padayatchi spots Nalla and asks him why he is at the wedding. He tells Padayatchi that he was invited by Aras, and later persuades him to sign the papers which will help Padayatchi's workers get a raise. To prevent the disruption of Bala's wedding and avoid damaging his own reputation, Padayatchi yields to Nalla's demands. After signing the papers, Padayatchi instructs his assistant to eliminate Nalla. However, his assistant has a change of heart as he is about to kill him. Padayatchi's assistant believes that the misdeeds he committed for Padayatchi resulted in the death of the assistant's daughter. Padayatchi's assistant requests Nalla to stay as far away from his boss as possible; Nalla assents and walks away.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| width1    = 209\n| width2    = 200\n| footer    = [[Kamal Haasan]] and [[R.
