Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable.

Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\".

By 2013 more than 600,000 copies were in print in a dozen languages.\n\nThe book is the basis of a 2006 documentary film of the same name, directed by [[Pippa Scott]] and narrated by [[Don Cheadle]].<ref>{{IMDb title|0455581|King Leopold's Ghost}}</ref>\n\n== Title ==\nThe title is adopted from the 1914 poem \"The Congo\", by Illinois poet [[Vachel Lindsay]].  Condemning Leopold's actions, Lindsay wrote:\n\n:Listen to the yell of Leopold's ghost,\n:Burning in Hell for his hand-maimed host.\n:Hear how the demons chuckle and yell,\n:Cutting his hands off, down in Hell.\n\n== Content ==\nLeopold II, King of the Belgians, privately controlled and owned the Congo Free State from 1885 to 1908. In 1908, the area was annexed by Belgium as a colony known as the [[Belgian Congo]]. Leopold used his personal control to strip the county of vast amounts of wealth, largely in the form of ivory and rubber. These labor-intensive industries were serviced by slave labor, and the local peoples were forced to work through various means, including torture, imprisonment, maiming and terror. Christian missionaries and a handful of human rights organizers internationally publicized these atrocities. Slowly, various nations, including the United Kingdom and the United States of America, began to object to Leopold's tyranny with the result that the country's administration was transferred to Belgium. Little changed inside the country, however, until the ivory and rubber were exhausted.\n\nEuropean interest in the African continent can be traced back to the late 1400s, when the European explorer [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] sailed the west coast and discovered the Congo River. By the 1860s, most African coastal regions were claimed as colonies of European powers, but the vast interior of the continent remained unknown to Europeans. [[Henry Morton Stanley]], a complicated man and renowned explorer, ventured through much of that unknown during a descent of the Congo River. Leopold II, King of the Belgians, was fascinated with obtaining a colony and focused upon claiming the interior of Africa\u2014the only unclaimed sizable geographic area. Moving within the European political paradigm existing in the early 1880s, Leopold gained international concessions and recognition for his personal claim to the Congo Free State.\n\nHis rule of the vast region was based on tyranny and terror. Under his direction, Stanley again visited the area and extracted favorable treaties from numerous local leaders. A road and, eventually, a rail line were developed from the coast to [[L\u00e9opoldville|Leopoldville]] (present-day Kinshasa). A series of militarized outposts were established along the length of the Congo River, and imported paddle wheelers commenced regular river service. Native peoples were forced to gather ivory and transport it for export. Beginning c. 1890, rubber\u2014originally manufactured from coagulated sap\u2014became economically significant in international trade. The Congo was rich in rubber-producing vines, and Leopold transitioned his exploitative focus from dwindling ivory supplies to the burgeoning rubber market. Slavery, exploitation and the reign of terror continued and even increased.\n\nMeanwhile, early missionaries and human rights advocates such as [[Roger Casement]], [[E. D. Morel]], [[George Washington Williams]], and [[William Henry Sheppard]] began to circulate news of the widespread atrocities committed in the Congo under the official blessing of Leopold's administration. Women and children were imprisoned as hostages to force husbands and fathers to work. Flogging, starvation and torture were routine. Murder was common\u2014tribes resisting enslavement were wiped out; administration officials expected to receive back a severed human hand for every bullet issued. Rape and sexual slavery were rampant. Workers failing to secure assigned quotas of rubber were routinely mutilated or tortured. Administration officials so completely dehumanized local peoples that at least one decorated his flower garden with a border of severed human heads. News of these atrocities brought slow, but powerful, international condemnation of Leopold's administration leading, eventually, to his assignment of the country to Belgian administration.\n\nIn 1908, Belgium annexed the Congo as a colony and proclaimed a general sea-change in administrative policy. Actual change, however, was nearly imperceptible. The era of [[World War I]] shifted attention from atrocities in Africa to European trench warfare. In the post-war era, the global demand for reform was largely forgotten. However, commercial rubber tree farming had become firmly established and the collection of wild rubber became commercially insignificant, just as ivory supplies had been exhausted years earlier. Because of this, the slave labor industries of the Congo diminished in importance and atrocities became far less frequent. Finally, in 1960, the Congo gained independence.\n\n== Scholarship ==\nHochschild cites the research of several historians, many of them Belgian. He refers especially to [[Jules Marchal]], formerly a Belgian colonial civil servant and diplomat who (as Hochschild describes) spent twenty years trying to break Belgian silence about the massacres. The documentation was not easy to come by; the furnaces of the palace in Brussels are said to have spent more than a week burning incriminating papers before Leopold turned over his private Congo to the Belgian nation. For many years Belgian authorities prevented access to what remained of the archives, notably the accounts given by Congolese to the King's Commission.\n\nAlthough few African scholars seriously question that large numbers died in Leopold's Congo, the subject remains a touchy one in Belgium itself. The country's [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]], founded by Leopold II, mounted a special exhibition in 2005 about the colonial Congo; in an article in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', Hochschild accused the museum of distortion and evasion.<ref name=\"HowardwFrench2005-10-26\" />\n\nAlso in 2005, the American and British publishers of ''King Leopold's Ghost'' reissued the book with a new afterword<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/readers_guides/hochschild_king_leo.shtml#afterword|title=Reader's Guide for King Leopold's Ghost published by Houghton Mifflin Company|website=www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com|accessdate=November 10, 2019}}</ref> by Hochschild in which he talks about the reactions to the book, the death toll, and events in the Congo since its publication.\n\n== Reception ==\nHochschild has been praised by scholars and critics<ref name=Harding>{{cite news \n |title=Into Africa\n |author=Jeremy Harding\n |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/20/reviews/980920.20hardint.html\n |newspaper=New York Times\n |date=20 September 1998\n |accessdate=13 June 2012\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010913021042/http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/20/reviews/980920.20hardint.html\n |archivedate=13 September 2001\n |quote=a superb synoptic history of European misdemeanor in central Africa\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news \n |title=Genocide With Spin Control\n |author=Michiko Kakutani\n |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/08/30/daily/leopold-book-review.html\n |newspaper=New York Times\n |date=1 September 1998\n |accessdate=13 June 2012\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010418010702/http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/08/30/daily/leopold-book-review.html\n |archivedate=18 April 2001\n |quote=Hochschild has stitched it together into a vivid, novelistic narrative\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news \n |title=Leopold's Heart of Darkness\n |author=Luc Sante\n |url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Leopold-s-Heart-of-Darkness-Adam-Hochschild-2988734.php\n |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle\n |date=27 September 1998\n |accessdate=13 June 2012\n |quote='King Leopold's Ghost' is an absorbing and horrifying account\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n |author      = Godwin Rapando Murunga\n |year        = 1999\n |title       = King Leopold's Ghost (review)\n |journal     = African Studies Quarterly\n |volume      = 3\n |issue       = 2\n |publisher   = Center for African Studies at the University of Florida\n |url         = http://web.africa.ufl.edu/asq/v3/v3i2a12.htm\n |accessdate  = 13 June 2012\n |quote       = King Leopold's Ghost tells the story of the Congo with fresh and critical insights, bringing new analysis to this topic.\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120618115733/http://web.africa.ufl.edu/asq/v3/v3i2a12.htm\n |archivedate = 18 June 2012\n}}</ref> for his narrative.

By 2013 more than 600,000 copies were in print in a dozen languages.\n\nThe book is the basis of a 2006 documentary film of the same name, directed by [[Pippa Scott]] and narrated by [[Don Cheadle]].<ref>{{IMDb title|0455581|King Leopold's Ghost}}</ref>\n\n== Title ==\nThe title is adopted from the 1914 poem \"The Congo\", by Illinois poet [[Vachel Lindsay]].  Condemning Leopold's actions, Lindsay wrote:\n\n:Listen to the yell of Leopold's ghost,\n:Burning in Hell for his hand-maimed host.\n:Hear how the demons chuckle and yell,\n:Cutting his hands off, down in Hell.\n\n== Content ==\nLeopold II, King of the Belgians, privately controlled and owned the Congo Free State from 1885 to 1908. In 1908, the area was annexed by Belgium as a colony known as the [[Belgian Congo]]. Leopold used his personal control to strip the county of vast amounts of wealth, largely in the form of ivory and rubber. These labor-intensive industries were serviced by slave labor, and the local peoples were forced to work through various means, including torture, imprisonment, maiming and terror. Christian missionaries and a handful of human rights organizers internationally publicized these atrocities. Slowly, various nations, including the United Kingdom and the United States of America, began to object to Leopold's tyranny with the result that the country's administration was transferred to Belgium. Little changed inside the country, however, until the ivory and rubber were exhausted.\n\nEuropean interest in the African continent can be traced back to the late 1400s, when the European explorer [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] sailed the west coast and discovered the Congo River. By the 1860s, most African coastal regions were claimed as colonies of European powers, but the vast interior of the continent remained unknown to Europeans. [[Henry Morton Stanley]], a complicated man and renowned explorer, ventured through much of that unknown during a descent of the Congo River. Leopold II, King of the Belgians, was fascinated with obtaining a colony and focused upon claiming the interior of Africa\u2014the only unclaimed sizable geographic area. Moving within the European political paradigm existing in the early 1880s, Leopold gained international concessions and recognition for his personal claim to the Congo Free State.\n\nHis rule of the vast region was based on tyranny and terror. Under his direction, Stanley again visited the area and extracted favorable treaties from numerous local leaders. A road and, eventually, a rail line were developed from the coast to [[L\u00e9opoldville|Leopoldville]] (present-day Kinshasa). A series of militarized outposts were established along the length of the Congo River, and imported paddle wheelers commenced regular river service. Native peoples were forced to gather ivory and transport it for export. Beginning c. 1890, rubber\u2014originally manufactured from coagulated sap\u2014became economically significant in international trade. The Congo was rich in rubber-producing vines, and Leopold transitioned his exploitative focus from dwindling ivory supplies to the burgeoning rubber market. Slavery, exploitation and the reign of terror continued and even increased.\n\nMeanwhile, early missionaries and human rights advocates such as [[Roger Casement]], [[E. D. Morel]], [[George Washington Williams]], and [[William Henry Sheppard]] began to circulate news of the widespread atrocities committed in the Congo under the official blessing of Leopold's administration. Women and children were imprisoned as hostages to force husbands and fathers to work. Flogging, starvation and torture were routine. Murder was common\u2014tribes resisting enslavement were wiped out; administration officials expected to receive back a severed human hand for every bullet issued. Rape and sexual slavery were rampant. Workers failing to secure assigned quotas of rubber were routinely mutilated or tortured. Administration officials so completely dehumanized local peoples that at least one decorated his flower garden with a border of severed human heads. News of these atrocities brought slow, but powerful, international condemnation of Leopold's administration leading, eventually, to his assignment of the country to Belgian administration.\n\nIn 1908, Belgium annexed the Congo as a colony and proclaimed a general sea-change in administrative policy. Actual change, however, was nearly imperceptible. The era of [[World War I]] shifted attention from atrocities in Africa to European trench warfare. In the post-war era, the global demand for reform was largely forgotten. However, commercial rubber tree farming had become firmly established and the collection of wild rubber became commercially insignificant, just as ivory supplies had been exhausted years earlier. Because of this, the slave labor industries of the Congo diminished in importance and atrocities became far less frequent. Finally, in 1960, the Congo gained independence.\n\n== Scholarship ==\nHochschild cites the research of several historians, many of them Belgian. He refers especially to [[Jules Marchal]], formerly a Belgian colonial civil servant and diplomat who (as Hochschild describes) spent twenty years trying to break Belgian silence about the massacres. The documentation was not easy to come by; the furnaces of the palace in Brussels are said to have spent more than a week burning incriminating papers before Leopold turned over his private Congo to the Belgian nation. For many years Belgian authorities prevented access to what remained of the archives, notably the accounts given by Congolese to the King's Commission.\n\nAlthough few African scholars seriously question that large numbers died in Leopold\u2019s Congo, the subject remains a touchy one in Belgium itself. The country\u2019s [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]], founded by Leopold II, mounted a special exhibition in 2005 about the colonial Congo; in an article in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', Hochschild accused the museum of distortion and evasion.<ref name=\"HowardwFrench2005-10-26\" />\n\nAlso in 2005, the American and British publishers of ''King Leopold\u2019s Ghost'' reissued the book with a new \u201cAfterword\u201d<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/readers_guides/hochschild_king_leo.shtml#afterword|title=Reader's Guide for King Leopold's Ghost published by Houghton Mifflin Company|website=www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com|accessdate=November 10, 2019}}</ref> by Hochschild in which he talks about the reactions to the book, the death toll, and events in the Congo since its publication.\n\n== Reception ==\nHochschild has been praised by scholars and critics<ref name=Harding>{{cite news \n |title=Into Africa\n |author=Jeremy Harding\n |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/20/reviews/980920.20hardint.html\n |newspaper=New York Times\n |date=20 September 1998\n |accessdate=13 June 2012\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010913021042/http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/20/reviews/980920.20hardint.html\n |archivedate=13 September 2001\n |quote=a superb synoptic history of European misdemeanor in central Africa\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news \n |title=Genocide With Spin Control\n |author=Michiko Kakutani\n |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/08/30/daily/leopold-book-review.html\n |newspaper=New York Times\n |date=1 September 1998\n |accessdate=13 June 2012\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010418010702/http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/08/30/daily/leopold-book-review.html\n |archivedate=18 April 2001\n |quote=Hochschild has stitched it together into a vivid, novelistic narrative\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news \n |title=Leopold's Heart of Darkness\n |author=Luc Sante\n |url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Leopold-s-Heart-of-Darkness-Adam-Hochschild-2988734.php\n |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle\n |date=27 September 1998\n |accessdate=13 June 2012\n |quote='King Leopold's Ghost' is an absorbing and horrifying account\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n |author      = Godwin Rapando Murunga\n |year        = 1999\n |title       = King Leopold's Ghost (review)\n |journal     = African Studies Quarterly\n |volume      = 3\n |issue       = 2\n |publisher   = Center for African Studies at the University of Florida\n |url         = http://web.africa.ufl.edu/asq/v3/v3i2a12.htm\n |accessdate  = 13 June 2012\n |quote       = King Leopold's Ghost tells the story of the Congo with fresh and critical insights, bringing new analysis to this topic.\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120618115733/http://web.africa.ufl.edu/asq/v3/v3i2a12.htm\n |archivedate = 18 June 2012\n}}</ref> for his narrative.

Special attention is given to the design of the store environment: graphics reinforce its advertising imagery, while shelves are dressed with contemporary signage, backdrops, and liners, often printed on inexpensive material such as paper, corrugated and foam boards. Some stores, particularly those in the vicinity of major airports, have a [[bullseye (target)|bullseye]] painted on the roof that can be seen from above: the stores in [[East Point, Georgia]] near [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]]; [[Rosemont, Illinois]], near [[O'Hare International Airport]]; [[Potomac Yard|Potomac Yard, Virginia]], near [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]]; [[College Point, New York]] (Queens), east of [[LaGuardia Airport]]; and [[Richfield, Minnesota]], adjacent to [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul International Airport]] are among such locations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Target+loc:+Rosemont,+Illinois&ie=UTF8&z=18&ll=42.006903,-87.887095&spn=0.00287,0.006748&t=k&om=1 |title= Target on roof top in Rosemont, IL |publisher=Google Maps |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nTarget stores do not sell [[firearm]]s.

Though this practice is often attributed to [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s usage on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|her television show]], it is first attested in 1962, the year the first Target store opened.

Also, managers are known as \"Executive Team Leaders (ETLs),\" \"Senior Team Leaders (SRTLs),\" or \"Guest Service Team Leaders (GSTLs)\" and the Store Manager is known as the \"Store Team Leader (STL)\". Further up the \"chain of command\" are \"District Team Leaders (DTL)\", \"Group Team Leaders (GTL) (sometimes also Group Vice President)\", Regional Team Leaders (RTL) (sometimes also Regional Vice President), and finally corporate-level executives.\n\nThis practice began to be revised in 2018 and became more widespread in 2019 as the Group Team Leader became the Group Operations Director. District Team Leader became the District Senior Director. The Store Team Leader became Store Director. Executive Team Leaders were shortened to Executive Team Lead. Other Team Leaders retained their title though some of the department names changed such as Guest Service Team Leader was renamed Service & Engagement Team Leader. Front of store team members were renamed Guest Advocates. Speciality areas in Style, Beauty and Tech are considered Consultants. Other areas such as General Merchandise, Presentation, Inbound, Fulfillment, Food Service and Reverse Logistics are considered Experts.\n\n===Product lines and partnerships===\nTarget has many exclusive deals with various designers and name brands, including Finnish design company [[Marimekko]]; architect [[Michael Graves]]; athletic wear company [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]]; Portland-based undergarment designer [[Pair of Thieves]]; Italian fashion label [[Fiorucci]]; fashion designers [[Lilly Pulitzer]], [[Liz Lange]], [[Mossimo|Mossimo Giannulli]], and [[Isaac Mizrahi]], among others.

For example, some such Target GiftCard designs feature a wooden front side. On May 24, 2005, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] granted U.S. patent D505,450 for the \"ornamental design for a credit or stored value card with wood layer\" to inventors Amy L.

Some of the first gift cards issued are valued at over $300 (even though the card doesn't have any money on it). Every year, Target introduces new Holiday GiftCards. In 2007, Target's Holiday GiftCards featured a wind-up flashlight, a musical gift card, a gift card that lights up, and a scented gift card.\n\n==Target forensic services==\nIn 2006, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' revealed that Target is operating two criminal [[forensics]] laboratories, one at its headquarters and the other in [[Las Vegas]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.azag.gov/StopMeth/RetailBusinessPerspectiveOnLawEnforcementPartnerships.pdf |title=Target Corporation Assets Protection |author=Office of the Arizona Attorney General |date=2006 |access-date=August 8, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620130430/http://www.azag.gov/StopMeth/RetailBusinessPerspectiveOnLawEnforcementPartnerships.pdf |archive-date=June 20, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Originally, the lab was created with the role of investigating internal instances of theft, fraud, and other criminal actions that have occurred on its own properties.

Such efforts include installing sand filtration systems for the stores' wastewater. Recycling programs will be aimed at garment hangers, corrugated cardboard, electronics, shopping carts, shrink wrap, construction wastes, carpeting and ceiling tiles and roofing materials. All stores in [[Oklahoma]] will be partnered with [[Oklahoma Gas & Electric]] to exclusively use [[wind power]] for all Target stores in order to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. Stores nationwide use only [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] and [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lights]] and low-flow restrooms that reduce waste water by 30%. Some Target stores are installing roof gardens or [[green roof]]s, which absorb storm water and cut down on [[surface runoff]], mitigate temperature fluctuations and provide habitats for birds. There are currently four green-roof Target stores in [[Chicago]].\n\nTarget carries over 700 organic and alternative products from brands such as [[Archer Farms]], [[Burt's Bees]], and [[Method Products]]. They also sell clothes made from organic cotton, non-toxic cleaners, low-energy lighting and electronics, non-toxic and non-animal tested cosmetics, and furniture made from recycled materials. {{As of|2007|6}}, Target has been offering [[reusable shopping bag]]s as an alternative to disposable plastic bags.

Also, managers are known as \"Executive Team Leaders (ETLs),\" \"Senior Team Leaders (SRTLs),\" or \"Guest Service Team Leaders (GSTLs)\" and the Store Manager is known as the \"Store Team Leader (STL)\". Further up the \"chain of command\" are \"District Team Leaders (DTL)\", \"Group Team Leaders (GTL) (sometimes also Group Vice President)\", Regional Team Leaders (RTL) (sometimes also Regional Vice President), and finally corporate-level executives.\n\nThis practice began to be revised in 2018 and became more widespread in 2019 as the Group Team Leader became the Group Operations Director. District Team Leader became the District Senior Director. The Store Team Leader became Store Director. Executive Team Leaders were shortened to Executive Team Lead. Other Team Leaders retained their title though some of the department names changed such as Guest Service Team Leader was renamed Service & Engagement Team Leader. Front of store team members were renamed Guest Advocates. Speciality areas in Style, Beauty and Tech are considered Consultants. Other areas such as General Merchandise, Presentation, Inbound, Fulfillment, Food Service and Reverse Logistics are considered Experts.\n\n===Product lines and partnerships===\nTarget has many exclusive deals with various designers and name brands, including Finnish design company [[Marimekko]]; architect [[Michael Graves]]; athletic wear company [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]]; Portland-based undergarment designer [[Pair of Thieves]]; Italian fashion label [[Fiorucci]]; fashion designers [[Lilly Pulitzer]], [[Liz Lange]], [[Mossimo|Mossimo Giannulli]], and [[Isaac Mizrahi]], among others.
