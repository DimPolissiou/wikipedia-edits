There are also two [[dolphinarium]]s. At the cruise ship docks, there are several square blocks of stores selling Cuban cigars, jewellery, T-shirts, tequila, and a large variety of inexpensive souvenirs.

This annual event is said to have been started over 150 years ago by Casimiro C\u00e1rdenas. C\u00e1rdenas was one of a group that fled to the island from the village of Saban, on the mainland, after an attack during the [[Caste War of Yucat\u00e1n]]in 1848.  The attackers killed other villagers, but C\u00e1rdenas survived whilst clutching a small wooden cross.\n\nLegend has it that C\u00e1rdenas vowed to start an annual festival wherever he settled, to honor the religious power of this crucifix. Today, the original Holy Cross (Santa Cruz) Festival forms part of the wider Festival of El Cedral, which includes fairs, traditional feasts, rodeos, bullfights, music and competitions. The celebrations last about 5 days in all and are held every year at the end of April or beginning of May.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cozumel.travel/event/fiestas-de-la-santa-cruz/|title=Cozumel Pr\u00f3ximos Eventos \u2013 Fiestas de la Santa Cruz|website=cozumel.travel|access-date=2016-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308181128/http://cozumel.travel/event/fiestas-de-la-santa-cruz/|archive-date=March 8, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Cozumel Carnival ===\nThe [[Cozumel Carnival]] or ''Carnaval de Cozumel'' is one of the most important carnival festivities in M\u00e9xico.

Cozumel's Carnaval is a tradition which has been passed down through many generations that celebrates a mixture of cultures that escaped to the warm embrace of Cozumel. Dating back to the mid-1800s, Cozumel Carnaval was started by young people dressed in vibrantly colorful costumes known as \"Estudiantinas\" or \"Comparsas\", who expressed themselves in the streets of Cozumel through the artforms of dance, song, and fantasy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carnavalcozumel.com.mx|title=Carnaval Cozumel 2016|website=www.carnavalcozumel.com.mx|access-date=2016-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503170438/http://www.carnavalcozumel.com.mx/|archive-date=May 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Government==\n[[File: Palacio Municipal, Cozumel - 20140724.jpg|thumb|right|Headquarters of the municipal government of Cozumel, in San Miguel de Cozumel]]\nCozumel Municipality is one of eleven [[municipalities of Quintana Roo]].

C\u00e1rdenas was one of a group that fled to the island from the village of Saban, on the mainland, after an attack during the [[Caste War of Yucat\u00e1n]]in 1848.  The attackers killed other villagers, but C\u00e1rdenas survived whilst clutching a small wooden cross.\n\nLegend has it that C\u00e1rdenas vowed to start an annual festival wherever he settled, to honor the religious power of this crucifix. Today, the original Holy Cross (Santa Cruz) Festival forms part of the wider Festival of El Cedral, which includes fairs, traditional feasts, rodeos, bullfights, music and competitions.

He stated that he had obtained a [[firman (decree)|firman]] from the [[Sultan]] which allowed his artists to access the site, but he was unable to produce the original documentation. However, Elgin presented a document claimed to be an English translation of an [[Italian language|Italian]] copy made at the time. This document is now kept in the British Museum.<ref>St Clair, William: Lord Elgin and the Marbles. Oxford University Press, US, 3 edition (1998)</ref> Its authenticity has been questioned, as it lacked the formalities characterising edicts from the sultan. Vassilis Demetriades, Professor of Turkish Studies at the University of Crete, has argued that \"any expert in Ottoman diplomatic language can easily ascertain that the original of the document which has survived was not a firman\".<ref name=firman/> The document was recorded in an appendix of an 1816 parliamentary committee report. [https://archive.org/details/gri_33125008272383/page/n40 <!-- pg=35 quote=lord elgin testified 1816 british parliamentary committee. --> 'The committee permission'] had convened to examine a request by Elgin asking the British government to purchase the Marbles. The report said that the document<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parthenon.newmentor.net/firman.htm|title=firman|work=newmentor.net}}</ref> in the appendix was an accurate translation, in English, of an Ottoman firman dated July 1801. In Elgin's view it amounted to an Ottoman authorisation to remove the marbles. The committee was told that the original document was given to Ottoman officials in Athens in 1801. Researchers have so far failed to locate it despite the fact that firmans, being official decrees by the Sultan, were meticulously recorded as a matter of procedure, and that the Ottoman archives in Istanbul still hold a number of similar documents dating from the same period.<ref name=Nation/>\n\nThe parliamentary record shows that the Italian copy of the firman was not presented to the committee by Elgin himself but by one of his associates, the clergyman Rev. [[Philip Hunt (priest)|Philip Hunt]]. Hunt, who at the time resided in Bedford, was the last witness to appear before the committee and stated that he had in his possession an Italian translation of the Ottoman original. He went on to explain that he had not brought the document, because, upon leaving Bedford, he was not aware that he was to testify as a witness. The English document in the parliamentary report was filed by Hunt, but the committee was not presented with the Italian translation in Hunt's possession. William St. Clair, a contemporary biographer of Lord Elgin, said he possessed Hunt's Italian document and \"vouches for the accuracy of the English translation\". The committee report states on page 69 \"(Signed with a signet.) Seged Abdullah Kaimacan\" - however, the document presented to the committee was \"an English translation of this purported translation into Italian of the original ''firman''\",<ref>{{cite book |first=Kate Fitz |last=Gibbon |title=Who Owns the Past?: Cultural Policy, Cultural Property, and the Law |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2005 |page=115 }}</ref> and had neither signet nor signature on it, a fact corroborated by St. Clair.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\">{{cite journal |first=David |last=Rudenstine |title=Did Elgin cheat the Marbles? |journal=[[The Nation]]}}</ref> The 1967 study by British historian William St. Clair, ''Lord Elgin and the Marbles,'' stated the sultan did not allow the removal of statues and reliefs from the Parthenon.

According to non-restitutionalists, further evidence that the removal of the sculptures by Elgin was approved by the Ottoman authorities is shown by a second firman which was required for the shipping of the marbles from [[Piraeus]].<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">{{cite book |first=John Henry |last=Merryman |chapter=Whither the Elgin Marbles? |title=Imperialism, Art And Restitution |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 }}</ref>\n\nMany have questioned the legality of Elgin's actions, including the legitimacy of the documentation purportedly authorising them. A study by Professor [[David Rudenstine]] of the [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]] concluded that the premise that Elgin obtained legal title to the marbles, which he then transferred to the British government, \"is certainly not established and may well be false\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rudenstine |first=David |title=The Legality of Elgin's Taking: A Review Essay of Four Books on the Parthenon Marbles |journal=International Journal of Cultural Property |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=356\u2013376 }}</ref> Rudenstine's argumentation is partly based on a translation discrepancy he noticed between the surviving Italian document and the English text submitted by Hunt to the parliamentary committee. The text from the committee report reads \"We therefore have written this Letter to you, and expedited it by Mr. Philip Hunt, an English Gentleman, Secretary of the aforesaid Ambassador\" but according to the St. Clair Italian document the actual wording is \"We therefore have written this letter to you and expedited it by N.N.\". In Rudenstine's view, this substitution of \"Mr. Philip Hunt\" with the initials \"N.N.\" can hardly be a simple mistake. He further argues that the document was presented after the committee's insistence that some form of Ottoman written authorisation for the removal of the marbles be provided, a fact known to Hunt by the time he testified. Thus, according to Rudenstine, \"Hunt put himself in a position in which he could simultaneously vouch for the authenticity of the document and explain why he alone had a copy of it fifteen years after he surrendered the original to Ottoman officials in Athens\". On two earlier occasions, Elgin stated that the Ottomans gave him written permissions more than once, but that he had \"retained none of them.\" Hunt testified on March 13, and one of the questions asked was \"Did you ever see any of the written permissions which were granted [to Lord Elgin] for removing the Marbles from the Temple of Minerva?\" to which Hunt answered \"yes\", adding that he possessed an Italian translation of the original firman. Nonetheless, he did not explain why he had retained the translation for 15 years, whereas Elgin, who had testified two weeks earlier, knew nothing about the existence of any such document.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\" />\n\nEnglish travel writer [[Edward Daniel Clarke]], an eyewitness, wrote that the [[Dizdar]], the Ottoman fortress commander on the scene, attempted to stop the removal of the metopes but was bribed to allow it to continue.<ref name=\"Edward Daniel Clarke 1818 223ff\">{{Cite book|author=Edward Daniel Clarke |title= Travels in various Countries of Europe, Asia and Africa Part the Second Greece Egypt and the Holy Land Section the Second Fourth Edition Volume the Sixth |publisher=T. Cadell |location=London |year=1818 |page= 223ff}}</ref> \nIn contrast, John Merryman, Sweitzer Professor of Law at [[Stanford Law School]] and also Professor of Art at [[Stanford University]], putting aside the discrepancy presented by Rudenstine, argues that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognisable. [[Sultan]] [[Selim III]] was grateful to the British for repelling [[Napoleon]]ic expansion, and unlike his ancestor [[Mehmet II]], the Parthenon marbles had no sentimental value to him.<ref name=\"guardian faq\"/> Further, that written permission exists in the form of the firman, which is the most formal kind of permission available from that government, and that Elgin had further permission to export the marbles, legalises his (and therefore the British Museum's) claim to the Marbles.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" /> He does note, though, that the clause concerning the extent of Ottoman authorisation to remove the marbles \"is at best ambiguous\", adding that the document \"provides slender authority for the massive removals from the Parthenon&nbsp;...&nbsp;The reference to 'taking away any pieces of stone' seems incidental, intended to apply to objects found while excavating. That was certainly the interpretation privately placed on the firman by several of the Elgin party, including Lady Elgin. Publicly, however, a different attitude was taken, and the work of dismantling the sculptures on the Parthenon and packing them for shipment to England began in earnest. In the process, Elgin's party damaged the structure, leaving the Parthenon not only denuded of its sculptures but further ruined by the process of removal. It is certainly arguable that Elgin exceeded the authority granted in the firman in both respects\".<ref name=\"NafzigerPaterson2010\">{{cite book|author1=James A. R.

''The Guardian'' has written that many among those who support repatriation imply that the marbles would be displayed in their original position on the Parthenon.<ref name=\"guardian faq\"/> However, the Greek plan is to transfer them from a museum in London to one in Athens.

He stated that he had obtained a [[firman (decree)|firman]] from the [[Sultan]] which allowed his artists to access the site, but he was unable to produce the original documentation. However, Elgin presented a document claimed to be an English translation of an [[Italian language|Italian]] copy made at the time. This document is now kept in the British Museum.<ref>St Clair, William: Lord Elgin and the Marbles. Oxford University Press, US, 3 edition (1998)</ref> Its authenticity has been questioned, as it lacked the formalities characterising edicts from the sultan. Vassilis Demetriades, Professor of Turkish Studies at the University of Crete, has argued that \"any expert in Ottoman diplomatic language can easily ascertain that the original of the document which has survived was not a firman\".<ref name=firman/> The document was recorded in an appendix of an 1816 parliamentary committee report. [https://archive.org/details/gri_33125008272383/page/n40 <!-- pg=35 quote=lord elgin testified 1816 british parliamentary committee. --> 'The committee permission'] had convened to examine a request by Elgin asking the British government to purchase the Marbles. The report said that the document<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parthenon.newmentor.net/firman.htm|title=firman|work=newmentor.net}}</ref> in the appendix was an accurate translation, in English, of an Ottoman firman dated July 1801. In Elgin's view it amounted to an Ottoman authorisation to remove the marbles. The committee was told that the original document was given to Ottoman officials in Athens in 1801. Researchers have so far failed to locate it despite the fact that firmans, being official decrees by the Sultan, were meticulously recorded as a matter of procedure, and that the Ottoman archives in Istanbul still hold a number of similar documents dating from the same period.<ref name=Nation/>\n\nThe parliamentary record shows that the Italian copy of the firman was not presented to the committee by Elgin himself but by one of his associates, the clergyman Rev. [[Philip Hunt (priest)|Philip Hunt]]. Hunt, who at the time resided in Bedford, was the last witness to appear before the committee and stated that he had in his possession an Italian translation of the Ottoman original. He went on to explain that he had not brought the document, because, upon leaving Bedford, he was not aware that he was to testify as a witness. The English document in the parliamentary report was filed by Hunt, but the committee was not presented with the Italian translation in Hunt's possession. William St. Clair, a contemporary biographer of Lord Elgin, said he possessed Hunt's Italian document and \"vouches for the accuracy of the English translation\". The committee report states on page 69 \"(Signed with a signet.) Seged Abdullah Kaimacan\" - however, the document presented to the committee was \"an English translation of this purported translation into Italian of the original ''firman''\",<ref>{{cite book |first=Kate Fitz |last=Gibbon |title=Who Owns the Past?: Cultural Policy, Cultural Property, and the Law |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2005 |page=115 }}</ref> and had neither signet nor signature on it, a fact corroborated by St. Clair.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\">{{cite journal |first=David |last=Rudenstine |title=Did Elgin cheat the Marbles? |journal=[[The Nation]]}}</ref> The 1967 study by British historian William St. Clair, ''Lord Elgin and the Marbles,'' stated the sultan did not allow the removal of statues and reliefs from the Parthenon.

According to non-restitutionalists, further evidence that the removal of the sculptures by Elgin was approved by the Ottoman authorities is shown by a second firman which was required for the shipping of the marbles from [[Piraeus]].<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">{{cite book |first=John Henry |last=Merryman |chapter=Whither the Elgin Marbles? |title=Imperialism, Art And Restitution |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 }}</ref>\n\nMany have questioned the legality of Elgin's actions, including the legitimacy of the documentation purportedly authorising them. A study by Professor [[David Rudenstine]] of the [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]] concluded that the premise that Elgin obtained legal title to the marbles, which he then transferred to the British government, \"is certainly not established and may well be false\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rudenstine |first=David |title=The Legality of Elgin's Taking: A Review Essay of Four Books on the Parthenon Marbles |journal=International Journal of Cultural Property |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=356\u2013376 }}</ref> Rudenstine's argumentation is partly based on a translation discrepancy he noticed between the surviving Italian document and the English text submitted by Hunt to the parliamentary committee. The text from the committee report reads \"We therefore have written this Letter to you, and expedited it by Mr. Philip Hunt, an English Gentleman, Secretary of the aforesaid Ambassador\" but according to the St. Clair Italian document the actual wording is \"We therefore have written this letter to you and expedited it by N.N.\". In Rudenstine's view, this substitution of \"Mr. Philip Hunt\" with the initials \"N.N.\" can hardly be a simple mistake. He further argues that the document was presented after the committee's insistence that some form of Ottoman written authorisation for the removal of the marbles be provided, a fact known to Hunt by the time he testified. Thus, according to Rudenstine, \"Hunt put himself in a position in which he could simultaneously vouch for the authenticity of the document and explain why he alone had a copy of it fifteen years after he surrendered the original to Ottoman officials in Athens\". On two earlier occasions, Elgin stated that the Ottomans gave him written permissions more than once, but that he had \"retained none of them.\" Hunt testified on March 13, and one of the questions asked was \"Did you ever see any of the written permissions which were granted [to Lord Elgin] for removing the Marbles from the Temple of Minerva?\" to which Hunt answered \"yes\", adding that he possessed an Italian translation of the original firman. Nonetheless, he did not explain why he had retained the translation for 15 years, whereas Elgin, who had testified two weeks earlier, knew nothing about the existence of any such document.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\" />\n\nEnglish travel writer [[Edward Daniel Clarke]], an eyewitness, wrote that the [[Dizdar]], the Ottoman fortress commander on the scene, attempted to stop the removal of the metopes but was bribed to allow it to continue.<ref name=\"Edward Daniel Clarke 1818 223ff\">{{Cite book|author=Edward Daniel Clarke |title= Travels in various Countries of Europe, Asia and Africa Part the Second Greece Egypt and the Holy Land Section the Second Fourth Edition Volume the Sixth |publisher=T. Cadell |location=London |year=1818 |page= 223ff}}</ref> \nIn contrast, John Merryman, Sweitzer Professor of Law at [[Stanford Law School]] and also Professor of Art at [[Stanford University]], putting aside the discrepancy presented by Rudenstine, argues that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognisable. [[Sultan]] [[Selim III]] was grateful to the British for repelling [[Napoleon]]ic expansion, and unlike his ancestor [[Mehmet II]], the Parthenon marbles had no sentimental value to him.<ref name=\"guardian faq\"/> Further, that written permission exists in the form of the firman, which is the most formal kind of permission available from that government, and that Elgin had further permission to export the marbles, legalises his (and therefore the British Museum's) claim to the Marbles.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" /> He does note, though, that the clause concerning the extent of Ottoman authorisation to remove the marbles \"is at best ambiguous\", adding that the document \"provides slender authority for the massive removals from the Parthenon&nbsp;...&nbsp;The reference to 'taking away any pieces of stone' seems incidental, intended to apply to objects found while excavating. That was certainly the interpretation privately placed on the firman by several of the Elgin party, including Lady Elgin. Publicly, however, a different attitude was taken, and the work of dismantling the sculptures on the Parthenon and packing them for shipment to England began in earnest. In the process, Elgin's party damaged the structure, leaving the Parthenon not only denuded of its sculptures but further ruined by the process of removal. It is certainly arguable that Elgin exceeded the authority granted in the firman in both respects\".<ref name=\"NafzigerPaterson2010\">{{cite book|author1=James A. R.

''The Guardian'' has written that many among those who support repatriation imply that the marbles would be displayed in their original position on the Parthenon.<ref name=\"guardian faq\"/> However, the Greek plan is to transfer them from a museum in London to one in Athens. These arguments are perhaps complicated a little by the completion of the new [[Acropolis Museum]] in 2009, where the half not removed by Elgin is now displayed, aligned in orientation and within sight of the [[Parthenon]], with the position of the missing elements clearly marked and space left should they be returned to [[Athens]].<ref name=\"acrop museum\"/>\n\nThe Trustees of the British Museum make the following statement on the Museum website in response to arguments for the relocation of the Elgin Marbles to the Acropolis Museum: \"The Acropolis Museum allows the Parthenon sculptures that are in Athens to be appreciated against the backdrop of ancient Greek and Athenian history. This display does not alter the Trustees\u2019 view that the sculptures are part of everyone\u2019s shared heritage and transcend cultural boundaries.

International organisations such as [[UNESCO]] and the [[International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures]], as well as campaign groups such as, [[Marbles Reunited]], and stars of Hollywood, such as [[George Clooney]] and [[Matt Damon]], as well as Human Rights activists, lawyers, and the people of the arts, voiced their strong support for the return of the Elgin Marbles to Greece.\n\nAmerican actor George Clooney voiced his support for the return by the United Kingdom and reunification of the Parthenon Marbles in Greece, during his promotional campaign for his 2014 film ''[[The Monuments Men]]'' which retells the story of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] efforts to save important masterpieces of art and other culturally important items before their destruction by [[Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] during [[World War II]].
