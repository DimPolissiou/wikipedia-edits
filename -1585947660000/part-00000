Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 which means the town of god, boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were about 400 Jain temples. The ancient Jain temples of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka\u2019s blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of Jain temples in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the Jain temples at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].<ref>Sharma, Suresh K.; Sharma, Usha (2004), Cultural and Religious Heritage of India: Jainism, Mittal Publications, {{ISBN|978-81-7099-957-7}}</ref><ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samprati Samprati - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <br>\nDelwara, Nagda and Aayad were the centers of learning and culture before 15th century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to Nagda. Today only 25 % of the original town remains.<ref> Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><br>\nAs on 2017, three main Jain temples remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of Rishabhdevbhagwan and one of Parshvnathbhagwan. Jain temples at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, Rishabhdev and Parshvnath. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 Tirthankara with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen Vidya-devis (goddesses of knowledge) are carved on the ceiling. <br>\n=== Why Jain temples at [[Mt. Abu]] are called Dilwara Jain temples? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the Solanki rulers of Gujaratvisited these temples during 11th and 13th centuries ADand were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the Jain temples. Vimal Shah,the minister, governor of Chandravati and commander in chief of Bhimadev I (1022-64), the Solanki ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near Mount Abu which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. The temple is known as Vimal Vasahi (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at Chandravati (near Abu road). Later, in 1230, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 Vastupal and Tejpal, both ministers of a Virdhaval, the Vaghela ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara.

The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of Dhrangadhara (Halvad), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473-1509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar.

Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, Rishabhdev and Parshvnath. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 Tirthankara with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations.

Vimal Shah,the minister, governor of Chandravati and commander in chief of Bhimadev I (1022-64), the Solanki ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near Mount Abu which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. The temple is known as Vimal Vasahi (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at Chandravati (near Abu road). Later, in 1230, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 Vastupal and Tejpal, both ministers of a Virdhaval, the Vaghela ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the Jain temples designed after Vimal Vasahi temples near Abu.

Due to differences with the other queen over succession to the throne of Jalore, she returned to her father\u2019s place, Delwara. Since Rao Bhim Singh, did not have any male child, his grandson Sagar, a Deora Chauhan, ascended the throne of Delwara.<ref> Seth Rajmal Lalwani; Sukhsampat Raj Bhandari and others (1939).

He was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan. Raja Sagar was blessed with three sons - Bohitya, Gangadas and Jaisingh. Whenever there was invasion from Muslims, Rana Jaitra Singh (1213-53) called Raja Sagar for help in the battle. Raja Sagar always came along with army and fought valiantly against the invading Muslims.<ref>Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980). Karamchandra Vanshavali Prabandh (Sanskrit / Hindi).

While he ensured full protection for Jaitra Singh, as Delwada\u2019s army fought fearlessly alongside Mewar army. Iltutmish destroyed temples after temples in and around Nagda and Delwara.

However, when Jaitra Singh was cornered, he was secretly sheltered in one of the houses in Nagda. Iltutmish was furious and encircled Nagda. Every house was searched, burnt and destroyed. In 14th century, according to a mythological tradition of offeringwater tribute to the martyrs of Bhutalghati, a lake was built at Nagda and christened as BaaghelaTaalab.\u201d There is another bard that says, Maharana Mokal built this lake in memory of his brother Baagh Singh.''</blockquote>\n===Raja Bohitya sacrifices his life for Mewar===\nRaja Sagar's son Raja Bohitya was also brave and intelligent like his father and ruled Delwara during the time of Rawal Samar Singh (1273-1302) and Rana Ratan Singh (1302-1303). Once, apprehending danger to his life from the Muhammadans, Bohitya sought refuge in a Jain Temple at Delwara. It is believed that he was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.<ref name=autogenerated1>Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat.

After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn\u2019t find one. The prince\u2019s leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref> Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref>\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. Both Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326-64), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999). Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan.

Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near Kumbhalgarh) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14th Century the soldiers of RanaShree Karan looted the treasury of Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk while his army was on a passage through Aravalli\u2019s from Delhi to Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983).

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all hisbrothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d''<ref> Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980). Karamchandra Vanshavali Prabandh (Sanskrit / Hindi).

He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc to the King of Gurjar \u2013 Patan (Anhilpur) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to Chittor to settle down. Later his descendant Bachhraj became Dewan of Jodhpur and founding Dewan of Bikaner. Bachhraj\u2019s descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, the Kingdom of Mewar was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with Badi Sadri and Gogunda. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15th Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of Dhrangadhara (Halvad), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473-1509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. <br> \nAjja fought alongside Maharana Sangram Singh I (1509-1527) against Babur in 1527 at the Battle of Khanwa. When Maharana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> <br>\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14th century till Jhalas came in 15th century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao? Were they descendants of Raja Sagar?

In his research, he was particularly interested in the history of [[Wallonia]]. \n\nHis contribution to Medieval History is well known, and his books and articles are used today in many medieval history classes.<ref>([http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/research/srwhms.html], [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~history/facdata/examreading/Medieval_History_3010.pdf])</ref>\n\nIn 1963, persuaded of the academic value of interdisciplinarity, he established a Centre for Rural History (''Centre d'Histoire Rurale'') and later still a Centre for Historical Ecology (''Centre d'\u00e9cologie historique''), inviting historians to work together with geographers, agronomers, and other specialists in [[Earth Sciences]] in the newly established ''Institut Interfacultaire d'\u00c9tudes M\u00e9di\u00e9vales'' (better known as the ''Institut d'\u00c9tudes M\u00e9di\u00e9vales'').\n\nIn 1972 he decided to start publishing a series of small monographs under the title ''Typologie des sources du Moyen \u00c2ge occidental'' (\"typology of sources for the Western Middle Ages\"), devising the editorial plan and writing an introductory volume the same year. The whole of this collection has acquired enormous academic prestige and has continued to be published by [[Brepols]]. This collection was to serve a scholarly base of [[Medieval studies|medievalists]] ranging from graduate students to professors and has become one of the most successful collections of introductory and bibliographical aids ever presented to the academic community of medieval history scholars. By publishing three to four titles a year, the series has steadily grown to seventy-eight volumes, covering everything in medieval studies and culture, from necrological documents to Latin treatises on the virtues and the vices, from [[History_of_astronomy#Medieval_Western_Europe|astronomy]] to [[List of medieval weapons|arms]] and [[armour]].<ref>http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/v041/41.1devries.html</ref>\n\n===Political activism===\nGenicot was a Catholic and a political militant on behalf of the [[Walloon Movement]] who had been a member of ''R\u00e9novation wallone'' and a candidate for ''[[Rassemblement wallon]]'' in the [[European Parliament|European elections]]. As a politician, in 1995, by the time of his demise, his patriotic views had become gradually more regionalistic, favouring either an independent Wallonia or its integration into France.\n\n== Awards, Honours and Distinctions ==\nIn 1964, he received the \"Guaillarde d'Argent\"<ref>http://www.ville.namur.be/pericles/evenemen/wallonie01/08-2.htm</ref> and in 1982, he received an honorary degree from the [[Catholic University of Lublin]].<ref>http://www.kul.lublin.pl/art_158.html</ref> In 1988, he was awarded the prize \"Personnalit\u00e9 Richelieu\" by the Belgium and Luxembourg branch of \"Richelieu International\".<ref>http://www.dmnet.be/richelieu/main/fr/pgstfr/persofr.html</ref>\n\nHe was the father of the architectural historian Luc-Francis Genicot (1938-2007), and the great uncle of [[Garance Genicot]].\n\n== Publications ==\nSee [https://web.archive.org/web/20060904134710/http://library.stanford.edu/depts/ssrg/medieval/typ.html], [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~history/facdata/examreading/Medieval_History_3010.pdf], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060103082042/http://www.fltr.ucl.ac.be/FLTR/ARKE/CHAB/Accueil.html].\n\n;Monographs\nThis is a partial list of the monographs Genicot published.\n* ''[https://opac.kbr.be/Library/doc/SYRACUSE/18285216/histoire-des-routes-belges-depuis-1704 Histoire des routes belges depuis 1704]'', Bruxelles: Office de publicit\u00e9, 1948.\n* ''[https://bib.uclouvain.be/opac/ucl/fr/chamo/chamo%3A252185?i=184 Principe de Critique Historique]''. 5th ed.

{"title_page": "87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), CEF", "text_new": "The '''87th Battalion ([[The Canadian Grenadier Guards|Canadian Grenadier Guards]]), CEF''' was a Household Foot Guards Infantry unit in the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] during the [[World War I|First World War]]. Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized Sept. 15, 1915, as an exclusively CGG formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began Oct. 23, 1915.  \n\n<br />\n\n== Unit distinctions & Achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n<br />\n\n* '''CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.'''\n\n* '''The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada.''' (The other 2 were R.C.R., and P.P.C.L.I.)\n\n* '''The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War.''' ''The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77<sup>th</sup> Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF.\u00a0 The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4<sup>th</sup> & 7<sup>th</sup> \u2019Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF.\u00a0 But these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.''\n\n* '''Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by HM King George V in 1919 as a permanent distinction''' in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n\n* '''87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918.''' Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n\n== Unit Milestones ==\n\n=== Mobilization & England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|Empress of Britain]] on April 23rd, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5th, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27th at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 16') and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and 4 drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13th, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & Casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel|Battle of Mount Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF|1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment) CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (Later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced & indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning Aug. 18, 1916 in the Ypres area.\u00a0 Their first casualties, 2 wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26th, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16th, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 35 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n\nSomme 1916\n\n\nVimy Ridge\n<br />\n==Officers Commanding==\n\n*Lieut.-Col.

The Cathedral is the regimental church of the [[Canadian Grenadier Guards]] and houses The Guards' retired regimental colours.\n\n\n'''87th Battalion Vimy Cross - First Memorial''' - (1917) , '''CGG Armoury, Montreal Canada''' - Unveiled on 16 September, 1917 by MGen Sir David Watson. The memorial was constructed by Pioneer Sgt C.G. Durrant and bears the names of 217 of the 87th Battalion who were killed or died of wounds during the period of 1 February to 30 June, 1917. \n\n\n'''[[Canadian National Vimy Memorial]]''' - (1936) Inscribed on the outside wall of the monument are the names of the 11,285 Canadians killed in France whose final resting place is unknown. King Edward VIII unveiled it on 26 July 1936 in the presence of French President Albert Lebrun and a crowd of over 50,000 people, including 6,200 attendees from Canada. Following an extensive multi-year restoration, Queen Elizabeth II re-dedicated the monument on 9 April 2007 at a ceremony commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle. 18 original 87th Battalion (CGG) members participated in the 1936 Vimy Ridge pilgrimage. Approximately 22 members of The Canadian Grenadier Guards (and associates) attended the 100th Anniversary in 2017.\n\n\n'''87th Battalion Panel - [[Menin Gate]] Ypres.''' The memorial is a covered archway with a bridge over the moat that surrounds the city. Inside, and on the stairwells on either side, there are panels for the names of the 56,000 soldiers, approximately 6,983 Canadians, without known graves. When the memorial was inaugurated in 1926 the Brigadier who gave the opening speech addressed those that had no grave to mourn and said \u201che is not missing, he is here\u201d \n\n'''Alter Frontal - [[St Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul's Cathederal]], London, England''' - (1919) - The Frontal was used for the first time on Sunday 6 July 1919, at the national service of thanksgiving for peace at the end of the war in the presence of the King and Queen and many of the 138 soldiers from the UK, Canada, South Africa and Australia who had made it.

It extends from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] [[United States]] in the south and west to western [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Upstate New York]] in the east and northward through [[Southern Ontario]] into southwestern [[Quebec]] in [[Canada]]. It is the most populated and largest megalopolis in North America.\n\nAt its most inclusive, in the United States the region cuts a wide swath from the [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] in [[Minnesota]] to [[Rochester, New York]], while on the Canadian side, it extends northeast to [[Quebec City]]. To the south, the region is considered to extend to urban areas in the [[Ohio River]] valley. Within the broad region, there is a core area that includes [[Chicago]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], [[Detroit]], [[Cleveland]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], and [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] to [[Toronto]]. The total region, extending from Minneapolis/St. Paul to Chicago to Quebec City had an estimated population of 59,144,461 as of 2011, making it the most populous megalopolis on the continent. It is projected to reach a population of approximately 65 million by 2025.\n\n==History of the concept==\n[[File:Railway and shipping routes for the Georgian Bay Ship Canal.jpg|thumb|1907 Canadian major internal and cross border shipping routes]]\n[[File:MapofEmergingUSMegaregions.png|thumb|right|<center> Map of the emerging American-Canadian megaregions as defined by America 2050.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.america2050.org/2006/01/beyond-megalopolis-exploring-a.html|title=Beyond Megalopolis: Exploring America's New \"Megapolitan\" Geography - America 2050|author=|date=|work=america2050.org|accessdate=8 July 2016}}</ref> This interpretation excludes the eastern part of the Windsor-Quebec City urban corridor from the Great Lakes Megalopolis.</center>]]\nThe region was partially outlined as an emergent megalopolis in the 1961 book ''Megalopolis: The Urbanized Northeastern Seaboard of the United States'' by [[France|French]] [[geography|geographer]] [[Jean Gottmann]].

The region also contains large public universities such as [[The Ohio State University]], [[Indiana University]], [[Purdue University]], and [[Michigan State University]].\n\n==Major land and marine transportation corridors==\nThe Great Lakes Megalopolis includes the following major inter-urban corridors that are provided with freeway and passenger rail service in both the ''core'' and ''fringe'' areas of the mega-region.  Major waterways for shipping and cruising are also indicated where applicable.  Amtrak in the United States and Via Rail in Canada offer rail passenger service, while most [[Railroad classes|Class I]] freight rail services also connect these points. A major rail shipping service in both Canada and the United States is provided on tracks owned by [[Canadian National Railway Company]].\n\n===Chicago-Minneapolis/St. Paul===\nThis corridor occupies the northwestern fringe of the megalopolis. It occupies northern [[Illinois]], southern [[Wisconsin]], and parts of eastern [[Minnesota]]. Interstate Highway 94 ([[I-94]]) and [[Amtrak]] rail run roughly parallel from [[Chicago]], IL to [[Minneapolis/St. Paul]], MN by way of [[Milwaukee]], WI and [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison, WI]].\n\n===Chicago-St. Louis===\n[[I-55]], Amtrak, and the [[Illinois Waterway]] connect Chicago, IL to [[St. Louis]], MO.\n\n===Chicago-Indianapolis-Cincinnati===\n[[I-65]] extends from the Chicago area southeast to [[Indianapolis]] IN, where [[I-74]] travels through to [[Cincinnati]], OH.  Amtrak runs regular service along this same route.\n\n===Chicago-Buffalo-Rochester===\n[[I-90]] and Amtrak run approximately parallel through the core area of the megalopolis from Chicago to Cleveland, OH  via [[South Bend]], IN and [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], OH, then into the eastern fringe area comprising [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Rochester, NY|Rochester]], NY.  Amtrak also has a passenger rail link from Cleveland to [[Pittsburgh]], PA which is roughly paralleled by I-76.  The main water route deviates well to the north of the land route from Chicago to Detroit.  It runs north along Lake Michigan, east through the Straits of Mackinac, then south along Lake Huron, the [[St. Clair River]], and [[Lake St Clair]] to the [[Detroit River]]. From this point, the water route roughly parallels the land route to Rochester by way of [[Lake Erie]], the [[Welland Canal]], and [[Lake Ontario]].\n\n===Chicago-Detroit===\nI-94 takes a more northerly route than I-90 through the megalopolis core area east of Chicago.  It extends from that city to the west end of the [[Windsor-Quebec City Corridor]] by way of [[Kalamazoo]], [[Ann Arbor]], [[Detroit]], and [[Port Huron]] MI/[[Sarnia]] ON. This interstate freeway is also paralleled by Amtrak rail service.  The main water route is the same as for the western part of the Chicago-Rochester water corridor from Lake Michigan to the Detroit River.\n\n===Windsor-Quebec City===\nThe core area of the Great Lakes megalopolis extends as far northeast as Toronto in Ontario, Canada. The remainder of the [[Quebec City\u2013Windsor Corridor|Windsor-Quebec City Corridor]] northeast of Toronto lies along the northeastern fringe of the megaregion.  The entire Canadian section of the broader megaregion is sometimes considered a separate megalopolis.  Key freeways include [[Highway 401]] and [[Highway 417 (Ontario)|Highway 417]] in [[Ontario]] which connect with [[Quebec Autoroute 20|Autoroute 20]] and [[Quebec Autoroute 40|Autoroute 40]] respectively in [[Quebec]]. [[Highway 416]] and [[Quebec Autoroute 50|Autoroute 50]] link the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]] with Highway 401 and the Montreal area respectively, but the two freeways do not link directly with each other across the Ontario-Quebec border.  Passenger rail service is provided in both provinces by the [[Via Rail]] [[Qu\u00e9bec City\u2013Windsor Corridor (Via Rail)|Corridor Service]].  Intermediate points along the corridor include [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[St. Catharines, Ontario|St. Catharines]], [[Toronto]], [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Ottawa]], and [[Montreal]].  The main water shipping route is the same as for the eastern part of the Chicago-Rochester corridor, starting at the Detroit River but continuing east beyond Lake Ontario along the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] to [[Quebec City]] and the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]]. Toronto, Hamilton, St. Catharines, and [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]] in Canada and [[Niagara Falls, New York]] and Buffalo in the United States also form an almost continuous urban area.\n\n==Secondary land or marine transportation corridors==\nSeveral corridors have interstate highways but no comprehensive passenger rail service. These highway routes pass through both core and fringe areas of the Great Lakes megalopolis. The upper Great lakes region has a marine corridor that connects Lakes Superior, Huron, and Michigan.  However, this route does not include parallel Amtrak passenger rail or interstate highway service.\n\n===Kansas City-Pittsburgh===\n[[I-70]] follows the southern fringe of the megaregion. It runs from Kansas City, MO to just south of [[Pittsburgh]], PA  by way of St. Louis, MO, Indianapolis, IN, and Columbus, OH.\n\n===Detroit-Grand Rapids===\n[[Interstate 96]] serves traffic between the Detroit and Grand Rapids metro areas. The route passes through [[Lansing]] on the way and extends to [[Muskegon]] to the northwest of Grand Rapids\n\n===Evansville-Indianapolis-Port Huron===\n[[I-69]] extends from [[Evansville]], IN to [[Martinsville, Indiana|Martinsville]], IN.  From there, the route is temporarily an arterial highway, Indiana state route 37, to the I-465 ring-road around Indianapolis, IN.  From there, I-69 resumes and continues to the west end of the Windsor-Quebec City Corridor which carries the route into southern Ontario and southern Quebec provinces.  Intermediate points include [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], IN, [[Lansing]], [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], and Port Huron, MI/Sarnia, ON.\n\n===Cincinnati-Saginaw===\n[[I-75]] runs from [[Saginaw]], MI  to [[Cincinnati]], OH by way of Detroit, MI, Toledo, OH, Lima, OH, and Dayton, OH.\n\n===Duluth-Lake Huron===\nThe waterway connecting [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] MN and western [[Lake Superior]] to points east and south includes the [[Soo Locks]] connecting to [[Lake Huron]], then south to [[Port Huron]] MI/[[Sarnia]] ON or through the [[Straits of Mackinac]] to the metropolitan areas around [[Lake Michigan]].\n\n==Selected American and Canadian population centers==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It extends from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] [[United States]] in the south and west to western [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Upstate New York]] in the east and northward through [[Southern Ontario]] into southwestern [[Quebec]] in [[Canada]]. It is the most populated and largest megalopolis in North America.\n\nAt its most inclusive, in the United States the region cuts a wide swath from the [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] in [[Minnesota]] to [[Rochester, New York]], while on the Canadian side, it extends northeast to [[Quebec City]]. To the south, the region is considered to extend to urban areas in the [[Ohio River]] valley. Within the broad region, there is a core area that includes [[Chicago]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], [[Detroit]], [[Cleveland]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], and [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] to [[Toronto]]. The total region, extending from Minneapolis to Chicago to Quebec City had an estimated population of 59,144,461 as of 2011, making it the most populous megalopolis on the continent. It is projected to reach a population of approximately 65 million by 2025.\n\n==History of the concept==\n[[File:Railway and shipping routes for the Georgian Bay Ship Canal.jpg|thumb|1907 Canadian major internal and cross border shipping routes]]\n[[File:MapofEmergingUSMegaregions.png|thumb|right|<center> Map of the emerging American-Canadian megaregions as defined by America 2050.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.america2050.org/2006/01/beyond-megalopolis-exploring-a.html|title=Beyond Megalopolis: Exploring America's New \"Megapolitan\" Geography - America 2050|author=|date=|work=america2050.org|accessdate=8 July 2016}}</ref> This interpretation excludes the eastern part of the Windsor-Quebec City urban corridor from the Great Lakes Megalopolis.</center>]]\nThe region was partially outlined as an emergent megalopolis in the 1961 book ''Megalopolis: The Urbanized Northeastern Seaboard of the United States'' by [[France|French]] [[geography|geographer]] [[Jean Gottmann]].

The region also contains large public universities such as [[The Ohio State University]], [[Indiana University]], [[Purdue University]], and [[Michigan State University]].\n\n==Major land and marine transportation corridors==\nThe Great Lakes Megalopolis includes the following major inter-urban corridors that are provided with freeway and passenger rail service in both the ''core'' and ''fringe'' areas of the mega-region.  Major waterways for shipping and cruising are also indicated where applicable.  Amtrak in the United States and Via Rail in Canada offer rail passenger service, while most [[Railroad classes|Class I]] freight rail services also connect these points. A major rail shipping service in both Canada and the United States is provided on tracks owned by [[Canadian National Railway Company]].\n\n===Chicago-Minneapolis/St. Paul===\nThis corridor occupies the northwestern fringe of the megalopolis. It occupies northern [[Illinois]], southern [[Wisconsin]], and parts of eastern [[Minnesota]]. Interstate Highway 94 ([[I-94]]) and [[Amtrak]] rail run roughly parallel from [[Chicago]], IL to [[Minneapolis/St. Paul]], MN by way of [[Milwaukee]], WI and [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison, WI]].\n\n===Chicago-St. Louis===\n[[I-55]], Amtrak, and the [[Illinois Waterway]] connect Chicago, IL to [[St. Louis]], MO.\n\n===Chicago-Indianapolis-Cincinnati===\n[[I-65]] extends from the Chicago area southeast to [[Indianapolis]] IN, where [[I-74]] travels through to [[Cincinnati]], OH.  Amtrak runs regular service along this same route.\n\n===Chicago-Buffalo-Rochester===\n[[I-90]] and Amtrak run approximately parallel through the core area of the megalopolis from Chicago to Cleveland, OH  via [[South Bend]], IN and [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], OH, then into the eastern fringe area comprising [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Rochester, NY|Rochester]], NY.  Amtrak also has a passenger rail link from Cleveland to [[Pittsburgh]], PA which is roughly paralleled by I-76.  The main water route deviates well to the north of the land route from Chicago to Detroit.  It runs north along Lake Michigan, east through the Straits of Mackinac, then south along Lake Huron, the [[St. Clair River]], and [[Lake St Clair]] to the [[Detroit River]]. From this point, the water route roughly parallels the land route to Rochester by way of [[Lake Erie]], the [[Welland Canal]], and [[Lake Ontario]].\n\n===Chicago-Detroit===\nI-94 takes a more northerly route than I-90 through the megalopolis core area east of Chicago.  It extends from that city to the west end of the [[Windsor-Quebec City Corridor]] by way of [[Kalamazoo]], [[Ann Arbor]], [[Detroit]], and [[Port Huron]] MI/[[Sarnia]] ON. This interstate freeway is also paralleled by Amtrak rail service.  The main water route is the same as for the western part of the Chicago-Rochester water corridor from Lake Michigan to the Detroit River.\n\n===Windsor-Quebec City===\nThe core area of the Great Lakes megalopolis extends as far northeast as Toronto in Ontario, Canada. The remainder of the [[Quebec City\u2013Windsor Corridor|Windsor-Quebec City Corridor]] northeast of Toronto lies along the northeastern fringe of the megaregion.  The entire Canadian section of the broader megaregion is sometimes considered a separate megalopolis.  Key freeways include [[Highway 401]] and [[Highway 417 (Ontario)|Highway 417]] in [[Ontario]] which connect with [[Quebec Autoroute 20|Autoroute 20]] and [[Quebec Autoroute 40|Autoroute 40]] respectively in [[Quebec]]. [[Highway 416]] and [[Quebec Autoroute 50|Autoroute 50]] link the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]] with Highway 401 and the Montreal area respectively, but the two freeways do not link directly with each other across the Ontario-Quebec border.  Passenger rail service is provided in both provinces by the [[Via Rail]] [[Qu\u00e9bec City\u2013Windsor Corridor (Via Rail)|Corridor Service]].  Intermediate points along the corridor include [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[St. Catharines, Ontario|St. Catharines]], [[Toronto]], [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Ottawa]], and [[Montreal]].  The main water shipping route is the same as for the eastern part of the Chicago-Rochester corridor, starting at the Detroit River but continuing east beyond Lake Ontario along the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] to [[Quebec City]] and the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]]. Toronto, Hamilton, St. Catharines, and [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]] in Canada and [[Niagara Falls, New York]] and Buffalo in the United States also form an almost continuous urban area.\n\n==Secondary land or marine transportation corridors==\nSeveral corridors have interstate highways but no comprehensive passenger rail service. These highway routes pass through both core and fringe areas of the Great Lakes megalopolis. The upper Great lakes region has a marine corridor that connects Lakes Superior, Huron, and Michigan.  However, this route does not include parallel Amtrak passenger rail or interstate highway service.\n\n===Kansas City-Pittsburgh===\n[[I-70]] follows the southern fringe of the megaregion. It runs from Kansas City, MO to just south of [[Pittsburgh]], PA  by way of St. Louis, MO, Indianapolis, IN, and Columbus, OH.\n\n===Detroit-Grand Rapids===\n[[Interstate 96]] serves traffic between the Detroit and Grand Rapids metro areas. The route passes through [[Lansing]] on the way and extends to [[Muskegon]] to the northwest of Grand Rapids\n\n===Evansville-Indianapolis-Port Huron===\n[[I-69]] extends from [[Evansville]], IN to [[Martinsville, Indiana|Martinsville]], IN.  From there, the route is temporarily an arterial highway, Indiana state route 37, to the I-465 ring-road around Indianapolis, IN.  From there, I-69 resumes and continues to the west end of the Windsor-Quebec City Corridor which carries the route into southern Ontario and southern Quebec provinces.  Intermediate points include [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], IN, [[Lansing]], [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], and Port Huron, MI/Sarnia, ON.\n\n===Cincinnati-Saginaw===\n[[I-75]] runs from [[Saginaw]], MI  to [[Cincinnati]], OH by way of Detroit, MI, Toledo, OH, Lima, OH, and Dayton, OH.\n\n===Duluth-Lake Huron===\nThe waterway connecting [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] MN and western [[Lake Superior]] to points east and south includes the [[Soo Locks]] connecting to [[Lake Huron]], then south to [[Port Huron]] MI/[[Sarnia]] ON or through the [[Straits of Mackinac]] to the metropolitan areas around [[Lake Michigan]].\n\n==Selected American and Canadian population centers==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
