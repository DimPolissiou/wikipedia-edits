An exception was made for the Los Angeles City Hall, built in 1928, which stands at {{convert|454|ft|m|0}}. This effectively limited the height of non-government buildings to 13 stories, and was intended to address local concerns about growing congestion and over development at the time. That height limit was lifted in Downtown Los Angeles by the city government in 1957.\n\nLos Angeles (and especially Downtown) then went through a large building boom that lasted from the early 1960s to the early 1990s, during which time the city saw the completion of 23 of its 30 tallest buildings, including the U.S. Bank Tower, the [[Aon Center (Los Angeles)|Aon Center]], and [[Two California Plaza]].<ref name=\"highrises\">{{cite web|title=High-rise Buildings of Los Angeles |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/bu/sk/?id=101029 |publisher=Emporis.com |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229044545/http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/bu/sk/?id=101029 |archivedate=February 29, 2008}}</ref> Modern skyscrapers are difficult and expensive to construct in Los Angeles due to the city's high rate of [[earthquake]]s and position near the [[San Andreas fault]] line, as well as the resulting difficulty of adhering to the city's rigorous engineering standards. Nevertheless, a number of successful and iconic skyscrapers dot the Los Angeles skyline from Downtown Los Angeles through [[Koreatown, Los Angeles|Koreatown]], along the [[Wilshire Boulevard|Wilshire Corridor]] and [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles|Miracle Mile]], and in [[Century City, Los Angeles|Century City]] and other areas of the city's west side.

An exception was made for the Los Angeles City Hall, built in 1928, which stands at {{convert|454|ft|m|0}}. This effectively limited the height of non-government buildings to 13 stories, and was intended to address local concerns about growing congestion and over development at the time. That height limit was lifted in Downtown Los Angeles by the city government in 1957.\n\nLos Angeles (and especially Downtown) then went through a large building boom that lasted from the early 1960s to the early 1990s, during which time the city saw the completion of 23 of its 30 tallest buildings, including the U.S. Bank Tower, the [[Aon Center (Los Angeles)|Aon Center]], and [[Two California Plaza]].<ref name=\"highrises\">{{cite web|title=High-rise Buildings of Los Angeles |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/bu/sk/?id=101029 |publisher=Emporis.com |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229044545/http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/bu/sk/?id=101029 |archivedate=February 29, 2008}}</ref> Modern skyscrapers are difficult and expensive to construct in Los Angeles due to the city's high rate of [[earthquake]]s and position near the [[San Andreas fault]] line, as well as the resulting difficulty of adhering to the city's rigorous engineering standards.

The company designs, develops, manufactures, and sells [[personal computer]]s, [[tablet computer]]s, [[Lenovo smartphones|smartphones]], [[workstation]]s, [[server (computing)|servers]], [[electronic storage]] devices, IT management software, and [[smart TV|smart televisions]]. Lenovo is the [[market share of personal computer vendors|world's largest personal computer vendor]] by unit sales, as of March 2019. It markets the [[ThinkPad]] and [[ThinkBook]] business lines of notebook computers; [[IdeaPad]], [[Lenovo Yoga|Yoga]], and Legion consumer lines of notebook laptops; and the [[IdeaCentre]] and [[ThinkCentre]] lines of desktops.\n\nLenovo has operations in more than 60 countries and sells its products in around 160 countries. Lenovo's principal facilities are in Beijing and [[Morrisville, North Carolina|Morrisville]] ([[North Carolina]], U.S.), with research centers in Beijing, [[Shanghai]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Xiamen]], [[Chengdu]], [[Nanjing]], [[Wuhan]], [[Yamato, Kanagawa|Yamato]] ([[Kanagawa Prefecture]], Japan), and Morrisville. It also has a joint venture with [[NEC]], Lenovo NEC Holdings, which produces personal computers for the Japanese market.\n\nLenovo was founded in Beijing in November 1984 as '''Legend''' and was incorporated in [[Hong Kong]] in 1988. Lenovo acquired [[IBM]]'s personal computer business in 2005 and agreed to acquire its Intel-based server business in 2014. Lenovo entered the smartphone market in 2012 and as of 2014 was the largest vendor of smartphones in Mainland China. In 2014, Lenovo acquired the mobile phone handset maker [[Motorola Mobility]] from [[Google]]. In 2017, Lenovo acquired [[Fujitsu]]'s personal computer business.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/11995/lenovo-to-acquire-controlling-stake-of-fujitsus-pc-business|title=Lenovo to Acquire Controlling Stake of Fujitsu's PC Business|first=Anton|last=Shilov|website=www.anandtech.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fujitsu-strategy-idUSKBN18X13P|title=Fujitsu to reach agreement \"soon\" on integrating PC business with Lenovo|date=6 June 2017|via=www.reuters.com}}</ref>\n\nLenovo is listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] and is a constituent of the [[Hang Seng China-Affiliated Corporations Index]], often referred to as \"[[Red Chip]]s\".\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Early Years===\n[[Liu Chuanzhi]] along with a group of ten [[engineer]]s (all in their middle age) founded Lenovo on 1 November 1984 in Beijing with 200,000 yuan. The Chinese government approved Lenovo's incorporation on the same day. Ji\u01ce X\u00f9f\u00fa (\u8d3e\u7eed\u798f), one of the founders of Lenovo, indicates the first meeting in preparation for starting the company was held on 17 October of the same year. Eleven people, the entirety of the initial staff, attended. Each of the founders was a member of the Institute of Computing Technology attached to the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]. The 200,000 yuan used as start-up capital was approved by Z\u0113ng M\u00e0och\u00e1o (\u66fe\u8302\u671d). The name for the company agreed upon at this meeting was the Chinese Academy of Sciences Computer Technology Research Institute New Technology Development Company.<ref name=book1/>\n\nTheir first significant effort, an attempt to import televisions, failed. The group rebuilt itself within a year by conducting quality checks on computers for new buyers. Lenovo soon started developing a circuit board that would allow IBM-compatible personal computers to process Chinese characters. This product was Lenovo's first major success. Lenovo also tried and failed to market a digital watch. Liu said, \"Our management team often differed on which commercial road to travel. This led to big discussions, especially between the engineering chief and myself. He felt that if the quality of the product was good, then it would sell itself. But I knew this was not true, that marketing and other factors were part of the eventual success of a product.\" The fact that its staff had little business experience compounded Lenovo's early difficulties. \"We were mainly scientists and didn't understand the market\", Liu said. \"We just learned by trial-and-error, which was very interesting\u2014but also very dangerous\", said Liu. In 1990, Lenovo started to manufacture and market computers using its own brand name.<ref name=\"chief\">{{cite news |title=China's High-Tech Hero |author=Dickie, Mure |newspaper=Chief Executive |date=1 January 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1988, Lenovo placed its first recruitment advertisement. The ad was placed on the front page of the ''China Youth News''. Such ads were quite rare in China then. Out of the 500 respondents, 280 were selected to take a written employment exam. 120 of these candidates were interviewed in person. Although interviewers initially only had authority to hire 16 people, 58 were given offers. The new staff included 18 people with graduate degrees, 37 with undergraduate degrees, and three students with no university-level education. Their average age was 26. [[Yang Yuanqing]], the current CEO of Lenovo, was among that group.<ref name=book1/>\n\nLiu Chuanzhi received government permission to form a subsidiary in Hong Kong and to move there along with five other employees. Liu's father, already in Hong Kong, furthered his son's ambitions through mentoring and facilitating loans. Liu moved to Hong Kong in 1988. To save money during this period, Liu and his co-workers walked instead of taking public transportation. To keep up appearances, they rented hotel rooms for meetings.<ref name=book1/>\n\n===IPO, second offerings, and bond sales===\nLenovo became publicly traded after a 1994 Hong Kong listing that raised nearly US$30 million. Prior to its IPO, many analysts were optimistic about Lenovo. The company was praised for its good management, strong brand recognition, and growth potential. Analysts also worried about Lenovo's profitability. Lenovo's IPO was massively over-subscribed. On its first day of trading, the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America and Australia, to expand and improve production and research and development, and to increase working capital.<ref name=book1/>\n\nWhen Lenovo was first listed, its managers thought the only purpose of going public was to raise capital. They had little understanding of the rules and responsibilities that went along with running a public company. Before Lenovo conducted its first secondary offering in 1997, Liu proudly announced the company's intent to mainland newspapers only to have its stock halted for two days by regulators to punish his statement. This occurred several times until Liu learned that he had to choose his words carefully in public. The first time Liu traveled to Europe on a \"roadshow\" to discuss his company's stock, he was shocked by the skeptical questions he was subjected to and felt offended. Liu later came to understand that he was accountable to shareholders. He said, \"Before I only had one boss, but CAS never asked me anything. I relied on my own initiative to do things. We began to think about issues of credibility. Legend began to learn how to become a truly international company.\"<ref name=book1/>\n\nTo fund its continued growth, Lenovo issued a secondary offering of 50 million shares on the Hong Kong market in March 2000 and raised about US$212 million.<ref name=book1/>\n\n[[Mary Ma]], Lenovo's chief financial officer from 1990 to 2007, was in charge of investor relations. Under her leadership, Lenovo successfully integrated Western-style accountability into its corporate culture. Lenovo's emphasis on transparency earned it a reputation for the best corporate governance among mainland Chinese firms. All major issues regarding its board, management, major share transfers, and mergers and acquisitions were fairly and accurately reported. While Hong Kong-listed firms were only required to issue financial reports twice per year, Lenovo followed the international norm of issuing quarterly reports. Lenovo created an audit committee and a compensation committee with non-management directors. The company started roadshows twice per year to meet institutional investors. Ma organized the first-ever investor relations conference held in Mainland China. The conference was held in Beijing in 2002 and televised on CCTV. Liu and Ma co-hosted the conference and both gave speeches on corporate governance.<ref name=book1/>\n\n[[File:Lenovo logo (English).svg|thumb|Former Lenovo logo, used from 2003 until 2015]]\nIn May 2015, Lenovo revealed a new logo at Lenovo Tech World in Beijing, with the slogan \"Innovation Never Stands Still\" ({{zh|c=\u521b\u65b0\u65e0\u6b62\u5883}}). Lenovo's new logo, created by Saatchi, New York, can be changed by its advertising agencies and sales partners, within restrictions, to fit the context. It has a lounging \"e\" and is surrounded by a box that can be changed to use a relevant scene, solid color, or photograph. Lenovo's Chief Marketing Officer David Roman said, \"When we first started looking at it, it wasn't about just a change in typography or the look of the logo. We asked 'If we really are a net-driven, customer-centric company, what should the logo look like?' We came up with the idea of a digital logo first \u2026 designed to be used on the internet and adaptable to context.\"<ref name=\"AALogo\">{{cite news |last=Snyder Bulik |first=Beth |date=28 May 2015 |title=Worldwide PC Leader Lenovo Rebrands For Post-PC World\n|url=http://adage.com/article/digital/lenovo-rebrands-logo-renewed-post-pc-push/298773/ |newspaper=Advertising Age |location=United States |access-date=8 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn early June 2015, Lenovo announced plans to sell up to US$650 million in five-year bonds denominated in Chinese yuan. The bonds will be sold in Hong Kong with coupon ranging from 4.95% to 5.05%. This is only the second sale of bonds in Lenovo's history. Financial commentators noted that Lenovo was paying a premium to list the bonds in yuan given relatively low costs for borrowing in American dollars.<ref name=\"Bonds1\">{{cite news |last=Trivedi |first=Anjani |date=3 June 2015 |title=Lenovo Heats Up Hong Kong's Dim-Sum Bond Market |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/lenovo-heats-up-hong-kongs-dim-sum-bond-market-1433327598 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |location=United States |access-date=8 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Tianxi===\nThe Tianxi computer was designed to make it easy for inexperienced Chinese consumers to use computers and access the Internet.

It had a pastel-colored, shell-shaped case and a seven-port USB hub under its screen. As of 2000, the Tianxi was the best-selling computer in Chinese history. It sold more than 1,000,000 units in 2000 alone.<ref name=\"Tianxi\">{{cite news |last=Sima |first=Katherine |date=19 December 2005 |title=Lenovo's design strategy drives success |url=http://www.plasticsnews.com/article/20051219/NEWS/312199974/lenovo-s-design-strategy-drives-success |newspaper=Plastics News |location=United States |access-date=7 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships===\nLenovo works to integrate the management of each newly acquired company into its larger culture. Lenovo has a dedicated mergers and acquisitions team that tracks the progress of these integrations.

Lenovo Chief Technology Officer George He said that vertical integration is having an important role in product development.

Some people have said we are a state-owned enterprise. It's 100% not true. In 1984 the Chinese Academy of Sciences only invested $25,000 in our company. The purpose of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to invest in this company was that they wanted to commercialize their research results. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is a pure research entity in China, owned by the government. From this point, you could say we're different from state-owned enterprises. Secondly, after this investment, this company is run totally by the founders and management team. The government has never been involved in our daily operation, in important decisions, strategic direction, nomination of the CEO and top executives and financial management. Everything is done by our management team.\"<ref name=\"state\">{{cite news |title=Q&A; Chinese Computer Giant Showcases Capitalist Credentials; Chairman of Lenovo, which acquired IBM's PC unit, says the firm has few government ties |author= |url= |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=4 May 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2006, the U.S. State Department was harshly criticized for purchasing 16,000 computers from Lenovo. Critics argued that Lenovo was controlled by the Chinese government and a potential vehicle for espionage against the United States. Yang spoke out forcefully and publicly to defend Lenovo. He said, \"We are not a government-controlled company.\" He pointed out that Lenovo pioneered China's transition to a market economy and that in the early 1990s had fought and beaten four state-owned enterprises that dominated the Chinese computer market. Those firms had the full backing of the state while Lenovo received no special treatment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2006-04-19/lenovos-foreign-affairs|title=Lenovo's Foreign Affairs|first=Steve|last=Hamm|date=20 April 2006|url-access=subscription }}</ref> The State Department deal went through. Yang worried that fears about Lenovo's supposed connections to the Chinese government would be an ongoing issue in the United States. Yang worked to ease worries by communicating directly with Congress.\n\nYang dramatically increased his ownership stake by acquiring 797 million shares in 2011. As of June 2011, Yang owned an 8 percent stake in Lenovo. He previously owned only 70 million shares. In a statement, Yang said, \"While the transaction is a personal financial matter, I want to be very clear that my decision to make this investment is based on my strong belief in the company's very bright future. Our culture is built on commitment and ownership&nbsp;\u2013 we do what we say, and we own what we do.

While the company was founded using seed capital from the state-owned [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], it is run as a private enterprise with little or no interference by the state. Lenovo's senior executives, including many non-Chinese, rotate between two head offices, one in Beijing and the other in Morrisville, North Carolina, and Lenovo's research and development center in Japan. Two foreigners have previously served as Lenovo's CEO.<ref name=Econ1/>\n\nEnglish is Lenovo's official language. Lenovo's CEO, Yang Yuanqing, initially did not understand English well, but relocated his family to Morrisville to improve his language skills and learn American ways. One American Lenovo executive interviewed by ''The Economist'' praised Yang for his efforts to make Lenovo a friendly place for foreigners to work. He said that Yang had created a \"performance culture\" in place of the traditional Chinese work style of \"waiting to see what the emperor wants\".<ref name=Econ1/>\n\n===Leadership===\n\n====Yang Yuanqing====\n[[File:Yang Yuanqing.jpeg|thumb|Yang Yuanqing, Lenovo's Chairman and CEO]]\n{{Main|Yang Yuanqing}}\nYang Yuanqing is the chairman and chief executive officer of Lenovo.

Yang was chairman of Lenovo's board from 2004 to 2008, and returned as chairman in 2012 alongside his role as CEO.\n\nIn 2012, Yang received a $3 million bonus as a reward for record profits, which he in turn redistributed to about 10,000 of Lenovo's employees. According to Lenovo spokesman, Jeffrey Shafer, Yang felt that it would be the right thing to, \"redirect [the money] to the employees as a real tangible gesture for what they done.\" Shafer also said that Yang, who owns about eight percent of Lenovo's stock, \"felt that he was rewarded well simply as the owner of the company.\"<ref name=\"Bonus\">{{cite news |title=CEO of Lenovo Gives $3 Million in Bonuses to Employees |first=Lyneka |last=Little |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2012/07/ceo-of-lenovo-gives-3-million-in-bonuses-to-employees/ |newspaper=ABC News |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref> The bonuses were mostly distributed among staff working in positions such as production and reception who received an average of 2,000 yuan or about US$314.

Liu was trained as an engineer at a military college and later went on to work at the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]. Like many young people during the Cultural Revolution, Liu was denounced and sent to the countryside where he worked as a laborer on a rice farm. Liu claims [[Hewlett-Packard]] as a key source of inspiration. In an interview with ''[[The Economist]]'' he stated that \"Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.\" For more than ten years, Lenovo was Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China.<ref name=\"Economist\">{{cite news |title=Face value: Legend in the making |author= |url=http://www.economist.com/node/780748 |newspaper=The Economist |date=15 September 2001 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref> In reference to Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, \"I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable. Impossible.\"<ref name=\"chief\"/>\n\n====Board of directors====\nIn early 2013, Lenovo announced the addition of Yahoo founder [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Yang]] to its board. Lenovo's CEO Yang Yuanqing said, \"Jerry's appointment as an observer to our board furthers Lenovo's reputation as a transparent international company.\" Just prior to the appointment of Jerry Yang, Tudor Brown, the founder of British semiconductor design firm [[ARM Holdings|ARM]], was also appointed to Lenovo's board. Speaking of both men Yang Yuanqing said, \"We believe that they will add a great deal to our strategic thinking, long-term direction and, ultimately, our ability to achieve our aspirations in the PC plus era.\"\n\n==Marketing and sponsorships==\n\n===Emerging markets===\nIn 2009, Lenovo became the first personal computer manufacturer to divide countries into emerging markets and mature markets. Lenovo then developed a different set of strategies for each category. Lenovo's competitors have widely adopted the same approach<ref name=\"People\"/>\n\nIn 2012, Lenovo made a major effort to expand its market share in developing economies such as Brazil and India through acquisitions and increased budgets for marketing and advertising. While Lenovo has not revealed its total spending on marketing, it did increase marketing and advertising expenditures by $248 million in the fiscal year ending in 2012.<ref name=Econ1/>\n\n====China====\n[[File:A Lenovo Store in China.jpg|thumb|upright|A Lenovo Store in China]]\nIn China, Lenovo has a vast distribution network designed to make sure that there is at least one shop selling Lenovo computers within 50 kilometers of nearly all consumers. Lenovo has also developed close relationships with its Chinese distributors, who are granted exclusive territories and only carry Lenovo products.<ref name=Econ1/>\n\nAs of July 2013, Lenovo believes that urbanization initiatives being pushed by Premier [[Li Keqiang]] will allow it to sustain sales growth in China for the foreseeable future. Speaking at Lenovo's annual general meeting in Hong Kong in 2013, Yang Yuanqing said: \"I believe urbanisation will help us further increase the overall [domestic] PC market.\" Yang also stressed the opportunity presented by the China's relatively low penetration rate of personal computers. Lenovo previously benefited from the Chinese government's rural subsidies, part of a wider economic stimulus initiative, designed to increase purchases of appliances and electronics. That program, which Lenovo joined in 2004, ended in 2011. Lenovo enjoys consistent price premiums over its traditional competitors in rural markets and a stronger local sales and service presence.<ref name=\"FT2\">{{cite web |last=Hille |first=Kathrin |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/da66ab1e-e9fe-11e2-b2f4-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2Yk2jG67n |title=Lenovo optimistic about China's economy |publisher=FT.com |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}</ref>\n\n====India====\nLenovo has gained significant market share in India through bulk orders to large companies and government agencies. For example, the government of [[Tamil Nadu]] ordered a million laptops from Lenovo in 2012 and single-handedly made the firm a market leader. Lenovo distributes most of the personal computers it sells in India through five national distributors such as [[Ingram Micro]] and Redington.<ref name=\"India6\"/>\n\nGiven that most smartphones and tablets are sold to individuals Lenovo is pursuing a different strategy making use of many small state-centric distributors. Amar Babu, Lenovo's managing director for India, said, \"To reach out to small towns and the hinterland, we have tied up with 40 regional distributors. We want our distributors to be exclusive to us. We will, in turn, ensure they have exclusive rights to distribute Lenovo products in their catchment area.\"<ref name=\"India6\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-03-26/news/38040354_1_million-smartphones-lenovo-india-amar-babu |work=The Times Of India |title=Can Lenovo protect its leadership in PCs & gain share in mobile, tablet businesses in India? |date=26 March 2013}}</ref> As of 2013, Lenovo had about 6,000 retailers selling smartphones and tablets in India. In February 2013, Lenovo established a relationship with Reliance Communications to sell smartphones. The smartphones carried by Reliance have dual-SIM capability and support both GSM and CDMA. Babu claims that the relative under penetration of smartphones in India represents an opportunity for Lenovo.<ref name=\"India6\"/>\n\nLenovo has assembled a team of senior managers familiar with the Indian market, launched mobile phones at all price points there, and worked on branding to build market share. As of February 2014, Lenovo claims that its sales of smartphones in India have been increasing 100% per quarter while the market is only growing 15-20% over the same period. Lenovo did marketing tests of its smartphones in November 2012 in [[Gujarat]] and some southern cities, where Lenovo already had a strong presence. Lenovo's strategy has been to create awareness, maintain a broad selection of phones at all price points, and develop distribution networks. Lenovo partnered with two national distributors and over 100 local distributors. As of February 2014, more than 7,000 retail outlets in India sold Lenovo smartphones. Lenovo has also partnered with HCL in order to set up 250 service centres in 110 cities.<ref name=\"India1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/lenovo-creates-a-big-mobile-buzz/1228658?rheditorpick|title=Lenovo creates a big mobile buzz|first=Sudhir|last=Chowdhary|work=The Financial Express}}</ref>\n\nIn India, Lenovo grants distributors exclusive territories but allows them to sell computers from other companies. Lenovo uses its close relationships with distributors to gain [[market intelligence]] and speed up product development.\n\nLenovo reported a year-on-year increase of about 951% in tablet sales in India for the first quarter of 2014. Canalys, a market research firm, said Lenovo took market share away from Apple and Samsung in the country.<ref name=\"IndiaGrowth\">{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/business/item/36827-the-tech-business-week-len|title=The tech business week: Lenovo to double Irish workforce, Duolog opens Texas offices|work=Silicon Republic}}</ref>\n\n====Africa====\nLenovo first started doing business in [[South Africa]], establishing a sales office, and then expanded to East African markets such as Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Rwanda. West Africa followed when Lenovo set-up a Nigerian legal office and then expanded to Ghana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Botswana.\n\nAccording to Lenovo's general manager for Africa, Graham Braum, Lenovo's strategy is to put \"great emphasis on products that sell well in Africa\" and roll out \"products alongside different African governments' rolling out of wireless technology\". Products such as the Lenovo Yoga series are popular in Africa because of their long battery life, as many areas have unreliable electrical supply. Other popular products include the Lenovo netbooks, which were introduced in 2008.<ref name=dexing>{{cite news |last=Dexing |first=Qin |date=2015-02-13 |title=Lenovo Expands to Africa |url=http://www.ecns.cn/business/2015/02-13/154889.shtml |newspaper=ECNS.com |access-date=2015-03-09}}</ref>\n\nLenovo picked Nigeria in 2013 to release its smartphone because unlike South Africa and other African countries, there is no requirement to partner with a local telecom firm to sell its phones.<ref name=\"Africa1\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-09/lenovo-will-debut-first-africa-smartphone-in-nigeria-by-year-end.html |work=Bloomberg |first=Chris |last=Spillane |title=Lenovo Plans to Debut Africa Smartphone in Nigeria This Year |date=10 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the long term, according to Braum, \"Lenovo in Africa will focus on continuing to consistently supply personal computer products and allow this market to grow, while moving into new territory such as mobile and enterprise.\"<ref name=dexing/>\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, Lenovo began the \"For Those Who Do\" marketing campaign in 2010, created by the ad agency [[Saatchi & Saatchi]]. The campaign was Lenovo's first to go global, except for its domestic market in China, where it retained its existing \"Imagine\" ([[Pinyin]]: ''lian xiang'') slogan.

David Roman, Lenovo's chief marketing officer, said, \"His partnership goes beyond traditional bounds by deeply integrating him into our organization as a product engineer. Ashton will help us break new ground by challenging assumptions, bringing a new perspective and contributing his technical expertise to Yoga Tablet and other devices.\" Kutcher co-founded [[A-Grade Investments]], an investor in [[Airbnb]], [[Foursquare City Guide|Foursquare]], [[Spotify]], [[Path (social network)|Path]], [[Uber]], and other technology firms.

Lenovo will receive advertising space in NFL venues and events and be allowed to use the NFL logo on its products and ads. Lenovo said that this sponsorship would boost its efforts to market to the key 18- to 35-year-old male demographic.\n\nThe NFL has been a Lenovo customer since 2007 and the sponsorship resulted from that relationship. NFL stars [[Jerry Rice]], [[DeAngelo Williams]], and [[Torry Holt]] were on hand for the announcement and a celebration with 1,500 Lenovo employees. Lenovo's sponsorship will last at least three years.<ref name=\"NFL\">{{cite news |title=Lenovo becomes an NFL sponsor |first=David |last=Ranii |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/07/25/2220073/lenovo-joins-team-nfl.html#storylink=misearch |newspaper=News Observer |date=25 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===''The Pursuit''===\nLenovo used a short-film entitled ''The Pursuit'' in its \"For Those Who Do\" campaign launched in 2011. The film depicted a mysterious young woman using the IdeaPad Yoga 13 to stay one-step-ahead of her evil pursuers. [[Martin Campbell]], who previously worked on action movies and James Bond films such as GoldenEye and the remake of Casino Royale, shot this film. Lenovo was the first Chinese company to make use of such marketing techniques.<ref name=\"Big1\"/>\n\n===Tech World===\nIn May 2015, Lenovo hosted its first ever \"Tech World\" conference in Beijing. The CEOs of [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Baidu]] delivered keynote addresses along with Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing. Lenovo also used Tech World to announce a refresh of its corporate logo and visual identity. The shift in Lenovo's visual presentation was accompanied by changes in Lenovo's business model.

Goodweird is designed to convey the idea that designs that seem strange initially often become familiar and widely accepted. The Goodweird campaign includes a video with famous images of early attempts to fly with the aid of homemade wings and a bicycle that transitions to a modern-day shot of a man soaring across mountains in a wingsuit before transitioning again to a shot of the [[Stealth Bomber]]. Lenovo worked with three agencies on Goodweird: London-based DLKW Low, We Are Social, and Blast Radius. Goodweird is part of Lenovo's wider strategy to appeal to millennials with an emphasis on design trendsetters. A portion of the funding for Goodweird is being directed to prominent [[YouTubers]] and Viners.

This process occurs even on clean installations of Windows. It was found that this program had been automatically installed using a new feature in [[Windows 8]], [[Features new to Windows 8#Windows Platform Binary Table|Windows Platform Binary Table]], which allows executable files to be stored within UEFI firmware for execution on startup, and is meant to \"allow critical software to persist even when the operating system has changed or been reinstalled in a 'clean' configuration\"; specifically, anti-theft security software.

Lenovo is the [[market share of personal computer vendors|world's largest personal computer vendor]] by unit sales, as of March 2019. It markets the [[ThinkPad]] and [[ThinkBook]] business lines of notebook computers; [[IdeaPad]], [[Lenovo Yoga|Yoga]], and Legion consumer lines of notebook laptops; and the [[IdeaCentre]] and [[ThinkCentre]] lines of desktops.\n\nLenovo has operations in more than 60 countries and sells its products in around 160 countries. Lenovo's principal facilities are in Beijing and [[Morrisville, North Carolina|Morrisville]] ([[North Carolina]], U.S.), with research centers in Beijing, [[Shanghai]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Xiamen]], [[Chengdu]], [[Nanjing]], [[Wuhan]], [[Yamato, Kanagawa|Yamato]] ([[Kanagawa Prefecture]], Japan), and Morrisville. It also has a joint venture with [[NEC]], Lenovo NEC Holdings, which produces personal computers for the Japanese market.\n\nLenovo was founded in Beijing in November 1984 as '''Legend''' and was incorporated in [[Hong Kong]] in 1988. Lenovo acquired [[IBM]]'s personal computer business in 2005 and agreed to acquire its Intel-based server business in 2014. Lenovo entered the smartphone market in 2012 and as of 2014 was the largest vendor of smartphones in Mainland China. In 2014, Lenovo acquired the mobile phone handset maker [[Motorola Mobility]] from [[Google]]. In 2017, Lenovo acquired [[Fujitsu]]'s personal computer business.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/11995/lenovo-to-acquire-controlling-stake-of-fujitsus-pc-business|title=Lenovo to Acquire Controlling Stake of Fujitsu's PC Business|first=Anton|last=Shilov|website=www.anandtech.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fujitsu-strategy-idUSKBN18X13P|title=Fujitsu to reach agreement \"soon\" on integrating PC business with Lenovo|date=6 June 2017|via=www.reuters.com}}</ref>\n\nLenovo is listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] and is a constituent of the [[Hang Seng China-Affiliated Corporations Index]], often referred to as \"[[Red Chip]]s\".\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Early Years===\n[[Liu Chuanzhi]] along with a group of ten [[engineer]]s (all in their middle age) founded Lenovo on 1 November 1984 in Beijing with 200,000 yuan. The Chinese government approved Lenovo's incorporation on the same day. Ji\u01ce X\u00f9f\u00fa (\u8d3e\u7eed\u798f), one of the founders of Lenovo, indicates the first meeting in preparation for starting the company was held on 17 October of the same year. Eleven people, the entirety of the initial staff, attended. Each of the founders was a member of the Institute of Computing Technology attached to the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]. The 200,000 yuan used as start-up capital was approved by Z\u0113ng M\u00e0och\u00e1o (\u66fe\u8302\u671d). The name for the company agreed upon at this meeting was the Chinese Academy of Sciences Computer Technology Research Institute New Technology Development Company.<ref name=book1/>\n\nTheir first significant effort, an attempt to import televisions, failed. The group rebuilt itself within a year by conducting quality checks on computers for new buyers. Lenovo soon started developing a circuit board that would allow IBM-compatible personal computers to process Chinese characters. This product was Lenovo's first major success. Lenovo also tried and failed to market a digital watch. Liu said, \"Our management team often differed on which commercial road to travel. This led to big discussions, especially between the engineering chief and myself. He felt that if the quality of the product was good, then it would sell itself. But I knew this was not true, that marketing and other factors were part of the eventual success of a product.\" The fact that its staff had little business experience compounded Lenovo's early difficulties. \"We were mainly scientists and didn't understand the market\", Liu said. \"We just learned by trial-and-error, which was very interesting\u2014but also very dangerous\", said Liu. In 1990, Lenovo started to manufacture and market computers using its own brand name.<ref name=\"chief\">{{cite news |title=China's High-Tech Hero |author=Dickie, Mure |newspaper=Chief Executive |date=1 January 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1988, Lenovo placed its first recruitment advertisement. The ad was placed on the front page of the ''China Youth News''. Such ads were quite rare in China then. Out of the 500 respondents, 280 were selected to take a written employment exam. 120 of these candidates were interviewed in person. Although interviewers initially only had authority to hire 16 people, 58 were given offers. The new staff included 18 people with graduate degrees, 37 with undergraduate degrees, and three students with no university-level education. Their average age was 26. [[Yang Yuanqing]], the current CEO of Lenovo, was among that group.<ref name=book1/>\n\nLiu Chuanzhi received government permission to form a subsidiary in Hong Kong and to move there along with five other employees. Liu's father, already in Hong Kong, furthered his son's ambitions through mentoring and facilitating loans. Liu moved to Hong Kong in 1988. To save money during this period, Liu and his co-workers walked instead of taking public transportation. To keep up appearances, they rented hotel rooms for meetings.<ref name=book1/>\n\n===IPO, second offerings, and bond sales===\nLenovo became publicly traded after a 1994 Hong Kong listing that raised nearly US$30 million. Prior to its IPO, many analysts were optimistic about Lenovo. The company was praised for its good management, strong brand recognition, and growth potential. Analysts also worried about Lenovo's profitability. Lenovo's IPO was massively over-subscribed. On its first day of trading, the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America and Australia, to expand and improve production and research and development, and to increase working capital.<ref name=book1/>\n\nWhen Lenovo was first listed, its managers thought the only purpose of going public was to raise capital. They had little understanding of the rules and responsibilities that went along with running a public company. Before Lenovo conducted its first secondary offering in 1997, Liu proudly announced the company's intent to mainland newspapers only to have its stock halted for two days by regulators to punish his statement. This occurred several times until Liu learned that he had to choose his words carefully in public. The first time Liu traveled to Europe on a \"roadshow\" to discuss his company's stock, he was shocked by the skeptical questions he was subjected to and felt offended. Liu later came to understand that he was accountable to shareholders. He said, \"Before I only had one boss, but CAS never asked me anything. I relied on my own initiative to do things. We began to think about issues of credibility. Legend began to learn how to become a truly international company.\"<ref name=book1/>\n\nTo fund its continued growth, Lenovo issued a secondary offering of 50 million shares on the Hong Kong market in March 2000 and raised about US$212 million.<ref name=book1/>\n\n[[Mary Ma]], Lenovo's chief financial officer from 1990 to 2007, was in charge of investor relations. Under her leadership, Lenovo successfully integrated Western-style accountability into its corporate culture. Lenovo's emphasis on transparency earned it a reputation for the best corporate governance among mainland Chinese firms. All major issues regarding its board, management, major share transfers, and mergers and acquisitions were fairly and accurately reported. While Hong Kong-listed firms were only required to issue financial reports twice per year, Lenovo followed the international norm of issuing quarterly reports. Lenovo created an audit committee and a compensation committee with non-management directors. The company started roadshows twice per year to meet institutional investors. Ma organized the first-ever investor relations conference held in Mainland China. The conference was held in Beijing in 2002 and televised on CCTV. Liu and Ma co-hosted the conference and both gave speeches on corporate governance.<ref name=book1/>\n\n[[File:Lenovo logo (English).svg|thumb|Former Lenovo logo, used from 2003 until 2015]]\nIn May 2015, Lenovo revealed a new logo at Lenovo Tech World in Beijing, with the slogan \"Innovation Never Stands Still\" ({{zh|c=\u521b\u65b0\u65e0\u6b62\u5883}}). Lenovo's new logo, created by Saatchi, New York, can be changed by its advertising agencies and sales partners, within restrictions, to fit the context. It has a lounging \"e\" and is surrounded by a box that can be changed to use a relevant scene, solid color, or photograph. Lenovo's Chief Marketing Officer David Roman said, \"When we first started looking at it, it wasn't about just a change in typography or the look of the logo. We asked 'If we really are a net-driven, customer-centric company, what should the logo look like?' We came up with the idea of a digital logo first \u2026 designed to be used on the internet and adaptable to context.\"<ref name=\"AALogo\">{{cite news |last=Snyder Bulik |first=Beth |date=28 May 2015 |title=Worldwide PC Leader Lenovo Rebrands For Post-PC World\n|url=http://adage.com/article/digital/lenovo-rebrands-logo-renewed-post-pc-push/298773/ |newspaper=Advertising Age |location=United States |access-date=8 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn early June 2015, Lenovo announced plans to sell up to US$650 million in five-year bonds denominated in Chinese yuan. The bonds will be sold in Hong Kong with coupon ranging from 4.95% to 5.05%. This is only the second sale of bonds in Lenovo's history. Financial commentators noted that Lenovo was paying a premium to list the bonds in yuan given relatively low costs for borrowing in American dollars.<ref name=\"Bonds1\">{{cite news |last=Trivedi |first=Anjani |date=3 June 2015 |title=Lenovo Heats Up Hong Kong's Dim-Sum Bond Market |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/lenovo-heats-up-hong-kongs-dim-sum-bond-market-1433327598 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |location=United States |access-date=8 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Tianxi===\nThe Tianxi computer was designed to make it easy for inexperienced Chinese consumers to use computers and access the Internet.

It had a pastel-colored, shell-shaped case and a seven-port USB hub under its screen. As of 2000, the Tianxi was the best-selling computer in Chinese history. It sold more than 1,000,000 units in 2000 alone.<ref name=\"Tianxi\">{{cite news |last=Sima |first=Katherine |date=19 December 2005 |title=Lenovo's design strategy drives success |url=http://www.plasticsnews.com/article/20051219/NEWS/312199974/lenovo-s-design-strategy-drives-success |newspaper=Plastics News |location=United States |access-date=7 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships===\nLenovo works to integrate the management of each newly acquired company into its larger culture.

The United States Department of Treasury [[Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States]] (CFIUS) was reportedly the last hurdle for Lenovo, since the United States has the strictest policies.

Some people have said we are a state-owned enterprise. It's 100% not true. In 1984 the Chinese Academy of Sciences only invested $25,000 in our company. The purpose of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to invest in this company was that they wanted to commercialize their research results. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is a pure research entity in China, owned by the government. From this point, you could say we're different from state-owned enterprises. Secondly, after this investment, this company is run totally by the founders and management team. The government has never been involved in our daily operation, in important decisions, strategic direction, nomination of the CEO and top executives and financial management. Everything is done by our management team.\"<ref name=\"state\">{{cite news |title=Q&A; Chinese Computer Giant Showcases Capitalist Credentials; Chairman of Lenovo, which acquired IBM's PC unit, says the firm has few government ties |author= |url= |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=4 May 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2006, the U.S. State Department was harshly criticized for purchasing 16,000 computers from Lenovo. Critics argued that Lenovo was controlled by the Chinese government and a potential vehicle for espionage against the United States. Yang spoke out forcefully and publicly to defend Lenovo. He said, \"We are not a government-controlled company.\" He pointed out that Lenovo pioneered China's transition to a market economy and that in the early 1990s had fought and beaten four state-owned enterprises that dominated the Chinese computer market. Those firms had the full backing of the state while Lenovo received no special treatment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2006-04-19/lenovos-foreign-affairs|title=Lenovo's Foreign Affairs|first=Steve|last=Hamm|date=20 April 2006|url-access=subscription }}</ref> The State Department deal went through. Yang worried that fears about Lenovo's supposed connections to the Chinese government would be an ongoing issue in the United States. Yang worked to ease worries by communicating directly with Congress.\n\nYang dramatically increased his ownership stake by acquiring 797 million shares in 2011. As of June 2011, Yang owned an 8 percent stake in Lenovo. He previously owned only 70 million shares. In a statement, Yang said, \"While the transaction is a personal financial matter, I want to be very clear that my decision to make this investment is based on my strong belief in the company's very bright future. Our culture is built on commitment and ownership&nbsp;\u2013 we do what we say, and we own what we do.

While Lenovo was founded using seed capital from the state-owned [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], Lenovo is run as a private enterprise with little or no interference by the state. Lenovo's senior executives, including many non-Chinese, rotate between two head offices, one in Beijing and the other in Morrisville, North Carolina, and Lenovo's research and development center in Japan. Two foreigners have previously served as Lenovo's CEO.<ref name=Econ1/>\n\nEnglish is Lenovo's official language. Lenovo's CEO, Yang Yuanqing, initially did not understand English well, but relocated his family to Morrisville to improve his language skills and learn American ways. One American Lenovo executive interviewed by ''The Economist'' praised Yang for his efforts to make Lenovo a friendly place for foreigners to work. He said that Yang had created a \"performance culture\" in place of the traditional Chinese work style of \"waiting to see what the emperor wants\".<ref name=Econ1/>\n\n===Leadership===\n\n====Yang Yuanqing====\n[[File:Yang Yuanqing.jpeg|thumb|Yang Yuanqing, Lenovo's Chairman and CEO]]\n{{Main|Yang Yuanqing}}\nYang Yuanqing is the chairman and chief executive officer of Lenovo. One of his major achievements was leading Lenovo to become the best-selling personal computer brand in China since 1997.

Yang was chairman of Lenovo's board from 2004 to 2008, and returned as chairman in 2012 alongside his role as CEO.\n\nIn 2012, Yang received a $3 million bonus as a reward for record profits, which he in turn redistributed to about 10,000 of Lenovo's employees. According to Lenovo spokesman, Jeffrey Shafer, Yang felt that it would be the right thing to, \"redirect [the money] to the employees as a real tangible gesture for what they done.\" Shafer also said that Yang, who owns about eight percent of Lenovo's stock, \"felt that he was rewarded well simply as the owner of the company.\"<ref name=\"Bonus\">{{cite news |title=CEO of Lenovo Gives $3 Million in Bonuses to Employees |first=Lyneka |last=Little |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2012/07/ceo-of-lenovo-gives-3-million-in-bonuses-to-employees/ |newspaper=ABC News |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref> The bonuses were mostly distributed among staff working in positions such as production and reception who received an average of 2,000 yuan or about US$314.

Liu was trained as an engineer at a military college and later went on to work at the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]. Like many young people during the Cultural Revolution, Liu was denounced and sent to the countryside where he worked as a laborer on a rice farm. Liu claims [[Hewlett-Packard]] as a key source of inspiration. In an interview with ''[[The Economist]]'' he stated that \"Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.\" For more than ten years, Lenovo was Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China.<ref name=\"Economist\">{{cite news |title=Face value: Legend in the making |author= |url=http://www.economist.com/node/780748 |newspaper=The Economist |date=15 September 2001 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref> In reference to Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, \"I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable. Impossible.\"<ref name=\"chief\"/>\n\n====Board of directors====\nIn early 2013, Lenovo announced the addition of Yahoo founder [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Yang]] to its board. Lenovo's CEO Yang Yuanqing said, \"Jerry's appointment as an observer to our board furthers Lenovo's reputation as a transparent international company.\" Just prior to the appointment of Jerry Yang, Tudor Brown, the founder of British semiconductor design firm [[ARM Holdings|ARM]], was also appointed to Lenovo's board. Speaking of both men Yang Yuanqing said, \"We believe that they will add a great deal to our strategic thinking, long-term direction and, ultimately, our ability to achieve our aspirations in the PC plus era.\"\n\n==Marketing and sponsorships==\n\n===Emerging markets===\nIn 2009, Lenovo became the first personal computer manufacturer to divide countries into emerging markets and mature markets. Lenovo then developed a different set of strategies for each category. Lenovo's competitors have widely adopted the same approach<ref name=\"People\"/>\n\nIn 2012, Lenovo made a major effort to expand its market share in developing economies such as Brazil and India through acquisitions and increased budgets for marketing and advertising. While Lenovo has not revealed its total spending on marketing, it did increase marketing and advertising expenditures by $248 million in the fiscal year ending in 2012.<ref name=Econ1/>\n\n====China====\n[[File:A Lenovo Store in China.jpg|thumb|upright|A Lenovo Store in China]]\nIn China, Lenovo has a vast distribution network designed to make sure that there is at least one shop selling Lenovo computers within 50 kilometers of nearly all consumers. Lenovo has also developed close relationships with its Chinese distributors, who are granted exclusive territories and only carry Lenovo products.<ref name=Econ1/>\n\nAs of July 2013, Lenovo believes that urbanization initiatives being pushed by Premier [[Li Keqiang]] will allow it to sustain sales growth in China for the foreseeable future. Speaking at Lenovo's annual general meeting in Hong Kong in 2013, Yang Yuanqing said: \"I believe urbanisation will help us further increase the overall [domestic] PC market.\" Yang also stressed the opportunity presented by the China's relatively low penetration rate of personal computers. Lenovo previously benefited from the Chinese government's rural subsidies, part of a wider economic stimulus initiative, designed to increase purchases of appliances and electronics. That program, which Lenovo joined in 2004, ended in 2011. Lenovo enjoys consistent price premiums over its traditional competitors in rural markets and a stronger local sales and service presence.<ref name=\"FT2\">{{cite web |last=Hille |first=Kathrin |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/da66ab1e-e9fe-11e2-b2f4-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2Yk2jG67n |title=Lenovo optimistic about China's economy |publisher=FT.com |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}</ref>\n\n====India====\nLenovo has gained significant market share in India through bulk orders to large companies and government agencies. For example, the government of [[Tamil Nadu]] ordered a million laptops from Lenovo in 2012 and single-handedly made the firm a market leader. Lenovo distributes most of the personal computers it sells in India through five national distributors such as [[Ingram Micro]] and Redington.<ref name=\"India6\"/>\n\nGiven that most smartphones and tablets are sold to individuals Lenovo is pursuing a different strategy making use of many small state-centric distributors. Amar Babu, Lenovo's managing director for India, said, \"To reach out to small towns and the hinterland, we have tied up with 40 regional distributors. We want our distributors to be exclusive to us. We will, in turn, ensure they have exclusive rights to distribute Lenovo products in their catchment area.\"<ref name=\"India6\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-03-26/news/38040354_1_million-smartphones-lenovo-india-amar-babu |work=The Times Of India |title=Can Lenovo protect its leadership in PCs & gain share in mobile, tablet businesses in India? |date=26 March 2013}}</ref> As of 2013, Lenovo had about 6,000 retailers selling smartphones and tablets in India. In February 2013, Lenovo established a relationship with Reliance Communications to sell smartphones. The smartphones carried by Reliance have dual-SIM capability and support both GSM and CDMA. Babu claims that the relative under penetration of smartphones in India represents an opportunity for Lenovo.<ref name=\"India6\"/>\n\nLenovo has assembled a team of senior managers familiar with the Indian market, launched mobile phones at all price points there, and worked on branding to build market share. As of February 2014, Lenovo claims that its sales of smartphones in India have been increasing 100% per quarter while the market is only growing 15-20% over the same period. Lenovo did marketing tests of its smartphones in November 2012 in [[Gujarat]] and some southern cities, where Lenovo already had a strong presence. Lenovo's strategy has been to create awareness, maintain a broad selection of phones at all price points, and develop distribution networks. Lenovo partnered with two national distributors and over 100 local distributors. As of February 2014, more than 7,000 retail outlets in India sold Lenovo smartphones.

West Africa followed when Lenovo set-up a Nigerian legal office and then expanded to Ghana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Botswana.\n\nAccording to Lenovo's general manager for Africa, Graham Braum, Lenovo's strategy is to put \"great emphasis on products that sell well in Africa\" and roll out \"products alongside different African governments' rolling out of wireless technology\". Products such as the Lenovo Yoga series are popular in Africa because of their long battery life, as many areas have unreliable electrical supply.

This process occurs even on clean installations of Windows. It was found that this program had been automatically installed using a new feature in [[Windows 8]], [[Features new to Windows 8#Windows Platform Binary Table|Windows Platform Binary Table]], which allows executable files to be stored within UEFI firmware for execution on startup, and is meant to \"allow critical software to persist even when the operating system has changed or been reinstalled in a 'clean' configuration\"; specifically, anti-theft security software.

He was the grandson of the former [[prime minister]] [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell]] and elder brother of the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]]. He was married three times, lastly to [[Elizabeth von Arnim]], who caricatured him in her novel ''[[Vera (novel)|Vera]]''.<ref>Erica Brown. [http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=155 Literary Encyclopedia: Elizabeth von Arnim (1866\u20131941)].</ref> Despite his landmark achievements in other respects, this Earl Russell is most famous for being tried for [[bigamy]] in the House of Lords in 1901, and was known to Edwardian society as the \"Wicked Earl\".\n\n== Education ==\nRussell proved hard work for his grandparents and was sent to school; first [[Cheam School|Cheam]] (1877) and then [[Winchester College]] (Jan 1879). Winchester became his spiritual home and the friends he made there his surrogate family. It was there that he befriended poet and critic [[Lionel Johnson]], whom he would describe as \u201cthe greatest influence of my life at Winchester\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=My Life and Adventures|last=Russell|first=Earl|publisher=Cassell & Co.|year=1923|isbn=|location=London|pages=89}}</ref> though Johnson was the younger man. When Russell went up to [[Balliol College, Oxford]] in 1883, the pair wrote long, earnest letters to each other in which they explored spiritual matters and questions of sin and morality. Twice the correspondence was banned by Johnson's father who feared that Russell's Buddhist beliefs would have a baneful influence on Johnson's welfare as a Christian. Not to be thwarted, Russell engaged an Oxford friend, [[Charles Edward Sayle]], to correspond with Johnson on his behalf. Johnson also corresponded with Sayle's Rugby friend [[John Haden Badley|Jack Badley]]. In 1919, Russell anonymously published Johnson's side of the correspondence with all three as ''Some Winchester Letters of Lionel Johnson.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Some Winchester Letters of Lionel Johnson|last=Russell|first=Earl|publisher=George Allen & Unwin Ltd|year=1919|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Oxford ==\nAt Balliol, Russell read Classics. The famous Greek scholar [[Benjamin Jowett]] was then Master of Balliol and also Vice-Chancellor of the University.

He also had extramarital affairs.\n\nHis first wife was Mabel Edith Scott, daughter of \"adventuress\" Lady Selina (Lina) Scott and her husband Sir Claude Edward Scott (1840-1880) of the [[Scott baronets|Scott baronets of Lytchet Minster]]. They married in 1890. The marriage was a disaster, lasting only 3 months. Mabel sued to judicially separate from him (and lost) in 1891, accusing him in the process of \"immoral behaviour\" with another university friend, Herbert Ainslie Roberts. Having failed to convince the jury, she subsequently attempted to obtain a separation by indirect means, suing for restitution of conjugal rights in 1894.<ref>Under the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1884]], failure to comply with an order of restitution of conjugal rights served to establish desertion (\"statutory desertion\") which gave the other spouse the right to an immediate decree of [[judicial separation]], and, if coupled with the husband\u2019s [[adultery]], allowed the wife to obtain an immediate [[divorce]].

Mabel appealed and the verdict was overturned. The case went all the way to the House of Lords where the appellate judges denied them both satisfaction, binding the definition of legal cruelty to physical violence and making ''Russell v. Russell'' [2] a case of legal significance for the next 70 years. Russell's mother-in-law also tried to harass him, by distributing 500 statements to members of the Commons and Lords, to relatives, the press and other key figures in society, accusing Russell of sodomy.

Not to be thwarted, Russell engaged an Oxford friend, [[Charles Edward Sayle]], to correspond with Johnson on his behalf.

This hot tempered youth however, brought about his own exile from Melaka when he slew the [[Bendahara]] [[Tun Perak]]'s son for accidentally knocking off his headdress by a misdirected [[sepak raga]] ball.

He was duly installed as Sultan Muhammad Shah in the year 1470.<ref name=\"NST\"/>\n\nThe boundaries of his kingdom stretched from [[Sungai Sedili Besar|Sedili Besar]] to the borders of [[Terengganu]].

Initially appointed as [[heir apparent]] to the [[Melaka Sultanate|Melaka]] throne by his father, [[Mansur Shah of Malacca|Mansur Shah]], he was banished for committing murder following a feud in a [[Sepak Raga]] game and went into exile in Pahang, later installed as its first Sultan in 1470.\n\n==Early life==\nKnown as Raja Muhammad before his accession, he is the second son of the sixth [[Melaka Sultanate|Sultan of Melaka]], [[Mansur Shah]] by his wife Putri Wanang Sri Lela Wangsa, daughter of Maharaja [[Dewa Sura]], ruler of Pahang and a relative of the King of Ligor. Both his mother and grandfather were captured and presented to the Sultan of Melaka after the conquest of Pahang.<ref name=\"Pahang\">{{harvnb|Buyers|2009|loc=[http://www.royalark.net/Malaysia/pahang2.htm Pahang - Genealogy of Melaka dynasty]}}</ref>\n\n==Raja Muda of Melaka==\nAs he is favoured greatly by his father, Raja Muhammad was named as Raja Muda ('heir apparent') to the Melaka throne instead of his elder brother, [[Ahmad Shah I of Pahang|Raja Ahmad]]. This hot tempered youth however, brought about his own exile from Melaka when he slew the [[Bendahara]] [[Tun Perak]]'s son for accidentally knocking off his headdress by a misdirected [[sepak raga]] ball. At pressure from Bendahara family, Raja Muhammad was stripped off from his title and was sent away to Pahang to be its Sultan. This began the Melaka line of royalty on the Pahang throne.<ref name=\"NST\">{{harvnb|Khoo|1980|p=9}}</ref>\n\n==Sultan of Pahang==\nRaja Muhammad brought with him the trappings of the Melakan court to Pahang. He had with him Tun Hamzah, the former governor of Pahang as his first [[Bendahara]], Seri Akar Raja as his chief [[Hulubalang]], a Penghulu Bendahari ('chief treasurer'), a [[Temenggong]] and 100 boys and 100 girls of noble family. He was duly installed as Sultan Muhammad Shah in the year 1470.<ref name=\"NST\"/>\n\nThe boundaries of his kingdom stretched from [[Sungai Sedili Besar|Sedili Besar]] to the borders of [[Terengganu]]. There was evidence to show he settled at Tanjung Lanngar which was the old seat of the former Pahang princes.
