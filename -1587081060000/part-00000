Few studies, however, have examined the challenges that microdosers face. An anonymous, online survey examined both the benefits and challenges of 278 microdosers<ref name=\"Anderson_2019\" />. The benefits that were reported by users were similar to those described in other studies: improved mood, creativity, and improved focus<ref name=\"Anderson_2019\" />. The main challenge (29.5%) among users was concern about the illegality of psychedelic substances and the resulting consequences<ref name=\"Anderson_2019\" />. Subcategories of illegality include worries about perceived social stigma, cost of the substance, and correct dosage<ref name=\"Anderson_2019\" />. Other major challenges for users include psychological discomfort, impaired focus, increased anxiety, and excessive energy<ref name=\"Anderson_2019\" />. Despite the claimed challenges by users, additional randomized control trials are necessary to determine the safety and potential challenges posed by microdosing.\n\n== See also ==\n*

Few studies, however, have examined the challenges that microdosers face. An anonymous, online survey examined both the benefits and challenges of 278 microdosers<ref name=\"Anderson_2019\" />. The benefits that were reported by users were similar to those described in other studies: improved mood, creativity, and improved focus<ref name=\"Anderson_2019\" />. The main challenge (29.5%) among users was concern about the illegality of psychedelic substances and the resulting consequences<ref name=\"Anderson_2019\" />. Subcategories of illegality include worries about perceived social stigma, cost of the substance, and correct dosage<ref name=\"Anderson_2019\" />. Other major challenges for users include psychological discomfort, impaired focus, increased anxiety, and excessive energy<ref name=\"Anderson_2019\" />. Despite the claimed challenges by users, additional randomized control trials are necessary to determine the safety and potential challenges posed by microdosing.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Microdosing]]\n* [[Nootropic]]\n* [[Psychedelics in problem-solving experiment]]\n* [[Psychedelic therapy]]\n* [[Neuropsychopharmacology]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Psychedelic Microdosing}}\n[[Category:Nootropics]]\n[[Category:Psychedelia]]\n[[Category:Psychedelic drug research]]\n", "name_user": "Keith D", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix PMC warnings", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_microdosing"}

In his honor, the home-ground of FK Osogovo is named Nikola Mantov Stadium. The stadium has a capacity of approximately 5,000 spectators. \n\nFK Osogovo has also retired the number 7 shirt in honor of Nikola Mantov.\n\nIn the first season of the Macedonian First Football League in 1992\u201393 Osogovo finished at eighth place; next season they finished at position nine. The highest place in Osogovo history in Macedonian First Football League was in the 1994-95 season, when the team finished at sixth position. Next season (1995\u201396) they finished at 14th place and were relegated to the Macedonian Second Football League. In the next few years, the team was relegated to the lowest division in Macedonian football (Macedonian Third Football League). From the 2004\u201305 to 2010-2011 seasons, Osogovo won the Macedonian Third Football League (East) five times, but played only once in the Macedonian Second Football League, in the 2011\u201312 season. In this season they finished at 14th place and were relegated to Macedonian Third Football League (East). In the last five seasons Osogovo appeared in the Macedonian Third Football League (East) without any success. But in season 2016-17 FK Osogovo finished at 3rd place and promoted to Macedonian Second Football league(East).\n\n==Supporters==\n[[File:Sejmeni in beginings.jpg|thumb|left|Sejmeni in beginings]]\n[[File:Sejmeni attending.jpg|thumb|Sejmeni attending at local rivals Sloga from Vinica]]\n\nSejmeni are an Ultras group founded in 1991, who support FK Osogovo and traditionally occupy the West Stand at the stadium.

In his honor, the home-ground of FK Osogovo is named Nikola Mantov Stadium. The stadium has a capacity of approximately 5,000 spectators. \n\nFK Osogovo has also retired the number 7 shirt in honor of Nikola Mantov.\n\nIn the first season of the Macedonian First Football League in 1992\u201393 Osogovo finished at eighth place; next season they finished at position nine. The highest place in Osogovo history in Macedonian First Football League was in the 1994-95 season, when the team finished at sixth position. Next season (1995\u201396) they finished at 14th place and were relegated to the Macedonian Second Football League. In the next few years, the team was relegated to the lowest division in Macedonian football (Macedonian Third Football League). From the 2004\u201305 to 2010-2011 seasons, Osogovo won the Macedonian Third Football League (East) five times, but played only once in the Macedonian Second Football League, in the 2011\u201312 season. In this season they finished at 14th place and were relegated to Macedonian Third Football League (East). In the last five seasons Osogovo appeared in the Macedonian Third Football League (East) without any success. But in season 2016-17 FK Osogovo finished at 3rd place and promoted to Macedonian Second Football league(East).\n\n==Supporters==\n[[File:Sejmeni in beginings.jpg|thumb|left|Sejmeni in beginings]]\n[[File:Sejmeni attending.jpg|thumb|Sejmeni attending at local rivals Sloga from Vinica]]\n\nSejmeni are an Ultras group founded in 1991, who support FK Osogovo and traditionally occupy the West Stand at the stadium.
