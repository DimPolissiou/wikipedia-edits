This was taking place at the same time that China was beginning to accept free-market capitalism and American businesses were jockeying to establish manufacturing plants in China. The political troubles of the Philippines hindered the entry of foreign investments, and foreign banks stopped granting loans to the Philippine government.\n\nIn an attempt to launch a national economic recovery program and despite his growing isolation from American businesses, Marcos negotiated with foreign creditors including the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], [[World Bank]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), for a restructuring of the country's foreign debts \u2013 to give the Philippines more time to pay the loans. Marcos ordered a cut in government expenditures and used a portion of the savings to finance the ''Sariling Sikap'' (Self-Reliance), a livelihood program he established in 1984.\n\nHowever, the economy continued to shrink despite the government's recovery efforts due to a number of reasons. Most of the so-called government development programs failed to materialize. Government funds were often siphoned off by Marcos or his cronies. American investors were discouraged by the Filipino economic elite who were against the corruption that by now had become endemic in the Marcos regime.<ref name=\"albert\">{{cite book|last1=Celoza|first1=Albert|title=Ferdinand Marcos and the Philippines: The Political Economy of Authoritarianism|date=November 25, 1997|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0275941376}}</ref> The failure of the recovery program was further augmented by civil unrest, rampant graft and corruption within the government, and Marcos's lack of credibility.

Two Americans, namely attorney Richard Hirschfeld and business consultant Robert Chastain, both of whom posed as arms dealers, gained knowledge of a plot by gaining Marcos's trust and secretly tape recorded their conversations with the ousted leader.\n\nAccording to Hirschfeld, he was first invited by Marcos to a party held at the latter's family residence in Oahu, Hawaii. After hearing that one of Hirschfeld's clients was Saudi Sheikh Mohammad Fassi, Marcos's interest was piqued because he had done business with Saudis in the past. A few weeks later, Marcos asked for help with securing a passport from another country, in order to travel back to the Philippines while bypassing travel restrictions imposed by the Philippines and United States governments. This failed, however, and subsequently Marcos asked Hirschfeld to arrange a $10-million loan from Fassi.\n\nOn January 12, 1987, Marcos stated to Hirschfeld that he required another $5-million loan \"in order to pay 10,000 soldiers $500 each as a form of 'combat life insurance.' When asked by Hirschfeld if he was talking about an invasion of the Philippines, Marcos responded, \"Yes.\" Hirschfeld also recalled that the former president said that he was negotiating with several arms dealers to purchase up to $18 million worth of weapons, including tanks and heat-seeking missiles, and enough ammunition to \"last an army three months.\"\n\nMarcos had thought of being flown to his hometown in Ilocos Norte, greeted by his loyal supporters, and initiating a plot to kidnap Corazon Aquino. \u2033What I would like to see happen is we take her hostage,\u2033 Marcos told Chastain. \u2033Not to hurt her ... no reason to hurt her .. to take her.\u2033\n\nLearning of this plan, Hirschfeld contacted the US Department of Justice, and was asked for further evidence.

This practice considerably alienated the support of the old social and economic elite and the media, who criticized the Marcos administration endlessly.<ref>For a detailed treatment of corruption under Marcos, see {{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amZkAdGTkl4C&pg=PA153|title=Corruption and money laundering: a symbiotic relationship|author1=Chaikin, David|author2=Sharman, Jason Campbell|publisher=Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=978-0-230-61360-7|chapter=The Marcos Kleptocracy}}</ref> The old social and economic elite, all of whom relied on trade and agricultural and industrial exports to the United States such as the families of Enrile, Lopez, Cojuangco, and Aquino, sought a free-market economy. At this point, Marcos controlled both the oligarchy and the oligopoly.\n\n====Establishment of Metro Manila====\nWithout the consent of the people of Manila and environs, Marcos merged four neighboring cities and thirteen municipalities into a Metro Manila. Without the consent of residents of the merged cities and municipalities, he appointed his wife, Imelda Marcos as governor of Metro Manila - the second most powerful office in the republic. Given that Metro Manila accounts for around 20% of the country's population, it is estimated to be responsible for at least 70% of gross national receipts. It is the seat of the national government and some 90% of the national government's offices and instrumentalities are located within its environs. Its budget is second to the national government. In the words of Carlos P. Romulo, Mrs. Marcos was the ''de facto'' Vice President of the Philippines. Because of this, the Marcoses possessed a monopoly of power.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Floating Casino in Manila Bay====\nOne of the first acts of Imelda Romualdez Marcos as the Governor of Metro Manila was to legalize gambling to raise revenue for the new metropolis. A floating casino was allowed to operate exclusively inside the Manila Bay. It is owned and operated by \u201cmysterious\u201d stockholders according to the major daily. However, the people of Manila are aware that behind the floating casino management was the brother of Imelda Marcos. One of the most lucrative gambling managements back then was the Jai-Alai, managed by a corporation that received its franchise from the pre-war Commonwealth government. As soon as its franchised expired, a new corporation took over management of Jai-Alai. It was immediately under the control of the First Lady's brother. This new management was allowed to perform operations denied from the former, and it is estimated that the take between the Jai-Alai fronton and the floating casino is Php 2 million a day.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT)====\nReports of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have described massive million-dollar bribes to officials of the government-backed Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company by the General Telephone and Electric Co. of New York in exchange for supply contracts. The officials of PLDT needed to be investigated for violations of foreign currency regulations and unearned income. However, different stakeholders were kept silent. As one PLDT official boasted \u201can expose will only hurt the Palace.\u201d In the U.S. and Japan, presidents have been driven out of office for similar misconduct.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO)====\nThe Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO) was one of the largest corporations in the Philippines before the declaration of Martial Law. It was owned and controlled by the Lopez family. After martial law was imposed, it became the prime target for takeover by the Marcos-Romualdez family. Among the first things the clan did was to arrest the eldest son of Eugenio Lopez, Sr., the major stockholder of Meralco for allegedly plotting the assassination of Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nIn the years 1973\u20131974, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) started applying the oil prize squeeze. As a public utility that supplies power needs of the metro, MERALCO was caught in a vicious vise. Its fuel costs started to double, triple, and quadruple but the government refused to allow them to charge higher consumer rates. Within a year, MERALCO was at the brink of bankruptcy. Government financing institutions refused to guarantee MERALCO's foreign loans. As a result, the company was pushed to the edge of massive defaults in loans.\n\nIt was here that the Marcos-Romualdez clan stepped in. According to Eugenio Lopez, Sr., he was promised the release of his eldest son from prison in exchange for the sale of his control in MERALCO to the Marcos-Romualdez group. After several months of negotiations and with the increasing loan defaults, Mr. Lopez conceded defeat. He even died without seeing his son Eugenio, Jr. released from the Marcos martial law prison.\n\nAfter the Marcos-Romualdez takeover, the government allowed MERALCO to increase consumer rates. The government gave huge subsidies to the company. On the fifth anniversary of martial rule, Jesus Bigornia of Bulletin Today wrote that MERALCO rose as one of the top earners. Around Php 200 million in net income was recorded. This was 168% more than the previous year. Aside from being allowed to raise electricity rates, MERALCO was also exempted from paying the duty of oil imports, which is a form of indirect subsidy it should share with poor consumers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Infrastructure projects ===\nFerdinand Marcos's term was characterized by booming infrastructure,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://martiallawmuseum.ph/magaral/edifice-complex-building-on-the-backs-of-the-filipino-people/|title=Edifice Complex: Building on the Backs of the Filipino People|website=Martial Law Museum|accessdate=February 27, 2019}}</ref> but to the detriment of the economy and of the lives of Filipinos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//views/imho/124682-marcos-economy-golden-age-philippines|title=Marcos years marked 'golden age' of PH economy?

The projected budget for the construction of CCP was P15 million, but by December 1968 the cost had already reached P48 million, and the construction was not even complete yet. Because of this, Imelda Romualdez Marcos loaned $7 million from the National Investment Development Corporation to finance the remaining amount.

In 1974, National Power was already negotiating with General Electric to get the order. However, Westinghouse, another energy company, hired a lobbyist: Herminio Disini, a friend of Ferdinand Marcos. Using his proximity to Marcos, Westinghouse made a direct offer to Marcos and his cabinet to supply a plant with two 620 MW reactors at a base price of $500 million. The estimated total price was raised to around $650 million because of other charges like fuel and transmission lines.<ref name=\":5\" /> Soon after, the negotiations with General Electric were scrapped, and Westinghouse won the deal. By March 1975, Westinghouse's contract price increased to $1.1 billion for interest and escalation costs.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere were numerous issues regarding its safety and usability. After the Three Mile Island incident in the United States, construction of the nuclear power plant was stopped. A safety inquiry was done subsequently, which revealed over 4,000 defects.<ref name=\":5\" /> The site chosen for the nuclear plant was also dangerous, as it was built near the open sea, the then-dormant Mount Pinatubo, and was within 25 miles of three geological faults.<ref name=\":5\" /> The nuclear plant was discontinued in 1986 following the Chernobyl disaster.<ref name=\":4\" /> Its goal of generating 620 MW of electricity was never achieved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/camacho2/|title=The Controversy of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant|website=large.stanford.edu|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIts cost reached over $2.3 million and was only paid off by the government in April 2017, 31 years after the beginning of its construction. However, government spending for the BNPP continues long after that. Maintaining the plant costs the government P40 million a year. In 2011, the government had to reimburse P4.2 billion to National Power Corporation for the plant's maintenance. To contribute to the cost of its maintenance, it was transformed into a tourist attraction.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== San Juanico Bridge ====\n[[File:San Juanico Bridge.jpg|thumb|San Juanico Bridge connecting Leyte and Samar]]\nThe San Juanico Bridge is part of the Pan-Philippine Highway and links the provinces of Leyte and Samar through Tacloban City and Santa Rita, Samar.

There was not enough traffic between these two islands to warrant a bridge to be constructed there. It is for this reason that the San Juanico Bridge remains to be the one of the costliest white elephant projects during the Marcos era.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Marcos's Green Revolution ===\nThe Green Revolution is a set of research technology transfer initiatives from the 1950s to 1960s that increased agricultural production worldwide, particularly in developing countries such as the Philippines.<ref name=\":14\">{{Citation|last=Wu|first=Felicia|title=The Green Revolution|date=2004|work=The Future of Genetically Modified Crops|pages=11\u201338|series=Lessons from the Green Revolution|edition=1|publisher=RAND Corporation|isbn=9780833036469|last2=P.Butz|first2=William|jstor=10.7249/mg161rc.11}}</ref>\n\nWith the support of the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) was established in the Philippines. By 1966, the rice variety IR-8 was created. It required intensive irrigation, plenty of fertilizer, and chemical pesticides, but produced substantially higher yields.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nThis led to the creation of Ferdinand Marcos's major programs, Presidential Decree No. 27, the Masagana 99 agricultural program, which had the goal of producing 99 sacks or 4.4 tons of unmilled rice per hectare to ensure self-sufficiency in food.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kenneth|date=1989|title=PALAY, POLICY, AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION: THE \"MASAGANA 99\" PROGRAM REVISITED|url=|journal=Philippine Journal of Public Administration|volume=XXXIII|issue=1|pages=69\u201371|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnnual rice production in the Philippines increased from 3.7 to 7.7 million tons in two decades.The switch to IR8 rice made the Philippines a rice exporter for the first time in the 20th century.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAlthough IR8 showed promising results, the years from 1965 to 1986 showed a complete paradox of events. The income per capita rose, the economy was growing, yet people were in famine. The American economist James K. Boyce calls this phenomenon \u201cimmiserizing growth\u201d, when economic growth, and political and social conditions, are such that the rich get absolutely richer and the poor become absolutely poorer.<ref name=\"Marcos' Green Revolution\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/marcos-green-revolution/246377/|title=Marcos' Green Revolution|date=February 22, 2016|website=The Manila Times Online|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Gonzalo Gatan's Pesticide case''\n\nOne of the possible causes to this was the case reported by Gonzalo Gatan of the Manila Pest Control Company against the key implementors of Masagana 99. He was allegedly unable to introduce his agricultural pesticides to the market due to the \"conivance\" between transnational corporations (TNCs) that dominated the production and distribution of chemicals and the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA) (Ofreno 1982: 109). In the production of IR8 rice, FPA specified that only certain agricultural pesticides, all of which were German and American pesticide imports, were to be used. Any other pesticide needed to undergo tests at the National Crop Protection Center and at the Bureau of Plant Industry, whose laboratories were headed by German and American specialists. These laboratories were said to have been set up through RP-German Crop Protection Agreement and with the help of the United States Agency for International Development. Therefore, none of Gatan's formulations made it to the FPA recommended pesticides (Ofreno 1982: 109-110).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=BAUTISTA|first=VICTORIA A.|title=Public-Interest Perspective: A Neglected Dimension in the Study of Corruption|date=1983|journal=Philippine Sociological Review|volume=31|issue=3/4|pages=45\u201353|issn=0031-7810|jstor=23898197}}</ref> Probably any other local pesticide which that tried to penetrate the market faced the same fate.\n\n''Land control''\n\nMarcos also allegedly took feudal control of landlords by only covering rice and corn lands to Masagana 99, excluding the vast sugar haciendas of his crony Danding Cojuangco and even Hacienda Luisita in Tarlac.\n\n''Effects of Masagana 99''\n\nAfter the declaration of martial law in 1972, the gap between the rich and the poor became significantly wide. Possible gains from Masagana 99 were either going out of the country or going to the rich alone. Even if rice supply was high and prices were down, people could not afford to buy rice. In a 1979 review of Philippine grain production policy, the World Bank found that total rice consumption in the 1970s slowed, growing at only 2.9%, barely in step with the rate of population increase. Studies by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute found that by 1982, two thirds of families consumed less than the recommended minimum daily calorie intake. 25% of the country's pre-schoolers were stunted, 14% were wasted, and an appalling 69% were underweight. Between 1970 and 1983, infant mortality was at 59 per 1,000 in rural areas and 55 per 1,000 in urban areas \u2013 among the highest in East and Southeast Asia. The cause of infant and child deaths could be directly traced to hunger and a lack of basic health care services.<ref name=\"Marcos' Green Revolution\"/>\n\n===Overseas investments and bank accounts===\nThe overseas properties of Marcos and his associates created an empire spanning places as diverse as California, Washington, New York, Rome, Vienna, Australia, Antilles, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, &nbsp;Switzerland and Singapore.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism|last=Manapat, Ricardo|date=1991|publisher=Aletheia Publications|isbn=978-9719128700|oclc=28428684}}</ref> The more popular properties among those in this empire are the multi-million dollar New York real estate investments, California banks and Swiss bank accounts; lesser known ones are villas in Austria, London, and Rome,&nbsp;gold and diamond investments in South Africa, and banks and hotels in Israel.\n\nThere were ten prominent Filipinos, led by Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos, who acquired, presumably illegally, various extensive properties in the U.S. They were Roberto Benedicto, Antonio Floirendo, Juan Ponce Enrile, Jose Yao Campos, Eduardo Cojuangco, Roman Cruz, Jr., Geronimo Velasco, and Rodolfo Cuenca.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite book|title=The transnational dynamics of the Marcos Plunder|last=Aquino, Belinda A.|date=1999|publisher=University of the Philippines, National College of Public Administration and Governance|isbn=978-9718567197|oclc=760665486}}</ref> Other nominees who were noted as having been crucial in considerable overseas transactions were Ricardo Silverio, Herminio Disini, Nemesio Yabi and Edna Camam.<ref name=\":11\"/> Dewey Dee, one of Marcos\u2019 main nominees, as well as Jose Yao Campos would later reveal how they fronted Marcos\u2019 investments both locally and abroad via at least twenty five interlocking corporations set up for this purpose.\n\nThe main way the Marcoses were able to get money abroad was via the laundering of dirty money. Contrary to images commonly conjured by the word \"dirty\", dirty money, as defined by Jean Ziegler, who wrote extensively about the faults of the Swiss banking system, is simply \"capital whose transfer does not relate to any repayment of debt or trading transaction.\" The notion that dirty money is money which was stolen via ''dirty'' means has been used by various officials to excuse the unreasonable transfer of capital abroad, defending themselves through trite legalisms and the urgency of preserving money amidst local hyperinflation and political instability, as well as to completely deny its existence.<ref name=\":7\" /> &nbsp;Estelito Mendoza, Marcos\u2019 Solicitor General, is quoted in Ricardo&nbsp;Manapat's book ''Some Are Smarter than Others: The History of Marcos' Crony Capitalism'' as defining dirty money as money whose \"value moves merely in one direction without any equal compensatory movement in the other.\"<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe process by which Marcos laundered dirty money abroad was very comprehensive and difficult to track. First, overseas bank accounts were established in order to have easy access to the funds without concern for Philippine exchange laws. Often, cronies would choose distinguished U.S. law firms which specialized in offshore real investment in U.S. jurisdictions.<ref name=\":11\"/> Then, a lawyer or accountant would be contacted to establish an offshore corporation, usually in Hong Kong, to serve as the managing director of the corporation. A \"shell\" company, organized solely for the purpose of moving and hiding the true ownership of assets served as a channel for transferring funds from the Philippines inconspicuously.<ref name=\":11\"/><ref name=\":7\" /> As this happened, another lawyers, often in the U.S., would be hired for a fee of S200 to S3,000 to arrange for the incorporation of another offshore corporation through accounting firms in Cura\u00e7ao in the Netherlands Antilles.<ref name=\":11\"/> This would become the significant link between the real estate investment and the client. By this point, it would be more and more convoluted, becoming in the process much more difficult to track. One San Francisco lawyer, who represented affluent Filipino investors in California land deals, said \"You\u2019ll never find out who the principals are. Every time I have ever dealt with these guys, I have never dealt with a document signed by a principal.\" The Marcos group used this very complicated and developed \"laundering\" process of involving multiple layers of dummy corporations scattered internationally to acquire and establish several multimillion assets in various U.S. locations.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nMarcos, through different international banks, was able to launder money abroad. Crocker National Bank in San Francisco, for example, had to settle with the US Treasury Department, because they failed to report $4 billion in cash deposits from 1980 to 1984 from six Hong Kong-based banks.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hong Kong was a favorite among Filipino launderers. Due to the absence of foreign exchange controls in Hong Kong, it was impossible to determine the origin of the money.\n\nCrocker merely stated that the money came from \"various Asian countries.\"<ref name=\":7\" /> The compliance of private banks with anonymous individuals looking to deposit their money enabled money laundering. Consequently, money laundering is an integral part of private banking. Marcos would later go on to seek the help of other private banks in Switzerland, Hong Kong, Austria, Panama, Liechtenstein, and the Netherland Antilles. The Swiss are known for their mastery in money laundering thanks to the central role of secrecy in their society.<ref name=\":7\" /> Austria, which also has its own tradition of banking secrecy, allowed accounts to be opened without the client ever revealing his or her name, something Swiss banks did not even allow.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hong Kong, more conveniently located for the Philippines, has developed facilities for the movement of money and the ready availability of various British lawyers who offer services of opening front or [[shell corporation]]s for a fee. Panama is noted for its corrupt politicians and convenient transit point to the U.S.<ref name=\":7\" /> The Netherland Antilles served as the home for more than 35,000 shell companies of Marcos in order to invest anonymously in overseas financial markets and U.S. real estates.<ref name=\":7\" /> Throughout the entire process, highly-paid lawyers, accountants, investment consultants and portfolio managers were hired in order to organize shell corporations and acquire overseas properties.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe Marcoses invested a lot in the US East and West coasts, but there were also important investments in Texas and Washington state.<ref name=\":7\" /> Most of the major real estate investments were Imelda's purchases of real estate in New York, Jose Campos Yao's investments in Texas and Seattle, and crony purchases in California.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nJose Campos Yao, a Marcos ally and crony, along with his associates, purchased a whole city block in Seattle, Washington in 1983.

She elicited the help of key individuals such as Gliceria Tantoco, one of Imelda's closest friends and business associates, Antonio Floirendo, who was instrumental in Imelda's involvement in the lucrative sugar trading business in New York and the purchase of the Olympic Towers, Rolando Gapud, one of Marcos\u2019 financial advisers, Fe Roa Gimenez and Vilma H. Bautista, personal assistants of Imelda, and Joseph and Ralph Bernstein, who played key roles in helping the Marcoses purchase and conceal ownership of their Manhattan properties.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nImelda Marcos purchased five expensive Manhattan condominiums at the Olympic Towers, located on 5th Avenue, New York.<ref name=\":7\" /> The first three condominiums were purchased by Thetaventure Ltd., a Hong Kong-based shell corporation, for a total of $688,000 and was remodelled for $3.75 million. The fourth and fifth condominium were bought for $270,000 and $1.1 million respectively. Imelda also purchased her own resort, the Lindenmere Estate in Center Moriches, Suffolk County, Long Island.

However, at the same time, for the US, the Philippines was just one of its many allies, and for the Philippines, the US was its only patron. Therefore, Marcos ensured to identify himself closely to the US in order to secure a strong bargaining power with their government. Indeed, he had manipulated this American connection to sustain him during his two decades of power. US support was believed to be the only reason why Marcos remained in power.<ref name=\":10\">{{cite journal|last=Kessler|first=Richard J.|date=1986|title=Marcos and the Americans|journal=Foreign Policy|issue=63|pages=40\u201357|doi=10.2307/1148755|issn=0015-7228|jstor=1148755}}</ref>\n[[File:Marcos visit Reagan 1982.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos meet with President Reagan in 1982]]\nOver his term, Marcos was able to strengthen his ties to the US government. Johnson received two engineer battalions bought with the Philippine's American aid as a form of Philippines military participation in the Vietnam War. After the fall of South Vietnam, Gerald Ford demanded better security assistance from allies, such as the Philippines. While Carter wanted to retain the US military bases in the Philippines to project military power in the Indian Ocean to guard West's oil supply line from the Middle East.<ref name=\":10\" /> All of which, Marcos granted.\n\n==== Obtaining additional aid ====\nTo obtain additional aid, Marcos often leveraged on threats that caught the attention of the US government. To secure additional aid for his campaign, Marcos threatened to search every visiting American naval vessel. The US responded by assisting his campaign indirectly, injecting several million dollars into the government banking system.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Leifer|first=Michael|last2=Thompson|first2=W.

Yet he received warnings from the Philippine embassy in Washington that \u201cprovisions should now be made in anticipation of a possible phasing out or minimization of U.S. aid to the Republic of the Philippines, both for military aid and non-military items, considering the evolving temper of the American Congress.\u201d Afraid, Marcos began to suggests threats again. In one of his presidential speeches, he stated that the bases were a threat to regional peace and security, while reminding the United States of its \"solemn obligation\" to continue aid. He warned that the bases could \"imperil more than they serve our interests.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Presidential Speeches|last=|first=|year=1979|isbn=|location=Manila|pages=275\u2013277|chapter=Speech by Ferdinand E.

In less than 20 days however, the Sandiganbayan listed Imelda's \u201cadvanced age\u201d and health condition as considerations for allowing the accused to post bail. The Fifth Division's (of the Sandiganbayan) ruling read that \u201cthe fact that she is of advanced age and for health reasons, consistent with the doctrine in Enrile vs Sandiganbayan, bail is allowed for these seven cases.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/12/04/1874021/sandiganbayan-defends-grant-bail-imelda-marcos|title=Sandiganbayan defends grant of bail to Imelda Marcos|website=philstar.com|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref> The Supreme Court of the Philippines affirms that the Marcoses\u2019 assets, that are beyond the legal and declared government salaries, are considered as ill-gotten wealth. In 1998 however, the Supreme Court acquitted Imelda Marcos of corruption charges from a previous graft conviction in 1993.\n\nSome US Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit confirmed a contempt judgement in relation to the assets of Imelda and her son Bongbong in the United States. Although on a different subject matter, this judgement awarded $353.6 million to human rights victims, which was arguably the largest contempt award ever affirmed by an appellate court.\n\n=== Illegal Swiss foundations ===\nIn 1986, following the overthrow of the Marcos regime, it was discovered that as early as 1968, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, under the pseudonyms William Saunders and Jane Ryan, opened four bank accounts in Swiss banks amounting to nearly $1 million.<ref name=\":11\"/> Ferdinand Marcos\u2019 salary then was only 60,000 pesos a year.<ref name=\":11\" /> Imelda Marcos, on the other hand, did not have any visible means of income.

In December 1997 (Reuters 1997:3), Switzerland's highest court ordered the Swiss banks to return $500 million of Marcos\u2019 secret accounts to the Philippine government, marking a major step forward in efforts to recover the Marcos\u2019 hidden wealth.<ref name=\":11\" /> That same year, the Philippine Senate, through its Blue Ribbon Committee chairman Franklin Drilon, has revealed the existence of 97 alleged accounts of Ferdinand Marcos in 23 banks in Europe, the United States, and Asia, suspected to be depositories of wealth looted from the Philippine treasury. Thirteen of the 23 banks mentioned by Drilon are in Switzerland, namely: Swiss Credit Bank, Swiss Bank Corp., Bankers Trust AG, Banque Paribas, Affida Bank, Copla, S.A., Lombard Odier et Cie, Standard Chartered Bank, Swiss Volkabank, Bank Ricklin, Compaigne Banque Et d\u2019Investissements, Compaigne de Gestion Et De Banque Gonet Sa Nyon, and Bank Hoffman AG.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nThe Sandiganbayan 5th Division has recently convicted Imelda Marcos of seven counts of graft for creating and maintaining private foundations in Switzerland, violating the anti-graft law that prohibits public officials from having pecuniary interests in private businesses.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//nation/216333-imelda-marcos-guilty-verdict-graft-case-shows-scheme-earnings-swiss-foundations|title=Imelda Marcos verdict shows scheme to earn $200M from Swiss foundations|last=Buan|first=Lian|website=Rappler|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref> As the Sandiganbayan's decision reads, \u201cThough named as a foundation, the evidence shows that these entities were put up primarily for the entrepreneurial activity of opening bank accounts and deposits, transferring funds, earning interests and even profit from investment, for the private benefit of the Marcos family as beneficiaries\u201d.

The Prime Minister also acted as head of the National Economic Development Authority. Upon his re-election to the Presidency in 1981, Marcos was succeeded as Prime Minister by an American-educated leader and [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]] graduate, [[Cesar Virata]], who was elected as an Assemblyman (Member of the Parliament) from Cavite in 1978.

This was taking place at the same time that China was beginning to accept free-market capitalism and American businesses were jockeying to establish manufacturing plants in China. The political troubles of the Philippines hindered the entry of foreign investments, and foreign banks stopped granting loans to the Philippine government.\n\nIn an attempt to launch a national economic recovery program and despite his growing isolation from American businesses, Marcos negotiated with foreign creditors including the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], [[World Bank]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), for a restructuring of the country's foreign debts \u2013 to give the Philippines more time to pay the loans. Marcos ordered a cut in government expenditures and used a portion of the savings to finance the ''Sariling Sikap'' (Self-Reliance), a livelihood program he established in 1984.\n\nHowever, the economy continued to shrink despite the government's recovery efforts due to a number of reasons. Most of the so-called government development programs failed to materialize. Government funds were often siphoned off by Marcos or his cronies. American investors were discouraged by the Filipino economic elite who were against the corruption that by now had become endemic in the Marcos regime.<ref name=\"albert\">{{cite book|last1=Celoza|first1=Albert|title=Ferdinand Marcos and the Philippines: The Political Economy of Authoritarianism|date=November 25, 1997|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0275941376}}</ref> The failure of the recovery program was further augmented by civil unrest, rampant graft and corruption within the government, and Marcos's lack of credibility.

Two Americans, namely attorney Richard Hirschfeld and business consultant Robert Chastain, both of whom posed as arms dealers, gained knowledge of a plot by gaining Marcos's trust and secretly tape recorded their conversations with the ousted leader.\n\nAccording to Hirschfeld, he was first invited by Marcos to a party held at the latter's family residence in Oahu, Hawaii. After hearing that one of Hirschfeld's clients was Saudi Sheikh Mohammad Fassi, Marcos's interest was piqued because he had done business with Saudis in the past. A few weeks later, Marcos asked for help with securing a passport from another country, in order to travel back to the Philippines while bypassing travel restrictions imposed by the Philippines and United States governments. This failed, however, and subsequently Marcos asked Hirschfeld to arrange a $10-million loan from Fassi.\n\nOn January 12, 1987, Marcos stated to Hirschfeld that he required another $5-million loan \"in order to pay 10,000 soldiers $500 each as a form of 'combat life insurance.' When asked by Hirschfeld if he was talking about an invasion of the Philippines, Marcos responded, \"Yes.\" Hirschfeld also recalled that the former president said that he was negotiating with several arms dealers to purchase up to $18 million worth of weapons, including tanks and heat-seeking missiles, and enough ammunition to \"last an army three months.\"\n\nMarcos had thought of being flown to his hometown in Ilocos Norte, greeted by his loyal supporters, and initiating a plot to kidnap Corazon Aquino. \u2033What I would like to see happen is we take her hostage,\u2033 Marcos told Chastain. \u2033Not to hurt her ... no reason to hurt her .. to take her.\u2033\n\nLearning of this plan, Hirschfeld contacted the US Department of Justice, and was asked for further evidence. This information eventually reached President Ronald Reagan, who placed Marcos under \"island arrest\", further limiting his movement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/1b750440d5a491184f5b2a91533774c1|title=Former Philippine President Marcos Reveals Plan to Invade Homeland|work=AP News|accessdate=July 8, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-10/news/mn-1939_1_president-marcos|title=10,000 Troops, Billions in Gold: House Panel Hears Tapes of Marcos Plotting coup|last=GETLIN |first=JOSH |date=July 10, 1987 |work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=July 8, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>\n\nIn response, the Aquino government dismissed Marcos's statements as being a mere propaganda ploy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/07/10/Aquino-government-says-Marcos-invasion-plan-a-propaganda-ploy/2836552888000/|title=Aquino government says Marcos invasion plan a propaganda ploy|work=UPI|accessdate=July 8, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Corruption in the Marcos Era ==\n\n===Monopolies===\n[[File:Marcos in Washington 1983.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand Marcos in Washington, 1983]]\nMarcos\u2019 administration spawned new oligarchs in Philippine society who became instant millionaires. These oligarchs plundered government financing institutions to finance their corporate raiding, monopolies and various takeover schemes. Marcos\u2019 cronies were awarded timber, mining and oil concessions and vast tracts of rich government agricultural and urban lands, not to mention lush government construction contracts. During his martial law regime, Marcos confiscated and appropriated by force and duress many businesses and institutions, both private and public, and redistributed them to his [[Marcos Cronies|cronies]] and close personal friends. A presidential crony representing Westington won for its principal the $500 million bid for the construction of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant in Bagac. The crony's commission was $25 million or $200 million representing five percent of the total bid price. These new oligarchs were known to be insatiable and more profligate than the oligarchs of pre-martial law days.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Testament from a Prison Cell|last=Aquino|first=Ninoy|publisher=Philippine Journal, Incorporated|year=1989|isbn=978-0962169502|location=Los Angeles|pages=}}</ref> Two of Marcos's friends were [[Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.|Eduardo \"Danding\" Cojuangco Jr.]], who would go on to control [[San Miguel Corporation]], and [[Ramon Cojuangco]], late businessman and chairman of [[PLDT]], and father of Antonio \"Tony Boy\" Cojuangco (who would eventually succeed his father in the telecommunications company), both happened to be cousins of [[Corazon Aquino]]. These associates of Marcos then used these as fronts to [[money laundering|launder proceeds]] from institutionalized graft and corruption in the different national governmental agencies as \"[[crony capitalism]]\" for personal benefit. Graft and corruption via bribery, [[racketeering]], and [[embezzlement]] became more prevalent during this era. Marcos also silenced the free press, making the press of the state propaganda the only legal one, which was a common practice for governments around the world that sought to fight communism.\n\nMarcos and his close [[Rolex 12]] associates like [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] used their powers to settle scores against old rivals such as the Lopezes who were always opposed to the Marcos administration. Enrile and the Lopezes ([[Eugenio Lopez Sr.]] and [[Eugenio Lopez Jr.]]) were [[Harvard]]-educated Filipino leaders. Leading opponents such as Senators [[Benigno Aquino Jr.]], [[Jose Diokno]], [[Jovito Salonga]] and many others were imprisoned for months or years.

At this point, Marcos controlled both the oligarchy and the oligopoly.\n\n====Establishment of Metro Manila====\nWithout the consent of the people of Manila and environs, Marcos merged four neighboring cities and thirteen municipalities into a Metro Manila. Without the consent of residents of the merged cities and municipalities, he appointed his wife, Imelda Marcos as governor of Metro Manila - the second most powerful office in the republic. Given that Metro Manila accounts for around 20% of the country's population, it is estimated to be responsible for at least 70% of gross national receipts. It is the seat of the national government and some 90% of the national government's offices and instrumentalities are located within its environs. Its budget is second to the national government. In the words of Carlos P. Romulo, Mrs. Marcos was the ''de facto'' Vice President of the Philippines. Because of this, the Marcoses possessed a monopoly of power.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Floating Casino in Manila Bay====\nOne of the first acts of Imelda Romualdez Marcos as the Governor of Metro Manila was to legalize gambling to raise revenue for the new metropolis.

However, the people of Manila are aware that behind the floating casino management was the brother of Imelda Marcos. One of the most lucrative gambling managements back then was the Jai-Alai, managed by a corporation that received its franchise from the pre-war Commonwealth government. As soon as its franchised expired, a new corporation took over management of Jai-Alai. It was immediately under the control of the First Lady's brother. This new management was allowed to perform operations denied from the former, and it is estimated that the take between the Jai-Alai fronton and the floating casino is Php 2 million a day.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT)====\nReports of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have described massive million-dollar bribes to officials of the government-backed Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company by the General Telephone and Electric Co. of New York in exchange for supply contracts. The officials of PLDT needed to be investigated for violations of foreign currency regulations and unearned income. However, different stakeholders were kept silent. As one PLDT official boasted \u201can expose will only hurt the Palace.\u201d In the U.S. and Japan, presidents have been driven out of office for similar misconduct.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO)====\nThe Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO) was one of the largest corporations in the Philippines before the declaration of Martial Law. It was owned and controlled by the Lopez family. After martial law was imposed, it became the prime target for takeover by the Marcos-Romualdez family. Among the first things the clan did was to arrest the eldest son of Eugenio Lopez, Sr., the major stockholder of Meralco for allegedly plotting the assassination of Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nIn the years 1973\u20131974, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) started applying the oil prize squeeze. As a public utility that supplies power needs of the metro, MERALCO was caught in a vicious vise. Its fuel costs started to double, triple, and quadruple but the government refused to allow them to charge higher consumer rates. Within a year, MERALCO was at the brink of bankruptcy. Government financing institutions refused to guarantee MERALCO's foreign loans. As a result, the company was pushed to the edge of massive defaults in loans.\n\nIt was here that the Marcos-Romualdez clan stepped in. According to Eugenio Lopez, Sr., he was promised the release of his eldest son from prison in exchange for the sale of his control in MERALCO to the Marcos-Romualdez group. After several months of negotiations and with the increasing loan defaults, Mr. Lopez conceded defeat. He even died without seeing his son Eugenio, Jr. released from the Marcos martial law prison.\n\nAfter the Marcos-Romualdez takeover, the government allowed MERALCO to increase consumer rates. The government gave huge subsidies to the company. On the fifth anniversary of martial rule, Jesus Bigornia of Bulletin Today wrote that MERALCO rose as one of the top earners. Around Php 200 million in net income was recorded. This was 168% more than the previous year. Aside from being allowed to raise electricity rates, MERALCO was also exempted from paying the duty of oil imports, which is a form of indirect subsidy it should share with poor consumers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Infrastructure projects ===\nFerdinand Marcos's term was characterized by booming infrastructure,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://martiallawmuseum.ph/magaral/edifice-complex-building-on-the-backs-of-the-filipino-people/|title=Edifice Complex: Building on the Backs of the Filipino People|website=Martial Law Museum|accessdate=February 27, 2019}}</ref> but to the detriment of the economy and of the lives of Filipinos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//views/imho/124682-marcos-economy-golden-age-philippines|title=Marcos years marked 'golden age' of PH economy?

The projected budget for the construction of CCP was P15 million, but by December 1968 the cost had already reached P48 million, and the construction was not even complete yet. Because of this, Imelda Romualdez Marcos loaned $7 million from the National Investment Development Corporation to finance the remaining amount.

In 1974, National Power was already negotiating with General Electric to get the order. However, Westinghouse, another energy company, hired a lobbyist: Herminio Disini, a friend of Ferdinand Marcos. Using his proximity to Marcos, Westinghouse made a direct offer to Marcos and his cabinet to supply a plant with two 620 MW reactors at a base price of $500 million. The estimated total price was raised to around $650 million because of other charges like fuel and transmission lines.<ref name=\":5\" /> Soon after, the negotiations with General Electric were scrapped, and Westinghouse won the deal. By March 1975, Westinghouse's contract price increased to $1.1 billion for interest and escalation costs.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere were numerous issues regarding its safety and usability. After the Three Mile Island incident in the United States, construction of the nuclear power plant was stopped. A safety inquiry was done subsequently, which revealed over 4,000 defects.<ref name=\":5\" /> The site chosen for the nuclear plant was also dangerous, as it was built near the open sea, the then-dormant Mount Pinatubo, and was within 25 miles of three geological faults.<ref name=\":5\" /> The nuclear plant was discontinued in 1986 following the Chernobyl disaster.<ref name=\":4\" /> Its goal of generating 620 MW of electricity was never achieved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/camacho2/|title=The Controversy of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant|website=large.stanford.edu|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIts cost reached over $2.3 million and was only paid off by the government in April 2017, 31 years after the beginning of its construction. However, government spending for the BNPP continues long after that. Maintaining the plant costs the government P40 million a year. In 2011, the government had to reimburse P4.2 billion to National Power Corporation for the plant's maintenance. To contribute to the cost of its maintenance, it was transformed into a tourist attraction.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== San Juanico Bridge ====\n[[File:San Juanico Bridge.jpg|thumb|San Juanico Bridge connecting Leyte and Samar]]\nThe San Juanico Bridge is part of the Pan-Philippine Highway and links the provinces of Leyte and Samar through Tacloban City and Santa Rita, Samar.

By 1966, the rice variety IR-8 was created. It required intensive irrigation, plenty of fertilizer, and chemical pesticides, but produced substantially higher yields.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nThis led to the creation of Ferdinand Marcos's major programs, Presidential Decree No. 27, the Masagana 99 agricultural program, which had the goal of producing 99 sacks or 4.4 tons of unmilled rice per hectare to ensure self-sufficiency in food.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kenneth|date=1989|title=PALAY, POLICY, AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION: THE \"MASAGANA 99\" PROGRAM REVISITED|url=|journal=Philippine Journal of Public Administration|volume=XXXIII|issue=1|pages=69\u201371|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnnual rice production in the Philippines increased from 3.7 to 7.7 million tons in two decades.The switch to IR8 rice made the Philippines a rice exporter for the first time in the 20th century.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAlthough IR8 showed promising results, the years from 1965 to 1986 showed a complete paradox of events. The income per capita rose, the economy was growing, yet people were in famine. The American economist James K. Boyce calls this phenomenon \u201cimmiserizing growth\u201d, when economic growth, and political and social conditions, are such that the rich get absolutely richer and the poor become absolutely poorer.<ref name=\"Marcos' Green Revolution\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/marcos-green-revolution/246377/|title=Marcos' Green Revolution|date=February 22, 2016|website=The Manila Times Online|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Gonzalo Gatan's Pesticide case''\n\nOne of the possible causes to this was the case reported by Gonzalo Gatan of the Manila Pest Control Company against the key implementors of Masagana 99. He was allegedly unable to introduce his agricultural pesticides to the market due to the \"conivance\" between transnational corporations (TNCs) that dominated the production and distribution of chemicals and the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA) (Ofreno 1982: 109). In the production of IR8 rice, FPA specified that only certain agricultural pesticides, all of which were German and American pesticide imports, were to be used. Any other pesticide needed to undergo tests at the National Crop Protection Center and at the Bureau of Plant Industry, whose laboratories were headed by German and American specialists. These laboratories were said to have been set up through RP-German Crop Protection Agreement and with the help of the United States Agency for International Development. Therefore, none of Gatan's formulations made it to the FPA recommended pesticides (Ofreno 1982: 109-110).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=BAUTISTA|first=VICTORIA A.|title=Public-Interest Perspective: A Neglected Dimension in the Study of Corruption|date=1983|journal=Philippine Sociological Review|volume=31|issue=3/4|pages=45\u201353|issn=0031-7810|jstor=23898197}}</ref> Probably any other local pesticide which that tried to penetrate the market faced the same fate.\n\n''Land control''\n\nMarcos also allegedly took feudal control of landlords by only covering rice and corn lands to Masagana 99, excluding the vast sugar haciendas of his crony Danding Cojuangco and even Hacienda Luisita in Tarlac.\n\n''Effects of Masagana 99''\n\nAfter the declaration of martial law in 1972, the gap between the rich and the poor became significantly wide. Possible gains from Masagana 99 were either going out of the country or going to the rich alone. Even if rice supply was high and prices were down, people could not afford to buy rice. In a 1979 review of Philippine grain production policy, the World Bank found that total rice consumption in the 1970s slowed, growing at only 2.9%, barely in step with the rate of population increase. Studies by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute found that by 1982, two thirds of families consumed less than the recommended minimum daily calorie intake. 25% of the country's pre-schoolers were stunted, 14% were wasted, and an appalling 69% were underweight. Between 1970 and 1983, infant mortality was at 59 per 1,000 in rural areas and 55 per 1,000 in urban areas \u2013 among the highest in East and Southeast Asia. The cause of infant and child deaths could be directly traced to hunger and a lack of basic health care services.<ref name=\"Marcos' Green Revolution\"/>\n\n===Overseas investments and bank accounts===\nThe overseas properties of Marcos and his associates created an empire spanning places as diverse as California, Washington, New York, Rome, Vienna, Australia, Antilles, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, &nbsp;Switzerland and Singapore.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism|last=Manapat, Ricardo|date=1991|publisher=Aletheia Publications|isbn=978-9719128700|oclc=28428684}}</ref> The more popular properties among those in this empire are the multi-million dollar New York real estate investments, California banks and Swiss bank accounts; lesser known ones are villas in Austria, London, and Rome,&nbsp;gold and diamond investments in South Africa, and banks and hotels in Israel.\n\nThere were ten prominent Filipinos, led by Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos, who acquired, presumably illegally, various extensive properties in the U.S. They were Roberto Benedicto, Antonio Floirendo, Juan Ponce Enrile, Jose Yao Campos, Eduardo Cojuangco, Roman Cruz, Jr., Geronimo Velasco, and Rodolfo Cuenca.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite book|title=The transnational dynamics of the Marcos Plunder|last=Aquino, Belinda A.|date=1999|publisher=University of the Philippines, National College of Public Administration and Governance|isbn=978-9718567197|oclc=760665486}}</ref> Other nominees who were noted as having been crucial in considerable overseas transactions were Ricardo Silverio, Herminio Disini, Nemesio Yabi and Edna Camam.<ref name=\":11\"/> Dewey Dee, one of Marcos\u2019 main nominees, as well as Jose Yao Campos would later reveal how they fronted Marcos\u2019 investments both locally and abroad via at least twenty five interlocking corporations set up for this purpose.\n\nThe main way the Marcoses were able to get money abroad was via the laundering of dirty money. Contrary to images commonly conjured by the word \"dirty\", dirty money, as defined by Jean Ziegler, who wrote extensively about the faults of the Swiss banking system, is simply \"capital whose transfer does not relate to any repayment of debt or trading transaction.\" The notion that dirty money is money which was stolen via ''dirty'' means has been used by various officials to excuse the unreasonable transfer of capital abroad, defending themselves through trite legalisms and the urgency of preserving money amidst local hyperinflation and political instability, as well as to completely deny its existence.<ref name=\":7\" /> &nbsp;Estelito Mendoza, Marcos\u2019 Solicitor General, is quoted in Ricardo&nbsp;Manapat's book ''Some Are Smarter than Others: The History of Marcos' Crony Capitalism'' as defining dirty money as money whose \"value moves merely in one direction without any equal compensatory movement in the other.\"<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe process by which Marcos laundered dirty money abroad was very comprehensive and difficult to track. First, overseas bank accounts were established in order to have easy access to the funds without concern for Philippine exchange laws. Often, cronies would choose distinguished U.S. law firms which specialized in offshore real investment in U.S. jurisdictions.<ref name=\":11\"/> Then, a lawyer or accountant would be contacted to establish an offshore corporation, usually in Hong Kong, to serve as the managing director of the corporation. A \"shell\" company, organized solely for the purpose of moving and hiding the true ownership of assets served as a channel for transferring funds from the Philippines inconspicuously.<ref name=\":11\"/><ref name=\":7\" /> As this happened, another lawyers, often in the U.S., would be hired for a fee of S200 to S3,000 to arrange for the incorporation of another offshore corporation through accounting firms in Cura\u00e7ao in the Netherlands Antilles.<ref name=\":11\"/> This would become the significant link between the real estate investment and the client. By this point, it would be more and more convoluted, becoming in the process much more difficult to track. One San Francisco lawyer, who represented affluent Filipino investors in California land deals, said \"You\u2019ll never find out who the principals are. Every time I have ever dealt with these guys, I have never dealt with a document signed by a principal.\" The Marcos group used this very complicated and developed \"laundering\" process of involving multiple layers of dummy corporations scattered internationally to acquire and establish several multimillion assets in various U.S. locations.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nMarcos, through different international banks, was able to launder money abroad. Crocker National Bank in San Francisco, for example, had to settle with the US Treasury Department, because they failed to report $4 billion in cash deposits from 1980 to 1984 from six Hong Kong-based banks.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hong Kong was a favorite among Filipino launderers. Due to the absence of foreign exchange controls in Hong Kong, it was impossible to determine the origin of the money.\n\nCrocker merely stated that the money came from \"various Asian countries.\"<ref name=\":7\" /> The compliance of private banks with anonymous individuals looking to deposit their money enabled money laundering. Consequently, money laundering is an integral part of private banking. Marcos would later go on to seek the help of other private banks in Switzerland, Hong Kong, Austria, Panama, Liechtenstein, and the Netherland Antilles. The Swiss are known for their mastery in money laundering thanks to the central role of secrecy in their society.<ref name=\":7\" /> Austria, which also has its own tradition of banking secrecy, allowed accounts to be opened without the client ever revealing his or her name, something Swiss banks did not even allow.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hong Kong, more conveniently located for the Philippines, has developed facilities for the movement of money and the ready availability of various British lawyers who offer services of opening front or [[shell corporation]]s for a fee. Panama is noted for its corrupt politicians and convenient transit point to the U.S.<ref name=\":7\" /> The Netherland Antilles served as the home for more than 35,000 shell companies of Marcos in order to invest anonymously in overseas financial markets and U.S. real estates.<ref name=\":7\" /> Throughout the entire process, highly-paid lawyers, accountants, investment consultants and portfolio managers were hired in order to organize shell corporations and acquire overseas properties.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe Marcoses invested a lot in the US East and West coasts, but there were also important investments in Texas and Washington state.<ref name=\":7\" /> Most of the major real estate investments were Imelda's purchases of real estate in New York, Jose Campos Yao's investments in Texas and Seattle, and crony purchases in California.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nJose Campos Yao, a Marcos ally and crony, along with his associates, purchased a whole city block in Seattle, Washington in 1983.

The restorations was paid for by Vilma Bautista, Imelda's personal assistant and Luna 7 Development Corp., a corporation registered in New York.<ref name=\":7\" /> The Townhouse at 13-15 East 66th, New York City, is quite a different case from the other properties, because it was not purchased by a shell corporation but by the Philippine Consulate and the Philippine National Bank.

However, at the same time, for the US, the Philippines was just one of its many allies, and for the Philippines, the US was its only patron. Therefore, Marcos ensured to identify himself closely to the US in order to secure a strong bargaining power with their government. Indeed, he had manipulated this American connection to sustain him during his two decades of power. US support was believed to be the only reason why Marcos remained in power.<ref name=\":10\">{{cite journal|last=Kessler|first=Richard J.|date=1986|title=Marcos and the Americans|journal=Foreign Policy|issue=63|pages=40\u201357|doi=10.2307/1148755|issn=0015-7228|jstor=1148755}}</ref>\n[[File:Marcos visit Reagan 1982.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos meet with President Reagan in 1982]]\nOver his term, Marcos was able to strengthen his ties to the US government. Johnson received two engineer battalions bought with the Philippine's American aid as a form of Philippines military participation in the Vietnam War.

The effect can be particularly strong when wars or [[civil disorders]] lead to extended interruptions in supply. In the 1970s, [[1970s energy crisis|restrictions in oil production]] led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and in the revenue and wealth of OPEC, with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the [[global economy]]. In the 1980s, OPEC began setting [[Production quota|production targets]] for its member nations; generally, when the targets are reduced, oil prices increase. This has occurred most recently from the organization's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply.\n\nEconomists often cite OPEC as a textbook example of a [[cartel]] that cooperates to reduce [[market competition]], but one whose consultations are protected by the doctrine of [[state immunity|state immunity under international law]].

Weeks later, the [[Arab League]]'s first [[Arab Petroleum Congress]] convened in Cairo, Egypt, where the influential journalist [[Wanda Jablonski]] introduced Saudi Arabia's [[Abdullah Tariki]] to Venezuela's observer [[Juan Pablo P\u00e9rez Alfonzo]], representing the two then-largest oil-producing nations outside the United States and the Soviet Union. Both oil ministers were angered by the price cuts, and the two led their fellow delegates to establish the Maadi Pact or Gentlemen's Agreement, calling for an \"Oil Consultation Commission\" of exporting countries, to which MOCs should present price-change plans. Jablonski reported a marked hostility toward the West and a growing outcry against \"[[absentee landlord]]ism\" of the MOCs, which at the time controlled all oil operations within the exporting countries and wielded enormous political influence. In August 1960, ignoring the warnings, and with the US favoring Canadian and Mexican oil for strategic reasons, the MOCs again unilaterally announced significant cuts in their posted prices for Middle Eastern crude oil.<ref name=\"open\"/><ref name=\"prize\">{{cite book |first=Daniel |last=Yergin |authorlink=Daniel Yergin |title=The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1991 |isbn=978-0671502485 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/prize00dani/page/499 499\u2013503] |title-link=The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Painter |first=David S. |year=2012 |title=Oil and the American Century |url=http://jah.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/1/24.full.pdf |journal=[[The Journal of American History]] |volume=99 |issue=1 |pages=24\u201339 |doi=10.1093/jahist/jas073 |access-date=4 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010181915/http://jah.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/1/24.full.pdf |archive-date=10 October 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bBvz_YxlB-AC&pg=PA7 |title=Historical Dictionary of the Petroleum Industry |first=M.S. |last=Vassiliou |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0810862883 |page=7}}</ref>\n\n===1960\u20131975 founding and expansion===\n[[File:Opec Geb\u00e4ude Wien Helferstorferstra\u00dfe 17.jpg|thumb|alt=refer to caption|OPEC headquarters in Vienna<br />(2009 building)]]\nThe following month, during 10\u201314 September 1960, the Baghdad Conference was held at the initiative of Tariki, P\u00e9rez Alfonzo, and Iraqi prime minister [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]], whose country had skipped the 1959 congress.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8U_sWfvgToQC&pg=PA74 |last=Styan |first=David |title=France and Iraq: Oil, Arms and French Policy Making in the Middle East |publisher=I.B.

With only 10 hostages remaining, Carlos held a phone conversation with Algerian President [[Houari Boum\u00e9dienne]], who informed Carlos that the oil ministers' deaths would result in an attack on the plane. Boum\u00e9dienne must also have offered Carlos asylum at this time and possibly financial compensation for failing to complete his assignment.

They also claimed that the idea and funding came from an Arab president, widely thought to be [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] of Libya, itself an OPEC member. Fellow militants [[Bassam Abu Sharif]] and Klein claimed that Carlos received and kept a ransom between US$20&nbsp;million and US$50&nbsp;million from \"an Arab president\".

One thing is for sure: Current prices [roughly US$60/bbl] do not support all producers.</blockquote>\n\nA year later, when OPEC met in Vienna on 4 December 2015, the organization had exceeded its production ceiling for 18 consecutive months, US oil production had declined only slightly from its peak, world markets appeared to be oversupplied by at least 2 million barrels per day despite [[Libyan Civil War (2014\u2013present)|war-torn Libya]] pumping 1 million barrels below capacity, oil producers were making major adjustments to withstand prices as low as the $40s, Indonesia was rejoining the export organization, Iraqi production had surged after years of disorder, Iranian output was poised to rebound with the lifting of [[Sanctions against Iran|international sanctions]], hundreds of world leaders at the [[Paris Climate Agreement]] were committing to limit carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and [[Solar power#Economics|solar technologies]] were becoming steadily more competitive and prevalent. In light of all these market pressures, OPEC decided to set aside its ineffective production ceiling until the next ministerial conference in June 2016.<ref name=FT2015>{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1f84e444-9ceb-11e5-8ce1-f6219b685d74.html |title=OPEC discord fuels further oil price drop |newspaper=The Financial Times |date=7 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=glut>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/opec-maintains-crude-production-as-group-defers-output-target-ihryzilb |title=OPEC Won't Cut Production to Stop Oil's Slump |first1=Grant |last1=Smith |first2=Angelina |last2=Rascouet |first3=Wael |last3=Mahdi |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=4 December 2015 |access-date=10 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328111428/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/opec-maintains-crude-production-as-group-defers-output-target-ihryzilb |archive-date=28 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis_includes/countries_long/Libya/libya.pdf |title=Country Analysis Brief: Libya |publisher=US Energy Information Administration |date=19 November 2015 |accessdate=22 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223160212/http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis_includes/countries_long/Libya/libya.pdf |archive-date=23 December 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/05/business/energy-environment/opec-meeting-oil-production-price.html |title=Despite Climate Concerns, OPEC Plans to Keep Pumping Oil While It Can |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 December 2015 |access-date=11 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128123133/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/05/business/energy-environment/opec-meeting-oil-production-price.html |archive-date=28 January 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.argusmedia.com/pages/NewsBody.aspx?id=1148950&menu=yes |title=OPEC ceiling falls in |publisher=Argus Media |date=7 December 2015 |access-date=7 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208105422/http://www.argusmedia.com/pages/NewsBody.aspx?id=1148950&menu=yes |archive-date=8 December 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-02/iran-says-post-sanctions-crude-output-boost-won-t-hurt-prices |title=Iran Says Post-Sanctions Crude Output Boost Won't Hurt Prices |first1=Hashem |last1=Kalantari |first2=Mohammed |last2=Sergie |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=2 January 2016 |accessdate=18 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115230602/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-02/iran-says-post-sanctions-crude-output-boost-won-t-hurt-prices |archive-date=15 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> By 20 January 2016, the OPEC Reference Basket was down to US$22.48/bbl \u2013 less than one-fourth of its high from June 2014 ($110.48), less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($140.73), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up.<ref name=basketprice>{{cite web |url=http://www.opec.org/basket/basketDayArchives.xml |title=OPEC Basket Daily Archives |work=OPEC |accessdate=21 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121231540/http://www.opec.org/basket/basketDayArchives.xml |archive-date=21 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAs 2016 continued, the oil glut was partially trimmed with significant production offline in the US, Canada, Libya, Nigeria and China, and the basket price gradually rose back into the $40s.

Despite many political obstacles, a September 2016 decision to trim approximately 1 million barrels per day was codified by a new quota-agreement at the November 2016 OPEC conference. The agreement (which exempted disruption-ridden members Libya and Nigeria) covered the first half of 2017 \u2013 alongside promised reductions from Russia and ten other non-members, offset by expected increases in the US shale-sector, Libya, Nigeria, [[#Spare capacity|spare capacity]], and surging late-2016 OPEC production before the cuts took effect. Indonesia announced another \"temporary suspension\" of its OPEC membership rather than accepting the organization's requested 5-percent production-cut. Prices fluctuated around US$50/bbl, and in May 2017 OPEC decided to extend the new quotas through March 2018, with the world waiting to see if and how the oil-inventory glut might be fully siphoned-off by then.<ref name=LeavingAgain/><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-30/opec-decision-day-as-ministers-meet-to-salvage-deal-on-oil-cuts | title= OPEC Agrees to Cut Production in Drive to End Record Glut | publisher= Bloomberg News | date= 30 November 2016 |access-date= 30 November 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161201020159/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-30/opec-decision-day-as-ministers-meet-to-salvage-deal-on-oil-cuts |archive-date= 1 December 2016 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url= http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/3912.htm |title= OPEC 171st Meeting concludes |work=OPEC |date=30 November 2016 |access-date=30 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201015438/http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/3912.htm |archive-date=1 December 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-20/the-world-s-biggest-oil-kingdom-reverses-course |title=The World's Biggest Oil Kingdom Reverses Course |first=Javier |last=Blas |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=20 October 2016 |access-date=10 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406180755/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-20/the-world-s-biggest-oil-kingdom-reverses-course |archive-date=6 April 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/01ab26c7-3af5-3c54-96fd-8237d66e17c6 |title=OPEC agrees on need for output cut |first=Neil |last=Hume |newspaper=The Financial Times |date=28 September 2016 |access-date=28 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928201057/https://www.ft.com/content/01ab26c7-3af5-3c54-96fd-8237d66e17c6 |archive-date=28 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-11/russian-energy-minister-says-oil-output-cuts-to-start-in-january |title=Russian Energy Minister Says Oil Cuts to Start in January |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=11 December 2016 |access-date=12 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213115632/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-11/russian-energy-minister-says-oil-output-cuts-to-start-in-january |archive-date=13 December 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=May2017Vienna/> Longtime oil analyst [[Daniel Yergin]] \"described the relationship between OPEC and shale as 'mutual coexistence', with both sides learning to live with prices that are lower than they would like.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-07/opec-said-to-break-bread-with-shale-in-rare-show-of-detente |title=OPEC Said to Break Bread With Shale in Rare Show of Detente |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=7 March 2017 |access-date=8 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307220233/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-07/opec-said-to-break-bread-with-shale-in-rare-show-of-detente |archive-date=7 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> These production cut deals with non-OPEC countries are generally referred to{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} as '''OPEC+'''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Where OPEC+ Oil Production Stands Now -

Both oil ministers were angered by the price cuts, and the two led their fellow delegates to establish the Maadi Pact or Gentlemen's Agreement, calling for an \"Oil Consultation Commission\" of exporting countries, to which MOCs should present price-change plans. Jablonski reported a marked hostility toward the West and a growing outcry against \"[[absentee landlord]]ism\" of the MOCs, which at the time controlled all oil operations within the exporting countries and wielded enormous political influence. In August 1960, ignoring the warnings, and with the US favoring Canadian and Mexican oil for strategic reasons, the MOCs again unilaterally announced significant cuts in their posted prices for Middle Eastern crude oil.<ref name=\"open\"/><ref name=\"prize\">{{cite book |first=Daniel |last=Yergin |authorlink=Daniel Yergin |title=The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1991 |isbn=978-0671502485 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/prize00dani/page/499 499\u2013503] |title-link=The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Painter |first=David S. |year=2012 |title=Oil and the American Century |url=http://jah.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/1/24.full.pdf |journal=[[The Journal of American History]] |volume=99 |issue=1 |pages=24\u201339 |doi=10.1093/jahist/jas073 |access-date=4 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010181915/http://jah.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/1/24.full.pdf |archive-date=10 October 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bBvz_YxlB-AC&pg=PA7 |title=Historical Dictionary of the Petroleum Industry |first=M.S. |last=Vassiliou |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0810862883 |page=7}}</ref>\n\n===1960\u20131975 founding and expansion===\n[[File:Opec Geb\u00e4ude Wien Helferstorferstra\u00dfe 17.jpg|thumb|alt=refer to caption|OPEC headquarters in Vienna<br />(2009 building)]]\nThe following month, during 10\u201314 September 1960, the Baghdad Conference was held at the initiative of Tariki, P\u00e9rez Alfonzo, and Iraqi prime minister [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]], whose country had skipped the 1959 congress.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8U_sWfvgToQC&pg=PA74 |last=Styan |first=David |title=France and Iraq: Oil, Arms and French Policy Making in the Middle East |publisher=I.B.

Despite many political obstacles, a September 2016 decision to trim approximately 1 million barrels per day was codified by a new quota-agreement at the November 2016 OPEC conference. The agreement (which exempted disruption-ridden members Libya and Nigeria) covered the first half of 2017 \u2013 alongside promised reductions from Russia and ten other non-members, offset by expected increases in the US shale-sector, Libya, Nigeria, [[#Spare capacity|spare capacity]], and surging late-2016 OPEC production before the cuts took effect. Indonesia announced another \"temporary suspension\" of its OPEC membership rather than accepting the organization's requested 5-percent production-cut. Prices fluctuated around US$50/bbl, and in May 2017 OPEC decided to extend the new quotas through March 2018, with the world waiting to see if and how the oil-inventory glut might be fully siphoned-off by then.<ref name=LeavingAgain/><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-30/opec-decision-day-as-ministers-meet-to-salvage-deal-on-oil-cuts | title= OPEC Agrees to Cut Production in Drive to End Record Glut | publisher= Bloomberg News | date= 30 November 2016 |access-date= 30 November 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161201020159/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-30/opec-decision-day-as-ministers-meet-to-salvage-deal-on-oil-cuts |archive-date= 1 December 2016 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url= http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/3912.htm |title= OPEC 171st Meeting concludes |work=OPEC |date=30 November 2016 |access-date=30 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201015438/http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/3912.htm |archive-date=1 December 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-20/the-world-s-biggest-oil-kingdom-reverses-course |title=The World's Biggest Oil Kingdom Reverses Course |first=Javier |last=Blas |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=20 October 2016 |access-date=10 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406180755/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-20/the-world-s-biggest-oil-kingdom-reverses-course |archive-date=6 April 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/01ab26c7-3af5-3c54-96fd-8237d66e17c6 |title=OPEC agrees on need for output cut |first=Neil |last=Hume |newspaper=The Financial Times |date=28 September 2016 |access-date=28 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928201057/https://www.ft.com/content/01ab26c7-3af5-3c54-96fd-8237d66e17c6 |archive-date=28 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-11/russian-energy-minister-says-oil-output-cuts-to-start-in-january |title=Russian Energy Minister Says Oil Cuts to Start in January |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=11 December 2016 |access-date=12 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213115632/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-11/russian-energy-minister-says-oil-output-cuts-to-start-in-january |archive-date=13 December 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=May2017Vienna/> Longtime oil analyst [[Daniel Yergin]] \"described the relationship between OPEC and shale as 'mutual coexistence', with both sides learning to live with prices that are lower than they would like.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-07/opec-said-to-break-bread-with-shale-in-rare-show-of-detente |title=OPEC Said to Break Bread With Shale in Rare Show of Detente |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=7 March 2017 |access-date=8 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307220233/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-07/opec-said-to-break-bread-with-shale-in-rare-show-of-detente |archive-date=7 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> These production cut deals with non-OPEC countries are generally referred to{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} as '''OPEC+'''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Where OPEC+ Oil Production Stands Now -

He served as the chairman and [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Starbucks|Starbucks Coffee Corporation]] for more than two decades; first from 1986 to 2000, and then from 2008 to 2017. After stepping down as CEO, Schultz stayed at the company from 2017 to 2018 as its executive chairman overseeing Starbucks's philanthropic and charitable giving arm. Leading the firm for nearly four decades, he is the [[Starbucks#History|longest-serving head]] of the coffeehouse. Schultz owned the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] from 2001 to 2006, a basketball franchise that he sold for US$350 million to [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]], who [[Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City|moved the NBA team]] to Oklahoma creating the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]. <!--The lack of citations is purposeful.

The large lead is OK given the content in the article and Wikipedia's MOS:INTRO policy.-->\n\nBorn and raised in the [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn borough]] of New York, Schultz graduated from [[Northern Michigan University]] in 1975. After briefly selling office equipment door-to-door one of his early clients, the then coffeehouse startup Starbucks, onboarded him as their marketing and operations head in 1982. A business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] and the [[Coffee in Italy|country's coffee culture]] inspired him to open Il Giornale, a specialty coffeeshop that  merged with Starbucks during the late-1980s. Schultz pushed the new company to sell more than coffee beans and equipment, quickly establishing a large network of stores that served espresso, coffee, teas, and casual food. Following large-scale distribution deals \u2013 particularly with major hotels, groceries, and bookstores \u2013 Starbucks became the [[List of coffeehouse chains|largest coffee-house chain]] in the world.<!--Cited in body.--> Schultz took the company [[Initial public offering|public]] in 1992 and used a $271 million valuation to double their store count in a series of  highly publicized [[coffee wars]]. He stepped down in 2000 to focus on Starbucks' international expansion, succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]].<!--Second tenure as CEO, 2008 to 2017.-->\n\nDuring the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]], Schultz returned as chief executive to stabilize the company after years of unsustainable growth. Succeeding [[Jim Donald (businessman)|Jim Donald]], Schultz led a mass-firing of executives, shuttered hundreds of weak stores, and temporarily closed all U.S. stores to retrain employees in making espresso. He orchestrated multiple acquisitions of American and Chinese beverage companies, introduced a national [[loyalty program]], and enforced [[Fair trade coffee|fair trade]] standards. His aggressive expansion in Chinese markets has been credited with reconciling the [[Chinese tea culture|country's tea-culture]] with [[Coffee production in China|coffee consumption in China]]. Schultz's positioning of Starbucks as a social hub (\"[[Howard Schultz#Career|third place]]\") is widely seen as introducing the [[Third wave of coffee#History|second wave]] of coffee culture in the U.S., particularly in [[Seattle]]. His second tenure sustained both<!--Cited in body.--> [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant and sustained criticism]] as well as growth, ultimately adding nearly $100 billion in [[market capitalization]] to the company, a 21,000% increase in [[shareholder value]]. <!--Cited in body.-->Schultz was succeeded by [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] as CEO in April 2017, and has, since 2018, retained the title \"Chairman emeritus\" of Starbucks. \n\nA noted author of business literature, he has [[Howard Schultz#Author|written four books]]: ''Pour Your Heart Into It'' (1997), ''Onward'' (2011), ''For Love of Country'' (2014) and ''From the Ground Up'' (2019). Long known for his outspoken [[Centrism|politically centrist]] views, Schultz considered a candidacy in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]], [[2016 United States presidential election|2016,]] and [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 U.S. presidential elections]] as an independent candidate. He declined to join all three contests because of the [[Political parties in the United States|two-party system]] and fears of [[Spoiler effect|splitting the vote]]. Schultz supports [[bipartisanship]] across the political spectrum and is widely considered to be a [[New Democrats|centrist Democrat]] ideologically. His positions on domestic politics are socially liberal and [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscally moderate]]. In foreign policy, he is seen as a \"[[liberal hawk]]\", favoring [[Polarity (international relations)|American-led]] international affairs and [[Neoliberalism (international relations)|institutionalism]]. Schultz was named the [[The World's Billionaires|680th-richest person in the U.S.]] by ''Forbes'' with a [[net worth]] of $4.0 billion (April 2020).<ref name=\":26\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-schultz/#6de1621452c6|title=Howard Schultz|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2019}}</ref> To further his private philanthropic efforts, he established the Schultz Family Foundation which focuses on helping military veterans and fighting [[youth unemployment]].<!--Leave space for {{TOC}}.-->\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHoward D.

He served as the chairman and [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Starbucks|Starbucks Coffee Corporation]] for more than two decades; first from 1986 to 2000, and then from 2008 to 2017. After stepping down as CEO, Schultz stayed at the company from 2017 to 2018 as its executive chairman overseeing Starbucks's philanthropic and charitable giving arm. Leading the firm for nearly four decades, he is the [[Starbucks#History|longest-serving head]] of the coffeehouse. Schultz owned the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] from 2001 to 2006, a basketball franchise that he sold for US$350 million to [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]], who [[Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City|moved the NBA team]] to Oklahoma creating the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]. <!--The lack of citations is purposeful.

The large lead is OK given the content in the article and Wikipedia's MOS:INTRO policy.-->\n\nBorn and raised in the [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn borough]] of New York, Schultz graduated from [[Northern Michigan University]] in 1975. After briefly selling office equipment door-to-door one of his early clients, the then coffeehouse startup Starbucks, onboarded him as their marketing and operations head in 1982. A business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] and the [[Coffee in Italy|country's coffee culture]] inspired him to open Il Giornale, a specialty coffeeshop that  merged with Starbucks during the late-1980s. Schultz pushed the new company to sell more than coffee beans and equipment, quickly establishing a large network of stores that served espresso, coffee, teas, and casual food. Following large-scale distribution deals \u2013 particularly with major hotels, groceries, and bookstores \u2013 Starbucks became the [[List of coffeehouse chains|largest coffee-house chain]] in the world.<!--Cited in body.--> Schultz took the company [[Initial public offering|public]] in 1992 and used a $271 million valuation to double their store count in a series of  highly publicized [[coffee wars]]. He stepped down in 2000 to focus on Starbucks' international expansion, succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]].<!--Second tenure as CEO, 2008 to 2017.-->\n\nDuring the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]], Schultz returned as chief executive to stabilize the company after years of unsustainable growth. Succeeding [[Jim Donald (businessman)|Jim Donald]], Schultz led a mass-firing of executives, shuttered hundreds of weak stores, and temporarily closed all U.S. stores to retrain employees in making espresso. He orchestrated multiple acquisitions of American and Chinese beverage companies, introduced a national [[loyalty program]], and enforced [[Fair trade coffee|fair trade]] standards. His aggressive expansion in Chinese markets has been credited with reconciling the [[Chinese tea culture|country's tea-culture]] with [[Coffee production in China|coffee consumption in China]]. Schultz's positioning of Starbucks as a social hub (\"[[Howard Schultz#Career|third place]]\") is widely seen as introducing the [[Third wave of coffee#History|second wave]] of coffee culture in the U.S., particularly in [[Seattle]]. His second tenure sustained both<!--Cited in body.--> [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant and sustained criticism]] as well as growth, ultimately adding nearly $100 billion in [[market capitalization]] to the company, a 21,000% increase in [[shareholder value]]. <!--Cited in body.-->Schultz was succeeded by [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] as CEO in April 2017, and has, since 2018, retained the title \"Chairman emeritus\" of Starbucks. \n\nA noted author of business literature, he has [[Howard Schultz#Author|written four books]]: ''Pour Your Heart Into It'' (1997), ''Onward'' (2011), ''For Love of Country'' (2014) and ''From the Ground Up'' (2019). Long known for his outspoken [[Centrism|politically centrist]] views, Schultz considered a candidacy in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]], [[2016 United States presidential election|2016,]] and [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 U.S. presidential elections]] as an independent candidate. He declined to join all three contests because of the [[Political parties in the United States|two-party system]] and fears of [[Spoiler effect|splitting the vote]]. Schultz supports [[bipartisanship]] across the political spectrum and is widely considered to be a [[New Democrats|centrist Democrat]] ideologically. His positions on domestic politics are culturally liberal and [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscally moderate]]. In foreign policy, he is seen as a \"[[liberal hawk]]\", favoring [[Polarity (international relations)|American-led]] international affairs and [[Neoliberalism (international relations)|institutionalism]]. Schultz was named the [[The World's Billionaires|680th-richest person in the U.S.]] by ''Forbes'' with a [[net worth]] of $4.0 billion (April 2020).<ref name=\":26\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-schultz/#6de1621452c6|title=Howard Schultz|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2019}}</ref> To further his private philanthropic efforts, he established the Schultz Family Foundation which focuses on helping military veterans and fighting [[youth unemployment]].<!--Leave space for {{TOC}}.-->\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHoward D.
