Offering of sacrifices was briefly reinstated during the [[Jewish\u2013Roman wars]] of the second century CE and was continued in certain communities thereafter.<ref name=\"jewfaq.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jewfaq.org/qorbanot.htm |title=Qorbanot: Sacrifices and Offerings |last=Rich |first=Tracey R. |date=1998\u20132011 |website=Judaism 101 |publisher= |access-date=27 August 2017 |quote=}}</ref><ref name=\"straightdope.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2091/why-do-jews-no-longer-sacrifice-animals |title=Why do Jews no longer sacrifice animals? |author=Straight Dope Science Advisory Board |date=17 April 2003 |website=The Straight Dope |publisher= |access-date=27 August 2017 |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://the-tabernacle-place.com/articles/what_is_the_tabernacle |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427011353/http://the-tabernacle-place.com/articles/what_is_the_tabernacle |archive-date=2016-04-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWhen [[sacrifice]]s were offered in ancient times, they were offered as a fulfillment of the [[613 commandments]].

Besides this one exception, there were the overwhelming majority of other purposes for bringing korbanot, and the expiatory effect is often incidental, and is subject to significant limitations.

Sins in Judaism consist of different grades of severity:<ref name=\"JE.SIN\"/>\n* The lightest is the ''\u1e25e\u1e6d'', ''\u1e25a\u1e6d\u1e6da'ah'', or ''\u1e25a\u1e6d\u1e6dat''  (lit. \"fault,\" \"shortcoming,\" \"misstep\"), an infraction of a commandment committed in ignorance of the existence or meaning of that command.\n* The second kind is the ''awon'', a breach of a minor commandment committed with a full knowledge of the existence and nature of that commandment (''bemezid''). \n* The gravest kind is the ''pesha'' or ''mered'', a presumptuous and rebellious act against God. Its worst form is the ''resha'', such an act committed with a wicked intention.\nThese three terms are mentioned by the Psalmist (cvi. 6): \"We have sinned [''\u1e25a\u1e6da'nu''], . . . we have committed iniquity [''he-'ewinu''], we have done wickedly [''hirsha'nu]''\" (comp.

The Prophets disparaged sacrifices that were offered without a regeneration of the heart, i.e., a determined turning from sin and returning to God by striving after righteousness ([[Book of Hosea]] 14:1-2, Joel 2:13, Micah 6:6-8). At the same time, prophets stressed the importance of offerings combined with justice and good even as they taught that offerings were unacceptable unless combined with heartfelt repentance and good deeds. [[Malachi]], the last prophet in the Hebrew Bible, emphasized that the goal of repentance is not to end sacrifices, but to make the offerings fit for acceptance once again ([[Book of Malachi]], 3:3-4). Similarly, the [[Book of Isaiah]] despite disparagement of sacrifices without justice, portrays sacrifice as having a role complementary with prayer in a universalistic [[eschatology]] (Isaiah 56:1; 6-7).\n\n==Rabbinical interpretation==\n\n===100 among the 613 commandments===\nAccording to [[Maimonides]], about one hundred of the permanent [[613 commandments]] based on the Torah, by rabbinical enumeration, directly concern sacrifices, excluding those commandments that concern the actual Temple and the priests themselves of which there are about another fifty.<ref>\n# Not to burn anything on the Golden Altar besides incense (Exodus 30:9)\n# To offer only unblemished animals (Leviticus 22:21)\n# Not to dedicate a blemished animal for the altar (Leviticus 22:20)\n# Not to slaughter it (Leviticus 22:22)\n# Not to sprinkle its blood (Leviticus 22:24)\n# Not to burn its ''[[Chelev|khelev]]'' (Leviticus 22:22)\n# Not to offer a temporarily blemished animal (Deuteronomy 17:1)\n# Not to sacrifice blemished animals even if offered by non-Jews (Leviticus 22:25)\n# Not to inflict wounds upon dedicated animals (Leviticus 22:21)\n# To redeem dedicated animals which have become disqualified (Deuteronomy 12:15)\n# To offer only animals which are at least eight days old (Leviticus 22:27)\n# Not to offer animals bought with the wages of a harlot or the animal exchanged for a dog (Deuteronomy 23:19)\n# Not to burn honey or yeast on the altar (Leviticus 2:11)\n# To salt all sacrifices (Leviticus 2:13)\n# Not to omit the salt from sacrifices (Leviticus 2:13)\n# Carry out the procedure of the burnt offering as prescribed in the Torah (Leviticus 1:3)\n# Not to eat its meat (Deuteronomy 12:17)\n# Carry out the procedure of the sin offering (Leviticus 6:18)\n# Not to eat the meat of the inner sin offering (Leviticus 6:23)\n# Not to decapitate a fowl brought as a sin offering (Leviticus 5:8)\n# Carry out the procedure of the guilt offering (Leviticus 7:1)\n# The ''kohanim'' must eat the sacrificial meat in the Temple (Exodus 29:33)\n# The ''kohanim'' must not eat the meat outside the Temple courtyard (Deuteronomy 12:17)\n# A non-''kohen'' must not eat sacrificial meat (Exodus 29:33)\n# To follow the procedure of the peace offering (Leviticus 7:11)\n# Not to eat the meat of minor sacrifices before sprinkling the blood (Deuteronomy 12:17)\n# To bring meal offerings as prescribed in the Torah (Leviticus 2:1)\n# Not to put oil on the meal offerings of wrongdoers (Leviticus 5:11)\n# Not to put frankincense on the meal offerings of wrongdoers (Leviticus 3:11)\n# Not to eat the meal offering of the High Priest (Leviticus 6:16)\n# Not to bake a meal offering as leavened bread (Leviticus 6:10)\n# The ''kohanim'' must eat the remains of the meal offerings (Leviticus 6:9)\n# To bring all avowed and freewill offerings to the Temple on the first subsequent festival (Deuteronomy 12:5-6)\n# To offer all sacrifices in the Temple (Deuteronomy 12:11)\n# To bring all sacrifices from outside Israel to the Temple (Deuteronomy 12:26)\n# Not to slaughter sacrifices outside the courtyard (of the Temple) (Leviticus 17:4)\n# Not to offer any sacrifices outside the courtyard (of the Temple) (Deuteronomy 12:13)\n# To offer two lambs every day (Numbers 28:3)\n# To light a fire on the altar every day (Leviticus 6:6)\n# Not to extinguish this fire (Leviticus 6:6)\n# To remove the ashes from the altar every day (Leviticus 6:3)\n# To burn incense every day (Exodus 30:7)\n# The ''Kohen Gadol'' must bring a meal offering every day (Leviticus 6:13)\n# To bring two additional lambs as burnt offerings on Shabbat (Numbers 28:9)\n# To bring additional offerings on the New Month (''[[Rosh Khodesh]]'') (Numbers 28:11)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Passover]] (Numbers 28:19)\n# To offer the wave offering from the meal of the new wheat (Leviticus 23:10)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Shavuot]] (Numbers 28:26)\n# To bring two leaves to accompany the above sacrifice (Leviticus 23:17)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Rosh Hashana]] (Numbers 29:2)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Yom Kippur]] (Numbers 29:8)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Sukkot]] (Numbers 29:13)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Shmini Atzeret]] (Numbers 29:35)\n# Not to eat sacrifices which have become unfit or blemished (Deuteronomy 14:3)\n# Not to eat from sacrifices offered with improper intentions (Leviticus 7:18)\n# Not to leave sacrifices past the time allowed for eating them (Leviticus 22:30)\n# Not to eat from that which was left over (Leviticus 19:8)\n# Not to eat from sacrifices which became impure (Leviticus 7:19)\n# An impure person must not eat from sacrifices (Leviticus 7:20)\n# To burn the leftover sacrifices (Leviticus 7:17)\n# To burn all impure sacrifices (Leviticus 7:19)\n# To follow the [sacrificial] procedure of Yom Kippur in the sequence prescribed in ''Parshah [[Acharei]] Mot'' (After the death of [[Aaron]]'s sons...)

In addition, large parts of every other book of the Talmud discuss various kinds of sacrifices. ''Pesachim'' is largely devoted to a discussion of how to offer the [[Passover sacrifice]]. ''Yoma'' contains a detailed discussion of the offerings and Temple ritual on Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement), and there are sections in ''seder Moed'' (Festivals) for the special offerings and Temple ritual for other major Jewish holidays. ''Sheqalim'' discusses the annual half-shekel offering for Temple maintenance and Temple governance and management, ''Nashim'' discusses the offerings made by [[Nazirite]]s and the suspected adultress, etc.\n\nThe Talmud provides extensive details not only on how to perform sacrifices but how to adjudicate difficult cases, such what to do if a mistake was made and whether improperly performing one of the required ritual elements invalidates it or not. The Talmud explains how to roast the Passover offering, how to dash blood from different kinds of sacrifices upon the altar, how to prepare the incense, the regulatory code for the system of taxation that financed the priesthood and public sacrifices, and numerous other details.\n\n===Rationale and rabbinic commentary===\n[[Maimonides]], a medieval Jewish scholar, drew on the early critiques of the need for sacrifice, taking the view that God always held sacrifice inferior to prayer and philosophical meditation. However, God understood that the Israelites were used to the animal sacrifices that the surrounding pagan tribes used as the primary way to commune with their gods. As such, in Maimonides' view, it was only natural that Israelites would believe that sacrifice would be a necessary part of the relationship between God and man. Maimonides concludes that God's decision to allow sacrifices was a concession to human psychological limitations. It would have been too much to have expected the Israelites to leap from pagan worship to prayer and meditation in one step. In ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', he writes:\n{{quote|But the custom which was in those days general among men, and the general mode of worship in which the Israelites were brought up consisted in sacrificing animals... It was in accordance with the wisdom and plan of God...that God did not command us to give up and to discontinue all these manners of service. For to obey such a commandment would have been contrary to the nature of man, who generally cleaves to that to which he is used; it would in those days have made the same impression as a prophet would make at present [the 12th Century] if he called us to the service of God and told us in His name, that we should not pray to God nor fast, nor seek His help in time of trouble; that we should serve Him in thought, and not by any action.<ref>Book III, Chapter 32. Translated by M. Friedlander, 1904, ''The Guide for the Perplexed'', Dover Publications, 1956 edition</ref>}}\n\nIn contrast, many others such as [[Nahmanides]] (in his commentary on Leviticus 1:9) disagreed. Nahmanides cites the fact that the Torah records the practices of animal and other sacrifices from the times of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]] and earlier. Indeed, the purpose of recounting the [[Binding of Isaac|near sacrifice of Isaac]] was to illustrate the sublime significance and need of animal sacrifices as supplanting the abomination of human sacrifices.\n\n===In spiritual practice===\nThe korban also has a spiritual meaning, and refers to some part of an individual's ego, which is given up as a sacrifice to God in honor of the mortality of the worshipper. In keeping with the root of the word, meaning to draw close, and to the common usage as the sacrifice of an animal, so too can the worshipper sacrifice something of this world in order to become closer to God.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =  Dubov\n  | first =  Nissan Dovid \n  | title = Jewish Meditation\n  | publisher =Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center\n  | url = http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=361886\n  | accessdate =  2006-08-17}}</ref>\n\n==The end of sacrifices==\nWith the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem by the Romans, the Jewish practice of offering korbanot stopped for all intents and purposes. Despite subsequent intermittent periods of small Jewish groups offering the traditional sacrifices on the Temple Mount, the practice effectively ended.\n\n[[Rabbinic Judaism]] was forced to undergo a significant development in response to this change; no longer could Judaism revolve around the Temple services. The destruction of the Temple led to a development of Judaism in the direction of text study, prayer, and personal observance. [[Orthodox Judaism]] regards this as being largely an alternative way of fulfilling the obligations of the Temple. Other branches of Judaism ([[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]]) regard the korbanot as an ancient ritual that will not return. A range of responses is recorded in classical rabbinic literature, describing this subject.\n\n:Once, Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai was walking with his disciple, Rabbi Y'hoshua, near Jerusalem after the destruction of the Temple. Rabbi Y'hoshua looked at the Temple ruins and said \"Alas for us!! The place that atoned for the sins of the people Israel lies in ruins!\" Then Rabbi Yohannan ben Zakkai spoke to him these words of comfort:  'Be not grieved, my son. There is another equally meritorious way of gaining ritual atonement, even though the Temple is destroyed. We can still gain ritual atonement through deeds of loving-kindness. For it is written \"Loving kindness I desire, not sacrifice.\" (Hosea 6:6)\n:[[Midrash]] Avot D'Rabbi Nathan 4:5\n\nIn the [[Babylonian Talmud]], a number of sages opined that following Jewish law, doing charitable deeds, and studying Jewish texts is greater than performing animal sacrifices.\n\n:Rabbi Elazar said: Doing righteous deeds of charity is greater than offering all of the sacrifices, as it is written: \"Doing charity and justice is more desirable to the Lord than sacrifice\" (Proverbs 21:3).\n:Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah 49\n\nNonetheless, numerous texts of the Talmud stress the importance of and hope for eventual re-introduction of sacrifices, and regard their loss as a terrible tragedy. Partaking of sacrificial offerings was compared to eating directly at one's Father's table, whose loss synagogue worship does not quite entirely replace. One example is in ''Berachot'':\n:And I said to him: I heard a heavenly voice that was cooing like a dove and saying, \"Woe to the children because of whose sins I destroyed My house, and burned My temple, and exiled them among the nations of the world. And he [Elijah the prophet] said to me: \"By your life and the life of your head! It is not only at this moment that [the heavenly voice] says this. But on each and every day it says this three times. And not only this, but at the time that the people of Israel enter the synagogues and houses of study, and respond (in the [[Kaddish]]) \"May His great name be blessed\", the Holy One, Blessed is He, shakes His head and says: \"Fortunate for the king who is praised this way in his house. What is there for the Father who has exiled His children. And woe to the children who have been exiled from their Father's table.\"  (Talmud ''Berachot'' 3a).\n\nAnother example is in ''Sheqalim'':\n:Rabbi Akiva said: Shimon Ben Loga related the following to me: I was once collecting grasses, and I saw a child from the [[House of Avitnas]] (the incense-makers). And I saw that he cried, and I saw that he laughed. I said to him, \"My son, why did you cry?\" He said, Because of the glory of my Father's house that has decreased.\" I asked \"And why did you laugh?\" He said to me \"Because of the glory prepared for the righteous in the future.\" I asked \"And what did you see?\" [that brought on these emotions]. \"The herb ''[[Maaleh Ashan|maaleh ashan]]'' is growing next to me. [''Maaleh Ashan'' is the secret ingredient in the incense that made the smoke rise, which according to the Talmud the [[House of Avitnas]] never revealed.]\"\n\n===Liturgical attention to end of sacrifices===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nNumerous details of the daily religious practice of an ordinary Jew are connected to keeping memory of the rhythm of the life of the Temple and its sacrifices. For example, the Mishna begins with a statement that the [[Shema Yisrael]] prayer is to be recited in the evening at the time when Kohanim who were ''[[Tumah and taharah|tamei]]'' (ritually impure) are permitted to enter to eat their [[heave offering]] (a food-tithe given to priests) following purification. A detailed discussion of the obligations of tithing, ritual purity, and other elements central to the Temple and priesthood is required in order to determine the meaning of this contemporary daily Jewish obligation.\n\n===Other occasions===\nJewish services for [[Shabbat]], Jewish holidays and other occasions include special prayers for the restoration of sacrifices. For example, the traditional Yom Kippur liturgy contains repeated prayers for the restoration of sacrifices and every [[High Holiday]] [[Amidah]] contains [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 56:7:\n:Even them will I bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer; their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be acceptable upon Mine altar; for My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.<ref name=\"mechon-mamre.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1056.htm|title=Isaiah 56 / Hebrew - English Bible / Mechon-Mamre|website=www.mechon-mamre.org}}</ref>\n\n==Modern view and resumption of sacrifices==\n\n===Future of sacrifices in Judaism===\n{{see also| Temple in Jerusalem}}\nThe prevailing belief among rabbinic Jews is that in the [[Messianic Age|messianic era]], the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]] will come and a [[Third Temple]] will be built. It is believed that the korbanot will be reinstituted, but to what extent and for how long is unknown. Some biblical and classical rabbinic sources hold that most or all sacrifices will not need to be offered.\n\n* In the future all sacrifices, with the exception of the Thanksgiving-sacrifice, will be discontinued. (Midrash Vayikra Rabbah 9:7)\n* All sacrifices will be annulled in the future. (Tanchuma Emor 14, Vayikra Rabbah 9:7)\n* Then the grain-offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to God as in the days of old, and as in ancient years. (Malachi 3:4)\n* It is impossible to go suddenly from one extreme to the other;...the custom which was in those days general among all men, and the general mode of worship in which the Israelites were brought up consisted of sacrificing animals in the temples... For this reason God allowed this kind of service to continue.  The sacrificial system is not the primary object, rather supplications, and prayer. (Maimonides, The Guide to the Perplexed III 32)\n\nThe majority view of classical rabbis is that the Torah's commandments will still be applicable and in force during the messianic era. However, a significant minority of rabbis held that most of the commandments will be nullified in the messianic era, thus holding that sacrifices will not be reinstated. Examples of such rabbinic views include:\n* Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Niddah 61b and Tractate Shabbat 151b.\n* Midrash Shochar Tov (Mizmor 146:5) states that God will permit what is now forbidden.\n\n[[Orthodox Judaism]] holds that in the messianic era, most or all of the korbanot will be reinstituted, at least for a time. [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]], hold that no animal sacrifices will be offered in a rebuilt Temple at all, following the position of Tanchuma Emor 14 and Vayikra Rabbah 9:7.\n\n===Nineteenth and twentieth century===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nIn the 1800s a number of Orthodox rabbis studied the idea of reinstating korbanot on the Temple Mount, even though the messianic era had not yet arrived and the Temple was not rebuilt. A number of [[responsa]] concluded that within certain parameters, it is permissible according to Jewish law to offer such sacrifices.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, [[Israel Meir Kagan]] advised some followers to set up special ''[[yeshiva]]s'' for married students known as ''Qodshim [[Kolel]]im'' that would specialize in the study of the korbanot and study with greater intensity the ''qodshim'' sections of the [[Talmud]] in order to prepare for the arrival of the Jewish Messiah who would oversee the rebuilding of the original Temple of Solomon in [[Jerusalem]] that would be known as the [[Third Temple]]. His advice was taken seriously and today there are a number of well-established [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] institutions in [[Israel]] that focus solely on the subject of the korbanot, ''qodshim'', and the needs of the future Jewish Temple, such as the [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty]].\n\n===Efforts to restore korbanot===\n{{Main|The Third Temple}}\nA few groups, notably the [[Temple Institute]] and the [[Temple Mount Faithful]], have petitioned the Israeli government to rebuild a Third Temple on the [[Temple Mount]] and restore sacrificial worship. The Israeli government has not responded favorably. Most Orthodox Jews regard rebuilding a Temple as an activity for a Jewish Messiah as part of a future [[Jewish eschatology]], and most non-Orthodox Jews do not believe in the restoration of sacrificial worship at all. The Temple Institute has been constructing ritual objects in preparation for a resumption of sacrifices.\n\n==View among modern Jewish denominations==\n\n===Contemporary Orthodox Judaism===\nToday Orthodox Judaism includes mention of each korban on either a daily basis in the ''[[siddur]]'' (daily prayer book), or in the ''[[machzor]]'' (holiday prayerbook) as part of the prayers for the relevant days concerned. They are also referred to in the prayerbooks of Conservative Judaism, in an abbreviated fashion.\n\nOn each Jewish holiday the sections in the Torah mentioning that festival's korbanot is read out loud in [[synagogue]].\n\n====Daily services====\nIn the very early morning daily ''[[Shacharit]]'' prayers for example, they include the following in order of mention, actually called the korbanot. The following example is taken from the [[Nusach Ashkenaz]].\n* ''Kiyor'' Describing the basin containing pure water to wash up before touching the korbanot (offerings), based on Exodus 30: 17-21.<ref name=\"bible.ort.org\">http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=30</ref>\n* ''Trumat Hadeshen'' Removing the ashes of the ''korban olah'' (elevation offering), based on Leviticus 6:1-6.<ref>http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=3&CHAPTER=6</ref>\n* ''korban Tamid'' Perpetual daily offerings: \"...Fire-offering...male yearling [[sheep|lambs]] unblemished two a day...\" based on Numbers 28:1-8.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=4&CHAPTER=28</ref>\n* ''Ketoret'' [[Incense]] [from] [[spice]]s: \"...stacte, onycha, and galbanum, ...and [[frankincense]]...\" Based on Exodus 30:34-36;7-8...<ref name=\"bible.ort.org\"/>\"[[myrrh]], [[Cinnamomum cassia|cassia]], [[spikenard]], [[saffron]], costus, aromatic bark, [[cinnamon]], ley, [[salt]], [[amber]]...\" based on the Babylonian [[Talmud]] ''Kritut'' 6a; Jerusalem Talmud ''Yoma'' 4:5; 33a.\n* ''korban Musaf'' The additional offerings for [[Shabbat]]: \"On the Sabbath...two male lambs...fine [[flour]] for a meal offering mixed with oil and its [[wine]] libation...\" based on Numbers 28:9-10.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* ''korban Rosh Chodesh'' Offering for the new month: ...Two young [[bull]]s, one [[Sheep|ram]], seven lambs...fine flour ...mixed with [[olive oil]]...one he [[goat]]... and its wine libation.\" Based on Numbers 28: 11-15.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* ''Zevachim'' Chapter 5 of [[Mishnah]] ''Zevachim'' is then cited. (It was included in the ''siddur'' at this stage because it discusses all the sacrifices and the sages do not dispute within it):\n**A. ''Eizehu mekoman shel z'vachim'' Places for the ''zevachim korbanot'' to be offered: \"...The slaughter of the bull and the he-goat of Yom Kippur is in the north [of the altar]...\"\n**B. ''Parim hanisrafim'' [[Bull]]s that are completely burned: \"...These are burned in the place where the [altar] ashes are deposited.\"\n**C. ''Chatot hatzibur v'hayachid'' Sin offerings of the community and the individual: \"...The he-goats...are eaten within the [Temple courtyard] curtains by male priests...until midnight.\"\n**D. ''Ha'olah qodesh qodashim'' The elevation offering is among the offerings with a major-degree-of-holiness: \"...it is entirely consumed by fire.\"\n**E. ''Zivchei shalmei tzibur v'ashamot'' Communal peace offerings and guilt offerings: \"...are eaten within the [Temple courtyard] by males of the priesthood...until midnight.\"\n**F. ''Hatodah v'eil nazir qodashim kalim'' The thanksgiving offering and the ram of a Nazirite are offerings of a minor-degree holiness: \"They are eaten throughout the city [of Jerusalem] by anyone, prepared in any manner...until midnight...\"\n**G. ''Sh'lamim qodashim kalim'' The peace offerings are of lesser (lighter) holiness:  \"...Is eaten by the ''kohanim''...throughout the city [of Jerusalem] by anyone...\"\n**H. ''Hab'chor vehama'aser vehapesach qodashim kalim'' The firstborn and tithe of animals and the Passover offering are offerings of lesser (lighter) holiness: \"...The Passover offering is eaten only at night...only if roasted.\"\n* ''Rabbi Yishmael omer'' Rabbi Yishmael says: Through thirteen rules is the Torah elucidated. (Introduction to the ''Sifra'', part of the Oral Law).\n* ''Yehi Ratzon'' (Ending) The study session concludes with a prayer (\"May it be thy will...) for the restoration of the Temple in Jerusalem and the resumption of sacrifices. (...that the Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant our portion in your Torah and there we shall serve you with reverence as in days of old and in former years. And may the grain offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasing to God, as in days of old and in former years.\")\n\nThe [[Amidah]]\n* ''Retzai'' Every the Orthodox [[Amidah]], the central prayer of Jewish services, contains the paragraph: \"Be favorable, Oh Lord our God, to your people Israel and their prayer, and restore the service of the [[Holy of Holies]] of Your House, and accept the fire-offerings of Israel and their prayer with love and favor, and may the service of your people Israel always be favored.\" Conservative Judaism removes the fire-offerings clause from this prayer.\n* ''Yehi Ratzon'' Private recitiation of the Amidah traditionally ends with the ''Yehi Ratzon'' prayer for the restoration of the Temple.\n* The Amidah itself is said to represent liturgically the ''purpose'' of the daily korban, while the recitation of the korbanot sections fulfill the ''formal responsibility'' to perform them, in the absence of the Temple.\n\nThe weekday [[Torah reading]]\n* A set of blessings connected with the weekday Torah reading include a prayer for the [[Third Temple|restoration of the Temple]]: \"May it be the will before our Father who is in heaven to establish the House of our lives and to return his [[Shekhinah]]'' into our midst, speedily, in our days, and let us say Amen.\"\n\n===In Conservative Judaism===\nConservative Judaism disavows the resumption of qorbanot. Consistent with this view, it has deleted prayers for the resumption of sacrifices from the Conservative ''siddur'', including both the morning study section from the sacrifices, prayers for the restoration of qorbanot in the Amidah, and various mentions elsewhere. Consistent with its view that a priesthood and sacrificial system will not be restored, Conservative Judaism has also lifted certain restrictions on ''kohanim'', including limitations on marriage prohibiting marrying a divorced woman or a convert. Conservative Judaism does, however, believe in the restoration of a Temple in some form, and in the continuation of kohanim and [[Levites]] under relaxed requirements, and has retained references to both in its prayer books. Consistent with its stress on the continuity of tradition, many Conservative synagogues have also retained references to [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday|Festival]] qorbanot, changing all references to sacrifices into the past tense (e.g. the Orthodox \"and there we will sacrifice\" is changed to \"and there they sacrificed\"). Some more liberal Conservative synagogues, however, have removed all references to sacrifices, past or present, from the prayer service. The most recent official Conservative prayer book, [[Sim Shalom]], provides both service alternatives.\n\n===In Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism===\n[[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] disavow all belief in a restoration of a Temple, the resumption of qorbanot, or the continuation of identified Cohens or Levites. These branches of Judaism believe that all such practices represent ancient practices inconsistent with the requirements of modernity, and have removed all or virtually all references to qorbanot from their prayer books.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Corban}}\n* [[Abomination (Judaism)]]\n* [[Du\u0161ni Brav]]\n* [[Hakarat HaTov]]\n* [[Holy Qurbana]]\n* [[Incense offering]]\n* [[Kourbania]]\n* [[Priesthood (Ancient Israel)]]\n* [[Psalm 100]]\n* [[Qurbani]]\n* [[Red heifer]]\n* [[Wave offering]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[J.

[[Josephus]] also generally uses other words for \"offering\" but uses ''korban'' for the vow of the [[Nazirite|Nazirites]] ([[Antiquities of the Jews]] 4:73 / 4,4,4) and cites [[Theophrastus]] as having cited a korban vow among the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrians]] (''[[Against Apion]]'' 1.167 / 1,22,4).<ref>S Zeitlin ''Korban'' The Jewish Quarterly Review, 1962 - JSTOR \"Josephus, in Against Apion, who endeavored to ...

Besides this one exception, there were the overwhelming majority of other purposes for bringing korbanot, and the expiatory effect is often incidental, and is subject to significant limitations. Korbanot are brought purely for the purpose of communing with God and becoming closer to him. Also, they were brought for the purpose of expressing thanks, gratitude, and love to [[God in Judaism|God]].<ref name=\"jewishvirtuallibrary.org\">{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/qorbanot.html |title=Jewish Practices & Rituals: Sacrifices and Offerings (Karbanot) |last= |first= |date= |website=Jewish Virtual Library |publisher=AICE |access-date=27 August 2017 |quote=}}\n</ref>\n\nFurther, the use of korbanot was circumscribed for certain types of sins. Sins in Judaism consist of different grades of severity:<ref name=\"JE.SIN\"/>\n* The lightest is the ''\u1e25e\u1e6d'', ''\u1e25a\u1e6d\u1e6da'ah'', or ''\u1e25a\u1e6d\u1e6dat''  (lit. \"fault,\" \"shortcoming,\" \"misstep\"), an infraction of a commandment committed in ignorance of the existence or meaning of that command.\n* The second kind is the ''awon'', a breach of a minor commandment committed with a full knowledge of the existence and nature of that commandment (''bemezid''). \n* The gravest kind is the ''pesha'' or ''mered'', a presumptuous and rebellious act against God. Its worst form is the ''resha'', such an act committed with a wicked intention.\nThese three terms are mentioned by the Psalmist (cvi. 6): \"We have sinned [''\u1e25a\u1e6da'nu''], . . . we have committed iniquity [''he-'ewinu''], we have done wickedly [''hirsha'nu]''\" (comp.

The Prophets disparaged sacrifices that were offered without a regeneration of the heart, i.e., a determined turning from sin and returning to God by striving after righteousness ([[Book of Hosea]] 14:1-2, Joel 2:13, Micah 6:6-8). At the same time, prophets stressed the importance of offerings combined with justice and good even as they taught that offerings were unacceptable unless combined with heartfelt repentance and good deeds. [[Malachi]], the last prophet in the Hebrew Bible, emphasized that the goal of repentance is not to end sacrifices, but to make the offerings fit for acceptance once again ([[Book of Malachi]], 3:3-4). Similarly, the [[Book of Isaiah]] despite disparagement of sacrifices without justice, portrays sacrifice as having a role complementary with prayer in a universalistic [[eschatology]] (Isaiah 56:1; 6-7).\n\n==Rabbinical interpretation==\n\n===100 among the 613 commandments===\nAccording to [[Maimonides]], about one hundred of the permanent [[613 commandments]] based on the Torah, by rabbinical enumeration, directly concern sacrifices, excluding those commandments that concern the actual Temple and the priests themselves of which there are about another fifty.<ref>\n# Not to burn anything on the Golden Altar besides incense (Exodus 30:9)\n# To offer only unblemished animals (Leviticus 22:21)\n# Not to dedicate a blemished animal for the altar (Leviticus 22:20)\n# Not to slaughter it (Leviticus 22:22)\n# Not to sprinkle its blood (Leviticus 22:24)\n# Not to burn its ''[[Chelev|khelev]]'' (Leviticus 22:22)\n# Not to offer a temporarily blemished animal (Deuteronomy 17:1)\n# Not to sacrifice blemished animals even if offered by non-Jews (Leviticus 22:25)\n# Not to inflict wounds upon dedicated animals (Leviticus 22:21)\n# To redeem dedicated animals which have become disqualified (Deuteronomy 12:15)\n# To offer only animals which are at least eight days old (Leviticus 22:27)\n# Not to offer animals bought with the wages of a harlot or the animal exchanged for a dog (Deuteronomy 23:19)\n# Not to burn honey or yeast on the altar (Leviticus 2:11)\n# To salt all sacrifices (Leviticus 2:13)\n# Not to omit the salt from sacrifices (Leviticus 2:13)\n# Carry out the procedure of the burnt offering as prescribed in the Torah (Leviticus 1:3)\n# Not to eat its meat (Deuteronomy 12:17)\n# Carry out the procedure of the sin offering (Leviticus 6:18)\n# Not to eat the meat of the inner sin offering (Leviticus 6:23)\n# Not to decapitate a fowl brought as a sin offering (Leviticus 5:8)\n# Carry out the procedure of the guilt offering (Leviticus 7:1)\n# The ''kohanim'' must eat the sacrificial meat in the Temple (Exodus 29:33)\n# The ''kohanim'' must not eat the meat outside the Temple courtyard (Deuteronomy 12:17)\n# A non-''kohen'' must not eat sacrificial meat (Exodus 29:33)\n# To follow the procedure of the peace offering (Leviticus 7:11)\n# Not to eat the meat of minor sacrifices before sprinkling the blood (Deuteronomy 12:17)\n# To bring meal offerings as prescribed in the Torah (Leviticus 2:1)\n# Not to put oil on the meal offerings of wrongdoers (Leviticus 5:11)\n# Not to put frankincense on the meal offerings of wrongdoers (Leviticus 3:11)\n# Not to eat the meal offering of the High Priest (Leviticus 6:16)\n# Not to bake a meal offering as leavened bread (Leviticus 6:10)\n# The ''kohanim'' must eat the remains of the meal offerings (Leviticus 6:9)\n# To bring all avowed and freewill offerings to the Temple on the first subsequent festival (Deuteronomy 12:5-6)\n# To offer all sacrifices in the Temple (Deuteronomy 12:11)\n# To bring all sacrifices from outside Israel to the Temple (Deuteronomy 12:26)\n# Not to slaughter sacrifices outside the courtyard (of the Temple) (Leviticus 17:4)\n# Not to offer any sacrifices outside the courtyard (of the Temple) (Deuteronomy 12:13)\n# To offer two lambs every day (Numbers 28:3)\n# To light a fire on the altar every day (Leviticus 6:6)\n# Not to extinguish this fire (Leviticus 6:6)\n# To remove the ashes from the altar every day (Leviticus 6:3)\n# To burn incense every day (Exodus 30:7)\n# The ''Kohen Gadol'' must bring a meal offering every day (Leviticus 6:13)\n# To bring two additional lambs as burnt offerings on Shabbat (Numbers 28:9)\n# To bring additional offerings on the New Month (''[[Rosh Khodesh]]'') (Numbers 28:11)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Passover]] (Numbers 28:19)\n# To offer the wave offering from the meal of the new wheat (Leviticus 23:10)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Shavuot]] (Numbers 28:26)\n# To bring two leaves to accompany the above sacrifice (Leviticus 23:17)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Rosh Hashana]] (Numbers 29:2)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Yom Kippur]] (Numbers 29:8)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Sukkot]] (Numbers 29:13)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Shmini Atzeret]] (Numbers 29:35)\n# Not to eat sacrifices which have become unfit or blemished (Deuteronomy 14:3)\n# Not to eat from sacrifices offered with improper intentions (Leviticus 7:18)\n# Not to leave sacrifices past the time allowed for eating them (Leviticus 22:30)\n# Not to eat from that which was left over (Leviticus 19:8)\n# Not to eat from sacrifices which became impure (Leviticus 7:19)\n# An impure person must not eat from sacrifices (Leviticus 7:20)\n# To burn the leftover sacrifices (Leviticus 7:17)\n# To burn all impure sacrifices (Leviticus 7:19)\n# To follow the [sacrificial] procedure of Yom Kippur in the sequence prescribed in ''Parshah [[Acharei]] Mot'' (After the death of [[Aaron]]'s sons...)

In addition, large parts of every other book of the Talmud discuss various kinds of sacrifices. ''Pesachim'' is largely devoted to a discussion of how to offer the [[Passover sacrifice]]. ''Yoma'' contains a detailed discussion of the offerings and Temple ritual on Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement), and there are sections in ''seder Moed'' (Festivals) for the special offerings and Temple ritual for other major Jewish holidays. ''Sheqalim'' discusses the annual half-shekel offering for Temple maintenance and Temple governance and management, ''Nashim'' discusses the offerings made by [[Nazirite]]s and the suspected adultress, etc.\n\nThe Talmud provides extensive details not only on how to perform sacrifices but how to adjudicate difficult cases, such what to do if a mistake was made and whether improperly performing one of the required ritual elements invalidates it or not. The Talmud explains how to roast the Passover offering, how to dash blood from different kinds of sacrifices upon the altar, how to prepare the incense, the regulatory code for the system of taxation that financed the priesthood and public sacrifices, and numerous other details.\n\n===Rationale and rabbinic commentary===\n[[Maimonides]], a medieval Jewish scholar, drew on the early critiques of the need for sacrifice, taking the view that God always held sacrifice inferior to prayer and philosophical meditation. However, God understood that the Israelites were used to the animal sacrifices that the surrounding pagan tribes used as the primary way to commune with their gods. As such, in Maimonides' view, it was only natural that Israelites would believe that sacrifice would be a necessary part of the relationship between God and man. Maimonides concludes that God's decision to allow sacrifices was a concession to human psychological limitations. It would have been too much to have expected the Israelites to leap from pagan worship to prayer and meditation in one step. In ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', he writes:\n{{quote|But the custom which was in those days general among men, and the general mode of worship in which the Israelites were brought up consisted in sacrificing animals... It was in accordance with the wisdom and plan of God...that God did not command us to give up and to discontinue all these manners of service. For to obey such a commandment would have been contrary to the nature of man, who generally cleaves to that to which he is used; it would in those days have made the same impression as a prophet would make at present [the 12th Century] if he called us to the service of God and told us in His name, that we should not pray to God nor fast, nor seek His help in time of trouble; that we should serve Him in thought, and not by any action.<ref>Book III, Chapter 32. Translated by M. Friedlander, 1904, ''The Guide for the Perplexed'', Dover Publications, 1956 edition</ref>}}\n\nIn contrast, many others such as [[Nahmanides]] (in his commentary on Leviticus 1:9) disagreed. Nahmanides cites the fact that the Torah records the practices of animal and other sacrifices from the times of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]] and earlier. Indeed, the purpose of recounting the [[Binding of Isaac|near sacrifice of Isaac]] was to illustrate the sublime significance and need of animal sacrifices as supplanting the abomination of human sacrifices.\n\n===In spiritual practice===\nThe korban also has a spiritual meaning, and refers to some part of an individual's ego, which is given up as a sacrifice to God in honor of the mortality of the worshipper. In keeping with the root of the word, meaning to draw close, and to the common usage as the sacrifice of an animal, so too can the worshipper sacrifice something of this world in order to become closer to God.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =  Dubov\n  | first =  Nissan Dovid \n  | title = Jewish Meditation\n  | publisher =Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center\n  | url = http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=361886\n  | accessdate =  2006-08-17}}</ref>\n\n==The end of sacrifices==\nWith the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem by the Romans, the Jewish practice of offering korbanot stopped for all intents and purposes. Despite subsequent intermittent periods of small Jewish groups offering the traditional sacrifices on the Temple Mount, the practice effectively ended.\n\n[[Rabbinic Judaism]] was forced to undergo a significant development in response to this change; no longer could Judaism revolve around the Temple services. The destruction of the Temple led to a development of Judaism in the direction of text study, prayer, and personal observance. [[Orthodox Judaism]] regards this as being largely an alternative way of fulfilling the obligations of the Temple. Other branches of Judaism ([[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]]) regard the korbanot as an ancient ritual that will not return. A range of responses is recorded in classical rabbinic literature, describing this subject.\n\n:Once, Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai was walking with his disciple, Rabbi Y'hoshua, near Jerusalem after the destruction of the Temple. Rabbi Y'hoshua looked at the Temple ruins and said \"Alas for us!! The place that atoned for the sins of the people Israel lies in ruins!\" Then Rabbi Yohannan ben Zakkai spoke to him these words of comfort:  'Be not grieved, my son. There is another equally meritorious way of gaining ritual atonement, even though the Temple is destroyed. We can still gain ritual atonement through deeds of loving-kindness. For it is written \"Loving kindness I desire, not sacrifice.\" (Hosea 6:6)\n:[[Midrash]] Avot D'Rabbi Nathan 4:5\n\nIn the [[Babylonian Talmud]], a number of sages opined that following Jewish law, doing charitable deeds, and studying Jewish texts is greater than performing animal sacrifices.\n\n:Rabbi Elazar said: Doing righteous deeds of charity is greater than offering all of the sacrifices, as it is written: \"Doing charity and justice is more desirable to the Lord than sacrifice\" (Proverbs 21:3).\n:Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah 49\n\nNonetheless, numerous texts of the Talmud stress the importance of and hope for eventual re-introduction of sacrifices, and regard their loss as a terrible tragedy. Partaking of sacrificial offerings was compared to eating directly at one's Father's table, whose loss synagogue worship does not quite entirely replace. One example is in ''Berachot'':\n:And I said to him: I heard a heavenly voice that was cooing like a dove and saying, \"Woe to the children because of whose sins I destroyed My house, and burned My temple, and exiled them among the nations of the world. And he [Elijah the prophet] said to me: \"By your life and the life of your head! It is not only at this moment that [the heavenly voice] says this. But on each and every day it says this three times. And not only this, but at the time that the people of Israel enter the synagogues and houses of study, and respond (in the [[Kaddish]]) \"May His great name be blessed\", the Holy One, Blessed is He, shakes His head and says: \"Fortunate for the king who is praised this way in his house. What is there for the Father who has exiled His children. And woe to the children who have been exiled from their Father's table.\"  (Talmud ''Berachot'' 3a).\n\nAnother example is in ''Sheqalim'':\n:Rabbi Akiva said: Shimon Ben Loga related the following to me: I was once collecting grasses, and I saw a child from the [[House of Avitnas]] (the incense-makers). And I saw that he cried, and I saw that he laughed. I said to him, \"My son, why did you cry?\" He said, Because of the glory of my Father's house that has decreased.\" I asked \"And why did you laugh?\" He said to me \"Because of the glory prepared for the righteous in the future.\" I asked \"And what did you see?\" [that brought on these emotions]. \"The herb ''[[Maaleh Ashan|maaleh ashan]]'' is growing next to me. [''Maaleh Ashan'' is the secret ingredient in the incense that made the smoke rise, which according to the Talmud the [[House of Avitnas]] never revealed.]\"\n\n===Liturgical attention to end of sacrifices===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nNumerous details of the daily religious practice of an ordinary Jew are connected to keeping memory of the rhythm of the life of the Temple and its sacrifices. For example, the Mishna begins with a statement that the [[Shema Yisrael]] prayer is to be recited in the evening at the time when Kohanim who were ''[[Tumah and taharah|tamei]]'' (ritually impure) are permitted to enter to eat their [[heave offering]] (a food-tithe given to priests) following purification. A detailed discussion of the obligations of tithing, ritual purity, and other elements central to the Temple and priesthood is required in order to determine the meaning of this contemporary daily Jewish obligation.\n\n===Other occasions===\nJewish services for [[Shabbat]], Jewish holidays and other occasions include special prayers for the restoration of sacrifices. For example, the traditional Yom Kippur liturgy contains repeated prayers for the restoration of sacrifices and every [[High Holiday]] [[Amidah]] contains [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 56:7:\n:Even them will I bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer; their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be acceptable upon Mine altar; for My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.<ref name=\"mechon-mamre.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1056.htm|title=Isaiah 56 / Hebrew - English Bible / Mechon-Mamre|website=www.mechon-mamre.org}}</ref>\n\n==Modern view and resumption of sacrifices==\n\n===Future of sacrifices in Judaism===\n{{see also| Temple in Jerusalem}}\nThe prevailing belief among rabbinic Jews is that in the [[Messianic Age|messianic era]], the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]] will come and a [[Third Temple]] will be built. It is believed that the korbanot will be reinstituted, but to what extent and for how long is unknown. Some biblical and classical rabbinic sources hold that most or all sacrifices will not need to be offered.\n\n* In the future all sacrifices, with the exception of the Thanksgiving-sacrifice, will be discontinued. (Midrash Vayikra Rabbah 9:7)\n* All sacrifices will be annulled in the future. (Tanchuma Emor 14, Vayikra Rabbah 9:7)\n* Then the grain-offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to God as in the days of old, and as in ancient years. (Malachi 3:4)\n* It is impossible to go suddenly from one extreme to the other;...the custom which was in those days general among all men, and the general mode of worship in which the Israelites were brought up consisted of sacrificing animals in the temples... For this reason God allowed this kind of service to continue.  The sacrificial system is not the primary object, rather supplications, and prayer. (Maimonides, The Guide to the Perplexed III 32)\n\nThe majority view of classical rabbis is that the Torah's commandments will still be applicable and in force during the messianic era. However, a significant minority of rabbis held that most of the commandments will be nullified in the messianic era, thus holding that sacrifices will not be reinstated. Examples of such rabbinic views include:\n* Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Niddah 61b and Tractate Shabbat 151b.\n* Midrash Shochar Tov (Mizmor 146:5) states that God will permit what is now forbidden.\n\n[[Orthodox Judaism]] holds that in the messianic era, most or all of the korbanot will be reinstituted, at least for a time. [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]], hold that no animal sacrifices will be offered in a rebuilt Temple at all, following the position of Tanchuma Emor 14 and Vayikra Rabbah 9:7.\n\n===Nineteenth and twentieth century===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nIn the 1800s a number of Orthodox rabbis studied the idea of reinstating korbanot on the Temple Mount, even though the messianic era had not yet arrived and the Temple was not rebuilt. A number of [[responsa]] concluded that within certain parameters, it is permissible according to Jewish law to offer such sacrifices.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, [[Israel Meir Kagan]] advised some followers to set up special ''[[yeshiva]]s'' for married students known as ''Qodshim [[Kolel]]im'' that would specialize in the study of the korbanot and study with greater intensity the ''qodshim'' sections of the [[Talmud]] in order to prepare for the arrival of the Jewish Messiah who would oversee the rebuilding of the original Temple of Solomon in [[Jerusalem]] that would be known as the [[Third Temple]]. His advice was taken seriously and today there are a number of well-established [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] institutions in [[Israel]] that focus solely on the subject of the korbanot, ''qodshim'', and the needs of the future Jewish Temple, such as the [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty]].\n\n===Efforts to restore korbanot===\n{{Main|The Third Temple}}\nA few groups, notably the [[Temple Institute]] and the [[Temple Mount Faithful]], have petitioned the Israeli government to rebuild a Third Temple on the [[Temple Mount]] and restore sacrificial worship. The Israeli government has not responded favorably. Most Orthodox Jews regard rebuilding a Temple as an activity for a Jewish Messiah as part of a future [[Jewish eschatology]], and most non-Orthodox Jews do not believe in the restoration of sacrificial worship at all. The Temple Institute has been constructing ritual objects in preparation for a resumption of sacrifices.\n\n==View among modern Jewish denominations==\n\n===Contemporary Orthodox Judaism===\nToday Orthodox Judaism includes mention of each korban on either a daily basis in the ''[[siddur]]'' (daily prayer book), or in the ''[[machzor]]'' (holiday prayerbook) as part of the prayers for the relevant days concerned. They are also referred to in the prayerbooks of Conservative Judaism, in an abbreviated fashion.\n\nOn each Jewish holiday the sections in the Torah mentioning that festival's korbanot is read out loud in [[synagogue]].\n\n====Daily services====\nIn the very early morning daily ''[[Shacharit]]'' prayers for example, they include the following in order of mention, actually called the korbanot. The following example is taken from the [[Nusach Ashkenaz]].\n* ''Kiyor'' Describing the basin containing pure water to wash up before touching the korbanot (offerings), based on Exodus 30: 17-21.<ref name=\"bible.ort.org\">http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=30</ref>\n* ''Trumat Hadeshen'' Removing the ashes of the ''korban olah'' (elevation offering), based on Leviticus 6:1-6.<ref>http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=3&CHAPTER=6</ref>\n* ''korban Tamid'' Perpetual daily offerings: \"...Fire-offering...male yearling [[sheep|lambs]] unblemished two a day...\" based on Numbers 28:1-8.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=4&CHAPTER=28</ref>\n* ''Ketoret'' [[Incense]] [from] [[spice]]s: \"...stacte, onycha, and galbanum, ...and [[frankincense]]...\" Based on Exodus 30:34-36;7-8...<ref name=\"bible.ort.org\"/>\"[[myrrh]], [[Cinnamomum cassia|cassia]], [[spikenard]], [[saffron]], costus, aromatic bark, [[cinnamon]], ley, [[salt]], [[amber]]...\" based on the Babylonian [[Talmud]] ''Kritut'' 6a; Jerusalem Talmud ''Yoma'' 4:5; 33a.\n* ''korban Musaf'' The additional offerings for [[Shabbat]]: \"On the Sabbath...two male lambs...fine [[flour]] for a meal offering mixed with oil and its [[wine]] libation...\" based on Numbers 28:9-10.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* ''korban Rosh Chodesh'' Offering for the new month: ...Two young [[bull]]s, one [[Sheep|ram]], seven lambs...fine flour ...mixed with [[olive oil]]...one he [[goat]]... and its wine libation.\" Based on Numbers 28: 11-15.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* ''Zevachim'' Chapter 5 of [[Mishnah]] ''Zevachim'' is then cited. (It was included in the ''siddur'' at this stage because it discusses all the sacrifices and the sages do not dispute within it):\n**A. ''Eizehu mekoman shel z'vachim'' Places for the ''zevachim korbanot'' to be offered: \"...The slaughter of the bull and the he-goat of Yom Kippur is in the north [of the altar]...\"\n**B. ''Parim hanisrafim'' [[Bull]]s that are completely burned: \"...These are burned in the place where the [altar] ashes are deposited.\"\n**C. ''Chatot hatzibur v'hayachid'' Sin offerings of the community and the individual: \"...The he-goats...are eaten within the [Temple courtyard] curtains by male priests...until midnight.\"\n**D. ''Ha'olah qodesh qodashim'' The elevation offering is among the offerings with a major-degree-of-holiness: \"...it is entirely consumed by fire.\"\n**E. ''Zivchei shalmei tzibur v'ashamot'' Communal peace offerings and guilt offerings: \"...are eaten within the [Temple courtyard] by males of the priesthood...until midnight.\"\n**F. ''Hatodah v'eil nazir qodashim kalim'' The thanksgiving offering and the ram of a Nazirite are offerings of a minor-degree holiness: \"They are eaten throughout the city [of Jerusalem] by anyone, prepared in any manner...until midnight...\"\n**G. ''Sh'lamim qodashim kalim'' The peace offerings are of lesser (lighter) holiness:  \"...Is eaten by the ''kohanim''...throughout the city [of Jerusalem] by anyone...\"\n**H. ''Hab'chor vehama'aser vehapesach qodashim kalim'' The firstborn and tithe of animals and the Passover offering are offerings of lesser (lighter) holiness: \"...The Passover offering is eaten only at night...only if roasted.\"\n* ''Rabbi Yishmael omer'' Rabbi Yishmael says: Through thirteen rules is the Torah elucidated. (Introduction to the ''Sifra'', part of the Oral Law).\n* ''Yehi Ratzon'' (Ending) The study session concludes with a prayer (\"May it be thy will...) for the restoration of the Temple in Jerusalem and the resumption of sacrifices. (...that the Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant our portion in your Torah and there we shall serve you with reverence as in days of old and in former years. And may the grain offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasing to God, as in days of old and in former years.\")\n\nThe [[Amidah]]\n* ''Retzai'' Every the Orthodox [[Amidah]], the central prayer of Jewish services, contains the paragraph: \"Be favorable, Oh Lord our God, to your people Israel and their prayer, and restore the service of the [[Holy of Holies]] of Your House, and accept the fire-offerings of Israel and their prayer with love and favor, and may the service of your people Israel always be favored.\" Conservative Judaism removes the fire-offerings clause from this prayer.\n* ''Yehi Ratzon'' Private recitiation of the Amidah traditionally ends with the ''Yehi Ratzon'' prayer for the restoration of the Temple.\n* The Amidah itself is said to represent liturgically the ''purpose'' of the daily korban, while the recitation of the korbanot sections fulfill the ''formal responsibility'' to perform them, in the absence of the Temple.\n\nThe weekday [[Torah reading]]\n* A set of blessings connected with the weekday Torah reading include a prayer for the [[Third Temple|restoration of the Temple]]: \"May it be the will before our Father who is in heaven to establish the House of our lives and to return his [[Shekhinah]]'' into our midst, speedily, in our days, and let us say Amen.\"\n\n===In Conservative Judaism===\nConservative Judaism disavows the resumption of qorbanot. Consistent with this view, it has deleted prayers for the resumption of sacrifices from the Conservative ''siddur'', including both the morning study section from the sacrifices, prayers for the restoration of qorbanot in the Amidah, and various mentions elsewhere. Consistent with its view that a priesthood and sacrificial system will not be restored, Conservative Judaism has also lifted certain restrictions on ''kohanim'', including limitations on marriage prohibiting marrying a divorced woman or a convert. Conservative Judaism does, however, believe in the restoration of a Temple in some form, and in the continuation of kohanim and [[Levites]] under relaxed requirements, and has retained references to both in its prayer books. Consistent with its stress on the continuity of tradition, many Conservative synagogues have also retained references to [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday|Festival]] qorbanot, changing all references to sacrifices into the past tense (e.g. the Orthodox \"and there we will sacrifice\" is changed to \"and there they sacrificed\"). Some more liberal Conservative synagogues, however, have removed all references to sacrifices, past or present, from the prayer service. The most recent official Conservative prayer book, [[Sim Shalom]], provides both service alternatives.\n\n===In Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism===\n[[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] disavow all belief in a restoration of a Temple, the resumption of qorbanot, or the continuation of identified Cohens or Levites. These branches of Judaism believe that all such practices represent ancient practices inconsistent with the requirements of modernity, and have removed all or virtually all references to qorbanot from their prayer books.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Corban}}\n* [[Abomination (Judaism)]]\n* [[Du\u0161ni Brav]]\n* [[Hakarat HaTov]]\n* [[Holy Qurbana]]\n* [[Incense offering]]\n* [[Kourbania]]\n* [[Priesthood (Ancient Israel)]]\n* [[Psalm 100]]\n* [[Qurbani]]\n* [[Red heifer]]\n* [[Wave offering]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[J.

Embroiled parties included the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], Portuguese rebels, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[July Monarchy|France]], the [[Catholic Church]], and [[Spain]].\n\n==Roots of the conflict==\n[[File:Liberal Wars.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A period cartoon, showing the conflict between the ''Two Brothers'', as children, and the major States of Europe, as grown parents, trying to avoid the quarrel.]]\n\nThe death of [[John VI of Portugal|King Jo\u00e3o VI]] in 1826 created a dispute over royal succession. While Dom [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]], the [[Emperor of Brazil]], was the king's oldest son, his younger brother [[Miguel of Portugal|Miguel]] contended that Pedro had forfeited his claim to the throne by declaring Brazilian independence. Pedro briefly entitled himself [[Dom (title)|Dom]] Pedro IV of Portugal. Neither the Portuguese nor the Brazilians wanted a unified monarchy; consequently, Pedro abdicated the throne in favor of his daughter, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria]], a child of 7. In April 1826, to settle the succession dispute, Pedro revised the first [[constitution of Portugal]] granted in 1822 and left the throne to Maria, with his sister [[Isabella Maria of Portugal|Isabel Maria]] as regent.\n\n==A new constitution==\nIn the Portuguese Constitutional Charter, Pedro attempted to reconcile absolutists and liberals by allowing both factions a role in the government. Unlike the Constitution of 1822, this new document established four branches of government. The [[Legislature]] was divided into two chambers. The upper chamber, the [[Chamber of Peers (Portugal)|Chamber of Peers]], was composed of life and hereditary peers and clergy appointed by the king. The lower chamber, the [[Chamber of Deputies]], was composed of 111 deputies elected to four-year terms by the indirect vote of local assemblies, which in turn were elected by a [[limited suffrage]] of male tax-paying property owners. Judicial power was exercised by the courts; executive power by the ministers of the government; and moderative power by the king, who held an absolute veto over all legislation.\n\n==Discontent==\n[[File:Batalha da Praia da Vit\u00f3ria.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Battle of Praia Bay]], 11 August 1829]]\nThe absolutist party of the landowners and the [[Roman Catholicism in Portugal|Church]], however, were not satisfied with this compromise, and they continued to regard Miguel as the legitimate successor to the throne on the grounds that according to the Portuguese succession rules (approved by the [[Portuguese Cortes|Cortes]] after the [[Portuguese Restoration War|1640 Restoration]]), Pedro had lost the right to the Portuguese crown, and therefore to choose a successor, when he took possession of a foreign crown ([[Brazil]]). They were alarmed by the liberal reforms that had been initiated in Spain by the detested Revolutionary French (reforms which the Portuguese feudal aristocracy had been spared) and took heart at the recent restoration of the autocratic [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] in Spain (1823) who was eradicating all the Napoleonic innovations. In February 1828, Miguel returned to Portugal, ostensibly to take the oath of allegiance to the Charter and assume the regency. He was immediately proclaimed king by his supporters, who pressed him to return to absolutism. A month after his return, Miguel dissolved the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Peers and, in May, summoned the traditional Cortes of the three estates of the realm to proclaim his accession to absolute power. The Cortes of 1828 assented to Miguel's wish, proclaiming him king as [[Miguel I of Portugal]] and nullifying the Constitutional Charter.\n\n==Rebellion==\n[[File:Landing of liberal forces in Oporto.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Landing of the liberal forces in Pampelido, north of [[Porto]], 8 July 1832]]\n[[File:BatalhaCaboS.Vicente.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1833)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]], 5 July 1833]]\nThis alleged usurpation did not go unchallenged by the Liberals. On May 18, the garrison in [[Porto]], the center of Portuguese progressives, declared its loyalty to Pedro ([[Dom Pedro IV]]) and his daughter Maria da Gl\u00f3ria (future [[Maria II of Portugal]]), and the Constitutional Charter. The rebellion against the absolutists spread to other cities. Miguel suppressed these rebellions, and many thousands of Liberals were either arrested or fled to Spain and Britain. There followed five years of repression.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Brazil]], relations between [[Dom Pedro IV|Pedro]] and Brazil's agricultural magnates had become strained. In April 1831, Pedro abdicated in Brazil in favor of his son, [[Peter II of Brazil|Pedro II]], and sailed for [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. He organized a military expedition there and then went to [[Terceira island]] in the [[Azores]], which was in the hands of the Liberals, to set up a government in exile. The government of Miguel blockaded the island, but the blockading squadron was attacked by a French squadron during the run-up to the [[Battle of the Tagus]], where several Miguelist ships were captured. In July 1832, with the backing of Liberals in Spain and [[England]], an expedition led by Dom Pedro landed near Porto, which the Miguelites abandoned and where, after military activities including the [[Battle of Ponte Ferreira]], Pedro and his associates were besieged by Miguelite forces for nearly a year. To protect British interests, a naval squadron under Commander [[William Nugent Glascock]] in [[HMS Orestes|HMS ''Orestes'']] was stationed in the [[Douro]], where it came under fire from both sides.\n\nIn June 1833, the Liberals, still encircled at Porto, sent to the [[Algarve]] a force commanded by the [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Severim de Noronha, 1st Duke of Terceira|Duke of Terceira]] supported by a naval squadron commanded by [[Charles Napier (naval officer)|Charles Napier]], using the alias 'Carlos de Ponza'. The Duke of Terceira landed at [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]] and marched north through the [[Alentejo]] to capture Lisbon on July 24. Meanwhile, Napier's squadron encountered the absolutists' fleet near [[Cape Saint Vincent]] (''Cabo S\u00e3o Vicente'') and decisively defeated it at the fourth [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1833)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]]. The Liberals were able to occupy Lisbon, where Pedro moved from Porto and repulsed a Miguelite siege. A stalemate of nine months ensued. Towards the end of 1833, Maria da Gl\u00f3ria was proclaimed queen, and Dom Pedro was made regent. His first act was to confiscate the property of all who had served under Dom Miguel. He also suppressed all religious houses and confiscated their property, an act that suspended friendly relations with Rome for nearly eight years, until mid-1841. The absolutists controlled the rural areas, where they were supported by the aristocracy, and by a peasantry that was galvanized by the Church. The Liberals occupied Portugal's major cities, Lisbon and Porto, where they commanded a sizable following among the middle classes. Operations against the [[Miguelites]] began again in earnest in early 1834. Meanwhile, the Liberal army had suffered a sound defeat at [[Alc\u00e1cer do Sal]], which proved that, despite the Duke of Terceira's recent march from Faro to Lisbon, the south was still loyal to the Miguelites.\n\n==Peace==\nThe [[Battle of Asseiceira]], fought on May 16, 1834, was the last and decisive engagement of the Portuguese Civil War.  The Migueliste army was still formidable (about 18,000 men), but on May 24, 1834, at [[Evoramonte]], a peace was declared under a concession by which [[Miguel I of Portugal|Dom Miguel]] formally renounced all claims to the throne of [[Portugal]], was guaranteed an annual pension, and was definitively exiled. [[Pedro IV of Portugal|Dom Pedro]] restored the Constitutional Charter, but he died September 24, 1834.\n\nMaria da Gl\u00f3ria resumed her interrupted reign as [[Maria II of Portugal]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dissolution of the monasteries in Portugal]]\n*[[Joaquim Ant\u00f3nio de Aguiar]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|Portuguese Civil War}}\n\n*{{loc}}\n\n{{Portugal topics}}\n{{Portuguese Monarchy Topics}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Wars involving France]]\n[[Category:Wars involving Portugal]]\n[[Category:Wars involving Spain]]\n[[Category:Wars involving the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Wars of succession]]\n[[Category:19th century in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Civil wars involving the states and peoples of Europe]]\n[[Category:Liberalism in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Liberal Wars| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Portuguese Civil War}}\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2014}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict = Liberal Wars\n| partof   = \n| campaign = \n| image    = Battle of Ferreira Bridge.jpg\n| image_size = 300px\n| caption  = [[Battle of Ponte Ferreira|Battle of Ferreira Bridge]], 23 July 1832\n| date     = 1828\u20131834\n| place    = Portugal\n| result   = Liberal victory, [[Concession of Evoramonte]]:\n*Constitutional monarchy is restored.\n*Dom Miguel renounces all his claims to the throne and goes into exile.\n| combatant1  = [[File:Flag Portugal (1830).svg|25px|border]] Liberals<br />\n'''Supported by:'''\n*{{flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]\n*{{flagicon|France}} [[July Monarchy|France]] (from 1830)\n*{{flagicon|Belgium}} [[Belgium|Belgian volunteers]] (from 1832)<ref>{{cite web|title=Belgian Corps 1832-35 in Portugal's Liberal Wars|url=http://balagan.info/belgian-corps-1832-35-in-portugals-liberal-wars|accessdate=17 February 2013}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|Spain|1785}} [[Spain]] (from 1833)\n| combatant2  = [[File:Flag Portugal (1707).svg|25px|border]] [[Miguelites]]\n'''Supported by:'''\n*{{flagicon|Spain|1785}} [[Spain]] (until 1833)\n| commander1  = [[File:Flag Portugal (1830).svg|25px|border]] [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro]]<br />[[File:Flag Portugal (1830).svg|25px|border]] [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Severim de Noronha, 1st Duke of Terceira|Duke of Terceira]]<br />[[File:Flag Portugal (1830).svg|25px|border]] [[Jo\u00e3o Carlos Saldanha de Oliveira Daun, 1st Duke of Saldanha|Marshal Saldanha]]<br />[[File:Flag Portugal (1830).svg|25px|border]] [[Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Napier]] \n| commander2  = [[File:Flag Portugal (1707).svg|25px|border]] [[Miguel of Portugal|Dom Miguel]]<br />[[File:Flag Portugal (1707).svg|25px|border]] [[Lu\u00eds Vaz Pereira Pinto Guedes|Viscount of Montalegre]]<br />[[File:Flag Portugal (1707).svg|25px|border]] [[Manuel Greg\u00f3rio de Sousa Pereira de Sampaio|Viscount of Santa Marta]]<br />[[File:Flag Portugal (1707).svg|25px|border]] [[\u00c1lvaro Xavier da Fonseca Coutinho e P\u00f3voas|General P\u00f3voas]]\n| strength1   = \n| strength2   = \n| casualties1 = \n| casualties2 = \n| campaignbox = {{Campaignbox Liberal Wars}}\n}}\nThe '''Liberal Wars''', also known as the '''Portuguese Civil War''', the '''War of the Two Brothers''' or '''Miguelite War''', was a war between [[liberalism|liberal]] constitutionalists and [[conservative]] absolutists in [[Portugal]] over royal succession that lasted from 1828 to 1834.

Judicial power was exercised by the courts; executive power by the ministers of the government; and moderative power by the king, who held an absolute veto over all legislation.\n\n==Discontent==\n[[File:Batalha da Praia da Vit\u00f3ria.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Battle of Praia Bay]], 11 August 1829]]\nThe absolutist party of the landowners and the [[Roman Catholicism in Portugal|Church]], however, were not satisfied with this compromise, and they continued to regard Miguel as the legitimate successor to the throne on the grounds that according to the Portuguese succession rules (approved by the [[Portuguese Cortes|Cortes]] after the [[Portuguese Restoration War|1640 Restoration]]), Pedro had lost the right to the Portuguese crown, and therefore to choose a successor, when he took possession of a foreign crown ([[Brazil]]). They were alarmed by the liberal reforms that had been initiated in Spain by the detested Revolutionary French (reforms which the Portuguese feudal aristocracy had been spared) and took heart at the recent restoration of the autocratic [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] in Spain (1823) who was eradicating all the Napoleonic innovations. In February 1828, Miguel returned to Portugal, ostensibly to take the oath of allegiance to the Charter and assume the regency. He was immediately proclaimed king by his supporters, who pressed him to return to absolutism. A month after his return, Miguel dissolved the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Peers and, in May, summoned the traditional Cortes of the three estates of the realm to proclaim his accession to absolute power. The Cortes of 1828 assented to Miguel's wish, proclaiming him king as [[Miguel I of Portugal]] and nullifying the Constitutional Charter.\n\n==Rebellion==\n[[File:Landing of liberal forces in Oporto.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Landing of the liberal forces in Pampelido, north of [[Porto]], 8 July 1832]]\n[[File:BatalhaCaboS.Vicente.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1833)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]], 5 July 1833]]\nThis alleged usurpation did not go unchallenged by the Liberals. On May 18, the garrison in [[Porto]], the center of Portuguese progressives, declared its loyalty to Pedro ([[Dom Pedro IV]]) and his daughter Maria da Gl\u00f3ria (future [[Maria II of Portugal]]), and the Constitutional Charter. The rebellion against the absolutists spread to other cities. Miguel suppressed these rebellions, and many thousands of Liberals were either arrested or fled to Spain and Britain. There followed five years of repression.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Brazil]], relations between [[Dom Pedro IV|Pedro]] and Brazil's agricultural magnates had become strained. In April 1831, Pedro abdicated in Brazil in favor of his son, [[Peter II of Brazil|Pedro II]], and sailed for [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. He organized a military expedition there and then went to [[Terceira island]] in the [[Azores]], which was in the hands of the Liberals, to set up a government in exile. The government of Miguel blockaded the island, but the blockading squadron was attacked by a French squadron during the run-up to the [[Battle of the Tagus]], where several Miguelist ships were captured. In July 1832, with the backing of Liberals in Spain and [[England]], an expedition led by Dom Pedro landed near Porto, which the Miguelites abandoned and where, after military activities including the [[Battle of Ponte Ferreira]], Pedro and his associates were besieged by Miguelite forces for nearly a year. To protect British interests, a naval squadron under Commander [[William Nugent Glascock]] in [[HMS Orestes|HMS ''Orestes'']] was stationed in the [[Douro]], where it came under fire from both sides.\n\nIn June 1833, the Liberals, still encircled at Porto, sent to the [[Algarve]] a force commanded by the [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Severim de Noronha, 1st Duke of Terceira|Duke of Terceira]] supported by a naval squadron commanded by [[Charles Napier (naval officer)|Charles Napier]], using the alias 'Carlos de Ponza'. The Duke of Terceira landed at [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]] and marched north through the [[Alentejo]] to capture Lisbon on July 24. Meanwhile, Napier's squadron encountered the absolutists' fleet near [[Cape Saint Vincent]] (''Cabo S\u00e3o Vicente'') and decisively defeated it at the fourth [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1833)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]]. The Liberals were able to occupy Lisbon, where Pedro moved from Porto and repulsed a Miguelite siege. A stalemate of nine months ensued. Towards the end of 1833, Maria da Gl\u00f3ria was proclaimed queen, and Dom Pedro was made regent. His first act was to confiscate the property of all who had served under Dom Miguel. He also suppressed all religious houses and confiscated their property, an act that suspended friendly relations with Rome for nearly eight years, until mid-1841. The absolutists controlled the rural areas, where they were supported by the aristocracy, and by a peasantry that was galvanized by the Church. The Liberals occupied Portugal's major cities, Lisbon and Porto, where they commanded a sizable following among the middle classes. Operations against the [[Miguelites]] began again in earnest in early 1834. Meanwhile, the Liberal army had suffered a sound defeat at [[Alc\u00e1cer do Sal]], which proved that, despite the Duke of Terceira's recent march from Faro to Lisbon, the south was still loyal to the Miguelites.\n\n==Peace==\nThe [[Battle of Asseiceira]], fought on May 16, 1834, was the last and decisive engagement of the Portuguese Civil War.  The Migueliste army was still formidable (about 18,000 men), but on May 24, 1834, at [[Evoramonte]], a peace was declared under a concession by which [[Miguel I of Portugal|Dom Miguel]] formally renounced all claims to the throne of [[Portugal]], was guaranteed an annual pension, and was definitively exiled. [[Pedro IV of Portugal|Dom Pedro]] restored the Constitutional Charter, but he died September 24, 1834.\n\nMaria da Gl\u00f3ria resumed her interrupted reign as [[Maria II of Portugal]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dissolution of the monasteries in Portugal]]\n*[[Joaquim Ant\u00f3nio de Aguiar]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|Portuguese Civil War}}\n\n*{{loc}}\n\n{{Portugal topics}}\n{{Portuguese Monarchy Topics}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Wars involving France]]\n[[Category:Wars involving Portugal]]\n[[Category:Wars involving Spain]]\n[[Category:Wars involving the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Wars of succession]]\n[[Category:19th century in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Civil wars involving the states and peoples of Europe]]\n[[Category:Liberalism in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Liberal Wars| ]]\n", "name_user": "Snagemit", "label": "safe", "comment": "Hyperlinks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Wars"}

The first ship of the [[United States Navy]] named after the state of [[Utah]], she had one [[sister ship]], {{USS|Florida|BB-30|2}}. ''Utah'' was built by the [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation]], laid down in March 1909 and launched in December of that year. She was completed in August 1911, and boasted a main battery of ten {{convert|12|in|adj=on|0}} guns in five twin [[gun turret]]s.\n\n''Utah'' and ''Florida'' were the first ships to arrive during the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]] in 1914 during the [[Mexican Revolution]]. The two battleships sent ashore a landing party that began the occupation of the city. After the American entrance into [[World War I]], ''Utah'' was stationed at [[Castletownbere|Berehaven]] in [[Bantry Bay]], Ireland, where she protected convoys from potential German surface raiders. Throughout the 1920s, the ship conducted numerous training cruises and fleet maneuvers, and carried dignitaries on tours of South America twice, in 1924 and 1928.\n\nIn 1931, ''Utah'' was demilitarized and converted into a [[target ship]] and re-designated as '''AG-16''', in accordance with the terms of the [[London Naval Treaty]] signed the previous year. She was also equipped with numerous [[anti-aircraft]] guns of different types to train gunners for the fleet. She served in these two roles for the rest of the decade, and late 1941 found the ship in [[Pearl Harbor]]. She was in port on the morning of 7 December, and in the first minutes of the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], was hit by two torpedoes, which caused serious flooding. ''Utah'' quickly rolled over and sank; the vast majority of her crew were able to escape, but 58 men were killed in the attack. The wreck remains in the harbor, and in 1972, a memorial was erected near the ship.\n\n==Design==\n{{main article|Florida-class battleship}}\n''Utah'' was {{cvt|521|ft|6|in|lk=on}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{cvt|88|ft|3|in}} and a [[draft (nautical)|draft]] of {{cvt|28|ft|6|in}}. She [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|21825|LT|t|lk=on}} as designed and up to {{cvt|23033|LT|t}} at [[full load]]. The ship was powered by four-shaft [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbines]] rated at {{cvt|28000|shp|lk=on|0}} and twelve coal-fired [[Babcock & Wilcox]] [[boiler]]s, generating a top speed of {{cvt|20.75|kn|lk=on}}. The ship had a cruising range of {{cvt|5776|nmi|mi km|-1|lk=on}} at a speed of {{cvt|10|kn}}. She had a crew of 1,001 officers and men.{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=114}}\n\nThe ship was armed with a main battery of ten [[12\"/45 caliber Mark 5 gun|12-inch/45]]{{efn|/45 refers to the length of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibers]]. A /45 gun is 45 times long as it is in bore diameter.}} Mark 5 guns in five twin [[gun turret]]s on the centerline, two of which were placed in a [[superfire|superfiring pair]] forward. The other three turrets were placed aft of the [[superstructure]]. The secondary battery consisted of sixteen [[5\"/51 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|adj=on|0}}/51]] guns mounted in [[casemate]]s along the side of the hull. As was standard for [[capital ship]]s of the period, she carried a pair of {{convert|21|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s, submerged in her hull on the broadside. The main [[armored belt]] was {{cvt|11|in|0}} thick, while the armored deck was {{cvt|1.5|in|0}} thick. The gun turrets had {{cvt|12|in|0}} thick faces and the [[conning tower]] had {{cvt|11.5|in|0}} thick sides.{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=114}}\n\n==Service history==\n===Construction \u2013 1922===\n[[File:Uss utah bb.jpg|thumb|left|''Utah'' in her original guise, circa 1911]]\n\n''Utah'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] at the [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation]] on March 15, 1909. She was [[ship launching|launched]] on 23 December 1909 and was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the [[United States Navy]] on August 31, 1911.{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=114}} She then conducted a [[shakedown cruise]] that stopped in [[Hampton Roads]], [[Santa Rosa Island, Florida|Santa Rosa Island]], [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Kingston, Jamaica]], and [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]], Cuba. She was then assigned to the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]] in March 1912, after which time she participated in gunnery drills. She underwent an overhaul at the [[New York Navy Yard]] starting on 16 April. ''Utah'' left New York on June 1 and proceeded to [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]] by way of Hampton Roads, arriving on June 6. From there, she took a crew of naval cadets from the [[USNA|Naval Academy]] on a midshipman training cruise off the coast of [[New England]], which lasted until 25 August.{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}}\n\nFor the next two years, ''Utah'' followed a similar routine of training exercises and midshipman cruises in the Atlantic. During the period 8&ndash November 30, 1913, ''Utah'' made a goodwill cruise to European waters, which included a stop in [[Villefranche-sur-Mer|Villefranche]], France. In early 1914 during the [[Mexican Revolution]], the United States decided to intervene in the fighting. While en route to Mexico on April 16, ''Utah'' was ordered to intercept the German-flagged steamer {{SS|Ypiranga||6}}, which was carrying arms to the Mexican dictator [[Victoriano Huerta]]. ''Ypiranga''{{'}}s arrival in [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] prompted the US to [[United States occupation of Veracruz|occupy the city]];{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}} ''Utah'' and her [[sister ship]] ''Florida'' were the first American vessels on the scene. The two ships landed a combined contingent of a thousand [[USMC|Marines]] and [[:wikt:bluejacket|Bluejackets]] to begin the occupation of the city on 21 April. Over the next three days, the Marines battled rebels in the city and suffered 94 casualties, while killing hundreds of Mexicans in return.{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=114}}\n\n[[File:USS Utah, during WWI.jpg|thumb|''Utah'' during World War I wearing [[dazzle camouflage]]]]\n''Utah'' remained off Veracruz for two months, before she returned to the New York Navy Yard for an overhaul in late June. She spent the next three years conducting the normal routine of training with the Atlantic Fleet. On April 6, 1917, the United States entered [[World War I]], declaring war on [[Empire of Germany|Germany]] over its [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|campaign against Britain]]. ''Utah'' was stationed in [[Chesapeake Bay]] to train engine room personnel and gunners for the rapidly expanding fleet until August 30, 1918, when she departed for [[Bantry Bay]], Ireland with [[Vice Admiral]] [[Henry T. Mayo]], Commander-in-Chief of the Atlantic Fleet aboard. After arriving in Ireland, ''Utah'' was assigned as the [[flagship]] of Battleship Division&nbsp;6 (BatDiv&nbsp;6), commanded by [[Rear Admiral]] [[Thomas S. Rodgers]]. BatDiv&nbsp;6 was tasked with covering convoys in the [[Western Approaches]] against possible attacks from German surface raiders. ''Utah'' served in the division along with {{USS|Nevada|BB-36|2}} and {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37|2}}.{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}}{{sfn|Jones|pp=92, 102}}\n\nFollowing the end of the war in November 1918, ''Utah'' visited the [[Isle of Portland]] in Britain, and escorted the liner {{SS|George Washington||2}} in December, which carried President [[Woodrow Wilson]] to [[Brest, France|Brest]], France, for the post-war peace negotiations at [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]]. ''Utah'' left Brest on December 14, and arrived in New York on the 25th of the month. She remained there until January 30, 1919, after which time she returned to the normal peacetime routine of fleet exercises and training cruises. On July 9, 1921, ''Utah'' departed for Europe, stopping in [[Lisbon, Portugal|Lisbon]], Portugal, and [[Cherbourg, France|Cherbourg]], France. After arriving, she became the flagship of American warships in Europe. She carried on in this role until she was relieved by the [[armored cruiser]] {{USS|Pittsburgh|ACR-4|6}} in October 1922.{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}}\n\n===1922\u20131941===\n''Utah'' returned to the US on October 21, where she returned to her old post as the flagship of BatDiv 6.{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}} In early 1924, ''Utah'' took part in the [[Fleet Problem III]] maneuvers, where she and her sister ''Florida'' acted as stand-ins for the new {{sclass-|Colorado|battleship|1}}s.{{sfn|Nofi|p=26}} Later that year, ''Utah'' was chosen to carry the US diplomatic mission to the centennial celebration of the [[Battle of Ayacucho]], which took place on December 9, 1924. She left New York on November 22 with [[General of the Armies]] [[John J. Pershing]] aboard for a goodwill tour of South America; ''Utah'' arrived at [[Callao]], Peru, on 9 December. At the conclusion of Pershing's tour, ''Utah'' met him at [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, and then carried him to other ports, including [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, [[La Guaira, Venezuela]], and [[Havana]], Cuba. The tour ultimately ended when ''Utah'' returned Pershing to New York on March 13, 1925. ''Utah'' conducted midshipman training cruises over the summer of 1925. She was decommissioned at the [[Boston Navy Yard]] on October 31, 1925, and placed in drydock for modernization. The modernization replaced her coal-fired boilers with new oil-fired models, and her aft [[lattice mast|cage mast]] was replaced with a pole mast. She was reboilered with four [[White-Forster boiler|White-Forster]] oil-fired models that had been removed from the battleships and [[battlecruiser]]s scrapped as a result of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]]. ''Utah'' also had a [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] mounted on her Number 3 turret along with cranes for handling the [[floatplane]]s. {{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}}\n\n[[File:USS Utah (AG-16) being painted at Puget Sound 1941.jpg|left|thumb|''Utah'' being painted as her 1941 overhaul nears completion.]]\n\n''Utah'' returned to active duty on December 1, after which she served with the Scouting Fleet. She left Hampton Roads on November 21, 1928 for another South American cruise. This time, she picked up President-elect [[Herbert C. Hoover]] and his entourage in Montevideo, and transported them to Rio de Janeiro in December, and then carried them home to the United States, arriving in Hampton Roads on 6 January 1929. According to the terms of the [[London Naval Treaty]] of 1930, ''Utah'' was converted into a radio-controlled [[target ship]], to replace the older {{USS|North Dakota|BB-29|2}}. On July 1, 1931, ''Utah'' was accordingly redesignated \"AG-16\". All of her primary and secondary weapons were removed, though her turrets were still mounted. The plane handling equipment was removed along with the torpedo blisters that were added in 1925. Work was completed by 1 April 1932, when she was recommissioned.{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}}\n\nOn April 7, ''Utah'' left Norfolk for [[sea trial]]s to train her engine room crew and to test the radio-control equipment. The ship could be controlled at varying rates of speed and changes of course: maneuvers that a ship would conduct in battle. Her electric motors, operated by signals from the controlling ship, opened and closed throttle valves, moved her steering gear, and regulated the supply of oil to her boilers. In addition, a [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry gyro pilot]] kept the ship on course. She passed her radio control trials on 6 May, and on 1 June, the ship was operated for 3 hours under radio control. On June 9, she again left Norfolk, bound for [[San Pedro, California]], where she joined Training Squadron 1, [[Base Force]], [[United States Fleet]]. Starting in late July, the ship began her first round of target duty, first for the cruisers of the Pacific Fleet, and then for the battleship ''Nevada''. She continued in this role for the next nine years;{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}} she participated in [[Fleet Problem XVI]] in May 1935, during which she served as a transport for a contingent of Marines.{{sfn|Nofi|p=197}} In June, the ship was modified to train anti-aircraft gunners in addition to her target ship duties. To perform this task, she was equipped with a new [[1.1\"/75 caliber gun|{{convert|1.1|in|adj=on|0}}/75 caliber]] anti-aircraft gun in a quadruple mount for experimental testing and development of the new type of weapon.{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}}\n\n''Utah'' returned to the Atlantic to participate in [[Fleet Problem XX]] in January 1939, and at the end of the year, she trained with Submarine Squadron 6. She then returned to the Pacific, arriving in [[Pearl Harbor]] on August 1, 1940. There, she conducted anti-aircraft gunnery training until December 14, when she departed for [[Long Beach, California]], arriving on 21 December. There, she served as a bombing target for aircraft from the [[aircraft carrier|carriers]] {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}}, {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}}, and {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}. She returned to Pearl Harbor on April 1, 1941, where she resumed anti-aircraft gunnery training. She cruised to [[Los Angeles]] on 20 May to carry a contingent of Marines from the [[Fleet Marine Force]] to [[Bremerton, Washington]], after which she entered the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] on May 31, where she was overhauled. She was equipped with new [[5\"/38 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|adj=on|0}}/38 cal]] [[dual purpose gun]]s in single mounts to improve her ability to train anti-aircraft gunners. She left Puget Sound on September 14, bound for Pearl Harbor, where she resumed her normal duties through the rest of the year.{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}}\n\n===Attack on Pearl Harbor===\n[[File:USS Utah (AG-16) capsizing at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 (80-G-266626).jpg|thumb|''Utah'' capsizing during the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]]]\n{{main article|Attack on Pearl Harbor}}\nIn early December 1941, ''Utah'' was moored off [[Ford Island]] in berth F-11, after having completed another round of anti-aircraft gunnery training. Shortly before 08:00 on the morning of December 7, some crewmen aboard ''Utah'' observed the first Japanese planes approaching to [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack Pearl Harbor]], but they assumed they were American aircraft. The Japanese began their attack shortly thereafter, the first bombs falling near a seaplane ramp on the southern tip of Ford Island. At the same time sixteen [[Nakajima B5N]] torpedo bombers from the Japanese aircraft carriers {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Soryu||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiryu||2}} flew over Pearl City approaching the west side of Ford Island. The torpedo bombers were looking for American aircraft carriers, which usually anchored where ''Utah'' was moored that morning. The flight leaders identified ''Utah'' and rejected her as a target, deciding instead to attack 1010 Dock. However six of the B5Ns from ''Soryu'' led by Lieutenant Nakajima Tatsumi broke off to attack ''Utah'', not recognizing that the shapes over the barbettes were not turrets, but boxes covering empty holes. Six torpedoes were launched against ''Utah'', two of them struck the battleship while another missed and hit the cruiser {{USS|Raleigh|CL-7|2}}.{{sfn|Zimm|p=159}} \n\nSerious flooding started to quickly overwhelm ''Utah'' and she began to list to port and settle by the stern. As the crew began to abandon ship, one man\u2014Chief Watertender [[Peter Tomich]]\u2014remained below decks to ensure as many men as possible could escape, and to keep vital machinery running as long as possible; he received the [[Medal of Honor]] posthumously for his actions.{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}} At 08:12, ''Utah'' rolled over onto her side, while those crew members who had managed to escape swam to shore. Almost immediately after reaching shore, the ship's senior officer onboard, Commander Solomon Isquith, heard knocking from men trapped in the capsized ship. He called for volunteers to secure a cutting torch from the badly damaged cruiser ''Raleigh'' and attempt to free trapped men; they succeeded in rescuing four men. In total, 58 officers and men were killed, though 461 survived.{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}}\n\n===Salvage===\n[[File:The salvaging of the USS Utah.gif|thumb|''Utah'' being salvaged]]\nThe Navy declared ''Utah'' to be [[in ordinary]] on December 29, and she was placed under the authority of the Pearl Harbor Base Force. Following the successful righting (rotation to upright) of the [[capsizing|capsized]] ''Oklahoma'', an attempt was made to right the ''Utah'' by the same [[Parbuckle salvage|parbuckling]] method using 17 winches. As ''Utah'' was rotated, she did not grip the harbor bottom, and slid towards Ford Island. The ''Utah'' recovery effort was abandoned, with ''Utah'' rotated 38 degrees from horizontal.<ref>{{cite web|last=National Park Service|title=USS ARIZONA MEMORIAL: Submerged Cultural Resources Study (Chapter 2)|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/usar/scrs/scrs2o.htm|accessdate=21 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs abandoned, ''Utah'' cleared her berth. There was no further attempt to refloat her; unlike the battleships sunk at [[Battleship Row]], she had no military value. She was formally placed out of commission on  September 5, 1944, and then stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 13 November. ''Utah'' received one battle star for her brief service during [[World War II]]. Her rusting hulk remains in Pearl Harbor, partially above water;{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}} the men killed when ''Utah'' sank were never removed from the wreck, and as such, she is considered a [[war grave]].{{sfn|Nalty|p=35}}\n\n==Memorial==\n\nAround 1950, two memorials were placed at the wreck dedicated to the men in the ship's crew who were killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor. The first is a plaque on the wharf to the north of the ship, and the second is a plaque that was placed on the ship itself. In 1972, a larger memorial was erected just off Ford Island, near the sunken wreck,{{sfn|USS Utah (AG-16) Memorial}} and is now part of [[Pearl Harbor National Memorial]]. The memorial consists of a {{convert|70|ft|adj=on}} walkway made of white concrete, which extends from Ford Island out to a {{cvt|40|by|15|ft}} platform in front of the ship, where a brass plaque and a flagpole are located. The memorial is on the northwest side of Ford Island and is accessible only to individuals with military identification.{{sfn|Pearl Harbor Visitors Bureau}} A [[color guard]] stands watch over the wreck.{{sfn|Pearl Harbor Area Attractions}} On July 9, 1988, ''Utah'' and {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|2}}, the other remaining wreck in the harbor, were nominated to be added to the [[National Historic Landmark]] registry. Both wrecks were added to the list on May 5, 1989.{{sfn|Lenihan}} As of 2008, seven former crewmen who were aboard ''Utah'' at the time of her sinking have been cremated and had their ashes interred in the wreck.{{sfn|Former Sailor Interred}}\n\nRelics from the ship are also preserved in the [[Utah State Capitol]] building; among the items on display are pieces from the ship's silver service and the captain's clock.{{sfn|Utah state capitol memorial}} The ship's bell was on display at the [[University of Utah]] near the entrance of the Naval Science Building from the 1960s until 2016,{{sfn|Historic Bell}} when it was loaned to the [[Naval War College]].

The first ship of the [[United States Navy]] named after the state of [[Utah]], she had one [[sister ship]], {{USS|Florida|BB-30|2}}. ''Utah'' was built by the [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation]], laid down in March 1909 and launched in December of that year. She was completed in August 1911, and boasted a main battery of ten {{convert|12|in|adj=on|0}} guns in five twin [[gun turret]]s.\n\n''Utah'' and ''Florida'' were the first ships to arrive during the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]] in 1914 during the [[Mexican Revolution]]. The two battleships sent ashore a landing party that began the occupation of the city. After the American entrance into [[World War I]], ''Utah'' was stationed at [[Castletownbere|Berehaven]] in [[Bantry Bay]], Ireland, where she protected convoys from potential German surface raiders. Throughout the 1920s, the ship conducted numerous training cruises and fleet maneuvers, and carried dignitaries on tours of South America twice, in 1924 and 1928.\n\nIn 1931, ''Utah'' was demilitarized and converted into a [[target ship]] and re-designated as '''AG-16''', in accordance with the terms of the [[London Naval Treaty]] signed the previous year. She was also equipped with numerous [[anti-aircraft]] guns of different types to train gunners for the fleet. She served in these two roles for the rest of the decade, and late 1941 found the ship in [[Pearl Harbor]]. She was in port on the morning of 7 December, and in the first minutes of the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], was hit by two torpedoes, which caused serious flooding. ''Utah'' quickly rolled over and sank; the vast majority of her crew were able to escape, but 58 men were killed in the attack. The wreck remains in the harbor, and in 1972, a memorial was erected near the ship.\n\n==Design==\n{{main article|Florida-class battleship}}\n''Utah'' was {{cvt|521|ft|6|in|lk=on}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{cvt|88|ft|3|in}} and a [[draft (nautical)|draft]] of {{cvt|28|ft|6|in}}. She [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|21825|LT|t|lk=on}} as designed and up to {{cvt|23033|LT|t}} at [[full load]]. The ship was powered by four-shaft [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbines]] rated at {{cvt|28000|shp|lk=on|0}} and twelve coal-fired [[Babcock & Wilcox]] [[boiler]]s, generating a top speed of {{cvt|20.75|kn|lk=on}}. The ship had a cruising range of {{cvt|5776|nmi|mi km|-1|lk=on}} at a speed of {{cvt|10|kn}}. She had a crew of 1,001 officers and men.{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=114}}\n\nThe ship was armed with a main battery of ten [[12\"/45 caliber Mark 5 gun|12-inch/45]]{{efn|/45 refers to the length of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibers]]. A /45 gun is 45 times long as it is in bore diameter.}} Mark 5 guns in five twin [[gun turret]]s on the centerline, two of which were placed in a [[superfire|superfiring pair]] forward. The other three turrets were placed aft of the [[superstructure]]. The secondary battery consisted of sixteen [[5\"/51 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|adj=on|0}}/51]] guns mounted in [[casemate]]s along the side of the hull. As was standard for [[capital ship]]s of the period, she carried a pair of {{convert|21|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s, submerged in her hull on the broadside. The main [[armored belt]] was {{cvt|11|in|0}} thick, while the armored deck was {{cvt|1.5|in|0}} thick. The gun turrets had {{cvt|12|in|0}} thick faces and the [[conning tower]] had {{cvt|11.5|in|0}} thick sides.{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=114}}\n\n==Service history==\n===Construction \u2013 1922===\n[[File:Uss utah bb.jpg|thumb|left|''Utah'' in her original guise, circa 1911]]\n\n''Utah'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] at the [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation]] on 15 March 1909. She was [[ship launching|launched]] on 23 December 1909 and was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the [[United States Navy]] on 31 August 1911.{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=114}} She then conducted a [[shakedown cruise]] that stopped in [[Hampton Roads]], [[Santa Rosa Island, Florida|Santa Rosa Island]], [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Kingston, Jamaica]], and [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]], Cuba. She was then assigned to the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]] in March 1912, after which time she participated in gunnery drills. She underwent an overhaul at the [[New York Navy Yard]] starting on 16 April. ''Utah'' left New York on 1 June and proceeded to [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]] by way of Hampton Roads, arriving on 6 June. From there, she took a crew of naval cadets from the [[USNA|Naval Academy]] on a midshipman training cruise off the coast of [[New England]], which lasted until 25 August.{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}}\n\nFor the next two years, ''Utah'' followed a similar routine of training exercises and midshipman cruises in the Atlantic. During the period 8&ndash;30 November 1913, ''Utah'' made a goodwill cruise to European waters, which included a stop in [[Villefranche-sur-Mer|Villefranche]], France. In early 1914 during the [[Mexican Revolution]], the United States decided to intervene in the fighting. While en route to Mexico on 16 April, ''Utah'' was ordered to intercept the German-flagged steamer {{SS|Ypiranga||6}}, which was carrying arms to the Mexican dictator [[Victoriano Huerta]]. ''Ypiranga''{{'}}s arrival in [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] prompted the US to [[United States occupation of Veracruz|occupy the city]];{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}} ''Utah'' and her [[sister ship]] ''Florida'' were the first American vessels on the scene. The two ships landed a combined contingent of a thousand [[USMC|Marines]] and [[:wikt:bluejacket|Bluejackets]] to begin the occupation of the city on 21 April. Over the next three days, the Marines battled rebels in the city and suffered 94 casualties, while killing hundreds of Mexicans in return.{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=114}}\n\n[[File:USS Utah, during WWI.jpg|thumb|''Utah'' during World War I wearing [[dazzle camouflage]]]]\n''Utah'' remained off Veracruz for two months, before she returned to the New York Navy Yard for an overhaul in late June. She spent the next three years conducting the normal routine of training with the Atlantic Fleet. On 6 April 1917, the United States entered [[World War I]], declaring war on [[Empire of Germany|Germany]] over its [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|campaign against Britain]]. ''Utah'' was stationed in [[Chesapeake Bay]] to train engine room personnel and gunners for the rapidly expanding fleet until 30 August 1918, when she departed for [[Bantry Bay]], Ireland with [[Vice Admiral]] [[Henry T. Mayo]], Commander-in-Chief of the Atlantic Fleet aboard. After arriving in Ireland, ''Utah'' was assigned as the [[flagship]] of Battleship Division&nbsp;6 (BatDiv&nbsp;6), commanded by [[Rear Admiral]] [[Thomas S. Rodgers]]. BatDiv&nbsp;6 was tasked with covering convoys in the [[Western Approaches]] against possible attacks from German surface raiders. ''Utah'' served in the division along with {{USS|Nevada|BB-36|2}} and {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37|2}}.{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}}{{sfn|Jones|pp=92, 102}}\n\nFollowing the end of the war in November 1918, ''Utah'' visited the [[Isle of Portland]] in Britain, and escorted the liner {{SS|George Washington||2}} in December, which carried President [[Woodrow Wilson]] to [[Brest, France|Brest]], France, for the post-war peace negotiations at [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]]. ''Utah'' left Brest on 14 December, and arrived in New York on the 25th of the month. She remained there until 30 January 1919, after which time she returned to the normal peacetime routine of fleet exercises and training cruises. On 9 July 1921, ''Utah'' departed for Europe, stopping in [[Lisbon, Portugal|Lisbon]], Portugal, and [[Cherbourg, France|Cherbourg]], France. After arriving, she became the flagship of American warships in Europe. She carried on in this role until she was relieved by the [[armored cruiser]] {{USS|Pittsburgh|ACR-4|6}} in October 1922.{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}}\n\n===1922\u20131941===\n''Utah'' returned to the US on 21 October, where she returned to her old post as the flagship of BatDiv 6.{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}} In early 1924, ''Utah'' took part in the [[Fleet Problem III]] maneuvers, where she and her sister ''Florida'' acted as stand-ins for the new {{sclass-|Colorado|battleship|1}}s.{{sfn|Nofi|p=26}} Later that year, ''Utah'' was chosen to carry the US diplomatic mission to the centennial celebration of the [[Battle of Ayacucho]], which took place on 9 December 1924. She left New York on 22 November with [[General of the Armies]] [[John J. Pershing]] aboard for a goodwill tour of South America; ''Utah'' arrived at [[Callao]], Peru, on 9 December. At the conclusion of Pershing's tour, ''Utah'' met him at [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, and then carried him to other ports, including [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, [[La Guaira, Venezuela]], and [[Havana]], Cuba. The tour ultimately ended when ''Utah'' returned Pershing to New York on 13 March 1925. ''Utah'' conducted midshipman training cruises over the summer of 1925. She was decommissioned at the [[Boston Navy Yard]] on 31 October 1925, and placed in drydock for modernization. The modernization replaced her coal-fired boilers with new oil-fired models, and her aft [[lattice mast|cage mast]] was replaced with a pole mast. She was reboilered with four [[White-Forster boiler|White-Forster]] oil-fired models that had been removed from the battleships and [[battlecruiser]]s scrapped as a result of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]]. ''Utah'' also had a [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] mounted on her Number 3 turret along with cranes for handling the [[floatplane]]s. {{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}}\n\n[[File:USS Utah (AG-16) being painted at Puget Sound 1941.jpg|left|thumb|''Utah'' being painted as her 1941 overhaul nears completion.]]\n\n''Utah'' returned to active duty on 1 December, after which she served with the Scouting Fleet. She left Hampton Roads on 21 November 1928 for another South American cruise. This time, she picked up President-elect [[Herbert C. Hoover]] and his entourage in Montevideo, and transported them to Rio de Janeiro in December, and then carried them home to the United States, arriving in Hampton Roads on 6 January 1929. According to the terms of the [[London Naval Treaty]] of 1930, ''Utah'' was converted into a radio-controlled [[target ship]], to replace the older {{USS|North Dakota|BB-29|2}}. On 1 July 1931, ''Utah'' was accordingly redesignated \"AG-16\". All of her primary and secondary weapons were removed, though her turrets were still mounted. The plane handling equipment was removed along with the torpedo blisters that were added in 1925. Work was completed by 1 April 1932, when she was recommissioned.{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}}\n\nOn 7 April, ''Utah'' left Norfolk for [[sea trial]]s to train her engine room crew and to test the radio-control equipment. The ship could be controlled at varying rates of speed and changes of course: maneuvers that a ship would conduct in battle. Her electric motors, operated by signals from the controlling ship, opened and closed throttle valves, moved her steering gear, and regulated the supply of oil to her boilers. In addition, a [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry gyro pilot]] kept the ship on course. She passed her radio control trials on 6 May, and on 1 June, the ship was operated for 3 hours under radio control. On 9 June, she again left Norfolk, bound for [[San Pedro, California]], where she joined Training Squadron 1, [[Base Force]], [[United States Fleet]]. Starting in late July, the ship began her first round of target duty, first for the cruisers of the Pacific Fleet, and then for the battleship ''Nevada''. She continued in this role for the next nine years;{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}} she participated in [[Fleet Problem XVI]] in May 1935, during which she served as a transport for a contingent of Marines.{{sfn|Nofi|p=197}} In June, the ship was modified to train anti-aircraft gunners in addition to her target ship duties. To perform this task, she was equipped with a new [[1.1\"/75 caliber gun|{{convert|1.1|in|adj=on|0}}/75 caliber]] anti-aircraft gun in a quadruple mount for experimental testing and development of the new type of weapon.{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}}\n\n''Utah'' returned to the Atlantic to participate in [[Fleet Problem XX]] in January 1939, and at the end of the year, she trained with Submarine Squadron 6. She then returned to the Pacific, arriving in [[Pearl Harbor]] on 1 August 1940. There, she conducted anti-aircraft gunnery training until 14 December, when she departed for [[Long Beach, California]], arriving on 21 December. There, she served as a bombing target for aircraft from the [[aircraft carrier|carriers]] {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}}, {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}}, and {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 1 April 1941, where she resumed anti-aircraft gunnery training. She cruised to [[Los Angeles]] on 20 May to carry a contingent of Marines from the [[Fleet Marine Force]] to [[Bremerton, Washington]], after which she entered the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] on 31 May, where she was overhauled. She was equipped with new [[5\"/38 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|adj=on|0}}/38 cal]] [[dual purpose gun]]s in single mounts to improve her ability to train anti-aircraft gunners. She left Puget Sound on 14 September, bound for Pearl Harbor, where she resumed her normal duties through the rest of the year.{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}}\n\n===Attack on Pearl Harbor===\n[[File:USS Utah (AG-16) capsizing at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 (80-G-266626).jpg|thumb|''Utah'' capsizing during the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]]]\n{{main article|Attack on Pearl Harbor}}\nIn early December 1941, ''Utah'' was moored off [[Ford Island]] in berth F-11, after having completed another round of anti-aircraft gunnery training. Shortly before 08:00 on the morning of 7 December, some crewmen aboard ''Utah'' observed the first Japanese planes approaching to [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack Pearl Harbor]], but they assumed they were American aircraft. The Japanese began their attack shortly thereafter, the first bombs falling near a seaplane ramp on the southern tip of Ford Island. At the same time sixteen [[Nakajima B5N]] torpedo bombers from the Japanese aircraft carriers {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Soryu||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiryu||2}} flew over Pearl City approaching the west side of Ford Island. The torpedo bombers were looking for American aircraft carriers, which usually anchored where ''Utah'' was moored that morning. The flight leaders identified ''Utah'' and rejected her as a target, deciding instead to attack 1010 Dock. However six of the B5Ns from ''Soryu'' led by Lieutenant Nakajima Tatsumi broke off to attack ''Utah'', not recognizing that the shapes over the barbettes were not turrets, but boxes covering empty holes. Six torpedoes were launched against ''Utah'', two of them struck the battleship while another missed and hit the cruiser {{USS|Raleigh|CL-7|2}}.{{sfn|Zimm|p=159}} \n\nSerious flooding started to quickly overwhelm ''Utah'' and she began to list to port and settle by the stern. As the crew began to abandon ship, one man\u2014Chief Watertender [[Peter Tomich]]\u2014remained below decks to ensure as many men as possible could escape, and to keep vital machinery running as long as possible; he received the [[Medal of Honor]] posthumously for his actions.{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}} At 08:12, ''Utah'' rolled over onto her side, while those crew members who had managed to escape swam to shore. Almost immediately after reaching shore, the ship's senior officer onboard, Commander Solomon Isquith, heard knocking from men trapped in the capsized ship. He called for volunteers to secure a cutting torch from the badly damaged cruiser ''Raleigh'' and attempt to free trapped men; they succeeded in rescuing four men. In total, 58 officers and men were killed, though 461 survived.{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}}\n\n===Salvage===\n[[File:The salvaging of the USS Utah.gif|thumb|''Utah'' being salvaged]]\nThe Navy declared ''Utah'' to be [[in ordinary]] on 29 December, and she was placed under the authority of the Pearl Harbor Base Force. Following the successful righting (rotation to upright) of the [[capsizing|capsized]] ''Oklahoma'', an attempt was made to right the ''Utah'' by the same [[Parbuckle salvage|parbuckling]] method using 17 winches. As ''Utah'' was rotated, she did not grip the harbor bottom, and slid towards Ford Island.

There was no further attempt to refloat her; unlike the battleships sunk at [[Battleship Row]], she had no military value. She was formally placed out of commission on 5 September 1944, and then stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 13 November. ''Utah'' received one battle star for her brief service during [[World War II]]. Her rusting hulk remains in Pearl Harbor, partially above water;{{sfn|DANFS Utah (BB-31)}} the men killed when ''Utah'' sank were never removed from the wreck, and as such, she is considered a [[war grave]].{{sfn|Nalty|p=35}}\n\n==Memorial==\n\nAround 1950, two memorials were placed at the wreck dedicated to the men in the ship's crew who were killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor. The first is a plaque on the wharf to the north of the ship, and the second is a plaque that was placed on the ship itself. In 1972, a larger memorial was erected just off Ford Island, near the sunken wreck,{{sfn|USS Utah (AG-16) Memorial}} and is now part of [[Pearl Harbor National Memorial]]. The memorial consists of a {{convert|70|ft|adj=on}} walkway made of white concrete, which extends from Ford Island out to a {{cvt|40|by|15|ft}} platform in front of the ship, where a brass plaque and a flagpole are located. The memorial is on the northwest side of Ford Island and is accessible only to individuals with military identification.{{sfn|Pearl Harbor Visitors Bureau}} A [[color guard]] stands watch over the wreck.{{sfn|Pearl Harbor Area Attractions}} On 9 July 1988, ''Utah'' and {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|2}}, the other remaining wreck in the harbor, were nominated to be added to the [[National Historic Landmark]] registry.

The cranium is bulbous and taller than the snout, a feature shared with [[kerivoula|woolly bats]] and [[myotis|mouse-eared bats]]. This combination of  features was likely present in the common ancestor of the vesper bats. They have two tiny, vestigial premolars between the upper canines and first large premolar. Unlike other bats, they lack a tendon-locking mechanism in their toes.\n\nThe common name bent-winged bat refers to their most obvious feature, the group's ability to fold back an exceptionally long third finger when the wings are folded. This finger gives the bats long, narrow wings that allows them to move at high speed in open environments and in some species to migrate over a distance of hundreds of kilometres.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title = Bent-winged bats: wide ranges, very weird wings (vesper bats part III)|journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume = 31|issue = 2|pages = 431\u2013439|url = http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2011/03/19/bent-winged-bats/|accessdate = 2015-05-07|doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2003.08.017|pmid = 15062785|year = 2004|last1 = Appleton|first1 = B.R.|last2 = McKenzie|first2 = J.A.|last3 = Christidis|first3 = L.}}</ref><ref name=\"Teeling2007\" /> The proportional length of the wing is around two and a half times that of the body and head.<ref name=\"FoA1989\">{{cite book|section=42.

The genus was nested  within [[Vespertilionidae]] as Miniopterinae, one of five subfamilies, with doubts remaining on the relationships to sister groups. The position of the minopterines was determined as showing a phylogenetic relationship to either the vespertilionids or the [[molossid]]s, these assumptions were compared and analysed in study using large data sets derived from multiple genetic indicators and statistical analysis to determine the basal relationships within the [[Chiroptera]] order. The authors of this 2007 study found support for elevation to the rank of family\u2014as Miniopteridae\u2014and that the vespertilionids and ''Miniopterus'' species formed a clade that had diverged from the molossids (free-tailed bats) at a period around 54\u201343 million years ago and from other species 49\u201338 [[Mya (unit)|mya]].<ref name=\"Teeling2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Teeling |first1=E.C. |last2=Springer |first2=M.S. |last3=Jacobs |first3=D.S. |last4=O'Brien |first4=S.J. |last5=Murphy |first5=W.J. |last6=Miller-Butterworth |first6=X.M. |title=A Family Matter: Conclusive Resolution of the Taxonomic Position of the Long-Fingered Bats, Miniopterus |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |date=1 July 2007 |volume=24 |issue=7 |pages=1553\u20131561 |language=en |issn=0737-4038|doi=10.1093/molbev/msm076 |pmid=17449895 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n== Morphology ==\nBent-winged bats are typically small (total length c. 10&nbsp;cm, wingspans 30\u201335&nbsp;cm, mass less than 20 g), with broad, short muzzles. The cranium is bulbous and taller than the snout, a feature shared with [[kerivoula|woolly bats]] and [[myotis|mouse-eared bats]]. This combination of  features was likely present in the common ancestor of the vesper bats. They have two tiny, vestigial premolars between the upper canines and first large premolar. Unlike other bats, they lack a tendon-locking mechanism in their toes.\n\nThe common name bent-winged bat refers to their most obvious feature, the group's ability to fold back an exceptionally long third finger when the wings are folded. This finger gives the bats long, narrow wings that allows them to move at high speed in open environments and in some species to migrate over a distance of hundreds of kilometres.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title = Bent-winged bats: wide ranges, very weird wings (vesper bats part III)|journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume = 31|issue = 2|pages = 431\u2013439|url = http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2011/03/19/bent-winged-bats/|accessdate = 2015-05-07|doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2003.08.017|pmid = 15062785|year = 2004|last1 = Appleton|first1 = B.R.|last2 = McKenzie|first2 = J.A.|last3 = Christidis|first3 = L.}}</ref><ref name=\"Teeling2007\" /> The proportional length of the wing is around two and a half times that of the body and head.<ref name=\"FoA1989\">{{cite book|section=42.

The game was initially released for [[Microsoft Windows]] in February 2016, with ports later being released for [[macOS]], [[Linux]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation Vita]], [[iOS]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].\n\nIn ''Stardew Valley'', players take the role of a character who, to get away from the hustle of the city, takes over their deceased grandfather's dilapidated farm in a place known as Stardew Valley. The game is open-ended, allowing players to take on several activities such as growing crops, raising livestock, crafting goods, mining for ores, selling produce, and socializing with the townsfolk, including marriage and having children. The game also allows up to three other players to play together online.\n\nBarone developed the game by himself over four years. The game was heavily inspired by the ''[[Story of Seasons|Harvest Moon]]'' video game series, with additions to address some of the shortcomings of these games while using the opportunity as an exercise to improve his own programming and game design skills. [[Chucklefish]] approached Barone midway through development with the offer to publish the game, allowing him to focus more on completing it. ''Stardew Valley'' was both a critical and commercial success, selling over 10 million copies across all platforms by 2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Stardew valley screenshot.png|thumb|left|''Stardew Valley'' puts players in charge of running a farm, including growing crops and raising livestock.]]\n''Stardew Valley'' is a farming [[simulation video game|simulation]] game primarily inspired by the ''[[Story of Seasons|Harvest Moon]]'' video game series.<ref name=\"Kotaku 1 March 2016\">{{Cite web |last1=Grayson |first1=Nathan |title=Steam's Latest Hit Is A Game About Farming And Relationships |url=http://steamed.kotaku.com/steams-latest-hit-is-a-game-about-farming-and-relations-1762038774 |accessdate=March 1, 2016 |work=[[Kotaku]] |date=March 1, 2016}}</ref> At the start of the game, players create their character, who becomes the recipient of a plot of land including a small house once owned by their grandfather in a small town called Pelican Town.

Players can also engage in fishing, cooking, and crafting, and also explore [[procedurally-generated]] caves with materials and ores to mine or battle creatures within. Players can take on various quests to earn additional money, or work at completing bundles; specific collections of materials offered to the town's Community Center. Completing bundles rewards players with various items, including seeds and tools. Completing multiple bundles grants players access to new areas and game mechanics, such as a desert.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/12298-the-many-hidden-secrets-of-stardew-valley|title=The Many Hidden Secrets of Stardew Valley - GameRevolution|date=March 2, 2016|work=GameRevolution|access-date=September 27, 2017|language=en}}</ref> All of these activities must be metered against the character's current health, exhaustion level, and the game's internal clock. If players become too exhausted anywhere outside of their house, they will be forced to pay 10% of their gold up to 1,000 g and will be returned to their house and restored with energy on the morning of the next day, but having forgone any opportunities to continue in activities from the previous day. If players lose too much health, they will lose most of their energy and a random amount of money and items. The game uses a simplified calendar, each year having only four 28-day months that represent each [[season]], which determines which crops can be grown and which activities can be beneficial. Later in the game, players can restore a [[greenhouse]] which is able to grow any crop regardless of the current season. The character is evaluated by their third year, but there is no deadline that otherwise ends the game.\n\n==Development==\n''Stardew Valley'' was created by American [[indie game]] designer Eric

of crafting a game which would also pull in his artistic side.<ref name=\"pcgamer interview\"/> As a native of the [[Pacific Northwest]], Barone incorporated many elements of the region into the gameplay and art.<ref name=\"king-tv 2020\">{{cite web | url =

the ''Harvest Moon'' series, as he felt \"the series had gotten progressively worse after ''[[Harvest Moon: Back to Nature]]''\".<ref name=\"Daily Sun\">{{cite web |last1=Lin |first1=Amy

|date=February 23, 2016 |accessdate=March 9, 2016}}</ref> Unable to find a satisfactory replacement, Barone began to create a game similar to the series, stating that his intent was \"to address the problems I had with ''Harvest Moon''\" and that \"no title in the series ever brought it all together in a perfect way\".<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/> Barone was also inspired by other games, including ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', ''[[Rune Factory]]'', ''[[Minecraft]]'', and ''[[Terraria]]'', adding features seen in those games such as crafting, quests, and combat.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/><ref>{{cite

releasing the title on [[Xbox Live Indie Games]] due to the ease of publishing on that platform, but found early on that his scope for the game became much larger than originally anticipated.<ref name=\"pcgamer interview\"/> Barone publicly announced the game in September 2012, using [[Steam (software)|Steam]]'s Greenlight system to gauge interest on the game.<ref name=\"polygon popular\"/><ref name=\"gamasutra\"/><ref name=\"Daily Sun\"/> After the title was shown a great deal of support from the community, Barone began working on the title in full, engaging with [[Reddit]] and [[Twitter]] communities to discuss his progress and gain feedback on proposed additions.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/> Shortly after the Greenlight period in 2013, he was approached by Finn Brice, director of [[Chucklefish]], who offered to help publish the game on release.<ref name=\"pcgamer interview\"/> Chucklefish took over many of the non-development activities for Barone, such as site hosting and setting up his development [[wiki]].<ref name=\"MCV\"/> Barone decided not to use Steam's [[early access]] feature for development, as he felt that it was not well suited to Stardew Valley.<ref name=\"MCV\"/>Barone spent four years working on the project, redoing it multiple times, and was the sole developer on the game, frequently spending 10 hours or more a day working on it. He programmed it in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] using the [[Microsoft XNA]] framework, while also creating all of the game's pixel art and composing all of the music.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/><ref name=\"Daily Sun\"/>\n\n{{listen |filename=Stardew Valley - Stardew Valley Overture.ogg|title=\"Stardew Valley Overture\"|description=Title screen song, composed by

messages\".<ref name=\"vulture\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=5 Things You Should Know About 2016\u2019s Best Game: Stardew Valley |url=https://www.format.com/magazine/news/photography/stardew-valley-game |website=Format Magazine |accessdate=September 27, 2016 |date=March 28, 2016 |first=Jill Blackmore |last=Evans}}</ref>  In contrast to the pre-Back to Nature Harvest Moon (Back to Nature onwards are open-ended), which could end after two years of in-game time has passed, Barone kept ''Stardew Valley'' open-ended so that players would not feel rushed to try to complete everything possible.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> During development, Barone recognized that some players would attempt to figure out mechanically how to maximize their farm's yield and profit through spreadsheets and other tools, but hoped that most players would take the time to learn these on their own.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> To that end, he designed the cooking aspect of the game purposely to not be profitable, but instead pay back in bonuses that aided exploration, farming, mining and fishing skills.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> Barone also opted to not include the butchering of farm animals for meat products, encouraging players to name and tend to each animal individually in staying with the feeling he wanted for the game.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> The animals cannot die but, if not tended to, stop producing products.\n\n===Release===\nIn April 2015, Barone announced he intended to release the game only once he felt it was feature complete, refusing to put the game onto the Early Access program, or accept any pre-sale payments.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/> The game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on February 26, 2016.<ref name=\"polygon popular\"/> Following its release, Barone continued to work on the game, taking feedback from the community and patching bugs, and stated plans to add in additional features at a later date.<ref name=\"kotaku popularity\">{{cite web

The game was initially released for [[Microsoft Windows]] in February 2016, with ports later being released for [[macOS]], [[Linux]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation Vita]], [[iOS]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].\n\nIn ''Stardew Valley'', players take the role of a character who, to get away from the hustle of the city, takes over their deceased grandfather's dilapidated farm in a place known as Stardew Valley. The game is open-ended, allowing players to take on several activities such as growing crops, raising livestock, crafting goods, mining for ores, selling produce, and socializing with the townsfolk, including marriage and having children. The game also allows up to three other players to play together online.\n\nBarone developed the game by himself over four years. The game was heavily inspired by the ''[[Story of Seasons|Harvest Moon]]'' video game series, with additions to address some of the shortcomings of these games while using the opportunity as an exercise to improve his own programming and game design skills. [[Chucklefish]] approached Barone midway through development with the offer to publish the game, allowing him to focus more on completing it. ''Stardew Valley'' was both a critical and commercial success, selling over 10 million copies across all platforms by 2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Stardew valley screenshot.png|thumb|left|''Stardew Valley'' puts players in charge of running a farm, including growing crops and raising livestock.]]\n''Stardew Valley'' is a farming [[simulation video game|simulation]] game primarily inspired by the ''[[Story of Seasons|Harvest Moon]]'' video game series.<ref name=\"Kotaku 1 March 2016\">{{Cite web |last1=Grayson |first1=Nathan |title=Steam's Latest Hit Is A Game About Farming And Relationships |url=http://steamed.kotaku.com/steams-latest-hit-is-a-game-about-farming-and-relations-1762038774 |accessdate=March 1, 2016 |work=[[Kotaku]] |date=March 1, 2016}}</ref> At the start of the game, players create their character, who becomes the recipient of a plot of land including a small house once owned by their grandfather in a small town called Pelican Town.

Players can also engage in fishing, cooking, and crafting, and also explore [[procedurally-generated]] caves with materials and ores to mine or battle creatures within. Players can take on various quests to earn additional money, or work at completing bundles; specific collections of materials offered to the town's Community Center. Completing bundles rewards players with various items, including seeds and tools. Completing multiple bundles grants players access to new areas and game mechanics, such as a desert.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/12298-the-many-hidden-secrets-of-stardew-valley|title=The Many Hidden Secrets of Stardew Valley - GameRevolution|date=March 2, 2016|work=GameRevolution|access-date=September 27, 2017|language=en}}</ref> All of these activities must be metered against the character's current health, exhaustion level, and the game's internal clock. If players become too exhausted anywhere outside of their house, they will be forced to pay 10% of their gold up to 1,000 g and will be returned to their house and restored with energy on the morning of the next day, but having forgone any opportunities to continue in activities from the previous day. If players lose too much health, they will lose most of their energy and a random amount of money and items. The game uses a simplified calendar, each year having only four 28-day months that represent each [[season]], which determines which crops can be grown and which activities can be beneficial. Later in the game, players can restore a [[greenhouse]] which is able to grow any crop regardless of the current season. The character is evaluated by their third year, but there is no deadline that otherwise ends the game.\n\n==Development==\n''Stardew Valley'' was created by American [[indie game]] designer Eric

and [[Twitter]] communities to discuss his progress and gain feedback on proposed additions.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/> Shortly after the Greenlight period in 2013, he was approached by Finn Brice, director of [[Chucklefish]], who offered to help publish the game on release.<ref name=\"pcgamer interview\"/> Chucklefish took over many of the non-development activities for Barone, such as site hosting and setting up his development [[wiki]].<ref name=\"MCV\"/> Barone decided not to use Steam's [[early access]] feature for development, as he felt that it was not well suited to Stardew Valley.<ref name=\"MCV\"/>Barone spent four years working on the project, redoing it multiple times, and was the sole developer on the game, frequently spending 10 hours or more a day working on it. He programmed it in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] using the [[Microsoft XNA]] framework, while also creating all of the game's pixel art and composing all of the music.<ref

open-ended), which could end after two years of in-game time has passed, Barone kept ''Stardew Valley'' open-ended so that players would not feel rushed to try to complete everything possible.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> During development, Barone recognized that some players would attempt to figure out mechanically how to maximize their farm's yield and profit through spreadsheets and other tools, but hoped that most players would take the time to learn these on their own.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> To that end, he designed the cooking aspect of the game purposely to not be profitable, but instead pay back in bonuses that aided exploration, farming, mining and fishing skills.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> Barone also opted to not include the butchering of farm animals for meat products, encouraging players to name and tend to each animal individually in staying with the feeling he wanted for the game.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> The animals cannot die but, if not tended to, stop producing products.\n\n===Release===\nIn April 2015, Barone announced he intended to release the game only once he felt it was feature complete, refusing to put the game onto the Early Access program, or accept any pre-sale payments.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/> The game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on February 26, 2016.<ref name=\"polygon popular\"/> Following its release, Barone continued to work on
