After traveling the state to recruit a few students, Meigs opened the school with no building in the fall of 1801. The first school building patterned after Yale's [[Connecticut Hall]] was built the year later.

In 1872, the $243,000 federal allotment to Georgia was invested to create a $16,000 annual income used to establish the Georgia State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (A&M), initially separate and independent from the University of Georgia. However, A&M's funding was considered part of the university, which helped save it from bankruptcy during the [[Reconstruction era]].<ref name=\":4\" /> As a land-grant school, UGA was required to provide military training, which the university began to offer in the 1870s.<ref name=\":5\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=5}}</ref>\n\nSeveral of the university's extracurricular organizations began in the late 1800s. In 1886, fraternities at UGA began publishing the school's yearbook, the ''Pandora''. The same year, the university gained its first intercollegiate sport when a baseball team was formed, followed by a football team formed in 1892. Both teams played in a small field west of campus now known as [[Herty Field]]. The Demosthenian and [[Phi Kappa Literary Society|Phi Kappa]] literary societies together formed the student paper, ''[[The Red & Black (University of Georgia)|The Red & Black]]'', in 1883.<ref name=\":5\" /> In 1894, the University of Georgia joined six other southeastern schools to form the [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] (SIAA).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZyqWE2wlYJ4C|title=How the SEC Became Goliath: The Making of College Football's Most Dominant Conference|last=Glier|first=Ray|date=September 25, 2012|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4767-0328-2|pages=23|language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|20th century}}<!-- Anchor for redirects of [college] articles; caution. -->\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n[[File:Mary Ethel Creswell graduation photo 1919.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Mary Ethel Creswell]], in 1919, the first woman to earn an undergraduate degree at the university]]\nThe turn of the century brought many changes in the administration and organization of the university including the naming of a new chancellor in 1899. [[Walter Barnard Hill|Walter B. Hill]] became the first UGA alumnus to lead the university. A progressive and enlightened leader, his six-year tenure, before his death from pneumonia, was marked with increased enrollment, expansion of the university's course offerings, and the addition of state funding through appropriation, for the first time bringing the university's annual income to over $100,000 in 1902. Hill and his successors [[David Crenshaw Barrow Jr.|David C. Barrow]] (1906\u20131925), [[Charles Mercer Snelling|Charles Snelling]] (1926\u20131932), and [[Steadman Vincent Sanford|Steadman Sanford]] (1932\u20131935) would grow the school to take on the role of a true university.<ref name=\":5\" /> Many of the university's schools and colleges were established during Barrow's tenure. The College of Education (1908), the [[University of Georgia Graduate School|Graduate School]] (1910), the [[Terry College of Business|School of Commerce]] (1912), the [[Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication|School of Journalism]] (1915), and the [[University of Georgia College of Family and Consumer Sciences|Division of Home Economics]] (1918) were all established during this period. In 1906, UGA also incorporated the [[University of Georgia College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences|College of Agriculture]] by bringing together A&M (agricultural and mechanical) courses. The college of science and engineering continued as formed in the previous century. Connor Hall became the first building built in South Campus and first of several buildings that housed the university's agriculture programs on what came to be known as \"Ag Hill\". In 1914, the first [[Phi Beta Kappa]] chapter in the state of Georgia was founded at UGA.<ref name=\":6\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=6}}</ref> In 1923, another honor society, [[Phi Kappa Phi]], established a chapter at the university.<ref>{{Harvnb|Boney|2000|p=113}}</ref> In 1920, UGA's athletic program was among 14 of the 30 universities to leave the SIAA to form the [[Southern Conference]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cm1TZA6jCSgC|title=SEC Football: 75 Years of Pride and Passion|last=Scott|first=Richard|date=September 15, 2008|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-1-61673-133-5|pages=16|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWith students limited to white males for the first century of its history, the University of Georgia began admitting white female students during the summer of 1903 as postgraduate students to the [[State Normal School (Athens, Georgia)|State Normal School]] established in 1893 a few miles west of the campus. When the University of Georgia established a graduate school in 1910, female students were permitted to attend summer classes and some were also unofficially allowed to attend regular classes, as well.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|pp=6\u20137}}</ref> However, at that time only junior college transfers majoring in Home Economics were integrated into regular courses.<ref name=\":6\" /> Before official admission of women to the university, several women were able to complete graduate degrees through credit earned during the summer sessions.

The State Normal School (later State Teachers College) was fully absorbed by the College of Education, with the former's previous campus becoming UGA's Coordinate Campus. UGA and [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] traded several school programs; all engineering programs (except agriculture) were transferred to Georgia Tech and UGA received Georgia Tech's commerce program in return. The title of the university's lead administrator was changed from chancellor back to the original title of president. Sanford was named UGA's first president since 1860<ref name=\":8\" /> and was succeeded by [[Harmon White Caldwell|Harmon Caldwell]] (1935\u20131948). In 1933, the Division of Home Economics was reorganized as the [[University of Georgia College of Family and Consumer Sciences|School of Home of Economics]],<ref name=\":10\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=9}}</ref> with UGA's first female graduate, Creswell, appointed as dean.<ref name=\":9\" /> The university also became a founding member of the [[Southeastern Conference]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FJUIUzD4joAC|title=Games Colleges Play: Scandal and Reform in Intercollegiate Athletics|last=Thelin|first=John R.|date=June 1, 2011|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-1-4214-0391-5|at=Chapter 2|language=en}}</ref> and established the [[University of Georgia Press]] in 1938.<ref name=\":11\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=11}}</ref><ref name=\":12\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=45}}</ref>\n\nThroughout this period, UGA's enrollment grew every year with student population reaching 3,000 by 1937 and almost 4,000 by 1941. Through President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], UGA received a $2 million infusion of funding and an additional $1 million from the state legislature. The university used the new funds to make a number of improvements to the campus from 1936 to the early 1940s. Many renovation projects were undertaken including the establishment of five new residence halls, a dining hall, eight new academic buildings, a nursery school, and several auxiliary facilities. An engineering professor Rudolph Driftmier and architect Roy Hitchcock were responsible for the design of several buildings in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]], giving the campus a homogeneous and distinctive appearance. The funds were also used to pave roads, build sidewalks, and improve the campus's landscaping.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n=== Racial integration and the mid 20th century ===\nThe dean of the College of Education in 1941, [[Walter Cocking]], was fired by Georgia Governor [[Eugene Talmadge]] in a controversial decision known as the [[Cocking affair]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cook|first=James F|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-594|title=Cocking Affair|encyclopedia=[[New Georgia Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Georgia Humanities Council and University of Georgia Press|year=2002|accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref> Talmadge was motivated by his belief that Cocking favored racial integration. The governor's interference in the workings of USG's Board of Regents prompted a response by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools|Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools]], which stripped UGA and nine other schools in the system of their accreditation. The issue became a major point of contention in Talmadge's 1942 re-election campaign. After his loss, a constitutional amendment passed by the state legislature gave the Board of Regents independence from political interference, which led to the schools quickly regaining their accreditation.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nAs the United States entered [[World War II]], enrollment among male students dropped significantly, allowing female students to outnumber male students for the first time in the school's history. In 1945, UGA accepted a donation of about 100 paintings from the New York art collector Alfred Holbrook and created the [[Georgia Museum of Art]]. In 1946, the [[University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine|School of Veterinary Medicine]] was re-established as a separate school, 13 years after it was discontinued as part of the agricultural college.<ref name=\":11\" /> The following year, the quarterly literary journal ''[[The Georgia Review]]'' began publication.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":12\" /> After [[Jonathan Clark Rogers|Jonathan Rogers]]' brief tenure as president (1949\u20131950),<ref name=\":8\" /> [[Omer Clyde Aderhold]] started his 17-year-long stint as UGA president. During his tenure, the university sold Coordinate Campus to the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]. He opened the school's main library, the Ilah Dunlap-Little Memorial Library, in 1952, and in 1964, established the [[University of Georgia School of Social Work|School of Social Work]].<ref name=\":11\" /> The university also built a new Science Center on South Campus consisting of six buildings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|pp=13\u201314}}</ref> After UGA's pharmacy school moved to the new facility on the South Campus, the two portions of the campus took on distinct characteristics, with North Campus focused on arts, humanities, and law, and South Campus focused on natural sciences and agricultural programs.<ref name=\":13\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=14}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Holmes-Hunter Academic Building (3), UGA.JPG|275px|thumb|left|Entrance to the Holmes-Hunter Academic Building]]\nUGA was racially integrated in 1961, with the admission of [[Hamilton E.

On January 9, 1961, three days after a court decision granting them admission, Holmes and Hunter \"walked through the Arch and into the Academic Building\" to register for classes. On the 40th anniversary of the event, the university renamed the very same prominent campus building where they registered as the Holmes-Hunter Academic Building, and the university now presents the Holmes-Hunter Lectures series, which brings noted African-American speakers to the campus each year to discuss racial issues.<ref name=\"jqstQ\">{{cite web|last1=Van Gelder|first1=Lawrence|title=Hamilton E.

The building is named after its original owner, [[Wilson Lumpkin]], the former Georgia congressman, governor, and U.S. Senator who designed and built the house as his retirement home. The building and the land surrounding it, on which the neighboring Connor Hall was built in 1908, was sold to the university by Lumpkin's youngest daughter who stipulated that ownership of the property would revert to her heirs if the university ever moved or destroyed the house. The house, used by the College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences (CAES), \"probably still stands only because of [this] odd clause\" which the university continues to honor. In 1970, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=101}}</ref> The second-oldest building, named after the state legislator James J. Conner, sits on one of the highest points in Athens. Built in the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival style]], Conner Hall also serves the CAES. In 1975, it underwent an interior renovation that left the exterior features unchanged. Barrow Hall, built in 1911, is the third-oldest building in South Campus and serves a variety of academic programs. Originally known as the Farm Mechanics Building, the building was renamed after Chancellor David C. Barrow, during whose tenure it was constructed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=103}}</ref>\n\nHome to the College of Family and Consumer Sciences, Dawson Hall was built in 1932 to house the university's growing home economics department, then part of the College of Agriculture. The building is named after William Terrell Dawson, a Georgian physician and grandson of the namesake to Terrell Hall. In his will, Dawson donated $150,000 for the creation of a trust to benefit agricultural education at UGA. In 1971, the school added an annex to Dawson Hall and later renamed it after Mary Spiers who was dean of the School of Home Economics from 1954 to 1971.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=92}}</ref> The College of Family and Consumer Sciences also has five other buildings, built in 1939 and 1940, known collectively as the McPhaul Center.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|pp=96\u201397}}</ref>\n\nOn the curved hill between Dawson Hall and Sanford Stadium, a plan envisioned in 1953, proposed the construction of a Science Center to house the university's various scientific programs.

Georgia students and alumni declared yellow an unfit color for the [[Georgia Bulldogs]], deeming it a cowardly color. After the [[Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate#Establishment|1893 football game against Georgia Tech]], University of Georgia President, Dr. [[Charles Herty]], removed old gold as an official school color. [[Crimson]] (also referred to as \"Good Old Georgia Red\") and black have been the official colors ever since.<ref>{{cite web|title=Origins of SEC School Colors|url=http://www.secsportsfan.com/origins-of-sec-school-colors.html|publisher=SEC Sports Fan|accessdate=February 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe decision to include crimson red is also thought to be a tribute to the state of Georgia and a reminder of the University's flagship status. [[Kaolinite]], commonly referred to as \"Georgia red clay\" is commonly found throughout the state, especially in the [[Red Hills Region]]. The red color that is so evident in Georgia soils is due primarily to [[iron oxides]].\n\n=== The mascot ===\n[[File:UGA the University of Georgia mascot.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Uga (mascot)|Uga VI]], the official live mascot of the Georgia Bulldogs 1999\u20132008]]\nThe origin of the [[English Bulldog]] representing UGA came from [[Yale University]], with whom UGA had strong ties in its early years.

The Bulldogs were thought to be a tribute to Baldwin's alma mater. The term \"Georgia Bulldogs\" was first coined on November 3, 1920 by ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' writer Morgan Blake. After a 0\u20130 tie with the [[University of Virginia]] in Charlottesville on November 6, 1920, Atlanta Constitution writer Cliff Wheatley used the name \"Bulldogs\" in his story five times.

The current line began with Uga I, a solid white English Bulldog who was the grandson of a former Georgia mascot who made the trip to the 1943 [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]]. Perhaps the most famous Uga was Uga V who made appearances in the movie ''[[Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil]].'' Uga V was also featured on the cover of the April 1997 edition of [[Sports Illustrated]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sports Illustrated cover page|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/cover/toc/9584/index.htm|publisher=SportsIllustrated|accessdate=February 9, 2013}}</ref> Uga X became the mascot in 2015.\n\nThe University of Georgia is the only major college that buries its mascots within the confines of its stadium.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Ugas I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII are buried in marble vaults near the main gate in the embankment of the south stands of Sanford Stadium.

The Chapel Bell is located on the historic North Campus. Built in 1832, when [[Protestantism|Protestant orthodoxy]] dominated the campus region, the Chapel was a center of campus activities. A daily religious service, which students were required to attend, were held there, as were assemblies and [[Commencement speech|commencements]]. The bell was also rung to mark the beginning and the end of class.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Chapel|url=http://chapel.myweb.uga.edu/history.html|publisher=University of Georgia|accessdate=February 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821212705/http://chapel.myweb.uga.edu/history.html|archive-date=August 21, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, the Chapel Bell has served as an athletic tradition at the University of Georgia. The ringing of the Chapel Bell after a Georgia victory is a tradition that has endured since the 1890s. In Georgia football's early days, [[Herty Field]] was located only yards from the chapel, and first-year students were compelled to ring the bell until midnight in celebration of a Bulldog victory. Today, students, alumni, fans and townspeople still rush to the Chapel to ring the bell after a victory.<ref name=\"Georgia Traditions\" /> The bell is also utilized for University meetings and events, weddings and remembrance ringing. The bell was rung in memory of victims of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. After the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, the University of Georgia partook in a nationwide mourning by ringing the Chapel Bell in honor of the victims of the shooting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bells will ring in Athens, across U.S., for Conn. shooting victims|url=http://onlineathens.com/uga/2012-12-19/bells-will-ring-athens-across-us-conn-shooting-victims|publisher=OnlineAthens|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn October 27, 2007, as tradition warrants, Georgia fans rang the Chapel Bell to celebrate the 42\u201330 win over the university's archrival, the [[Florida Gators]]. The excitement caused the yoke holding the 877&nbsp;lb. bell to give way, and it fell from the support platform. The university has returned the bell to its historic post and {{as of|2017|November|lc=y}}, it still rings daily across campus.\n\n=== Founders Week ===\n\nJanuary 27, 1785, is the date the University of Georgia became the first public university to have a charter granted. Each year, January 27 is commemorated to honor UGA's place in the [[History of education in the United States|history of American colleges and universities]]. The tradition began in 2002 and is now celebrated as Founders Week. During Founders Week, a series of celebrations are hosted by various campus departments including the Student Alumni Association and the Student Government Association.\n\nThe [[Emeriti]] Scholars, a group of retired faculty members especially known for their teaching abilities and continued involvement in the university's academic life, sponsor the Founders Day Lecture. The lecture is held in the UGA Chapel and has become a Founders Day tradition, drawing alumni, students, faculty, esteemed guests and members of the community.\n\n=== The Arch ===\n[[File:ArchUGA2.jpg|175px|thumb|left|180px|The Arch at the University of Georgia]]\n\nIn 1857, the University of Georgia constructed a cast iron representation of the architectural elements featured on the obverse of the Great Seal of the state of Georgia. It stands at the north entrance of the campus, and has become known as The Arch. Fashioned from existing material, The Arch is a representation but not an exact replica of the architectural elements of the Seal. Originally serving both symbolic and practical functions, it was connected to a barrier which kept cows from roaming over parts of the campus, and was initially known as The Gate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uga.edu/profile/arch/|title=The Arch|publisher=}}</ref> It serves as the official icon and a historic landmark for the university. Since the 1900s, tradition has held that students may not pass beneath the Arch until they have received a [[diploma]] from the University of Georgia. Those who walked under the Arch prior to [[Commencement ceremony|graduation commencement]] were said never to graduate. The tradition began when Daniel Huntley Redfearn, Class of 1910, arrived as a freshman from [[Boston, Georgia]] and vowed not to pass beneath the Arch until he had graduated. One of Redfearn's professors heard the vow and repeated it to his class, and the tradition has stood ever since. Many freshmen, learning of the tradition during orientation or from other sources still choose to honor the century-old tradition. Years of following the tradition are visible on the concrete steps leading to the Arch. Steps to each side have been worn down over the years as undergraduates have kept their vows.<ref>https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/the-arch-tradition-explained/article_9715edda-2ced-11e7-835a-433c10460414.html{{dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\nThe Arch has been a site of historic [[Demonstration (people)|political demonstrations]]. In 1961, when UGA officials [[Desegregation|desegregated]] the university with the admission of its first two [[African-American]] students, [[Hamilton E. Holmes|Hamilton Holmes]] and [[Charlayne Hunter-Gault]]. The Arch was a witness to students protesting both for and against segregation in the protesting the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and a demonstration following the [[Kent State shootings|1970 shootings at Kent State University]]. In 2001, along with the Chapel Bell, the Arch was the site of a memorial to the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\n=== The fight song and \"Alma Mater\" ===\n\"[[Glory, Glory (fight song)|Glory, Glory]]\" is the rally song for the [[Georgia Bulldogs]]. \"Glory, Glory\" is sung to the tune of \"[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]\". It was sung at games as early as the 1890s, but arranged in its present form by musician-composer Hugh Hodgson in 1915. There have been many Bulldog songs through the years and at least two collections dating back to 1909 have been published, but \"Glory, Glory\" has been the most accepted among students and alumni. The only known original reference to the piece is in a history of the Redcoat Band written in 1962, which briefly mentions the march as \"Georgia's first original school song\" and notes that \"all copies of the work have been lost.\" The document is kept in the university's Hargrett Library for rare and historic documents.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glory, glory, old march discovered|url=http://uga.edu/gm/ee/index.php?/single/2008/09/172/|publisher=University of Georgia|accessdate=February 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518141302/http://uga.edu/gm/ee/index.php?%2Fsingle%2F2008%2F09%2F172%2F|archive-date=May 18, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlthough \"Glory, Glory\" is generally thought to be the school's fight song, the official fight song is \"Hail to Georgia\". The fight song is played by the [[Georgia Redcoat Marching Band]] after touchdowns, field goals, and extra points scored by the football team. The Georgia Redcoat Marching Band is a 375-member marching band. First directed in 1905 by R.E. Haughey, the band has only had seven directors.\n\nThe \"Alma Mater\", the official school song of the University of Georgia, is set to the tune of \"[[Annie Lisle]]\", a popular 1857 [[ballad]] by [[H. S. Thompson]]. The lyrics to \"Alma Mater\", penned by J.B. Wright, Jr., and Gail Carter Dendy, are unique to UGA. The song is sung at commencement and various official events of the University of Georgia.<ref>{{cite web|title=HISTORY & TRADITIONS \u2013 SINGING OF THE ALMA MATER|url=https://commencement.uga.edu/history|website=commencement.uga.edu|publisher=uga.edu|accessdate=January 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Playing \"Between the Hedges\" and Sanford Stadium ===\n[[Sanford Stadium]] is the on-campus playing venue for [[American football|football]] at the University of Georgia in Athens. The 92,746-seat stadium is the [[List of NCAA Division I FBS football stadiums|seventh largest stadium]] in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] and has a grass (versus synthetic) field. The stadium is the 8th largest non-racing stadium in the United States and the 14th largest such stadium in the world.

After traveling the state to recruit a few students, Meigs opened the school with no building in the fall of 1801.

In 1872, the $243,000 federal allotment to Georgia was invested to create a $16,000 annual income used to establish the Georgia State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (A&M), initially separate and independent from the University of Georgia. However, A&M's funding was considered part of the university, which helped save it from bankruptcy during the [[Reconstruction era]].<ref name=\":4\" /> As a land-grant school, UGA was required to provide military training, which the university began to offer in the 1870s.<ref name=\":5\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=5}}</ref>\n\nSeveral of the university's extracurricular organizations began in the late 1800s. In 1886, fraternities at UGA began publishing the school's yearbook, the ''Pandora''. The same year, the university gained its first intercollegiate sport when a baseball team was formed, followed by a football team formed in 1892. Both teams played in a small field west of campus now known as [[Herty Field]].

[[Walter Barnard Hill|Walter B. Hill]] became the first UGA alumnus to lead the university. A progressive and enlightened leader, his six-year tenure, before his death from pneumonia, was marked with increased enrollment, expansion of the university's course offerings, and the addition of state funding through appropriation, for the first time bringing the university's annual income to over $100,000 in 1902. Hill and his successors [[David Crenshaw Barrow Jr.|David C. Barrow]] (1906\u20131925), [[Charles Mercer Snelling|Charles Snelling]] (1926\u20131932), and [[Steadman Vincent Sanford|Steadman Sanford]] (1932\u20131935) would grow the school to take on the role of a true university.<ref name=\":5\" /> Many of the university's schools and colleges were established during Barrow's tenure.

Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication|School of Journalism]] (1915), and the [[University of Georgia College of Family and Consumer Sciences|Division of Home Economics]] (1918) were all established during this period. In 1906, UGA also incorporated the [[University of Georgia College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences|College of Agriculture]] by bringing together A&M (agricultural and mechanical) courses. The college of science and engineering continued as formed in the previous century. Connor Hall became the first building built in South Campus and first of several buildings that housed the university's agriculture programs on what came to be known as \"Ag Hill\".

The State Normal School (later State Teachers College) was fully absorbed by the College of Education, with the former's previous campus becoming UGA's Coordinate Campus. UGA and [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] traded several school programs; all engineering programs (except agriculture) were transferred to Georgia Tech and UGA received Georgia Tech's commerce program in return. The title of the university's lead administrator was changed from chancellor back to the original title of president. Sanford was named UGA's first president since 1860<ref name=\":8\" /> and was succeeded by [[Harmon White Caldwell|Harmon Caldwell]] (1935\u20131948). In 1933, the Division of Home Economics was reorganized as the [[University of Georgia College of Family and Consumer Sciences|School of Home of Economics]],<ref name=\":10\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=9}}</ref> with UGA's first female graduate, Creswell, appointed as dean.<ref name=\":9\" /> The university also became a founding member of the [[Southeastern Conference]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FJUIUzD4joAC|title=Games Colleges Play: Scandal and Reform in Intercollegiate Athletics|last=Thelin|first=John R.|date=June 1, 2011|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-1-4214-0391-5|at=Chapter 2|language=en}}</ref> and established the [[University of Georgia Press]] in 1938.<ref name=\":11\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=11}}</ref><ref name=\":12\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=45}}</ref>\n\nThroughout this period, UGA's enrollment grew every year with student population reaching 3,000 by 1937 and almost 4,000 by 1941. Through President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], UGA received a $2 million infusion of funding and an additional $1 million from the state legislature. The university used the new funds to make a number of improvements to the campus from 1936 to the early 1940s. Many renovation projects were undertaken including the establishment of five new residence halls, a dining hall, eight new academic buildings, a nursery school, and several auxiliary facilities. An engineering professor Rudolph Driftmier and architect Roy Hitchcock were responsible for the design of several buildings in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]], giving the campus a homogeneous and distinctive appearance. The funds were also used to pave roads, build sidewalks, and improve the campus's landscaping.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n=== Racial integration and the mid 20th century ===\nThe dean of the College of Education in 1941, [[Walter Cocking]], was fired by Georgia Governor [[Eugene Talmadge]] in a controversial decision known as the [[Cocking affair]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cook|first=James F|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-594|title=Cocking Affair|encyclopedia=[[New Georgia Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Georgia Humanities Council and University of Georgia Press|year=2002|accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref> Talmadge was motivated by his belief that Cocking favored racial integration. The governor's interference in the workings of USG's Board of Regents prompted a response by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools|Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools]], which stripped UGA and nine other schools in the system of their accreditation. The issue became a major point of contention in Talmadge's 1942 re-election campaign. After his loss, a constitutional amendment passed by the state legislature gave the Board of Regents independence from political interference, which led to the schools quickly regaining their accreditation.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nAs the United States entered [[World War II]], enrollment among male students dropped significantly, allowing female students to outnumber male students for the first time in the school's history. In 1945, UGA accepted a donation of about 100 paintings from the New York art collector Alfred Holbrook and created the [[Georgia Museum of Art]]. In 1946, the [[University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine|School of Veterinary Medicine]] was re-established as a separate school, 13 years after it was discontinued as part of the agricultural college.<ref name=\":11\" /> The following year, the quarterly literary journal ''[[The Georgia Review]]'' began publication.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":12\" /> After [[Jonathan Clark Rogers|Jonathan Rogers]]' brief tenure as president (1949\u20131950),<ref name=\":8\" /> [[Omer Clyde Aderhold]] started his 17-year-long stint as UGA president. During his tenure, the university sold Coordinate Campus to the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]. He opened the school's main library, the Ilah Dunlap-Little Memorial Library, in 1952, and in 1964, established the [[University of Georgia School of Social Work|School of Social Work]].<ref name=\":11\" /> The university also built a new Science Center on South Campus consisting of six buildings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|pp=13\u201314}}</ref> After UGA's pharmacy school moved to the new facility on the South Campus, the two portions of the campus took on distinct characteristics, with North Campus focused on arts, humanities, and law, and South Campus focused on natural sciences and agricultural programs.<ref name=\":13\">{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=14}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Holmes-Hunter Academic Building (3), UGA.JPG|275px|thumb|left|Entrance to the Holmes-Hunter Academic Building]]\nUGA was racially integrated in 1961, with the admission of [[Hamilton E.

On January 9, 1961, three days after a court decision granting them admission, Holmes and Hunter \"walked through the Arch and into the Academic Building\" to register for classes. On the 40th anniversary of the event, the university renamed the very same prominent campus building where they registered as the Holmes-Hunter Academic Building, and the university now presents the Holmes-Hunter Lectures series, which brings noted African-American speakers to the campus each year to discuss racial issues.<ref name=\"jqstQ\">{{cite web|last1=Van Gelder|first1=Lawrence|title=Hamilton E.

The building is named after its original owner, [[Wilson Lumpkin]], the former Georgia congressman, governor, and U.S. Senator who designed and built the house as his retirement home. The building and the land surrounding it, on which the neighboring Connor Hall was built in 1908, was sold to the university by Lumpkin's youngest daughter who stipulated that ownership of the property would revert to her heirs if the university ever moved or destroyed the house. The house, used by the College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences (CAES), \"probably still stands only because of [this] odd clause\" which the university continues to honor. In 1970, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=101}}</ref> The second-oldest building, named after the state legislator James J. Conner, sits on one of the highest points in Athens. Built in the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival style]], Conner Hall also serves the CAES. In 1975, it underwent an interior renovation that left the exterior features unchanged. Barrow Hall, built in 1911, is the third-oldest building in South Campus and serves a variety of academic programs. Originally known as the Farm Mechanics Building, the building was renamed after Chancellor David C. Barrow, during whose tenure it was constructed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=103}}</ref>\n\nHome to the College of Family and Consumer Sciences, Dawson Hall was built in 1932 to house the university's growing home economics department, then part of the College of Agriculture. The building is named after William Terrell Dawson, a Georgian physician and grandson of the namesake to Terrell Hall. In his will, Dawson donated $150,000 for the creation of a trust to benefit agricultural education at UGA. In 1971, the school added an annex to Dawson Hall and later renamed it after Mary Spiers who was dean of the School of Home Economics from 1954 to 1971.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|p=92}}</ref> The College of Family and Consumer Sciences also has five other buildings, built in 1939 and 1940, known collectively as the McPhaul Center.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dendy|2013|pp=96\u201397}}</ref>\n\nOn the curved hill between Dawson Hall and Sanford Stadium, a plan envisioned in 1953, proposed the construction of a Science Center to house the university's various scientific programs.

After the [[Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate#Establishment|1893 football game against Georgia Tech]], University of Georgia President, Dr. [[Charles Herty]], removed old gold as an official school color.

After a 0\u20130 tie with the [[University of Virginia]] in Charlottesville on November 6, 1920, Atlanta Constitution writer Cliff Wheatley used the name \"Bulldogs\" in his story five times.

The Chapel Bell is located on the historic North Campus. Built in 1832, when [[Protestantism|Protestant orthodoxy]] dominated the campus region, the Chapel was a center of campus activities. A daily religious service, which students were required to attend, were held there, as were assemblies and [[Commencement speech|commencements]]. The bell was also rung to mark the beginning and the end of class.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Chapel|url=http://chapel.myweb.uga.edu/history.html|publisher=University of Georgia|accessdate=February 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821212705/http://chapel.myweb.uga.edu/history.html|archive-date=August 21, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, the Chapel Bell has served as an athletic tradition at the University of Georgia. The ringing of the Chapel Bell after a Georgia victory is a tradition that has endured since the 1890s. In Georgia football's early days, [[Herty Field]] was located only yards from the chapel, and first-year students were compelled to ring the bell until midnight in celebration of a Bulldog victory. Today, students, alumni, fans and townspeople still rush to the Chapel to ring the bell after a victory.<ref name=\"Georgia Traditions\" /> The bell is also utilized for University meetings and events, weddings and remembrance ringing. The bell was rung in memory of victims of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. After the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, the University of Georgia partook in a nationwide mourning by ringing the Chapel Bell in honor of the victims of the shooting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bells will ring in Athens, across U.S., for Conn. shooting victims|url=http://onlineathens.com/uga/2012-12-19/bells-will-ring-athens-across-us-conn-shooting-victims|publisher=OnlineAthens|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn October 27, 2007, as tradition warrants, Georgia fans rang the Chapel Bell to celebrate the 42\u201330 win over the university's archrival, the [[Florida Gators]]. The excitement caused the yoke holding the 877&nbsp;lb. bell to give way, and it fell from the support platform. The university has returned the bell to its historic post and {{as of|2017|November|lc=y}}, it still rings daily across campus.\n\n=== Founders Week ===\n\nJanuary 27, 1785, is the date the University of Georgia became the first public university to have a charter granted. Each year, January 27 is commemorated to honor UGA's place in the [[History of education in the United States|history of American colleges and universities]]. The tradition began in 2002 and is now celebrated as Founders Week. During Founders Week, a series of celebrations are hosted by various campus departments including the Student Alumni Association and the Student Government Association.\n\nThe [[Emeriti]] Scholars, a group of retired faculty members especially known for their teaching abilities and continued involvement in the university's academic life, sponsor the Founders Day Lecture. The lecture is held in the UGA Chapel and has become a Founders Day tradition, drawing alumni, students, faculty, esteemed guests and members of the community.\n\n=== The Arch ===\n[[File:ArchUGA2.jpg|175px|thumb|left|180px|The Arch at the University of Georgia]]\n\nIn 1857, the University of Georgia constructed a cast iron representation of the architectural elements featured on the obverse of the Great Seal of the state of Georgia. It stands at the north entrance of the campus, and has become known as The Arch. Fashioned from existing material, The Arch is a representation but not an exact replica of the architectural elements of the Seal. Originally serving both symbolic and practical functions, it was connected to a barrier which kept cows from roaming over parts of the campus, and was initially known as The Gate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uga.edu/profile/arch/|title=The Arch|publisher=}}</ref> It serves as the official icon and a historic landmark for the university. Since the 1900s, tradition has held that students may not pass beneath the Arch until they have received a [[diploma]] from the University of Georgia. Those who walked under the Arch prior to [[Commencement ceremony|graduation commencement]] were said never to graduate. The tradition began when Daniel Huntley Redfearn, Class of 1910, arrived as a freshman from [[Boston, Georgia]] and vowed not to pass beneath the Arch until he had graduated. One of Redfearn's professors heard the vow and repeated it to his class, and the tradition has stood ever since. Many freshmen, learning of the tradition during orientation or from other sources still choose to honor the century-old tradition. Years of following the tradition are visible on the concrete steps leading to the Arch. Steps to each side have been worn down over the years as undergraduates have kept their vows.<ref>https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/the-arch-tradition-explained/article_9715edda-2ced-11e7-835a-433c10460414.html{{dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\nThe Arch has been a site of historic [[Demonstration (people)|political demonstrations]]. In 1961, when UGA officials [[Desegregation|desegregated]] the university with the admission of its first two [[African-American]] students, [[Hamilton E. Holmes|Hamilton Holmes]] and [[Charlayne Hunter-Gault]]. The Arch was a witness to students protesting both for and against segregation in the protesting the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and a demonstration following the [[Kent State shootings|1970 shootings at Kent State University]]. In 2001, along with the Chapel Bell, the Arch was the site of a memorial to the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\n=== The fight song and \"Alma Mater\" ===\n\"[[Glory, Glory (fight song)|Glory, Glory]]\" is the rally song for the [[Georgia Bulldogs]]. \"Glory, Glory\" is sung to the tune of \"[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]\". It was sung at games as early as the 1890s, but arranged in its present form by musician-composer Hugh Hodgson in 1915. There have been many Bulldog songs through the years and at least two collections dating back to 1909 have been published, but \"Glory, Glory\" has been the most accepted among students and alumni. The only known original reference to the piece is in a history of the Redcoat Band written in 1962, which briefly mentions the march as \"Georgia's first original school song\" and notes that \"all copies of the work have been lost.\" The document is kept in the university's Hargrett Library for rare and historic documents.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glory, glory, old march discovered|url=http://uga.edu/gm/ee/index.php?/single/2008/09/172/|publisher=University of Georgia|accessdate=February 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518141302/http://uga.edu/gm/ee/index.php?%2Fsingle%2F2008%2F09%2F172%2F|archive-date=May 18, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlthough \"Glory, Glory\" is generally thought to be the school's fight song, the official fight song is \"Hail to Georgia\". The fight song is played by the [[Georgia Redcoat Marching Band]] after touchdowns, field goals, and extra points scored by the football team. The Georgia Redcoat Marching Band is a 375-member marching band. First directed in 1905 by R.E. Haughey, the band has only had seven directors.\n\nThe \"Alma Mater\", the official school song of the University of Georgia, is set to the tune of \"[[Annie Lisle]]\", a popular 1857 [[ballad]] by [[H. S. Thompson]]. The lyrics to \"Alma Mater\", penned by J.B. Wright, Jr., and Gail Carter Dendy, are unique to UGA. The song is sung at commencement and various official events of the University of Georgia.<ref>{{cite web|title=HISTORY & TRADITIONS \u2013 SINGING OF THE ALMA MATER|url=https://commencement.uga.edu/history|website=commencement.uga.edu|publisher=uga.edu|accessdate=January 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Playing \"Between the Hedges\" and Sanford Stadium ===\n[[Sanford Stadium]] is the on-campus playing venue for [[American football|football]] at the University of Georgia in Athens. The 92,746-seat stadium is the [[List of NCAA Division I FBS football stadiums|seventh largest stadium]] in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] and has a grass (versus synthetic) field.

The famous Chinese privet hedges that surround Sanford's playing field were only one foot high when the stadium was dedicated in 1929 and were protected by a wooden fence. Sports writers, referring to an upcoming home game, were said to observe \"that the Bulldogs will have their opponent \"between the hedges.\" The phrase was coined by the Atlanta sportswriter [[Grantland Rice]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Georgia Traditions|url=http://www.georgiadogs.com/ot/geo-traditions.html|publisher=Georgia Dogs|accessdate=December 2, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118124224/http://www.georgiadogs.com/ot/geo-traditions.html|archivedate=January 18, 2013}}</ref> Games played there are said to be played \"Between the Hedges\" due to the [[privet]] hedges, which had stood around the field since 1929, but removed in the summer of 1996 so that soccer could be played for the 1996 Summer Olympics; new, albeit considerably shorter, hedges were restored in the fall of 1996.
