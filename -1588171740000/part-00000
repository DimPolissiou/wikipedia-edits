The applicants, all of whom were given anonymity, complained that part of the [[Damage|compensation]] they received because of the contamination was not being afforded an annual reassessment according to the [[inflation rate]]. Following transfusions or the administration of blood derivatives, the applicants were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and/or hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C. Forty of the applicants or their relatives suffered from [[haemophilia]], a condition which requires frequent infusions of [[blood products]]. The other applicants were infected through blood [[transfusions]] carried out during the course of hospital treatment.\n\nThe compensation was to include a supplementary indemnity, in Italian ''\u2033indennit\u00e0 integrativa speciale\u2033'', abbreviated to \u2033IIS\u2033. This indemnity component (IIS) was to be subject to reassessment based on the annual rate of inflation and was intended to prevent or reduce the effects of currency devaluation. However, the Italian government made interventions as to the re-assessment of this supplementary allowance (the IIS) as they believed that it was not possible to uprate the amount in line with inflation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://def.finanze.it/DocTribFrontend/executePrintArticolo.do?id={147A06D6-9990-42F4-ADF0-C57A278A9C82}&codiceOrdinamento=200001100000000&articolo=Articolo%2011 |title=Decreto-legge del 31/05/2010 n. 78 (Articolo 11) |last= |first= |date=31 May 2010 |website= |publisher=Dipartimento delle Finanze |at=[13] |language=Italian |format= pdf|access-date=2020-04-29 |quote=''Il comma 2 dell\u2032articolo 2 della legge 25 febbraio 1992, n. 210 e successive modificazioni si interpreta nel senso che la somma corrispondente all\u2032importo dell\u2032indennita\u2032 integrativa speciale non e\u2032 rivalutata secondo il tasso d\u2032inflazione...''}}</ref> In the absence of the annual revaluation, the monetary value of the IIS was fated to gradually decrease.

The infection with contaminated blood and blood products had led to some suffering liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, or a combination of several pathologies, in some, AIDS and hepatitis.  In some cases this was often accompanied by the underlying condition of haemophilia. One applicant suffered from a nervous breakdown leading to several suicide attempts.\n\nFrom the point the case application had been communicated to the Italian government, six applicants unfortunately died. Their heirs were then established in the Court proceedings.\n\nThe applicants provided medical certificates and expert medical reports showing the reduced life expectancy of people infected with the hepatitis virus and HIV.  The expert evidence made out a strict link between the applicant\u2019s prognosis of survival and the beneficial effect of the compensation allowances in question. \n\nThe Court considered that they were obligated to take the pathologies of the applicants into account. In particular, how six of them had died during the proceedings. The judges also attached particular importance to the fact that the annual reassessment (the IIS) represented more than 90% of the total amount of the compensation paid to the applicants.\n\n==Relevant law==\nUnder Law No. 210/1992, the applicants received compensation from the Italian Ministry of Health for the permanent damage they suffered as a result of their contamination.\n\nLaw No. 210/1992 stated that additional compensation, ''\u2033indennizzo ulteriore\u2033'', is to be granted to persons who have suffered damage as a result of compulsory vaccinations and that this additional compensation should be subject to an annual reassessment based on the rate of inflation.\n\nThe applicant's arguments relied on various articles and protocols of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] as follows: Article 6 section 1, Article 13, Article 14, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 12.<ref>{{cite court|litigants= Affaire M.

[[Karachi]].</ref>\n\nIslamic tradition discusses elaborately, almost in graphic detail, as what happens before, during, and after the death, although what exactly happens is not clear and different [[Islamic schools and branches|schools of thought]] may end up with different conclusions. However, a continuity between all these ideas derived from the basic sources from the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith|Islamic narratives]]. One canonical idea is, that the [[Azrael#In Islam|angel of death]] ([[Arabic]]: ''Malak al-Maut'') appears to the dying to take out their souls. The sinners' souls are extracted in the most painful way while the righteous are treated easily\n\nAnother common idea, although appearing relatively late in Islamic traditions,<ref>Stephen Burge Angels in Islam: Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti's al-Haba'ik fi akhbar al-mala'ik Routledge 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-136-50473-0}} p. 89</ref> adds that, after the burial, two angels \u2013 [[Munkar and Nakir]] \u2013 come to question the dead in order to test their faith. The righteous believers answer correctly and live in peace and comfort while the sinners and disbelievers fail and punishments ensue.

Death is inevitable. No matter how much people try to escape death, it will reach everyone ({{cite quran|50|19|s=ns|b=n}}). Again, those who deny resurrection and [[Akhirah|afterlife]], and thus challenge God, the Quran challenges them by saying that why these people then do not put back the soul which has reached the throat (of the dying person) and is about to escape the body? ({{cite quran|56|83\u201384|s=ns|b=n}}). It also says that when death approaches the sinners and disbelievers, and they sense the upcoming chastisement, they pray to God to go back to [[life]] to do some good deeds; but this will never be granted ({{cite quran|23|99\u2013100|s=ns|b=n}}). Probably the most-frequently quoted verse of the Quran about death is: \"Every soul shall taste death, and only on the Day of Judgment will you be paid your full recompense.\" At another place, the Quran urges mankind: \"And die not except in a state of Islam\" ({{cite quran|3|102|s=ns|b=n}}) because \"Truly, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam\" ({{cite quran|3|19|s=ns|b=n}}). Other verses related with this issue are: \"He (Allah) who created death and life, so that He may test you as to which of you is better in deeds. And He is the All-Mighty, the Most-Forgiving\" ({{cite quran|67|2|s=ns|b=n}}); \"Certainly, they see it (resurrection) as distant, but We see it as near\" ({{cite quran|70|6\u20137|s=ns|b=n}}).\n\n==Suicide==\n{{See also|Religious views on suicide#Islam}}\nIslam, as with other [[Abrahamic faith|Abrahamic religions]], views [[suicide]] as one of the greatest sins and utterly detrimental to one's spiritual journey. The Islamic view is that life and death are given by God. Life is sacred, and a gift from God; and it is only God, and not the human beings, who has the right to take it back. This willful taking of one's own life is considered a major sin in Islam.<ref name=Lester-2006/><ref name=Leaman-177/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Juan E.

It is repeatedly referenced in chapters of the Quran concerning the Last Judgment, an important part of Islamic eschatology. Traditionally, it is considered to be one of the six main beliefs of Muslims. According to the Islamic beliefs, God will play the role of the qadi, weighing the deeds of each individual. He will decide whether that person's \u02be\u0101khirah lies in [[Jahannam]] (Hell) or [[Jannah]] (Heaven) on the basis of the weight of either good or bad deeds in comparison with one another.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Islamic eschatology]]\n* [[Islamic funeral]]\n* [[Punishment of the Grave]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Islam and death| ]]\n[fortnite boys\n[[Category:Afttilited towers\n", "text_old": "'''Death in Islam''' is the termination of worldly life and the beginning of [[afterlife]].

Consequently, the soul is then thrown into hell or underworld, where it is punished until the [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgment]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Ashiq Ilahi Bulandshahri |authorlink=Ashiq Ilahi |title=What Happens After Death |url=https://archive.org/details/WhatHappensAfterDeathByShaykhAshiqIlahiMadnir.a |accessdate= |year=1994 |publisher=Adam Publishers & Distributors |location=[[New Delhi]] |isbn= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/WhatHappensAfterDeathByShaykhAshiqIlahiMadnir.a/page/n28 11]\u201312}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, when a [[Mumin|righteous believer]] dies, bright-faced angels from heaven descends with divine perfume and shroud. Then the angels of death comes, and tells the [[Ruh|soul]] to come out to the pleasure and mercy of God. The soul is then extracted as easily as water comes out from the pitcher. The soul is then wrapped in the perfumed shroud and is taken up to the seventh heaven where God declares: 'write down his name in 'Illiyin' and take him back to earth. I created him from earth, and I will raise him second time from this very earth.' The soul is then pushed back into the body and is interrogated by two angels called [[Munkar and Nakir]].

Campo |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&pg=PA186 |title=Death|page=186}}</ref>\n\n==In the Quran==\nThe [[Quran]] at its several places discusses the issue of death. Death is inevitable. No matter how much people try to escape death, it will reach everyone ({{cite quran|50|19|s=ns|b=n}}). Again, those who deny resurrection and [[Akhirah|afterlife]], and thus challenge God, the Quran challenges them by saying that why these people then do not put back the soul which has reached the throat (of the dying person) and is about to escape the body? ({{cite quran|56|83\u201384|s=ns|b=n}}). It also says that when death approaches the sinners and disbelievers, and they sense the upcoming chastisement, they pray to God to go back to [[life]] to do some good deeds; but this will never be granted ({{cite quran|23|99\u2013100|s=ns|b=n}}). Probably the most-frequently quoted verse of the Quran about death is: \"Every soul shall taste death, and only on the Day of Judgment will you be paid your full recompense.\" At another place, the Quran urges mankind: \"And die not except in a state of Islam\" ({{cite quran|3|102|s=ns|b=n}}) because \"Truly, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam\" ({{cite quran|3|19|s=ns|b=n}}). Other verses related with this issue are: \"He (Allah) who created death and life, so that He may test you as to which of you is better in deeds. And He is the All-Mighty, the Most-Forgiving\" ({{cite quran|67|2|s=ns|b=n}}); \"Certainly, they see it (resurrection) as distant, but We see it as near\" ({{cite quran|70|6\u20137|s=ns|b=n}}).\n\n==Suicide==\n{{See also|Religious views on suicide#Islam}}\nIslam, as with other [[Abrahamic faith|Abrahamic religions]], views [[suicide]] as one of the greatest sins and utterly detrimental to one's spiritual journey. The Islamic view is that life and death are given by God. Life is sacred, and a gift from God; and it is only God, and not the human beings, who has the right to take it back. This willful taking of one's own life is considered a major sin in Islam.<ref name=Lester-2006/><ref name=Leaman-177/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Juan E.

Instead, one should say: \"Oh Allah! Let me live as long as life is good for me, and let me die if death is good for me.\"<ref name=Leaman-177/> [[Euthanasia]] is considered one form of suicide and has the same ruling as that of suicide.<ref name=Leaman-177/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Juan E.

[[Karachi]]. Chapter 17, verse 33.</ref>\n\n==Akhirah==\n{{main|Akhirah}}\n\u0100khirah (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631\u0629) is an Islamic term referring to the afterlife. It is repeatedly referenced in chapters of the Quran concerning the Last Judgment, an important part of Islamic eschatology. Traditionally, it is considered to be one of the six main beliefs of Muslims. According to the Islamic beliefs, God will play the role of the qadi, weighing the deeds of each individual. He will decide whether that person's \u02be\u0101khirah lies in [[Jahannam]] (Hell) or [[Jannah]] (Heaven) on the basis of the weight of either good or bad deeds in comparison with one another.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Islamic eschatology]]\n* [[Islamic funeral]]\n* [[Punishment of the Grave]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Islam and death| ]]\n[[Category:Islamic eschatology]]\n[[Category:Afterlife]]\n", "name_user": "86.22.34.171", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReferences)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_view_of_death"}

We shall therefore not be contradicted if we class the Malay race among the Mongoloid nations.

In the [[Caucasian race|CAUCASIAN RACE]], the head is of the most symmetrical shape, almost round; the forehead of moderate extent; the [[Zygomatic bone|cheek-bones]] rather narrow, without any projection, but having a direction downwards from the [[Zygomatic process|malar process]] of the frontal bone; the [[Alveolar ridge|alveolar edge]] well rounded; the front teeth of both jaws placed perpendicularly. The face is of an oval shape, and straight; the features moderately prominent; the forehead arched; nose narrow, and slightly arched, or at least with the bridge somewhat convex; cheek-bones not projecting; mouth small, with the lips slightly turned out, particularly the lower one; chin full and round. The Caucasians are of [[Human skin color|all complexions]], from the [[Hindus|Hindoos]] and [[Arabs]], some of whom are as [[dark skin|black]] as African [[negro]]es, to the [[Danes]] and [[Swedes]], and [[Norsemen]], who are [[light skin|fair]], with [[blond|flaxen hair]] and light [[Eye color#blue|blue eyes]]. In this class are comprised the ancient and modern inhabitants of [[Europe]] (except the [[S\u00e1mi people|Laplanders]] and [[Finns]]), the ancient and modern inhabitants of [[Western Asia]], as far as the [[Ob River|Oby]], the Belurtagh, and the [[Ganges]], such as the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Babylon|Bablyonians]], [[Medes]] and [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Scythians]], [[Parthia]]ns, [[Israelites]], [[Jews]], [[Arabs]], and [[Syrians]], the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], and [[Tatars]] properly so called, the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|tribes of Caucasus]], the [[Armenians]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Afghan (ethnonym)|Afghans]], and [[Hindus|Hindoos]]; the [[North Africans|Africans who live on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea]], and throughout the [[Sahara]], the [[Egyptians]] and [[Copts]], the [[Habesha peoples|Abyssinians]], and the [[Guanches]], or ancient people of the [[Canary Islands]]. To these we need hardly add the [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists who have settled in America]] and other parts of the world. The complexion of this class of people seems to depend very much upon climate and the degree of solar heat to which they are exposed; for they are all, without exception, born with [[light skin|light complexions]], and become dark only as they grow up, and are more [[Sun tanning|exposed to the sun]]. Their colour is found to deepen by regular gradation from the furthest north, where the people of this race are very fair, through the [[Olive (color)|olive-coloured]] people of the [[Southern France|south of France]], and of [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], and the swarthy [[Moors]], till the gradation ends with the [[Black people|deep-black natives]] of the [[African desert|African]] and [[Arabian Desert|Arabian deserts]], and of [[wikt:intertropical|intertropical]] [[India]]. White seems to be the characteristic of the race, but it is everywhere subject to the influence of climate. The Caucasians are therefore properly enough called the [[White people|WHITE RACE]], though some of them are perfectly black. Their hair, whether [[wikt:melanic|melanic]] or [[wikt:xanthous|xanthous]], is always long and lank, and never [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]] like that of the [[negro]]es.</p>\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|II.  &nbsp;&nbsp;The Mongolian Class\n|-\n|<p>II. The MONGOLIAN CLASS has the head almost square; the [[Zygomatic bone|cheek-bones]] projecting; the nose flat; the [[nasal bone]]s and the space between the eyebrows nearly on the same horizontal plane with the cheek-bones; the arches of the eyebrows scarcely to be perceived; the nostrils narrow; the chin slightly prominent. The face is broad and flat, with the parts imperfectly distinguished; the space between the eyes flat and very broad; nose flat; cheeks projecting, round, and narrow; the linear opening of the eyelids extending towards the temples; the [[Epicanthic fold|inner corner]] of the eye sunk towards the nose, and the upper eyelid at that part continued into the lower by a rounded sweep. The complexion is generally [[Olive (color)|olive]], which is sometimes very slight, and approaching to yellow, or what is called [[wikt:sallow|sallow]]; and none of this class are known to be [[light skin|fair-complexioned]]. The iris of their eyes is black; their [[Black hair|hair black]], straight, and strong, but seldom curled, or in great abundance; and they have little or no [[beard]]. In this class are comprised the numerous tribes that occupy the [[Central Asia|central]], [[Northeast Asia|north-east]], [[East Asia|east]] and [[Southeast Asia|south-east parts of Asia]]; the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]]; the [[Tibetan people|people of Tibet]], [[Bhutan|Boutan]], and [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indo-china]]; the [[Finns|Fins]] and the [[S\u00e1mi people|Laplanders]] of the [[Northern Europe|north of Europe]], and the [[Eskimo|Esquimaux]], who live along the shores of the [[Arctic Ocean|Polar Sea]], in [[Americas|America]] and [[Greenland]]. The colour of the class is influenced in a slight degree by climate; those of them, and those parts of the body most [[sun tanning|exposed to the sun]] and the air, being the darkest.<sup>*</sup></p>\n\n<sup>*</sup> Dr. Abel, physician to the last [[List of diplomatic missions of the United Kingdom#Asia|British embassy to China]], mentions in his volume of travels, that when any of the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] boatmen cast off their clothes for the purpose of leaping into the water to push along the boats, they appeared to be dressed in light-coloured trowsers, though quite naked.\n\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|III. &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Negroid|Ethiopic]] or [[Black people|Black Race]]\n|-\n|<p>III.

The face is narrow, with the lower part projecting; eyes prominent; nose spread, and almost confounded with the cheeks; the lips, particularly the upper one, very thick; the jaws prominent, and the chin retracted. The skin of this class, and the iris of the eye, are deep black; the [[Black hair|hair black]] and [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]]; characteristics that vary less in the [[negro]]es than in the two former classes, for this very obvious reason, that the [[Negroid|Ethiopic race]] are to be found native mostly in [[tropical climate]]s, where there is little variety of temperature; and not like the Mongolian and [[Caucasian race]]s who are spread over all climates, from the [[equator]] to the [[Arctic Ocean|Polar Sea]].

The [[Zygomatic bone|cheek-bones]] are prominent, but more arched and rounded than in the [[Mongols|Mongol]], without being so angular, or projecting at the sides; the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbits]] almost always deep; the shape of the forehead and the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] often [[Artificial cranial deformation|artificially modified]]; the skull generally light. The face is broad, without being flat; the features, viewed in profile, are prominent, and deeply marked; the forehead low, eyes deep-seated, nose rather flat, but prominent. The [[redskin|skin is red]], more or less [[dark skin|dark]], or [[Copper (color)|copper-coloured]], and approaching to [[dark skin|black]], according to climate and other circumstances. The hair is like that of the Mongolian class; and they have little or no [[beard]]. In this class are comprehended all the [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|native American tribes and nations]], excepting, of course, the [[Eskimo|Esquimaux]], and the descendants of [[European colonization of the Americas|European]] and [[African diaspora in the Americas|African]] colonists.</p>\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|V. &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Malay race|Malay Class]]\n|-\n|<p>V.

The face is less narrow than that of the [[negro]], somewhat advancing in the lower part, when seen in profile; the features generally more prominent than those of the negro, the nose full, broad, and thick towards the point, or what is called a [[wikt:bottle-nose|bottle-nose]]. The colour of the skin is brown, or [[Tawny (color)|tawny]]; the [[black hair|hair black]], soft, curled, and abundant.

Fine silky hair, usually [[wikt:raven-haired|raven black]], never [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]], but wavy and tolerably long. The [[Aboriginal Australians|Australians]] are [[Cephalic index|doliocephalic]] (long-skulled), the cranial index often not amounting to more than seventy-one or seventy-two. Nose broad rather than flat, jaws heavy, lips very coarse and flexible. ''Norma occipitalis'' sharply [[wikt:pentagonal|pentagonal]]. [[Brow ridge|Brow-ridges]] strong and prominent, teeth large, and [[Incisor|fangs]] strong. These marks are seen in the [[Dasa|Dasyu]] hill-tribes inhabiting the interior of the [[Deccan Plateau|Dekhan]].

The [[Egyptians|Egyptian]], too, though changed by [[Ancient Egypt|civilisation]] and probably [[DNA history of Egypt|admixture]], has also the [[dark skin]], black silky wavy hair, long skull, fleshy lips, and broad [[Ala of nose|''alae'' of the nose]].</p><!--This quote is in the right column of page 585.-->\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|(2)  &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Negroid|Negroid Type]]\n|-\n|<p>(2) The [[Negroid|Negroid type]] is best represented by the [[negro]] of [[South Africa|S. Africa]] (including [[Madagascar]]), between the [[Sahara]] and the region of the [[Cape Peninsula|Cape]]. He is of fair [[Human height|stature]]; his body and limbs are well made; his [[dark skin|skin is black]], with shades of brown; his eyes, [[Brown eye|brown]] or black; his [[black hair|hair is black]], short, and crisp; his [[beard]] and [[body hair|body-hair]] scanty. He is [[cephalic index|doliocephalic]], the cranial index being often only seventy-three. His forehead is [[neoteny in humans|childlike]] and [[Femininity|feminine]]. The ''norma occipitalis'' is often [[wikt:pentagonal|pentagonal]]. Like the [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid]], there is generally [[prognathism]] (protruding jaws). The [[nasal bone]]s are depressed, giving a characteristic flat nose. The lips are coarse and projecting. The [[San people|Bushmen]] of the [[Cape Peninsula|Cape]] area are a special type, marked by low [[Human height|stature]], the males not much exceeding 4 feet in height; both [[sex]]es, however, are well made. The skin is yellowish brown, the eyes and [[black hair|hair black]], the latter [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]]. The [[wikt:anteroposterior|antero-posterior]] [[diameter]] of female [[pelvis]] is of great relative length. The [[steatopygia|accumulation of fat on the buttocks]], and the large [[Labia minora|nymphae]] of females, are also characteristic. [[Hottentot (racial term)|Hottentots]] are said to be a cross between [[San people|Bushmen]] and [[Negro]]es. Another modification, the [[Negrito]]s, occurs in the [[Andaman Islands|Andamans]], [[Malacca]], [[Philippines]], [[Tasmania]], and the islands parallel to the [[Coastline of Australia|Australian coast]], from [[Wallace Line|Wallace's Line]] to [[New Caledonia]]. The [[Andamanese|Andamans]] have a cranial index of eighty; all the rest are doliocephalic, though some in the [[South|S.]] and [[East|E.]] approach the [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid]] in large [[brow ridge|brow-ridges]] and otherwise (''[[exempli gratia|e.g.]]'', [[Tasmania]], [[New Caledonia]], [[New Guinea]], and [[Torres Strait]]s). There is perhaps a cross with [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] in [[New Guinea]]; more probably a cross with [[Polynesians]] in the [[Fiji|Feejees]].</p><!--This quote is in the right column of page 585.-->\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Caucasian race|Xanthochroic Type]]\n|-\n|<p>(3) [[Nordic race|Xanthochroic]], or fair [[white people|whites]], found in the greater part of the population of [[Central Europe]].

In [[physical attractiveness|physical beauty]] and [[intellect]]ual development they often excel the [[Nordic race|Xanthochroi]], but the skin, though transparent, is brown, deepening to [[olive (color)|olive]]; the [[Brown eye|eyes]] and [[black hair|hair are black]], the latter fine and wavy. This type shades off into the [[Nordic race|Xanthochroic]] and the [[Deccan Plateau|Dekhan]] variety of [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid]].</p><!--This quote is in the left column of page 586.-->\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;The Mongoloid Type\n|-\n|<p>(4) The great area [[East|E.]] of a line drawn from [[S\u00e1pmi|Lapland]] to [[Thailand|Siam]] is peopled chiefly by the Mongoloid, who are short, squat, with yellow-brown skin; eyes and [[black hair|hair black]], the latter coarse, straight, long on the scalp, but [[body hair|scanty on the body]] and [[beard|face]]. They are sometimes very [[cephalic index|brachycephalic]], without prominent [[brow ridge|brow-ridges]], nose flat and small, eyes oblique. The [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays proper]] and the [[Filipinos|indigenes of the Philippines]], who are not [[Negrito]]s, probably belong to this group. The [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]], on the other hand, are distinguished chiefly by being [[cephalic index|doliocephalic]]; this characteristic occurs also in the ancient [[Ainu people|Ainos]] (found, for example, in [[Hokkaido|Yesso]]), who are further remarkable for the development of [[beard|hair on face]] and [[body hair|body]], and the dull-red earthy skin. The [[Dayak people|Dyaks]] of [[Borneo]], the [[Batak|Battaks]] of [[Sumatra]], the [[Alfur people|Alfures]] of [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], are all [[cephalic index|doliocephalic]], and seem to pass through the people of the [[Palau|Pelew Islands]] and of the [[Caroline Islands|Caroline]] and [[Mariana Islands|Ladrone]] [[Archipelago]]s into the [[Polynesians]], in whom the straight hair and oblique eye have disappeared, the skull being long and coming back to the [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid type]]. The [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] type is best seen in the [[M\u0101ori people|Maoris]] of [[New Zealand]]; [[cephalic index|brachycephaly]] occurs in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich]] and [[Samoan Islands]]. [[Polynesian languages|Language]] shows that [[Polynesia]] was peopled from the west, and it is thought that the [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] type may be a cross between the [[Dayak people|Dyak]]-[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and the [[Negrito]] elements in [[Indonesia|Indo-nesia]]. In [[Northeast Asia|N.E. Asia]] the [[Chukchi people|Tchuktchi]] are said to be the same as the [[Eskimo]]s and [[Greenlandic Inuit|Greenlanders]] of [[North America|N. America]]; with Mongoloid hair and skin they have very long skulls. [[cephalic index|Doliocephaly]] also distinguishes the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|aborigines of both Americas]] from the [[Asian people|Asiatic]] Mongoloid; only the [[Tehuelche people|Patagonians]] and the ancient [[Mound Builders|mound-builders]] are [[cephalic index|brachycephalic]].

Of these the [[Negroid|Ethiopian]] is secondarily divided into the African [[Negro]]es, the [[Hottentot (racial term)|Hottentots]] and [[San people|Bushmen]], the [[wikt:oceanic|Oceanic]] [[Negro]]es or [[Melanesians]], and the [[Negrito]]s as represented by the inhabitants of the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and other [[list of islands in the Pacific Ocean|Pacific islands]]. The [[Aboriginal Australians|Australians]], whom [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] takes as the type of a separate race, he considers to be a mixed people, as they combine the [[Negro]] type of face and skeleton, with hair of a different type. His second race is the Mongolian, represented in an exaggerated form by the [[Eskimo]], in its typical condition by most of the natives of [[North Asia|northern]] and [[East Asia|eastern Asia]], and in a modified type by the [[Malay race|Malays]]. Excluding the [[Eskimo]], the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Americans]] form one group, whose closest affinity is with the Mongolian, yet which has so many special features that it might be viewed as a fourth primary division. His third or [[Caucasian race]] includes two [[wikt:subrace|sub-races]], \u2014 the [[Nordic race|Xanthochroic]] and [[Mediterranean race|Melanochroic]] of [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]].

The [[brow ridge]]s with their cold-vulnerable [[frontal sinus|sinuses]] are reduced; the [[Zygomatic bone|malars]] are extended forward and enlarged hence the external nose protrusion is reduced; the eye is protected by fatty lids whose borders are brought closer together, which in turn helps reduce the glare of light. The distended malars and [[maxillary sinus]]es are also protected by fatty pads, which helps to give the typical mongoloid face its flat appearance. In addition Mongoloids have sparse [[beard]]s, which may be an advantage because exhaled breath, in cold regions at any rate, can freeze the beard and underlying skin.<!--This quote is the 3rd paragraph of page 205.-->|author=Rupert I.

Typically, the nose is not very prominent on the face of a Mongoloid. Their frontal sinus is also reduced in order to allow more room for padding to protect from their cold environment.

We shall therefore not be contradicted if we class the Malay race among the Mongoloid nations.

In the [[Caucasian race|CAUCASIAN RACE]], the head is of the most symmetrical shape, almost round; the forehead of moderate extent; the [[Zygomatic bone|cheek-bones]] rather narrow, without any projection, but having a direction downwards from the [[Zygomatic process|malar process]] of the frontal bone; the [[Alveolar ridge|alveolar edge]] well rounded; the front teeth of both jaws placed perpendicularly. The face is of an oval shape, and straight; the features moderately prominent; the forehead arched; nose narrow, and slightly arched, or at least with the bridge somewhat convex; cheek-bones not projecting; mouth small, with the lips slightly turned out, particularly the lower one; chin full and round. The Caucasians are of [[Human skin color|all complexions]], from the [[Hindus|Hindoos]] and [[Arabs]], some of whom are as [[dark skin|black]] as African [[negro]]es, to the [[Danes]] and [[Swedes]], and [[Norsemen]], who are [[light skin|fair]], with [[blond|flaxen hair]] and light [[Eye color#blue|blue eyes]]. In this class are comprised the ancient and modern inhabitants of [[Europe]] (except the [[S\u00e1mi people|Laplanders]] and [[Finns]]), the ancient and modern inhabitants of [[Western Asia]], as far as the [[Ob River|Oby]], the Belurtagh, and the [[Ganges]], such as the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Babylon|Bablyonians]], [[Medes]] and [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Scythians]], [[Parthia]]ns, [[Israelites]], [[Jews]], [[Arabs]], and [[Syrians]], the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], and [[Tatars]] properly so called, the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|tribes of Caucasus]], the [[Armenians]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Afghan (ethnonym)|Afghans]], and [[Hindus|Hindoos]]; the [[North Africans|Africans who live on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea]], and throughout the [[Sahara]], the [[Egyptians]] and [[Copts]], the [[Habesha peoples|Abyssinians]], and the [[Guanches]], or ancient people of the [[Canary Islands]]. To these we need hardly add the [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists who have settled in America]] and other parts of the world. The complexion of this class of people seems to depend very much upon climate and the degree of solar heat to which they are exposed; for they are all, without exception, born with [[light skin|light complexions]], and become dark only as they grow up, and are more [[Sun tanning|exposed to the sun]]. Their colour is found to deepen by regular gradation from the furthest north, where the people of this race are very fair, through the [[Olive (color)|olive-coloured]] people of the [[Southern France|south of France]], and of [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], and the swarthy [[Moors]], till the gradation ends with the [[Black people|deep-black natives]] of the [[African desert|African]] and [[Arabian Desert|Arabian deserts]], and of [[wikt:intertropical|intertropical]] [[India]]. White seems to be the characteristic of the race, but it is everywhere subject to the influence of climate. The Caucasians are therefore properly enough called the [[White people|WHITE RACE]], though some of them are perfectly black. Their hair, whether [[wikt:melanic|melanic]] or [[wikt:xanthous|xanthous]], is always long and lank, and never [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]] like that of the [[negro]]es.</p>\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|II.  &nbsp;&nbsp;The Mongolian Class\n|-\n|<p>II. The MONGOLIAN CLASS has the head almost square; the [[Zygomatic bone|cheek-bones]] projecting; the nose flat; the [[nasal bone]]s and the space between the eyebrows nearly on the same horizontal plane with the cheek-bones; the arches of the eyebrows scarcely to be perceived; the nostrils narrow; the chin slightly prominent. The face is broad and flat, with the parts imperfectly distinguished; the space between the eyes flat and very broad; nose flat; cheeks projecting, round, and narrow; the linear opening of the eyelids extending towards the temples; the [[Epicanthic fold|inner corner]] of the eye sunk towards the nose, and the upper eyelid at that part continued into the lower by a rounded sweep. The complexion is generally [[Olive (color)|olive]], which is sometimes very slight, and approaching to yellow, or what is called [[wikt:sallow|sallow]]; and none of this class are known to be [[light skin|fair-complexioned]]. The iris of their eyes is black; their [[Black hair|hair black]], straight, and strong, but seldom curled, or in great abundance; and they have little or no [[beard]]. In this class are comprised the numerous tribes that occupy the [[Central Asia|central]], [[Northeast Asia|north-east]], [[East Asia|east]] and [[Southeast Asia|south-east parts of Asia]]; the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]]; the [[Tibetan people|people of Tibet]], [[Bhutan|Boutan]], and [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indo-china]]; the [[Finns|Fins]] and the [[S\u00e1mi people|Laplanders]] of the [[Northern Europe|north of Europe]], and the [[Eskimo|Esquimaux]], who live along the shores of the [[Arctic Ocean|Polar Sea]], in [[Americas|America]] and [[Greenland]]. The colour of the class is influenced in a slight degree by climate; those of them, and those parts of the body most [[sun tanning|exposed to the sun]] and the air, being the darkest.<sup>*</sup></p>\n\n<sup>*</sup> Dr. Abel, physician to the last [[List of diplomatic missions of the United Kingdom#Asia|British embassy to China]], mentions in his volume of travels, that when any of the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] boatmen cast off their clothes for the purpose of leaping into the water to push along the boats, they appeared to be dressed in light-coloured trowsers, though quite naked.\n\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|III. &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Negroid|Ethiopic]] or [[Black people|Black Race]]\n|-\n|<p>III.

The face is narrow, with the lower part projecting; eyes prominent; nose spread, and almost confounded with the cheeks; the lips, particularly the upper one, very thick; the jaws prominent, and the chin retracted. The skin of this class, and the iris of the eye, are deep black; the [[Black hair|hair black]] and [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]]; characteristics that vary less in the [[negro]]es than in the two former classes, for this very obvious reason, that the [[Negroid|Ethiopic race]] are to be found native mostly in [[tropical climate]]s, where there is little variety of temperature; and not like the Mongolian and [[Caucasian race]]s who are spread over all climates, from the [[equator]] to the [[Arctic Ocean|Polar Sea]].

The [[Zygomatic bone|cheek-bones]] are prominent, but more arched and rounded than in the [[Mongols|Mongol]], without being so angular, or projecting at the sides; the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbits]] almost always deep; the shape of the forehead and the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] often [[Artificial cranial deformation|artificially modified]]; the skull generally light. The face is broad, without being flat; the features, viewed in profile, are prominent, and deeply marked; the forehead low, eyes deep-seated, nose rather flat, but prominent. The [[redskin|skin is red]], more or less [[dark skin|dark]], or [[Copper (color)|copper-coloured]], and approaching to [[dark skin|black]], according to climate and other circumstances. The hair is like that of the Mongolian class; and they have little or no [[beard]]. In this class are comprehended all the [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|native American tribes and nations]], excepting, of course, the [[Eskimo|Esquimaux]], and the descendants of [[European colonization of the Americas|European]] and [[African diaspora in the Americas|African]] colonists.</p>\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|V. &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Malay race|Malay Class]]\n|-\n|<p>V.

The face is less narrow than that of the [[negro]], somewhat advancing in the lower part, when seen in profile; the features generally more prominent than those of the negro, the nose full, broad, and thick towards the point, or what is called a [[wikt:bottle-nose|bottle-nose]]. The colour of the skin is brown, or [[Tawny (color)|tawny]]; the [[black hair|hair black]], soft, curled, and abundant.

Fine silky hair, usually [[wikt:raven-haired|raven black]], never [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]], but wavy and tolerably long. The [[Aboriginal Australians|Australians]] are [[Cephalic index|doliocephalic]] (long-skulled), the cranial index often not amounting to more than seventy-one or seventy-two. Nose broad rather than flat, jaws heavy, lips very coarse and flexible. ''Norma occipitalis'' sharply [[wikt:pentagonal|pentagonal]]. [[Brow ridge|Brow-ridges]] strong and prominent, teeth large, and [[Incisor|fangs]] strong. These marks are seen in the [[Dasa|Dasyu]] hill-tribes inhabiting the interior of the [[Deccan Plateau|Dekhan]].

The [[Egyptians|Egyptian]], too, though changed by [[Ancient Egypt|civilisation]] and probably [[DNA history of Egypt|admixture]], has also the [[dark skin]], black silky wavy hair, long skull, fleshy lips, and broad [[Ala of nose|''alae'' of the nose]].</p><!--This quote is in the right column of page 585.-->\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|(2)  &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Negroid|Negroid Type]]\n|-\n|<p>(2) The [[Negroid|Negroid type]] is best represented by the [[negro]] of [[South Africa|S. Africa]] (including [[Madagascar]]), between the [[Sahara]] and the region of the [[Cape Peninsula|Cape]]. He is of fair [[Human height|stature]]; his body and limbs are well made; his [[dark skin|skin is black]], with shades of brown; his eyes, [[Brown eye|brown]] or black; his [[black hair|hair is black]], short, and crisp; his [[beard]] and [[body hair|body-hair]] scanty. He is [[cephalic index|doliocephalic]], the cranial index being often only seventy-three. His forehead is [[neoteny in humans|childlike]] and [[Femininity|feminine]]. The ''norma occipitalis'' is often [[wikt:pentagonal|pentagonal]]. Like the [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid]], there is generally [[prognathism]] (protruding jaws). The [[nasal bone]]s are depressed, giving a characteristic flat nose. The lips are coarse and projecting. The [[San people|Bushmen]] of the [[Cape Peninsula|Cape]] area are a special type, marked by low [[Human height|stature]], the males not much exceeding 4 feet in height; both [[sex]]es, however, are well made. The skin is yellowish brown, the eyes and [[black hair|hair black]], the latter [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]]. The [[wikt:anteroposterior|antero-posterior]] [[diameter]] of female [[pelvis]] is of great relative length. The [[steatopygia|accumulation of fat on the buttocks]], and the large [[Labia minora|nymphae]] of females, are also characteristic. [[Hottentot (racial term)|Hottentots]] are said to be a cross between [[San people|Bushmen]] and [[Negro]]es. Another modification, the [[Negrito]]s, occurs in the [[Andaman Islands|Andamans]], [[Malacca]], [[Philippines]], [[Tasmania]], and the islands parallel to the [[Coastline of Australia|Australian coast]], from [[Wallace Line|Wallace's Line]] to [[New Caledonia]]. The [[Andamanese|Andamans]] have a cranial index of eighty; all the rest are doliocephalic, though some in the [[South|S.]] and [[East|E.]] approach the [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid]] in large [[brow ridge|brow-ridges]] and otherwise (''[[exempli gratia|e.g.]]'', [[Tasmania]], [[New Caledonia]], [[New Guinea]], and [[Torres Strait]]s). There is perhaps a cross with [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] in [[New Guinea]]; more probably a cross with [[Polynesians]] in the [[Fiji|Feejees]].</p><!--This quote is in the right column of page 585.-->\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Caucasian race|Xanthochroic Type]]\n|-\n|<p>(3) [[Nordic race|Xanthochroic]], or fair [[white people|whites]], found in the greater part of the population of [[Central Europe]].

In [[physical attractiveness|physical beauty]] and [[intellect]]ual development they often excel the [[Nordic race|Xanthochroi]], but the skin, though transparent, is brown, deepening to [[olive (color)|olive]]; the [[Brown eye|eyes]] and [[black hair|hair are black]], the latter fine and wavy. This type shades off into the [[Nordic race|Xanthochroic]] and the [[Deccan Plateau|Dekhan]] variety of [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid]].</p><!--This quote is in the left column of page 586.-->\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;The Mongoloid Type\n|-\n|<p>(4) The great area [[East|E.]] of a line drawn from [[S\u00e1pmi|Lapland]] to [[Thailand|Siam]] is peopled chiefly by the Mongoloid, who are short, squat, with yellow-brown skin; eyes and [[black hair|hair black]], the latter coarse, straight, long on the scalp, but [[body hair|scanty on the body]] and [[beard|face]]. They are sometimes very [[cephalic index|brachycephalic]], without prominent [[brow ridge|brow-ridges]], nose flat and small, eyes oblique. The [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays proper]] and the [[Filipinos|indigenes of the Philippines]], who are not [[Negrito]]s, probably belong to this group. The [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]], on the other hand, are distinguished chiefly by being [[cephalic index|doliocephalic]]; this characteristic occurs also in the ancient [[Ainu people|Ainos]] (found, for example, in [[Hokkaido|Yesso]]), who are further remarkable for the development of [[beard|hair on face]] and [[body hair|body]], and the dull-red earthy skin. The [[Dayak people|Dyaks]] of [[Borneo]], the [[Batak|Battaks]] of [[Sumatra]], the [[Alfur people|Alfures]] of [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], are all [[cephalic index|doliocephalic]], and seem to pass through the people of the [[Palau|Pelew Islands]] and of the [[Caroline Islands|Caroline]] and [[Mariana Islands|Ladrone]] [[Archipelago]]s into the [[Polynesians]], in whom the straight hair and oblique eye have disappeared, the skull being long and coming back to the [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid type]]. The [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] type is best seen in the [[M\u0101ori people|Maoris]] of [[New Zealand]]; [[cephalic index|brachycephaly]] occurs in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich]] and [[Samoan Islands]]. [[Polynesian languages|Language]] shows that [[Polynesia]] was peopled from the west, and it is thought that the [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] type may be a cross between the [[Dayak people|Dyak]]-[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and the [[Negrito]] elements in [[Indonesia|Indo-nesia]]. In [[Northeast Asia|N.E. Asia]] the [[Chukchi people|Tchuktchi]] are said to be the same as the [[Eskimo]]s and [[Greenlandic Inuit|Greenlanders]] of [[North America|N. America]]; with Mongoloid hair and skin they have very long skulls. [[cephalic index|Doliocephaly]] also distinguishes the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|aborigines of both Americas]] from the [[Asian people|Asiatic]] Mongoloid; only the [[Tehuelche people|Patagonians]] and the ancient [[Mound Builders|mound-builders]] are [[cephalic index|brachycephalic]].

Of these the [[Negroid|Ethiopian]] is secondarily divided into the African [[Negro]]es, the [[Hottentot (racial term)|Hottentots]] and [[San people|Bushmen]], the [[wikt:oceanic|Oceanic]] [[Negro]]es or [[Melanesians]], and the [[Negrito]]s as represented by the inhabitants of the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and other [[list of islands in the Pacific Ocean|Pacific islands]]. The [[Aboriginal Australians|Australians]], whom [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] takes as the type of a separate race, he considers to be a mixed people, as they combine the [[Negro]] type of face and skeleton, with hair of a different type. His second race is the Mongolian, represented in an exaggerated form by the [[Eskimo]], in its typical condition by most of the natives of [[North Asia|northern]] and [[East Asia|eastern Asia]], and in a modified type by the [[Malay race|Malays]]. Excluding the [[Eskimo]], the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Americans]] form one group, whose closest affinity is with the Mongolian, yet which has so many special features that it might be viewed as a fourth primary division. His third or [[Caucasian race]] includes two [[wikt:subrace|sub-races]], \u2014 the [[Nordic race|Xanthochroic]] and [[Mediterranean race|Melanochroic]] of [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]].

The [[brow ridge]]s with their cold-vulnerable [[frontal sinus|sinuses]] are reduced; the [[Zygomatic bone|malars]] are extended forward and enlarged hence the external nose protrusion is reduced; the eye is protected by fatty lids whose borders are brought closer together, which in turn helps reduce the glare of light. The distended malars and [[maxillary sinus]]es are also protected by fatty pads, which helps to give the typical mongoloid face its flat appearance. In addition Mongoloids have sparse [[beard]]s, which may be an advantage because exhaled breath, in cold regions at any rate, can freeze the beard and underlying skin.<!--This quote is the 3rd paragraph of page 205.-->|author=Rupert I.

Typically, the nose is not very prominent on the face of a Mongoloid. Their frontal sinus is also reduced in order to allow more room for padding to protect from their cold environment.
