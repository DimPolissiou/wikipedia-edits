All attempts to found a city on Cuba's south coast failed. However, an early map of Cuba drawn in 1514 places the town at the mouth of this river.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [[commons:File:LaHabanaalSur.jpg|Fundaci\u00f3n de La Habana a orillas del R\u00edo Onicajinal o Mayabeque]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mayabeque.blogia.com/2009/092601-san-cristobal-de-la-habana-en-el-sur-analisis-historico-geografico-de-su-localiz.php |title=San Cristobal de La Habana en el Sur |publisher=Mayabeque.blogia.com |date=2010-08-19 |accessdate=2013-01-08}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1514 and 1519 the Spanish established at least two settlements on the north coast, one of them in ''La Chorrera'', today in the neighborhoods of Vedado and Miramar, next to the [[Almendares River]]. The town that became Havana finally originated adjacent to what was then called ''Puerto de Carenas'' (literally, \"[[Careening]] Bay\"), in 1519. The quality of this natural bay, which now hosts Havana's harbor, warranted this change of location.\n\n[[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] gave Havana \u2013 the sixth town founded by the Spanish on Cuba \u2013 its name: ''San Crist\u00f3bal de la Habana''. The name combines ''San Crist\u00f3bal'', [[patron saint]] of Havana. Shortly after the founding of Cuba's first cities, the island served as little more than a base for the ''Conquista'' of other lands.\n\nHavana began as a [[port|trading port]], and suffered regular attacks by [[buccaneer]]s, [[piracy|pirates]], and [[French corsairs]]. The first attack and resultant burning of the city was by the French corsair [[Jacques de Sores]] in 1555. Such attacks convinced the Spanish Crown to fund the construction of the first fortresses in the main cities \u2013 not only to counteract the pirates and corsairs, but also to exert more control over commerce with the West Indies, and to limit the extensive ''contrabando'' ([[black market]]) that had arisen due to the trade restrictions imposed by the ''[[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]]'' of [[Seville]] (the crown-controlled trading house that held a [[monopoly]] on New World trade).\n\nShips from all over the New World carried products first to Havana, in order to be taken by the fleet to Spain. The thousands of ships gathered in the city's bay also fueled Havana's agriculture and manufacture, since they had to be supplied with food, water, and other products needed to traverse the ocean.\n\nOn December 20, 1592, [[King Philip II of Spain]] granted Havana the title of City. Later on, the city would be officially designated as \"Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies\" by the [[Spanish Crown]]. In the meantime, efforts to build or improve the defensive infrastructures of the city continued.\n\n====17th century====\n[[File:Panorama of La Habana (Amsterdam, 17th century).jpg|thumb|17th-century depiction of Havana from the [[Beudeker Collection]]]]\nHavana expanded greatly in the 17th century. New buildings were constructed from the most abundant materials of the island, mainly [[wood]], combining various [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] architectural styles, as well as borrowing profusely from [[Canary Islands|Canarian]] characteristics.\n\nIn 1649, an epidemic of the often fatal [[Yellow fever]] brought from [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] in Colombia affected a third of the European population of Havana.<ref>C Cumo.

The [[Battle of Havana (1762)|episode]] began on June 6, 1762, when at dawn, a British fleet, comprising more than 50 ships and a combined force of over 11,000 men of the [[Royal Navy]] and Army, sailed into Cuban waters and made an amphibious landing east of Havana.<ref name=\"Seven Years War\">Pocock, Tom: Battle for Empire: The very first world war 1756\u201363. Chapter Six.</ref> The British immediately opened up trade with their [[North American]] and [[British West Indies|Caribbean colonies]], causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. Less than a year after Havana was seized, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]] was signed by the three warring powers thus ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] in exchange for the return of the city of Havana on to Spain.<ref name=\"Siege\">Thomas, Hugh: Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom 2nd edition. Chapter One</ref>\n\nAfter regaining the city, the Spanish transformed Havana into the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Construction began on what was to become the Fortress of [[La Caba\u00f1a|San Carlos de la Caba\u00f1a]], the third biggest Spanish fortification in the New World after [[Castillo San Crist\u00f3bal (San Juan)|Castillo San Crist\u00f3bal]] (the biggest) and [[Castillo San Felipe del Morro]] both in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On January 15, 1796, the remains of [[Christopher Columbus]] were transported to the island from [[Santo Domingo]]. They rested here until 1898, when they were transferred to [[Seville Cathedral|Seville's Cathedral]], after Spain's loss of Cuba.\n\n====19th century====\n[[File:Mapa de La Habana Vieja.JPG|thumb|right|19th-century depiction of Havana]]\nAs trade between Caribbean and North American states increased in the early 19th century, Havana became a flourishing and fashionable city. Havana's theaters featured the most distinguished actors of the age, and prosperity among the burgeoning middle-class led to expensive new classical mansions being erected. During this period Havana became known as the Paris of the [[Antilles]].\n\nIn 1837, the first railroad was constructed, a {{convert|51|km|abbr=on}} stretch between Havana and [[Bejucal]], which was used for transporting [[sugar]] from the valley of [[G\u00fcines]] to the harbor. With this, Cuba became the fifth country in the world to have a railroad, and the first [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking country. Throughout the century, Havana was enriched by the construction of additional cultural facilities, such as the [[Great Theatre of Havana|Tacon Teatre]], one of the most luxurious in the world. The fact that slavery was legal in Cuba until 1886 led to Southern American interest, including a plan by the [[Knights of the Golden Circle]] to create a [[Golden Circle (proposed country)|'Golden Circle']] with a 1200&nbsp;mile-radius centered on Havana. After the [[Confederate States of America]] were defeated in the [[American Civil War]] in 1865, many former slaveholders continued to run plantations by moving to Havana.\n\nIn 1863, the city walls were knocked down so that the [[metropolis]] could be enlarged. At the end of the 19th century, Havana witnessed the final moments of Spanish colonialism in the Americas.\n\n===Republican period and post-revolution===\nThe 20th century began with Cuba, and therefore Havana, under occupation by the United States.<ref>Cant\u00f3n Navarro, Jos\u00e9. ''History of Cuba'', p. 81.</ref> The US occupation officially ended when [[Tom\u00e1s Estrada Palma]], [[List of Presidents of Cuba|first president of Cuba]], took office on 20 May 1902.\n\nDuring the Republican Period, from 1902 to 1959, the city saw a new era of development. Cuba recovered from the devastation of war to become a well-off country, with the third largest middle class in the hemisphere. Apartment buildings to accommodate the new middle class, as well as mansions for the Cuban tycoons, were built at a fast pace.\n\n[[File:HavanaNewCapitalBldg1920.jpg|thumb|left|[[El Capitolio|Capitolio Nacional]] in 1929]]\n[[File:Museo de La Revolucion, Cuba.jpg|[[Kavanagh building]]|thumb|The former presidential palace now houses a museum]]\nNumerous luxury hotels, casinos and nightclubs were constructed during the 1930s to serve Havana's burgeoning tourist industry, which greatly benefited by the U.S. [[prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] on alcohol from 1920 to 1933. In the 1930s, organized crime characters were not unaware of Havana's nightclub and casino life, and they made their inroads in the city. [[Santo Trafficante Jr.]] took the roulette wheel at the Sans Souci Casino, [[Meyer Lansky]] directed the [[Hotel Habana Riviera]], with [[Lucky Luciano]] at the [[Hotel Nacional de Cuba|Hotel Nacional]] Casino. At the time, Havana became an exotic capital of appeal and numerous activities ranging from marinas, grand prix car racing, musical shows, and parks.

During this era, Havana was generally producing more revenue than [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas, Nevada]], whose boom as a tourist destination began only after Havana's casinos closed in 1959. In 1958, about 300,000 American tourists visited the city.\n\nAfter the [[Cuban Revolution|revolution of 1959]], the new r\u00e9gime under [[Fidel Castro]] promised to improve social services, public housing, and official buildings. Nevertheless, after Castro's abrupt expropriation of all private property and industry (May 1959 onwards) under a strong communist model backed by the Soviet Union followed by the U.S. [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo]], shortages that affected Cuba in general hit Havana especially hard. By 1966\u201368, the Cuban government had [[nationalized]] all privately owned business entities in Cuba, down to \"certain kinds of small retail forms of commerce\" (law No. 1076<ref>{{cite web|author= Nigel Hunt |url= http://www.cubaheritage.org/articles.asp?lID=1&artID=236 |title= Cuba Nationalization Laws |publisher= cuba heritage .org |accessdate= 2009-07-08}}</ref>).\n\nA severe economic downturn occurred after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. Soviet subsidies ended, representing billions of dollars which the Soviet Union had given the [[Cuba \u2013 Soviet Union relations|Cuban government]]. Many believed the revolutionary government would soon collapse, as happened to the Soviet [[satellite state]]s of [[Eastern Europe]]. However, contrary to events in Europe, Cuba's communist government persevered through the 1990s and persists to this day.\n\nAfter many years of [[prohibition]], the communist government increasingly turned to [[tourism in Cuba|tourism]] for new financial revenue, and has allowed foreign investors to build new hotels and develop the hospitality industry. In Old Havana, effort has also gone into rebuilding for tourist purposes, and a number of streets and squares have been rehabilitated.<ref>\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012210544/http://granma.cu/ESPANOL/2006/diciembre/juev7/elogian-e.html Old Havana restoration] \u2013 Success on the restoration program of Havana\n</ref>\nBut Old Havana is a large city, and the restoration efforts concentrate in all on less than 10% of its area.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|Astronaut photograph of Havana]]\n\nHavana lies on the northern coast of Cuba, south of the [[Florida Keys]], where the Gulf of Mexico joins the Atlantic Ocean. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbours: Marimelena, Guanabacoa, and Atar\u00e9s. The sluggish [[Almendares River]] traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay.\n\nThere are low hills on which the city lies rise gently from the deep blue waters of the straits. A noteworthy elevation is the 200-foot-high (60-metre) limestone ridge that slopes up from the east and culminates in the heights of [[La Caba\u00f1a]] and [[Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro|El Morro]], the sites of colonial fortifications overlooking the eastern bay. Another notable rise is the hill to the west that is occupied by the [[University of Havana]] and the Prince's Castle. Outside the city, higher hills rise on the west and east.\n\n===Climate===\nHavana, like much of Cuba, has a [[tropical climate]] that is tempered by the island's position in the belt of the [[trade wind]]s and by the warm offshore currents. Under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Havana has a [[tropical savanna climate]] that closely borders on a [[tropical monsoon climate]]. Average temperatures range from {{convert|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in January and February to {{convert|28|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in August. The temperature seldom drops below {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The lowest temperature was {{convert|1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in Santiago de Las Vegas, Boyeros. The lowest recorded temperature in Cuba was {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in Bainoa, [[Mayabeque Province]] (before 2011 the eastern part of Havana province). Rainfall is heaviest in June and October and lightest from December through April, averaging {{convert|1200|mm|in|abbr=on}} annually. Hurricanes occasionally strike the island, but they ordinarily hit the south coast,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} and damage in Havana has been less than elsewhere in the country.\n\nTornadoes can be somewhat rare in Cuba, however, on the evening of January 28, 2019, a very rare strong [[Fujita scale|F4]] [[tornado]] struck the eastern side of Havana, Cuba's capital city. The tornado caused extensive damage, destroying at least 90 homes, killing four people and injuring 195.<ref>{{cite web |title=Havana tornado: Cuba's capital hit by rare twister |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47025852 |website=BBC News |accessdate=28 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/the-latest-resident-havana-looks-like-a-horror-movie/504962142/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129181446/http://www.startribune.com/the-latest-resident-havana-looks-like-a-horror-movie/504962142/ |archive-date=2019-01-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/28/americas/cuba-tornado-dead-scli-intl/index.html</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Cappucci |first1=Matthew |title=A deadly tornado plowed through Havana on Sunday night.

In the second half of the 18th century, sugar and coffee production increased rapidly, which became essential in the development of Havana's most prominent architectural style. Many wealthy ''Habaneros'' took their inspiration from the French; this can be seen within the interiors of upper-class houses such as the ''Aldama Palace'' built in 1844. This is considered the most important neoclassical residential building in Cuba and typifies the design of many houses of this period with portales of neoclassical columns facing open spaces or courtyards.\n\nIn 1925 [[Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier]], the head of urban planning in Paris moved to Havana for five years to collaborate with architects and landscape designers. In the master planning of the city his aim was to create a harmonic balance between the classical built form and the tropical landscape. He embraced and connected the city's road networks while accentuating prominent landmarks. His influence has left a huge mark on Havana although many of his ideas were cut short by the [[Great Depression|great depression in 1929]]. During the first decades of the 20th century Havana expanded more rapidly than at any time during its history. Great wealth prompted architectural styles to be influenced from abroad. The peak of Neoclassicism came with the construction of the [[Vedado|Vedado district]] (begun in 1859). This area features a number of set back well-proportioned buildings in the Neoclassical style\n\n;Colonial and Baroque\n[[File:Edificio en la Habana.jpg|thumb|left|Neo-baroque apartment building]]\nRiches were brought from the colonialists into and through Havana as it was a key [[transshipment]] point between the [[new world]] and [[old world]]. As a result, Havana was the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Most examples of early architecture can be seen in military fortifications such as [[La Caba\u00f1a|La Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabana]] (1558\u20131577) designed by [[Battista Antonelli]] and the [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Castillo del Morro]] (1589\u20131630). This sits at the entrance of [[Havana Harbor|Havana Bay]] and provides an insight into the supremacy and wealth at that time.\n\nOld Havana was also protected by a defensive wall begun in 1674 but had already overgrown its boundaries when it was completed in 1767, becoming the new neighbourhood of [[Centro Habana]]. The influence from different styles and cultures can be seen in Havana's colonial architecture, with a diverse range of [[Moorish architecture]], [[Spanish architecture|Spanish]], [[Architecture of Italy|Italian]], [[Ancient Greek architecture|Greek]] and [[Roman architecture|Roman]]. The [[San Carlos and San Ambrosio Seminary]] (18th century) is a good example of early Spanish influenced architecture. [[Cathedral of Havana|The Havana cathedral]] (1748\u20131777) dominating the Plaza de la Catedral (1749) is the best example of Cuban Baroque. Surrounding it are the former palaces of the Count de Casa-Bayona (1720\u20131746) Marquis de Arcos (1746) and the Marquis de Aguas Claras (1751\u20131775).\n\n;Art Deco and Eclectic\nThe first echoes of the [[Art Deco]] movement in Havana started in 1927, in the residential area of [[Miramar, Havana|Miramar]].<ref name=\"Havana Deco\">{{cite book|last=Alonso|first=Alejandro|title=Havana Deco|year=2003|publisher=W.W.

In the 17th century, it was one of the main shipbuilding centers. The city was built in [[baroque]] and [[neoclassic style]].\n\nMany buildings have fallen in ruin but a number are being restored.

A pamphlet published by E.C. Kropp Co., Milwaukee, WI, between 1921 and 1939 promoting tourism in Havana, Cuba, can be found in the University of Houston Digital Library, Havana, Cuba, The Summer Land of the World, Digital Collection.\n\nWith the deterioration of [[Cuba \u2013 United States relations]] and the imposition of the [[United States embargo against Cuba|trade embargo]] on the island in 1961, tourism dropped drastically and did not return to anything close to its pre-revolution levels until 1989. The revolutionary government in general, and [[Fidel Castro]] in particular, initially opposed any considerable development of the tourism industry, linking it to the debauchery and criminal activities of times past. In the late 1970s, however, Castro changed his stance and, in 1982, the Cuban government passed a foreign investment code which opened a number of sectors, tourism included, to foreign capital.\n\nThrough the creation of firms open to such foreign investment (such as ''Cubanacan''), Cuba began to attract capital for hotel development, managing to increase the number of tourists from 130,000 (in 1980) to 326,000 (by the end of that decade).\n\nHavana has also been a popular [[health tourism]] destination for more than 20 years. Foreign patients travel to Cuba, Havana in particular, for a wide range of treatments including [[eye-surgery]], [[neurological]] disorders such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[orthopaedics]].

Sugar and a flourishing [[slave]] trade first brought riches to the city, and later, after independence, it became a renowned resort. Despite efforts by Fidel Castro's government to spread Cuba's industrial activity to all parts of the island, Havana remains the centre of much of the nation's industry.\n\nThe traditional sugar industry, upon which the island's economy has been based for three centuries, is centred elsewhere on the island and controls some three-fourths of the export economy. But light manufacturing facilities, meat-packing plants, and chemical and pharmaceutical operations are concentrated in Havana. Other food-processing industries are also important, along with shipbuilding, vehicle manufacturing, production of alcoholic beverages (particularly rum), textiles, and tobacco products, particularly the world-famous [[Habanos S.A.|Habanos]] cigars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macalester.edu/courses/geog61/jtahtinen/economy.html |title=The economy of Havana |publisher=Macalester.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> Although the [[harbour]]s of [[Cienfuegos]] and [[Matanzas]], in particular, have been developed under the revolutionary government, Havana remains Cuba's primary port facility; 50% of Cuban imports and exports pass through Havana. The port also supports a considerable fishing industry.\n\nIn 2000, nearly 89% of the city's officially recorded labour force worked for government-run agencies, institutions or enterprises. Havana, on average, has the country's highest incomes and human development indicators. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba re-emphasized tourism as a major industry leading to its recovery. Tourism is now Havana and Cuba's primary economic source.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf |title=Tourism in Cuba during the Special Period |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-17|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100725185350/http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf |archivedate = 2010-07-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHavana's economy is still in flux, despite Raul Castro's embrace of free enterprise in 2011.

In Havana, Cuban-owned businesses and U.S.-owned businesses were nationalized and today most businesses operate solely under state control.\n\nIn Old Havana and throughout Vedado there are several small private businesses, such as shoe-repair shops or dressmaking facilities.

There is only one political party, the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party]], but since there must be a minimum of two candidates, members of the Communist Party often run against each other. Candidates are not required to be members of the party. They are nominated directly by citizens in open meetings within each election district. Municipal Assembly delegates in turn elect members of the Provincial Assembly, which in Havana serves roughly as the City Council; its president functions as the Mayor. There are direct elections for deputies to the National Assembly based on slates, and a portion of the candidates is nominated at the local level. The People's Councils (Consejos Populares) consist of local municipal delegates who elect a full-time representative to preside over the body. In addition, there is participation from \"mass organisations\" and representatives of local government agencies, industries and services. The 105 People's Councils in Havana cover an average of 20,000 residents.\n\nHavana city borders are contiguous with the [[Mayabeque Province]] on the south and east and to [[Artemisa Province]] on the west, since former [[La Habana Province]] (rural) was abolished in 2010.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Education===\n[[File:University of Havana.JPG|thumb|[[University of Havana]]]]\n[[File:Facultad de Matem\u00e1ticas y Ciencias de la Computaci\u00f3n.JPG|thumb|Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, ''University of Havana'']]\n\n{{Further|Education in Cuba}}\nThe national government assumes all responsibility for education, and there are adequate primary, secondary, and vocational training schools throughout Cuba. The schools are of varying quality and education is free and compulsory at all levels except higher learning, which is also free.\n\nThe [[University of Havana]], located in the [[Vedado]] section of Havana, was established in 1728 and was regarded as a leading institution of higher learning in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Soon after the Revolution, the university, as well as all other educational institutions, were nationalized. Since then several other universities have opened, like the [[Polytechnic Jos\u00e9 Antonio Echeverr\u00eda|Higher Learning Polytechnic Institute Jos\u00e9 Antonio Echeverr\u00eda]] where the vast majority of today's Cuban engineers are taught.\n\nThe [[Cuban National Ballet School]] with 4,350 students is one of the largest ballet schools in the world and the most prestigious [[ballet]] school in Cuba.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.bohemia.cubasi.cu/2006/04/28/cultura/ballet-formacion-humanista.html La Escuela Nacional de Ballet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623000202/http://www.bohemia.cubasi.cu/2006/04/28/cultura/ballet-formacion-humanista.html |date=2009-06-23 }} \u2013 La Escuela desarrolla una experiencia \u00fanica en el mundo, enmarcada en la Batalla de Ideas.</ref>\n\n===Health===\n{{Further|Healthcare in Cuba}}\nAll Cuban residents have free access to health care in hospitals,<ref name=\"Harvard\">[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/review/review_summer_02/txt677cuba.html Harvard Public Health Review/Summer 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120530063729/http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/review/review_summer_02/txt677cuba.html |date=2012-05-30 }} The Cuban Paradox</ref> local polyclinics, and neighborhood family doctors who serve on average 170 families each,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4583668.stm Medical know-how boosts Cuba's wealth] BBC online.</ref> which is one of the highest doctor-to-patient ratio in the world.<ref>[http://hdr.undp.org/statistics/data/indicators.cfm?x=58&y=2&z=1 Commitment to health: resources, access and services] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718084329/http://hdr.undp.org/statistics/data/indicators.cfm?x=58&y=2&z=1 |date=July 18, 2006 }} United Nations Human Development report</ref> However, the health system has suffered from shortages of supplies, equipment and medications caused by ending of the [[Soviet Union]] subsidies in the early 1990s and the [[United States embargo against Cuba|US embargo]].<ref name=\"US embargo\">The effects of the U.S. embargo on medicines in Cuba have been studied in numerous reports.<br />\n\u2022 '''R Garfield and S Santana'''.

Water, electricity, and sewage service are administered in this fashion. Electricity is supplied by generators that are fueled with oil. Much of the original power plant installations, which operated before the Revolutionary government assumed control, have become somewhat outdated. Electrical blackouts occurred, prompting the national government in 1986 to allocate the equivalent of $25,000,000 to modernize the electrical system.\n\n==Sports==\nMany Cubans are avid sports fans who particularly favour baseball. Havana's team in the [[Cuban National Series]] is [[Industriales]]. FCBA. The city has several large sports stadiums, the largest one is the [[Estadio Latinoamericano]]. Admission to sporting events is generally free, and impromptu games are played in neighborhoods throughout the city.

All attempts to found a city on Cuba's south coast failed. However, an early map of Cuba drawn in 1514 places the town at the mouth of this river.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [[commons:File:LaHabanaalSur.jpg|Fundaci\u00f3n de La Habana a orillas del R\u00edo Onicajinal o Mayabeque]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mayabeque.blogia.com/2009/092601-san-cristobal-de-la-habana-en-el-sur-analisis-historico-geografico-de-su-localiz.php |title=San Cristobal de La Habana en el Sur |publisher=Mayabeque.blogia.com |date=2010-08-19 |accessdate=2013-01-08}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1514 and 1519 the Spanish established at least two settlements on the north coast, one of them in ''La Chorrera'', today in the neighborhoods of Vedado and Miramar, next to the [[Almendares River]]. The town that became Havana finally originated adjacent to what was then called ''Puerto de Carenas'' (literally, \"[[Careening]] Bay\"), in 1519. The quality of this natural bay, which now hosts Havana's harbor, warranted this change of location.\n\n[[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] gave Havana \u2013 the sixth town founded by the Spanish on Cuba \u2013 its name: ''San Crist\u00f3bal de la Habana''. The name combines ''San Crist\u00f3bal'', [[patron saint]] of Havana. Shortly after the founding of Cuba's first cities, the island served as little more than a base for the ''Conquista'' of other lands.\n\nHavana began as a [[port|trading port]], and suffered regular attacks by [[buccaneer]]s, [[piracy|pirates]], and [[French corsairs]]. The first attack and resultant burning of the city was by the French corsair [[Jacques de Sores]] in 1555. Such attacks convinced the Spanish Crown to fund the construction of the first fortresses in the main cities \u2013 not only to counteract the pirates and corsairs, but also to exert more control over commerce with the West Indies, and to limit the extensive ''contrabando'' ([[black market]]) that had arisen due to the trade restrictions imposed by the ''[[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]]'' of [[Seville]] (the crown-controlled trading house that held a [[monopoly]] on New World trade).\n\nShips from all over the New World carried products first to Havana, in order to be taken by the fleet to Spain. The thousands of ships gathered in the city's bay also fueled Havana's agriculture and manufacture, since they had to be supplied with food, water, and other products needed to traverse the ocean.\n\nOn December 20, 1592, [[King Philip II of Spain]] granted Havana the title of City. Later on, the city would be officially designated as \"Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies\" by the [[Spanish Crown]]. In the meantime, efforts to build or improve the defensive infrastructures of the city continued.\n\n====17th century====\n[[File:Panorama of La Habana (Amsterdam, 17th century).jpg|thumb|17th-century depiction of Havana from the [[Beudeker Collection]]]]\nHavana expanded greatly in the 17th century. New buildings were constructed from the most abundant materials of the island, mainly [[wood]], combining various [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] architectural styles, as well as borrowing profusely from [[Canary Islands|Canarian]] characteristics.\n\nIn 1649, an epidemic of the often fatal [[Yellow fever]] brought from [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] in Colombia affected a third of the European population of Havana.<ref>C Cumo.

Havana built nearly 50% more Ships of the Line than any other Spanish dockyard during the 18th century.</ref>\n\nThe city was captured by the [[Great Britain|British]] during the [[Seven Years' War]]. The [[Battle of Havana (1762)|episode]] began on June 6, 1762, when at dawn, a British fleet, comprising more than 50 ships and a combined force of over 11,000 men of the [[Royal Navy]] and Army, sailed into Cuban waters and made an amphibious landing east of Havana.<ref name=\"Seven Years War\">Pocock, Tom: Battle for Empire: The very first world war 1756\u201363. Chapter Six.</ref> The British immediately opened up trade with their [[North American]] and [[British West Indies|Caribbean colonies]], causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. Less than a year after Havana was seized, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]] was signed by the three warring powers thus ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] in exchange for the return of the city of Havana on to Spain.<ref name=\"Siege\">Thomas, Hugh: Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom 2nd edition. Chapter One</ref>\n\nAfter regaining the city, the Spanish transformed Havana into the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Construction began on what was to become the Fortress of [[La Caba\u00f1a|San Carlos de la Caba\u00f1a]], the third biggest Spanish fortification in the New World after [[Castillo San Crist\u00f3bal (San Juan)|Castillo San Crist\u00f3bal]] (the biggest) and [[Castillo San Felipe del Morro]] both in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On January 15, 1796, the remains of [[Christopher Columbus]] were transported to the island from [[Santo Domingo]]. They rested here until 1898, when they were transferred to [[Seville Cathedral|Seville's Cathedral]], after Spain's loss of Cuba.\n\n====19th century====\n[[File:Mapa de La Habana Vieja.JPG|thumb|right|19th-century depiction of Havana]]\nAs trade between Caribbean and North American states increased in the early 19th century, Havana became a flourishing and fashionable city. Havana's theaters featured the most distinguished actors of the age, and prosperity among the burgeoning middle-class led to expensive new classical mansions being erected. During this period Havana became known as the Paris of the [[Antilles]].\n\nIn 1837, the first railroad was constructed, a {{convert|51|km|abbr=on}} stretch between Havana and [[Bejucal]], which was used for transporting [[sugar]] from the valley of [[G\u00fcines]] to the harbor. With this, Cuba became the fifth country in the world to have a railroad, and the first [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking country. Throughout the century, Havana was enriched by the construction of additional cultural facilities, such as the [[Great Theatre of Havana|Tacon Teatre]], one of the most luxurious in the world. The fact that slavery was legal in Cuba until 1886 led to Southern American interest, including a plan by the [[Knights of the Golden Circle]] to create a [[Golden Circle (proposed country)|'Golden Circle']] with a 1200&nbsp;mile-radius centered on Havana. After the [[Confederate States of America]] were defeated in the [[American Civil War]] in 1865, many former slaveholders continued to run plantations by moving to Havana.\n\nIn 1863, the city walls were knocked down so that the [[metropolis]] could be enlarged. At the end of the 19th century, Havana witnessed the final moments of Spanish colonialism in the Americas.\n\n===Republican period and post-revolution===\nThe 20th century began with Cuba, and therefore Havana, under occupation by the United States.<ref>Cant\u00f3n Navarro, Jos\u00e9. ''History of Cuba'', p. 81.</ref> The US occupation officially ended when [[Tom\u00e1s Estrada Palma]], [[List of Presidents of Cuba|first president of Cuba]], took office on 20 May 1902.\n\nDuring the Republican Period, from 1902 to 1959, the city saw a new era of development. Cuba recovered from the devastation of war to become a well-off country, with the third largest middle class in the hemisphere. Apartment buildings to accommodate the new middle class, as well as mansions for the Cuban tycoons, were built at a fast pace.\n\n[[File:HavanaNewCapitalBldg1920.jpg|thumb|left|[[El Capitolio|Capitolio Nacional]] in 1929]]\n[[File:Museo de La Revolucion, Cuba.jpg|[[Kavanagh building]]|thumb|The former presidential palace now houses a museum]]\nNumerous luxury hotels, casinos and nightclubs were constructed during the 1930s to serve Havana's burgeoning tourist industry, which greatly benefited by the U.S. [[prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] on alcohol from 1920 to 1933. In the 1930s, organized crime characters were not unaware of Havana's nightclub and casino life, and they made their inroads in the city. [[Santo Trafficante Jr.]] took the roulette wheel at the Sans Souci Casino, [[Meyer Lansky]] directed the [[Hotel Habana Riviera]], with [[Lucky Luciano]] at the [[Hotel Nacional de Cuba|Hotel Nacional]] Casino. At the time, Havana became an exotic capital of appeal and numerous activities ranging from marinas, grand prix car racing, musical shows, and parks. It was also the favorite destination of [[sex tourists]].<ref>{{cite book\n|title=HAVANA BEFORE CASTRO : when Cuba was a tropical playground.\n|first=Peter\n|last=Moruzzi\n|year=2018\n|publisher=Gibbs Smith\n|isbn=1423603672}}</ref>{{rp|127}}\n\nHavana achieved the title of being the [[Latin American]] city with the biggest middle class population per-capita, simultaneously accompanied by gambling and corruption where gangsters and stars were known to mix socially. During this era, Havana was generally producing more revenue than [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas, Nevada]], whose boom as a tourist destination began only after Havana's casinos closed in 1959. In 1958, about 300,000 American tourists visited the city.\n\nAfter the [[Cuban Revolution|revolution of 1959]], the new r\u00e9gime under [[Fidel Castro]] promised to improve social services, public housing, and official buildings. Nevertheless, after Castro's abrupt expropriation of all private property and industry (May 1959 onwards) under a strong communist model backed by the Soviet Union followed by the U.S. [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo]], shortages that affected Cuba in general hit Havana especially hard. By 1966\u201368, the Cuban government had [[nationalized]] all privately owned business entities in Cuba, down to \"certain kinds of small retail forms of commerce\" (law No. 1076<ref>{{cite web|author= Nigel Hunt |url= http://www.cubaheritage.org/articles.asp?lID=1&artID=236 |title= Cuba Nationalization Laws |publisher= cuba heritage .org |accessdate= 2009-07-08}}</ref>).\n\nA severe economic downturn occurred after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. Soviet subsidies ended, representing billions of dollars which the Soviet Union had given the [[Cuba \u2013 Soviet Union relations|Cuban government]]. Many believed the revolutionary government would soon collapse, as happened to the Soviet [[satellite state]]s of [[Eastern Europe]]. However, contrary to events in Europe, Cuba's communist government persevered through the 1990s and persists to this day.\n\nAfter many years of [[prohibition]], the communist government increasingly turned to [[tourism in Cuba|tourism]] for new financial revenue, and has allowed foreign investors to build new hotels and develop the hospitality industry. In Old Havana, effort has also gone into rebuilding for tourist purposes, and a number of streets and squares have been rehabilitated.<ref>\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012210544/http://granma.cu/ESPANOL/2006/diciembre/juev7/elogian-e.html Old Havana restoration] \u2013 Success on the restoration program of Havana\n</ref>\nBut Old Havana is a large city, and the restoration efforts concentrate in all on less than 10% of its area.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|Astronaut photograph of Havana]]\n\nHavana lies on the northern coast of Cuba, south of the [[Florida Keys]], where the Gulf of Mexico joins the Atlantic Ocean. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbours: Marimelena, Guanabacoa, and Atar\u00e9s. The sluggish [[Almendares River]] traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay.\n\nThere are low hills on which the city lies rise gently from the deep blue waters of the straits. A noteworthy elevation is the 200-foot-high (60-metre) limestone ridge that slopes up from the east and culminates in the heights of [[La Caba\u00f1a]] and [[Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro|El Morro]], the sites of colonial fortifications overlooking the eastern bay. Another notable rise is the hill to the west that is occupied by the [[University of Havana]] and the Prince's Castle. Outside the city, higher hills rise on the west and east.\n\n===Climate===\nHavana, like much of Cuba, has a [[tropical climate]] that is tempered by the island's position in the belt of the [[trade wind]]s and by the warm offshore currents. Under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Havana has a [[tropical savanna climate]] that closely borders on a [[tropical monsoon climate]]. Average temperatures range from {{convert|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in January and February to {{convert|28|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in August. The temperature seldom drops below {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The lowest temperature was {{convert|1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in Santiago de Las Vegas, Boyeros. The lowest recorded temperature in Cuba was {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in Bainoa, [[Mayabeque Province]] (before 2011 the eastern part of Havana province). Rainfall is heaviest in June and October and lightest from December through April, averaging {{convert|1200|mm|in|abbr=on}} annually. Hurricanes occasionally strike the island, but they ordinarily hit the south coast,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} and damage in Havana has been less than elsewhere in the country.\n\nTornadoes can be somewhat rare in Cuba, however, on the evening of January 28, 2019, a very rare strong [[Fujita scale|F4]] [[tornado]] struck the eastern side of Havana, Cuba's capital city. The tornado caused extensive damage, destroying at least 90 homes, killing four people and injuring 195.<ref>{{cite web |title=Havana tornado: Cuba's capital hit by rare twister |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47025852 |website=BBC News |accessdate=28 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/the-latest-resident-havana-looks-like-a-horror-movie/504962142/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129181446/http://www.startribune.com/the-latest-resident-havana-looks-like-a-horror-movie/504962142/ |archive-date=2019-01-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/28/americas/cuba-tornado-dead-scli-intl/index.html</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Cappucci |first1=Matthew |title=A deadly tornado plowed through Havana on Sunday night.

In the second half of the 18th century, sugar and coffee production increased rapidly, which became essential in the development of Havana's most prominent architectural style. Many wealthy ''Habaneros'' took their inspiration from the French; this can be seen within the interiors of upper-class houses such as the ''Aldama Palace'' built in 1844. This is considered the most important neoclassical residential building in Cuba and typifies the design of many houses of this period with portales of neoclassical columns facing open spaces or courtyards.\n\nIn 1925 [[Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier]], the head of urban planning in Paris moved to Havana for five years to collaborate with architects and landscape designers. In the master planning of the city his aim was to create a harmonic balance between the classical built form and the tropical landscape. He embraced and connected the city's road networks while accentuating prominent landmarks. His influence has left a huge mark on Havana although many of his ideas were cut short by the [[Great Depression|great depression in 1929]]. During the first decades of the 20th century Havana expanded more rapidly than at any time during its history. Great wealth prompted architectural styles to be influenced from abroad. The peak of Neoclassicism came with the construction of the [[Vedado|Vedado district]] (begun in 1859). This area features a number of set back well-proportioned buildings in the Neoclassical style\n\n;Colonial and Baroque\n[[File:Edificio en la Habana.jpg|thumb|left|Neo-baroque apartment building]]\nRiches were brought from the colonialists into and through Havana as it was a key [[transshipment]] point between the [[new world]] and [[old world]]. As a result, Havana was the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Most examples of early architecture can be seen in military fortifications such as [[La Caba\u00f1a|La Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabana]] (1558\u20131577) designed by [[Battista Antonelli]] and the [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Castillo del Morro]] (1589\u20131630). This sits at the entrance of [[Havana Harbor|Havana Bay]] and provides an insight into the supremacy and wealth at that time.\n\nOld Havana was also protected by a defensive wall begun in 1674 but had already overgrown its boundaries when it was completed in 1767, becoming the new neighbourhood of [[Centro Habana]]. The influence from different styles and cultures can be seen in Havana's colonial architecture, with a diverse range of [[Moorish architecture]], [[Spanish architecture|Spanish]], [[Architecture of Italy|Italian]], [[Ancient Greek architecture|Greek]] and [[Roman architecture|Roman]]. The [[San Carlos and San Ambrosio Seminary]] (18th century) is a good example of early Spanish influenced architecture. [[Cathedral of Havana|The Havana cathedral]] (1748\u20131777) dominating the Plaza de la Catedral (1749) is the best example of Cuban Baroque. Surrounding it are the former palaces of the Count de Casa-Bayona (1720\u20131746) Marquis de Arcos (1746) and the Marquis de Aguas Claras (1751\u20131775).\n\n;Art Deco and Eclectic\nThe first echoes of the [[Art Deco]] movement in Havana started in 1927, in the residential area of [[Miramar, Havana|Miramar]].<ref name=\"Havana Deco\">{{cite book|last=Alonso|first=Alejandro|title=Havana Deco|year=2003|publisher=W.W.

It contained 400 apartments, garages, a school, a supermarket, and restaurant on the top floor. This was the tallest concrete structure in the world at the time (using no steel frame) and the ultimate symbol of luxury and excess. The [[Hotel Habana Riviera|Havana Riviera]] Hotel (1957) designed by [[Igor B.

It became a stopping point for the treasure laden Spanish [[Galleons]] on the crossing between the [[New World]] and the [[Old World]]. In the 17th century, it was one of the main shipbuilding centers. The city was built in [[baroque]] and [[neoclassic style]].\n\nMany buildings have fallen in ruin but a number are being restored.

Between 1915 and 1930, Havana hosted more tourists than any other location in the Caribbean.<ref name=\"Miguel\">[http://world-tourism.org/quality_/E/docs/trade/cubacontrib.pdf International Tourism and the Formation of Productive Clusters in the Cuban Economy Miguel Alejandro Figueras]  {{Dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The influx was due in large part to [[Cuba-United States relations|Cuba's proximity to the United States]], where restrictive [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] on [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and other pastimes stood in stark contrast to the island's traditionally relaxed attitude to leisure pursuits. A pamphlet published by E.C. Kropp Co., Milwaukee, WI, between 1921 and 1939 promoting tourism in Havana, Cuba, can be found in the University of Houston Digital Library, Havana, Cuba, The Summer Land of the World, Digital Collection.\n\nWith the deterioration of [[Cuba \u2013 United States relations]] and the imposition of the [[United States embargo against Cuba|trade embargo]] on the island in 1961, tourism dropped drastically and did not return to anything close to its pre-revolution levels until 1989. The revolutionary government in general, and [[Fidel Castro]] in particular, initially opposed any considerable development of the tourism industry, linking it to the debauchery and criminal activities of times past. In the late 1970s, however, Castro changed his stance and, in 1982, the Cuban government passed a foreign investment code which opened a number of sectors, tourism included, to foreign capital.\n\nThrough the creation of firms open to such foreign investment (such as ''Cubanacan''), Cuba began to attract capital for hotel development, managing to increase the number of tourists from 130,000 (in 1980) to 326,000 (by the end of that decade).\n\nHavana has also been a popular [[health tourism]] destination for more than 20 years. Foreign patients travel to Cuba, Havana in particular, for a wide range of treatments including [[eye-surgery]], [[neurological]] disorders such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[orthopaedics]]. Many patients are from Latin America, although medical treatment for [[retinitis pigmentosa]], often known as [[night blindness]], has attracted many patients from Europe and North America.<ref>[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html A Novel Tourism Concept] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128054658/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html |date=January 28, 2010 }} Caribbean News Net</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3284995.stm Cuba sells its medical expertise] BBC News</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Industry===\n[[File:Leyden freighter, Havana Harbor.jpg|thumb|left|M V Leyden freighter in the harbor]]\n[[File:Lonja del Comercio de La Habana vista desde la Avenida del Puerto.jpg|thumb|[[Lonja del Comercio building]]]]\nHavana has a diversified economy, with traditional sectors, such as manufacturing, construction, transportation and communications, and new or revived ones such as biotechnology and tourism.\n\nThe city's economy first developed on the basis of its location, which made it one of the early great trade centres in the New World. Sugar and a flourishing [[slave]] trade first brought riches to the city, and later, after independence, it became a renowned resort. Despite efforts by Fidel Castro's government to spread Cuba's industrial activity to all parts of the island, Havana remains the centre of much of the nation's industry.\n\nThe traditional sugar industry, upon which the island's economy has been based for three centuries, is centred elsewhere on the island and controls some three-fourths of the export economy. But light manufacturing facilities, meat-packing plants, and chemical and pharmaceutical operations are concentrated in Havana. Other food-processing industries are also important, along with shipbuilding, vehicle manufacturing, production of alcoholic beverages (particularly rum), textiles, and tobacco products, particularly the world-famous [[Habanos S.A.|Habanos]] cigars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macalester.edu/courses/geog61/jtahtinen/economy.html |title=The economy of Havana |publisher=Macalester.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> Although the [[harbour]]s of [[Cienfuegos]] and [[Matanzas]], in particular, have been developed under the revolutionary government, Havana remains Cuba's primary port facility; 50% of Cuban imports and exports pass through Havana. The port also supports a considerable fishing industry.\n\nIn 2000, nearly 89% of the city's officially recorded labour force worked for government-run agencies, institutions or enterprises. Havana, on average, has the country's highest incomes and human development indicators. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba re-emphasized tourism as a major industry leading to its recovery. Tourism is now Havana and Cuba's primary economic source.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf |title=Tourism in Cuba during the Special Period |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-17|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100725185350/http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf |archivedate = 2010-07-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHavana's economy is still in flux, despite Raul Castro's embrace of free enterprise in 2011. Though there was an uptick in small businesses in 2011, many have since gone out of business, due to lack of business and income on the part of the local residents, whose salaries average $20 per month.<ref>{{cite web|last=AP|title=Lack of Customers Dooms Many Cuban Businesses|url=http://weeklytimes.com/lack-of-customers-dooms-many-cuban-businesses/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228034327/http://weeklytimes.com/lack-of-customers-dooms-many-cuban-businesses/|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 December 2013|publisher=Weekly Times|accessdate=27 December 2013|date=27 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Commerce and finance===\nAfter the Revolution, Cuba's traditional capitalist free-enterprise system was replaced by a heavily socialized economic system. In Havana, Cuban-owned businesses and U.S.-owned businesses were nationalized and today most businesses operate solely under state control.\n\nIn Old Havana and throughout Vedado there are several small private businesses, such as shoe-repair shops or dressmaking facilities. Banking as well is also under state control, and the [[National Bank of Cuba]], headquartered in Havana, is the control center of the Cuban economy. Its branches in some cases occupy buildings that were in pre-revolutionary times the offices of Cuban or foreign banks.\n\nIn the late 1990s Vedado, located along the atlantic waterfront, started to represent the principal commercial area. It was developed extensively between 1930 and 1960, when Havana developed as a major destination for U.S. tourists; high-rise hotels, [[casino]]s, restaurants, and upscale commercial establishments, many reflecting the art deco style.<ref>{{cite web|title=De una casa colonial a una mansi\u00f3n del Vedado |url=http://www.paseosporlahabana.com/cats.asp?cID=83 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013131209/http://www.paseosporlahabana.com/cats.asp?cID=83 |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 October 2004 |accessdate=11 July 2011 |language=Spanish }}</ref>\n\n[[Vedado]] is today Havana's financial district, the main banks, airline companies offices, shops, most businesses headquarters, numerous high-rise apartments and hotels, are located in the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=britannica.com |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-624418/Vedado |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012165946/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-624418/Vedado |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 October 2007 |work=britannica.com|accessdate=11 July 2011 }}</ref> The University of Havana is located in Vedado.\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Iglesia del Santo Angel, La Habana Vieja.jpg|thumb|left|[[Santo Angel Custodio Church]]]]\n[[File:Catedral Ortodoxa Rusa Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Kaz\u00e1n, Cuba.jpg |thumb|left|[[Our Lady of Kazan Orthodox Cathedral|Russian Orthodox Cathedral Our Lady of Kazan]]]]\n{{Historical populations\n|type = \n|footnote =\n|1750 | 70000\n|1931 | 728500\n|1943 | 946000\n|1953 | 1223900\n|1960 | 1529800\n|1975 | 1917500\n|1981 | 1929400\n|1990 | 2107500\n|1997 | 2197700\n|2002 | 2204028\n|2005 | 2181324\n|2009 | 2141993\n|2012 | 2106146\n}}\n\nBy the end of 2012 official Census, 19.1% of the population of Cuba lived in Havana.<ref name=Official_census /> According to the census of 2012, the population was 2,106,146<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[http://www.one.cu/publicaciones/cepde/cpv2012/20131107resumenadelantado/Tablas/4.pdf 2012 Official Census] \u2013 Province, City and ethnic group</ref> The city has an average [[life expectancy]] of 76.81 years at birth.<ref name=Official_census /> In 2009, there were 1,924 people living with [[HIV]]/AIDS in the city, 78.9% of these are men, and 21.1% being women.<ref>[http://www.one.cu/publicaciones/cepde/EncuestaSida/Informe%20resumen%20de%20la%20Encuesta%20a%20PVs%202009.pdf Official Census, people living with HIV/AIDS in Havana]</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2012 official census (the Cuban census and similar studies use the term \"skin colour\" instead of \"race\").<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n* [[White people#Cuba|White]]: 58.4%, ([[Spaniards|Spanish]] descent were most common)<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/><ref name=immigracion>[http://embacuba.cubaminrex.cu/Default.aspx?tabid=5598 Embassy of Cuba in Beijing \u2013 History of Immigration in Cuba] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203174406/http://embacuba.cubaminrex.cu/Default.aspx?tabid=5598 |date=2009-02-03 }} \"The first (immigrants) came from various regions of Spain, mostly peasants from the Canaries and Galicia, which like those from China, were subjected to conditions of living and working conditions similar to those of slaves.\"</ref>\n* ''[[Mestizo]] or [[Mulatto]]'' (mixed race): 26.4%\n* [[Afro-Cuban|Black]]: 15.2%\n* [[Chinese Cuban|Asian]]: 0.2%<ref name=immigracion/>\n\nThere are few [[mestizos]] in contrast to many other [[Latin American]] countries, because the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Indian]] population was virtually wiped out by Eurasian diseases in colonial times.<ref>{{Cite book|first = Joseph Patrick|last=Byrne|title= Encyclopedia of Pestilence, Pandemics, and Plagues: A\u2013M|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kRAInwEACAAJ|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year = 2008|page = 413|isbn = 0-313-34102-8}}\n</ref>\n\nHavana agglomeration grew rapidly during the first half of the 20th century reaching 1 million inhabitants in the 1943 census.

Moreover, the all-embracing authority of many national institutions has led to a declining role for the city government, which, nevertheless, still provides much of the essential services and has competences in education, health care, city public transport, garbage collection, small industry, agriculture, etc.\n\nVoters elect delegates to Municipal Assemblies in competitive elections. There is only one political party, the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party]], but since there must be a minimum of two candidates, members of the Communist Party often run against each other. Candidates are not required to be members of the party. They are nominated directly by citizens in open meetings within each election district. Municipal Assembly delegates in turn elect members of the Provincial Assembly, which in Havana serves roughly as the City Council; its president functions as the Mayor. There are direct elections for deputies to the National Assembly based on slates, and a portion of the candidates is nominated at the local level. The People's Councils (Consejos Populares) consist of local municipal delegates who elect a full-time representative to preside over the body. In addition, there is participation from \"mass organisations\" and representatives of local government agencies, industries and services. The 105 People's Councils in Havana cover an average of 20,000 residents.\n\nHavana city borders are contiguous with the [[Mayabeque Province]] on the south and east and to [[Artemisa Province]] on the west, since former [[La Habana Province]] (rural) was abolished in 2010.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Education===\n[[File:University of Havana.JPG|thumb|[[University of Havana]]]]\n[[File:Facultad de Matem\u00e1ticas y Ciencias de la Computaci\u00f3n.JPG|thumb|Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, ''University of Havana'']]\n\n{{Further|Education in Cuba}}\nThe national government assumes all responsibility for education, and there are adequate primary, secondary, and vocational training schools throughout Cuba.

Wallace credits Davis as having helped to challenge and shape his creative approach to life as well as being his music instructor, mentor, and friend; he was the only trumpet player Davis personally mentored.\n\n==Biography==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=April 2018}}\nRoney was born in [[Philadelphia]] and attended [[Howard University]] and [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], after graduating from the [[Duke Ellington School of the Arts]] of the [[District of Columbia Public Schools|D. C. Public Schools]], where he studied trumpet with Langston Fitzgerald of the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]]. Found to have [[perfect pitch]] at the age of four, Wallace began his musical and trumpet studies at Philadelphia's Settlement School of Music.\n\nHe studied with trumpeter Sigmund Hering of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] for three years. Hering regularly presented Wallace at recitals at the Settlement School, and with the Philadelphia Brass Ensemble, during his studies in Philadelphia.\n\nWhen he entered the Duke Ellington School, Roney had already made his recording debut at age 15 with Nation and Haki Mahbuti, and at that time met, among others, [[Bill Hardman]], [[Valery Ponomarev]], [[Woody Shaw]] (who befriended him), [[Johnny Coles]] and [[Freddie Hubbard]]. He played with the [[Cedar Walton]] Quartet featuring [[Billy Higgins]], [[Sam Jones (musician)|Sam Jones]], and [[Philly Joe Jones]] at 16 years of age with the encouragement of his high school teacher.\n\nRoney had attained distinction as a gifted local performer in the Washington, D.C area. In 1979 and 1980, Roney won the [[Down Beat]] Award for Best Young Jazz Musician of the Year, and in 1989 and 1990 the ''Down Beat'' Magazine's Critic's Poll for Best Trumpeter to Watch.\n\nIn 1983, while taking part in a tribute to [[Miles Davis]] at the Bottom Line in Manhattan, he met his idol. \"He [Davis] asked me what kind of trumpet I had,\" Roney told ''Time'' magazine, \"and I told him none. So he gave me one of his.\" In 1984 and 1985, he was forced to play in Latin dance and reception bands, as the New York clubs, once a prominent part of the jazz scene, had mostly disappeared. But in 1986, he received a pair of calls, in the same month, to tour with drummers [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] and [[Art Blakey]], after which Roney became one of the most in-demand trumpet players on the professional circuit.\n\nIn 1986, he succeeded [[Terence Blanchard]] in Blakey's Jazz Messengers. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he was an integral part of Williams's quintet. In 1991, Roney played with Davis at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. After Davis's death that year, Roney toured in memoriam with Davis alumni [[Wayne Shorter]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Ron Carter]] and Tony Williams and recorded an album, ''[[A Tribute to Miles]]'', for which they won a [[Grammy Award]].\n\nRoney learned his craft directly from [[Miles Davis]]. Critics have taken Roney to task for sounding too similar to his idol. Roney recorded his debut album as a leader, ''Verses'', on [[Muse Records]] in 1987. A number of albums on Muse, [[Warner Bros. Records]] and [[Concord Records]]/[[Stretch Records]] followed, and by the time he turned 40 in 2000 Roney had been documented on over 250 audio recordings. Album titles in the 2000s have included ''Mystikal'' (2005) and ''[[Jazz (Wallace Roney)|Jazz]]'' (2007) on [[HighNote Records]]. His two most recent albums are ''A Place in Time'' (HighNote 2016) and ''Blue Dawn - Blue Nights'' (HighNote 2019), which features his nephew, drummer ''[[Kojo Roney]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\nWallace Roney is the son of Wallace Roney, [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] and President of the [[American Federation of Government Employees]] Local 102, grandson of Philadelphia musician Roosevelt Sherman, and older brother of tenor and soprano saxophonist [[Antoine Roney]]. In 1995, Roney married pianist [[Geri Allen]], with whom he had two daughters and a son. The marriage ended prior to Allen's death in 2017.<ref name=\"Guard\">{{cite news |last=Fordham |first=John |date=July 3, 2017 |title=Geri Allen Obituary  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/03/geri-allen-obituary |work=The Guardian |location= |accessdate=}}</ref> The two artists collaborated on records on many occasions during the 1990s and 2000s, on records released under each artist's name.\n\nEarlier in his life, Roney had been a resident of  [[Montclair, New Jersey]].<ref>Staudter, Thomas.

Wallace credits Davis as having helped to challenge and shape his creative approach to life as well as being his music instructor, mentor, and friend; he was the only trumpet player Davis personally mentored.\n\n==Biography==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=April 2018}}\nRoney was born in [[Philadelphia]] and attended [[Howard University]] and [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], after graduating from the [[Duke Ellington School of the Arts]] of the [[District of Columbia Public Schools|D. C. Public Schools]], where he studied trumpet with Langston Fitzgerald of the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]]. Found to have [[perfect pitch]] at the age of four, Wallace began his musical and trumpet studies at Philadelphia's Settlement School of Music.\n\nHe studied with trumpeter Sigmund Hering of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] for three years. Hering regularly presented Wallace at recitals at the Settlement School, and with the Philadelphia Brass Ensemble, during his studies in Philadelphia.\n\nWhen he entered the Duke Ellington School, Roney had already made his recording debut at age 15 with Nation and Haki Mahbuti, and at that time met, among others, [[Bill Hardman]], [[Valery Ponomarev]], [[Woody Shaw]] (who befriended him), [[Johnny Coles]] and [[Freddie Hubbard]]. He played with the [[Cedar Walton]] Quartet featuring [[Billy Higgins]], [[Sam Jones (musician)|Sam Jones]], and [[Philly Joe Jones]] at 16 years of age with the encouragement of his high school teacher.\n\nRoney had attained distinction as a gifted local performer in the Washington, D.C area. In 1979 and 1980, Roney won the [[Down Beat]] Award for Best Young Jazz Musician of the Year, and in 1989 and 1990 the ''Down Beat'' Magazine's Critic's Poll for Best Trumpeter to Watch.\n\nIn 1983, while taking part in a tribute to [[Miles Davis]] at the Bottom Line in Manhattan, he met his idol. \"He [Davis] asked me what kind of trumpet I had,\" Roney told ''Time'' magazine, \"and I told him none. So he gave me one of his.\" In 1984 and 1985, he was forced to play in Latin dance and reception bands, as the New York clubs, once a prominent part of the jazz scene, had mostly disappeared. But in 1986, he received a pair of calls, in the same month, to tour with drummers [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] and [[Art Blakey]], after which Roney became one of the most in-demand trumpet players on the professional circuit.\n\nIn 1986, he succeeded [[Terence Blanchard]] in Blakey's Jazz Messengers. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he was an integral part of Williams's quintet. In 1991, Roney played with Davis at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. After Davis's death that year, Roney toured in memoriam with Davis alumni [[Wayne Shorter]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Ron Carter]] and Tony Williams and recorded an album, ''[[A Tribute to Miles]]'', for which they won a [[Grammy Award]].\n\nRoney learned his craft directly from [[Miles Davis]]. Critics have taken Roney to task for sounding too similar to his idol. Roney recorded his debut album as a leader, ''Verses'', on [[Muse Records]] in 1987. A number of albums on Muse, [[Warner Bros. Records]] and [[Concord Records]]/[[Stretch Records]] followed, and by the time he turned 40 in 2000 Roney had been documented on over 250 audio recordings. Album titles in the 2000s have included ''Mystikal'' (2005) and ''[[Jazz (Wallace Roney)|Jazz]]'' (2007) on [[HighNote Records]]. His two most recent albums are ''A Place in Time'' (HighNote 2016) and ''Blue Dawn - Blue Nights'' (HighNote 2019), which features his nephew, drummer ''[[Kojo Roney]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\nWallace Roney is the son of Wallace Roney, [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] and President of the [[American Federation of Government Employees]] Local 102, grandson of Philadelphia musician Roosevelt Sherman, and older brother of tenor and soprano saxophonist [[Antoine Roney]]. In 1995, Roney married pianist [[Geri Allen]], with whom he had two daughters and a son. The marriage ended prior to Allen's death in 2017.<ref name=\"Guard\">{{cite news |last=Fordham |first=John |date=July 3, 2017 |title=Geri Allen Obituary  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/03/geri-allen-obituary |work=The Guardian |location= |accessdate=}}</ref> The two artists collaborated on records on many occasions during the 1990s and 2000s, on records released under each artist's name.\n\nEarlier in his life, Roney had been a resident of  [[Montclair, New Jersey]].<ref>Staudter, Thomas.

It is based on the [[Beetlejuice|1988 film of the same name]]. The story concerns a deceased couple who try to haunt the new inhabitants of their former home and call for help from a devious bio-[[exorcist]] ghost named [[Betelgeuse]] (pronounced \"Beetlejuice\"), who is summoned by saying his name three times. One of the new inhabitants is a young girl, Lydia, who is dealing with her mother's death and her neglectful father.\n\nThe musical had a tryout at the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]], [[Washington, D.C.]] in October 2018, prior to opening on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] on April 25, 2019. It is produced by Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures (a unit of franchise owner [[Warner Bros.]]). The show is scheduled to vacate the Winter Garden on June 6, 2020, but the producers are searching for a new Broadway house. A national tour is expected to begin in 2021.<ref>[https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Breaking-BEETLEJUICE-Announces-Closing-Date-National-Tour-Will-Launch-in-2021-20191209 Breaking: ''Beetlejuice'' Announces Closing Date; National Tour Will Launch in 2021] BWW News Desk, December 9, 2019</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n=== Act I ===\nA group of people at a graveyard mourn the passing of Emily Deetz. Emily's daughter, Lydia, reflects on the death of her mother and her own inability to be noticed by her father, Charles (\"Prologue: Invisible\"). A millennia old demon named Beetlejuice appears and mocks the idea of living life to the fullest, as it will all be worthless once death comes (\"The Whole \"Being Dead\" Thing\"). Beetlejuice then tells the audience how as a demon, he is invisible to all living beings unless he gets a living person to say his name three times, and reveals that he has come up with a plan to accomplish this.\n\nBeetlejuice then introduces Adam and Barbara Maitland. They are a normal married couple who desperately want to start a family, but are not emotionally ready and project their insecurities onto their hobbies. As Adam and Barbara reason to themselves why they're not ready for a child, they fall to their deaths through unstable floorboards in their home (\"Ready, Set, Not Yet\"). The ''Handbook for the Recently Deceased'' falls from the sky, but Beetlejuice burns it, wanting the newly deceased Maitlands to haunt their house and get a living person to say his name three times, which will allow him to be seen by all living beings. When Barbara and Adam awaken from their fatal fall and realize that they are dead, Beetlejuice reveals himself to the couple and offers to help them adjust to the Afterlife (\"The Whole \"Being Dead\" Thing, Pt. 2\"). Beetlejuice reveals to the Maitlands that the Deetzes have bought their house. He tells them that in order to remain in their house alone, they will have to scare the Deetzes away, and the Maitlands accept his help (\"The Whole \"Being Dead\" Thing, Pt. 3\").\n\nWhile moving in, Charles reveals to Lydia that he wants to start a gated community, using the house as a flagship model home, and is having a dinner party with some business friends. Lydia expresses her desire for her mother to return, mentioning the fact that nobody seems to care that she's gone. Praying for her mother to send a sign that she's still there, Lydia vows to make her father acknowledge the fact that tragedy struck their family (\"Dead Mom\"). In the attic, Beetlejuice is trying to teach the Maitlands how to be scary. Despite his best attempts, Barbara and Adam are not scary at all (\"Fright of Their Lives\"). Beetlejuice becomes frustrated with the couple and abandons them, and they vow to scare the Deetz family away themselves (\"Ready Set (Reprise)\"). Meanwhile, Delia, a woman who Charles hired to be Lydia's life coach and is secretly his lover, tells Lydia how everything happens for a reason, but fails to get her in a positive state of mind (\"No Reason\"). After their session, Lydia meets the Maitlands as they are roaming the house trying to scare the Deetzes. Lydia wants to leave the house just as much as the Maitlands want her family out, so she tries to convince her dad that the house is haunted only to find out that he and Delia are engaged.\n\nFeeling as if Charles is just trying to replace her mother, Lydia flees to the roof, where a depressed Beetlejuice laments that he will never be seen (\"Invisible (Reprise)\"). Beetlejuice becomes ecstatic when he realizes Lydia can see him and tries to convince her not to kill herself, with the intention of getting her to free him from his curse. Lydia teases Beetlejuice, but does not say his name. The Maitlands come to check on Lydia only to be possessed by Beetlejuice into saying positive things about him to further convince Lydia. Upon learning about [[Spirit possession|possession]] and that any ghost can do it, regardless of skill, Lydia decides not to work with Beetlejuice and instead work with the Maitlands to ruin Charles' dinner party (\"Say My Name\").\n\nAt the dinner party, Barbara and Adam possess Charles, Delia, and their guests (\"[[Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)]]\"). However, instead of being scared, the investors see the ghosts as a selling point, making them more interested in Charles' project. Feeling desperate, Lydia resorts to summoning Beetlejuice. Now visible to the living and able to affect the world around him, he forces the Maitlands to the attic before throwing Charles, Delia and the investors out of the house, much to Lydia's joy.\n\n=== Act II ===\nA [[Girl Scout]] named Sky explains to the audience how she has a heart condition where anything shocking could stop her heart but nevertheless is excited to be a Girl Scout. She rings the doorbell of the Deetzes' house to be greeted by Lydia, who invites her inside (\"Girl Scout\"). Beetlejuice appears and frightens the poor girl into leaving the house. He summons more versions of himself to help Lydia scare every visitor that comes into the house (\"That Beautiful Sound\"). Beetlejuice tells Lydia that now that she lives and works among the dead, she should also follow their rules, and gives her a copy of the ''Handbook for the Recently Deceased''. However, because she is not dead, Lydia can't open it. Lydia realizes the book could help her reunite with her mother, and runs to the attic for Barbara and Adam's help. Feeling once again alone and betrayed, Beetlejuice talks with his clones about how although he can be seen, he wants to leave the house to finally connect with people. He decides he must trick Lydia into marrying him, which will allow him to roam free in the living world (\"That Beautiful Sound (Reprise)\").\n\nIn the attic, Barbara and Adam help Lydia open the ''Handbook'', when they realize they should have gone straight to the Netherworld instead of remaining in their house. Adam opens the door to the Netherworld, but Barbara shuts it and the ''Handbook'', afraid of leaving the house. Lydia berates them because she hoped to use the book to summon her dead mother. She exits the attic in disappointment and anger. Barbara realizes that all of their fear has held the Maitlands back, and she and Adam decide to become bolder and better (\"Barbara 2.0\").\n\nDelia, Charles, and Delia's guru, Otho, re-enter the house to rescue Lydia, bringing a box that can supposedly trap souls. Beetlejuice tricks Lydia by telling her that reading a passage from the book will resurrect her mother, but instead she unknowingly begins an exorcism of Barbara and is forced to agree to marry Beetlejuice to stop it (\"The Whole \"Being Dead\" Thing, Pt. 4\"). Beetlejuice stops the exorcism and opens a door to the Netherworld to send the Maitlands away for good, but Lydia jumps through the door, with Charles following.  Enraged that his plan has failed again, he decides to kill everyone instead (\"Good Old Fashioned Wedding\").\n\nLydia and Charles enter the Netherworld to be greeted by Miss Argentina, who along with other Netherworld residents, urges her to return to the living world (\"What I Know Now\"). They then meet Juno, director of Netherworld Customs and Processing, who soon finds out they are still alive. Lydia runs from Juno, and frantically searches for her mother in the Netherworld, but is unable to find her. Charles finds Lydia in distress and reconciles with her (\"Home\").\n\nLydia and Charles return to the house where Beetlejuice is preparing to kill everyone. Lydia plans to trick Beetlejuice by marrying him, as Charles, Delia, and the Maitlands get him ready (\"Creepy Old Guy\"). The wedding brings Beetlejuice to life, allowing Lydia to stab him and kill him again, making him \"Recently Deceased\". Lydia and the Maitlands try to send him back to the Netherworld, but Juno appears, reveals herself as Beetlejuice's mother, and tries to take Lydia back with her. Beetlejuice stands up to Juno, having learned to appreciate life in his brief experience. Juno pretends to be moved by Beetlejuice's speech and throws him out of the house. The Maitlands, Charles, and Delia refuse to let Juno take Lydia. Beetlejuice then crashes through the wall riding a sandworm, which then eats Juno.\n\nBeetlejuice then says his last goodbyes to everyone before leaving. The Deetzes and Maitlands rejoice in their victory and agree to share the house as they clean up and repair the damages done to it. Lydia accepts that although her mother is gone, there is still so much left to enjoy in life (\"[[Jump in the Line (Shake, Senora)|Jump in the Line]]\").\n\n== Roles and principal casts ==\n=== Original production casts<!-- DO NOT ADD CAST MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT NOTABLE(bluelinked).

It is based on the [[Beetlejuice|1988 film of the same name]]. The story concerns a deceased couple who try to haunt the new inhabitants of their former home and call for help from a devious bio-[[exorcist]] ghost named [[Betelgeuse]] (pronounced \"Beetlejuice\"), who is summoned by saying his name three times. One of the new inhabitants is a young girl, Lydia, who is dealing with her mother's death and her neglectful father.\n\nThe musical had a tryout at the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]], [[Washington, D.C.]] in October 2018, prior to opening on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] on April 25, 2019. It is produced by Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures (a unit of franchise owner [[Warner Bros.]]). The show is scheduled to vacate the Winter Garden on June 6, 2020, but the producers are searching for a new Broadway house. A national tour is expected to begin in 2021.<ref>[https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Breaking-BEETLEJUICE-Announces-Closing-Date-National-Tour-Will-Launch-in-2021-20191209 Breaking: ''Beetlejuice'' Announces Closing Date; National Tour Will Launch in 2021] BWW News Desk, December 9, 2019</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n=== Act I ===\nA group of people at a graveyard mourn the passing of Emily Deetz. Emily's daughter, Lydia, reflects on the death of her mother and her own inability to be noticed by her father, Charles (\"Prologue: Invisible\"). A millennia old demon named Beetlejuice appears and mocks the idea of living life to the fullest, as it will all be worthless once death comes (\"The Whole \"Being Dead\" Thing\"). Beetlejuice then tells the audience how as a demon, he is invisible to all living beings unless he gets a living person to say his name three times, and reveals that he has come up with a plan to accomplish this.\n\nBeetlejuice then introduces Adam and Barbara Maitland. They are a normal married couple who desperately want to start a family, but are not emotionally ready and project their insecurities onto their hobbies. As Adam and Barbara reason to themselves why they're not ready for a child, they fall to their deaths through unstable floorboards in their home (\"Ready, Set, Not Yet\"). The ''Handbook for the Recently Deceased'' falls from the sky, but Beetlejuice burns it, wanting the newly deceased Maitlands to haunt their house and get a living person to say his name three times, which will allow him to be seen by all living beings. When Barbara and Adam awaken from their fatal fall and realize that they are dead, Beetlejuice reveals himself to the couple and offers to help them adjust to the Afterlife (\"The Whole \"Being Dead\" Thing, Pt. 2\"). Beetlejuice reveals to the Maitlands that the Deetzes have bought their house. He tells them that in order to remain in their house alone, they will have to scare the Deetzes away, and the Maitlands accept his help (\"The Whole \"Being Dead\" Thing, Pt. 3\").\n\nWhile moving in, Charles reveals to Lydia that he wants to start a gated community, using the house as a flagship model home, and is having a dinner party with some business friends. Lydia expresses her desire for her mother to return, mentioning the fact that nobody seems to care that she's gone. Praying for her mother to send a sign that she's still there, Lydia vows to make her father acknowledge the fact that tragedy struck their family (\"Dead Mom\"). In the attic, Beetlejuice is trying to teach the Maitlands how to be scary. Despite his best attempts, Barbara and Adam are not scary at all (\"Fright of Their Lives\"). Beetlejuice becomes frustrated with the couple and abandons them, and they vow to scare the Deetz family away themselves (\"Ready Set (Reprise)\"). Meanwhile, Delia, a woman who Charles hired to be Lydia's life coach and is secretly his lover, tells Lydia how everything happens for a reason, but fails to get her in a positive state of mind (\"No Reason\"). After their session, Lydia meets the Maitlands as they are roaming the house trying to scare the Deetzes. Lydia wants to leave the house just as much as the Maitlands want her family out, so she tries to convince her dad that the house is haunted only to find out that he and Delia are engaged.\n\nFeeling as if Charles is just trying to replace her mother, Lydia flees to the roof, where a depressed Beetlejuice laments that he will never be seen (\"Invisible (Reprise)\"). Beetlejuice becomes ecstatic when he realizes Lydia can see him and tries to convince her not to kill herself, with the intention of getting her to free him from his curse. Lydia teases Beetlejuice, but does not say his name. The Maitlands come to check on Lydia only to be possessed by Beetlejuice into saying positive things about him to further convince Lydia. Upon learning about [[Spirit possession|possession]] and that any ghost can do it, regardless of skill, Lydia decides not to work with Beetlejuice and instead work with the Maitlands to ruin Charles' dinner party (\"Say My Name\").\n\nAt the dinner party, Barbara and Adam possess Charles, Delia, and their guests (\"[[Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)]]\"). However, instead of being scared, the investors see the ghosts as a selling point, making them more interested in Charles' project. Feeling desperate, Lydia resorts to summoning Beetlejuice. Now visible to the living and able to affect the world around him, he forces the Maitlands to the attic before throwing Charles, Delia and the investors out of the house, much to Lydia's joy.\n\n=== Act II ===\nA [[Girl Scout]] named Sky explains to the audience how she has a heart condition where anything shocking could stop her heart but nevertheless is excited to be a Girl Scout. She rings the doorbell of the Deetzes' house to be greeted by Lydia, who invites her inside (\"Girl Scout\"). Beetlejuice appears and frightens the poor girl into leaving the house. He summons more versions of himself to help Lydia scare every visitor that comes into the house (\"That Beautiful Sound\"). Beetlejuice tells Lydia that now that she lives and works among the dead, she should also follow their rules, and gives her a copy of the ''Handbook for the Recently Deceased''. However, because she is not dead, Lydia can't open it. Lydia realizes the book could help her reunite with her mother, and runs to the attic for Barbara and Adam's help. Feeling once again alone and betrayed, Beetlejuice talks with his clones about how although he can be seen, he wants to leave the house to finally connect with people. He decides he must trick Lydia into marrying him, which will allow him to roam free in the living world (\"That Beautiful Sound (Reprise)\").\n\nIn the attic, Barbara and Adam help Lydia open the ''Handbook'', when they realize they should have gone straight to the Netherworld instead of remaining in their house. Adam opens the door to the Netherworld, but Barbara shuts it and the ''Handbook'', afraid of leaving the house. Lydia berates them because she hoped to use the book to summon her dead mother. She exits the attic in disappointment and anger. Barbara realizes that all of their fear has held the Maitlands back, and she and Adam decide to become bolder and better (\"Barbara 2.0\").\n\nDelia, Charles, and Delia's guru, Otho, re-enter the house to rescue Lydia, bringing a box that can supposedly trap souls. Beetlejuice tricks Lydia by telling her that reading a passage from the book will resurrect her mother, but instead she unknowingly begins an exorcism of Barbara and is forced to agree to marry Beetlejuice to stop it (\"The Whole \"Being Dead\" Thing, Pt. 4\"). Beetlejuice stops the exorcism and opens a door to the Netherworld to send the Maitlands away for good, but Lydia jumps through the door, with Charles following.  Enraged that his plan has failed again, he decides to kill everyone instead (\"Good Old Fashioned Wedding\").\n\nLydia and Charles enter the Netherworld to be greeted by Miss Argentina, who along with other Netherworld residents, urges her to return to the living world (\"What I Know Now\"). They then meet Juno, director of Netherworld Customs and Processing, who soon finds out they are still alive. Lydia runs from Juno, and frantically searches for her mother in the Netherworld, but is unable to find her. Charles finds Lydia in distress and reconciles with her (\"Home\").\n\nLydia and Charles return to the house where Beetlejuice is preparing to kill everyone. Lydia plans to trick Beetlejuice by marrying him, as Charles, Delia, and the Maitlands get him ready (\"Creepy Old Guy\"). The wedding brings Beetlejuice to life, allowing Lydia to stab him and kill him again, making him \"Recently Deceased\". Lydia and the Maitlands try to send him back to the Netherworld, but Juno appears, reveals herself as Beetlejuice's mother, and tries to take Lydia back with her. Beetlejuice stands up to Juno, having learned to appreciate life in his brief experience. Juno pretends to be moved by Beetlejuice's speech and throws him out of the house. The Maitlands, Charles, and Delia refuse to let Juno take Lydia. Beetlejuice then crashes through the wall riding a sandworm, which then eats Juno.\n\nBeetlejuice then says his last goodbyes to everyone before leaving. The Deetzes and Maitlands rejoice in their victory and agree to share the house as they clean up and repair the damages done to it. Lydia accepts that although her mother is gone, there is still so much left to enjoy in life (\"[[Jump in the Line (Shake, Senora)|Jump in the Line]]\").\n\n== Roles and principal casts ==\n=== Original production casts<!-- DO NOT ADD CAST MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT NOTABLE(bluelinked).

This reworked incarnation, under Alex Timbers's direction, breathes slightly more enjoyably even as it remains too faithful to the pumped-up inclinations of book writers Scott Brown and Anthony King and composer-lyricist Eddie Perfect. This means that the eager-to-please quotient of a musical about the quest by a bevy of souls, alive and dead, to alleviate loneliness, is still amped up a bit too frantically. This may be of more concern to overly entertained theater analysts than to those musical-theater enthusiasts who thrive on the supercharged exertions of an ensemble on hyperdrive.

He was preceded by his father, [[Sin-Muballit]], who abdicated due to failing health. During his reign, he conquered [[Elam]] and the city-states of [[Larsa]], [[Eshnunna]], and [[Mari, Syria|Mari]]. He ousted [[Ishme-Dagan I]], the king of [[Assyria]], and forced his son [[Mut-Ashkur]] to pay tribute, bringing almost all of [[Mesopotamia]] under [[Babylonia]]n rule.<ref>{{cite book |first=Roger B. |last=Beck |first2=Linda |last2=Black |first3=Larry S. |last3=Krieger |first4=Phillip C. |last4=Naylor |first5=Dahia Ibo |last5=Shabaka |title=World History: Patterns of Interaction |url=https://archive.org/details/mcdougallittellw00beck |url-access=registration |publisher=[[McDougal Littell]] |year=1999 |location=Evanston, IL |isbn=978-0-395-87274-1 |oclc=39762695}}</ref>\n\nHammurabi is best known for having issued the [[Code of Hammurabi]], which he claimed to have received from [[Shamash]], the Babylonian god of justice. Unlike earlier [[Sumer]]ian law codes, such as the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]], which had focused on compensating the victim of the crime, the Law of Hammurabi was one of the first law codes to place greater emphasis on the physical punishment of the perpetrator. It prescribed specific penalties for each crime and is among the first codes to establish the [[presumption of innocence]]. Although its penalties are extremely harsh by modern standards, they were intended to limit what a wronged person was permitted to do in [[Retributive justice|retribution]]. The Code of Hammurabi and the [[Law of Moses]] in the [[Torah]] contain numerous similarities.\n\nHammurabi was seen by many as a god within his own lifetime. After his death, Hammurabi was revered as a great conqueror who spread civilization and forced all peoples to pay obeisance to [[Marduk]], the [[national god]] of the Babylonians. Later, his military accomplishments became de-emphasized and his role as the ideal lawgiver became the primary aspect of his legacy. For later Mesopotamians, Hammurabi's reign became the frame of reference for all events occurring in the distant past. Even after the empire he built collapsed, he was still revered as a model ruler, and many kings across the Near East claimed him as an ancestor. Hammurabi was rediscovered by archaeologists in the late nineteenth century and has since become seen as an important figure in the history of law.\n\n== Reign and conquests ==\n[[File:Hammurabi's Babylonia 1.svg|thumb|left|Map showing the Babylonian territory upon Hammurabi's ascension in {{circa|1792 BC}} and upon his death in {{circa|1750 BC}}]]\nHammurabi was an [[Amorite]] [[First Babylonian dynasty|First Dynasty]] king of the [[city-state]] of Babylon, and inherited the power from his father, [[Sin-Muballit]], in {{circa|1792 BC}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=1}}</ref> Babylon was one of the many largely Amorite ruled city-states that dotted the central and southern Mesopotamian plains and waged war on each other for control of fertile [[agriculture|agricultural]] land.<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop |2005|pp=1\u20132}}</ref> Though many cultures co-existed in Mesopotamia, Babylonian culture gained a degree of prominence among the [[literacy|literate]] classes throughout the [[Middle East]] under Hammurabi.<ref name=\"VM3\">{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=3}}</ref> The kings who came before Hammurabi had founded a relatively minor City State in 1894 BC, which controlled little territory outside of the city itself. Babylon was overshadowed by older, larger, and more powerful kingdoms such as [[Elam]], [[Assyria]], [[Isin]], [[Eshnunna]], and [[Larsa]] for a century or so after its founding. However, his father [[Sin-Muballit]] had begun to consolidate rule of a small area of south central Mesopotamia under Babylonian [[hegemony]] and, by the time of his reign, had conquered the minor city-states of [[Borsippa]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], and [[Sippar]].<ref name=\"VM3\" />\n\nThus Hammurabi ascended to the throne as the king of a minor kingdom in the midst of a complex [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] situation. The powerful kingdom of [[Eshnunna]] controlled the upper Tigris River while [[Larsa]] controlled the river delta. To the east of Mesopotamia lay the powerful kingdom of [[Elam]], which regularly invaded and forced tribute upon the small states of southern Mesopotamia. In northern Mesopotamia, the [[Assyria]]n king [[Shamshi-Adad I]], who had already inherited centuries old Assyrian colonies in [[Asia Minor]], had expanded his territory into the [[Levant]] and central [[Mesopotamia]],<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp=3\u20134}}</ref> although his untimely death would somewhat fragment his empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=16}}</ref>\n\nThe first few years of Hammurabi's reign were quite peaceful.

Hammurabi's reign became the point of reference for all events in the distant past. A hymn to the goddess [[Inanna|Ishtar]], whose language suggests it was written during the reign of [[Ammi-Saduqa|Ammisaduqa]], Hammurabi's fourth successor, declares: \"The king who first heard this song as a song of your heroism is Hammurabi.

In northern Mesopotamia, both the Amorites and Babylonians were driven from [[Assyria]] by [[Puzur-Sin]] a native [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-speaking ruler, {{circa|1740 BC}}. Around the same time, native Akkadian speakers threw off Amorite Babylonian rule in the far south of Mesopotamia, creating the [[Sealand Dynasty]], in more or less the region of ancient Sumer. Hammurabi's ineffectual successors met with further defeats and loss of territory at the hands of Assyrian kings such as [[Adasi]] and [[Bel-ibni]], as well as to the Sealand Dynasty to the south, [[Elam]] to the east, and to the [[Kassites]] from the northeast. Thus was Babylon quickly reduced to the small and minor state it had once been upon its founding.<ref>Georges Roux \u2013 Ancient Iraq</ref>\n\nThe ''coup de grace'' for the Hammurabi's Amorite Dynasty occurred in 1595 BC, when Babylon was sacked and conquered by the powerful [[Hittite Empire]], thereby ending all Amorite political presence in Mesopotamia.<ref name=\"D19\">{{harvnb|DeBlois|1997|p=19}}</ref> However, the Indo-European-speaking Hittites did not remain, turning over Babylon to their [[Kassites|Kassite]] allies, a people speaking a [[language isolate]], from the [[Zagros mountains]] region. This [[Kardunia\u0161|Kassite Dynasty]] ruled Babylon for over 400 years and adopted many aspects of the [[Babylonia]]n [[culture]], including Hammurabi's code of laws.<ref name=\"D19\"/> Even after the fall of the Amorite Dynasty, however, Hammurabi was still remembered and revered.{{sfn|Van De Mieroop|2005|page=129}} When the Elamite king [[Shutruk-Nakhunte|Shutruk-Nahhunte I]] raided Babylon in 1158 BC and carried off many stone monuments, he had most of the inscriptions on these monuments erased and new inscriptions carved into them.{{sfn|Van De Mieroop|2005|page=129}} On the stele containing Hammurabi's laws, however, only four or five columns were wiped out and no new inscription was ever added.{{sfn|Van De Mieroop|2005|pages=129\u2013130}} Over a thousand years after Hammurabi's death, the kings of [[Suhum|Suhu]], a land along the Euphrates river, just northwest of Babylon, claimed him as their ancestor.{{sfn|Van De Mieroop|2005|page=130}}\n\n===Modern rediscovery===\n[[File:Hammurabi bas-relief in the U.S. House of Representatives chamber.jpg|thumb|upright|The bas-relief of Hammurabi at the United States Congress]]\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, the Code of Hammurabi became a major center of debate in the heated ''Babel und Bibel'' (\"Babylon and Bible\") controversy in Germany over the relationship between the Bible and ancient Babylonian texts.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=25}} In January 1902, the German Assyriologist [[Friedrich Delitzsch]] gave a lecture at the [[Sing-Akademie zu Berlin]] in front of the [[Kaiser]] and his wife, in which he argued that the Mosaic Laws of the Old Testament were directly copied off the Code of Hammurabi.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|pages=23\u201325}} Delitzsch's lecture was so controversial that, by September 1903, he had managed to collect 1,350 short articles from newspapers and journals, over 300 longer ones, and twenty-eight pamphlets, all written in response to this lecture, as well as the preceding one about the [[Gilgamesh flood myth|Flood story in the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'']]. These articles were overwhelmingly critical of Delitzsch, though a few were sympathetic. The Kaiser distanced himself from Delitzsch and his radical views and, in fall of 1904, Delitzsch was forced to give his third lecture in [[Cologne]] and [[Frankfurt am Main]] rather than in Berlin.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=25}} The putative relationship between the Mosaic Law and the Code of Hammurabi later became a major part of Delitzsch's argument in his 1920\u201321 book ''Die gro\u00dfe T\u00e4uschung'' (''The Great Deception'') that the Hebrew Bible was irredeemably contaminated by Babylonian influence and that only by eliminating the human Old Testament entirely could Christians finally believe in the true, [[Aryan]] message of the [[New Testament]].{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|pages=23\u201325}} In the early twentieth century, many scholars believed that Hammurabi was [[Amraphel]], the King of [[Shinar]] in the Book of Genesis 14:1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1440-amraphel|title=AMRAPHEL - JewishEncyclopedia.com|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2014&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Genesis 14 - New International Version|publisher=}}</ref> This view has now been largely rejected,<ref>{{cite book|last=North|first=Robert|editor1-last=Metzger|editor1-first=Bruce M.|editor2-last=Coogan|editor2-first=Michael D.|date=1993|title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780195046458/page/5 5]|chapter=Abraham|isbn=978-0-19-504645-8|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780195046458/page/5}}</ref><ref name=\"Graner\u00f8d2010\">{{cite book|last=Graner\u00f8d|first=Gard|title=Abraham and Melchizedek: Scribal Activity of Second Temple Times in Genesis 14 and Psalm 110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m5mlvNPexSEC&pg=PA114|date=26 March 2010|location=Berlin, Germany|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-022346-0|page=120|ref=harv}}</ref> and Amraphael's existence is not attested in any writings from outside the Bible.<ref name=\"Graner\u00f8d2010\"/>\n\nBecause of Hammurabi's reputation as a lawgiver, his depiction can be found in several United States government buildings.

Unlike earlier [[Sumer]]ian law codes, such as the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]], which had focused on compensating the victim of the crime, the Law of Hammurabi was one of the first law codes to place greater emphasis on the physical punishment of the perpetrator. It prescribed specific penalties for each crime and is among the first codes to establish the [[presumption of innocence]]. Although its penalties are extremely harsh by modern standards, they were intended to limit what a wronged person was permitted to do in [[Retributive justice|retribution]]. The Code of Hammurabi and the [[Law of Moses]] in the [[Torah]] contain numerous similarities.\n\nHammurabi was seen by many as a god within his own lifetime. After his death, Hammurabi was revered as a great conqueror who spread civilization and forced all peoples to pay obeisance to [[Marduk]], the [[national god]] of the Babylonians. Later, his military accomplishments became de-emphasized and his role as the ideal lawgiver became the primary aspect of his legacy. For later Mesopotamians, Hammurabi's reign became the frame of reference for all events occurring in the distant past. Even after the empire he built collapsed, he was still revered as a model ruler, and many kings across the Near East claimed him as an ancestor. Hammurabi was rediscovered by archaeologists in the late nineteenth century and has since become seen as an important figure in the history of law.\n\n== Reign and conquests ==\n[[File:Hammurabi's Babylonia 1.svg|thumb|left|Map showing the Babylonian territory upon Hammurabi's ascension in {{circa|1792 BC}} and upon his death in {{circa|1750 BC}}]]\nHammurabi was an [[Amorite]] [[First Babylonian dynasty|First Dynasty]] king of the [[city-state]] of Babylon, and inherited the power from his father, [[Sin-Muballit]], in {{circa|1792 BC}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=1}}</ref> Babylon was one of the many largely Amorite ruled city-states that dotted the central and southern Mesopotamian plains and waged war on each other for control of fertile [[agriculture|agricultural]] land.<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop |2005|pp=1\u20132}}</ref> Though many cultures co-existed in Mesopotamia, Babylonian culture gained a degree of prominence among the [[literacy|literate]] classes throughout the [[Middle East]] under Hammurabi.<ref name=\"VM3\">{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=3}}</ref> The kings who came before Hammurabi had founded a relatively minor City State in 1894 BC, which controlled little territory outside of the city itself. Babylon was overshadowed by older, larger, and more powerful kingdoms such as [[Elam]], [[Assyria]], [[Isin]], [[Eshnunna]], and [[Larsa]] for a century or so after its founding. However, his father [[Sin-Muballit]] had begun to consolidate rule of a small area of south central Mesopotamia under Babylonian [[hegemony]] and, by the time of his reign, had conquered the minor city-states of [[Borsippa]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], and [[Sippar]].<ref name=\"VM3\" />\n\nThus Hammurabi ascended to the throne as the king of a minor kingdom in the midst of a complex [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] situation. The powerful kingdom of [[Eshnunna]] controlled the upper Tigris River while [[Larsa]] controlled the river delta. To the east of Mesopotamia lay the powerful kingdom of [[Elam]], which regularly invaded and forced tribute upon the small states of southern Mesopotamia. In northern Mesopotamia, the [[Assyria]]n king [[Shamshi-Adad I]], who had already inherited centuries old Assyrian colonies in [[Asia Minor]], had expanded his territory into the [[Levant]] and central [[Mesopotamia]],<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp=3\u20134}}</ref> although his untimely death would somewhat fragment his empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=16}}</ref>\n\nThe first few years of Hammurabi's reign were quite peaceful.

In northern Mesopotamia, both the Amorites and Babylonians were driven from [[Assyria]] by [[Puzur-Sin]] a native [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-speaking ruler, {{circa|1740 BC}}. Around the same time, native Akkadian speakers threw off Amorite Babylonian rule in the far south of Mesopotamia, creating the [[Sealand Dynasty]], in more or less the region of ancient Sumer. Hammurabi's ineffectual successors met with further defeats and loss of territory at the hands of Assyrian kings such as [[Adasi]] and [[Bel-ibni]], as well as to the Sealand Dynasty to the south, [[Elam]] to the east, and to the [[Kassites]] from the northeast. Thus was Babylon quickly reduced to the small and minor state it had once been upon its founding.<ref>Georges Roux \u2013 Ancient Iraq</ref>\n\nThe ''coup de grace'' for the Hammurabi's Amorite Dynasty occurred in 1595 BC, when Babylon was sacked and conquered by the powerful [[Hittite Empire]], thereby ending all Amorite political presence in Mesopotamia.<ref name=\"D19\">{{harvnb|DeBlois|1997|p=19}}</ref> However, the Indo-European-speaking Hittites did not remain, turning over Babylon to their [[Kassites|Kassite]] allies, a people speaking a [[language isolate]], from the [[Zagros mountains]] region. This [[Kardunia\u0161|Kassite Dynasty]] ruled Babylon for over 400 years and adopted many aspects of the [[Babylonia]]n [[culture]], including Hammurabi's code of laws.<ref name=\"D19\"/> Even after the fall of the Amorite Dynasty, however, Hammurabi was still remembered and revered.{{sfn|Van De Mieroop|2005|page=129}} When the Elamite king [[Shutruk-Nakhunte|Shutruk-Nahhunte I]] raided Babylon in 1158 BC and carried off many stone monuments, he had most of the inscriptions on these monuments erased and new inscriptions carved into them.{{sfn|Van De Mieroop|2005|page=129}} On the stele containing Hammurabi's laws, however, only four or five columns were wiped out and no new inscription was ever added.{{sfn|Van De Mieroop|2005|pages=129\u2013130}} Over a thousand years after Hammurabi's death, the kings of [[Suhum|Suhu]], a land along the Euphrates river, just northwest of Babylon, claimed him as their ancestor.{{sfn|Van De Mieroop|2005|page=130}}\n\n===Modern rediscovery===\n[[File:Hammurabi bas-relief in the U.S. House of Representatives chamber.jpg|thumb|upright|The bas-relief of Hammurabi at the United States Congress]]\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, the Code of Hammurabi became a major center of debate in the heated ''Babel und Bibel'' (\"Babylon and Bible\") controversy in Germany over the relationship between the Bible and ancient Babylonian texts.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=25}} In January 1902, the German Assyriologist [[Friedrich Delitzsch]] gave a lecture at the [[Sing-Akademie zu Berlin]] in front of the [[Kaiser]] and his wife, in which he argued that the Mosaic Laws of the Old Testament were directly copied off the Code of Hammurabi.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|pages=23\u201325}} Delitzsch's lecture was so controversial that, by September 1903, he had managed to collect 1,350 short articles from newspapers and journals, over 300 longer ones, and twenty-eight pamphlets, all written in response to this lecture, as well as the preceding one about the [[Gilgamesh flood myth|Flood story in the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'']]. These articles were overwhelmingly critical of Delitzsch, though a few were sympathetic. The Kaiser distanced himself from Delitzsch and his radical views and, in fall of 1904, Delitzsch was forced to give his third lecture in [[Cologne]] and [[Frankfurt am Main]] rather than in Berlin.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=25}} The putative relationship between the Mosaic Law and the Code of Hammurabi later became a major part of Delitzsch's argument in his 1920\u201321 book ''Die gro\u00dfe T\u00e4uschung'' (''The Great Deception'') that the Hebrew Bible was irredeemably contaminated by Babylonian influence and that only by eliminating the human Old Testament entirely could Christians finally believe in the true, [[Aryan]] message of the [[New Testament]].{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|pages=23\u201325}} In the early twentieth century, many scholars believed that Hammurabi was [[Amraphel]], the King of [[Shinar]] in the Book of Genesis 14:1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1440-amraphel|title=AMRAPHEL - JewishEncyclopedia.com|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2014&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Genesis 14 - New International Version|publisher=}}</ref> This view has now been largely rejected,<ref>{{cite book|last=North|first=Robert|editor1-last=Metzger|editor1-first=Bruce M.|editor2-last=Coogan|editor2-first=Michael D.|date=1993|title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780195046458/page/5 5]|chapter=Abraham|isbn=978-0-19-504645-8|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780195046458/page/5}}</ref><ref name=\"Graner\u00f8d2010\">{{cite book|last=Graner\u00f8d|first=Gard|title=Abraham and Melchizedek: Scribal Activity of Second Temple Times in Genesis 14 and Psalm 110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m5mlvNPexSEC&pg=PA114|date=26 March 2010|location=Berlin, Germany|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-022346-0|page=120|ref=harv}}</ref> and Amraphael's existence is not attested in any writings from outside the Bible.<ref name=\"Graner\u00f8d2010\"/>\n\nBecause of Hammurabi's reputation as a lawgiver, his depiction can be found in several United States government buildings.

The battalion was formed by the conversion of the 10th ([[2nd East Riding Yeomanry|East Riding Yeomanry]]) Battalion, [[Green Howards]] to parachute duties in May 1943. They were then assigned to the [[5th Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Parachute Brigade]], alongside the [[7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion|7th]] and [[13th (Lancashire) Parachute Battalion|13th Parachute]] battalions, which was part of the [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|6th Airborne Division]].\n\nThey battalion took part in [[Operation Tonga]] during the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings]], capturing [[Ranville]] and held it against several German counter-attacks. It later fought in the [[Battle of Breville]], and played a part in the [[6th Airborne Division advance to the River Seine]], after which it was returned to England in September 1944. The battalion was deployed to the River Meuse with the 5th Parachute Brigade during the German [[Battle of the Bulge|Ardennes offensive]] in December. Its final mission in Europe was [[Operation Varsity]], the [[River Rhine]] crossing in March 1945. They then advanced further into Germany, and had reached the [[Baltic Sea]], when Germany surrendered.\n\nAfter the war in Europe the battalion was sent to the [[Far East]], taking part in operations in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Java]]. In 1946 the battalion rejoined the [[6th Airborne Division in Palestine]], where it was disbanded. In 1947 a new 12th Battalion was raised as part of the [[16th Airborne Division]] in the reformed [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]].\n\n==Formation==\nIn May 1943, the 10th ([[2nd East Riding Yeomanry|East Riding Yeomanry]]) Battalion, [[Green Howards]] was converted to parachute duties becoming the 12th (Yorkshire) Parachute Battalion, under the command of [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] R.G.

The companies were divided into a small headquarters and three [[platoon]]s. The platoons had three [[Bren machine gun]]s and three [[2-inch mortar]]s, one of each per [[section (military unit)|section]].<ref name=guard37/>  The only heavy weapons in the battalion were a [[Ordnance ML 3 inch Mortar|3&nbsp;inch mortar]] and a [[Vickers machine gun]] platoon.<ref>Peters, p.55</ref> By 1944 a headquarters or support company, was added to the battalion comprising five platoons: motor transport, signals, mortar, machine-gun and anti-tank.

Emphasis was given to physical fitness, [[marksman]]ship and [[fieldcraft]].<ref name=guard225>Guard, p.225</ref> A large part of the training regime consisted of [[assault course]]s and [[route marching]]. [[Military exercise]]s included capturing and holding airborne bridgeheads, road or rail bridges and coastal fortifications.<ref name=guard225/> At the end of most exercises, the battalion would march back to their barracks.

This left its three rifle companies with only thirty-five men between them.<ref name=\"Battalion diary\"/>\n\n===River Seine===\nAfter a period of rest and reorganisation the battalion rejoined the 5th Parachute Brigade in preparation for the breakout offensive towards the River Seine. On 20 July, the [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division]] moved into the line between the 6th Airborne Division and the [[51st (Highland) Division|51st (Highland) Infantry Division]]. On 7 August [[General officer commanding|GOC]] [[Richard Gale (British Army officer)|Richard Nelson Gale]] was ordered to prepare the 6th Airborne to move onto the offensive, they would be advancing on the left flank of the 49th Division, with their objective being the mouth of the River Seine. The three divisions east of the Orne together became [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]]; its commander, [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[John Crocker]], knowing that the 6th Airborne had almost no artillery, vehicles or engineer equipment, did not expect it to advance very quickly. To reach the Seine, the division would have to cross three major rivers.\n\nOn 17 August the [[3rd Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|3rd Parachute Brigade]] led the division's breakout from the start line, by 18 August the brigade had crossed the River Dives and reached the outskirts of Goustranville. Here the division halted, and the 5th Parachute Brigade took over the attack, their first objective being the village of Putot en Auge.<ref name=harclerode354>Harclerode, pg.354</ref> The [[13th (Lancashire) Parachute Battalion|13th Parachute Battalion]] attempted to carry out a bayonet assault on Hill 13 however they were forced to withdraw under heavy fire after a German counterattack.<ref name=harclerode356>Harclerode, p.356</ref> The [[7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion|7th Parachute Battalion]] secured the area east of Putot en Auge, while the 12th Parachute Battalion assaulted the village itself, taking 120 German prisoners and several heavy weapons.<ref name=harclerode356>Harclerode, p.356</ref>\n\nOn 21 August, the 3rd Parachute Brigade advanced towards the River Touques at Pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque facing very heavy resistance from German infantry and armour. Here the brigade held firm while the 5th Parachute Brigade advanced through them, and reached Pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque on 22 August. Both the 12th and 13th battalions attempted to force bridge heads across the Touques river.<ref>Harclerode, p.357</ref> Under the cover of a smoke barrage, the 12th Battalion attempted to cross at a railway embankment at Saint Jean.

The battalion was formed by the conversion of the 10th ([[2nd East Riding Yeomanry|East Riding Yeomanry]]) Battalion, [[Green Howards]] to parachute duties in May 1943. They were then assigned to the [[5th Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Parachute Brigade]], alongside the [[7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion|7th]] and [[13th (Lancashire) Parachute Battalion|13th Parachute]] battalions, which was part of the [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|6th Airborne Division]].\n\nThey battalion took part in [[Operation Tonga]] during the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings]], capturing [[Ranville]] and held it against several German counter-attacks. It later fought in the [[Battle of Breville]], and played a part in the [[6th Airborne Division advance to the River Seine]], after which it was returned to England in September 1944. The battalion was deployed to the River Meuse with the 5th Parachute Brigade during the German [[Battle of the Bulge|Ardennes offensive]] in December. Its final mission in Europe was [[Operation Varsity]], the [[River Rhine]] crossing in March 1945. They then advanced further into Germany, and had reached the [[Baltic Sea]], when Germany surrendered.\n\nAfter the war in Europe the battalion was sent to the [[Far East]], taking part in operations in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Java]]. In 1946 the battalion rejoined the [[6th Airborne Division in Palestine]], where it was disbanded. In 1947 a new 12th Battalion was raised as part of the [[16th Airborne Division]] in the reformed [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]].\n\n==Formation==\nIn May 1943, the 10th ([[2nd East Riding Yeomanry|East Riding Yeomanry]]) Battalion, [[Green Howards]] was converted to parachute duties becoming the 12th (Yorkshire) Parachute Battalion, under the command of [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] R.G.

The companies were divided into a small headquarters and three [[platoon]]s. The platoons had three [[Bren machine gun]]s and three [[2-inch mortar]]s, one of each per [[section (military unit)|section]].<ref name=guard37/>  The only heavy weapons in the battalion were a [[Ordnance ML 3 inch Mortar|3&nbsp;inch mortar]] and a [[Vickers machine gun]] platoon.<ref>Peters, p.55</ref> By 1944 a headquarters or support company, was added to the battalion comprising five platoons: motor transport, signals, mortar, machine-gun and anti-tank. With eight 3&nbsp;inch mortars, four Vickers machine guns and ten [[PIAT]] anti-tank projectors.<ref name=guard37>Guard, p.37</ref>\n\nAll members of the battalion had to undergo a twelve-day parachute training course carried out at [[No. 1 Parachute Training School RAF|No. 1 Parachute Training School]], [[RAF Ringway]]. Initial parachute jumps were from a converted [[barrage balloon]] and finished with five parachute jumps from an aircraft.<ref name=guard224/>{{#tag:ref|Barrage balloons were used to speed up training jumps and meet the target of 5,000 trained parachutists.<ref>Reynolds, p.16</ref>|group=nb}} Anyone failing to complete a descent was returned to his old unit.

So training was designed to encourage a spirit of self-discipline, self-reliance and aggressiveness. Emphasis was given to physical fitness, [[marksman]]ship and [[fieldcraft]].<ref name=guard225>Guard, p.225</ref> A large part of the training regime consisted of [[assault course]]s and [[route marching]]. [[Military exercise]]s included capturing and holding airborne bridgeheads, road or rail bridges and coastal fortifications.<ref name=guard225/> At the end of most exercises, the battalion would march back to their barracks. An ability to cover long distances at speed was expected: airborne platoons were required to cover a distance of {{convert|50|mi}} in 24 hours, and battalions {{convert|32|mi}}.<ref name=guard225/>{{#tag:ref|This ability was demonstrated in April 1945.

Two years later he received \"The best Romanian bass guitarist of the year\" award from the magazines \"Vox Pop Rock\" and \"Panoramic\".
