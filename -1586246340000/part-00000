A few passengers on the \"flight from hell\" turned out to have common colds or flu, with the other passengers coming to the belief that they were also sick after observing those around them.<ref>[https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinekee/sick-passengers-emirates-flight-dubai-nyc-quarantine A Flight From Dubai Carrying Dozens Of Sick Passengers Was Quarantined In New York]</ref><ref>[https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/on-the-media-2018-12-14 On the Media - Plague of Suspicion]</ref>\n*In August 2019 the BBC reported that schoolgirls at the [[Ketereh|Ketereh national secondary school]] (SMK Ketereh) in [[Kelantan]], [[Malaysia]], started screaming, with some claiming to have seen 'a face of pure evil'. Professor [[Simon Wessely]] a former president of the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] suggested it was a form of 'collective behaviour'. [[Robert Bartholomew]], a medical sociologist sugessted it was due to the stricter implementation of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] in the school. The school responded to the outbreak by cutting down the trees around the school, believing they were home to supernatural spirits.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48850490|title=The mystery of screaming schoolgirls in Malaysia|last=Chen|first=Heather|date=11 August 2019|work=BBC News|access-date=17 August 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n* Starehe Girls Centre, Kenya (October 2019) - 52 students were isolated with an unknown disease, showing symptoms of a high-pitched cough, sneezing and low-grade fever, a number that later rose to 68. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-10-04-starehe-girls-students-suffering-from-mass-hysteria-health-ministry/|title=Starehe girls diagnosed with mass hysteria\n|last=Agutu|first=Nancy|date=4 October 2019|work=The Star|access-date=5 October 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref> As the number rose, the school's administration shut the school down and instructed parents to pickup their daughters. Specimens collected from the affected students showed only two cases of rhinovirus, a virus that is the predominant cause of the common cold. After carrying out psychological assessments on the students, a team of mental health specialists dispatched by Kenya's Ministry of Health to the school concluded that the 'mysterious' disease was a case of mass hysteria.\n* Mass hysteria occured during the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]]. Millions of people rushed to groceries stores in order to purchase toilet paper, believing that the world would run out. People predicted millions of deaths and closed global economies, killing many businesses and jobs and causing mass anxiety, to later realize that the death toll would be not worse than the [[2009 swine flu pandemic]], which claimed 150,000 to 575,000 lives worldwide. <ref>https://www.wired.com/story/coronavirus-mass-panic-unlikely-pandemic/</ref><ref>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-and-philosophy/202003/why-toilet-paper/</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== See Also==\n\n* [[Body-centred countertransference]]\n* [[Conversion disorder]]\n* [[Folie \u00e0 deux]] (from the French for \"a madness shared by two\")\n* [[Hysterical contagion]] \n* [[Psychochemical weaponry]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bartholomew, Robert E.

In other words, clitics have the ''form'' of affixes, but the distribution of [[function word]]s. For example, the contracted forms of the auxiliary verbs in ''I'm'' and ''we've'' are clitics.\n\nClitics can belong to any grammatical category, although they are commonly [[pronoun]]s, [[determiner]]s, or [[adposition]]s. Note that [[orthography]] is not always a good guide for distinguishing clitics from affixes: clitics may be written as separate words, but sometimes they are joined to the word they depend on (like the Latin clitic ''-que'', meaning \"and\"), or separated by special characters such as [[hyphen]]s or [[apostrophe]]s (like the English clitic ''\u2019s'' in \"it's\" for \"it has\" or \"it is\").\n\n==Classification==\n{{confusing|section|reason=it is unclear which words or parts of words are clitics in the examples|date=July 2014}}\n\nClitics fall into various categories depending on their position in relation to the word they connect to.<ref name=\"crystal\" />\n\n=== Proclitic ===\n\nA proclitic appears before its host.<ref name=\"crystal\" /> It is common in Romance languages.

For example, in Portuguese, ''conquistar-'''se'''-\u00e1'' (\"it will be conquered\"), ''d\u00e1-'''lo'''-ei'' (\"I will give it\"), ''mat\u00e1-'''la'''-ia'' (\"he/she/it would kill her\"). These are found much more often in writing than in speech. It is even possible to use two pronouns inside the verb, as in ''dar-'''no'''-'''lo'''-\u00e1'' (\"he/she/it will give it to us\"), or ''dar-'''ta'''-ei'' (''ta'' = ''te'' + ''a'', \"I will give it/her to you\"). As in other [[Western Romance language]]s, the Portuguese synthetic future tense comes from the merging of the infinitive and the corresponding finite forms of the verb ''haver'' (from Latin ''hab\u0113re''), which explains the possibility of separating it from the infinitive.\n\n=== Endoclitic ===\n\nThe endoclitic splits apart the root and is inserted between the two pieces. Endoclitics defy the [[Lexical Integrity Hypothesis]] (or Lexicalist hypothesis) and so were long thought impossible. However, evidence from the [[Udi language]] suggests that they exist.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Harris\n | first = Alice C.\n | year = 2002\n | title = Endoclitics and the Origins of Udi Morphosyntax\n | publisher = Oxford University Press\n | location = Oxford\n | isbn=0-19-924633-5\n}}\n</ref> Endoclitics are also found in [[Pashto language|Pashto]]<ref>[[Craig Kopris|Craig A.

New York: Garland, 1992. N. pag. Print.</ref> This distinction is, however, disputed.<ref>Berm\u00fadez-Otero, Ricardo & John Payne (2011). There are no special clitics.

Amsterdam: John Benjamins.</ref>\n\n=== Simple clitics ===\n\nSimple clitics are free morphemes, meaning they can stand alone in a phrase or sentence.{{Example needed|date=December 2018}} They are unaccented and thus phonologically dependent upon a nearby word. They only derive meaning from this \"host\".<ref name=\"miller\" />\n\n=== Special clitics ===\n\nSpecial clitics are morphemes that are bound to the word they are dependent upon, meaning they exist as a part of their host.{{Example needed|date=December 2018}} This form, which is unaccented, represents a variant of a free form that does carry stress. While the two variants carry similar meaning and phonological makeup, the special clitic is bound to a host word and unaccented.<ref name=\"miller\" />\n\n==Properties==\nSome clitics can be understood as elements undergoing a historical process of [[grammaticalization]]:<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Hopper\n | first = Paul J.\n |author2=Elizabeth Closs Traugott\n | year = 2003\n | edition = 2nd\n | title = Grammaticalization\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n | location = Cambridge\n | isbn=978-0-521-80421-9}}\n</ref>\n\n{{in5}}lexical item \u2192 clitic \u2192 affix<ref name=\"klavans\">[[Judith Klavans|Klavans, Judith L.]] On Clitics and Cliticization: The Interaction of Morphology, Phonology, and Syntax. New York: Garland Pub., 1995. Print.</ref>\n\nAccording to this model from [[Judith Klavans]], an autonomous lexical item in a particular context loses the properties of a fully independent word over time and acquires the properties of a morphological affix (prefix, suffix, infix, etc.). At any intermediate stage of this evolutionary process, the element in question can be described as a \"clitic\". As a result, this term ends up being applied to a highly heterogeneous class of elements, presenting different combinations of word-like and affix-like properties.<ref name=\"klavans\" />\n\n===Prosody===\nOne characteristic shared by many clitics is a lack of [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] independence. A clitic attaches to an adjacent word, known as its ''host''. Orthographic conventions treat clitics in different ways: Some are written as separate words, some are written as one word with their hosts, and some are attached to their hosts, but set off by punctuation (a hyphen or an apostrophe, for example).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Comparison with affixes===\nAlthough the term \"clitic\" can be used descriptively to refer to any element whose grammatical status is somewhere in between a typical word and a typical affix, linguists have proposed various definitions of \"clitic\" as a technical term. One common approach is to treat clitics as words that are prosodically deficient: they cannot appear without a host, and they can only form an accentual unit in combination with their host. The term \"'''postlexical clitic'''\" is used for this narrower sense of the term.<ref>Klavans, Judith L. On Clitics and Cliticization: The Interaction of Morphology, Phonology, and Syntax. New York: Garland Pub., 1995. Print.</ref>\n\nGiven this basic definition, further criteria are needed to establish a dividing line between postlexical clitics and morphological affixes, since both are characterized by a lack of prosodic autonomy. There is no natural, clear-cut boundary between the two categories (since from a historical point of view, a given form can move gradually from one to the other by morphologization). However, by identifying clusters of observable properties that are associated with core examples of clitics on the one hand, and core examples of affixes on the other, one can pick out a battery of tests that provide an empirical foundation for a clitic/affix distinction.\n\nAn affix syntactically and [[phonology|phonologically]] attaches to a base [[morpheme]] of a limited [[part of speech]], such as a verb, to form a new word.  A clitic syntactically functions above the word level, on the [[phrase]] or [[clause]] level, and attaches only phonetically to the first, last, or only word in the phrase or clause, whichever part of speech the word belongs to.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Zwicky\n | first = Arnold\n | authorlink = Arnold Zwicky\n | year = 1977\n | title = On Clitics\n | publisher = Indiana University Linguistics Club\n | location = Bloomington}}\n</ref>\nThe results of applying these criteria sometimes reveal that elements that have traditionally been called \"clitics\" actually have the status of affixes (e.g., the Romance pronominal clitics discussed [[#Romance languages|below]]).<ref name=Spencer/>\n\nZwicky and Pullum postulated five characteristics that distinguish clitics from affixes:<ref name=Spencer/>\n# Clitics do not select their hosts.  That is, they are \"promiscuous\", attaching to whichever word happens to be in the right place.  Affixes do select their host:  They only attach to the word they are connected to semantically, and generally attach to a particular part of speech.\n# Clitics do not exhibit arbitrary gaps.  Affixes, on the other hand, are often lexicalized and may simply not occur with certain words.  (English plural -s, for example, does not occur with \"child\".)\n# Clitics do not exhibit morphophonological idiosyncrasies.  That is, they follow the morphophonological rules of the rest of the language.  Affixes may be irregular in this regard.\n# Clitics do not exhibit semantic idiosyncrasies.  That is, the meaning of the phrase-plus-clitic is predictable from the meanings of the phrase and the clitic.  Affixes may have irregular meanings.\n# Clitics can attach to material already containing clitics (and affixes).  Affixes can attach to other affixes, but not to material containing clitics.\nAn example of differing analyses by different linguists is the discussion of the possessive ('s) in English, some linguists treating it as an affix, while others treat it as a special clitic.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Clitics: An Introduction | first1=Andrew |last1=Spencer| first2=Ana R. |last2=Luis |isbn=9781139560313 |url= https://books.google.de/books?id=wLYgAwAAQBAJ |date= 2012 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |pages=292\u2013293|quote=There are two alternatives that have been explored in recent literature.}}</ref>\n\n===Comparison with words===\nSimilar to the discussion above, clitics must be distinguishable from words. Linguists have proposed a number of tests to differentiate between the two categories. Some tests, specifically, are based upon the understanding that when comparing the two, clitics resemble affixes, while words resemble syntactic phrases. Clitics and words resemble different categories, in the sense that they share certain properties. Six such tests are described below. These, of course, are not the only ways to differentiate between words and clitics.<ref name=\"zwicky\">Zwicky, Arnold M. \"Clitics and Particles.\" Language 61.2 (1985): 283\u2013305. Print.</ref>\n\n#If a morpheme is bound to a word and can never occur in complete isolation, then it is likely a clitic. In contrast, a word is not bound and can appear on its own.\n#If the addition of a morpheme to a word prevents further affixation, then it is likely a clitic.\n#If a morpheme combines with single words to convey a further degree of meaning, then it is likely a clitic. A word combines with a group of words or phrases to denote further meaning.{{Contradiction inline|reason=Further above it is said that clitics work on the phrase level. The English possessive, for example, attaches to a complete phrase.|date=October 2014}}\n#If a morpheme must be in a certain order with respect to other morphemes within the construction, then it is likely a clitic. Independent words enjoy free ordering with respect to other words, within the confines of the word order of the language.\n#If a morpheme's allowable behavior is determined by one principle, it is likely a clitic. For example, \"a\" precedes indefinite nouns in English. Words can rarely be described with one such description.\n#In general, words are more morphologically complex than clitics. Clitics are rarely composed of more than one morpheme.<ref name=\"zwicky\" />\n\n===Word order<!--'Wackernagel's Law' and 'Wackernagel's law' redirect here-->===\nClitics do not always appear next to the word or phrase that they are associated with grammatically. They may be subject to global word order constraints that act on the entire sentence. Many [[Indo-European languages]], for example, obey '''Wackernagel's law'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (named after [[Jacob Wackernagel]]), which requires sentential clitics to appear in \"second position\", after the first syntactic phrase or the first stressed word in a clause:<ref name=\"klavans\" />\n*[[Latin language|Latin]] had three enclitics that appeared in second or third position of a clause: ''enim'' 'indeed, for', ''autem'' 'but, moreover', ''vero'' 'however'.  For example, ''quis enim potest negare?'' (from [[Martial]]'s epigram LXIV, literally \"who indeed can deny [her riches]?\"). Spevak (2010) reports that in her corpus of [[Caesar]], [[Cicero]] and [[Sallust]], these three words appear in such position in 100% of the cases.<ref>Spevak, Olga (2010).

It was fully declined for gender, case and number. Since both the noun and enclitic were declined, this led to \"double declension\". The situation remains similar in modern [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], but in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], the enclitics have become [[Suffix#Inflectional suffixes|endings]]. Old Norse had also some enclitics of personal pronouns that were attached to verbs. These were ''-sk'' (from ''sik''), ''-mk'' (from ''mik''), ''-k'' (from ''ek''), and ''-\u00f0u'' / ''-du'' / ''-tu'' (from ''\u00fe\u00fa''). These could even be stacked up, e.g. \"f\u00e1sktu\" (from H\u00e1vam\u00e1l, stanza 116).\n*[[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''&#39;t'' definite article of neuter nouns and third person singular neuter pronoun, ''&#39;k'' first person pronoun, ''je'' second person singular pronoun, ''ie'' third person masculine singular pronoun, ''ze'' third person plural pronoun\n* [[Plautdietsch]]: ''\"Deit'a't vondoag?\"'': \"Will he do it today?\"\n*[[Gothic language|Gothic]]: Sentence clitics appear in second position in accordance with [[Wackernagel's Law]], including ''-u'' ([[yes-no question]]), ''-uh'' \"and\", ''\u00fean'' \"then\", ''\u0195a'' \"anything\", for example ''ab-'''u''' \u00feus silbin'' \"of thyself?\". Multiple clitics can be stacked up, and split a [[preverb]] from the rest of the verb if the preverb comes at the beginning of the clause, e.g. ''diz-'''uh-\u00fean'''-sat ij\u014ds'' \"and then he seized them (fem.)\", ''ga-'''u-\u0195a'''-s\u0113\u0195i'' \"whether he saw anything\".\n\n===Romance languages===\nIn [[Romance languages]], some feel the [[object (grammar)|object]] [[personal pronoun]] forms are clitics.

It is not used as a verb in the grammar of the sentence but introduces prepositional phrases and adds emphasis. It does not need to concord with the tense of the main verb, as in the second example, and can be usually removed from the sentence without affecting the simple meaning.\n\n===Proto-Indo-European===\nIn the [[Indo-European language]]s, some clitics can be traced back to [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]: for example, *''{{PIE|-k\u02b7e}}'' is the original form of [[Sanskrit]] ''[[wikt:\u091a|\u091a]]'' (''-ca''), [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wikt:\u03c4\u03b5|\u03c4\u03b5]]'' (''-te''), and [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:que#Latin|-que]]''.\n*Latin: ''[[wikt:-que#Latin|-que]]'' \"and\", ''[[wikt:-ve#Latin|-ve]]'' \"or\", ''[[wikt:-ne#Latin|-ne]]'' ([[yes-no question]])\n*Greek: ''[[wikt:\u03c4\u03b5|\u03c4\u03b5]]'' \"and\", ''[[wikt:\u03b4\u03ad|\u03b4\u03ad]]'' \"but\", ''[[wikt:\u03b3\u03ac\u03c1|\u03b3\u03ac\u03c1]]'' \"for\" (in a logical argument), ''[[wikt:\u03bf\u1f56\u03bd|\u03bf\u1f56\u03bd]]'' \"therefore\"\n\n===Slavic languages===\n*[[Russian language|Russian]]: [[wikt:\u043b\u0438|\u043b\u0438]] (yes-no question), [[wikt:\u0436\u0435|\u0436\u0435]] (emphasis), \u0442\u043e (emphasis), [[wikt:\u043d\u0435|\u043d\u0435]] \"not\" (proclitic), [[wikt:\u0431\u044b|\u0431\u044b]] (subjunctive)\n* [[Czech language|Czech]]: special clitics: weak personal and reflexive pronouns (''mu'', \"him\"), certain auxiliary verbs (''by'', \"would\"), and various short particles and adverbs (''tu'', \"here\"; ''ale'', \"though\"). \"''Nepoda\u0159ilo '''by se mi mu to''' d\u00e1t''\" \"I would not succeed in giving it to him\". In addition there are various simple clitics including short prepositions.\n* [[Polish language|Polish]]: ''[[wikt:by|-by]]'' (conditional mood particle), ''[[wikt:si\u0119|si\u0119]]'' (reflexive, also modifies meaning of certain verbs), ''[[wikt:no|no]]'' and ''[[wikt:\u017ce|-\u017ce]]'' (emphasis), ''-m, -\u015b, -\u015bmy, -\u015bcie'' (personal auxiliary), ''mi, ci, ci\u0119, go, mu'' &c. (unstressed personal pronouns in [[oblique case]]s)\n* [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: the [[reflexive pronoun]] forms ''si'' and ''se'', ''li'' (yes-no question), unstressed [[present]] and [[aorist]] tense forms of ''biti'' (\"to be\"; ''sam, si, je, smo, ste, su''; and ''bih, bi, bi, bismo, biste, bi'', for the respective tense), unstressed [[personal pronoun]]s in genitive (''me, te, ga, je, nas, vas, ih''), dative (''mi, ti, mu, joj, nam, vam, im'') and accusative (''me, te, ga (nj), je (ju), nas, vas, ih''), and unstressed present tense of ''htjeti'' (\"want/will\"; ''\u0107u, \u0107e\u0161, \u0107e, \u0107emo, \u0107ete, \u0107e'')\n\nIn [[Croatian language|Croatian]] these clitics follow the first stressed word in the sentence or clause in most cases, which may have been inherited from [[Proto-Indo-European]] (see [[Wackernagel's Law]]), even though many of the modern clitics became cliticised much more recently in the language (e.g. auxiliary verbs or the accusative forms of pronouns). In subordinate clauses and questions, they follow the connector and/or the question word respectively.\n\nExamples (clitics \u2013 ''sam'' \"I am\", ''biste'' \"you would (pl.)\", ''mi'' \"to me\", ''vam'' \"to you (pl.)\", ''ih'' \"them\"):\n\n* ''Poka\u017eite '''mi ih'''.'' \"Show (pl.) them to me.\" \n* ''Pokazao '''sam vam ih''' ju\u010der.'' \"I showed them to you (pl.) yesterday.\" \n* ''Sve '''sam vam ih''' (ju\u010der) pokazao. / Sve '''sam vam ih''' pokazao (ju\u010der).'' \"I showed all of them to you (yesterday).\" (focus on \"all\") \n* ''Ju\u010der '''sam vam ih''' (sve) pokazao.'' \"I showed (all of) them to you yesterday.\" (focus on \"yesterday\") \n* ''Znam da '''sam vam ih''' ve\u0107 pokazao.'' \"I know that I have already shown them to you.\" \n* ''Za\u0161to '''sam vam ih''' ju\u010der pokazao?'' \"Why did I show them to you yesterday?\" \n* ''Zar '''sam vam ih''' ju\u010der pokazao?'' \"Did I (really) show them to you yesterday?\" \n* ''Kad '''biste mi ih''' sada dali...'' \"If you (pl.) gave them to me now...\" (lit. If you-would to-me them now give-PARTICIPLE...) \n* ''\u0160to '''sam''' god vidio...'' \"Whatever I saw...\" (lit. What I-am ever see-PARTICIPLE...)\n\nIn certain rural dialects this rule is (or was until recently) very strict, whereas elsewhere various exceptions occur. These include phrases containing conjunctions (e. g. ''Ivan i Ana'' \"Ivan and Ana\"), nouns with a genitival attribute (e. g. ''vrh brda'' \"the top of the hill\"), proper names and titles and the like (e. g. ''(gospo\u0111a) Ivana Mari\u0107'' \"(Mrs) Ivana Mari\u0107\", ''grad Zagreb'' \"the city (of) Zagreb\"), and in many local varieties clitics are hardly ever inserted into any phrases (e. g. ''moj najbolji prijatelj'' \"my best friend\", ''sutra ujutro'' \"tomorrow morning\"). In cases like these, clitics normally follow the initial phrase, although some Standard grammar handbooks recommend that they should be placed immediately after the verb (many native speakers find this unnatural).\n\nExamples: \n* ''Ja '''smo''' i on oti\u0161li u grad.'' \"He and I went to town.\" (lit. I are and him gone to town) \u2013 this is dialectal. \n* ''Ja i on '''smo''' oti\u0161li u grad.'' \u2013 commonly heard\n* ''Ja i on oti\u0161li '''smo''' u grad.'' \u2013 prescribed by some Standard grammars\n* ''Moja '''mu je''' starija sestra to rekla.'' \"My elder sister told him that.\" (lit. my to-him is elder sister that say-PARTICIPLE) \u2013 standard and usual in many dialects \n* ''Moja starija sestra '''mu je''' to rekla.'' \u2013 common in many dialects\n\nClitics are however never inserted after the negative particle ''ne'', which always precedes the verb in Croatian, or after prefixes (earlier preverbs), and the interrogative particle ''li'' always immediately follows the verb. Colloquial interrogative particles such as ''da li'', ''dal'', ''jel'' appear in sentence-initial position and are followed by clitics (if there are any).\n\nExamples: \n* ''Ne vidim '''te'''.'' \"I don't (or can't) see you.\" \n* ''Dovedite '''ih'''.'' \"Bring them (over here)!\" (a prefixed verb: ''do+vedite'') \n* ''Vidi\u0161 '''li me'''?'' \"Do/can you see me?\" \n* ''Vidi\u0161 '''li''' sestru?'' \"Do you see the sister?\" (It is impossible to say, e. g. **Sestru li vidi\u0161?, although ''Sestru vidi\u0161.'' \"It's the sister that you see.\" is natural) \n* ''Jel '''(me)''' vidi\u0161?'' \"Do/Can you see (me)?\" (colloquial)\n\n==Other languages==\n*[[Arabic language|Arabic]]: Suffixes standing for direct object pronouns and/or indirect object pronouns (as found in Indo-European languages) are suffixed to verbs, possessive determiners are suffixed to nouns, and pronouns are suffixed to particles.\n*[[Finnish language|Finnish]]: Finnish has seven clitics, which change according to the [[Vowel harmony#Finnish|vowel harmony]]: ''-kO'' (''-ko ~ -k\u00f6''), ''-kA'' (''-ka ~ -k\u00e4''), ''-kin'', ''-kAAn'' (''-kaan ~ -k\u00e4\u00e4n''), ''-pA'' (''-pa'' ~ ''-p\u00e4''), ''-hAn'' (''-han ~ -h\u00e4n'') and ''-s''. One word can have multiple clitics attached to it: ''on'''kohan'''?'' \"'''I wonder''' '''if''' it is?\"\n**''-kO'' attached to a verb makes it a question: ''Katsot televisiota'' \"You are watching television\" \u2192 ''Katsot'''ko''' televisiota?'' \"Are you watching television?\"\n**''-kA'' gives the host word a colloquial tone: ''miten'' ~ ''miten'''k\u00e4''''' (\"how\"). When attached to a [[Negative verb#Finnish|negative verb]] it corresponds with \"and\": ''En pid\u00e4 mansikoista en'''k\u00e4''' mustikoista'' \"I don't like strawberries '''nor''' blueberries\". It can also make a negative verb stronger: ''En'''k\u00e4''' tule!'' \"I '''definitely''' won't come!\"\n**''-kin'' is a focus particle, often used instead of ''my\u00f6s'' (\"also\" / \"as well\"): ''Min\u00e4'''kin''' olin siell\u00e4'' \"I was there '''too'''\". Depending on the context when attached to a verb it can also express that something happened according to the plan or as a surprise and not according to the plan. It can also make exclamations stronger. It can be attached to several words in the same sentence, changing the focus of the host word, but can only appear once per sentence: ''Min\u00e4'''kin''' olin siell\u00e4'' (\"'''I''' was there '''too'''\"), ''Min\u00e4 olin'''kin''' siell\u00e4'' (\"'''Surprisingly''' I '''was''' there\"), ''Min\u00e4 olin siell\u00e4'''kin''''' (\"I was '''there''' '''too'''\")\n**''-kAAn'' is also a focus particle and it corresponds with ''-kin'' in negative sentences: ''Min\u00e4'''k\u00e4\u00e4n''' en ollut siell\u00e4'' \"I wasn't there '''either'''\". Like ''-kin'' it can be attached to several host words in the same sentence. The only word it cannot be attached to is a negative verb. In questions it acts as a confirmation, like the word ''again'' in English: ''Miss\u00e4 sanoit'''kaan''' asuvasi?'' \"Where did you say you lived '''again'''?\"\n**''-pA'' is a tone particle which can either add an arguing or patronising tone, or strengthen the host word:  ''Min\u00e4'''p\u00e4''' tied\u00e4n paremmin!'' \"Well I know better!\", ''On'''pa''' kaunis kissa!'' \"'''Wow''' what a beautiful cat!\"\n**''-hAn'' is also a tone particle. In interrogative sentences  it can make the question more polite and not as pressing: ''Onko'''han''' is\u00e4si kotona?'' \"('''I wonder''') Is your dad home?\" In command phrases it makes the command softer: ''Tule'''han''' t\u00e4nne'' \"Come here '''you'''\". It can also make a sentence more explanatory, make a claim more self-evident, express that something happened according to one's expectations, or that something came as a surprise etc. ''Pekka tuntee minut, on'''han''' h\u00e4n minun opettajani'' \"Pekka knows me, he is my teacher '''after all'''\", ''Kaikki'''han''' niin tekev\u00e4t'' \"Everyone do so '''after all'''\", ''Maija'''han''' se siin\u00e4!'' \"Oh but it is Maija!\" ''Luulin, ettette osaisi, mutta te'''h\u00e4n''' puhutte suomea hyvin'' \"I thought you wouldn't be able to, but you speak Finnish well\"\n** ''-s'' is a tone particle as well. It can also be used as a mitigating or softening phrase like ''-hAn'': ''Anniko'''s''' se on?'' \"'''Oh but''' isn't it Anni?\", ''Tule'''s''' t\u00e4nne'' \"Come here '''you'''\", ''Miksik\u00e4'''s''' ei?'' \"'''Well''' why not?\", ''Paljonko'''s''' kello on?'' \"'''I wonder''' what time it is?\"\n*[[Ganda language|Ganda]]: ''-nga'' attached to a verb to form the [[progressive aspect|progressive]]; ''-wo'' 'in' (also attached to a verb)\n*[[Georgian language|Georgian]]: ''-o'' (2nd and 3rd person speakers) and ''-metki'' (1st person speakers) is added to the end of a sentence to show reported speech. Examples: ''K'atsma miutxra, xval gnaxe-o'' = The man told me that he would see you tomorrow (Literally, \"The man told me, tomorrow I see you [reported]\") vs. ''K'atss vutxari, xval gnaxe-metki ='' I told the man that I would see you tomorrow (Literally, \"To man I told, tomorrow I see you [first person reported]).\n*[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: the marker of indirect questions is ''-e:'' ''Nem tudja m\u00e9g, j\u00f6n'''-e'''.'' \"He doesn't know yet '''if''' he'll come.\" This clitic can also mark direct questions with a falling intonation. ''Is'' (\"as well\") and ''se'' (\"not... either\") also function as clitics: although written separately, they are pronounced together with the preceding word, without stress: ''\u0150 is j\u00f6n.'' \"He'll come too.\" ''\u0150 sem j\u00f6n.'' \"He won't come, either.\"\n*[[Japanese language|Japanese]]: all [[Japanese particles|particle]]s, such as the [[genitive case|genitive]] [[postposition]] [[wikt:\u306e#Particle|\u306e]] (''no'') and the [[topic (linguistics)|topic]] marker [[wikt:\u306f#Particle|\u306f]] (''wa'').\n*[[Korean language|Korean]]: The copula [[wikt:\uc774\ub2e4|\uc774\ub2e4]] (''ida'') and the adjectival [[wikt:\ud558\ub2e4|\ud558\ub2e4]] (''hada''), as well as some nominal and verbal particles (e.g. [[wikt:\ub294|\ub294]], ''neun'').<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last        = Chae\n |first       = Hee-Rahk\n |year        = 1995\n |title       = Clitic Analyses of Korean \"Little Words\"\n |journal     = Language, Information and Computation Proceedings of the 10th Pacific Asia Conference\n |pages       = 97\u2013102\n |url         = http://www.oasis.go.kr/ctrlu?cmd=resource-downview&type=resource&old_flag=N&FN=maincc.hufs.ac.kr%2F_hrchae%2F6publi.htm&resourceNo=95577\n |accessdate  = 2007-03-28\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120207234322/http://www.oasis.go.kr/ctrlu?cmd=resource-downview&type=resource&old_flag=N&FN=maincc.hufs.ac.kr%2F_hrchae%2F6publi.htm&resourceNo=95577\n |archivedate = 2012-02-07\n}}\n</ref> However, alternative analysis suggests that the nominal particles do not function as clitics, but as phrasal affixes.<ref name=uiuc_Korean_particles>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.linguistics.uiuc.edu/jyoon/Papers/Affix-order-final-single.pdf\n| title = Non-morphological Determination of Nominal Particle Ordering in Korean\n| author = James Hye Suk Yoon\n| format = PDF\n| url-status = dead\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013419/http://www.linguistics.uiuc.edu/jyoon/Papers/Affix-order-final-single.pdf\n| archivedate = 2007-09-27\n}}</ref>\n*[[Somali language|Somali]]: pronominal clitics, either subject or object clitics, are required in Somali.

In other words, clitics have the ''form'' of affixes, but the distribution of [[function word]]s. For example, the contracted forms of the auxiliary verbs in ''I'm'' and ''we've'' are clitics.\n\nClitics can belong to any grammatical category, although they are commonly [[pronoun]]s, [[determiner]]s, or [[adposition]]s. Note that [[orthography]] is not always a good guide for distinguishing clitics from affixes: clitics may be written as separate words, but sometimes they are joined to the word they depend on (like the Latin clitic ''-que'', meaning \"and\"), or separated by special characters such as [[hyphen]]s or [[apostrophe]]s (like the English clitic ''\u2019s'' in \"it's\" for \"it has\" or \"it is\").\n\n==Classification==\n{{confusing|section|reason=it is unclear which words or parts of words are clitics in the examples|date=July 2014}}\n\nClitics fall into various categories depending on their position in relation to the word they connect to.<ref name=\"crystal\" />\n\n=== Proclitic ===\n\nA proclitic appears before its host.<ref name=\"crystal\" /> It is common in Romance languages.

For example, in Portuguese, ''conquistar-'''se'''-\u00e1'' (\"it will be conquered\"), ''d\u00e1-'''lo'''-ei'' (\"I will give it\"), ''mat\u00e1-'''la'''-ia'' (\"he/she/it would kill her\"). These are found much more often in writing than in speech. It is even possible to use two pronouns inside the verb, as in ''dar-'''no'''-'''lo'''-\u00e1'' (\"he/she/it will give it to us\"), or ''dar-'''ta'''-ei'' (''ta'' = ''te'' + ''a'', \"I will give it/her to you\"). As in other [[Western Romance language]]s, the Portuguese synthetic future tense comes from the merging of the infinitive and the corresponding finite forms of the verb ''haver'' (from Latin ''hab\u0113re''), which explains the possibility of separating it from the infinitive.\n\n=== Endoclitic ===\n\nThe endoclitic splits apart the root and is inserted between the two pieces.

Amsterdam: John Benjamins.</ref>\n\n=== Simple clitics ===\n\nSimple clitics are free morphemes, meaning they can stand alone in a phrase or sentence.{{Example needed|date=December 2018}} They are unaccented and thus phonologically dependent upon a nearby word. They only derive meaning from this \"host\".<ref name=\"miller\" />\n\n=== Special clitics ===\n\nSpecial clitics are morphemes that are bound to the word they are dependent upon, meaning they exist as a part of their host.{{Example needed|date=December 2018}} This form, which is unaccented, represents a variant of a free form that does carry stress. While the two variants carry similar meaning and phonological makeup, the special clitic is bound to a host word and unaccented.<ref name=\"miller\" />\n\n==Properties==\nSome clitics can be understood as elements undergoing a historical process of [[grammaticalization]]:<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Hopper\n | first = Paul J.\n |author2=Elizabeth Closs Traugott\n | year = 2003\n | edition = 2nd\n | title = Grammaticalization\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n | location = Cambridge\n | isbn=978-0-521-80421-9}}\n</ref>\n\n{{in5}}lexical item \u2192 clitic \u2192 affix<ref name=\"klavans\">[[Judith Klavans|Klavans, Judith L.]] On Clitics and Cliticization: The Interaction of Morphology, Phonology, and Syntax. New York: Garland Pub., 1995. Print.</ref>\n\nAccording to this model from [[Judith Klavans]], an autonomous lexical item in a particular context loses the properties of a fully independent word over time and acquires the properties of a morphological affix (prefix, suffix, infix, etc.). At any intermediate stage of this evolutionary process, the element in question can be described as a \"clitic\". As a result, this term ends up being applied to a highly heterogeneous class of elements, presenting different combinations of word-like and affix-like properties.<ref name=\"klavans\" />\n\n===Prosody===\nOne characteristic shared by many clitics is a lack of [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] independence. A clitic attaches to an adjacent word, known as its ''host''. Orthographic conventions treat clitics in different ways: Some are written as separate words, some are written as one word with their hosts, and some are attached to their hosts, but set off by punctuation (a hyphen or an apostrophe, for example).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Comparison with affixes===\nAlthough the term \"clitic\" can be used descriptively to refer to any element whose grammatical status is somewhere in between a typical word and a typical affix, linguists have proposed various definitions of \"clitic\" as a technical term. One common approach is to treat clitics as words that are prosodically deficient: they cannot appear without a host, and they can only form an accentual unit in combination with their host. The term \"'''postlexical clitic'''\" is used for this narrower sense of the term.<ref>Klavans, Judith L. On Clitics and Cliticization: The Interaction of Morphology, Phonology, and Syntax. New York: Garland Pub., 1995. Print.</ref>\n\nGiven this basic definition, further criteria are needed to establish a dividing line between postlexical clitics and morphological affixes, since both are characterized by a lack of prosodic autonomy. There is no natural, clear-cut boundary between the two categories (since from a historical point of view, a given form can move gradually from one to the other by morphologization). However, by identifying clusters of observable properties that are associated with core examples of clitics on the one hand, and core examples of affixes on the other, one can pick out a battery of tests that provide an empirical foundation for a clitic/affix distinction.\n\nAn affix syntactically and [[phonology|phonologically]] attaches to a base [[morpheme]] of a limited [[part of speech]], such as a verb, to form a new word.  A clitic syntactically functions above the word level, on the [[phrase]] or [[clause]] level, and attaches only phonetically to the first, last, or only word in the phrase or clause, whichever part of speech the word belongs to.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Zwicky\n | first = Arnold\n | authorlink = Arnold Zwicky\n | year = 1977\n | title = On Clitics\n | publisher = Indiana University Linguistics Club\n | location = Bloomington}}\n</ref>\nThe results of applying these criteria sometimes reveal that elements that have traditionally been called \"clitics\" actually have the status of affixes (e.g., the Romance pronominal clitics discussed [[#Romance languages|below]]).<ref name=Spencer/>\n\nZwicky and Pullum postulated five characteristics that distinguish clitics from affixes:<ref name=Spencer/>\n# Clitics do not select their hosts.  That is, they are \"promiscuous\", attaching to whichever word happens to be in the right place.  Affixes do select their host:  They only attach to the word they are connected to semantically, and generally attach to a particular part of speech.\n# Clitics do not exhibit arbitrary gaps.  Affixes, on the other hand, are often lexicalized and may simply not occur with certain words.  (English plural -s, for example, does not occur with \"child\".)\n# Clitics do not exhibit morphophonological idiosyncrasies.  That is, they follow the morphophonological rules of the rest of the language.  Affixes may be irregular in this regard.\n# Clitics do not exhibit semantic idiosyncrasies.  That is, the meaning of the phrase-plus-clitic is predictable from the meanings of the phrase and the clitic.  Affixes may have irregular meanings.\n# Clitics can attach to material already containing clitics (and affixes).  Affixes can attach to other affixes, but not to material containing clitics.\nAn example of differing analyses by different linguists is the discussion of the possessive ('s) in English, some linguists treating it as an affix, while others treat it as a special clitic.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Clitics: An Introduction | first1=Andrew |last1=Spencer| first2=Ana R. |last2=Luis |isbn=9781139560313 |url= https://books.google.de/books?id=wLYgAwAAQBAJ |date= 2012 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |pages=292\u2013293|quote=There are two alternatives that have been explored in recent literature.}}</ref> \n\n===Comparison with words===\nSimilar to the discussion above, clitics must be distinguishable from words. Linguists have proposed a number of tests to differentiate between the two categories. Some tests, specifically, are based upon the understanding that when comparing the two, clitics resemble affixes, while words resemble syntactic phrases. Clitics and words resemble different categories, in the sense that they share certain properties. Six such tests are described below. These, of course, are not the only ways to differentiate between words and clitics.<ref name=\"zwicky\">Zwicky, Arnold M. \"Clitics and Particles.\" Language 61.2 (1985): 283\u2013305. Print.</ref>\n\n#If a morpheme is bound to a word and can never occur in complete isolation, then it is likely a clitic. In contrast, a word is not bound and can appear on its own.\n#If the addition of a morpheme to a word prevents further affixation, then it is likely a clitic.\n#If a morpheme combines with single words to convey a further degree of meaning, then it is likely a clitic. A word combines with a group of words or phrases to denote further meaning.{{Contradiction inline|reason=Further above it is said that clitics work on the phrase level. The English possessive, for example, attaches to a complete phrase.|date=October 2014}}\n#If a morpheme must be in a certain order with respect to other morphemes within the construction, then it is likely a clitic. Independent words enjoy free ordering with respect to other words, within the confines of the word order of the language.\n#If a morpheme\u2019s allowable behavior is determined by one principle, it is likely a clitic. For example, \"a\" precedes indefinite nouns in English. Words can rarely be described with one such description.\n#In general, words are more morphologically complex than clitics. Clitics are rarely composed of more than one morpheme.<ref name=\"zwicky\" />\n\n===Word order<!--'Wackernagel's Law' and 'Wackernagel's law' redirect here-->===\nClitics do not always appear next to the word or phrase that they are associated with grammatically. They may be subject to global word order constraints that act on the entire sentence. Many [[Indo-European languages]], for example, obey '''Wackernagel's law'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (named after [[Jacob Wackernagel]]), which requires sentential clitics to appear in \"second position\", after the first syntactic phrase or the first stressed word in a clause:<ref name=\"klavans\" />\n*[[Latin language|Latin]] had three enclitics that appeared in second or third position of a clause: ''enim'' 'indeed, for', ''autem'' 'but, moreover', ''vero'' 'however'.  For example, ''quis enim potest negare?'' (from [[Martial]]'s epigram LXIV, literally \"who indeed can deny [her riches]?\"). Spevak (2010) reports that in her corpus of [[Caesar]], [[Cicero]] and [[Sallust]], these three words appear in such position in 100% of the cases.<ref>Spevak, Olga (2010).

(unstressed personal pronouns in [[Oblique case|oblique cases]])\n* [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: the [[reflexive pronoun]] forms ''si'' and ''se'', ''li'' (yes-no question), unstressed [[present]] and [[aorist]] tense forms of ''biti'' (\"to be\"; ''sam, si, je, smo, ste, su''; and ''bih, bi, bi, bismo, biste, bi'', for the respective tense), unstressed [[personal pronoun]]s in genitive (''me, te, ga, je, nas, vas, ih''), dative (''mi, ti, mu, joj, nam, vam, im'') and accusative (''me, te, ga (nj), je (ju), nas, vas, ih''), and unstressed present tense of ''htjeti'' (\"want/will\"; ''\u0107u, \u0107e\u0161, \u0107e, \u0107emo, \u0107ete, \u0107e'')\n\nIn [[Croatian language|Croatian]] these clitics follow the first stressed word in the sentence or clause in most cases, which may have been inherited from [[Proto-Indo-European]] (see [[Wackernagel's Law]]), even though many of the modern clitics became cliticised much more recently in the language (e.g. auxiliary verbs or the accusative forms of pronouns). In subordinate clauses and questions, they follow the connector and/or the question word respectively. \n\nExamples (clitics \u2013 ''sam'' \"I am\", ''biste'' \"you would (pl.)\", ''mi'' \"to me\", ''vam'' \"to you (pl.)\", ''ih'' \"them\"): \n\n* ''Poka\u017eite '''mi ih'''.'' \"Show (pl.) them to me.\" \n* ''Pokazao '''sam vam ih''' ju\u010der.'' \"I showed them to you (pl.) yesterday.\" \n* ''Sve '''sam vam ih''' (ju\u010der) pokazao. / Sve '''sam vam ih''' pokazao (ju\u010der).'' \"I showed all of them to you (yesterday).\" (focus on \"all\") \n* ''Ju\u010der '''sam vam ih''' (sve) pokazao.'' \"I showed (all of) them to you yesterday.\" (focus on \"yesterday\") \n* ''Znam da '''sam vam ih''' ve\u0107 pokazao.'' \"I know that I have already shown them to you.\" \n* ''Za\u0161to '''sam vam ih''' ju\u010der pokazao?'' \"Why did I show them to you yesterday?\" \n* ''Zar '''sam vam ih''' ju\u010der pokazao?'' \"Did I (really) show them to you yesterday?\" \n* ''Kad '''biste mi ih''' sada dali...'' \"If you (pl.) gave them to me now...\" (lit. If you-would to-me them now give-PARTICIPLE...) \n* ''\u0160to '''sam''' god vidio...'' \"Whatever I saw...\" (lit. What I-am ever see-PARTICIPLE...) \n\nIn certain rural dialects this rule is (or was until recently) very strict, whereas elsewhere various exceptions occur. These include phrases containing conjunctions (e. g. ''Ivan i Ana'' \"Ivan and Ana\"), nouns with a genitival attribute (e. g. ''vrh brda'' \"the top of the hill\"), proper names and titles and the like (e. g. ''(gospo\u0111a) Ivana Mari\u0107'' \"(Mrs) Ivana Mari\u0107\", ''grad Zagreb'' \"the city (of) Zagreb\"), and in many local varieties clitics are hardly ever inserted into any phrases (e. g. ''moj najbolji prijatelj'' \"my best friend\", ''sutra ujutro'' \"tomorrow morning\"). In cases like these, clitics normally follow the initial phrase, although some Standard grammar handbooks recommend that they should be placed immediately after the verb (many native speakers find this unnatural). \n\nExamples: \n* ''Ja '''smo''' i on oti\u0161li u grad.'' \"He and I went to town.\" (lit. I are and him gone to town) \u2013 this is dialectal. \n* ''Ja i on '''smo''' oti\u0161li u grad.'' \u2013 commonly heard\n* ''Ja i on oti\u0161li '''smo''' u grad.'' \u2013 prescribed by some Standard grammars \n\n* ''Moja '''mu je''' starija sestra to rekla.'' \"My elder sister told him that.\" (lit. my to-him is elder sister that say-PARTICIPLE) \u2013 standard and usual in many dialects \n* ''Moja starija sestra '''mu je''' to rekla.'' \u2013 common in many dialects \n\nClitics are however never inserted after the negative particle ''ne'', which always precedes the verb in Croatian, or after prefixes (earlier preverbs), and the interrogative particle ''li'' always immediately follows the verb. Colloquial interrogative particles such as ''da li'', ''dal'', ''jel'' appear in sentence-initial position and are followed by clitics (if there are any). \n\nExamples: \n* ''Ne vidim '''te'''.'' \"I don't (or can't) see you.\" \n* ''Dovedite '''ih'''.'' \"Bring them (over here)!\" (a prefixed verb: ''do+vedite'') \n* ''Vidi\u0161 '''li me'''?'' \"Do/can you see me?\" \n* ''Vidi\u0161 '''li''' sestru?'' \"Do you see the sister?\" (It is impossible to say, e. g. **Sestru li vidi\u0161?, although ''Sestru vidi\u0161.'' \"It's the sister that you see.\" is natural) \n* ''Jel '''(me)''' vidi\u0161?'' \"Do/Can you see (me)?\" (colloquial)\n\n==Other languages==\n*[[Arabic language|Arabic]]: Suffixes standing for direct object pronouns and/or indirect object pronouns (as found in Indo-European languages) are suffixed to verbs, possessive determiners are suffixed to nouns, and pronouns are suffixed to particles.\n*[[Finnish language|Finnish]]: Finnish has seven clitics, which change according to the [[Vowel_harmony#Finnish|vowel harmony]]: ''-kO'' (''-ko ~ -k\u00f6''), ''-kA'' (''-ka ~ -k\u00e4''), ''-kin'', ''-kAAn'' (''-kaan ~ -k\u00e4\u00e4n''), ''-pA'' (''-pa'' ~ ''-p\u00e4''), ''-hAn'' (''-han ~ -h\u00e4n'') and ''-s''. One word can have multiple clitics attached to it: ''on'''kohan'''?'' \"'''I wonder''' '''if''' it is?\"\n**''-kO'' attached to a verb makes it a question: ''Katsot televisiota'' \"You are watching television\" \u2192 ''Katsot'''ko''' televisiota?'' \"Are you watching television?\"\n**''-kA'' gives the host word a colloquial tone: ''miten'' ~ ''miten'''k\u00e4''''' (\"how\"). When attached to a [[Negative_verb#Finnish|negative verb]] it corresponds with \"and\": ''En pid\u00e4 mansikoista en'''k\u00e4''' mustikoista'' \"I don't like strawberries '''nor''' blueberries\". It can also make a negative verb stronger: ''En'''k\u00e4''' tule!'' \"I '''definitely''' won't come!\"\n**''-kin'' is a focus particle, often used instead of ''my\u00f6s'' (\"also\" / \"as well\"): ''Min\u00e4'''kin''' olin siell\u00e4'' \"I was there '''too'''\". Depending on the context when attached to a verb it can also express that something happened according to the plan or as a surprise and not according to the plan. It can also make exclamations stronger. It can be attached to several words in the same sentence, changing the focus of the host word, but can only appear once per sentence: ''Min\u00e4'''kin''' olin siell\u00e4'' (\"'''I''' was there '''too'''\"), ''Min\u00e4 olin'''kin''' siell\u00e4'' (\"'''Surprisingly''' I '''was''' there\"), ''Min\u00e4 olin siell\u00e4'''kin''''' (\"I was '''there''' '''too'''\")\n**''-kAAn'' is also a focus particle and it corresponds with ''-kin'' in negative sentences: ''Min\u00e4'''k\u00e4\u00e4n''' en ollut siell\u00e4'' \"I wasn't there '''either'''\". Like ''-kin'' it can be attached to several host words in the same sentence. The only word it cannot be attached to is a negative verb. In questions it acts as a confirmation, like the word ''again'' in English: ''Miss\u00e4 sanoit'''kaan''' asuvasi?'' \"Where did you say you lived '''again'''?\"\n**''-pA'' is a tone particle which can either add an arguing or patronising tone, or strengthen the host word:  ''Min\u00e4'''p\u00e4''' tied\u00e4n paremmin!'' \"Well I know better!\", ''On'''pa''' kaunis kissa!'' \"'''Wow''' what a beautiful cat!\"\n**''-hAn'' is also a tone particle. In interrogative sentences  it can make the question more polite and not as pressing: ''Onko'''han''' is\u00e4si kotona?'' \"('''I wonder''') Is your dad home?\" In command phrases it makes the command softer: ''Tule'''han''' t\u00e4nne'' \"Come here '''you'''\". It can also make a sentence more explanatory, make a claim more self-evident, express that something happened according to one's expectations, or that something came as a surprise etc. ''Pekka tuntee minut, on'''han''' h\u00e4n minun opettajani'' \"Pekka knows me, he is my teacher '''after all'''\", ''Kaikki'''han''' niin tekev\u00e4t'' \"Everyone do so '''after all'''\", ''Maija'''han''' se siin\u00e4!'' \"Oh but it is Maija!\" ''Luulin, ettette osaisi, mutta te'''h\u00e4n''' puhutte suomea hyvin'' \"I thought you wouldn't be able to, but you speak Finnish well\"\n** ''-s'' is a tone particle as well. It can also be used as a mitigating or softening phrase like ''-hAn'': ''Anniko'''s''' se on?'' \"'''Oh but''' isn't it Anni?\", ''Tule'''s''' t\u00e4nne'' \"Come here '''you'''\", ''Miksik\u00e4'''s''' ei?'' \"'''Well''' why not?\", ''Paljonko'''s''' kello on?'' \"'''I wonder''' what time it is?\"\n*[[Ganda language|Ganda]]: ''-nga'' attached to a verb to form the [[progressive aspect|progressive]]; ''-wo'' 'in' (also attached to a verb)\n*[[Georgian language|Georgian]]: ''-o'' (2nd and 3rd person speakers) and ''-metki'' (1st person speakers) is added to the end of a sentence to show reported speech. Examples: ''K'atsma miutxra, xval gnaxe-o'' = The man told me that he would see you tomorrow (Literally, \"The man told me, tomorrow I see you [reported]\") vs. ''K'atss vutxari, xval gnaxe-metki ='' I told the man that I would see you tomorrow (Literally, \"To man I told, tomorrow I see you [first person reported]).\n*[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: the marker of indirect questions is ''-e:'' ''Nem tudja m\u00e9g, j\u00f6n'''-e'''.'' \"He doesn't know yet '''if''' he'll come.\" This clitic can also mark direct questions with a falling intonation. ''Is'' (\"as well\") and ''se'' (\"not... either\") also function as clitics: although written separately, they are pronounced together with the preceding word, without stress: ''\u0150 is j\u00f6n.'' \"He'll come too.\" ''\u0150 sem j\u00f6n.'' \"He won't come, either.\"\n*[[Japanese language|Japanese]]: all [[Japanese particles|particle]]s, such as the [[genitive case|genitive]] [[postposition]] [[wikt:\u306e#Particle|\u306e]] (''no'') and the [[topic (linguistics)|topic]] marker [[wikt:\u306f#Particle|\u306f]] (''wa'').\n*[[Korean language|Korean]]: The copula [[wikt:\uc774\ub2e4|\uc774\ub2e4]] (''ida'') and the adjectival [[wikt:\ud558\ub2e4|\ud558\ub2e4]] (''hada''), as well as some nominal and verbal particles (e.g. [[wikt:\ub294|\ub294]], ''neun'').<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last        = Chae\n |first       = Hee-Rahk\n |year        = 1995\n |title       = Clitic Analyses of Korean \"Little Words\"\n |journal     = Language, Information and Computation Proceedings of the 10th Pacific Asia Conference\n |pages       = 97\u2013102\n |url         = http://www.oasis.go.kr/ctrlu?cmd=resource-downview&type=resource&old_flag=N&FN=maincc.hufs.ac.kr%2F_hrchae%2F6publi.htm&resourceNo=95577\n |accessdate  = 2007-03-28\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120207234322/http://www.oasis.go.kr/ctrlu?cmd=resource-downview&type=resource&old_flag=N&FN=maincc.hufs.ac.kr%2F_hrchae%2F6publi.htm&resourceNo=95577\n |archivedate = 2012-02-07\n}}\n</ref> However, alternative analysis suggests that the nominal particles do not function as clitics, but as phrasal affixes.<ref name=uiuc_Korean_particles>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.linguistics.uiuc.edu/jyoon/Papers/Affix-order-final-single.pdf\n| title = Non-morphological Determination of Nominal Particle Ordering in Korean\n| author = James Hye Suk Yoon\n| format = PDF\n| url-status = dead\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013419/http://www.linguistics.uiuc.edu/jyoon/Papers/Affix-order-final-single.pdf\n| archivedate = 2007-09-27\n}}</ref>\n*[[Somali language|Somali]]: pronominal clitics, either subject or object clitics, are required in Somali.

Schulz]]'s [[comic strip]] ''[[Peanuts]]''. The best friend of [[Charlie Brown]], Linus is also the younger brother of [[Lucy van Pelt]] and older brother of [[Rerun van Pelt]]. He first appeared on September 19, 1952, but was not mentioned by name until three days later. He was first referred to two months earlier, on July 14. Linus spoke his first words in 1954, the same year he was first shown with his [[security blanket]].\n\nWhen he was a [[costumed character]] in [[Mall of America]] during the [[Camp Snoopy]] years, he usually wore a blue baseball cap. It was removed from his head when he was redesigned.\n\nThe character's creator, [[Charles M. Schulz]], has said of the character, \"Linus, my serious side, is the house intellectual, bright, well-informed which, I suppose may contribute to his feelings of insecurity.\"\n\n[[Lee Mendelson]], producer of the majority of the ''[[Peanuts]]'' television specials, has said that Linus is his favorite character:<ref>{{cite web |last1=Best |first1=Nathan |title=EXCLUSIVE: Q & A With Charlie Brown's Lee Mendelson |url=https://www.comicbookmovie.com/animated_features/exclusive-q-a-with-charlie-browns-lee-mendelson-a115192 |work=Comic Book Movie |accessdate=19 July 2018 |date=12 February 2015}}</ref>\n{{Quote box| quote=He made sucking your thumb and holding a security blanket OK.

Linus is the only member of his group who believes in the [[Great Pumpkin]], an alternative [[Santa Claus]]\u2013like figure who, according to Linus, appears every [[Halloween]] arising from the most \"sincere\" pumpkin patch, bearing gifts. He occasionally temporarily convinces other characters the Great Pumpkin is real, only to stubbornly maintain his faith when they lose theirs. On one occasion, Linus had a commanding lead in the polls for school president\u2014until he brought up the subject of the Great Pumpkin, at which point he was nearly laughed out of the election. (He ended up winning anyway by one vote, cast by his opponent, who decided that Linus would make a better school president.) A similar occurrence was featured in a strip with the same storyline; Charlie Brown asks him why he had to bring up the Great Pumpkin and Linus gives his reasons. After Linus says that Charlie Brown is looking at him as if he was crazy, Charlie Brown responds, \"I'm looking at you like I could've been vice president!\"\n\nIn the strip from June 9, 1986, Linus claims that his birthday is in October. However, Lucy gives Linus a chair for his birthday in the November 22, 1964, Sunday strip.\n\n=== Security blanket ===\nLinus is almost never seen without his blue [[security blanket]], which debuted in the June 1, 1954, strip.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1954/06/01|title=Peanuts by Charles Schulz for June 01, 1954 {{!}} GoComics.com|last=Schulz|first=Charles|date=1954-06-01|website=GoComics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> He holds it over his shoulder while [[Thumb sucking|sucking his thumb]]. Ridicule of the habit is not a major concern for him. His friend Roy warned him at summer camp that he would be viciously teased for it; in response, Linus used his blanket like a [[whip]] and sheared off a tree branch with intimidating power, saying, \"They never tease me more than once.\" The blanket, it turns out, is an autonomous (although nonverbal) entity. In a 1965 strip, it engaged in a campaign of clandestine attacks on Lucy, even routing her from the house, due to her constant, albeit failed, attempts to get rid of it by throwing it in the trash burner. In the special ''[[A Boy Named Charlie Brown]]'', it performed a complex dance routine with Linus upon being reunited with its owner. Linus had lost the blanket, causing him depression, panic attacks, sweating and other withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIn the earlier strips, Linus's relationship to his blanket was one of intense emotional attachment to the point of manifesting physical symptoms if he was deprived of it even for a short while. He suffered weakness and dizziness, for example, when Lucy took it from him only long enough to have it laundered, spontaneously recovering when it was restored to him. In ''A Boy Named Charlie Brown'', Linus manifested similar symptoms when he gave his blanket to Charlie Brown. On another occasion, Lucy snatched his blanket away and buried it in an effort to break Linus of his habit. Linus dug around the neighborhood for days trying to find it until Snoopy finally found the blanket and dug it up.\n\nPossession of the blanket is often sought by [[Snoopy]], who has used many tricks and subterfuges to relieve Linus of it, even at one point having the blanket delivered to his doghouse. Snoopy commonly runs up, quickly grabs the blanket in his mouth, and drags Linus along with it, then swings him and the blanket around before letting go and sending them both soaring off. Once, Linus was so angry at Snoopy for snatching his blanket again and again that he retaliated by threatening Snoopy's supper dish. Upon hearing that Linus had possession of ''his'' most prized possession, Snoopy gave Linus back the blanket fairly quickly, thinking, ''\"I never dreamed he would fight so dirty!\"''. When Lucy buried the blanket, Snoopy took the time to dig for it himself; and when he found it, Linus thanked him, upon which Snoopy thought, ''\"Every now and then I feel that my existence is justified!\"'' Linus always wins and gets the blanket back.\n\nIn one strip, Lucy confiscates Linus's blanket, locking it in a closet for two weeks as part of a bet. Linus thinks he can go without the blanket for two weeks and laughs off Lucy and Charlie Brown's differing opinion. After one week Linus begins suffering, and freezing without it; he tries to use Snoopy's floppy ears but Lucy notices and tells him \"no substitutes!\" After eight days, Linus screams and cries for the blanket. Finally it appears that Linus has lost his mind; Charlie Brown persuades Lucy to give Linus his blanket back when they see Linus lying on the closet door scratching at it in a vain attempt to open it.\n\nFurthermore, there are many stories where Lucy and Linus's grandmother attempts to force him to give up the blanket, only to eventually concede in the face of his steadfast resistance. Two attempts were when the grandmother in question gave up smoking, and when she offered that if he gave up the blanket she would donate ten dollars to his favorite charity. The deal was not made because Linus did not consider it a fair proposition. In another strip, Lucy warns him that she has arrived. Linus reluctantly hands her the blanket and then goes into his room, and says, ''\"I decoyed her with a colored dish towel!\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1964/06/07|title=Peanuts by Charles Schulz for June 07, 1964 {{!}} GoComics.com|last=Schulz|first=Charles|date=1964-06-07|website=GoComics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>\n\nThe April 11, 1983, strip shows Linus saying that he had given up his blanket,<ref>{{cite web |title=Peanuts by Charles Schulz for Apr 11, 1983 |url=https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1983/04/11/ |website=GoComics |accessdate=3 June 2018 |language=en |date=11 April 1983}}</ref> and later going from door to door telling people how he gave up his blanket. Once, this results in the girl at the door lashing him with ''her'' blanket, in her anger. Twice before Linus actually vows to give up his blanket. Once he threw it away but grabbed it back; another time he was about to tell Charlie Brown about his new resolution when Charlie Brown ruined everything by tossing a blanket onto him. Trying again to give up the blanket, he left it on the side of the road and walked away, quickly running back to it because according to him, it was whimpering. In another effort to be rid of his habit, he has Snoopy hold on to it, who then makes it into [[Sport coat|sports coats]] for both him and [[Woodstock (Peanuts)|Woodstock]]. Just when he feels that he is over his blanket, Charlie Brown has him hooked again by giving him another one.\n\nIn one particularly angry confrontation over the issue (the aforementioned blanket-for-smoking episode) Linus admitted that if his mother ordered him to stop, he would comply; but no one else, especially Lucy or the \"blanket-hating\" grandmother, would have that authority. In fact, in that confrontation, when Lucy decided that he had gone without the blanket for two weeks and that he no longer needed it, she decided to throw it into the trash burner; Linus, however, was able to intervene at the last second and retrieve his blanket, reminding her that if their mother wanted him to give up the blanket he would do it, but until then it was nobody else's business. Never objecting, the mother was evidently content to let her unusually intelligent son grow out of the habit on his own. In later strips, Linus is shown with it less and less, and Schulz admitted in 1989 that Linus had finally outgrown the blanket, and it was only in the strip when required for the humor. In one comic, Linus suddenly stops sucking his thumb and says \"It's a good thumb, but not a great thumb.\" The special ''[[Why, Charlie Brown, Why?]]'', released the following year, is the only one in which Linus is never seen with his blanket; nor is it even mentioned, arguably to make Linus appear more mature given the special's serious subject. Eventually, however, he is reunited with it.\n\n==Appearance==\nLinus has brown hair and normally wears a red shirt with stripes on it, black shorts, and tennis shoes. On February 5, 1962, Linus began wearing [[eyeglasses]] after being diagnosed with [[myopia]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1962/02/05|title=Peanuts by Charles Schulz for February 05, 1962 {{!}} GoComics.com|last=Schulz|first=Charles|date=1962-02-05|website=GoComics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> but after the Sunday strip of September 9, 1962, the glasses were not seen again. In an earlier strip of July 17 1962, Linus had told Charlie Brown that his ophthalmologist said he may not have to wear his glasses all the time: thus explaining their eventual disappearance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1962/07/17|title=Peanuts by Charles Schulz for July 17, 1962 {{!}} GoComics.com|last=Schulz|first=Charles|date=1962-07-17|website=GoComics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>\n\n==Relationships==\n\n=== Charlie Brown ===\nLinus is Charlie Brown's best friend. Linus is sympathetic towards Charlie Brown, and often gives him advice after listening to Charlie Brown's various insecurities. Similarly, Charlie Brown generally observes Linus's faults, such as his undying faith in the Great Pumpkin, his dependence on his security blanket, or any of his other odd quirks. They are also together in an allegiance over a common enemy: Lucy, who harasses and torments Charlie Brown nearly as much as she does Linus. The two boys are often seen having discussions while sitting on a street curb or leaning up against the brick wall. At some point in the strip, Linus begins to appear sitting behind Charlie Brown in school, despite supposedly being a year younger.\n\nLinus generally plays second base on Charlie Brown's baseball team, but has substituted as pitcher for Charlie Brown when the latter has been unable to pitch. On these occasions, Linus's skill has served to propel the team onto an uncharacteristic winning streak.\n\n=== Crushes and admirers ===\nUpon the introduction of Charlie Brown's little sister, [[Sally Brown]], in 1959, Linus had the desire to marry her. However, as the strip progressed, he outgrew this idea, while Sally on the other hand fell in love with Linus, calling him her \"Sweet Babboo\", much to his displeasure. Linus in turn has an innocent [[unrequited love|crush]] on his school teacher, [[Miss Othmar]] (later Mrs. Hagemeyer). In some of the later 1990s strips he developed an interest in [[Lydia (character)|Lydia]], the girl who sits behind him, who keeps changing her name and, as Linus is two months older than she asks him, \"Aren't you kind of old for me?\" It was also Linus who first introduced [[Frieda (Peanuts)|Frieda]], as \"...a sort of a friend of mine\" who sat behind him in school. He also fell for several different girls in various animated [[television special]]s, as well as a girl called Truffles, whom he and Snoopy met while looking for the fungi bearing her name.[[File:Linus boxing Lucy.JPG|left|thumb|Linus looks for an opening to knock out Lucy in a boxing match, but...]]\n\n=== Lucy van Pelt ===\n[[File:Lucy KOs Linus.jpg|thumb|...Linus is the loser and Lucy lands the knockout punch instead.]]\n\nLinus is often bullied by his older sister Lucy, to which he responds by either giving in or taking revenge.\n\nLinus often defuses and defeats Lucy's bullying through [[nonviolent resistance|passive resistance]] and clever use of his intellect, either logically talking Lucy out of hitting him or confusing her into submission. Later in the strip, the pair got a younger brother, Rerun, who looks nearly identical to Linus, though smaller. Coincidentally, this occurred at the same time Lucy kicked Linus out of the house, leading her to cry in dismay: \"A ''new'' baby brother? But I just got rid of the ''old'' one!\" She then let him back in stating: \"You ''can't'' shovel water with a ''pitchfork''!\" With the irony not being lost on Linus, who foolishly mocked her behavior until she gagged him with his own security blanket.\n\n==Voiced by==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n*Christopher Shea (1965\u20131968) \n*Glenn Gilger (1969) \n*[[Stephen Shea]] (1971\u20131975) \n*Liam Martin (1975\u20131977) \n*Daniel Anderson (1977\u20131980) \n*Rocky Reilly (1980\u20131983) \n*[[Jeremy Schoenberg]] (1983\u20131985) \n*David T.

Schulz]]'s [[comic strip]] ''[[Peanuts]]''. The best friend of [[Charlie Brown]], Linus is also the younger brother of [[Lucy van Pelt]] and older brother of [[Rerun van Pelt]]. He first appeared on September 19, 1952, but was not mentioned by name until three days later. He was first referred to two months earlier, on July 14. Linus spoke his first words in 1954, the same year he was first shown with his [[security blanket]].\n\nDuring the times when he's a [[costumed character]] in [[Mall of America]] during the [[Camp Snoopy]] years, he wears a blue baseball cap most of the time. It was removed from his head when he was redesigned.\n\nThe character's creator, [[Charles M. Schulz]], has said of the character, \"Linus, my serious side, is the house intellectual, bright, well-informed which, I suppose may contribute to his feelings of insecurity.\"\n\n[[Lee Mendelson]], producer of the majority of the ''[[Peanuts]]'' television specials, has said that Linus is his favorite character:<ref>{{cite web |last1=Best |first1=Nathan |title=EXCLUSIVE: Q & A With Charlie Brown's Lee Mendelson |url=https://www.comicbookmovie.com/animated_features/exclusive-q-a-with-charlie-browns-lee-mendelson-a115192 |work=Comic Book Movie |accessdate=19 July 2018 |date=12 February 2015}}</ref>\n{{Quote box| quote=He made sucking your thumb and holding a security blanket OK.

Linus is the only member of his group who believes in the [[Great Pumpkin]], an alternative [[Santa Claus]]\u2013like figure who, according to Linus, appears every [[Halloween]] arising from the most \"sincere\" pumpkin patch, bearing gifts. He occasionally temporarily convinces other characters the Great Pumpkin is real, only to stubbornly maintain his faith when they lose theirs. On one occasion, Linus had a commanding lead in the polls for school president\u2014until he brought up the subject of the Great Pumpkin, at which point he was nearly laughed out of the election. (He ended up winning anyway by one vote, cast by his opponent, who decided that Linus would make a better school president.) A similar occurrence was featured in a strip with the same storyline; Charlie Brown asks him why he had to bring up the Great Pumpkin and Linus gives his reasons. After Linus says that Charlie Brown is looking at him as if he was crazy, Charlie Brown responds, \"I'm looking at you like I could've been vice president!\"\n\nIn the strip from June 9, 1986, Linus claims that his birthday is in October. However, Lucy gives Linus a chair for his birthday in the November 22, 1964, Sunday strip.\n\n=== Security blanket ===\nLinus is almost never seen without his blue [[security blanket]], which debuted in the June 1, 1954, strip.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1954/06/01|title=Peanuts by Charles Schulz for June 01, 1954 {{!}} GoComics.com|last=Schulz|first=Charles|date=1954-06-01|website=GoComics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> He holds it over his shoulder while [[Thumb sucking|sucking his thumb]]. Ridicule of the habit is not a major concern for him. His friend Roy warned him at summer camp that he would be viciously teased for it; in response, Linus used his blanket like a [[whip]] and sheared off a tree branch with intimidating power, saying, \"They never tease me more than once.\" The blanket, it turns out, is an autonomous (although nonverbal) entity. In a 1965 strip, it engaged in a campaign of clandestine attacks on Lucy, even routing her from the house, due to her constant, albeit failed, attempts to get rid of it by throwing it in the trash burner. In the special ''[[A Boy Named Charlie Brown]]'', it performed a complex dance routine with Linus upon being reunited with its owner. Linus had lost the blanket, causing him depression, panic attacks, sweating and other withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIn the earlier strips, Linus's relationship to his blanket was one of intense emotional attachment to the point of manifesting physical symptoms if he was deprived of it even for a short while. He suffered weakness and dizziness, for example, when Lucy took it from him only long enough to have it laundered, spontaneously recovering when it was restored to him. In ''A Boy Named Charlie Brown'', Linus manifested similar symptoms when he gave his blanket to Charlie Brown. On another occasion, Lucy snatched his blanket away and buried it in an effort to break Linus of his habit. Linus dug around the neighborhood for days trying to find it until Snoopy finally found the blanket and dug it up.\n\nPossession of the blanket is often sought by [[Snoopy]], who has used many tricks and subterfuges to relieve Linus of it, even at one point having the blanket delivered to his doghouse. Snoopy commonly runs up, quickly grabs the blanket in his mouth, and drags Linus along with it, then swings him and the blanket around before letting go and sending them both soaring off. Once, Linus was so angry at Snoopy for snatching his blanket again and again that he retaliated by threatening Snoopy's supper dish. Upon hearing that Linus had possession of ''his'' most prized possession, Snoopy gave Linus back the blanket fairly quickly, thinking, ''\"I never dreamed he would fight so dirty!\"''. When Lucy buried the blanket, Snoopy took the time to dig for it himself; and when he found it, Linus thanked him, upon which Snoopy thought, ''\"Every now and then I feel that my existence is justified!\"'' Linus always wins and gets the blanket back.\n\nIn one strip, Lucy confiscates Linus's blanket, locking it in a closet for two weeks as part of a bet. Linus thinks he can go without the blanket for two weeks and laughs off Lucy and Charlie Brown's differing opinion. After one week Linus begins suffering, and freezing without it; he tries to use Snoopy's floppy ears but Lucy notices and tells him \"no substitutes!\" After eight days, Linus screams and cries for the blanket. Finally it appears that Linus has lost his mind; Charlie Brown persuades Lucy to give Linus his blanket back when they see Linus lying on the closet door scratching at it in a vain attempt to open it.\n\nFurthermore, there are many stories where Lucy and Linus's grandmother attempts to force him to give up the blanket, only to eventually concede in the face of his steadfast resistance. Two attempts were when the grandmother in question gave up smoking, and when she offered that if he gave up the blanket she would donate ten dollars to his favorite charity. The deal was not made because Linus did not consider it a fair proposition. In another strip, Lucy warns him that she has arrived. Linus reluctantly hands her the blanket and then goes into his room, and says, ''\"I decoyed her with a colored dish towel!\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1964/06/07|title=Peanuts by Charles Schulz for June 07, 1964 {{!}} GoComics.com|last=Schulz|first=Charles|date=1964-06-07|website=GoComics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>\n\nThe April 11, 1983, strip shows Linus saying that he had given up his blanket,<ref>{{cite web |title=Peanuts by Charles Schulz for Apr 11, 1983 |url=https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1983/04/11/ |website=GoComics |accessdate=3 June 2018 |language=en |date=11 April 1983}}</ref> and later going from door to door telling people how he gave up his blanket. Once, this results in the girl at the door lashing him with ''her'' blanket, in her anger. Twice before Linus actually vows to give up his blanket. Once he threw it away but grabbed it back; another time he was about to tell Charlie Brown about his new resolution when Charlie Brown ruined everything by tossing a blanket onto him. Trying again to give up the blanket, he left it on the side of the road and walked away, quickly running back to it because according to him, it was whimpering. In another effort to be rid of his habit, he has Snoopy hold on to it, who then makes it into [[Sport coat|sports coats]] for both him and [[Woodstock (Peanuts)|Woodstock]]. Just when he feels that he is over his blanket, Charlie Brown has him hooked again by giving him another one.\n\nIn one particularly angry confrontation over the issue (the aforementioned blanket-for-smoking episode) Linus admitted that if his mother ordered him to stop, he would comply; but no one else, especially Lucy or the \"blanket-hating\" grandmother, would have that authority. In fact, in that confrontation, when Lucy decided that he had gone without the blanket for two weeks and that he no longer needed it, she decided to throw it into the trash burner; Linus, however, was able to intervene at the last second and retrieve his blanket, reminding her that if their mother wanted him to give up the blanket he would do it, but until then it was nobody else's business. Never objecting, the mother was evidently content to let her unusually intelligent son grow out of the habit on his own. In later strips, Linus is shown with it less and less, and Schulz admitted in 1989 that Linus had finally outgrown the blanket, and it was only in the strip when required for the humor. In one comic, Linus suddenly stops sucking his thumb and says \"It's a good thumb, but not a great thumb.\" The special ''[[Why, Charlie Brown, Why?]]'', released the following year, is the only one in which Linus is never seen with his blanket; nor is it even mentioned, arguably to make Linus appear more mature given the special's serious subject. Eventually, however, he is reunited with it.\n\n==Appearance==\nLinus has brown hair and normally wears a red shirt with stripes on it, black shorts, and tennis shoes.

They use a dog sled to deliver mail across the Yukon. Perrault hopes to make the long trek to the mail depot before the deadline. Buck is introduced to the other dogs, including the vicious pack leader, a Husky named Spitz.\n\nThroughout their travels, Buck gains the loyalty and trust of Francoise and the other sled dogs, antagonizing Spitz. Buck begins experiencing ancestral spiritual visions: a black wolf that acts as his guide throughout their travels. One night, Buck catches then releases a rabbit. Spitz kills it, then attacks Buck to assert his dominance. Buck pins him down, displacing Spitz as pack leader, who disappears into the wild. Perrault grudgingly makes Buck the lead when no other dog assumes the position. Buck's speed and strength allow the sled to arrive to deposit the mail on time. There, Thornton hands over a letter he has written to his former wife expressing his feeling about their dead son. When Perrault returns, he learns the mail route is being replaced by the telegraph, forcing him to sell the dogs. Hal, a corrupt wealthy man, buys the pack, working them to exhaustion carrying a heavy load in weather unsuitable for sledding.\n\nThe exhausted dogs stop to rest before Hal can force them to cross an unstable frozen lake. When Buck refuses to move, Hal threatens to shoot him. Thornton appears and rescues Buck while Hal forces the other sled dogs to cross the lake. Under Thornton's care, Buck recovers. Later, at a bar, Thornton is attacked by Hal, who reveals the dogs abandoned him. Witnessing the scene, Buck attacks Hal. Buck and Thornton then travel beyond the Yukon map where they can freely live in the wild. They come across an abandoned cabin in an open valley and settle in. Meanwhile, Hal relentlessly hunts them, believing Thornton is hiding gold.\n\nIn the open wilderness, Thornton and Buck bond over their daily activities, primarily fishing and gold panning. Throughout their time together, Buck is drawn to a female white wolf. Going back and forth between Thornton and the white wolf, Buck is conflicted by his domesticated life with Thornton and his place with the wolf pack that the female belongs to. Thornton believes it is time to return home and tells Buck he is leaving in the morning, and to come and say good-bye. Buck heads into the forest and sleeps beside the white wolf, clearly conflicted. Hal subsequently finds and mortally shoots Thornton. Buck returns and kills Hal, pushing him into the cabin, which has caught on fire. Thornton, dying, wants Buck to live for himself. He embraces him and reassures him with his final words: \"It's okay, boy. You're home.\"\n\nThe next morning, Buck returns to the wilderness. There, he mates and has offspring with the white wolf and becomes the pack leader, fully embracing the call of the wild.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as John Thornton\n* [[Omar Sy]] as Perrault\n* [[Dan Stevens]] as Hal\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as Mercedes\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as Judge Miller\n* [[Colin Woodell]] as Charles\n* [[Cara Gee]] as Fran\u00e7oise\n* [[Scott MacDonald (actor)| Scott MacDonald]] as Dawson \n\nActor and stunt coordinator [[Terry Notary]] stood-in for the CGI creation of Buck, whose model was scanned after an adopted dog.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nIn October 2017, it was announced that [[20th Century Fox]] was developing the film adaptation of the [[Jack London]]'s 1903 novel ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'', set in [[the Yukon]] around 1890s about the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], which would be directed by [[Chris Sanders]] from the script by [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], and would be produced by [[Erwin Stoff]].<ref name=\"Oct2017D\">{{cite news |last1=D'Alessandro |first1=Anthony |title='Gambit' Starring Channing Tatum Will Open Valentine's Day 2019 |url=https://deadline.com/2017/10/channing-tatum-gambit-to-open-valentines-day-2019-release-1202187558/ |accessdate=July 17, 2018 |work=Deadline |date=October 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nIn July 2018, [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Dan Stevens]] were cast in the film, with Ford set to star as John Thornton, who goes on the hunt for gold.

Buck is introduced to the other dogs, including the vicious pack leader, a Husky named Spitz.\n\nThroughout their travels, Buck gains the loyalty and trust of Francoise and the other sled dogs, antagonizing Spitz. Buck begins experiencing ancestral spiritual visions: a black wolf that acts as his guide throughout their travels. One night, Buck catches then releases a rabbit. Spitz kills it, then attacks Buck to assert his dominance. Buck pins him down, displacing Spitz as pack leader, who disappears into the wild. Perrault grudgingly makes Buck the lead when no other dog assumes the position. Buck's speed and strength allow the sled to arrive to deposit the mail on time. There, Thornton hands over a letter he has written to his former wife expressing his feeling about their dead son. When Perrault returns, he learns the mail route is being replaced by the telegraph, forcing him to sell the dogs. Hal, a corrupt wealthy man, buys the pack, working them to exhaustion carrying a heavy load in weather unsuitable for sledding.\n\nThe exhausted dogs stop to rest before Hal can force them to cross an unstable frozen lake. When Buck refuses to move, Hal threatens to shoot him. Thornton appears and rescues Buck while Hal forces the other sled dogs to cross the lake. Under Thornton's care, Buck recovers. Later, at a bar, Thornton is attacked by Hal, who reveals the dogs abandoned him. Witnessing the scene, Buck attacks Hal. Buck and Thornton then travel beyond the Yukon map where they can freely live in the wild. They come across an abandoned cabin in an open valley and settle in. Meanwhile, Hal relentlessly hunts them, believing Thornton is hiding gold.\n\nIn the open wilderness, Thornton and Buck bond over their daily activities, primarily fishing and gold panning. Throughout their time together, Buck is drawn to a female white wolf. Going back and forth between Thornton and the white wolf, Buck is conflicted by his domesticated life with Thornton and his place with the wolf pack that the female belongs to. Thornton believes it is time to return home and tells Buck he is leaving in the morning, and to come and say good-bye. Buck heads into the forest and sleeps beside the white wolf, clearly conflicted. Hal subsequently finds and mortally shoots Thornton. Buck returns and kills Hal, pushing him into the cabin, which has caught on fire. Thornton, dying, wants Buck to live for himself. He embraces him and reassures him with his final words: \"It's okay, boy. You're home.\"\n\nThe next morning, Buck returns to the wilderness. There, he mates and has offspring with the white wolf and becomes the pack leader, fully embracing the call of the wild.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as John Thornton\n* [[Omar Sy]] as Perrault\n* [[Dan Stevens]] as Hal\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as Mercedes\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as Judge Miller\n* [[Colin Woodell]] as Charles\n* [[Cara Gee]] as Fran\u00e7oise\n* [[Scott MacDonald (actor)| Scott MacDonald]] as Dawson \n\nActor and stunt coordinator [[Terry Notary]] stood-in for the CGI creation of Buck, whose model was scanned after an adopted dog.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nIn October 2017, it was announced that [[20th Century Fox]] was developing the film adaptation of the [[Jack London]]'s 1903 novel ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'', set in [[the Yukon]] around 1890s about the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], which would be directed by [[Chris Sanders]] from the script by [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], and would be produced by [[Erwin Stoff]].<ref name=\"Oct2017D\">{{cite news |last1=D'Alessandro |first1=Anthony |title='Gambit' Starring Channing Tatum Will Open Valentine's Day 2019 |url=https://deadline.com/2017/10/channing-tatum-gambit-to-open-valentines-day-2019-release-1202187558/ |accessdate=July 17, 2018 |work=Deadline |date=October 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nIn July 2018, [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Dan Stevens]] were cast in the film, with Ford set to star as John Thornton, who goes on the hunt for gold.
