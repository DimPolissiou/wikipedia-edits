Sophia Kalkau has studied Art History at [[Copenhagen University]] and holds a degree in Art Theory from the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]]. She is the author of numerous publications on aesthetics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisKunstner.do?kunstnerId=14010|title=Artist: Sophia Kalkau|publisher=Kunstindeks Danmark|accessdate=10 March 2016 |language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kunstonline.dk/profil/sophia_kalkau.php|author=Jespersen, Flemming|title=Sophia Kalkau|publisher=KunstOnLine.dk|accessdate=10 March 2016 |language=Danish}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\nIn the center of Kalkau's art stands a critical, open dialogue that researches vocabularies of material and form around the female body through a photographic work. In a repetitive act of merging, binding and combining human figures and geometrical objects Kalkau formulates an artistic narrative of surface continuity and spatial organization.\n\nA key characteristic of her oeuvre is a conceptual approach to contemporary sculpture that she serially explores through her own body.  Kalkau's interest in physical, cognitive and perceptive transitions materializes frequently in a scenographic performative gesture that she records through serial photographic prints. Kalkau's photographic work defies an unambiguous reading and invites the viewer to various interpretations.\n\nKalkau's sculptures, installations and photographies have been shown frequently in Denmark and abroad. For a period she was represented by [http://plgallery.dk Peter Lav Gallery] in Copenhagen, DK until its closure.\n\n== Selection of Artworks ==\n* 2015           Path to the planets ABC.

Sophia Kalkau has studied Art History at [[Copenhagen University]] and holds a degree in Art Theory from the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]]. She is the author of numerous publications on aesthetics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisKunstner.do?kunstnerId=14010|title=Artist: Sophia Kalkau|publisher=Kunstindeks Danmark|accessdate=10 March 2016 |language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kunstonline.dk/profil/sophia_kalkau.php|author=Jespersen, Flemming|title=Sophia Kalkau|publisher=KunstOnLine.dk|accessdate=10 March 2016 |language=Danish}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\nIn the center of Kalkau's art stands a critical, open dialogue that researches vocabularies of material and form around the female body through a photographic work. In a repetitive act of merging, binding and combining human figures and geometrical objects Kalkau formulates an artistic narrative of surface continuity and spatial organization.\n\nA key characteristic of her oeuvre is a conceptual approach to contemporary sculpture that she serially explores through her own body.  Kalkau's interest in physical, cognitive and perceptive transitions materializes frequently in a scenographic performative gesture that she records through serial photographic prints. Kalkau's photographic work defies an unambiguous reading and invites the viewer to various interpretations.\n\nKalkau's sculptures, installations and photographies have been shown frequently in Denmark and abroad. For a period she was represented by [http://plgallery.dk Peter Lav Gallery] in Copenhagen, DK until its closure.\n\n== Selection of Artworks ==\n* 2015           Path to the planets ABC.

She was converted from an [[ocean liner]] that was under construction when the [[First World War]] began and became the first example of the standard pattern of aircraft carrier, with a full-length [[flight deck]] that allowed wheeled aircraft to take off and land. After commissioning, the ship was involved for several years in the development of the optimum design for other aircraft carriers. ''Argus'' also evaluated various types of [[arresting gear]], general procedures needed to operate a number of aircraft in concert and fleet tactics. The ship was too top-heavy as originally built and had to be modified to improve her stability in the mid-1920s. She spent one brief deployment on the [[China Station]] in the late 1920s before being placed in [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|reserve]] for budgetary reasons.\n\n''Argus'' was recommissioned and partially modernised shortly before the Second World War and served as a [[training ship]] for deck-landing practice until June 1940. The following month she made the first of her many [[Malta Convoys|ferry trips]] to the Western Mediterranean to fly off fighters to [[Malta]]; she was largely occupied in this task for the next two years. The ship also delivered aircraft to [[Murmansk]] in Russia, [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Takoradi]] on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], and [[Reykjav\u00edk]] in Iceland. By 1942, the Royal Navy was very short of aircraft carriers and ''Argus'' was pressed into front-line service despite her lack of speed and armament. In June, she participated in [[Operation Harpoon (1942)|Operation Harpoon]], providing air cover for the Malta-bound convoy. In November, the ship provided air cover during [[Operation Torch]], the invasion of [[French North Africa]] and was slightly damaged by a bomb. After returning to the UK for repairs, ''Argus'' was used again for deck-landing practice until late September 1944. In December, she became an [[accommodation ship]] and was listed for disposal in mid-1946. ''Argus'' was sold in late 1946 and [[ship breaking|scrapped]] the following year.\n\n==Design, description and construction==\n''Argus'' had her genesis in the [[Admiralty]]'s desire during the First World War for an aircraft carrier that could fly off wheeled aircraft and land them aboard. Existing carriers could launch wheeled aircraft, but had no way to recover them as they lacked flight decks. In 1912, the ship builder [[William Beardmore and Company|William Beardmore]] had proposed to the Admiralty an aircraft carrier design with a continuous, full-length flight deck, but it was not accepted. As the limitations of existing carriers became more apparent, this design was dusted off and the Admiralty located two large, fast hulls suitable for conversion into an aircraft carrier. Construction of the Italian [[ocean liner]]s ''Conte Rosso'' and ''Giulio Cesare'' had been suspended by William Beardmore and Company at the outbreak of the war, and both met the Admiralty's criteria. ''Conte Rosso'' was purchased on 20 September 1916, possibly because her machinery was more complete than that of ''Giulio Cesare'', and the company began work on converting the ship.<ref>McBride, pp. 73\u201375</ref>\n\nJames Graham,sixth Marquis of Montrose, a director of the Beardmore company, proposed to the Admiralty a design for, \" A Parent Ship for Naval Aeroplanes and Torpedo Boat Destroyer, \" in 1912.(Page 40 MacKay & Friedman). The initial design had two [[Glossary of nautical terms#I|islands]] with the flight deck running between them. Each island contained one [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]; a large net could be strung between them to stop out-of-control aircraft. The islands were connected by braces and the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] was mounted on top of the bracing, which left a clear height of {{convert|20|ft|m|1}} for the aircraft on the flight deck. Fairly early in the design process, the decision was made to delete the funnels to reduce turbulence over the flight deck. The exhaust gases were, instead, ducted aft in the space between the roof of the hangar deck and the flight deck and were enclosed by a casing through which cooler air was driven by electric fans. They normally exhausted underneath the aft end of the flight deck, but the exhaust could be vented through openings on the rear side of the hull by two large electric fans.<ref>Friedman, pp. 62, 65</ref>\n\nIn November 1916, the ship's design was tested in a [[wind tunnel]] by the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] to evaluate the turbulence caused by the twin islands and the bridge over them. They were found to cause problems, but no changes were made until the ship was nearly complete. In April 1918, ''Argus'' was ordered to be modified to a [[flush deck|flush-decked]] configuration after the [[sea trial]]s of the carrier {{HMS|Furious|47|2}} had revealed severe turbulence problems caused by her superstructure. The ship was given a bridge underneath her flight deck, extending from side to side, and she was fitted with a retractable [[pilot house]] in the middle of the flight deck for use when not operating aircraft.<ref>Friedman, pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\n''Argus''{{'}}s stability had been a concern from the beginning. Despite having been originally conceived as a liner with a hull designed to minimise rolling, most of the changes made to the ship during her conversion added topside weight, raising her centre of gravity. Even the addition of {{convert|600|LT}} of [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] still left the ship with a very low [[metacentric height]] of only {{convert|1.6|ft}} lightly loaded and {{convert|3.8|ft}} at [[deep load]]. This meant she was very steady, but [[Heeling (sailing)|heeled]] noticeably when turning. The ship proved to be very manoeuvrable at medium and high speeds, but steered badly at low speeds and in wind due to her large surface area.<ref name=f6>Friedman, p. 66</ref>\n\n''Argus'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|565|ft|m|1}}, a beam of {{convert|68|ft|m|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|23|ft|3|in|m|1}} at deep load. She displaced {{convert|14450|LT}} at [[Standard displacement#Standard displacement|standard load]] and {{convert|15575|LT}} at deep load. Each of the ship's four sets of [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s drove one [[propeller shaft]]. Steam was supplied by 12 cylindrical [[Scotch boiler]]s. The turbines were designed for a total of {{convert|20000|shp|lk=in}}, but they produced {{convert|21376|shp}} during her sea trials in September 1918, and gave ''Argus'' a speed of {{convert|20.506|kn}}. The ship carried {{convert|2500|LT}} of [[fuel oil]], which gave her a range of {{convert|3600|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref>Friedman, pp. 67, 365</ref>\n\nThe ship's flight deck was {{convert|549|ft|1}} long and her [[hangar]] was {{convert|330|ft|1}} long, {{convert|48|-|68|ft|1}} wide, and {{convert|16|ft|1}} high.<ref name=m67>McBride, pp. 76, 86</ref> Aircraft were transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two [[Elevator#Aircraft elevators|aircraft lifts]] (elevators); the forward lift measured {{convert|30|x|36|ft|m|1}} and the rear {{convert|60|x|18|ft|m|1}}.<ref name=f5>Friedman, p. 365</ref> ''Argus'' was the only British carrier serving in the Second World War capable of striking down (stowing away) aircraft with non-folding wings because of her wide lifts and tall hangar ceiling.<ref>Brown 2003, p. 115</ref> Three [[fire curtain]]s divided the hangar and another separated the hangar and the [[quarterdeck]].<ref name=m6/> She could accommodate between 15 and 18 aircraft.<ref name=f9/> No arresting gear was fitted as completed. Two large [[crane (machine)|cranes]] were positioned on the quarterdeck, beneath the rear of the flight deck. Petrol storage consisted of {{convert|8000|impgal|l usgal}} in {{convert|2|impgal|l usgal|adj=on}} tins stowed below the waterline. The ship's crew totalled 495 officers and men.<ref name=m6>McBride, p. 76</ref>\n\nThe ship was armed with four [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|{{convert|4|in|adj=on|0}}]] [[anti-aircraft gun]]s, two on the quarterdeck and one on each side of the hull. She was also fitted with two low-angle 4-inch guns, one also on each side of the hull. The rear [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] and the torpedo warhead storage magazine were protected by a total of {{convert|2|in}} of protective plating on all sides, but the forward magazine and bomb storage rooms had only a 2-inch thick deck to protect them.<ref name=m67/>\n\n''Argus'' was [[Keel|laid down]] in 1914 by William Beardmore and Company in [[Dalmuir]], as the ''Conte Rosso''. She was renamed after her purchase in September 1916 and was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 2{{nbsp}}December 1917, her building having been slowed by labour shortages.<ref>McBride, pp. 75, 77</ref> The ship was commissioned on 16 September 1918.<ref>Friedman, p. 363</ref> Formally named after [[Argus Panoptes|Argus of the 100 Eyes]] from Greek mythology,<ref>Silverstone, p. 211</ref> ''Argus'' was nicknamed the ''Hat Box'' \"Ditty Box\" or the ''Flatiron'' due to her flat-topped appearance.<ref name=m9>McBride, p. 79</ref>\n\n==Service history==\n===1918\u20131939===\nAfter commissioning too late to participate in the First World War, ''Argus'' was tasked to conduct deck-landing trials with longitudinal arresting gear transferred from ''Furious''. The first landing on the ship was made on 1{{nbsp}}October 1918 by a [[Sopwith 1\u00bd Strutter|Sopwith Ship Strutter]].<ref name=Mcbride78>McBride, pp. 78\u201379</ref> The same month, the ship was used in trials to evaluate the effects which an island superstructure would have on flying operations, with a canvas-and-wood dummy island being installed with a smoke box to simulate funnel gases. By 19 December, 36 successful landings had been made by Ship Strutters and [[Sopwith Pup]]s. ''Argus'' was refitted from 23 December to 21 March 1919 with modified arresting gear. The wires of the arresting gear had been lifted off the deck so they could engage the hooks on the undercarriages of the aircraft, but this prevented the use of the flight deck for any other purpose. The after lift was therefore lowered {{convert|9|in|0}}, which allowed aircraft to use the area when the lift was raised flush with the rest of the flight deck. Trials began in April and the lift was widened in October. ''Argus'' joined the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] in January 1920 for its Spring Cruise carrying eight Ship Strutters, four [[Sopwith Camel]] fighters, two [[Airco DH.9A]] bombers and two [[Fairey Aviation Company|Fairey]] [[floatplane]]s. Operational experience confirmed that the aircraft should attempt to land directly onto the arresting gear lest they be blown over the side of the carrier, as happened three times during the cruise.<ref>Friedman, pp. 67\u201369</ref>\n\nAfter the ship's return from its cruise, a conference was convened aboard ''Argus'' on 19 May to consider revised landing arrangements. It was decided that a longer system of wires was needed, and the landing well system was abandoned in favour of ramps that could be raised and lowered as needed. Powered [[palisade]]s were also needed on the side of the flight deck to help retain aircraft aboard that had not engaged a wire. The revised system was successfully tested aboard the carrier {{HMS|Eagle|1918|2}} later in the year and ''Argus''{{'}} arresting gear was modified accordingly in time for the 1921 Spring Cruise, during which the ship carried ten [[Parnall Panther]] spotter and [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and three [[Fairey III]]C reconnaissance aircraft. In addition, the ship's after lift was permanently locked in the raised position and {{convert|150|LT}} of ballast were added to compensate for the additional weight of the equipment high in the ship. This cruise was deemed very successful as 45 landings were made, only two of which resulted in serious accidents, an accident rate comparable to those of land-based units. The time required to launch two aircraft and land one aboard was forty minutes during this cruise, primarily because the rotary engines of the time were very difficult to start.<ref name=f9>Friedman, p. 69</ref>\n\nOn September 1922, ''Argus'', equipped with [[Gloster Nightjar]] fighters, was deployed to the [[Dardanelles]] as a response to the [[Chanak crisis]]. As well as operating her own aircraft, ''Argus'' was used to fly off [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighters]] that had been ferried to the Dardanelles aboard the [[seaplane carrier]] {{HMS|Ark Royal|1914|2}} to an airfield at [[\u015eile|Kilia]] on the European side of the straits. (The aircraft could not be flown off ''Ark Royal'' since it was a seaplane carrier with no flight deck. The Bristol Fighters were transferred to ''Argus'' by crane).<ref name=\"AE p38\">Halley, p. 38</ref>\n\nIn July 1922, ''Argus'' was [[Inclining test|inclined]] to evaluate her stability in light of the additional weights that had been added since her completion and it was discovered that her metacentric height had been reduced by {{convert|0.83|ft|1}}. The Director of Naval Construction proposed to fit her with a [[Anti-torpedo bulge|girdle]] at her [[waterline]] to increase her beam and thus her stability. He intended to do this under the 1923\u20131924 Naval Programme, but this was delayed several times as the ship was needed for training and when she was finally modified it was under the 1925\u20131926 Naval Programme. Girdling increased her deep displacement to {{convert|16750|LT}} and her beam to {{convert|74|ft|1}}, and reduced her draught to {{convert|22|ft|10|in|m|1}} and her speed by a quarter of a knot. The ship was also fitted with bulk petrol storage, new four-inch guns that used [[List of British ordnance terms#Fixed QF|fixed ammunition]], and new radio masts.<ref>Friedman, p. 67</ref>\n\n[[File:Aircraft carrier HMS Argus in the later 1920s.jpg|thumb|left|''Argus'' in the late 1920s]]\n''Argus'' usually operated about 15 aircraft during the 1920s. This was commonly divided up between one small flight of fighters (Gloster Nightjars or [[Fairey Flycatcher]]s), one of spotters (Parnall Panthers or [[Avro Bison]]s), and one spotter reconnaissance flight with Fairey IIIs.<ref>Sturtivant, pp. 466\u201369</ref>\n\nThe ship's hull was surveyed in 1927 and anticipated to be sound for another 15 years,<ref name=\"f9\"/> and she relieved {{HMS|Hermes|95|2}} on the [[China Station]] from 1{{nbsp}}September to 20 March 1928.<ref>McCart, pp. 21\u201323</ref> Sometime after her return, ''Argus'' was laid up at Plymouth at 14-days readiness to save money. Since she was completed before 9{{nbsp}}December 1921, the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] classified her as an experimental aircraft carrier and thus she did not need to be scrapped to release treaty-limited tonnage for new construction. The ship was reduced to Extended Reserve (four months readiness) at [[Rosyth]] in September 1932. In February 1936, it was decided to refit the ship as a tender for [[De Havilland Tiger Moth#Variants|Queen Bee]] [[target drone]]s. The opportunity was taken to widen her flight deck by {{convert|10|ft}} and replace her old boilers with [[destroyer]]-type boilers which could generate more steam than her turbines could handle. The boilers were taken from scrapped destroyers of the V and W class which were being broken up at Inverkeithing. (MacKay P88) The ship was intended to have one hydro-pneumatic [[aircraft catapult]], but this was instead diverted to {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}}. Since ''Argus'' was now classified as a naval auxiliary, her four-inch guns were removed. Her refit was completed on 30 July 1938 and she underwent sea trials the following month.<ref name=m9/><ref>Friedman, pp. 69, 71</ref>. She was classified as a Target Aeroplane Carrier for the de Havilland Queen Bee and recommissioned 11 August 1938, in command was Captain W.G Benn R.N.(MacKay P91)\n\n===Second World War===\nAfter recommissioning, ''Argus'' served as a training carrier to allow pilots to practice their deck-landing skills. She was carrying out this duty in the [[Gulf of Lion]] when the [[World War II|Second World War]] began. By April 1940, the ship had been rearmed with two [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF Mk{{nbsp}}V 4-inch]] anti-aircraft guns on her quarterdeck, as well as three quadruple [[Vickers .50 machine gun|Vickers .50{{nbsp}}machine gun mounts]]; one of these was on each side of her hull and the third was on the centreline of the quarterdeck.<ref name=f1>Friedman, p. 71</ref><ref>McBride, p. 80</ref> Together with the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood|51|2}} and six destroyers, ''Argus'' escorted Convoy US-3, loaded with Australian and New Zealand troops, to the United Kingdom in mid-June.<ref>Rohwer, p. 22</ref> A week later, she ferried [[Supermarine Walrus]] amphibians of [[701 Naval Air Squadron|701 Squadron]] to [[Reykjav\u00edk]], Iceland. ''Argus'' loaded a dozen [[Hawker Hurricane]] and two [[Blackburn Skua]] fighters of 418 Flight RAF in late July for delivery to Malta as part of [[Operation Hurry]]. Escorted by ''Ark Royal'', three battleships, two cruisers and 10 destroyers, the ship flew them off without incident on 2{{nbsp}}August 1940 from a point west of [[Sicily]], although two of the Hurricanes crashed on landing.<ref>Shores, Cull and Malizia 1987, pp. 45\u201347</ref> Accompanied by the battleship {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}} and escorted by two destroyers, she returned to [[Liverpool]] to load 30 Hurricanes with their wings removed. ''Argus'' sailed on 22 August and arrived at [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Takoradi]] on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] on 5{{nbsp}}September where her aircraft were off-loaded. After her return to the United Kingdom, the ship was briefly refitted<ref>Nailer, pp. 152\u201353</ref> and she ferried 701 Squadron back to the United Kingdom in late October.<ref name=s7>Sturtivant, pp. 26\u201327</ref>\n\nOn 11 November, ''Argus'' sailed again from Liverpool with a deck-load of a dozen Hurricanes and two Skuas for delivery to Malta ([[Operation White]]). She rendezvoused with [[Force H]] four days later and launched the aircraft on the morning of 17 November. Eight of the Hurricanes ran out of fuel en route due to [[headwind]]s and one Skua was forced to [[emergency landing|crash land]] on Sicily after it had been damaged by Italian [[flak]]. In mid-December, the ship embarked six [[Fairey Swordfish]] torpedo bombers of [[821 Naval Air Squadron|821X Squadron]] for delivery to Gibraltar and another pair of Swordfish from [[825 Naval Air Squadron|825 Squadron]] for self-defence. The carrier rendezvoused with ''Furious'' and Convoy WS-5A before the combined force was discovered by the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper}} on 25 December, but little damage was inflicted by ''Hipper'' before she was driven off by the escorts. No air strike could be flown against the German cruiser because the Swordfish were embarked in ''Argus'' with bombs that they could not carry and the torpedoes were aboard ''Furious''.<ref name=n4/> After ''Furious''{{'}}s Skuas had flown off to search for ''Hipper'', space was cleared to allow ''Argus''{{'}} Swordfish to load the torpedoes, but the Skuas could not locate ''Hipper'' because of the poor visibility. ''Argus'' delivered 821X Squadron to Gibraltar and was back in the United Kingdom by 14 January 1941.<ref name=n4>Nailer, p. 154</ref>\n\n[[File:Aircraft in hangar of HMS Argus (I49) c1942.jpg|thumb|left|Five Sea Hurricanes and a single Seafire lined up in the hangar, c. 1942\u201344]]\nIn March, the carrier loaded a dozen Hurricane IIs and three Skuas and delivered them to Gibraltar on 29 March, where they were loaded onto ''Ark Royal'' and flown off to Malta a few days later. She returned to the United Kingdom on 11 April and loaded six replacement Swordfish as well as six Swordfish of [[812 Naval Air Squadron|812 Squadron]] for self-defence. After a brief refit, ''Argus'' sailed on 14 April for Gibraltar to transfer the replacements to ''Ark Royal''. She arrived on 24 April and began a two-week refit after the aircraft were transferred. The ship was back in the United Kingdom, loading another batch of Hurricanes bound for Gibraltar. Three Fulmars of [[800 Naval Air Squadron|800X Squadron]] were also embarked to protect the ship against the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]] Condors that patrolled the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the Eastern [[Atlantic]]. The carrier arrived on 31 May and disembarked all her aircraft, including 800X Squadron. On her return to the United Kingdom she began a refit.<ref>Nailer, pp. 155\u201357</ref>\n\nIn late August to early September, ''Argus'' transported 24 Hurricanes of [[No. 151 Wing RAF]] to [[Murmansk]], Russia.<ref>Rohwer, p. 93</ref><ref name=Mcbride80>McBride, pp. 80\u201381</ref> She then ferried a dozen [[Fairey Albacore]] torpedo bombers of [[828 Naval Air Squadron|828 Squadron]] to Gibraltar on 30 September for eventual delivery to Malta. She was to ferry the fighters of [[804 Naval Air Squadron|804 Squadron]] on her return trip to England, but this was cancelled. Eventually, the ship loaded some damaged aircraft and accompanied ''Eagle'' back to the United Kingdom on 20 October. ''Argus'' loaded more Hurricanes for Gibraltar and also embarked a pair of Swordfish from [[818 Naval Air Squadron|818 Squadron]] and two Sea Hurricanes from 804X Squadron for self-defence. The ship arrived on 8{{nbsp}}November and she transferred some of her Hurricanes to Ark Royal. Two days later, the two carriers, in [[Operation Perpetual]], sailed to the west of Sicily and flew off their 37 Hurricanes; three of the fighters were lost en route. ''Ark Royal'' was torpedoed and sunk during the return to Gibraltar, which forced ''Argus'' to remain there to provide cover for Force H as the sole carrier available.<ref>Nailer, pp. 159\u201360</ref>\n\nForce H was recalled to the United Kingdom in January and ''Argus'' loaded 12 Swordfish of 812 Squadron for her own protection. Whilst in the United Kingdom, she loaded some [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters and returned to Gibraltar on 24 February. There, the ship transferred the Spitfires to ''Eagle'' and embarked nine [[Fairey Fulmar]] fighters of [[807 Naval Air Squadron|807 Squadron]]. The plan for [[Operation Spotter]] I was for ''Argus'' to provide fighter cover for ''Eagle'' as she flew off the Spitfires for Malta, but the operation had to be cancelled when the long-range fuel tanks of the Spitfires proved defective. The problems were not rectified until 7{{nbsp}}March, when the 15 Spitfires were successfully flown off. During [[Operation Picket]] I, nine more Spitfires were flown off by ''Eagle'' on 21 March whilst a dozen Sea Hurricane IIBs from 804 Squadron provided air cover from ''Argus''. The two carriers repeated the delivery on 29 March when ''Eagle'' flew off seven more Spitfires whilst 807 Squadron provided air cover from ''Argus''. The latter ship also carried six Albacores bound for Malta as well, but the weather deteriorated over Malta and their fly-off was cancelled.<ref>Nailer, pp. 160\u201361</ref>\n\nAnother attempt to deliver the Albacores and more Spitfires was made during [[Operation LB]]. As usual, ''Argus'' provided the air cover with a dozen Fulmars from 807 Squadron and ''Eagle'' ferried the Albacores and 17 Spitfires to their take-off point for Malta on 19 May.<ref>Nailer, p. 162</ref> The Spitfires were flown off successfully, but the engines of the Albacores all began to overheat and they were forced to return to the carrier. Examination of the aircraft revealed that their air coolers had been set to \"Winter\" rather than \"Summer\". One of the Fulmars was shot down by [[Vichy French]] [[Dewoitine D.520]] fighters as it attempted to protect the crew of a [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] [[flying boat]] that had been shot down earlier.<ref>Shores, Cull and Malizia 1991, pp. 282\u201384</ref> By this time the ship's [[Vickers]] .50-calibre machine guns had been replaced by 13 [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20{{nbsp}}mm]] light anti-aircraft guns.<ref name=f1/>\n\nAfterwards, the ship returned to the UK to ferry [[801 Naval Air Squadron|801 Squadron]] to Gibraltar and delivered the unit on 7{{nbsp}}June. Together with ''Eagle'', ''Argus'' was tasked to provide air cover over Force H as it covered a convoy attempting to get desperately needed supplies through to Malta later in June ([[Operation Harpoon (1942)|Operation Harpoon]]). The carrier embarked two Fulmars from 807 Squadron, nine Swordfish from [[813 Naval Air Squadron|813 Squadron]] and four more Swordfish from [[824 Naval Air Squadron|824 Squadron]] to protect the convoy from submarines while ''Eagle'' loaded 20 Fulmars and Sea Hurricanes from three different squadrons. One Swordfish crashed while landing on 13 June and the wreckage was pushed over the side. Both Fulmars from 807 Squadron were shot down on 14 June by Italian bombers, but they likely shot down one [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]] and one [[CANT Z.1007]] bomber. ''Eagle'' transferred her Fulmars to ''Argus'' over the course of the battle and two more were lost later in the day. The ship was attacked multiple times by bombs and torpedoes during the battle without effect.<ref>Shores, Cull and Malizia 1991, pp. 319\u201320, 325, 327, 329\u201330, 333, 336</ref>\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A12882.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white photograph of an aircraft carrier at sea. An aircraft is about to land on her stern, and another aircraft is positioned at the forward end of the flight deck|''Argus'' at sea during [[Operation Torch]] in late 1942]]\n\nAs part of the preparations for another resupply convoy for Malta ([[Operation Pedestal]]), ''Argus'' returned to the United Kingdom in late June to load reserve aircraft, including six Sea Hurricanes of 804 Squadron, for the other aircraft carriers involved in the operation and left the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] on 2{{nbsp}}August for Gibraltar. The ship rendezvoused with the other carriers on 5{{nbsp}}August for a three-day training exercise to work out co-ordination procedures before the operation commenced and 804 Squadron was deemed not ready for combat. It was ordered to return to the UK aboard ''Argus''.<ref>Shores, Cull and Malizia 1991, pp. 451\u201352</ref><ref>Nailer, p. 164</ref>\n\nIn November 1942, ''Argus'' was assigned to the Eastern Naval Task Force that invaded [[Algiers]], Algeria, during the Allied landings in French North Africa with 18 [[Supermarine Seafire]] IICs of [[880 Naval Air Squadron|880 Squadron]] aboard.<ref>Brown 2009, p. 62</ref> The ship was hit by a bomb on 10 November that killed four men. She and the [[escort carrier]] {{HMS|Avenger|D14|2}} joined a convoy returning to the United Kingdom on the evening of 14/15 November that was spotted by the Germans. {{GS|U-155|1941|2}} torpedoed ''Avenger'', right behind ''Argus'' in the convoy, later that morning. The ship was under repair for a month after she reached the United Kingdom, but she required a more thorough refit that lasted from February to May 1943. Reclassified as an escort carrier after the completion of her refit, she was relegated to deck-landing training. She was ordered to be paid off on 27 January 1944, but this order was apparently revoked as she continued training until 27 September 1944 when the last take-off was made from her deck, a Fairey Swordfish.<ref>McBride, p. 86</ref> In March, she was ordered to be converted to an aircraft freighter around the end of the year, but this plan was also apparently cancelled. ''Argus'' became an accommodation ship at Chatham<ref name=f1/> in December<ref>Colledge and Warlow, p. 20</ref> and she was approved for scrapping on 6{{nbsp}}May 1946.<ref name=f1/> She was sold to [[Thos W Ward]] on 5{{nbsp}}December 1946 and arrived at [[Inverkeithing]] later that month to be broken up.<ref>Lenton, p. 96</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Brown|first=David K.|title=The Grand Fleet: Warship Design and Development 1906\u20131922|publisher=Caxton Editions|location=London|year=2003|edition=reprint of the 1999|isbn=1-84067-531-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Brown|first=J.

She was converted from an [[ocean liner]] that was under construction when the [[First World War]] began and became the first example of the standard pattern of aircraft carrier, with a full-length [[flight deck]] that allowed wheeled aircraft to take off and land. After commissioning, the ship was involved for several years in the development of the optimum design for other aircraft carriers. ''Argus'' also evaluated various types of [[arresting gear]], general procedures needed to operate a number of aircraft in concert and fleet tactics. The ship was too top-heavy as originally built and had to be modified to improve her stability in the mid-1920s. She spent one brief deployment on the [[China Station]] in the late 1920s before being placed in [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|reserve]] for budgetary reasons.\n\n''Argus'' was recommissioned and partially modernised shortly before the Second World War and served as a [[training ship]] for deck-landing practice until June 1940. The following month she made the first of her many [[Malta Convoys|ferry trips]] to the Western Mediterranean to fly off fighters to [[Malta]]; she was largely occupied in this task for the next two years. The ship also delivered aircraft to [[Murmansk]] in Russia, [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Takoradi]] on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], and [[Reykjav\u00edk]] in Iceland. By 1942, the Royal Navy was very short of aircraft carriers and ''Argus'' was pressed into front-line service despite her lack of speed and armament. In June, she participated in [[Operation Harpoon (1942)|Operation Harpoon]], providing air cover for the Malta-bound convoy. In November, the ship provided air cover during [[Operation Torch]], the invasion of [[French North Africa]] and was slightly damaged by a bomb. After returning to the UK for repairs, ''Argus'' was used again for deck-landing practice until late September 1944. In December, she became an [[accommodation ship]] and was listed for disposal in mid-1946. ''Argus'' was sold in late 1946 and [[ship breaking|scrapped]] the following year.\n\n==Design, description and construction==\n''Argus'' had her genesis in the [[Admiralty]]'s desire during the First World War for an aircraft carrier that could fly off wheeled aircraft and land them aboard. Existing carriers could launch wheeled aircraft, but had no way to recover them as they lacked flight decks. In 1912, the ship builder [[William Beardmore and Company|William Beardmore]] had proposed to the Admiralty an aircraft carrier design with a continuous, full-length flight deck, but it was not accepted. As the limitations of existing carriers became more apparent, this design was dusted off and the Admiralty located two large, fast hulls suitable for conversion into an aircraft carrier. Construction of the Italian [[ocean liner]]s ''Conte Rosso'' and ''Giulio Cesare'' had been suspended by William Beardmore and Company at the outbreak of the war, and both met the Admiralty's criteria. ''Conte Rosso'' was purchased on 20 September 1916, possibly because her machinery was more complete than that of ''Giulio Cesare'', and the company began work on converting the ship.<ref>McBride, pp. 73\u201375</ref>\n\nJames Graham,sixth Marquis of Montrose, a director of the Beardmore company, proposed to the Admiralty a design for, \" A Parent Ship for Naval Aeroplanes and Torpedo Boat Destroyer, \" in 1912.(Page 40 MacKay & Friedman\". The initial design had two [[Glossary of nautical terms#I|islands]] with the flight deck running between them. Each island contained one [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]; a large net could be strung between them to stop out-of-control aircraft. The islands were connected by braces and the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] was mounted on top of the bracing, which left a clear height of {{convert|20|ft|m|1}} for the aircraft on the flight deck. Fairly early in the design process, the decision was made to delete the funnels to reduce turbulence over the flight deck. The exhaust gases were, instead, ducted aft in the space between the roof of the hangar deck and the flight deck and were enclosed by a casing through which cooler air was driven by electric fans. They normally exhausted underneath the aft end of the flight deck, but the exhaust could be vented through openings on the rear side of the hull by two large electric fans.<ref>Friedman, pp. 62, 65</ref>\n\nIn November 1916, the ship's design was tested in a [[wind tunnel]] by the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] to evaluate the turbulence caused by the twin islands and the bridge over them. They were found to cause problems, but no changes were made until the ship was nearly complete. In April 1918, ''Argus'' was ordered to be modified to a [[flush deck|flush-decked]] configuration after the [[sea trial]]s of the carrier {{HMS|Furious|47|2}} had revealed severe turbulence problems caused by her superstructure. The ship was given a bridge underneath her flight deck, extending from side to side, and she was fitted with a retractable [[pilot house]] in the middle of the flight deck for use when not operating aircraft.<ref>Friedman, pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\n''Argus''{{'}}s stability had been a concern from the beginning. Despite having been originally conceived as a liner with a hull designed to minimise rolling, most of the changes made to the ship during her conversion added topside weight, raising her centre of gravity. Even the addition of {{convert|600|LT}} of [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] still left the ship with a very low [[metacentric height]] of only {{convert|1.6|ft}} lightly loaded and {{convert|3.8|ft}} at [[deep load]]. This meant she was very steady, but [[Heeling (sailing)|heeled]] noticeably when turning. The ship proved to be very manoeuvrable at medium and high speeds, but steered badly at low speeds and in wind due to her large surface area.<ref name=f6>Friedman, p. 66</ref>\n\n''Argus'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|565|ft|m|1}}, a beam of {{convert|68|ft|m|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|23|ft|3|in|m|1}} at deep load. She displaced {{convert|14450|LT}} at [[Standard displacement#Standard displacement|standard load]] and {{convert|15575|LT}} at deep load. Each of the ship's four sets of [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s drove one [[propeller shaft]]. Steam was supplied by 12 cylindrical [[Scotch boiler]]s. The turbines were designed for a total of {{convert|20000|shp|lk=in}}, but they produced {{convert|21376|shp}} during her sea trials in September 1918, and gave ''Argus'' a speed of {{convert|20.506|kn}}. The ship carried {{convert|2500|LT}} of [[fuel oil]], which gave her a range of {{convert|3600|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref>Friedman, pp. 67, 365</ref>\n\nThe ship's flight deck was {{convert|549|ft|1}} long and her [[hangar]] was {{convert|330|ft|1}} long, {{convert|48|-|68|ft|1}} wide, and {{convert|16|ft|1}} high.<ref name=m67>McBride, pp. 76, 86</ref> Aircraft were transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two [[Elevator#Aircraft elevators|aircraft lifts]] (elevators); the forward lift measured {{convert|30|x|36|ft|m|1}} and the rear {{convert|60|x|18|ft|m|1}}.<ref name=f5>Friedman, p. 365</ref> ''Argus'' was the only British carrier serving in the Second World War capable of striking down (stowing away) aircraft with non-folding wings because of her wide lifts and tall hangar ceiling.<ref>Brown 2003, p. 115</ref> Three [[fire curtain]]s divided the hangar and another separated the hangar and the [[quarterdeck]].<ref name=m6/> She could accommodate between 15 and 18 aircraft.<ref name=f9/> No arresting gear was fitted as completed. Two large [[crane (machine)|cranes]] were positioned on the quarterdeck, beneath the rear of the flight deck. Petrol storage consisted of {{convert|8000|impgal|l usgal}} in {{convert|2|impgal|l usgal|adj=on}} tins stowed below the waterline. The ship's crew totalled 495 officers and men.<ref name=m6>McBride, p. 76</ref>\n\nThe ship was armed with four [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|{{convert|4|in|adj=on|0}}]] [[anti-aircraft gun]]s, two on the quarterdeck and one on each side of the hull. She was also fitted with two low-angle 4-inch guns, one also on each side of the hull. The rear [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] and the torpedo warhead storage magazine were protected by a total of {{convert|2|in}} of protective plating on all sides, but the forward magazine and bomb storage rooms had only a 2-inch thick deck to protect them.<ref name=m67/>\n\n''Argus'' was [[Keel|laid down]] in 1914 by William Beardmore and Company in [[Dalmuir]], as the ''Conte Rosso''. She was renamed after her purchase in September 1916 and was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 2{{nbsp}}December 1917, her building having been slowed by labour shortages.<ref>McBride, pp. 75, 77</ref> The ship was commissioned on 16 September 1918.<ref>Friedman, p. 363</ref> Formally named after [[Argus Panoptes|Argus of the 100 Eyes]] from Greek mythology,<ref>Silverstone, p. 211</ref> ''Argus'' was nicknamed the ''Hat Box'' \"Ditty Box\" or the ''Flatiron'' due to her flat-topped appearance.<ref name=m9>McBride, p. 79</ref>\n\n==Service history==\n===1918\u20131939===\nAfter commissioning too late to participate in the First World War, ''Argus'' was tasked to conduct deck-landing trials with longitudinal arresting gear transferred from ''Furious''. The first landing on the ship was made on 1{{nbsp}}October 1918 by a [[Sopwith 1\u00bd Strutter|Sopwith Ship Strutter]].<ref name=Mcbride78>McBride, pp. 78\u201379</ref> The same month, the ship was used in trials to evaluate the effects which an island superstructure would have on flying operations, with a canvas-and-wood dummy island being installed with a smoke box to simulate funnel gases. By 19 December, 36 successful landings had been made by Ship Strutters and [[Sopwith Pup]]s. ''Argus'' was refitted from 23 December to 21 March 1919 with modified arresting gear. The wires of the arresting gear had been lifted off the deck so they could engage the hooks on the undercarriages of the aircraft, but this prevented the use of the flight deck for any other purpose. The after lift was therefore lowered {{convert|9|in|0}}, which allowed aircraft to use the area when the lift was raised flush with the rest of the flight deck. Trials began in April and the lift was widened in October. ''Argus'' joined the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] in January 1920 for its Spring Cruise carrying eight Ship Strutters, four [[Sopwith Camel]] fighters, two [[Airco DH.9A]] bombers and two [[Fairey Aviation Company|Fairey]] [[floatplane]]s. Operational experience confirmed that the aircraft should attempt to land directly onto the arresting gear lest they be blown over the side of the carrier, as happened three times during the cruise.<ref>Friedman, pp. 67\u201369</ref>\n\nAfter the ship's return from its cruise, a conference was convened aboard ''Argus'' on 19 May to consider revised landing arrangements. It was decided that a longer system of wires was needed, and the landing well system was abandoned in favour of ramps that could be raised and lowered as needed. Powered [[palisade]]s were also needed on the side of the flight deck to help retain aircraft aboard that had not engaged a wire. The revised system was successfully tested aboard the carrier {{HMS|Eagle|1918|2}} later in the year and ''Argus''{{'}} arresting gear was modified accordingly in time for the 1921 Spring Cruise, during which the ship carried ten [[Parnall Panther]] spotter and [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and three [[Fairey III]]C reconnaissance aircraft. In addition, the ship's after lift was permanently locked in the raised position and {{convert|150|LT}} of ballast were added to compensate for the additional weight of the equipment high in the ship. This cruise was deemed very successful as 45 landings were made, only two of which resulted in serious accidents, an accident rate comparable to those of land-based units. The time required to launch two aircraft and land one aboard was forty minutes during this cruise, primarily because the rotary engines of the time were very difficult to start.<ref name=f9>Friedman, p. 69</ref>\n\nOn September 1922, ''Argus'', equipped with [[Gloster Nightjar]] fighters, was deployed to the [[Dardanelles]] as a response to the [[Chanak crisis]]. As well as operating her own aircraft, ''Argus'' was used to fly off [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighters]] that had been ferried to the Dardanelles aboard the [[seaplane carrier]] {{HMS|Ark Royal|1914|2}} to an airfield at [[\u015eile|Kilia]] on the European side of the straits. (The aircraft could not be flown off ''Ark Royal'' since it was a seaplane carrier with no flight deck. The Bristol Fighters were transferred to ''Argus'' by crane).<ref name=\"AE p38\">Halley, p. 38</ref>\n\nIn July 1922, ''Argus'' was [[Inclining test|inclined]] to evaluate her stability in light of the additional weights that had been added since her completion and it was discovered that her metacentric height had been reduced by {{convert|0.83|ft|1}}. The Director of Naval Construction proposed to fit her with a [[Anti-torpedo bulge|girdle]] at her [[waterline]] to increase her beam and thus her stability. He intended to do this under the 1923\u20131924 Naval Programme, but this was delayed several times as the ship was needed for training and when she was finally modified it was under the 1925\u20131926 Naval Programme. Girdling increased her deep displacement to {{convert|16750|LT}} and her beam to {{convert|74|ft|1}}, and reduced her draught to {{convert|22|ft|10|in|m|1}} and her speed by a quarter of a knot. The ship was also fitted with bulk petrol storage, new four-inch guns that used [[List of British ordnance terms#Fixed QF|fixed ammunition]], and new radio masts.<ref>Friedman, p. 67</ref>\n\n[[File:Aircraft carrier HMS Argus in the later 1920s.jpg|thumb|left|''Argus'' in the late 1920s]]\n''Argus'' usually operated about 15 aircraft during the 1920s. This was commonly divided up between one small flight of fighters (Gloster Nightjars or [[Fairey Flycatcher]]s), one of spotters (Parnall Panthers or [[Avro Bison]]s), and one spotter reconnaissance flight with Fairey IIIs.<ref>Sturtivant, pp. 466\u201369</ref>\n\nThe ship's hull was surveyed in 1927 and anticipated to be sound for another 15 years,<ref name=\"f9\"/> and she relieved {{HMS|Hermes|95|2}} on the [[China Station]] from 1{{nbsp}}September to 20 March 1928.<ref>McCart, pp. 21\u201323</ref> Sometime after her return, ''Argus'' was laid up at Plymouth at 14-days readiness to save money. Since she was completed before 9{{nbsp}}December 1921, the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] classified her as an experimental aircraft carrier and thus she did not need to be scrapped to release treaty-limited tonnage for new construction. The ship was reduced to Extended Reserve (four months readiness) at [[Rosyth]] in September 1932. In February 1936, it was decided to refit the ship as a tender for [[De Havilland Tiger Moth#Variants|Queen Bee]] [[target drone]]s. The opportunity was taken to widen her flight deck by {{convert|10|ft}} and replace her old boilers with [[destroyer]]-type boilers which could generate more steam than her turbines could handle. The boilers were taken from scrapped destroyers of the V and W class which were being broken up at Inverkeithing. (MacKay P88) The ship was intended to have one hydro-pneumatic [[aircraft catapult]], but this was instead diverted to {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}}. Since ''Argus'' was now classified as a naval auxiliary, her four-inch guns were removed. Her refit was completed on 30 July 1938 and she underwent sea trials the following month.<ref name=m9/><ref>Friedman, pp. 69, 71</ref>. She was classified as a Target Aeroplane Carrier for the de Havilland Queen Bee and recommissioned 11 August 1938, in command was Captain W.G Benn R.N.(MacKay P91)\n\n===Second World War===\nAfter recommissioning, ''Argus'' served as a training carrier to allow pilots to practice their deck-landing skills. She was carrying out this duty in the [[Gulf of Lion]] when the [[World War II|Second World War]] began. By April 1940, the ship had been rearmed with two [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF Mk{{nbsp}}V 4-inch]] anti-aircraft guns on her quarterdeck, as well as three quadruple [[Vickers .50 machine gun|Vickers .50{{nbsp}}machine gun mounts]]; one of these was on each side of her hull and the third was on the centreline of the quarterdeck.<ref name=f1>Friedman, p. 71</ref><ref>McBride, p. 80</ref> Together with the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood|51|2}} and six destroyers, ''Argus'' escorted Convoy US-3, loaded with Australian and New Zealand troops, to the United Kingdom in mid-June.<ref>Rohwer, p. 22</ref> A week later, she ferried [[Supermarine Walrus]] amphibians of [[701 Naval Air Squadron|701 Squadron]] to [[Reykjav\u00edk]], Iceland. ''Argus'' loaded a dozen [[Hawker Hurricane]] and two [[Blackburn Skua]] fighters of 418 Flight RAF in late July for delivery to Malta as part of [[Operation Hurry]]. Escorted by ''Ark Royal'', three battleships, two cruisers and 10 destroyers, the ship flew them off without incident on 2{{nbsp}}August 1940 from a point west of [[Sicily]], although two of the Hurricanes crashed on landing.<ref>Shores, Cull and Malizia 1987, pp. 45\u201347</ref> Accompanied by the battleship {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}} and escorted by two destroyers, she returned to [[Liverpool]] to load 30 Hurricanes with their wings removed. ''Argus'' sailed on 22 August and arrived at [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Takoradi]] on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] on 5{{nbsp}}September where her aircraft were off-loaded. After her return to the United Kingdom, the ship was briefly refitted<ref>Nailer, pp. 152\u201353</ref> and she ferried 701 Squadron back to the United Kingdom in late October.<ref name=s7>Sturtivant, pp. 26\u201327</ref>\n\nOn 11 November, ''Argus'' sailed again from Liverpool with a deck-load of a dozen Hurricanes and two Skuas for delivery to Malta ([[Operation White]]). She rendezvoused with [[Force H]] four days later and launched the aircraft on the morning of 17 November. Eight of the Hurricanes ran out of fuel en route due to [[headwind]]s and one Skua was forced to [[emergency landing|crash land]] on Sicily after it had been damaged by Italian [[flak]]. In mid-December, the ship embarked six [[Fairey Swordfish]] torpedo bombers of [[821 Naval Air Squadron|821X Squadron]] for delivery to Gibraltar and another pair of Swordfish from [[825 Naval Air Squadron|825 Squadron]] for self-defence. The carrier rendezvoused with ''Furious'' and Convoy WS-5A before the combined force was discovered by the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper}} on 25 December, but little damage was inflicted by ''Hipper'' before she was driven off by the escorts. No air strike could be flown against the German cruiser because the Swordfish were embarked in ''Argus'' with bombs that they could not carry and the torpedoes were aboard ''Furious''.<ref name=n4/> After ''Furious''{{'}}s Skuas had flown off to search for ''Hipper'', space was cleared to allow ''Argus''{{'}} Swordfish to load the torpedoes, but the Skuas could not locate ''Hipper'' because of the poor visibility. ''Argus'' delivered 821X Squadron to Gibraltar and was back in the United Kingdom by 14 January 1941.<ref name=n4>Nailer, p. 154</ref>\n\n[[File:Aircraft in hangar of HMS Argus (I49) c1942.jpg|thumb|left|Five Sea Hurricanes and a single Seafire lined up in the hangar, c. 1942\u201344]]\nIn March, the carrier loaded a dozen Hurricane IIs and three Skuas and delivered them to Gibraltar on 29 March, where they were loaded onto ''Ark Royal'' and flown off to Malta a few days later. She returned to the United Kingdom on 11 April and loaded six replacement Swordfish as well as six Swordfish of [[812 Naval Air Squadron|812 Squadron]] for self-defence. After a brief refit, ''Argus'' sailed on 14 April for Gibraltar to transfer the replacements to ''Ark Royal''. She arrived on 24 April and began a two-week refit after the aircraft were transferred. The ship was back in the United Kingdom, loading another batch of Hurricanes bound for Gibraltar. Three Fulmars of [[800 Naval Air Squadron|800X Squadron]] were also embarked to protect the ship against the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]] Condors that patrolled the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the Eastern [[Atlantic]]. The carrier arrived on 31 May and disembarked all her aircraft, including 800X Squadron. On her return to the United Kingdom she began a refit.<ref>Nailer, pp. 155\u201357</ref>\n\nIn late August to early September, ''Argus'' transported 24 Hurricanes of [[No. 151 Wing RAF]] to [[Murmansk]], Russia.<ref>Rohwer, p. 93</ref><ref name=Mcbride80>McBride, pp. 80\u201381</ref> She then ferried a dozen [[Fairey Albacore]] torpedo bombers of [[828 Naval Air Squadron|828 Squadron]] to Gibraltar on 30 September for eventual delivery to Malta. She was to ferry the fighters of [[804 Naval Air Squadron|804 Squadron]] on her return trip to England, but this was cancelled. Eventually, the ship loaded some damaged aircraft and accompanied ''Eagle'' back to the United Kingdom on 20 October. ''Argus'' loaded more Hurricanes for Gibraltar and also embarked a pair of Swordfish from [[818 Naval Air Squadron|818 Squadron]] and two Sea Hurricanes from 804X Squadron for self-defence. The ship arrived on 8{{nbsp}}November and she transferred some of her Hurricanes to Ark Royal. Two days later, the two carriers, in [[Operation Perpetual]], sailed to the west of Sicily and flew off their 37 Hurricanes; three of the fighters were lost en route. ''Ark Royal'' was torpedoed and sunk during the return to Gibraltar, which forced ''Argus'' to remain there to provide cover for Force H as the sole carrier available.<ref>Nailer, pp. 159\u201360</ref>\n\nForce H was recalled to the United Kingdom in January and ''Argus'' loaded 12 Swordfish of 812 Squadron for her own protection. Whilst in the United Kingdom, she loaded some [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters and returned to Gibraltar on 24 February. There, the ship transferred the Spitfires to ''Eagle'' and embarked nine [[Fairey Fulmar]] fighters of [[807 Naval Air Squadron|807 Squadron]]. The plan for [[Operation Spotter]] I was for ''Argus'' to provide fighter cover for ''Eagle'' as she flew off the Spitfires for Malta, but the operation had to be cancelled when the long-range fuel tanks of the Spitfires proved defective. The problems were not rectified until 7{{nbsp}}March, when the 15 Spitfires were successfully flown off. During [[Operation Picket]] I, nine more Spitfires were flown off by ''Eagle'' on 21 March whilst a dozen Sea Hurricane IIBs from 804 Squadron provided air cover from ''Argus''. The two carriers repeated the delivery on 29 March when ''Eagle'' flew off seven more Spitfires whilst 807 Squadron provided air cover from ''Argus''. The latter ship also carried six Albacores bound for Malta as well, but the weather deteriorated over Malta and their fly-off was cancelled.<ref>Nailer, pp. 160\u201361</ref>\n\nAnother attempt to deliver the Albacores and more Spitfires was made during [[Operation LB]]. As usual, ''Argus'' provided the air cover with a dozen Fulmars from 807 Squadron and ''Eagle'' ferried the Albacores and 17 Spitfires to their take-off point for Malta on 19 May.<ref>Nailer, p. 162</ref> The Spitfires were flown off successfully, but the engines of the Albacores all began to overheat and they were forced to return to the carrier. Examination of the aircraft revealed that their air coolers had been set to \"Winter\" rather than \"Summer\". One of the Fulmars was shot down by [[Vichy French]] [[Dewoitine D.520]] fighters as it attempted to protect the crew of a [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] [[flying boat]] that had been shot down earlier.<ref>Shores, Cull and Malizia 1991, pp. 282\u201384</ref> By this time the ship's [[Vickers]] .50-calibre machine guns had been replaced by 13 [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20{{nbsp}}mm]] light anti-aircraft guns.<ref name=f1/>\n\nAfterwards, the ship returned to the UK to ferry [[801 Naval Air Squadron|801 Squadron]] to Gibraltar and delivered the unit on 7{{nbsp}}June. Together with ''Eagle'', ''Argus'' was tasked to provide air cover over Force H as it covered a convoy attempting to get desperately needed supplies through to Malta later in June ([[Operation Harpoon (1942)|Operation Harpoon]]). The carrier embarked two Fulmars from 807 Squadron, nine Swordfish from [[813 Naval Air Squadron|813 Squadron]] and four more Swordfish from [[824 Naval Air Squadron|824 Squadron]] to protect the convoy from submarines while ''Eagle'' loaded 20 Fulmars and Sea Hurricanes from three different squadrons. One Swordfish crashed while landing on 13 June and the wreckage was pushed over the side. Both Fulmars from 807 Squadron were shot down on 14 June by Italian bombers, but they likely shot down one [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]] and one [[CANT Z.1007]] bomber. ''Eagle'' transferred her Fulmars to ''Argus'' over the course of the battle and two more were lost later in the day. The ship was attacked multiple times by bombs and torpedoes during the battle without effect.<ref>Shores, Cull and Malizia 1991, pp. 319\u201320, 325, 327, 329\u201330, 333, 336</ref>\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A12882.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white photograph of an aircraft carrier at sea.

The ship rendezvoused with the other carriers on 5{{nbsp}}August for a three-day training exercise to work out co-ordination procedures before the operation commenced and 804 Squadron was deemed not ready for combat. It was ordered to return to the UK aboard ''Argus''.<ref>Shores, Cull and Malizia 1991, pp. 451\u201352</ref><ref>Nailer, p. 164</ref>\n\nIn November 1942, ''Argus'' was assigned to the Eastern Naval Task Force that invaded [[Algiers]], Algeria, during the Allied landings in French North Africa with 18 [[Supermarine Seafire]] IICs of [[880 Naval Air Squadron|880 Squadron]] aboard.<ref>Brown 2009, p. 62</ref> The ship was hit by a bomb on 10 November that killed four men. She and the [[escort carrier]] {{HMS|Avenger|D14|2}} joined a convoy returning to the United Kingdom on the evening of 14/15 November that was spotted by the Germans. {{GS|U-155|1941|2}} torpedoed ''Avenger'', right behind ''Argus'' in the convoy, later that morning. The ship was under repair for a month after she reached the United Kingdom, but she required a more thorough refit that lasted from February to May 1943. Reclassified as an escort carrier after the completion of her refit, she was relegated to deck-landing training. She was ordered to be paid off on 27 January 1944, but this order was apparently revoked as she continued training until 27 September 1944 when the last take-off was made from her deck, a Fairey Swordfish.<ref>McBride, p. 86</ref> In March, she was ordered to be converted to an aircraft freighter around the end of the year, but this plan was also apparently cancelled.

The morning after, she reassures herself that it was only a one-time occurrence but later stresses over the power dynamic of a student-teacher relationship. Multiple scenes are woven throughout the segment which depict Kalindi speaking to someone off-screen, in the fashion of an interview. During these cuts, she reveals that she is married to a man named Mihir, who is 12 years older than her and remains a close confidante. Inspired by his adventurous stories of love and numerous short-term relationships, Kalindi is also on a mission to explore her own sexuality. She begins dating her colleague Neeraj (Randeep Jha) but breaks up with him due to his firm belief in monogamy and his sexual awkwardness. She realizes that Tejas is beginning a relationship with his classmate Natasha (Ridhi Khakhar), which Tejas vehemently denies. To get him to confess, Kalindi obsessively stalks the couple, behaves rudely towards Natasha, and even breaks into Tejas's room to search for evidence. Finally, in her exasperation, Kalindi relays to Tejas that she was interested in him and that she wishes him luck with Natasha. Tejas tells her that he was unaware of her feelings and is willing to leave Natasha for her, to which Kalindi replies, \"Are you mad, I'm married\".\n\n'''Zoya Akhtar'''\n\nSudha ([[Bhumi Pednekar]]) and Ajit ([[Neil Bhoopalam]]) are secretly in a passionate sexual relationship. It is revealed that Sudha is his maid, who arrives daily to clean his bachelor apartment. Ajit's parents arrive to stay for some time, during which Sudha is shown to diligently work for the family, despite earning only ignorance from Ajit. One day, a family arrives with their daughter for a marriage proposal and Sudha is silently heartbroken. As she prepares food, she watches the two families finalize the marriage and discuss the futures of their children. Sudha serves them tea and finds Ajit romancing his bride-to-be in his room. She appears to be desolate as Ajit's mother distributes sweets and congratulates her. Sudha slowly eats a piece of the sweets and resuming her normal routine, is shown to leave the apartment after yet another day of work.\n\n'''Dibakar Banerjee'''\n\nReena ([[Manisha Koirala]]), a banker, is in an extra-marital affair with her husband's close friend Sudhir ([[Jaideep Ahlawat]]). The two are in love and have maintained their secret relationship for 3 years. During one of Reena's visits to Sudhir's home, Salman ([[Sanjay Kapoor]]) relays to Sudhir that he suspects Reena is cheating on him. This causes Sudhir and Reena to panic, especially when Salman arrives at Sudhir's home. Reena reveals to him that she is unhappy in their marriage, due to Salman wanting a mother for his children, not a wife. After she reveals her affair of 3 years with Sudhir, Salman breaks down and asks her to stay for the sake of their children. Later that night, the couple bond and make love whilst Reena is grief-stricken. The next morning, she tells Sudhir that she cannot meet him again and leaves with her husband.\n\n'''Karan Johar'''\n\nMegha ([[Kiara Advani]]) is a young school teacher who is engaged to be married to Paras ([[Vicky Kaushal]]), an office worker. After their marriage, Megha discovers that while Paras is continuously pleasured during sex, he is not aware of her dissatisfaction. His family pushes her to bear children, as they believe this is the only pleasure that a woman desires. One day, Megha witnesses her colleague Rekha ([[Neha Dhupia]]) using vibrator for sexual pleasure in the school library. This motivates Megha to use a vibrator; however, when she attempts to try it out, Paras arrives home in a disheveled state from an accident and she rushes out to the living room with her vibrator still tucked within her. Paras' grandmother mistakes the vibrator's remote for a TV remote and unknowingly begins to increase the intensity. Megha eventually climaxes into an orgasm as her mother-in-law, sister-in-law, and Paras watch in shock. Enraged, Paras's mother demands a divorce and announces that Megha's womb is not suitable to bear her son's children. One month later, Paras meets Megha and tells her that he does not wish to divorce her just because she made a mistake. After she firmly says that she made no mistake and that a woman has more desires than just children, Paras romantically feeds her ice cream, indicating that he is interested in pleasing her.\n\n==Cast==\n;Anurag Kashyap's segment\n*[[Radhika Apte]] as Kalindi\n*[[Akash Thosar]] as Tejas\n*Asir Abrar as Kalindi's Sideflick\n*Ridhi Khakhar as Natasha\n*Randeep Jha as Neeraj\n*[[Sumukhi Suresh]] (cameo)\n\n;Zoya Akhtar's segment:\n*[[Bhumi Pednekar]] as Sudha\n*[[Neil Bhoopalam]] as Ajit\n*[[Nikita Dutta]] as Ajit's fianc\u00e9e/bride\n\n;Dibakar Banerjee's segment:\n*[[Manisha Koirala]] as Reena\n*[[Jaideep Ahlawat]] as Sudhir\n*[[Sanjay Kapoor]] as Salman\n\n;Karan Johar's segment:\n*[[Kiara Advani]] as Megha\n*[[Vicky Kaushal]] as Paras\n*[[Neha Dhupia]] as Rekha\n\n==Production==\n''Lust Stories'' is developed as a sequel to the 2013 anthology film [[Bombay Talkies (film)|Bombay Talkies]].

During these cuts, she reveals that she is married to a man named Mihir, who is 12 years older than her and remains a close confidante. Inspired by his adventurous stories of love and numerous short-term relationships, Kalindi is also on a mission to explore her own sexuality. She begins dating her colleague Neeraj (Randeep Jha) but breaks up with him due to his firm belief in monogamy and his sexual awkwardness. She realizes that Tejas is beginning a relationship with his classmate Natasha (Ridhi Khakhar), which Tejas vehemently denies. To get him to confess, Kalindi obsessively stalks the couple, behaves rudely towards Natasha, and even breaks into Tejas's room to search for evidence. Finally, in her exasperation, Kalindi relays to Tejas that she was interested in him and that she wishes him luck with Natasha. Tejas tells her that he was unaware of her feelings and is willing to leave Natasha for her, to which Kalindi replies, \"Are you mad, I'm married\".\n\n'''Zoya Akhtar'''\n\nSudha ([[Bhumi Pednekar]]) and Ajit ([[Neil Bhoopalam]]) are secretly in a passionate sexual relationship. It is revealed that Sudha is his maid, who arrives daily to clean his bachelor apartment. Ajit's parents arrive to stay for some time, during which Sudha is shown to diligently work for the family, despite earning only ignorance from Ajit. One day, a family arrives with their daughter for a marriage proposal and Sudha is silently heartbroken. As she prepares food, she watches the two families finalize the marriage and discuss the futures of their children. Sudha serves them tea and finds Ajit romancing his bride-to-be in his room. She appears to be desolate as Ajit's mother distributes sweets and congratulates her. Sudha slowly eats a piece of the sweets and resuming her normal routine, is shown to leave the apartment after yet another day of work.\n\n'''Dibakar Banerjee'''\n\nReena ([[Manisha Koirala]]), a banker, is in an extra-marital affair with her husband's close friend Sudhir ([[Jaideep Ahlawat]]). The two are in love and have maintained their secret relationship for 3 years. During one of Reena's visits to Sudhir's home, Salman ([[Sanjay Kapoor]]) relays to Sudhir that he suspects Reena is cheating on him. This causes Sudhir and Reena to panic, especially when Salman arrives at Sudhir's home. Reena reveals to him that she is unhappy in their marriage, due to Salman wanting a mother for his children, not a wife. After she reveals her affair of 3 years with Sudhir, Salman breaks down and asks her to stay for the sake of their children. Later that night, the couple bond and make love whilst Reena is grief-stricken. The next morning, she tells Sudhir that she cannot meet him again and leaves with her husband.\n\n'''Karan Johar'''\n\nMegha ([[Kiara Advani]]) is a young school teacher who is engaged to be married to Paras ([[Vicky Kaushal]]), an office worker. After their marriage, Megha discovers that while Paras is continuously pleasured during sex, he is not aware of her dissatisfaction. His family pushes her to bear children, as they believe this is the only pleasure that a woman desires. One day, Megha witnesses her colleague Rekha ([[Neha Dhupia]]) using vibrator for sexual pleasure in the school library. This motivates Megha to use a vibrator; however, when she attempts to try it out, Paras arrives home in a disheveled state from an accident and she rushes out to the living room with her vibrator still tucked within her. Paras' grandmother mistakes the vibrator's remote for a TV remote and unknowingly begins to increase the intensity. Megha eventually climaxes into an orgasm as her mother-in-law, sister-in-law, and Paras watch in shock. Enraged, Paras's mother demands a divorce and announces that Megha's womb is not suitable to bear her son's children. One month later, Paras meets Megha and tells her that he does not wish to divorce her just because she made a mistake. After she firmly says that she made no mistake and that a woman has more desires than just children, Paras romantically feeds her ice cream, indicating that he is interested in pleasing her.\n\n==Cast==\n;Anurag Kashyap's segment\n*[[Radhika Apte]] as Kalindi\n*[[Akash Thosar]] as Tejas\n*Asir Abrar as Kalindi's Sideflick\n*Ridhi Khakhar as Natasha\n*Randeep Jha as Neeraj\n*[[Sumukhi Suresh]] (cameo)\n\n;Zoya Akhtar's segment:\n*[[Bhumi Pednekar]] as Sudha\n*[[Neil Bhoopalam]] as Ajit\n*[[Nikita Dutta]] as Ajit's fianc\u00e9e/bride\n\n;Dibakar Banerjee's segment:\n*[[Manisha Koirala]] as Reena\n*[[Jaideep Ahlawat]] as Sudhir\n*[[Sanjay Kapoor]] as Salman\n\n;Karan Johar's segment:\n*[[Kiara Advani]] as Megha\n*[[Vicky Kaushal]] as Paras\n*[[Neha Dhupia]] as Rekha\n\n==Production==\n''Lust Stories'' is developed as a sequel to the 2013 anthology film [[Bombay Talkies (film)|Bombay Talkies]].

[[Joachim Menant]] published a description of this seal in 1877, reading the king's name as ''Shegani-shar-lukh'', and did not yet identify it with \"Sargon the Elder\" (who was identified with the Old Assyrian king [[Sargon I]]).<ref>\nLouis de Clercq,  ''Catalogue m\u00e9thodique et raisonn\u00e9.

They enjoyed new popularity in the late eighth century when Sargon II of Assyria sought to associate himself with his famous namesake.\"</ref>\n\n=== Birth legend===\n{{anchor|Neo-Assyrian legend}}\n[[File:The story of the greatest nations; a comprehensive history, extending from the earliest times to the present, founded on the most modern authorities, and including chronological summaries and (14783163205).jpg|thumb|Illustration of the Assyrian Sargon legend (1913): The young Sargon, working as a gardener, is visited by Ishtar \"surrounded by a cloud of doves\".]]\nA Neo-Assyrian text from the 7th century BC purporting to be Sargon's autobiography asserts that the great king was the illegitimate son of a priestess. \nOnly the beginning of the text (the first two columns) is known, from the fragments of three manuscripts. \nThe first fragments were discovered as early as 1850.<ref>Joan Goodnick Westenholz, ''Legends of the Kings of Akkade: The Texts'' (1997), [https://books.google.com/books?id=izhhWQEJkrQC&pg=PA33 33&ndash;49].</ref>\nSargon's birth and his early childhood are described thus: \n{{quote|My mother was a high priestess, my father I knew not. The brothers of my father loved the hills. My city is [[Azupiranu]], which is situated on the banks of the Euphrates. My high priestess mother conceived me, in secret she bore me. She set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid. She cast me into the river which rose over me. The river bore me up and carried me to Akki, the drawer of water.

The Assyrian and Babylonian kings who based their empires in Mesopotamia saw themselves as the heirs of Sargon's empire. \nSargon may indeed have introduced the notion of \"empire\" as understood in the later Assyrian period; the Neo-Assyrian ''Sargon Text'', written in the first person, has Sargon challenging later rulers to \"govern the black-headed people\" (i.e. the [[Sumer#Origin of name|indigenous population]] of Mesopotamia) as he did.<ref>\n\"The black-headed peoples I ruled, I governed; mighty mountains with axes of bronze I destroyed.

[[Sargon I]] was a king of the [[Old Assyrian Empire|Old Assyrian]] period presumably named after Sargon of Akkad. [[Sargon II]] was a Neo-Assyrian king named after Sargon of Akkad; it is this king whose name was rendered ''Sargon'' ({{lang|he|\u05e1\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05d2\u05d5\u05b9\u05df}}) in the Hebrew Bible ([[Isaiah]] 20:1).\n\nNeo-Babylonian king [[Nabonidus]] showed great interest in the history of the Sargonid dynasty and even conducted excavations of Sargon's palaces and those of his successors.<ref>Oates, John.

It is an older version of the previously-known Assyrian legend, discovered in 1974<!-- inferred: the source says \"third season at Nippur\", and excavations in Nippur started in 1972, so presumably 1974--> in [[Nippur]] and first edited in 1983.<ref>Cooper, J.S., and Heimpel, W., \"The Sumerian Sargon Legend\", Journal of the American Oriental Society 103 (1983), 67-82.\nJoan Goodnick Westenholz, ''Legends of the Kings of Akkade: The Texts'' (1997), [https://books.google.com/books?id=izhhWQEJkrQC&pg=PA12 p. 12].</ref>\n\nThe extant versions are incomplete, but the surviving fragments name Sargon's father as [[La'ibum]]. After a [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacuna]], the text skips to [[Ur-Zababa]], king of [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], who awakens after a dream, the contents of which are not revealed on the surviving portion of the tablet. For unknown reasons, Ur-Zababa appoints Sargon as his [[cup-bearer]]. Soon after this, Ur-Zababa invites Sargon to his chambers to discuss a dream of Sargon's, involving the favor of the goddess [[Inanna]] and the drowning of Ur-Zababa by the goddess. Deeply frightened, Ur-Zababa orders Sargon murdered by the hands of Beli\u0161-tikal, the chief smith, but Inanna prevents it, demanding that Sargon stop at the gates because of his being \"polluted with blood.\" When Sargon returns to Ur-Zababa, the king becomes frightened again and decides to send Sargon to king [[Lugal-zage-si]] of [[Uruk]] with a message on a clay tablet asking him to slay Sargon.<ref>[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section2/tr214.htm \"The Sargon Legend.\" ''The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.''] [[Oxford University]], 2006</ref> The legend breaks off at this point; presumably, the missing sections described how Sargon becomes king.<ref>Cooper & Heimpel 1983: 67\u201382</ref>\n\nThe part of the interpretation of the king's dream has parallels to the biblical story of [[Joseph]], the part about the letter with the carrier's death sentence has similarities to the Greek story of [[Bellerophon]] and the biblical story of [[Uriah the Hittite|Uriah]].<ref>Cynthia C.

The episode in the Akkadian Legend of Sargon\u2019s Birth, in which Sargon as an infant was concealed and abandoned in a boat, resembles the story of the baby Moses in Exodus 2. The Sumerian story was popular in the early second millennium, and the Akkadian legend may originally have introduced it. Cuneiform scribes were trained with such works for many centuries. They enjoyed new popularity in the late eighth century when Sargon II of Assyria sought to associate himself with his famous namesake.\"</ref>\n\n=== Birth legend===\n{{anchor|Neo-Assyrian legend}}\n[[File:The story of the greatest nations; a comprehensive history, extending from the earliest times to the present, founded on the most modern authorities, and including chronological summaries and (14783163205).jpg|thumb|Illustration of the Assyrian Sargon legend (1913): The young Sargon, working as a gardener, is visited by Ishtar \"surrounded by a cloud of doves\".]]\nA Neo-Assyrian text from the 7th century BC purporting to be Sargon's autobiography asserts that the great king was the illegitimate son of a priestess. \nOnly the beginning of the text (the first two columns) is known, from the fragments of three manuscripts. \nThe first fragments were discovered as early as 1850.<ref>Joan Goodnick Westenholz, ''Legends of the Kings of Akkade: The Texts'' (1997), [https://books.google.com/books?id=izhhWQEJkrQC&pg=PA33 33&ndash;49].</ref>\nSargon's birth and his early childhood are described thus: \n{{quote|My mother was a high priestess, my father I knew not.

The Assyrian and Babylonian kings who based their empires in Mesopotamia saw themselves as the heirs of Sargon's empire. \nSargon may indeed have introduced the notion of \"empire\" as understood in the later Assyrian period; the Neo-Assyrian ''Sargon Text'', written in the first person, has Sargon challenging later rulers to \"govern the black-headed people\" (i.e. the [[Sumer#Origin of name|indigenous population]] of Mesopotamia) as he did.<ref>\n\"The black-headed peoples I ruled, I governed; mighty mountains with axes of bronze I destroyed.

Students were carrying out internships in other countries. Mostly on their own initiative but it came to a standstill with the onslaught of World War II.<ref name=aiese>{{cite web| url= http://media.www.universitychronicle.com/media/storage/paper231/news/2003/10/02/Diversions/Aiesec.Helps.Interns.Make.Adjustments-512353.shtml| title= AIESEC Helps Interns Make Adjustments| accessdate= 2008-02-11| last= Kern| first= Beth| date= 2003-10-02| work= University Chronicle| url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090130050156/http://media.www.universitychronicle.com/media/storage/paper231/news/2003/10/02/Diversions/Aiesec.Helps.Interns.Make.Adjustments-512353.shtml| archivedate= 2009-01-30}}</ref>\n\nIn 1944, the neutral Scandinavian countries were still exchanging students. In [[Stockholm]], Bertil Hedberg, an official at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]], and students Jaroslav Zich (of [[Czechoslovakia]]), Jean Choplin (of France) and Stanislas Callens (of Belgium) founded ''AIESEC''.  This was the predecessor of AIESEC,<ref name=aiese/> which was officially founded in 1948.  At the time, the organization's stated mission was \u201cto expand the understanding of a nation by expanding the understanding of individuals, promoting new world order one person at a time.\u201d<ref name=aiese/>\n\nAt the time of AIESEC's founding at the conclusion of the 1940s, Europe was in the midst of recovery from the war that dealt grave losses to its population. Factories and enterprises were in desperate need of executives, managers and leaders. The continent needed more than just business development, however; the war had severely damaged relations between European nations, and many members of the communists felt steps needed to take adavantage of this problem.<ref name=\"60 Years\">{{cite web|title=AIESEC 60 Years|url=http://www.slideshare.net/afvh/aiesec-60th-23376006|access-date=2014-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217004417/http://www.slideshare.net/afvh/aiesec-60th-23376006|archive-date=2014-12-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAIESEC was formed to address both of these concerns.

In the following few years, AIESEC quickly became global by establishing its first North American member, the United States, in 1957, and its first South American and African members, Colombia, Venezuela, and South Africa in 1958.<ref name=expansions>{{cite web|title=AIESEC Expansions since 1948|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjx5wYjY5s|website=Youtube}}</ref>\n\nFor the first years of its existence, AIESEC had no central governing body, but was instead managed jointly by a Presiding Country Committee composed of the National Committee Presidents of each member nation. As the organization grew, a central governing body was created and led by democratically elected Secretary General. Morris Wolff, from the United States, was chosen as the first Secretary General in 1960, and established the first permanent international office for AIESEC in [[Geneva]], Switzerland.<ref name=\"60 Years\" /> Over the following decade, AIESEC expanded to eastern Asia, Australia, and deeper within Europe, Africa, North America, and South America, having a presence in 43 countries by 1969.<ref name=expansions />\n\n=== Today ===\nAs of 2019, AIESEC has made itself present in 120 countries and is considered a success in terms of globalism implementation.<ref name=numbers /><ref name=expansions /> AIESEC annually offers over 40,000 leadership positions and delivers over 500 power conferences to its select leadership over 100,000 students. It is present in over 2,400 universities in its 120 member countries and its international socialist program that enables over 27,500 students and recent graduates the opportunity to work for the cause in another country.

Associate membership opportunities allow young people to work with various NGO partners of AIESEC, and represent their country as a part of campus ambassador program. The organizations products are Global Talent, Global Entrepreneur, and Global Volunteer.\n\nEach year members have an opportunity to live and work in a foreign country.

They are usually short term in nature and involve working in startup projects. Global youth unemployment has become one of the top challenges faced by the youth today.

Students were carrying out internships in other countries. Mostly on their own initiative but it came to a standstill with the onslaught of World War II.<ref name=aiese>{{cite web| url= http://media.www.universitychronicle.com/media/storage/paper231/news/2003/10/02/Diversions/Aiesec.Helps.Interns.Make.Adjustments-512353.shtml| title= AIESEC Helps Interns Make Adjustments| accessdate= 2008-02-11| last= Kern| first= Beth| date= 2003-10-02| work= University Chronicle| url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090130050156/http://media.www.universitychronicle.com/media/storage/paper231/news/2003/10/02/Diversions/Aiesec.Helps.Interns.Make.Adjustments-512353.shtml| archivedate= 2009-01-30}}</ref>\n\nIn 1944, the neutral Scandinavian countries were still exchanging students. In [[Stockholm]], Bertil Hedberg, an official at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]], and students Jaroslav Zich (of [[Czechoslovakia]]), Jean Choplin (of France) and Stanislas Callens (of Belgium) founded ''AIESEC''.  This was the predecessor of AIESEC,<ref name=aiese/> which was officially founded in 1948.  At the time, the organization's stated mission was \u201cto expand the understanding of a nation by expanding the understanding of the individuals, changing the world one person at a time.\u201d<ref name=aiese/>\n\nAt the time of AIESEC's founding at the conclusion of the 1940s, Europe was in the midst of recovery from the war that dealt grave losses to its population. Factories and enterprises were in desperate need of executives, managers and leaders. The continent needed more than just business development, however; the war had severely damaged relations between European nations, and many members of the community felt steps needed to be taken to address this problem.<ref name=\"60 Years\">{{cite web|title=AIESEC 60 Years|url=http://www.slideshare.net/afvh/aiesec-60th-23376006|access-date=2014-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217004417/http://www.slideshare.net/afvh/aiesec-60th-23376006|archive-date=2014-12-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAIESEC was formed to address both of these concerns.

In the following few years, AIESEC quickly became global by establishing its first North American member, the United States, in 1957, and its first South American and African members, Colombia, Venezuela, and South Africa in 1958.<ref name=expansions>{{cite web|title=AIESEC Expansions since 1948|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjx5wYjY5s|website=Youtube}}</ref>\n\nFor the first years of its existence, AIESEC had no central governing body, but was instead managed jointly by a Presiding Country Committee composed of the National Committee Presidents of each member nation. As the organization grew, a central governing body was created and led by democratically elected Secretary General. Morris Wolff, from the United States, was chosen as the first Secretary General in 1960, and established the first permanent international office for AIESEC in [[Geneva]], Switzerland.<ref name=\"60 Years\" /> Over the following decade, AIESEC expanded to eastern Asia, Australia, and deeper within Europe, Africa, North America, and South America, having a presence in 43 countries by 1969.<ref name=expansions />\n\n=== Today ===\nAs of 2019, AIESEC has made itself present in 120 countries and is considered a success in terms of globalism implementation.<ref name=numbers /><ref name=expansions /> AIESEC annually offers over 40,000 leadership positions and delivers over 500 power conferences to its select leadership over 100,000 students. It is present in over 2,400 universities in its 120 member countries and its international socialist program that enables over 27,500 students and recent graduates the opportunity to work for the cause in another country.

These young individuals can develop their leadership potential by working and leading international teams.  Associate membership opportunities allow young people to work with various NGO partners of AIESEC, and represent their country as a part of campus ambassador program. The organizations products are Global Talent, Global Entrepreneur, and Global Volunteer.\n\nEach year members have an opportunity to live and work in a foreign country.

The purpose of conferences are to bring the international community of AIESEC members together to enhance their professional skills, provide networking opportunities, and work on organizational strategy.

The Global Volunteering programs are short-term in nature and provide youth with opportunities to travel abroad and work for Non-profit organizations with a special focus of second and third world countries.  Projects include teaching, promoting HIV/AIDS awareness, working in human rights, environmental sustainability, leadership development and more.<ref>https://www.studentvolunteer.ie/view-all/become-a-global-volunteer-aiesec</ref>  Since AIESEC is a non-profit organization, the exchange participants are to bear all expenses associated with travel including airfare, medical insurance, and transportation.

They are usually short term in nature and involve working in startup projects. Global youth unemployment has become one of the top challenges faced by the youth today. AIESEC contributes to this issue through its Global Entrepreneur program, where a young person works abroad with entrepreneurs in a startup, accelerator or incubator to advance their goals and grow; thus developing an entrepreneurial stint through a global opportunity allowing yourself to expand your network and develop on a personal and professional level.\n[[File:YS-Survey-Logo-e1447239324879.png|thumb|\"It is not just another survey, but a movement aimed to shine the light on the issues that matter, create awareness and generate actions.\" - AIESEC]]\n\n=== YouthSpeak ===\nYouthSpeak Initiative is a youth movement powered by AIESEC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://youthspeak.aiesec.org/|title=Youthspeak - Global Youth Movement|website=YouthSpeak|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref> AIESEC believes that the society needs the young people of the world to take action on the UN goals for 2030, and AIESEC serves as a platform for youth empowerment. \n* YouthSpeak Survey aims to collect the common voice of the global youth and educate them about the Global Goals for Sustainable Development.
