The Buckeyes played their home games at [[Ohio Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. It was the Buckeyes' 128th overall, the 105th as a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]], and fourth as a member of the Eastern Division. They were led by [[Urban Meyer]], who was in his 6th season as head coach at the school.\n\nComing off a [[College Football Playoff]] appearance in [[2016 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|2016]], the Buckeyes began the year ranked second in the preseason [[AP Poll]] and were the overwhelming favorites to win the Big Ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/osu/2017/07/ohio_state_buckeyes_picked_to.html|title=Ohio State Buckeyes picked to win Big Ten in cleveland.com 2017 preseason poll|date=July 21, 2017|website=Cleveland.com|first=Doug|last=Lesmerises}}</ref> In the second game of the year, they suffered their first loss at the hands of No. 5 [[2017 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] in Columbus, whom Ohio State had beaten on the road the previous year. Ohio State won their following six games, including a 39\u201338 victory over No. 2 [[2017 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]], but lost in a blowout on the road to [[2017 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Iowa]] the following week. The Buckeyes won their remaining regular season games and earned a spot in the [[2017 Big Ten Championship Game]] by winning the East Division with an 8\u20131 conference record. \n\nOhio State would play then-undefeated No. 1 [[2017 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]] as a heavy underdog. However, the Buckeyes pulled off an upset in Indianapolis, causing the last-undefeated FBS team to incur a loss. There was huge controversy over the College Football Playoff committee as to who would get into the final four; Alabama, which didn't play in the SEC Championship, was given a spot over both the Buckeyes and Badgers, both of whom just missed out on a playoff spot. Ohio State instead received an invitation to the [[2017 Cotton Bowl Classic (December)|Cotton Bowl]]. They defeated [[2017 USC Trojans football team|USC]] in that bowl to end the season at 12\u20132 and ranked fifth in the final polls.\n\nOhio State was led on offense by quarterback [[J.T. Barrett]], who was named first-team All-Big Ten. Barrett was both a passing and a running threat, finishing with 3,053 yards and a Big Ten-leading 35 touchdowns through the air, and 798 yards and 12 touchdowns on the ground. His 47 total touchdowns were second in [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] behind [[Baker Mayfield]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/2017-leaders.html|title=2017 Leaders|website=Sports-Reference.com|access-date=February 1, 2019}}</ref> Freshman running back [[J.

The Hoosiers answered with an 87-yard drive that was capped with an 18-yard touchdown pass from Richard Lagow to tight end Ian Thomas to take a four-point lead. The teams continued to trade punts until the second quarter when the Buckeyes' Jordan Fuller intercepted an Indiana pass in the endzone. Ohio State mounted a 58-yard drive that ended came up short at Indiana two-yard line that resulted in another Nuernberger field goal to bring the score to 7\u20136. Each team would score on touchdown drives of more than 75 yards on the next two possessions to give the Hoosiers a 14\u201313 lead at halftime.\n\nThe third quarter started off looking like it would continue to be a back-and-forth game as the teams again traded touchdowns, but the Buckeye passing offense, led by [[J. T. Barrett]], threw touchdown passes to Parris Campbell for 74 yards and to Johnnie Dixon for 54 yard to give the Buckeyes a 35\u201321 lead. The Buckeye defense took over from there turning the Hoosiers over two times, each resulting in an Ohio State touchdown. The Buckeyes held on for the win, 49\u201321.\n\nTwo Buckeye records were set during the game: J.K.

The Buckeyes, on the other hand, began the game with two consecutive punts which resulted with the game scoreless at the end of the first. The first score came at 11:11 in the second with a 24-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal after the Buckeyes failed to convert inside of the redzone. Eight plays later, Oklahoma again failed to capitalize in Ohio State territory, this time missing a 37-yard field goal. Following a punt by the Buckeyes, Oklahoma was able to mount a 55-yard drive to kick a 35-yard field goal to tie the game 3\u20133 at the half.\n\nThe Buckeyes came out of the gates strong behind a 56-yard Parris Campbell kickoff return capped by 6-yard J.K.

But, 1:47 seconds later, [[Baker Mayfield]] and the Oklahoma Sooners stuck back on a 36-yard [[Dimitri Flowers]] touchdown reception to tie the game at 10. Ohio State would never find the endzone again and would settle for two more Nuernberger field goals.

This was the Buckeyes first-ever match-up against the Black Knights and the seventh match-up against a military academy. Ohio State is 5\u20131 all-time against the other two major military academies with the most recent win coming in [[2014 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|2014]] against [[2014 Navy Midshipmen football team|Navy]] and the only loss coming in [[1990 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|1990]] against [[1990 Air Force Falcons football team|Air Force]].  \nA week after seemingly nothing went right in a prime-time loss to [[2017 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], Ohio State couldn't have scripted a better start in its bounce-back attempt against Army. The Buckeyes purred on their first two drives, covering 75 and then 94 yards, to race to a 14\u20130 lead. Army limited the Buckeyes to one possession in the second quarter and outscored OSU to draw to 17\u20137. Army started the quarter with an 11-play drive that ended when Blake Wilson missed a 43-yard field-goal attempt. Finally getting the ball back in the second half, the Buckeyes wasted little time taking it to the end zone. [[J. K. Dobbins]] ripped off a 22-yard run on first down from the 26, then went 52 yards on a run around left end, a play in which the freshman juked Army cornerback Mike Reynolds almost into the ground. That made the score 24\u20137, and after Kendall Sheffield recovered a fumbled snap on Army's next drive, OSU went to the air to increase its lead. [[J.T. Barrett]] completed all three of his passes on the next drive, including a 31-yarder across the middle to tight end Marcus Baugh to move the ball to the 22. Two plays later, Barrett threw a fastball strike to Terry McLaurin, who headed downfield until he found an open spot in the end zone. With a 31\u20137 lead, the Buckeyes forced a three-and-out but couldn't put the game away and punted from inside Army territory late in the quarter. The Buckeyes were winning big on the scoreboard, and that continued to the end. J.T. Barrett's 9-yard touchdown pass to Austin Mack, which gave the senior quarterback the Big Ten record by accounting for his 107th career touchdown. Another three-and-out gave OSU the ball back with 4:36 remaining, and backup QB Dwayne Haskins Jr. guided the offense 72 yards before the time arrived for victory formation.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''<ref name=\"Statistics\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!Army\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|586\n|278\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|316\n|19\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|270\n|259\n|-\n|Penalties\n|5\u201355\n|2\u201322\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|23:03\n|36:57\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!Army\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.

Sean Nuernberger's 47-yard field goal was blocked, [[J. K. Dobbins]] fumbled and punter Drue Chrisman had a 22-yard punt giving Maryland great field position. Though the mistakes on special teams and offense added up, the defense kept the Maryland offense scoreless. In the final five minutes of the second half, Ohio State scored three consecutive touchdowns giving them a 41\u20137 halftime lead.\n\nMaryland began the second half with a \u221214 yard drive that was followed by an Ohio State drive that ended with a missed 29-yard field goal attempt. The Ohio State offense recovered and scored touchdowns on three of their next four drives. Maryland's only offensive score of the day came after a Dwayne Haskins fumble at the Ohio State 27, which allowed for a four play drive, capped by a 20-yard Javon Leake run, making the final 62\u201314.\n\nOhio State finished the day with 584 total yards and held the Terrapins to only 66.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''<ref name=\"Statistics\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MD\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|584\n|66\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|303\n|16\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|281\n|50\n|-\n|Penalties\n|8\u201385\n|6\u201366\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|2\n|2\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|32:24\n|27:36\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MD\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.T.

This is the third consecutive defeat of their cross-divisional foe, with the last and only loss coming in 2011. Additionally, the win marked the Buckeye's 500th [[Big Ten Conference]] victory and moved them into a tie with the Cornhuskers for the third-most [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] wins at 892.\n\nThe Buckeyes began the game on defense which forced a three-and-out. Following a 57-yard punt which pinned the Ohio State offense at their own 4-yard line, the Buckeye's drove 96 yards to score the game's first score that was capped by a 52-yard, [[J. K. Dobbins]], touchdown.  After another three-and-out by the Silver Bullet defense, the offense again scored on another drive that ended with a [[J. T. Barrett]] touchdown run, giving the Buckeyes a 14\u20130 lead at the end of the opening quarter. Ohio State scored less than 90 seconds into the second quarter, increasing their lead to 21. The Nebraska offense showed very little in the first half, gaining only five first downs on their six possessions, and the defense struggled even more by failing to stop the Buckeyes from reaching the endzone on all five of their possessions. This gave Ohio State a 35\u20130 halftime lead.\n\nOhio State once again lead a 75-yard drive to open the second half but were quickly matched by a 77-yard [[Tanner Lee]] touchdown pass to J.D. Spielman, making the score 42\u20137 Ohio State. The Cornhuskers would once again score on their following possession, on another Tanner Lee pass, but the score was again matched on a 15-play, 66-yard, Ohio State scoring drive. Nebraska would fail to score again while Ohio State would score once more, making the final score 56\u201314. Ohio State would score on eight of their nine drives and never having to punt.\n\n[[J. T. Barrett|Barrett]] scored five passing touchdowns and two rushing touchdowns, which tied his record for most touchdowns responsible for that he set in 2016. For his performance, he was named the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week for the eighth time in his career, the Davey O'Brien national quarterback of the week and the Earl Campbell Tyler Rose Award National Player of the Week.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elevenwarriors.com/ohio-state-football/2017/10/86685/jt-barrett-named-davey-obrien-award-national-quarterback-of-the-week|title=J.T.

The Buckeyes avenged last year's loss to Penn State that gave them their only regular season loss and allowed the Nittany Lions to earn a berth over the Buckeyes in the [[2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game]]. OSU Coach [[Urban Meyer]] is now 5\u20131 versus Penn State and PSU's [[James Franklin (American football coach)|James Franklin]] is 1\u20133 versus the Buckeyes. In all but three of the 32 match-ups, including 13 straight, at least one of the teams was ranked in the AP Top 25 poll. This game served as host to [[ESPN]]'s [[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]], and was Ohio State's third appearance this year and Penn State's second.\n\nSpecial teams woes began immediately for the Buckeyes when Penn State won the opening coin toss and elected to receive the ball on the opening kickoff which resulted in a 97-yard [[Saquon Barkley]] kickoff return for a touchdown. On Ohio State's following possession, after only three plays, wide receiver Parris Campbell fumbled the ball after he was once again injured. This gave the Nittany Lion possession on their 23-yard line which led to an eventual 13-yard touchdown pass from [[Trace McSorley]] to [[DaeSean Hamilton]].  The Buckeyes found themselves in a 14-point hole at the 11:34 mark of the first quarter. After trading punts, Ohio State finally got on the scoreboard following a 38-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal to make the score 3\u201314. The remainder of the first quarter remained fairly quiet.\n\nThe second quarter of the game began with an 81-yard Penn State drive that resulted in a 36-yard touchdown Barkley run to give Penn State an 18-point lead with a score of 3\u201321. [[J. T. Barrett]] and the Ohio State offense was able to match that score with their first touchdown of the game by driving 63 yards and scoring on a 14-yard pass from Barrett to Terry McLaurin. The Buckeyes once again faced a special teams disaster on the following kickoff which was returned for 59 yards by Koa Farmer to the Ohio State 23 yard line. Two plays later McSorley ran for a 6-yard touchdown to give the Nittany Lions a 28\u201310 lead. Fortunately for the Buckeyes, the offense was able to travel 75 yards and a 2-yard [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] touchdown with less than five minutes in the half to cut the PSU lead to 17\u201328. Punts were traded by both teams to end the half and Penn State went to the locker room with an impressive 11-point lead.\n\nThe Buckeyes were able to amount a 57-yard drive following the intermission that resulted in a 36-yard Nuernberger field goal to get the lead to eight, but it was quickly negated ten plays later when McSorley found the endzone again on a 37-yard touchdown pass to DeAndre Thompkins. The third quarter had no more scoring and the Nittany Lions were able to secure a 20\u201335 lead going into the fourth and final quarter.\n\nOn the opening drive of the fourth quarter, Barrett fumbled the ball in a botched hand off attempt to [[J. K. Dobbins]] which gave the ball to the Nittany Lions on Ohio State's 42 yard line. The Buckeye defense stepped up and forced a three-and-out which was followed by a blocked punt by Denzel Ward. Two plays later Ohio State found the endzone on a 38-yard pass from Barrett to Johnnie Dixon, which would bring the Buckeyes within eight. Unfortunately for the Buckeyes, Penn State was able to pull back ahead by 11 on a 5:23 drive that ended in a 24-yard Tyler Davis field goal. Following the Penn State score, the Buckeye offense came alive and resulted in two 55+ yard drives that ended in Barrett touchdown passes. One to Dixon and the go-ahead touchdown to Marcus Baugh. Penn State on the other hand faced two consecutive possessions of negative yards, sealing the one-point Ohio State victory.\n\nJ.T. Barrett gained a school record 423 total offensive yards during the game earning him his ninth Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week honors, while wide receiver K.J. Hill caught 12 passes, which is the fourth most in program history. The Buckeye defense was able to hold [[Heisman Trophy]] hopeful Barkley to a season low of only 44 yards rushing on 21 attempts, but his performance on special teams earned him honors for Big Ten Special Team Player of the Week.\n\nOhio State moved up to No. 3 in both the AP and Coaches Polls while Penn State fell to No. 7 in both. The Buckeyes took over the sole lead of the Big Ten East division following the victory and a [[2017 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] loss to [[2017 Northwestern Wildcats football team|Northwestern]].\n\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryStart|VisitorName=PSU|HomeName=OSU|state=collapsed}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=14:45\n| Team=Penn State\n| DrivePlays=\n| DriveLength=\n| DriveTime=\n| Type=KickTD\n| Runner=[[Saquon Barkley]]\n| yards=97\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Tyler Davis\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=7\n| Home=0\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=11:36\n| Team=Penn State\n| DrivePlays=5\n| DriveLength=23\n| DriveTime=1:56\n| Type=RecTD\n| Receiver=[[DaeSean Hamilton]]\n| QB=[[Trace McSorley]]\n| yards=13\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Tyler Davis\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=14\n| Home=0\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=4:38\n| Team=Ohio State\n| DrivePlays=9\n| DriveLength=37\n| DriveTime=2:58\n| Type=FG\n| yards=38\n| Kicker=Sean Nuernberger\n| Visitor=14\n| Home=3\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=2\n| Time=11:40\n| Team=Penn State\n| DrivePlays=7\n| DriveLength=81\n| DriveTime=3:20\n| Type=RushTD\n| Runner=Saquon Barkley\n| yards=36\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Tyler Davis\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=21\n| Home=3\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=2\n| Time=9:32\n| Team=Ohio State\n| DrivePlays=5\n| DriveLength=63\n| DriveTime=2:01\n| Type=RecTD\n| Receiver=Terry McLaurin\n| QB=[[J.

This was the Buckeyes' first trip to Iowa since 2010 and the first time playing the Hawkeyes since 2013.\n\nThe first play of the game began a tough day for the Buckeyes when quarterback [[J. T. Barrett]] threw his first of four interceptions that was returned for an Iowa touchdown by [[Amani Hooker]]. The Buckeye offense looked to rebound by scoring two touchdowns and a field goal on their next three possessions. The Hawkeyes matched them by also scoring touchdowns on all but one of their first half drives. This gave Iowa a 31\u201317 lead at the half. The second half proved to be no easier on the Buckeyes as they allowed three more Iowa touchdowns and a field goal, while the Buckeyes offense only managed three first downs and one touchdown.\n\nOhio State fell to No. 11 in both the AP and the Coaches' Polls while falling to 13th in the CFP Poll. Iowa found themselves ranked for the first time in 2017 as they debuted at No. 25 in the AP Poll and No. 20 in the CFP Poll. The loss put the Buckeyes in a two-way tie at the top of the Big Ten East with their next opponent, Michigan State.

With the victory, Ohio State became the sole possessors of first place in the Big Ten East.\n\nWhile Michigan State started on a nine-play drive that took more than five minutes off of the clock, the Buckeyes were able to force a punt, a large part due to Nick Bosa's 12-yard sack on third down. The Buckeye offense was able to form an 86-yard drive that resulted in 79 rushing yards, including a 47-yard touchdown run by [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]]. [[J. T.

The Buckeye's final score of the first half came on a Weber 82-yard run on their next to-last possession, while Michigan State was able to kick a field goal as time expired following a Barrett interception. The Buckeyes would lead 35\u20133 at halftime. Ohio State was able to find the endzone on the third play of the second half with a 48-yard pass from Barrett to Binjimin Victor, this would be the last touchdown of the game. Ohio State would kick two Sean Nuernberger field goals on their next two possessions to increase their lead to 45.\n\nBefore this game, the largest Dantonio-Meyer match-up spread had been a 12-point OSU victory. This result was the largest defeat in the series history.\n\nThe Buckeyes moved up three spots to No. 8 in both the AP and Coaches' polls and four spots to No. 9 in the CFP poll while Michigan State fell to No. 24 in the AP poll, No. 22 in the Coaches' poll and No. 17 in the CFP poll.

Ohio State was awarded the [[Illibuck Trophy]] for the ninth consecutive time, which has been given out since 1925, making it the second oldest trophy between Big Ten football programs. [[Urban Meyer]] is now 5\u20130 against the Illini, while this was Illinois coach [[Lovie Smith]]'s first game against the Buckeyes.\n\nThe Buckeye offense came out and struck quickly by scoring on their first drive by a 25-yard [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] touchdown run. Ohio State's defense, matched the effort by forcing what would be the first of many three-and-outs. The following drive also resulted in a touchdown following a 6 play, 71-yard drive, capped by [[J.T. Barrett]]'s ninth rushing touchdown of the season. Ohio State would go on to score two more touchdowns in the first quarter, one by a pass from Barrett to Binjimen Victor and the other by a 43-yard Weber run. Illinois would fail to convert a first down, giving the Buckeyes a 28\u20130 lead at the end of the first quarter.\n\nOhio State was able to add a 33-year Sean Nuernberger field goal at the beginning of the second period, followed soon after by another OSU drive that ended with a [[J. K. Dobbins]] touchdown run, which would be the last time the primary starters would see the game in the first half. Ohio State would fail to score on a drive for the first time during their last possession, while Illinois would gain their only first down of the opening half. Ohio State would go into halftime with a 38\u20130 lead as heavy rain began to fall.\n\nOhio State's defense mounted another three-and-out to start the second half, but the offense was apparently effected by the rain when back-up quarterback Dwayne Haskins fumbled the ball and it was returned 54-yards by Ahmari Hayes for Illinois' first score. Ohio State's offensive starters went back into the game but were forced to punt. Luckily for the Buckeyes, the punt was muffed and recovered by Ohio State that led to a Barrett touchdown pass to tight end Marcus Ball. Ohio State led 45\u20137 at this point and would be the last time the offensive starters saw the field. The teams traded punts to close out the third quarter.\n\nAfter a short performance by back-up quarterback, Joe Burrow, Haskins went back in the game which resulted in a 21-yard touchdown pass to Victor. The Illini would match the result with their only offensive touchdown on a 65-yard drive to make the score 52\u201314. Neither team would score again to make that the final.\n\nOhio State would only allow three first downs and it was the sixth game of the season that they allowed less than 100 rushing yards and the fifth game they allowed less than 100 passing yards.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/ncf/boxscore/_/id/400935394|title=Penn State vs. Ohio State \u2013 Box Score \u2013 October 28, 2017 \u2013 ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!ILL\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|543\n|105\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|218\n|16\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|325\n|89\n|-\n|Penalties\n|7\u201368\n|7\u201355\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|37:16\n|22:44\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!ILL\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.T.

The No. 9 Ohio State Buckeyes defeated the Michigan Wolverines by a score of 31\u201320.\n\nOhio State and Michigan both started off slowly by forcing three-and-outs on each team's opening drive before the Wolverines mounted a nearly six minute, 13-play, 77-yard drive that resulted in a touchdown. Ohio State was again forced with another three-and-out that was followed by a Michigan drive that ended in a punt that pinned the Buckeye's deep. Ohio State was forced to punt and was returned 42-yards by Michigan wide receiver [[Donovan Peoples-Jones]], additionally, Ohio State committed a block in the back which gave the Wolverines the ball at the five-yard line. Michigan was able to take a 14\u20130 lead when quarterback [[John O'Korn]] completed a three-yard pass to Sean McKeon. Ohio State was held to \u22126 yard in the first quarter and was the first time since 2010 that Ohio State had been held to negative yardage in a quarter. The Ohio State offense and the rushing attack of [[J. T. Barrett]] and [[J. K. Dobbins]] came alive on the following drive when the two gained 71 yards on the ground that ended with a 21-yard Barrett touchdown run. Following a Michigan punt, Ohio State was able to move the ball again behind Barrett when he ran for 26 yards and threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Marcus Baugh, tying the game at 14. Neither team would score again in the first half.\n\nOhio State again started off slow by being forced to consecutive three-and-outs, while Michigan was able to score on a 2-yard [[Karan Higdon]] touchdown run. Ohio State linebacker, Chris Worley, was able to block the PAT and Michigan led 20\u201314. The Buckeyes answered back when Ohio State mounted a 78-yard touchdown drive capped by a 1-yard Dobbins touchdown run. Unfortunately for the Buckeyes, Barrett was injured during the drive and was forced out for the remainder of the game. RS Freshman, Dwayne Haskins gained 24 yards on the ground and 31 in the air on the drive that gave the Buckeyes a one-point, 21\u201320 lead. The Wolverines were unable to capitalize on the following possession and Ohio State was able to tack on a 44-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal, increasing the lead to four.  Michigan drove the ball 36-yards on their next possession, but turned the ball over on downs following an O'Korn sack and two additional incomplete passes. The Buckeyes drove again and Nuernberger missed only his third field goal of the season on a 43-yard attempt. The following play, O'Korn committed the only turnover of the game when he threw an interception to Jordan Fuller. On Ohio State's next possession, Dobbins ran for 41 yards and [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] was able to seal the game by scoring a 25-yard touchdown run with 1:44 remaining in the game, to make what would be the final score, 31\u201320.\n\nMichigan coach [[Jim Harbaugh]] dropped to 0\u20133 versus the Buckeyes, while [[Urban Meyer]] moved to 6\u20130 against the Wolverines. The current winning streak is tied for the second-longest in the series and tied for the longest for Ohio State with the 2004\u20132009 games. J.T. Barrett became the only quarterback in the series history to have four wins versus the other and moved Ohio State into first place in the number of all-time Big Ten wins. Ohio State clinched their first outright divisional title since 2014 and faced Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game. Ohio State's ranking would remain unchanged in the AP Poll at No. 8 and they would move up one spot to No. 7 in the Coaches Poll.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MICH\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|350\n|295\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|124\n|195\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|226\n|100\n|-\n|Penalties\n|9\u201375\n|6\u201350\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|31:17\n|28:43\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MICH\n|-\n|Passing\n|Dwayne Haskins (94)\n|[[John O'Korn]] (195)\n|-\n|Rushing\n|[[J.

Urban Meyer is now 5\u20130 versus the Badgers, with two of the victories coming in overtime. [[Paul Chryst]] fell to 0\u20132 versus the Buckeyes. This was Ohio State's third appearance in the Championship game and Wisconsin's fifth, including their second straight.\n\nThe Badgers began the game with the ball and were forced to punt after a three-and-out with the reverse result happening on the Buckeyes' first possession as well. Wisconsin would then follow with a 55-yard drive that ended with an interception in Wisconsin's redzone thrown by [[Alex Hornibrook]] to Denzel Ward at OSU's 4-yard line. [[J. T. Barrett]] would rush for a total of 12 yards before hitting Terry McLaurin for an 84-yard touchdown pass giving the Buckeyes an early 7\u20130 lead. The pass from Barrett to McLaurin was the longest play committed against the Badgers' defense all season. The following Wisconsin drive lasted for 7 plays and 44 yards and a punt trapped the Buckeyes on their own two-yard line. Barrett would go on to throw an interception to Wisconsin linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel that was returned for a touchdown, tying the game at 7\u20137. Ohio State would bounce back quickly and score on a Barrett to Parris Campbell, 57-yard touchdown pass, once again regaining the lead 14\u20137 and bringing an end to the first quarter.\n\nOhio State wand Wisconsin traded punts to open the second quarter, but the Buckeyes would strike again with a Barrett 1-yard touchdown run that was set up by a 77-yard rush by [[J. K. Dobbins]].  On Ohio State's second possession of the second quarter, [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] would commit his first fumble of the year that was recovered by Van Ginkel that would lead to a 28-yard field goal, making the score 21\u201310 in favor of the Buckeyes. Ohio State would attempt to add to their lead, but Sean Nuernberger's 43-yard field goal was blocked as time expired.\n\nWhile Ohio State couldn't amount a drive to open the second half, Wisconsin was able to convert a 46-yard field goal to narrow the lead to 8, which was quickly matched by the Buckeyes thanks to a 53-yard Dobbins run and a 27-yard Nuernberger field goal. Punts were traded after several three-and-outs both teams until Wisconsin began an 11-play, 52-yard drive that started with a Barrett interception that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Chris James and a successful 2-point conversion. The score narrowed to 24\u201321 favoring Ohio State. The Buckeyes followed with a 15-play drive that took 5:20 off the clock and tacked on a 20-yard Ohio State field goal to increase the lead back to 6. The Buckeyes and the Badgers again traded punts and with 1:50 left in the game, Wisconsin would begin their final offensive drive. Wisconsin would secure two first downs bringing them to mid-field. A holding penalty on Wisconsin on first down would force a first and 20. Hornibrook would throw three incomplete passes until he threw an interception to Damon Webb. Ohio State was able to run out the clock and secure their 36th Big Ten Title.\n\n[[J. K. Dobbins]] would be named the MVP of the game which was the first time a Freshman earned the award. He would also become the all-time leading Freshman rusher in Ohio State history, passing [[Maurice Clarett]]. Ohio State would go on to be ranked No. 5 in the final CFP poll and miss the playoffs while Wisconsin would fall to No. 6.

This was the first time that the Buckeyes defeated the Trojans since 1974, which broke a seven-game USC win-streak.\n\nOhio State and their Silver Bullet defense proved to be a tough match for USC. On the third play of the game, Ohio State's Kendall Sheffield was able to strip the ball from USC wide receiver [[Deontay Burnett]] which was recovered and advanced 20 yards by Ohio State's Damon Webb. This set up a short five-play drive that resulted in a [[J. T. Barrett]] 1-yard touchdown run. Punts were traded a few times by both teams until the Buckeyes produced an 83-yard drive that tacked on a 26-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal at the beginning of the second quarter to five OSU a 10\u20130 lead. The following play, [[Sam Darnold]] threw an interception to Ohio State's Damon Webb which was returned for a 23-yard touchdown giving the Buckeyes a 17\u20130 lead. Again, both teams traded punts and USC fumbled the ball which set up a 59-yard Buckeye drive that ended with a 28-yard Barrett touchdown run giving the Buckeyes a 24-point lead. USC was able to find the scoreboard in the second quarter when K.J. Hill fumbled a punt return which set up a 15-yard drive, capped by a one-yard [[Ronald Jones II]] touchdown run.  The score at half would be 24\u20137 favoring Ohio State.\n\nOffensively, the Buckeyes remained quiet the second half by having all but one drive ending in a punt. USC was able to  drive deep into Buckeye territory three times, but a missed field goal, a fumble and a failed fourth-down conversion didn't allow the Trojans to score any points. The final score would end as 24\u20137.\n\nBarrett and Webb were named the Offensive and Defensive MVPs respectively. Barrett also passed [[Drew Brees]] for the Big Ten record of most offensive yards in a career.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!USC\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|277\n|413\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|114\n|356\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|163\n|57\n|-\n|Penalties\n|3\u201330\n|3\u201335\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|1\n|4\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|25:04\n|34:56\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!USC\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.

The Buckeyes played their home games at [[Ohio Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. It was the Buckeyes' 128th overall, the 105th as a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]], and fourth as a member of the Eastern Division. They were led by [[Urban Meyer]], who was in his 6th season as head coach at the school.\n\nComing off a [[College Football Playoff]] appearance in [[2016 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|2016]], the Buckeyes began the year ranked second in the preseason [[AP Poll]] and were the overwhelming favorites to win the Big Ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/osu/2017/07/ohio_state_buckeyes_picked_to.html|title=Ohio State Buckeyes picked to win Big Ten in cleveland.com 2017 preseason poll|date=July 21, 2017|website=Cleveland.com|first=Doug|last=Lesmerises}}</ref> In the second game of the year, they suffered their first loss at the hands of No. 5 [[2017 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] in Columbus, whom Ohio State had beaten on the road the previous year. Ohio State won their following six games, including a 39\u201338 victory over No. 2 [[2017 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]], but lost in a blowout on the road to [[2017 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Iowa]] the following week. The Buckeyes won their remaining regular season games and earned a spot in the [[2017 Big Ten Championship Game]] by winning the East Division with an 8\u20131 conference record. \n\nOhio State would play then-undefeated No. 1 [[2017 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]] as a heavy underdog. However, the Buckeyes pulled off an upset in Indianapolis, causing the last-undefeated FBS team to incur a loss. There was huge controversy over the College Football Playoff committee as to who would get into the final four; Alabama, which didn't play in the SEC Championship, was given a spot over both the Buckeyes and Badgers, both of whom just missed out on a playoff spot. Ohio State instead received an invitation to the [[2017 Cotton Bowl Classic (December)|Cotton Bowl]]. They defeated [[2017 USC Trojans football team|USC]] in that bowl to end the season at 12\u20132 and ranked fifth in the final polls.\n\nOhio State was led on offense by quarterback [[J.T. Barrett]], who was named first-team All-Big Ten. Barrett was both a passing and a running threat, finishing with 3,053 yards and a Big Ten-leading 35 touchdowns through the air, and 798 yards and 12 touchdowns on the ground. His 47 total touchdowns were second in [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] behind [[Baker Mayfield]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/2017-leaders.html|title=2017 Leaders|website=Sports-Reference.com|access-date=February 1, 2019}}</ref> Freshman running back [[J.

This marked the first time that the Buckeyes opened a season on the road since their 42\u201324 victory over [[2015 Virginia Tech Hokies football team|Virginia Tech]] in [[2015 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|2015]] and their first time opening with a [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] opponent since [[1976 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|1976]] when they defeated [[1976 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] 49\u201321.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ohiostate.247sports.com/ContentGallery/Ohio-State-Buckeyes-football-will-open-on-road-in-Big-Ten-for-th-106464208|title=Ohio State Buckeyes football will open on road in Big Ten for third time ever|work=Bucknuts|access-date=31 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nOhio State began the game well, driving the ball 66 yards on 11 plays, but were stalled in the redzone, settling for a Sean Nuernberger field goal to take an early 3\u20130 lead. The Hoosiers answered with an 87-yard drive that was capped with an 18-yard touchdown pass from Richard Lagow to tight end Ian Thomas to take a four-point lead. The teams continued to trade punts until the second quarter when the Buckeyes' Jordan Fuller intercepted an Indiana pass in the endzone. Ohio State mounted a 58-yard drive that ended came up short at Indiana two-yard line that resulted in another Nuernberger field goal to bring the score to 7\u20136. Each team would score on touchdown drives of more than 75 yards on the next two possessions to give the Hoosiers a 14\u201313 lead at halftime.\n\nThe third quarter started off looking like it would continue to be a back-and-forth game as the teams again traded touchdowns, but the Buckeye passing offense, led by [[J. T. Barrett]], threw touchdown passes to Parris Campbell for 74 yards and to Johnnie Dixon for 54 yard to give the Buckeyes a 35\u201321 lead. The Buckeye defense took over from there turning the Hoosiers over two times, each resulting in an Ohio State touchdown.

The Buckeyes, on the other hand, began the game with two consecutive punts which resulted with the game scoreless at the end of the first. The first score came at 11:11 in the second with a 24-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal after the Buckeyes failed to convert inside of the redzone. Eight plays later, Oklahoma again failed to capitalize in Ohio State territory, this time missing a 37-yard field goal. Following a punt by the Buckeyes, Oklahoma was able to mount a 55-yard drive to kick a 35-yard field goal to tie the game 3\u20133 at the half.\n\nThe Buckeyes came out of the gates strong behind a 56-yard Parris Campbell kickoff return capped by 6-yard J.K.

But, 1:47 seconds later, [[Baker Mayfield]] and the Oklahoma Sooners stuck back on a 36-yard [[Dimitri Flowers]] touchdown reception to tie the game at 10.

This was the Buckeyes first-ever match-up against the Black Knights and the seventh match-up against a military academy. Ohio State is 5\u20131 all-time against the other two major military academies with the most recent win coming in [[2014 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|2014]] against [[2014 Navy Midshipmen football team|Navy]] and the only loss coming in [[1990 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|1990]] against [[1990 Air Force Falcons football team|Air Force]].  \nA week after seemingly nothing went right in a prime-time loss to [[2017 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], Ohio State couldn't have scripted a better start in its bounce-back attempt against Army. The Buckeyes purred on their first two drives, covering 75 and then 94 yards, to race to a 14\u20130 lead. Army limited the Buckeyes to one possession in the second quarter and outscored OSU to draw to 17\u20137. Army started the quarter with an 11-play drive that ended when Blake Wilson missed a 43-yard field-goal attempt. Finally getting the ball back in the second half, the Buckeyes wasted little time taking it to the end zone. [[J. K. Dobbins]] ripped off a 22-yard run on first down from the 26, then went 52 yards on a run around left end, a play in which the freshman juked Army cornerback Mike Reynolds almost into the ground. That made the score 24\u20137, and after Kendall Sheffield recovered a fumbled snap on Army's next drive, OSU went to the air to increase its lead. [[J.T. Barrett]] completed all three of his passes on the next drive, including a 31-yarder across the middle to tight end Marcus Baugh to move the ball to the 22. Two plays later, Barrett threw a fastball strike to Terry McLaurin, who headed downfield until he found an open spot in the end zone. With a 31\u20137 lead, the Buckeyes forced a three-and-out but couldn't put the game away and punted from inside Army territory late in the quarter. The Buckeyes were winning big on the scoreboard, and that continued to the end. J.T. Barrett's 9-yard touchdown pass to Austin Mack, which gave the senior quarterback the Big Ten record by accounting for his 107th career touchdown. Another three-and-out gave OSU the ball back with 4:36 remaining, and backup QB Dwayne Haskins Jr. guided the offense 72 yards before the time arrived for victory formation.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''<ref name=\"Statistics\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!Army\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|586\n|278\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|316\n|19\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|270\n|259\n|-\n|Penalties\n|5\u201355\n|2\u201322\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|23:03\n|36:57\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!Army\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.

On the Terrapins first drive, Quarterback Max Bortenschlager, was hit from behind by DE Nick Bosa and fumbled the ball which was returned by LB Jerome Baker for a 20-yard touchdown to give the Buckeyes an early 14\u20130 lead. The Buckeyes' special teams woes began on the ensuing kickoff which was returned for a 100-yard touchdown by Ty Johnson to cut the Ohio State lead to 7.

The Buckeyes avenged last year's loss to Penn State that gave them their only regular season loss and allowed the Nittany Lions to earn a berth over the Buckeyes in the [[2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game]]. OSU Coach [[Urban Meyer]] is now 5\u20131 versus Penn State and PSU's [[James Franklin (American football coach)|James Franklin]] is 1\u20133 versus the Buckeyes. In all but three of the 32 match-ups, including 13 straight, at least one of the teams was ranked in the AP Top 25 poll. This game served as host to [[ESPN]]'s [[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]], and was Ohio State's third appearance this year and Penn State's second.\n\nSpecial teams woes began immediately for the Buckeyes when Penn State won the opening coin toss and elected to receive the ball on the opening kickoff which resulted in a 97-yard [[Saquon Barkley]] kickoff return for a touchdown. On Ohio State's following possession, after only three plays, wide receiver Parris Campbell fumbled the ball after he was once again injured. This gave the Nittany Lion possession on their 23-yard line which led to an eventual 13-yard touchdown pass from [[Trace McSorley]] to [[DaeSean Hamilton]].  The Buckeyes found themselves in a 14-point hole at the 11:34 mark of the first quarter. After trading punts, Ohio State finally got on the scoreboard following a 38-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal to make the score 3\u201314. The remainder of the first quarter remained fairly quiet.\n\nThe second quarter of the game began with an 81-yard Penn State drive that resulted in a 36-yard touchdown Barkley run to give Penn State an 18-point lead with a score of 3\u201321. [[J. T. Barrett]] and the Ohio State offense was able to match that score with their first touchdown of the game by driving 63 yards and scoring on a 14-yard pass from Barrett to Terry McLaurin. The Buckeyes once again faced a special teams disaster on the following kickoff which was returned for 59 yards by Koa Farmer to the Ohio State 23 yard line. Two plays later McSorley ran for a 6-yard touchdown to give the Nittany Lions a 28\u201310 lead. Fortunately for the Buckeyes, the offense was able to travel 75 yards and a 2-yard [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] touchdown with less than five minutes in the half to cut the PSU lead to 17\u201328. Punts were traded by both teams to end the half and Penn State went to the locker room with an impressive 11-point lead.\n\nThe Buckeyes were able to amount a 57-yard drive following the intermission that resulted in a 36-yard Nuernberger field goal to get the lead to eight, but it was quickly negated ten plays later when McSorley found the endzone again on a 37-yard touchdown pass to DeAndre Thompkins. The third quarter had no more scoring and the Nittany Lions were able to secure a 20\u201335 lead going into the fourth and final quarter.\n\nOn the opening drive of the fourth quarter, Barrett fumbled the ball in a botched hand off attempt to [[J. K. Dobbins]] which gave the ball to the Nittany Lions on Ohio State's 42 yard line. The Buckeye defense stepped up and forced a three-and-out which was followed by a blocked punt by Denzel Ward. Two plays later Ohio State found the endzone on a 38-yard pass from Barrett to Johnnie Dixon, which would bring the Buckeyes within eight. Unfortunately for the Buckeyes, Penn State was able to pull back ahead by 11 on a 5:23 drive that ended in a 24-yard Tyler Davis field goal. Following the Penn State score, the Buckeye offense came alive and resulted in two 55+ yard drives that ended in Barrett touchdown passes. One to Dixon and the go-ahead touchdown to Marcus Baugh. Penn State on the other hand faced two consecutive possessions of negative yards, sealing the one-point Ohio State victory.\n\nJ.T. Barrett gained a school record 423 total offensive yards during the game earning him his ninth Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week honors, while wide receiver K.J. Hill caught 12 passes, which is the fourth most in program history. The Buckeye defense was able to hold [[Heisman Trophy]] hopeful Barkley to a season low of only 44 yards rushing on 21 attempts, but his performance on special teams earned him honors for Big Ten Special Team Player of the Week.\n\nOhio State moved up to No. 3 in both the AP and Coaches Polls while Penn State fell to No. 7 in both. The Buckeyes took over the sole lead of the Big Ten East division following the victory and a [[2017 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] loss to [[2017 Northwestern Wildcats football team|Northwestern]].\n\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryStart|VisitorName=PSU|HomeName=OSU|state=collapsed}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=14:45\n| Team=Penn State\n| DrivePlays=\n| DriveLength=\n| DriveTime=\n| Type=KickTD\n| Runner=[[Saquon Barkley]]\n| yards=97\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Tyler Davis\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=7\n| Home=0\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=11:36\n| Team=Penn State\n| DrivePlays=5\n| DriveLength=23\n| DriveTime=1:56\n| Type=RecTD\n| Receiver=[[DaeSean Hamilton]]\n| QB=[[Trace McSorley]]\n| yards=13\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Tyler Davis\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=14\n| Home=0\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=4:38\n| Team=Ohio State\n| DrivePlays=9\n| DriveLength=37\n| DriveTime=2:58\n| Type=FG\n| yards=38\n| Kicker=Sean Nuernberger\n| Visitor=14\n| Home=3\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=2\n| Time=11:40\n| Team=Penn State\n| DrivePlays=7\n| DriveLength=81\n| DriveTime=3:20\n| Type=RushTD\n| Runner=Saquon Barkley\n| yards=36\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Tyler Davis\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=21\n| Home=3\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=2\n| Time=9:32\n| Team=Ohio State\n| DrivePlays=5\n| DriveLength=63\n| DriveTime=2:01\n| Type=RecTD\n| Receiver=Terry McLaurin\n| QB=[[J.

This was the Buckeyes' first trip to Iowa since 2010 and the first time playing the Hawkeyes since 2013.\n\nThe first play of the game began a tough day for the Buckeyes when quarterback [[J. T. Barrett]] threw his first of four interceptions that was returned for an Iowa touchdown by [[Amani Hooker]]. The Buckeye offense looked to rebound by scoring two touchdowns and a field goal on their next three possessions. The Hawkeyes matched them by also scoring touchdowns on all but one of their first half drives. This gave Iowa a 31\u201317 lead at the half. The second half proved to be no easier on the Buckeyes as they allowed three more Iowa touchdowns and a field goal, while the Buckeyes offense only managed three first downs and one touchdown.\n\nOhio State fell to No. 11 in both the AP and the Coaches' Polls while falling to 13th in the CFP Poll. Iowa found themselves ranked for the first time in 2017 as they debuted at No. 25 in the AP Poll and No. 20 in the CFP Poll. The loss put the Buckeyes in a two-way tie at the top of the Big Ten East with their next opponent, Michigan State. Iowa quarterback, [[Nate Stanley]], was named the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/ncf/boxscore/_/id/400935394|title=Penn State vs. Ohio State \u2013 Box Score \u2013 October 28, 2017 \u2013 ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!Iowa\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|371\n|487\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|208\n|244\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|163\n|243\n|-\n|Penalties\n|9\u201395\n|5\u201334\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|4\n|0\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|25:09\n|34:51\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!Iowa\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.T.

OSU coach [[Urban Meyer]] moved to 4\u20132 versus the Spartans, while MSU coach [[Mark Dantonio]] fell to 3\u20136 against the Buckeyes. With the victory, Ohio State became the sole possessors of first place in the Big Ten East.\n\nWhile Michigan State started on a nine-play drive that took more than five minutes off of the clock, the Buckeyes were able to force a punt, a large part due to Nick Bosa's 12-yard sack on third down. The Buckeye offense was able to form an 86-yard drive that resulted in 79 rushing yards, including a 47-yard touchdown run by [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]]. [[J. T.

The Buckeye's final score of the first half came on a Weber 82-yard run on their next to-last possession, while Michigan State was able to kick a field goal as time expired following a Barrett interception. The Buckeyes would lead 35\u20133 at halftime. Ohio State was able to find the endzone on the third play of the second half with a 48-yard pass from Barrett to Binjimin Victor, this would be the last touchdown of the game. Ohio State would kick two Sean Nuernberger field goals on their next two possessions to increase their lead to 45.\n\nBefore this game, the largest Dantonio-Meyer match-up spread had been a 12-point OSU victory. This result was the largest defeat in the series history.\n\nThe Buckeyes moved up three spots to No. 8 in both the AP and Coaches' polls and four spots to No. 9 in the CFP poll while Michigan State fell to No. 24 in the AP poll, No. 22 in the Coaches' poll and No. 17 in the CFP poll.

Ohio State was awarded the [[Illibuck Trophy]] for the ninth consecutive time, which has been given out since 1925, making it the second oldest trophy between Big Ten football programs. [[Urban Meyer]] is now 5\u20130 against the Illini, while this was Illinois coach [[Lovie Smith]]'s first game against the Buckeyes.\n\nThe Buckeye offense came out and struck quickly by scoring on their first drive by a 25-yard [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] touchdown run. Ohio State's defense, matched the effort by forcing what would be the first of many three-and-outs. The following drive also resulted in a touchdown following a 6 play, 71-yard drive, capped by [[J.T. Barrett]]'s ninth rushing touchdown of the season. Ohio State would go on to score two more touchdowns in the first quarter, one by a pass from Barrett to Binjimen Victor and the other by a 43-yard Weber run. Illinois would fail to convert a first down, giving the Buckeyes a 28\u20130 lead at the end of the first quarter.\n\nOhio State was able to add a 33-year Sean Nuernberger field goal at the beginning of the second period, followed soon after by another OSU drive that ended with a [[J. K. Dobbins]] touchdown run, which would be the last time the primary starters would see the game in the first half. Ohio State would fail to score on a drive for the first time during their last possession, while Illinois would gain their only first down of the opening half. Ohio State would go into halftime with a 38\u20130 lead as heavy rain began to fall.\n\nOhio State's defense mounted another three-and-out to start the second half, but the offense was apparently effected by the rain when back-up quarterback Dwayne Haskins fumbled the ball and it was returned 54-yards by Ahmari Hayes for Illinois' first score. Ohio State's offensive starters went back into the game but were forced to punt. Luckily for the Buckeyes, the punt was muffed and recovered by Ohio State that led to a Barrett touchdown pass to tight end Marcus Ball. Ohio State led 45\u20137 at this point and would be the last time the offensive starters saw the field. The teams traded punts to close out the third quarter.\n\nAfter a short performance by back-up quarterback, Joe Burrow, Haskins went back in the game which resulted in a 21-yard touchdown pass to Victor. The Illini would match the result with their only offensive touchdown on a 65-yard drive to make the score 52\u201314. Neither team would score again to make that the final.\n\nOhio State would only allow three first downs and it was the sixth game of the season that they allowed less than 100 rushing yards and the fifth game they allowed less than 100 passing yards.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/ncf/boxscore/_/id/400935394|title=Penn State vs. Ohio State \u2013 Box Score \u2013 October 28, 2017 \u2013 ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!ILL\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|543\n|105\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|218\n|16\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|325\n|89\n|-\n|Penalties\n|7\u201368\n|7\u201355\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|37:16\n|22:44\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!ILL\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.T.

The No. 9 Ohio State Buckeyes defeated the Michigan Wolverines by a score of 31\u201320.\n\nOhio State and Michigan both started off slowly by forcing three-and-outs on each team's opening drive before the Wolverines mounted a nearly six minute, 13-play, 77-yard drive that resulted in a touchdown. Ohio State was again forced with another three-and-out that was followed by a Michigan drive that ended in a punt that pinned the Buckeye's deep. Ohio State was forced to punt and was returned 42-yards by Michigan wide receiver [[Donovan Peoples-Jones]], additionally, Ohio State committed a block in the back which gave the Wolverines the ball at the five-yard line. Michigan was able to take a 14\u20130 lead when quarterback [[John O'Korn]] completed a three-yard pass to Sean McKeon. Ohio State was held to \u22126 yard in the first quarter and was the first time since 2010 that Ohio State had been held to negative yardage in a quarter. The Ohio State offense and the rushing attack of [[J. T. Barrett]] and [[J. K. Dobbins]] came alive on the following drive when the two gained 71 yards on the ground that ended with a 21-yard Barrett touchdown run. Following a Michigan punt, Ohio State was able to move the ball again behind Barrett when he ran for 26 yards and threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Marcus Baugh, tying the game at 14. Neither team would score again in the first half.\n\nOhio State again started off slow by being forced to consecutive three-and-outs, while Michigan was able to score on a 2-yard [[Karan Higdon]] touchdown run. Ohio State linebacker, Chris Worley, was able to block the PAT and Michigan led 20\u201314. The Buckeyes answered back when Ohio State mounted a 78-yard touchdown drive capped by a 1-yard Dobbins touchdown run. Unfortunately for the Buckeyes, Barrett was injured during the drive and was forced out for the remainder of the game. RS Freshman, Dwayne Haskins gained 24 yards on the ground and 31 in the air on the drive that gave the Buckeyes a one-point, 21\u201320 lead. The Wolverines were unable to capitalize on the following possession and Ohio State was able to tack on a 44-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal, increasing the lead to four.  Michigan drove the ball 36-yards on their next possession, but turned the ball over on downs following an O'Korn sack and two additional incomplete passes. The Buckeyes drove again and Nuernberger missed only his third field goal of the season on a 43-yard attempt. The following play, O'Korn committed the only turnover of the game when he threw an interception to Jordan Fuller. On Ohio State's next possession, Dobbins ran for 41 yards and [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] was able to seal the game by scoring a 25-yard touchdown run with 1:44 remaining in the game, to make what would be the final score, 31\u201320.\n\nMichigan coach [[Jim Harbaugh]] dropped to 0\u20133 versus the Buckeyes, while [[Urban Meyer]] moved to 6\u20130 against the Wolverines. The current winning streak is tied for the second-longest in the series and tied for the longest for Ohio State with the 2004\u20132009 games. J.T. Barrett became the only quarterback in the series history to have four wins versus the other and moved Ohio State into first place in the number of all-time Big Ten wins. Ohio State clinched their first outright divisional title since 2014 and faced Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game. Ohio State's ranking would remain unchanged in the AP Poll at No. 8 and they would move up one spot to No. 7 in the Coaches Poll.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MICH\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|350\n|295\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|124\n|195\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|226\n|100\n|-\n|Penalties\n|9\u201375\n|6\u201350\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|31:17\n|28:43\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MICH\n|-\n|Passing\n|Dwayne Haskins (94)\n|[[John O'Korn]] (195)\n|-\n|Rushing\n|[[J.

Urban Meyer is now 5\u20130 versus the Badgers, with two of the victories coming in overtime. [[Paul Chryst]] fell to 0\u20132 versus the Buckeyes. This was Ohio State's third appearance in the Championship game and Wisconsin's fifth, including their second straight.\n\nThe Badgers began the game with the ball and were forced to punt after a three-and-out with the reverse result happening on the Buckeyes' first possession as well. Wisconsin would then follow with a 55-yard drive that ended with an interception in Wisconsin's redzone thrown by [[Alex Hornibrook]] to Denzel Ward at OSU's 4-yard line. [[J. T. Barrett]] would rush for a total of 12 yards before hitting Terry McLaurin for an 84-yard touchdown pass giving the Buckeyes an early 7\u20130 lead. The pass from Barrett to McLaurin was the longest play committed against the Badgers' defense all season. The following Wisconsin drive lasted for 7 plays and 44 yards and a punt trapped the Buckeyes on their own two-yard line. Barrett would go on to throw an interception to Wisconsin linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel that was returned for a touchdown, tying the game at 7\u20137. Ohio State would bounce back quickly and score on a Barrett to Parris Campbell, 57-yard touchdown pass, once again regaining the lead 14\u20137 and bringing an end to the first quarter.\n\nOhio State wand Wisconsin traded punts to open the second quarter, but the Buckeyes would strike again with a Barrett 1-yard touchdown run that was set up by a 77-yard rush by [[J. K. Dobbins]].  On Ohio State's second possession of the second quarter, [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] would commit his first fumble of the year that was recovered by Van Ginkel that would lead to a 28-yard field goal, making the score 21\u201310 in favor of the Buckeyes. Ohio State would attempt to add to their lead, but Sean Nuernberger's 43-yard field goal was blocked as time expired.\n\nWhile Ohio State couldn't amount a drive to open the second half, Wisconsin was able to convert a 46-yard field goal to narrow the lead to 8, which was quickly matched by the Buckeyes thanks to a 53-yard Dobbins run and a 27-yard Nuernberger field goal. Punts were traded after several three-and-outs both teams until Wisconsin began an 11-play, 52-yard drive that started with a Barrett interception that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Chris James and a successful 2-point conversion. The score narrowed to 24\u201321 favoring Ohio State. The Buckeyes followed with a 15-play drive that took 5:20 off the clock and tacked on a 20-yard Ohio State field goal to increase the lead back to 6. The Buckeyes and the Badgers again traded punts and with 1:50 left in the game, Wisconsin would begin their final offensive drive. Wisconsin would secure two first downs bringing them to mid-field. A holding penalty on Wisconsin on first down would force a first and 20. Hornibrook would throw three incomplete passes until he threw an interception to Damon Webb. Ohio State was able to run out the clock and secure their 36th Big Ten Title.\n\n[[J. K. Dobbins]] would be named the MVP of the game which was the first time a Freshman earned the award. He would also become the all-time leading Freshman rusher in Ohio State history, passing [[Maurice Clarett]]. Ohio State would go on to be ranked No. 5 in the final CFP poll and miss the playoffs while Wisconsin would fall to No. 6. It was announced on December 3, that No. 5 Ohio State would face No. 8 USC in the [[2017 Cotton Bowl Classic (December)|Cotton Bowl Classic]].\n\n'''Game Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!WISC\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|449\n|298\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|211\n|238\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|238\n|60\n|-\n|Penalties\n|5\u201348\n|6\u201355\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|3\n|2\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|25:65\n|34:06\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!WISC\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.

This was the first time that the Buckeyes defeated the Trojans since 1974, which broke a seven-game USC win-streak.\n\nOhio State and their Silver Bullet defense proved to be a tough match for USC. On the third play of the game, Ohio State's Kendall Sheffield was able to strip the ball from USC wide receiver [[Deontay Burnett]] which was recovered and advanced 20 yards by Ohio State's Damon Webb. This set up a short five-play drive that resulted in a [[J. T. Barrett]] 1-yard touchdown run. Punts were traded a few times by both teams until the Buckeyes produced an 83-yard drive that tacked on a 26-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal at the beginning of the second quarter to five OSU a 10\u20130 lead. The following play, [[Sam Darnold]] threw an interception to Ohio State's Damon Webb which was returned for a 23-yard touchdown giving the Buckeyes a 17\u20130 lead. Again, both teams traded punts and USC fumbled the ball which set up a 59-yard Buckeye drive that ended with a 28-yard Barrett touchdown run giving the Buckeyes a 24-point lead. USC was able to find the scoreboard in the second quarter when K.J. Hill fumbled a punt return which set up a 15-yard drive, capped by a one-yard [[Ronald Jones II]] touchdown run.  The score at half would be 24\u20137 favoring Ohio State.\n\nOffensively, the Buckeyes remained quiet the second half by having all but one drive ending in a punt. USC was able to  drive deep into Buckeye territory three times, but a missed field goal, a fumble and a failed fourth-down conversion didn't allow the Trojans to score any points. The final score would end as 24\u20137.\n\nBarrett and Webb were named the Offensive and Defensive MVPs respectively. Barrett also passed [[Drew Brees]] for the Big Ten record of most offensive yards in a career.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!USC\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|277\n|413\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|114\n|356\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|163\n|57\n|-\n|Penalties\n|3\u201330\n|3\u201335\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|1\n|4\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|25:04\n|34:56\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!USC\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.

(1880s)|Ilkeston Town]], Foulke made his debut for Sheffield United against [[West Bromwich Albion]] on 1 September 1894 and led the team to three [[FA Cup]] finals (winning two) and a [[Football League First Division|League Championship]].\n\nAccording to ''The Cat's Pyjamas: The Penguin Book of Cliches'' ({{ISBN|9780141025162}}), the \"[[Who ate all the pies?]]\" chant was first sung in 1894 by [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] supporters, and directed at\nFoulke's 300&nbsp;lb (about 136&nbsp;kg).<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/2007/11/09/football-legend-inspired-pie-chant-89520-20083992/\n|title=Football legend inspired pie chant\n|work=Daily Mirror\n|accessdate=2008-05-21\n|date=2007-09-11\n|last=Evans\n|first=Rebecca\n}}</ref> This is disputed, however, as a September 2019 article on the BBC Sport website pointed out that the tune to which the chant is sung - [[Knees Up Mother Brown]] - is believed to have originated in 1918, which was some 2 years after Foulke's death.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49392889|title='Fatty' Foulke: The legend of Sheffield United & Chelsea keeper|date=2019-08-30|access-date=2019-09-04|language=en-GB}}</ref> The tune to \"Who ate all the Pies\" is however more akin to \"Bread of Heaven\" so the BBC theory is less convincing.\n\nHe also won a single international cap for [[England national football team|England]] in 1897 against [[Wales national football team|Wales]].\n\nAt the end of the first match in the [[1902 FA Cup Final]], Foulke protested to the officials that [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]'s equalising goal should not have been allowed.

Foulke by now was remarkably temperamental. If he thought his defenders were not trying hard enough, he would walk off the field. Opposing forwards who incurred his displeasure would be picked up and thrown bodily into his goal. He was, however, a great crowd puller, and Chelsea decided to exploit this. To draw even more attention to his size, they placed two small boys behind his goal in an effort to distract the opposition even more. The boys would sometimes run and return the ball when it went out of play, and quite by accident, ball boys came into being.<ref>[[The Sunday Times]] ''Illustrated History of Football''. Reed International Books Limited. 1996. p16 {{ISBN|1-85613-341-9}}</ref> Foulke stayed for just one season before moving to his final club, [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]].\n\nAt some stage after his retirement Foulkes had played a beat-the-goalie contest in [[Blackpool]]. In a short obituary to Foulkes a Blackpool newspaper reminded its readers that Foulkes had \"appeared in a good [sic] scoring side-show on the spare ground, Britannia Place, South Shore, where many a football aspirant tried their goal-scoring prowess against the once noted goalkeeper\" (Blackpool Times, 6 May 1916).\n\nHe also owned a beer house in Sheffield along with a shop in Matilda Street and was known to walk around his home town wearing his FA Cup winner's medal around his neck on a homemade chain.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\nFoulke appears in the [[Mitchell and Kenyon]] films, playing in a match on 6 September 1902. His nephew, [[Jim Simmons (footballer)|Jim Simmons]], was also a professional footballer.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hogg |first=Tony |year=2005 |title=Who's Who of West Ham United |publisher=Profile Sports Media |isbn=1-903135-50-8| page=186}}</ref>\n\n==Fact, myth and legend==\nFouke's talent as a crowd-pleaser brought an extra dimension to conventional football entertainment. He became the darling of the crowd with a range of unusual skills and the various incidents which took place around him. At clearances he was able to punch the ball over the half way line - a huge advantage which could rapidly turn defence into attack.He was an expert in saving penalties and was also known to charge upfield to the penalty spot. His love of eating was legendary and there are many stories of how he would often arrive early for breakfast, set out for the whole team, and scoff the lot. He was a colourful character and it is said that a forward who offended him was picked up and held upside down by his feet over the muddy pitch. He is also said to have sat on people who teased him until they apologized. During a match with [[Burton Albion FC]] he stopped two penalties and the forward who missed the penalties is said to have complained 'where else could I have placed the kicks \u2013 there was nowhere else to aim\u2026'\n\nAt the end of the first match in the 1902 Cup Final Foulke protested to the officials that Southampton's equalizing goal should not have been allowed. Foulke left his dressing room unclothed and pursued the referee, who took refuge in a broom cupboard. Foulke had to be stopped by a group of F.A. officials from wrenching the cupboard door from its hinges to reach the hapless referee.\n\nWhilst playing against [[Accrington Stanley FC|Accrington Stanley]] in February 1907, it is said that Foulke's jersey clashed with the red of Stanley and no-one could find a jersey large enough to fit him, so he played wrapped in a sheet, procured from a nearby house. Bradford won the game 1-0 and Foulke did not dive during the match, so he kept a literally 'clean sheet'. It was during this game that he snapped a crossbar in two causing the match to be stopped.\n\nTo draw even more attention to his size, they placed two small boys behind his goal in an effort to distract the opposition even more. The boys would sometimes run and return the ball when it went out of play, and quite by accident, ball boys came into being.\n\n==Sayings==\n-The football chant \"Who ate all the pies\" is said to have originally been about Foulke, although this is generally accepted as an urban myth.\n-The one-liner \"Call me anything you want, but don't call me late for dinner\" has been attributed to him, but sources are unclear.

sometimes spelled ''Foulk'', ''Foulkes'') was a professional [[cricket]]er and [[association football|football]] player in England in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Foulke was renowned for his great size ({{height|ft=6|in=4}}<ref>{{cite news\n|title=Can footballers large it?\n|date=7 August 2002\n|work=[[BBC News]]\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/2178549.stm\n|accessdate=8 August 2008\n}}</ref> by some estimates) and weight, reaching perhaps 24 [[stone (weight)|stone]] (152&nbsp;kg; 336&nbsp;lb) at the end of his career, although reports on his weight vary.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49392889|title='Fatty' Foulke: The legend of Sheffield United & Chelsea keeper|date=30 August 2019|work=BBC Sport}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\nHe played four first-class matches for [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club]] in the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1900|1900 season]], but is remembered primarily as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] although he later played for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]].\n\nAfter being discovered playing for village side [[Blackwell Miners Welfare F.C.|Blackwell]] in a Derbyshire Cup tie at [[Ilkeston Town F.C. (1880s)|Ilkeston Town]], Foulke made his debut for Sheffield United against [[West Bromwich Albion]] on 1 September 1894 and led the team to three [[FA Cup]] finals (winning two) and a [[Football League First Division|League Championship]].\n\nAccording to ''The Cat's Pyjamas: The Penguin Book of Cliches'' ({{ISBN|9780141025162}}), the \"[[Who ate all the pies?]]\" chant was first sung in 1894 by [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] supporters, and directed at\nFoulke's 300&nbsp;lb (about 136&nbsp;kg).<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/2007/11/09/football-legend-inspired-pie-chant-89520-20083992/\n|title=Football legend inspired pie chant\n|work=Daily Mirror\n|accessdate=2008-05-21\n|date=2007-09-11\n|last=Evans\n|first=Rebecca\n}}</ref> This is disputed, however, as a September 2019 article on the BBC Sport website pointed out that the tune to which the chant is sung - [[Knees Up Mother Brown]] - is believed to have originated in 1918, which was some 2 years after Foulke's death.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49392889|title='Fatty' Foulke: The legend of Sheffield United & Chelsea keeper|date=2019-08-30|access-date=2019-09-04|language=en-GB}}</ref> The tune to \"Who ate all the Pies\" is however more akin to \"Bread of Heaven\" so the BBC theory is less convincing.\n\nHe also won a single international cap for [[England national football team|England]] in 1897 against [[Wales national football team|Wales]].\n\nAt the end of the first match in the [[1902 FA Cup Final]], Foulke protested to the officials that [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]'s equalising goal should not have been allowed. Foulke left his dressing room unclothed and pursued the referee, [[Tom Kirkham]], who took refuge in a broom cupboard. Foulke had to be stopped by a group of F.A. officials from wrenching the cupboard door from its hinges to reach the hapless referee.<ref>{{cite book | first1 = David | last1 = Bull | first2 = Bob | last2 = Brunskell |title=Match of the Millennium |publisher=Hagiology Publishing |year=2000|pages=30\u201333 |isbn=0-9534474-1-3}}</ref><ref>An account of the incident by the match linesman J. T. Howcroft suggests this version may be an embellishment of the facts. See \"Colossus\", p. 79.</ref> In the replay, Sheffield United won 2\u20131, with Foulke being required to make several saves to keep United in the match. He was also in goal for United when they suffered an FA Cup exit to Second Division [[Port Vale F.C.|Burslem Port Vale]] in 1898.\n[[File:Bradford City 1906-07.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Bradford City A.F.C.]] in 1906\u201307 season - Foulke is at the centre of the back row]]\nHe then moved to Chelsea for a fee of  \u00a350 and was made club captain. Foulke by now was remarkably temperamental. If he thought his defenders were not trying hard enough, he would walk off the field. Opposing forwards who incurred his displeasure would be picked up and thrown bodily into his goal. He was, however, a great crowd puller, and Chelsea decided to exploit this. To draw even more attention to his size, they placed two small boys behind his goal in an effort to distract the opposition even more. The boys would sometimes run and return the ball when it went out of play, and quite by accident, ball boys came into being.<ref>[[The Sunday Times]] ''Illustrated History of Football''. Reed International Books Limited. 1996. p16 {{ISBN|1-85613-341-9}}</ref> Foulke stayed for just one season before moving to his final club, [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]].\n\nAt some stage after his retirement Foulkes had played a beat-the-goalie contest in [[Blackpool]]. In a short obituary to Foulkes a Blackpool newspaper reminded its readers that Foulkes had \"appeared in a good [sic] scoring side-show on the spare ground, Britannia Place, South Shore, where many a football aspirant tried their goal-scoring prowess against the once noted goalkeeper\" (Blackpool Times, 6 May, 1916).\n\nHe also owned a beer house in Sheffield along with a shop in Matilda Street and was known to walk around his home town wearing his FA Cup winner's medal around his neck on a homemade chain.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\nFoulke appears in the [[Mitchell and Kenyon]] films, playing in a match on 6 September 1902. His nephew, [[Jim Simmons (footballer)|Jim Simmons]], was also a professional footballer.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hogg |first=Tony |year=2005 |title=Who's Who of West Ham United |publisher=Profile Sports Media |isbn=1-903135-50-8| page=186}}</ref>\n\n==Fact, myth and legend==\nFouke\u2019s talent as a crowd-pleaser brought an extra dimension to conventional football entertainment. He became the darling of the crowd with a range of unusual skills and the various incidents which took place around him. At clearances he was able to punch the ball over the half way line - a huge advantage which could rapidly turn defence into attack.He was an expert in saving penalties and was also known to charge upfield to the penalty spot. His love of eating was legendary and there are many stories of how he would often arrive early for breakfast, set out for the whole team, and scoff the lot. He was a colourful character and it is said that a forward who offended him was picked up and held upside down by his feet over the muddy pitch. He is also said to have sat on people who teased him until they apologized. During a match with [[Burton Albion FC]] he stopped two penalties and the forward who missed the penalties is said to have complained \u2018where else could I have placed the kicks \u2013 there was nowhere else to aim\u2026\u2019\n\nAt the end of the first match in the 1902 Cup Final Foulke protested to the officials that Southampton\u2019s equalizing goal should not have been allowed. Foulke left his dressing room unclothed and pursued the referee, who took refuge in a broom cupboard. Foulke had to be stopped by a group of F.A. officials from wrenching the cupboard door from its hinges to reach the hapless referee.\n\nWhilst playing against [[Accrington Stanley FC|Accrington Stanley]] in February 1907, it is said that Foulke\u2019s jersey clashed with the red of Stanley and no-one could find a jersey large enough to fit him, so he played wrapped in a sheet, procured from a nearby house. Bradford won the game 1-0 and Foulke did not dive during the match, so he kept a literally 'clean sheet'. It was during this game that he snapped a crossbar in two causing the match to be stopped. \n\nTo draw even more attention to his size, they placed two small boys behind his goal in an effort to distract the opposition even more. The boys would sometimes run and return the ball when it went out of play, and quite by accident, ball boys came into being.\n\n==Sayings== \n-The football chant \"Who ate all the pies\" is said to have originally been about Foulke, although this is generally accepted as an urban myth.\n-The one-liner \"Call me anything you want, but don't call me late for dinner\" has been attributed to him, but sources are unclear. In the Chelsea match programme for 2 December 1905 it was printed:   \"Foulke says he doesn't care how much they charge him, so long as they don't charge him too much for his dinner.\"\n\n==Death==\n'Fatty' Foulke died on the 1 May 1916 at the age of 42 years old, two weeks and five days.

Consequently, non-Japanese readers and viewers may find it difficult to understand his jokes. In fact, some of them cannot be translated into other [[languages]]. In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], certain [[set phrase]]s almost always accompany certain actions; many of these phrases have standard responses. A typical gag involves Shin-chan confounding his parents by using the wrong phrase for the occasion; for instance, saying \"Welcome back\" (\"\u304a\u304b\u3048\u308a\u306a\u3055\u3044\" \"okaeri nasai\") instead of using a more suitable wording such as \"I am home\" (\"\u305f\u3060\u3044\u307e\" \"Tadaima\") when he comes home. Another difficulty in translating arises from the use of [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] Japanese words. In scolding Shin-chan and attempting to educate him in proper behaviour his parent or tutor may use such a phrase to indicate the correct action. Often through misinterpreting such a phrase as a different, though similar-sounding phrase, or through interpreting it in one sense when another is intended, Shin-chan will embark on a course of action which, while it may be what he thinks is being requested of him, leads to bizarre acts which serve only to annoy his parents or tutors even more. This is not restricted to onomatopoeic words, since almost any word can become a source of confusion for Shin-chan, including English loanwords, such as mistaking \"cool\" for \"pool\" (\"That's pool!\" or \"P\u016bru da zo!\" (\"\u30d7\u30fc\u30eb\u3060\u305e\uff01\") for \"That's cool!\").\n\nSome other humorous themes which are repeated in the series are of a more universal nature, such as gags based on physical comedy (such as eating snow with chopsticks) or, as a child, unexpectedly using adult speech patterns or mannerisms. But even there, many of the gags may require an understanding of Japanese culture and/or language to be fully appreciated; for example, his \"Mr. Elephant\" impression, while being transparently obvious as a physical gag, also has a deeper resonance with contemporary Japanese culture since it refers to the popular Japanese children's song \"Zou-san\" (\u305e\u3046\u3055\u3093). Shin-chan regularly becomes besotted with pretty female characters who are much older than him, and an additional source of humor is derived from his childlike attempts at wooing these characters, such as by asking them (inappropriately, on several levels) \"Do you like [[Capsicum|green peppers]]?\" (\u30d4\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u597d\u304d?). He continually displays a lack of tact when talking to adults, asking questions such as \"How many times did you go to the police?\" to tough-looking men or \"How old are you?\" to elderly people.\n\nThe series works under a [[sliding timescale]] where the characters have maintained their ages throughout the course of the series. Though time has passed to allow for the rise and fall of several pop culture icons, marriages, pregnancies, and births of various characters, all the characters still maintain their age at the time of their introduction. For example, if the two major births in the series are taken into account (Shinnosuke's sister, Himawari, and his kindergarten teacher's child), Shinnosuke would be seven years old and in second or third grade, but he is not.\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n{{main|List of Crayon Shin-chan volumes}}\n''Crayon Shin-chan'' first appeared in 1990 in a Japanese weekly magazine called ''[[Weekly Manga Action]]'', which is published by [[Futabasha]].

During the early 2000s, it ran on Fox Kids (and later Jetix) in the [[United Kingdom]], on [[Fox Kids]] in [[Australia]] and on [[RT\u00c9 Two]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. RT\u00c9 Two has not shown the series since 2004, and on Jetix UK, the series was eventually relegated to shorts in-between programs, with more edits. The dub is of American origin, with veteran voice actors such as [[Kath Soucie]], [[Russi Taylor]], [[Grey DeLisle]], [[Pat Fraley]], Eric Loomis and [[Anndi McAfee]] playing the characters. Soucie voiced Shin and Misae.\n\nMany characters had their names changed to American-sounding ones, the original background music was completely replaced with new background music, and scenes with nudity were edited to remove any signs of indecent exposure. Most adult jokes were re-made into family-friendly jokes, and the profanity was edited out. However, the frequent appearance of Shinnosuke's naked [[buttocks]], as well as humor relating to [[breast]]-size and sexual themes, remained in the finished product. Some episodes that displayed adult material and mature content were not dubbed at all. Additionally the episodes were dubbed out of their original order which created continuity errors. For example, episode 29 shows Shin bringing his classmates to visit his newborn sister, episode 30 shows his sister coming home from her birth in the hospital and in episode 52 it was revealed that Shin was going to have a sister.\n\nIn 2003, [[phuuz entertainment inc.]] was commissioned by Lacey Entertainment to continue in similar style as the Vitello dub. But their episodes featured a new cast of voice artists (among others [[Diane Michelle]], [[Julie Maddalena]], Peter Doyle). The Phuuz dub was pitched to [[Adult Swim]] for a U.S. broadcast, but was rejected, as they felt that it was better suited to a younger audience.\n\n[[List of Crayon Shin-chan episodes#Vitello dub|52 episodes]] have been produced of the Vitello dub and [[List of Crayon Shin-chan episodes#Phuuz dub|at least 78 episodes]] of the Phuuz dub. Vitello and Phuuz episodes lasted on an average 21 minutes and contained three segments of 5 to 7 minutes. Some of the dubs of the series<ref>German, Dutch, European Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Polish, French, Greek, Danish and Latin American Spanish dub</ref> used the Vitello dub as the source for the dubbing. Some dubs<ref>Dutch, French, German, Latin American Spanish dub and European Portuguese</ref> also dubbed the Phuuz dub afterwards.\n\n==== Funimation dub ====\n[[Funimation]] acquired the Shin-chan North America license in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-02-14/funimation-licenses-crayon-shin-chan|title=Funimation Licenses Crayon Shin-Chan|publisher=Anime News Network|date=2010-04-01|accessdate=2010-04-16}}</ref> As per all international licenses for the series, TV Asahi remained a licensing partner for North America.\n\nFunimation's version features a [[Texas]]-based cast of voice actors. Funimation's dub takes many liberties with the source material and was heavily Americanized. Similar to the Vitello dub, episodes of the series were dubbed out of their original order, and segments were reordered. Additionally, many characters had their names changed to American-sounding ones. Many sexual references, dark humor, and references to current popular American culture were added. For example, in one scene, Ai and Penny argue over which one of them is [[Jessica Simpson]] (whose first album was not released until 1999) and which one is [[Ashlee Simpson]] (whose first album was not released until 2004), which is very different from the original Japanese script that dealt with many social issues within Japan at the time. At least two episodes reference [[Rudy Giuliani]] and his unsuccessful bid for President.\n\nNew, previously non-existent backstories were created, as well as significantly different personalities for the characters. For instance, the unseen father of Nene (known in the dub as \"Penny\") was suggested to be physically abusive toward both his wife and daughter, and this was used as a source of black humor. Principal Enchou was rewritten as a half-Peruvian, half-Romani man with a complicated prior life that includes a stint as a magician, in which he accidentally injured scores of audience members. Ageo-sensei (known in the dub as \"Miss Polly\"), Shinnosuke's teacher, was rewritten as a kinky [[Hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]], while Shin's schoolmate, Kazama, (known in the dub as \"Georgie\") was portrayed as a hawkish young Republican.\n\nThe first 52 episodes of the dub aired on [[Adult Swim]]. [[List of Crayon Shin-chan episodes#Funimation dub episodes|All three seasons]], 26 episodes per season, have also been released on DVD. Season 3, released in 2011, culminated in the official finale, effectively ending the Funimation series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/news/articles/37155/funimation-announces-new-july-titles-including-shin-chan-season-3-part-1|title=FUNimation Announces New July Titles Including \"Shin Chan\" Season 3, Part 1|publisher=toonzone.net|accessdate=2011-04-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607052433/http://www.toonzone.net/news/articles/37155/funimation-announces-new-july-titles-including-shin-chan-season-3-part-1|archivedate=2011-06-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.funimation.com/2011/05/shin-chan-season-3-now-streaming/|title=Shin-chan Season 3 Now Streaming!|publisher=Funimation Update Blog|date=May 27, 2011|accessdate=2011-06-12|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727120143/http://blog.funimation.com/2011/05/shin-chan-season-3-now-streaming/|archivedate=July 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004W75BUG |title=ShinChan: Season Three, Part One: Laura Bailey, Akiko Yajima, Chuck Huber, Keiji Fujiwara, Cynthia Cranz, Miki Narahashi, Colleen Clinkenbeard, Satomi Koorogi: Movies & TV |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walmart.com/ip/16652422 |title=Walmart.com: Shinchan: Season 3, Part 2 (Widescreen): TV Shows |publisher=walmart.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-15}}</ref>\n\n==== LUK International dub ====\nA fourth English dub of Crayon Shin-chan has been produced in Hong Kong by Red Angel Media in 2015<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fso-createhk.gov.hk/texten/production_search_result.php?pageno=2&Content1=Dubbing |title=Welcome to Film Services Office \u2013 Production Directory |publisher=Fso-createhk.gov.hk |date=2016-09-01 |accessdate=2016-12-13}}</ref> and was commissioned by LUK Internacional, the company that produces the Spanish, Portuguese, the second Italian and the second French dubs of Crayon Shin-chan and commissioned the [[Doraemon (2005 anime)#UK English dub|Doraemon dub that aired on Boomerang UK]].

Consequently, non-Japanese readers and viewers may find it difficult to understand his jokes. In fact, some of them cannot be translated into other [[languages]]. In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], certain [[set phrase]]s almost always accompany certain actions; many of these phrases have standard responses. A typical gag involves Shin-chan confounding his parents by using the wrong phrase for the occasion; for instance, saying \"Welcome back\" (\"\u304a\u304b\u3048\u308a\u306a\u3055\u3044\" \"okaeri nasai\") instead of using a more suitable wording such as \"I am home\" (\"\u305f\u3060\u3044\u307e\" \"Tadaima\") when he comes home. Another difficulty in translating arises from the use of [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] Japanese words. In scolding Shin-chan and attempting to educate him in proper behaviour his parent or tutor may use such a phrase to indicate the correct action. Often through misinterpreting such a phrase as a different, though similar-sounding phrase, or through interpreting it in one sense when another is intended, Shin-chan will embark on a course of action which, while it may be what he thinks is being requested of him, leads to bizarre acts which serve only to annoy his parents or tutors even more. This is not restricted to onomatopoeic words, since almost any word can become a source of confusion for Shin-chan, including English loanwords, such as mistaking \"cool\" for \"pool\" (\"That's pool!\" or \"P\u016bru da zo!\" (\"\u30d7\u30fc\u30eb\u3060\u305e\uff01\") for \"That's cool!\").\n\nSome other humorous themes which are repeated in the series are of a more universal nature, such as gags based on physical comedy (such as eating snow with chopsticks) or, as a child, unexpectedly using adult speech patterns or mannerisms. But even there, many of the gags may require an understanding of Japanese culture and/or language to be fully appreciated; for example, his \"Mr. Elephant\" impression, while being transparently obvious as a physical gag, also has a deeper resonance with contemporary Japanese culture since it refers to the popular Japanese children's song \"Zou-san\" (\u305e\u3046\u3055\u3093). Shin-chan regularly becomes besotted with pretty female characters who are much older than him, and an additional source of humor is derived from his childlike attempts at wooing these characters, such as by asking them (inappropriately, on several levels) \"Do you like [[Capsicum|green peppers]]?\" (\u30d4\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u597d\u304d?). He continually displays a lack of tact when talking to adults, asking questions such as \"How many times did you go to the police?\" to tough-looking men or \"How old are you?\" to elderly people.\n\nThe series works under a [[sliding timescale]] where the characters have maintained their ages throughout the course of the series. Though time has passed to allow for the rise and fall of several pop culture icons, marriages, pregnancies, and births of various characters, all the characters still maintain their age at the time of their introduction. For example, if the two major births in the series are taken into account (Shinnosuke's sister, Himawari, and his kindergarten teacher's child), Shinnosuke would be seven years old and in second or third grade, but he is not.\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n{{main|List of Crayon Shin-chan volumes}}\n''Crayon Shin-chan'' first appeared in 1990 in a Japanese weekly magazine called ''[[Weekly Manga Action]]'', which is published by [[Futabasha]].

During the early 2000s, it ran on Fox Kids (and later Jetix) in the [[United Kingdom]], on [[Fox Kids]] in [[Australia]] and on [[RT\u00c9 Two]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. RT\u00c9 Two has not shown the series since 2004, and on Jetix UK, the series was eventually relegated to shorts in-between programs, with more edits. The dub is of American origin, with veteran voice actors such as [[Kath Soucie]], [[Russi Taylor]], [[Grey DeLisle]], [[Pat Fraley]], Eric Loomis and [[Anndi McAfee]] playing the characters. Soucie voiced Shin and Misae.\n\nMany characters had their names changed to American-sounding ones, the original background music was completely replaced with new background music, and scenes with nudity were edited to remove any signs of indecent exposure. Most adult jokes were re-made into family-friendly jokes, and the profanity was edited out. However, the frequent appearance of Shinnosuke's naked [[buttocks]], as well as humor relating to [[breast]]-size and sexual themes, remained in the finished product. Some episodes that displayed adult material and mature content were not dubbed at all. Additionally the episodes were dubbed out of their original order which created continuity errors. For example, episode 29 shows Shin bringing his classmates to visit his newborn sister, episode 30 shows his sister coming home from her birth in the hospital and in episode 52 it was revealed that Shin was going to have a sister.\n\nIn 2003, [[phuuz entertainment inc.]] was commissioned by Lacey Entertainment to continue in similar style as the Vitello dub. But their episodes featured a new cast of voice artists (among others [[Diane Michelle]], [[Julie Maddalena]], Peter Doyle). The Phuuz dub was pitched to [[Adult Swim]] for a U.S. broadcast, but was rejected, as they felt that it was better suited to a younger audience.\n\n[[List of Crayon Shin-chan episodes#Vitello dub|52 episodes]] have been produced of the Vitello dub and [[List of Crayon Shin-chan episodes#Phuuz dub|at least 78 episodes]] of the Phuuz dub. Vitello and Phuuz episodes lasted on an average 21 minutes and contained three segments of 5 to 7 minutes. Some of the dubs of the series<ref>German, Dutch, European Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Polish, French, Greek, Danish and Latin American Spanish dub</ref> used the Vitello dub as the source for the dubbing. Some dubs<ref>Dutch, French, German, Latin American Spanish dub and European Portuguese</ref> also dubbed the Phuuz dub afterwards.\n\n==== Funimation dub ====\n[[Funimation]] acquired the Shin-chan North America license in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-02-14/funimation-licenses-crayon-shin-chan|title=Funimation Licenses Crayon Shin-Chan|publisher=Anime News Network|date=2010-04-01|accessdate=2010-04-16}}</ref> As per all international licenses for the series, TV Asahi remained a licensing partner for North America.\n\nFunimation's version features a [[Texas]]-based cast of voice actors. Funimation's dub takes many liberties with the source material and was heavily Americanized. Similar to the Vitello dub, episodes of the series were dubbed out of their original order, and segments were reordered. Additionally, many characters had their names changed to American-sounding ones. Many sexual references, dark humor, and references to current popular American culture were added. For example, in one scene, Ai and Penny argue over which one of them is [[Jessica Simpson]] (whose first album was not released until 1999) and which one is [[Ashlee Simpson]] (whose first album was not released until 2004), which is very different from the original Japanese script that dealt with many social issues within Japan at the time. At least two episodes reference [[Rudy Giuliani]] and his unsuccessful bid for President.\n\nNew, previously non-existent backstories were created, as well as significantly different personalities for the characters. For instance, the unseen father of Nene (known in the dub as \"Penny\") was suggested to be physically abusive toward both his wife and daughter, and this was used as a source of black humor. Principal Enchou was rewritten as a half-Peruvian, half-Romani man with a complicated prior life that includes a stint as a magician, in which he accidentally injured scores of audience members. Ageo-sensei (known in the dub as \"Miss Polly\"), Shinnosuke's teacher, was rewritten as a kinky [[Hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]], while Shin's schoolmate, Kazama, (known in the dub as \"Georgie\") was portrayed as a hawkish young Republican.\n\nThe first 52 episodes of the dub aired on [[Adult Swim]]. [[List of Crayon Shin-chan episodes#Funimation dub episodes|All three seasons]], 26 episodes per season, have also been released on DVD. Season 3, released in 2011, culminated in the official finale, effectively ending the Funimation series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/news/articles/37155/funimation-announces-new-july-titles-including-shin-chan-season-3-part-1|title=FUNimation Announces New July Titles Including \"Shin Chan\" Season 3, Part 1|publisher=toonzone.net|accessdate=2011-04-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607052433/http://www.toonzone.net/news/articles/37155/funimation-announces-new-july-titles-including-shin-chan-season-3-part-1|archivedate=2011-06-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.funimation.com/2011/05/shin-chan-season-3-now-streaming/|title=Shin-chan Season 3 Now Streaming!|publisher=Funimation Update Blog|date=May 27, 2011|accessdate=2011-06-12|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727120143/http://blog.funimation.com/2011/05/shin-chan-season-3-now-streaming/|archivedate=July 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004W75BUG |title=ShinChan: Season Three, Part One: Laura Bailey, Akiko Yajima, Chuck Huber, Keiji Fujiwara, Cynthia Cranz, Miki Narahashi, Colleen Clinkenbeard, Satomi Koorogi: Movies & TV |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walmart.com/ip/16652422 |title=Walmart.com: Shinchan: Season 3, Part 2 (Widescreen): TV Shows |publisher=walmart.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-15}}</ref>\n\n==== LUK International dub ====\nA fourth English dub of Crayon Shin-chan has been produced in Hong Kong by Red Angel Media in 2015<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fso-createhk.gov.hk/texten/production_search_result.php?pageno=2&Content1=Dubbing |title=Welcome to Film Services Office \u2013 Production Directory |publisher=Fso-createhk.gov.hk |date=2016-09-01 |accessdate=2016-12-13}}</ref> and was commissioned by LUK Internacional, the company that produces the Spanish, Portuguese, the second Italian and the second French dubs of Crayon Shin-chan and commissioned the [[Doraemon (2005 anime)#UK English dub|Doraemon dub that aired on Boomerang UK]].
