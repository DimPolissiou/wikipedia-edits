There are two models: the A4000/040 released in October 1992 with a [[Motorola 68040]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], and the A4000/030 released in April 1993 with a [[Motorola 68EC030]].\n\nThe Amiga 4000 system design was generally similar to the A3000's, but introduced the [[Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA) chipset with enhanced graphics. The [[SCSI]] system from previous Amigas was replaced by the lower-cost [[Parallel ATA]].\n\nThe original A4000 is housed in a beige horizontal desktop box with a separate keyboard. Later, Commodore released an expanded tower version called the [[Amiga 4000T|A4000T]].\n\n==Technical information==\n\n=== Processor and RAM ===\nThe stock A4000 shipped with either a [[Motorola 68EC030]] or [[Motorola 68040|68040]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], 2&nbsp;MB of [[Amiga Chip RAM]] and up to 16&nbsp;MB of additional RAM in 32-bit [[SIMM]]s.<ref name=\"a4000_user\">{{citation | url=http://www.bombjack.org/commodore/amiga/amiga-commodore/A4000_Users_Guide_(UK).pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613032230/http://www.bombjack.org/commodore/amiga/amiga-commodore/A4000_Users_Guide_(UK).pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date=2012-06-13 | title=A4000 User's Guide | publisher=Commodore Electronics Limited | year=1992 }}</ref> There is a non-functional jumper that was intended to expand the \"chip RAM\" to 8MB.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/amiga/a4000jumpers.html | title=A4000 Motherboard Jumpers | accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> Later, third-party developers created various CPU expansion boards featuring higher-rated [[Motorola 68040|68040]], [[Motorola 68060|68060]] and [[PowerPC]] CPUs. Such hardware also typically offers faster and higher-capacity RAM (128&nbsp;MB or greater).\n\n===A4000-CR version===\nUnlike previous Amiga models, early A4000 machines have the CPU mounted in an expansion board; the [[motherboard]] does not have an integrated CPU. Later revisions of the A4000 have the CPU and 2&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] RAM [[surface-mount technology|surface-mounted]] on the motherboard in an effort to reduce costs. These machines are known as the A4000-CR (cost-reduced) and the surface-mounted CPU is a 68EC030. The cost-reduced models also make use of a non-rechargeable lithium battery for real-time clock battery backup rather than a rechargeable [[nickel-cadmium battery|NiCad battery]]. The NiCad backup battery is one of the most common causes of problems in an aging device that uses one because it has a tendency to eventually leak. The released fluids are somewhat corrosive and can eventually damage the circuitry.\n\n===Graphics and sound===\nThe A4000 is the first Amiga model to have shipped with Commodore's third-generation Amiga chipset, the 32-bit [[Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA). As the name implies, AGA introduces improved graphical abilities, specifically, a palette expanded from 12-bit color depth (4096 colors) to 24-bit (16.8 million colors) and new 64, 128, 256 and 262,144 ([[hold-and-modify|HAM-8]]) color modes. Unlike earlier Amiga chipsets, all color modes are available at all display resolutions. AGA also improves sprite capacity and graphics performance. The on-board sound hardware remains identical to that of the original Amiga chipset (the [[original Amiga chipset#Audio features in general|Paula sound chip]]), namely, four [[direct memory access|DMA]]-driven 8-bit [[Pulse code modulation|PCM]] channels, with two channels for the left speaker and two for the right.\n\n===Peripherals and expansion===\nThe A4000 has a number of Amiga-specific connectors, including two [[DE-9 connector|DE-9]] ports for [[joystick]]s, [[Mouse (computing)|mice]], and [[light pen]]s, a standard 25-pin [[RS-232]] [[serial port]] and a 25-pin [[Centronics]] [[parallel port]]. As a result, at launch the A4000 was compatible with many existing Amiga peripherals, such as [[MIDI]] devices, serial [[modem]]s and [[sampling (signal processing)|sound samplers]].<ref name=\"a4000_user\"/>\n\nLike the just-earlier Amiga model, the [[Amiga 3000|3000]], the A4000 has four internal 32-bit [[Amiga Zorro III|Zorro III]] expansion slots. This expansion bus allows the use of devices which comply with the [[AutoConfig]] standard, such as graphic cards, audio cards, network cards, SCSI controllers, and later even [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] controllers.<ref name=\"zorro3\">{{citation | url=http://www.thule.no/haynie/zorroiii/docs/zorro3.pdf | title=The Zorro III Bus Specification | first=Dave | last=Haynie | date=20 March 1991 | publisher=Commodore-Amiga, Inc. | access-date=2 September 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716212151/http://www.thule.no/haynie/zorroiii/docs/zorro3.pdf | archive-date=16 July 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> One of the most notable hardware items of the era is the [[NewTek]] [[Video Toaster]] system which became popular in the 1990s for amateur and commercial [[desktop video]] production of [[standard-definition]] [[broadcast quality]] video, consisting of tools for [[vision mixer|video switching]], [[chroma key]]ing, [[character generator|character generation]], [[animation]], and [[image manipulation]].\n\nThe three [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] slots can be activated by use of a bridgeboard, which connects the Zorro and ISA buses. Such bridgeboards typically feature on-board [[IBM PC Compatible|IBM-PC-compatible]] hardware, including [[Intel 80286]], [[80386]], or [[80486]] microprocessors allowing emulation of an entire IBM-PC system in hardware. Compatible ISA cards may then be installed into the two remaining ISA slots.\n\nLater, in an effort to offer modern expansion options third-party developers created replacement expansion boards for the A4000 which provide [[peripheral component interconnect|PCI]] slots allowing use of higher performance and widely available PCI hardware, such as graphic, sound, and network cards.\n\n===Operating system===\nThe A4000 shipped with [[AmigaOS version history#Amiga_OS_3.0,_3.1|AmigaOS 3.0]], consisting of Workbench 3.0 and [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]] 3.0, which together provide a single-user multi-tasking operating system and support for the built-in hardware. Following release of AmigaOS 3.1 it became possible to upgrade the A4000 by installing compatible Kickstart 3.1 ROM chips. The later AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9 releases were software-only updates requiring Kickstart 3.1.\n\n[[AmigaOS 4]], a [[PowerPC]]-native release of the operating system, can be used with the A4000 provided a [[PowerUP (accelerator)#CyberStorm PPC|CyberStorm PPC]] board is installed.

Definition a woman with depression looking out the window on a bus. Share on Pinterest A person with depression may experience persistent sadness. Depression is a mood disorder that involves a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. It is different from the mood fluctuations that people regularly experience as a part of life. Major life events, such as bereavement or the loss of a job, can lead to depression. However, doctors only consider feelings of grief to be part of depression if they persist. Depression is an ongoing problem, not a passing one. It consists of episodes during which the symptoms last for at least 2 weeks. Depression can last for several weeks, months, or years. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of depression can include: a depressed mood reduced interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed a loss of sexual desire changes in appetite unintentional weight loss or gain sleeping too much or too little agitation, restlessness, and pacing up and down slowed movement and speech fatigue or loss of energy feelings of worthlessness or guilt difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, or an attempt at suicide Find out more about recognizing the hidden signs of depression.

They may experience symptoms such as: crying low energy clinginess defiant behavior vocal outbursts Younger children may have difficulty expressing how they feel in words. This can make it harder for them to explain their feelings of sadness. Causes The medical community does not fully understand the causes of depression. There are many possible causes, and sometimes, various factors combine to trigger symptoms. Factors that are likely to play a role include: genetic features changes in the brain's neurotransmitter levels environmental factors psychological and social factors additional conditions, such as bipolar disorder Treatment a man having Psychotherapy Share on Pinterest Psychotherapy may help a person manage their symptoms of depression. Depression is treatable, and managing symptoms usually involves three components: Support: This can range from discussing practical solutions and possible causes to educating family members. Psychotherapy: Also known as talking therapy, some options include one-to-one counseling and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Drug treatment: A doctor may prescribe antidepressants. Medication Antidepressants can help treat moderate-to-severe depression. Several classes of antidepressants are available: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) tricyclic antidepressants atypical antidepressants selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) Each class acts on a different neurotransmitter or combination of neurotransmitters. A person should only take these medications as their doctor prescribes. Some drugs can take a while to have an impact. By stopping the drug, a person may not experience the benefits that it could offer. Some people stop taking medication after symptoms improve, but this can lead to a relapse. Raise any concerns about antidepressants with a doctor, including any intention to stop taking the medication. Here, learn more about antidepressants and how they can help. Medication side effects SSRIs and SNRIs can have side effects. A person may experience: nausea constipation diarrhea low blood sugar weight loss a rash sexual dysfunction Find out more about the possible side effects of antidepressants here. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) require manufacturers to add warnings to the packaging of antidepressant drugs. The warnings should indicate that, among other risks, these medications may increase suicidal thoughts or actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults within the first few months of treatment. Natural remedies Some people use natural remedies, such as herbal medicines, to treat mild-to-moderate depression. However, since the FDA do not monitor herbal remedies, manufacturers may not be truthful about the quality of these products. They may not be safe or effective. The following are some of the more popular herbs and plants that people use to treat depression, St. John's wort: This is not suitable for people who have or may have bipolar disorder. Learn more here. Ginseng: Practitioners of traditional medicine may use this to improve mental clarity and reduce stress. Find out more here about ginseng. Chamomile: This contains flavonoids that may have an antidepressant effect. For more information about chamomile, click here. Lavender: This may help reduce anxiety and insomnia. Learn more here about lavender. It is essential to speak to a doctor before using any type of herbal remedy or supplement to treat depression. Some herbs can interfere with the action of drugs or otherwise make symptoms worse. Supplements A person may take the herbs above as supplements to treat symptoms of mild-to-moderate depression. Other types of supplements may also help treat these symptoms. It is important to remember that the FDA do not monitor supplements to ensure that they are effective or safe. Nonherbal supplements that may help treat depression include: S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe): This is a synthetic form of a natural chemical in the body. 5-hydroxytryptophan: This may help boost serotonin, the neurotransmitter in the brain that affects a person's mood. Some research has suggested that SAMe may be as helpful as the prescription antidepressants imipramine and escitalopram, but more investigation is necessary. Learn more about how herbs and supplements may help relieve depression. Food and diet Eating a lot of sugary or processed foods can lead to various physical health problems. Results of a 2019 study suggest that a diet that includes many of these types of food could affect the mental health of young adults. The study also found that eating more of the following foods helped reduce depression symptoms: fruit vegetables fish olive oil Can other foods worsen or improve depression symptoms? Find out here. Psychotherapy Psychological, or talking, therapies for depression include CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy, and problem-solving treatment, among others. For some forms of depression, psychotherapy is usually the first-line treatment, while some people respond better to a combination of psychotherapy and medications. CBT and interpersonal psychotherapy are the two main types of psychotherapy for depression. A person may have CBT in individual sessions with a therapist, in groups, over the telephone, or online. Interpersonal therapy aims to help people identify: emotional problems that affect relationships and communication how these issues also affect their mood how all of this may be changed Exercise Aerobic exercise raises endorphin levels and stimulates the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which is linked with mood. This may help relieve mild depression. Brain stimulation therapies Brain stimulation therapies are another treatment option. For example, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation sends magnetic pulses to the brain, and this may help treat major depression. If depression does not respond to drug treatment, the person may benefit from electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT. This may be effective if psychosis occurs with depression. Types of depression There are several forms of depression. Below are some of the most common types. Major depression A person with major depression experiences a constant state of sadness. They may lose interest in activities that they used to enjoy. Treatment usually involves medication and psychotherapy. Persistent depressive disorder Also known as dysthymia, persistent depressive disorder causes symptoms that last for at least 2 years. A person with this disorder may have episodes of major depression as well as milder symptoms. Bipolar disorder Depression is a common symptom of bipolar disorder, and research shows that people with this disorder may have symptoms around half of the time. This can make bipolar disorder hard to distinguish from depression. What does bipolar disorder involve, and what types are there? Find out here. Psychotic depression Some people experience psychosis with depression. Psychosis can involve delusions, such as false beliefs and a detachment from reality. It can also involve hallucinations \u2014 sensing things that do not exist. Postpartum depression After giving birth, many women experience what some people call the \"baby blues.\" When hormone levels readjust after childbirth, changes in mood can result. Postpartum depression, or postnatal depression, is more severe. There is no single cause for this type of depression, and it can persist for months or years. Anyone who experiences ongoing depression after delivery should seek medical attention. Major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern Previously called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, this type of depression is related to the reduction in daylight during the fall and winter. It lifts during the rest of the year and in response to light therapy. People who live in countries with long or severe winters seem to be affected more by this condition.

A person with a parent or sibling who has depression is two-to-three times more likely than the general public to develop the condition. However, many people with depression have no family history of it. A recent study suggests that susceptibility to depression may not result from genetic variation. The researchers acknowledge that while depression could be inherited, many other issues also influence its development. Learn more about whether depression has a genetic link. Is it a disability? Depression is the leading cause of disability around the world, according to the WHO. In the U.S., the Social Security Administration consider depressive, bipolar, and related disorders to be disabilities. If a person's depression prevents them from working, they may qualify for social security disability insurance benefits. The person must have worked long enough and recently enough to qualify for disability benefits. For more information, visit the administration's website. Is it curable? While there is no cure for depression, there are effective treatments that help with recovery. The earlier treatment starts, the more successful it may be. Many people with depression recover after following a treatment plan. Even with effective treatment, however, a relapse may occur.

For example, he enjoys a symphony concert not so much for the music, but for the atmosphere: \"the lights danced before his eyes and the concert hall blazed into unimaginable splendor.\" Later on in the story, he steals money from where he works to support a short escapade in [[New York City]]. Once he exhausts his funds and his father catches wind of what has happened, he commits suicide by jumping in front of a train rather than allow his father to take him back to Pittsburgh.\n\nPaul's teachers and father refer to Paul's \"case\", representing him at a distance and as an example of someone to be studied, handled, and managed; the term enables Cather to adopt \"the voice of medical authority.\" <ref name=WK>{{cite book|first= Wayne |last= Koestenbaum | title=The Queen's Throat: Opera, Homosexuality and the Mystery of Desire |publisher =Gay Men's Press | date=1994 |pages= 28\u201329|title-link= The Queen's Throat }}</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe short story \u201cPaul\u2019s Case\u201d is about a young boy who struggles to fit in at home and in school.The story began with the reader finding out the main character, Paul, is suspended fro high school. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado; which is later shown to be of importance. Paul works as an usher for Carnegie Hall in Pittsburg. His job is one of the only parts of his life he enjoys. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is one of abuse, so much so that while in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake all night, imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia Street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four lovely children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful. He lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards; a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing money from his dad' s job. Paul buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is en route to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old one was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

Definition a woman with depression looking out the window on a bus. Share on Pinterest A person with depression may experience persistent sadness. Depression is a mood disorder that involves a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. It is different from the mood fluctuations that people regularly experience as a part of life. Major life events, such as bereavement or the loss of a job, can lead to depression. However, doctors only consider feelings of grief to be part of depression if they persist. Depression is an ongoing problem, not a passing one. It consists of episodes during which the symptoms last for at least 2 weeks. Depression can last for several weeks, months, or years. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of depression can include: a depressed mood reduced interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed a loss of sexual desire changes in appetite unintentional weight loss or gain sleeping too much or too little agitation, restlessness, and pacing up and down slowed movement and speech fatigue or loss of energy feelings of worthlessness or guilt difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, or an attempt at suicide Find out more about recognizing the hidden signs of depression.

They may experience symptoms such as: crying low energy clinginess defiant behavior vocal outbursts Younger children may have difficulty expressing how they feel in words. This can make it harder for them to explain their feelings of sadness. Causes The medical community does not fully understand the causes of depression. There are many possible causes, and sometimes, various factors combine to trigger symptoms. Factors that are likely to play a role include: genetic features changes in the brain's neurotransmitter levels environmental factors psychological and social factors additional conditions, such as bipolar disorder Treatment a man having Psychotherapy Share on Pinterest Psychotherapy may help a person manage their symptoms of depression. Depression is treatable, and managing symptoms usually involves three components: Support: This can range from discussing practical solutions and possible causes to educating family members. Psychotherapy: Also known as talking therapy, some options include one-to-one counseling and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Drug treatment: A doctor may prescribe antidepressants. Medication Antidepressants can help treat moderate-to-severe depression. Several classes of antidepressants are available: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) tricyclic antidepressants atypical antidepressants selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) Each class acts on a different neurotransmitter or combination of neurotransmitters. A person should only take these medications as their doctor prescribes. Some drugs can take a while to have an impact. By stopping the drug, a person may not experience the benefits that it could offer. Some people stop taking medication after symptoms improve, but this can lead to a relapse. Raise any concerns about antidepressants with a doctor, including any intention to stop taking the medication. Here, learn more about antidepressants and how they can help. Medication side effects SSRIs and SNRIs can have side effects. A person may experience: nausea constipation diarrhea low blood sugar weight loss a rash sexual dysfunction Find out more about the possible side effects of antidepressants here. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) require manufacturers to add warnings to the packaging of antidepressant drugs. The warnings should indicate that, among other risks, these medications may increase suicidal thoughts or actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults within the first few months of treatment. Natural remedies Some people use natural remedies, such as herbal medicines, to treat mild-to-moderate depression. However, since the FDA do not monitor herbal remedies, manufacturers may not be truthful about the quality of these products. They may not be safe or effective. The following are some of the more popular herbs and plants that people use to treat depression, St. John's wort: This is not suitable for people who have or may have bipolar disorder. Learn more here. Ginseng: Practitioners of traditional medicine may use this to improve mental clarity and reduce stress. Find out more here about ginseng. Chamomile: This contains flavonoids that may have an antidepressant effect. For more information about chamomile, click here. Lavender: This may help reduce anxiety and insomnia. Learn more here about lavender. It is essential to speak to a doctor before using any type of herbal remedy or supplement to treat depression. Some herbs can interfere with the action of drugs or otherwise make symptoms worse. Supplements A person may take the herbs above as supplements to treat symptoms of mild-to-moderate depression. Other types of supplements may also help treat these symptoms. It is important to remember that the FDA do not monitor supplements to ensure that they are effective or safe. Nonherbal supplements that may help treat depression include: S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe): This is a synthetic form of a natural chemical in the body. 5-hydroxytryptophan: This may help boost serotonin, the neurotransmitter in the brain that affects a person's mood. Some research has suggested that SAMe may be as helpful as the prescription antidepressants imipramine and escitalopram, but more investigation is necessary. Learn more about how herbs and supplements may help relieve depression. Food and diet Eating a lot of sugary or processed foods can lead to various physical health problems. Results of a 2019 study suggest that a diet that includes many of these types of food could affect the mental health of young adults. The study also found that eating more of the following foods helped reduce depression symptoms: fruit vegetables fish olive oil Can other foods worsen or improve depression symptoms? Find out here. Psychotherapy Psychological, or talking, therapies for depression include CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy, and problem-solving treatment, among others. For some forms of depression, psychotherapy is usually the first-line treatment, while some people respond better to a combination of psychotherapy and medications. CBT and interpersonal psychotherapy are the two main types of psychotherapy for depression. A person may have CBT in individual sessions with a therapist, in groups, over the telephone, or online. Interpersonal therapy aims to help people identify: emotional problems that affect relationships and communication how these issues also affect their mood how all of this may be changed Exercise Aerobic exercise raises endorphin levels and stimulates the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which is linked with mood. This may help relieve mild depression. Brain stimulation therapies Brain stimulation therapies are another treatment option. For example, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation sends magnetic pulses to the brain, and this may help treat major depression. If depression does not respond to drug treatment, the person may benefit from electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT. This may be effective if psychosis occurs with depression. Types of depression There are several forms of depression. Below are some of the most common types. Major depression A person with major depression experiences a constant state of sadness. They may lose interest in activities that they used to enjoy. Treatment usually involves medication and psychotherapy. Persistent depressive disorder Also known as dysthymia, persistent depressive disorder causes symptoms that last for at least 2 years. A person with this disorder may have episodes of major depression as well as milder symptoms. Bipolar disorder Depression is a common symptom of bipolar disorder, and research shows that people with this disorder may have symptoms around half of the time. This can make bipolar disorder hard to distinguish from depression. What does bipolar disorder involve, and what types are there? Find out here. Psychotic depression Some people experience psychosis with depression. Psychosis can involve delusions, such as false beliefs and a detachment from reality. It can also involve hallucinations \u2014 sensing things that do not exist. Postpartum depression After giving birth, many women experience what some people call the \"baby blues.\" When hormone levels readjust after childbirth, changes in mood can result. Postpartum depression, or postnatal depression, is more severe. There is no single cause for this type of depression, and it can persist for months or years. Anyone who experiences ongoing depression after delivery should seek medical attention. Major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern Previously called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, this type of depression is related to the reduction in daylight during the fall and winter. It lifts during the rest of the year and in response to light therapy. People who live in countries with long or severe winters seem to be affected more by this condition.

A person with a parent or sibling who has depression is two-to-three times more likely than the general public to develop the condition. However, many people with depression have no family history of it. A recent study suggests that susceptibility to depression may not result from genetic variation. The researchers acknowledge that while depression could be inherited, many other issues also influence its development. Learn more about whether depression has a genetic link. Is it a disability? Depression is the leading cause of disability around the world, according to the WHO. In the U.S., the Social Security Administration consider depressive, bipolar, and related disorders to be disabilities. If a person's depression prevents them from working, they may qualify for social security disability insurance benefits. The person must have worked long enough and recently enough to qualify for disability benefits. For more information, visit the administration's website. Is it curable? While there is no cure for depression, there are effective treatments that help with recovery. The earlier treatment starts, the more successful it may be. Many people with depression recover after following a treatment plan. Even with effective treatment, however, a relapse may occur. To prevent relapse, people who take medication for depression should continue with treatment \u2014 even after symptoms improve or go away \u2014 for as long as their doctor advises. Find some tips to help prevent depression from returning. Triggers Triggers are emotional, psychological, or physical events or circumstances that can cause depression symptoms to appear or return. These are some of the most common triggers: Stressful life events, such as loss, family conflicts, and changes in relationships. Incomplete recovery after having stopped treatment too soon Medical conditions, such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Find out more about depression triggers. Risk factors Some people have a higher risk of depression than others. Risk factors include: experiencing certain life events, such as bereavement, work issues, changes in relationships, financial problems, and medical concerns experiencing acute stress having a lack of successful coping strategies having a close relative with depression using some prescription drugs, such as corticosteroids, some beta-blockers, and interferon using recreational drugs, such as alcohol or amphetamines having sustained a head injury having had a previous episode of major depression having a chronic condition, such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or cardiovascular disease living with persistent pain Statistics During any given year in the U.S., major depression affects over 16.1 million people aged 18 or older, or around 6.7% of the adult population. According to the CDC, 3.2% of children and adolescents between the ages of 3 and 17 years \u2014 about 1.9 million individuals \u2014 have received a diagnosis of depression.

For example, he enjoys a symphony concert not so much for the music, but for the atmosphere: \"the lights danced before his eyes and the concert hall blazed into unimaginable splendor.\" Later on in the story, he steals money from where he works to support a short escapade in [[New York City]].

He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado; which is later shown to be of importance. Paul works as an usher for Carnegie Hall in Pittsburg. His job is one of the only parts of his life he enjoys. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is one of abuse, so much so that while in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake all night, imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia Street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four lovely children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful. He lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards; a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing money from his dad' s job. Paul buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is en route to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old one was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

The \"whirling\" motions of said snowfall occur several times; as Paul gazes out of the train window on his way to New York, as well as consistently throughout the time he is actually in the city. It's almost as if we as readers are as much in a fantasy world as Paul is himself. Note that on his way back from New York, he gazes out of the train window to see nothing of the sort besides the snow that has already fallen - A depressing representation that Paul's fantasy has come to an end.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal |last1=Czernicki |first1=Martha |title=Fantasy and Reality in Willa Cather's PAUL'S CASE |journal=The Explicator |date=2017 |volume=75 |issue=4 |page=242|doi=10.1080/00144940.2017.1379466 }}</ref>\n\n'''Paul's Smile:''' There are several instances where Paul's smile is brought up in the story and a few different interpretations of what his smile symbolizes. When Paul has a meeting with his instructors and the principal, he puts on a smile. The narrator notes that other boys would be more afraid than Paul was and would most likely have given in to an emotional and remorseful response about their disruptive behaviors. Paul's smile in this circumstance displays his cocky attitude and shows that he doesn't care about what the authorities have to say to him.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://englishivbl2b.pbworks.com/w/page/19070348/%22Paul%27s%20Case%22%20--%20Cork%20Terborg,%20Payton%20Laczynski,%20Katie%20Erickson|title=English / \"Paul's Case\" -- Cork Terborg, Payton Laczynski, Katie Erickson|website=englishivbl2b.pbworks.com|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> A different interpretation of Paul's smile arises from the detail where Paul's drawing master claimed there was, \"something sort of haunted about [his smile],\" which is a detail that is often used to support the idea that Paul's smile refers to him having a disability.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''The Basement:''' During the story, Paul sneaks into his home through his basement and reflects on his relationship with his father.

Paul tries to greet each customer and provide them with exceptional customer service. Besides, Paul loves watching the concerts and other social events that are happening at the Hall. Once Paul's father stopped him from working at the theater, Paul lost his sole outlet and place of comfort. Paul's connection to the theater developed because he acquired interest in the arts and it became a reliable place for him. The theater allowed him to develop creative skills that he did not gain at school. Being an usher at the theater helped Paul express himself and be around others who enjoyed the arts just like him. Paul was himself and he felt a level of sense of approval at the theater. This place may have given him the approval he was looking for in his household<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://login.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu/login?url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3387549?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=benefits&searchText=of&searchText=extracurricular&searchText=activities&searchUri=/action/doBasicSearch?searchType=facetSearch&amp;sd=&amp;ed=&amp;Query=benefits+of+extracurricular+activities&amp;pagemark=cGFnZU1hcms9Mg%253D%253D&ab_segments=0/basic_SYC-5152/control&seq=1|title=Marvin K.
