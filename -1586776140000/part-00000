The franchise is based on the [[anthropomorphic]] concept that all toys, unknown to humans, are secretly alive, and the films focus on a diverse group of toys that feature a classic [[cowboy]] doll named [[Sheriff Woody]] and a modern [[astronaut|spaceman]] action figure named [[Buzz Lightyear]], principally voiced by [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Tim Allen]], respectively. The group unexpectedly embark on adventures that challenge and change them.\n\nThe franchise consists mainly of four [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI animated]] films: ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' (1999), ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' (2010), and ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' (2019). ''Toy Story'' was the first feature-length film to be made entirely using computer-generated imagery. The first two films of the franchise were directed by [[John Lasseter]], the third by [[Lee Unkrich]], who acted as the co-director of the second film (together with [[Ash Brannon]]), and the fourth by [[Josh Cooley]].\n\n''Toy Story'' is the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|20th-highest-grossing franchise]] worldwide, the [[List of highest-grossing animated films#Highest-grossing animated franchises and film series|fourth-highest-grossing animated franchise]], and is among the most critically acclaimed franchises of all time. The films, produced on a total budget of $520 million, have grossed more than $3 billion worldwide. Each film set [[box office]] records, with the third and fourth included in the top 50 all-time worldwide films. All four films have received universal acclaim from critics and audiences.<ref name=\"toystoryrt\"/><ref name=\"toystory2rt\"/><ref name=\"toystory3rt\"/><ref name=\"toystory4rt\"/> The first two films were re-released in theaters as a [[Disney Digital 3-D]] \"double feature\" for at least two weeks in October 2009, as a promotion for the then-upcoming third film.<ref name=\"Empire3D\"/>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Films ==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

It was the first feature-length film created entirely by [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and was directed by [[John Lasseter]]. The plot involves Andy (voiced by [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]]), an imaginative young boy, getting a new Buzz Lightyear ([[Tim Allen]]) action figure for his birthday, causing Sheriff Woody ([[Tom Hanks]]), a vintage cowboy doll, to think that he has been replaced as Andy's favorite toy. In competing for Andy's attention, Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out of a window, leading the other toys to believe he tried to murder Buzz. Determined to set things right, Woody attempts to save Buzz, and both must escape from the house of the next-door neighbor Sid Phillips (voiced by [[Erik von Detten]]), who likes to torture and destroy toys. In addition to Hanks and Allen, the film featured the voices of [[Don Rickles]], [[Jim Varney]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[John Ratzenberger]], and [[Annie Potts]]. The film was critically and financially successful, grossing over $373 million worldwide.<ref name=\"toystoryrt\"/><ref name=\"TS1BO\"/> The film was later re-released in [[Disney Digital 3-D]] as part of a double feature, along with ''Toy Story 2'', for a two-week run,<ref name=\"Empire3D\">{{cite news|last=Richards|first=Olly|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=21856|title=Toy Story Movies Going 3D|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=January 24, 2008|access-date=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107025021/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/toy-story-movies-going-3d/|archive-date=November 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> which was later extended due to its financial success.<ref name=oct12update2>{{cite news|last=Chen|first=David|title=Lee Unkrich Announces Kristen Schaal and Blake Clark Cast in Toy Story 3; Toy Story 3D Double Feature To Stay in Theaters|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/lee-unkrich-announces-kristen-schaal-and-blake-clark-cast-in-toy-story-3-toy-story-3d-double-feature-to-stay-in-theaters/|access-date=August 31, 2012|newspaper=SlashFilm|date=October 12, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625050200/http://www.slashfilm.com/lee-unkrich-announces-kristen-schaal-and-blake-clark-cast-in-toy-story-3-toy-story-3d-double-feature-to-stay-in-theaters/|archive-date=June 25, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Toy Story 2'' (1999) ===\n{{Main|Toy Story 2}}\n''Toy Story 2'', the second film in the franchise, was released on November 24, 1999.

The franchise is based on the [[anthropomorphic]] concept that all toys, unknown to humans, are secretly alive, and the films focus on a diverse group of toys that feature a classic [[cowboy]] doll named [[Sheriff Woody]] and a modern [[astronaut|spaceman]] action figure named [[Buzz Lightyear]], principally voiced by [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Tim Allen]], respectively. The group unexpectedly embark on adventures that challenge and change them.\n\nThe franchise consists mainly of four [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI animated]] films: ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' (1999), ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' (2010), and ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' (2019). ''Toy Story'' was the first feature-length film to be made entirely using computer-generated imagery. The first two films of the franchise were directed by [[John Lasseter]], the third by [[Lee Unkrich]], who acted as the co-director of the second film (together with [[Ash Brannon]]), and the fourth by [[Josh Cooley]].\n\n''Toy Story'' is the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|20th-highest-grossing franchise]] worldwide, the [[List of highest-grossing animated films#Highest-grossing animated franchises and film series|fourth-highest-grossing animated franchise]], and is among the most critically acclaimed franchises of all time. The films, produced on a total budget of $520 million, have grossed more than $3 billion worldwide. Each film set [[box office]] records, with the third and fourth included in the top 50 all-time worldwide films. All four films have received universal acclaim from critics and audiences.<ref name=\"toystoryrt\"/><ref name=\"toystory2rt\"/><ref name=\"toystory3rt\"/><ref name=\"toystory4rt\"/> The first two films were re-released in theaters as a [[Disney Digital 3-D]] \"double feature\" for at least two weeks in October 2009, as a promotion for the then-upcoming third film.<ref name=\"Empire3D\"/>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Films ==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

In competing for Andy's attention, Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out of a window, leading the other toys to believe he tried to murder Buzz. Determined to set things right, Woody attempts to save Buzz, and both must escape from the house of the next-door neighbor Sid Phillips (voiced by [[Erik von Detten]]), who likes to torture and destroy toys. In addition to Hanks and Allen, the film featured the voices of [[Don Rickles]], [[Jim Varney]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[John Ratzenberger]], and [[Annie Potts]].
