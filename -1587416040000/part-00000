The town is situated on the [[River Frome, Dorset|River Frome]] eight miles (13&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Poole]].\n\n==Situation and geography==\nThe town is built on a strategic [[dry point]] between the River Frome and the [[River Piddle]] at the head of the Wareham Channel of [[Poole Harbour]]. The Frome Valley runs through an area of unresistant sand, clay and gravel rocks, and much of its valley has wide [[flood plain]]s and [[marsh]] land. At its [[estuary]] the river has formed the wide shallow [[ria]] of Poole Harbour. Wareham is built on a low dry island between the marshy river plains.\n[[File:River Frome - geograph.org.uk - 11551.jpg|thumb|left|River Frome]]\nThe town is situated on the [[A roads in Zone 3 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|A351]] [[Lytchett Minster]]-[[Swanage]] road and at the eastern terminus of the [[A352 road]] to [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] and [[Sherborne]], both roads now [[Bypass route|bypass]]ing the town centre. The town has [[Wareham railway station|a station]] on the [[South Western Main Line]] railway, and was formerly the junction station for services along the branch line to Swanage, now preserved as the [[Swanage Railway]]. The steam railway has ambitions to extend its service, currently from Swanage to Norden, near [[Corfe Castle (village)|Corfe Castle]] back to [[Worgret|Worgret Junction]] (where the mainline and branch divided) and into Wareham again.\n\nTo the north west of the town a large conifer plantation, [[Wareham Forest]] stretches several miles to the [[A35 road]] and the southern foothills of the [[Dorset Downs]]. To the south east is Corfe Castle and the heathland that borders Poole Harbour, including [[Wytch Farm]] oil field and [[Studland]] & Godlingstone Heath [[Nature Reserve]]. About four miles (7&nbsp;km) to the south is a chalk ridge, the [[Purbeck Hills]], and eight miles (12&nbsp;km) to the south is the [[English Channel]].\n\n==Alfie==\nAlfie is the best cat in all of Wareham! Come join the I Heart Alfie group!\n\n==History==\nThe town's strategic setting has made it an important settlement throughout its long history. Excavations at the nearby Bestwall site have produced evidence of transient early [[Mesolithic]] activity dating to around 9000 [[BCE]]. At the same site four large [[Neolithic]] pits containing worked [[flint]] and pottery fragments dating to 3700 BCE were found. Three green stone axeheads discovered also probably date to this period. Flint working and potting continued throughout the [[Bronze Age]]. The first house discovered dates to the mid 15th century BCE.<ref name=\"britarch_bestwall\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba115/feat2.shtml|title=Bestwall Quarry|accessdate=9 January 2011|date=Nov\u2013Dec 2010|first=Lilian|last=Ladle|first2=Ann|last2=Woodward|journal=British Archaeology|issue=115}}</ref>\n[[File:Wareham West Walls.JPG|thumb|left|\"Bloody Bank\" is the high point in the distance, on West Walls]]\nArchaeological evidence exists of a small [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement, though the current town was founded by the [[Saxons]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=9}}</ref> The Roman name is unknown, but the town is referred to as ''Werham'' in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' entry of 784, from [[Old English]] ''wer'' (meaning 'fish trap, a weir') and ''h\u0101m'' ('homestead') or ''hamm'' ('enclosure hemmed in by water').<ref>{{cite book | first1=David | last1=Hill | first2=Alexander R. | last2=Rumble | title=The defence of Wessex: the Burghal Hidage and Anglo-Saxon fortifications | year=1996 | publisher=Manchester University Press | isbn=0-7190-3218-0 | pages=107\u2013108}}</ref>\n[[File:Wareham Lady St Mary Church 2.JPG|thumb|Lady St. Mary Church]]\nThe town's oldest features are the town walls, ancient earth [[defensive wall|ramparts]] surrounding the town, likely built by [[Alfred the Great]] in the 9th century to defend the town from the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]]<ref name=\"Davis 1997 14\">{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=14}}</ref> as part of his system of ''[[burh]]'' towns.

Up until this time Wareham had been an important port; however the growth of Poole and the gradual silting of the river caused a decline in trade and by the end of the 13th century most of the foreign trade had transferred to Poole. Local trade continued to be handled at the Quay until the construction of the railway in the 19th century.<ref name=\"wtc\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=20}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], Wareham changed hands several times between the [[Cavalier|Royalists]] and [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] and in August 1644 was the site of a fierce battle with 2,000 [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] soldiers besieging the town.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=31}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Monmouth Rebellion]] of 1685, Wareham was one of a number of towns in Dorset where [[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys|Judge Jeffreys]] held the [[Bloody Assizes]], with five rebels being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] on the West Walls, an area known as 'Bloody Bank'.<ref name=\"lilianladle_1986\">{{harvnb|Ladle|1986|p=28}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=35}}</ref> This may also have been the site of the execution of a hermit known as Peter de Pomfret who in 1213 had prophesied that before the next [[Ascension Day]] [[John, King of England|King John]]'s rule would be over. The prophecy turned out to be incorrect, and the King decreed that Peter should be dragged through the streets of the town tied to a horse's tail and [[Hanging|hanged]] together with his son.<ref name=\"lilianladle_1986\"/>\n\nIn 1762, a fire destroyed two thirds of the town, which has been rebuilt in [[Georgian architecture]] with red brick and [[Purbeck limestone]], following the earlier street pattern. The town is divided into four quarters by the two main roads, which cross at right-angles. The [[medieval]] [[almshouse]]s escaped the fire, and some of the Georgian fa\u00e7ades are in fact disguising earlier buildings which also survived.\n\nWith the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, Wareham became a [[garrison]] town with up to 7,000 soldiers living and training locally. The camp was re-located to nearby [[Bovington Camp|Bovington]] in 1922.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|pp=85\u201390}}</ref> The town survived the [[Second World War]] largely intact, although five houses were destroyed when a bomb dropped by a [[Luftwaffe|German aeroplane]] fell near St Martin's Church in 1942.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=91}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the constraints of the rivers and marshland Wareham grew little during the 20th century, while nearby towns, such as [[Poole]], grew rapidly.\n\n==Religious sites==\n[[File:Wareham St Martin's Church 2.JPG|thumb|[[St Martin's Church, Wareham]]]]\nWareham contains several places of worship with the oldest being the Saxon churches of Lady St. Mary (substantially modified but the origins are [[Norman conquest of England|pre-conquest]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=11}}</ref> The Saxon nave was demolished in 1841-2) and [[St Martin's Church, Wareham|St. Martins-on-the-Walls]] (built c.1030, dedicated to [[Martin of Tours]]). Both are [[Church of England|Anglican]]. The 14th-century building of Holy Trinity Church stands on the site of the Saxon chapel St Andrew's<ref name=\"Davis 1997 15\"/> and was until 2012 a tourist information centre. Other churches are the Wareham [[United Reformed Church]] in Church Street, St. Edward the Martyr [[Roman Catholic]] church on Shatters Hill, Wareham [[Methodist]] Church in North St. and the [[Evangelical]] Church in Ropers Lane. Sections of the churchyard of Lady St. Mary are managed by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]], containing as it does a number of graves of servicemen who died in a nearby military hospital during the [[First World War]] and others, including those of German and Polish servicemen, from the [[Second World War]].\n\n==Government==\n[[File:Wareham North Street.JPG|thumb|North St.]]\nThe civil parish of Wareham Town encompasses the walled town of Wareham, situated on the land between the rivers Frome and Piddle, together with the area of Northport to the north of the River Piddle, and a relatively small amount of the surrounding rural area.

The town is situated on the [[River Frome, Dorset|River Frome]] eight miles (13&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Poole]].\n\n==Situation and geography==\nThe town is built on a strategic [[dry point]] between the River Frome and the [[River Piddle]] at the head of the Wareham Channel of [[Poole Harbour]]. The Frome Valley runs through an area of unresistant sand, clay and gravel rocks, and much of its valley has wide [[flood plain]]s and [[marsh]] land. At its [[estuary]] the river has formed the wide shallow [[ria]] of Poole Harbour. Wareham is built on a low dry island between the marshy river plains.\n[[File:River Frome - geograph.org.uk - 11551.jpg|thumb|left|River Frome]]\nThe town is situated on the [[A roads in Zone 3 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|A351]] [[Lytchett Minster]]-[[Swanage]] road and at the eastern terminus of the [[A352 road]] to [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] and [[Sherborne]], both roads now [[Bypass route|bypass]]ing the town centre. The town has [[Wareham railway station|a station]] on the [[South Western Main Line]] railway, and was formerly the junction station for services along the branch line to Swanage, now preserved as the [[Swanage Railway]]. The steam railway has ambitions to extend its service, currently from Swanage to Norden, near [[Corfe Castle (village)|Corfe Castle]] back to [[Worgret|Worgret Junction]] (where the mainline and branch divided) and into Wareham again.\n\nTo the north west of the town a large conifer plantation, [[Wareham Forest]] stretches several miles to the [[A35 road]] and the southern foothills of the [[Dorset Downs]]. To the south east is Corfe Castle and the heathland that borders Poole Harbour, including [[Wytch Farm]] oil field and [[Studland]] & Godlingstone Heath [[Nature Reserve]]. About four miles (7&nbsp;km) to the south is a chalk ridge, the [[Purbeck Hills]], and eight miles (12&nbsp;km) to the south is the [[English Channel]].\n\n==History==\nThe town's strategic setting has made it an important settlement throughout its long history. Excavations at the nearby Bestwall site have produced evidence of transient early [[Mesolithic]] activity dating to around 9000 [[BCE]]. At the same site four large [[Neolithic]] pits containing worked [[flint]] and pottery fragments dating to 3700 BCE were found. Three green stone axeheads discovered also probably date to this period. Flint working and potting continued throughout the [[Bronze Age]]. The first house discovered dates to the mid 15th century BCE.<ref name=\"britarch_bestwall\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba115/feat2.shtml|title=Bestwall Quarry|accessdate=9 January 2011|date=Nov\u2013Dec 2010|first=Lilian|last=Ladle|first2=Ann|last2=Woodward|journal=British Archaeology|issue=115}}</ref>\n[[File:Wareham West Walls.JPG|thumb|left|\"Bloody Bank\" is the high point in the distance, on West Walls]]\nArchaeological evidence exists of a small [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement, though the current town was founded by the [[Saxons]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=9}}</ref> The Roman name is unknown, but the town is referred to as ''Werham'' in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' entry of 784, from [[Old English]] ''wer'' (meaning 'fish trap, a weir') and ''h\u0101m'' ('homestead') or ''hamm'' ('enclosure hemmed in by water').<ref>{{cite book | first1=David | last1=Hill | first2=Alexander R. | last2=Rumble | title=The defence of Wessex: the Burghal Hidage and Anglo-Saxon fortifications | year=1996 | publisher=Manchester University Press | isbn=0-7190-3218-0 | pages=107\u2013108}}</ref>\n[[File:Wareham Lady St Mary Church 2.JPG|thumb|Lady St. Mary Church]]\nThe town's oldest features are the town walls, ancient earth [[defensive wall|ramparts]] surrounding the town, likely built by [[Alfred the Great]] in the 9th century to defend the town from the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]]<ref name=\"Davis 1997 14\">{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=14}}</ref> as part of his system of ''[[burh]]'' towns.

Up until this time Wareham had been an important port; however the growth of Poole and the gradual silting of the river caused a decline in trade and by the end of the 13th century most of the foreign trade had transferred to Poole. Local trade continued to be handled at the Quay until the construction of the railway in the 19th century.<ref name=\"wtc\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=20}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], Wareham changed hands several times between the [[Cavalier|Royalists]] and [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] and in August 1644 was the site of a fierce battle with 2,000 [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] soldiers besieging the town.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=31}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Monmouth Rebellion]] of 1685, Wareham was one of a number of towns in Dorset where [[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys|Judge Jeffreys]] held the [[Bloody Assizes]], with five rebels being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] on the West Walls, an area known as 'Bloody Bank'.<ref name=\"lilianladle_1986\">{{harvnb|Ladle|1986|p=28}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=35}}</ref> This may also have been the site of the execution of a hermit known as Peter de Pomfret who in 1213 had prophesied that before the next [[Ascension Day]] [[John, King of England|King John]]'s rule would be over. The prophecy turned out to be incorrect, and the King decreed that Peter should be dragged through the streets of the town tied to a horse's tail and [[Hanging|hanged]] together with his son.<ref name=\"lilianladle_1986\"/>\n\nIn 1762, a fire destroyed two thirds of the town, which has been rebuilt in [[Georgian architecture]] with red brick and [[Purbeck limestone]], following the earlier street pattern. The town is divided into four quarters by the two main roads, which cross at right-angles. The [[medieval]] [[almshouse]]s escaped the fire, and some of the Georgian fa\u00e7ades are in fact disguising earlier buildings which also survived.\n\nWith the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, Wareham became a [[garrison]] town with up to 7,000 soldiers living and training locally. The camp was re-located to nearby [[Bovington Camp|Bovington]] in 1922.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|pp=85\u201390}}</ref> The town survived the [[Second World War]] largely intact, although five houses were destroyed when a bomb dropped by a [[Luftwaffe|German aeroplane]] fell near St Martin's Church in 1942.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=91}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the constraints of the rivers and marshland Wareham grew little during the 20th century, while nearby towns, such as [[Poole]], grew rapidly.\n\n==Religious sites==\n[[File:Wareham St Martin's Church 2.JPG|thumb|[[St Martin's Church, Wareham]]]]\nWareham contains several places of worship with the oldest being the Saxon churches of Lady St. Mary (substantially modified but the origins are [[Norman conquest of England|pre-conquest]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=11}}</ref> The Saxon nave was demolished in 1841-2) and [[St Martin's Church, Wareham|St. Martins-on-the-Walls]] (built c.1030, dedicated to [[Martin of Tours]]). Both are [[Church of England|Anglican]]. The 14th-century building of Holy Trinity Church stands on the site of the Saxon chapel St Andrew's<ref name=\"Davis 1997 15\"/> and was until 2012 a tourist information centre. Other churches are the Wareham [[United Reformed Church]] in Church Street, St. Edward the Martyr [[Roman Catholic]] church on Shatters Hill, Wareham [[Methodist]] Church in North St. and the [[Evangelical]] Church in Ropers Lane. Sections of the churchyard of Lady St. Mary are managed by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]], containing as it does a number of graves of servicemen who died in a nearby military hospital during the [[First World War]] and others, including those of German and Polish servicemen, from the [[Second World War]].\n\n==Government==\n[[File:Wareham North Street.JPG|thumb|North St.]]\nThe civil parish of Wareham Town encompasses the walled town of Wareham, situated on the land between the rivers Frome and Piddle, together with the area of Northport to the north of the River Piddle, and a relatively small amount of the surrounding rural area.

Upon learning that the poor kid is actually lost, the young lady gladly offers to help him go back home. In order to return the said favor, Santino then volunteers to help Libay with her sales; and together they go from town to town asking around for directions towards the small town of Bagong Pag-asa. She was then discovered by her brother, and asked to come home so that she could be with their father.

Upon learning about this said information, Franco instantly claims custody of the said kid; and in order to successfully do so, he tries seeking Mayor Enrique's help. Without hesitation, Enrique gives his full support to Franco's case. He instantly suggests a DNA test; and once the DNA test results prove that Franco is in fact Santino's biological father, the DSWD will then be awarding Santino's custody to him. After Enrique finds out that Franco is not the real father, Enrique decided to have a DNA test. It is then proven that Enrique is Santino's real father, and the DNA sample Franco gave was actually Enrique's. Enrique then decided to back out of the mayoral race in order to spend more time with his children, and gets ready to face corruption charges that may be filed against him after leaving office.

It was later revealed that her friend was Teresa Malimban, a woman connected to the lives of people of Bagong Pag-asa. She found out that her friend had died more than 5 years ago and later decided to search for Teresa's son Gabriel (who is Santino).\n\n===Chapter Thirty-Six: Temptation===\nAfter Enrique's death, Tilde was arrested for being involved in the death of Malena. However, she was able to escape under the pretense of labor; while being driven, she got the gun of Dante, the policeman driving the vehicle. Rico was resentful of Santino because of their father's death. Santino then felt sad as he believes he's bad luck due to the death of Enrique and the anger of Rico; Father Jose told him that he was not the Santino who was trying to be happy despite the hardships and trials. Meanwhile, Santino was being told by a voice (possibly Satan's) that he should come to it and he was cursed by Bro. He ends up being helped by angels on his way and ends up at a home for the homeless, run by Lola Milgaros, a blind grandmother. Meanwhile, a Filipino-Chinese businessman named Mr. Chan is trying to put into action his plan to take the house and the land where it stands for his business expansion. He constantly tries to take the place but also fails. Santino meets Mr. Chan and discovers his ailing daughter whom he heals. Mr. Chan continues to do his pursuit despite his daughter's recovery and also still doesn't believe in God. On one night, Lola Milagros' home is set on fire by arsonists and miracles happen when rain falls and stops the fire. Learning of the incident, Mr. Chan has a change of heart and quits his pursuit by giving Milagros a check of a huge sum of money for repairs and necessities.\n\n*[[Gloria Sevilla]] as Lola Milagros - A blind old woman who is the owner of a home open to homeless people.\n*Jeff Henson Dee as Mr. Chan - a wealthy [[Chinese Filipino]] businessman who is constantly trying to take the house for the homeless as well as the land where it stands. He later helps Milagros after arsonists set fire to her house.\n\n===Chapter Thirty-Seven: Believe===\nA Manila-based journalist named Paulo Pe\u00f1aflor arrives at Bagong Pag-asa to search for news featuring the miracles in the small town. And to his delight, he alone gets his hands on the most sensational news there is, Rico's exclusive encounters with his so-called Bro ''(later revealed as Satan)''. Though a non-believer of such events, Paulo pursues this rather controversial issue for his show's sake. Santino has now returned to Bagong Pag-asa, but his former petty argument with Rico turns out to be a completely heated dispute. Apparently, Santino tries relaying Bro's real message to Rico, which instantly infuriates the latter. Given the rather controversial situation, Paulo then gets another angle for a truly sensational scoop. And to his surprise, the tension is further heightened up by Tilde's hired con-artist. This results in an accident which endangered Stella's life; but fortunately, Santino is around to save her. Meanwhile, detainees in Bagong Pag-asa's jail held the police chief hostage, and ordered all policemen to give them their arms. After the commotion in Bagong Pag-asa Jail ended in a miracle, a group of radicals led by Tilde's con-artist try to get Santino to perform more miracles so they may believe. Their actions however compromise Santino's safety and eventually puts his life in danger. Hearing of this, Paolo rescues Santino ''(who is fleeing from the radicals)'' and makes him stay in a secluded countryside villa he rented for his tenure in Bagong Pag-asa. There he takes care of Santino until it is safe for him to return. In one interview session, Paolo reveals to Santino an event that triggered his loss of faith in Christ; during his tenure as a missionary, the bombing of a chapel built by his congregation resulted in the death of several people and his co-missionaries. In the remains of the chapel, he managed to save a baby which died when he thought Jesus would help it. He threw away his habit and abandoned his vocation in despair. At the monastery, the monks and Mario collaborate with each other to find Santino.\n\n*[[Ryan Agoncillo]] as Paulo Pe\u00f1aflor - A journalist and CBN News Reporter who visits Bagong Pag-asa after hearing about the news of Rico's encounter with \"Bro\". He was a former missionary who abandoned his vocation and lost his faith in Christ.\n\n===Chapter Thirty-Eight: Amen===\nPaolo turns Santino over to Mario and the police chief before going on an errand. As Mario contacts the monks of Santino's safety while driving the latter back to Bagong Pag-asa, Tilde deviously abducts Mario's daughter Joy, and calls Mario to request that Santino be brought to her in exchange for Joy's release. Santino convinces Mario that he would respond to Tilde's request; Mario agreeing unconditionally out of his desperate situation. Although Mario would not be giving Santino to Tilde, the young boy was abducted by Tilde, who asked the former to cure her sickness. Tilde was enraged and locked up Santino in a closet when Santino refused to heal her since he has no more power to cure the sick. Tilde then insistently commands him to lay his miraculous hands on her, but she accidentally pushes Santino off a flight of stairs, causing Santino's head to hit very hard on the floor, thus, causing him to instantly lose his consciousness\u2014just as Rico once predicted. Santino was then hospitalized, but when his chances of survival were declining, the priests then decided to bring his dying body to the monastery. Santino dies in the monastery, and his wish to reunite with his parents was finally granted, though it caused deep grief to everyone. People then flocked to Bagong Pag-asa in order to pay the necessary respects to his remains, while Tilde awaits sentencing for her crimes. During funeral preparations were underway, Santino wakes up alive after he was told by his parents ''(revealed to be Enrique and Teresa)'' in the afterlife that the time for him to be reunited with them has not yet come, and he still needs to continue his mission on Earth, and to be with and protect his half-brother Rico. This miracle was witnessed by Paolo, who saw the young boy sitting alongside Bro. People of Bagong Pag-asa rejoiced upon seeing Santino alive once more. This occurrence brought back Paolo's faith in God, and Santino lives a normal life thereafter. In the end of the series, Paolo gives a narration on what hope for him is and how Santino changed his life, and is now back on his vocation of priesthood after witnessing the miracle.\n\n*[[Charo Santos-Concio]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] - the mother of Bro.

But it\u2019s great to note that the gamble has paid off in a big way: ''May Bukas Pa'' has been enjoying very good ratings, proving what we\u2019ve been saying all this time--that viewers want to be inspired by the dramas they watch..\" However, he criticized the show's \"religious\" scenes which are \"poorly, shallowly staged, thus making genuine inspiration and devotion difficult to come by while viewing the series.\" He further criticized the show's use of extras mostly playing sick people, who turn out to be bad actors. He adds, \"Any director worth his salt would have sensed that the montage of healing needed good actors to make it meaningful and moving. Why were inept actors used instead? Possibly because the production was scrimping on talent fees. Well, it was a penny-wise pound-foolish decision, because the important sequence was botched.\"<ref>[http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090316-194515/May-Bukas-Pa-plus-and-minus \"\u2018May Bukas Pa,\u2019 plus and minus\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320040119/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090316-194515/May-Bukas-Pa-plus-and-minus|date=20 March 2009}} by Nestor Torre, 16 March 2009.</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|rowspan=9| 2009 || 1st MTRCB TV Awards || Special Award for Promoting Moral Values || {{won}}\n|-\n| Seoul International Drama Awards<ref>{{cite web|url=http://telebisyon.net/balita/Cristine-Reyes-attends-Seoul-International-Drama-Awards-Eva-Fonda-wins-Special-Prize/artikulo/73679/|title=Cristine Reyes attends Seoul International Drama Awards; Eva Fonda wins Special Prize|publisher=Telebisyon.net|date=23 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017125820/http://telebisyon.net/balita/Cristine-Reyes-attends-Seoul-International-Drama-Awards-Eva-Fonda-wins-Special-Prize/artikulo/73679/|archivedate=17 October 2012}}</ref> || Best Drama Series ||{{nom}}\n|-\n| Catholic Mass Media Awards || Best Drama (tied with [[Tayong Dalawa]]) || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[ASAP (variety show)|ASAP Pop Viewer's Choice Awards]] || Pop Kapamilya New Face (Zajian Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[ASAP (variety show)|ASAP Pop Viewer's Choice Awards]] || Pop Kapamilya TV Show|| {{nom}}\n|-\n| 18th KBP Golden Dove Awards || Best Primetime Drama Series || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Primetime Drama Series || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Male New TV Personality (Zajian Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Drama Actor (Albert Martinez) || {{nom}}\n|-\n| rowspan=4|2010 || 8th Gawad Tanglaw || Special Jury Award for Television || {{won}}\n|-\n| 8th Gawad Tanglaw || Natatanging Gawad TANGLAW para sa Sining ng Telebisyon (Zaijan Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=2|[[2010 GMMSF Box-Office Entertainment Awards|41st GMMSF Box-Office Entertainment Awards]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=579374&publicationSubCategoryId=70|title=Chiz: Don't extend Pagcor chief's term &#124; Headlines, News, The Philippine Star|publisher=philstar.com|date=20 May 2013|accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref> || TV Program of the Year || {{won}}\n|-\n| TV Directors of the Year (Jojo Saguin and Jerome Pobocan ) || {{won}}\n|}\n\nMay Bukas Pa also received a special award at the 2009 Catholic Mass Media Awards (besides its Best Drama award), given by Cardinal Archbishop [[Gaudencio Rosales]].

Meanwhile, fed up with his parents\u2019 constant warring, Rico suddenly decides to run away. Upon learning this, Santino together with three of his other friends decide to chase him and convince him to go back home. Enrique, the priests and the children's families mistakenly believe the kids were kidnapped. The children then succeed on convincing the boy but they faced trouble on their way back to town. Aside from being lost in the middle of nowhere without food and water, Rico ends up being caught in [[quicksand]]. On Santino's way to help the poor boy out, he too falls in the trap. Their other friends rescued them, but they haven't returned yet to Bagong Pag-asa. It is also revealed that the place they are in is the hideout of insurgents and criminals. The kids then seek help from someone living in the forests, but it turns out that he is a member of the gang, \"Batang Iwahid\" (''Iwahid Kid''). Batang Iwahid is a group of young teenage boys based in the town of San Isidro who rob people and/or kidnap them for ransom. However, they never kill citizens, they are only getting blamed for what the other gangs do. They shoot Enrique while he and the policemen were finding Santino and the other kids; Enrique survives as Santino prays over him while he was with the kidnappers, and the search for the children goes on. Some of the other children were able to be rescued, but Santino was still being held captive. It seems that the rebel group's leader, Froilan, has a special income generating plan for the child. Upon learning this, Enrique hassles the authorities\u2019 search and rescue operation, in order to save their town's hailed child, and promote his political agenda as well. On the other hand, Malena runs out of town with her son Rico to get Enrique, and her growing love for him, out of her mind once and for all, which immediately infuriates the latter.

During Enrique's visit with Rico and Santino, Malena grows inevitably furious. Enraged in anger, she persistently exclaims that Enrique is the one responsible for all her mishaps.

Though a non-believer of such events, Paulo pursues this rather controversial issue for his show's sake. Santino has now returned to Bagong Pag-asa, but his former petty argument with Rico turns out to be a completely heated dispute. Apparently, Santino tries relaying Bro's real message to Rico, which instantly infuriates the latter. Given the rather controversial situation, Paulo then gets another angle for a truly sensational scoop. And to his surprise, the tension is further heightened up by Tilde's hired con-artist. This results in an accident which endangered Stella's life; but fortunately, Santino is around to save her. Meanwhile, detainees in Bagong Pag-asa's jail held the police chief hostage, and ordered all policemen to give them their arms. After the commotion in Bagong Pag-asa Jail ended in a miracle, a group of radicals led by Tilde's con-artist try to get Santino to perform more miracles so they may believe.

There he takes care of Santino until it is safe for him to return. In one interview session, Paolo reveals to Santino an event that triggered his loss of faith in Christ; during his tenure as a missionary, the bombing of a chapel built by his congregation resulted in the death of several people and his co-missionaries.

As Mario contacts the monks of Santino's safety while driving the latter back to Bagong Pag-asa, Tilde deviously abducts Mario's daughter Joy, and calls Mario to request that Santino be brought to her in exchange for Joy's release. Santino convinces Mario that he would respond to Tilde's request; Mario agreeing unconditionally out of his desperate situation. Although Mario would not be giving Santino to Tilde, the young boy was abducted by Tilde, who asked the former to cure her sickness. Tilde was enraged and locked up Santino in a closet when Santino refused to heal her since he has no more power to cure the sick. Tilde then insistently commands him to lay his miraculous hands on her, but she accidentally pushes Santino off a flight of stairs, causing Santino's head to hit very hard on the floor, thus, causing him to instantly lose his consciousness\u2014just as Rico once predicted. Santino was then hospitalized, but when his chances of survival were declining, the priests then decided to bring his dying body to the monastery. Santino dies in the monastery, and his wish to reunite with his parents was finally granted, though it caused deep grief to everyone. People then flocked to Bagong Pag-asa in order to pay the necessary respects to his remains, while Tilde awaits sentencing for her crimes. During funeral preparations were underway, Santino wakes up alive after he was told by his parents ''(revealed to be Enrique and Teresa)'' in the afterlife that the time for him to be reunited with them has not yet come, and he still needs to continue his mission on Earth, and to be with and protect his half-brother Rico. This miracle was witnessed by Paolo, who saw the young boy sitting alongside Bro. People of Bagong Pag-asa rejoiced upon seeing Santino alive once more.

But it\u2019s great to note that the gamble has paid off in a big way: ''May Bukas Pa'' has been enjoying very good ratings, proving what we\u2019ve been saying all this time--that viewers want to be inspired by the dramas they watch..\" However, he criticized the show's \"religious\" scenes which are \"poorly, shallowly staged, thus making genuine inspiration and devotion difficult to come by while viewing the series.\" He further criticized the show's use of extras mostly playing sick people, who turn out to be bad actors. He adds, \"Any director worth his salt would have sensed that the montage of healing needed good actors to make it meaningful and moving. Why were inept actors used instead? Possibly because the production was scrimping on talent fees. Well, it was a penny-wise pound-foolish decision, because the important sequence was botched.\"<ref>[http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090316-194515/May-Bukas-Pa-plus-and-minus \"\u2018May Bukas Pa,\u2019 plus and minus\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320040119/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090316-194515/May-Bukas-Pa-plus-and-minus|date=20 March 2009}} by Nestor Torre, 16 March 2009.</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|rowspan=9| 2009 || 1st MTRCB TV Awards || Special Award for Promoting Moral Values || {{won}}\n|-\n| Seoul International Drama Awards<ref>{{cite web|url=http://telebisyon.net/balita/Cristine-Reyes-attends-Seoul-International-Drama-Awards-Eva-Fonda-wins-Special-Prize/artikulo/73679/|title=Cristine Reyes attends Seoul International Drama Awards; Eva Fonda wins Special Prize|publisher=Telebisyon.net|date=23 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017125820/http://telebisyon.net/balita/Cristine-Reyes-attends-Seoul-International-Drama-Awards-Eva-Fonda-wins-Special-Prize/artikulo/73679/|archivedate=17 October 2012}}</ref> || Best Drama Series ||{{nom}}\n|-\n| Catholic Mass Media Awards || Best Drama (tied with [[Tayong Dalawa]]) || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[ASAP (variety show)|ASAP Pop Viewer's Choice Awards]] || Pop Kapamilya New Face (Zajian Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[ASAP (variety show)|ASAP Pop Viewer's Choice Awards]] || Pop Kapamilya TV Show|| {{nom}}\n|-\n| 18th KBP Golden Dove Awards || Best Primetime Drama Series || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Primetime Drama Series || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Male New TV Personality (Zajian Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Drama Actor (Albert Martinez) || {{nom}}\n|-\n| rowspan=4|2010 || 8th Gawad Tanglaw || Special Jury Award for Television || {{won}}\n|-\n| 8th Gawad Tanglaw || Natatanging Gawad TANGLAW para sa Sining ng Telebisyon (Zaijan Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=2|[[2010 GMMSF Box-Office Entertainment Awards|41st GMMSF Box-Office Entertainment Awards]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=579374&publicationSubCategoryId=70|title=Chiz: Don't extend Pagcor chief's term &#124; Headlines, News, The Philippine Star|publisher=philstar.com|date=20 May 2013|accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref> || TV Program of the Year || {{won}}\n|-\n| TV Directors of the Year (Jojo Saguin and Jerome Pobocan ) || {{won}}\n|}\n\nMay Bukas Pa also received a special award at the 2009 Catholic Mass Media Awards (besides its Best Drama award), given by Cardinal Archbishop [[Gaudencio Rosales]].

Informally known as the '''Houses of Parliament''' after its occupants, the Palace lies on the north bank of the [[River Thames]] in the [[City of Westminster]], in [[central London]], [[England]].\n\nIts name, which derives from the neighbouring [[Westminster Abbey]], may refer to either of two structures: the ''Old Palace'', a [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] building-complex [[Burning of Parliament|destroyed by fire in 1834]], or its replacement, the ''New Palace'' that stands today. The palace is owned by the monarch in right of [[the Crown]] and, for ceremonial purposes, retains its original status as a royal residence. Committees appointed by both houses manage the building and report to the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] and to the [[Lord Speaker]].\n\nThe first royal palace constructed on the site dated from the 11th&nbsp;century, and Westminster became the primary residence of the [[List of English monarchs|Kings of England]] until fire destroyed much of the complex in 1512. After that, it served as the home of the [[Parliament of England]], which had met there since the 13th&nbsp;century, and also as the seat of the [[Royal Courts of Justice]], based in and around [[#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]]. In 1834 an even greater fire ravaged the heavily rebuilt Houses of Parliament, and the only significant medieval structures to survive were Westminster Hall, the Cloisters of St Stephen's, the [[Chapel of St Mary Undercroft]], and the [[Jewel Tower]].\n\nIn the subsequent competition for the reconstruction of the Palace, the architect [[Charles Barry]] won with a design for new buildings in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, specifically inspired by the English [[Perpendicular Gothic]] style of the 14th\u201316th centuries. The remains of the Old Palace (except the detached Jewel Tower) were incorporated into its much larger replacement, which contains over 1,100 rooms organised symmetrically around two series of courtyards and which has a floor area of {{convert|112,476|m2|ft2|abbr= on}}.<ref name=\"restorationandrenewal.parliament.uk\"/> Part of the New Palace's area of {{Convert|3.24|ha|0}} was reclaimed from the [[River Thames]], which is the setting of its nearly {{convert|300|m|ft|adj= mid|long}} fa\u00e7ade,<ref name=\"restorationandrenewal.parliament.uk\"/> called the River Front. [[Augustus Pugin]], a leading authority on Gothic architecture and style, assisted Barry and  designed the interior of the Palace. Construction started in 1840 and lasted for 30 years, suffering great delays and cost overruns, as well as the death of both leading architects; works for the interior decoration continued intermittently well into the 20th&nbsp;century. Major conservation work has taken place since then to reverse the effects of London's [[air pollution]], and extensive repairs followed the Second World War, including the reconstruction of the Commons Chamber following its bombing in 1941.\n\nThe Palace is one of the centres of [[Politics of the United Kingdom|political life in the United Kingdom]]; \"Westminster\" has become a [[metonym]] for the UK Parliament and the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]], and the [[Westminster system]] of government commemorates the name of the palace. The Elizabeth Tower, in particular, often referred to by the name of its main bell, [[Big Ben]], has become an iconic landmark of London and of the United Kingdom in general, one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city, and an emblem of parliamentary democracy. Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] of Russia called the new palace \"a dream in stone\".<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Boyne\n | first1 = Harry\n | author-link1 = \n | title = The Houses of Parliament\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JjUMAQAAMAAJ\n | publisher = Larousse\n | date = 1981\n | page = 23\n | isbn = 9780883322598\n | access-date = 19 March 2019\n | quote = Tsar Nicholas I of Russia called it ''un reve en pierre'' (a dream in stone), and that is the romantic impression it must have created upon many millions of sightseers.\n}}\n</ref><ref name = helmguardian>\n{{Cite news\n|url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/14/secret-report-palace-westminster-grave-risk-fire-saftey\n|title= Parliament burned down 183 years ago.

Barry was a [[Classical architecture|classical architect]], but he was aided by the Gothic architect [[Augustus Pugin]]. Westminster Hall, which was built in the 11th century and survived the fire of 1834, was incorporated in Barry's design.

However, the stone soon began to decay due to pollution and the poor quality of some of the stone used.

In 1928 it was deemed necessary to use [[Clipsham stone]], a honey-coloured limestone from [[Rutland]], to replace the decayed Anston. The project began in the 1930s but was halted by the outbreak of the Second World War, and completed only during the 1950s. By the 1960s pollution had again begun to take its toll.

The architect conceived the great square tower as the [[keep]] of a legislative \"castle\" (echoing his selection of the [[portcullis]] as his identifying mark in the planning competition), and used it as the royal entrance to the Palace and as a fireproof repository for the archives of Parliament.<ref>[[#Quinault|Quinault (1991)]], p. 81; [[#Jones|Jones (1983)]], p. 113.</ref> Victoria Tower was re-designed several times, and its height increased progressively;<ref>[[#Port|Port (1976)]], pp. 76, 109; [[#Riding|Riding and Riding (2000)]], p. 116.</ref> upon its completion in 1858, it was <!-- the second-tallest building in London (after [[St Paul's Cathedral]]) and --> the tallest secular building in the world.<ref>[[#Quinault|Quinault (1991)]], p. 81.</ref>\n\nAt the base of the tower is the Sovereign's Entrance, used by the monarch whenever entering the Palace to [[State Opening of Parliament|open Parliament]] or for other state occasions.

For example, Crace decorated and gilded the ceiling of the Chapel of St. Mary Undercroft.<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/worksofart/artwork/edward-m-barry/houses-of-parliament-st-stephen%27s-crypt-restored--about-1863-/1601 Art in Parliament]: ''Houses of Parliament, St Stephen's Crypt (Restored)''.</ref>\n\n=== Layout ===\n\n[[File:Palace of Westminster plan, F.

The Sovereign's Entrance, at the base of the Victoria Tower, is located in the south-west corner of the Palace and is the starting point of the royal procession route, the suite of ceremonial rooms used by the monarch at [[State Opening of Parliament|State Openings of Parliament]]. This consists of the Royal Staircase, the Norman Porch, the Robing Room, the Royal Gallery and the Prince's Chamber, and culminates in the Lords Chamber, where the ceremony takes place. Members of the House of Lords use the Peers' Entrance in the middle of the Old Palace Yard front, which is covered by a stone [[carriage porch]] and opens to an entrance hall. A staircase from there leads, through a corridor, to the Prince's Chamber.<ref name=\"Guide, p. 28\">[[#Guide|''Guide to the Palace of Westminster'']], p. 28.</ref>\n\nMembers of Parliament enter their part of the building from the Members' Entrance in the south side of New Palace Yard. Their route passes through a cloakroom in the lower level of the Cloisters and eventually reaches the Members' Lobby directly south of the Commons Chamber. From New Palace Yard, access can also be gained to the Speaker's Court and the main entrance of the Speaker's House, located in the pavilion at the north-east corner of the Palace\n\nSt Stephen's Entrance, roughly in the middle of the building's western front, is the entrance for members of the public.

They are the work of [[Richard Burchett]] and his pupils, and their creation entailed extensive research, which contributed to the founding of the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] in 1856. 12 bronze bas-reliefs are set into the wall below the portraits, executed by [[William Theed]] in 1855\u20131857.<ref name=\"Lords Route tour\"/> Scenes included are ''The [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]]'', ''The Escape of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]'' and ''[[Walter Raleigh|Raleigh]] Spreading His Cloak As a Carpet for the Queen''.<ref>[[#Guide|''Guide to the Palace of Westminster'']], pp. 32\u201333.</ref> Above the portraits, at window level, there are compartments intended for copies of six of the ten [[Armada tapestries]], which hung in the chamber of the House of Lords until their destruction in the 1834 fire and depicted the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588.

The lavishly decorated room measures {{Convert|13.7|by|24.4|m|ft|0}}.<ref name=\"Factsheet G11\"/> The benches in the Chamber, as well as other furnishings in the Lords' side of the Palace, are coloured red. The upper part of the Chamber is decorated by stained glass windows and by six allegorical frescoes representing religion, chivalry and law.\n\nAt the south end of the Chamber are the ornate gold Canopy and Throne; although the Sovereign may theoretically occupy the Throne during any sitting, he or she attends only the State Opening of Parliament. Other members of the Royal Family who attend the State Opening use Chairs of State next to the Throne, and peers' sons are always entitled to sit on the steps of the Throne. In front of the Throne is the [[Woolsack]], an armless red cushion stuffed with [[wool]], representing the historical importance of the wool trade, and used by the officer presiding over the House (the [[Lord Speaker]] since 2006, but historically the [[Lord Chancellor]] or a deputy). The House's [[Ceremonial mace|mace]], which represents royal authority, is placed on the back of the Woolsack. In front of the Woolsack is the Judges' Woolsack, a larger red cushion that used to be occupied during the State Opening by the [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lords]] (who were members of the House of Lords), and prospectively by the Supreme Court Justices and other Judges (whether or not members), to represent the Judicial Branch of Government. The Table of the House, at which the clerks sit, is in front.\n\nMembers of the House occupy red benches on three sides of the Chamber. The benches on the Lord Speaker's right form the Spiritual Side and those to his left form the Temporal Side. The [[Lords Spiritual]] (archbishops and bishops of the established [[Church of England]]) all occupy the Spiritual Side. The [[Lords Temporal]] ([[Peerage|nobles]]) sit according to party affiliation: members of the Government party sit on the Spiritual Side, while those of the Opposition sit on the Temporal Side. Some peers, who have no party affiliation, sit on the benches in the middle of the House opposite the Woolsack; they are accordingly known as [[crossbencher]]s.\n\n[[File:Passing of the Parliament Bill, 1911 - Project Gutenberg eText 19609.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Drawing|The passage of the [[Parliament Act 1911]]. Votes in both Houses of Parliament are conducted in the form of [[Division of the assembly|divisions]].]]\n\nThe Lords Chamber is the site of nationally televised ceremonies, the most important of which is the [[State Opening of Parliament]], which is held formally to open each annual parliamentary session, either after a General Election or in the autumn. At this occasion every constitutional element of the government is represented: the Crown (both literally, and figuratively in the person of the Sovereign), The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and The Commons, (who together form the Legislature), the Judiciary (although no judges are members of either House of Parliament), and the Executive (both [[Minister of the Crown|Government Ministers]], and ceremonial military units in attendance on the Sovereign); and a large number of guests are invited to attend in the large Royal Gallery immediately outside the Chamber. The Sovereign, seated on the Throne, delivers the [[Speech from the Throne]], outlining the Government's programme for the year and legislative agenda for the forthcoming parliamentary session. The Commons may not enter the Lords' debating floor; instead, they watch the proceedings from beyond the Bar of the House, just inside the door. A small purely formal ceremony is held to end each parliamentary session, when the Sovereign is merely represented by a group of [[Lords Commissioners]].\n\nFollowing the Blitz, which destroyed the chamber of the House of Commons, the Lords' chamber was occupied by the Commons. The Lords temporarily used the Robing Room during the reconstruction. The State Opening Of Parliament was carried out as normal, with the new rooms being used. Evidence can still be seen of this today, with damage clearly visible on one of the doors where they were struck by Black Rod.\n\n=== Peers' Lobby ===\n\nDirectly north of the Lords Chamber lies the Peers' Lobby, an [[antechamber]] where Lords can informally discuss or negotiate matters during sittings of the House, as well as collect messages from the [[Doorkeeper (Houses of Parliament)|doorkeepers]], who control access to the Chamber. The Lobby is a square room measuring {{Convert|12|m|ft}} on each side and {{Convert|10|m|ft}} in height,<ref name=\"Factsheet G11\"/> and one of its main features is the floor centrepiece, a radiant Tudor rose made of Derbyshire marbles and set within an octagon of engraved brass plates.<ref>[[#Wilson|Wilson (2005)]], p. 16.</ref> The rest of the floor is paved with encaustic tiles featuring heraldic designs and Latin mottoes.

[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. Informally known as the '''Houses of Parliament''' after its occupants, the Palace lies on the north bank of the [[River Thames]] in the [[City of Westminster]], in [[central London]], [[England]].\n\nIts name, which derives from the neighbouring [[Westminster Abbey]], may refer to either of two structures: the ''Old Palace'', a [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] building-complex [[Burning of Parliament|destroyed by fire in 1834]], or its replacement, the ''New Palace'' that stands today. The palace is owned by the monarch in right of [[the Crown]] and, for ceremonial purposes, retains its original status as a royal residence. Committees appointed by both houses manage the building and report to the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] and to the [[Lord Speaker]].\n\nThe first royal palace constructed on the site dated from the 11th&nbsp;century, and Westminster became the primary residence of the [[List of English monarchs|Kings of England]] until fire destroyed much of the complex in 1512. After that, it served as the home of the [[Parliament of England]], which had met there since the 13th&nbsp;century, and also as the seat of the [[Royal Courts of Justice]], based in and around [[#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]]. In 1834 an even greater fire ravaged the heavily rebuilt Houses of Parliament, and the only significant medieval structures to survive were Westminster Hall, the Cloisters of St Stephen's, the [[Chapel of St Mary Undercroft]], and the [[Jewel Tower]].\n\nIn the subsequent competition for the reconstruction of the Palace, the architect [[Charles Barry]] won with a design for new buildings in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, specifically inspired by the English [[Perpendicular Gothic]] style of the 14th\u201316th centuries. The remains of the Old Palace (except the detached Jewel Tower) were incorporated into its much larger replacement, which contains over 1,100 rooms organised symmetrically around two series of courtyards and which has a floor area of {{convert|112,476|m2|ft2|abbr= on}}.<ref name=\"restorationandrenewal.parliament.uk\"/> Part of the New Palace's area of {{Convert|3.24|ha|0}} was reclaimed from the [[River Thames]], which is the setting of its nearly {{convert|300|m|ft|adj= mid|long}} fa\u00e7ade,<ref name=\"restorationandrenewal.parliament.uk\"/> called the River Front. [[Augustus Pugin]], a leading authority on Gothic architecture and style, assisted Barry and  designed the interior of the Palace. Construction started in 1840 and lasted for 30 years, suffering great delays and cost overruns, as well as the death of both leading architects; works for the interior decoration continued intermittently well into the 20th&nbsp;century. Major conservation work has taken place since then to reverse the effects of London's [[air pollution]], and extensive repairs followed the Second World War, including the reconstruction of the Commons Chamber following its bombing in 1941.\n\nThe Palace is one of the centres of [[Politics of the United Kingdom|political life in the United Kingdom]]; \"Westminster\" has become a [[metonym]] for the UK Parliament and the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]], and the [[Westminster system]] of government commemorates the name of the palace. The Elizabeth Tower, in particular, often referred to by the name of its main bell, [[Big Ben]], has become an iconic landmark of London and of the United Kingdom in general, one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city, and an emblem of parliamentary democracy. Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] of Russia called the new palace \"a dream in stone\".<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Boyne\n | first1 = Harry\n | author-link1 = \n | title = The Houses of Parliament\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JjUMAQAAMAAJ\n | publisher = Larousse\n | date = 1981\n | page = 23\n | isbn = 9780883322598\n | access-date = 19 March 2019\n | quote = Tsar Nicholas I of Russia called it ''un reve en pierre'' (a dream in stone), and that is the romantic impression it must have created upon many millions of sightseers.\n}}\n</ref><ref name = helmguardian>\n{{Cite news\n|url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/14/secret-report-palace-westminster-grave-risk-fire-saftey\n|title= Parliament burned down 183 years ago.

Soane's ceremonial entrance is on the far-right.\n }}\nThe Palace of Westminster site was strategically important during the [[Middle Ages]], as it was located on the banks of the [[River Thames]]. Known in medieval times as [[Thorney Island (London)|Thorney Island]], the site may have been first-used for a royal residence by [[Canute the Great]] during his reign from 1016 to 1035. [[Edward the Confessor|St Edward the Confessor]], the penultimate Anglo-Saxon monarch of England, built a royal palace on Thorney Island just west of the [[City of London]] at about the same time as he built [[Westminster Abbey]] (1045\u20131050). Thorney Island and the surrounding area soon became known as Westminster (a contraction of the words ''West [[Minster (church)|Minster]]''). Neither the buildings used by the Anglo-Saxons nor those used by William&nbsp;I survive. The oldest existing part of the Palace (Westminster Hall) dates from the reign of William&nbsp;I's successor, [[William II of England|King William&nbsp;II]].\n\nThe Palace of Westminster was the monarch's principal residence in the late Medieval period. The predecessor of Parliament, the ''[[Curia Regis]]'' (Royal Council), met in Westminster Hall (although it followed the King when he moved to other palaces). [[Montfort's Parliament|Simon de Montfort's parliament]], the first to include representatives of the major towns, met at the Palace in 1265. The \"[[Model Parliament]]\", the first official Parliament of England, met there in 1295,<ref name=\"Factsheet G03\">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g03.pdf |title=A Brief Chronology of the House of Commons |date=April 2009 |publisher=House of Commons Information Office |accessdate=5 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623010012/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g03.pdf |archivedate=23 June 2015 |df= }}</ref> and almost all subsequent English Parliaments and then, after 1707, all British Parliaments have met at the Palace.\n\n[[File:A Panoramic View of London, from the Tower of St. Margaret's Church, Westminster (detail 04, Palace of Westminster).jpg|thumb|Detail from ''[[A Panoramic View of London, from the Tower of St. Margaret's Church, Westminster]]'' (1815) by [[Pierre Pr\u00e9vost]], showing the Palace of Westminster.

Renaming it the Palace of Whitehall, Henry used it as his principal residence. Although Westminster officially remained a royal palace, it was used by the two Houses of Parliament and by the various royal law courts.\n\n[[File:John Roque map detail, Palace of Westminster.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|alt=The Old Palace was a complex of buildings, separated from the River Thames in the east by a series of gardens. The largest and northernmost building is Westminster Hall, which lies parallel to the river. Several buildings adjoin it on the east side; south of those and perpendicular to the Hall is the mediaeval House of Commons. Further south and parallel to the river is the Court of Requests, with an eastwards extension at its south end, and at the south end of the complex lie the House of Lords and another chamber. The Palace was bounded by St Margaret's Street to the west and Old Palace Yard to the south-west; another street, New Palace Yard, is just visible to the north.|A detail from [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746|John Rocque's 1746 map of London]]. [[St Stephen's Chapel]], labelled \"H of Comm\" (House of Commons), was adjacent to Westminster Hall; the Parliament Chamber\u2014labelled \"H of L\" (House of Lords)\u2014and the Prince's Chamber were to the far south. The Court of Requests, between the two Houses, would become the new home of the Lords in 1801. At the north-east, by the river, stood Speaker's House.]]\n\nBecause it was originally a royal residence, the Palace included no purpose-built chambers for the two Houses. Important state ceremonies were held in the [[Painted Chamber]] which had been originally built in the 13th century as the main bedchamber for [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]]. In 1801 the Upper House moved into the larger [[White Chamber]] (also known as the Lesser Hall), which had housed the [[Court of Requests]]; the expansion of the Peerage by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] during the 18th century, along with the imminent [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union with Ireland]], necessitated the move, as the original chamber could not accommodate the increased number of peers.\n\nThe House of Commons, which did not have a chamber of its own, sometimes held its debates in the Chapter House of Westminster Abbey. The Commons acquired a permanent home at the Palace in [[St Stephen's Chapel]], the former chapel of the royal palace, during the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. In 1547 the building became available for the Commons' use following the disbanding of St Stephen's College. Alterations were made to St Stephen's Chapel over the following three centuries for the convenience of the lower House, gradually destroying, or covering up, its original mediaeval appearance. A major renovation project undertaken by [[Christopher Wren]] in the late 17th century completely redesigned the building's interior.\n\nThe Palace of Westminster as a whole began to see significant alterations from the 18th century onwards, as Parliament struggled to carry out its business in the limited available space and ageing buildings. Calls for an entirely new palace went unheeded as instead more buildings of varying quality and style were added. A new west fa\u00e7ade, known as the Stone Building, facing onto St Margaret's Street was designed by [[John Vardy]] built in the Palladian style between 1755 and 1770, providing more space for document storage and committee rooms. The House of Commons Engrossing Office of Robert Gunnell (1724\u20131794) and Edward Barwell was on the lower floor beside the corner tower at the west side of Vardy's western fa\u00e7ade. A new official residence for the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] was built adjoining St Stephen's Chapel and completed in 1795. The [[neo-Gothic]] architect [[James Wyatt]] also carried out works on both the House of Lords and Commons between 1799 and 1801, including alterations to the exterior of St Stephen's Chapel and a much-derided new neo-Gothic building, referred to by Wyatt's critics as \"The Cotton Mill\" adjoining the House of Lords and facing onto Old Palace Yard.\n\nThe palace complex was substantially remodelled, this time by [[John Soane|Sir John Soane]], between 1824 and 1827. The medieval House of Lords chamber, which had been the target of the failed [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605, was demolished as part of this work in order to create a new Royal Gallery and ceremonial entrance at the southern end of the palace. Soane's work at the palace also included new library facilities for both Houses of Parliament and new law courts for the [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]] and [[Court of King's Bench (England)|King's Bench]]. Soane's alterations caused controversy owing to his use of [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] architectural styles, which conflicted with the Gothic style of the original buildings.\n\n=== Fire and reconstruction ===\n\n{{main|Burning of Parliament}}\n[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner, English - The Burning of the Houses of Lords and Commons, October 16, 1834 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Painting|[[J.

In the resulting conflagration both Houses of Parliament were destroyed, along with most of the other buildings in the palace complex.

They are the work of [[Richard Burchett]] and his pupils, and their creation entailed extensive research, which contributed to the founding of the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] in 1856. 12 bronze bas-reliefs are set into the wall below the portraits, executed by [[William Theed]] in 1855\u20131857.<ref name=\"Lords Route tour\"/> Scenes included are ''The [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]]'', ''The Escape of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]'' and ''[[Walter Raleigh|Raleigh]] Spreading His Cloak As a Carpet for the Queen''.<ref>[[#Guide|''Guide to the Palace of Westminster'']], pp. 32\u201333.</ref> Above the portraits, at window level, there are compartments intended for copies of six of the ten [[Armada tapestries]], which hung in the chamber of the House of Lords until their destruction in the 1834 fire and depicted the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588.

The lavishly decorated room measures {{Convert|13.7|by|24.4|m|ft|0}}.<ref name=\"Factsheet G11\"/> The benches in the Chamber, as well as other furnishings in the Lords' side of the Palace, are coloured red. The upper part of the Chamber is decorated by stained glass windows and by six allegorical frescoes representing religion, chivalry and law.\n\nAt the south end of the Chamber are the ornate gold Canopy and Throne; although the Sovereign may theoretically occupy the Throne during any sitting, he or she attends only the State Opening of Parliament. Other members of the Royal Family who attend the State Opening use Chairs of State next to the Throne, and peers' sons are always entitled to sit on the steps of the Throne. In front of the Throne is the [[Woolsack]], an armless red cushion stuffed with [[wool]], representing the historical importance of the wool trade, and used by the officer presiding over the House (the [[Lord Speaker]] since 2006, but historically the [[Lord Chancellor]] or a deputy). The House's [[Ceremonial mace|mace]], which represents royal authority, is placed on the back of the Woolsack. In front of the Woolsack is the Judges' Woolsack, a larger red cushion that used to be occupied during the State Opening by the [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lords]] (who were members of the House of Lords), and prospectively by the Supreme Court Justices and other Judges (whether or not members), to represent the Judicial Branch of Government. The Table of the House, at which the clerks sit, is in front.\n\nMembers of the House occupy red benches on three sides of the Chamber. The benches on the Lord Speaker's right form the Spiritual Side and those to his left form the Temporal Side. The [[Lords Spiritual]] (archbishops and bishops of the established [[Church of England]]) all occupy the Spiritual Side. The [[Lords Temporal]] ([[Peerage|nobles]]) sit according to party affiliation: members of the Government party sit on the Spiritual Side, while those of the Opposition sit on the Temporal Side. Some peers, who have no party affiliation, sit on the benches in the middle of the House opposite the Woolsack; they are accordingly known as [[crossbencher]]s.\n\n[[File:Passing of the Parliament Bill, 1911 - Project Gutenberg eText 19609.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Drawing|The passage of the [[Parliament Act 1911]]. Votes in both Houses of Parliament are conducted in the form of [[Division of the assembly|divisions]].]]\n\nThe Lords Chamber is the site of nationally televised ceremonies, the most important of which is the [[State Opening of Parliament]], which is held formally to open each annual parliamentary session, either after a General Election or in the autumn. At this occasion every constitutional element of the government is represented: the Crown (both literally, and figuratively in the person of the Sovereign), The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and The Commons, (who together form the Legislature), the Judiciary (although no judges are members of either House of Parliament), and the Executive (both [[Minister of the Crown|Government Ministers]], and ceremonial military units in attendance on the Sovereign); and a large number of guests are invited to attend in the large Royal Gallery immediately outside the Chamber. The Sovereign, seated on the Throne, delivers the [[Speech from the Throne]], outlining the Government's programme for the year and legislative agenda for the forthcoming parliamentary session. The Commons may not enter the Lords' debating floor; instead, they watch the proceedings from beyond the Bar of the House, just inside the door. A small purely formal ceremony is held to end each parliamentary session, when the Sovereign is merely represented by a group of [[Lords Commissioners]].\n\nFollowing the Blitz, which destroyed the chamber of the House of Commons, the Lords' chamber was occupied by the Commons. The Lords temporarily used the Robing Room during the reconstruction. The State Opening Of Parliament was carried out as normal, with the new rooms being used. Evidence can still be seen of this today, with damage clearly visible on one of the doors where they were struck by Black Rod.\n\n=== Peers' Lobby ===\n\nDirectly north of the Lords Chamber lies the Peers' Lobby, an [[antechamber]] where Lords can informally discuss or negotiate matters during sittings of the House, as well as collect messages from the [[Doorkeeper (Houses of Parliament)|doorkeepers]], who control access to the Chamber. The Lobby is a square room measuring {{Convert|12|m|ft}} on each side and {{Convert|10|m|ft}} in height,<ref name=\"Factsheet G11\"/> and one of its main features is the floor centrepiece, a radiant Tudor rose made of Derbyshire marbles and set within an octagon of engraved brass plates.<ref>[[#Wilson|Wilson (2005)]], p. 16.</ref> The rest of the floor is paved with encaustic tiles featuring heraldic designs and Latin mottoes.

To this end, they placed large quantities of gunpowder beneath the House of Lords, which one of the conspirators, Guy Fawkes, would detonate during the State Opening of Parliament on 5 November 1605. If successful, the explosion would have destroyed the Palace, killing the King, his family and most of the aristocracy.

Defensively, he recorded 110 tackles and returned two interceptions for scores. In 1999, Alexander was a ''[[Denver Post]]'' \"Blue Chip\" selection, named to the ''[[Colorado Springs Gazette-Telegraph]]'' 's All-Area team, selected to the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' ' all-state squad and was an honorable mention pick on ''[[USA Today]]'' 's All-USA team.

The name is derived from ''(t)ape (ar)chive'', as it was originally developed to write data to sequential [[Input/output|I/O]] devices with no file system of their own. The archive data sets created by tar contain various [[file system]] parameters, such as name, time stamps, ownership, file access permissions, and  [[Directory (computing)|directory]] organization.  The command line utility was first introduced in the [[Version 7 Unix]] in January 1979, replacing the tp program.<ref name=\"tar5\">{{cite web |url=https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tar&apropos=0&sektion=5&manpath=FreeBSD+7.0-RELEASE&arch=default&format=html |title=tar(5) manual page |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=20 May 2004 |website=freebsd.org |publisher=FreeBSD |access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref>  The [[file format|file structure]] to store this information was standardized in [[POSIX]].1-1988<ref>''IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and later POSIX.1-2001,<ref>IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, ''IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and became a format supported by most modern file archiving systems.\n\n==Rationale==\nMany historic tape drives read and write variable-length data blocks, leaving significant wasted space on the tape between blocks (for the tape to physically start and stop moving).  Some tape drives (and raw disks) support only fixed-length data blocks.  Also, when writing to any medium such as a filesystem or network, it takes less time to write one large block than many small blocks.  Therefore, the tar command writes data in blocks of many 512 byte records.  The user can specify a blocking factor, which is the number of records per block; the default is 20, producing 10 kilobyte blocks.<ref>[http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/tar/html_node/tar_130.html \"Blocking'\"] ''ftp.gnu.org''. Retrieved 28 November 2013.</ref>\n\n==File format==\nA tar archive consists of a series of file objects, hence the popular term ''tarball'', referencing how a [[tarball (oil)|tarball]]  collects objects of all kinds that stick to its surface.  Each file object includes any file data, and is preceded by a 512-byte [[Header (computing)|header]] record.  The file data is written unaltered except that its length is rounded up to a multiple of 512 bytes. The original tar implementation did not care about the contents of the padding bytes, and left the buffer data unaltered, but most modern tar implementations fill the extra space with zeros.<ref name = \"Hoo, e7z Org., 2015\" > {{ Cite web | url = http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | title = Open/Extract TAR File with Freeware on Windows/Mac/Linux | access-date = 2019-09-03 | first = James | last = Hoo | website = e7z Org. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150206035752/http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | archive-date = 2015-02-06 | df = dmy-all }} </ref> The end of an archive is marked by at least two consecutive zero-filled records.  (The origin of tar's record size appears to be the 512-byte disk sectors used in the Version 7 Unix file system.) The final block of an archive is padded out to full length with zeros.\n\n===Header===\nThe file header record contains [[metadata]] about a file.  To ensure portability across different architectures with different [[Endianness|byte orderings]], the information in the header record is encoded in [[ASCII]].  Thus if all the files in an archive are ASCII text files, and have ASCII names, then the archive is essentially an ASCII text file (containing many [[Null character|NUL characters]]).\n\nThe fields defined by the original Unix tar format are listed in the table below.  The link indicator/file type table includes some modern extensions.  When a field is unused it is filled with NUL bytes.  The header uses 257 bytes, then is padded with NUL bytes to make it fill a 512 byte record.  There is no \"magic number\" in the header, for file identification.\n\nPre-POSIX.1-1988 (i.e. v7) tar header:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|100\n|File name\n|-\n|100\n|8\n|File mode\n|-\n|108\n|8\n|Owner's numeric user ID\n|-\n|116\n|8\n|Group's numeric user ID\n|-\n|124\n|12\n|File size in bytes (octal base)\n|-\n|136\n|12\n|Last modification time in numeric Unix time format (octal)\n|-\n|148\n|8\n|Checksum for header record\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Link indicator (file type)\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|Name of linked file\n|}\n\nThe pre-POSIX.1-1988 '''Link indicator''' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Link indicator field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|}\n\nSome pre-POSIX.1-1988 tar implementations indicated a directory by having a trailing [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] (/) in the name.\n\nNumeric values are encoded in [[octal]] numbers using ASCII digits, with leading zeroes.  For historical reasons, a final [[Null character|NUL]] or [[Space (punctuation)|space]] character should also be used. Thus although there are 12 bytes reserved for storing the file size, only 11 octal digits can be stored.  This gives a maximum file size of 8 [[gigabyte]]s on archived files.  To overcome this limitation, [[#Key implementations|star]] in 2001 introduced a base-256 coding that is indicated by setting the high-order bit of the leftmost byte of a numeric field. GNU-tar and BSD-tar followed this idea. Additionally, versions of tar from before the first POSIX standard from 1988 pad the values with spaces instead of zeroes.\n\nThe [[checksum]] is calculated by taking the sum of the unsigned byte values of the header record ''with the eight checksum bytes taken to be ascii spaces'' (decimal value 32).  It is stored as a six digit octal number with leading zeroes followed by a NUL and then a space. Various implementations do not adhere to this format. For better compatibility, ignore leading and trailing whitespace, and take the first six digits. In addition, some historic tar implementations treated bytes as signed. Implementations typically calculate the checksum both ways, and treat it as good if either the signed or unsigned sum matches the included checksum.\n\nUnix filesystems support multiple links (names) for the same file.  If several such files appear in a tar archive, only the first one is archived as a normal file; the rest are archived as hard links, with the \"name of linked file\" field set to the first one's name.  On extraction, such hard links should be recreated in the file system.\n\n===UStar format===\nMost modern tar programs read and write archives in the UStar (''Unix Standard TAR''<ref name=\"tar5\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Kientzle |first=Tim |date=1995 |title=Internet File Formats |publisher=Coriolis Groups Books |isbn=978-1-883577-56-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/mac_Internet_File_Formats_1995 |access-date=12 December 2015}}</ref>) format, introduced by the POSIX IEEE P1003.1 standard from 1988.  It introduced additional header fields.  Older tar programs will ignore the extra information (possibly extracting partially named files), while newer programs will test for the presence of the \"ustar\" string to determine if the new format is in use.  The UStar format allows for longer file names and stores additional information about each file.  The maximum filename size is 256, but it is split among a preceding path \"filename prefix\" and the filename itself, so can be much less.<ref name=\"gnu.org\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_68.html |title = GNU tar 1.32: 8.1 Using Less Space through Compression | date = 2019-02-23 | website = GNU | access-date = 2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|156\n|''(several fields, same as in old format)''\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Type flag\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|''(same field as in old format)''\n|-\n|257\n|6\n|UStar indicator \"ustar\" then NUL\n|-\n|263\n|2\n|UStar version \"00\"\n|-\n|265\n|32\n|Owner user name\n|-\n|297\n|32\n|Owner group name\n|-\n|329\n|8\n|Device major number\n|-\n|337\n|8\n|Device minor number\n|-\n|345\n|155\n|Filename prefix\n|}\n\nThe ''type flag'' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Type flag field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|-\n|'3'\n|[[Device file|Character special]]\n|-\n|'4'\n|[[Device file|Block special]]\n|-\n|'5'\n|[[Directory (computing)|Directory]]\n|-\n|'6'\n|[[Named pipe|FIFO]]\n|-\n| '7'\n| Contiguous file\n|-\n| 'g'\n| global extended header with meta data (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'x'\n| extended header with meta data for the next file in the archive (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'A'\u2013'Z'\n| Vendor specific extensions (POSIX.1-1988)\n|-\n| All other values\n| reserved for future standardization\n|}\n\nPOSIX.1-1988 vendor specific extensions using link flag values 'A'..'Z' partially have a different meaning with different vendors and thus are seen outdated and replaced by the POSIX.1-2001 extensions that also include a vendor tag.\n\nType '7' (Contiguous file) is formally marked as reserved in the POSIX standard, but was meant to indicate files which ought to be contiguously allocated on disk. Few operating systems support creating such files explicitly, and hence most TAR programs do not support them, and will treat type 7 files as if they were type 0 (regular). An exception is older versions of GNU tar, when running on the [[MASSCOMP]] RTU (Real Time Unix) operating system, which supported an O_CTG flag to the open() function to request a contiguous file; however, that support was removed from GNU tar version 1.24 onwards.\n\n===POSIX.1-2001/pax===\nIn 1997, [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] proposed a method for adding extensions to the tar format. This method was later accepted for the POSIX.1-2001 standard. This format is known as ''extended tar'' format or [[pax (Unix)|pax]]  format. The new tar format allows users to add any type of vendor-tagged vendor-specific enhancements. The following enhancement tags are defined by the POSIX standard:\n\n* all three time stamps of a file in arbitrary resolution (most implementations use nanosecond granularity)\n* path names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* symlink target names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* user and group names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* files with unlimited size (the historic tar format is 8 GB)\n* userid and groupid without size limitation (this historic tar format was is limited to a max. id of 2097151)\n* a character set definition for path names and user/group names\n\nIn 2001, the Star program became the first tar to support the new format. In 2004, GNU tar supported the new format, though it does not write them as its default output from the tar program yet.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\nIt's designed so that all implementations able to read the UStar format will be able to read POSIX.1-2001 as well. The only exceptions are files that make use of extended features, such as longer file names. For compatibility, these are encoded in the tar files as special {{code|x}} or {{code|g}} type files. typically under a {{code|PaxHeaders.XXXX}} directory.<ref>{{man|1|pax|SUS}}</ref>{{rp|exthdr.name}} A Pax-supporting implementation would make use of the info, while non supporting ones like [[7-Zip]] would process them as extra files.<ref>{{cite web |title=#2116 Tars with pax headers not parsed |url=https://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/bugs/2116/ |website=7-Zip / Bugs | SourceForge}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n=== Command syntax ===\n tar [-options] <name of the tar archive> [files or directories which to add into archive]\nBasic options:\n* <code>-c, --create</code> \u2014 create a new archive;\n* <code>-a, --auto-compress</code>  \u2014 additionally compress the archive with a compressor which will be automatically determined by the file name extension of the archive. If the archive's name ends with {{code|*.tar.gz}} then use [[gzip]], if {{code|*.tar.xz}} then use [[XZ Utils|xz]], {{code|*.tar.zst}} for [[Zstandard]] etc.;\n* <code>-r, --append</code> \u2014 append files to the end of an archive;\n* <code>-x, --extract, --get</code> \u2014 extract files from an archive;\n* <code>-f, --file</code> \u2014 specify the archive's name;\n* <code>-t, --list</code> \u2014 show a list of files and folders in the archive;\n* <code>-v, --verbose</code> \u2014 show a list of processed files.\n\n=== Basic usage ===\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}}:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cvf archive.tar README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar\n</source>\n\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar.gz}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}} and compress it with [[gzip]] :\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cavf archive.tar.gz README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar.gz}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar.gz\n</source>\n\n===Tarpipe===\nA tarpipe is the method of creating an archive on the [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]] file of the tar utility and piping it to another tar process on its [[Standard streams#Standard input (stdin)|standard input]], working in another directory, where it is unpacked.  This process copies an entire source directory tree including all special files, for example:\n tar cf - ''srcdir'' | tar x -C ''destdir''\n\n===Software distribution===\nThe tar format continues to be used extensively for [[Open-source model|open-source]] [[software distribution]].  *NIX-distributions use features prominently in various source- and binary-package distribution mechanisms, with most software [[source code]] made available in [[gzip]] compressed tar archives (.tar.gz, .tpz or .tgz file suffix).\n\n==Limitations==\nThe original tar format was created in the early days of UNIX, and despite current widespread use, many of its design features are considered dated.<ref>[http://duplicity.nongnu.org/new_format.html Proposed format to replace tar, by the Duplicity utility's developers.]</ref>\n\nMany older tar implementations do not record nor restore extended attributes (xattrs) or [[Access control list|ACL]]s. In 2001, [[#Key implementations|Star]] introduced support for ACLs and extended attributes, through its own extensions.  Bsdtar uses the star extensions to support ACLs.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} More recent versions of GNU tar support Linux extended attributes,<ref name = \"Les bons comptes, 2014\" > {{ Cite web | url = http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | title = Extended attributes: the good, the not so good, the bad. | access-date = 2019-09-03 | date = 2014-07-15 | website = Les bons comptes | quote = The extended attributes can be very valuable for storing file metadata (e.g. author&#61;&#34;John Smith&#34;, subject&#61;&#34;country landscape&#34;), in the many cases where you do not want or can\u2019t store this data in the file internal properties. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141214001530/http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | archive-date = 2014-12-14  | df = dmy-all }} </ref> reimplementing star extensions. Other formats have been created to address the shortcomings of tar.\n\n===Operating system support===\n[[Unix-like]] operating systems usually include tools to support tar files, as well as utilities commonly used to compress them, such as [[gzip]] and [[bzip2]]. BSD-tar has been included in [[Microsoft Windows]] since [[Windows 10 version history|Windows 10 April 2018 Update]]<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 17063 for PC\n |url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/12/19/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17063-pc/\n |website=Windows Experience Blog\n |accessdate=2 July 2018\n|date=2017-12-19\n }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Containers/Tar-and-Curl-Come-to-Windows/ba-p/382409 | title=Tar and Curl Come to Windows!| date=2019-03-22}}</ref>, and there are otherwise multiple third party tools available to read and write these formats on Windows.\n\n===Tarbomb===\n{{redirect-distinguish|Tarbomb|zip bomb}}\nA '''tarbomb''', in [[Jargon File|hacker slang]], is a tar file that contains many files that extract into the working directory. Such a tar file can create problems by overwriting files of the same name in the working directory, or mixing one project's files into another. It is at best an inconvenience to the user, who is obliged to identify and delete a number of files interspersed with the directory's other contents. Such behavior is considered bad etiquette on the part of the archive's creator.\n\nA related problem is the use of [[Path (computing)|absolute path]]s or [[Directory (computing)|parent directory]] references when creating tar files. Files extracted from such archives will often be created in unusual locations outside the working directory and, like a tarbomb, have the potential to overwrite existing files. However, modern versions of FreeBSD and GNU tar do not create or extract absolute paths and parent-directory references by default, unless it is explicitly allowed with the flag {{code|-P}} or the option {{code|--absolute-names}}. The bsdtar program, which is also available on many operating systems and is the default tar utility on [[macOS|Mac OS X]] v10.6, also does not follow parent-directory references or symbolic links.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/bsdtar.1.html Man page for \"bsdtar\", as provided by Apple.]</ref>\n\nIf a user has only a very old tar available, which does not feature those security measures, these problems can be mitigated by first examining a tar file using the command <code>tar tf archive.tar</code>, which lists the contents and allows to exclude problematic files afterwards.\n\nThese commands do not extract any files, but display the names of all files in the archive. If any are problematic, the user can create a new empty directory and extract the archive into it\u2014or avoid the tar file entirely. Most graphical tools can display the contents of the archive before extracting them. [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] can open tar archives and display their contents. [[GNU Emacs]] is also able to open a tar archive and display its contents in a [[dired]] buffer.\n\n===Random access===\nThe tar format was designed without a centralized index or table of content for files and their properties for streaming to tape backup devices. The archive must be read sequentially to list or extract files. For large tar archives, this causes a performance penalty, making tar archives unsuitable for situations that often require random access to individual files.\n\n===Duplicates===\nAnother issue with tar format is that it allows several (possibly different) files in archive to have identical path and filename. When extracting such archive, usually the latter version of a file overwrites the former.\n\nThis can create a non-explicit (unobvious) tarbomb, which technically does not contain files with absolute paths or referring parent directories, but still causes overwriting files outside current directory (for example, archive may contain two files with the same path and filename, first of which is a [[symbolic link|symlink]] to some location outside current directory, and second of which is a regular file; then extracting such archive on some tar implementations may cause writing to the location pointed to by the symlink).\n\n==Key implementations==\n<!-- Implementations included with major unixoid OS only. No general archivers that can just \"also\" do tar - they probably just include libarchive included here. -->\n\nHistorically, many systems have implemented tar, and many [[Comparison of file archivers|general file archivers]] have at least partial support for tar (often using one of the implementations below). The history of tar is a story of incompatibilities, known as the \"tar wars\". Most tar implementations can also read and create [[cpio]] and [[pax (Unix)|pax]] (the latter actually is a ''tar''-format with [[POSIX]]-2001-extensions).\n\nKey implementations in order of origin:\n\n* '''[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] tar''', based on the original UNIX V7 tar <!-- is this correct? --> and comes as the default on the Solaris operating system\n* '''[[GNU]] tar''' is the default on most [[Linux]] distributions. It is based on the public domain implementation pdtar which started in 1987. Recent versions can use various formats, including ustar, pax, GNU and v7 formats.\n* '''[[FreeBSD]] tar''' (also '''BSD tar''') has become the default tar on most [[Berkeley Software Distribution]]-based operating systems including [[macOS|Mac OS X]]. The core functionality is available as '''libarchive''' for inclusion in other applications.  This implementation automatically detects the format of the file and can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar, ar, xar, rpm and ISO 9660 cdrom images. It also comes with a functionally equivalent cpio command-line interface.\n* '''Schily tar''', better known as '''star''', is historically significant as some of its extensions were quite popular. It is the oldest [[free software|free]] tar from 1982. It is still maintained.<ref>{{man|1|star|ManKier}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, most [[Pax (Unix)|pax]] and [[cpio]] implementations can read and create many types of tar files.\n\n==Suffixes for compressed files==\n''tar'' archive files usually have the file suffix ''.tar'', e.g., ''somefile.tar''.\n\nA tar archive file contains uncompressed byte streams of the files which it contains. To achieve archive compression, a variety of [[data compression|compression]] programs are available, such as [[gzip]], [[bzip2]], [[XZ Utils|xz]], [[lzip]], [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|lzma]], [[Zstandard|zstd]], or [[compress]], which compress the entire tar archive. Typically, the compressed form of the archive receives a filename by appending the format-specific compressor suffix to the archive file name. For example, a tar archive ''archive.tar'', is named ''archive.tar.gz'', when it is compressed by gzip.\n\nPopular tar programs like the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] and [[GNU]] versions of tar support the [[Command-line interface|command line options]] ''Z'' (compress), ''z'' (gzip), and ''j'' (bzip2) to compress or decompress the archive file upon creation or unpacking. [[GNU]] tar from version 1.20 onwards also supports the option ''--lzma'' ([[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|LZMA]]). 1.21 added support for [[lzop]] with ''--lzop''. 1.22 added support for [[XZ Utils|xz]] with ''--xz'' or ''-J''. 1.23 added support for [[lzip]] with ''--lzip''. 1.31 added support for [[Zstandard|zstd]] with ''--zstd''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2019-01/msg00001.html | title = tar-1.31 released [stable] | last = Poznyakoff | first = Sergey | date = 2019-01-02 | website = GNU mailing lists | access-date = 2019-08-06}}</ref> The decompression of these formats is handled automatically if supported filename extensions are used, and compression is handled automatically using the same filename extensions if the option ''--auto-compress'' (short form ''-a'') is passed to an applicable version of GNU tar.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\n[[MS-DOS]]'s [[8.3 filename]] limitations resulted in additional conventions for naming compressed tar archives. (This practice has declined with [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] offering [[Long filename|long filenames]].)\n\n[[Image:Targzip.svg|thumb|400px|Tar archiving is often used together with a compression method, such as [[gzip]], to create a compressed archive.

The name is derived from ''(t)ape (ar)chive'', as it was originally developed to write data to sequential [[Input/output|I/O]] devices with no file system of their own. The archive data sets created by tar contain various [[file system]] parameters, such as name, time stamps, ownership, file access permissions, and  [[Directory (computing)|directory]] organization.  The command line utility was first introduced in the [[Version 7 Unix]] in January 1979, replacing the tp program.<ref name=\"tar5\">{{cite web |url=https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tar&apropos=0&sektion=5&manpath=FreeBSD+7.0-RELEASE&arch=default&format=html |title=tar(5) manual page |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=20 May 2004 |website=freebsd.org |publisher=FreeBSD |access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref>  The [[file format|file structure]] to store this information was standardized in [[POSIX]].1-1988<ref>''IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and later POSIX.1-2001,<ref>IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, ''IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and became a format supported by most modern file archiving systems.\n\n==Rationale==\nMany historic tape drives read and write variable-length data blocks, leaving significant wasted space on the tape between blocks (for the tape to physically start and stop moving).  Some tape drives (and raw disks) support only fixed-length data blocks.  Also, when writing to any medium such as a filesystem or network, it takes less time to write one large block than many small blocks.  Therefore, the tar command writes data in blocks of many 512 byte records.  The user can specify a blocking factor, which is the number of records per block; the default is 20, producing 10 kilobyte blocks.<ref>[http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/tar/html_node/tar_130.html \"Blocking'\"] ''ftp.gnu.org''. Retrieved 28 November 2013.</ref>\n\n==File format==\nA tar archive consists of a series of file objects, hence the popular term ''tarball'', referencing how a [[tarball (oil)|tarball]]  collects objects of all kinds that stick to its surface.  Each file object includes any file data, and is preceded by a 512-byte [[Header (computing)|header]] record.  The file data is written unaltered except that its length is rounded up to a multiple of 512 bytes. The original tar implementation did not care about the contents of the padding bytes, and left the buffer data unaltered, but most modern tar implementations fill the extra space with zeros.<ref name = \"Hoo, e7z Org., 2015\" > {{ Cite web | url = http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | title = Open/Extract TAR File with Freeware on Windows/Mac/Linux | access-date = 2019-09-03 | first = James | last = Hoo | website = e7z Org. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150206035752/http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | archive-date = 2015-02-06 | df = dmy-all }} </ref> The end of an archive is marked by at least two consecutive zero-filled records.  (The origin of tar's record size appears to be the 512-byte disk sectors used in the Version 7 Unix file system.) The final block of an archive is padded out to full length with zeros.\n\n===Header===\nThe file header record contains [[metadata]] about a file.  To ensure portability across different architectures with different [[Endianness|byte orderings]], the information in the header record is encoded in [[ASCII]].  Thus if all the files in an archive are ASCII text files, and have ASCII names, then the archive is essentially an ASCII text file (containing many [[Null character|NUL characters]]).\n\nThe fields defined by the original Unix tar format are listed in the table below.  The link indicator/file type table includes some modern extensions.  When a field is unused it is filled with NUL bytes.  The header uses 257 bytes, then is padded with NUL bytes to make it fill a 512 byte record.  There is no \"magic number\" in the header, for file identification.\n\nPre-POSIX.1-1988 (i.e. v7) tar header:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|100\n|File name\n|-\n|100\n|8\n|File mode\n|-\n|108\n|8\n|Owner's numeric user ID\n|-\n|116\n|8\n|Group's numeric user ID\n|-\n|124\n|12\n|File size in bytes (octal base)\n|-\n|136\n|12\n|Last modification time in numeric Unix time format (octal)\n|-\n|148\n|8\n|Checksum for header record\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Link indicator (file type)\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|Name of linked file\n|}\n\nThe pre-POSIX.1-1988 '''Link indicator''' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Link indicator field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|}\n\nSome pre-POSIX.1-1988 tar implementations indicated a directory by having a trailing [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] (/) in the name.\n\nNumeric values are encoded in [[octal]] numbers using ASCII digits, with leading zeroes.  For historical reasons, a final [[Null character|NUL]] or [[Space (punctuation)|space]] character should also be used. Thus although there are 12 bytes reserved for storing the file size, only 11 octal digits can be stored.  This gives a maximum file size of 8 [[gigabyte]]s on archived files.  To overcome this limitation, [[#Key implementations|star]] in 2001 introduced a base-256 coding that is indicated by setting the high-order bit of the leftmost byte of a numeric field. GNU-tar and BSD-tar followed this idea. Additionally, versions of tar from before the first POSIX standard from 1988 pad the values with spaces instead of zeroes.\n\nThe [[checksum]] is calculated by taking the sum of the unsigned byte values of the header record ''with the eight checksum bytes taken to be ascii spaces'' (decimal value 32).  It is stored as a six digit octal number with leading zeroes followed by a NUL and then a space. Various implementations do not adhere to this format. For better compatibility, ignore leading and trailing whitespace, and take the first six digits. In addition, some historic tar implementations treated bytes as signed. Implementations typically calculate the checksum both ways, and treat it as good if either the signed or unsigned sum matches the included checksum.\n\nUnix filesystems support multiple links (names) for the same file.  If several such files appear in a tar archive, only the first one is archived as a normal file; the rest are archived as hard links, with the \"name of linked file\" field set to the first one's name.  On extraction, such hard links should be recreated in the file system.\n\n===UStar format===\nMost modern tar programs read and write archives in the UStar (''Unix Standard TAR''<ref name=\"tar5\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Kientzle |first=Tim |date=1995 |title=Internet File Formats |publisher=Coriolis Groups Books |isbn=978-1-883577-56-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/mac_Internet_File_Formats_1995 |access-date=12 December 2015}}</ref>) format, introduced by the POSIX IEEE P1003.1 standard from 1988.  It introduced additional header fields.  Older tar programs will ignore the extra information (possibly extracting partially named files), while newer programs will test for the presence of the \"ustar\" string to determine if the new format is in use.  The UStar format allows for longer file names and stores additional information about each file.  The maximum filename size is 256, but it is split among a preceding path \"filename prefix\" and the filename itself, so can be much less.<ref name=\"gnu.org\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_68.html |title = GNU tar 1.32: 8.1 Using Less Space through Compression | date = 2019-02-23 | website = GNU | access-date = 2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|156\n|''(several fields, same as in old format)''\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Type flag\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|''(same field as in old format)''\n|-\n|257\n|6\n|UStar indicator \"ustar\" then NUL\n|-\n|263\n|2\n|UStar version \"00\"\n|-\n|265\n|32\n|Owner user name\n|-\n|297\n|32\n|Owner group name\n|-\n|329\n|8\n|Device major number\n|-\n|337\n|8\n|Device minor number\n|-\n|345\n|155\n|Filename prefix\n|}\n\nThe ''type flag'' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Type flag field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|-\n|'3'\n|[[Device file|Character special]]\n|-\n|'4'\n|[[Device file|Block special]]\n|-\n|'5'\n|[[Directory (computing)|Directory]]\n|-\n|'6'\n|[[Named pipe|FIFO]]\n|-\n| '7'\n| Contiguous file\n|-\n| 'g'\n| global extended header with meta data (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'x'\n| extended header with meta data for the next file in the archive (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'A'\u2013'Z'\n| Vendor specific extensions (POSIX.1-1988)\n|-\n| All other values\n| reserved for future standardization\n|}\n\nPOSIX.1-1988 vendor specific extensions using link flag values 'A'..'Z' partially have a different meaning with different vendors and thus are seen outdated and replaced by the POSIX.1-2001 extensions that also include a vendor tag.\n\nType '7' (Contiguous file) is formally marked as reserved in the POSIX standard, but was meant to indicate files which ought to be contiguously allocated on disk. Few operating systems support creating such files explicitly, and hence most TAR programs do not support them, and will treat type 7 files as if they were type 0 (regular). An exception is older versions of GNU tar, when running on the [[MASSCOMP]] RTU (Real Time Unix) operating system, which supported an O_CTG flag to the open() function to request a contiguous file; however, that support was removed from GNU tar version 1.24 onwards.\n\n===POSIX.1-2001/pax===\nIn 1997, [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] proposed a method for adding extensions to the tar format. This method was later accepted for the POSIX.1-2001 standard. This format is known as ''extended tar'' format or [[pax (Unix)|pax]]  format. The new tar format allows users to add any type of vendor-tagged vendor-specific enhancements. The following enhancement tags are defined by the POSIX standard:\n\n* all three time stamps of a file in arbitrary resolution (most implementations use nanosecond granularity)\n* path names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* symlink target names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* user and group names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* files with unlimited size (the historic tar format is 8 GB)\n* userid and groupid without size limitation (this historic tar format was is limited to a max. id of 2097151)\n* a character set definition for path names and user/group names\n\nIn 2001, the Star program became the first tar to support the new format. In 2004, GNU tar supported the new format, though it does not write them as its default output from the tar program yet.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\nIt's designed so that all implementations able to read the UStar format will be able to read POSIX.1-2001 as well. The only exceptions are files that make use of extended features, such as longer file names. For compatibility, these are encoded in the tar files as special {{code|x}} or {{code|g}} type files. typically under a {{code|PaxHeaders.XXXX}} directory.<ref>{{man|1|pax|SUS}}</ref>{{rp|exthdr.name}} A Pax-supporting implementation would make use of the info, while non supporting ones like [[7-Zip]] would process them as extra files.<ref>{{cite web |title=#2116 Tars with pax headers not parsed |url=https://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/bugs/2116/ |website=7-Zip / Bugs | SourceForge}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n=== Command syntax ===\n tar [-options] <name of the tar archive> [files or directories which to add into archive]\nBasic options:\n* <code>-c, --create</code> \u2014 create a new archive;\n* <code>-a, --auto-compress</code>  \u2014 additionally compress the archive with a compressor which will be automatically determined by the file name extension of the archive. If the archive's name ends with {{code|*.tar.gz}} then use [[gzip]], if {{code|*.tar.xz}} then use [[XZ Utils|xz]], {{code|*.tar.zst}} for [[Zstandard]] etc.;\n* <code>-r, --append</code> \u2014 append files to the end of an archive;\n* <code>-x, --extract, --get</code> \u2014 extract files from an archive;\n* <code>-f, --file</code> \u2014 specify the archive's name;\n* <code>-t, --list</code> \u2014 show a list of files and folders in the archive;\n* <code>-v, --verbose</code> \u2014 show a list of processed files.\n\n=== Basic usage ===\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}}:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cvf archive.tar README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar\n</source>\n\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar.gz}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}} and compress it with [[gzip]] :\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cavf archive.tar.gz README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar.gz}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar.gz\n</source>\n\n===Tarpipe===\nA tarpipe is the method of creating an archive on the [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]] file of the tar utility and piping it to another tar process on its [[Standard streams#Standard input (stdin)|standard input]], working in another directory, where it is unpacked.  This process copies an entire source directory tree including all special files, for example:\n tar cf - ''srcdir'' | tar x -C ''destdir''\n\n===Software distribution===\nThe tar format continues to be used extensively for [[Open-source model|open-source]] [[software distribution]].  *NIX-distributions use features prominently in various source- and binary-package distribution mechanisms, with most software [[source code]] made available in [[gzip]] compressed tar archives (.tar.gz, .tpz or .tgz file suffix).\n\n==Limitations==\nThe original tar format was created in the early days of UNIX, and despite current widespread use, many of its design features are considered dated.<ref>[http://duplicity.nongnu.org/new_format.html Proposed format to replace tar, by the Duplicity utility's developers.]</ref>\n\nMany older tar implementations do not record nor restore extended attributes (xattrs) or [[Access control list|ACL]]s. In 2001, [[#Key implementations|Star]] introduced support for ACLs and extended attributes, through its own extensions.  Bsdtar uses the star extensions to support ACLs.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} More recent versions of GNU tar support Linux extended attributes,<ref name = \"Les bons comptes, 2014\" > {{ Cite web | url = http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | title = Extended attributes: the good, the not so good, the bad. | access-date = 2019-09-03 | date = 2014-07-15 | website = Les bons comptes | quote = The extended attributes can be very valuable for storing file metadata (e.g. author&#61;&#34;John Smith&#34;, subject&#61;&#34;country landscape&#34;), in the many cases where you do not want or can\u2019t store this data in the file internal properties. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141214001530/http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | archive-date = 2014-12-14  | df = dmy-all }} </ref> reimplementing star extensions. Other formats have been created to address the shortcomings of tar.\n\n===Operating system support===\n[[Unix-like]] operating systems usually include tools to support tar files, as well as utilities commonly used to compress them, such as [[gzip]] and [[bzip2]]. BSD-tar has been included in [[Microsoft Windows]] since [[Windows 10 version history|Windows 10 April 2018 Update]]<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 17063 for PC\n |url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/12/19/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17063-pc/\n |website=Windows Experience Blog\n |accessdate=2 July 2018\n|date=2017-12-19\n }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Containers/Tar-and-Curl-Come-to-Windows/ba-p/382409 | title=Tar and Curl Come to Windows!| date=2019-03-22}}</ref>, and there are otherwise multiple third party tools available to read and write these formats on Windows.\n\n===Tarbomb===\n{{redirect-distinguish|Tarbomb|zip bomb}}\nA '''tarbomb''', in [[Jargon File|hacker slang]], is a tar file that contains many files that extract into the working directory. Such a tar file can create problems by overwriting files of the same name in the working directory, or mixing one project's files into another. It is at best an inconvenience to the user, who is obliged to identify and delete a number of files interspersed with the directory's other contents. Such behavior is considered bad etiquette on the part of the archive's creator.\n\nA related problem is the use of [[Path (computing)|absolute path]]s or [[Directory (computing)|parent directory]] references when creating tar files. Files extracted from such archives will often be created in unusual locations outside the working directory and, like a tarbomb, have the potential to overwrite existing files. However, modern versions of FreeBSD and GNU tar do not create or extract absolute paths and parent-directory references by default, unless it is explicitly allowed with the flag {{code|-P}} or the option {{code|--absolute-names}}. The bsdtar program, which is also available on many operating systems and is the default tar utility on [[macOS|Mac OS X]] v10.6, also does not follow parent-directory references or symbolic links.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/bsdtar.1.html Man page for \"bsdtar\", as provided by Apple.]</ref>\n\nIf a user has only a very old tar available, which does not feature those security measures, these problems can be mitigated by first examining a tar file using the command <code>tar tf archive.tar</code>, which lists the contents and allows to exclude problematic files afterwards.\n\nThese commands do not extract any files, but display the names of all files in the archive. If any are problematic, the user can create a new empty directory and extract the archive into it\u2014or avoid the tar file entirely. Most graphical tools can display the contents of the archive before extracting them. [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] can open tar archives and display their contents. [[GNU Emacs]] is also able to open a tar archive and display its contents in a [[dired]] buffer.\n\n===Random access===\nThe tar format was designed without a centralized index or table of content for files and their properties for streaming to tape backup devices. The archive must be read sequentially to list or extract files. For large tar archives, this causes a performance penalty, making tar archives unsuitable for situations that often require random access to individual files.\n\n===Duplicates===\nAnother issue with tar format is that it allows several (possibly different) files in archive to have identical path and filename. When extracting such archive, usually the latter version of a file overwrites the former.\n\nThis can create a non-explicit (unobvious) tarbomb, which technically does not contain files with absolute paths or referring parent directories, but still causes overwriting files outside current directory (for example, archive may contain two files with the same path and filename, first of which is a [[symbolic link|symlink]] to some location outside current directory, and second of which is a regular file; then extracting such archive on some tar implementations may cause writing to the location pointed to by the symlink).\n\n==Key implementations==\n<!-- Implementations included with major unixoid OS only. No general archivers that can just \"also\" do tar - they probably just include libarchive included here. -->\n\nHistorically, many systems have implemented tar, and many [[Comparison of file archivers|general file archivers]] have at least partial support for tar (often using one of the implementations below). The history of tar is a story of incompatibilities, known as the \"tar wars\". Most tar implementations can also read and create [[cpio]] and [[pax (Unix)|pax]] (the latter actually is a ''tar''-format with [[POSIX]]-2001-extensions).\n\nKey implementations in order of origin:\n\n* '''[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] tar''', based on the original UNIX V7 tar <!-- is this correct? --> and comes as the default on the Solaris operating system\n* '''[[GNU]] tar''' is the default on most [[Linux]] distributions. It is based on the public domain implementation pdtar which started in 1987. Recent versions can use various formats, including ustar, pax, GNU and v7 formats.\n* '''[[FreeBSD]] tar''' (also '''BSD tar''') has become the default tar on most [[Berkeley Software Distribution]]-based operating systems including [[macOS|Mac OS X]]. The core functionality is available as '''libarchive''' for inclusion in other applications.  This implementation automatically detects the format of the file and can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar, ar, xar, rpm and ISO 9660 cdrom images. It also comes with a functionally equivalent cpio command-line interface.\n* '''Schily tar''', better known as '''star''', is historically significant as some of its extensions were quite popular.<ref>{{man|1|star|ManKier}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, most [[Pax (Unix)|pax]] and [[cpio]] implementations can read and create many types of tar files.\n\n==Suffixes for compressed files==\n''tar'' archive files usually have the file suffix ''.tar'', e.g., ''somefile.tar''.\n\nA tar archive file contains uncompressed byte streams of the files which it contains. To achieve archive compression, a variety of [[data compression|compression]] programs are available, such as [[gzip]], [[bzip2]], [[XZ Utils|xz]], [[lzip]], [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|lzma]], [[Zstandard|zstd]], or [[compress]], which compress the entire tar archive. Typically, the compressed form of the archive receives a filename by appending the format-specific compressor suffix to the archive file name. For example, a tar archive ''archive.tar'', is named ''archive.tar.gz'', when it is compressed by gzip.\n\nPopular tar programs like the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] and [[GNU]] versions of tar support the [[Command-line interface|command line options]] ''Z'' (compress), ''z'' (gzip), and ''j'' (bzip2) to compress or decompress the archive file upon creation or unpacking. [[GNU]] tar from version 1.20 onwards also supports the option ''--lzma'' ([[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|LZMA]]). 1.21 added support for [[lzop]] with ''--lzop''. 1.22 added support for [[XZ Utils|xz]] with ''--xz'' or ''-J''. 1.23 added support for [[lzip]] with ''--lzip''. 1.31 added support for [[Zstandard|zstd]] with ''--zstd''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2019-01/msg00001.html | title = tar-1.31 released [stable] | last = Poznyakoff | first = Sergey | date = 2019-01-02 | website = GNU mailing lists | access-date = 2019-08-06}}</ref> The decompression of these formats is handled automatically if supported filename extensions are used, and compression is handled automatically using the same filename extensions if the option ''--auto-compress'' (short form ''-a'') is passed to an applicable version of GNU tar.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\n[[MS-DOS]]'s [[8.3 filename]] limitations resulted in additional conventions for naming compressed tar archives. (This practice has declined with [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] offering [[Long filename|long filenames]].)\n\n[[Image:Targzip.svg|thumb|400px|Tar archiving is often used together with a compression method, such as [[gzip]], to create a compressed archive.

This principle is the basis for the right to a [[speedy trial]] and similar rights which are meant to expedite the legal system, because it is unfair for the injured party to have to sustain the injury with little hope for resolution. The phrase has become a rallying cry for [[law reform|legal reformers]] who view [[court]]s or [[government]]s as acting too slowly in resolving legal issues either because the existing system is too complex or overburdened, or because the issue or party in question lacks political favour.

''[[Patterson v. Alabama|Patterson v. State of Alabama]]'' [1934] 294 U.S. 600, illustrates this position. It is important that the party claiming the relief or change of relief must have the same right from which either the first or the modified remedy may flow. Subsequent events in the course of the case cannot be constitutive of substantive rights enforceable in that very litigation ... but may influence the equitable jurisdiction to mould reliefs. Conversely, where rights have already vested in a party, they cannot be nullified or negated by subsequent events save where there is a change in the law and it is made applicable at any stage. [Citation omitted] ... Courts of justice may, when the compelling equities of a case oblige them, shape reliefs - cannot deny rights - to make them justly relevant in the updated circumstances. Where the relief is discretionary, Courts may exercise this jurisdiction to avoid injustice. Likewise, where the right to the remedy depends, under the statute itself, on the presence or absence of certain basic facts at the time the relief is to be ultimately granted, the Court, even in appeal, can take note of such supervening facts with fundamental impact....Where a cause of action is deficient but later events have made up the deficiency, the Court may, in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation, permit amendment and continue the proceeding, provided no prejudice is caused to the other side.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legalcrystal.com/case/639383/board-control-cricket-india-vs-netaji-club |title=Board of Control for Cricket, India and anr.

The estate's court case goes on for 12 years, for reasons no one understands, and the entire estate is itself dissipated in the battle. As one writer notes:\n<blockquote>In the Victorian era, the Court of Chancery was a synonym of delay. In Bleak House Dickens invented a fictional legal case named ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'' in order to caricature the legal system of England, and the iniquity of Chancery chiefly takes the form of procrastination: \"Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated, that no man alive knows what it means\" (BH1 16). As a consequence of this protraction, many characters involved in Jarndyce and Jarndyce are tortured by being held in painful anxiety\" one goes insand and another's mind is consumed with \u201ccorroding care, suspense, distrust, and doubt\u201d (BH 630).\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dickens.jp/archive/bh/bh-tsutsui.pdf|title=Delay and Suspense in Bleak House |last1=Mizuki |first1=Tsutsui |format=PDF |access-date=April 19, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the preface to ''Bleak House'', Dickens cites two Chancery cases as especial inspirations, one of which was a \"[[friendly suit]]\":\n\n{{Quote|text=At the present moment (August, 1853) there is a suit before the court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago, in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time, in which costs have been incurred to the amount of seventy thousand pounds, which is A FRIENDLY SUIT, and which is (I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun.

''[[Patterson v. Alabama|Patterson v. State of Alabama]]'' [1934] 294 U.S. 600, illustrates this position. It is important that the party claiming the relief or change of relief must have the same right from which either the first or the modified remedy may flow. Subsequent events in the course of the case cannot be constitutive of substantive rights enforceable in that very litigation ... but may influence the equitable jurisdiction to mould reliefs. Conversely, where rights have already vested in a party, they cannot be nullified or negated by subsequent events save where there is a change in the law and it is made applicable at any stage. [Citation omitted] ... Courts of justice may, when the compelling equities of a case oblige them, shape reliefs - cannot deny rights - to make them justly relevant in the updated circumstances. Where the relief is discretionary, Courts may exercise this jurisdiction to avoid injustice. Likewise, where the right to the remedy depends, under the statute itself, on the presence or absence of certain basic facts at the time the relief is to be ultimately granted, the Court, even in appeal, can take note of such supervening facts with fundamental impact....Where a cause of action is deficient but later events have made up the deficiency, the Court may, in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation, permit amendment and continue the proceeding, provided no prejudice is caused to the other side.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legalcrystal.com/case/639383/board-control-cricket-india-vs-netaji-club |title=Board of Control for Cricket, India and anr.

The estate's court case goes on for 12 years, for reasons no one understands, and the entire estate is itself dissipated in the battle.  As one writer notes:\n<blockquote>In the Victorian era, the Court of Chancery was a synonym of delay. In Bleak  House Dickens invented a fictional legal case named ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'' in order to caricature the legal system of England, and the iniquity of Chancery chiefly takes the form of procrastination: \u201cJarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated,  that  no  man  alive  knows  what  it  means\u201d  (BH1  16).  As  a  consequence  of  this protraction, many characters involved in Jarndyce and Jarndyce are tortured by being held in painful anxiety\" one goes insand and another's mind is consumed with \u201ccorroding care, suspense, distrust, and doubt\u201d (BH 630).\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dickens.jp/archive/bh/bh-tsutsui.pdf|title=Delay and Suspense in Bleak House  |last1=Mizuki |first1=Tsutsui |format=PDF |accessdate=April 19, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the preface to ''Bleak House'', Dickens cites two Chancery cases as especial inspirations, one of which was a \"[[friendly suit]]\":\n\n{{Quote|text=At the present moment (August, 1853) there is a suit before the court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago, in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time, in which costs have been incurred to the amount of seventy thousand pounds, which is A FRIENDLY SUIT, and which is (I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun.
