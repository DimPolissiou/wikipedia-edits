He is the founder of the [[Mizo National Front]].\n\nOriginally a [[Havildar]] in the [[Indian Army]], Laldenga later worked as an Accounts Clerk in the [[Government of Assam]]. Disappointed by the Government's indifference to the severe famine in the [[Mizo district]] in the late 1950s, he rebelled against the Government. As a leader of the [[Mizo National Front]] (MNF), he led a [[secessionist]] war seeking Mizo territory's independence from [[India]]. He was captured many times, and spent most of his time in exile in [[Bangladesh]]. The [[guerrilla]] movement lasted for sixteen years till the [[Mizo Accord]] was signed in 1986, by which he became the Chief Minister. He won the first [[Mizoram Legislative Assembly]] election under statehood in 1987, and continued at the Chief Minister office for another year. He died of [[lung cancer]] in 1990.\n\n==Early years==  \n\nBorn on Sunday, the 12th June, 1927, Laldenga the fourth child of a cultivator Liantlira Ralte and Darchhungi Hnamte, hailed from Pukpui Village in the Mizo district of Assam (now  [[Lunglei district]] of Mizoram). He joined the Indian Army and served up to [[Havildar]]. He resigned from the army and joined civil service as Accounts Clerk under District Council office in [[Aizawl]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pachuau |first1=Joy |title=The Camera as a Witness |publisher=Cambridge |isbn=9781107073395 |pages=302}}</ref>\n\n==Secessionist movement==\nLaldenga joined a voluntary organisation called Mizo Cultural Society, formed in 1955, as its Secretary. The society became Mautam Front in March 1960 to work for relief due to the [[Mautam]] famine that affected the entire Mizoram (which was then a district council of Assam). The government could not make efficient effort to provide basic survival needs, and this prompted the need for more powerful pressure group. The organisation was then renamed Mizo National Famine Front (MNFF) in September 1960. This soon evolved into a political organisation and ultimately became the Mizo National Front (MNF) on 22 October 1961. Laldenga took the support from [[Pakistan]] for the separatist movement and was arrested and jailed by Indian authorities. As an outcome of his talks, between 1963 and 1966 East Pakistan provided military training and shelter to Mizo fighters when they needed exile <ref>{{cite book |last1=Pachuau |first1=Joy |title=The Camera as a Witness |publisher=Cambridge |isbn=9781107073395 |pages=323}}</ref>..\n\nOn the night of 28 February 1966, the MNF launched an daring and ambitious attack on the district's major towns, resulting in the [[March 1966 Mizo National Front uprising]]. It declared independence and called on the [[Mizo people|Mizos]] to rise against India. The Indian Government responded by sending troops and aircraft on bombing missions. Villagers were uprooted from the hills and sent without their consent to Regrouped Villages built along the highways. For the next 20 years, violence continued in the Mizo hills with the fighters camping in Mizoram (India) and [[East Pakistan]]. With the fall of East Pakistan in 1971, Laldenga's men scattered to [[Myanmar]] while he moved to Pakistan.

This aircraft is now in Virgin Australia livery.]]\nThe timing of Virgin Blue's entry into the Australian market was fortunate as it was able to fill the vacuum created by the failure of [[Ansett Australia]] in September 2001. Ansett's failure allowed Virgin to grow rapidly to become Australia's second domestic carrier, rather than staying just a cut-price alternative to the established players. It also gave Virgin access to terminal space without which growth would have been significantly limited. Delays in negotiating access to the former Ansett terminal at [[Sydney Airport]] however, forced Virgin to use its original terminal there\u2014a collection of prefabricated buildings without [[Jet bridge|aerobridges]]\u2014longer than was needed. As the airline grew, it acquired new equipment, enabling it to phase-out its older 737-400s in favour of [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737-700 and \u2212800]] series aircraft with modern glass cockpits, winglets and greater fuel efficiency.\n\nVirgin Group's holding in Virgin Australia has since been reduced, initially via a sale of a half interest to Australian logistics conglomerate [[Patrick Corporation]], and later by a public [[Initial Public Offering|float]]. In early 2005 Patrick launched a hostile takeover for Virgin Blue. Patrick had been unhappy for some time with the company's direction. By the closure of the offer, Patrick held 62% of the company, giving it control. Virgin Group retains a 25% share.\n\nIn May 2006 [[Toll Holdings]] acquired Patrick and became the majority owner of Virgin Blue. In July 2008 Toll sold its majority holding via a special dividend to hold 1.7% of the company. In June 2013 Air New Zealand owned 23% of the company.<ref name=Australian6Jun13>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/air-nz-revealed-as-buyer-of-3pc-additional-virgin-stake/story-e6frg95x-1226658272262 Air NZ revealed as buyer of 3pc additional Virgin stake] ''The Australian'' 6 June 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgin Blue Boeing 737-800 PER Monty-3.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737\u2013800]] in the old Virgin Blue red livery at [[Perth Airport]] in 2004]]\nVirgin Blue previously used a familiar formula pioneered by airlines such as [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Ryanair]] of eliminating costs such as included [[airline meal|in-flight meals]] and printed tickets in favour of selling food on-board and using telephone and internet booking systems.

However, after the collapse of its domestic competitor Ansett Australia, it began a codeshare agreement with [[United Airlines]]. This allowed United customers to fly from the United States to any of Virgin Blue's Australian destinations that United did not already serve. In 2006, in an effort to compete with Qantas, Virgin Blue started exploring these relationships, forming frequent flyer agreements with [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Hawaiian Airlines]] and [[Malaysia Airlines]]. Virgin Blue also has an Interline Agreement with Regional Express Airlines for travellers to and from smaller regional centres in the eastern states of Australia, and operates its own two routes with [[Virgin Australia Regional Airlines]] in Western Australia.

Originally this was called ''The Blue Room'' and provided facilities to members and guests on a pay-as-you-go basis. Many of these facilities became available when Virgin relocated into the former [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] terminals across the country, with the defunct ''Golden Wing club'' lounges left behind being used as Blue Room lounges, complete with furnishings.\n\nIn 2006, Virgin revamped the lounge facilities and re-launched the product as ''The Lounge'', which offered all-inclusive facilities on a membership fee or casual fee basis. Upgraded facilities provided included [[buffet]] food and refreshments, newspapers, showers, computers, and [[WiFi]] internet access for travellers.\n\nIn May 2011, Virgin again renamed the lounge simply referring to it as ''Virgin Australia lounge'' \u2013 designed to be a premium experience, with spaces designed for specific uses and 'moods'.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Access===\nMembership can be purchased online by logging into a passenger's Velocity Frequent Flyer account. Membership fees vary depending on the elite status level. Lifetime memberships are also available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/experience/at-the-airport/lounge/#prices-and-membership |title=Virgin Australia Lounge Membership Prices |publisher=Virginaustralia.com |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Velocity Frequent Flyer Program==\n{{main|Velocity Frequent Flyer}}\nVirgin Australia launched its [[frequent-flyer program]] Velocity Rewards in 2005, with partner [[National Australia Bank]] offering a companion credit card. By 2007, points collected from selected [[Westpac]], [[American Express]] and [[Diners Club]] cards could be transferred to Velocity Rewards, and effective September 2008, ANZ reward visa card points as well. The program reached 4 million members by the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/media/2014/VEL__FOUR_MILLION_MEMBERS/ |title=Velocity Frequent Flyer reaches four million members |publisher=Virgin Australia |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nStatus levels were introduced to the program in late 2007 as part of continued efforts to attract business travellers. Alongside the entry-level \"red\" status, frequent travellers were given the opportunity to attain \"silver\" and \"gold\" status, each with its own set of benefits.\n\nInitially, Velocity was different from most other frequent flyer programs, as points were earned relative to the cost of a flight, rather than distance. Velocity members originally earned 6 points per dollar spent on Virgin Australia flights. This was later altered due to the introduction of status levels; Red members now earned 5 points per dollar, Silver members remained at 6 points, and Gold members earned 7. Points accrual on V Australia, as well as the majority of Velocity's airline partners, have always based on distance.\n\nVelocity was the first frequent flyer program in Australia to offer \"any seat, any time\" reward flight availability. The number of points required to redeem an award seat directly corresponds to the current fare of that seat, allowing any seat currently available to be redeemed.

This aircraft is now in Virgin Australia livery.]]\nThe timing of Virgin Blue's entry into the Australian market was fortunate as it was able to fill the vacuum created by the failure of [[Ansett Australia]] in September 2001. Ansett's failure allowed Virgin to grow rapidly to become Australia's second domestic carrier, rather than staying just a cut-price alternative to the established players. It also gave Virgin access to terminal space without which growth would have been significantly limited. Delays in negotiating access to the former Ansett terminal at [[Sydney Airport]] however, forced Virgin to use its original terminal there\u2014a collection of prefabricated buildings without [[Jet bridge|aerobridges]]\u2014longer than was needed. As the airline grew, it acquired new equipment, enabling it to phase-out its older 737-400s in favour of [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737-700 and \u2212800]] series aircraft with modern glass cockpits, winglets and greater fuel efficiency.\n\nVirgin Group's holding in Virgin Australia has since been reduced, initially via a sale of a half interest to Australian logistics conglomerate [[Patrick Corporation]], and later by a public [[Initial Public Offering|float]]. In early 2005 Patrick launched a hostile takeover for Virgin Blue. Patrick had been unhappy for some time with the company's direction. By the closure of the offer, Patrick held 62% of the company, giving it control. Virgin Group retains a 25% share.\n\nIn May 2006 [[Toll Holdings]] acquired Patrick and became the majority owner of Virgin Blue. In July 2008 Toll sold its majority holding via a special dividend to hold 1.7% of the company. In June 2013 Air New Zealand owned 23% of the company.<ref name=Australian6Jun13>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/air-nz-revealed-as-buyer-of-3pc-additional-virgin-stake/story-e6frg95x-1226658272262 Air NZ revealed as buyer of 3pc additional Virgin stake] ''The Australian'' 6 June 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgin Blue Boeing 737-800 PER Monty-3.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737\u2013800]] in the old Virgin Blue red livery at [[Perth Airport]] in 2004]]\nVirgin Blue previously used a familiar formula pioneered by airlines such as [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Ryanair]] of eliminating costs such as included [[airline meal|in-flight meals]] and printed tickets in favour of selling food on-board and using telephone and internet booking systems.

Beaches which have aircraft named after them include [[Cable Beach]], [[Cottesloe Beach]] and [[Bondi Beach]].

The Live2Air system was only available on selected Boeing 737 aircraft, and was phased out beginning in 2012.\n\nVirgin Australia's Boeing 777-300ERs and Airbus A330-200 aircraft's in-flight entertainment ''RED'' is based on the [[Panasonic Avionics Corporation|Panasonic eX2]] system. RED is fully touch-screen and handset controlled. There is no fee for use. RED features an extensive video on demand library that includes new release film, TV series and TV programmes. Destination guides are available. Other functions available through RED include music on demand (approx 200+ CD library) and video games. Seat-to-seat chat is available as well as in flight map and flight information.\n\nIn December 2012, Virgin Australia introduced an in-flight [[Wi-Fi]] system to provide music, movies and TV shows to tablets, smartphones, laptops and similar devices. The system, which does not offer internet access, is estimated to be fitted on all the airline's planes within 2 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.domesticflightaustralia.com/news/virgin-australia-to-provide-inflight-movies-music-via-on-board-wifi-20121224.php |title=Virgin Australia to Provide Inflight Movies, Music via On-Board WiFi |date=24 December 2012 |accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Virgin Australia began upgrading the in-flight Wi-Fi system in order to offer wireless internet access.

Originally this was called ''The Blue Room'' and provided facilities to members and guests on a pay-as-you-go basis. Many of these facilities became available when Virgin relocated into the former [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] terminals across the country, with the defunct ''Golden Wing club'' lounges left behind being used as Blue Room lounges, complete with furnishings.\n\nIn 2006, Virgin revamped the lounge facilities and re-launched the product as ''The Lounge'', which offered all-inclusive facilities on a membership fee or casual fee basis. Upgraded facilities provided included [[buffet]] food and refreshments, newspapers, showers, computers, and [[WiFi]] internet access for travellers.\n\nIn May 2011, Virgin again renamed the lounge simply referring to it as ''Virgin Australia lounge'' \u2013 designed to be a premium experience, with spaces designed for specific uses and 'moods'.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Access===\nMembership can be purchased online by logging into a passenger's Velocity Frequent Flyer account. Membership fees vary depending on the elite status level. Lifetime memberships are also available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/experience/at-the-airport/lounge/#prices-and-membership |title=Virgin Australia Lounge Membership Prices |publisher=Virginaustralia.com |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Velocity Frequent Flyer Program==\n{{main|Velocity Frequent Flyer}}\nVirgin Australia launched its [[frequent-flyer program]] Velocity Rewards in 2005, with partner [[National Australia Bank]] offering a companion credit card. By 2007, points collected from selected [[Westpac]], [[American Express]] and [[Diners Club]] cards could be transferred to Velocity Rewards, and effective September 2008, ANZ reward visa card points as well. The program reached 4 million members by the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/media/2014/VEL__FOUR_MILLION_MEMBERS/ |title=Velocity Frequent Flyer reaches four million members |publisher=Virgin Australia |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nStatus levels were introduced to the program in late 2007 as part of continued efforts to attract business travellers. Alongside the entry-level \"red\" status, frequent travellers were given the opportunity to attain \"silver\" and \"gold\" status, each with its own set of benefits.\n\nInitially, Velocity was different from most other frequent flyer programs, as points were earned relative to the cost of a flight, rather than distance. Velocity members originally earned 6 points per dollar spent on Virgin Australia flights. This was later altered due to the introduction of status levels; Red members now earned 5 points per dollar, Silver members remained at 6 points, and Gold members earned 7. Points accrual on V Australia, as well as the majority of Velocity's airline partners, have always based on distance.\n\nVelocity was the first frequent flyer program in Australia to offer \"any seat, any time\" reward flight availability. The number of points required to redeem an award seat directly corresponds to the current fare of that seat, allowing any seat currently available to be redeemed. [[Qantas]] introduced a similar feature to their frequent flyer program in May 2008.\n\nIn August 2011, the program was relaunched as \"Velocity Frequent Flyer\" and a platinum status level was introduced, among other changes.\n\nIn July 2013, Velocity introduced the Global Wallet function, which was the first prepaid traveller card in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausbt.com.au/virgin-australia-s-new-global-wallet-travel-money-card |title=Virgin Australia's new Global Wallet travel money card |publisher=Australian Business Traveller |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref> The key feature of this card is it allows you to load your money and store it in other supported currencies before travelling. You can access to ATMs around the world as well as shop at anywhere where visa is accepted. Supported currencies include Australian Dollar (AUD), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), Pound Sterling (GBP), Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), Japanese Yen (JPY), New Zealand Dollar (NZD), Singapore Dollar (SGD), Thai Baht (THB), US Dollar (USD) and South African Rand (ZAR). You also earn 1 Velocity Point per $1 spent overseas and 1 point per $2 spent in Australia.\n\nIn 2015, Velocity Frequent Flyer won the 'Program of the Year\" in the Middle East & Asia/Oceania District category at the Freddie Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freddieawards.com/2015-annual-freddie-awards-27th/ |title=2015 Annual Freddie Awards (27th) Results |publisher=Freddie Awards |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n* In 2003, a man with a disability and having incomplete [[quadriplegia]] was removed from a Virgin Blue flight because staff thought he was drunk or a terrorist.
