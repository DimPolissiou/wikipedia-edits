Founded by [[Ted Turner]], and based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], it merged with [[Time Warner]] on October 10, 1996. Among its main properties were its namesake [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]], [[CNN]], [[Turner Classic Movies]], [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Adult Swim]], and [[TruTV]]. It also licensed or had ownership interests in international versions of these properties. The headquarters of Turner's properties are located in both the [[CNN Center]] in [[Downtown Atlanta]], and the Turner Broadcasting campus off Techwood Drive in [[Midtown Atlanta]], which also houses [[Turner Entertainment|Turner Studios]].\n\nThe company was known for several pioneering innovations in U.S. [[multichannel television]], including its satellite uplink of local Atlanta [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[WPCH-TV|WTCG]] channel 17 as one of the first national \"[[superstation]]s\", and its establishment of [[CNN]]\u2014the first 24-hour [[news channel]].\n\nOn June 14, 2018, Time Warner was acquired by telecom firm AT&T and renamed WarnerMedia.

All four cable systems started receiving the 1948 Dana Andrews - Cesar Romero film ''[[Deep Waters (1948 film)|Deep Waters]]'' already in progress. The movie had started 30 minutes earlier. WTCG went from being a little television station to a major [[TV network]] that every one of the 24,000 households outside of the 675,000 in Atlanta was receiving coast-to-coast. WTCG became a so-called [[Superstation]] and created a precedent of today's basic [[cable television]].\n\n[[HBO]] had gone to satellite transmissions to distribute its signal nationally in 1975, but that was a service that cable subscribers were made to pay extra to receive. Ted Turner's innovation signaled the start of the basic cable revolution.\n\nIn 1979, the company changed its name to Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (TBS, Inc.) and the call letters of its main entertainment channel to WTBS.\n\n===1980s===\nOn June 1, 1980, [[CNN|Cable News Network]] (CNN) was launched at 5:00pm [[Eastern Time|EDT]] becoming the first 24-hour [[television news|news]] [[cable television|cable channel]].

Following the acquisition, Turner had an enormous debt and sold parts of the acquisition. MGM/UA Entertainment was sold back to Kirk Kerkorian.

Founded by [[Ted Turner]], and based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], it merged with [[Time Warner]] on October 10, 1996. Among its main properties were its namesake [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]], [[CNN]], [[Turner Classic Movies]], [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Adult Swim]], and [[TruTV]]. It also licensed or had ownership interests in international versions of these properties. The headquarters of Turner's properties are located in both the [[CNN Center]] in [[Downtown Atlanta]], and the Turner Broadcasting campus off Techwood Drive in [[Midtown Atlanta]], which also houses [[Turner Entertainment|Turner Studios]].\n\nThe company was known for several pioneering innovations in U.S. [[multichannel television]], including its satellite uplink of local Atlanta [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[WPCH-TV|WTCG]] channel 17 as one of the first national \"[[superstation]]s\", and its establishment of [[CNN]]\u2014the first 24-hour [[news channel]].\n\nOn June 14, 2018, Time Warner was acquired by telecom firm AT&T and renamed WarnerMedia.

All four cable systems started receiving the 1948 Dana Andrews - Cesar Romero film ''[[Deep Waters (1948 film)|Deep Waters]]'' already in progress. The movie had started 30 minutes earlier. WTCG went from being a little television station to a major [[TV network]] that every one of the 24,000 households outside of the 675,000 in Atlanta was receiving coast-to-coast. WTCG became a so-called [[Superstation]] and created a precedent of today's basic [[cable television]].\n\n[[HBO]] had gone to satellite transmissions to distribute its signal nationally in 1975, but that was a service that cable subscribers were made to pay extra to receive. Ted Turner's innovation signaled the start of the basic cable revolution.\n\nIn 1979, the company changed its name to Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (TBS, Inc.) and the call letters of its main entertainment channel to WTBS.\n\n===1980s===\nOn June 1, 1980, [[CNN|Cable News Network]] (CNN) was launched at 5:00pm [[Eastern Time|EDT]] becoming the first 24-hour [[television news|news]] [[cable television|cable channel]].

The channel was short-lived but helped influence the original format of [[VH1]].\n\nIn 1986, after a failed attempt to acquire [[CBS]], Turner purchased the film studio [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]/[[United Artists|UA]] Entertainment Co. from [[Kirk Kerkorian]] for $1.5 billion. Following the acquisition, Turner had an enormous debt and sold parts of the acquisition. MGM/UA Entertainment was sold back to Kirk Kerkorian.

Its territory is now divided between [[Austria]] and [[Hungary]]. The capital of the county was [[Sopron]].\n\n== Geography ==\nSopron county shared borders with the [[Austria]]n land Lower Austria and the Hungarian counties [[Moson]], [[Gy\u0151r (county)|Gy\u0151r]], [[Veszpr\u00e9m County (former)|Veszpr\u00e9m]] and [[Vas County (former)|Vas]]. The [[Lake Neusiedl]] (Hungarian: ''Fert\u0151 t\u00f3'', German: ''Neusiedler See'') lay in the county. Its area was about 3,256&nbsp;km\u00b2 around 1910.\n\n== History ==\nThe Sopron [[Counties of the Kingdom of Hungary|comitatus]] arose as one of the first comitatus of the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nIn 1920, by the [[Treaty of Trianon]] the western part of the county became part of the [[Austria]]n state of [[Burgenland]], while the eastern part became a part of Hungary. In 1921, it was decided by referendum that the city of [[Sopron]] would join Hungary instead of Austria.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Sopron county merged with [[Gy\u0151r (county)|Gy\u0151r-Moson-Pozsony]] to form [[Gy\u0151r-Moson-Sopron|Gy\u0151r-Sopron]] county. This county was renamed to [[Gy\u0151r-Moson-Sopron]] county in the early 1990s.
