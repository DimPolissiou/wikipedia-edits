Before and after its cancellation, the shows in the block aired reruns both on [[Disney Channel]] (Some of them from 1994 through 2000, with some remaining until as late as 2007) and on [[Toon Disney]] (all of them from the time the channel launched in 1998 through 2004, with some remaining until as late as 2008). Starting on October 2, 1995, four of the shows (''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', ''[[TaleSpin]]'', ''[[DuckTales]]'', and ''[[Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers]]'') were rerun on Disney Channel as a two-hour programming block called \"Block Party\" which aired on weekdays in the late afternoon/early evening.<ref>\"Block Party: Four Disney Animated Series.\" ''The Disney Channel Magazine'', Vol. 13, no. 5, October/November 1995: p. 36.</ref> Several of the block's shows are available on [[DVD]] in the United States. Every series that aired on the block (with the exception of ''[[Aladdin (animated TV series)|Aladdin]]'' and ''[[The Shnookums and Meat Funny Cartoon Show]]'') is available to view on the [[Disney+]] video on demand streaming service, which launched on November 12, 2019.\n\nThe Disney Afternoon's two-hour block was broken up into four half-hour segments, each of which contained an [[animated series]]. As each season ended, the first series shown in the lineup would typically be dropped while the remaining three would move up a time slot, and a new one would be added to the end. The Disney Afternoon itself featured unique animated segments consisting of its own opening and \"wrappers\" around the cartoon shows shown.\n\nThe Disney Afternoon originally ran from September 10, 1990 to August 29, 1997. For the 1997 and 1998 television seasons, it was replaced by an unnamed block, shortened to 90 minutes, followed by its replacement by [[Disney's One Too]] for [[UPN]] in 1999. The block did not air in every market across the United States, but for those markets that did not air the block in full, individual shows featured on The Disney Afternoon could be packaged by themselves, allowing the shows to be aired any time of the day (morning or afternoon), while The Disney Afternoon only aired on weekday afternoons. Some of the shows also aired on Saturday mornings on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] or [[CBS]] concurrently with their original syndicated runs on The Disney Afternoon. The only show to reach the 2000s was ''[[Goof Troop]]'' with the 2000 direct-to-video finale ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'', and the only shows to reach the 2010s are ''[[DuckTales]]'' with a reboot also called ''[[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|DuckTales]]'' and [[Darkwing Duck]] as a show within the reboot on [[Disney Channel]].\n\n==History==\nSome of the early cartoon series on The Disney Afternoon came from already in-circulation cartoons, such as ''[[Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears|Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'', which aired on [[NBC]] from 1985 to 1988 and then moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1989. ''[[DuckTales]]'' premiered in 1987 as Disney was focused on incorporating animated series into its portfolio in the era of cartoons; it was Disney's only syndicated cartoon series until accompanied in 1989 by ''[[Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers]].'' These two shows had been packaged together as an hour-long cartoon block from 1989 to 1990, until both shows were incorporated into The Disney Afternoon in September 1990.\n\nBoth ''DuckTales'' and ''Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers'' were [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] and packaged at first through their original television affiliates, most of which evolved from independents to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliates with successful children's lineups. However, due to disputes between Disney and Fox later on, both shows were pulled from many Fox affiliates by Disney and landed on other stations in the same markets that were still independents by the time The Disney Afternoon came to play. Other Fox affiliates simply passed it down to their independent competitors by choice due to shorter time frames for local programming, mainly with the debut of The Disney Afternoon's main competitor [[Fox Kids]] and more stations premiering local morning news programs. However, some Fox affiliates aired The Disney Afternoon during the first two years of their existence before they either passed it down to their independent competitors or packaged the shows individually. This is mainly due to Fox Kids expanding their afternoon lineup to two hours.\n \nSome of The Disney Afternoon's later additions were inspired by shorter cartoon segments in the short-lived series ''[[Raw Toonage]]'', which appeared on the [[CBS]] network in the fall of 1992. For example, the show's \"Marsupilami\" segment was spun off into the series ''[[Marsupilami (1993 TV series)|Marsupilami]]'', which in turn spawned ''[[The Shnookums and Meat Funny Cartoon Show]]'', which aired on the block. Likewise, the ''Raw Toonage'' segment \"He's Bonkers!\" was spun off into the series ''[[Bonkers (TV series)|Bonkers]]'', which aired on the block.\n\nBeginning with the 1994 season, [[Marvel Comics]] (which would eventually be acquired by Disney) began publishing a comic book series based on the programs featured on the block, as part of their line of comics based on modern Disney properties (the classic properties were licensed to [[Gladstone Publishing]]). The series mainly consisted of stories based on ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', with occasional stories featuring ''Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers'' and ''TaleSpin''. It ended at 10 issues, but stories based on the block's shows continued in Marvel's ''Disney Comic Hits!'' and in the children's magazine ''[[Disney Adventures]]''.\n\nIn October 1995, owing to decreasing business in the syndicated children's television market due to new competitors such as the cable networks [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Nickelodeon]], and the children's blocks of the new [[UPN]] and [[The WB]] networks, Buena Vista entered into an agreement with the [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett agency]] to market and distribute a revamped version of the block for the 1997\u201398 and 1998\u201399 television seasons. Leo Burnett established a partnership with [[Kellogg's]]\u2014who had been a major sponsor of The Disney Afternoon, to purchase an amount of dedicated advertising inventory.<ref name=adage-kelloggs>{{cite web|title=Disney Takes Kellogg Clout To Stations|url=http://adage.com/article/news/disney-takes-kellogg-clout-stations/84878/|website=Ad Age|accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref> The revamped block, downsized to 90 minutes, debuted on September 1, 1997 to replace The Disney Afternoon.<ref name=adage-kelloggs/> The new block did not carry any blanket branding, but was referred to internally as the \"Disney-Kellogg Alliance.\"<ref name=\"upn-disneyblock\"/><ref name=awm>{{cite journal|title=Tooning in the Fall Season|journal=Animation World Magazine|date=September 1997|issue=2.6|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.6/2.6pages/2.6tooningin.html|accessdate=March 30, 2015}}</ref> In 1998, Disney reached a deal to program a new children's block for UPN, [[Disney's One Too]], as a replacement for that network's internal [[UPN Kids]] block.

Before and after its cancellation, the shows in the block aired reruns both on [[Disney Channel]] (Some of them from 1994 through 2000, with some remaining until as late as 2007) and on [[Toon Disney]] (all of them from the time the channel launched in 1998 through 2004, with some remaining until as late as 2008). Starting on October 2, 1995, four of the shows (''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', ''[[TaleSpin]]'', ''[[DuckTales]]'', and ''[[Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers]]'') were rerun on Disney Channel as a two-hour programming block called \"Block Party\" which aired on weekdays in the late afternoon/early evening.<ref>\"Block Party: Four Disney Animated Series.\" ''The Disney Channel Magazine'', Vol. 13, no. 5, October/November 1995: p. 36.</ref> Several of the block's shows are available on [[DVD]] in the United States. Every series that aired on the block (with the exception of ''[[Aladdin (animated TV series)|Aladdin]]'' and ''[[The Shnookums and Meat Funny Cartoon Show]]'') is available to view on the [[Disney+]] video on demand streaming service, which launched on November 12, 2019.\n\nThe Disney Afternoon's two-hour block was broken up into four half-hour segments, each of which contained an [[animated series]]. As each season ended, the first series shown in the lineup would typically be dropped while the remaining three would move up a time slot, and a new one would be added to the end. The Disney Afternoon itself featured unique animated segments consisting of its own opening and \"wrappers\" around the cartoon shows shown.\n\nThe Disney Afternoon originally ran from September 10, 1990 to August 29, 1997. For the 1997 and 1998 television seasons, it was replaced by an unnamed block, shortened to 90 minutes, followed by its replacement by [[Disney's One Too]] for [[UPN]] in 1999. The block did not air in every market across the United States, but for those markets that did not air the block in full, individual shows featured on The Disney Afternoon could be packaged by themselves, allowing the shows to be aired any time of the day (morning or afternoon), while The Disney Afternoon only aired on weekday afternoons. Some of the shows also aired on Saturday mornings on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] or [[CBS]] concurrently with their original syndicated runs on The Disney Afternoon. The only show to reach the 2000s was ''[[Goof Troop]]'' with the 2000 direct-to-video finale ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'', and the only shows to reach the 2010s are ''[[DuckTales]]'' with a reboot also called ''[[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|DuckTales]]'' and [[Darkwing Duck]] as a show within the reboot on [[Disney Channel]].\n\n==History==\nSome of the early cartoon series on The Disney Afternoon came from already in-circulation cartoons, such as ''[[Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears|Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'', which aired on [[NBC]] from 1985 to 1988 and then moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1989. ''[[DuckTales]]'' premiered in 1987 as Disney was focused on incorporating animated series into its portfolio in the era of cartoons; it was Disney's only syndicated cartoon series until accompanied in 1989 by ''[[Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers]].'' These two shows had been packaged together as an hour-long cartoon block from 1989 to 1990, until both shows were incorporated into The Disney Afternoon in September 1990.\n\nBoth ''DuckTales'' and ''Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers'' were [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] and packaged at first through their original television affiliates, most of which evolved from independents to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliates with successful children's lineups. However, due to disputes between Disney and Fox later on, both shows were pulled from many Fox affiliates by Disney and landed on other stations in the same markets that were still independents by the time The Disney Afternoon came to play. Other Fox affiliates simply passed it down to their independent competitors by choice due to shorter time frames for local programming, mainly with the debut of The Disney Afternoon's main competitor [[Fox Kids]] and more stations premiering local morning news programs. However, some Fox affiliates aired The Disney Afternoon during the first two years of their existence before they either passed it down to their independent competitors or packaged the shows individually. This is mainly due to Fox Kids expanding their afternoon lineup to two hours.\n \nSome of The Disney Afternoon's later additions were inspired by shorter cartoon segments in the short-lived series ''[[Raw Toonage]]'', which appeared on the [[CBS]] network in the fall of 1992. For example, the show's \"Marsupilami\" segment was spun off into the series ''[[Marsupilami (1993 TV series)|Marsupilami]]'', which in turn spawned ''[[The Shnookums and Meat Funny Cartoon Show]]'', which aired on the block. Likewise, the ''Raw Toonage'' segment \"He's Bonkers!\" was spun off into the series ''[[Bonkers (TV series)|Bonkers]]'', which aired on the block.\n\nBeginning with the 1994 season, [[Marvel Comics]] (which would eventually be acquired by Disney) began publishing a comic book series based on the programs featured on the block, as part of their line of comics based on modern Disney properties (the classic properties were licensed to [[Gladstone Publishing]]). The series mainly consisted of stories based on ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', with occasional stories featuring ''Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers'' and ''TaleSpin''. It ended at 10 issues, but stories based on the block's shows continued in Marvel's ''Disney Comic Hits!'' and in the children's magazine ''[[Disney Adventures]]''.\n\nIn October 1995, owing to decreasing business in the syndicated children's television market due to new competitors such as the cable networks [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Nickelodeon]], and the children's blocks of the new [[UPN]] and [[The WB]] networks, Buena Vista entered into an agreement with the [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett agency]] to market and distribute a revamped version of the block for the 1997\u201398 and 1998\u201399 television seasons. Leo Burnett established a partnership with [[Kellogg's]]\u2014who had been a major sponsor of The Disney Afternoon, to purchase an amount of dedicated advertising inventory.<ref name=adage-kelloggs>{{cite web|title=Disney Takes Kellogg Clout To Stations|url=http://adage.com/article/news/disney-takes-kellogg-clout-stations/84878/|website=Ad Age|accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref> The revamped block, downsized to 90 minutes, debuted on September 1, 1997 to replace The Disney Afternoon.<ref name=adage-kelloggs/> The new block did not carry any blanket branding, but was referred to internally as the \"Disney-Kellogg Alliance.\"<ref name=\"upn-disneyblock\"/><ref name=awm>{{cite journal|title=Tooning in the Fall Season|journal=Animation World Magazine|date=September 1997|issue=2.6|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.6/2.6pages/2.6tooningin.html|accessdate=March 30, 2015}}</ref> In 1998, Disney reached a deal to program a new children's block for UPN, [[Disney's One Too]], as a replacement for that network's internal [[UPN Kids]] block.

The dirt roof had to be compacted which required stomping the dirt hard in a uniform way to compact it evenly. This event of cooperation is called ''ta'awon'' and from here comes the word ''awneh'', meaning \"help.\" This developed into the song ''Ala Dalouna'' ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062f\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646\u0627}}), roughly translated, \"let's go and help\". The Dabke and the rhythmic songs go together in an attempt to keep the work fun and the workers energetic.\nAccording to Yazbec, the Canaanites and Phoenicians were the first teachers of the dance in the world, and the dabke is a representative descendant of the Phoenician dances.<ref name=\"Dabke Origin\">{{cite book|title=The Arab World, Volume 8|date=1962|publisher=Arab Information Center|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=rbcwU7nSAcKfyQHZlIHoBw&id=HlbVAAAAMAAJ&dq=}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n\nIn levant there are around 19 types of The  Dabke and many of them are performed in Palestine, jordan  Syria and Lebanon. But Lebanon has their own additional 3 variations of Dabke native to specific villages in Lebanon only. Different Levantine types of Dabke include but are not limited to:<ref name=\"allofjo.net\"/>\n\n<br />\n\n* \n\n'''1.Daloonah''' is the most common variation and it's Native to Mount Lebanon. It comprises six beats and is typically accompanied by a ''minjeira'' or ''mizmar'' (types of flutes) and the ''tabel'' (drum). Clapping is used to add joy to the festivities.\n\n'''2.Ra\u2019asit el Aarjah''' (limping dance) is native to Baalbeck. It is slower than the common ''dabke'' as it comprises 12 beats. The music is usually a combination of ''minjeira'' or ''mijwiz'' or ''rabehbeh'' (violin-like instrument) and ''tabel''. Any combination can also be accompanied by clapping.\n\n'''3.Metalteh''' is characteristic of Barja, a southern village in Lebanon . It is composed of 16 beats and the music is a mix of ''minjeira'' and ''tabel''.\n\n<br />\n{{Div col}}\n* ''' Habel Mwadea\u2019 ''' '''(\u062d\u0628\u0644 \u0645\u0648\u062f\u0639)''': is the Jordanian dabke of any type performed by men and women jointly.<ref name=\"allofjo.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allofjo.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12074:2011-05-21-20-17-50&catid=51:2010-06-06-04-19-21&Itemid=263 |title=\u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0646 |website=Allofjo.net |date= |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref> \n* '''Al-Karaadiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629)'' also known as ''Al-Taiyyara'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0629)'': It is on of the most famous types of dabke in Jordan, it is characterized by its fast rhythm in an open circle.

The ''lawweeh'' is expected to be particularly skilled in accuracy, ability to improvise, and quickness (generally light on his feet). Typically, the dabke begins with a musician playing a solo on the ''mijwiz'' or ''yarghoul'' of a ''Dal Ouna'' piece, often with two singers accompanying his music. The dancers develop a synchronized movement and step and when the singers finish their song, the ''lawweeh'' breaks from the semicircle to dance on his own. When the leader of the dabke sees that the men's steps are one, in sync, he instructs the dancers to slow down and begin a movement crossing their right foot in front of the opposite one (their left foot). The ''lawweeh'' continues to inform the dancers of their basic rhythms, and at this point other guests at the wedding or event occurring will join in the dabke line. This is the most popular and familiar form of dabke danced for happy family celebrations, such as weddings, circumcisions, the return of travelers, release of prisoners, and also for national holidays, in which dabke becomes a demonstration of national personality.<ref name=\"layla\">\u0647\u0634\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0627\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0639\u062f \u0648\u0645\u0623\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0639\u062f. \u0641\u0648\u0643\u0644\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0633 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0628\u064a: \u0644\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0646\u0627>.\u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0641\u0648\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644.</ref>\n* '''Al-\u2019Askariyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0633\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0629)'': \n* '''Al-Joufiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0629)'': it consists of two groups stand in opposition to each other: the first group sings and the second responses with Jordanian folkloric songs.\n* '''Al-Ghawarneh''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0646\u0629)'' also known as ''Deir \u2019Ala''  ''(\u062f\u064a\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0627)'': performed in [[Jordan Valley]], and it's one of the fastest types of dabke.\n* '''Wahad w Nos''' ''(\u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0648\u0646\u0635)''\n* '''Abu \u2019Alanda''' ''(\u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0639\u0644\u0646\u062f\u0647)''\n* '''Al-Aqabawiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0628\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629)'': It is performed in [[Aqaba]] in South Jordan.\n* '''Al-Ramthawiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0645\u062b\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629)'': It is performed in [[Ramtha]] in North Jordan.\n* '''Al-Sahja''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0633\u062d\u062c\u0629)'' : is a popular Palestinian and Jordanian dance which became significantly more popular during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]].

It involves two lines of dancers who move toward each other with small steps and then retreat while singing rhymed couplets. These couplets were largely laments for absent loved ones. Although seafaring is no longer economically important in the region, women continue to perform this dance at social gatherings.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The ''Ahwash'' (Fr., ahouache) performed by Berber tribes of the Moroccan High Atlas Mountains, includes one or several curved lines of men and one or several curved lines of women, the whole forming a circle or ellipse around male drummers (Jouad and Lortat-Jacob, 1978; Lortat-Jacob, 1980). One line recites a poem that the other line responds to with another poem; then all move to the beat of the drums. Customarily, the whole community participates. While performing, women dancers hold themselves very straight and move with staccato steps, holding onto the weaving rod of the house. Women as well as men compose the poetry that is recited. A similar dance reported for Morocco is the dukkala. In one variation a man and woman facing each other compete to see which one can dance the longest (Mercier, 1927).<ref>[http://0-www.oxfordreference.com.library.lausys.georgetown.edu/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t171.e1157.s0001&srn=2&ssid=1017131773#FIRSTHIT ]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Song genres==\nThere are numerous kinds of songs that are sung during and specifically for dabke, by both men and women respectively, depending on the occasion, song, and audience. Some of the most popular of these songs, such as ''Dal Ouna'' ''(\u062f\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646\u0627)'', ''Al Jafra'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0641\u0631\u0627)'', ''Al Dahiyya'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062f\u062d\u064a\u0629)'', and ''Zareef il-Tool'' ''(\u0638\u0631\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0648\u0644)'', are actually entire genres in themselves, in the sense that lyrics can vary significantly in each performance but the basic rhythm of the music is consistent and recognizable. This variation can be seen in the hundreds of lyrical variations heard and recorded of these songs which regardless of specific lyrics, are recognized by their rhythm and at times, a single phrase, as in ''Ala Dal Ouna, Jafra'', and others. For example, even though one might have heard ''Ala Dal Ouna'' sung previously telling a different story in this famous love song, people will still call another song ascribing to the same rhythm and theme as ''Dal Ouna''.<ref>\u0648\u0644\u064a\u062f \u0631\u0628\u064a\u0639, \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0628\u0648\u0647\u0630\u0628\u0627, \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u062d\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0646, \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f. <u>\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u0631\u0645\u0633\u0639\u064a\u0627</u>. \"\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u063a\u0627\u0646\u064a\".</ref>\n\nThe majority of dabke music, being folk songs, is on [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] [[Bayati (maqam)|Bayati]] musical mode.\n\n==Instruments==\nThe [[Oud]] ''(\u0639\u0648\u062f)'', from which the English word \"lute\" comes,  is shaped like half a pear with a short non-fretted neck. It has six courses of two strings and played with a plectrum, usually a trimmed eagle's feather. This instrument creates a deep and mellow sound.\n\nThe [[mijwiz]] ''(\u0645\u062c\u0648\u0632)'' which means \u201cdouble\u201d in Arabic is very popular in Levantine music. It is a type of reed clarinet that is played by breathing smoothly through a circular aperture at the end and by moving the fingers over the holes down the front of the tube in order to create the different notes. The minjjayrah is similar to the mijwiz, an open ended reed flute played in the same style.\n\nThe [[tablah]] ''(\u0637\u0628\u0644\u0629)'' is a small hand-drum also known as the durbakke. Most tablahs are beautifully decorated, some with wood, tile or bone inlay, etched metal, or paintings in designs typical of the Near East. One of the most commonly played of the percussion instruments; the tablah is a membranophone of goat or fish skin stretched over a vase-shaped drum with a wide neck. Usually made of earthenware or metal, it is placed either under the left arm or between the legs and struck in the middle for the strong beats and on the edge for the sharp in-between beats. Though today fishskin heads are rarely used due to the climate. When used it becomes loose, you would have to heat the head to get the correct sound back. The membrane or head of the drum is now made out of plastic. The most common head is from Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nThe [[daf]]f ''(\u062f\u0641)'', also known as the [[Riq]] ''(\u0631\u0642)'', is similar to the tambourine. It consists of a round frame, covered on one side with goat or fish skin. Pairs of metal discs are set into the frame to produce the jingle when struck by the hand. The sounds of this percussion instrument set the rhythm of much Arab music, particularly in the performances of classical pieces.<ref>Badley, Bill and Zein al Jundi. \"Europe Meets Asia\". 2000.

Unlike the ''mijwiz'', it only has finger holes in one of its pipes/reeds. (see ''Al-Shamaliyya'', under Types).\n\nThe Shubabeh, (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"ltr\">\u0634\u0628\u0627\u0628\u0629</span>) is a woodwind instrument traditionally made from reed cane. It differs from the Mijwiz and Arghul in that it does not have a reed, instead the musician blows against the side of the instrument at an angle to produce the tone. The Shubabeh is traditionally played by herders in the wilderness.\n\n==Performances and competitions==\n[[File:Palestinian Dabke.jpg|thumb|Men dancing dabke]]\n''Dabke'' competitions or shows  consist of different cultural dances and various troupes performing ''dabke.'' For example, the International Fiesta, a well known festival at the [[University at Buffalo]], consists of a series of clubs performing their cultural dances. This competition occurs every semester in the main stage theater of the [[UB Center for the Arts]] during the spring time, usually at the end of February or beginning of March. This allows the Organization of Arab Students to participate and show the cultural awareness of ''dabke''.\n\nMany universities host events called Arab Night or a title to that effect. When these shows occur, ''dabke'' is either performed on stage (inside or outside), in a hall on the floor, or outside on the floor. There are different steps that comprise the ''Dabke'' dance: the belbel, the inzel, shemmel and taxi; a combination of each of these steps as well as the occasional jump and turn make the dance complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&cat=Artamp;Culture&article=987 |title=Dabke appeals to Westerners, Arabs alike |website=Arabamericannews.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref>\n\nIn America, the tradition has not been lost and is held in the same places as it would in the original homeland and the dance music is also commonly played in America at Arab-community cultural centers and conventions such as the annual convention hosted by the American Federation of Ramallah Palestine.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19970529223911/http://www.afrp.org/]</ref>\n\n==World records==\nIn August 2011, a group in a Lebanese village [[Dhour El Choueir]], [[Lebanon]] set a new world record.

The dirt roof had to be compacted which required stomping the dirt hard in a uniform way to compact it evenly. This event of cooperation is called ''ta'awon'' and from here comes the word ''awneh'', meaning \"help.\" This developed into the song ''Ala Dalouna'' ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062f\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646\u0627}}), roughly translated, \"let's go and help\". The Dabke and the rhythmic songs go together in an attempt to keep the work fun and the workers energetic.\nAccording to Yazbec, the Canaanites and Phoenicians were the first teachers of the dance in the world, and the dabke is a representative descendant of the Phoenician dances.<ref name=\"Dabke Origin\">{{cite book|title=The Arab World, Volume 8|date=1962|publisher=Arab Information Center|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=rbcwU7nSAcKfyQHZlIHoBw&id=HlbVAAAAMAAJ&dq=}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n\nIn levant there are around 19 types of The  Dabke and many of them are performed in Palestine, jordan  Syria and Lebanon. But Lebanon has 3 variations of Dabke native to specific villages in Lebanon only. Different Levantine types include but are not limited to:<ref name=\"allofjo.net\"/>\n\n<br />\n\n* \n\n'''1.Daloonah''' is the most common variation and it's Native to Mount Lebanon. It comprises six beats and is typically accompanied by a ''minjeira'' or ''mizmar'' (types of flutes) and the ''tabel'' (drum). Clapping is used to add joy to the festivities.\n\n'''2.Ra\u2019asit el Aarjah''' (limping dance) is native to Baalbeck. It is slower than the common ''dabke'' as it comprises 12 beats. The music is usually a combination of ''minjeira'' or ''mijwiz'' or ''rabehbeh'' (violin-like instrument) and ''tabel''. Any combination can also be accompanied by clapping.\n\n'''3.Metalteh''' is characteristic of Barja, a southern village in Lebanon . It is composed of 16 beats and the music is a mix of ''minjeira'' and ''tabel''.\n\n<br />\n{{Div col}}\n* ''' Habel Mwadea\u2019 ''' '''(\u062d\u0628\u0644 \u0645\u0648\u062f\u0639)''': is the Jordanian dabke of any type performed by men and women jointly.<ref name=\"allofjo.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allofjo.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12074:2011-05-21-20-17-50&catid=51:2010-06-06-04-19-21&Itemid=263 |title=\u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0646 |website=Allofjo.net |date= |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref> \n* '''Al-Karaadiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629)'' also known as ''Al-Taiyyara'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0629)'': It is on of the most famous types of dabke in Jordan, it is characterized by its fast rhythm in an open circle.

It consists of a ''lawweeh'' ''(\u0644\u0648\u064a\u062d)'' at the head of a group of men holding hands and formed in a semicircle. The ''lawweeh'' is expected to be particularly skilled in accuracy, ability to improvise, and quickness (generally light on his feet). Typically, the dabke begins with a musician playing a solo on the ''mijwiz'' or ''yarghoul'' of a ''Dal Ouna'' piece, often with two singers accompanying his music. The dancers develop a synchronized movement and step and when the singers finish their song, the ''lawweeh'' breaks from the semicircle to dance on his own. When the leader of the dabke sees that the men's steps are one, in sync, he instructs the dancers to slow down and begin a movement crossing their right foot in front of the opposite one (their left foot). The ''lawweeh'' continues to inform the dancers of their basic rhythms, and at this point other guests at the wedding or event occurring will join in the dabke line. This is the most popular and familiar form of dabke danced for happy family celebrations, such as weddings, circumcisions, the return of travelers, release of prisoners, and also for national holidays, in which dabke becomes a demonstration of national personality.<ref name=\"layla\">\u0647\u0634\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0627\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0639\u062f \u0648\u0645\u0623\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0639\u062f. \u0641\u0648\u0643\u0644\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0633 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0628\u064a: \u0644\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0646\u0627>.\u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0641\u0648\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644.</ref>\n* '''Al-\u2019Askariyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0633\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0629)'': \n* '''Al-Joufiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0629)'': it consists of two groups stand in opposition to each other: the first group sings and the second responses with Jordanian folkloric songs.\n* '''Al-Ghawarneh''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0646\u0629)'' also known as ''Deir \u2019Ala''  ''(\u062f\u064a\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0627)'': performed in [[Jordan Valley]], and it's one of the fastest types of dabke.\n* '''Wahad w Nos''' ''(\u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0648\u0646\u0635)''\n* '''Abu \u2019Alanda''' ''(\u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0639\u0644\u0646\u062f\u0647)''\n* '''Al-Aqabawiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0628\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629)'': It is performed in [[Aqaba]] in South Jordan.\n* '''Al-Ramthawiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0645\u062b\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629)'': It is performed in [[Ramtha]] in North Jordan.\n* '''Al-Sahja''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0633\u062d\u062c\u0629)'' : is a popular Palestinian and Jordanian dance which became significantly more popular during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]].

Another type is the ''dabke niswaniyyah'', danced specifically by women. Each type of dabke dance has its own corresponding set of songs, the theme of which is often love.<ref name=Cohenp271>Cohen, Katz, 2006, pp. 271\u2013274.</ref>\n\nThere are six main types of dabke:\n\n# ''Al-Shamaliyya'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0629)'': is probably the most famous type of dabke. It consists of a ''lawweeh'' ''(\u0644\u0648\u064a\u062d)'' at the head of a group of men holding hands and formed in a semicircle. The ''lawweeh'' is expected to be particularly skilled in accuracy, ability to improvise, and quickness (generally light on his feet). Typically, the dabke begins with a musician playing a solo on the ''mijwiz'' or ''yarghoul'' of a ''Dal Ouna'' piece, often with two singers accompanying his music. The dancers develop a synchronized movement and step and when the singers finish their song, the ''lawweeh'' breaks from the semicircle to dance on his own. When the leader of the dabke sees that the men's steps are one, in sync, he instructs the dancers to slow down and begin a movement crossing their right foot in front of the opposite one (their left foot). The ''lawweeh'' continues to inform the dancers of their basic rhythms, and at this point other guests at the wedding or event occurring will join in the dabke line. This is the most popular and familiar form of dabke danced for happy family celebrations, such as weddings, circumcisions, the return of travelers, release of prisoners, and also for national holidays, in which dabke becomes a demonstration of national personality.<ref name=\"layla\"/>\n# ''Al-Sha\u2019rawiyya'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629)'': is limited to men and is characterized by strong steps or stomps.

Al-Sahja belongs mostly to northern and central Palestine, and in the south has two kinds: As-Samir ''(\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0645\u0631)'' and Al-Dahiyya ''(\u0627\u0644\u062f\u062d\u064a\u0629)''.

''Al-Sahja'' usually occurs the night before the wedding party of the groom (''zafat al-'arees''), with most of the men in the village participating, especially those who will be attending or are directly involved in the other wedding festivities.\n\nThe ''Oxford International Encyclopedia of Dance'' also mentions these additional kinds of line dances in its entry under \"Middle East\":\n\n<blockquote>The ''Murdah'' was originally performed by women in [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] while the men of the community were away on extended fishing and pearling expeditions. It involves two lines of dancers who move toward each other with small steps and then retreat while singing rhymed couplets. These couplets were largely laments for absent loved ones. Although seafaring is no longer economically important in the region, women continue to perform this dance at social gatherings.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The ''Ahwash'' (Fr., ahouache) performed by Berber tribes of the Moroccan High Atlas Mountains, includes one or several curved lines of men and one or several curved lines of women, the whole forming a circle or ellipse around male drummers (Jouad and Lortat-Jacob, 1978; Lortat-Jacob, 1980). One line recites a poem that the other line responds to with another poem; then all move to the beat of the drums. Customarily, the whole community participates. While performing, women dancers hold themselves very straight and move with staccato steps, holding onto the weaving rod of the house. Women as well as men compose the poetry that is recited. A similar dance reported for Morocco is the dukkala. In one variation a man and woman facing each other compete to see which one can dance the longest (Mercier, 1927).<ref>[http://0-www.oxfordreference.com.library.lausys.georgetown.edu/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t171.e1157.s0001&srn=2&ssid=1017131773#FIRSTHIT ]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Song genres==\nThere are numerous kinds of songs that are sung during and specifically for dabke, by both men and women respectively, depending on the occasion, song, and audience. Some of the most popular of these songs, such as ''Dal Ouna'' ''(\u062f\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646\u0627)'', ''Al Jafra'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0641\u0631\u0627)'', ''Al Dahiyya'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062f\u062d\u064a\u0629)'', and ''Zareef il-Tool'' ''(\u0638\u0631\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0648\u0644)'', are actually entire genres in themselves, in the sense that lyrics can vary significantly in each performance but the basic rhythm of the music is consistent and recognizable. This variation can be seen in the hundreds of lyrical variations heard and recorded of these songs which regardless of specific lyrics, are recognized by their rhythm and at times, a single phrase, as in ''Ala Dal Ouna, Jafra'', and others. For example, even though one might have heard ''Ala Dal Ouna'' sung previously telling a different story in this famous love song, people will still call another song ascribing to the same rhythm and theme as ''Dal Ouna''.<ref>\u0648\u0644\u064a\u062f \u0631\u0628\u064a\u0639, \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0628\u0648\u0647\u0630\u0628\u0627, \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u062d\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0646, \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f. <u>\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u0631\u0645\u0633\u0639\u064a\u0627</u>. \"\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u063a\u0627\u0646\u064a\".</ref>\n\nThe majority of dabke music, being folk songs, is on [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] [[Bayati (maqam)|Bayati]] musical mode.\n\n==Instruments==\nThe [[Oud]] ''(\u0639\u0648\u062f)'', from which the English word \"lute\" comes,  is shaped like half a pear with a short non-fretted neck. It has six courses of two strings and played with a plectrum, usually a trimmed eagle's feather. This instrument creates a deep and mellow sound.\n\nThe [[mijwiz]] ''(\u0645\u062c\u0648\u0632)'' which means \u201cdouble\u201d in Arabic is very popular in Levantine music. It is a type of reed clarinet that is played by breathing smoothly through a circular aperture at the end and by moving the fingers over the holes down the front of the tube in order to create the different notes. The minjjayrah is similar to the mijwiz, an open ended reed flute played in the same style.\n\nThe [[tablah]] ''(\u0637\u0628\u0644\u0629)'' is a small hand-drum also known as the durbakke. Most tablahs are beautifully decorated, some with wood, tile or bone inlay, etched metal, or paintings in designs typical of the Near East. One of the most commonly played of the percussion instruments; the tablah is a membranophone of goat or fish skin stretched over a vase-shaped drum with a wide neck. Usually made of earthenware or metal, it is placed either under the left arm or between the legs and struck in the middle for the strong beats and on the edge for the sharp in-between beats. Though today fishskin heads are rarely used due to the climate. When used it becomes loose, you would have to heat the head to get the correct sound back. The membrane or head of the drum is now made out of plastic. The most common head is from Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nThe [[daf]]f ''(\u062f\u0641)'', also known as the [[Riq]] ''(\u0631\u0642)'', is similar to the tambourine. It consists of a round frame, covered on one side with goat or fish skin. Pairs of metal discs are set into the frame to produce the jingle when struck by the hand. The sounds of this percussion instrument set the rhythm of much Arab music, particularly in the performances of classical pieces.<ref>Badley, Bill and Zein al Jundi. \"Europe Meets Asia\". 2000.

Rough Guides Ltd, Penguin Books. {{ISBN|1-85828-636-0}}</ref>\n\nThe [[arghul]], ''(\u064a\u0631\u063a\u0648\u0644)'' also known as the ''yarghoul'', is commonly used in solos, often accompanied by singers, that begin dabke performances. Unlike the ''mijwiz'', it only has finger holes in one of its pipes/reeds. (see ''Al-Shamaliyya'', under Types).\n\nThe Shubabeh, (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"ltr\">\u0634\u0628\u0627\u0628\u0629</span>) is a woodwind instrument traditionally made from reed cane. It differs from the Mijwiz and Arghul in that it does not have a reed, instead the musician blows against the side of the instrument at an angle to produce the tone. The Shubabeh is traditionally played by herders in the wilderness.\n\n==Performances and competitions==\n[[File:Palestinian Dabke.jpg|thumb|Men dancing dabke]]\n''Dabke'' competitions or shows  consist of different cultural dances and various troupes performing ''dabke.'' For example, the International Fiesta, a well known festival at the [[University at Buffalo]], consists of a series of clubs performing their cultural dances. This competition occurs every semester in the main stage theater of the [[UB Center for the Arts]] during the spring time, usually at the end of February or beginning of March. This allows the Organization of Arab Students to participate and show the cultural awareness of ''dabke''.\n\nMany universities host events called Arab Night or a title to that effect. When these shows occur, ''dabke'' is either performed on stage (inside or outside), in a hall on the floor, or outside on the floor. There are different steps that comprise the ''Dabke'' dance: the belbel, the inzel, shemmel and taxi; a combination of each of these steps as well as the occasional jump and turn make the dance complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&cat=Artamp;Culture&article=987 |title=Dabke appeals to Westerners, Arabs alike |website=Arabamericannews.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref>\n\nIn America, the tradition has not been lost and is held in the same places as it would in the original homeland and the dance music is also commonly played in America at Arab-community cultural centers and conventions such as the annual convention hosted by the American Federation of Ramallah Palestine.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19970529223911/http://www.afrp.org/]</ref>\n\n==World records==\nIn August 2011, a group in a Lebanese village [[Dhour El Choueir]], [[Lebanon]] set a new world record.

Both books follow exploits of Bender and his associates looking for treasure amidst the contemporary Soviet reality. They were written and are set in the relatively liberal era in Soviet history,  the [[New Economic Policy]] of the 1920s.

It also gives the authors a convenient platform from which to look at this society and to make fun of its less attractive and less Socialist aspects. These are among the most widely read and quoted books in Russian culture. ''The Twelve Chairs'' was adapted for [[The Twelve Chairs (disambiguation)|ca. twenty movies]], in the USSR (by [[Leonid Gaidai]] and by [[Mark Zakharov]]), in the US (in particular by [[Mel Brooks]]), and in other countries.\n\nFrom the late 1920s to 1937, the co-authors wrote several theatrical plays and screenplays, as well as many humorous short stories and satirical articles in the magazines: ''Chudak'', ''30 days'', ''[[Krokodil]]'', ''[[Ogoniok]]'', the newspapers: ''[[Pravda]]'', ''[[Literaturnaya Gazeta]]''. In the first years of joint creativity Ilf and Petrov published their stories and satirical under parodic [[pseudonym]]s: ''Tolstoevsky''  (composed of the names of writers [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]]), ''Don Busilio'' (from Don Basilio, character in the opera ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'', and the Russian verb ''busa'' \u2013 scandal, noise), ''Cold philosopher'' and others.<ref>[[:ru:\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0418\u043b\u044c\u0438 \u0418\u043b\u044c\u0444\u0430 \u0438 \u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430|List of works by Ilf and Petrov]].</ref>\n\nThe two writers also traveled across the [[Great Depression]]-era United States.

Nevertheless, licensing became a profitable move and began a trend to continue \"for decades to come\",<ref name=\"funding\"/> which all couture houses followed.<ref name=\"dior\"/>\n\nAlso in 1950, Christian Dior was the exclusive designer of [[Marlene Dietrich]]'s dresses in the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Stage Fright (1950 film)|Stage Fright]]''. In 1951, Dior released his first book, ''Je Suis Couturier'' (''I am a Couturier'') through publishers Editions du Conquistador.

In honour of [[Princess Margaret]] and the [[Frances Spencer-Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Duchess of Marlborough]], a Dior fashion show was held at the Blemhein Palace in 1954 as well.

This possibility was not received graciously by Dior licensees and the French fashion industry; the Maison Dior was too important to the financial stability of the industry to allow such an action. To bring the label back on its feet, Rou\u00ebt promoted the 21-year-old [[Yves Saint-Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint-Laurent]] to Artistic Director the same year.<ref name=\"funding\"/> Laurent had joined the House's family in 1955 after being picked out by the original designer himself for the position of the first ever and only Head Assistant.<ref name=\"dior\"/><ref name=\"funding\"/> Laurent initially proved to have been the most appropriate choice after the debut of his first collection for Dior (the mention of ''Dior'' from this moment on refers to the company) in 1958.<ref name=\"funding\"/> The clothes were as meticulously made and perfectly proportioned as Dior's in the same exquisite fabrics, but their young designer made them softer, lighter and easier to wear. Saint Laurent was hailed as a national hero. Emboldened by his success, his designs became more daring, culminating in the 1960 [[Beat poetry|Beat]] Look inspired by the [[existentialists]] in the [[Saint-Germain des Pr\u00e8s]] caf\u00e9s and jazz clubs. His 1960 [[bohemian]] look was harshly criticized, and even more in ''Women's Wear Daily''.<ref name=\"funding\"/> Marcel Boussac was furious, and in the spring, when Saint Laurent was called up to join the French army\u2014which forced him to leave the House of Dior\u2014the Dior management raised no objection.

Bohan instilled his conservative style on the collections. He was credited by Rebecca Arnold as the man who kept the Dior label \"at the forefront of fashion while still producing wearable, elegant clothes,\" and Women's Wear Daily, not surprisingly, claimed that he \"rescued the firm.\"<ref name=\"funding\"/> Bohan's designs were very well esteemed by prominent social figures. Actress [[Elizabeth Taylor]] ordered twelve Dior dresses from Bohan's Spring-Summer 1961 collection featuring the \"Slim Look\". The Dior perfume \"Diorling\" was released in 1963 and the men's fragrance \"[[Eau Sauvage]]\" was released in 1966.<ref name=\"dior\"/> Bohan's assistant Philippe Guibourg\u00e9 launches the first French [[ready-to-wear]] collection \"Miss Dior\" in 1967. This is not to be confused with the already existing New York Ready-to-Wear store established in 1948. Designed by Bohan, \"Baby Dior\" opens its first boutique in 1967 at 28 Avenue Montaigne. The Christian Dior Coordinated Knit line is released in 1968 and management of the Fashion Furs Department of Christian Dior is taken by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Castet.<ref name=\"dior\"/> This year as well, Dior Parfums was sold to [[LVMH|Mo\u00ebt-Hennessy]] (which would itself become [[LVMH]]) due to Boussac's ailing textile company (the still-owner of Dior).<ref name=\"dior\"/><ref name=\"funding\"/> This, however, had no effect on the House of Dior operations, and so the ''Christian Dior Cosmetics'' business was born in 1969 with the creation of an exclusive line.\n\nFollowing this, Bohan launched the first ''Christian [[Dior Homme]]'' clothing line in 1970. A new Dior boutique at Parly II was decorated by Gae Aulenti and the \"Diorella\" perfume was released in 1972. Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Fur Collection was created in France in 1973, and then manufactured under license in the United States, Canada, and Japan.<ref name=\"dior\"/> The first Dior watch \"Black Moon\" was released in 1975 in collaboration with licensee Benedom. Dior haute-couture graced the bodies of [[Princess Grace of Monaco]], Nicaraguan First Lady [[Hope Portocarrero]], [[Princess Alexandria of Yugoslavia]], and [[Lady Pamela Hicks]] ([[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten of Burma]]'s younger daughter) for the wedding of [[The Prince of Wales]] and [[Lady Diana Spencer]]. In 1978, the Boussac Group filed for bankruptcy and so its assets (including those of Christian Dior) were purchased by the Willot Group under the permission of the [[Paris Trade Court]].<ref name=\"dior\"/> The perfume \"Dioressence\" was released in 1979.<ref name=\"dior\"/>\n\n===Arrival of businessman Arnault===\n[[File:DiorBohan1.JPG|right|thumb|upright=.69|A simple Dior Haute Couture evening gown designed by [[Marc Bohan]], from the Spring 1983 collection]]\nIn 1980, Dior released the men's fragrance \"Jules\".<ref name=\"dior\"/> After the Willot Group went into bankruptcy in 1981, [[Bernard Arnault]] and his investment group purchased it for \"one symbolic franc\" in December 1984.<ref name=\"dior\"/><ref name=\"funding\"/> The Dior perfume \"Poison\" was launched in 1985. That same year, Arnault became chairman, chief executive officer, and managing director of the company.<ref name=\"dior\"/> On assuming leadership, Arnault did away with the company's mediocre textile operations, to focus on the Bon March\u00e9 department store and Christian Dior Couture. Operations for Christian Dior drastically changed for the better under Arnault. He repositioned it as the [[holding company]] Christian Dior S.A. of the Dior Couture fashion business.<ref name=\"funding\"/> On the 40th anniversary of Dior's first collection, the [[Paris Fashion Museum]] dedicated an exhibition to Christian Dior.<ref name=\"dior\"/> In 1988, Arnault's Christian Dior S.A.'s took a 32% equity stake into the share capital of [[LVMH|Mo\u00ebt-Hennessy \u2022 Louis Vuitton]] through its subsidiary [[Jacques Rober]], creating what would become one of the leading and most influential [[luxury good]]s companies in the world. Under this milestone merger, the operations of Christian Dior Couture and Christian Dior Parfums were once again united. Italian-born [[Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9]] replaced Bohan as head designer in 1989.<ref name=\"funding\"/> The first such non-[[Frenchmen|Frenchman]], Ferr\u00e9 left behind traditional Dior associations of flirtation and romance, and introduced concepts and a style described as \"refined, sober and strict.\"<ref name=\"funding\"/> Ferr\u00e9 headed design for Haute Couture, Haute Fourrure, Women's Ready-to-Wear, Ready-to-Wear Furs and Women's Accessories collections. His first collection was awarded the [[D\u00e9 d'Or]] in 1989.<ref name=\"dior\"/> That year, a boutique was opened in Hawaii and the LVMH stake by Jacques Rober rose to 44%.<ref name=\"dior\"/>\n\nFurther Dior boutiques were opened in 1990 in upscale New York City, Los Angeles, and Tokyo shopping districts. The stake in LVMH rose again, to 46%.<ref name=\"dior\"/> Another collection of watches named \"Bagheera\"&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by the round design of the \"Black Moon\" watches&nbsp;\u2013 was also released in 1990. Having fired the company's managing executive Beatrice Bongbault in December 1990, Arnault took up that position until September 1991, when he placed former Bon March\u00e9 president Phillipe Vindry at the post.<ref name=\"funding\"/> In 1991, Christian Dior was listed on the spot market and then on the [[Paris Stock Exchange]]'s monthly settlement market, and the perfume \"Dune\" was launched.<ref name=\"dior\"/> Vindry dropped ready-to-wear prices by 10%. Still, a wool suit from Dior would come with a price label of USD 1,500.<ref name=\"funding\"/> 1990 revenue for Dior was USD 129.3&nbsp;million, with a net income of $22&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"funding\"/> Dior was now reorganized into three categories: 1) women's ready-to-wear, lingerie, and children's wear 2) accessories and jewelry 3) menswear. Licensees and franchised boutiques were starting to be reduced, to increase the company's control over brand product. Licensing was in fact reduced by nearly half because Arnault and Vindry opted \"for quality and exclusivity over quantity and accessibility.\"<ref name=\"funding\"/> Wholly company-owned boutiques now opened in Hong Kong, Singapore, [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Cannes]], and [[Waikiki]], adding to its core stores located in New York City, Hawaii, Paris and [[Geneva]]. This held a potential to increase direct sales and profit margins while maintaining high-profile locations.\"<ref name=\"funding\"/> In 1992, Dior Homme was placed under the artistic direction of Patrick Lavoix, and the \"Miss Dior\" perfume was relaunched.<ref name=\"dior\"/> Francois Baufume succeeded Vindry in 1993 and continued to reduce licenses of the Dior name.<ref name=\"funding\"/>\n[[File:Grey leather and fur gloves by Christian Dior in box.jpg|left|thumbnail|Leather gloves by Christian Dior]]\n\nThe production of Dior Haute Couture was spun off into a subsidiary named ''Christian Dior Couture'' in 1995.<ref name=\"dior\"/> Also, the \"La Parisienne\" watch model was released \u2013 embodied in the watch \"Parisian Chic\". By that year, revenue for the label rose to USD 177 million, with a net income of USD 26.9&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"funding\"/> Under the influence of Anna Wintour, editor and chief of Vogue, CEO Arnault appointed British designer [[John Galliano]] to replace [[Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9]] in 1997 (Galliano on [[CBS News]]: \"without Anna Wintour I would certainly not be at the house of Dior\").<ref name=\"dior\"/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/05/14/60minutes/main5013905.shtml | publisher=[[CBS News]] | title=Anna Wintour, Behind The Shades | date=14 May 2009 | access-date=4 November 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114061328/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/05/14/60minutes/main5013905.shtml | archive-date=14 November 2010 | url-status=live }}</ref> This choice of a British designer, once again instead of a French one, is said to have \"ruffled some French feathers\". Arnault himself stated that he \"would have preferred a Frenchman\", but that \"talent has no nationality\".<ref name=\"funding\"/> He even compared Galliano to Christian Dior himself, noting that \"Galliano has a creative talent very close to that of Christian Dior. He has the same extraordinary mixture of romanticism, feminism, and modernity that symbolised Monsieur Dior. In all of his creations \u2013 his suits, his dresses \u2013 one finds similarities to the Dior style.\"<ref name=\"funding\"/> Galliano sparked further interest in Dior with somewhat controversial fashion shows, such as \"Homeless Show\" (models dressed in newspapers and paper bags) or \"S&M Show\".<ref name=\"funding\"/> Meanwhile, Dior licenses were being reduced further by new president and CEO Sidney Toledano.<ref name=\"funding\"/> On 15 October 1997, the Dior headquarters store on Avenue Montaigne was reopened&nbsp;\u2013it had been closed and remodeled by [[Peter Marino]]&nbsp;\u2013 in a celebrity-studded event including [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Demi Moore]] and [[Jacques Chirac]].

This time the store opened its doors on the Left Bank, Place Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s. Also this year, Victoire de Castellane became lead designer of ''Dior Fine Jewellery'' and the first Dior Fine Jewellery boutique opened in New York City. Paris itself would witness the opening of the first Parisian Dior Fine Jewellery boutique the following year, at 28 Avenue Montaigne.<ref name=\"dior\"/> The perfume \"[[J'Adore (fragrance)|J'adore]]\" was released in 1999,<ref name=\"dior\"/> and on 5 October 1999, Galliano released the Dior Spring-Summer 2000 ready-to-wear fashion show, debuting the new Saddle bag. In the same year, Dior's long watch partner Benedom joined the [[LVMH]] group. In 2000, Galliano's leadership was extended to Ready to wear, accessories, advertising and communications.

Nevertheless, licensing became a profitable move and began a trend to continue \"for decades to come\",<ref name=\"funding\"/> which all couture houses followed.<ref name=\"dior\"/>\n\nAlso in 1950, Christian Dior was the exclusive designer of [[Marlene Dietrich]]'s dresses in the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Stage Fright (1950 film)|Stage Fright]]''. In 1951, Dior released his first book, ''Je Suis Couturier'' (''I am a Couturier'') through publishers Editions du Conquistador.

In honour of [[Princess Margaret]] and the [[Frances Spencer-Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Duchess of Marlborough]], a Dior fashion show was held at the Blemhein Palace in 1954 as well.

This possibility was not received graciously by Dior licensees and the French fashion industry; the Maison Dior was too important to the financial stability of the industry to allow such an action. To bring the label back on its feet, Rou\u00ebt promoted the 21-year-old [[Yves Saint-Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint-Laurent]] to Artistic Director the same year.<ref name=\"funding\"/> Laurent had joined the House's family in 1955 after being picked out by the original designer himself for the position of the first ever and only Head Assistant.<ref name=\"dior\"/><ref name=\"funding\"/> Laurent initially proved to have been the most appropriate choice after the debut of his first collection for Dior (the mention of ''Dior'' from this moment on refers to the company) in 1958.<ref name=\"funding\"/> The clothes were as meticulously made and perfectly proportioned as Dior's in the same exquisite fabrics, but their young designer made them softer, lighter and easier to wear. Saint Laurent was hailed as a national hero. Emboldened by his success, his designs became more daring, culminating in the 1960 [[Beat poetry|Beat]] Look inspired by the [[existentialists]] in the [[Saint-Germain des Pr\u00e8s]] caf\u00e9s and jazz clubs. His 1960 [[bohemian]] look was harshly criticized, and even more in ''Women's Wear Daily''.<ref name=\"funding\"/> Marcel Boussac was furious, and in the spring, when Saint Laurent was called up to join the French army\u2014which forced him to leave the House of Dior\u2014the Dior management raised no objection.

Bohan instilled his conservative style on the collections. He was credited by Rebecca Arnold as the man who kept the Dior label \"at the forefront of fashion while still producing wearable, elegant clothes,\" and Women's Wear Daily, not surprisingly, claimed that he \"rescued the firm.\"<ref name=\"funding\"/> Bohan's designs were very well esteemed by prominent social figures. Actress [[Elizabeth Taylor]] ordered twelve Dior dresses from Bohan's Spring-Summer 1961 collection featuring the \"Slim Look\". The Dior perfume \"Diorling\" was released in 1963 and the men's fragrance \"[[Eau Sauvage]]\" was released in 1966.<ref name=\"dior\"/> Bohan's assistant Philippe Guibourg\u00e9 launches the first French [[ready-to-wear]] collection \"Miss Dior\" in 1967. This is not to be confused with the already existing New York Ready-to-Wear store established in 1948. Designed by Bohan, \"Baby Dior\" opens its first boutique in 1967 at 28 Avenue Montaigne. The Christian Dior Coordinated Knit line is released in 1968 and management of the Fashion Furs Department of Christian Dior is taken by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Castet.<ref name=\"dior\"/> This year as well, Dior Parfums was sold to [[LVMH|Mo\u00ebt-Hennessy]] (which would itself become [[LVMH]]) due to Boussac's ailing textile company (the still-owner of Dior).<ref name=\"dior\"/><ref name=\"funding\"/> This, however, had no effect on the House of Dior operations, and so the ''Christian Dior Cosmetics'' business was born in 1969 with the creation of an exclusive line.\n\nFollowing this, Bohan launched the first ''Christian [[Dior Homme]]'' clothing line in 1970. A new Dior boutique at Parly II was decorated by Gae Aulenti and the \"Diorella\" perfume was released in 1972. Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Fur Collection was created in France in 1973, and then manufactured under license in the United States, Canada, and Japan.<ref name=\"dior\"/> The first Dior watch \"Black Moon\" was released in 1975 in collaboration with licensee Benedom.

In 1978, the Boussac Group filed for bankruptcy and so its assets (including those of Christian Dior) were purchased by the Willot Group under the permission of the [[Paris Trade Court]].<ref name=\"dior\"/> The perfume \"Dioressence\" was released in 1979.<ref name=\"dior\"/>\n\n===Arrival of businessman Arnault===\n[[File:DiorBohan1.JPG|right|thumb|upright=.69|A simple Dior Haute Couture evening gown designed by [[Marc Bohan]], from the Spring 1983 collection]]\nIn 1980, Dior released the men's fragrance \"Jules\".<ref name=\"dior\"/> After the Willot Group went into bankruptcy in 1981, [[Bernard Arnault]] and his investment group purchased it for \"one symbolic franc\" in December 1984.<ref name=\"dior\"/><ref name=\"funding\"/> The Dior perfume \"Poison\" was launched in 1985. That same year, Arnault became chairman, chief executive officer, and managing director of the company.<ref name=\"dior\"/> On assuming leadership, Arnault did away with the company's mediocre textile operations, to focus on the Bon March\u00e9 department store and Christian Dior Couture. Operations for Christian Dior drastically changed for the better under Arnault. He repositioned it as the [[holding company]] Christian Dior S.A. of the Dior Couture fashion business.<ref name=\"funding\"/> On the 40th anniversary of Dior's first collection, the [[Paris Fashion Museum]] dedicated an exhibition to Christian Dior.<ref name=\"dior\"/> In 1988, Arnault's Christian Dior S.A.'s took a 32% equity stake into the share capital of [[LVMH|Mo\u00ebt-Hennessy \u2022 Louis Vuitton]] through its subsidiary [[Jacques Rober]], creating what would become one of the leading and most influential [[luxury good]]s companies in the world. Under this milestone merger, the operations of Christian Dior Couture and Christian Dior Parfums were once again united. Italian-born [[Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9]] replaced Bohan as head designer in 1989.<ref name=\"funding\"/> The first such non-[[Frenchmen|Frenchman]], Ferr\u00e9 left behind traditional Dior associations of flirtation and romance, and introduced concepts and a style described as \"refined, sober and strict.\"<ref name=\"funding\"/> Ferr\u00e9 headed design for Haute Couture, Haute Fourrure, Women's Ready-to-Wear, Ready-to-Wear Furs and Women's Accessories collections. His first collection was awarded the [[D\u00e9 d'Or]] in 1989.<ref name=\"dior\"/> That year, a boutique was opened in Hawaii and the LVMH stake by Jacques Rober rose to 44%.<ref name=\"dior\"/>\n\nFurther Dior boutiques were opened in 1990 in upscale New York City, Los Angeles, and Tokyo shopping districts. The stake in LVMH rose again, to 46%.<ref name=\"dior\"/> Another collection of watches named \"Bagheera\"&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by the round design of the \"Black Moon\" watches&nbsp;\u2013 was also released in 1990. Having fired the company's managing executive Beatrice Bongbault in December 1990, Arnault took up that position until September 1991, when he placed former Bon March\u00e9 president Phillipe Vindry at the post.<ref name=\"funding\"/> In 1991, Christian Dior was listed on the spot market and then on the [[Paris Stock Exchange]]'s monthly settlement market, and the perfume \"Dune\" was launched.<ref name=\"dior\"/> Vindry dropped ready-to-wear prices by 10%. Still, a wool suit from Dior would come with a price label of USD 1,500.<ref name=\"funding\"/> 1990 revenue for Dior was USD 129.3&nbsp;million, with a net income of $22&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"funding\"/> Dior was now reorganized into three categories: 1) women's ready-to-wear, lingerie, and children's wear 2) accessories and jewelry 3) menswear. Licensees and franchised boutiques were starting to be reduced, to increase the company's control over brand product. Licensing was in fact reduced by nearly half because Arnault and Vindry opted \"for quality and exclusivity over quantity and accessibility.\"<ref name=\"funding\"/> Wholly company-owned boutiques now opened in Hong Kong, Singapore, [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Cannes]], and [[Waikiki]], adding to its core stores located in New York City, Hawaii, Paris and [[Geneva]]. This held a potential to increase direct sales and profit margins while maintaining high-profile locations.\"<ref name=\"funding\"/> In 1992, Dior Homme was placed under the artistic direction of Patrick Lavoix, and the \"Miss Dior\" perfume was relaunched.<ref name=\"dior\"/> Francois Baufume succeeded Vindry in 1993 and continued to reduce licenses of the Dior name.<ref name=\"funding\"/>\n[[File:Grey leather and fur gloves by Christian Dior in box.jpg|left|thumbnail|Leather gloves by Christian Dior]]\n\nThe production of Dior Haute Couture was spun off into a subsidiary named ''Christian Dior Couture'' in 1995.<ref name=\"dior\"/> Also, the \"La Parisienne\" watch model was released \u2013 embodied in the watch \"Parisian Chic\". By that year, revenue for the label rose to USD 177 million, with a net income of USD 26.9&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"funding\"/> Under the influence of Anna Wintour, editor and chief of Vogue, CEO Arnault appointed British designer [[John Galliano]] to replace [[Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9]] in 1997 (Galliano on [[CBS News]]: \"without Anna Wintour I would certainly not be at the house of Dior\").<ref name=\"dior\"/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/05/14/60minutes/main5013905.shtml | publisher=[[CBS News]] | title=Anna Wintour, Behind The Shades | date=14 May 2009 | access-date=4 November 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114061328/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/05/14/60minutes/main5013905.shtml | archive-date=14 November 2010 | url-status=live }}</ref> This choice of a British designer, once again instead of a French one, is said to have \"ruffled some French feathers\". Arnault himself stated that he \"would have preferred a Frenchman\", but that \"talent has no nationality\".<ref name=\"funding\"/> He even compared Galliano to Christian Dior himself, noting that \"Galliano has a creative talent very close to that of Christian Dior. He has the same extraordinary mixture of romanticism, feminism, and modernity that symbolised Monsieur Dior. In all of his creations \u2013 his suits, his dresses \u2013 one finds similarities to the Dior style.\"<ref name=\"funding\"/> Galliano sparked further interest in Dior with somewhat controversial fashion shows, such as \"Homeless Show\" (models dressed in newspapers and paper bags) or \"S&M Show\".<ref name=\"funding\"/> Meanwhile, Dior licenses were being reduced further by new president and CEO Sidney Toledano.<ref name=\"funding\"/> On 15 October 1997, the Dior headquarters store on Avenue Montaigne was reopened&nbsp;\u2013it had been closed and remodeled by [[Peter Marino]]&nbsp;\u2013 in a celebrity-studded event including [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Demi Moore]] and [[Jacques Chirac]].

In the same year, Dior's long watch partner Benedom joined the [[LVMH]] group. In 2000, Galliano's leadership was extended to Ready to wear, accessories, advertising and communications.

The Proudia \u201c250 A\u201d is the equivalent Fuga \u201c 250 GT\u201d, the \u201cProudia 250 VIP\u201d to the \"Fuga 250 VIP\u201d, and the \u201cProudia 370 VIP\u201d to the \u201cFuga 370 VIP\u201d.<ref name=\"Mitsubishi Proudia gazoo.com\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://gazoo.com/car/newcar/vehicle_info/Pages/detail.aspx?MAKER_CD=D&CARTYPE_CD=36&GENERATION=02&CARNAME=%E3%83%97%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A6%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%82%A2 |script-title=ja:\u4e09\u83f1 \u30d7\u30e9\u30a6\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2 2012\u5e7407\u6708\uff5e |publisher=gazoo.com |date=2016-08-30 |accessdate=2016-08-30 |language=ja }}</ref> The \u201cProudia 370 4WD\u201d is the equivalent to the \u201cFuga 370 GT Four\u201d, the first time the Proudia is offered with All-wheel-drive. The hybrid engine option offered on the Fuga is not offered on the Proudia, and is only available on the longer Dignity limousine. The term \"[[VIP style|VIP]]\" reflects a high status car in Japan.\n\nThe Proudia is cosmetically different from the Fuga, using a Mitsubishi specific grille and appearance items. Many of the items in the Fuga are also available in the Proudia, to include the pollen filter, Nissan\u2019s \u201cSafety Shield\u201d packages, such as intelligent cruise control, ECO pedal, intelligent brake assist, with optional items on Nissan-branded products also available on equivalent Proudia trim packages. Nissan\u2019s Garnet Black Pearl paint is not offered on the Proudia, with Mitsubishi offering a different color. Some of the optional interior equipment includes heated and ventilated front seats, power reclining rear seats, power [[Ottoman (furniture)|ottoman]] for the rear passenger opposite the driver, and HDD navigation combined with a [[telematics]] subscription service called \"[[CarWings]]\" in Japan.\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mitsubishi Dignity]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://gazoo.com/car/database/Pages/generation_list.aspx?MAKER_CD=D&CARTYPE_CD=36 Data on Proudia] {{in lang|ja}}\n\n{{commons category|Mitsubishi Proudia}}\n{{Mitsubishi Motors vehicles}}\n{{Mitsubishi Motors timeline 1980 to date}}\n\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Luxury vehicles]]\n[[Category:Mitsubishi Motors vehicles|Proudia]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Full-size vehicles]]\n[[Category:Flagship vehicles]]\n[[Category:Limousines]]\n", "name_user": "TKOIII", "label": "safe", "comment": "cats", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Proudia"}
