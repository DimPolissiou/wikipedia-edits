His experiments with plant [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] led to his establishing [[Mendelian inheritance|laws of inheritance]]. Genetics stimulated research to improve crop production through plant breeding.\n\nModern plant breeding is applied genetics, but its scientific basis is broader, covering [[molecular biology]], [[cell biology|cytology]], [[systematics]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]], [[entomology]], [[chemistry]], and [[statistics]] ([[biometrics]]). It has also developed its own technology.\n\n== Classical plant breeding ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2011}}\n{{For|the role of crossing and plant breeding in viticulture|Propagation of grapevines}}\n\n[[File:Wild Mustard Plant Selective Breeding.svg|thumb|Selective breeding enlarged desired traits of the wild cabbage plant (''[[Brassica oleracea]]'') over hundreds of years, resulting in dozens of today's agricultural crops.

Plants are crossbred to introduce [[Trait (biological)|traits]]/[[gene]]s from one variety or line into a new genetic background. For example, a [[mildew]]-resistant [[pea]] may be crossed with a high-yielding but susceptible pea, the goal of the cross being to introduce mildew resistance without losing the high-yield characteristics. Progeny from the cross would then be crossed with the high-yielding parent to ensure that the progeny were most like the high-yielding parent, ('''[[backcrossing]]'''). The progeny from that cross would then be tested for yield (selection, as described above) and mildew resistance and high-yielding resistant plants would be further developed. Plants may also be crossed with themselves to produce '''inbred''' varieties for breeding. Pollinators may be [[Pollinator exclusion experiment|excluded]] through the use of [[pollination bags]].\n\nClassical breeding relies largely on [[genetic recombination|homologous recombination]] between chromosomes to generate [[genetic diversity]]. The classical plant breeder may also make use of a number of ''in vitro'' techniques such as [[somatic fusion|protoplast fusion]], [[embryo rescue]] or [[mutagenesis]] (see below) to generate diversity and produce hybrid plants that would not exist in [[nature]].\n\nTraits that breeders have tried to incorporate into crop plants include:\n# Improved [[Quality (business)|quality]], such as increased nutrition, improved flavor, or greater beauty\n# Increased [[Crop yield|yield]] of the crop\n# Increased [[Physiological tolerance|tolerance]] of environmental pressures ([[salinity]], extreme [[temperature]], [[drought]])\n# Resistance to [[virus]]es, [[fungus|fungi]] and [[bacteria]]\n# Increased tolerance to [[insect]] pests\n# Increased tolerance of [[herbicide]]s\n# Longer storage period for the harvested crop\n\n=== Before World War II ===\n[[File:Gartons-1902-Catalogue.jpg|thumb|right|Garton's catalogue from 1902]]\n\nSuccessful commercial plant breeding concerns were founded from the late 19th century.{{clarify|and a citation that there were none before that time|date=October 2013}} [[Gartons Agricultural Plant Breeders]] in England was established in the 1890s by John Garton, who was one of the first to commercialize new varieties of agricultural crops created through cross-pollination.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.agri.ankara.edu.tr/fcrops/1289__PBARTSCIENCE.doc|title=Plant breeding|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021184545/http://www.agri.ankara.edu.tr/fcrops/1289__PBARTSCIENCE.doc|archivedate=2013-10-21}}</ref> The firm's first introduction was Abundance [[Oat]], one of the first agricultural grain varieties bred from a ''controlled'' cross, introduced to commerce in 1892.<ref>Spring Seed Catalogue 1899, Gartons Limited</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dGSj-CFxk-QC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Hybrid: The History and Science of Plant Breeding|author=Noel Kingsbury|year=2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=140|isbn=9780226437057}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, plant breeders realized that [[gregor mendel|Mendel's]]  findings on the non-random nature of [[Mendelian inheritance|inheritance]] could be applied to [[seedling]] populations produced through deliberate [[pollination]]s to predict the frequencies of different types. Wheat hybrids were bred to increase the crop production of [[Italy]] during the so-called \"[[Battle for Grain]]\" (1925\u20131940). [[Heterosis]] was explained by [[George Harrison Shull]]. It describes the tendency of the progeny of a specific cross to outperform both parents. The detection of the usefulness of heterosis for plant breeding has led to the development of inbred lines that reveal a heterotic yield advantage when they are crossed. [[Maize]] was the first species where heterosis was widely used to produce hybrids.\n\n[[statistics|Statistical]] methods were also developed to analyze gene action and distinguish heritable variation from variation caused by environment. In 1933 another important breeding technique, [[cytoplasmic male sterility]] (CMS), developed in maize, was described by [[Marcus Morton Rhoades]]. CMS is a maternally inherited trait that makes the plant produce sterile [[pollen]]. This enables the production of hybrids without the need for labor-intensive [[detasseling]].\n\nThese early breeding techniques resulted in large yield increase in the [[United States]] in the early 20th century. Similar yield increases were not produced elsewhere until after [[World War II]], the [[Green Revolution]] increased crop production in the developing world in the 1960s.\n\n=== After World War II ===\n[[File:FA Geisenheim22.jpg|thumb|In vitro-culture of Vitis (grapevine), [[Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute]]]]\nFollowing [[World War II]] a number of techniques were developed that allowed plant breeders to hybridize distantly related species, and artificially induce genetic diversity.\n\nWhen distantly related species are crossed, plant breeders make use of a number of [[plant tissue culture]] techniques to produce progeny from otherwise fruitless mating. Interspecific and intergeneric hybrids are produced from a cross of related species or genera that do not normally [[reproduction|sexually reproduce]] with each other. These crosses are referred to as ''Wide crosses''. For example, the [[cereal]] [[triticale]] is a [[wheat]] and [[rye]] hybrid. The cells in the plants derived from the first generation created from the cross contained an uneven number of chromosomes and as result was sterile. The [[cell division]] inhibitor [[colchicine]] was used to double the number of [[chromosome]]s in the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] and thus allow the production of a fertile line.\n\nFailure to produce a hybrid may be due to pre- or post-[[fertilization]] incompatibility. If fertilization is possible between two species or genera, the hybrid [[embryo]] may abort before maturation. If this does occur the embryo resulting from an interspecific or intergeneric cross can sometimes be rescued and cultured to produce a whole plant. Such a method is referred to as [[Embryo Rescue]]. This technique has been used to produce [[New Rice for Africa|new rice for Africa]], an interspecific cross of Asian rice ''(Oryza sativa)'' and [[African rice]] ''(Oryza glaberrima)''.\n\nHybrids may also be produced by a technique called [[protoplast]] fusion. In this case protoplasts are fused, usually in an electric field. Viable recombinants can be regenerated in culture.\n\nChemical [[mutagen]]s like [[ethyl methanesulfonate|EMS]] and [[dimethyl sulfate|DMS]], [[radiation]] and [[transposon]]s are used to generate [[mutant]]s with desirable traits to be bred with other [[cultivar]]s \u2013 a process known as ''Mutation Breeding''. Classical plant breeders also generate genetic diversity within a species by exploiting a process called [[somaclonal variation]], which occurs in plants produced from tissue culture, particularly plants derived from [[plant tissue culture|callus]]. Induced [[polyploidy]], and the addition or removal of chromosomes using a technique called [[chromosome engineering]] may also be used.\n[[File:\u041e\u0442\u0431\u043e\u0440 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0446\u043e\u0432 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438-\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044f.jpg|left|thumb|Agricultural research on potato plants]]\n\nWhen a desirable trait has been bred into a species, a number of crosses to the favored parent are made to make the new plant as similar to the favored parent as possible. Returning to the example of the mildew resistant pea being crossed with a high-yielding but susceptible pea, to make the mildew resistant progeny of the cross most like the high-yielding parent, the progeny will be crossed back to that parent for several generations (See [[backcrossing]] ). This process removes most of the genetic contribution of the mildew resistant parent. Classical breeding is therefore a cyclical process.\n\nWith classical breeding techniques, the breeder does not know exactly what genes have been introduced to the new cultivars. Some [[scientist]]s therefore argue that plants produced by classical breeding methods should undergo the same safety testing regime as [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] plants. There have been instances where plants bred using classical techniques have been unsuitable for human consumption, for example the [[poison]] [[solanine]] was unintentionally increased to unacceptable levels in certain varieties of [[potato]] through plant breeding. New potato varieties are often screened for solanine levels before reaching the marketplace.\n\n== Modern plant breeding ==\nModern plant breeding may use techniques of molecular biology to select, or in the case of genetic modification, to insert, desirable traits into plants. Application of biotechnology or molecular biology is also known as [[molecular breeding]].\n\n[[File:Adelport 270.jpg|350px|thumb|Modern facilities in molecular biology are now used in plant breeding.]]\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\n*\n\n=== Marker assisted selection ===\n{{Main|Marker assisted selection}}\nSometimes many different genes can influence a desirable trait in plant breeding. The use of tools such as [[molecular marker]]s or [[DNA fingerprinting]] can map thousands of genes. This allows plant breeders to screen large populations of plants for those that possess the trait of interest. The screening is based on the presence or absence of a certain gene as determined by laboratory procedures, rather than on the visual identification of the expressed trait in the plant. The purpose of marker assisted selection, or plant genomes analysis, is to identify the location and function ([[phenotype]]) of various genes within the genome. If all of the genes are identified it leads to [[Genome sequence]]. All plants have varying sizes and lengths of genomes with genes that code for different proteins, but many are also the same. If a gene's location and function is identified in one plant species, a very similar gene likely can also be found in a similar location in another species genome.<ref name=\"Biotech and food supply\">{{cite journal|title=Biotechnology and world food supply|journal = Genome|volume = 42|issue = 4|last1=Kasha|first1=Ken|pages=642\u2013645|doi=10.1139/g99-043|year = 1999}}</ref>\n\n=== Reverse breeding and doubled haploids (DH) ===\n{{Main|Doubled haploidy}}\n{{clarify|reason=some explanation of reverse breeding is still missing here|date=March 2017}}[[Homozygous]] plants with desirable traits can be produced from [[heterozygous]] starting plants, if a haploid cell with the alleles for those traits can be produced, and then used to make a [[Doubled haploidy|doubled haploid]]. The doubled haploid will be homozygous for the desired traits. Furthermore, two different homozygous plants created in that way can be used to produce a generation of [[F1 hybrid]] plants which have the advantages of heterozygosity and a greater range of possible traits. Thus, an individual heterozygous plant chosen for its desirable characteristics can be converted into a heterozygous variety (F1 hybrid) without the necessity of [[vegetative reproduction]] but as the result of the cross of two homozygous/doubled haploid lines derived from the originally selected plant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2003017753|title=Reverse Breeding|website=wipo.int}}</ref> Using plant tissue culturing can produce haploid or double haploid plant lines and generations. This minimizes the amount of genetic diversity among that plant species in order to select for desirable traits that will increase the fitness of the individuals. Using this method decreases the need for breeding multiple generations of plants to get a generation that is homologous for the desired traits, therefore save much time in the process. There are many plant tissue culturing techniques that can be used to achieve the haploid plants, but microspore culturing is currently the most promising for producing the largest numbers of them.<ref name=\"Biotech and food supply\" />\n\n=== Genetic modification ===\n{{Main|Transgenic plants}}\n[[Genetic modification]] of plants is achieved by adding a specific gene or genes to a plant, or by knocking down a gene with [[RNAi]], to produce a desirable [[phenotype]]. The plants resulting from adding a gene are often referred to as [[transgenic plants]]. If for genetic modification genes of the species or of a crossable plant are used under control of their native promoter, then they are called [[cisgenesis|cisgenic plants]]. Sometimes genetic modification can produce a plant with the desired trait or traits faster than classical breeding because the majority of the plant's genome is not altered.\n\nTo genetically modify a plant, a genetic construct must be designed so that the gene to be added or removed will be expressed by the plant. To do this, a [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] to drive [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and a termination sequence to stop transcription of the new gene, and the gene or genes of interest must be introduced to the plant. A marker for the selection of transformed plants is also included. In the [[laboratory]], [[antibiotic resistance]] is a commonly used marker: Plants that have been successfully transformed will grow on media containing antibiotics; plants that have not been transformed will die. In some instances markers for selection are removed by [[backcrossing]] with the parent plant prior to commercial release.\n\nThe construct can be inserted in the plant genome by [[genetic recombination]] using the bacteria ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]'' or ''[[Agrobacterium rhizogenes|A. rhizogenes]]'', or by direct methods like the [[gene gun]] or [[microinjection]]. Using plant [[virus]]es to insert genetic constructs into plants is also a possibility, but the technique is limited by the host range of the virus. For example, [[Cauliflower mosaic virus]] (CaMV) only infects [[cauliflower]] and related species. Another limitation of viral vectors is that the virus is not usually passed on the progeny, so every plant has to be inoculated.\n\nThe majority of commercially released transgenic plants are currently limited to plants that have introduced resistance to [[insect]] [[pest (animal)|pests]] and [[herbicide]]s. Insect resistance is achieved through incorporation of a gene from ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (Bt) that encodes a [[protein]] that is toxic to some insects. For example, the [[Helicoverpa zea|cotton bollworm]], a common cotton pest, feeds on [[Bt cotton]] it will ingest the toxin and die. Herbicides usually work by binding to certain plant enzymes and inhibiting their action.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moreland|first=D E|title=Mechanisms of Action of Herbicides|journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology|volume=31|issue=1|pages=597\u2013638|doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.31.060180.003121|year=1980}}</ref> The enzymes that the herbicide inhibits are known as the herbicides ''target site''.  Herbicide resistance can be engineered into crops by expressing a version of ''target site'' protein that is not inhibited by the herbicide. This is the method used to produce glyphosate resistant crop plants (See [[Glyphosate#Glyphosate resistance|Glyphosate]])\n\nGenetic modification can further increase yields by increasing stress tolerance to a given environment. Stresses such as temperature variation, are signalled to the plant via a cascade of signalling molecules which will activate a [[Transcription factor]] to regulate [[Gene expression]]. Overexpression of particular genes involved in cold acclimation has been shown to become more resistant to freezing, which is one common cause of yield loss<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Wang, Wangxia |author2=Vinocur, Basia |author3=Altmann, Arie |title=Plant responses to drought, salinity and extreme temperatures: towards genetic engineering for stress tolerance|journal=Planta|volume=218|issue=1 |pages=1\u201314|doi=10.1007/s00425-003-1105-5|year=2003 |pmid=14513379}}</ref>\n\nGenetic modification of plants that can produce [[pharmaceutical]]s (and industrial chemicals), sometimes called ''[[pharming (genetics)|pharming]]'', is a rather radical new area of plant breeding.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Genetically modified plants and human health | journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | date=1 June 2008 |author1=Suzie Key |author2=Julian K-C Ma |author3=Pascal MW Drake  |last-author-amp=yes | pages=290\u2013298 | pmc=2408621 | pmid=18515776 | doi=10.1258/jrsm.2008.070372 | volume=101| issue=6 }}</ref>\n\n== Issues and concerns ==\nModern plant breeding, whether classical or through genetic engineering, comes with issues of concern, particularly with regard to food crops. The question of whether breeding can have a negative effect on [[nutrition]]al value is central in this respect. Although relatively little direct research in this area has been done, there are scientific indications that, by favoring certain aspects of a plant's development, other aspects may be retarded. A study published in the ''[[Journal of the American College of Nutrition]]'' in 2004, entitled ''Changes in USDA Food Composition Data for 43 Garden Crops, 1950 to 1999'', compared nutritional analysis of [[vegetable]]s done in 1950 and in 1999, and found substantial decreases in six of 13 [[nutrient]]s measured, including 6% of [[protein]] and 38% of [[riboflavin]]. Reductions in [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[iron]] and [[ascorbic acid]] were also found. The study, conducted at the Biochemical Institute, [[University of Texas at Austin]], concluded in summary: ''\"We suggest that any real declines are generally most easily explained by changes in cultivated varieties between 1950 and 1999, in which there may be trade-offs between [[Crop yield|yield]] and nutrient content.\"''<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = D.R. | last2 = Epp | first2 = M.D. | last3 = Riordan | first3 = H.D. | year = 2004 | title =  Changes in USDA Food Composition Data for 43 Garden Crops, 1950 to 1999| url = | journal = Journal of the American College of Nutrition | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 669\u2013682 | doi=10.1080/07315724.2004.10719409| pmid = 15637215 }}</ref>\n\nThe debate surrounding genetically modified food during the 1990s peaked in 1999 in terms of media coverage and risk perception,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Costa-Font | first1 = J. | last2 = Mossialos | first2 = E. | year = 2007 | title =  Are perceptions of 'risks' and 'benefits' of genetically modified food (in)dependent?| url = | journal = Food Quality and Preference | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173\u2013182 | doi=10.1016/j.foodqual.2005.09.013}}</ref> and continues today \u2013 for example, \"''Germany has thrown its weight behind a growing European mutiny over [[genetically modified crops]] by banning the planting of a widely grown pest-resistant corn variety.''\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/14/germany-gm-crops|title=Germany deals blow to GM crops|last=Connoly|first=Kate|date=2009-04-14|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2009-06-25}}</ref> The debate encompasses the [[Ecological impact of transgenic plants|ecological impact of genetically modified plants]], the safety of [[genetically modified food]] and concepts used for safety evaluation like [[substantial equivalence]]. Such concerns are not new to plant breeding. Most countries have regulatory processes in place to help ensure that new crop varieties entering the marketplace are both safe and meet farmers' needs. Examples include variety registration, seed schemes, regulatory authorizations for GM plants, etc.\n\n[[Plant breeders' rights]] is also a major and controversial issue. Today, production of new varieties is dominated by commercial plant breeders, who seek to protect their work and collect royalties through national and international agreements based in [[intellectual property rights]]. The range of related issues is complex. In the simplest terms, critics of the increasingly restrictive regulations argue that, through a combination of technical and economic pressures, commercial breeders are reducing [[biodiversity]] and significantly constraining individuals (such as farmers) from developing and trading seed on a regional level.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Luby|first=C.

Some plants are propagated by asexual means while others are propagated by seeds. Seed propagated cultivars require specific control over seed source and production procedures to maintain the integrity of the plant breeds results. Isolation is necessary to prevent cross contamination with related plants or the mixing of seeds after harvesting. Isolation is normally accomplished by planting distance but in certain crops, plants are enclosed in greenhouses or cages (most commonly used when producing F1 hybrids.)\n\n== Role of plant breeding in organic agriculture ==\nCritics of [[organic agriculture]] claim it is too low-yielding to be a viable alternative to conventional agriculture.  However, part of that poor performance may be the result of growing poorly adapted varieties.<ref name=\"Murphy\">{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Kevin M. |author2=K.G. Campbell |author3=S.R.

Breeding varieties specifically adapted to the unique conditions of organic agriculture is critical for this sector to realize its full potential.  This requires selection for traits such as:<ref name=\"Lammerts 1\" />\n* Water use efficiency\n* Nutrient use efficiency (particularly [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]])\n* Weed competitiveness\n* Tolerance of [[mechanical weed control]]\n* Pest/disease resistance\n* Early maturity (as a mechanism for avoidance of particular stresses)\n* Abiotic stress tolerance (i.e. drought, salinity, etc...)\n\nCurrently, few breeding programs are directed at organic agriculture and until recently those that did address this sector have generally relied on indirect selection (i.e. selection in conventional environments for traits considered important for organic agriculture).  However, because the difference between organic and conventional environments is large, a given [[genotype]] may perform very differently in each environment due to an interaction between genes and the environment (see [[gene-environment interaction]]).  If this interaction is severe enough, an important trait required for the organic environment may not be revealed in the conventional environment, which can result in the selection of poorly adapted individuals.<ref name=\"Murphy\" />  To ensure the most adapted varieties are identified, advocates of organic breeding now promote the use of direct selection (i.e. selection in the target environment) for many agronomic traits.\n\nThere are many classical and modern breeding techniques that can be utilized for crop improvement in organic agriculture despite the ban on [[genetically modified organisms]].  For instance, controlled crosses between individuals allow desirable genetic variation to be recombined and transferred to seed progeny via natural processes.  [[Marker assisted selection]] can also be employed as a diagnostics tool to facilitate selection of progeny who possess the desired trait(s), greatly speeding up the breeding process.<ref name=\"Lammerts 2\">{{cite journal|last=Lammerts van Bueren|first=E.

Unfortunately, [[molecular markers]] are not currently available for many important traits, especially complex ones controlled by many genes.\n\n== Breeding and food security ==\nFor agriculture to thrive in the future, changes must be made to address arising global issues. These issues are the lack of arable land, increasingly harsh cropping conditions and the need to maintain food security, which involves being able to provide the world population with sufficient nutrition. Crops need to be able to mature in multiple environments to allow worldwide access, which involves solving problems including drought tolerance. It has been suggested that global solutions are achievable through the process of plant breeding, with its ability to select specific genes allowing crops to perform at a level which yields the desired results.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rhodes |title=Addressing the potential for a selective breeding-based approach in sustainable agriculture |journal=International Journal of Agricultural Research |date=2013 |volume=42 |issue=12 |url=https://scatting.net/scat-clip/6019-shitjessica-scat-spy-scatting-blond-shopscat-fullhd-1080p.html}}</ref>\n\n=== Yield ===\n\nWith an increasing population, the production of food needs to increase with it.  It is estimated that a 70% increase in food production is needed by 2050 in order to meet the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security. But with the degradation of agricultural land, simply planting more crops is no longer a viable option. New varieties of plants can in some cases be developed through plant breeding that generate an increase of yield without relying on an increase in land area. An example of this can be seen in Asia, where food production per capita has increased twofold.  This has been achieved through not only the use of fertilisers, but through the use of better crops that have been specifically designed for the area.<ref name=\"Tester, Langridge\">{{cite journal|last1=Tester|last2= Langridge|first1= Mark |first2= Peter |title=Breeding technologies to increase crop production in a changing world|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=February 2010 |volume=327 |issue=5967 |pages=818\u2013822 |doi=10.1126/science.1183700 |pmid=20150489|bibcode= 2010Sci...327..818T}}</ref><ref name=\"Godfray, Crute, Haddad, Lawrence, Muir, Pretty, Robinson.

Improvements in nutritional value for forage crops from the use of analytical chemistry and rumen fermentation technology have been recorded since 1960; this science and technology gave breeders the ability to screen thousands of samples within a small amount of time, meaning breeders could identify a high performing hybrid quicker. The main area genetic increases were made was in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) resulting in 0.7-2.5% increase, at just 1% increase in IVDMD a single Bos Taurus also known as beef cattle reported 3.2% increase in daily gains. This improvement indicates plant breeding is an essential tool in gearing future agriculture to perform at a more advanced level.\n<ref>{{cite book|last=B\u00e4nziger|title=Breeding for drought and nitrogen stress tolerance in maize: from theory to practice|journal=From Theory to Practice|year=2000|pages=7\u20139|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HlluklozxuQC&pg=PA6&dq=B%C3%A4nziger,+M.+(2000).+Breeding+for+drought+and+nitrogen+stress+tolerance+in+maize:+from+theory+to+practice.+#v=onepage&q=B%C3%A4nziger%2C%20M.%20(2000).%20Breeding%20for%20drought%20and%20nitrogen%20stress%20tolerance%20in%20maize%3A%20from%20theory%20to%20practice.&f=false|accessdate=2013-11-07|isbn=9789706480460}}</ref>\n\n=== Environmental stressors ===\n\nPlant breeding of hybrid crops has become extremely popular worldwide in an effort to combat the harsh environment. With long periods of drought and lack of water or nitrogen stress tolerance has become a significant part of agriculture. Plant breeders have focused on identifying crops which will ensure crops perform under these conditions; a way to achieve this is finding strains of the crop that is resistance to drought conditions with low nitrogen. It is evident from this that plant breeding is vital for future agriculture to survive as it enables farmers to produce stress resistant crops hence improving food security.\n<ref name=\"Casler, Vogal\">{{cite journal|last=Casler, Vogal|first=M.K.|title=Accomplishments and impact from breeding for increased forage nutritional value|journal=Crop Science|date=January\u2013February 1999 |volume=39|issue=1|pages=12\u201320|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/cs/abstracts/39/1/CS0390010012 |doi=10.2135/cropsci1999.0011183x003900010003x}}</ref>\nIn countries that experience harsh winters such as Iceland, Germany and further east in Europe, plant breeders are involved in breeding for tolerance to frost, continuous snow-cover, frost-drought (desiccation from wind and solar radiation under frost) and high moisture levels in soil in winter.<ref>Link, W.; Balko, C.; Stoddard, F.; Winter hardiness in faba bean: Physiology and breeding.

Plants are crossbred to introduce [[Trait (biological)|traits]]/[[gene]]s from one variety or line into a new genetic background. For example, a [[mildew]]-resistant [[pea]] may be crossed with a high-yielding but susceptible pea, the goal of the cross being to introduce mildew resistance without losing the high-yield characteristics. Progeny from the cross would then be crossed with the high-yielding parent to ensure that the progeny were most like the high-yielding parent, ('''[[backcrossing]]'''). The progeny from that cross would then be tested for yield (selection, as described above) and mildew resistance and high-yielding resistant plants would be further developed. Plants may also be crossed with themselves to produce '''inbred''' varieties for breeding. Pollinators may be [[Pollinator exclusion experiment|excluded]] through the use of [[pollination bags]].\n\nClassical breeding relies largely on [[genetic recombination|homologous recombination]] between chromosomes to generate [[genetic diversity]]. The classical plant breeder may also make use of a number of ''in vitro'' techniques such as [[somatic fusion|protoplast fusion]], [[embryo rescue]] or [[mutagenesis]] (see below) to generate diversity and produce hybrid plants that would not exist in [[nature]].\n\nTraits that breeders have tried to incorporate into crop plants include:\n# Improved [[Quality (business)|quality]], such as increased nutrition, improved flavor, or greater beauty\n# Increased [[Crop yield|yield]] of the crop\n# Increased [[Physiological tolerance|tolerance]] of environmental pressures ([[salinity]], extreme [[temperature]], [[drought]])\n# Resistance to [[virus]]es, [[fungus|fungi]] and [[bacteria]]\n# Increased tolerance to [[insect]] pests\n# Increased tolerance of [[herbicide]]s\n# Longer storage period for the harvested crop\n\n=== Before World War II ===\n[[File:Gartons-1902-Catalogue.jpg|thumb|right|Garton's catalogue from 1902]]\n\nSuccessful commercial plant breeding concerns were founded from the late 19th century.{{clarify|and a citation that there were none before that time|date=October 2013}} [[Gartons Agricultural Plant Breeders]] in England was established in the 1890s by John Garton, who was one of the first to commercialize new varieties of agricultural crops created through cross-pollination.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.agri.ankara.edu.tr/fcrops/1289__PBARTSCIENCE.doc|title=Plant breeding|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021184545/http://www.agri.ankara.edu.tr/fcrops/1289__PBARTSCIENCE.doc|archivedate=2013-10-21}}</ref> The firm's first introduction was Abundance [[Oat]], one of the first agricultural grain varieties bred from a ''controlled'' cross, introduced to commerce in 1892.<ref>Spring Seed Catalogue 1899, Gartons Limited</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dGSj-CFxk-QC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Hybrid: The History and Science of Plant Breeding|author=Noel Kingsbury|year=2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=140|isbn=9780226437057}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, plant breeders realized that [[gregor mendel|Mendel's]]  findings on the non-random nature of [[Mendelian inheritance|inheritance]] could be applied to [[seedling]] populations produced through deliberate [[pollination]]s to predict the frequencies of different types. Wheat hybrids were bred to increase the crop production of [[Italy]] during the so-called \"[[Battle for Grain]]\" (1925\u20131940). [[Heterosis]] was explained by [[George Harrison Shull]]. It describes the tendency of the progeny of a specific cross to outperform both parents. The detection of the usefulness of heterosis for plant breeding has led to the development of inbred lines that reveal a heterotic yield advantage when they are crossed. [[Maize]] was the first species where heterosis was widely used to produce hybrids.\n\n[[statistics|Statistical]] methods were also developed to analyze gene action and distinguish heritable variation from variation caused by environment. In 1933 another important breeding technique, [[cytoplasmic male sterility]] (CMS), developed in maize, was described by [[Marcus Morton Rhoades]]. CMS is a maternally inherited trait that makes the plant produce sterile [[pollen]]. This enables the production of hybrids without the need for labor-intensive [[detasseling]].\n\nThese early breeding techniques resulted in large yield increase in the [[United States]] in the early 20th century. Similar yield increases were not produced elsewhere until after [[World War II]], the [[Green Revolution]] increased crop production in the developing world in the 1960s.\n\n=== After World War II ===\n[[File:FA Geisenheim22.jpg|thumb|In vitro-culture of Vitis (grapevine), [[Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute]]]]\nFollowing [[World War II]] a number of techniques were developed that allowed plant breeders to hybridize distantly related species, and artificially induce genetic diversity.\n\nWhen distantly related species are crossed, plant breeders make use of a number of [[plant tissue culture]] techniques to produce progeny from otherwise fruitless mating. Interspecific and intergeneric hybrids are produced from a cross of related species or genera that do not normally [[reproduction|sexually reproduce]] with each other. These crosses are referred to as ''Wide crosses''. For example, the [[cereal]] [[triticale]] is a [[wheat]] and [[rye]] hybrid. The cells in the plants derived from the first generation created from the cross contained an uneven number of chromosomes and as result was sterile. The [[cell division]] inhibitor [[colchicine]] was used to double the number of [[chromosome]]s in the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] and thus allow the production of a fertile line.\n\nFailure to produce a hybrid may be due to pre- or post-[[fertilization]] incompatibility. If fertilization is possible between two species or genera, the hybrid [[embryo]] may abort before maturation. If this does occur the embryo resulting from an interspecific or intergeneric cross can sometimes be rescued and cultured to produce a whole plant. Such a method is referred to as [[Embryo Rescue]]. This technique has been used to produce [[New Rice for Africa|new rice for Africa]], an interspecific cross of Asian rice ''(Oryza sativa)'' and [[African rice]] ''(Oryza glaberrima)''.\n\nHybrids may also be produced by a technique called [[protoplast]] fusion. In this case protoplasts are fused, usually in an electric field. Viable recombinants can be regenerated in culture.\n\nChemical [[mutagen]]s like [[ethyl methanesulfonate|EMS]] and [[dimethyl sulfate|DMS]], [[radiation]] and [[transposon]]s are used to generate [[mutant]]s with desirable traits to be bred with other [[cultivar]]s \u2013 a process known as ''Mutation Breeding''. Classical plant breeders also generate genetic diversity within a species by exploiting a process called [[somaclonal variation]], which occurs in plants produced from tissue culture, particularly plants derived from [[plant tissue culture|callus]]. Induced [[polyploidy]], and the addition or removal of chromosomes using a technique called [[chromosome engineering]] may also be used.\n[[File:\u041e\u0442\u0431\u043e\u0440 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0446\u043e\u0432 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438-\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044f.jpg|left|thumb|Agricultural research on potato plants]]\n\nWhen a desirable trait has been bred into a species, a number of crosses to the favored parent are made to make the new plant as similar to the favored parent as possible. Returning to the example of the mildew resistant pea being crossed with a high-yielding but susceptible pea, to make the mildew resistant progeny of the cross most like the high-yielding parent, the progeny will be crossed back to that parent for several generations (See [[backcrossing]] ). This process removes most of the genetic contribution of the mildew resistant parent. Classical breeding is therefore a cyclical process.\n\nWith classical breeding techniques, the breeder does not know exactly what genes have been introduced to the new cultivars. Some [[scientist]]s therefore argue that plants produced by classical breeding methods should undergo the same safety testing regime as [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] plants. There have been instances where plants bred using classical techniques have been unsuitable for human consumption, for example the [[poison]] [[solanine]] was unintentionally increased to unacceptable levels in certain varieties of [[potato]] through plant breeding. New potato varieties are often screened for solanine levels before reaching the marketplace.\n\n== Modern plant breeding ==\nModern plant breeding may use techniques of molecular biology to select, or in the case of genetic modification, to insert, desirable traits into plants. Application of biotechnology or molecular biology is also known as [[molecular breeding]].\n\n[[File:Adelport 270.jpg|350px|thumb|Modern facilities in molecular biology are now used in plant breeding.]]\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\n*\n\n=== Marker assisted selection ===\n{{Main|Marker assisted selection}}\nSometimes many different genes can influence a desirable trait in plant breeding. The use of tools such as [[molecular marker]]s or [[DNA fingerprinting]] can map thousands of genes. This allows plant breeders to screen large populations of plants for those that possess the trait of interest. The screening is based on the presence or absence of a certain gene as determined by laboratory procedures, rather than on the visual identification of the expressed trait in the plant. The purpose of marker assisted selection, or plant genomes analysis, is to identify the location and function ([[phenotype]]) of various genes within the genome. If all of the genes are identified it leads to [[Genome sequence]]. All plants have varying sizes and lengths of genomes with genes that code for different proteins, but many are also the same. If a gene's location and function is identified in one plant species, a very similar gene likely can also be found in a similar location in another species genome.<ref name=\"Biotech and food supply\">{{cite journal|title=Biotechnology and world food supply|journal = Genome|volume = 42|issue = 4|last1=Kasha|first1=Ken|pages=642\u2013645|doi=10.1139/g99-043|year = 1999}}</ref>\n\n=== Reverse breeding and doubled haploids (DH) ===\n{{Main|Doubled haploidy}}\n{{clarify|reason=some explanation of reverse breeding is still missing here|date=March 2017}}[[Homozygous]] plants with desirable traits can be produced from [[heterozygous]] starting plants, if a haploid cell with the alleles for those traits can be produced, and then used to make a [[Doubled haploidy|doubled haploid]]. The doubled haploid will be homozygous for the desired traits. Furthermore, two different homozygous plants created in that way can be used to produce a generation of [[F1 hybrid]] plants which have the advantages of heterozygosity and a greater range of possible traits. Thus, an individual heterozygous plant chosen for its desirable characteristics can be converted into a heterozygous variety (F1 hybrid) without the necessity of [[vegetative reproduction]] but as the result of the cross of two homozygous/doubled haploid lines derived from the originally selected plant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2003017753|title=Reverse Breeding|website=wipo.int}}</ref> Using plant tissue culturing can produce haploid or double haploid plant lines and generations. This minimizes the amount of genetic diversity among that plant species in order to select for desirable traits that will increase the fitness of the individuals. Using this method decreases the need for breeding multiple generations of plants to get a generation that is homologous for the desired traits, therefore save much time in the process. There are many plant tissue culturing techniques that can be used to achieve the haploid plants, but microspore culturing is currently the most promising for producing the largest numbers of them.<ref name=\"Biotech and food supply\" />\n\n=== Genetic modification ===\n{{Main|Transgenic plants}}\n[[Genetic modification]] of plants is achieved by adding a specific gene or genes to a plant, or by knocking down a gene with [[RNAi]], to produce a desirable [[phenotype]]. The plants resulting from adding a gene are often referred to as [[transgenic plants]]. If for genetic modification genes of the species or of a crossable plant are used under control of their native promoter, then they are called [[cisgenesis|cisgenic plants]]. Sometimes genetic modification can produce a plant with the desired trait or traits faster than classical breeding because the majority of the plant's genome is not altered.\n\nTo genetically modify a plant, a genetic construct must be designed so that the gene to be added or removed will be expressed by the plant. To do this, a [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] to drive [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and a termination sequence to stop transcription of the new gene, and the gene or genes of interest must be introduced to the plant. A marker for the selection of transformed plants is also included. In the [[laboratory]], [[antibiotic resistance]] is a commonly used marker: Plants that have been successfully transformed will grow on media containing antibiotics; plants that have not been transformed will die. In some instances markers for selection are removed by [[backcrossing]] with the parent plant prior to commercial release.\n\nThe construct can be inserted in the plant genome by [[genetic recombination]] using the bacteria ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]'' or ''[[Agrobacterium rhizogenes|A. rhizogenes]]'', or by direct methods like the [[gene gun]] or [[microinjection]]. Using plant [[virus]]es to insert genetic constructs into plants is also a possibility, but the technique is limited by the host range of the virus. For example, [[Cauliflower mosaic virus]] (CaMV) only infects [[cauliflower]] and related species. Another limitation of viral vectors is that the virus is not usually passed on the progeny, so every plant has to be inoculated.\n\nThe majority of commercially released transgenic plants are currently limited to plants that have introduced resistance to [[insect]] [[pest (animal)|pests]] and [[herbicide]]s. Insect resistance is achieved through incorporation of a gene from ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (Bt) that encodes a [[protein]] that is toxic to some insects. For example, the [[Helicoverpa zea|cotton bollworm]], a common cotton pest, feeds on [[Bt cotton]] it will ingest the toxin and die. Herbicides usually work by binding to certain plant enzymes and inhibiting their action.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moreland|first=D E|title=Mechanisms of Action of Herbicides|journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology|volume=31|issue=1|pages=597\u2013638|doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.31.060180.003121|year=1980}}</ref> The enzymes that the herbicide inhibits are known as the herbicides ''target site''.  Herbicide resistance can be engineered into crops by expressing a version of ''target site'' protein that is not inhibited by the herbicide. This is the method used to produce glyphosate resistant crop plants (See [[Glyphosate#Glyphosate resistance|Glyphosate]])\n\nGenetic modification can further increase yields by increasing stress tolerance to a given environment. Stresses such as temperature variation, are signalled to the plant via a cascade of signalling molecules which will activate a [[Transcription factor]] to regulate [[Gene expression]]. Overexpression of particular genes involved in cold acclimation has been shown to become more resistant to freezing, which is one common cause of yield loss<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Wang, Wangxia |author2=Vinocur, Basia |author3=Altmann, Arie |title=Plant responses to drought, salinity and extreme temperatures: towards genetic engineering for stress tolerance|journal=Planta|volume=218|issue=1 |pages=1\u201314|doi=10.1007/s00425-003-1105-5|year=2003 |pmid=14513379}}</ref>\n\nGenetic modification of plants that can produce [[pharmaceutical]]s (and industrial chemicals), sometimes called ''[[pharming (genetics)|pharming]]'', is a rather radical new area of plant breeding.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Genetically modified plants and human health | journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | date=1 June 2008 |author1=Suzie Key |author2=Julian K-C Ma |author3=Pascal MW Drake  |last-author-amp=yes | pages=290\u2013298 | pmc=2408621 | pmid=18515776 | doi=10.1258/jrsm.2008.070372 | volume=101| issue=6 }}</ref>\n\n== Issues and concerns ==\nModern plant breeding, whether classical or through genetic engineering, comes with issues of concern, particularly with regard to food crops. The question of whether breeding can have a negative effect on [[nutrition]]al value is central in this respect. Although relatively little direct research in this area has been done, there are scientific indications that, by favoring certain aspects of a plant's development, other aspects may be retarded. A study published in the ''[[Journal of the American College of Nutrition]]'' in 2004, entitled ''Changes in USDA Food Composition Data for 43 Garden Crops, 1950 to 1999'', compared nutritional analysis of [[vegetable]]s done in 1950 and in 1999, and found substantial decreases in six of 13 [[nutrient]]s measured, including 6% of [[protein]] and 38% of [[riboflavin]]. Reductions in [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[iron]] and [[ascorbic acid]] were also found. The study, conducted at the Biochemical Institute, [[University of Texas at Austin]], concluded in summary: ''\"We suggest that any real declines are generally most easily explained by changes in cultivated varieties between 1950 and 1999, in which there may be trade-offs between [[Crop yield|yield]] and nutrient content.\"''<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = D.R. | last2 = Epp | first2 = M.D. | last3 = Riordan | first3 = H.D. | year = 2004 | title =  Changes in USDA Food Composition Data for 43 Garden Crops, 1950 to 1999| url = | journal = Journal of the American College of Nutrition | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 669\u2013682 | doi=10.1080/07315724.2004.10719409| pmid = 15637215 }}</ref>\n\nThe debate surrounding genetically modified food during the 1990s peaked in 1999 in terms of media coverage and risk perception,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Costa-Font | first1 = J. | last2 = Mossialos | first2 = E. | year = 2007 | title =  Are perceptions of 'risks' and 'benefits' of genetically modified food (in)dependent?| url = | journal = Food Quality and Preference | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173\u2013182 | doi=10.1016/j.foodqual.2005.09.013}}</ref> and continues today \u2013 for example, \"''Germany has thrown its weight behind a growing European mutiny over [[genetically modified crops]] by banning the planting of a widely grown pest-resistant corn variety.''\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/14/germany-gm-crops|title=Germany deals blow to GM crops|last=Connoly|first=Kate|date=2009-04-14|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2009-06-25}}</ref> The debate encompasses the [[Ecological impact of transgenic plants|ecological impact of genetically modified plants]], the safety of [[genetically modified food]] and concepts used for safety evaluation like [[substantial equivalence]]. Such concerns are not new to plant breeding. Most countries have regulatory processes in place to help ensure that new crop varieties entering the marketplace are both safe and meet farmers' needs. Examples include variety registration, seed schemes, regulatory authorizations for GM plants, etc.\n\n[[Plant breeders' rights]] is also a major and controversial issue. Today, production of new varieties is dominated by commercial plant breeders, who seek to protect their work and collect royalties through national and international agreements based in [[intellectual property rights]]. The range of related issues is complex. In the simplest terms, critics of the increasingly restrictive regulations argue that, through a combination of technical and economic pressures, commercial breeders are reducing [[biodiversity]] and significantly constraining individuals (such as farmers) from developing and trading seed on a regional level.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Luby|first=C.

Some plants are propagated by asexual means while others are propagated by seeds. Seed propagated cultivars require specific control over seed source and production procedures to maintain the integrity of the plant breeds results. Isolation is necessary to prevent cross contamination with related plants or the mixing of seeds after harvesting. Isolation is normally accomplished by planting distance but in certain crops, plants are enclosed in greenhouses or cages (most commonly used when producing F1 hybrids.)\n\n== Role of plant breeding in organic agriculture ==\nCritics of [[organic agriculture]] claim it is too low-yielding to be a viable alternative to conventional agriculture.  However, part of that poor performance may be the result of growing poorly adapted varieties.<ref name=\"Murphy\">{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Kevin M. |author2=K.G. Campbell |author3=S.R.

Breeding varieties specifically adapted to the unique conditions of organic agriculture is critical for this sector to realize its full potential.  This requires selection for traits such as:<ref name=\"Lammerts 1\" />\n* Water use efficiency\n* Nutrient use efficiency (particularly [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]])\n* Weed competitiveness\n* Tolerance of [[mechanical weed control]]\n* Pest/disease resistance\n* Early maturity (as a mechanism for avoidance of particular stresses)\n* Abiotic stress tolerance (i.e. drought, salinity, etc...)\n\nCurrently, few breeding programs are directed at organic agriculture and until recently those that did address this sector have generally relied on indirect selection (i.e. selection in conventional environments for traits considered important for organic agriculture).  However, because the difference between organic and conventional environments is large, a given [[genotype]] may perform very differently in each environment due to an interaction between genes and the environment (see [[gene-environment interaction]]).  If this interaction is severe enough, an important trait required for the organic environment may not be revealed in the conventional environment, which can result in the selection of poorly adapted individuals.<ref name=\"Murphy\" />  To ensure the most adapted varieties are identified, advocates of organic breeding now promote the use of direct selection (i.e. selection in the target environment) for many agronomic traits.\n\nThere are many classical and modern breeding techniques that can be utilized for crop improvement in organic agriculture despite the ban on [[genetically modified organisms]].  For instance, controlled crosses between individuals allow desirable genetic variation to be recombined and transferred to seed progeny via natural processes.  [[Marker assisted selection]] can also be employed as a diagnostics tool to facilitate selection of progeny who possess the desired trait(s), greatly speeding up the breeding process.<ref name=\"Lammerts 2\">{{cite journal|last=Lammerts van Bueren|first=E.

Unfortunately, [[molecular markers]] are not currently available for many important traits, especially complex ones controlled by many genes.\n\n== Breeding and food security ==\nFor agriculture to thrive in the future, changes must be made to address arising global issues. These issues are the lack of arable land, increasingly harsh cropping conditions and the need to maintain food security, which involves being able to provide the world population with sufficient nutrition. Crops need to be able to mature in multiple environments to allow worldwide access, which involves solving problems including drought tolerance. It has been suggested that global solutions are achievable through the process of plant breeding, with its ability to select specific genes allowing crops to perform at a level which yields the desired results.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rhodes |title=Addressing the potential for a selective breeding-based approach in sustainable agriculture |journal=International Journal of Agricultural Research |date=2013 |volume=42 |issue=12 |url=https://scatting.net/scat-clip/6019-shitjessica-scat-spy-scatting-blond-shopscat-fullhd-1080p.html}}</ref>\n\n=== Yield ===\n\nWith an increasing population, the production of food needs to increase with it.  It is estimated that a 70% increase in food production is needed by 2050 in order to meet the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security. But with the degradation of agricultural land, simply planting more crops is no longer a viable option. New varieties of plants can in some cases be developed through plant breeding that generate an increase of yield without relying on an increase in land area. An example of this can be seen in Asia, where food production per capita has increased twofold.  This has been achieved through not only the use of fertilisers, but through the use of better crops that have been specifically designed for the area.<ref name=\"Tester, Langridge\">{{cite journal|last1=Tester|last2= Langridge|first1= Mark |first2= Peter |title=Breeding technologies to increase crop production in a changing world|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=February 2010 |volume=327 |issue=5967 |pages=818\u2013822 |doi=10.1126/science.1183700 |pmid=20150489|bibcode= 2010Sci...327..818T}}</ref><ref name=\"Godfray, Crute, Haddad, Lawrence, Muir, Pretty, Robinson.

Improvements in nutritional value for forage crops from the use of analytical chemistry and rumen fermentation technology have been recorded since 1960; this science and technology gave breeders the ability to screen thousands of samples within a small amount of time, meaning breeders could identify a high performing hybrid quicker. The main area genetic increases were made was in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) resulting in 0.7-2.5% increase, at just 1% increase in IVDMD a single Bos Taurus also known as beef cattle reported 3.2% increase in daily gains. This improvement indicates plant breeding is an essential tool in gearing future agriculture to perform at a more advanced level.\n<ref>{{cite book|last=B\u00e4nziger|title=Breeding for drought and nitrogen stress tolerance in maize: from theory to practice|journal=From Theory to Practice|year=2000|pages=7\u20139|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HlluklozxuQC&pg=PA6&dq=B%C3%A4nziger,+M.+(2000).+Breeding+for+drought+and+nitrogen+stress+tolerance+in+maize:+from+theory+to+practice.+#v=onepage&q=B%C3%A4nziger%2C%20M.%20(2000).%20Breeding%20for%20drought%20and%20nitrogen%20stress%20tolerance%20in%20maize%3A%20from%20theory%20to%20practice.&f=false|accessdate=2013-11-07|isbn=9789706480460}}</ref>\n\n=== Environmental stressors ===\n\nPlant breeding of hybrid crops has become extremely popular worldwide in an effort to combat the harsh environment. With long periods of drought and lack of water or nitrogen stress tolerance has become a significant part of agriculture. Plant breeders have focused on identifying crops which will ensure crops perform under these conditions; a way to achieve this is finding strains of the crop that is resistance to drought conditions with low nitrogen. It is evident from this that plant breeding is vital for future agriculture to survive as it enables farmers to produce stress resistant crops hence improving food security.\n<ref name=\"Casler, Vogal\">{{cite journal|last=Casler, Vogal|first=M.K.|title=Accomplishments and impact from breeding for increased forage nutritional value|journal=Crop Science|date=January\u2013February 1999 |volume=39|issue=1|pages=12\u201320|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/cs/abstracts/39/1/CS0390010012 |doi=10.2135/cropsci1999.0011183x003900010003x}}</ref>\nIn countries that experience harsh winters such as Iceland, Germany and further east in Europe, plant breeders are involved in breeding for tolerance to frost, continuous snow-cover, frost-drought (desiccation from wind and solar radiation under frost) and high moisture levels in soil in winter.<ref>Link, W.; Balko, C.; Stoddard, F.; Winter hardiness in faba bean: Physiology and breeding.

Ships in the strait, protected by Tierra del Fuego to the south and the coast of continental [[South America]] to the north, crossed with relative ease, and Punta Arenas became a primary refueling port that provided coal for steamships in transit.

It was often considered the only safe way to move between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as the Drake Passage separating Cape Horn from [[Antarctica]] is notorious for turbulent and unpredictable weather, and is frequented by [[iceberg]]s and [[sea ice]]. Ships in the strait, protected by Tierra del Fuego to the south and the coast of continental [[South America]] to the north, crossed with relative ease, and Punta Arenas became a primary refueling port that provided coal for steamships in transit. Sailing ships, partly because of variable winds and currents in the strait, generally preferred the Drake Passage, where they had more room to maneuver.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Features==\n[[image:Magellanglaciacion.jpg|thumb|right|Map showing the extent of the [[Patagonian Ice Sheet]] in the Strait of Magellan area during the [[Last Glacial Period]].
