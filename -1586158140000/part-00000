''Clash of Clans'' tasks players to build their own village using the resources gained from attacking other players through the game's fighting features. The main resources are gold, elixir and dark elixir. Players can conjoin to create clans, groups of up to fifty people who can then participate in Clan Wars together, donate and receive troops, and chat with each other.\n\n''Clash of Clans'' was released to generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Clash of Clans gameplay.jpg|thumb|260px|A replay of gameplay, where a player is attacking another player's village]]\n''Clash of Clans'' is an online multiplayer game in which players form communities called clans, train troops, and attack other players to earn resources. There are four currencies or resources in the game.<ref name=\"gbcoc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.giantbomb.com/clash-of-clans/3030-40108/ |title=Clash of Clans |author=andalian |date=26 June 2016 |work=Giant Bomb |publisher=BS Interactive Inc |accessdate=3 July 2017 }}</ref>  Gold and elixir can be used to build and uppgrade defenses and traps that protect the player from other players' attacks and to build and uppgrade buildings. Elixir and dark elixir are also used to train and upgrade troops and spells.  Gems are the premium currency.<ref name=\"gbcoc\"/> Attacks are rated on a three-star scale and have a maximum timed length of three minutes.<ref name=\"gbcoc\"/>\n\nThe game also features a pseudo-single-player campaign in which the player can attack a series of fortified goblin villages<ref name=\"tgcoc\">{{cite web |url=https://downloads.tomsguide.com/Clash-of-Clans,0301-52982.html |title=Download Clash of Clans 8.116.2 for Android |work=Editors Review |publisher=Purch |accessdate=3 July 2017 }}</ref> and earn gold, elixir, and dark elixir (levels 51-75 only).

Elixir is used to train new troops, carry out research in the laboratory to upgrade troops, and to build and upgrade certain buildings, mostly pertaining to buildings used in attacking another player's base. Gold is used to build defensive buildings and to upgrade the town hall, which allows access to more buildings and higher levels for existing buildings. At Town Hall 7, dark elixir becomes available; this type of elixir is used to train and upgrade dark elixir troops, some heroes and create dark spells (available from Town Hall 8). The Eagle Artillery is a defensive building only available at Town Hall 11. Town Hall 11 also provides access to a new hero - The Grand Warden. It is the only hero born out of elixir. To earn and store dark elixir, players must build dark elixir drills and dark elixir storages. Town Hall 12 gets a defens called Giga Tesla, which is already built-in after the Town Hall 12 upgrade, while being upgraded to Town Hall 13, the Giga Inferno replaces the Giga Tesla. Town Hall 13 also unlocks of the following: Scattershot and Royal Champion.<ref name=\"Pocket\"/>\n\nThere are a number of buildings available to the player to defend their village, including cannons, mortars, bombs, teslas, traps, archer towers, wizard towers, inferno towers, eagle artilleries, and scattershots. Players can also build walls, which can be upgraded as a player's town hall level increases.<ref name=\"Pocket\"/><ref name=\"148Apps\"/>\n\n===Troops and spells===\nThe game has two kinds of barracks (barracks and dark barracks) and two kinds of spell factories (spell factory and dark spell factory). The barracks create troops using elixir, whereas dark barracks create troops using dark elixir.\n\nThe spell factories follow the same pattern - the normal spell factory creates spells using elixir, and the dark spell factory using dark elixir. All troops and spells have different properties. As the player progresses, several new troops and spells are able to be unlocked.\n\nAt Town Hall 12, the Workshop can be made. This building can make four types of siege machines: the Wall Wrecker, the Battle Blimp, the Stone Slammer, and the Siege Barracks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.supercheats.com/clash-of-clans/walkthrough/unit-guide|title=Clash of Clans Units}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clashofclansguidehq.com/units-list/|title=Clash of Clans Units List & Guide|date=February 18, 2014|access-date=August 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clashofclansnation.com/characters/|title=Characters|access-date=August 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clashofclans.com/clash-basics/troops|title=Official Website|website=Clash of Clans|access-date=August 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907193822/https://clashofclans.com/clash-basics/troops|archive-date=September 7, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clashofclans.com/clash-basics/spells|title=Spells {{!}} Clash of Clans|website=Clash of Clans|access-date=August 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907194713/https://clashofclans.com/clash-basics/spells|archive-date=September 7, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Clans and clan wars===\nClans are groups of players who join together to support each other, either materially (donating troops) or verbally (giving advice). Players can join clans once they rebuild the special Clan Castle building early on. A major component of the gameplay of ''Clash of Clans'' is clans facing off against one another in the \"clan wars\". Clan leaders and co-leaders can begin wars against other clans. Each clan is then given one \"preparation day\" and one \"war day.\" When a player attacks a member of the opposing clan, they receive stars based upon the amount of destruction they cause to the opponent's base, 50% damage or more gives 1 star, destroying the townhall also gives 1 star and destroying the entire base gives the remaining 3rd star. Each player is limited to two attacks per war and the team with the most stars at the end of the war day is declared victorious. If the two clans' number of stars are equal, then the victor is the one that has a greater percent of destruction. Players receive bonus war loot if he/she use their attacks in the war. This loot may be different on different bases and is decided by [[Supercell (video game company)|Supercell]]; the top base has the most war bonus loot and the last base has the least amount of bonus loot. If the clan wins the war, the bonus loot is fully delivered to the player but during a loss or draw one-third of the loot is delivered to the player.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://forum.supercell.net/showthread.php/232849-Clan-Wars-FAQ|title=Clan Wars FAQ |publisher=Supercell |date=April 4, 2014 | accessdate=June 9, 2014}}</ref> In the March 2016 update, 35v35 and 45v45 were removed.<ref>http://en.yibada.com/articles/107712/20160304/clash-of-clans-march-2016-update-major-clan-wars-matchmaking-changes-war-sizes-45v45-35v35-will-be-removed-more-emphasis-on-defensive-progress.htm</ref><ref>https://www.gottabemobile.com/clash-of-clans-update-clan-war-matchmaking-improved/</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://clashtoday.com/2016/04/01/clash-of-clans-update-march-2016/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 14, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114093613/https://clashtoday.com/2016/04/01/clash-of-clans-update-march-2016/ |archive-date=November 14, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The available war sizes are 50v50, 40v40, 30v30, 25v25, 20v20, 15v15, 10v10, and 5v5.<ref>http://www.player.one/clash-clans-update-5v5-clan-wars-ai-tweak-121591</ref><ref>https://forum.supercell.com/showthread.php/1648168-The-official-war-search-5vs5-thread</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWk1lP3LxdM</ref> In the May 2016 update, Friendly Challenges were introduced to allow clanmates to compete amongst other clanmates, however these challenges do not provide loot or trophies and do not affect a player's army.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clashofclans.com/blog/release-notes/friendly-challenge-update|title=May 2016 Update Clash of Clans.com|last=|first=|date=|website=Clash of Clans|access-date=August 26, 2016}}</ref> In the October 2018 update, Clan War Leagues were introduced. Clans would fight seven other clans to advance to the next league and earn league medals by earning stars in Clan War Leagues. The clans in the group with the most stars will be promoted to a higher league, while the clans in the group with the least stars will be demoted to a lower league.\n\n===Builder Base===\n[[File:Coc attack.png|thumb|260px|A player attacking another player's village in the builder base game mode]]\nFollowing an update on May 22, 2017, Supercell released the new \"Builder Base\" game mode to the game. It allows players to sail to a new island and create a new village with a different set of buildings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clashofclans.com/blog/news/welcome-to-the-builder-base|title=Welcome to the Builder Base! {{!}} Clash of Clans|website=Clash of Clans|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nIn the \"Builder Base\" game mode, players can attack each other's bases simultaneously. The player who deals the most damage or getting more stars can get rewards such as gold, elixir, and trophies. However, the gold and elixir can only be won for the first three victories made by the player within a twenty-four hour timeframe, but can continue attacking for trophies afterwards. \n\nPlayers can spend gems to speed up the in-game time. The progress will be much faster in this base with the introduction of Clock Tower (temporarily speeds the process in the entire Builder Base) and Gem Mine. A new hero, the Battle Machine, was also introduced along with this update. It is the only hero in the game that has a reusable ability named Electric Hammer. In March 2018, Builder Hall level 8 was released while the June 2019 update brought Builder Hall 9 which is currently the highest Builder Hall level. This update also brought OTTO Hut, a secondary builder that can only be unlocked by finishing a number of in game challenges. When unlocked the master builder can be moved between the Builder Base and the Home Village.<ref name=\"Newsweek\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/clash-clans-june-2019-update-release-6th-builder-balance-patch-notes-1444617|title=CLASH OF CLANS JUNE 2019 UPDATE|website=Newsweek|language=en|access-date=2019-10-08}}</ref>\n\n===Clan games and magic items===\nIn December 2017, Supercell introduced the Clan Games where clan members could work together to complete tasks, which would then earn clan points. When enough points are accumulated, a new reward tier unlocks, and players can select one reward from each unlocked tier. This update also introduced Magic Items, obtainable as rewards from Clan Games and through events. These items can be used e.g. to get resources, finish upgrades, or briefly add levels to troops or heroes.<ref>{{cite

The iOS version holds an aggregate score of 74 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]],<ref name=\"MC\" /> and 80% on [[GameRankings]].<ref name=\"GR\" />\n\n[[Gamezebo]]'s Leif Johnson was impressed, scoring the game 4.5 out of 5. Although he felt the gameplay was heavily skewed to encourage the player to purchase gems, he praised the addition of a single-player campaign. He concluded that \"''Clash of Clans'' is a simple game, but that's more of a strength than a weakness. It's simple enough to provide quick, painless matches on an [[iPhone]] in an idle moment, and there are enough different units to choose from in the battle mode to make playing against other players endlessly rewarding. Best of all, the option to fight against [[Non-player character|NPC]] goblins gives ''Clash of Clans'' a small edge over similar strategy games that rely almost entirely on player-versus-player combat.\"<ref name=\"Gamezebo\"/>\n\n[[Pocket Gamer]]'s Peter Willington was equally impressed, scoring the game 9 out of 10 and giving it a \"Gold Award\". Reviewing the game several months after it was released for iOS devices, Willington praised the game for requiring real strategy to play. He wrote that the gameplay was built on the progression of \"requiring more and more sophisticated units, asking you to strategise and really think about which elements you should focus on building within your camp.\" He concluded that \"''Clash of Clans'' is a superb game, freemium or otherwise, with more nuance than most give it credit for. That's why it's passed the test of time since its launch and still has an active community devotedly constructing elaborate fortresses in the hope of becoming invincible.\"<ref name=\"Pocket\"/>\n\n148App's Rob Rich scored the game 3.5 out of 5, writing \"It's great to play an online freemium game that doesn't shy away from the single-player experience but also offers up some honest-to-goodness direct interaction, which is a very rare combination these days. It probably won't warm the hearts of any haters out there, but it does give genre fans something with a bit more action and strategy than they might be used to.\"<ref name=\"148Apps\"/>  Tom's Guide enjoyed the player interaction.<ref name=\"tgcoc\"/>\n\nModojo's John Bedford scored the game 3 out of 5. He was critical of freemium gaming in general, writing \"The novelty hasn't just worn off this particular style of greedy gaming, it's shriveled up and condensed itself into an infinitely dense singularity of self-loathing.\" Of the game itself, he concluded, \"This is a game that follows in the footsteps of no small number of titles that have made feverish demands on our wallets in exchange for just a slightly thicker slice of the gameplay. It's possible you have an unending appetite for these [[micromanagement]] titles, in which case we recommend getting heartily stuck into Supercell's latest game. While ''Clash of Clans'' brings something new to accompany its competent but unexceptional empire gameplay, for most of us it'll be a case of too little, too late.\"<ref name=\"Modojo\"/>\n\n===Commercial reception===\n''Clash of Clans'' became an [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] top 5 download between December 2012 and May 2013,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-02/finlands-supercell-mobile-games-with-megaprofits |title=Finland's Supercell mobile games with megaprofits|magazine= [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date= May 2, 2013|last=Warner|first=Bernhard|accessdate=June 7, 2014}}</ref> and this success has been described as helping to usher in a new era in single-player gaming on mobile devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MichaelSchade/20130920/200688/Commanding_Troops_on_Touch_Devices__Why_Mobile_is_the_perfect_Platform_for_Strategy_MMOs.php | title= Commanding troops on touch devices -

''Clash of Clans'' tasks players to build their own village using the resources gained from attacking other players through the game's fighting features. The main resources are gold, elixir and dark elixir. Players can conjoin to create clans, groups of up to fifty people who can then participate in Clan Wars together, donate and receive troops, and chat with each other.\n\n''Clash of Clans'' was released to generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Clash of Clans gameplay.jpg|thumb|260px|A replay of gameplay, where a player is attacking another player's village]]\n''Clash of Clans'' is an online multiplayer game in which players form communities called clans, train troops, and attack other players to earn resources. There are four currencies or resources in the game.<ref name=\"gbcoc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.giantbomb.com/clash-of-clans/3030-40108/ |title=Clash of Clans |author=andalian |date=26 June 2016 |work=Giant Bomb |publisher=BS Interactive Inc |accessdate=3 July 2017 }}</ref>  Gold and elixir can be used to build and uppgrade defenses and traps that protect the player from other players' attacks and to build and uppgrade buildings. Elixir and dark elixir are also used to train and upgrade troops and spells.  Gems are the premium currency.<ref name=\"gbcoc\"/> Attacks are rated on a three-star scale and have a maximum timed length of three minutes.<ref name=\"gbcoc\"/>\n\nThe game also features a pseudo-single-player campaign in which the player can attack a series of fortified goblin villages<ref name=\"tgcoc\">{{cite web |url=https://downloads.tomsguide.com/Clash-of-Clans,0301-52982.html |title=Download Clash of Clans 8.116.2 for Android |work=Editors Review |publisher=Purch |accessdate=3 July 2017 }}</ref> and earn gold, elixir, and dark elixir (levels 51-75 only).

Elixir is used to train new troops, carry out research in the laboratory to upgrade troops, and to build and upgrade certain buildings, mostly pertaining to buildings used in attacking another player's base. Gold is used to build defensive buildings and to upgrade the town hall, which allows access to more buildings and higher levels for existing buildings. At Town Hall 7, dark elixir becomes available; this type of elixir is used to train and upgrade dark elixir troops, some heroes and create dark spells (available from Town Hall 8). The Eagle Artillery is a defensive building only available at Town Hall 11. Town Hall 11 also provides access to a new hero - The Grand Warden. It is the only hero born out of elixir. To earn and store dark elixir, players must build dark elixir drills and dark elixir storages. Town Hall 12 gets a defens called Giga Tesla, which is already built-in after the Town Hall 12 upgrade, while being upgraded to Town Hall 13, the Giga Inferno replaces the Giga Tesla. Town Hall 13 also unlocks of the following: Scattershot and Royal Champion.<ref name=\"Pocket\"/>\n\nThere are a number of buildings available to the player to defend their village, including cannons, mortars, bombs, teslas, traps, archer towers, wizard towers, inferno towers, eagle artilleries, and scattershots. Players can also build walls, which can be upgraded as a player's town hall level increases.<ref name=\"Pocket\"/><ref name=\"148Apps\"/>\n\n===Troops and spells===\nThe game has two kinds of barracks (barracks and dark barracks) and two kinds of spell factories (spell factory and dark spell factory). The barracks create troops using elixir, whereas dark barracks create troops using dark elixir.\n\nThe spell factories follow the same pattern - the normal spell factory creates spells using elixir, and the dark spell factory using dark elixir. All troops and spells have different properties. As the player progresses, several new troops and spells are able to be unlocked.\n\nAt Town Hall 12, the Workshop can be made. This building can make four types of siege machines: the Wall Wrecker, the Battle Blimp, the Stone Slammer, and the Siege Barracks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.supercheats.com/clash-of-clans/walkthrough/unit-guide|title=Clash of Clans Units}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clashofclansguidehq.com/units-list/|title=Clash of Clans Units List & Guide|date=February 18, 2014|access-date=August 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clashofclansnation.com/characters/|title=Characters|access-date=August 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clashofclans.com/clash-basics/troops|title=Official Website|website=Clash of Clans|access-date=August 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907193822/https://clashofclans.com/clash-basics/troops|archive-date=September 7, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clashofclans.com/clash-basics/spells|title=Spells {{!}} Clash of Clans|website=Clash of Clans|access-date=August 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907194713/https://clashofclans.com/clash-basics/spells|archive-date=September 7, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Clans and clan wars===\nClans are groups of players who join together to support each other, either materially (donating troops) or verbally (giving advice). Players can join clans once they rebuild the special Clan Castle building early on. A major component of the gameplay of ''Clash of Clans'' is clans facing off against one another in the \"clan wars\". Clan leaders and co-leaders can begin wars against other clans. Each clan is then given one \"preparation day\" and one \"war day.\" When a player attacks a member of the opposing clan, they receive stars based upon the amount of destruction they cause to the opponent's base, 50% damage or more gives 1 star, destroying the townhall also gives 1 star and destroying the entire base gives the remaining 3rd star. Each player is limited to two attacks per war and the team with the most stars at the end of the war day is declared victorious. If the two clans' number of stars are equal, then the victor is the one that has a greater percent of destruction. Players receive bonus war loot if he/she use their attacks in the war. This loot may be different on different bases and is decided by [[Supercell (video game company)|Supercell]]; the top base has the most war bonus loot and the last base has the least amount of bonus loot. If the clan wins the war, the bonus loot is fully delivered to the player but during a loss or draw one-third of the loot is delivered to the player.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://forum.supercell.net/showthread.php/232849-Clan-Wars-FAQ|title=Clan Wars FAQ |publisher=Supercell |date=April 4, 2014 | accessdate=June 9, 2014}}</ref> In the March 2016 update, 35v35 and 45v45 were removed.<ref>http://en.yibada.com/articles/107712/20160304/clash-of-clans-march-2016-update-major-clan-wars-matchmaking-changes-war-sizes-45v45-35v35-will-be-removed-more-emphasis-on-defensive-progress.htm</ref><ref>https://www.gottabemobile.com/clash-of-clans-update-clan-war-matchmaking-improved/</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://clashtoday.com/2016/04/01/clash-of-clans-update-march-2016/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 14, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114093613/https://clashtoday.com/2016/04/01/clash-of-clans-update-march-2016/ |archive-date=November 14, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The available war sizes are 50v50, 40v40, 30v30, 25v25, 20v20, 15v15, 10v10, and 5v5.<ref>http://www.player.one/clash-clans-update-5v5-clan-wars-ai-tweak-121591</ref><ref>https://forum.supercell.com/showthread.php/1648168-The-official-war-search-5vs5-thread</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWk1lP3LxdM</ref> In the May 2016 update, Friendly Challenges were introduced to allow clanmates to compete amongst other clanmates, however these challenges do not provide loot or trophies and do not affect a player's army.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clashofclans.com/blog/release-notes/friendly-challenge-update|title=May 2016 Update Clash of Clans.com|last=|first=|date=|website=Clash of Clans|access-date=August 26, 2016}}</ref> In the October 2018 update, Clan War Leagues were introduced. Clans would fight seven other clans to advance to the next league and earn league medals by earning stars in Clan War Leagues. The clans in the group with the most stars will be promoted to a higher league, while the clans in the group with the least stars will be demoted to a lower league.\n\n===Builder Base===\n[[File:Coc attack.png|thumb|260px|A player attacking another player's village in the builder base game mode]]\nFollowing an update on May 22, 2017, Supercell released the new \"Builder Base\" game mode to the game. It allows players to sail to a new island and create a new village with a different set of buildings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clashofclans.com/blog/news/welcome-to-the-builder-base|title=Welcome to the Builder Base! {{!}} Clash of Clans|website=Clash of Clans|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nIn the \"Builder Base\" game mode, players can attack each other's bases simultaneously. The player who deals the most damage or getting more stars can get rewards such as gold, elixir, and trophies. However, the gold and elixir can only be won for the first three victories made by the player within a twenty-four hour timeframe, but can continue attacking for trophies afterwards. \n\nPlayers can spend gems to speed up the in-game time. The progress will be much faster in this base with the introduction of Clock Tower (temporarily speeds the process in the entire Builder Base) and Gem Mine. A new hero, the Battle Machine, was also introduced along with this update. It is the only hero in the game that has a reusable ability named Electric Hammer. In March 2018, Builder Hall level 8 was released while the June 2019 update brought Builder Hall 9 which is currently the highest Builder Hall level. This update also brought OTTO Hut, a secondary builder that can only be unlocked by finishing a number of in game challenges. When unlocked the master builder can be moved between the Builder Base and the Home Village.<ref name=\"Newsweek\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/clash-clans-june-2019-update-release-6th-builder-balance-patch-notes-1444617|title=CLASH OF CLANS JUNE 2019 UPDATE|website=Newsweek|language=en|access-date=2019-10-08}}</ref>\n\n===Clan games and magic items===\nIn December 2017, Supercell introduced the Clan Games where clan members could work together to complete tasks, which would then earn clan points. When enough points are accumulated, a new reward tier unlocks, and players can select one reward from each unlocked tier. This update also introduced Magic Items, obtainable as rewards from Clan Games and through events. These items can be used e.g. to get resources, finish upgrades, or briefly add levels to troops or heroes.<ref>{{cite

The iOS version holds an aggregate score of 74 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]],<ref name=\"MC\" /> and 80% on [[GameRankings]].<ref name=\"GR\" />\n\n[[Gamezebo]]'s Leif Johnson was impressed, scoring the game 4.5 out of 5. Although he felt the gameplay was heavily skewed to encourage the player to purchase gems, he praised the addition of a single-player campaign. He concluded that \"''Clash of Clans'' is a simple game, but that's more of a strength than a weakness. It's simple enough to provide quick, painless matches on an [[iPhone]] in an idle moment, and there are enough different units to choose from in the battle mode to make playing against other players endlessly rewarding. Best of all, the option to fight against [[Non-player character|NPC]] goblins gives ''Clash of Clans'' a small edge over similar strategy games that rely almost entirely on player-versus-player combat.\"<ref name=\"Gamezebo\"/>\n\n[[Pocket Gamer]]'s Peter Willington was equally impressed, scoring the game 9 out of 10 and giving it a \"Gold Award\". Reviewing the game several months after it was released for iOS devices, Willington praised the game for requiring real strategy to play. He wrote that the gameplay was built on the progression of \"requiring more and more sophisticated units, asking you to strategise and really think about which elements you should focus on building within your camp.\" He concluded that \"''Clash of Clans'' is a superb game, freemium or otherwise, with more nuance than most give it credit for. That's why it's passed the test of time since its launch and still has an active community devotedly constructing elaborate fortresses in the hope of becoming invincible.\"<ref name=\"Pocket\"/>\n\n148App's Rob Rich scored the game 3.5 out of 5, writing \"It's great to play an online freemium game that doesn't shy away from the single-player experience but also offers up some honest-to-goodness direct interaction, which is a very rare combination these days. It probably won't warm the hearts of any haters out there, but it does give genre fans something with a bit more action and strategy than they might be used to.\"<ref name=\"148Apps\"/>  Tom's Guide enjoyed the player interaction.<ref name=\"tgcoc\"/>\n\nModojo's John Bedford scored the game 3 out of 5. He was critical of freemium gaming in general, writing \"The novelty hasn't just worn off this particular style of greedy gaming, it's shriveled up and condensed itself into an infinitely dense singularity of self-loathing.\" Of the game itself, he concluded, \"This is a game that follows in the footsteps of no small number of titles that have made feverish demands on our wallets in exchange for just a slightly thicker slice of the gameplay. It's possible you have an unending appetite for these [[micromanagement]] titles, in which case we recommend getting heartily stuck into Supercell's latest game. While ''Clash of Clans'' brings something new to accompany its competent but unexceptional empire gameplay, for most of us it'll be a case of too little, too late.\"<ref name=\"Modojo\"/>\n\n===Commercial reception===\n''Clash of Clans'' became an [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] top 5 download between December 2012 and May 2013,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-02/finlands-supercell-mobile-games-with-megaprofits |title=Finland's Supercell mobile games with megaprofits|magazine= [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date= May 2, 2013|last=Warner|first=Bernhard|accessdate=June 7, 2014}}</ref> and this success has been described as helping to usher in a new era in single-player gaming on mobile devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MichaelSchade/20130920/200688/Commanding_Troops_on_Touch_Devices__Why_Mobile_is_the_perfect_Platform_for_Strategy_MMOs.php | title= Commanding troops on touch devices - Why mobile is the perfect platform for strategy|publisher= [[Gamasutra]]|date= September 20, 2013|last=Schade |first=Michael|accessdate=June 7, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/jul/10/app-store-5-apple-ipad-iphone|title=Apple's App Store at 5: 10 key moments on the road to 50bn downloads|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=October 20, 2013|first=Stuart|last=Dredge|date=July 10, 2013}}</ref> In 2013, ''Clash of Clans'' was the third-highest game in revenue generated on the App Store and number one on [[Google Play]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/172349/why-free-games-are-increasingly-the-most-profitable-apps/|title=Why free games are increasingly the most profitable apps|publisher=qz.com|last=Mirani|first=Leo|date=January 30, 2014|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2014 it was reported that the game was generating $654,000 in daily revenue for Supercell.<ref name=\"gpd\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/report-clash-of-clans-generates-654-000-per-day/1100-6417656/ |title=Report: Clash of Clans generates $654,000 per day |author=Eddie Makuch |date=11 February 2014 |work=GameSpot |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc |accessdate=3 July 2017 }}</ref>  In 2015, the game was the top grossing app on both the App Store and Google Play, with an estimated revenue of 1.5 million dollars per day.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The top-grossing iPhone app makes a whopping $1.5 million a day|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/clash-of-clans-earns-15-million-a-day-as-top-grossing-app-2015-6|website = Business Insider|access-date = February 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Clash of Clans - Revenue estimates, app rankings & installs|url = https://thinkgaming.com/app-sales-data/1/clash-of-clans/|website = thinkgaming.com|access-date = February 4, 2016}}</ref> It is the fourth most installed app in the App Store and the seventh most installed app in the Play Store, where it had amassed 500 million downloads by 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/11/12/clash-clans-hits-500-million-downloads-play-store/|title=Clash of Clans hits 500 million downloads on the Play Store|date=2018-11-12|website=Android Police|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2018/07/02/all-time-most-popular-ios-apps-games/|title=These are the all-time most popular iOS apps and games from 2010-2018|last=Potuck|first=Michael|date=2018-07-02|website=9to5Mac|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref> As of 2018, ''Clash of Clans'' has generated more revenue than any app on the App Store,<ref name=\":0\" /> having brought in a revenue of over $6.4 billion dollars since its launch.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fogel |first=Stefanie |title=\u2018Clash Royale\u2019 Made $2.5 Billion in Revenue in Three Years (Analyst) |url=https://variety.com/2019/gaming/news/clash-royale-revenue-1203155393/ |website=Variety |accessdate=22 August 2019 |language=en |date=5 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Video Games}}\n* [[Game of War: Fire Age]]\n* [[Clash Royale]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://clashofclans.com}}\n* {{Official website|http://supercell.com/en/games/clashofclans/|Official website at Supercell}} \n* {{commons category-inline}}\n\n{{Supercell}}\n\n[[Category:2012 video games]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) games]]\n[[Category:Fantasy video games]]\n[[Category:Free-to-play video games]]\n[[Category:Video games containing battle passes]]\n[[Category:IOS games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Finland]]\n[[Category:Supercell (video game company) games]]\n", "name_user": "RamThakur001", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eSee also)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_of_Clans"}

It also works for overall economic growth of the country. The preamble of the Reserve Bank of India describes its main functions as:<blockquote>'''''..to regulate the issue of Bank Notes and keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage.'''''</blockquote>\n\n===Financial supervision===\nThe primary objective of RBI is to undertake consolidated supervision of the financial sector comprising commercial banks, financial institutions, and non-banking finance companies.\n\nThe board is constituted by co-opting four directors from the Central Board as members for a term of two years and is chaired by the governor. The deputy governors of the reserve bank are ex-officio members. One deputy governor, usually the deputy governor in charge of banking regulation and supervision, is nominated as the vice-chairman  of the board. The board is required to meet normally once every month. It considers inspection reports and other supervisory issues placed before it by the supervisory departments.\n\nBFS through the Audit Sub-Committee also aims at upgrading the quality of the statutory audit and internal audit functions in banks and financial institutions. The audit sub-committee includes deputy governor as the chairman and two directors of the Central Board as members. The BFS oversees the functioning of the Department of Banking Supervision (DBS), the Department of Non-Banking Supervision (DNBS) and the Financial Institutions Division (FID) and gives directions on the regulatory and supervisory issues.\n\n===Regulator and supervisor of the financial system===\nThe institution is also the regulator and supervisor of the financial system and prescribes broad parameters of banking operations within which the country's banking and financial system functions. Its objectives are to maintain public confidence in the system, protect depositors' interest and provide cost-effective banking services to the public. The ''Banking Ombudsman Scheme'' has been formulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for effective addressing of complaints by bank customers. The RBI controls the monetary supply, monitors economic indicators like the [[gross domestic product]] and has to decide the design of the rupee banknotes as well as coins.<ref name=\"RBI1\">[http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=39 RBI, Frequently Asked Questions, Currency Matters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112123135/http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=39 |date=12 January 2012 }} (RBI)</ref>\n\n===Regulator and supervisor of the payment and settlement systems===\nPayment and settlement systems play an important role in improving overall economic efficiency. The Payment and Settlement Systems Act of 2007 (PSS Act)<ref>[http://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Publications/PDFs/86706.pdf The Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007]. rbi.org.in</ref> gives the Reserve Bank oversight authority, including regulation and supervision, for the payment and settlement systems in the country. In this role, the RBI focuses on the development and functioning of safe, secure and efficient payment and settlement mechanisms. Two payment systems [[National Electronic Fund Transfer]] (NEFT) and Real-Time Gross Settlement ([[real-time gross settlement|RTGS]]) allow individuals, companies and firms to transfer funds from one bank to another. These facilities can only be used for transferring money within the country.\n\nNEFT operates on a deferred net settlement (DNS) basis and settles transactions in batches. The settlement takes place for all transactions received until a particular cut-off time. It operates in hourly batches \u2014 there are twelve settlements from 8&nbsp;am to 7&nbsp;pm on weekdays and six between 8&nbsp;am and 1&nbsp;pm on Saturdays.<ref>[http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=60 Frequently Asked Questions]. rbi.org.in (24 November 2017)</ref> Any transaction initiated after the designated time would have to wait until the next settlement time. In RTGS, transactions are processed continuously, all through the business hours. RBI's settlement time is 9&nbsp;am to 4:30&nbsp;pm on weekdays and 9&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;pm on Saturdays.<ref>[http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=65 Frequently Asked Questions]. rbi.org.in (10 December 2018)</ref>\n\n===Banker and debt manager to government===\nJust as individuals need a bank to carry out their financial transactions effectively and efficiently, governments also need a bank to carry out their financial transactions. The RBI serves this purpose for the Government of India (GoI). As a banker to the GoI, the RBI maintains its accounts, receive payments into and make payments out of these accounts. The RBI also helps the GoI to raise money from the public via issuing bonds and government-approved securities. In Sep 2019, a decision at RBI directors meet was taken to change the RBI financial accounting year to March\u2013April to align itself with the central government calendar instead of the current June\u2013July year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/finance/after-nearly-8-decades-rbi-to-change-its-accounting-year-to-april-march-119082700038_1.html|title=After nearly 8 decades, RBI to change its accounting year to April\u2013March|last=Jha|first=Somesh|date=27 August 2019|work=Business Standard India|access-date=3 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Managing foreign exchange===\nThe central bank manages to reach different goals of the ''[[Foreign Exchange Management Act|Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999]]''. Their objective is to facilitate external trade and payment and promote orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in India.\n\nWith the increasing integration of the Indian economy with the global economy arising from greater trade and capital flows, the [[foreign exchange market]] has evolved as a key segment of the Indian financial market and the RBI has an important role to play in regulating and managing this segment. The RBI manages forex and gold reserves of the nation.\n\nOn a given day, the foreign exchange rate reflects the demand for and supply of foreign exchange arising from trade and capital transactions. The RBI's Financial Markets Department (FMD) participates in the foreign exchange market by undertaking sales/purchases of foreign currency to ease volatility in periods of excess demand for/supply of foreign currency.\n\n===Issue of currency===\nOther than the Government of India, the Reserve Bank of India is the sole body authorised to issue banknotes in India.\n\nThe bank also destroys banknotes when they are not fit for circulation. All the money issued by the central bank is its monetary liability, i.e., the central bank is obliged to back the currency with assets of equal value,  to enhance public confidence in paper currency. The objectives are to issue banknotes and give the public adequate supply of the same, to maintain the currency and credit system of the country to utilise it in its best advantage, and to maintain the reserves.\n\nThe RBI maintains the economic structure of the country so that it can achieve the objective of price stability as well as economic development because both objectives are diverse in themselves.\n\nFor the printing of notes, RBI uses four facilities:<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Content/PDFs/FUNCWWE080910.pdf|title=RBI, Right To Information Doc, Pg 29/30}}</ref>\n* The [[Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Limited]] (SPMCIL), a wholly owned company of the Government of India, has printing presses at [[Nashik]], Maharashtra and [[Dewas]], Madhya Pradesh.\n* The [[Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Private Limited]] (BRBNMPL), owned by the RBI, has printing facilities in [[Mysore]], Karnataka and [[Salboni]], West Bengal.\n\nFor the minting of coins, SPMCIL has four mints at [[Mumbai]], [[Noida]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Hyderabad]] for coin production.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nWhilst coins are minted by, and [[Indian 1-rupee note|{{INR}}1 notes]] are issued by the Government of India (GoI), the RBI works as an agent of GoI for the distribution and handling of coins. RBI also works to prevent counterfeiting of currency by regularly upgrading security features of currency.\n\nThe RBI is authorised to issue notes with face values of up to {{INR}}10,000 and coins up to {{INR}}1,000 rupees.\n\nNew [[Indian 500-rupee note|{{INR}}500]] and [[Indian 2000-rupee note|{{INR}}2,000]] notes were been issued on 8 November 2016. The old series of [[Indian 1000-rupee note|{{INR}}1,000]] and {{INR}}500 notes were demonetized from midnight on 8 November 2016.\n\nEarlier {{INR}}1,000 notes have been discarded by the RBI.\n\n===Banker's bank===\n[[File:Nagpur Reserve Bank.JPG|thumb|[[Nagpur]] branch holds most of India's gold deposits.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rbi.org.in/regionalbranch/nagpur/profile.aspx | title=Reserve Bank of India \u2013 Nagpur \u2013 Profile}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rbi.org.in/regionalbranch/nagpur/nagpur.aspx | title=Reserve Bank of India \u2013 Nagpur}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/AnnualReportPublications.aspx?Id=1239 | title=Reserve Bank of India \u2013 Annual Report}}</ref><ref name=\"nagpurtoday1\">{{cite web | url=https://www.nagpurtoday.in/old-gold-lying-in-nagpur-may-boost-forex-as-rbi-plans-to-swap-the-metal-with-purer-stuff/07022015 | title=Old gold lying in Nagpur may boost forex as RBI plans to swap the metal with purer stuff}}</ref>]]\n\nReserve Bank of India also works as a central bank where commercial banks are account holders and can deposit money. RBI maintains banking accounts of all scheduled banks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/|title=Reserve Bank of India \u2013 India's Central Bank|work=rbi.org.in}}</ref> Commercial banks create credit. It is the duty of the RBI to control the credit through the CRR, repo rate and open market operations. As banker's bank, the RBI facilitates the clearing of cheques between the commercial banks and helps the inter-bank transfer of funds. It can grant financial accommodation to schedule banks. It acts as the lender of the last resort by providing emergency advances to the banks.\n\n===Regulator of the Banking System===\nRBI has the responsibility of regulating the nation's financial system. As a regulator and supervisor of the Indian banking system it ensures financial stability & public confidence in the banking system. RBI uses methods like On-site inspections, off-site surveillance, scrutiny & periodic meetings to supervise new bank licences, setting capital requirements and regulating interest rates in specific areas. RBI is currently focused on implementing norms.\n\n===Detection of fake currency===\nTo curb the [[counterfeit money]] problem in India, RBI has launched a website to raise awareness among masses about fake banknotes in the market. [https://paisaboltahai.rbi.org.in/ www.paisaboltahai.rbi.org.in] provides information about identifying fake currency.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/RBI-launches-website-to-explain-detection-of-fake-currency/articleshow/14742791.cms | title=RBI launches website to explain detection of fake currency | date=8 July 2012 | work=Times of India}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 January 2014; RBI gave a press release stating that after 31 March 2014, it will completely withdraw from circulation of all banknotes issued prior to 2005. From 1 April 2014, the public will be required to approach banks for exchanging these notes. Banks will provide exchange facility for these notes until further communication. The reserve bank has also clarified that the notes issued before 2005 will continue to be legal tender. This would mean that banks are required to exchange the notes for their customers as well as for non-customers. From 1 July 2014, however, to exchange more than 15 pieces of `500 and `1000 notes, non-customers will have to furnish proof of identity and residence as well as show ''aadhar'' to the bank branch in which he/she wants to exchange the notes.\n\nThis move from the reserve bank is expected to unearth black money held in cash. As the new currency notes have added increased security features, they would help in curbing the menace of fake currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=30458|title=Reserve Bank of India|work=rbi.org.in}}</ref>\n\n===Developmental role===\nThe central bank has to perform a wide range of promotional functions to support national objectives and industries.<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\"/> The RBI faces a lot of inter-sectoral and local inflation-related problems. Some of these problems are results of the dominant part of the public sector.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00181-007-0123-8|title=Price convergence across regions in India|journal=Empirical Economics|volume=34|issue=2|pages=299\u2013313|year=2008|last1=Das|first1=Samarjit|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=Kaushik|hdl=10419/22907}}</ref>\n\nKey tools in this effort include Priority Sector Lending such as agriculture, micro and small enterprises (MSE), housing and education.

When the repo rate increases, borrowing from RBI becomes more expensive. If RBI wants to make it more expensive for the banks to borrow money, it increases the repo rate similarly, if it wants to make it cheaper for banks to borrow money it reduces the repo rate. If the repo rate is increased, banks can't carry out their business at a profit whereas the very opposite happens when the repo rate is cut down. Generally, repo rates are cut down whenever the country needs to progress in banking and economy.\n\nIf banks want to borrow money (for short term, usually overnight) from RBI then banks have to charge this interest rate. Banks have to pledge government securities as collateral. This kind of deal happens through a re-purchase agreement. If a bank wants to borrow, it has to provide government securities at least worth {{INR}}100&nbsp;crore (could be more because of margin requirement which is 5%\u201310% of loan amount) and agree to repurchase them at {{INRConvert|106.5|c}} at the end of borrowing period. So the bank has paid {{INRConvert|6.5|c}} as interest. This is the reason it is called repo rate.\n\nThe government securities which are provided by banks as collateral can not come from {{abbr|SLR|statutory liquidity ratio}} quota (otherwise the SLR will go below 19.5% of {{abbr|NDTL|net demand and time liabilities}} and attract penalties).\n\nTo curb inflation, the RBI increases repo rate which will make borrowing costs for banks. Banks will pass this increased cost to their customers which make borrowing costly in the whole economy. Fewer people will apply for loans and aggregate demand will be reduced. This will result in inflation coming down. The RBI does the opposite to fight deflation. When the RBI reduces the repo rate, banks are not legally required to reduce their own [[base rate]].\n\nThe present repo rate is 4.40%.<ref>{{cite web |title=RBI Repo Rate - RBI repo rate news, RBI rate cut announcement, repo rate slashed news |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/rbi-repo-rate |website=The Economic Times |accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Reverse repo rate (RRR)===\n{{see|Repurchase agreement#Reverse repo}}\nAs the name suggest, [[reverse repo]] rate is just the opposite of repo rate. Reverse repo rate is the short term borrowing rate at which RBI borrows money from banks. The reserve bank uses this tool when it feels there is too much money floating in the banking system. An increase in the reverse repo rate means that the banks will get a higher rate of interest from RBI. As a result, banks prefer to lend their money to RBI which is always safe instead of lending it to others (people, companies, etc.) which is always risky.\n\nRepo rate signifies the rate at which liquidity is injected into the banking system by RBI, whereas reverse repo rate signifies the rate at which the central bank absorbs liquidity from the banks. Currently, reverse repo rate is pegged to be 0.25% (or 25 bit/s) below the repo rate.\n\n===Statutory liquidity ratio (SLR)===\n{{see|Reserve requirement}}\nApart from the {{abbr|CRR|cash reserve ratio}}, banks are required to maintain liquid assets in the form of gold, cash and approved securities. Higher liquidity ratio forces commercial banks to maintain a larger proportion of their resources in liquid form and thus reduces their capacity to grant loans and advances, thus it is an anti-inflationary impact. A higher liquidity ratio diverts the bank funds from loans and advances to investment in government and approved securities.\n\nIn well-developed economies, central banks use [[open market operation]]s\u2014buying and selling of eligible securities by the central bank in the money market\u2014to influence the volume of cash reserves with commercial banks and thus influence the volume of loans and advances they can make to the commercial and industrial sectors. In the open money market, government securities are traded at market-related rates of interest. The RBI is resorting increasing to open market operations in recent years. Generally, the RBI uses\n#Minimum margins for lending against specific securities.\n#A ceiling on the amounts of credit for certain purposes.\n#The discriminatory rate of interest charged on certain types of advances.\n\nDirect credit controls in India are of three types:\n#Part of the interest rate structure, i.e., on small savings and provident funds, are administratively set.\n#Banks are mandatory required to keep 19.50% of their NDTL (net demand and time liabilities) in the form of liquid assets.\n#Banks are required to lend to the priority sectors to the extent of 40% of their advances.\n\nThe share of net demand and time liabilities that banks must maintain in safe and liquid assets, such as government securities, cash, and gold. Here it would be pertinent to mention the gold swap of July 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/RBI-initiates-swap-of-old-gold-with-new-one/articleshow/37907102.cms | title=RBI initiates swap of old gold with new one \u2013 Times of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.businesstoday.in/current/policy/reserve-bank-of-india-initiates-swap-of-old-gold-with-new/story/207890.html | title=Reserve Bank of India initiates swap of old gold with new one}}</ref><ref>name=\"nagpurtoday1\"</ref> The present SLR is 18.75%.\n\n===Bank rate===\n{{see|Bank rate}}\nBank rate is defined in Section 49 of the RBI Act of 1934 as the \u2018standard rate at which RBI is prepared to buy or rediscount bills of exchange or other commercial papers eligible for purchase'. When banks want to borrow long term funds from the RBI, it is the interest rate which the RBI charges to them. It is currently set to 5.40%.<ref name=\"moneycontrol.com\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rbi-cuts-repo-rate-by-25-bps/article29593190.ece/amp/|title= rbi-cuts-repo-rate-by-25-bps|newspaper=thehindu|access-date=4 October 2019}}</ref> The bank rate is not used to control money supply, but penal rates continue to be linked to the bank rate. If a bank fails to meet {{abbr|SLR|statutory liquidity ratio}} or {{abbr|CRR|cash reserve ratio}} requirements then the RBI will impose a penalty of 300 [[basis point]]s above bank rate.\n\n===Liquidity adjustment facility (LAF)===\n{{see|Liquidity adjustment facility}}\n[[Liquidity adjustment facility]] was introduced in 2000. LAF is a facility provided by the Reserve Bank of India to scheduled commercial banks to avail of liquidity in case of need or to park excess funds with the RBI on an overnight basis against the collateral of government securities.\n\nRBI accepts applications for a minimum amount of {{INRConvert|5|c|lk=c}} and in multiples of {{INR}}5&nbsp;crore thereafter.\n\n===Cash reserve ratio (CRR)===\nCRR refers to the ratio of bank's cash reserve balances with RBI with reference to the bank's net demand and time liabilities to ensure the liquidity and solvency of the scheduled banks. The share of net demand and time liabilities that banks must maintain as cash with the RBI. The RBI has set CRR at 4%. A 1% change in CRR affects the economy by {{INRConvert|1000000|c|lk=c}}. An increase draw this amount from the economy, while a decrease injects this amount into the economy. So if a bank has {{INRConvert|200|c}} of {{abbr|NDTL|net demand and time liabilities}} then it has to keep {{INRConvert|8|c}} in cash with RBI. RBI pays no interest on CRR.\n\nLet's assume the economy is showing inflationary trends and the RBI wants to control this situation by adjusting {{abbr|SLR|statutory liquidity ratio}} and CRR. If the RBI increases SLR to 50% and CRR to 20% then bank will be left only with {{INRConvert|60|c}} for operations. Now it will be very difficult for the bank to maintain profitability with such a small amount of capital. The bank will be left with no choice but to raise its interest rate which will make borrowing by its customers more costly. This will in turn reduce the overall demand and hence prices will eventually come down.\n\n===Open market operation (OMO)===\n{{see|Open market operation}}\nOpen market operation is the activity of buying and selling of government securities in open market to control the supply of money in banking system. When there is excess supply of money, central bank sells government securities thereby sucking out excess liquidity. Similarly, when liquidity is tight, RBI will buy government securities and thereby inject money supply into the economy.\n\nOn 23 March 2020, Reserve Bank of India infuse Rs 1 lakh crore through term repo auction, a massive [[Open market operation|OMOs (open market operations)]] purchase of government securities. The Reserve Bank is monitoring the financial market conditions and liquidity situation in the economy as [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India]] fears of a recession.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/coronovirus-scare-rbi-announces-omos-purchase-of-rs-1-lakh-crore-to-boost-liquidity/story/398973.html|title=Coronavirus scare: RBI announces OMOs purchase of Rs 1 lakh crore to boost liquidity|date=23 March 2020|website=Business Today|access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Marginal standing facility (MSF)===\nThis scheme was introduced in May 2011 and all the scheduled commercial bank can participate in this scheme. Banks can borrow up to 2.5%<ref>[https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8248&Mode=0 Reserve Bank of India \u2013 Notifications]. Rbi.org.in. Retrieved on 26 December 2018.</ref> percent of their respective net demand and time liabilities. The RBI receives application under this facility for a minimum amount of Rs.&nbsp;1 crore and in multiples of Rs.&nbsp;1 crore thereafter.\n\nThe important difference from repo rate is that bank can pledge government securities from its SLR quota (up to one percent). So even if SLR goes below 20.5%<ref>RBI/2014-15/445 DBR.Ret.BC.70/12.02.001/2014-15, dt. 16 October 2016</ref> by pledging SLR quota securities under MSF, the bank will not have to pay any penalty. The MSF rate is set to 100 [[basis point]]s above bank rate and currently is at 5.65% as of 7 August 2019.<ref name=\"moneycontrol.com\"/>\n\n==Qualitative tools==\n===Margin requirements===\n{{see|Loan-to-value ratio}}\nLoan-to-value (LTV) is the ratio of loan amount to the actual value of asset purchased.\n\nThe RBI regulates this ratio so as to control the amount a bank can lend to its customers. For example, an individual wants to buy a car using borrowed money and the car's value is {{INRConvert|10|l|lk=l}}. If the LTV is set to 70% he can borrow a maximum of {{INRConvert|7|l}}.\n\nThe RBI can decrease or increase to curb inflation or deflation respectively.\n\n===Selective credit control===\nUnder this measure, the RBI can specifically instruct banks not to give loans to traders of certain commodities e.g. sugar, edible oil, etc.\n\nThis prevents the speculation/hoarding of commodities using money borrowed from banks.\n\n===Moral suasion===\n{{see|Moral suasion}}\nUnder this measure, the RBI try to persuade banks through meetings, conferences, media statements to do specific things under certain economic trends. For example, when the RBI reduces repo rate, it asks banks to reduce their base rate as well. Another example of this measure is to ask banks to reduce their [[non-performing loan|non-performing asset]]s.\n\n==Limitations of monetary policy==\nIn developing countries like India, monetary policy fails to show immediate or no results because the following factors:\n\n# People do not employ alternative investment options. A large section of society still depends on saving accounts, fixed deposits, Public Provident Fund for investment. Commercial banks have large deposits. RBI is not the main or even prominent money supplier for these banks. So whatever monetary action central bank takes has little or late impact on the economy.\n# Many people in rural areas are out of the banking net and whatever the RBI does, has no impact on their financial activities.\n# Monsoon uncertainty adversely affects food production and thereby cause food inflation. Monetary policy has no impact on food inflation.\n\n==RTGS and NEFT transactions' charges removal==\n\nRBI decided to remove charges on RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement System) and NEFT ([[National Electronic Funds Transfer]]).<ref>{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/69673075.cms |newspaper=Times of India | title=RBI removes charges on NEFT, RTGS transactions | date=6 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Regulation of variable pay of bank management ==\nIn November, RBI introduced a set of draft guidelines to regulate the variable pay of CEOs and top management at private banks. The new rules are in line with the Sound Compensation Practices issued by the Financial Stability Board in April 2009. The rules will apply to CEOs, wholetime directors, and material risk takers at private banks, small finance banks and domestic executives of foreign banks. As per the new rules at least 50% of the pay should be based on individual, unit, business and firm wide performance evaluation which will be capped at 300% of the fixed pay. In case of variable pay above 200% then at least 50% of this amount should be via non cash instruments. Share linked instruments are included as part of variable pay. Guaranteed bonus should not be part of the compensation package except in case of joining bonus. The RBI also has put clauses in place to clawback/malus in case of deteriorating performance. The bank shall identify a representative set of conditions when the recovery clause for clawback /malus can be invoked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/rbi-clamps-down-on-variable-pay-of-top-management-at-private-banks|title=RBI Clamps Down On Variable Pay Of Top Management At Private Banks|website=BloombergQuint|language=en|access-date=5 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\nA report titled \"Trend and Progress of Banking In India\" is published annually, as required by the ''[[Banking Regulation Act, 1949]]''.

It also works for overall economic growth of the country. The preamble of the Reserve Bank of India describes its main functions as:<blockquote>'''''..to regulate the issue of Bank Notes and keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage.'''''</blockquote>\n\n===Financial supervision===\nThe primary objective of RBI is to undertake consolidated supervision of the financial sector comprising commercial banks, financial institutions, and non-banking finance companies.\n\nThe board is constituted by co-opting four directors from the Central Board as members for a term of two years and is chaired by the governor. The deputy governors of the reserve bank are ex-officio members. One deputy governor, usually the deputy governor in charge of banking regulation and supervision, is nominated as the vice-chairman of the board. The board is required to meet normally once every month. It considers inspection reports and other supervisory issues placed before it by the supervisory departments.\n\nBFS through the Audit Sub-Committee also aims at upgrading the quality of the statutory audit and internal audit functions in banks and financial institutions. The audit sub-committee includes deputy governor as the chairman and two directors of the Central Board as members. The BFS oversees the functioning of the Department of Banking Supervision (DBS), the Department of Non-Banking Supervision (DNBS) and the Financial Institutions Division (FID) and gives directions on the regulatory and supervisory issues.\n\n===Regulator and supervisor of the financial system===\nThe institution is also the regulator and supervisor of the financial system and prescribes broad parameters of banking operations within which the country's banking and financial system functions. Its objectives are to maintain public confidence in the system, protect depositors' interest and provide cost-effective banking services to the public. The ''Banking Ombudsman Scheme'' has been formulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for effective addressing of complaints by bank customers. The RBI controls the monetary supply, monitors economic indicators like the [[gross domestic product]] and has to decide the design of the rupee banknotes as well as coins.<ref name=\"RBI1\">[http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=39 RBI, Frequently Asked Questions, Currency Matters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112123135/http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=39 |date=12 January 2012 }} (RBI)</ref>\n\n===Regulator and supervisor of the payment and settlement systems===\nPayment and settlement systems play an important role in improving overall economic efficiency. The Payment and Settlement Systems Act of 2007 (PSS Act)<ref>[http://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Publications/PDFs/86706.pdf The Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007]. rbi.org.in</ref> gives the Reserve Bank oversight authority, including regulation and supervision, for the payment and settlement systems in the country. In this role, the RBI focuses on the development and functioning of safe, secure and efficient payment and settlement mechanisms. Two payment systems [[National Electronic Fund Transfer]] (NEFT) and Real-Time Gross Settlement ([[real-time gross settlement|RTGS]]) allow individuals, companies and firms to transfer funds from one bank to another. These facilities can only be used for transferring money within the country.\n\nNEFT operates on a deferred net settlement (DNS) basis and settles transactions in batches. The settlement takes place for all transactions received until a particular cut-off time. It operates in hourly batches \u2014 there are twelve settlements from 8&nbsp;am to 7&nbsp;pm on weekdays and six between 8&nbsp;am and 1&nbsp;pm on Saturdays.<ref>[http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=60 Frequently Asked Questions]. rbi.org.in (24 November 2017)</ref> Any transaction initiated after the designated time would have to wait until the next settlement time. In RTGS, transactions are processed continuously, all through the business hours. RBI's settlement time is 9&nbsp;am to 4:30&nbsp;pm on weekdays and 9&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;pm on Saturdays.<ref>[http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=65 Frequently Asked Questions]. rbi.org.in (10 December 2018)</ref>\n\n===Banker and debt manager to government===\nJust as individuals need a bank to carry out their financial transactions effectively and efficiently, governments also need a bank to carry out their financial transactions. The RBI serves this purpose for the Government of India (GoI). As a banker to the GoI, the RBI maintains its accounts, receive payments into and make payments out of these accounts. The RBI also helps the GoI to raise money from the public via issuing bonds and government-approved securities. In Sep 2019, a decision at RBI directors meet was taken to change the RBI financial accounting year to March\u2013April to align itself with the central government calendar instead of the current June\u2013July year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/finance/after-nearly-8-decades-rbi-to-change-its-accounting-year-to-april-march-119082700038_1.html|title=After nearly 8 decades, RBI to change its accounting year to April\u2013March|last=Jha|first=Somesh|date=27 August 2019|work=Business Standard India|access-date=3 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Managing foreign exchange===\nThe central bank manages to reach different goals of the ''[[Foreign Exchange Management Act|Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999]]''. Their objective is to facilitate external trade and payment and promote orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in India.\n\nWith the increasing integration of the Indian economy with the global economy arising from greater trade and capital flows, the [[foreign exchange market]] has evolved as a key segment of the Indian financial market and the RBI has an important role to play in regulating and managing this segment. The RBI manages forex and gold reserves of the nation.\n\nOn a given day, the foreign exchange rate reflects the demand for and supply of foreign exchange arising from trade and capital transactions. The RBI's Financial Markets Department (FMD) participates in the foreign exchange market by undertaking sales/purchases of foreign currency to ease volatility in periods of excess demand for/supply of foreign currency.\n\n===Issue of currency===\nOther than the Government of India, the Reserve Bank of India is the sole body authorised to issue banknotes in India.\n\nThe bank also destroys banknotes when they are not fit for circulation. All the money issued by the central bank is its monetary liability, i.e., the central bank is obliged to back the currency with assets of equal value,  to enhance public confidence in paper currency. The objectives are to issue banknotes and give the public adequate supply of the same, to maintain the currency and credit system of the country to utilise it in its best advantage, and to maintain the reserves.\n\nThe RBI maintains the economic structure of the country so that it can achieve the objective of price stability as well as economic development because both objectives are diverse in themselves.\n\nFor the printing of notes, RBI uses four facilities:<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Content/PDFs/FUNCWWE080910.pdf|title=RBI, Right To Information Doc, Pg 29/30}}</ref>\n* The [[Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Limited]] (SPMCIL), a wholly owned company of the Government of India, has printing presses at [[Nashik]], Maharashtra and [[Dewas]], Madhya Pradesh.\n* The [[Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Private Limited]] (BRBNMPL), owned by the RBI, has printing facilities in [[Mysore]], Karnataka and [[Salboni]], West Bengal.\n\nFor the minting of coins, SPMCIL has four mints at [[Mumbai]], [[Noida]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Hyderabad]] for coin production.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nWhilst coins are minted by, and [[Indian 1-rupee note|{{INR}}1 notes]] are issued by the Government of India (GoI), the RBI works as an agent of GoI for the distribution and handling of coins. RBI also works to prevent counterfeiting of currency by regularly upgrading security features of currency.\n\nThe RBI is authorised to issue notes with face values of up to {{INR}}10,000 and coins up to {{INR}}1,000 rupees.\n\nNew [[Indian 500-rupee note|{{INR}}500]] and [[Indian 2000-rupee note|{{INR}}2,000]] notes were been issued on 8 November 2016. The old series of [[Indian 1000-rupee note|{{INR}}1,000]] and {{INR}}500 notes were demonetized from midnight on 8 November 2016.\n\nEarlier {{INR}}1,000 notes have been discarded by the RBI.\n\n===Banker's bank===\n[[File:Nagpur Reserve Bank.JPG|thumb|[[Nagpur]] branch holds most of India's gold deposits.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rbi.org.in/regionalbranch/nagpur/profile.aspx | title=Reserve Bank of India \u2013 Nagpur \u2013 Profile}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rbi.org.in/regionalbranch/nagpur/nagpur.aspx | title=Reserve Bank of India \u2013 Nagpur}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/AnnualReportPublications.aspx?Id=1239 | title=Reserve Bank of India \u2013 Annual Report}}</ref><ref name=\"nagpurtoday1\">{{cite web | url=https://www.nagpurtoday.in/old-gold-lying-in-nagpur-may-boost-forex-as-rbi-plans-to-swap-the-metal-with-purer-stuff/07022015 | title=Old gold lying in Nagpur may boost forex as RBI plans to swap the metal with purer stuff}}</ref>]]\n\nReserve Bank of India also works as a central bank where commercial banks are account holders and can deposit money. RBI maintains banking accounts of all scheduled banks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/|title=Reserve Bank of India \u2013 India's Central Bank|work=rbi.org.in}}</ref> Commercial banks create credit. It is the duty of the RBI to control the credit through the CRR, repo rate and open market operations. As banker's bank, the RBI facilitates the clearing of cheques between the commercial banks and helps the inter-bank transfer of funds. It can grant financial accommodation to schedule banks. It acts as the lender of the last resort by providing emergency advances to the banks.\n\n===Regulator of the Banking System===\nRBI has the responsibility of regulating the nation's financial system. As a regulator and supervisor of the Indian banking system it ensures financial stability & public confidence in the banking system. RBI uses methods like On-site inspections, off-site surveillance, scrutiny & periodic meetings to supervise new bank licences, setting capital requirements and regulating interest rates in specific areas. RBI is currently focused on implementing norms.\n\n===Detection of fake currency===\nTo curb the [[counterfeit money]] problem in India, RBI has launched a website to raise awareness among masses about fake banknotes in the market. [https://paisaboltahai.rbi.org.in/ www.paisaboltahai.rbi.org.in] provides information about identifying fake currency.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/RBI-launches-website-to-explain-detection-of-fake-currency/articleshow/14742791.cms | title=RBI launches website to explain detection of fake currency | date=8 July 2012 | work=Times of India}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 January 2014; RBI gave a press release stating that after 31 March 2014, it will completely withdraw from circulation of all banknotes issued prior to 2005. From 1 April 2014, the public will be required to approach banks for exchanging these notes. Banks will provide exchange facility for these notes until further communication. The reserve bank has also clarified that the notes issued before 2005 will continue to be legal tender. This would mean that banks are required to exchange the notes for their customers as well as for non-customers. From 1 July 2014, however, to exchange more than 15 pieces of `500 and `1000 notes, non-customers will have to furnish proof of identity and residence as well as show ''aadhar'' to the bank branch in which he/she wants to exchange the notes.\n\nThis move from the reserve bank is expected to unearth black money held in cash. As the new currency notes have added increased security features, they would help in curbing the menace of fake currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=30458|title=Reserve Bank of India|work=rbi.org.in}}</ref>\n\n===Developmental role===\nThe central bank has to perform a wide range of promotional functions to support national objectives and industries.<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\"/> The RBI faces a lot of inter-sectoral and local inflation-related problems. Some of these problems are results of the dominant part of the public sector.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00181-007-0123-8|title=Price convergence across regions in India|journal=Empirical Economics|volume=34|issue=2|pages=299\u2013313|year=2008|last1=Das|first1=Samarjit|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=Kaushik|hdl=10419/22907}}</ref>\n\nKey tools in this effort include Priority Sector Lending such as agriculture, micro and small enterprises (MSE), housing and education.

When the repo rate increases, borrowing from RBI becomes more expensive. If RBI wants to make it more expensive for the banks to borrow money, it increases the repo rate similarly, if it wants to make it cheaper for banks to borrow money it reduces the repo rate. If the repo rate is increased, banks can't carry out their business at a profit whereas the very opposite happens when the repo rate is cut down. Generally, repo rates are cut down whenever the country needs to progress in banking and economy.\n\nIf banks want to borrow money (for short term, usually overnight) from RBI then banks have to charge this interest rate. Banks have to pledge government securities as collateral. This kind of deal happens through a re-purchase agreement. If a bank wants to borrow, it has to provide government securities at least worth {{INR}}100&nbsp;crore (could be more because of margin requirement which is 5%\u201310% of loan amount) and agree to repurchase them at {{INRConvert|106.5|c}} at the end of borrowing period. So the bank has paid {{INRConvert|6.5|c}} as interest. This is the reason it is called repo rate.\n\nThe government securities which are provided by banks as collateral can not come from {{abbr|SLR|statutory liquidity ratio}} quota (otherwise the SLR will go below 19.5% of {{abbr|NDTL|net demand and time liabilities}} and attract penalties).\n\nTo curb inflation, the RBI increases repo rate which will make borrowing costs for banks. Banks will pass this increased cost to their customers which make borrowing costly in the whole economy. Fewer people will apply for loans and aggregate demand will be reduced. This will result in inflation coming down. The RBI does the opposite to fight deflation. When the RBI reduces the repo rate, banks are not legally required to reduce their own [[base rate]].\n\nThe present repo rate is 4.40%.<ref>{{cite web |title=RBI Repo Rate - RBI repo rate news, RBI rate cut announcement, repo rate slashed news |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/rbi-repo-rate |website=The Economic Times |accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Reverse repo rate (RRR)===\n{{see|Repurchase agreement#Reverse repo}}\nAs the name suggest, [[reverse repo]] rate is just the opposite of repo rate. Reverse repo rate is the short term borrowing rate at which RBI borrows money from banks. The reserve bank uses this tool when it feels there is too much money floating in the banking system. An increase in the reverse repo rate means that the banks will get a higher rate of interest from RBI. As a result, banks prefer to lend their money to RBI which is always safe instead of lending it to others (people, companies, etc.) which is always risky.\n\nRepo rate signifies the rate at which liquidity is injected into the banking system by RBI, whereas reverse repo rate signifies the rate at which the central bank absorbs liquidity from the banks. Currently, reverse repo rate is pegged to be 0.25% (or 25 bit/s) below the repo rate.\n\n===Statutory liquidity ratio (SLR)===\n{{see|Reserve requirement}}\nApart from the {{abbr|CRR|cash reserve ratio}}, banks are required to maintain liquid assets in the form of gold, cash and approved securities. Higher liquidity ratio forces commercial banks to maintain a larger proportion of their resources in liquid form and thus reduces their capacity to grant loans and advances, thus it is an anti-inflationary impact. A higher liquidity ratio diverts the bank funds from loans and advances to investment in government and approved securities.\n\nIn well-developed economies, central banks use [[open market operation]]s\u2014buying and selling of eligible securities by the central bank in the money market\u2014to influence the volume of cash reserves with commercial banks and thus influence the volume of loans and advances they can make to the commercial and industrial sectors. In the open money market, government securities are traded at market-related rates of interest. The RBI is resorting increasing to open market operations in recent years. Generally, the RBI uses\n#Minimum margins for lending against specific securities.\n#A ceiling on the amounts of credit for certain purposes.\n#The discriminatory rate of interest charged on certain types of advances.\n\nDirect credit controls in India are of three types:\n#Part of the interest rate structure, i.e., on small savings and provident funds, are administratively set.\n#Banks are mandatory required to keep 19.50% of their NDTL (net demand and time liabilities) in the form of liquid assets.\n#Banks are required to lend to the priority sectors to the extent of 40% of their advances.\n\nThe share of net demand and time liabilities that banks must maintain in safe and liquid assets, such as government securities, cash, and gold. Here it would be pertinent to mention the gold swap of July 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/RBI-initiates-swap-of-old-gold-with-new-one/articleshow/37907102.cms | title=RBI initiates swap of old gold with new one \u2013 Times of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.businesstoday.in/current/policy/reserve-bank-of-india-initiates-swap-of-old-gold-with-new/story/207890.html | title=Reserve Bank of India initiates swap of old gold with new one}}</ref><ref>name=\"nagpurtoday1\"</ref> The present SLR is 18.75%.\n\n===Bank rate===\n{{see|Bank rate}}\nBank rate is defined in Section 49 of the RBI Act of 1934 as the \u2018standard rate at which RBI is prepared to buy or rediscount bills of exchange or other commercial papers eligible for purchase'. When banks want to borrow long term funds from the RBI, it is the interest rate which the RBI charges to them. It is currently set to 5.40%.<ref name=\"moneycontrol.com\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rbi-cuts-repo-rate-by-25-bps/article29593190.ece/amp/|title= rbi-cuts-repo-rate-by-25-bps|newspaper=thehindu|access-date=4 October 2019}}</ref> The bank rate is not used to control money supply, but penal rates continue to be linked to the bank rate. If a bank fails to meet {{abbr|SLR|statutory liquidity ratio}} or {{abbr|CRR|cash reserve ratio}} requirements then the RBI will impose a penalty of 300 [[basis point]]s above bank rate.\n\n===Liquidity adjustment facility (LAF)===\n{{see|Liquidity adjustment facility}}\n[[Liquidity adjustment facility]] was introduced in 2000. LAF is a facility provided by the Reserve Bank of India to scheduled commercial banks to avail of liquidity in case of need or to park excess funds with the RBI on an overnight basis against the collateral of government securities.\n\nRBI accepts applications for a minimum amount of {{INRConvert|5|c|lk=c}} and in multiples of {{INR}}5&nbsp;crore thereafter.\n\n===Cash reserve ratio (CRR)===\nCRR refers to the ratio of bank's cash reserve balances with RBI with reference to the bank's net demand and time liabilities to ensure the liquidity and solvency of the scheduled banks. The share of net demand and time liabilities that banks must maintain as cash with the RBI. The RBI has set CRR at 4%. A 1% change in CRR affects the economy by {{INRConvert|1000000|c|lk=c}}. An increase draw this amount from the economy, while a decrease injects this amount into the economy. So if a bank has {{INRConvert|200|c}} of {{abbr|NDTL|net demand and time liabilities}} then it has to keep {{INRConvert|8|c}} in cash with RBI. RBI pays no interest on CRR.\n\nLet's assume the economy is showing inflationary trends and the RBI wants to control this situation by adjusting {{abbr|SLR|statutory liquidity ratio}} and CRR. If the RBI increases SLR to 50% and CRR to 20% then bank will be left only with {{INRConvert|60|c}} for operations. Now it will be very difficult for the bank to maintain profitability with such a small amount of capital. The bank will be left with no choice but to raise its interest rate which will make borrowing by its customers more costly. This will in turn reduce the overall demand and hence prices will eventually come down.\n\n===Open market operation (OMO)===\n{{see|Open market operation}}\nOpen market operation is the activity of buying and selling of government securities in open market to control the supply of money in banking system. When there is excess supply of money, central bank sells government securities thereby sucking out excess liquidity. Similarly, when liquidity is tight, RBI will buy government securities and thereby inject money supply into the economy.\n\nOn 23 March 2020, Reserve Bank of India infuse Rs 1 lakh crore through term repo auction, a massive [[Open market operation|OMOs (open market operations)]] purchase of government securities. The Reserve Bank is monitoring the financial market conditions and liquidity situation in the economy as [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India]] fears of a recession.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/coronovirus-scare-rbi-announces-omos-purchase-of-rs-1-lakh-crore-to-boost-liquidity/story/398973.html|title=Coronavirus scare: RBI announces OMOs purchase of Rs 1 lakh crore to boost liquidity|date=23 March 2020|website=Business Today|access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Marginal standing facility (MSF)===\nThis scheme was introduced in May 2011 and all the scheduled commercial bank can participate in this scheme. Banks can borrow up to 2.5%<ref>[https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8248&Mode=0 Reserve Bank of India \u2013 Notifications]. Rbi.org.in. Retrieved on 26 December 2018.</ref> percent of their respective net demand and time liabilities. The RBI receives application under this facility for a minimum amount of Rs.&nbsp;1 crore and in multiples of Rs.&nbsp;1 crore thereafter.\n\nThe important difference from repo rate is that bank can pledge government securities from its SLR quota (up to one percent). So even if SLR goes below 20.5%<ref>RBI/2014-15/445 DBR.Ret.BC.70/12.02.001/2014-15, dt. 16 October 2016</ref> by pledging SLR quota securities under MSF, the bank will not have to pay any penalty. The MSF rate is set to 100 [[basis point]]s above bank rate and currently is at 5.65% as of 7 August 2019.<ref name=\"moneycontrol.com\"/>\n\n==Qualitative tools==\n===Margin requirements===\n{{see|Loan-to-value ratio}}\nLoan-to-value (LTV) is the ratio of loan amount to the actual value of asset purchased.\n\nThe RBI regulates this ratio so as to control the amount a bank can lend to its customers. For example, an individual wants to buy a car using borrowed money and the car's value is {{INRConvert|10|l|lk=l}}. If the LTV is set to 70% he can borrow a maximum of {{INRConvert|7|l}}.\n\nThe RBI can decrease or increase to curb inflation or deflation respectively.\n\n===Selective credit control===\nUnder this measure, the RBI can specifically instruct banks not to give loans to traders of certain commodities e.g. sugar, edible oil, etc.\n\nThis prevents the speculation/hoarding of commodities using money borrowed from banks.\n\n===Moral suasion===\n{{see|Moral suasion}}\nUnder this measure, the RBI try to persuade banks through meetings, conferences, media statements to do specific things under certain economic trends. For example, when the RBI reduces repo rate, it asks banks to reduce their base rate as well. Another example of this measure is to ask banks to reduce their [[non-performing loan|non-performing asset]]s.\n\n==Limitations of monetary policy==\nIn developing countries like India, monetary policy fails to show immediate or no results because the following factors:\n\n# People do not employ alternative investment options. A large section of society still depends on saving accounts, fixed deposits, Public Provident Fund for investment. Commercial banks have large deposits. RBI is not the main or even prominent money supplier for these banks. So whatever monetary action central bank takes has little or late impact on the economy.\n# Many people in rural areas are out of the banking net and whatever the RBI does, has no impact on their financial activities.\n# Monsoon uncertainty adversely affects food production and thereby cause food inflation. Monetary policy has no impact on food inflation.\n\n==RTGS and NEFT transactions' charges removal==\n\nRBI decided to remove charges on RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement System) and NEFT ([[National Electronic Funds Transfer]]).<ref>{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/69673075.cms |newspaper=Times of India | title=RBI removes charges on NEFT, RTGS transactions | date=6 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Regulation of variable pay of bank management ==\nIn November, RBI introduced a set of draft guidelines to regulate the variable pay of CEOs and top management at private banks. The new rules are in line with the Sound Compensation Practices issued by the Financial Stability Board in April 2009. The rules will apply to CEOs, wholetime directors, and material risk takers at private banks, small finance banks and domestic executives of foreign banks. As per the new rules at least 50% of the pay should be based on individual, unit, business and firm wide performance evaluation which will be capped at 300% of the fixed pay. In case of variable pay above 200% then at least 50% of this amount should be via non cash instruments. Share linked instruments are included as part of variable pay. Guaranteed bonus should not be part of the compensation package except in case of joining bonus. The RBI also has put clauses in place to clawback/malus in case of deteriorating performance. The bank shall identify a representative set of conditions when the recovery clause for clawback /malus can be invoked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/rbi-clamps-down-on-variable-pay-of-top-management-at-private-banks|title=RBI Clamps Down On Variable Pay Of Top Management At Private Banks|website=BloombergQuint|language=en|access-date=5 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\nA report titled \"Trend and Progress of Banking In India\" is published annually, as required by the ''[[Banking Regulation Act, 1949]]''.
