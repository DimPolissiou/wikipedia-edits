It's time to reimagine what we can collectively do for our global environment with activities and events.\n\nThe five components:\n* Citizen Science: Earth Day is leveraging Citizen Science and emerging technologies to engage one million global citizens in the 50th anniversary \u201cEarth Challenge 2020,\u201d collecting one billion data points to measure air quality, water quality, pollution and human health. This initiative is being developed in association with dozens of major partners in the science and health communities as well as leading technology companies.\n* Advocacy: The time is now to mobilize and take action to save our planet. Earth Day will amplify direct links between technological innovation and inclusive climate prosperity, two signature themes we will be emphasizing around the world as we build towards the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020. Earth Day is creating millions of avenues for civic engagement in all 190 countries around the world and working with global decision-makers, including policy makers, local, regional and national governments and corporate sector leaders, to reach a diverse network of citizens around the world.\n* Volunteering: Earth Day is engaging volunteers across the globe for a month-long worldwide volunteer-driven program, \u201cThe Great Global Cleanup\u201d and starting with cleanups for Earth Day 2019. We expect 100&nbsp;million people participating in public events, as well as one billion others \u2014 including K-12 students around the world \u2014 to remove billions of pieces of trash from our neighborhoods, beaches, and parks. EDN is also working with partners to plant 7.8&nbsp;billion trees, one for every human who will live on the planet in 2020.

An [[equinox]] in astronomy is that point in time (not a whole day) when the Sun is directly above the Earth's equator, occurring around March 20 and September 23 each year. In most cultures, the [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s are considered to start or separate the [[season]]s, although weather patterns evolve earlier.\n\n[[John McConnell (peace activist)|John McConnell]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.earthsite.org |title=EarthSite |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422193041/http://www.earthsite.org/ |archive-date=April 22, 2006 |access-date=April 22, 2010}}</ref> first introduced the idea of a global holiday called \"Earth Day\" at the 1969 [[UNESCO]] Conference on the Environment. The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\n<blockquote>May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |access-date=April 15, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\n<blockquote>Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.<br />\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way \u2013 which is also the most ancient way \u2013 by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate.<ref>Margaret Mead, \"Earth Day,\" EPA Journal, March 1978.</ref></blockquote>\nAt the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the [[Japanese Peace Bell]], which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=UN.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928182232/http://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/untour/subjap.htm |archive-date=September 28, 2013 |access-date=April 22, 2013}}</ref> Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration.

The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\n<blockquote>May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |access-date=April 15, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\n<blockquote>Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.<br />\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way \u2013 which is also the most ancient way \u2013 by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate.<ref>Margaret Mead, \"Earth Day,\" EPA Journal, March 1978.</ref></blockquote>\nAt the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the [[Japanese Peace Bell]], which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=UN.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928182232/http://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/untour/subjap.htm |archive-date=September 28, 2013 |access-date=April 22, 2013}}</ref> Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration.

It consists of the provincial arms, charged with an open book inscribed with the abbreviated words VER/BVM/DNI LV/CER/NA, short for ''Verbum Domini Lucerna Pedibus Nostris''. The shield is surmounted by a golden crown of five leaves and four pearls.\n\nThe first 75 years of its existence were very fruitful for the University with about 100 students enrolling every year. Almost half of the students and lecturers came from outside the Netherlands \u2013 the first ''rector magnificus'', [[Ubbo Emmius]], came from [[East Frisia]] in modern-day Germany, for instance \u2013 but at the same time there was already a close relationship between the University and the city and the surrounding region.\n\nThe development of the University came to a standstill at the end of the seventeenth and during the eighteenth century because of theological differences of opinion, a difficult relationship with the Regional Assembly and political problems that included the siege of the city by [[Bernhard von Galen|\u2018''Bommen Berend''\u2019]] in 1672. On average two to three hundred students were registered with the University at any one time during this period. [[Petrus Camper]], though, was a shining academic example during the second half of the eighteenth century and was famous far beyond the city limits as an anatomist, a fighter against rinderpest and the founder of the first outpatient\u2019s clinic for surgical medicine.\n\n[[File:Academiegebouw Groningen 1858.jpg|thumb|left|The 19th-century main building in 1858]]\n\nOpportunities and threats followed each other during the nineteenth century. During the French occupation between 1775 and 1814 the University of Groningen was administrated by the [[University of Paris|Imperial University of Paris]]. Unlike Leiden University, it was not shut down and the institute was renamed Imperial University of Groningen (''Keizerlijke Universiteit Groningen''). During this time period, it remained the only open University in the [[Kingdom of Holland]].<ref>[http://www.rug400.nl/rug400_2/rug_definitief.dev/nl/tijdlijn_art/de-keizerlijke-universiteit.html De Keizerlijke Universiteit | Rug 400<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars, at the same time as Leiden and Utrecht, the University gained recognition as a national college of higher education, but this was followed by discussions about closure. The situation improved markedly when a new main university building, the Academiegebouw, was constructed in 1850, a building that was largely financed by the people of Groningen. This made the fire that completely destroyed this building in 1906 even more poignant.\n\nIn the meantime, the Higher Education Act of 1876 had radically improved the position of the University, which was renamed the \"''Rijksuniversiteit Groningen''\" (RUG). Teaching took place in Dutch and Latin and the University was given a research as well as an educational duty.\n\n[[File:090529 Academiegebouw Groningen NL.jpg|thumb|The 20th-century main building in 2009]]\n\nThe University of Groningen developed apace during the first decades of the twentieth century. The number of faculties and courses grew steadily while the number of students showed an explosive growth. When the University celebrated its first 300 years in 1914 there were 611 registered students; this had already grown to 1000 by 1924. After a drop back during the Depression, and in particular during the Second World War, the number of students grew rapidly from 1945 to reach 20,000 in 1994. At the present time there are about 30,000 students registered at the University of Groningen with the number of foreign students again growing steadily, and following the tradition set by the first Rector Magnificus, the number of German students and researchers has grown strongly in recent years.\n\nIn March 2015, the RUG signed an agreement with the [[China Agricultural University]] to establish a campus in the Chinese city of [[Yantai]].

Each faculty (''cf.'', College in the USA or School in Europe) is a formal grouping of academic degree programmes, schools and institutes, discipline areas, research centres, and/or any combination of these drawn together for educational purposes. Each faculty offers Bachelor's, Master's, PhD, and Exchange programmes, while some also offer short certificate courses.\n\nSince 2014, the RUG also has a partly independent [[liberal arts college]], [[University College Groningen]] (UCG).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/op-university-college-geen-zesjesstudenten~b719f2e0/ |title=''Op University College geen zesjesstudenten'' |newspaper=[[De Volkskrant]] |accessdate=29 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rug.nl/ucg/education/ |title=BA/BSc Liberal Arts & Sciences |work=www.rug.nl |accessdate=29 November 2018}}</ref>\n* Faculty of Economics and Business\n* Faculty of Arts\n* Faculty of Law\n* Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies\n* Faculty of Philosophy\n* Faculty of Behavioural and Social Sciences\n* Faculty of Medical Sciences\n* Faculty of Science and Engineering\n* Faculty of [[spatial science|Spatial Sciences]]\n* [[University College Groningen]]\n* Campus Frysl\u00e2n\n\n== Campus ==\nThe various faculties are housed around the city. Most of the faculties- including the faculties of Law, Arts and Philosophy are located in and around the city center. The university's original building, which acts as the main administrative building, lies exactly in the center of the city at the ''Broerstraat''. The faculty of medical sciences is located close-by at the [[University Medical Center Groningen]](UMCG). The Faculties of Economics and Business, Spatial Sciences, and Science and Engineering are housed in the northern outskirts of the city, at the Zernike Campus, named after [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Frits Zernike]]. The Zernike campus is also shared by the [[Hanze University of Applied Sciences]], the other big university in the city, making the total number of students studying there around 40,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://campus.groningen.nl/en/campus-groningen/zernike-campus|title=Zernike Campus|website=Groningen - City of Talent|language=en|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref>\n\nThe university has libraries in three locations: the main one at the city center, one in the Duisenberg building in Zernike Campus, and one in the faculty of medicine, that includes a vast array of books and online material for students. The library at the city center also has a [[Starbucks]] on its premises. The university has also recently opened another campus in [[Leeuwarden|Leeuwarden, Friesland]], referred to as \"Campus Fryslan\", that offers multiple disciplines in both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rug.nl/about-us/organization/faculties/ |title=Faculties {{!}} Our organization {{!}} About us {{!}} University of Groningen |website=www.rug.nl |language=en |access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>\n\n== Student life ==\nThe city of Groningen boasts a remarkable student life, and is known as the student city of the Netherlands; around one-third of the city's residents are students at either The University of Groningen or at the [[Hanze University of Applied Sciences]]. The city is tailored around students, and is known to be very welcoming.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The university, through ACLO,<ref>[http://www.aclosport.nl/en/about-aclo/ aclosport.nl]</ref> offers a wide range of sporting activities, and courses.

The city is popularly referred to as \"The World Cycling City\" because of this.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jul/29/how-groningen-invented-a-cycling-template-for-cities-all-over-the-world |title=''How Groningen invented a cycling template for cities all over the world'' |last=Zee |first=Renate van der |date=2015-07-29 |website=the Guardian |language=en |access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Student housing ===\nThe University of Groningen, much like most universities in Europe, does not have student accommodation themselves. It does, however, offer students with accommodation via [[SSH Student Housing]], which operates student houses in various locations in Groningen, and various other cities within the Netherlands. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sshxl.nl/en|title=SSH student housing {{!}} Rooms and apartments for students |website=www.sshxl.nl |language=en |access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref> A significant number of students live in private accommodations within the city, however. A recent addition to the housing options for students is [[The Student Hotel]] as well. The Dutch government has strict laws for private accommodations for both tenants (students) and the landlords, so that fair rent prices, and renting conditions can be maintained.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.athomeingroningen.com/law-contracts/housing-rights-tenants-duties/ |title=Housing rights & Tenant's duties - Housing in Groningen |work=Housing in Groningen |access-date=2018-06-11 |language=nl-NL}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the university received national attention due to the housing crisis in the city of Groningen. Due to the fact that most incoming students at the university are primarily from other parts of the country, or the world, there has been a lack of housing options for students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dutchreview.com/featured/the-student-housing-nightmare-a-tale-of-discrimination-fraud-and-protest/|title=The Student Housing Nightmare|last=|first=|date=11 June 2018|website=The Dutch Review|access-date=11 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n===Research schools, centres and institutes===\n'''Humanities and Social Sciences''' \n* Center for Language and Cognition Groningen (CLCG)\n* Globalisation Studies Groningen (GSG)\n* Centre for Religious Studies (CRS)\n* Groningen Institute of Archeology (GIA)\n* Groningen Institute for Educational research (GION)\n* Groningen Research Institute of Philosophy (GRIPH)\n* Groningen Research Institute for the Study of Culture (ICOG)\n* Heymans Institute\n* Interuniversity Center for Social Science Theory and Methodology (ICS)\n* Urban and Regional Studies Institute (URSI)\n\n'''Law'''\n* Centre for Law, Administration and Society (CRBS)\n* Groningen Centre of Energy Law (GCEL)\n\n'''Economics & Business'''\n* Economics, Econometrics and Finance (EEF)\n* Global Economics and Management (GEM)\n* Human Resource Management & Organisational Behaviour (HRM-OB)\n* Innovation & Organization (IO)\n* Marketing\n* Operations Management & Operations Research (OPERA)\n\n'''Life Sciences'''\n* Research School of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCN) / UMCG<ref>[http://www.rug.nl/bcn Research School of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCN)], University of Groningen.</ref>\n* Research Institute BCN-BRAIN / UMCG<ref>[http://www.rug.nl/research/bcn-brain/ Research Institute BCN-BRAIN], University of Groningen.</ref>\n* Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG) / UMCG<ref>[http://www.umcg.nl/EN/Research/InstitutesProgrammes/CRCG/paginas/default.aspx Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG)], University of Groningen.</ref>\n* Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences (GELIFES)<ref>[http://www.rug.nl/research/institute-evolutionary-life-sciences/ Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences (GELIFES)], University of Groningen.</ref>\n** Behavioural & Physiological Ecology <ref>[https://www.rug.nl/research/gelifes/organisation-links/bpe Behavioural & Physiological Ecology | BPE | GELIFES | Onderzoek | Rijksuniversiteit Groningen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n** Conservation Ecology Group <ref>[https://www.rug.nl/research/institute-evolutionary-life-sciences/conseco/ Conservation Ecology Group | GELIFES | Onderzoek | Rijksuniversiteit Groningen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n** Theoretical Research in Evolutionary Life Sciences <ref>[https://www.rug.nl/research/gelifes/tres/ Theoretical Research in Evolutionary Life Sciences | TR\u00caS | GELIFES | Onderzoek | Rijksuniversiteit Groningen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n** Evolutionary Genetics, Development & Behaviour <ref>[https://www.rug.nl/research/institute-evolutionary-life-sciences/egdb/ Evolutionary Genetics, Development & Behaviour | EGDB | GELIFES | Onderzoek | Rijksuniversiteit Groningen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n** Genomics Research in Ecology & Evolution in Nature <ref>[https://www.rug.nl/research/institute-evolutionary-life-sciences/green/ Genomics Research in Ecology & Evolution in Nature | GREEN | GELIFES | Onderzoek | Rijksuniversiteit Groningen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n** Neurobiology <ref>[https://www.rug.nl/research/institute-evolutionary-life-sciences/neurobiology/ Neurobiology | GELIFES | Onderzoek | Rijksuniversiteit Groningen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n* Groningen University Institute for Drug Exploration (GUIDE) / UMCG<ref>[http://www.umcg.nl/EN/Research/InstitutesProgrammes/GUIDE/paginas/default.aspx Groningen University Institute for Drug Exploration (GUIDE)], University of Groningen.</ref>\n* Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology (GBB)\n* Groningen Research Institute of Pharmacy (GRIP)\n* Science in Healthy Ageing and healthcaRE (SHARE), UMCG<ref>[http://www.umcg.nl/EN/Research/InstitutesProgrammes/SHARE/paginas/default.aspx Research Institute SHARE], University of Groningen.</ref>\n* W.J.

There were four faculties \u2013 Theology, Law, Medicine, and Philosophy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/study-abroad/universities/groningen-university-of-2248629.html |title=Groningen, University of |date=22 March 2011 |publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rnw.org/archive/university-groningen-facts-figures|title=University of Groningen: Facts & Figures |publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/university-of-groningen-500967 |title=''Article in U.S. News & World Report; accessed on 11 July 2017'' |publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[coat of arms]] of the university was confirmed by [[The Estates]] of the [[Groningen (province)|City and County of Groningen]] in 1615. It consists of the provincial arms, charged with an open book inscribed with the abbreviated words VER/BVM/DNI LV/CER/NA, short for ''Verbum Domini Lucerna Pedibus Nostris''. The shield is surmounted by a golden crown of five leaves and four pearls.\n\nThe first 75 years of its existence were very fruitful for the University with about 100 students enrolling every year. Almost half of the students and lecturers came from outside the Netherlands \u2013 the first ''rector magnificus'', [[Ubbo Emmius]], came from [[East Frisia]] in modern-day Germany, for instance \u2013 but at the same time there was already a close relationship between the University and the city and the surrounding region.\n\nThe development of the University came to a standstill at the end of the seventeenth and during the eighteenth century because of theological differences of opinion, a difficult relationship with the Regional Assembly and political problems that included the siege of the city by [[Bernhard von Galen|\u2018''Bommen Berend''\u2019]] in 1672. On average two to three hundred students were registered with the University at any one time during this period. [[Petrus Camper]], though, was a shining academic example during the second half of the eighteenth century and was famous far beyond the city limits as an anatomist, a fighter against rinderpest and the founder of the first outpatient\u2019s clinic for surgical medicine.\n\n[[File:Academiegebouw Groningen 1858.jpg|thumb|left|The 19th-century main building in 1858]]\n\nOpportunities and threats followed each other during the nineteenth century. During the French occupation between 1775 and 1814 the University of Groningen was administrated by the [[University of Paris|Imperial University of Paris]]. Unlike Leiden University, it was not shut down and the institute was renamed Imperial University of Groningen (''Keizerlijke Universiteit Groningen''). During this time period, it remained the only open University in the [[Kingdom of Holland]].<ref>[http://www.rug400.nl/rug400_2/rug_definitief.dev/nl/tijdlijn_art/de-keizerlijke-universiteit.html De Keizerlijke Universiteit | Rug 400<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars, at the same time as Leiden and Utrecht, the University gained recognition as a national college of higher education, but this was followed by discussions about closure. The situation improved markedly when a new main university building, the Academiegebouw, was constructed in 1850, a building that was largely financed by the people of Groningen. This made the fire that completely destroyed this building in 1906 even more poignant.\n\nIn the meantime, the Higher Education Act of 1876 had radically improved the position of the University, which was renamed the \"''Rijksuniversiteit Groningen''\" (RUG). Teaching took place in Dutch and Latin and the University was given a research as well as an educational duty.\n\n[[File:090529 Academiegebouw Groningen NL.jpg|thumb|The 20th-century main building in 2009]]\n\nThe University of Groningen developed apace during the first decades of the twentieth century. The number of faculties and courses grew steadily while the number of students showed an explosive growth. When the University celebrated its first 300 years in 1914 there were 611 registered students; this had already grown to 1000 by 1924. After a drop back during the Depression, and in particular during the Second World War, the number of students grew rapidly from 1945 to reach 20,000 in 1994. At the present time there are about 30,000 students registered at the University of Groningen with the number of foreign students again growing steadily, and following the tradition set by the first Rector Magnificus, the number of German students and researchers has grown strongly in recent years.\n\nIn March 2015, the RUG signed an agreement with the [[China Agricultural University]] to establish a campus in the Chinese city of [[Yantai]]. This would have made the RUG the first Dutch university to open a campus in China.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ukrant.nl/rug-yantai-van-de-baan/|title=RUG: Yantai van de baan |work=UKrant.nl|date=31 January 2018|publisher= Thereza Langeler, Rob Siebelink |accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref> The plan was heavily criticised, mainly due to worries about the restriction of academic freedom caused by [[censorship in China]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/video/2189932-de-china-plannen-van-rijksuniversiteit-groningen.html |title=De China-plannen van Rijksuniversiteit Groningen |publisher=NOS |accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref> In January 2018, the plans were cancelled by the Executive Board of the UG, based on the \"insufficient support for the project\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2214377-rijksuniversiteit-groningen-blaast-plan-chinees-filiaal-af.html |title=''Rijksuniversiteit Groningen blaast plan Chinees filiaal af'' |publisher=NOS|accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 the Dutch chemist [[Ben Feringa]], who has spent most of his career at the University of Groningen, won the [[Nobel prize]] for his work on molecular motors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2016/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2016 |website=www.nobelprize.org}}</ref>\n\n== Facts and figures ==\n{{Infobox world university ranking\n| ARWU_W = 65<small> (2019)</small> | ARWU_W_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2019.html|title=Academic Ranking of World Universities 2019|website=ShanghaiRanking|accessdate=2019-08-17}}</ref>\n| THE_W = 73<small> (2020)</small> | THE_W_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-groningen|title=World University Rankings 2020 - University of Groningen|date=18 September 2019|website=Times Higher Education (THE)}}</ref>\n| QS_W = 114<small> (2020)</small> | QS_W_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2020|title=QS World University Rankings 2020|date=15 July 2019|website=Top Universities}}</ref>\n| USNWR_W = 96<small> (2020)</small>| USNWR_W_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/rankings?page=11|title=U.S. News Education: Best Global Universities 2019|publisher=}}</ref>\n| Leiden_W = 96<small> (2019)</small> | Leiden_W_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.leidenranking.com/ranking/2019/list|title=CWTS Leiden Ranking 2019|website=|accessdate=2019-09-19|publisher=)}}</ref>\n}}\nKey facts and figures about the University of Groningen are:<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n* The university, as of September 2016, has 32,700 students enrolled in various programs from the undergraduate level up to doctorate students.

Each faculty (''cf.'', College in the USA or School in Europe) is a formal grouping of academic degree programmes, schools and institutes, discipline areas, research centres, and/or any combination of these drawn together for educational purposes. Each faculty offers Bachelor's, Master's, PhD, and Exchange programmes, while some also offer short certificate courses.\n\nSince 2014, the RUG also has a partly independent [[liberal arts college]], [[University College Groningen]] (UCG).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/op-university-college-geen-zesjesstudenten~b719f2e0/ |title=''Op University College geen zesjesstudenten'' |newspaper=[[De Volkskrant]] |accessdate=29 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rug.nl/ucg/education/ |title=BA/BSc Liberal Arts & Sciences |work=www.rug.nl |accessdate=29 November 2018}}</ref>\n* Faculty of Economics and Business\n* Faculty of Arts\n* Faculty of Law\n* Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies\n* Faculty of Philosophy\n* Faculty of Behavioural and Social Sciences\n* Faculty of Medical Sciences\n* Faculty of Science and Engineering\n* Faculty of [[spatial science|Spatial Sciences]]\n* [[University College Groningen]]\n* Campus Frysl\u00e2n\n\n== Campus ==\nThe various faculties are housed around the city. Most of the faculties- including the faculties of Law, Arts and  Philosophy are located in and around the city center. The university's original building, which acts as the main administrative building, lies exactly in the center of the city at the ''Broerstraat''. The faculty of medical sciences is located close-by at the [[University Medical Center Groningen]](UMCG). The Faculties of Economics and Business, Spatial Sciences, and Science and Engineering are housed in the northern outskirts of the city, at the Zernike Campus, named after [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Frits Zernike]]. The Zernike campus is also shared by the [[Hanze University of Applied Sciences]], the other big university in the city, making the total number of students studying there around 40,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://campus.groningen.nl/en/campus-groningen/zernike-campus|title=Zernike Campus|website=Groningen - City of Talent|language=en|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref>\n\nThe university has libraries in three locations: the main one at the city center, one in the Duisenberg building in Zernike Campus, and one in the faculty of medicine, that includes a vast array of books and online material for students. The library at the city center also has a [[Starbucks]] on its premises. The university has also recently opened another campus in [[Leeuwarden|Leeuwarden, Friesland]], referred to as \"Campus Fryslan\", that offers multiple disciplines in both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rug.nl/about-us/organization/faculties/ |title=Faculties {{!}} Our organization {{!}} About us {{!}} University of Groningen |website=www.rug.nl |language=en |access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>\n\n== Student life ==\nThe city of Groningen boasts a remarkable student life, and is known as the student city of the Netherlands; around one-third of the city's residents are students at either The University of Groningen or at the [[Hanze University of Applied Sciences]]. The city is tailored around students, and is known to be very welcoming. The university, through ACLO<ref>[http://www.aclosport.nl/en/about-aclo/ aclosport.nl]</ref> offers a wide range of sporting activities, and courses. Almost each sport has its own association, and offers the use of its facilities at discount rates for students.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rug.nl/education/find-out-more/extracurricular-activities-associations/sports-associations |title=Sports associations {{!}} Extracurricular activities and associations {{!}} Student life {{!}} Find out more {{!}} Education {{!}} University of Groningen |website=www.rug.nl |language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>\n\nThe university, also has multiple student societies that organize social events for its members, as well as student and study associations, that are mostly concerned with specific faculties and courses.\n\nThe use of [[bicycle]]s as the means for transport is particularly prevalent for locals and students alike, and has integrated, labelled bike paths from the city center to Zernike. The city is popularly referred to as \"The World Cycling City\" because of this.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jul/29/how-groningen-invented-a-cycling-template-for-cities-all-over-the-world |title=''How Groningen invented a cycling template for cities all over the world'' |last=Zee |first=Renate van der |date=2015-07-29 |website=the Guardian |language=en |access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Student housing ===\nThe University of Groningen, much like most universities in Europe, does not have student accommodation themselves. It does, however, offer students with accommodation via [[SSH Student Housing]]- which operates student houses in various locations in Groningen, and various other cities within the Netherlands. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sshxl.nl/en|title=SSH student housing {{!}} Rooms and apartments for students |website=www.sshxl.nl |language=en |access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref> A significant number of students live in private accommodations within the city, however. A recent addition to the housing options for students is [[The Student Hotel]] as well. The Dutch government has strict laws for private accommodations for both tenants (students) and the landlords, so that fair rent prices, and renting conditions can be maintained.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.athomeingroningen.com/law-contracts/housing-rights-tenants-duties/ |title=Housing rights & Tenant's duties - Housing in Groningen |work=Housing in Groningen |access-date=2018-06-11 |language=nl-NL}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the university received national attention due to the housing crisis in the city of Groningen. Due to the fact that most incoming students at the university are primarily from other parts of the country, or the world, there has been a lack of housing options for students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dutchreview.com/featured/the-student-housing-nightmare-a-tale-of-discrimination-fraud-and-protest/|title=The Student Housing Nightmare|last=|first=|date=11 June 2018|website=The Dutch Review|access-date=11 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n===Research schools, centres and institutes===\n'''Humanities and Social Sciences''' \n* Center for Language and Cognition Groningen (CLCG)\n* Globalisation Studies Groningen (GSG)\n* Centre for Religious Studies (CRS)\n* Groningen Institute of Archeology (GIA)\n* Groningen Institute for Educational research (GION)\n* Groningen Research Institute of Philosophy (GRIPH)\n* Groningen Research Institute for the Study of Culture (ICOG)\n* Heymans Institute\n* Interuniversity Center for Social Science Theory and Methodology (ICS)\n* Urban and Regional Studies Institute (URSI)\n\n'''Law'''\n* Centre for Law, Administration and Society (CRBS)\n* Groningen Centre of Energy Law (GCEL)\n\n'''Economics & Business'''\n* Economics, Econometrics and Finance (EEF)\n* Global Economics and Management (GEM)\n* Human Resource Management & Organisational Behaviour (HRM-OB)\n* Innovation & Organization (IO)\n* Marketing\n* Operations Management & Operations Research (OPERA)\n\n'''Life Sciences'''\n* Research School of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCN) / UMCG<ref>[http://www.rug.nl/bcn Research School of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCN)], University of Groningen.</ref>\n* Research Institute BCN-BRAIN / UMCG<ref>[http://www.rug.nl/research/bcn-brain/ Research Institute BCN-BRAIN], University of Groningen.</ref>\n* Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG) / UMCG<ref>[http://www.umcg.nl/EN/Research/InstitutesProgrammes/CRCG/paginas/default.aspx Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG)], University of Groningen.</ref>\n* Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences (GELIFES)<ref>[http://www.rug.nl/research/institute-evolutionary-life-sciences/ Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences (GELIFES)], University of Groningen.</ref>\n** Behavioural & Physiological Ecology <ref>[https://www.rug.nl/research/gelifes/organisation-links/bpe Behavioural & Physiological Ecology | BPE | GELIFES | Onderzoek | Rijksuniversiteit Groningen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n** Conservation Ecology Group <ref>[https://www.rug.nl/research/institute-evolutionary-life-sciences/conseco/ Conservation Ecology Group | GELIFES | Onderzoek | Rijksuniversiteit Groningen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n** Theoretical Research in Evolutionary Life Sciences <ref>[https://www.rug.nl/research/gelifes/tres/ Theoretical Research in Evolutionary Life Sciences | TR\u00caS | GELIFES | Onderzoek | Rijksuniversiteit Groningen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n** Evolutionary Genetics, Development & Behaviour <ref>[https://www.rug.nl/research/institute-evolutionary-life-sciences/egdb/ Evolutionary Genetics, Development & Behaviour | EGDB | GELIFES | Onderzoek | Rijksuniversiteit Groningen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n** Genomics Research in Ecology & Evolution in Nature <ref>[https://www.rug.nl/research/institute-evolutionary-life-sciences/green/ Genomics Research in Ecology & Evolution in Nature | GREEN | GELIFES | Onderzoek | Rijksuniversiteit Groningen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n** Neurobiology <ref>[https://www.rug.nl/research/institute-evolutionary-life-sciences/neurobiology/ Neurobiology | GELIFES | Onderzoek | Rijksuniversiteit Groningen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n* Groningen University Institute for Drug Exploration (GUIDE) / UMCG<ref>[http://www.umcg.nl/EN/Research/InstitutesProgrammes/GUIDE/paginas/default.aspx Groningen University Institute for Drug Exploration (GUIDE)], University of Groningen.</ref>\n* Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology (GBB)\n* Groningen Research Institute of Pharmacy (GRIP)\n* Science in Healthy Ageing and healthcaRE (SHARE), UMCG<ref>[http://www.umcg.nl/EN/Research/InstitutesProgrammes/SHARE/paginas/default.aspx Research Institute SHARE], University of Groningen.</ref>\n* W.J.

After witnessing some domestics and the truth about Paul and Gail's engagement, Mr Udagawa decides against making any further deals with Paul.

The island of Taiwan has an area of {{convert|35808|km2|sp=us}}, with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third, where its highly urbanised population is concentrated. [[Taipei]] is the capital and largest metropolitan area. Other major cities include [[Kaohsiung]], [[Taichung]], [[Tainan]] and [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan]]. With 23.7&nbsp;million inhabitants, Taiwan is among the most densely populated states, and is the most populous state and largest [[gross domestic product|economy]] that is not a member of the [[United Nations]] (UN).\n\n[[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]] settled the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]] around 6,000 years ago. In the 17th century, [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch rule]] opened the island to mass [[Han people|Han]] immigration. After the brief [[Kingdom of Tungning]] in parts of the southern and western areas of the island, the island [[Taiwan under Qing rule|was annexed in 1683]] by the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|ceded]] to the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1895. Following the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945, the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], which had [[Xinhai Revolution|overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911]], [[Retrocession Day|took control of Taiwan]] on behalf of the [[World War II Allies]]. The resumption of the [[Chinese Civil War]] led to the loss of the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|flight of the ROC government to Taiwan]] in 1949. Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the [[Two Chinas|legitimate representative of China]], since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to [[free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan and numerous smaller islands]]. In the early 1960s, Taiwan entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialisation called the \"[[Taiwan Miracle]]\". In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the ROC transitioned from a one-party military dictatorship to a multi-party democracy with a [[semi-presidential system]].\n\nTaiwan's export-oriented industrial economy is the [[list of countries by GDP (nominal)|21st-largest]] in the world, with major contributions from steel, machinery, electronics and chemicals manufacturing.

The main island, known historically as ''Formosa'', makes up 99% of the [[Free area of the Republic of China|area controlled by the ROC]], measuring {{convert|35808|km2|sqmi|0}} and lying some {{convert|180|km|mi|0}} across the [[Taiwan Strait]] from the southeastern coast of [[mainland China]]. The [[East China Sea]] lies to its north, the [[Philippine Sea]] to its east, the [[Luzon Strait]] directly to its south and the [[South China Sea]] to its southwest. [[List of islands of Taiwan|Smaller islands]] include a number in the Taiwan Strait including the [[Penghu]] archipelago, the [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands]] near the Chinese coast, and some of the [[South China Sea Islands]].\n\nThe main island is a tilted [[fault block]], characterized by the contrast between the eastern two-thirds, consisting mostly of five rugged mountain ranges parallel to the east coast, and the flat to gently rolling plains of the western third, where the majority of Taiwan's population reside. There are several peaks over 3,500&nbsp;m, the highest being [[Yu Shan]] at {{cvt|3952|m|ft}}, making Taiwan the world's [[List of islands by highest point|fourth-highest island]]. The tectonic boundary that formed these ranges is still active, and the island experiences many earthquakes, a few of them highly destructive. There are also many active [[submarine volcano]]es in the Taiwan Straits.\n\nThe eastern mountains are heavily forested and home to a diverse range of wildlife, while land use in the western and northern lowlands is intensive.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map TWN present.svg|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate classification of Taiwan.]]\n\nTaiwan lies on the [[Tropic of Cancer]], and its general [[climate]] is marine [[tropical climate|tropical]].<ref name=\"cia-factbook\">{{cite web |title=Taiwan |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tw.html |work=The World Factbook |publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency |access-date=6 May 2019}}</ref> The northern and central regions are subtropical, whereas the south is tropical and the mountainous regions are temperate.{{sfnp|Exec.

The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of [[terrane]]s, mostly old [[island arc]]s which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]]. These have been further uplifted as a result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was [[subduction|subducted]] beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust under Taiwan more buoyant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/~anderson/taiwan/tai_index.html |title=Geology of Taiwan |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe east and south of Taiwan are a complex system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between the North Luzon Trough portion of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc]] and South China, where accreted portions of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc|Luzon Arc]] and Luzon forearc form the [[Haian Range|eastern Coastal Range]] and parallel inland [[Huatung Valley|Longitudinal Valley]] of Taiwan respectively.<ref>Clift, Schouten and Draut (2003) in ''Intra-Oceanic Subduction Systems: Tectonic and Magmatic Processes'', {{ISBN|1-86239-147-5}} p84\u201386</ref>\n\nThe major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between the various [[terrane]]s.

On 21 September 1999, a 7.3 quake known as the \"[[1999 Jiji (Chichi) earthquake|921 earthquake]]\" killed more than 2,400 people.

Political reforms beginning in the late 1970s and continuing through the early 1990s transformed into a multiparty democracy. Since the lifting of martial law, the Republic of China has democratized and reformed, suspending constitutional components that were originally meant for the whole of China. This process of amendment continues. In 2000, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[President of the Republic of China|presidency]], ending KMT's continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of constitutional reform to the popular ballot.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}</ref>\n[[File:Presidential Building, Taiwan (0747).JPG|thumb|Taiwan's popularly elected president resides in the [[Presidential Office Building, Taipei]], originally built in the Japanese era for colonial governors.]]\nThe [[head of state]] and commander-in-chief of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|armed forces]] is the [[President of the Republic of China|president]], who is elected by popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the vice-president.

Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese who immigrated from mainland China in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences, as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratic reforms and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for ''de jure'' Taiwan independence.<ref name=\"power-shift\">{{Cite book|last=Shambaugh|first=David L.|title=Power shift|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|pages=179\u2013183 |isbn=978-0-520-24570-9}}</ref> The [[pan-green]] camp supports a distinct Taiwanese identity, while the [[pan-blue]] camp supports a Chinese identity only.<ref name=\"panblue-reunif-chineseid\" /> The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20081230ho.html|title=No sign of a 'peace agreement'|last=Okazaki|first=Hisahiko|date=30 December 2008|newspaper=Japan Times|accessdate=15 July 2009|quote=For one thing, I believe there is recognition that the awareness of Taiwanese identity is now irreversible.

Local governments are responsible or partially responsible for social services, education, urban planning, public construction, water management, environmental protection, transport and public safety.\n\nThere are three types of subnational divisions: special municipalities, cities and counties. Special municipalities and cities are further divided into districts for local administration. Counties are further divided into townships and county-administered cities which have government offices with elected leaders and local councils, which share responsibilities with the county. Some divisions are indigenous divisions which have different degrees of autonomy to standard ones. In addition, districts, cities and townships are further divided into villages and neighbourhoods.\n\n==Military==\n{{Main|Republic of China Armed Forces}}\n{{See also|Republic of China Military Academy}}\n\n[[File:Thunderbolt 2000 MLRS Side View 20111105a.jpg|thumb|[[Republic of China Army]] [[Thunderbolt-2000]]]]\nThe [[Republic of China Army]] takes its roots in the [[National Revolutionary Army]], which was established by [[Sun Yat-sen]] in 1925 in [[Guangdong]] with a goal of reunifying China under the Kuomintang. When the [[People's Liberation Army]] won the [[Chinese Civil War]], much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along with the government. It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army. Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army.\n\nToday, Taiwan maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as a defence to the constant threat of invasion by the [[People's Liberation Army]] using the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] as a pretext. This law authorizes the use of military force when certain conditions are met, such as a danger to mainlanders.<ref name=2004NatDefRpt />\n\nFrom 1949 to the 1970s, the primary mission of the Taiwanese military was to \"retake mainland China\" through [[Project National Glory]].

These efforts significantly slowed inflation.\n\nWhen the KMT government fled to Taiwan it brought millions of [[tael]]s (where 1&nbsp;tael = 37.5 g or ~1.2&nbsp;[[troy ounce|ozt]]) of gold and the foreign currency reserve of mainland China, which, according to the KMT, stabilized prices and reduced hyperinflation.<ref>{{cite web |date=6 April 2011 |title=Gold Shipped to Taiwan in 1949 Helped Stabilize ROC on Taiwan|url=http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&mnum=112&anum=9442|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927081949/http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&mnum=112&anum=9442|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 September 2011|newspaper=Kuomintang News Network|accessdate=14 June 2011}} Translated from {{cite news |author=\u738b\u9298\u7fa9 |date=5 April 2011 |script-title=zh:1949\u5e74\u904b\u53f0\u9ec3\u91d1 \u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u4fdd\u547d\u672c |newspaper=China Times |url=http://forums.chinatimes.com/report/goldfile/series-cnt0405ct02.htm |accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> Perhaps more importantly, as part of its retreat to Taiwan, the KMT brought the intellectual and business elites from mainland China.<ref>{{cite book | last =Roy | first =Denny | title =Taiwan: A Political History | url =https://archive.org/details/taiwan00denn | url-access =registration | publisher =Cornell University Press |year=2003 | location =Ithaca, NY | pages =[https://archive.org/details/taiwan00denn/page/76 76], 77 | isbn =978-0-8014-8805-4 }}</ref> The KMT government instituted many laws and [[land reform]]s that it had never effectively enacted on mainland China.

The island of Taiwan has an area of {{convert|35808|km2|sp=us}}, with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third, where its highly urbanised population is concentrated. [[Taipei]] is the capital and largest metropolitan area. Other major cities include [[Kaohsiung]], [[Taichung]], [[Tainan]] and [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan]]. With 23.7&nbsp;million inhabitants, Taiwan is among the most densely populated states, and is the most populous state and largest [[gross domestic product|economy]] that is not a member of the [[United Nations]] (UN).\n\n[[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]] settled the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]] around 6,000 years ago. In the 17th century, [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch rule]] opened the island to mass [[Han people|Han]] immigration. After the brief [[Kingdom of Tungning]] in parts of the southern and western areas of the island, the island [[Taiwan under Qing rule|was annexed in 1683]] by the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|ceded]] to the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1895. Following the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945, the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], which had [[Xinhai Revolution|overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911]], [[Retrocession Day|took control of Taiwan]] on behalf of the [[World War II Allies]]. The resumption of the [[Chinese Civil War]] led to the loss of the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|flight of the ROC government to Taiwan]] in 1949. Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the [[Two Chinas|legitimate representative of China]], since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to [[free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan and numerous smaller islands]]. In the early 1960s, Taiwan entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialisation called the \"[[Taiwan Miracle]]\". In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the ROC transitioned from a one-party military dictatorship to a multi-party democracy with a [[semi-presidential system]].\n\nTaiwan's export-oriented industrial economy is the [[list of countries by GDP (nominal)|21st-largest]] in the world, with major contributions from steel, machinery, electronics and chemicals manufacturing.

The main island, known historically as ''Formosa'', makes up 99% of the [[Free area of the Republic of China|area controlled by the ROC]], measuring {{convert|35808|km2|sqmi|0}} and lying some {{convert|180|km|mi|0}} across the [[Taiwan Strait]] from the southeastern coast of [[mainland China]]. The [[East China Sea]] lies to its north, the [[Philippine Sea]] to its east, the [[Luzon Strait]] directly to its south and the [[South China Sea]] to its southwest. [[List of islands of Taiwan|Smaller islands]] include a number in the Taiwan Strait including the [[Penghu]] archipelago, the [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands]] near the Chinese coast, and some of the [[South China Sea Islands]].\n\nThe main island is a tilted [[fault block]], characterized by the contrast between the eastern two-thirds, consisting mostly of five rugged mountain ranges parallel to the east coast, and the flat to gently rolling plains of the western third, where the majority of Taiwan's population reside. There are several peaks over 3,500&nbsp;m, the highest being [[Yu Shan]] at {{cvt|3952|m|ft}}, making Taiwan the world's [[List of islands by highest point|fourth-highest island]]. The tectonic boundary that formed these ranges is still active, and the island experiences many earthquakes, a few of them highly destructive. There are also many active [[submarine volcano]]es in the Taiwan Straits.\n\nThe eastern mountains are heavily forested and home to a diverse range of wildlife, while land use in the western and northern lowlands is intensive.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map TWN present.svg|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate classification of Taiwan.]]\n\nTaiwan lies on the [[Tropic of Cancer]], and its general [[climate]] is marine [[tropical climate|tropical]].<ref name=\"cia-factbook\">{{cite web |title=Taiwan |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tw.html |work=The World Factbook |publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency |access-date=6 May 2019}}</ref> The northern and central regions are subtropical, whereas the south is tropical and the mountainous regions are temperate.{{sfnp|Exec.

The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of [[terrane]]s, mostly old [[island arc]]s which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]]. These have been further uplifted as a result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was [[subduction|subducted]] beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust under Taiwan more buoyant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/~anderson/taiwan/tai_index.html |title=Geology of Taiwan |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe east and south of Taiwan are a complex system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between the North Luzon Trough portion of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc]] and South China, where accreted portions of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc|Luzon Arc]] and Luzon forearc form the [[Haian Range|eastern Coastal Range]] and parallel inland [[Huatung Valley|Longitudinal Valley]] of Taiwan respectively.<ref>Clift, Schouten and Draut (2003) in ''Intra-Oceanic Subduction Systems: Tectonic and Magmatic Processes'', {{ISBN|1-86239-147-5}} p84\u201386</ref>\n\nThe major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between the various [[terrane]]s.

On 21 September 1999, a 7.3 quake known as the \"[[1999 Jiji (Chichi) earthquake|921 earthquake]]\" killed more than 2,400 people.

Political reforms beginning in the late 1970s and continuing through the early 1990s transformed into a multiparty democracy. Since the lifting of martial law, the Republic of China has democratized and reformed, suspending constitutional components that were originally meant for the whole of China. This process of amendment continues. In 2000, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[President of the Republic of China|presidency]], ending KMT's continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of constitutional reform to the popular ballot.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}</ref>\n[[File:Presidential Building, Taiwan (0747).JPG|thumb|Taiwan's popularly elected president resides in the [[Presidential Office Building, Taipei]], originally built in the Japanese era for colonial governors.]]\nThe [[head of state]] and commander-in-chief of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|armed forces]] is the [[President of the Republic of China|president]], who is elected by popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the vice-president.

Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese who immigrated from mainland China in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences, as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratic reforms and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for ''de jure'' Taiwan independence.<ref name=\"power-shift\">{{Cite book|last=Shambaugh|first=David L.|title=Power shift|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|pages=179\u2013183 |isbn=978-0-520-24570-9}}</ref> The [[pan-green]] camp supports a distinct Taiwanese identity, while the [[pan-blue]] camp supports a Chinese identity only.<ref name=\"panblue-reunif-chineseid\" /> The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20081230ho.html|title=No sign of a 'peace agreement'|last=Okazaki|first=Hisahiko|date=30 December 2008|newspaper=Japan Times|accessdate=15 July 2009|quote=For one thing, I believe there is recognition that the awareness of Taiwanese identity is now irreversible.

Local governments are responsible or partially responsible for social services, education, urban planning, public construction, water management, environmental protection, transport and public safety.\n\nThere are three types of subnational divisions: special municipalities, cities and counties. Special municipalities and cities are further divided into districts for local administration. Counties are further divided into townships and county-administered cities which have government offices with elected leaders and local councils, which share responsibilities with the county. Some divisions are indigenous divisions which have different degrees of autonomy to standard ones. In addition, districts, cities and townships are further divided into villages and neighbourhoods.\n\n==Military==\n{{Main|Republic of China Armed Forces}}\n{{See also|Republic of China Military Academy}}\n\n[[File:Thunderbolt 2000 MLRS Side View 20111105a.jpg|thumb|[[Republic of China Army]] [[Thunderbolt-2000]]]]\nThe [[Republic of China Army]] takes its roots in the [[National Revolutionary Army]], which was established by [[Sun Yat-sen]] in 1925 in [[Guangdong]] with a goal of reunifying China under the Kuomintang. When the [[People's Liberation Army]] won the [[Chinese Civil War]], much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along with the government. It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army. Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army.\n\nToday, Taiwan maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as a defence to the constant threat of invasion by the [[People's Liberation Army]] using the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] as a pretext. This law authorizes the use of military force when certain conditions are met, such as a danger to mainlanders.<ref name=2004NatDefRpt />\n\nFrom 1949 to the 1970s, the primary mission of the Taiwanese military was to \"retake mainland China\" through [[Project National Glory]].

These efforts significantly slowed inflation.\n\nWhen the KMT government fled to Taiwan it brought millions of [[tael]]s (where 1&nbsp;tael = 37.5 g or ~1.2&nbsp;[[troy ounce|ozt]]) of gold and the foreign currency reserve of mainland China, which, according to the KMT, stabilized prices and reduced hyperinflation.<ref>{{cite web |date=6 April 2011 |title=Gold Shipped to Taiwan in 1949 Helped Stabilize ROC on Taiwan|url=http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&mnum=112&anum=9442|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927081949/http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&mnum=112&anum=9442|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 September 2011|newspaper=Kuomintang News Network|accessdate=14 June 2011}} Translated from {{cite news |author=\u738b\u9298\u7fa9 |date=5 April 2011 |script-title=zh:1949\u5e74\u904b\u53f0\u9ec3\u91d1 \u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u4fdd\u547d\u672c |newspaper=China Times |url=http://forums.chinatimes.com/report/goldfile/series-cnt0405ct02.htm |accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> Perhaps more importantly, as part of its retreat to Taiwan, the KMT brought the intellectual and business elites from mainland China.<ref>{{cite book | last =Roy | first =Denny | title =Taiwan: A Political History | url =https://archive.org/details/taiwan00denn | url-access =registration | publisher =Cornell University Press |year=2003 | location =Ithaca, NY | pages =[https://archive.org/details/taiwan00denn/page/76 76], 77 | isbn =978-0-8014-8805-4 }}</ref> The KMT government instituted many laws and [[land reform]]s that it had never effectively enacted on mainland China.

In Bangladesh rock music is often recognized as \"band music\". From the 1970s to 2000s, it was sometimes considered as the most popular genre in the country. \n\nFrom the mid 1960s to late 1990s, Bangladeshi rock was heavily influential in the development of various kinds of fusion in [[Southern Asia|southern asia]] like: [[Folk rock|folk rock]], [[Pop rock|pop rock]], [[Hard rock music|hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. In the 2000s, Bangladeshi rock music saw the development of heavy metal music as many subgenres emerged in the scene like: \n[[Thrash metal|thrash]], [[Death metal|death]], and [[Progressive metal|progressive]]. \n\nFrom the 2000s to 2010s, genres that emerged in the music scene, included [[Art rock|art]], [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]], [[Post-grunge|post-grunge]], [[Progressive rock|progressive]] and [[Alternative rock|alternative]] rock. Though considered the declining decade, the 2010s produced bands that pushed boundaries in the Bangladeshi rock music scene and earned huge popularity.  \n\n\n==Rock and roll (1960s to mid 1980s)==\n\n===Origins===\n\nThe foundations of Bangladeshi rock was in 1950s [[American rock|American rock and roll]] and Bengali classical music. Back in the 1960s, American rock and roll artist [[Elvis Presley]] had influenced many great rock bands like: [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]]. Drawing influences from the 1950s and 1960s rock and roll artists Bangladeshi bands were starting to form to introduce a new kind of music in the country. In the 1960s, the Gramophone Company of Pakistan had imported many [[Long playing|LP]] and [[Single (music)|singles]] of rock and roll artists like [[Cliff Richard and the Shadows]], Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, [[The Beach Boys|the Beach Boys]] and [[The Hollies|the Hollies]], which were sold very well in Bangladesh. These artists was favored mostly by the high school and college students in Bangladesh. Hence, the mid -60s rock music was influenced and developed a sound that was very similar to the [[Beat (music)|beat]], the [[British Invasion]] and late -60s [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic rock]].\n\nZinga formed by Shafaat Ali in Chittagong introduced [[guitar]], [[drums]] and [[piano]] to the classical music loving generation and most of the people were getting excited about it. They were also the first one to perform [[Rabindra Sangeet|Tagore songs]] with guitar and piano in the [[Bangladesh Television|East Pakistan TV]] (now BTV)<ref name=\"zg\">{{Cite web|url=http://zingagoshty.com/id38.htm|title=Zinga Biography|website=zingagoshty.com|access-date=2019-06-08}}</ref>. And around that time in 1964 in Dhaka, the Windy Side of Care was formed and they started performing songs of Elvis Presley and [[Cliff Richard]] in the clubs and hotels. \n\nThere's much debate to who is the first 'rock' band of the country. Zinga is the first contender, they were formed in 1963 in Chittagong, but there music was more like adhunik and didn't have the rock and roll sound. It has been argued that the Windy Side of Care was the first rock band of the country formed in 1964. They were also the first band to advertise themselves as psychedelic rock. Their self titled debut album also featured [[Raga rock|raga rock]] song \"Raag Bageshri\". At that time in Chittagong was formed the Lightnings, who were more improved and skilled then the other bands and had the rock and roll sound. In 1968, Zinga released their first song ''Tomari Jiboney'' which became very popular as it was aired on Shadhin Bangla Betar and East Pakistan TV a lot. Shafaat Ali is considered to be the first singer-songwriter of Bangladesh. From the late 1960s, inspired by the Beatles, Zinga became interested in the singer-songwriter concept. Though the song propelled the band, it failed to capture the rock and roll sound. Insex Dui was an American-Bangladeshi band who performed American and British psychedelic rock music in the 1960s. Formed by American students living in Dhaka, they had a complete different sound than the other rock bands of the decade. \n\nBefore becoming a successfull Dhallywood actor [[Zafar Iqbal (actor)|Zafar Iqbal]] was a singer in a band named, the Rambling Stones. It was formed in 1966. Other rock bands of the 1960s included Ugly Phases, Fire in Ice and Time Ago Motion. None of this bands released an album.\n\n===Post-Independence===\n\nMost of the bands from the 1960s, didn't become that successful and disbanded after the war in 1971. Some musicians went abroad or some of them formed new bands. Bands like Uccharon and Spondon were formed. And they were responsible for taking Bangladeshi rock to a new level, to a new crowd. Writing songs about poverty, the struggles of the people in a new born country, about romance and about the famine. Their songwriting and on stage performance was more improved than the bands of 60s. \n\nUccharon were the biggest band of that era in South Asia after [[Moheener Ghoraguli]]. Inspired by the 1960s rock music and some Indian classical musician, their frontman [[Azam Khan (singer)|Azam Khan]], a freedom fighter, introduced the [[Hippie|hippie fashion]]. He is sometimes considered to be the first musician with long hair in Bangladesh. With his long hair, bell-bottom jeans, powerful lyrics and open air concerts, Khan cemented himself as a pop culture phenomenon. Their first song, \"Hai Allah Re!\" became a big hit in 1973, after it's release. \"Bangladesh\" a song released by the band in 1975 was a protest song, and inspired many bands to write songs about the struggle of the poor. The had more major hit songs in the decade including \"Ami Jare Chaire\" (1975), \"Ashi Ashi Bole Tumi\" (1977) and \"Papri Keno Bojhena\" (1978).\n\nOn the other hand, Spondon was a band mostly doing classical folk songs. They are the first one in Bangladesh, to perform Lalon geeti as a band, which later inspired many bands of the 2000s and 2010s. Their debut album, ''Spondon Bangladesh'' released in 1975 was the best-selling album of the decade, as told by Bichitra. As in the United States a decade prior, where rock music helped change cultural values about race, religion and sexuality, Bangladeshi rock and roll\u2014dominated by Uccharon\u2014showed people that a different life was possible. The protest songs of Uccharon inspired many bands of the 1980s and 1990s to write songs against the autocrat government.\n\n===Pop rock===\n\nIn late 1970s Bangladesh a flourishing culture of groups emerged, sometimes from the declining early rock and roll scene, mostly in [[Chittagong]] and [[Dhaka]]. There was like twenty to thirtie bands in these two cities playing in clubs, hotels and halls. \nMost of these bands were influenced by the [[British Invasion]], [[Music of Bangladesh#Modern Bangla music|Adhunik music]] and the early rock and roll scene in Bangladesh. The pop rock music was lead by the Chittagong based rock band [[Souls (band)|Souls]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2004/04/05/coverstory.htm|title=Star Magazine|website=archive.thedailystar.net|access-date=2019-06-08}}</ref>. After their first single \"Mon Shudhu Mon Chuyeche\" came out in 1980, the band were appreciated by the older rock bands and they released their debut album two years later named, ''Super Souls'', which cemented themselves as one of the best bands of the country. Just like Souls, a band from [[Mohammadpur Thana|Mohammadpur]], Dhaka named Shocking Blue were also doing pop rock music, writing romantic songs. \n\nThough not considered a rock band by many critics, [[Feedback (band)|Feedback]] was successful during the decade, used keyboards as a lead instrument, and had a more techno sound than any earlier band. Inspired by Azam Khan, they imitated hippie fashions, wrote songs to change the cultural values of Bangladesh, and were often political.<ref>https://www.dhakatribune.com/showtime/2018/11/29/we-practised-music-from-our-hearts</ref> [[Miles (band)|Miles]]' [[Miles (Miles album)|self titled debut album]], released in 1982, was the first all-English album in the country. It only featured two original songs by the band. \n\nMost 1970s bands disbanded because of their vocalists' prominence. But, in the 1980s, members maintained cohesion and continued to release hit singles and albums into the 1990s.\n\n== Progression (1980s to early 1990s) ==\n\n=== Psychedelic rock ===\n\n[[James (musician)|Feelings]] was formed in 1978 in [[Chittagong]] by [[James (musician)|James]].

In 2000, Feelings changed their name to ''Nagar Baul''. Their last album was released in 2001, which was ''\u09a6\u09c1\u09b7\u09cd\u099f\u09c1 \u099b\u09c7\u09b2\u09c7\u09b0 \u09a6\u09b2 (Bad Boys Group)''.

Waves introduced Heavy Metal music in Bangladesh. Warfaze was also a progressive band during this period. Feedback was another band, who released the albums ''Ullash'' and ''Mela''. From the mid 1980s to the early 1990s, hard rock became more popular.  \"It was around 1986 when Miles performed hard rock in Dhaka. They performed songs of Iron Maiden which was rocking to people. The next concert was a mind blowing performance, in which they covered several numbers of Iron Maiden and they did very well indeed!\" The band was called In Dhaka, Warfaze and Rock Strata. Different Touch was also active during the late 1980s and early 1990s, playing \"Sraboner Meghgulo\". Nova (1986) and Renaissance were bands from the same period.

Newer bands emerging during this period, such as [[Stentorian]], [[Arbovirus (band)|Arbovirus]], [[Shunno]] and Lalon, also became established. The era also saw the revival of the Chittagong rock-music scene. Although the city is considered the birthplace of Bangladeshi rock it declined during the 1990s, when most local musicians and bands began moving to Dhaka for more opportunity and better facilities. During the early 2010s, the Bangladesh Music Bands Association (BAMBA) and the Chittagong Musical Band Association (CMBA) began organising rock concerts in the city, which gave exposure to local underground bands. This resulted to the emergence of new rock bands in the city, such as Hemorrhage and Blunderware.<ref>{{cite news |title=Silent tears of underground music in Chittagong |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2007/03/04/feature_silent.htm |work=Star Campus |publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |accessdate=23 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=NSR IV rocks Chittagong |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2009/07/03/feature_nsr.htm |work=Star Campus |publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |accessdate=23 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Indie Wave (the 2010s) ==\nNearing the end of the first decade of the millennia, bands like [[Blunderware]], [[Joler Gaan]], Ashes, [[Chirkutt]] and the likes started to penetrate the scene, swaying away from traditional rock to cater to niche audience.

is the rock music in Bangladesh that derived from the [[British rock|British]] and [[American rock|American]] rock music and mixed up with [[Bangladeshi classical music|Bengali classical]] and adhunik music from the 1960s. In Bangladesh rock music is often recognized as \"band music\". From the 1970s to 2000s, it was sometimes considered as the most popular genre in the country. \n\nFrom the mid 1960s to late 1990s, Bangladeshi rock was heavily influential in the development of various kinds of fusion in [[Southern Asia|southern asia]] like: [[Folk rock|folk rock]], [[Pop rock|pop rock]], [[Hard rock music|hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. In the 2000s, Bangladeshi rock music saw the development of heavy metal music as many subgenres emerged in the scene like: \n[[Thrash metal|thrash]], [[Death metal|death]], and [[Progressive metal|progressive]]. \n\nFrom the 2000s to 2010s, genres that emerged in the music scene, included [[Art rock|art]], [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]], [[Post-grunge|post-grunge]], [[Progressive rock|progressive]] and [[Alternative rock|alternative]] rock. Though considered the declining decade, the 2010s produced bands that pushed boundaries in the Bangladeshi rock music scene and earned huge popularity.  \n\n\n==Rock and roll (1960s to mid 1980s)==\n\n===Origins===\n\nThe foundations of Bangladeshi rock was in 1950s [[American rock|American rock and roll]] and Bengali classical music. Back in the 1960s, American rock and roll artist [[Elvis Presley]] had influenced many great rock bands like: [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]]. Drawing influences from the 1950s and 1960s rock and roll artists Bangladeshi bands were starting to form to introduce a new kind of music in the country. In the 1960s, the Gramophone Company of Pakistan had imported many [[Long playing|LP]] and [[Single (music)|singles]] of rock and roll artists like [[Cliff Richard and the Shadows]], Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, [[The Beach Boys|the Beach Boys]] and [[The Hollies|the Hollies]], which were sold very well in Bangladesh. These artists was favored mostly by the high school and college students in Bangladesh. Hence, the mid -60s rock music was influenced and developed a sound that was very similar to the [[Beat (music)|beat]], the [[British Invasion]] and late -60s [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic rock]].\n\nZinga formed by Shafaat Ali in Chittagong introduced [[guitar]], [[drums]] and [[piano]] to the classical music loving generation and most of the people were getting excited about it.

Zinga is the first contender, they were formed in 1963 in Chittagong, but there music was more like adhunik and didn't have the rock and roll sound. It has been argued that the Windy Side of Care was the first rock band of the country formed in 1964. They were also the first band to advertise themselves as psychedelic rock.

In 1968, Zinga released their first song ''Tomari Jiboney'' which became very popular as it was aired on Shadhin Bangla Betar and East Pakistan TV a lot. Shafaat Ali is considered to be the first singer-songwriter of Bangladesh. From the late 1960s, inspired by the Beatles, Zinga became interested in the singer-songwriter concept. Though the song cemented them as a succesfull band, it failed to capture the rock and roll sound.

After their first single \"Mon Shudhu Mon Chuyeche\" came out in 1980, the band were appreciated by the older rock bands and they released their debut album two years later named, ''Super Souls'', which cemented themselves as one of the best bands of the country. Just like Souls, a band from [[Mohammadpur Thana|Mohammadpur]], Dhaka named Shocking Blue were also doing pop rock music, writing romantic songs. \n\nThough not considered a rock band by many critic, [[Feedback (band)|Feedback]] was another succesful band of the decade who used keyboards as a lead instrument and had a more techno sound than any band before them.

It only featured two original songs by the band. \n\nMost of the bands from 1970s broke up as a band as the vocal were by many fans the most prominent figure of the band. But, in the 1980s, the members tried to hold the band together and continued to release hit singles and albums even in the 1990s.\n\n== Progression (1980s to early 1990s) ==\n\n=== Psychedelic rock ===\n\n[[James (musician)|Feelings]] was formed in 1978 in [[Chittagong]] by [[James (musician)|James]].

Their first album ''Station Road'' came out in 1985. It contained hit songs like ''Station Road'', ''Glass Beat Games'' etc.  Their second album  ''\u099c\u09c7\u09b2 \u09a5\u09c7\u0995\u09c7 \u09ac\u09b2\u099b\u09bf (Speaking from Jail)'' was a major success for them. In 2000, Feelings changed their name to ''Nagar Baul''. Their last album was released in 2001, which was ''\u09a6\u09c1\u09b7\u09cd\u099f\u09c1 \u099b\u09c7\u09b2\u09c7\u09b0 \u09a6\u09b2 (Bad Boys Group)''.

Waves introduced Heavy Metal music in Bangladesh. Warfaze was also a progressive band during this period. Feedback was another band, who released the albums ''Ullash'' and ''Mela''. From the mid 1980s to the early 1990s, hard rock became more popular.  \"It was around 1986 when Miles performed hard rock in Dhaka. They performed songs of Iron Maiden which was rocking to people. The next concert was a mind blowing performance, in which they covered several numbers of Iron Maiden and they did very well indeed!\" The band was called In Dhaka, Warfaze and Rock Strata. Different Touch was also active during the late 1980s and early 1990s, playing \"Sraboner Meghgulo\". Nova (1986) and Renaissance were bands from the same period. The era also witnessed the emergence of artists such as [[Ayub Bachchu]] (who created [[Love Runs Blind|LRB]]) and solo performers [[Tapan Chowdhury (singer)|Tapan Chowdhury]] and [[Kumar Bishwajit]].<ref>{{cite news |title=A Lesson in Evolution of Bangladeshi Rock |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=192694 |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)]] |accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Emergence (mid-to-late 1990s) ==\nThe early 1990s was arguably the most productive phase<ref name=\"90'z Rocking the decade\" /> of Bangladeshi rock, featuring bands such as [[Love Runs Blind|LRB]] and [[Ark (Bangladeshi band)|Ark]].

The era also saw the revival of the Chittagong rock-music scene. Although the city is considered the birthplace of Bangladeshi rock it declined during the 1990s, when most local musicians and bands began moving to Dhaka for more opportunity and better facilities. During the early 2010s, the Bangladesh Music Bands Association (BAMBA) and the Chittagong Musical Band Association (CMBA) began organising rock concerts in the city, which gave exposure to local underground bands. This resulted to the emergence of new rock bands in the city, such as Hemorrhage and Blunderware.<ref>{{cite news |title=Silent tears of underground music in Chittagong |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2007/03/04/feature_silent.htm |work=Star Campus |publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |accessdate=23 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=NSR IV rocks Chittagong |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2009/07/03/feature_nsr.htm |work=Star Campus |publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |accessdate=23 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Indie Wave (the 2010s) ==\nNearing the end of the first decade of the millennia, bands like [[Blunderware]], [[Joler Gaan]], Ashes, [[Chirkutt]] and the likes started to penetrate the scene, swaying away from traditional rock to cater to niche audience.

They meet up and Rebecca explains to Oliver why she gave him up. Rebecca then tells Oliver that she wants not further contact with him and leaves. After looking through some mementos, Rebecca realises that she wants to get to know Oliver and they meet up again. When Oliver asks about his father, Rebecca backs off and she later cancels another meeting. Oliver's girlfriend [[Elle Robinson]] ([[Pippa Black]]) later confronts Rebecca about messing Oliver around. When Oliver is injured in a minibus crash, Rebecca visits him and spots a picture of Elle's father, Paul, whom she once spent a romantic weekend with several years earlier. Rebecca believes Paul is Oliver's father, so they take a [[DNA]] test. During this time, Rebecca grows closer to Paul. When the DNA test results come back negative, Rebecca realises that Oliver's father is her violent ex-partner [[Richard Aaronow]] ([[Blair Venn]]), who raped her, resulting in Declan's conception.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://neighbours.com.au/oliver-barnes-character.htm|title=Oliver Barnes Bio |website= Neighbours.com.au |publisher=[[Network Ten]]|accessdate=1 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nRebecca and Paul begin dating and she and Declan move in with him. Rebecca decides to pursue a career in law and she starts working as a secretary at the local law firm. Feeling neglected, Paul embarks on an affair with [[Kirsten Gannon]] ([[Nikola Dubois]]). Paul asks Rebecca to marry him and she accepts. Susan Kennedy tells Rebecca about Paul's affair, leading her to end their engagement. Rebecca becomes a grandmother, after Oliver's daughter, [[List of Neighbours characters (2008)#Chloe Cammeniti|Chloe]] (Sarah May) is born. Rebecca dates [[Andrew Simpson (Neighbours)|Andrew Simpson]] (Peter Flanigan) and agrees to marry him. But realising she still loves Paul, she ends her relationship with Andrew to get back with him. Rebecca becomes a grandmother for the second time when Declan's girlfriend, [[Bridget Parker]] ([[Eloise Mignon]]) gives birth to [[India Napier|India]] (Alia and Gabriella Devercelli). When Bridget dies, Rebecca helps her parents [[Miranda Parker|Miranda]] ([[Nikki Coghill]]) and [[Steve Parker|Steve]] ([[Steve Bastoni]]) organise the funeral. When Miranda and Steve decide to take India and move away to [[Oakey]], Rebecca encourages her son to keep his daughter.\n\nRebecca asks Paul to marry her and he accepts. Rebecca and Paul's wedding is interrupted by [[Lyn Scully]] ([[Janet Andrewartha]]) when she announces that she and Paul are still married. Rebecca is furious that Lyn has ruined her day and she and Lyn have a [[scragfight]] outside Rebecca's house in front of the neighbours. Lyn signs the divorce papers and decides to stay in Erinsborough. She purchases Harold's Store and she and Rebecca, who has begun running Charlie's, try to sabotage each other's businesses. On Christmas Eve, Paul surprises Rebecca by organising a wedding for them in Charlie's. Paul buys local radio station, PirateNet, and appoints Rebecca CEO. Declan later tells Rebecca that Paul has been lying to her about his financial situation and if PirateNet fails, her name is on the papers and the creditors will bankrupt her. When she gives Paul a chance to tell her himself, he does not bring it up and Rebecca threatens Paul with a divorce.\n\nWhen Paul sabotages [[Stephanie Scully]] ([[Carla Bonner]]) and [[Libby Kennedy]] ([[Kym Valentine]]) friendship, Rebecca is disgusted with him and asks him move out. Rebecca allows Paul to move back home after he agrees to take six months off from Lassiter's, placing Declan in charge. Declan tells Rebecca that Paul has been embezzling money, while [[Diana Marshall]] ([[Jane Badler]]) confesses that she had sex with Paul. Rebecca is devastated and goes to Lassiter's to speak to Paul. Shortly afterwards, Paul is pushed off the [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]]. Rebecca is questioned by the police, but denies pushing Paul. She later breaks down in Lyn's arms when Paul's affair with Diana is revealed. Rebecca asks Paul for a divorce, but he tells her that he remembers who pushed him and threatens to implicate Declan. When [[Kate Ramsay]] ([[Ashleigh Brewer]]) finds Declan and Rebecca packing, Rebecca confesses that she did push Paul. She explains that she did it after she went to confront him about his affair with Diana and threatening Declan.\n\nPaul blackmails Rebecca into staying with him. Rebecca finds herself attracted to [[Michael Williams (Neighbours)|Michael Williams]] ([[Sandy Winton]]) and they grow close. Paul forces Rebecca into renewing their vows. Rebecca tells Declan that she loves Michael and she helps Lyn when Paul begins blackmailing her. When Michael asks Rebecca to leave Paul, she confesses that she pushed Paul from the mezzanine and he is blackmailing her. Paul asks Rebecca to spend the night with her at Lassiter's in exchange for filing an [[affidavit]], which states that his fall was an accident and that he refuses the right to press charges against her. Rebecca then tells Paul that their marriage is over. Paul starts a revenge campaign against Rebecca and Declan. Declan contacts Oliver, who returns with his family to get Rebecca. Rebecca refuses to leave Michael and even agrees to marry him. Upon realising that Paul will not stop trying to get revenge, Rebecca tells Susan the truth about Paul's accident and asks her to encourage Kate to come forward to the police about her false alibi. That same day Rebecca, Declan and India leave Erinsborough with Oliver and his family.\n\nThree years later, Rebecca returns to Erinsborough to meet with the mayor about a civic project called Twin Cities. Rebecca visits Susan and [[Karl Kennedy|Karl]] ([[Alan Fletcher (actor)|Alan Fletcher]]), after Karl's name appears on the cover letter. Rebecca runs into Paul and he informs her he is the new mayor and she is back because of him. Paul also admits that he still has feelings for her. After finalising the Twin Cities deal, Rebecca intends to return to Sydney. However, when she learns from [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]) that she was the reason his relationship with Kate ended, she decides to stay and help them get back together. Rebecca is not happy with Paul when he tells Mark to back off, but she softens towards Paul when she realises how much he cares for Kate, and they have sex. Paul asks Rebecca to quit her job and move back to Erinsborough to be with him. Seeing how much Paul is trying, Rebecca agrees. However, she tells Susan that she feels guilty about what she did to him and hopes that being with Paul, her guilt will ease. Susan tells Paul, but he does not believe her and thinks Rebecca still loves him. Rebecca realises that she should not have given Paul false hope and tells him she was staying out of guilt before deciding to return to Sydney. Rebecca sends flowers when Kate dies a few weeks later.\n\nA few years later, Paul and Terese Willis find Rebecca waiting at the Erinsborough community centre, where she is meeting with Toadie to discuss a partnership between the women's shelter she runs and the Sonya Foundation. Rebecca appears surprised Paul and Terese are getting married, and that his former wives Lyn Scully and Gail Lewis are also in town. Rebecca catches up with Karl and Susan, and then she meets Gail for the first time. She admits that being back is bringing up unwelcome memories for her. Paul later finds Rebecca crying on the mezzanine and she apologises for pushing him off it. She tells him that she is angry at herself for letting him turn her into someone she never was. They hug and Terese confronts them, having seen them on the CCTV. Rebecca allows Paul to explain what happened to Terese, and she says that she did not think she was capable of hurting someone like that before marrying Paul. All the wives confront Terese at the day spa, but Rebecca and Lyn get into an argument. Rebecca meets and dates [[Gary Canning]] ([[Damien Richardson (actor)|Damien Richardson]]), but when she learns he is also seeing Gail, she ends their potential romance and leaves town.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Neighbours Scrag Fight.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Rebecca and Lyn Scully fight on Ramsay Street (2009)]]\nA Holy Soap writer stated Rebecca's most notable moment was \"When Toadie and his firm were trying to win compensation for the victims of the dance party roof collapse, she was instrumental in securing the victory.\"<ref name=\"RN\"/> After scenes involving the character fighting with Lyn Scully aired, Darren Rowe of entertainment website [[Digital Spy]] praised the scenes and branding it \"one of the best episodes of 2009\".<ref name=\"fight\">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/scoop/a172519/neighbours-video-lyn-and-rebecca-brawl.html|title='Neighbours' video: Lyn and Rebecca brawl|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi (UK) Ltd]]|author=Rowe, Darren|date=28 August 2009|accessdate=2 February 2010}}</ref> Also stating: \"It is a classic scene and quite simply ''Neighbours'' at its absolute best!\".<ref name=\"fight\"/> Ten years later, Joe Anderton of the same website called the scenes \"a pretty famous fight\" and hoped it would be brought up during Rebecca and Lyn's returns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/a28743501/neighbours-rebecca-napier-return-paul-robinson-ex-wives-plot-revenge/|title=Neighbours confirms return for Rebecca Napier as Paul's ex-wives plot revenge|last=Anderton|first=Joe|date=19 August 2019|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=28 August 2019}}</ref> Jim Schembri of ''[[The Age]]'' commented on Rebecca's choice in men after her partner Paul Robinson revealed he killed Gus Cleary, stating that she has a bad history of attraction to violent men.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv-reviews/neighbours/2007/09/13/1189276878094.html|title=Neighbours \u2013 TV Reviews \u2013 TV & Radio \u2013 Entertainment|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|author=Schembri, Jim|date=13 September 2007|accessdate=2 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nRuth Deller of entertainment website [[Lowculture]] praised Rebecca's character development stating: \"Rebecca was such a badly-written, flaky character when she first arrived in Ramsay Street, but thankfully the scriptwriters soon realised just what an asset actress Jane Hall was to the show and turned her around to become awesome.

When Oliver is injured in a minibus crash, Rebecca visits him and spots a picture of Elle's father, Paul, whom she once spent a romantic weekend with several years earlier. Rebecca believes Paul is Oliver's father, so they take a [[DNA]] test. During this time, Rebecca grows closer to Paul.

Rebecca dates [[Andrew Simpson (Neighbours)|Andrew Simpson]] (Peter Flanigan) and agrees to marry him. But realising she still loves Paul, she ends her relationship with Andrew to get back with him.

When Bridget dies, Rebecca helps her parents [[Miranda Parker|Miranda]] ([[Nikki Coghill]]) and [[Steve Parker|Steve]] ([[Steve Bastoni]]) organise the funeral. When Miranda and Steve decide to take India and move away to [[Oakey]], Rebecca encourages her son to keep his daughter.\n\nRebecca asks Paul to marry her and he accepts. Rebecca and Paul's wedding is interrupted by [[Lyn Scully]] ([[Janet Andrewartha]]) when she announces that she and Paul are still married. Rebecca is furious that Lyn has ruined her day and she and Lyn have a [[scragfight]] outside Rebecca's house in front of the neighbours. Lyn signs the divorce papers and decides to stay in Erinsborough. She purchases Harold's Store and she and Rebecca, who has begun running Charlie's, try to sabotage each other's businesses. On Christmas Eve, Paul surprises Rebecca by organising a wedding for them in Charlie's. Paul buys local radio station, PirateNet, and appoints Rebecca CEO. Declan later tells Rebecca that Paul has been lying to her about his financial situation and if PirateNet fails, her name is on the papers and the creditors will bankrupt her. When she gives Paul a chance to tell her himself, he does not bring it up and Rebecca threatens Paul with a divorce.\n\nWhen Paul sabotages [[Stephanie Scully]] ([[Carla Bonner]]) and [[Libby Kennedy]] ([[Kym Valentine]]) friendship, Rebecca is disgusted with him and asks him move out. Rebecca allows Paul to move back home after he agrees to take six months off from Lassiter's, placing Declan in charge. Declan tells Rebecca that Paul has been embezzling money, while [[Diana Marshall]] ([[Jane Badler]]) confesses that she had sex with Paul. Rebecca is devastated and goes to Lassiter's to speak to Paul. Shortly afterwards, Paul is pushed off the [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]]. Rebecca is questioned by the police, but denies pushing Paul. She later breaks down in Lyn's arms when Paul's affair with Diana is revealed. Rebecca asks Paul for a divorce, but he tells her that he remembers who pushed him and threatens to implicate Declan. When [[Kate Ramsay]] ([[Ashleigh Brewer]]) finds Declan and Rebecca packing, Rebecca confesses that she did push Paul. She explains that she did it after she went to confront him about his affair with Diana and threatening Declan.\n\nPaul blackmails Rebecca into staying with him. Rebecca finds herself attracted to [[Michael Williams (Neighbours)|Michael Williams]] ([[Sandy Winton]]) and they grow close. Paul forces Rebecca into renewing their vows. Rebecca tells Declan that she loves Michael and she helps Lyn when Paul begins blackmailing her. When Michael asks Rebecca to leave Paul, she confesses that she pushed Paul from the mezzanine and he is blackmailing her. Paul asks Rebecca to spend the night with her at Lassiter's in exchange for filing an [[affidavit]], which states that his fall was an accident and that he refuses the right to press charges against her. Rebecca then tells Paul that their marriage is over. Paul starts a revenge campaign against Rebecca and Declan. Declan contacts Oliver, who returns with his family to get Rebecca. Rebecca refuses to leave Michael and even agrees to marry him. Upon realising that Paul will not stop trying to get revenge, Rebecca tells Susan the truth about Paul's accident and asks her to encourage Kate to come forward to the police about her false alibi. That same day Rebecca, Declan and India leave Erinsborough with Oliver and his family.\n\nThree years later, Rebecca returns to Erinsborough to meet with the mayor about a civic project called Twin Cities. Rebecca visits Susan and [[Karl Kennedy|Karl]] ([[Alan Fletcher (actor)|Alan Fletcher]]), after Karl's name appears on the cover letter. Rebecca runs into Paul and he informs her he is the new mayor and she is back because of him. Paul also admits that he still has feelings for her. After finalising the Twin Cities deal, Rebecca intends to return to Sydney. However, when she learns from [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]) that she was the reason his relationship with Kate ended, she decides to stay and help them get back together. Rebecca is not happy with Paul when he tells Mark to back off, but she softens towards Paul when she realises how much he cares for Kate, and they have sex. Paul asks Rebecca to quit her job and move back to Erinsborough to be with him. Seeing how much Paul is trying, Rebecca agrees. However, she tells Susan that she feels guilty about what she did to him and hopes that being with Paul, her guilt will ease. Susan tells Paul, but he does not believe her and thinks Rebecca still loves him. Rebecca realises that she should not have given Paul false hope and tells him she was staying out of guilt before deciding to return to Sydney. Rebecca sends flowers when Kate dies a few weeks later.\n\nA few years later, Paul and Terese Willis find Rebecca waiting at the Erinsborough community centre, where she is meeting with Toadie to discuss a partnership between the women's shelter she runs and the Sonya Foundation. Rebecca appears surprised Paul and Terese are getting married, and that his former wives Lyn Scully and Gail Lewis are also in town. Rebecca catches up with Karl and Susan, and then she meets Gail for the first time. She admits that being back is bringing up unwelcome memories for her. Paul later finds Rebecca crying on the mezzanine and she apologises for pushing him off it. She tells him that she is angry at herself for letting him turn her into someone she never was. They hug and Terese confronts them, having seen them on the CCTV. Rebecca allows Paul to explain what happened to Terese, and she says that she did not think she was capable of hurting someone like that before marrying Paul. All the wives confront Terese at the day spa, but Rebecca and Lyn get into an argument.
