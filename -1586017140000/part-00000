After debuting on September 20, 1990, at 8 pm, CBS moved the series to 8:30{{nbsp}}pm with its second episode, in an attempt to broadcast opposite less formidable competition in Fox's ''Babes'', NBC's ''[[A Different World]]'' and the second half-hour of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''Father Dowling Mysteries''.<ref name=\"LATimes\" /> Eventually, CBS moved the series off Thursdays entirely, moving the show to Saturday nights.<ref name=\"CBBin\" /> Had the show continued, it was revealed the second season would have opened with the Flash's rogues teaming up to take down the hero.<ref name=\"CBBin\" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Age Of TV Heroes: The Live-Action Adventures Of Your Favorite Comic Book Characters |last=Hofius |first=Jason |authorlink= |author2=George Khoury  |year=2010 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |location= |isbn=1-60549-010-5 |page= |pages= |url= }}</ref>\n<!--The unusual 8:30 slot did not work and the series floundered when moved to 9pm.

Four-minute promos of the series aired at all [[Six Flags]] amusement parks and a few weeks before the pilot's debut, Warner Bros. flew banners over beaches on both coasts. Describing the marketing, George Schweitzer, senior vice president of communications at the CBS Broadcast Group said, \"It's not being sold as a comic book. It's being sold like ''Batman'' [the 1989 film] \u2013 dark and mysterious and exciting.

The elegant gentleman, a young attorney, returned her love in various ways, including purchasing her a home where he would later enjoy her cooking and would occasionally also invite his professional friends, including attorneys, judges, and prosecutors, for socializing with their wives. Their romance, however, ended abruptly when Isabel, walking downtown with her cousin Norma, recognized her wealthy boyfriend as the groom in the nuptial caravan that passed her during her boyfriend's unannounced marriage to another girl, also a member of Ponce's upper class. Emotionally affected by the experience and \"in a bath of tears\", Isabel told her cousin Norma that \"the man that from that day hence wants to enter my house has to pay a charge.\" Thus developed the beginnings of Isabel as a brothel owner.<ref name=\"Jose Antonio Cangiano 2007. page 5\">Jose Antonio Cangiano. \"The People of Puerto Rico v.

In his legal documentary ''\"Receso del Tribunal: Vivencias Judiciales of Jose Angel Cangiano\"'' (\"Courtroom Recess: Judicial Experiences of Jose Angel Cangiano\"), he debunks those stories and documents Isabel's true story: As a young girl of the poor lower class in Ponce, Isabel fell in love with the son of a wealthy upper class homeowner in the city where her mother worked as a housemaid. The elegant gentleman, a young attorney, returned her love in various ways, including purchasing her a home where he would later enjoy her cooking and would occasionally also invite his professional friends, including attorneys, judges, and prosecutors, for socializing with their wives. Their romance, however, ended abruptly when Isabel, walking downtown with her cousin Norma, recognized her wealthy boyfriend as the groom in the nuptial caravan that passed her during her boyfriend's unannounced marriage to another girl, also a member of Ponce's upper class. Emotionally affected by the experience and \"in a bath of tears\", Isabel told her cousin Norma that \"the man that from that day hence wants to enter my house has to pay a charge.\" Thus developed the beginnings of Isabel as a brothel owner.<ref name=\"Jose Antonio Cangiano 2007. page 5\">Jose Antonio Cangiano. \"The People of Puerto Rico v.

{"title_page": "First Doctor comic stories", "text_new": "\n\n'''First Doctor comic stories''' refers to the [[List of Doctor Who comic stories|comic strips]] devoted to the long-running British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', using the likeness of the [[First Doctor]] [[William Hartnell]]. The strip was launched in [[Polystyle Publications|Polystyle's]] ''[[TV Comic]]'' on 14 November 1964, less than a year after the television series began broadcasting and was the first original [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media from the show.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This strip began what has become known as the '[[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|Polystyle era]]': running from 1964 to 1979.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The First Doctor starred in this strip running parallel with his appearance on the television show, ending in December 1966, after which ''TV Comic'' began creating strips for the [[Second Doctor]]. The franchise to print a regular comic strip passed to ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (then ''Doctor Who Weekly'') in 1979, and was opened up to multiple franchises in the mid-2000s. During this time, the First Doctor has made various guest appearances as well as starring in some one-off comic strips. \n\n== Polystyle comic strips (1964-1966) ==\n\n=== History ===\n\n''TV Comic'', according to ''Doctor Who'' historian Jeremy Bentham, 'had grown up in the wake of commercial television. Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\n'''''Artists:''''' There were three artists during the ''TV Comic'' First Doctor period. '''Neville Main''' was the first to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor).<ref name=\"Scoones2012-23-61\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 23-61</ref> Main drew the first 9 stories (46 episodes) of the ''TVC'' strip, plus one single episode strip for the 1965 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and two single episode strips for the 1965 ''TVC Annual 1966''. '''Bill Mevin''' took over for the middle of the run, producing 7 stories (28 episodes) for ''TVC'' between October 1965 and April 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-62-75\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 62-75</ref> Although he produced no ''TVC Holiday Special'' or ''TVC Annual'' strips during this time, he returned later in 1966 to draw one of the two strips single episode strips for that year's ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-91\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 91</ref> After Mevin's relatively short tenure, the ''TVC'' strip was taken on by '''John Canning''' who produced 8 stories (36 episodes) plus two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and one of the two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-77-96\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 77-96</ref> Canning was thus the last of the three artists to draw the First Doctor for ''TVC'', and, furthermore, would go on to kick off the Second Doctor run which began late December 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-100\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 100</ref>\n\n'''''Writers:''''' The situation with the writers is more complex. Writing in 1982, Jeremy Bentham commented 'In those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> \n\n'''''Style:''''' Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref>\n\n=== List of comic strips ===\n\nThe list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in ''TV Comic'' (''TVC'') as well the yearly ''TV Comic Holiday Special'' (''TVCHS'') and ''TV Comic Annual'' (''TVCA'').

The strip was launched in [[Polystyle Publications|Polystyle's]] ''[[TV Comic]]'' on 14 November 1964, less than a year after the television series began broadcasting and was the first original [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media from the show.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This strip began what has become known as the '[[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|Polystyle era]]': running from 1964 to 1979.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The First Doctor starred in this strip running parallel with his appearance on the television show, ending in December 1966, after which ''TV Comic'' began creating strips for the [[Second Doctor]]. The franchise to print a regular comic strip passed to ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (then ''Doctor Who Weekly'') in 1979, and was opened up to multiple franchises in the mid-2000s. During this time, the First Doctor has made various guest appearances as well as starring in some one-off comic strips. \n\n== Polystyle comic strips (1964-1966) ==\n\n=== History ===\n\n''TV Comic'', according to ''Doctor Who'' historian Jeremy Bentham, 'had grown up in the wake of commercial television. Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\n'''''Artists:''''' There were three artists during the ''TV Comic'' First Doctor period. '''Neville Main''' was the first to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor).<ref name=\"Scoones2012-23-61\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 23-61</ref> Main drew the first 9 stories (46 episodes) of the ''TVC'' strip, plus one single episode strip for the 1965 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and two single episode strips for the 1965 ''TVC Annual 1966''. '''Bill Mevin''' took over for the middle of the run, producing 7 stories (28 episodes) for ''TVC'' between October 1965 and April 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-62-75\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 62-75</ref> Although he produced no ''TVC Holiday Special'' or ''TVC Annual'' strips during this time, he returned later in 1966 to draw one of the two strips single episode strips for that year's ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-91\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 91</ref> After Mevin's relatively short tenure, the ''TVC'' strip was taken on by '''John Canning''' who produced 8 stories (36 episodes) plus two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and one of the two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-77-96\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 77-96</ref> Canning was thus the last of the three artists to draw the First Doctor for ''TVC'', and, furthermore, would go on to kick off the Second Doctor run which began late December 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-100\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 100</ref>\n\n'''''Writers:''''' The situation with the writers is more complex. Writing in 1982, Jeremy Bentham commented 'In those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> \n\n'''''Style:''''' Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref>\n\n=== List of comic strips ===\n\nThe list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in ''TV Comic'' (''TVC'') as well the yearly ''TV Comic Holiday Special'' (''TVCHS'') and ''TV Comic Annual'' (''TVCA'').

Set during the [[Spanish Civil War]], it centers on a fictional [[Andaluc\u00eda|Andalusian]] actress making a film in [[Nazi Germany]] who becomes the object of [[Joseph Goebbels]]' attentions. \n\n==Plot==\nIn 1938, while Spain is in the grip of [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]], a film team from territory held by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s rebels are invited to the co-production in Berlin of a musical set in 19th-century [[Andalusia|Andalucia]], to be shot in separate Spanish and German versions. At first happy to be working away from their war-torn country, the group find life under [[Nazism]] increasingly unpleasant and dangerous. \n\nMacarena, their attractive star, soon catches the eye of [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]], the [[Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]], who is determined to bed her. Though she finds him repulsive, and prefers the company of Blas, the married director of the Spanish version, it is made clear to her that for the sake of the project and of Hispano-German relations she must comply.\n\nWhen she points out that the extras in the film look ridiculously inauthentic, being tall and fair-haired, they are replaced by short dark [[Jews|Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] prisoners from a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]], under armed [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] guards. An extra with whom she sympathises, a handsome Russian called Leo, escapes the guards and she smuggles him into the villa where Goebbels has installed her. When Goebbels calls round, Leo knocks him out cold.\n\nBlas realises that this is the end of the road for the project and rushes to see Goebbels' [[Magda Goebbels|wife]], who is well aware of her husband's activities. She writes him a pass enabling Leo, Macarena and her dresser to board a plane that night.

Set during the [[Spanish Civil War]], it centers on a fictional [[Andaluc\u00eda|Andalusian]] actress making a film in [[Nazi Germany]] who becomes the object of [[Joseph Goebbels]]' attentions. \n\n==Plot==\nIn 1938, while Spain is in the grip of [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]], a film team from territory held by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s rebels are invited to the co-production in Berlin of a musical set in 19th-century [[Andalusia|Andalucia]], to be shot in separate Spanish and German versions. At first happy to be working away from their war-torn country, the group find life under [[Nazism]] increasingly unpleasant and dangerous. \n\nMacarena, their attractive star, soon catches the eye of [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]], the [[Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]], who is determined to bed her. Though she finds him repulsive, and prefers the company of Blas, the married director of the Spanish version, it is made clear to her that for the sake of the project and of Hispano-German relations she must comply.\n\nWhen she points out that the extras in the film look ridiculously inauthentic, being tall and fair-haired, they are replaced by short dark [[Jews|Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] prisoners from a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]], under armed [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] guards. An extra with whom she sympathises, a handsome Russian called Leo, escapes the guards and she smuggles him into the villa where Goebbels has installed her. When Goebbels calls round, Leo knocks him out cold.\n\nBlas realises that this is the end of the road for the project and rushes to see Goebbels' [[Magda Goebbels|wife]], who is well aware of her husband's activities. She writes him a pass enabling Leo, Macarena and her dresser to board a plane that night. The fate of the rest of the group, who are all under arrest, is unclear.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] as Macarena Granada\n* [[Antonio Resines]] as Blas Fontiveros\n* [[Jorge Sanz]] as Juli\u00e1n Torralba\n* [[Rosa Maria Sard\u00e0]] as Rosa Rosales\n* [[Santiago Segura]] as Castillo\n* [[Loles Le\u00f3n]] as Trini Morenos\n* [[Jes\u00fas Bonilla]] as Marco Bonilla\n* [[Neus Asensi]] as Lucia Gandia\n* [[Miroslav T\u00e1borsk\u00fd]] as V\u00e1clav Passer\n* [[Johannes Silberschneider]] as [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]]\n* [[Karel Dobry]] as Leo\n* [[G\u00f6tz Otto]] as Heinrich von Wermelskirch\n* [[Hanna Schygulla]] as [[Magda Goebbels]]\n* [[Mar\u00eda Barranco]] as Ambassador's wife\n* [[Juan Luis Galiardo]] as Ambassador\n\n== Historical background ==\nDuring the Civil War, filmmakers from the Nationalist side found work in Germany and Italy.
