The song was written by Keys, [[Illangelo]], Billy Walsh and [[Taylor Parks]], and produced by Illangelo. It is a departure from her R&B sound, having a [[tropical music]] and [[dancehall]] sound, with [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] beat, [[Afrobeat]] instrumental, collage of electronic beats, tropicalia-infused rhythms and icy drum patterns as its main instrumentation. Keys uses a hushed tone throughout the song.\n\nThe song's accompanying music video was shot in [[black-and-white]] and released on May 20, 2016. It features Keys grooving on a fire escape alongside dancers of all ages and races.

The song was written by Keys, [[Illangelo]], Billy Walsh and [[Taylor Parks]], and produced by Illangelo. It is a departure from her R&B sound, having a [[tropical music]] and [[dancehall]] sound, with [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] beat, [[Afrobeat]] instrumental, collage of electronic beats, tropicalia-infused rhythms and icy drum patterns as its main instrumentation. Keys uses a hushed tone throughout the song.\n\nThe song's accompanying music video was shot in [[black-and-white]] and released on May 20, 2016. It features Keys grooving on a fire escape alongside dancers of all ages and races. Keys gave the first televised performance of the track on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and later at the [[UEFA Champions League Final]]. The song is only available on the Deluxe Edition of ''Here''. A remix of the song features American [[rappers]] [[Kanye West]] and [[Travis Scott]].\n\n== Background and release ==\nAfter the success of her fifth studio album, ''[[Girl on Fire (album)|Girl on Fire]]'' (2012), Alicia Keys took a break and in 2014 announced she was expecting her second child with husband [[Swizz Beatz]].

The entire image is repeated within the computer monitor.\n}}\n\n'''''The Stanley Parable''''' is an [[interactive drama]] and [[Adventure game#Walking simulators|walking simulator]] designed by American developer Davey Wreden. The game was originally released on July 27, 2011 as a free [[Mod (video gaming)|mod]] for ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. Together with [[William Pugh (game designer)|William Pugh]], Wreden later released a stand-alone [[remake]] using the [[List of Source engine mods|Source engine]] under the Galactic Cafe studio name. The remake included new story elements and upgraded graphics. It was announced and approved via [[Steam Greenlight]] in 2012, and was released on October 17, 2013, for [[Microsoft Windows]]. Later updates to the game added support for [[OS X]] on December 19, 2013, and for [[Linux]] on September 9, 2015. A further expanded edition entitled '''''The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe''''' is scheduled for release in 2020. It will be available on consoles and include additional content.\n\nThe game has no combat or other action-based sequences. Instead, the gameplay involves guiding a [[silent protagonist]] named Stanley alongside [[narration]] by British actor Kevan Brighting. As the story progresses, the player is confronted with diverging pathways. The player may disobey the narrator's suggestions, which will then be incorporated into the story. Depending on the choices made, the player will encounter different endings before the game restarts. The remake recreated many of the original mod's choices while adding new areas and story pathways. Both the original mod and the remake have received critical praise from journalists. Critics praised the game's narrative and commentary on player choice and decision-making.\n\n== Gameplay and story ==\n[[File:The Stanley Parable - Screenshot 03.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The game begins in a mysteriously abandoned office.|alt=A brightly lit office space with tanish-brown flooring, egg-white walls, and square overhead lights. Several closed doors leading to personal offices and other rooms line the walls, as well as plants and other office-related objects. In the center of the room is a large filing cabinet.]]\n\nThe game is presented to the player from the [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The player can move around and interact with certain elements of the environment, such as pressing buttons or opening doors, but has no other controls.<ref name=\"kotaku\" />\n\nThe story is primarily presented to the player by the narrator. He explains that the protagonist Stanley works in an office building, tasked to monitor data coming on a computer screen and press buttons appropriately without question. One day that screen goes blank. Stanley, unsure what to do, starts to explore the building and finds it devoid of people.<ref name=\"kotaku\" />\n\nAt this stage, the story splits off in numerous possibilities, based on the player's choices. When the player comes to an area where a choice is possible, the narrator will suggest which route Stanley will take. The player can opt to go against the narrator and perform the other action. Doing so will force the narration to account for this new direction which may return the player back to the target path or create a new narration. For example, the first choice the player makes in the game is at a set of two open doors with the narrator stating that Stanley chose the left door.{{Efn|Technically speaking, the first choice in the game is choosing whether or not to lock Stanley's office door, in which locking it results in a unique ending, but the choice between the two doors is the first one that is obviously presented to the player.<ref name=\"endingtree\">{{Cite web|url=https://guardianlv.com/2013/10/the-stanley-parable-endings-guide-the-definitive-ending-tree/|title=The Stanley Parable Endings Guide: the Definitive Ending Tree|last=Fenner|first=James|date=2013-10-27|website=Guardian Liberty Voice|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>}} The player can choose to follow this narration, which keeps the narrator's story on track, or may choose the right door, which causes the narrator to adjust his story to get the player to return to the \"proper\" path.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> The narrator also breaks the [[fourth wall]] on several occasions in handling the player's decisions.<ref name=\"wired\" /> A total of six possible endings exist in the original mod, and Wreden states it would take about an hour for the player to experience them all.<ref name=\"wired\">{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2011/08/the-stanley-parable/ | title = Brilliant Indie Game The Stanley Parable Will Mess With Your Head | first = Jason | last = Schreier | date =2011-08-16 | accessdate = 2013-01-03 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref> The remake adds in more than 10 additional endings, as well as several [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] and other choice-related gameplay aspects.<ref name=\"endingtree\" /> The ''Ultra Deluxe'' edition will expand on this further.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Development ==\n=== ''Half-Life 2'' mod ===\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Initially, I just wanted to make a game that was something I\u2019d never seen before.

Wreden used an audition process to find a narrator, and found Brighting's submission to be ideal for the game.<ref name=\"gamasutra behind\" /> Brighting had provided his voice in a single pass.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Wreden wanted to keep the game short so as to allow players to experience all the endings without spending an excessive amount of time replaying the game.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> The shortness of the game would also allow him to introduce ridiculous and nonsense endings, such as \"and then everything was happy!\", that would otherwise insult the player as a poor reward for completing a long game.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Most of the ideas he had envisioned for the game were included, though some had to be dropped due to his inability to figure out how to work with them within the Source engine.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /> In one case, Wreden wanted to include a point where the player would have to press buttons as the narration and screen prompts would have said, but could not figure out how to bind keyboard input to do this, but left the element in there as a \"broken\" puzzle; he later was praised for this, as to players, this gave the impression of lacking control during the stage of narration.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Despite the success of completing the game, Wreden considered the overall project \"grueling\" and stifling his career ambition,<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> noting that his efforts became more intense once he started learning of other players' interest in the title.<ref name=\"shacknews\" />\n\nWreden initially tested the game with a friend before posting the mod to the website [[ModDB]], a few weeks prior to his graduation from college.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /><ref name=\"rps interview\"/> After graduating, Wreden had left for Australia with intent to open a video game-themed bar similar to the [[Mana Bar]], which he had worked at for about a year, but his future plans changed with success of the mod.<ref name=\"rps interview\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/03/28/davey-wreden-william-pugh-the-stanley-parable-interview/ | title = Davey Wreden & William Pugh: Life After The Stanley Parable | first = John | last = Walker | date= 2014-03-28 | accessdate = 2014-03-28 | publisher = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref> Wreden had started to receive various offers from others to help work on new games as well as some job offers from larger developers which he turned down, as at the time it was \"not the kind of scene\" he wanted to work in.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /> Instead, he started to gather other independent programmers to work out an improved version of ''The Stanley Parable'' and leading towards a completely new title in the future.<ref name=\"shacknews\" />\n\n=== Remake ===\n[[File:Stanley parable screenshot comparison.jpg|thumb|The \"Mind Control Facility\" in both the original mod (top) and remake (bottom).

However, Pugh also found that without some visual cues as to where divergent paths occurred, they would often miss these choices, and so added elements like colors to highlight that a choice was available at these points.<ref name=\"gamasutra behind\" /> In the original mod, one set of choices briefly takes the player to sections modeled after parts of ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. In the remake, Pugh and Wreden included one section where the player briefly revisits the opening of ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', and another where the player is dropped into a ''[[Minecraft]]'' world.

The entire image is repeated within the computer monitor.\n}}\n\n'''''The Stanley Parable''''' is an [[interactive drama]] and [[Adventure game#Walking simulators|walking simulator]] designed by American developer Davey Wreden. The game was originally released on July 27, 2011 as a free [[Mod (video gaming)|mod]] for ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. Together with [[William Pugh (game designer)|William Pugh]], Wreden later released a stand-alone [[remake]] using the [[List of Source engine mods|Source engine]] under the Galactic Cafe studio name. The remake included new story elements and upgraded graphics. It was announced and approved via [[Steam Greenlight]] in 2012, and was released on October 17, 2013, for [[Microsoft Windows]]. Later updates to the game added support for [[OS X]] on December 19, 2013, and for [[Linux]] on September 9, 2015. A further expanded edition entitled '''''The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe''''' is scheduled for release in 2020. It will be available on consoles and include additional content.\n\nThe game has no combat or other action-based sequences. Instead, the gameplay involves guiding a [[silent protagonist]] named Stanley alongside [[narration]] by British actor Kevan Brighting. As the story progresses, the player is confronted with diverging pathways. The player may disobey the narrator's suggestions, which will then be incorporated into the story. Depending on the choices made, the player will encounter different endings before the game restarts. The remake recreated many of the original mod's choices while adding new areas and story pathways. Both the original mod and the remake have received critical praise from journalists. Critics praised the game's narrative and commentary on player choice and decision-making.\n\n== Gameplay and story ==\n[[File:The Stanley Parable - Screenshot 03.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The game begins in a mysteriously abandoned office.|alt=A brightly lit office space with tanish-brown flooring, egg-white walls, and square overhead lights. Several closed doors leading to personal offices and other rooms line the walls, as well as plants and other office-related objects. In the center of the room is a large filing cabinet.]]\n\nThe game is presented to the player from the [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The player can move around and interact with certain elements of the environment, such as pressing buttons or opening doors, but has no other controls.<ref name=\"kotaku\" />\n\nThe story is primarily presented to the player by the narrator. He explains that the protagonist Stanley works in an office building, tasked to monitor data coming on a computer screen and press buttons appropriately without question. One day that screen goes blank. Stanley, unsure what to do, starts to explore the building and finds it devoid of people.<ref name=\"kotaku\" />\n\nAt this stage, the story splits off in numerous possibilities, based on the player's choices. When the player comes to an area where a choice is possible, the narrator will suggest which route Stanley will take. The player can opt to go against the narrator and perform the other action. Doing so will force the narration to account for this new direction which may return the player back to the target path or create a new narration. For example, the first choice the player makes in the game is at a set of two open doors with the narrator stating that Stanley chose the left door.{{Efn|Technically speaking, the first choice in the game is choosing whether or not to lock Stanley's office door, in which locking it results in a unique ending, but the choice between the two doors is the first one that is obviously presented to the player.<ref name=\"endingtree\">{{Cite web|url=https://guardianlv.com/2013/10/the-stanley-parable-endings-guide-the-definitive-ending-tree/|title=The Stanley Parable Endings Guide: the Definitive Ending Tree|last=Fenner|first=James|date=2013-10-27|website=Guardian Liberty Voice|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>}} The player can choose to follow this narration, which keeps the narrator's story on track, or may choose the right door, which causes the narrator to adjust his story to get the player to return to the \"proper\" path.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> The narrator also breaks the [[fourth wall]] on several occasions in handling the player's decisions.<ref name=\"wired\" /> A total of six possible endings exist in the original mod, and Wreden states it would take about an hour for the player to experience them all.<ref name=\"wired\">{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2011/08/the-stanley-parable/ | title = Brilliant Indie Game The Stanley Parable Will Mess With Your Head | first = Jason | last = Schreier | date =2011-08-16 | accessdate = 2013-01-03 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref> The remake adds in more than 10 additional endings, as well as several [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] and other choice-related gameplay aspects.<ref name=\"endingtree\" /> The ''Ultra Deluxe'' edition will expand on this further.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Development ==\n=== ''Half-Life 2'' mod ===\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Initially, I just wanted to make a game that was something I\u2019d never seen before.

Wreden used an audition process to find a narrator, and found Brighting's submission to be ideal for the game.<ref name=\"gamasutra behind\" /> Brighting had provided his voice in a single pass.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Wreden wanted to keep the game short so as to allow players to experience all the endings without spending an excessive amount of time replaying the game.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> The shortness of the game would also allow him to introduce ridiculous and nonsense endings, such as \"and then everything was happy!\", that would otherwise insult the player as a poor reward for completing a long game.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Most of the ideas he had envisioned for the game were included, though some had to be dropped due to his inability to figure out how to work with them within the Source engine.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /> In one case, Wreden wanted to include a point where the player would have to press buttons as the narration and screen prompts would have said, but could not figure out how to bind keyboard input to do this, but left the element in there as a \"broken\" puzzle; he later was praised for this, as to players, this gave the impression of lacking control during the stage of narration.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Despite the success of completing the game, Wreden considered the overall project \"grueling\" and stifling his career ambition,<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> noting that his efforts became more intense once he started learning of other players' interest in the title.<ref name=\"shacknews\" />\n\nWreden initially tested the game with a friend before posting the mod to the website [[ModDB]], a few weeks prior to his graduation from college.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /><ref name=\"rps interview\"/> After graduating, Wreden had left for Australia with intent to open a video game-themed bar similar to the [[Mana Bar]], which he had worked at for about a year, but his future plans changed with success of the mod.<ref name=\"rps interview\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/03/28/davey-wreden-william-pugh-the-stanley-parable-interview/ | title = Davey Wreden & William Pugh: Life After The Stanley Parable | first = John | last = Walker | date= 2014-03-28 | accessdate = 2014-03-28 | publisher = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref> Wreden had started to receive various offers from others to help work on new games as well as some job offers from larger developers which he turned down, as at the time it was \"not the kind of scene\" he wanted to work in.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /> Instead, he started to gather other independent programmers to work out an improved version of ''The Stanley Parable'' and leading towards a completely new title in the future.<ref name=\"shacknews\" />\n\n=== Remake ===\n[[File:Stanley parable screenshot comparison.jpg|thumb|The \"Mind Control Facility\" in both the original mod (top) and remake (bottom).
