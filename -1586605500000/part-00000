His first reported ride from [[Mannheim]] to Rheinau (now a section of Mannheim) took place on June 12, 1817.  Drais was a German [[inventor]] and invented the [[Laufmaschine]] (\"running machine\"), also later called the [[velocipede]], ''[[draisine]]'' ([[English language|English]]) or \"draisienne\" ([[French language|French]]), or nicknamed, [[dandy horse]].

The film was written by [[John Gay (screenwriter)|John Gay]], produced by [[Lew Grade]], and directed by [[Glenn Jordan]] (no relation to star Richard Jordan). The film originally aired on [[U.S.]] television on [[CBS]] on 27 December 1978.\n\n==Plot==\nThe plot follows the general outline of the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Plot|novel of the same name]], omitting many details and some entire episodes. The narrative is strictly chronological and avoids the digressions required to mirror the novel's structure. Many of the novel's minor characters do not appear or are combined. For example, the role of the Th\u00e9nardiers is reduced to a scene in which Valjean ransoms Cosette from them.\n\nThe film begins with Jean Valjean's theft and then lingers in the Toulon prison where his mistreatment is detailed under the gaze of Javert, who witnesses Valjean's amazing feat of strength in rescuing a man crushed under a boulder. Valjean escapes when saving another convict who had fallen while repairing some battlements. Struggling to survive, he encounters a kindly Bishop, who feeds and shelters him. He steals silver plates from the Bishop. When Valjean is arrested and brought back to the Bishop, the Bishop pretends the silver pieces were a gift, dismisses the police, and gives Valjean two silver candlesticks in addition to what he had originally stolen. Valjean is overcome. The Bishop tells him he has purchased his soul for God and that his life will now be different.\n\nValjean becomes a prosperous businessman using techniques for the manufacture of black beads that he learned in Toulon and becomes mayor of his town under the name Madeleine. Javert arrives to serve as chief of the local police. He thinks he recognizes Madeleine and notes his use of the Toulon manufacturing method. Madeleine rescues the beggar Fantine, who recounts her history in a few sentences, when Javert is about to punish her, and Javert witnesses Madeleine rescue a man trapped beneath a cart, another astonishing feat of strength. Javert denounces Madeleine to his superiors, but before they can confirm Madeleine is actually Valjean, another man is arrested and charged in Arras with being the escaped convict Valjean. Javert confesses his actions to Madeleine and asks to be dismissed from his position. Madeleine refuses his request and goes to Arras where he wins the release of the falsely accused man by identifying himself as Valjean.\n\nValjean returns to his town and tries to help the dying Fantine while he awaits arrest. He learns how the Th\u00e9nardiers are caring for her daughter Cosette. Javert insists on arresting him, Fantine dies, and Valjean escapes. He ransoms Cosette from the Th\u00e9nardiers and gives her a doll. Living in Paris with Cosette, Valjean escapes from Javert, who is directing police searches of the district where he is living, by climbing a wall, landing in the garden of a Paris convent. The gardener is the man he rescued from being crushed under a cart, who agrees to pretend he and Valjean are brothers and recommends him to the nuns as a gardener. Cosette attends the convent school. When she completes her education and has become a young woman, Valjean decides they should leave the convent's cloistered premises so she can experience the world.  \n\nValjean and Cosette are strolling in a public garden and pause to listen to radicals denounce the government. Cosette and Marius, one of the radical group though not a speaker, see one another and their eyes lock. Marius pays the urchin Gavroche to tail them and report their address to him. Marius soon romances Cosette through the entrance gate to their home. Valjean sees this and abruptly announces to Cosette that they must leave for England. When Marius learns this, he visits his grandfather, Gillenormand, who detests his radical activities, to ask for money. Instead his grandfather suggests he make the woman he wants to marry his mistress and Marius, repulsed by the suggestion, leaves.\n\nThe radicals have created a barricade and are exchanging gunfire with the military. Gavroche identifies a man on the radical side of the barricade as the undercover police infiltrator, Javert. Enjolras arrests Javert and promises to shoot him if the barricade falls to the government's forces. Marius sends Gavroche with a message for Cosette, which Valjean reads. Valjean goes to the barricade and tries to talk Marius into abandoning the radicals. Gavroche is shot by the soldiers and dies. Valjean asks Enjolras for the privilege of killing Javert, which Enjolras grants him. Valjean instead releases him, repeating the words of the Bishop that his soul was once purchased for God. When Marius is wounded, Valjean escapes carrying his limp body him through the sewers. Javert pursues him there and confronts him about their earlier encounter. Javert prepares to kill Valjean but suddenly disappears into the darkness of the sewers. He commits suicide by jumping into the Seine. The film ends with the wedding of Cosette and Marius, attended only by Valjean and Gillenormand.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Richard Jordan]] as [[Jean Valjean]]\n* [[Anthony Perkins]] as [[Javert]]\n* [[Angela Pleasence]] as [[Fantine]]\n* [[Caroline Langrishe]] as [[Cosette]]\n** Joanna Price as young Cosette\n* [[Christopher Guard]] as [[Marius Pontmercy|Marius]]\n* [[Ian Holm]] as [[Th\u00e9nardiers|Th\u00e9nardier]]\n* [[Caroline Blakiston]] as [[Th\u00e9nardiers|Madame Th\u00e9nardier]]\n* Timothy Morand as [[Enjolras]]\n* [[Dexter Fletcher]] as [[Gavroche]]\n* [[Cyril Cusack]] as [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Fauchelevent]]\n* [[Claude Dauphin (actor)|Claude Dauphin]] as [[Bishop Myriel]]\n* [[John Gielgud]] as [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Gillenormand]]\n* [[Celia Johnson]] as [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Sister Simplice]]\n* [[Joyce Redman]] as [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Magliore]]\n* [[Flora Robson]] as [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|The Prioress]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Lynne Frederick]] heavily campaigned for the role of [[Cosette]].

The film was written by [[John Gay (screenwriter)|John Gay]], produced by [[Lew Grade]], and directed by [[Glenn Jordan]] (no relation to star Richard Jordan). The film originally aired on [[U.S.]] television on [[CBS]] on 27 December 1978.\n\n==Plot==\nThe plot follows the general outline of the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Plot|novel of the same name]], omitting many details and some entire episodes. The narrative is strictly chronological and avoids the digressions required to mirror the novel's structure. Many of the novel's minor characters do not appear or are combined. For example, the role of the Th\u00e9nardiers is reduced to a scene in which Valjean ransoms Cosette from them.\n\nThe film begins with Jean Valjean's theft and then lingers in the Toulon prison where his mistreatment is detailed under the gaze of Javert, who witnesses Valjean's amazing feat of strength in rescuing a man crushed under a boulder. Valjean escapes when saving another convict who had fallen while repairing some battlements. Struggling to survive, he encounters a kindly Bishop, who feeds and shelters him. He steals silver plates from the Bishop. When Valjean is arrested and brought back to the Bishop, the Bishop pretends the silver pieces were a gift, dismisses the police, and gives Valjean two silver candlesticks in addition to what he had originally stolen. Valjean is overcome. The Bishop tells him he has purchased his soul for God and that his life will now be different.\n\nValjean becomes a prosperous businessman using techniques for the manufacture of black beads that he learned in Toulon and becomes mayor of his town under the name Madeleine. Javert arrives to serve as chief of the local police. He thinks he recognizes Madeleine and notes his use of the Toulon manufacturing method. Madeleine rescues the beggar Fantine, who recounts her history in a few sentences, when Javert is about to punish her, and Javert witnesses Madeleine rescue a man trapped beneath a cart, another astonishing feat of strength. Javert denounces Madeleine to his superiors, but before they can confirm Madeleine is actually Valjean, another man is arrested and charged in Arras with being the escaped convict Valjean. Javert confesses his actions to Madeleine and asks to be dismissed from his position. Madeleine refuses his request and goes to Arras where he wins the release of the falsely accused man by identifying himself as Valjean.\n\nValjean returns to his town and tries to help the dying Fantine while he awaits arrest. He learns how the Th\u00e9nardiers are caring for her daughter Cosette. Javert insists on arresting him, Fantine dies, and Valjean escapes. He ransoms Cosette from the Th\u00e9nardiers and gives her a doll. Living in Paris with Cosette, Valjean escapes from Javert, who is directing police searches of the district where he is living, by climbing a wall, landing in the garden of a Paris convent. The gardener is the man he rescued from being crushed under a cart, who agrees to pretend he and Valjean are brothers and recommends him to the nuns as a gardener. Cosette attends the convent school. When she completes her education and has become a young woman, Valjean decides they should leave the convent's cloistered premises so she can experience the world.  \n\nValjean and Cosette are strolling in a public garden and pause to listen to radicals denounce the government. Cosette and Marius, one of the radical group though not a speaker, see one another and their eyes lock. Marius pays the urchin Gavroche to tail them and report their address to him. Marius soon romances Cosette through the entrance gate to their home. Valjean sees this and abruptly announces to Cosette that they must leave for England. When Marius learns this, he visits his grandfather, Gillenormand, who detests his radical activities, to ask for money. Instead his grandfather suggests he make the woman he wants to marry his mistress and Marius, repulsed by the suggestion, leaves.\n\nThe radicals have created a barricade and are exchanging gunfire with the military. Gavroche identifies a man on the radical side of the barricade as the undercover police infiltrator, Javert. Enjolras arrests Javert and promises to shoot him if the barricade falls to the government's forces. Marius sends Gavroche with a message for Cosette, which Valjean reads. Valjean goes to the barricade and tries to talk Marius into abandoning the radicals. Gavroche is shot by the soldiers and dies. Valjean asks Enjolras for the privilege of killing Javert, which Enjolras grants him. Valjean instead releases him, repeating the words of the Bishop that his soul was once purchased for God. When Marius is wounded, Valjean escapes carrying his limp body him through the sewers. Javert pursues him there and confronts him about their earlier encounter. Javert prepares to kill Valjean but suddenly disappears into the darkness of the sewers. He commits suicide by jumping into the Seine. The film ends with the wedding of Cosette and Marius, attended only by Valjean and Gillenormand.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Richard Jordan]] as [[Jean Valjean]]\n* [[Anthony Perkins]] as [[Javert]]\n* [[Angela Pleasence]] as [[Fantine]]\n* [[Caroline Langrishe]] as [[Cosette]]\n** Joanna Price as young Cosette\n* [[Christopher Guard]] as [[Marius Pontmercy|Marius]]\n* [[Ian Holm]] as [[Th\u00e9nardiers|Th\u00e9nardier]]\n* [[Caroline Blakiston]] as [[Th\u00e9nardiers|Madame Th\u00e9nardier]]\n* Timothy Morand as [[Enjolras]]\n* [[Dexter Fletcher]] as [[Gavroche]]\n* [[Cyril Cusack]] as [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Fauchelevent]]\n* [[Claude Dauphin (actor)|Claude Dauphin]] as [[Bishop Myriel]]\n* [[John Gielgud]] as [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Gillenormand]]\n* [[Celia Johnson]] as [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Sister Simplice]]\n* [[Joyce Redman]] as [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Magliore]]\n* [[Flora Robson]] as [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|The Prioress]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Lynne Frederick]] heavily campaigned for the role of [[Cosette]]. When she auditioned, she also read for the role of [[Fantine]]. She was ultimately deemed too old to play Cosette and too young to play Fantine.<ref>{{cite web |title=IMDb -  Les Miserables (1978 TV Movie) \u2014 Triva |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077936/trivia}}</ref>\n\nThe film was produced by [[Norman Rosemont]] who specialised in period adaptations of classic novels for television. He found it difficult to raise financing for the first few and spent two years raising the money for ''Les Miserables''. NBC turned it down out of fear Americans would not understand the title. Eventually money was raised from CBS and IBM.

A key event that gave the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] the confidence to arrest Blake came when a retired [[stuntman]], Ronald \"Duffy\" Hambleton, agreed to testify against him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/news/2002/0425/blake_ap.html |title=Stuntmen key witnesses vs. Blake |accessdate=2007-04-02 |date=2002-04-25 |work=Court TV Online |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929140152/http://www.courttv.com/archive/news/2002/0425/blake_ap.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 }}</ref> Hambleton alleged that Blake tried to [[contract killing|hire him]] to kill Bakley. Another retired stuntman and an associate of Hambleton's, [[Gary McLarty]], also came forward with a similar story.\n\nAccording to author Miles Corwin, Hambleton had agreed to testify against Blake only after being told that he would be subject to a [[grand jury]] [[subpoena]] and a [[misdemeanor]] charge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/blake/011905_ctv.html |title=Author: Police suspected Robert Blake hours after wife was slain |accessdate=2007-04-02 |last=Sweetingham |first=Lisa |date=2005-01-20 |work=Court TV Online |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134145/http://www.courttv.com/trials/blake/011905_ctv.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 }}</ref> Hambleton's motives for testifying were called into question by Blake's [[defense (law)|defense]] team during the trial.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sweetingham |first=Lisa |url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/blake/020105_ctv.html |title=Scene is set in Blake case; cue stuntmen |accessdate=2007-04-02 |date=2005-02-01 |work=Court TV Online |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101212508/http://www.courttv.com/trials/blake/020105_ctv.html |archivedate=2006-11-01 }}</ref>\n\nOn April 22, 2002, Blake was charged with one count of murder with [[special circumstances (criminal law)|special circumstances]], an offense which carried a possible [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]]. He was also charged with two counts of solicitation of murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. Blake entered a plea of not guilty to all charges. Caldwell was charged with a single count of conspiracy to commit murder and also entered a plea of not guilty. Three days later, the Los Angeles District Attorney's office announced that it would not seek the death penalty against Blake if he was convicted, but prosecutors would seek a sentence of [[life in prison]] without the possibility of [[parole]].\n\nBlake posted $1 million [[bail]] for Caldwell, who was released, but a judge denied bail for Blake himself. On March 13, 2003, after almost a year in jail, Blake was granted bail, which was set at $1.5 million, and he was allowed to go free to await trial. Blake was placed on [[house arrest]] during this time. On October 31, in a major reversal for the prosecution, the judge dismissed the conspiracy charge against Blake and Caldwell during a pre-trial hearing.<ref name=part8/> The junior prosecutor who handled the case, Shellie Samuels, was interviewed by CBS reporter [[Peter Van Sant]] for the CBS program ''[[48 Hours Investigates]]''. During the interview, broadcast in November 2003, she admitted that the prosecutors had no forensic evidence implicating Blake in the murder, that they could not tie him to the murder weapon, that they did not have any witnesses, and that they had virtually nothing in the way of hard evidence.<ref name=part8/>\n\n====Murder trial and acquittal====\n\nBlake's criminal trial for murder began on December 20, 2004 with [[opening statement]]s by the prosecution and opening statements by the defense the following day.<ref name=part8>{{cite web |title=The State v. Robert Blake |url=http://www.bakleymurder.com/part8.html}}</ref> The prosecution contended that Blake intentionally murdered Bakley to free himself from a loveless marriage, while the defense challenged all of the evidence, claiming that Blake was an innocent victim of circumstantial and fabricated evidence.\n\nProsecution testimony began with various witnesses detailing the night of the murder and the murder weapon used. Bakley was shot twice while sitting on the passenger side of the parked car and the passenger window was rolled down, indicating that she may have been familiar with her assailant. The murder weapon was revealed to be a semi-automatic [[Walther P38]] [[pistol]], which was found in a dumpster a few yards away from the parked car where the shooting took place.\n\nOn February 7, 2005, Gary McLarty alleged that in March 2001, Blake attempted to contract him to murder his wife; McLarty allegedly declined. McLarty's testimony was subject to an intense [[cross-examination]], which examined his history of mental problems and his difficulty remembering key details of the alleged contract offer. On February 9, testimony came from Ronald \"Duffy\" Hambleton, who also claimed that Blake tried to solicit him to murder his wife. His testimony was also called into question during cross-examination when his record of past convictions for various petty crimes including drug and gun possession was exposed.\n\nThe prosecution rested its case on February 14. The defense began its case with a series of witnesses, including relatives of McLarty, who contradicted various parts of the prosecution's case. On February 19, testimony was heard about the effects of chronic drug use on the mind\u2014specifically, the minds of the two key prosecution witnesses, Hambleton and McLarty, who were drug users during their stuntman careers. The lack of gunshot residue on Blake's hands was also a key part of the defense's case that Blake was not the shooter. Blake chose not to testify. The defense rested its case on February 23, and after closing arguments were made on March 2\u20133, the jury retired to deliberate on March 4.<ref>{{cite web |title=The State v. Robert Blake |url=http://www.bakleymurder.com/part9.html}}</ref>\n\nOn March 16, 2005, Blake was found not guilty of murder and not guilty of one of the two counts of solicitation of murder. The other count, the solicitation of McLarty, was dropped after it was revealed that the jury was deadlocked 11\u20131 in favor of an acquittal. Los Angeles District Attorney Stephen Cooley, commenting on this ruling, called Blake \"a miserable human being\" and the jurors \"incredibly stupid\" to fall for the defense's claims.<ref>{{cite web |title=Blake jurors want apology from D.A. |url=https://www.today.com/news/blake-jurors-want-apology-d-wbna7284990 |accessdate=2009-07-09 |date=2005-03-25 |work=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> Blake's defense team, led by attorney [[M.

He also sold drugs.<ref>The Robert Blake Interview [[Playboy Magazine]] (June 1977) </ref> Blake entered [[Jeff Corey]]'s acting class and began working on improving his personal and professional life. He eventually became a seasoned [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] actor, playing notable dramatic roles in movies and on television. In 1956, he was billed as Robert Blake for the first time.\n\nIn 1959, in what was considered a career blunder, Blake turned down the role of [[Little Joe (character)|Little Joe Cartwright]], a character ultimately portrayed by [[Michael Landon]], in [[NBC]]'s western television series ''[[Bonanza]].'' He did appear that year as Tobe Hackett in the episode \"Trade Me Deadly\" of the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] western series ''[[26 Men]],'' which dramatized true stories of the [[Arizona Rangers]]. Blake also appeared twice as \"Alfredo\" in the syndicated western ''[[The Cisco Kid (TV series)|The Cisco Kid]]'' and starred in \"The White Hat\" episode of ''[[Men of Annapolis]],'' another syndicated series. He appeared in three distinctive guest lead roles in the [[CBS]] series ''[[Have Gun Will Travel]]'', as well as one-time guest toles on [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]]'s NBC western ''[[The Restless Gun]]'', [[Nick Adams (actor, born 1931)|Nick Adams]]'s [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] western ''[[The Rebel (TV series)|The Rebel]]'', and in season 3, episode 25 of ''[[Bat Masterson]]'', the NBC western series ''[[The Californians (TV series)|The Californians]]'', the short lived ABC adventure series ''Straightaway'', and the NBC western television series ''[[Laramie (TV series)|Laramie]]''.\n\nBlake performed in numerous motion pictures as an adult, including the starring role in ''[[The Purple Gang]]'' (1960), a gangster movie, and featured roles in ''[[Pork Chop Hill]]'' (1959) and, as one of four U.S. soldiers participating in a gang rape in [[occupied Germany]], in ''[[Town Without Pity]]'' (1961). He was also in ''[[Ensign Pulver]]'' (1964), ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' (1965) and other films.\n\nBlake garnered further exposure as a member of the ensemble cast of the 1963 acclaimed but short-lived ''[[The Richard Boone Show]]'', appearing in fifteen of the NBC series' 25 episodes.  At 33, Blake played [[Billy the Kid]] in the 1966 episode \"The Kid from Hell's Kitchen\" of the syndicated western series ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', hosted by [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]]. In the story line, The Kid sets out to avenge the death of his friend [[John Tunstall]] played by [[John Anderson (actor)|John Anderson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556817/?ref_=tt_ep_nx|title=\"The Kid from Hell's Kitchen\" on ''Death Valley Days''|date=October 20, 1966|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, Blake experienced a career breakout playing real-life murderer [[Perry Smith (murderer)|Perry Smith]], to whom he bore a chilling resemblance, in ''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]''. [[Richard Brooks]] received two Oscar nominations for the film: one for his direction, and one for his adaptation of [[Truman Capote]]'s book.\n[[File:Robert Blake Baretta and Fred 1976.JPG|thumb|left|200px|As Baretta with Fred.]]\n\nBlake played a Native American fugitive in ''[[Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here]]'' (1969), starred in a [[TV movie]] adaptation of ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' (1981), and played a motorcycle highway patrolman in iconoclastic ''[[Electra Glide in Blue]]'' (1973). He played a small-town stock car driver with ambitions to join the [[NASCAR]] circuit in ''[[Corky (film)|Corky]], '' which MGM produced in 1972.

Blake starred in the 1985 television series ''[[Hell Town (TV series)|Hell Town]]'', playing a priest working in a tough neighborhood; and he also had character parts in the theatrical movies ''[[Money Train]]'' (1995) and played the chilling and sinister Mystery Man in [[David Lynch]]'s [[Lost Highway (film)|''Lost Highway'']] (1997).\n\n==Marriages and children==\nBlake and actress Sondra Kerr were married in 1961 and divorced in 1983. It was his first marriage, from which came two children: actor Noah Blake (born 1965) and Delinah Blake (born 1966).

Bakley was fatally shot in the head while sitting in Blake's vehicle, which was parked on a side street around the corner from the restaurant. Blake claimed that he had returned to the restaurant to collect a gun which he had previously left inside and claimed that he had not been present when the shooting took place. The gun Blake claimed to have left in the restaurant was later found and determined by police not to be the murder weapon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/family/bakley.htm/1l|publisher=[[truTV]]|title=Library}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn April 18, 2002, Blake was arrested and charged with Bakley's murder. His longtime bodyguard, Earle Caldwell, was also arrested and charged with [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] in connection with the murder. A key event that gave the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] the confidence to arrest Blake came when a retired [[stuntman]], Ronald \"Duffy\" Hambleton, agreed to testify against him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/news/2002/0425/blake_ap.html |title=Stuntmen key witnesses vs. Blake |accessdate=2007-04-02 |date=2002-04-25 |work=Court TV Online |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929140152/http://www.courttv.com/archive/news/2002/0425/blake_ap.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 }}</ref> Hambleton alleged that Blake tried to [[contract killing|hire him]] to kill Bakley. Another retired stuntman and an associate of Hambleton's, [[Gary McLarty]], also came forward with a similar story.\n\nAccording to author Miles Corwin, Hambleton had agreed to testify against Blake only after being told that he would be subject to a [[grand jury]] [[subpoena]] and a [[misdemeanor]] charge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/blake/011905_ctv.html |title=Author: Police suspected Robert Blake hours after wife was slain |accessdate=2007-04-02 |last=Sweetingham |first=Lisa |date=2005-01-20 |work=Court TV Online |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134145/http://www.courttv.com/trials/blake/011905_ctv.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 }}</ref> Hambleton's motives for testifying were called into question by Blake's [[defense (law)|defense]] team during the trial.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sweetingham |first=Lisa |url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/blake/020105_ctv.html |title=Scene is set in Blake case; cue stuntmen |accessdate=2007-04-02 |date=2005-02-01 |work=Court TV Online |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101212508/http://www.courttv.com/trials/blake/020105_ctv.html |archivedate=2006-11-01 }}</ref>\n\nOn April 22, 2002, Blake was charged with one count of murder with [[special circumstances (criminal law)|special circumstances]], an offense which carried a possible [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]]. He was also charged with two counts of solicitation of murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. Blake entered a plea of not guilty to all charges. Caldwell was charged with a single count of conspiracy to commit murder and also entered a plea of not guilty. Three days later, the Los Angeles District Attorney's office announced that it would not seek the death penalty against Blake if he was convicted, but prosecutors would seek a sentence of [[life in prison]] without the possibility of [[parole]].\n\nBlake posted $1 million [[bail]] for Caldwell, who was released, but a judge denied bail for Blake himself. On March 13, 2003, after almost a year in jail, Blake was granted bail, which was set at $1.5 million, and he was allowed to go free to await trial. Blake was placed on [[house arrest]] during this time. On October 31, in a major reversal for the prosecution, the judge dismissed the conspiracy charge against Blake and Caldwell during a pre-trial hearing.<ref name=part8/> The junior prosecutor who handled the case, Shellie Samuels, was interviewed by CBS reporter [[Peter Van Sant]] for the CBS program ''[[48 Hours Investigates]]''. During the interview, broadcast in November 2003, she admitted that the prosecutors had no forensic evidence implicating Blake in the murder, that they could not tie him to the murder weapon, that they did not have any witnesses, and that they had virtually nothing in the way of hard evidence.<ref name=part8/>\n\n====Murder trial and acquittal====\n\nBlake's criminal trial for murder began on December 20, 2004 with [[opening statement]]s by the prosecution and opening statements by the defense the following day.<ref name=part8>{{cite web |title=The State v. Robert Blake |url=http://www.bakleymurder.com/part8.html}}</ref> The prosecution contended that Blake intentionally murdered Bakley to free himself from a loveless marriage, while the defense challenged all of the evidence, claiming that Blake was an innocent victim of circumstantial and fabricated evidence.\n\nProsecution testimony began with various witnesses detailing the night of the murder and the murder weapon used. Bakley was shot twice while sitting on the passenger side of the parked car and the passenger window was rolled down, indicating that she may have been familiar with her assailant. The murder weapon was revealed to be a semi-automatic [[Walther P38]] [[pistol]], which was found in a dumpster a few yards away from the parked car where the shooting took place.\n\nOn February 7, 2005, Gary McLarty alleged that in March 2001, Blake attempted to contract him to murder his wife; McLarty allegedly declined. McLarty's testimony was subject to an intense [[cross-examination]], which examined his history of mental problems and his difficulty remembering key details of the alleged contract offer. On February 9, testimony came from Ronald \"Duffy\" Hambleton, who also claimed that Blake tried to solicit him to murder his wife. His testimony was also called into question during cross-examination when his record of past convictions for various petty crimes including drug and gun possession was exposed.\n\nThe prosecution rested its case on February 14. The defense began its case with a series of witnesses, including relatives of McLarty, who contradicted various parts of the prosecution's case. On February 19, testimony was heard about the effects of chronic drug use on the mind\u2014specifically, the minds of the two key prosecution witnesses, Hambleton and McLarty, who were drug users during their stuntman careers. The lack of gunshot residue on Blake's hands was also a key part of the defense's case that Blake was not the shooter. Blake chose not to testify. The defense rested its case on February 23, and after closing arguments were made on March 2\u20133, the jury retired to deliberate on March 4.<ref>{{cite web |title=The State v. Robert Blake |url=http://www.bakleymurder.com/part9.html}}</ref>\n\nOn March 16, 2005, Blake was found not guilty of murder and not guilty of one of the two counts of solicitation of murder. The other count, the solicitation of McLarty, was dropped after it was revealed that the jury was deadlocked 11\u20131 in favor of an acquittal. Los Angeles District Attorney Stephen Cooley, commenting on this ruling, called Blake \"a miserable human being\" and the jurors \"incredibly stupid\" to fall for the defense's claims.<ref>{{cite web |title=Blake jurors want apology from D.A. |url=https://www.today.com/news/blake-jurors-want-apology-d-wbna7284990 |accessdate=2009-07-09 |date=2005-03-25 |work=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> Blake's defense team, led by attorney [[M.

[[Pompeii]] is Italy's third and the world's 48th most visited destination, with over 2.5 million tourists a year.]]\n===Beginnings===\n\nPeople have visited Italy for centuries, yet the first to visit the peninsula for touristic reasons were aristocrats during the [[Grand Tour]], beginning in the late 17th century, and flourishing in the 18th century.\n\n[[Rome]], as the capital of the powerful and influential [[Roman Empire]], attracted thousands to the city and country from all over the empire, which included most of the Mediterranean, Northern Africa, mainland Great Britain (England) and the parts of the Middle East. Traders and merchants came to Italy from several different parts of the world.\nWhen the empire fell in 476 AD, Rome was no longer the epicentre of European politics and culture; on the other hand, it was the base of the [[papacy]], which then governed the growing [[Christianity|Christian]] religion, meaning that Rome remained one of Europe's major places of pilgrimage. Pilgrims, for centuries and still today, would come to the city, and that would have been the early equivalent of \"tourism\" or \"religious tourism\". The trade empires of Venice, Pisa and Genoa meant that several traders, businessmen and merchants from all over the world would also regularly come to Italy. In the 16th and early 17th century, with the height of the Renaissance, several students came to Italy to study Italian architecture, such as [[Inigo Jones]].\n\n===Grand Tour===\n{{main|Grand Tour}}\nReal \"tourism\" only affected in Italy in the second half of the 17th century, with the beginning of the [[Grand Tour]]. This was a period in which European aristocrats, many of whom were British, visited parts of Europe; Italy, Greece and other Mediterranean places were amongst the most popular. This was in order to study ancient architecture and the local culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/grand_tour/what.html|title=Italy on the Grand Tour (Getty Exhibitions)|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> The Grand Tour was in essence triggered by the book ''Voyage to Italy'', by Roman Catholic priest Richard Lassels, and published in 1670.<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://vasi.uoregon.edu/grandtour.html|title=18th Century Rome and the Grand Tour|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/historyofgeography/a/grandtour.htm|title=The History of the Grand Tour of Europe|author=Matt Rosenberg|work=About.com Education|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref>\nDue to the Grand Tour, tourism became even more prevalent  - making Italy one of the most desired destinations for millions of people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Changing Mobilities|last=Hom|first=Stephanie|publisher=London:Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781138778146|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Once inside what would be modern-day Italy, these tourists would begin by visiting Turin for a short while. On the way there, Milan was also a popular stop, yet a trip to the city was not considered essential, and several passed by, or simply stayed for a short period of time. If a person came via boat, then they would remain a few days in Genoa. Yet, the main destination in Northern Italy was Venice, which was considered a vital stop,<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\" /> as well as cities around it such as Verona, Vicenza and Padua.\n\nAs the Tour went on, Tuscan cities were also very important itinerary stops. Florence was a major attraction, and other Tuscan towns, such as Siena, Pisa, Lucca and San Gimignano, were also considered important destinations. The most prominent stop in Central Italy, however, was Rome, a major centre for the arts and culture, as well as an essential city for a Grand Tourist.<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\" /> Later, they would go down to the Bay of [[Naples]],<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\" /> and after their discovery in 1710, [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] were popular too. Sicily was considered a significant part of the trail, and several, such as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], visited the island.\n\n===Mass tourism===\n[[File:L'aquila03.jpg|thumb|left|Cathedral of [[L'Aquila]]]][[File:Ravello.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Amalfi Coast]] seen from [[Villa Cimbrone]], in [[Ravello]], [[Campania]], one of the most popular tourist destinations in Italy.]]\nThroughout the 17th to 18th centuries, the Grand Tour was mainly reserved for academics or the elite. Nevertheless, circa 1840,<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\"/> rail transport was introduced and the Grand Tour started to fall slightly out of vogue; hence, the first form of mass-tourism was introduced. The 1840s saw the period in which the Victorian middle classes toured the country. Several Americans were also able to visit Italy, and many more tourists came to the peninsula. Places such as Venice, Florence, Rome, Naples and Sicily still remained the top attractions.\nAs the century progressed, fewer cultural visits were made, and there was an increase of tourists coming for Italy's nature and weather. The first seaside resorts, such as those in the Ligurian coast, around Venice, coastal Tuscany and Amalfi, became popular. This vogue of summer holidays heightened in the [[fin-de-si\u00e8cle]] epoch, when numerous \"Grand Hotels\" were built (including places such as [[Sanremo]], [[Lido di Venezia]], [[Viareggio]] and [[Forte dei Marmi]]). Islands such as Capri, Ischia, Procida and Elba grew in popularity, and the Northern lakes, such as Lake Como, Maggiore and Garda were more frequently visited. Tourism to Italy remained very popular until the late-1920s and early-1930s, when, with the Great Depression and economic crisis, several could no longer afford to visit the country; the increasing political instability meant that fewer tourists came. Only old touristic groups, such as [[the Scorpioni]], remained alive.\n[[File:Vatican-Mass-Tourism-2012.JPG|right|thumb|Mass tourism, the crowd inside the Saint Peter's Basilica (Rome)]]\nAfter a big slump in tourism beginning from approximately 1929 and lasting after [[World War II]], Italy returned to its status as a popular resort, with the [[Italian economic miracle]] and raised living standards; films such as ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' were successful abroad, and their depiction of the country's perceivedly idyllic life helped raise Italy's international profile. By this point, with higher incomes, Italians could also afford to go on holiday; coastline resorts saw a soar in visitors, especially in Romagna. Many cheap hotels and ''pensioni'' (hostels) were built in the 1960s, and with the rise of wealth, by now, even a working-class Italian family could afford a holiday somewhere along the coast. The late-1960s also brought mass-popularity to mountain holidays and skiing; in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley, numerous ski resorts and chalets started being built. The 1970s also brought a wave of foreign tourists to Italy in search of a sentimental trip [https://www.academia.edu/7961209/Villoresi_old_charm_-The_Trip_to_Italy Villoresi old charm -The Trip to Italy], since Mediterranean destinations saw a rise in global visitors.\n\nDespite this, by the late-1970s and early-1980s, economic crises and political instability meant that there was a significant slump in the Italian tourist industry, as destinations in the Far East or South America rose in popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/297474/Italy#|title=Italy|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> Yet, by the late-1980s and early-1990s, tourism saw a return to popularity, with cities such as Milan becoming more popular destinations. Milan saw a rise in tourists, since it was ripening its position as a worldwide [[fashion capital]].\n\n== Statistics ==\nThe table below shows the distribution of national and international visitor nights spent in the 40 most tourist area of Italy in 2017. \n\nItaly overall had 420.63 million visitor nights in 2017, of which 210.66 million were of foreign guests (50.08 percent).

[[Pompeii]] is Italy's third and the world's 48th most visited destination, with over 2.5 million tourists a year.]]\n===Beginnings===\n\nPeople have visited Italy for centuries, yet the first to visit the peninsula for touristic reasons were aristocrats during the Grand Tour, beginning in the late 17th century, and flourishing in the 18th century.\n\n[[Rome]], as the capital of the powerful and influential [[Roman Empire]], attracted thousands to the city and country from all over the empire, which included most of the Mediterranean, Northern Africa, mainland Great Britain (England) and the parts of the Middle East. Traders and merchants came to Italy from several different parts of the world.\nWhen the empire fell in 476 AD, Rome was no longer the epicentre of European politics and culture; on the other hand, it was the base of the [[papacy]], which then governed the growing [[Christianity|Christian]] religion, meaning that Rome remained one of Europe's major places of pilgrimage. Pilgrims, for centuries and still today, would come to the city, and that would have been the early equivalent of \"tourism\" or \"religious tourism\". The trade empires of Venice, Pisa and Genoa meant that several traders, businessmen and merchants from all over the world would also regularly come to Italy. In the 16th and early 17th century, with the height of the Renaissance, several students came to Italy to study Italian architecture, such as [[Inigo Jones]].\n\n===Grand Tour===\n{{main|Grand Tour}}\nReal \"tourism\" only affected in Italy in the second half of the 17th century, with the beginning of the [[Grand Tour]]. This was a period in which European aristocrats, many of whom were British, visited parts of Europe; Italy, Greece and other Mediterranean places were amongst the most popular. This was in order to study ancient architecture and the local culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/grand_tour/what.html|title=Italy on the Grand Tour (Getty Exhibitions)|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> The Grand Tour was in essence triggered by the book ''Voyage to Italy'', by Roman Catholic priest Richard Lassels, and published in 1670.<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://vasi.uoregon.edu/grandtour.html|title=18th Century Rome and the Grand Tour|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/historyofgeography/a/grandtour.htm|title=The History of the Grand Tour of Europe|author=Matt Rosenberg|work=About.com Education|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref>\nDue to the Grand Tour, tourism became even more prevalent  - making Italy one of the most desired destinations for millions of people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Changing Mobilities|last=Hom|first=Stephanie|publisher=London:Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781138778146|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Once inside what would be modern-day Italy, these tourists would begin by visiting Turin for a short while. On the way there, Milan was also a popular stop, yet a trip to the city was not considered essential, and several passed by, or simply stayed for a short period of time. If a person came via boat, then they would remain a few days in Genoa. Yet, the main destination in Northern Italy was Venice, which was considered a vital stop,<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\" /> as well as cities around it such as Verona, Vicenza and Padua.\n\nAs the Tour went on, Tuscan cities were also very important itinerary stops. Florence was a major attraction, and other Tuscan towns, such as Siena, Pisa, Lucca and San Gimignano, were also considered important destinations. The most prominent stop in Central Italy, however, was Rome, a major centre for the arts and culture, as well as an essential city for a Grand Tourist.<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\" /> Later, they would go down to the Bay of [[Naples]],<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\" /> and after their discovery in 1710, [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] were popular too. Sicily was considered a significant part of the trail, and several, such as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], visited the island.\n\n===Mass tourism===\n[[File:L'aquila03.jpg|thumb|left|Cathedral of [[L'Aquila]]]][[File:Ravello.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Amalfi Coast]] seen from [[Villa Cimbrone]], in [[Ravello]], [[Campania]], one of the most popular tourist destinations in Italy.]]\nThroughout the 17th to 18th centuries, the Grand Tour was mainly reserved for academics or the elite. Nevertheless, circa 1840,<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\"/> rail transport was introduced and the Grand Tour started to fall slightly out of vogue; hence, the first form of mass-tourism was introduced. The 1840s saw the period in which the Victorian middle classes toured the country. Several Americans were also able to visit Italy, and many more tourists came to the peninsula. Places such as Venice, Florence, Rome, Naples and Sicily still remained the top attractions.\nAs the century progressed, fewer cultural visits were made, and there was an increase of tourists coming for Italy's nature and weather. The first seaside resorts, such as those in the Ligurian coast, around Venice, coastal Tuscany and Amalfi, became popular. This vogue of summer holidays heightened in the [[fin-de-si\u00e8cle]] epoch, when numerous \"Grand Hotels\" were built (including places such as [[Sanremo]], [[Lido di Venezia]], [[Viareggio]] and [[Forte dei Marmi]]). Islands such as Capri, Ischia, Procida and Elba grew in popularity, and the Northern lakes, such as Lake Como, Maggiore and Garda were more frequently visited. Tourism to Italy remained very popular until the late-1920s and early-1930s, when, with the Great Depression and economic crisis, several could no longer afford to visit the country; the increasing political instability meant that fewer tourists came. Only old touristic groups, such as [[the Scorpioni]], remained alive.\n[[File:Vatican-Mass-Tourism-2012.JPG|right|thumb|Mass tourism, the crowd inside the Saint Peter's Basilica (Rome)]]\nAfter a big slump in tourism beginning from approximately 1929 and lasting after [[World War II]], Italy returned to its status as a popular resort, with the [[Italian economic miracle]] and raised living standards; films such as ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' were successful abroad, and their depiction of the country's perceivedly idyllic life helped raise Italy's international profile. By this point, with higher incomes, Italians could also afford to go on holiday; coastline resorts saw a soar in visitors, especially in Romagna. Many cheap hotels and ''pensioni'' (hostels) were built in the 1960s, and with the rise of wealth, by now, even a working-class Italian family could afford a holiday somewhere along the coast. The late-1960s also brought mass-popularity to mountain holidays and skiing; in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley, numerous ski resorts and chalets started being built. The 1970s also brought a wave of foreign tourists to Italy in search of a sentimental trip [https://www.academia.edu/7961209/Villoresi_old_charm_-The_Trip_to_Italy Villoresi old charm -The Trip to Italy], since Mediterranean destinations saw a rise in global visitors.\n\nDespite this, by the late-1970s and early-1980s, economic crises and political instability meant that there was a significant slump in the Italian tourist industry, as destinations in the Far East or South America rose in popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/297474/Italy#|title=Italy|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> Yet, by the late-1980s and early-1990s, tourism saw a return to popularity, with cities such as Milan becoming more popular destinations.

with Francis Thingshooter, Prohyas and Vambre start thinking that maybe it is not fair to leave their friends out of their adventures. Omnibus then gives the Warriors a task: to find him a dinosaur that is believed to not exist called the Stegaroptorix. The Warriors see this as an opportunity to bring their friends Witchy Simone and Noville on a mission with them to Dinosaur Island. Through all the attempts to enlighten them, they don't seem to care much for it. Eventually King Rexxtopher catches the Warriors, saying they shouldn't be here, the Warriors (along with Simone and Noville) then decide to fight King Rexxtopher's team of dinosaurs. After the battle, the rare dinosaur runs into the forest, seeing this as an opportunity for a great adventure. When apparently nothing seems to interest them, Prohyas brings out a special guest star: Rad from ''[[OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes]]''. When they still seem uninterested, the Warriors bring the forest trees to life to trap Witchy Simone and Noville. When they find out that the reason they've been trying to leave and not caring is because they have their own lives now, Noville with a girlfriend and Witchy Simone with her job. They realize this and feel bad. Then Mr. Spoony arrives and saves them, they all decide to battle off the evil trees. Rad is given his own Magisword (a Magisword resembling K.O.'s hand that shoots Pow Cards). Eventually the Warriors apologize, but it annoys everyone. Prohyas and Vambre teaming up will not destroy every evil tree in the forest. The series concludes with the Warriors riding on the Stegoroptorix to Omnibus' house.\n| Viewers=0.18<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-friday-cable-originals-network-finals-5-17-2019.html|title=Top 150 Friday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 5.17.2019|author=Mitch Metcalf|work=Showbuzz Daily|date=May 20, 2019|accessdate=May 20, 2019}}</ref>\n| LineColor=00BA85\n}}\n}}\n\n==Digital shorts series==\n===Series 1 (2015)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n!

Eventually King Rexxtopher catches the Warriors, saying they shouldn't be here, the Warriors (along with Simone and Noville) then decide to fight King Rexxtopher's team of dinosaurs. After the battle, the rare dinosaur runs into the forest, seeing this as an opportunity for a great adventure. When apparently nothing seems to interest them, Prohyas brings out a special guest star: Rad from ''[[OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes]]''. When they still seem uninterested, the Warriors bring the forest trees to life to trap Witchy Simone and Noville. When they find out that the reason they've been trying to leave and not caring is because they have their own lives now, Noville with a girlfriend and Witchy Simone with her job. They realize this and feel bad. Then Mr. Spoony arrives and saves them, they all decide to battle off the evil trees. Rad is given his own Magisword (a Magisword resembling K.O.'s hand that shoots Pow Cards). Eventually the Warriors apologize, but it annoys everyone. Prohyas and Vambre teaming up will not destroy every evil tree in the forest. The series concludes with the Warriors riding on the Stegoroptorix to Omnibus' house.\n| Viewers=0.18<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-friday-cable-originals-network-finals-5-17-2019.html|title=Top 150 Friday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 5.17.2019|author=Mitch Metcalf|work=Showbuzz Daily|date=May 20, 2019|accessdate=May 20, 2019}}</ref>\n| LineColor=00BA85\n}}\n}}\n\n==Digital shorts series==\n===Series 1 (2015)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n!
