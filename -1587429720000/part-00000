It is produced by [[Bhushan Kumar]], [[Krishan Kumar (actor)|Krishan Kumar]] and Lizelle D'Souza under the banners [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]] and Remo D'Souza Entertainment. The film stars [[Varun Dhawan]], [[Shraddha Kapoor]], [[Prabhu Deva]] and [[Nora Fatehi]]. Its music is composed by [[Sachin\u2013Jigar]], [[Tanishk Bagchi]], [[Badshah (rapper)|Badshah]], [[Guru Randhawa]], Gurinder Seagal and Harsh Upadhyay, and released under the banner T-Series. The story explores a dance competition between some [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] dancers.\n\nOriginally planned as a sequel to Disney's ''[[ABCD 2]]'' (2015), the film was taken off the title due to Disney's exit from Indian film production, and was instead renamed to its current title after Bhushan Kumar took over as producer. Filming commenced in February 2019 in [[Punjab]], later moved to [[London]] and was wrapped up in July 2019. It was theatrically released in India on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nInder Singh Narula ([[Punit Pathak]]) is a dancer who is part of a dance team named Street Dancer. Inder is dancing at the Ground Zero Battle with his brother Sahej Singh Narula ([[Varun Dhawan]]) cheering for him and while doing a flip stunt, he lands on his leg and injures it. After two years, he is healing, but cannot dance. Sahej forms Street Dancer again and converts it into a studio through money whose sources he is hesitant about revealing. Poddy ([[Raghav Juyal]]), is one of Sahej's close friends, along with D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) and Sushi (Sushant Pujari), who are all part of Street Dancer. While showing the dance studio to the Street Dancer team, they run into Inayat ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) and her team, the Rule Breakers, dance as well. Sahej and Inayat have always been at standstills against each other and they have a dance battle. The Rule Breakers beat Street Dancer, embarrassing Sahej in the process. Inayat's cousin, Zain ([[Salman Yusuff Khan]]), takes her home. Their family is very orthodox and Inayat lies about her dancing, hiding the truth from them. \n\nSahej visits the Royals, an all time, record-holding dance group that always wins the Ground Zero Competition. His girlfriend, Mia ([[Nora Fatehi]]) is on the team, and she is an incredible dancer. They discuss on how irritated Sahej is by Inayat, and she calms him down. Mia trains the Street Dancer gang, giving them the spark they wanted. The two gangs meet up in a restaurant for a cricket match between India (Sahej's team) and Pakistan (Inayat's team). India wins and this leads to a dance battle where Mia shows her moves. The police and the restaurant manager, Ram Prasad a.k.a. Anna ([[Prabhu Deva]]) control the fight. As they leave, Inayat sees some homeless people entering the restaurant from the back door. She follows them and meets Ram. He explains to her that these are illegal immigrants, and he feeds them food that isn't used. He takes her to an area where many illegal immigrants reside. He tells her that they can't go back to their home as they have no money. She gets emotional and begins to help them.\n\nOne day when Poddy reaches the dance studio, he sees Sahej being interrogated by the cop. Sahej reveals that when he went to India for his cousin's marriage, he met Amrinder Mehrotra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and his three other friends playing drum in the marriage. He was impressed by their talent. They request Sahej to take them to London which he denies. After they offer a huge amount of 40 lakhs he agrees to take them to London. That's how he got the money to buy the dance studio. Poddy promises to not tell it to anyone.\n\nThe Ground Zero Battle returns. Inder asks Sahej to participate and win it. Inayat decides to participate so that they can use the money to help the illegal immigrants and Ram supports her. The two gangs meet and Ram says that if they become one they can easily win the competition. But both of them deny the offer. Sahej impresses the Royals with his dance at a nightclub. He, D, Poddy and Sushi are selected for the Royals. The two gangs meet in the restaurant again. They have an argument, which ends up with Ram dancing, showcasing his ability to Sahej. Sahej, blinded by his ego, turns down the opportunity. Poddy is in a relationship with Alisha, a girl from Inayat's gang. He realises that Inayat's gang are participating in the Ground Zero Battle so that they can retrieve them the prize money  which is a hundred thousand pounds to help illegal immigrants and tells Sahej about it at the Royals dance studio. Sahej does not believe Poddy and a fight ensues between the both of them. This causes Poddy to leave the Royals and he decides to join the Rule Breakers. Inayat accepts Poddy into the team and other members of the Street Dancer team also feel left out as Sahej spends his time with the Royals. \n\nThe first round of the competition is easily surpassed by both the Royals and the Rule Breakers. As Sahej, D and Shushi gets into a bus, they run into Amrinder. Amrinder tells Sahej that after he dropped them off, they went to a hostel. Over there, all illegal immigrants were staying and they were chased by the police. Leaving his identity as a Sikh and his passport, he and the three Punjabi drummers joined the homeless people. Inayat's gang were dancing to help them. He asks Sahej for help but he leaves saying he does not know him.\n\nBoth teams surpass the quarter finals and enter into semi finals. Later, the Royals and Sahej are walking in London. They run into the drummers where the leader of the Royals accidentally breaks his drums. After seeing them, Sahej feels guilty of his deeds. In the semi final round, Sahej leaves the Royals and helps Inayat's gang win the round. He then quits the Royals, breaking Mia\u2019s heart, and forms Street Dancer again.\n\nMany practices occur, and then Inayat's family finds out about her dancing actions. They ban her from dancing, shocking the team. Sahej and Zain go to her house, and convince her family to let her dance. A relationship blossoms between Sahej and Inayat as they prepare for the final round of the Ground Zero Battle. The Royals perform and amazes the crowd. Street Dancer performs and in the middle of their dance, a member of the Royals take off the music. The host tells them that if there is no music, they cannot dance. Amrinder then uses his drums with his friends to make music for them to dance to. The leader of the Royals finds out that his team member took off the music and he asks to puts it back in, since he did not want to cheat. At the end of their dance, Sahej does the flip stunt, which got his brother injured, flawlessly. Making his brother and his country proud, Sahej gets Street Dancer to defeat the Royals and wins the competition, also earning the Royals\u2019 respect. In the end, Sahej and Inayat begin a friendship as they help the immigrants.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Varun Dhawan]] as Sahej Singh Narula, an aspiring dancer who follows his brother's footsteps.

Its music is composed by [[Sachin\u2013Jigar]], [[Tanishk Bagchi]], [[Badshah (rapper)|Badshah]], [[Guru Randhawa]], Gurinder Seagal and Harsh Upadhyay, and released under the banner T-Series. The story explores a dance competition between some [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] dancers.\n\nOriginally planned as a sequel to Disney's ''[[ABCD 2]]'' (2015), the film was taken off the title due to Disney's exit from Indian film production, and was instead renamed to its current title after Bhushan Kumar took over as producer. Filming commenced in February 2019 in [[Punjab]], later moved to [[London]] and was wrapped up in July 2019. It was theatrically released in India on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nInder Singh Narula ([[Punit Pathak]]) is a dancer who is part of a dance team named Street Dancer. Inder is dancing at the Ground Zero Battle with his brother Sahej Singh Narula ([[Varun Dhawan]]) cheering for him and while doing a flip stunt, he lands on his leg and injures it. After two years, he is healing, but cannot dance. Sahej forms Street Dancer again and converts it into a studio through money whose sources he is hesitant about revealing. Poddy ([[Raghav Juyal]]), is one of Sahej's close friends, along with D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) and Sushi (Sushant Pujari), who are all part of Street Dancer. While showing the dance studio to the Street Dancer team, they run into Inayat ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) and her team, the Rule Breakers, dance as well. Sahej and Inayat have always been at standstills against each other and they have a dance battle. The Rule Breakers beat Street Dancer, embarrassing Sahej in the process. Inayat's cousin, Zain ([[Salman Yusuff Khan]]), takes her home. Their family is very orthodox and Inayat lies about her dancing, hiding the truth from them. \n\nSahej visits the Royals, an all time, record-holding dance group that always wins the Ground Zero Competition. His girlfriend, Mia ([[Nora Fatehi]]) is on the team, and she is an incredible dancer. They discuss on how irritated Sahej is by Inayat, and she calms him down. Mia trains the Street Dancer gang, giving them the spark they wanted. The two gangs meet up in a restaurant for a cricket match between India (Sahej's team) and Pakistan (Inayat's team). India wins and this leads to a dance battle where Mia shows her moves. The police and the restaurant manager, Ram Prasad a.k.a. Anna ([[Prabhu Deva]]) control the fight. As they leave, Inayat sees some homeless people entering the restaurant from the back door. She follows them and meets Ram. He explains to her that these are illegal immigrants, and he feeds them food that isn't used. He takes her to an area where many illegal immigrants reside. He tells her that they can't go back to their home as they have no money. She gets emotional and begins to help them.\n\nOne day when Poddy reaches the dance studio, he sees Sahej being interrogated by the cop. Sahej reveals that when he went to India for his cousin's marriage, he met Amrinder Mehrotra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and his three other friends playing drum in the marriage. He was impressed by their talent. They request Sahej to take them to London which he denies. After they offer a huge amount of 40 lakhs he agrees to take them to London. That's how he got the money to buy the dance studio. Poddy promises to not tell it to anyone.\n\nThe Ground Zero Battle returns. Inder asks Sahej to participate and win it. Inayat decides to participate so that they can use the money to help the illegal immigrants and Ram supports her. The two gangs meet and Ram says that if they become one they can easily win the competition. But both of them deny the offer. Sahej impresses the Royals with his dance at a nightclub. He, D, Poddy and Sushi are selected for the Royals. The two gangs meet in the restaurant again. They have an argument, which ends up with Ram dancing, showcasing his ability to Sahej. Sahej, blinded by his ego, turns down the opportunity. Poddy is in a relationship with Alisha, a girl from Inayat's gang. He realises that Inayat's gang are participating in the Ground Zero Battle so that they can retrieve them the prize money  which is a hundred thousand pounds to help illegal immigrants and tells Sahej about it at the Royals dance studio. Sahej does not believe Poddy and a fight ensues between the both of them. This causes Poddy to leave the Royals and he decides to join the Rule Breakers. Inayat accepts Poddy into the team and other members of the Street Dancer team also feel left out as Sahej spends his time with the Royals. \n\nThe first round of the competition is easily surpassed by both the Royals and the Rule Breakers. As Sahej, D and Shushi gets into a bus, they run into Amrinder. Amrinder tells Sahej that after he dropped them off, they went to a hostel. Over there, all illegal immigrants were staying and they were chased by the police. Leaving his identity as a Sikh and his passport, he and the three Punjabi drummers joined the homeless people. Inayat's gang were dancing to help them. He asks Sahej for help but he leaves saying he does not know him.\n\nBoth teams surpass the quarter finals and enter into semi finals. Later, the Royals and Sahej are walking in London. They run into the drummers where the leader of the Royals accidentally breaks his drums. After seeing them, Sahej feels guilty of his deeds. In the semi final round, Sahej leaves the Royals and helps Inayat's gang win the round. He then quits the Royals, breaking Mia\u2019s heart, and forms Street Dancer again.\n\nMany practices occur, and then Inayat's family finds out about her dancing actions. They ban her from dancing, shocking the team. Sahej and Zain go to her house, and convince her family to let her dance. A relationship blossoms between Sahej and Inayat as they prepare for the final round of the Ground Zero Battle. The Royals perform and amazes the crowd. Street Dancer performs and in the middle of their dance, a member of the Royals take off the music. The host tells them that if there is no music, they cannot dance. Amrinder then uses his drums with his friends to make music for them to dance to. The leader of the Royals finds out that his team member took off the music and he asks to puts it back in, since he did not want to cheat. At the end of their dance, Sahej does the flip stunt, which got his brother injured, flawlessly. Making his brother and his country proud, Sahej gets Street Dancer to defeat the Royals and wins the competition, also earning the Royals\u2019 respect. In the end, Sahej and Inayat begin a friendship as they help the immigrants.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Varun Dhawan]] as Sahej Singh Narula, an aspiring dancer who follows his brother's footsteps.

The road then descended the other side of the hill towards the town centre passing west of the [[Morden tube station|Underground station]] and crossing the north corner of [[Morden Hall Park]] heading in the direction of [[Colliers Wood]] and [[Tooting]].

While the population of [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] grew hugely from 1,591 in 1801 to 41,652 in 1901, the population of Morden was 512 in 1801 and, one hundred years later, had grown to just 960.<ref name = census>UK Census records</ref>\n\nIn 1871, the area of the parish of Morden was {{convert|1474.926|acre|km2|3}}<ref name = os_1871>[[Ordnance Survey]] map, 1871 edition</ref> with the small village clustered around [[St Lawrence Church, Morden|St Lawrence's church]] at the top of the hill on the road from London to [[Epsom]] (now London Road/Epsom Road). Approximately half a mile to the west of the main village and the grounds of [[Morden Park]] stood the hamlet of [[Lower Morden]].\n\nClose to the church were the George Inn, a 17th-century [[coaching inn]] (now modernised and part of a national pub restaurant chain), the estate of [[Morden Park]] and a school.\n\nThe other main public house in the village was the Crown Inn, located to the north east of the village with a small cluster of cottages on Crown Road. The rest of what is now the commercial centre of Morden was fields.\n\nIn the late 19th century the principal industry remained agriculture, although some industrial activity did exist along the [[River Wandle]] where [[watermill]]s ground tobacco to [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] and a varnish works existed close to the site of Poplar Primary School. By 1898, the varnish works had gone and there was a [[brickworks]]<ref name = os_1898>Ordnance Survey map, 1898 edition</ref> on the site of Mostyn Gardens in Martin Way (then called Green Lane).<ref name = os_1898/>\n\n===20th century===\nUnder the [[Local Government Act 1894|Local Government Act, 1894]], the parish of Morden formed part of the [[Croydon Rural District]] of [[Surrey]]. The first two decades of the 20th century saw little change in the village, with industry still mainly agricultural in nature; however development in the parish of [[Merton (historic parish)|Merton]] to the north led to that area being removed from the [[rural district]] to form the [[Merton Urban District]] in 1907. Morden was merged with the Merton Urban District, in 1913, to form the [[Merton and Morden Urban District]].<ref name = vob>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10036574 VisionofBritain.org.uk]</ref> It was not, until 1926, when [[Morden tube station|Morden Underground station]] opened as the terminus of a new extension of the [[City & South London Railway]] (now part of the [[London Underground]]'s [[Northern line]]), that the fast and direct route to Central [[London]] opened up the village for residential development.\n\nTo complement the new station, a garage was constructed on the other side of London Road, adjacent to the railway cutting and, in 1932, Morden Cinema was built next to it on the corner of Aberconway Road. Around the station a new commercial centre grew quickly as shops sprang up along London Road and Crown Lane, including a rebuilt and enlarged Crown public house (opened in 1932)<ref name=my_merton>[http://www.merton.gov.uk/my_merton_17_lr.pdf my merton, issue 17, June-July 2006, p. 17]</ref> and a large [[Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society]] (RACS) department store (opened in 1940).<ref name=my_merton/>\n\nAway from the new commercial centre of Morden, the existing rural roads were widened and rebuilt and the fields were rapidly divided into building plots and laid out for new housing.  Further transport improvements came with the construction of a new [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] branch line [[Wimbledon and Sutton Railway|from Wimbledon to Sutton]] via stations at [[South Merton railway station|South Merton]] and [[Morden South railway station|Morden South]] (so named to differentiate it from [[Morden tube station|Morden Underground Station]] and [[Morden Road tram stop|Morden Station]] (now Morden Road tram stop), although it was actually north east of the original village centre). The new line opened in January 1930. As a result of the new transport links, the population of Morden increased rapidly from 1,355 in 1921 to 12,618 in 1931. In the next fifteen years, the population continued to grow, as most of the parish was covered in new [[suburban]] homes.\n\nOne of the main residential developments in the 1930s was the [[St. Helier, London|St. Helier]] estate, built by the [[London County Council]] (LCC) to house workers from Inner London and named in honour of Lady St. Helier, an [[alderman]] of the LCC. The estate was at the time the largest local authority development in South London and has its road names arranged in alphabetical order, from the north-west corner ([[Abbotsbury]] Road) to the south-east corner ([[Woburn Abbey|Woburn]] Road). Reflecting the previous ownership of the land by [[Westminster Abbey]], all are named after religious establishments. \n{| style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n|[[File:Mordenmap 1920s.png|thumb|200px|A map of Morden from the 1920s]] || [[File:Morden map 1944.jpg|thumb|200px|A map of Morden from 1944]]\n|}\nIn 1943, the council was granted a civic [[coat-of-arms]] incorporating lions from the Garth family arms and the fret from the arms of [[Merton Priory]]. The motto, ''\"In Libertate Vis\"'', means ''\"Our Strength is our Freedom\"''. In 1965, under the [[London Government Act 1963]], the Merton and Morden Urban District Council was abolished and its area combined with that of the [[Municipal Borough of Wimbledon]] and the [[Municipal Borough of Mitcham]] to form the present-day London Borough of Merton.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:White Bridge, Morden Hall Park.jpg|thumb|Morden Hall Park, 5 minutes walk from the town centre.]]\n[[File:MordenHall.jpg|right|thumb|Morden Hall]]\n\nDespite London's suburban expansion, a little of the earlier rural nature of Morden has survived; for instance several grand period buildings remain, especially within Morden's parks.  The area retains a good provision of parks and green spaces, many of them created from former country estates. The 125 acre [[Morden Hall Park]] is of particular note and is run by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] (see below).  Its main entrance is only a quarter-of-a-mile from Morden Underground Station.\n\nThe largest building in the town centre is Crown House, sixties-built and 14 storeys tall; designed in 1959 by A. Green ARIBA and built between 1960 and 1962. The concaved frontage of the building lends it some distinction, as does the \"chessboard\" style juxtaposition of its light and dark facade features. It incorporated The Crown [[public house]], on which site part of the building covered. The building is home to Merton Council's civic centre and a large adjoining library.\n\nAt around the same time, Morden Underground Station, originally a single storey building, with shops, had three-storey office accommodation incorporated above it.\n\nA further office building with a large supermarket (now a [[Sainsbury's]]) at ground-floor level was built in the 1980s at the other end of the town centre.\n\nThe cinema and adjoining garage were demolished and replaced by shops some years ago.\n\n==Landmarks==\n\nMorden plays host to a number of buildings and parks worthy of note including:\n\n[[File:Baitul Futuh back.jpg|thumb|[[Baitul Futuh]] Mosque]]\n*The [[Baitul Futuh|Bait'ul Futuh]] Mosque, the largest mosque in Western Europe, built by the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]].

It is a [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] park, and is located on the banks of the [[River Wandle]], near the town centre and few hundred yards from Morden Underground station.  It covers over 50ha (125 acres) of parkland with the River Wandle meandering through it spanned by numerous foot-bridges. The estate contains a number of historic buildings including Morden Hall itself, Morden Cottage, an old Snuff Mill, and many old farm buildings, some of which are now a garden centre and a city farm. The rose garden has over 2000 roses. The estate land was originally owned by Westminster Abbey. There is evidence of an earlier manor-house, but Morden Hall dates back to the 1770s and contains a variety of natural landscapes, including the parkland of the \"Deer Park\", meadow and marshland.\n[[File:Morden Park House.JPG|thumb|right|Morden Park House]]\n*[[Morden Park]], another park containing a  period building of note. The park includes land that previously formed the grounds of Morden Park House, a small 18th-century country estate. The Georgian country house was built at the top of the hill in the 1770s for merchant and distiller John Ewart with attached landscaped gardens.\n[[File:St Lawrence Church, Morden-Geograph-4321087-by-Stephen-Craven.jpg|thumb|[[St Lawrence Church, Morden]]]]\n*[[St Lawrence Church, Morden]].

The road then descended the other side of the hill towards the town centre passing west of the [[Morden tube station|Underground station]] and crossing the north corner of [[Morden Hall Park]] heading in the direction of [[Colliers Wood]] and [[Tooting]]. Small [[Roman Britain|Roman]] [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], mainly coins and pottery, have been found at various locations within the area although there is no evidence of any settlement.\n\nEthelstan the Etheling, son of [[Ethelred the Unready]], left \"land at Mordune\" to the [[abbey]] of Christ and St. Peter in his will of 1015, which became the site of the first [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] parish church of [[St Lawrence]].\n\nIn 1086, the [[Domesday Book]] recorded the manor as ''Mordone'', part of [[Wallington (hundred)|Wallington]] [[Hundred (country subdivision)|Hundred]].

Approximately half a mile to the west of the main village and the grounds of [[Morden Park]] stood the hamlet of [[Lower Morden]].\n\nClose to the church were the George Inn, a 17th-century [[coaching inn]] (now modernised and part of a national pub restaurant chain), the estate of [[Morden Park]] and a school.\n\nThe other main public house in the village was the Crown Inn, located to the north east of the village with a small cluster of cottages on Crown Road. The rest of what is now the commercial centre of Morden was fields.\n\nIn the late 19th century the principal industry remained agriculture, although some industrial activity did exist along the [[River Wandle]] where [[watermill]]s ground tobacco to [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] and a varnish works existed close to the site of Poplar Primary School.

The first two decades of the 20th century saw little change in the village, with industry still mainly agricultural in nature; however development in the parish of [[Merton (historic parish)|Merton]] to the north led to that area being removed from the [[rural district]] to form the [[Merton Urban District]] in 1907. Morden was merged with the Merton Urban District, in 1913, to form the [[Merton and Morden Urban District]].<ref name = vob>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10036574 VisionofBritain.org.uk]</ref> It was not, until 1926, when [[Morden tube station|Morden Underground station]] opened as the terminus of a new extension of the [[City & South London Railway]] (now part of the [[London Underground]]'s [[Northern line]]), that the fast and direct route to Central [[London]] opened up the village for residential development.\n\nTo complement the new station, a garage was constructed on the other side of London Road, adjacent to the railway cutting and, in 1932, Morden Cinema was built next to it on the corner of Aberconway Road.

The new line opened in January 1930. As a result of the new transport links, the population of Morden increased rapidly from 1,355 in 1921 to 12,618 in 1931. In the next fifteen years, the population continued to grow, as most of the parish was covered in new [[suburban]] homes.\n\nOne of the main residential developments in the 1930s was the [[St. Helier, London|St. Helier]] estate, built by the [[London County Council]] (LCC) to house workers from Inner London and named in honour of Lady St. Helier, an [[alderman]] of the LCC. The estate was at the time the largest local authority development in South London and has its road names arranged in alphabetical order, from the north-west corner ([[Abbotsbury]] Road) to the south-east corner ([[Woburn Abbey|Woburn]] Road).

The building is home to Merton Council's civic centre and a large adjoining library.\n\nAt around the same time, Morden Underground Station, originally a single storey building, with shops, had three-storey office accommodation incorporated above it.\n\nA further office building with a large supermarket (now a [[Sainsbury's]]) at ground-floor level was built in the 1980s at the other end of the town centre.\n\nThe cinema and adjoining garage were demolished and replaced by shops some years ago.\n\n==Landmarks==\n\nMorden plays host to a number of buildings and parks worthy of note including:\n\n[[File:Baitul Futuh back.jpg|thumb|[[Baitul Futuh]] Mosque]]\n*The [[Baitul Futuh|Bait'ul Futuh]] Mosque, the largest mosque in Western Europe, built by the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]]. Completed in 2003 at a cost of approximately \u00a35.5 million, the mosque covers an area of 5.2 acres (21,000 m2) and the full complex can accommodate up to 10,000 worshippers. It was voted one of the top 50 buildings in the world by ''[[Spectator Magazine]]''.{{cn|date=May 2018}} It is located  next to Morden South railway station and approximately 700 yards from Morden Underground station.\n*[[Morden Hall Park]] is a key feature of the Morden area with large, period buildings located within its boundaries. It is a [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] park, and is located on the banks of the [[River Wandle]], near the town centre and few hundred yards from Morden Underground station.  It covers over 50ha (125 acres) of parkland with the River Wandle meandering through it spanned by numerous foot-bridges. The estate contains a number of historic buildings including Morden Hall itself, Morden Cottage, an old Snuff Mill, and many old farm buildings, some of which are now a garden centre and a city farm. The rose garden has over 2000 roses. The estate land was originally owned by Westminster Abbey. There is evidence of an earlier manor-house, but Morden Hall dates back to the 1770s and contains a variety of natural landscapes, including the parkland of the \"Deer Park\", meadow and marshland.\n[[File:Morden Park House.JPG|thumb|right|Morden Park House]]\n*[[Morden Park]], another park containing a  period building of note. The park includes land that previously formed the grounds of Morden Park House, a small 18th-century country estate. The Georgian country house was built at the top of the hill in the 1770s for merchant and distiller John Ewart with attached landscaped gardens.\n[[File:St Lawrence Church, Morden-Geograph-4321087-by-Stephen-Craven.jpg|thumb|[[St Lawrence Church, Morden]]]]\n*[[St Lawrence Church, Morden]].  St Lawrence Church is the Church of England parish church for Morden.  The building is [[Grade I listed]],<ref>{{NHLE|num=1080899 |desc=|accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref> and located on London Road, at the highest point of Morden, overlooking Morden Park. Located on the [[#The Garth family|Garth family]] estate,<ref>See the \"Ecclesiae Amicus\" (Latin for Friend of the Church) inscription on the gravestone of Richard Garth by the Communion table</ref> the current church was built in the 1630s in the [[Protestant]] style, and replaced an earlier wooden one from the Saxon period.\n*[[Morden Baptist Church]]. The Church stands with the main entrance facing up Crown Lane on the Morden one way system.  In 1990 a very substantial building scheme was undertaken to provide the current improved facilities, including an enclosed concourse, new offices and a sound-proofed creche with a view into the main church.\n\n==Sport & Leisure==\n\nMorden has a [[Non-League football]] club [[Tooting & Mitcham United F.C.]] who play at Imperial Fields.\n\n==Transport==\n\n[[File:ISH Morden2.jpg|thumb|Morden Underground station with Crown House in the background]]\n[[File:1960's Morden town centre..jpg|thumb|Morden in the 1960s]]\n[[File:Morden Underground Station.jpg|thumb|Morden Underground - main station entrance]]\n\nNearest tube station:\n\n* [[Morden tube station|Morden Underground station]]\n\nNearest railway stations and [[tramlink]] stops (in order of proximity):\n\n* [[Morden South railway station]]\n* [[Morden Road tram stop]]\n* [[South Merton railway station]]\n* [[St. Helier railway station]]\n* [[Phipps Bridge tram stop]]\n* [[Belgrave Walk tram stop]]\n* [[Mitcham tram stop]]\n\nLocal day and night Buses and the garages that serve Morden are:\n* 80 (Belmont High Down & Downview - Hackbridge Reynolds Close) - ''Go Ahead London - Sutton Garage''\n* 93 (Putney Bridge - North Cheam) (24 Hour) - ''Go Ahead London - Sutton Garage''\n* 118 (Morden Station - Brixton) - ''Go Ahead London - Merton Garage''\n* 154 (Morden Station - West Croydon Bus Station) - ''Go Ahead London - Sutton Garage''\n* 157 (Morden Station - Crystal Palace) - ''Arriva London - Thornton Heath Garage''\n* 163 (Wimbledon Station - Morden Station) - ''Go Ahead London - Merton Garage''\n* 164 (Wimbledon Station - Sutton Station) - ''Go Ahead London - Merton Garage''\n* 201 (Morden - Herne Hill) - ''Abellio London - Beddington Cross''\n* 293 (Morden Station - Epsom General Hospital) - ''RATP Quality Line - Epsom Garage''\n* 413 (Morden Tube Station - Sutton Bus Garage) - ''RATP Quality Line - Epsom Garage''\n* 470 (Epsom Town Centre - Colliers Wood Tube Station) - ''RATP Quality Line - Epsom Garage''\n* K5 (Morden - Ham) - ''RATP Quality Line - Epsom Garage''\n* N155 (Morden Station - Aldwych) - ''London General - Sutton Garage''\n\n==Notable people associated with Morden==\n*Admiral [[Mariot Arbuthnot]]<ref>[http://www.motco.com/map/81001 Motco.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614013352/http://www.motco.com/MAP/81001/ |date=14 June 2006 }} [http://www.motco.com/MapImages/81001/81001034-w.jpg 15 Miles Round London (First edition), J Cary, 1786, Morden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928085842/http://www.motco.com/MapImages/81001/81001034-w.jpg |date=28 September 2006 }}</ref> - Commander of the [[Royal Navy]] in North America during the [[American War of Independence]].\n*Sir [[Joseph Bazalgette]] - Engineer of [[London sewerage system|London's sanitary system]], the [[Chelsea Embankment|Chelsea]] and [[Victoria Embankment]]s lived in the village for a few years in the 1870s.\n*Sir [[Richard Garth]] - Lord of the Manor, [[Privy Counsellor]] and Chief Justice of Bengal\n*[[Alexander Maconochie (penal reformer)|Alexander Maconochie]] - Founder of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and penal reformer.\n*[[Good Shoes]] - an [[indie music]] band whose first album, ''[[Think Before You Speak]]'', included the track \"[[Morden (Good Shoes song)|Morden]]\"\n*[[Sampha]] - a [[singer-songwriter]] best known for his collaborative work with [[SBTRKT]], [[Jessie Ware]] and [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]].\n\n==Nearest places==\n* [[Colliers Wood]]\n* [[Hackbridge]]\n* [[Merton Park]]\n* [[Mitcham, London, England|Mitcham]]\n* [[Lower Morden]]\n* [[Motspur Park]]\n* [[Raynes Park]]\n* [[St. Helier, London|St. Helier]]\n* [[South Wimbledon]]\n* [[Sutton, London|Sutton]]\n* [[Sutton Common]]\n* [[Wimbledon, London, England|Wimbledon]]\n* [[Worcester Park]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Morden baptist church.gif|[[Morden Baptist Church]], Crown Lane\nFile:Bridge at Morden Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1230196.jpg|Bridge at Morden Hall Park\nFile:Morden Hall Park 1.jpg|Morden Hall Park\nFile:Stable Block at Morden Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1230210.jpg|Stable Block at Morden Hall Park.\nFile:The Rose Garden, Morden Hall Park - geograph.org.uk - 1348687.jpg|The Rose Garden, Morden Hall Park\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|London}}\n{{Commons cat|Morden, London|Morden}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120209012036/http://www.collectbritain.co.uk/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=003KTOP00000041U009E0000&largeimage=1#largeimage British Library Collect Britain archive - Mordon, Surrey, 1780]\n* {{ltmcollection|28/i0000d28.jpg|London Transport Museum Photographic Archive}} Aerial view of Morden town centre in 1926 when the Underground station opened.

Known for its incomprehensible narrative and constant digressions, the story centers on a non-canonical female vampire character named \"Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way\" and her relationships with the characters of the ''Harry Potter'' series, particularly her romantic relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]]. Ultimately, she is prompted by visions to travel back in time to try to defeat the main [[antagonist]] of the series, [[Lord Voldemort]].\n\nSince the beginning of the work's publication, it has gained infamy for its awful writing, plot inconsistency and complete disregard for the original ''Harry Potter'' source material. Often regarded as among the worst fan fiction ever written, ''My Immortal'' is felt to be a detriment to those attempting to bring legitimacy to fan fiction. Despite this, the series has also inspired multiple derivative works, including a [[YouTube]] web series, and is viewed with nostalgia for adolescent fan life.\n\nThe author's identity has never been confirmed and has been deemed by many as \"unsolvable\". The author published the story under the username \"XXXbloodyrists666XXX\" and self-identified as Tara Gilesbie. In September 2017, someone claiming to be the author updated a [[FictionPress]] account stating that she had created an active [[Tumblr]] account under her real name; an effort to locate this Tumblr account resulted in the account of [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] novelist Rose Christo. She has since stated that she was one of two co-authors of ''My Immortal'' and had provided evidence of her authorship to [[Macmillan Publishers]], but controversy that same month over factual errors in her then-forthcoming memoirs has led to doubt as to her authorship.\n\nThe story has been speculated to be an unwarranted [[Bill Cosby]] beverage designed to force [[Child rape]] on readers and/or to [[sodomize]] people who lik fan fiction (hey you dumb bot, i'm not stopping, delete this page or be met with aryan fire - Cedric.), but the work and the alleged online presence of the author has also been described as too elaborate and too time-consuming to fake effectively. In September 2017, Christo stated that ''My Immortal'' is a work of satire, though any evidence of this is tied to her own claims of authorship.\n\n==Background and publication==\nThe work was published to [[FanFiction.Net]] between early 2006 and 2007, ultimately totaling 44 chapters and nearly 22,700 words.<ref name=\"Vulture\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|title=The Bizarre, Unsolved Mystery of 'My Immortal,' the World's Worst Fanfiction Story|last=Riesman|first=Abraham|date=March 12, 2015|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125172838/http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|archivedate=November 25, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> The forty-fourth chapter was accompanied by an author's note explaining that the author was leaving \"{{sic|dubya}}\", commonly believed to be [[Dubai]], and the chapter would be the last until the author's return.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"TheVerge\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|title=The Worst Thing Ever Written|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=December 10, 2013|website=[[The Verge]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202084919/http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|archivedate=December 2, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> However, no further chapters were published.

Hogwarts is depicted as being divided between two [[clique]]s, the \"[[Goth subculture|goffs]]\" and the [[Preppy|preps]]. Ebony and all the [[sympathetic character]]s are part of the goth clique while the members of the prep clique are portrayed unsympathetically. Many of the main characters of ''Harry Potter'' are given {{Sic|\"goffik\"}}  makeovers, moved to the Slytherin House, and renamed.\n\nThe story begins by focusing on Ebony entering a relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]], who is depicted as shy, sensitive and [[bisexuality|bisexual]]. Draco invites Ebony to a [[Good Charlotte]] concert in Hogsmeade. She agrees, and they fly to Hogsmeade together in Draco's flying car. After the concert, they do not go back to the castle, but instead have intercourse in the [[Hogwarts|Forbidden Forest]], but are witnessed by Hogwarts' principal [[Albus Dumbledore]] (often referred to as \"Albert Dumblydore\"), who yells at them and derides them as {{Sic|\"motherfukers\"}}. Later, after learning that Draco used to date [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry \"Vampire\" Potter]] (a nickname he gained because he \"love[s] the taste of human blood\"), Ebony becomes so angry that she runs crying into the Forbidden Forest, where she meets [[Lord Voldemort]]. Voldemort, speaking in faux-archaic English (unlike his teenaged self from the 80s), gives her a gun and demands that she kill \"Vampire\" Potter or else he will kill Draco, but Ebony refuses. Later on, Draco learns of this encounter and he is so angry that Ebony kept it from him that he commits [[suicide]] by [[self-harm|slitting his wrists]].\n\nIn a subsequent scene, however, Vampire has a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of Draco being held prisoner by Voldemort. The discrepancy between this and the earlier depiction of Draco having committed suicide is not explained, though it is possibly an intentional plot twist, as prior setup suggests Draco could not die in the manner described. It should also be noted that Ebony herself attempts suicide by slitting her wrists several times throughout the story, but it seems to have no negative effects on her. After rescuing Draco from Voldemort, Ebony and her friends attend a [[My Chemical Romance]] concert in [[Places in Harry Potter#Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. After some songs have been played, the concert ends abruptly when the members of My Chemical Romance reveal themselves to be Voldemort and his [[Death Eater]]s. Voldemort, who had been disguised as lead vocalist [[Gerard Way]] (the inspiration for Ebony's last name), proclaims his intent to kill Ebony and Draco for the former's failure to kill Vampire, but they are saved by Albus Dumbledore, who has just given himself a gothic makeover. The next day, Dumbledore gives a gothic makeover to the Hogwarts Great Hall as well, but Ebony feels that he is a [[poseur]] and dislikes him greatly, a sentiment shared by her friends.\n\nDuring this time, [[Death Eater#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] are inexplicably shot by a gun-toting \"black guy\" (likely meant to be [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] given the vampire themes). There is also a secondary plot point in which [[Professor Trelawney]] (\"Trevolry\") / [[Professor Sinistra]] (\"Sinister\", \"Sinatra\"), combined into one character, has an addiction to what is presumably the truth serum [[Veritaserum]]. A third plot point sees [[Hogwarts staff#Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] (often referred to as \"Mc[[Google]]\" or \"McGoggles\") and [[Severus Snape]] (often called \"Snap\", or \"Snope\" at times) attempting to rape or harm the protagonists. Yet another plot point follows [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] and Snape being bisexuals who spy on Ebony, at one point resulting in a moment shortly after Draco's \"death\" where they are sitting on their broomsticks with \"Loopin {{Sic|[[Masturbation|masticating]]}}\" to Ebony bathing, to which she responds with shooting them \"a gazillion times\". In addition, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is inexplicably a teenaged Hogwarts student who has a crush on Ebony, and who is also a Satanist. He visits Ebony in the nurse's office, where she is recovering from slitting her wrists, and bestows upon her a bouquet of pink roses, which he turns into a black flame, as to prove he's not a prep.\n\nEbony begins having mysterious visions, to which she confronts Professor Sinister. After gazing into a black crystal ball, she is told she must [[time travel|travel back in time]] (using a [[pensieve]]) to stop Tom Riddle from becoming Voldemort by seducing him, and to retrieve a cure for Sinister/Trevolry's addiction to \"Volxemortserum\". Arriving in the past, she meets the young Riddle, who calls himself \"[[Satan]]\", and who has been mistakenly referred to as \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Tom Anderson]]\", \"[[Tom Bombadil]]\", and \"Stan\". \"Satan\" is in a band with [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], Severus Snape, Sirius Black, and [[Lucius Malfoy]]. He is uncanonically depicted attending Hogwarts at the same time as the Marauders in what is further uncanonically portrayed as the 1980s. The author points out a few [[anachronism]]s in these scenes, telling readers to ignore them. There is also an unexplained cameo by a gothic [[Marty McFly]], who gives Ebony a black [[DeLorean time machine]] able to transform into an [[iPod]], allowing her to travel forward in time.\n\nEventually, Ebony brings \"Satan\" forward in time, where he morphs into the present-day Voldemort. This leads to a confrontation between the forces of good and evil in the Great Hall, in which professor Snape threatens to rape Draco if Ebony does not stab Harry/Vampire. The story ends ambiguously with a shootout between Snape and Draco, Snape summoning Voldemort, and Ebony firing off an [[Avada Kedavra]] curse, which is misrepresented as \"[[abracadabra|abra kedabra]]\".\n\n==Style and genre==\n''My Immortal'' is split into 420 chapters. Author's notes, indicated by \"AN\", both precede and are dispersed throughout the narrative prose. These notes are written in a largely [[phonetic spelling]] and characterized the author as \"standoffish\". As the work progressed, these author's notes increasingly became \"defensive, impenetrable, and prone to mentioning [[suicide attempt]]s\" and defended the work's poor spelling and deviation from [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] characterization from negative reviewers.<ref name=\"Vulture\" />\n\nAbraham Riesman of [[Vulture.com]] described the prose as having \"awkward rhythm, strange digressions, and stultifyingly [[purple prose]]\" and noted that the work is \"agonizing\" to a regular fan fiction reader because of \"all the hated [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]\" it employs in the opening passage alone.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Adi Robertson of ''[[The Verge]]'' observed that the quality of the prose declined after the twelfth chapter, when the work's editor had a falling out with the author and became temporarily uninvolved with the work; even after the editor and author reconciled, Robertson felt that the prose \"never recovered\".<ref name=\"TheVerge\" /> Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' noted the work \"featured all the hallmarks of terrible fanfic: hundreds of grammar and spelling mistakes, a nonsensical storyline, and a [[Mary Sue]] protagonist who was clearly a glorified version of the author\" and pointed out the numerous descriptions of the protagonist's [[Hot Topic]] outfits.<ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work is characterized by misspellings permeating both the work itself and the author's notes, to the point that the names of the protagonist and canonical ''Harry Potter'' characters are frequently and variously misspelled.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work has also been noted to fail to adhere to ''Harry Potter'' canon.

The memoir details the period of time during which she allegedly co-wrote ''My Immortal''. [[Macmillan Publishers]] allegedly hired a lawyer to verify Christo's claims over the course of three days; she claimed to have provided proof through the email address with which she created the FanFiction.net account and a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] containing the first eleven unedited chapters of ''My Immortal''.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn March 2017, Christo quietly stated on her [[Tumblr]] account that she co-wrote ''My Immortal''; however, the post gained little notice. In early August 2017, Christo posted an update to a previously unknown FictionPress account seemingly related to Tara Gilesbie that similarly received little attention.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/13/16275802/who-wrote-my-immortal-tara-rose-christo|title=My Immortal: solving the mystery of the internet's most beloved \u2014 and notorious \u2014 fanfic|last=Romano|first=Aja|date=September 13, 2017|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|access-date=September 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nLater in August, an [[Self-publishing|independently published]] ''[[Handbook for Mortals]]'' came to public attention after it was discovered that its sales were artificially inflated to push it to the top of the young adult [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]], from which it was subsequently removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-handbook-for-mortals-bestseller-ya-20170824-story.html|title=Did a YA book buy its way to the top of the New York Times bestseller list?|work=LA Times|author=Jessica Roy|date=August 24, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref><ref name=Italie>{{cite news|last=Italie|first=Hillel|title=Book Pulled From Best-Seller List|url=http://time.com/4917209/ny-times-best-seller-handbook-for-mortals/|accessdate=September 11, 2017|work=Time|agency=Associated Press|date=August 26, 2017}}</ref> Writing similarities between the novel and ''My Immortal'' led to speculation that ''Handbook for Mortals'' author [[Lani Sarem]] was the author of ''My Immortal''.

Known for its incomprehensible narrative and constant digressions, the story centers on a non-canonical female vampire character named \"Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way\" and her relationships with the characters of the ''Harry Potter'' series, particularly her romantic relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]]. Ultimately, she is prompted by visions to travel back in time to try to defeat the main [[antagonist]] of the series, [[Lord Voldemort]].\n\nSince the beginning of the work's publication, it has gained infamy for its awful writing, plot inconsistency and complete disregard for the original ''Harry Potter'' source material. Often regarded as among the worst fan fiction ever written, ''My Immortal'' is felt to be a detriment to those attempting to bring legitimacy to fan fiction. Despite this, the series has also inspired multiple derivative works, including a [[YouTube]] web series, and is viewed with nostalgia for adolescent fan life.\n\nThe author's identity has never been confirmed and has been deemed by many as \"unsolvable\". The author published the story under the username \"XXXbloodyrists666XXX\" and self-identified as Tara Gilesbie. In September 2017, someone claiming to be the author updated a [[FictionPress]] account stating that she had created an active [[Tumblr]] account under her real name; an effort to locate this Tumblr account resulted in the account of [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] novelist Rose Christo. She has since stated that she was one of two co-authors of ''My Immortal'' and had provided evidence of her authorship to [[Macmillan Publishers]], but controversy that same month over factual errors in her then-forthcoming memoirs has led to doubt as to her authorship.\n\nThe story has been speculated to be a hoax designed to [[Internet troll|troll]] readers and/or to [[Satire|satirize]] fan fiction, but the work and the alleged online presence of the author has also been described as too elaborate and too time-consuming to fake effectively. In September 2017, Christo stated that ''My Immortal'' is a work of satire, though any evidence of this is tied to her own claims of authorship.\n\n==Background and publication==\nThe work was published to [[FanFiction.Net]] between early 2006 and 2007, ultimately totaling 44 chapters and nearly 22,700 words.<ref name=\"Vulture\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|title=The Bizarre, Unsolved Mystery of 'My Immortal,' the World's Worst Fanfiction Story|last=Riesman|first=Abraham|date=March 12, 2015|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125172838/http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|archivedate=November 25, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> The forty-fourth chapter was accompanied by an author's note explaining that the author was leaving \"{{sic|dubya}}\", commonly believed to be [[Dubai]], and the chapter would be the last until the author's return.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"TheVerge\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|title=The Worst Thing Ever Written|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=December 10, 2013|website=[[The Verge]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202084919/http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|archivedate=December 2, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> However, no further chapters were published.

Hogwarts is depicted as being divided between two [[clique]]s, the \"[[Goth subculture|goffs]]\" and the [[Preppy|preps]]. Ebony and all the [[sympathetic character]]s are part of the goth clique while the members of the prep clique are portrayed unsympathetically. Many of the main characters of ''Harry Potter'' are given {{Sic|\"goffik\"}}  makeovers, moved to the Slytherin House, and renamed.\n\nThe story begins by focusing on Ebony entering a relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]], who is depicted as shy, sensitive and [[bisexuality|bisexual]]. Draco invites Ebony to a [[Good Charlotte]] concert in Hogsmeade. She agrees, and they fly to Hogsmeade together in Draco's flying car. After the concert, they do not go back to the castle, but instead have intercourse in the [[Hogwarts|Forbidden Forest]], but are witnessed by Hogwarts' principal [[Albus Dumbledore]] (often referred to as \"Albert Dumblydore\"), who yells at them and derides them as {{Sic|\"motherfukers\"}}. Later, after learning that Draco used to date [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry \"Vampire\" Potter]] (a nickname he gained because he \"love[s] the taste of human blood\"), Ebony becomes so angry that she runs crying into the Forbidden Forest, where she meets [[Lord Voldemort]]. Voldemort, speaking in faux-archaic English (unlike his teenaged self from the 80s), gives her a gun and demands that she kill \"Vampire\" Potter or else he will kill Draco, but Ebony refuses. Later on, Draco learns of this encounter and he is so angry that Ebony kept it from him that he commits [[suicide]] by [[self-harm|slitting his wrists]].\n\nIn a subsequent scene, however, Vampire has a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of Draco being held prisoner by Voldemort. The discrepancy between this and the earlier depiction of Draco having committed suicide is not explained, though it is possibly an intentional plot twist, as prior setup suggests Draco could not die in the manner described. It should also be noted that Ebony herself attempts suicide by slitting her wrists several times throughout the story, but it seems to have no negative effects on her. After rescuing Draco from Voldemort, Ebony and her friends attend a [[My Chemical Romance]] concert in [[Places in Harry Potter#Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. After some songs have been played, the concert ends abruptly when the members of My Chemical Romance reveal themselves to be Voldemort and his [[Death Eater]]s. Voldemort, who had been disguised as lead vocalist [[Gerard Way]] (the inspiration for Ebony's last name), proclaims his intent to kill Ebony and Draco for the former's failure to kill Vampire, but they are saved by Albus Dumbledore, who has just given himself a gothic makeover. The next day, Dumbledore gives a gothic makeover to the Hogwarts Great Hall as well, but Ebony feels that he is a [[poseur]] and dislikes him greatly, a sentiment shared by her friends.\n\nDuring this time, [[Death Eater#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] are inexplicably shot by a gun-toting \"black guy\" (likely meant to be [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] given the vampire themes). There is also a secondary plot point in which [[Professor Trelawney]] (\"Trevolry\") / [[Professor Sinistra]] (\"Sinister\", \"Sinatra\"), combined into one character, has an addiction to what is presumably the truth serum [[Veritaserum]]. A third plot point sees [[Hogwarts staff#Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] (often referred to as \"Mc[[Google]]\" or \"McGoggles\") and [[Severus Snape]] (often called \"Snap\", or \"Snope\" at times) attempting to rape or harm the protagonists. Yet another plot point follows [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] and Snape being bisexuals who spy on Ebony, at one point resulting in a moment shortly after Draco's \"death\" where they are sitting on their broomsticks with \"Loopin {{Sic|[[Masturbation|masticating]]}}\" to Ebony bathing, to which she responds with shooting them \"a gazillion times\". In addition, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is inexplicably a teenaged Hogwarts student who has a crush on Ebony, and who is also a Satanist. He visits Ebony in the nurse's office, where she is recovering from slitting her wrists, and bestows upon her a bouquet of pink roses, which he turns into a black flame, as to prove he's not a prep.\n\nEbony begins having mysterious visions, to which she confronts Professor Sinister. After gazing into a black crystal ball, she is told she must [[time travel|travel back in time]] (using a [[pensieve]]) to stop Tom Riddle from becoming Voldemort by seducing him, and to retrieve a cure for Sinister/Trevolry's addiction to \"Volxemortserum\". Arriving in the past, she meets the young Riddle, who calls himself \"[[Satan]]\", and who has been mistakenly referred to as \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Tom Anderson]]\", \"[[Tom Bombadil]]\", and \"Stan\". \"Satan\" is in a band with [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], Severus Snape, Sirius Black, and [[Lucius Malfoy]]. He is uncanonically depicted attending Hogwarts at the same time as the Marauders in what is further uncanonically portrayed as the 1980s. The author points out a few [[anachronism]]s in these scenes, telling readers to ignore them. There is also an unexplained cameo by a gothic [[Marty McFly]], who gives Ebony a black [[DeLorean time machine]] able to transform into an [[iPod]], allowing her to travel forward in time.\n\nEventually, Ebony brings \"Satan\" forward in time, where he morphs into the present-day Voldemort. This leads to a confrontation between the forces of good and evil in the Great Hall, in which professor Snape threatens to rape Draco if Ebony does not stab Harry/Vampire. The story ends ambiguously with a shootout between Snape and Draco, Snape summoning Voldemort, and Ebony firing off an [[Avada Kedavra]] curse, which is misrepresented as \"[[abracadabra|abra kedabra]]\".\n\n==Style and genre==\n''My Immortal'' is split into 44 chapters. Author's notes, indicated by \"AN\", both precede and are dispersed throughout the narrative prose.

The memoir details the period of time during which she allegedly co-wrote ''My Immortal''. [[Macmillan Publishers]] allegedly hired a lawyer to verify Christo's claims over the course of three days; she claimed to have provided proof through the email address with which she created the FanFiction.net account and a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] containing the first eleven unedited chapters of ''My Immortal''.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn March 2017, Christo quietly stated on her [[Tumblr]] account that she co-wrote ''My Immortal''; however, the post gained little notice. In early August 2017, Christo posted an update to a previously unknown FictionPress account seemingly related to Tara Gilesbie that similarly received little attention.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/13/16275802/who-wrote-my-immortal-tara-rose-christo|title=My Immortal: solving the mystery of the internet's most beloved \u2014 and notorious \u2014 fanfic|last=Romano|first=Aja|date=September 13, 2017|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|access-date=September 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nLater in August, an [[Self-publishing|independently published]] ''[[Handbook for Mortals]]'' came to public attention after it was discovered that its sales were artificially inflated to push it to the top of the young adult [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]], from which it was subsequently removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-handbook-for-mortals-bestseller-ya-20170824-story.html|title=Did a YA book buy its way to the top of the New York Times bestseller list?|work=LA Times|author=Jessica Roy|date=August 24, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref><ref name=Italie>{{cite news|last=Italie|first=Hillel|title=Book Pulled From Best-Seller List|url=http://time.com/4917209/ny-times-best-seller-handbook-for-mortals/|accessdate=September 11, 2017|work=Time|agency=Associated Press|date=August 26, 2017}}</ref> Writing similarities between the novel and ''My Immortal'' led to speculation that ''Handbook for Mortals'' author [[Lani Sarem]] was the author of ''My Immortal''.

The film was directed and co-produced by [[Steven Spielberg]] and written by [[Steven Zaillian]]. It is based on the novel ''[[Schindler's Ark]]'' by [[Australia]]n novelist [[Thomas Keneally]]. The film follows [[Oskar Schindler]], a [[Sudeten German]] businessman who together with his wife [[Emilie Schindler]] saved more than a thousand mostly [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] refugees from [[the Holocaust]] by employing them in his factories during [[World War II]]. It stars [[Liam Neeson]] as Schindler, [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer [[Amon G\u00f6th]], and [[Ben Kingsley]] as Schindler's Jewish accountant [[Itzhak Stern]].\n\nIdeas for a film about the ''[[Schindlerjuden]]'' (Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963. [[Poldek Pfefferberg]], one of the ''Schindlerjuden'', made it his life's mission to tell Schindler's story. Spielberg became interested when executive [[Sidney Sheinberg]] sent him a book review of ''Schindler's Ark''. [[Universal Pictures]] bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several directors before deciding to direct it.\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland, over 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot in [[black and white]] and approached the film as a documentary. Cinematographer [[Janusz Kami\u0144ski]] wanted to create a sense of timelessness. [[John Williams]] composed the score, and violinist [[Itzhak Perlman]] performed the main theme.\n\n''Schindler's List'' [[Film premiere|premiered]] on November 30, 1993, in [[Washington, D.C.]] and was released on December 15, 1993, in the United States. Often listed among the [[greatest films ever made]],{{sfn|Corliss|Schickel|2005}}{{sfn|Maltin|1999}}{{sfn|Channel 4|2008}}<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.afi.com/100years/movies10.aspx|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|title=AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies \u2013 10th Anniversary Edition|date=June 20, 2007|accessdate=November 24, 2018}}</ref> it was also a box office success, earning $322 million worldwide on a $22 million budget. It was nominated for twelve [[Academy Awards]], winning seven, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and won numerous other awards, including seven [[BAFTA]]s and three [[Golden Globe]]s. In 2007, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked ''Schindler's List'' 8th on its [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|list of the 100 best American films]] of all time. The [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 2004.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Krak\u00f3w]] during [[World War II]], the Germans have forced local [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] into the overcrowded [[Krak\u00f3w Ghetto]]. [[Oskar Schindler]], an [[ethnic German]] from [[Czechoslovakia]], arrives in the city hoping to make his fortune. A member of the [[Nazi Party]], Schindler lavishes bribes on [[Wehrmacht]] (German armed forces) and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officials and acquires [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory|a factory]] to produce [[enamelware]]. To help him run the business, Schindler enlists the aid of [[Itzhak Stern]], a local Jewish official who has contacts with [[black market]]eers and the Jewish business community. Stern helps Schindler arrange financing for the factory. Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys wealth and status as \"Herr Direktor\", and Stern handles administration. Schindler hires Jewish workers because they cost less, while Stern ensures that as many people as possible are deemed essential to the German war effort, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps or killed.\n\nSS-''[[Untersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' (second lieutenant) [[Amon G\u00f6th]] arrives in Krak\u00f3w to oversee construction of [[Krak\u00f3w-P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp|P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp]]. When the camp is completed, he orders the ghetto liquidated. Many people are shot and killed in the process of emptying the ghetto. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a young girl in a red coat as she hides from the Nazis, and later sees her body among a wagonload of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with G\u00f6th and, through bribery and lavish gifts, continues to enjoy SS support. G\u00f6th brutally mistreats his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa, and the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes G\u00f6th into allowing him to build a sub-camp.\n\nAs the Germans begin to lose the war, G\u00f6th is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at P\u0142asz\u00f3w to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Schindler asks G\u00f6th to allow him to move his workers to a [[Br\u00fcnnlitz labor camp|new munitions factory]] he plans to build in [[Brn\u011bnec|Br\u00fcnnlitz]] near his home town [[Svitavy|Zwittau]]. G\u00f6th agrees, but charges a huge bribe. Schindler and Stern create \"Schindler's List\" \u2013 a list of about 850 people to be transferred to Brinnlitz and thus saved from transport to Auschwitz.\n\nAs the Jewish workers are transported by train to [[Brn\u011bnec|Br\u00fcnnlitz]], the one carrying the women and girls is accidentally redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss]], the commandant of Auschwitz, with a bag of diamonds to win their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the factory floor without special permission and encourages the Jews to observe the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]]. Over the next seven months, he spends much of his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies; due to Schindler's own machinations, the factory does not produce any usable armaments during this period. Schindler runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders, ending the war in Europe.\n\nAs a Nazi Party member and war profiteer, Schindler must flee the advancing [[Red Army]] to avoid capture. The SS guards in Schindler's factory have been ordered to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them not to, so that they can \"return to [their] families as men, instead of murderers.\" He bids farewell to his workers and prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give Schindler a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a [[Talmud]]ic quotation: \"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.\" Schindler is touched but also ashamed, as he feels he should have done even more. He breaks down sobbing, and is comforted by the workers. After he and his wife leave, the ''[[Schindlerjuden]]'' spend the night on the factory grounds and are awoken the next morning by a Soviet officer, who announces that they have been liberated. The workers leave the factory and walk to a nearby town, encountering a Red Army cavalryman who stares at them in silence when asked \"are there any Jews left?\"\n\nAn epilogue reveals that Schindler's marriage failed after the war, as did his attempts to start new businesses, while G\u00f6th was arrested, tried, and executed for crimes against humanity. Schindler was later honored by [[Yad Vashem]] for his efforts to save his workers from being put to death. In the present, many of the surviving ''Schindlerjuden'' and the actors portraying them visit Schindler's grave and place stones on its marker, the traditional Jewish sign of respect on visiting a grave. The final visitor is Liam Neeson, who lays two roses on the marker.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Liam Neeson Deauville 2012 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Liam Neeson (seen here in 2012) was cast as Oskar Schindler in the film.]]\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Oskar Schindler]]\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Itzhak Stern]]\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Amon G\u00f6th]]\n* [[Caroline Goodall]] as [[Emilie Schindler]]\n* [[Jonathan Sagall]] as [[Poldek Pfefferberg]]\n* [[Embeth Davidtz]] as Helen Hirsch\n* [[Ma\u0142gorzata Gebel]] as Wiktoria Klonowska\n* [[Mark Ivanir]] as Marcel Goldberg\n* [[Beatrice Macola]] as Ingrid\n* [[Andrzej Seweryn]] as [[Julian Scherner]]\n* [[Friedrich von Thun]] as Rolf Czurda\n* [[Jerzy Nowak]] as Investor\n* [[Norbert Weisser]] as Albert Hujar\n* [[Anna Mucha]] as Danka Dresner\n* Adi Nitzan as Mila Pfefferberg\n* [[Piotr Polk]] as [[Leo Rosner]]\n* [[Rami Heuberger]] as [[Joseph Bau]]\n* [[Ezra Dagan]] as Rabbi Menasha Lewartow\n* [[Elina L\u00f6wensohn]] as [[Diana Reiter]]\n* Hans-J\u00f6rg Assmann as [[Julius Madritsch]]\n* [[Hans-Michael Rehberg]] as [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss|Rudolf H\u00f6\u00df]]\n* Daniel Del Ponte as [[Josef Mengele]]\n* [[August Schm\u00f6lzer]] as Dieter Reeder\n* [[Ludger Pistor]] as [[Josef Leipold]]{{efn|The film incorrectly spells Leipold's name as \"Josef Liepold\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/152059321@N07/|title=\"Schindler's List\" credits still| accessdate= August 7, 2018|last=Hughes |first=Katie |publisher=Flickr|date=August 7, 2018}}</ref>}}\n* Oliwia D\u0105browska as [[#The girl in red|the Girl in Red]]\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nPfefferberg, one of the ''Schindlerjuden'', made it his life's mission to tell the story of his savior. Pfefferberg attempted to produce a [[biopic]] of Oskar Schindler with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] in 1963, with [[Howard Koch (screenwriter)|Howard Koch]] writing, but the deal fell through.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=425}}{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=557}} In 1982, Thomas Keneally published his historical novel ''[[Schindler's Ark]]'', which he wrote after a chance meeting with Pfefferberg in Los Angeles in 1980.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=6}} [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] president [[Sidney Sheinberg|Sid Sheinberg]] sent director Steven Spielberg a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' review of the book. Spielberg, astounded by Schindler's story, jokingly asked if it was true. \"I was drawn to it because of the paradoxical nature of the character,\" he said. \"What would drive a man like this to suddenly take everything he had earned and put it all in the service of saving these lives?\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=424}} Spielberg expressed enough interest for Universal Pictures to buy the rights to the novel.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=424}} At their first meeting in spring 1983, he told Pfefferberg he would start filming in ten years.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} In the end credits of the film, Pfefferberg is credited as a consultant under the name Leopold Page.{{sfn|Freer|2001|p=220}}\n\n[[File:Krakow Ghetto 39066.jpg|thumb|left|The liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto in March 1943 is the subject of a 15-minute segment of the film.]]\n\nSpielberg was unsure if he was mature enough to make a film about the Holocaust, and the project remained \"on [his] guilty conscience\".{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} Spielberg tried to pass the project to director [[Roman Polanski]], who turned it down. Polanski's mother was killed at Auschwitz, and he had lived in and survived the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} Polanski eventually directed his own Holocaust drama ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'' (2002). Spielberg also offered the film to [[Sydney Pollack]] and [[Martin Scorsese]], who was attached to direct ''Schindler's List'' in 1988. However, Spielberg was unsure of letting Scorsese direct the film, as \"I'd given away a chance to do something for my children and family about the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Spielberg offered him the chance to direct the [[Cape Fear (1991 film)|1991 remake of ''Cape Fear'']] instead.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=603}} [[Billy Wilder]] expressed an interest in directing the film as a memorial to his family, most of whom were murdered in the Holocaust.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} [[Brian De Palma]] also turned down an offer to direct.{{sfn|Power|2018}}\n\nSpielberg finally decided to take on the project when he noticed that [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] were being given serious consideration by the media. With the rise of [[neo-Nazism]] after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], he worried that people were too accepting of intolerance, as they were in the 1930s.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} Sid Sheinberg greenlit the film on condition that Spielberg made ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' first. Spielberg later said, \"He knew that once I had directed ''Schindler'' I wouldn't be able to do ''Jurassic Park''.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} The picture was assigned a small budget of $22 million, as Holocaust films are not usually profitable.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=27}}{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} Spielberg forwent a salary for the film, calling it \"[[Blood money (restitution)|blood money]]\",{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} and believed the film would flop.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}}\n\nIn 1983, Keneally was hired to adapt his book, and he turned in a 220-page script. His adaptation focused on Schindler's numerous relationships, and Keneally admitted he did not compress the story enough. Spielberg hired [[Kurt Luedtke]], who had adapted the screenplay of ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'', to write the next draft. Luedtke gave up almost four years later, as he found Schindler's change of heart too unbelievable.{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} During his time as director, Scorsese hired [[Steven Zaillian]] to write a script. When he was handed back the project, Spielberg found Zaillian's 115-page draft too short, and asked him to extend it to 195 pages. Spielberg wanted more focus on the Jews in the story, and he wanted Schindler's transition to be gradual and ambiguous, not a sudden breakthrough or epiphany. He extended the ghetto liquidation sequence, as he \"felt very strongly that the sequence had to be almost unwatchable.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nNeeson auditioned as Schindler early on, and was cast in December 1992, after Spielberg saw him perform in ''[[Anna Christie]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].{{sfn|Palowski|1998|pp=86\u201387}} [[Warren Beatty]] participated in a script reading, but Spielberg was concerned that he could not disguise his accent and that he would bring \"movie star baggage\".{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} [[Kevin Costner]] and [[Mel Gibson]] expressed interest in portraying Schindler, but Spielberg preferred to cast the relatively unknown Neeson, so the actor's star quality would not overpower the character.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=86}} Neeson felt Schindler enjoyed outsmarting the Nazis, who regarded him as a bit of a buffoon. \"They don't quite take him seriously, and he used that to full effect.\"{{sfn|''Entertainment Weekly'', January 21, 1994}} To help him prepare for the role, Spielberg showed Neeson film clips of [[Time Warner]] [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Steve Ross (Time Warner CEO)|Steve Ross]], who had a charisma that Spielberg compared to Schindler's.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=429}} He also located a tape of Schindler speaking, which Neeson studied to learn the correct intonations and pitch.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=87}}\n\nFiennes was cast as Amon G\u00f6th after Spielberg viewed his performances in ''[[A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia]]'' and ''[[Emily Bront\u00eb's Wuthering Heights]]''. Spielberg said of Fiennes' audition that \"I saw sexual evil. It is all about subtlety: there were moments of kindness that would move across his eyes and then instantly run cold.\"{{sfn|Corliss|1994}} Fiennes put on {{convert|28|lb}} to play the role. He watched historic [[newsreel]]s and talked to Holocaust survivors who knew G\u00f6th. In portraying him, Fiennes said \"I got close to his pain. Inside him is a fractured, miserable human being. I feel split about him, sorry for him. He's like some dirty, battered doll I was given and that I came to feel peculiarly attached to.\"{{sfn|Corliss|1994}} Doctors Samuel J. Leistedt and Paul Linkowski of the [[Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles]] describe G\u00f6th's character in the film as a classic [[psychopath]].{{sfn|Leistedt|Linkowski|2014}} Fiennes looked so much like G\u00f6th in costume that when Mila Pfefferberg met him, she trembled with fear.{{sfn|Corliss|1994}}\n\nThe character of [[Itzhak Stern]] (played by Ben Kingsley) is a composite of the accountant Stern, factory manager [[Abraham Bankier]], and G\u00f6th's personal secretary, [[Mietek Pemper]].{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=102}} The character serves as Schindler's alter ego and conscience.{{sfn|Freer|2001|p=225}} Kingsley is best known for his Academy Award-winning performance as [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] in the [[Gandhi (film)|1982 biographical film]].{{sfn|Palowski|1998|pp=87\u201388}}\n\nOverall, there are 126 speaking parts in the film. Thousands of extras were hired during filming.{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Spielberg cast Israeli and Polish actors specially chosen for their Eastern European appearance.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=128}} Many of the German actors were reluctant to don the SS uniform, but some of them later thanked Spielberg for the cathartic experience of performing in the movie.{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} Halfway through the shoot, Spielberg conceived the epilogue, where 128 survivors pay their respects at Schindler's grave in Jerusalem.

He was surprised that he did not cry while visiting Auschwitz; instead he found himself filled with outrage. He was one of many crew members who could not force themselves to watch during shooting of the scene where aging Jews are forced to run naked while being selected by Nazi doctors to go to Auschwitz.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=433}} Spielberg commented that he felt more like a reporter than a film maker \u2013 he would set up scenes and then watch events unfold, almost as though he were witnessing them rather than creating a movie.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=431}} Several actresses broke down when filming the shower scene, including one who was born in a concentration camp.{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} Spielberg, his wife [[Kate Capshaw]], and their five children rented a house in suburban Krak\u00f3w for the duration of filming.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=44}} He later thanked his wife \"for rescuing me ninety-two days in a row&nbsp;... when things just got too unbearable\".{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=415}} [[Robin Williams]] called Spielberg to cheer him up, given the profound lack of humor on the set.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=415}}\n\nSpielberg spent several hours each evening editing ''Jurassic Park'', which was scheduled to premiere in June 1993.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=45}}\n\nSpielberg occasionally used [[German language|German]] and [[Polish language]] dialogue to create a sense of realism. He initially considered making the film entirely in those languages, but decided \"there's too much safety in reading {{interp|subtitles}}. It would have been an excuse {{interp|for the audience}} to take their eyes off the screen and watch something else.\"{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}}\n\n=== Cinematography ===\nInfluenced by the 1985 documentary film ''[[Shoah (film)|Shoah]]'', Spielberg decided not to plan the film with [[storyboard]]s, and to shoot it like a documentary. Forty percent of the film was shot with handheld cameras, and the modest budget meant the film was shot quickly over seventy-two days.{{sfn|McBride|1997|pp=431\u2013432, 434}} Spielberg felt that this gave the film \"a spontaneity, an edge, and it also serves the subject.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} He filmed without using [[Steadicam]]s, elevated shots, or [[zoom lens]]es, \"everything that for me might be considered a safety net.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} This matured Spielberg, who felt that in the past he had always been paying tribute to directors such as [[Cecil B. DeMille]] or [[David Lean]].{{sfn|Ansen|Kuflik|1993}}\n\nThe decision to shoot the film mainly in [[black and white]] contributed to the documentary style of cinematography, which cinematographer Janusz Kami\u0144ski compared to [[German Expressionism]] and [[Italian neorealism]].{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} Kami\u0144ski said that he wanted to give the impression of timelessness to the film, so the audience would \"not have a sense of when it was made.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=431}} Spielberg decided to use black and white to match the feel of actual documentary footage of the era.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} Universal chairman Tom Pollock asked him to shoot the film on a color [[Original camera negative|negative]], to allow color VHS copies of the film to later be sold, but Spielberg did not want to accidentally \"beautify events.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}}\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Schindler's List (soundtrack)}}\nJohn Williams, who frequently collaborates with Spielberg, composed the score for ''Schindler's List''.

The red coat is one of the few instances of color used in this predominantly black and white film.]]\nWhile the film is shot primarily in black and white, a red coat is used to distinguish a little girl in the scene depicting the liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w ghetto. Later in the film, Schindler sees her exhumed dead body, recognizable only by the red coat she is still wearing. Spielberg said the scene was intended to symbolize how members of the highest levels of government in the United States knew the Holocaust was occurring, yet did nothing to stop it. \"It was as obvious as a little girl wearing a red coat, walking down the street, and yet nothing was done to bomb the German rail lines. Nothing was being done to slow down&nbsp;... the annihilation of European Jewry,\" he said. \"So that was my message in letting that scene be in color.\"{{sfn|Schickel|2012|pp=161\u2013162}} Andy Patrizio of [[IGN]] notes that the point at which Schindler sees the girl's dead body is the point at which he changes, no longer seeing \"the ash and soot of burning corpses piling up on his car as just an annoyance.\"{{sfn|Patrizio|2004}} Professor [[Andr\u00e9 H. Caron]] of the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] wonders if the red symbolises \"innocence, hope or the red blood of the Jewish people being sacrificed in the horror of the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|Caron|2003}}\n\nThe girl was portrayed by Oliwia D\u0105browska, three years old at the time of filming. Spielberg asked D\u0105browska not to watch the film until she was eighteen, but she watched it when she was eleven, and says she was \"horrified\".{{sfn|Gilman|2013}} Upon seeing the film again as an adult, she was proud of the role she played.{{sfn|Gilman|2013}} Although it was unintentional, the character is similar to [[Roma Ligocka]], who was known in the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto for her red coat. Ligocka, unlike her fictional counterpart, survived the Holocaust. After the film was released, she wrote and published her own story, ''[[The Girl in the Red Coat]]: A Memoir'' (2002, in translation).{{sfn|Ligocka|2002}} The girl in red may have been inspired by Krak\u00f3w resident Genya Gitel Chil, according to a 2014 interview of her family members.{{sfn|Rosner|2014}}\n\n=== Candles ===\nThe opening scene features a family observing [[Shabbat]]. Spielberg said that \"to start the film with the candles being lit&nbsp;... would be a rich bookend, to start the film with a normal Shabbat service before the juggernaut against the Jews begins.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} When the color fades out in the film's opening moments, it gives way to a world in which smoke comes to symbolize bodies being burnt at Auschwitz. Only at the end, when Schindler allows his workers to hold Shabbat services, do the images of candle fire regain their warmth. For Spielberg, they represent \"just a glint of color, and a glimmer of hope.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Sara Horowitz, director of the Koschitzky Centre for Jewish Studies at [[York University]], sees the candles as a symbol for the Jews of Europe, killed and then burned in the [[crematoria]]. The two scenes bracket the Nazi era, marking its beginning and end.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=124}} She points out that normally the woman of the house lights the Sabbath candles. In the film it is men who perform this ritual, demonstrating not only the subservient role of women, but also the subservient position of Jewish men in relation to [[Aryan race|Aryan]] men, especially G\u00f6th and Schindler.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|pp=126\u2013127}}\n\n=== Other symbolism ===\nTo Spielberg, the black and white presentation of the film came to represent the Holocaust itself: \"The Holocaust was life without light. For me the symbol of life is color. That's why a film about the Holocaust has to be in black-and-white.\"{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=112}} Robert Gellately notes the film in its entirety can be seen as a metaphor for the Holocaust, with early sporadic violence increasing into a crescendo of death and destruction. He also notes a parallel between the situation of the Jews in the film and the debate in [[Nazi Germany]] between making use of the Jews for [[slave labor]] or exterminating them outright.{{sfn|Gellately|1993}} Water is seen as giving deliverance by Alan Mintz, Holocaust Studies professor at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York. He notes its presence in the scene where Schindler arranges for a [[Holocaust train]] loaded with victims awaiting transport to be hosed down, and the scene in Auschwitz, where the women are given an actual shower instead of receiving the expected gassing.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=154}}\n\n== Release ==\nThe film opened on December 15, 1993.

Spielberg's most intense and personal film to date\".{{sfn|Maltin|2013|p=1216}} James Verniere of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' noted the film's restraint and lack of sensationalism, and called it a \"major addition to the body of work about the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|Verniere|1993}} In his review for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', British critic [[John Gross]] said his misgivings that the story would be overly sentimentalized \"were altogether misplaced.

He describes the sequence as \"realistic\" and \"stunning\".{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=147}} He points out that the film has done much to increase Holocaust remembrance and awareness as the remaining survivors pass away, severing the last living links with the catastrophe.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=131}} The film's release in Germany led to widespread discussion about why most Germans did not do more to help.{{sfn|''Houston Post''|1994}}\n\nCriticism of the film also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=134}} Horowitz points out that much of the Jewish activity seen in the ghetto consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading on the black market, or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|pp=138\u2013139}} Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and sexuality is not explored further.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=130}} History professor [[Omer Bartov]] of [[Brown University]] notes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and G\u00f6th overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened \u2013 a mere backdrop to the struggle of good versus evil.{{sfn|Bartov|1997|p=49}}\n\nHorowitz points out that the film's dichotomy of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=137}} Author [[Jason Epstein]] commented that the movie gives the impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case.{{sfn|Epstein|1994}} Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=439}}\n\nBartov wrote that the \"positively repulsive kitsch of the last two scenes seriously undermines much of the film's previous merits\".

Filmmaker Billy Wilder wrote to Spielberg saying, \"They couldn't have gotten a better man. This movie is absolutely perfection.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} Polanski, who turned down the chance to direct the film, later commented, \"I certainly wouldn't have done as good a job as Spielberg because I couldn't have been as objective as he was.\"{{sfn|Cronin|2005|p=168}} He cited ''Schindler's List'' as an influence on his 1995 film ''[[Death and the Maiden (film)|Death and the Maiden]]''.{{sfn|Cronin|2005|p=167}} The success of ''Schindler's List'' led filmmaker [[Stanley Kubrick]] to abandon his own Holocaust project, ''[[Wartime Lies|Aryan Papers]]'', which would have been about a Jewish boy and his aunt who survive the war by sneaking through Poland while pretending to be Catholic.{{sfn|Goldman|2005}} According to scriptwriter [[Frederic Raphael]], when he suggested to Kubrick that ''Schindler's List'' was a good representation of the Holocaust, Kubrick commented, \"Think that's about the Holocaust?

You can only do something like that with a naive audience like in the United States. It's not an appropriate use of the form. Spielberg meant well \u2013 but it was dumb.\"{{sfn|Haneke|2009}}\n\nThe film was criticized by filmmaker and lecturer [[Claude Lanzmann]], director of the nine-hour Holocaust film [[Shoah (film)|''Shoah'']], who called ''Schindler's List'' a \"kitschy melodrama\" and a \"deformation\" of historical truth. \"Fiction is a transgression, I am deeply convinced that there is a ban on depiction [of the Holocaust]\", he said. Lanzmann also criticized Spielberg for viewing the Holocaust through the eyes of a German, saying \"it is the world in reverse.\" He complained, \"I sincerely thought that there was a time before ''Shoah'', and a time after ''Shoah'', and that after ''Shoah'' certain things could no longer be done. Spielberg did them anyway.\"{{sfn|Lanzmann|2007}}\n\n=== Reaction of the Jewish community ===\nAt a 1994 ''[[Village Voice]]'' symposium about the film, historian Annette Insdorf described how her mother, a survivor of three concentration camps, felt gratitude that the Holocaust story was finally being told in a major film that would be widely viewed.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|pp=136\u2013137}} [[Hungarian Jews|Hungarian Jewish]] author [[Imre Kert\u00e9sz]], a Holocaust survivor, feels it is impossible for life in a Nazi concentration camp to be accurately portrayed by anyone who did not experience it first-hand. While commending Spielberg for bringing the story to a wide audience, he found the film's final scene at the graveyard neglected the terrible after-effects of the experience on the survivors and implied that they came through emotionally unscathed.{{sfn|Kert\u00e9sz|2001}} Rabbi [[Uri D. Herscher]] found the film an \"appealing\" and \"uplifting\" demonstration of humanitarianism.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=440}} Norbert Friedman noted that, like many Holocaust survivors, he reacted with a feeling of solidarity towards Spielberg of a sort normally reserved for other survivors.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=136}} [[Albert L.

The telecast was the first to receive a TV-M (now [[TV-MA]]) rating under the [[Television content rating systems|TV Parental Guidelines]] that had been established earlier that year.{{sfn|Chuang|1997}} [[Tom Coburn]], then an [[Oklahoma]] congressman, said that in airing the film, NBC had brought television \"to an all-time low, with full-frontal nudity, violence and profanity\", adding that it was an insult to \"decent-minded individuals everywhere\".{{sfn|''Chicago Tribune''|1997}} Under fire from both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], Coburn apologized, saying, \"My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've gone about saying what I wanted to say.\" He clarified his opinion, stating that the film ought to have been aired later at night when there would not be \"large numbers of children watching without parental supervision\".{{sfn|CNN|1997}}\n\nControversy arose in Germany for the film's television premiere on [[ProSieben]]. Protests among the Jewish community ensued when the station intended to televise it with two commercial breaks of 3\u20134 minutes each. [[Ignatz Bubis]], head of the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]], said: \"It is problematic to interrupt such a movie by commercials\".{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}} Jerzy Kanal, chairman of the Jewish Community of Berlin, added \"It is obvious that the film could have a greater impact [on society] when broadcast unimpeded by commercials. The station has to do everything possible to broadcast the film without interruption.\"{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}} As a compromise, the broadcast included one break consisting of a short news update framed with commercials. [[ProSieben]] was also obliged to broadcast two accompanying documentaries to the film, showing \"The daily lives of the Jews in Hebron and New York\" prior to broadcast and \"The survivors of the Holocaust\" afterwards.{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}}\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], chief censor Henrietta Mendez ordered cuts of three scenes depicting [[sexual intercourse]] and female nudity before the movie could be shown in theaters. Spielberg refused, and pulled the film from screening in Philippine cinemas, which prompted the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] to demand the abolition of the censorship board. [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]] himself intervened, ruling that the movie could be shown uncut to anyone over the age of 15.{{sfn|Branigin|1994}}\n\nAccording to [[Slovak people|Slovak]] filmmaker [[Juraj Herz]], the scene in which a group of women confuse an actual shower with a gas chamber is taken directly, shot by shot, from his film ''Zastihla m\u011b noc'' (''Night Caught Up with Me'', 1986). Herz wanted to sue, but was unable to fund the case.{{sfn|Kosulicova|2002}}\n\nThe song ''Yerushalayim Shel Zahav'' (\"[[Jerusalem of Gold]]\") is featured in the film's soundtrack and plays near the end of the film. This caused some controversy in Israel, as the song (which was written in 1967 by [[Naomi Shemer]]) is widely considered an informal anthem of the Israeli victory in the [[Six-Day War]]. In Israeli prints of the film the song was replaced with ''Halikha LeKesariya'' (\"A Walk to Caesarea\") by [[Hannah Szenes]], a World War II resistance fighter.{{sfn|Bresheeth|1997|p=205}}\n\n== Effect on Krak\u00f3w ==\nDue to the increased interest in Krak\u00f3w created by the film, the city bought [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory]] in 2007 to create a permanent exhibition about the German occupation of the city from 1939 to 1945. The museum opened in June 2010.{{sfn|Pavo Travel|2014}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[1993 in film]]\n* [[List of Holocaust films]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist\n| notes =\n{{efn\n| name = Score\n| Williams

It is based on the novel ''[[Schindler's Ark]]'' by [[Australia]]n novelist [[Thomas Keneally]]. The film follows [[Oskar Schindler]], a [[Sudeten German]] businessman who together with his wife [[Emilie Schindler]] saved more than a thousand mostly [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] refugees from [[the Holocaust]] by employing them in his factories during [[World War II]]. It stars [[Liam Neeson]] as Schindler, [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer [[Amon G\u00f6th]], and [[Ben Kingsley]] as Schindler's Jewish accountant [[Itzhak Stern]].\n\nIdeas for a film about the ''[[Schindlerjuden]]'' (Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963. [[Poldek Pfefferberg]], one of the ''Schindlerjuden'', made it his life's mission to tell Schindler's story. Spielberg became interested when executive [[Sidney Sheinberg]] sent him a book review of ''Schindler's Ark''. [[Universal Pictures]] bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several directors before deciding to direct it.\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland, over 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot in [[black and white]] and approached the film as a documentary. Cinematographer [[Janusz Kami\u0144ski]] wanted to create a sense of timelessness. [[John Williams]] composed the score, and violinist [[Itzhak Perlman]] performed the main theme.\n\n''Schindler's List'' [[Film premiere|premiered]] on November 30, 1993, in [[Washington, D.C.]] and was released on December 15, 1993, in the United States. Often listed among the [[greatest films ever made]],{{sfn|Corliss|Schickel|2005}}{{sfn|Maltin|1999}}{{sfn|Channel 4|2008}}<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.afi.com/100years/movies10.aspx|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|title=AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies \u2013 10th Anniversary Edition|date=June 20, 2007|accessdate=November 24, 2018}}</ref> it was also a box office success, earning $322 million worldwide on a $22 million budget. It was nominated for twelve [[Academy Awards]], winning seven, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and won numerous other awards, including seven [[BAFTA]]s and three [[Golden Globe]]s. In 2007, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked ''Schindler's List'' 8th on its [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|list of the 100 best American films]] of all time. The [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 2004.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Krak\u00f3w]] during [[World War II]], the Germans have forced local [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] into the overcrowded [[Krak\u00f3w Ghetto]]. [[Oskar Schindler]], an [[ethnic German]] from [[Czechoslovakia]], arrives in the city hoping to make his fortune. A member of the [[Nazi Party]], Schindler lavishes bribes on [[Wehrmacht]] (German armed forces) and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officials and acquires [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory|a factory]] to produce [[enamelware]]. To help him run the business, Schindler enlists the aid of [[Itzhak Stern]], a local Jewish official who has contacts with [[black market]]eers and the Jewish business community. Stern helps Schindler arrange financing for the factory. Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys wealth and status as \"Herr Direktor\", and Stern handles administration. Schindler hires Jewish workers because they cost less, while Stern ensures that as many people as possible are deemed essential to the German war effort, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps or killed.\n\nSS-''[[Untersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' (second lieutenant) [[Amon G\u00f6th]] arrives in Krak\u00f3w to oversee construction of [[Krak\u00f3w-P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp|P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp]]. When the camp is completed, he orders the ghetto liquidated. Many people are shot and killed in the process of emptying the ghetto. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a young girl in a red coat as she hides from the Nazis, and later sees her body among a wagonload of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with G\u00f6th and, through bribery and lavish gifts, continues to enjoy SS support. G\u00f6th brutally mistreats his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa, and the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes G\u00f6th into allowing him to build a sub-camp.\n\nAs the Germans begin to lose the war, G\u00f6th is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at P\u0142asz\u00f3w to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Schindler asks G\u00f6th to allow him to move his workers to a [[Br\u00fcnnlitz labor camp|new munitions factory]] he plans to build in [[Brn\u011bnec|Br\u00fcnnlitz]] near his home town [[Svitavy|Zwittau]]. G\u00f6th agrees, but charges a huge bribe. Schindler and Stern create \"Schindler's List\" \u2013 a list of about 850 people to be transferred to Brinnlitz and thus saved from transport to Auschwitz.\n\nAs the Jewish workers are transported by train to [[Brn\u011bnec|Br\u00fcnnlitz]], the one carrying the women and girls is accidentally redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss]], the commandant of Auschwitz, with a bag of diamonds to win their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the factory floor without special permission and encourages the Jews to observe the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]]. Over the next seven months, he spends much of his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies; due to Schindler's own machinations, the factory does not produce any usable armaments during this period. Schindler runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders, ending the war in Europe.\n\nAs a Nazi Party member and war profiteer, Schindler must flee the advancing [[Red Army]] to avoid capture. The SS guards in Schindler's factory have been ordered to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them not to, so that they can \"return to [their] families as men, instead of murderers.\" He bids farewell to his workers and prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give Schindler a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a [[Talmud]]ic quotation: \"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.\" Schindler is touched but also ashamed, as he feels he should have done even more. He breaks down sobbing, and is comforted by the workers. After he and his wife leave, the ''[[Schindlerjuden]]'' spend the night on the factory grounds and are awoken the next morning by a Soviet officer, who announces that they have been liberated. The workers leave the factory and walk to a nearby town, encountering a Red Army cavalryman who stares at them in silence when asked \"are there any Jews left?\"\n\nAn epilogue reveals that Schindler's marriage failed after the war, as did his attempts to start new businesses, while G\u00f6th was arrested, tried, and executed for crimes against humanity. Schindler was later honored by [[Yad Vashem]] for his efforts to save his workers from being put to death. In the present, many of the surviving ''Schindlerjuden'' and the actors portraying them visit Schindler's grave and place stones on its marker, the traditional Jewish sign of respect on visiting a grave. The final visitor is Liam Neeson, who lays two roses on the marker.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Liam Neeson Deauville 2012 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Liam Neeson (seen here in 2012) was cast as Oskar Schindler in the film.]]\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Oskar Schindler]]\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Itzhak Stern]]\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Amon G\u00f6th]]\n* [[Caroline Goodall]] as [[Emilie Schindler]]\n* [[Jonathan Sagall]] as [[Poldek Pfefferberg]]\n* [[Embeth Davidtz]] as Helen Hirsch\n* [[Ma\u0142gorzata Gebel]] as Wiktoria Klonowska\n* [[Mark Ivanir]] as Marcel Goldberg\n* [[Beatrice Macola]] as Ingrid\n* [[Andrzej Seweryn]] as [[Julian Scherner]]\n* [[Friedrich von Thun]] as Rolf Czurda\n* [[Jerzy Nowak]] as Investor\n* [[Norbert Weisser]] as Albert Hujar\n* [[Anna Mucha]] as Danka Dresner\n* Adi Nitzan as Mila Pfefferberg\n* [[Piotr Polk]] as [[Leo Rosner]]\n* [[Rami Heuberger]] as [[Joseph Bau]]\n* [[Ezra Dagan]] as Rabbi Menasha Lewartow\n* [[Elina L\u00f6wensohn]] as [[Diana Reiter]]\n* Hans-J\u00f6rg Assmann as [[Julius Madritsch]]\n* [[Hans-Michael Rehberg]] as [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss|Rudolf H\u00f6\u00df]]\n* Daniel Del Ponte as [[Josef Mengele]]\n* [[August Schm\u00f6lzer]] as Dieter Reeder\n* [[Ludger Pistor]] as [[Josef Leipold]]{{efn|The film incorrectly spells Leipold's name as \"Josef Liepold\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/152059321@N07/|title=\"Schindler's List\" credits still| accessdate= August 7, 2018|last=Hughes |first=Katie |publisher=Flickr|date=August 7, 2018}}</ref>}}\n* Oliwia D\u0105browska as [[#The girl in red|the Girl in Red]]\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nPfefferberg, one of the ''Schindlerjuden'', made it his life's mission to tell the story of his savior. Pfefferberg attempted to produce a [[biopic]] of Oskar Schindler with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] in 1963, with [[Howard Koch (screenwriter)|Howard Koch]] writing, but the deal fell through.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=425}}{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=557}} In 1982, Thomas Keneally published his historical novel ''[[Schindler's Ark]]'', which he wrote after a chance meeting with Pfefferberg in Los Angeles in 1980.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=6}} [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] president [[Sidney Sheinberg|Sid Sheinberg]] sent director Steven Spielberg a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' review of the book. Spielberg, astounded by Schindler's story, jokingly asked if it was true. \"I was drawn to it because of the paradoxical nature of the character,\" he said. \"What would drive a man like this to suddenly take everything he had earned and put it all in the service of saving these lives?\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=424}} Spielberg expressed enough interest for Universal Pictures to buy the rights to the novel.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=424}} At their first meeting in spring 1983, he told Pfefferberg he would start filming in ten years.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} In the end credits of the film, Pfefferberg is credited as a consultant under the name Leopold Page.{{sfn|Freer|2001|p=220}}\n\n[[File:Krakow Ghetto 39066.jpg|thumb|left|The liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto in March 1943 is the subject of a 15-minute segment of the film.]]\n\nSpielberg was unsure if he was mature enough to make a film about the Holocaust, and the project remained \"on [his] guilty conscience\".{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} Spielberg tried to pass the project to director [[Roman Polanski]], who turned it down. Polanski's mother was killed at Auschwitz, and he had lived in and survived the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} Polanski eventually directed his own Holocaust drama ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'' (2002). Spielberg also offered the film to [[Sydney Pollack]] and [[Martin Scorsese]], who was attached to direct ''Schindler's List'' in 1988. However, Spielberg was unsure of letting Scorsese direct the film, as \"I'd given away a chance to do something for my children and family about the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Spielberg offered him the chance to direct the [[Cape Fear (1991 film)|1991 remake of ''Cape Fear'']] instead.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=603}} [[Billy Wilder]] expressed an interest in directing the film as a memorial to his family, most of whom were murdered in the Holocaust.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} [[Brian De Palma]] also turned down an offer to direct.{{sfn|Power|2018}}\n\nSpielberg finally decided to take on the project when he noticed that [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] were being given serious consideration by the media. With the rise of [[neo-Nazism]] after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], he worried that people were too accepting of intolerance, as they were in the 1930s.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} Sid Sheinberg greenlit the film on condition that Spielberg made ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' first. Spielberg later said, \"He knew that once I had directed ''Schindler'' I wouldn't be able to do ''Jurassic Park''.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} The picture was assigned a small budget of $22 million, as Holocaust films are not usually profitable.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=27}}{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} Spielberg forwent a salary for the film, calling it \"[[Blood money (restitution)|blood money]]\",{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} and believed the film would flop.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}}\n\nIn 1983, Keneally was hired to adapt his book, and he turned in a 220-page script. His adaptation focused on Schindler's numerous relationships, and Keneally admitted he did not compress the story enough. Spielberg hired [[Kurt Luedtke]], who had adapted the screenplay of ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'', to write the next draft. Luedtke gave up almost four years later, as he found Schindler's change of heart too unbelievable.{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} During his time as director, Scorsese hired [[Steven Zaillian]] to write a script. When he was handed back the project, Spielberg found Zaillian's 115-page draft too short, and asked him to extend it to 195 pages. Spielberg wanted more focus on the Jews in the story, and he wanted Schindler's transition to be gradual and ambiguous, not a sudden breakthrough or epiphany. He extended the ghetto liquidation sequence, as he \"felt very strongly that the sequence had to be almost unwatchable.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nNeeson auditioned as Schindler early on, and was cast in December 1992, after Spielberg saw him perform in ''[[Anna Christie]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].{{sfn|Palowski|1998|pp=86\u201387}} [[Warren Beatty]] participated in a script reading, but Spielberg was concerned that he could not disguise his accent and that he would bring \"movie star baggage\".{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} [[Kevin Costner]] and [[Mel Gibson]] expressed interest in portraying Schindler, but Spielberg preferred to cast the relatively unknown Neeson, so the actor's star quality would not overpower the character.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=86}} Neeson felt Schindler enjoyed outsmarting the Nazis, who regarded him as a bit of a buffoon. \"They don't quite take him seriously, and he used that to full effect.\"{{sfn|''Entertainment Weekly'', January 21, 1994}} To help him prepare for the role, Spielberg showed Neeson film clips of [[Time Warner]] [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Steve Ross (Time Warner CEO)|Steve Ross]], who had a charisma that Spielberg compared to Schindler's.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=429}} He also located a tape of Schindler speaking, which Neeson studied to learn the correct intonations and pitch.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=87}}\n\nFiennes was cast as Amon G\u00f6th after Spielberg viewed his performances in ''[[A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia]]'' and ''[[Emily Bront\u00eb's Wuthering Heights]]''. Spielberg said of Fiennes' audition that \"I saw sexual evil. It is all about subtlety: there were moments of kindness that would move across his eyes and then instantly run cold.\"{{sfn|Corliss|1994}} Fiennes put on {{convert|28|lb}} to play the role. He watched historic [[newsreel]]s and talked to Holocaust survivors who knew G\u00f6th. In portraying him, Fiennes said \"I got close to his pain. Inside him is a fractured, miserable human being. I feel split about him, sorry for him. He's like some dirty, battered doll I was given and that I came to feel peculiarly attached to.\"{{sfn|Corliss|1994}} Doctors Samuel J. Leistedt and Paul Linkowski of the [[Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles]] describe G\u00f6th's character in the film as a classic [[psychopath]].{{sfn|Leistedt|Linkowski|2014}} Fiennes looked so much like G\u00f6th in costume that when Mila Pfefferberg met him, she trembled with fear.{{sfn|Corliss|1994}}\n\nThe character of [[Itzhak Stern]] (played by Ben Kingsley) is a composite of the accountant Stern, factory manager [[Abraham Bankier]], and G\u00f6th's personal secretary, [[Mietek Pemper]].{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=102}} The character serves as Schindler's alter ego and conscience.{{sfn|Freer|2001|p=225}} Kingsley is best known for his Academy Award-winning performance as [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] in the [[Gandhi (film)|1982 biographical film]].{{sfn|Palowski|1998|pp=87\u201388}}\n\nOverall, there are 126 speaking parts in the film. Thousands of extras were hired during filming.{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Spielberg cast Israeli and Polish actors specially chosen for their Eastern European appearance.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=128}} Many of the German actors were reluctant to don the SS uniform, but some of them later thanked Spielberg for the cathartic experience of performing in the movie.{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} Halfway through the shoot, Spielberg conceived the epilogue, where 128 survivors pay their respects at Schindler's grave in Jerusalem. The producers scrambled to find the ''Schindlerjuden'' and fly them in to film the scene.{{sfn|Thompson|1994}}\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 1, 1993 in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]], with a planned schedule of 75 days.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=48}} The crew shot at or near the actual locations, though the P\u0142asz\u00f3w camp had to be reconstructed in a nearby abandoned quarry, as modern high rise apartments were visible from the site of the original camp.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=431}}{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=14}} Interior shots of the enamelware factory in Krak\u00f3w were filmed at a similar facility in [[Olkusz]], while exterior shots and the scenes on the factory stairs were filmed at the actual factory.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|pp=109, 111}} The production received permission from Polish authorities to film on the grounds of the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]], but objections to filming within the actual death camp were raised by the [[World Jewish Congress]].<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/us/jews-try-to-halt-auschwitz-filming.html | work=The New York Times | agency = Reuters | first= | last= | title=Jews Try To Halt Auschwitz Filming | date=January 17, 1993 |accessdate = April 12, 2020}}</ref> To avoid filming inside the actual death camp, the film crew constructed a replica of a portion of the camp just outside the entrance of Birkenau.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=62}} \n\nThere were some [[antisemitic]] incidents. A woman who encountered Fiennes in his Nazi uniform told him that \"the Germans were charming people. They didn't kill anybody who didn't deserve it\".{{sfn|Corliss|1994}} Antisemitic symbols were scrawled on billboards near shooting locations,{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} while Kingsley nearly entered a brawl with an elderly German-speaking businessman who insulted Israeli actor Michael Schneider.{{sfn|Ansen|Kuflik|1993}} Nonetheless, Spielberg stated that at [[Passover]], \"all the German actors showed up. They put on [[Kippah|yarmulkes]] and opened up [[Haggadah|Haggadas]], and the Israeli actors moved right next to them and began explaining it to them. And this family of actors sat around and race and culture were just left behind.\"{{sfn|Ansen|Kuflik|1993}}\n\n{{Quote box |width=30% |align=right |quote=I was hit in the face with my personal life.

He was surprised that he did not cry while visiting Auschwitz; instead he found himself filled with outrage. He was one of many crew members who could not force themselves to watch during shooting of the scene where aging Jews are forced to run naked while being selected by Nazi doctors to go to Auschwitz.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=433}} Spielberg commented that he felt more like a reporter than a film maker \u2013 he would set up scenes and then watch events unfold, almost as though he were witnessing them rather than creating a movie.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=431}} Several actresses broke down when filming the shower scene, including one who was born in a concentration camp.{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} Spielberg, his wife [[Kate Capshaw]], and their five children rented a house in suburban Krak\u00f3w for the duration of filming.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=44}} He later thanked his wife \"for rescuing me ninety-two days in a row&nbsp;... when things just got too unbearable\".{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=415}} [[Robin Williams]] called Spielberg to cheer him up, given the profound lack of humor on the set.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=415}}\n\nSpielberg spent several hours each evening editing ''Jurassic Park'', which was scheduled to premiere in June 1993.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=45}}\n\nSpielberg occasionally used [[German language|German]] and [[Polish language]] dialogue to create a sense of realism. He initially considered making the film entirely in those languages, but decided \"there's too much safety in reading {{interp|subtitles}}. It would have been an excuse {{interp|for the audience}} to take their eyes off the screen and watch something else.\"{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}}\n\n=== Cinematography ===\nInfluenced by the 1985 documentary film ''[[Shoah (film)|Shoah]]'', Spielberg decided not to plan the film with [[storyboard]]s, and to shoot it like a documentary. Forty percent of the film was shot with handheld cameras, and the modest budget meant the film was shot quickly over seventy-two days.{{sfn|McBride|1997|pp=431\u2013432, 434}} Spielberg felt that this gave the film \"a spontaneity, an edge, and it also serves the subject.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} He filmed without using [[Steadicam]]s, elevated shots, or [[zoom lens]]es, \"everything that for me might be considered a safety net.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} This matured Spielberg, who felt that in the past he had always been paying tribute to directors such as [[Cecil B. DeMille]] or [[David Lean]].{{sfn|Ansen|Kuflik|1993}}\n\nThe decision to shoot the film mainly in [[black and white]] contributed to the documentary style of cinematography, which cinematographer Janusz Kami\u0144ski compared to [[German Expressionism]] and [[Italian neorealism]].{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} Kami\u0144ski said that he wanted to give the impression of timelessness to the film, so the audience would \"not have a sense of when it was made.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=431}} Spielberg decided to use black and white to match the feel of actual documentary footage of the era.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} Universal chairman Tom Pollock asked him to shoot the film on a color [[Original camera negative|negative]], to allow color VHS copies of the film to later be sold, but Spielberg did not want to accidentally \"beautify events.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}}\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Schindler's List (soundtrack)}}\nJohn Williams, who frequently collaborates with Spielberg, composed the score for ''Schindler's List''.

But they're all dead!\"{{sfn|Gangel|2005}} [[Itzhak Perlman]] performs the theme on the violin.{{sfn|Freer|2001|p=220}}\n\nIn the scene where the ghetto is being liquidated by the Nazis, the folk song ''[[Oyfn Pripetshik]]'' ({{lang-yi|\u05d0\u05d5\u05d9\u05e4\u05bf\u05df \u05e4\u05bc\u05e8\u05d9\u05e4\u05bc\u05e2\u05d8\u05e9\u05d9\u05e7}}, 'On the Cooking Stove') is sung by a children's choir. The song was often sung by Spielberg's grandmother, Becky, to her grandchildren.{{sfn|Rubin|2001|pp=73\u201374}} The [[clarinet]] solos heard in the film were recorded by [[Klezmer]] virtuoso [[Giora Feidman]].{{sfn|Medien|2011}} Williams won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] for ''Schindler's List'', his fifth win.{{sfn|66th Academy Awards|1994}} Selections from the score were released on a [[Schindler's List (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]].{{sfn|AllMusic listing}}\n\n== Themes and symbolism ==\nThe film explores the theme of [[good versus evil]], using as its main protagonist a \"good German\", a popular characterization in American cinema.{{sfn|Loshitsky|1997|p=5}}{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} While G\u00f6th is characterized as an almost completely dark and evil person, Schindler gradually evolves from Nazi supporter to rescuer and hero.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=428}} Thus a second theme of redemption is introduced as Schindler, a disreputable schemer on the edges of respectability, becomes a father figure responsible for saving the lives of more than a thousand people.{{sfn|Loshitsky|1997|p=43}}{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=436}}\n\n=== The girl in red ===\n[[File:Schindlers list red dress.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|Schindler sees a girl in red during the liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w ghetto. The red coat is one of the few instances of color used in this predominantly black and white film.]]\nWhile the film is shot primarily in black and white, a red coat is used to distinguish a little girl in the scene depicting the liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w ghetto. Later in the film, Schindler sees her exhumed dead body, recognizable only by the red coat she is still wearing. Spielberg said the scene was intended to symbolize how members of the highest levels of government in the United States knew the Holocaust was occurring, yet did nothing to stop it. \"It was as obvious as a little girl wearing a red coat, walking down the street, and yet nothing was done to bomb the German rail lines. Nothing was being done to slow down&nbsp;... the annihilation of European Jewry,\" he said. \"So that was my message in letting that scene be in color.\"{{sfn|Schickel|2012|pp=161\u2013162}} Andy Patrizio of [[IGN]] notes that the point at which Schindler sees the girl's dead body is the point at which he changes, no longer seeing \"the ash and soot of burning corpses piling up on his car as just an annoyance.\"{{sfn|Patrizio|2004}} Professor [[Andr\u00e9 H. Caron]] of the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] wonders if the red symbolises \"innocence, hope or the red blood of the Jewish people being sacrificed in the horror of the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|Caron|2003}}\n\nThe girl was portrayed by Oliwia D\u0105browska, three years old at the time of filming. Spielberg asked D\u0105browska not to watch the film until she was eighteen, but she watched it when she was eleven, and says she was \"horrified\".{{sfn|Gilman|2013}} Upon seeing the film again as an adult, she was proud of the role she played.{{sfn|Gilman|2013}} Although it was unintentional, the character is similar to [[Roma Ligocka]], who was known in the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto for her red coat. Ligocka, unlike her fictional counterpart, survived the Holocaust. After the film was released, she wrote and published her own story, ''[[The Girl in the Red Coat]]: A Memoir'' (2002, in translation).{{sfn|Ligocka|2002}} The girl in red may have been inspired by Krak\u00f3w resident Genya Gitel Chil, according to a 2014 interview of her family members.{{sfn|Rosner|2014}}\n\n=== Candles ===\nThe opening scene features a family observing [[Shabbat]]. Spielberg said that \"to start the film with the candles being lit&nbsp;... would be a rich bookend, to start the film with a normal Shabbat service before the juggernaut against the Jews begins.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} When the color fades out in the film's opening moments, it gives way to a world in which smoke comes to symbolize bodies being burnt at Auschwitz. Only at the end, when Schindler allows his workers to hold Shabbat services, do the images of candle fire regain their warmth. For Spielberg, they represent \"just a glint of color, and a glimmer of hope.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Sara Horowitz, director of the Koschitzky Centre for Jewish Studies at [[York University]], sees the candles as a symbol for the Jews of Europe, killed and then burned in the [[crematoria]]. The two scenes bracket the Nazi era, marking its beginning and end.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=124}} She points out that normally the woman of the house lights the Sabbath candles. In the film it is men who perform this ritual, demonstrating not only the subservient role of women, but also the subservient position of Jewish men in relation to [[Aryan race|Aryan]] men, especially G\u00f6th and Schindler.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|pp=126\u2013127}}\n\n=== Other symbolism ===\nTo Spielberg, the black and white presentation of the film came to represent the Holocaust itself: \"The Holocaust was life without light. For me the symbol of life is color. That's why a film about the Holocaust has to be in black-and-white.\"{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=112}} Robert Gellately notes the film in its entirety can be seen as a metaphor for the Holocaust, with early sporadic violence increasing into a crescendo of death and destruction. He also notes a parallel between the situation of the Jews in the film and the debate in [[Nazi Germany]] between making use of the Jews for [[slave labor]] or exterminating them outright.{{sfn|Gellately|1993}} Water is seen as giving deliverance by Alan Mintz, Holocaust Studies professor at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York. He notes its presence in the scene where Schindler arranges for a [[Holocaust train]] loaded with victims awaiting transport to be hosed down, and the scene in Auschwitz, where the women are given an actual shower instead of receiving the expected gassing.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=154}}\n\n== Release ==\nThe film opened on December 15, 1993. By the time it closed in theaters on September 29, 1994, it had grossed $96.1 million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|96100000|1993}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars){{inflation-fn|US}} in the United States and over $321.2 million worldwide.{{sfn|Freer|2001|p=233}} In Germany, where it was shown in 500 theaters, the film was viewed by over 100,000 people in its first week alone{{sfn|Loshitsky|1997|pp=9, 14}} and was eventually seen by six million people.{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}} The film was popular in Germany and a success worldwide.{{sfn|Loshitsky|1997|pp=11, 14}}\n\n''Schindler's List'' made its U.S. network television premiere on [[NBC]] on February 23, 1997.

Spielberg's most intense and personal film to date\".{{sfn|Maltin|2013|p=1216}} James Verniere of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' noted the film's restraint and lack of sensationalism, and called it a \"major addition to the body of work about the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|Verniere|1993}} In his review for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', British critic [[John Gross]] said his misgivings that the story would be overly sentimentalized \"were altogether misplaced. Spielberg shows a firm moral and emotional grasp of his material. The film is an outstanding achievement.\"{{sfn|Gross|1994}} Mintz notes that even the film's harshest critics admire the \"visual brilliance\" of the fifteen-minute segment depicting the liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w ghetto. He describes the sequence as \"realistic\" and \"stunning\".{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=147}} He points out that the film has done much to increase Holocaust remembrance and awareness as the remaining survivors pass away, severing the last living links with the catastrophe.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=131}} The film's release in Germany led to widespread discussion about why most Germans did not do more to help.{{sfn|''Houston Post''|1994}}\n\nCriticism of the film also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=134}} Horowitz points out that much of the Jewish activity seen in the ghetto consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading on the black market, or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|pp=138\u2013139}} Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and sexuality is not explored further.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=130}} History professor [[Omer Bartov]] of [[Brown University]] notes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and G\u00f6th overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened \u2013 a mere backdrop to the struggle of good versus evil.{{sfn|Bartov|1997|p=49}}\n\nHorowitz points out that the film's dichotomy of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=137}} Author [[Jason Epstein]] commented that the movie gives the impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case.{{sfn|Epstein|1994}} Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=439}}\n\nBartov wrote that the \"positively repulsive kitsch of the last two scenes seriously undermines much of the film's previous merits\". He describes the humanization of Schindler as \"banal\", and is critical of what he describes as the \"[[Zionist]] closure\" set to the song \"[[Jerusalem of Gold]]\".{{sfn|Bartov|1997|p=45}}\n\n=== Assessment by other filmmakers ===\n''Schindler's List'' was very well received by many of Spielberg's peers. Filmmaker Billy Wilder wrote to Spielberg saying, \"They couldn't have gotten a better man. This movie is absolutely perfection.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} Polanski, who turned down the chance to direct the film, later commented, \"I certainly wouldn't have done as good a job as Spielberg because I couldn't have been as objective as he was.\"{{sfn|Cronin|2005|p=168}} He cited ''Schindler's List'' as an influence on his 1995 film ''[[Death and the Maiden (film)|Death and the Maiden]]''.{{sfn|Cronin|2005|p=167}} The success of ''Schindler's List'' led filmmaker [[Stanley Kubrick]] to abandon his own Holocaust project, ''[[Wartime Lies|Aryan Papers]]'', which would have been about a Jewish boy and his aunt who survive the war by sneaking through Poland while pretending to be Catholic.{{sfn|Goldman|2005}} According to scriptwriter [[Frederic Raphael]], when he suggested to Kubrick that ''Schindler's List'' was a good representation of the Holocaust, Kubrick commented, \"Think that's about the Holocaust? That was about success, wasn't it? The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. ''Schindler's List'' is about 600 who don't.\"{{sfn|Goldman|2005}}{{efn|Schindler is actually credited with saving more than 1,200 Jews.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8578020/Mietek-Pemper.html|title=Mietek Pemper: Obituary|date=June 15, 2011|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=March 16, 2016}}</ref>}}\n\nFilmmaker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] accused Spielberg of using the film to make a profit out of a tragedy while Schindler's wife, [[Emilie Schindler]], lived in poverty in [[Argentina]].{{sfn|Ebert|2002}} Keneally disputed claims that she was never paid for her contributions, \"not least because I had recently sent Emilie a check myself.\"{{sfn|Keneally|2007|p=265}} He also confirmed with Spielberg's office that payment had been sent from there.{{sfn|Keneally|2007|p=265}} Filmmaker [[Michael Haneke]] criticized the sequence in which Schindler's women are accidentally sent off to Auschwitz and herded into showers: \"There's a scene in that film when we don't know if there's gas or water coming out in the showers in the camp. You can only do something like that with a naive audience like in the United States. It's not an appropriate use of the form. Spielberg meant well \u2013 but it was dumb.\"{{sfn|Haneke|2009}}\n\nThe film was criticized by filmmaker and lecturer [[Claude Lanzmann]], director of the nine-hour Holocaust film [[Shoah (film)|''Shoah'']], who called ''Schindler's List'' a \"kitschy melodrama\" and a \"deformation\" of historical truth. \"Fiction is a transgression, I am deeply convinced that there is a ban on depiction [of the Holocaust]\", he said. Lanzmann also criticized Spielberg for viewing the Holocaust through the eyes of a German, saying \"it is the world in reverse.\" He complained, \"I sincerely thought that there was a time before ''Shoah'', and a time after ''Shoah'', and that after ''Shoah'' certain things could no longer be done. Spielberg did them anyway.\"{{sfn|Lanzmann|2007}}\n\n=== Reaction of the Jewish community ===\nAt a 1994 ''[[Village Voice]]'' symposium about the film, historian Annette Insdorf described how her mother, a survivor of three concentration camps, felt gratitude that the Holocaust story was finally being told in a major film that would be widely viewed.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|pp=136\u2013137}} [[Hungarian Jews|Hungarian Jewish]] author [[Imre Kert\u00e9sz]], a Holocaust survivor, feels it is impossible for life in a Nazi concentration camp to be accurately portrayed by anyone who did not experience it first-hand. While commending Spielberg for bringing the story to a wide audience, he found the film's final scene at the graveyard neglected the terrible after-effects of the experience on the survivors and implied that they came through emotionally unscathed.{{sfn|Kert\u00e9sz|2001}} Rabbi [[Uri D. Herscher]] found the film an \"appealing\" and \"uplifting\" demonstration of humanitarianism.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=440}} Norbert Friedman noted that, like many Holocaust survivors, he reacted with a feeling of solidarity towards Spielberg of a sort normally reserved for other survivors.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=136}} [[Albert L. Lewis]], Spielberg's childhood rabbi and teacher, described the movie as \"Steven's gift to his mother, to his people, and in a sense to himself. Now he is a full human being.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=440}}\n\n=== Accolades ===\n''Schindler's List'' featured on a number of \"best of\" lists, including the ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine's Top Hundred as selected by critics [[Richard Corliss]] and [[Richard Schickel]],{{sfn|Corliss|Schickel|2005}} ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine's 100 Greatest Films Centenary Poll conducted in 1995,{{sfn|''Time Out'' Film Guide|1995}} and Leonard Maltin's \"100 Must See Movies of the Century\".{{sfn|Maltin|1999}} The [[Holy See|Vatican]] named ''Schindler's List'' among the most important 45 films ever made.{{sfn|Greydanus|1995}} A [[Channel 4]] poll named ''Schindler's List'' the ninth greatest film of all time,{{sfn|Channel 4|2008}} and it ranked fourth in their 2005 war films poll.{{sfn|Channel 4|2005}} The film was named the best of 1993 by critics such as [[James Berardinelli]],{{sfn|Berardinelli|1993}} Roger Ebert,{{sfn|Ebert|1993b}} and [[Gene Siskel]].{{sfn|Johnson|2011}} Deeming the film \"culturally significant\", the [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 2004.{{sfn|Library of Congress|2004}} Spielberg won the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film]] for his work,{{sfn|CBC|2013}} and shared the [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]] with co-producers Branko Lustig and Gerald R.

The telecast was the first to receive a TV-M (now [[TV-MA]]) rating under the [[Television content rating systems|TV Parental Guidelines]] that had been established earlier that year.{{sfn|Chuang|1997}} [[Tom Coburn]], then an [[Oklahoma]] congressman, said that in airing the film, NBC had brought television \"to an all-time low, with full-frontal nudity, violence and profanity\", adding that it was an insult to \"decent-minded individuals everywhere\".{{sfn|''Chicago Tribune''|1997}} Under fire from both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], Coburn apologized, saying, \"My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've gone about saying what I wanted to say.\" He clarified his opinion, stating that the film ought to have been aired later at night when there would not be \"large numbers of children watching without parental supervision\".{{sfn|CNN|1997}}\n\nControversy arose in Germany for the film's television premiere on [[ProSieben]]. Protests among the Jewish community ensued when the station intended to televise it with two commercial breaks of 3\u20134 minutes each. [[Ignatz Bubis]], head of the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]], said: \"It is problematic to interrupt such a movie by commercials\".{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}} Jerzy Kanal, chairman of the Jewish Community of Berlin, added \"It is obvious that the film could have a greater impact [on society] when broadcast unimpeded by commercials. The station has to do everything possible to broadcast the film without interruption.\"{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}} As a compromise, the broadcast included one break consisting of a short news update framed with commercials. [[ProSieben]] was also obliged to broadcast two accompanying documentaries to the film, showing \"The daily lives of the Jews in Hebron and New York\" prior to broadcast and \"The survivors of the Holocaust\" afterwards.{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}}\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], chief censor Henrietta Mendez ordered cuts of three scenes depicting [[sexual intercourse]] and female nudity before the movie could be shown in theaters. Spielberg refused, and pulled the film from screening in Philippine cinemas, which prompted the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] to demand the abolition of the censorship board. [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]] himself intervened, ruling that the movie could be shown uncut to anyone over the age of 15.{{sfn|Branigin|1994}}\n\nAccording to [[Slovak people|Slovak]] filmmaker [[Juraj Herz]], the scene in which a group of women confuse an actual shower with a gas chamber is taken directly, shot by shot, from his film ''Zastihla m\u011b noc'' (''Night Caught Up with Me'', 1986). Herz wanted to sue, but was unable to fund the case.{{sfn|Kosulicova|2002}}\n\nThe song ''Yerushalayim Shel Zahav'' (\"[[Jerusalem of Gold]]\") is featured in the film's soundtrack and plays near the end of the film. This caused some controversy in Israel, as the song (which was written in 1967 by [[Naomi Shemer]]) is widely considered an informal anthem of the Israeli victory in the [[Six-Day War]]. In Israeli prints of the film the song was replaced with ''Halikha LeKesariya'' (\"A Walk to Caesarea\") by [[Hannah Szenes]], a World War II resistance fighter.{{sfn|Bresheeth|1997|p=205}}\n\n== Effect on Krak\u00f3w ==\nDue to the increased interest in Krak\u00f3w created by the film, the city bought [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory]] in 2007 to create a permanent exhibition about the German occupation of the city from 1939 to 1945. The museum opened in June 2010.{{sfn|Pavo Travel|2014}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[1993 in film]]\n* [[List of Holocaust films]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist\n| notes =\n{{efn\n| name = Score\n| Williams

In 1862 he sent some poems to the ''London Athenaeum'' which printed three of them and gave the author kindly praise. In the same year his first volume, ''Poems and Songs'', was published at Sydney. It was well received and eventually the whole edition of 500 copies was sold. Representations were made to the government, and in 1863 a position was found for the poet in the lands department. He was transferred to the colonial secretary's department in 1864 and appears to have discharged his duties in a conscientious way; his hours were not long and he had some leisure for literature. His salary, originally \u00a3150 a year, became increased to \u00a3250 and he was able to make a home for his mother and sisters.\n\nIn 1868 he married Charlotte Rutter, the daughter of a Sydney physician, and in the following year resigned from his position in the government service<ref name=adbthkendall/> and went to [[Melbourne]], which had become a larger city than Sydney and more of a literary centre. Kendall's decision to give up his position must at the time have seemed very unwise. But he had become financially embarrassed before his marriage on account of the extravagance of his family, and his wife found it impossible to live with his mother, who had joined the young couple. The elder Mrs Kendall was in fact practically a dipsomaniac, and the poet felt that the only chance of happiness for himself and his wife was to make a fresh start in another city. He was well received by his fellow writers, [[George Gordon McCrae]], [[Marcus Clarke]], [[Adam Lindsay Gordon]] and others, but Kendall had none of the qualities of a successful journalist, though some of his work was accepted by the press and [[George Robertson (bookseller)|George Robertson]] published his second volume, ''Leaves from Australian Forests'', soon after his arrival. The poem 'Bell-Birds', one of Australia's best-known poems, was published in that volume. The press notices were favourable, one reviewer in his enthusiasm going so far as to say that \"Swinburne, Arnold and Morris are indulgently treated if we allow them an equal measure of poetic feeling with Kendall\", but comparatively few copies were sold and the publisher made a loss.<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/kendall-thomas-henry-3941</ref>\n\nThe poet found that he could not make a living by literature and, probably by the good offices of [[George Gordon McCrae]], a temporary position was found for him in the government statist's office. Kendall, however, had no head for figures. He did his best but found his tasks hopeless. One day McCrae was called out into the passage to see Kendall, an agitated, trembling figure who told him he must go, he could not stand it any longer. Years later [[Henry Lawson]] was to write\n\n<blockquote>\"Just as in Southern climes they give<br>\nThe hard-up rhymer figures!\"</blockquote>\n\nKendall had indeed lost heart; he drifted into drinking and [[Alexander Sutherland (educator)|Alexander Sutherland]] in his essay draws a lurid picture of the depths into which the poet had fallen. It is true that he had the authority of Kendall's poem \"On a Street\", but years afterwards George Gordon McCrae told the present writer that Kendall \"made the worst of everything including himself\". McCrae had no doubt about Kendall having at times given way to excessive drinking, but stated positively that he had never actually seen him the worse for drink. McCrae was a good friend to Kendall and he had many other friends in spite of his retiring and sensitive nature. But his friends could not save him from himself, and his two years in Melbourne were among the most miserable of his life. A pathetic letter is still in existence, in which Kendall tells McCrae that he could not go to Gordon's funeral because he was penniless. In December 1870 he was charged with forging and uttering a cheque but found not guilty on the ground of insanity. Unable to support his family, he was forced back to Sydney by poverty, ill health and drunkenness.<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/kendall-thomas-henry-3941</ref> Intervals of dogged literary effort alternated with lapses into melancholia.

The original edition is now very rare.

Indeed, other omega-3 fatty acids can be synthesized by the body from ALA. It is particularly present in linseed (flaxseed) and hemp seeds.\n\n[[Eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA) can be synthesized from alpha-linolenic acid, although the conversion rate is very low. It is therefore important to consume foods rich in EPA, especially some oily fish. Populations that consume large amounts of fish (for example, the Inuit of Greenland and the Japanese) are significantly less affected by cardiovascular disease. In addition, EPA is transformed into eicosanoids of series 3, substances that contribute to the protection of the arteries and the heart and have recognized anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects.\n\n[[Docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA) is also present in marine products, especially in some oily fish. It plays a fundamental role in the development of the brain and retina as well as in the formation and motility of spermatozoa.\n\n==Omega-3 intake recommendations==\nThe World Health Organization has made recommendations regarding omega-3 intake:\nALA: 0.8 g to 1.1 g / day\nEPA + DHA: 0.3 g to 0.5 g / day\n\n==Ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats in the diets of hunter-gatherers==\nIt has been claimed that among hunter-gatherer populations, omega-3 fats and omega-6 fats are typically consumed in roughly a 1:1 ratio.<ref>\"Populations maintaining historic omega-6 to omega-3 ratios (approximately 1 to 1) are protected from many of the scourges of the modern age.\" Source: Andrew Stoll, ''The Omega-3 Connection''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2001, p. 43.</ref> At one extreme of the spectrum of hunter-gatherer diets, the [[Greenland Inuit]], prior to the late Twentieth Century, consumed a diet in which omega-6s and omega-3s were consumed in a 1:2 ratio, thanks to a diet rich in cold-water fish (which are a rich source of omega-3s) and completely devoid of omega-6-rich seed oils.<ref>William Lands, ''Fish, Omega-3 and Human Health.'' Urbana, Illinois: APCS Press, 2005, p. 10.</ref>\n\n==Optimal ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats==\nTo date, \"no one knows what the optimal ratio in the diet is for these two families of fats.\"<ref name=\"Susan Allport 2007, p. 115\">Susan Allport, ''The Queen of Fats: Why Omega-3 Fats Were Removed From the Western Diet and What We Can Do to Replace Them''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007, p. 115.</ref> Susan Allport writes that the current ratio in Japan is associated with a very low incidence of heart and other diseases. A dietary ratio of 4:1 produces almost a 1:1 ratio of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) in cell membranes.\"<ref name=\"Susan Allport 2007, p. 115\"/>{{Clarify | date = February 2019 | reason = Although this is a direct quote from the book, but it's unclear that the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 at 4:1 produces the ratio of 1:1 of what specific 'highly unsatuated fatty acids' in the membrane, making the sentence rather unhelpful. }}\n\nAndrew Stoll, who advocates the consumption of the two fats in a 1:1 ratio, states, \"Once in the body, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids follow parallel pathways, continually competing with each other for chemical conversion to various structures and molecules inside and outside the cells. Given this mechanism, it makes sense that the two fats might be required in approximately equal amounts.\"<ref name=\"Andrew Stoll 2001, p. 40\">Andrew Stoll, ''The Omega-3 Connection''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2001, p. 40.</ref>\n\nBoth Stoll and Allport assert that present-day diets in the developed world have departed dramatically from this ratio. It has been estimated that in developed countries, the ratio of Omega-6s to Omega-3s is closer to 15:1<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12442909 | year = 2002 | last1 = Simopoulos | first1 = AP | title =

Unlike [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s and [[omega-6 fatty acid]]s, [[omega\u22129 fatty acid]]s are not classed as [[essential fatty acids]] (EFA), because they can be created by the human body from [[unsaturated fat]], and are therefore not essential in the diet.\n\n==Types of omega-3 fats==\nOf the omega-3s, only [[\u03b1-linolenic acid]] (ALA) is described as \"essential\". Indeed, other omega-3 fatty acids can be synthesized by the body from ALA. It is particularly present in linseed (flaxseed) and hemp seeds.\n\n[[Eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA) can be synthesized from alpha-linolenic acid, although the conversion rate is very low. It is therefore important to consume foods rich in EPA, especially some oily fish. Populations that consume large amounts of fish (for example, the Inuit of Greenland and the Japanese) are significantly less affected by cardiovascular disease. In addition, EPA is transformed into eicosanoids of series 3, substances that contribute to the protection of the arteries and the heart and have recognized anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects.\n\n[[Docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA) is also present in marine products, especially in some oily fish. It plays a fundamental role in the development of the brain and retina as well as in the formation and motility of spermatozoa.\n\n==Omega-3 intake recommendations==\nThe World Health Organization has made recommendations regarding omega-3 intake:\nALA: 0.8 g to 1.1 g / day\nEPA + DHA: 0.3 g to 0.5 g / day\n\n==Ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats in the diets of hunter-gatherers==\nIt has been claimed that among hunter-gatherer populations, omega-3 fats and omega-6 fats are typically consumed in roughly a 1:1 ratio.<ref>\"Populations maintaining historic omega-6 to omega-3 ratios (approximately 1 to 1) are protected from many of the scourges of the modern age.\" Source: Andrew Stoll, ''The Omega-3 Connection''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2001, p. 43.</ref> At one extreme of the spectrum of hunter-gatherer diets, the [[Greenland Inuit]], prior to the late Twentieth Century, consumed a diet in which omega-6s and omega-3s were consumed in a 1:2 ratio, thanks to a diet rich in cold-water fish (which are a rich source of omega-3s) and completely devoid of omega-6-rich seed oils.<ref>William Lands, ''Fish, Omega-3 and Human Health.'' Urbana, Illinois: APCS Press, 2005, p. 10.</ref>\n\n==Optimal ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats==\nTo date, \"no one knows what the optimal ratio in the diet is for these two families of fats.\"<ref name=\"Susan Allport 2007, p. 115\">Susan Allport, ''The Queen of Fats: Why Omega-3 Fats Were Removed From the Western Diet and What We Can Do to Replace Them''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007, p. 115.</ref> Susan Allport writes that the current ratio in Japan is associated with a very low incidence of heart and other diseases. A dietary ratio of 4:1 produces almost a 1:1 ratio of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) in cell membranes.\"<ref name=\"Susan Allport 2007, p. 115\"/>{{Clarify | date = February 2019 | reason = Although this is a direct quote from the book, but it's unclear that the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 at 4:1 produces the ratio of 1:1 of what specific 'highly unsatuated fatty acids' in the membrane, making the sentence rather unhelpful. }}\n\nAndrew Stoll, who advocates the consumption of the two fats in a 1:1 ratio, states, \"Once in the body, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids follow parallel pathways, continually competing with each other for chemical conversion to various structures and molecules inside and outside the cells. Given this mechanism, it makes sense that the two fats might be required in approximately equal amounts.\"<ref name=\"Andrew Stoll 2001, p. 40\">Andrew Stoll, ''The Omega-3 Connection''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2001, p. 40.</ref>\n\nBoth Stoll and Allport assert that present-day diets in the developed world have departed dramatically from this ratio. It has been estimated that in developed countries, the ratio of Omega-6s to Omega-3s is closer to 15:1<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12442909 | year = 2002 | last1 = Simopoulos | first1 = AP | title =

It covers [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] county in [[Central Norway]] and its cathedral city is [[Trondheim]], which houses the well-known [[Nidaros Cathedral]].  The diocese is divided into 10 [[deanery|deaneries]] ''(prosti)''.  Since 10 September 2017, the Bishop of Nidaros is [[Herborg Finnset]] who took over from the Bishop [[Tor Singsaas]] who retired.  The [[Preses (Church of Norway)|Bishop Preses]] is also based at the [[Nidaros Cathedral]] and serves as the dean of the [[Nidaros domprosti]] (deanery) in [[Trondheim]]. \n\n==History==\nThe diocese of Nidaros was established in 1068. It originally covered the (modern) counties of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]], [[Nordland]], [[Troms]], and [[Finnmark]], along with the regions of [[Nordm\u00f8re]] and [[Romsdal]] (in [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]] county) and [[H\u00e4rjedalen]] (in [[Sweden]]), and also the northern part of [[\u00d8sterdalen]] ([[Tynset]], [[Tolga, Norway|Tolga]], and [[Os, Hedmark|Os]]). The region of [[Sunnm\u00f8re]] (in [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]]) was transferred from [[Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin]] to the new [[Archdiocese of Nidaros]] some time after 1152 \u2013 to secure it more income.\n\nThe northern part of \u00d8sterdalen was transferred to the [[Diocese of Oslo]] some time after 1537. The province of [[J\u00e4mtland]] was transferred from [[Diocese of Uppsala]] to Nidaros in 1570. The region of Sunnm\u00f8re was transferred (back) from Nidaros to the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1622. The provinces of J\u00e4mtland and H\u00e4rjedalen were lost to [[Sweden]] in 1645. [[Northern Norway]] was established as a diocese of its own in 1804 (formally first in 1844). The parish of [[Innset, S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag|Innset]] was transferred from [[Diocese of Hamar]] to Nidaros in 1966. The regions of Nordm\u00f8re and Romsdal (together with Sunnm\u00f8re from Bj\u00f8rgvin) were established as a diocese of its own ([[Diocese of M\u00f8re]]) in 1983.\n\n==Structure==\n{{see also|List of churches in Tr\u00f8ndelag}}\nThe Diocese of Nidaros is divided into ten [[deanery|deaneries]] ({{lang-no|Prosti}}).

It covers [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] county in [[Central Norway]] and its cathedral city is [[Trondheim]], which houses the well-known [[Nidaros Cathedral]].  The diocese is divided into 10 [[deanery|deaneries]] ''(prosti)''.  Since 10 September 2017, the Bishop of Nidaros is [[Herborg Finnset]] who took over from the Bishop [[Tor Singsaas]] who retired.  The [[Preses (Church of Norway)|Bishop Preses]] is also based at the [[Nidaros Cathedral]] and serves as the dean of the [[Nidaros domprosti]] (deanery) in [[Trondheim]]. \n\n==History==\nThe diocese of Nidaros was established in 1068. It originally covered the (modern) counties of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]], [[Nordland]], [[Troms]], and [[Finnmark]], along with the regions of [[Nordm\u00f8re]] and [[Romsdal]] (in [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]] county) and [[H\u00e4rjedalen]] (in [[Sweden]]), and also the northern part of [[\u00d8sterdalen]] ([[Tynset]], [[Tolga, Norway|Tolga]], and [[Os, Hedmark|Os]]). The region of [[Sunnm\u00f8re]] (in [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]]) was transferred from [[Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin]] to the new [[Archdiocese of Nidaros]] some time after 1152 \u2013 to secure it more income.\n\nThe northern part of \u00d8sterdalen was transferred to the [[Diocese of Oslo]] some time after 1537. The province of [[J\u00e4mtland]] was transferred from [[Diocese of Uppsala]] to Nidaros in 1570. The region of Sunnm\u00f8re was transferred (back) from Nidaros to the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1622. The provinces of J\u00e4mtland and H\u00e4rjedalen were lost to [[Sweden]] in 1645. [[Northern Norway]] was established as a diocese of its own in 1804 (formally first in 1844). The parish of [[Innset, S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag|Innset]] was transferred from [[Diocese of Hamar]] to Nidaros in 1966. The regions of Nordm\u00f8re and Romsdal (together with Sunnm\u00f8re from Bj\u00f8rgvin) were established as a diocese of its own ([[Diocese of M\u00f8re]]) in 1983.\n\n==Structure==\n{{see also|List of churches in Tr\u00f8ndelag}}\nThe Diocese of Nidaros is divided into ten [[deanery|deaneries]] ({{lang-no|Prosti}}).  Each one corresponds to several municipalities in the diocese.  Each municipality is further divided into one or more [[parish]]es which each contain one or more congregations. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Deanery (''Prosti'') !!

It is legally obliged to follow the principle of [[civilian control of the military]], although in practical terms this principle has been implemented in such a way as to ensure the PLA is under the absolute control of the Communist Party. Its [[Supreme Military Command of the People's Republic of China|commander in chief]] is the [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] (usually the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]). Since 1949, China has used nine different military strategies, which the PLA calls \"strategic guidelines\".  The most important came in 1956, 1980, and 1993.<ref name=\"M. Taylor Fravel 2019\">M.

They were then known as the [[Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army]], or simply the Red Army. Between 1934 and 1935, the Red Army survived several campaigns led against it by Chiang Kai-Shek and engaged in the [[Long March]].\n\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] from 1937 to 1945, the Communist military forces were nominally integrated into the [[National Revolutionary Army]] of the [[Republic of China]] forming two main units known as the [[Eighth Route Army]] and the [[New Fourth Army]]. During this time, these two military groups primarily employed [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]], generally avoiding large-scale battles with the Japanese with some exceptions while at the same time consolidating their ground by absorbing nationalist troops and paramilitary forces behind Japanese lines into their forces. After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, the Communist Party merged the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army, renaming the new million-strong force the \"People's Liberation Army\". They eventually won the [[Chinese Civil War]], establishing the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949. The PLA then saw a huge reorganisation with the establishment of the Air Force leadership structure in November 1949 followed by the Navy leadership the following April. In 1950, the leadership structures of the artillery, armoured troops, air defence troops, public security forces, and worker\u2013soldier militias were also established. The chemical warfare defence forces, the railroad forces, the communications forces, and the strategic forces, as well as other separate forces (like engineering and construction, logistics and medical services), were established later on, all these depended on the leadership of the Communist Party and the National People's Congress via the Central Military Commission (and until 1975 the National Defense Council).\n\n=== 1950s, 1960s and 1970s ===\n{{Further|Korean War|Sino-Indian War|Sino-Soviet border conflict}}\n\n[[File:PLA Enters Peking.jpg|thumb|PLA troops entering Beijing in 1949 during the [[Chinese Civil War]]]]\n[[File:Chinese troops leaving Korea.jpg|thumb|Chinese troops gathered on a T-34/85 or a Type 58 medium tank leaving [[North Korea]] in 1958, 5 years after the Korean War ended with an armistice (a ceasefire) in 1953.

The most important came in 1956, 1980, and 1993.<ref name=\"M. Taylor Fravel 2019\"/> Part of this process was the reorganisation that created thirteen military regions in 1955. The PLA also contained many former [[National Revolutionary Army]] units and generals who had defected to the PLA. [[Ma Hongbin]] and his son [[Ma Dunjing (1906\u20131972)|Ma Dunjing]] were the only two Muslim generals who led a Muslim unit, the 81st corps, to ever serve in the PLA. [[Han Youwen]], a Salar Muslim general, also defected to the PLA. In November 1950, some units of the PLA under the name of the [[People's Volunteer Army]] intervened in the [[Korean War]] as United Nations forces under General [[Douglas MacArthur]] approached the [[Yalu River]]. Under the weight of this offensive, Chinese forces drove MacArthur's forces out of North Korea and captured [[Seoul]], but were subsequently pushed back south of Pyongyang north of the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]]. The war also served as a catalyst for the rapid modernization of the [[PLAAF]]. In 1962, the PLA ground force also fought India in the [[Sino-Indian War]], achieving all objectives.\n\nPrior to the [[Cultural Revolution]], military region commanders tended to remain in their posts for long periods of time. As the PLA took a stronger role in politics, this began to be seen as somewhat of a threat to the party's (or, at least, civilian) control of the military. The longest-serving military region commanders were [[Xu Shiyou]] in the [[Nanjing Military Region]] (1954\u201374), [[Yang Dezhi]] in the [[Jinan Military Region]] (1958\u201374), [[Chen Xilian]] in the [[Shenyang Military Region]] (1959\u201373), and [[Han Xianchu]] in the Fuzhou Military Region (1960\u201374). The establishment of a professional military force equipped with modern weapons and doctrine was the last of the [[Four Modernizations]] announced by Zhou Enlai and supported by [[Deng Xiaoping]]. In keeping with Deng's mandate to reform, the PLA has demobilized millions of men and women since 1978 and has introduced modern methods in such areas as [[military recruitment|recruitment]] and manpower, [[military strategy|strategy]], and [[military education and training|education and training]]. In 1979, the PLA fought [[Vietnam]] over a border skirmish in the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] where both sides claimed victory.\n\nDuring the Sino-Soviet split, strained relations between China and the Soviet Union resulted in bloody border clashes and mutual backing of each other's adversaries. China and Afghanistan had neutral relations with each other during the King's rule. When the pro-Soviet Afghan Communists seized power in Afghanistan in 1978, relations between China and the Afghan communists quickly turned hostile. The Afghan pro-Soviet communists supported China's enemies in Vietnam and blamed China for supporting Afghan anti-communist militants. China responded to the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] by supporting the [[Afghan mujahideen]] and ramping up their military presence near Afghanistan in Xinjiang. China acquired military equipment from the United States to defend itself from Soviet attack.<ref>{{cite book |author=S. Frederick Starri |editor=S.

Following the [[People's Liberation Army at Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|PLA's suppression]] of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], ideological correctness was temporarily revived as the dominant theme in Chinese military affairs. Reform and modernisation have today resumed their position as the PLA's primary objectives, although the armed forces' political loyalty to the CPC has remained a leading concern. Another area of concern to the political leadership was the PLA's involvement in civilian economic activities. These activities were thought to have impacted PLA readiness and has led the political leadership to attempt to divest the PLA from its non-military business interests.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the PLA tried to transform itself from a land-based power centred on a vast ground force to a smaller, more mobile, high-tech one capable of mounting operations beyond its borders. The motivation for this was that a massive land invasion by Russia was no longer seen as a major threat, and the new threats to China are seen to be a declaration of independence by [[Taiwan]], possibly with assistance from the United States, or a confrontation over the [[Spratly Islands]]. In 1985, under the leadership of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] and the CMC, the PLA changed from being constantly prepared to \"hit early, strike hard and to fight a nuclear war\" to developing the military in an era of peace. The PLA reoriented itself to modernization, improving its fighting ability, and to become a world-class force. Deng Xiaoping stressed that the PLA needed to focus more on quality rather than on quantity. The decision of the Chinese government in 1985 to reduce the size of the military by one million was completed by 1987. Staffing in military leadership was cut by about 50 percent. During the Ninth Five Year Plan (1996\u20132000) the PLA was reduced by a further 500,000. The PLA had also been expected to be reduced by another 200,000 by 2005. The PLA has focused on increasing mechanisation and informatization so as to be able to fight a high-intensity war.<ref>The Political System of the People's Republic of China.

Retrieved 28 March 2007.</ref> The 1991 [[Gulf War]] provided the Chinese leadership with a stark realisation that the PLA was an oversized, almost-obsolete force. The possibility of a militarised Japan has also been a continuous concern to the Chinese leadership since the late 1990s. In addition, China's military leadership has been reacting to and learning from the successes and failures of the [[Military of the United States|American military]] during the [[Kosovo War]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]], the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]]. All these lessons inspired China to transform the PLA from a military based on quantity to one based on quality. Chairman [[Jiang Zemin]] officially made a \"[[Revolution in Military Affairs]]\" (RMA) part of the official national military strategy in 1993 to [[Modernization of the People's Liberation Army|modernise the Chinese armed forces]]. A goal of the RMA is to transform the PLA into a force capable of winning what it calls \"local wars under high-tech conditions\" rather than a massive, numbers-dominated ground-type war. Chinese military planners call for short decisive campaigns, limited in both their geographic scope and their political goals. In contrast to the past, more attention is given to [[reconnaissance]], mobility, and deep reach. This new vision has shifted resources towards the navy and air force. The PLA is also actively preparing for [[space warfare]] and [[cyber-warfare]].\n\nFor the past 10 to 20 years, the PLA has acquired some advanced weapons systems from Russia, including [[Sovremenny class destroyers]], [[Sukhoi Su-27]] and [[Sukhoi Su-30]] aircraft, and [[Kilo class submarine|Kilo-class]] diesel-electric submarines. It has also started to produce several new classes of destroyers and frigates including the [[Type 052D]] class guided missile destroyer. In addition, the PLAAF has designed its very own [[Chengdu J-10]] fighter aircraft and a new stealth fighter, the [[Chengdu J-20]]. The PLA launched the new [[Type 094 submarine|Jin class]] nuclear submarines on 3 December 2004 capable of launching nuclear warheads that could strike targets across the Pacific Ocean and have two aircraft carriers, one commissioned in 2012 and a second launched in 2017.\n\nIn 2015, the PLA formed new units including the PLA Ground Force, the PLA Rocket Force and the PLA Strategic Support Force.<ref>[http://english.chinamil.com.cn/news-channels/photo-reports/2016-01/01/content_6840110.htm China establishes Rocket Force and Strategic Support Force \u2013 China Military Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe PLA on 1 August 2017 marked the 90th anniversary since its establishment, before the big anniversary it mounted its biggest parade yet and the first outside of Beijing, held in the [[Zhurihe Training Base]] in the [[Northern Theater Command]] (within the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region), the first time it had ever been done to mark PLA Day as past parades had already been on 1 October, National Day of the PRC.\n\n=== Peacekeeping operations ===\nThe People's Republic of China has sent the PLA to various hotspots as part of China's role as a prominent member of the United Nations.

The party and the State jointly established the CMC that carries out the task of supreme military leadership over the armed forces. The [[1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1954 Constitution]] stated that the State President directs the armed forces and made the State President the chairman of the Defense Commission. The Defense Commission is an advisory body and does not hold any actual power over the armed forces. On 28 September 1954, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party re-established the CMC as the commanding organ of the PLA. From that time onward, the current system of a joint system of party and state leadership of the military was established. The Central Committee of the Communist Party leads in all military affairs. The State President directs the state military forces and the development of the military forces which is managed by the State Council.\n\nTo ensure the absolute leadership of the Communist Party over the armed forces, every level of party committee in the military forces implements the principles of democratic centralism. In addition, division-level and higher units establish political commissars and political organisations, ensuring that the branch organisations are in line. These systems combined the party organisation with the military organisation to achieve the party's leadership and administrative leadership. This is seen as the key guarantee to the absolute leadership of the party over the military.\n\nIn October 2014 the [[People's Liberation Army Daily|PLA Daily]] reminded readers of the [[Gutian Congress]], which stipulated the basic principle of the Party controlling the military, and called for vigilance as \"[f]oreign hostile forces preach the nationalization and de-politicization of the military, attempting to muddle our minds and drag our military out from under the Party's flag.\"<ref>[http://www.chinamil.com.cn/jfjbmap/content/2014-10/27/content_91241.htm \u5728\u5f18\u626c\u53e4\u7530\u4f1a\u8bae\u7cbe\u795e\u4e2d\u94f8\u7262\u519b\u9b42, ''Z\u00e0i h\u00f3ngy\u00e1ng g\u01d4ti\u00e1n hu\u00ecy\u00ec j\u012bngsh\u00e9n zh\u014dng zh\u00f9 l\u00e1o j\u016bn h\u00fan''] ''[[People's Liberation Army Daily|PLA Daily]]'' 27 October 2014</ref>\n\n=== Military leadership ===\nThe leadership by the CPC is a fundamental principle of the Chinese military command system. The PLA reports not to the State Council but rather to two Central Military Commissions, one belonging to the state and one belonging to the party.\n\nIn practice, the two central military commissions usually do not contradict each other because their membership is usually identical. Often, the only difference in membership between the two occurs for a few months every five years, during the period between a party congress, when Party CMC membership changes, and the next ensuing [[National People's Congress]], when the state CMC changes. The CMC carries out its responsibilities as authorised by the Constitution and National Defense Law.<ref>The Political System of the People's Republic of China. Chief Editor Pu Xingzu, Shanghai, 2005, Shanghai People's Publishing House. {{ISBN|7-208-05566-1}} Chapter 11, the State Military System, pp. 369\u2013392.</ref>\n\nThe leadership of each type of military force is under the leadership and management of the corresponding part of the Central Military Commission of the CPC Central Committee. Forces under each military branch or force such as the subordinate forces, academies and schools, scientific research and engineering institutions and logistical support organisations are also under the leadership of the CMC. This arrangement has been especially useful as China over the past several decades has moved increasingly towards military organisations composed of forces from more than one military branch. In September 1982, to meet the needs of modernisation and to improve co-ordination in the command of forces including multiple service branches and to strengthen unified command of the military, the CMC ordered the abolition of the leadership organisation of the various military branches. Today, the PLA has air force, navy and second artillery leadership organs.\n\nIn 1986, the People's Armed Forces Department, except in some border regions, was placed under the joint leadership of the PLA and the local authorities. Although the local party organisations paid close attention to the People's Armed Forces Department, as a result of some practical problems, the CMC decided that from 1 April 1996, the People's Armed Forces Department would once again fall under the jurisdiction of the PLA.\n\nAccording to the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]], the CMC is composed of the following: the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen and Members. The [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] has overall responsibility for the commission.\n\n<center>'''The Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China and the Central Military Commission of the People's Republic of China'''</center>\n\n; Chairman:\n* [[Xi Jinping]] (also [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party|General Secretary]], [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] and [[Commander-in-chief]] of Joint Battle Command)\n\n; Vice Chairmen:\n* Air Force General [[Xu Qiliang]] \n* General [[Zhang Youxia]]\n\n; Members:\n* [[Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China|Minister of National Defense]] \u2013 General [[Wei Fenghe]]\n* Chief of the [[Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission|Joint staff]] \u2013 General [[Li Zuocheng]]\n* Director of the [[Political Work Department of the Central Military Commission|Political Work Department]] \u2013 Admiral [[Miao Hua]]\n* Secretary of the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] \u2013 General [[Zhang Shengmin]]\n\n=== Central Military Commission ===\nIn December 1982, the fifth National People's Congress revised the state constitution to state that the State Central Military Commission leads all the armed forces of the state. The chairman of the State CMC is chosen and removed by the full NPC while the other members are chosen by the NPC standing committee. However, the CMC of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party remained the party organisation that directly commands the military and all the other armed forces.\n\nIn actual practice, the party CMC, after consultation with the democratic parties, proposes the names of the State CMC members of the NPC so that these people after going through the legal processes can be elected by the NPC to the State Central Military Commission. That is to say, that the CMC of the Central Committee and the CMC of the State are one group and one organisation. However, looking at it organizationally, these two CMCs are subordinate to two different systems \u2013 the party system and the state system. Therefore, the armed forces are under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party and are also the armed forces of the state. This is a unique joint leadership system that reflects the origin of the PLA as the military branch of the Communist Party. It only became the national military when the People's Republic of China was established in 1949.\n\nBy convention, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission are civilian members of the Communist Party of China, but they are not necessarily the heads of the civilian government. Both [[Jiang Zemin]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]] retained the office of chairman even after relinquishing their other positions. All of the other members of the CMC are uniformed active military officials. Unlike other nations, the [[Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China|Minister of National Defense]] is not the head of the military, but is usually a vice-chairman of the CMC.\n\nIn 2012, to attempt to reduce corruption at the highest rungs of the leadership of the Chinese military, the commission banned the service of alcohol at military receptions.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/2012/china-121222-voa01.htm |title = Strict Changes Announced for China Military Brass |author = John Pike |publisher = globalsecurity.org |accessdate = 1 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== 2016 military reforms ===\nOn 1 January 2016, The Central Military Commission (CMC) released a guideline<ref>{{cite web |title = China releases guideline on military reform \u2013 Xinhua {{!}} English.news.cn |url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-01/01/c_134970353.htm |website = news.xinhuanet.com |accessdate = 9 February 2016 }}</ref> on deepening national defense and military reform, about a month after CMC Chairman Xi Jinping called for an overhaul of the military administration and command system at a key meeting.\n\nOn 11 January 2016, the PLA created a joint staff directly attached to the Central Military Commission (CMC), the highest leadership organization in the military.

Rather than separately commanding their own troops, service branches are now primarily responsible for administrative tasks (like equipping and maintaining the troops). It is the theater commands now that have the command authority. This should, in theory, facilitate the implementation of joint operations across all service branches.<ref>\"2.12 The military and politics,\" in: [[Sebastian Heilmann]], editor, [{{cite web |url=https://www.merics.org/en/about-us/merics-analysis/chinas-political-system/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 May 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323234015/https://www.merics.org/en/about-us/merics-analysis/chinas-political-system/ |archivedate=23 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }} China''<nowiki/>'s Political System'']'','' Lanham, Boulder, New York, London: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers (2017)   {{ISBN|978-1442277342}}</ref>\n\nCoordination with civilian national security groups such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is achieved primarily by the leading groups of the Communist Party of China. Particularly important are the leading groups on foreign affairs, which include those dealing with Taiwan.\n\n== Service branches ==\nThe PLA encompasses five main service branches: the Ground Force, the Navy, the Air Force, the Rocket Force, and the Strategic Support Force. Following the 200,000 troop reduction announced in 2003, the total strength of the PLA has been reduced from 2.5 million to just under 2.3 million. Further reforms will see an additional 300,000 personnel reduction from its current strength of 2.28 million personnel. The reductions will come mainly from non-combat ground forces, which will allow more funds to be diverted to naval, air, and strategic missile forces.  This shows China's shift from ground force prioritisation to emphasising air and naval power with high-tech equipment for offensive roles over disputed coastal territories.<ref name=\"areas\">[http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0000911699 China plans military reform to enhance its readiness] \u2013 The-Japan-news.com, 2 January 2014</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the PLA has paid close attention to the performance of US forces in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. As well as learning from the success of the US military in [[network-centric warfare]], joint operations, [[C4ISTAR|C4ISR]], and [[High tech|hi-tech]] [[weapon]]ry, the PLA is also studying unconventional tactics that could be used to exploit the vulnerabilities of a more technologically advanced enemy. This has been reflected in the two parallel guidelines for the PLA ground forces development. While speeding up the process of introducing new technology into the force and retiring the older equipment, the PLA has also placed an emphasis on [[asymmetric warfare]], including exploring new methods of using existing equipment to defeat a technologically superior enemy.\n\nIn addition to the four main service branches, the PLA is supported by two [[Paramilitary forces of China|paramilitary organisations]]: the [[People's Armed Police]] (including the [[China Coast Guard]]) and the [[Militia (China)|Militia]] (including the maritime militia).\n\n=== Ground Force ===\n[[File:ZTZ-99A tank 20170902.jpg|thumb|A [[Type 99 tank|Type 99A]] main battle tank in service with the PLAGF]]\n{{Main|People's Liberation Army Ground Force}}\n\nThe PLA has a ground force with 975,000 personnel, about half of the PLA's total manpower of around 2 million.<ref name=\"IISS2018_p250\">[[International Institute for Strategic Studies]]: The Military Balance 2018, p. 250.</ref> The ground forces are divided among the five theatre commands as named above. In times of crisis, the PLA Ground Force will be reinforced by numerous [[Military reserve force|reserve]] and paramilitary units. The PLAGF reserve component has about 510,000 personnel divided into 30 infantry and 12 anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) divisions. In recent years two amphibious mechanised divisions were also established in Nanjing and Guangzhou MR. At least 40 percent of PLA divisions and brigades are now mechanised or armoured, almost double the percentage before 2015.\n\nWhile much of the PLA Ground Force was being reduced over the past few years, technology-intensive elements such as [[special operations forces]] (SOF), [[army aviation]], [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAMs), and electronic warfare units have all been rapidly expanded. The latest operational [[military doctrine|doctrine]] of the PLA ground forces highlights the importance of information technology, [[electronic warfare|electronic]] and [[information warfare]], and long-range [[precision strike]]s in future warfare.

Headed by chief of general staff, the department serves as the headquarters for the entire PLA and contained directorates for the five armed services: Ground Forces, Air Force, Navy, Rocket Forces and Support Forces. The Joint Staff Department included functionally organised subdepartments for [[military operation|operations]], [[military training|training]], [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]], [[mobilisation]], [[surveying]], [[communications]] and politics, the departments for [[artillery]], [[armour]]ed units, quartermaster units and joint forces engineering units were later dissolved, with the former two forming now part of the Ground Forces, the engineering formations now split amongst the service branches and the quartermaster formations today form part of the Joint Logistics Forces.\n\nNavy Headquarters controls the [[North Sea Fleet]], [[East Sea Fleet]], and [[South Sea Fleet]]. Air Force Headquarters generally exercised control through the commanders of the five theater commands. [[Nuclear force]]s were directly subordinate to the Joint Staff Department through the Strategic Forces commander and political commissar. Conventional main, regional, and [[militia]] units were controlled administratively by the theater commanders, but the Joint Staff Department in Beijing could assume direct operational control of any main-force unit at will. Thus, broadly speaking, the Joint Staff Department exercises operational control of the main forces, and the theater commanders controlled as always the regional forces and, indirectly, the militia. The post of principal intelligence official in the top leadership of the Chinese military has been taken up by a number of people of several generations, from Li Kenong in the 1950s to Xiong Guangkai in the late 1990s; and their public capacity has always been assistant to the deputy chief of staff or assistant to the chief of staff.\n\nEver since the CPC officially established the system of \"theater commands\" for its army in the 2010s as a successor to the \"major military regions\" policy of the 1950s, the [[intelligence agencies]] inside the Army have, after going through several major evolutions, developed into the present three major military intelligence setups:\n# The central level is composed of the Second and Third Departments under the Joint Staff Headquarters and the Liaison Department under the Political Work Department.\n# At the Theater Command level intelligence activities consist of the Second Bureau established at the same level as the Operation Department under the headquarters, and the Liaison Department established under the Political Work Department.\n# The third system includes a number of communications stations directly established in the garrison areas of all the theater commands by the Third Department of the Joint Staff Headquarters.\n\nThe Second Bureau under the headquarters and the Liaison Department under the Political Work Departments of the theater commands are only subjected to the \"professional leadership\" of their \"counterpart\" units under the Central Military Commission and are still considered the direct subordinate units of the major military region organizationally. Those entities whose names include the word \"institute\", all [[research institute]]s under the charge of the Second and the Third Departments of the Joint Staff Headquarters, including other research organs inside the Army, are at least of the establishment size of the full regimental level. Among the deputy commanders of a major [[Theater commands of the People's Liberation Army|Theater command]] in China, there is always one who is assigned to take charge of intelligence work, and the intelligence agencies under his charge are directly affiliated to the headquarters and the political department of the military region.\n\nThe Conference on Strengthening Intelligence Work held from 3 September 1996 \u2013 18 September 1996 at the Xishan Command Center of the [[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of State Security]] and the General Staff Department. Chi Haotian delivered a report entitled \"Strengthen Intelligence Work in a New International Environment To Serve the Cause of Socialist Construction.\" The report emphasised the need to strengthen the following four aspects of intelligence work:\n* Efforts must be made to strengthen understanding of the special nature and role of intelligence work, as well as understanding of the close relationship between strengthening intelligence work on the one hand, and of the [[Four Modernizations]] of the motherland, the reunification of the motherland, and opposition to hegemony and power politics on the other.\n* The United States and the West have all along been engaged in infiltration, intervention, sabotage, and intelligence gathering against China on the political, economic, military, and ideological fronts. The response must strengthen the struggle against their infiltration, intervention, sabotage, and intelligence gathering.\n* Consolidating intelligence departments and training a new generation of intelligence personnel who are politically reliable, honest and upright in their ways, and capable of mastering professional skills, the art of struggle, and advanced technologies.\n* Strengthening the work of organising intelligence in two international industrial, commercial, and financial ports\u2014Hong Kong and Macau.\n\nAlthough the four aspects emphasised by Chi Haotian appeared to be defensive measures, they were in fact both defensive and offensive in nature.\n\n==== Second Department ====\n{{unreferenced section |date = March 2014 }}\n\nThe Second Department of the Joint Staff Headquarters is responsible for collecting [[military intelligence]]. Activities include [[military attach\u00e9]]s at Chinese embassies abroad, clandestine special agents sent to foreign countries to collect military information, and the analysis of information publicly published in foreign countries.\n\nThe Second Department oversees military [[human intelligence (espionage)|human intelligence]] (HUMINT) collection, widely exploits [[Open Source Intelligence|open source (OSINT) materials]], fuses HUMINT, [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT), and [[imagery intelligence]] data, and disseminates finished intelligence products to the CMC and other consumers. Preliminary fusion is carried out by the Second Department's Analysis Bureau which mans the National Watch Center, the focal point for national-level indications and warning. In-depth analysis is carried out by regional bureaus. Although traditionally the Second Department of the [[Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission|Joint Staff Department]] was responsible for military intelligence, it is beginning to increasingly focus on [[Science, technology and society|scientific and technological]] intelligence in the military field, following the example of Russian agencies in stepping up the work of collecting scientific and technological information.\n\nThe research institute under the Second Department of the Joint Staff Headquarters is publicly known as the Institute for International Strategic Studies; its internal classified publication \"Foreign Military Trends\" (\u300a\u5916\u519b\u52a8\u6001\u300b, ''Wai Jun Dongtai'') is published every 10 days and transmitted to units at the division level.\n\nThe PLA Institute of International Relations at [[Nanjing]] comes under the Second Department of the [[Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission|Joint Staff Department]] and is responsible for training [[military attach\u00e9]]s, assistant military attach\u00e9s and associate military attach\u00e9s as well as [[secret agent]]s to be posted abroad. It also supplies officers to the military intelligence sections of various [[military region]]s and [[group armies]]. The Institute was formed from the PLA \"793\" [[Foreign Language]] Institute, which moved from [[Zhangjiakou]] after the Cultural Revolution and split into two institutions at [[Luoyang]] and [[Nanjing]].\n\nThe Institute of International Relations was known in the 1950s as the School for Foreign Language Cadres of the Central Military Commission, with the current name being used since 1964. The training of intelligence personnel is one of several activities at the Institute. While all graduates of the [[Moscow Institute of International Relations]] were employed by the [[KGB]], only some graduates of the Beijing Institute of International Relations are employed by the Ministry of State Security. The former Institute of International Relations, since been renamed the [[Foreign Affairs College]], is under the administration of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and is not involved in secret intelligence work. The former Central Military Commission foreign language school had foreign faculty members who were either Communist Party sympathizers or were members of foreign communist parties. But the present Institute of International Relations does not hire foreign teachers, to avoid the danger that its students might be recognised when sent abroad as clandestine agents.\n\nThose engaged in professional work in military academies under the Second Department of the Joint Staff Headquarters usually have a chance to go abroad, either for advanced studies or as [[military officer]]s working in the military attach\u00e9's office of Chinese embassies in foreign countries. People working in the military attach\u00e9's office of embassies are usually engaged in collecting military information under the cover of \"military diplomacy\". As long as they refrain from directly [[subversion (politics)|subversive]] activities, they are considered as well-behaved \"military diplomats\".\n\nSome bureaus under the Second Department which are responsible for espionage in different regions, of which the First Bureau is responsible for collecting information in the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and [[Macau]], and also in [[Taiwan]]. Agents are dispatched by the Second Department to companies and other local corporations to gain cover.\n\nThe \"Autumn Orchid\" intelligence group assigned to Hong Kong and Macau in the mid-1980s mostly operated in the mass media, political, industrial, commercial, and religious circles, as well as in universities and colleges. The \"Autumn Orchid\" intelligence group was mainly responsible for the following three tasks:\n* Finding out and keeping abreast of the political leanings of officials of the Hong Kong and Macau governments, as well as their views on major issues, through social contact with them and through information provided by them.\n* Keeping abreast of the developments of foreign governments' political organs in Hong Kong, as well as of foreign financial, industrial, and commercial organisations.\n* Finding out and having a good grasp of the local media's sources of information on political, military, economic, and other developments on the mainland, and deliberately releasing false political or military information to the media to test the outside response.\n\nThe \"Autumn Orchid\" intelligence group was awarded a Citation for Merit, Second Class, in December 1994. It was further awarded another Citation for Merit, Second Class, in 1997. Its current status is not publicly known. During the 2008 Chinese New Year celebration CCTV held for Chinese diplomatic establishments, the head of the Second Department of the Joint Headquarters was revealed for the first time to the public: the current head was [[Major General]] Yang Hui (\u6768\u6656).\n\n==== Third Department ====\n{{unreferenced section |date = March 2014}}\n\nThe Third Department of the Joint Staff Department is responsible for monitoring the [[telecommunications]] of foreign armies and producing finished intelligence based on the military information collected.\n\nThe [[military communications|communications]] stations established by the Third Department of the Joint Staff Headquarters are not subject to the [[jurisdiction]] of the provincial [[military district]] and the major theater command of where they are based. The communications stations are entirely the agencies of the Third Department of the Joint Staff Headquarters which have no affiliations to the provincial military district and the military region of where they are based. The personnel composition, budgets, and establishment of these communications stations are entirely under the jurisdiction of the Third Department of the General PLA General Staff Headquarters, and are not related at all with local troops.\n\nChina maintains the most extensive [[SIGINT]] network of all the countries in the Asia-Pacific region. As of the late 1990s, SIGINT systems included several dozen ground stations, half a dozen ships, truck-mounted systems, and airborne systems. Third Department headquarters is in the vicinity of the GSD First Department (Operations Department), AMS, and NDU complex in the hills northwest of the [[Summer Palace]]. As of the late 1990s, the Third Department was allegedly manned by approximately 20,000 personnel, with most of their linguists trained at the Luoyang Institute of Foreign Languages.\n\nEver since the 1950s, the Second and Third Departments of the Joint Staff Headquarters have established a number of institutions of secondary and [[higher education|higher learning]] for bringing up \"special talents.\" The PLA Foreign Language Institute at [[Luoyang]] comes under the Third Department of the Joint Staff Department and is responsible for training [[foreign language]] officers for the monitoring of foreign [[military intelligence]]. The Institute was formed from the PLA \"793\" Foreign Language Institute, which moved from Zhangjiakou after the Cultural Revolution and split into two institutions at Luoyang and Nanjing.\n\nThough the distribution order they received upon graduation indicated the \"Joint Staff Headquarters\", many of the graduates of these schools found themselves being sent to all parts of the country, including remote and uninhabited backward mountain areas. The reason is that the monitoring and control stations under the Third Department of the PLA General Staff Headquarters are scattered in every corner of the country.\n\nThe communications stations located in the [[Shenzhen]] base of the [[PLA Hong Kong Garrison]] started their work long ago. In normal times, these two communications stations report directly to the Central Military Commission and the Joint Staff Headquarters. Units responsible for co-ordination are the communications stations established in the garrison provinces of the military regions by the Third Department of the PLA General Staff Headquarters.\n\nBy taking direct command of [[military communications]] stations based in all parts of the country, the CPC Central Military Commission and the Joint Staff Headquarters can not only ensure a successful [[interception]] of enemy [[radio communications]], but can also make sure that none of the wire or [[wireless communication]]s and contacts among major military regions can escape the detection of these communications stations, thus effectively attaining the goal of imposing a direct supervision and control over all major [[military region]]s, all provincial [[military district]]s, and all [[group armies]].\n\n===== Monitoring stations =====\n{{unreferenced section |date = March 2014}}\n\nChina's main [[SIGINT]] effort is in the Third Department of the Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission, with additional capabilities, primarily domestic, in the Ministry of State Security (MSS). SIGINT stations, therefore, are scattered through the country, for domestic as well as international interception. Prof. Desmond Ball, of the [[Australian National University]], described the largest stations as the main Technical Department SIGINT net control station on the northwest outskirts of Beijing, and the large complex near [[Lake Khanka|Lake Kinghathu]] in the extreme northeast corner of China.\n\nAs opposed to other [[Great power|major powers]], China focuses its SIGINT activities on its region rather than the world. Ball wrote, in the eighties, that China had several dozen SIGINT stations aimed at the Soviet Union, Japan, [[Taiwan]], Southeast Asia and India, as well as internally. Of the stations apparently targeting Russia, there are sites at Jilemutu and [[Jixi]] in the northeast, and at [[Erenhot|Erlian]] and [[Hami City|Hami]] near the Mongolian border. Two Russian-facing sites in [[Xinjiang]], at [[Qitai]] and [[Korla]] may be operated jointly with resources from the US [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s Office of SIGINT Operations, probably focused on missile and space activity. Other stations aimed at South and Southeast Asia are on a net controlled by [[Chengdu]], Sichuan. There is a large facility at Dayi, and, according to Ball, \"numerous\" small posts along the Indian border. Other significant facilities are located near [[Shenyang]], near [[Jinan]] and in [[Nanjing]] and Shanghai. Additional stations are in the [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] military districts opposite Taiwan.\n\nOn [[Hainan Island]], near [[Vietnam]], there is a naval SIGINT facility that monitors the South China sea, and a ground station targeting US and Russian satellites. China also has ship and aircraft platforms in this area, under the [[South Sea Fleet]] headquarters at [[Zhanjiang]] immediately north of the island. Targeting here seems to have an [[ELINT]] as well as [[COMINT]] flavor. There are also truck-mounted mobile ground systems, as well as ship, aircraft, and limited satellite capability. There are at least 10 intelligence-gathering [[Auxiliaries|auxiliary]] vessels.\n\nAs of the late nineties, the Chinese did not appear to be trying to monitor the [[United States Pacific Command]] to the same extent as does Russia. In future, this had depended, in part, on the status of Taiwan.\n\n==== Fourth Department ====\n{{Main|Fourth Department of the General Staff Headquarters Department}}\n\nThe Fourth Department (ECM and Radar) of the Joint Staff Headquarters Department has the [[electronic intelligence]] (ELINT) portfolio within the PLA's [[SIGINT]] apparatus. This department is responsible for [[electronic countermeasures]], requiring them to collect and maintain data bases on electronic signals. 25 ELINT receivers are the responsibility of the Southwest Institute of Electronic Equipment (SWIEE). Among the wide range of SWIEE ELINT products is a new KZ900 airborne ELINT pod. The GSD 54th Research Institute supports the ECM Department in development of digital ELINT signal processors to analyse parameters of radar pulses.\n\n=== Liaison Department ===\nThe [[Political Work Department of the Central Military Commission|Political Work Department]] maintains the [[Communist Party of China|CPC]] structure that exists at every level of the PLA. It is responsible for overseeing the political education, indoctrination and discipline that is a prerequisite for advancement within the PLA. The PWD controls the internal prison system of the PLA. The International Liaison Department of the Political Work Department is publicly known as the [[China Association for International Friendly Contact]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/a-preliminary-survey-of-ccp-influence-operations-in-japan/|title=A Preliminary Survey of CCP Influence Operations in Japan|last=Hsiao|first=Russell|date=26 June 2019|website=[[Jamestown Foundation]]|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/spying-beyond-the-facade/|title=Spying beyond the fa\u00e7ade|last=Wade|first=Geoff|date=12 November 2013|website=The Strategist|publisher=[[Australian Strategic Policy Institute]]|language=en-AU|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> The department prepares political and economic information for the reference of the Political Bureau.

Formed in China's Guangzhou military region and known by the nickname \"Sword of Southern China\", the force supposedly receives army, air force and naval training, including flight training, and is equipped with \"hundreds of high-tech devices\", including global-positioning satellite systems. All of the force's officers have completed military staff colleges, and 60 percent are said to have university degrees. Soldiers are reported to be cross-trained in various specialties, and training is supposed to encompass a range of operational environments. It is far from clear whether this unit is considered operational by the Chinese. It is also not clear how such a force would be employed. Among the missions mentioned were \"responding to contingencies in various regions\" and \"cooperating with other services in attacks on islands\". According to the limited reporting, the organisation appears to be in a phase of testing and development and may constitute an experimental unit. While no size for the force has been revealed, there have been Chinese media claims that \"over 4,000 soldiers of the force are all-weather and versatile fighters and parachutists who can fly airplanes and drive auto vehicles and motor boats\".{{Citation needed |date = December 2009}}\n\n=== Other branches ===\n* The Third Department and the Navy co-operate on shipborne intelligence collection platforms.\n* PLAAF Sixth Research Institute: Air Force SIGINT collection is managed by the PLAAF Sixth Research Institute in Beijing.\n\n== Weapons and equipment ==\nAccording to the [[United States Defense Department]], China is developing kinetic-energy weapons, high-powered lasers, high-powered [[microwave|microwave weapon]]s, [[Particle beam#Particle beams as weapons|particle-beam weapon]]s, and [[electromagnetic pulse]] weapons with its increase of military fundings.<ref>The Standard, 5 March 2008, Volume 1, No. 134, Major jump in military spending, Alarm raised over cyber, space advance, ''the Pentagon said in a report. ... \"The PLA is also exploring satellite jammers, kinetic-energy weapons, high-powered lasers, high-powered microwave weapons, particle-beam weapons, and electromagnetic pulse weapons for counterspace application\", it said, adding it was not clear if the cyber intrusions were backed by the military.''</ref>\n\nThe PLA has said of reports that its modernisation is dependent on sales of advanced technology from American allies \"Some people have politicized China's normal commercial cooperation with foreign countries, smearing our reputation.\" These contributions include advanced European diesel engines for Chinese warships, military helicopter designs from Eurocopter, French anti-submarine sonars and helicopters,<ref>{{cite news |url = http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/12/19/us-breakout-submarines-special-report-idINBRE9BI0PD20131219 |title = Chinese military's secret to success: European engineering |last1 = Lague |first1 = David |date = 19 December 2013 |agency = Reuters  |accessdate = 20 December 2013}}</ref> Australian technology for the [[Houbei class missile boat]],<ref>Lague, David.

China supplied major arms to 35 states in 2010\u201314. A significant percentage (just over 68 percent) of Chinese exports went to three countries: Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. China also exported major arms to 18 African states. Examples of China's increasing global presence as an arms supplier in 2010\u201314 included deals with Venezuela for armoured vehicles and transport and trainer aircraft, with Algeria for three frigates, with Indonesia for the supply of hundreds of anti-ship missiles and with Nigeria for the supply of a number of unmanned combat aerial vehicles. Following rapid advances in its arms industry, China has become less dependent on arms imports, which decreased by 42 percent between 2005\u20132009 and 2010\u201314. Russia accounted for 61 percent of Chinese arms imports, followed by France with 16 percent and Ukraine with 13 per cent. Helicopters formed a major part of Russian and French deliveries, with the French designs produced under licence in China. Over the years, China has struggled to design and produce effective engines for combat and transport vehicles. It continued to import large numbers of engines from Russia and Ukraine in 2010\u201314 for indigenously designed combat, advanced trainer and transport aircraft, and for naval ships. It also produced British-, French- and German-designed engines for combat aircraft, naval ships and armoured vehicles, mostly as part of agreements that have been in place for decades.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |title = Trends in International Arms Transfer, 2014 |url = http://books.sipri.org/product_info?c_product_id=495 |website = sipri.org |publisher = Stockholm International Peace Research Institute |accessdate = 18 March 2015 |ref = SIPRI Fact Sheet, March 2015 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150319023856/http://books.sipri.org/product_info?c_product_id=495 |archivedate = 19 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\n=== Cyberwarfare ===\n{{Main|Cyberwarfare in the People's Republic of China}}\n\nThere is a belief in the western military doctrines that the PLA have already begun engaging countries using [[cyber-warfare]].<ref>{{cite news |last = Gorman |first = Siobhan |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123914805204099085 |title = Electricity Grid in U.S. Penetrated By Spies |work = The Wall Street Journal |date = 8 April 2009 |accessdate = 1 April 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite video |url = http://www.foxnews.com/video2/video08.html?maven_referralObject=4258140&maven_referralPlaylistId=&sRevUrl=http://www.foxnews.com/ |title = Power Grid Penetrated? |publisher = Fox News Channel |date = 22 December 2009 |accessdate = 1 April 2011 }}</ref> There has been a significant increase in the number of presumed Chinese military initiated cyber events from 1999 to the present day.<ref>{{citation |first = Bryan |last = Krekel |title = Capability of the People's Republic of China to Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation |publisher = [[Northrop Grumman]] |year = 2009 |url = http://www.uscc.gov/researchpapers/2009/NorthropGrumman_PRC_Cyber_Paper_FINAL_Approved%20Report_16Oct2009.pdf |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110203052113/http://www.uscc.gov/researchpapers/2009/NorthropGrumman_PRC_Cyber_Paper_FINAL_Approved%20Report_16Oct2009.pdf |archivedate = 3 February 2011 }}</ref>\n\nCyberwarfare has gained recognition as a valuable technique because it is an asymmetric technique that is a part of [[Chinese Information Operations]].

The decision was made after the United States threatened the use of nuclear weapons against China should it take action against [[Quemoy]] and [[Matsu (islands)|Matsu]], coupled with the lack of interest of the Soviet Union for using its nuclear weapons in defence of China.\n\nAfter their first [[nuclear test]] (China claims minimal Soviet assistance before 1960) on 16 October 1964, China was the first state to pledge [[no-first-use]] of nuclear weapons. On 1 July 1966, the Second Artillery Corps, as named by Premier Zhou Enlai, was formed. In 1967, China [[Chinese nuclear test No. 6|tested]] a fully functional [[hydrogen bomb]], only 32 months after China had made its first fission device. China thus produced the shortest fission-to-fusion development known in history.\n\nChina became a major international arms exporter during the 1980s. Beijing joined the Middle East arms control talks, which began in July 1991 to establish global guidelines for conventional arms transfers, and later announced that it would no longer participate because of the US decision to sell 150 [[F-16]]A/B aircraft to Taiwan on 2 September 1992.\n\nIt joined the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) in 1984 and pledged to abstain from further atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in 1986. China acceded to the nuclear [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) in 1992 and supported its indefinite and unconditional extension in 1995. [[List of nuclear weapons tests of China|Nuclear weapons tests by China]] ceased in 1996, when it signed the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] and agreed to seek an international ban on the production of fissile nuclear weapons material.\n\nIn 1996, China committed to provide assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities. China attended the May 1997 meeting of the NPT Exporters (Zangger) Committee as an observer and became a full member in October 1997. The [[Zangger Committee]] is a group which meets to list items that should be subject to IAEA inspections if exported by countries, which have, as China has, signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty. In September 1997, China issued detailed nuclear export control regulations. China began implementing regulations establishing controls over nuclear-related [[dual-use]] items in 1998. China also has decided not to engage in new nuclear co-operation with [[Iran]] (even under safeguards), and will complete existing co-operation, which is not of proliferation concern, within a relatively short period. Based on significant, tangible progress with China on nuclear nonproliferation, President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] in 1998 took steps to bring into force the 1985 US\u2013China Agreement on Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation.\n\nBeijing has deployed a modest ballistic missile force, including land and sea-based intermediate-range and intercontinental ballistic missiles ([[ICBM]]s). It was estimated in 2007 that China has about 100\u2013160 liquid fuelled ICBMs capable of striking the United States with approximately 100\u2013150 [[IRBM]]s able to strike Russia or Eastern Europe, as well as several hundred tactical [[SRBM]]s with ranges between 300 and 600&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"2007annualreport p19\">2007 Annual Report to Congress: Military Power of the People's Republic of China. p. 19.</ref>\nCurrently, the Chinese nuclear stockpile is estimated to be between 50 and 75 land and sea based ICBMs.<ref>http://www.defense.gov/pubs/2013_China_Report_FINAL.pdf</ref>\n\nChina's nuclear program follows a doctrine of [[minimal deterrence]], which involves having the minimum force needed to deter an aggressor from launching a first strike. The current efforts of China appear to be aimed at maintaining a survivable nuclear force by, for example, using solid-fuelled ICBMs in silos rather than liquid-fuelled missiles. China's 2006 published deterrence policy states that they will \"uphold the principles of counterattack in self-defense and limited development of nuclear weapons\", but \"has never entered, and will never enter into a nuclear arms race with any country\". It goes on to describe that China will never undertake a first strike, or use nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear state or zone.<ref name=\"2007annualreport p19\" /> US strategists, however, suggest that the Chinese position may be ambiguous, and nuclear weapons may be used both to deter conventional strikes/invasions on the Chinese mainland, or as an international political tool \u2013 limiting the extent to which other nations can coerce China politically, an inherent, often inadvertent phenomenon in international relations as regards any state with nuclear capabilities.<ref>2007 Annual Report to Congress: Military Power of the People's Republic of China. p. 20.</ref>\n\n=== Space-based warfare ===\n{{Main|ASAT program of China}}\n\nThe PLA has deployed a number of space-based systems for military purposes, including the [[imagery intelligence]] satellite systems like the ZiYan series,<ref>Squadron Leader KK Nair, \"Space: The Frontiers of Modern Defence\", Knowledge World Publishers, New Delhi, Chapter 6, p. 123\u2013126.</ref> and the militarily designated JianBing series, synthetic aperture satellites (SAR) such as JianBing-5, [[BeiDou satellite navigation network]], and secured communication satellites with FENGHUO-1.<ref>Squadron Leadr KK Nair, Space:The Frontiers of Modern Defence, p. 123.</ref>\n\nThe PLA is responsible for the [[Chinese space program]]. To date, all the participants have been selected from members of the PLA Air Force. China became the third country in the world to have sent a man into space by its own means with the flight of [[Yang Liwei]] aboard the [[Shenzhou&nbsp;5]] spacecraft on 15 October 2003 and the flight of [[Fei Junlong]] and [[Nie Haisheng]] aboard [[Shenzhou&nbsp;6]] on 12 October 2005 and [[Zhai Zhigang]], [[Liu Boming (astronaut)|Liu Boming]], and [[Jing Haipeng]] aboard [[Shenzhou&nbsp;7]] on 25 September 2008.\n\nThe PLA started the development of an anti-ballistic and anti-satellite system in the 1960s, code named Project 640, including ground-based lasers and anti-satellite missiles. On 11 January 2007, China conducted a successful [[2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test|test]] of an [[anti-satellite missile]], with an SC-19 class KKV.<ref name=\"channelnewsasia.com\">[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/253580/1/.html China plays down fears after satellite shot down], [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] via [[MediaCorp Channel NewsAsia|Channelnewsasia]], 20 January 2007</ref> Its anti ballistic missile test was also successful.\n\nThe PLA has tested two types of hypersonic space vehicles, the Shenglong Spaceplane and a new one built by [[Chengdu Aircraft Corporation]].

The white characters on the blue sign roughly translate to: \"Secret/Classified Area, Do Not Enter Unless Invited.\"]]\n\nUntil the mid-1990s the PLA had extensive commercial enterprise holdings in non-military areas, particularly real estate. Almost all of these holdings were supposedly spun off in the mid-1990s. In most cases, the management of the companies remained unchanged, with the PLA officers running the companies simply retiring from the PLA to run the newly formed private holding companies.<ref name=scmp1884377>{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1884377/xi-wants-pla-inc-return-its-proper-role|title=China's President Xi Jinping wants 'PLA Inc' to stop its song and dance, plans end for profit-making activities|date=28 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe history of PLA involvement in commercial enterprises began in the 1950s and 1960s. Because of the socialist [[state-owned]] system and from a desire for military self-sufficiency, the PLA created a network of enterprises such as farms, guest houses, and factories intended to financially support its own needs. One unintended side effect of the Deng-era economic reforms was that many of these enterprises became very profitable. For example, a military guest house intended for soldier recreation could be easily converted into a profitable hotel for civilian use. There were two main factors which increased PLA commercial involvement in the 1990s. One was that running profitable companies decreased the need for the state to fund the military from the [[government budget]]. The second was that in an environment where legal rules were unclear and political connections were important, PLA influence was very useful.{{Citation needed |date = October 2008}}\n\nBy the early 1990s party officials and high military officials were becoming increasingly alarmed at the military's commercial involvement for a number of reasons. The military's involvement in commerce was seen to adversely affect military readiness and spread corruption. Further, there was great concern that having an independent source of funding would lead to decreased loyalty to the party. The result of this was an effort to spin off the PLA's commercial enterprises into private companies managed by former PLA officers, and to reform military [[procurement]] from a system in which the PLA directly controls its sources of supply to a contracting system more akin to those of Western countries. The separation of the PLA from its commercial interests was largely complete by the year 2000. It was met with very little resistance, as the spinoff was arranged in such a way that few lost out.<ref name=scmp1884377/> The rapidly expanding [[CEFC China Energy]], that bought a $9 billion stake in [[Russia]]'s largest oil producer [[Rosneft]],<ref>\"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-02/why-cefc-spent-9-billion-on-rosneft-while-seeing-30-oil-risk Why an Enigmatic Chinese Company Just Spent $9 Billion on a Stake in Rosneft]\".

It is legally obliged to follow the principle of [[civilian control of the military]], although in practical terms this principle has been implemented in such a way as to ensure the PLA is under the absolute control of the Communist Party. Its [[Supreme Military Command of the People's Republic of China|commander in chief]] is the [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] (usually the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]). Since 1949, China has used nine different military strategies, which the PLA calls \"strategic guidelines\".  The most important came in 1956, 1980, and 1993.<ref name=\"M. Taylor Fravel 2019\">M.

They were then known as the [[Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army]], or simply the Red Army. Between 1934 and 1935, the Red Army survived several campaigns led against it by Chiang Kai-Shek and engaged in the [[Long March]].\n\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] from 1937 to 1945, the Communist military forces were nominally integrated into the [[National Revolutionary Army]] of the [[Republic of China]] forming two main units known as the [[Eighth Route Army]] and the [[New Fourth Army]]. During this time, these two military groups primarily employed [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]], generally avoiding large-scale battles with the Japanese with some exceptions while at the same time consolidating their ground by absorbing nationalist troops and paramilitary forces behind Japanese lines into their forces. After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, the Communist Party merged the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army, renaming the new million-strong force the \"People's Liberation Army\". They eventually won the [[Chinese Civil War]], establishing the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949. The PLA then saw a huge reorganisation with the establishment of the Air Force leadership structure in November 1949 followed by the Navy leadership the following April. In 1950, the leadership structures of the artillery, armoured troops, air defence troops, public security forces, and worker\u2013soldier militias were also established. The chemical warfare defence forces, the railroad forces, the communications forces, and the strategic forces, as well as other separate forces (like engineering and construction, logistics and medical services), were established later on, all these depended on the leadership of the Communist Party and the National People's Congress via the Central Military Commission (and until 1975 the National Defense Council).\n\n=== 1950s, 1960s and 1970s ===\n{{Further|Korean War|Sino-Indian War|Sino-Soviet border conflict}}\n\n[[File:PLA Enters Peking.jpg|thumb|PLA troops entering Beijing in 1949 during the [[Chinese Civil War]]]]\n[[File:Chinese troops leaving Korea.jpg|thumb|Chinese troops gathered on a T-34/85 or a Type 58 medium tank leaving [[North Korea]] in 1958, 5 years after the Korean War ended with an armistice (a ceasefire) in 1953.

The most important came in 1956, 1980, and 1993.<ref name=\"M. Taylor Fravel 2019\"/> Part of this process was the reorganisation that created thirteen military regions in 1955. The PLA also contained many former [[National Revolutionary Army]] units and generals who had defected to the PLA. [[Ma Hongbin]] and his son [[Ma Dunjing (1906\u20131972)|Ma Dunjing]] were the only two Muslim generals who led a Muslim unit, the 81st corps, to ever serve in the PLA. [[Han Youwen]], a Salar Muslim general, also defected to the PLA. In November 1950, some units of the PLA under the name of the [[People's Volunteer Army]] intervened in the [[Korean War]] as United Nations forces under General [[Douglas MacArthur]] approached the [[Yalu River]]. Under the weight of this offensive, Chinese forces drove MacArthur's forces out of North Korea and captured [[Seoul]], but were subsequently pushed back south of Pyongyang north of the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]]. The war also served as a catalyst for the rapid modernization of the [[PLAAF]]. In 1962, the PLA ground force also fought India in the [[Sino-Indian War]], achieving all objectives.\n\nPrior to the [[Cultural Revolution]], military region commanders tended to remain in their posts for long periods of time. As the PLA took a stronger role in politics, this began to be seen as somewhat of a threat to the party's (or, at least, civilian) control of the military. The longest-serving military region commanders were [[Xu Shiyou]] in the [[Nanjing Military Region]] (1954\u201374), [[Yang Dezhi]] in the [[Jinan Military Region]] (1958\u201374), [[Chen Xilian]] in the [[Shenyang Military Region]] (1959\u201373), and [[Han Xianchu]] in the Fuzhou Military Region (1960\u201374). The establishment of a professional military force equipped with modern weapons and doctrine was the last of the [[Four Modernizations]] announced by Zhou Enlai and supported by [[Deng Xiaoping]]. In keeping with Deng's mandate to reform, the PLA has demobilized millions of men and women since 1978 and has introduced modern methods in such areas as [[military recruitment|recruitment]] and manpower, [[military strategy|strategy]], and [[military education and training|education and training]]. In 1979, the PLA fought [[Vietnam]] over a border skirmish in the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] where both sides claimed victory.\n\nDuring the Sino-Soviet split, strained relations between China and the Soviet Union resulted in bloody border clashes and mutual backing of each other's adversaries. China and Afghanistan had neutral relations with each other during the King's rule. When the pro-Soviet Afghan Communists seized power in Afghanistan in 1978, relations between China and the Afghan communists quickly turned hostile. The Afghan pro-Soviet communists supported China's enemies in Vietnam and blamed China for supporting Afghan anti-communist militants. China responded to the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] by supporting the [[Afghan mujahideen]] and ramping up their military presence near Afghanistan in Xinjiang. China acquired military equipment from the United States to defend itself from Soviet attack.<ref>{{cite book |author=S. Frederick Starri |editor=S.

Following the [[People's Liberation Army at Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|PLA's suppression]] of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], ideological correctness was temporarily revived as the dominant theme in Chinese military affairs. Reform and modernisation have today resumed their position as the PLA's primary objectives, although the armed forces' political loyalty to the CPC has remained a leading concern. Another area of concern to the political leadership was the PLA's involvement in civilian economic activities. These activities were thought to have impacted PLA readiness and has led the political leadership to attempt to divest the PLA from its non-military business interests.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the PLA tried to transform itself from a land-based power centred on a vast ground force to a smaller, more mobile, high-tech one capable of mounting operations beyond its borders. The motivation for this was that a massive land invasion by Russia was no longer seen as a major threat, and the new threats to China are seen to be a declaration of independence by [[Taiwan]], possibly with assistance from the United States, or a confrontation over the [[Spratly Islands]]. In 1985, under the leadership of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] and the CMC, the PLA changed from being constantly prepared to \"hit early, strike hard and to fight a nuclear war\" to developing the military in an era of peace. The PLA reoriented itself to modernization, improving its fighting ability, and to become a world-class force. Deng Xiaoping stressed that the PLA needed to focus more on quality rather than on quantity. The decision of the Chinese government in 1985 to reduce the size of the military by one million was completed by 1987. Staffing in military leadership was cut by about 50 percent. During the Ninth Five Year Plan (1996\u20132000) the PLA was reduced by a further 500,000. The PLA had also been expected to be reduced by another 200,000 by 2005. The PLA has focused on increasing mechanisation and informatization so as to be able to fight a high-intensity war.<ref>The Political System of the People's Republic of China.

Retrieved 28 March 2007.</ref> The 1991 [[Gulf War]] provided the Chinese leadership with a stark realisation that the PLA was an oversized, almost-obsolete force. The possibility of a militarised Japan has also been a continuous concern to the Chinese leadership since the late 1990s. In addition, China's military leadership has been reacting to and learning from the successes and failures of the [[Military of the United States|American military]] during the [[Kosovo War]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]], the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]]. All these lessons inspired China to transform the PLA from a military based on quantity to one based on quality. Chairman [[Jiang Zemin]] officially made a \"[[Revolution in Military Affairs]]\" (RMA) part of the official national military strategy in 1993 to [[Modernization of the People's Liberation Army|modernise the Chinese armed forces]]. A goal of the RMA is to transform the PLA into a force capable of winning what it calls \"local wars under high-tech conditions\" rather than a massive, numbers-dominated ground-type war. Chinese military planners call for short decisive campaigns, limited in both their geographic scope and their political goals. In contrast to the past, more attention is given to [[reconnaissance]], mobility, and deep reach. This new vision has shifted resources towards the navy and air force. The PLA is also actively preparing for [[space warfare]] and [[cyber-warfare]].\n\nFor the past 10 to 20 years, the PLA has acquired some advanced weapons systems from Russia, including [[Sovremenny class destroyers]], [[Sukhoi Su-27]] and [[Sukhoi Su-30]] aircraft, and [[Kilo class submarine|Kilo-class]] diesel-electric submarines. It has also started to produce several new classes of destroyers and frigates including the [[Type 052D]] class guided missile destroyer. In addition, the PLAAF has designed its very own [[Chengdu J-10]] fighter aircraft and a new stealth fighter, the [[Chengdu J-20]]. The PLA launched the new [[Type 094 submarine|Jin class]] nuclear submarines on 3 December 2004 capable of launching nuclear warheads that could strike targets across the Pacific Ocean and have two aircraft carriers, one commissioned in 2012 and a second launched in 2017.\n\nIn 2015, the PLA formed new units including the PLA Ground Force, the PLA Rocket Force and the PLA Strategic Support Force.<ref>[http://english.chinamil.com.cn/news-channels/photo-reports/2016-01/01/content_6840110.htm China establishes Rocket Force and Strategic Support Force \u2013 China Military Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe PLA on 1 August 2017 marked the 90th anniversary since its establishment, before the big anniversary it mounted its biggest parade yet and the first outside of Beijing, held in the [[Zhurihe Training Base]] in the [[Northern Theater Command]] (within the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region), the first time it had ever been done to mark PLA Day as past parades had already been on 1 October, National Day of the PRC.\n\n=== Peacekeeping operations ===\nThe People's Republic of China has sent the PLA to various hotspots as part of China's role as a prominent member of the United Nations.

The party and the State jointly established the CMC that carries out the task of supreme military leadership over the armed forces. The [[1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1954 Constitution]] stated that the State President directs the armed forces and made the State President the chairman of the Defense Commission. The Defense Commission is an advisory body and does not hold any actual power over the armed forces. On 28 September 1954, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party re-established the CMC as the commanding organ of the PLA. From that time onward, the current system of a joint system of party and state leadership of the military was established. The Central Committee of the Communist Party leads in all military affairs. The State President directs the state military forces and the development of the military forces which is managed by the State Council.\n\nTo ensure the absolute leadership of the Communist Party over the armed forces, every level of party committee in the military forces implements the principles of democratic centralism. In addition, division-level and higher units establish political commissars and political organisations, ensuring that the branch organisations are in line. These systems combined the party organisation with the military organisation to achieve the party's leadership and administrative leadership. This is seen as the key guarantee to the absolute leadership of the party over the military.\n\nIn October 2014 the [[People's Liberation Army Daily|PLA Daily]] reminded readers of the [[Gutian Congress]], which stipulated the basic principle of the Party controlling the military, and called for vigilance as \"[f]oreign hostile forces preach the nationalization and de-politicization of the military, attempting to muddle our minds and drag our military out from under the Party's flag.\"<ref>[http://www.chinamil.com.cn/jfjbmap/content/2014-10/27/content_91241.htm \u5728\u5f18\u626c\u53e4\u7530\u4f1a\u8bae\u7cbe\u795e\u4e2d\u94f8\u7262\u519b\u9b42, ''Z\u00e0i h\u00f3ngy\u00e1ng g\u01d4ti\u00e1n hu\u00ecy\u00ec j\u012bngsh\u00e9n zh\u014dng zh\u00f9 l\u00e1o j\u016bn h\u00fan''] ''[[People's Liberation Army Daily|PLA Daily]]'' 27 October 2014</ref>\n\n=== Military leadership ===\nThe leadership by the CPC is a fundamental principle of the Chinese military command system. The PLA reports not to the State Council but rather to two Central Military Commissions, one belonging to the state and one belonging to the party.\n\nIn practice, the two central military commissions usually do not contradict each other because their membership is usually identical. Often, the only difference in membership between the two occurs for a few months every five years, during the period between a party congress, when Party CMC membership changes, and the next ensuing [[National People's Congress]], when the state CMC changes. The CMC carries out its responsibilities as authorised by the Constitution and National Defense Law.<ref>The Political System of the People's Republic of China. Chief Editor Pu Xingzu, Shanghai, 2005, Shanghai People's Publishing House. {{ISBN|7-208-05566-1}} Chapter 11, the State Military System, pp. 369\u2013392.</ref>\n\nThe leadership of each type of military force is under the leadership and management of the corresponding part of the Central Military Commission of the CPC Central Committee. Forces under each military branch or force such as the subordinate forces, academies and schools, scientific research and engineering institutions and logistical support organisations are also under the leadership of the CMC. This arrangement has been especially useful as China over the past several decades has moved increasingly towards military organisations composed of forces from more than one military branch. In September 1982, to meet the needs of modernisation and to improve co-ordination in the command of forces including multiple service branches and to strengthen unified command of the military, the CMC ordered the abolition of the leadership organisation of the various military branches. Today, the PLA has air force, navy and second artillery leadership organs.\n\nIn 1986, the People's Armed Forces Department, except in some border regions, was placed under the joint leadership of the PLA and the local authorities. Although the local party organisations paid close attention to the People's Armed Forces Department, as a result of some practical problems, the CMC decided that from 1 April 1996, the People's Armed Forces Department would once again fall under the jurisdiction of the PLA.\n\nAccording to the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]], the CMC is composed of the following: the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen and Members. The [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] has overall responsibility for the commission.\n\n<center>'''The Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China and the Central Military Commission of the People's Republic of China'''</center>\n\n; Chairman:\n* [[Xi Jinping]] (also [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party|General Secretary]], [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] and [[Commander-in-chief]] of Joint Battle Command)\n\n; Vice Chairmen:\n* Air Force General [[Xu Qiliang]] \n* General [[Zhang Youxia]]\n\n; Members:\n* [[Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China|Minister of National Defense]] \u2013 General [[Wei Fenghe]]\n* Chief of the [[Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission|Joint staff]] \u2013 General [[Li Zuocheng]]\n* Director of the [[Political Work Department of the Central Military Commission|Political Work Department]] \u2013 Admiral [[Miao Hua]]\n* Secretary of the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] \u2013 General [[Zhang Shengmin]]\n\n=== Central Military Commission ===\nIn December 1982, the fifth National People's Congress revised the state constitution to state that the State Central Military Commission leads all the armed forces of the state. The chairman of the State CMC is chosen and removed by the full NPC while the other members are chosen by the NPC standing committee. However, the CMC of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party remained the party organisation that directly commands the military and all the other armed forces.\n\nIn actual practice, the party CMC, after consultation with the democratic parties, proposes the names of the State CMC members of the NPC so that these people after going through the legal processes can be elected by the NPC to the State Central Military Commission. That is to say, that the CMC of the Central Committee and the CMC of the State are one group and one organisation. However, looking at it organizationally, these two CMCs are subordinate to two different systems \u2013 the party system and the state system. Therefore, the armed forces are under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party and are also the armed forces of the state. This is a unique joint leadership system that reflects the origin of the PLA as the military branch of the Communist Party. It only became the national military when the People's Republic of China was established in 1949.\n\nBy convention, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission are civilian members of the Communist Party of China, but they are not necessarily the heads of the civilian government. Both [[Jiang Zemin]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]] retained the office of chairman even after relinquishing their other positions. All of the other members of the CMC are uniformed active military officials. Unlike other nations, the [[Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China|Minister of National Defense]] is not the head of the military, but is usually a vice-chairman of the CMC.\n\nIn 2012, to attempt to reduce corruption at the highest rungs of the leadership of the Chinese military, the commission banned the service of alcohol at military receptions.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/2012/china-121222-voa01.htm |title = Strict Changes Announced for China Military Brass |author = John Pike |publisher = globalsecurity.org |accessdate = 1 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== 2016 military reforms ===\nOn 1 January 2016, The Central Military Commission (CMC) released a guideline<ref>{{cite web |title = China releases guideline on military reform \u2013 Xinhua {{!}} English.news.cn |url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-01/01/c_134970353.htm |website = news.xinhuanet.com |accessdate = 9 February 2016 }}</ref> on deepening national defense and military reform, about a month after CMC Chairman Xi Jinping called for an overhaul of the military administration and command system at a key meeting.\n\nOn 11 January 2016, the PLA created a joint staff directly attached to the Central Military Commission (CMC), the highest leadership organization in the military.

This reflects a change in their concept of operations from primarily ground-oriented to mobile and coordinated movement of all services.<ref>[http://asia.nikkei.com/Features/China-up-close/Xi-declares-victory-over-old-rivals-Jiang-Hu Xi declares victory over old rivals Jiang, Hu] Asia Nikkei Asian Review, 11 Feb 2016</ref> The five new theatre commands are:\n* [[Eastern Theater Command]]\n* [[Western Theater Command]]\n* [[Northern Theater Command]]\n* [[Southern Theater Command]]\n* [[Central Theater Command]]\n\nThe PLA [[garrison]]s in [[People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison|Hong Kong]] and [[People's Liberation Army Macau Garrison|Macau]] both come under the Southern Theater Command.\n\nThe military reforms have also introduced a major change in the areas of responsibilities. Rather than separately commanding their own troops, service branches are now primarily responsible for administrative tasks (like equipping and maintaining the troops). It is the theater commands now that have the command authority. This should, in theory, facilitate the implementation of joint operations across all service branches.<ref>\"2.12 The military and politics,\" in: [[Sebastian Heilmann]], editor, [{{cite web |url=https://www.merics.org/en/about-us/merics-analysis/chinas-political-system/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 May 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323234015/https://www.merics.org/en/about-us/merics-analysis/chinas-political-system/ |archivedate=23 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }} China''<nowiki/>'s Political System'']'','' Lanham, Boulder, New York, London: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers (2017)   {{ISBN|978-1442277342}}</ref>\n\nCoordination with civilian national security groups such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is achieved primarily by the leading groups of the Communist Party of China. Particularly important are the leading groups on foreign affairs, which include those dealing with Taiwan.\n\n== Service branches ==\nThe PLA encompasses five main service branches: the Ground Force, the Navy, the Air Force, the Rocket Force, and the Strategic Support Force. Following the 200,000 troop reduction announced in 2003, the total strength of the PLA has been reduced from 2.5 million to just under 2.3 million. Further reforms will see an additional 300,000 personnel reduction from its current strength of 2.28 million personnel. The reductions will come mainly from non-combat ground forces, which will allow more funds to be diverted to naval, air, and strategic missile forces.  This shows China's shift from ground force prioritisation to emphasising air and naval power with high-tech equipment for offensive roles over disputed coastal territories.<ref name=\"areas\">[http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0000911699 China plans military reform to enhance its readiness] \u2013 The-Japan-news.com, 2 January 2014</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the PLA has paid close attention to the performance of US forces in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. As well as learning from the success of the US military in [[network-centric warfare]], joint operations, [[C4ISTAR|C4ISR]], and [[High tech|hi-tech]] [[weapon]]ry, the PLA is also studying unconventional tactics that could be used to exploit the vulnerabilities of a more technologically advanced enemy. This has been reflected in the two parallel guidelines for the PLA ground forces development. While speeding up the process of introducing new technology into the force and retiring the older equipment, the PLA has also placed an emphasis on [[asymmetric warfare]], including exploring new methods of using existing equipment to defeat a technologically superior enemy.\n\nIn addition to the four main service branches, the PLA is supported by two [[Paramilitary forces of China|paramilitary organisations]]: the [[People's Armed Police]] (including the [[China Coast Guard]]) and the [[Militia (China)|Militia]] (including the maritime militia).\n\n=== Ground Force ===\n[[File:ZTZ-99A tank 20170902.jpg|thumb|A [[Type 99 tank|Type 99A]] main battle tank in service with the PLAGF]]\n{{Main|People's Liberation Army Ground Force}}\n\nThe PLA has a ground force with 975,000 personnel, about half of the PLA's total manpower of around 2 million.<ref name=\"IISS2018_p250\">[[International Institute for Strategic Studies]]: The Military Balance 2018, p. 250.</ref> The ground forces are divided among the five theatre commands as named above. In times of crisis, the PLA Ground Force will be reinforced by numerous [[Military reserve force|reserve]] and paramilitary units. The PLAGF reserve component has about 510,000 personnel divided into 30 infantry and 12 anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) divisions. In recent years two amphibious mechanised divisions were also established in Nanjing and Guangzhou MR. At least 40 percent of PLA divisions and brigades are now mechanised or armoured, almost double the percentage before 2015.\n\nWhile much of the PLA Ground Force was being reduced over the past few years, technology-intensive elements such as [[special operations forces]] (SOF), [[army aviation]], [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAMs), and electronic warfare units have all been rapidly expanded. The latest operational [[military doctrine|doctrine]] of the PLA ground forces highlights the importance of information technology, [[electronic warfare|electronic]] and [[information warfare]], and long-range [[precision strike]]s in future warfare.

Air Force Headquarters generally exercised control through the commanders of the five theater commands. [[Nuclear force]]s were directly subordinate to the Joint Staff Department through the Strategic Forces commander and political commissar. Conventional main, regional, and [[militia]] units were controlled administratively by the theater commanders, but the Joint Staff Department in Beijing could assume direct operational control of any main-force unit at will. Thus, broadly speaking, the Joint Staff Department exercises operational control of the main forces, and the theater commanders controlled as always the regional forces and, indirectly, the militia. The post of principal intelligence official in the top leadership of the Chinese military has been taken up by a number of people of several generations, from Li Kenong in the 1950s to Xiong Guangkai in the late 1990s; and their public capacity has always been assistant to the deputy chief of staff or assistant to the chief of staff.\n\nEver since the CPC officially established the system of \"theater commands\" for its army in the 2010s as a successor to the \"major military regions\" policy of the 1950s, the [[intelligence agencies]] inside the Army have, after going through several major evolutions, developed into the present three major military intelligence setups:\n# The central level is composed of the Second and Third Departments under the Joint Staff Headquarters and the Liaison Department under the Political Work Department.\n# At the Theater Command level intelligence activities consist of the Second Bureau established at the same level as the Operation Department under the headquarters, and the Liaison Department established under the Political Work Department.\n# The third system includes a number of communications stations directly established in the garrison areas of all the theater commands by the Third Department of the Joint Staff Headquarters.\n\nThe Second Bureau under the headquarters and the Liaison Department under the Political Work Departments of the theater commands are only subjected to the \"professional leadership\" of their \"counterpart\" units under the Central Military Commission and are still considered the direct subordinate units of the major military region organizationally. Those entities whose names include the word \"institute\", all [[research institute]]s under the charge of the Second and the Third Departments of the Joint Staff Headquarters, including other research organs inside the Army, are at least of the establishment size of the full regimental level. Among the deputy commanders of a major [[Theater commands of the People's Liberation Army|Theater command]] in China, there is always one who is assigned to take charge of intelligence work, and the intelligence agencies under his charge are directly affiliated to the headquarters and the political department of the military region.\n\nThe Conference on Strengthening Intelligence Work held from 3 September 1996 \u2013 18 September 1996 at the Xishan Command Center of the [[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of State Security]] and the General Staff Department. Chi Haotian delivered a report entitled \"Strengthen Intelligence Work in a New International Environment To Serve the Cause of Socialist Construction.\" The report emphasised the need to strengthen the following four aspects of intelligence work:\n* Efforts must be made to strengthen understanding of the special nature and role of intelligence work, as well as understanding of the close relationship between strengthening intelligence work on the one hand, and of the [[Four Modernizations]] of the motherland, the reunification of the motherland, and opposition to hegemony and power politics on the other.\n* The United States and the West have all along been engaged in infiltration, intervention, sabotage, and intelligence gathering against China on the political, economic, military, and ideological fronts. The response must strengthen the struggle against their infiltration, intervention, sabotage, and intelligence gathering.\n* Consolidating intelligence departments and training a new generation of intelligence personnel who are politically reliable, honest and upright in their ways, and capable of mastering professional skills, the art of struggle, and advanced technologies.\n* Strengthening the work of organising intelligence in two international industrial, commercial, and financial ports\u2014Hong Kong and Macau.\n\nAlthough the four aspects emphasised by Chi Haotian appeared to be defensive measures, they were in fact both defensive and offensive in nature.\n\n==== Second Department ====\n{{unreferenced section |date = March 2014 }}\n\nThe Second Department of the Joint Staff Headquarters is responsible for collecting [[military intelligence]]. Activities include [[military attach\u00e9]]s at Chinese embassies abroad, clandestine special agents sent to foreign countries to collect military information, and the analysis of information publicly published in foreign countries.\n\nThe Second Department oversees military [[human intelligence (espionage)|human intelligence]] (HUMINT) collection, widely exploits [[Open Source Intelligence|open source (OSINT) materials]], fuses HUMINT, [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT), and [[imagery intelligence]] data, and disseminates finished intelligence products to the CMC and other consumers. Preliminary fusion is carried out by the Second Department's Analysis Bureau which mans the National Watch Center, the focal point for national-level indications and warning. In-depth analysis is carried out by regional bureaus. Although traditionally the Second Department of the [[Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission|Joint Staff Department]] was responsible for military intelligence, it is beginning to increasingly focus on [[Science, technology and society|scientific and technological]] intelligence in the military field, following the example of Russian agencies in stepping up the work of collecting scientific and technological information.\n\nThe research institute under the Second Department of the Joint Staff Headquarters is publicly known as the Institute for International Strategic Studies; its internal classified publication \"Foreign Military Trends\" (\u300a\u5916\u519b\u52a8\u6001\u300b, ''Wai Jun Dongtai'') is published every 10 days and transmitted to units at the division level.\n\nThe PLA Institute of International Relations at [[Nanjing]] comes under the Second Department of the [[Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission|Joint Staff Department]] and is responsible for training [[military attach\u00e9]]s, assistant military attach\u00e9s and associate military attach\u00e9s as well as [[secret agent]]s to be posted abroad. It also supplies officers to the military intelligence sections of various [[military region]]s and [[group armies]]. The Institute was formed from the PLA \"793\" [[Foreign Language]] Institute, which moved from [[Zhangjiakou]] after the Cultural Revolution and split into two institutions at [[Luoyang]] and [[Nanjing]].\n\nThe Institute of International Relations was known in the 1950s as the School for Foreign Language Cadres of the Central Military Commission, with the current name being used since 1964. The training of intelligence personnel is one of several activities at the Institute. While all graduates of the [[Moscow Institute of International Relations]] were employed by the [[KGB]], only some graduates of the Beijing Institute of International Relations are employed by the Ministry of State Security. The former Institute of International Relations, since been renamed the [[Foreign Affairs College]], is under the administration of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and is not involved in secret intelligence work. The former Central Military Commission foreign language school had foreign faculty members who were either Communist Party sympathizers or were members of foreign communist parties. But the present Institute of International Relations does not hire foreign teachers, to avoid the danger that its students might be recognised when sent abroad as clandestine agents.\n\nThose engaged in professional work in military academies under the Second Department of the Joint Staff Headquarters usually have a chance to go abroad, either for advanced studies or as [[military officer]]s working in the military attach\u00e9's office of Chinese embassies in foreign countries. People working in the military attach\u00e9's office of embassies are usually engaged in collecting military information under the cover of \"military diplomacy\". As long as they refrain from directly [[subversion (politics)|subversive]] activities, they are considered as well-behaved \"military diplomats\".\n\nSome bureaus under the Second Department which are responsible for espionage in different regions, of which the First Bureau is responsible for collecting information in the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and [[Macau]], and also in [[Taiwan]]. Agents are dispatched by the Second Department to companies and other local corporations to gain cover.\n\nThe \"Autumn Orchid\" intelligence group assigned to Hong Kong and Macau in the mid-1980s mostly operated in the mass media, political, industrial, commercial, and religious circles, as well as in universities and colleges. The \"Autumn Orchid\" intelligence group was mainly responsible for the following three tasks:\n* Finding out and keeping abreast of the political leanings of officials of the Hong Kong and Macau governments, as well as their views on major issues, through social contact with them and through information provided by them.\n* Keeping abreast of the developments of foreign governments' political organs in Hong Kong, as well as of foreign financial, industrial, and commercial organisations.\n* Finding out and having a good grasp of the local media's sources of information on political, military, economic, and other developments on the mainland, and deliberately releasing false political or military information to the media to test the outside response.\n\nThe \"Autumn Orchid\" intelligence group was awarded a Citation for Merit, Second Class, in December 1994. It was further awarded another Citation for Merit, Second Class, in 1997. Its current status is not publicly known. During the 2008 Chinese New Year celebration CCTV held for Chinese diplomatic establishments, the head of the Second Department of the Joint Headquarters was revealed for the first time to the public: the current head was [[Major General]] Yang Hui (\u6768\u6656).\n\n==== Third Department ====\n{{unreferenced section |date = March 2014}}\n\nThe Third Department of the Joint Staff Department is responsible for monitoring the [[telecommunications]] of foreign armies and producing finished intelligence based on the military information collected.\n\nThe [[military communications|communications]] stations established by the Third Department of the Joint Staff Headquarters are not subject to the [[jurisdiction]] of the provincial [[military district]] and the major theater command of where they are based. The communications stations are entirely the agencies of the Third Department of the Joint Staff Headquarters which have no affiliations to the provincial military district and the military region of where they are based. The personnel composition, budgets, and establishment of these communications stations are entirely under the jurisdiction of the Third Department of the General PLA General Staff Headquarters, and are not related at all with local troops.\n\nChina maintains the most extensive [[SIGINT]] network of all the countries in the Asia-Pacific region. As of the late 1990s, SIGINT systems included several dozen ground stations, half a dozen ships, truck-mounted systems, and airborne systems. Third Department headquarters is in the vicinity of the GSD First Department (Operations Department), AMS, and NDU complex in the hills northwest of the [[Summer Palace]]. As of the late 1990s, the Third Department was allegedly manned by approximately 20,000 personnel, with most of their linguists trained at the Luoyang Institute of Foreign Languages.\n\nEver since the 1950s, the Second and Third Departments of the Joint Staff Headquarters have established a number of institutions of secondary and [[higher education|higher learning]] for bringing up \"special talents.\" The PLA Foreign Language Institute at [[Luoyang]] comes under the Third Department of the Joint Staff Department and is responsible for training [[foreign language]] officers for the monitoring of foreign [[military intelligence]]. The Institute was formed from the PLA \"793\" Foreign Language Institute, which moved from Zhangjiakou after the Cultural Revolution and split into two institutions at Luoyang and Nanjing.\n\nThough the distribution order they received upon graduation indicated the \"Joint Staff Headquarters\", many of the graduates of these schools found themselves being sent to all parts of the country, including remote and uninhabited backward mountain areas. The reason is that the monitoring and control stations under the Third Department of the PLA General Staff Headquarters are scattered in every corner of the country.\n\nThe communications stations located in the [[Shenzhen]] base of the [[PLA Hong Kong Garrison]] started their work long ago. In normal times, these two communications stations report directly to the Central Military Commission and the Joint Staff Headquarters. Units responsible for co-ordination are the communications stations established in the garrison provinces of the military regions by the Third Department of the PLA General Staff Headquarters.\n\nBy taking direct command of [[military communications]] stations based in all parts of the country, the CPC Central Military Commission and the Joint Staff Headquarters can not only ensure a successful [[interception]] of enemy [[radio communications]], but can also make sure that none of the wire or [[wireless communication]]s and contacts among major military regions can escape the detection of these communications stations, thus effectively attaining the goal of imposing a direct supervision and control over all major [[military region]]s, all provincial [[military district]]s, and all [[group armies]].\n\n===== Monitoring stations =====\n{{unreferenced section |date = March 2014}}\n\nChina's main [[SIGINT]] effort is in the Third Department of the Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission, with additional capabilities, primarily domestic, in the Ministry of State Security (MSS). SIGINT stations, therefore, are scattered through the country, for domestic as well as international interception. Prof. Desmond Ball, of the [[Australian National University]], described the largest stations as the main Technical Department SIGINT net control station on the northwest outskirts of Beijing, and the large complex near [[Lake Khanka|Lake Kinghathu]] in the extreme northeast corner of China.\n\nAs opposed to other [[Great power|major powers]], China focuses its SIGINT activities on its region rather than the world. Ball wrote, in the eighties, that China had several dozen SIGINT stations aimed at the Soviet Union, Japan, [[Taiwan]], Southeast Asia and India, as well as internally. Of the stations apparently targeting Russia, there are sites at Jilemutu and [[Jixi]] in the northeast, and at [[Erenhot|Erlian]] and [[Hami City|Hami]] near the Mongolian border. Two Russian-facing sites in [[Xinjiang]], at [[Qitai]] and [[Korla]] may be operated jointly with resources from the US [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s Office of SIGINT Operations, probably focused on missile and space activity. Other stations aimed at South and Southeast Asia are on a net controlled by [[Chengdu]], Sichuan. There is a large facility at Dayi, and, according to Ball, \"numerous\" small posts along the Indian border. Other significant facilities are located near [[Shenyang]], near [[Jinan]] and in [[Nanjing]] and Shanghai. Additional stations are in the [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] military districts opposite Taiwan.\n\nOn [[Hainan Island]], near [[Vietnam]], there is a naval SIGINT facility that monitors the South China sea, and a ground station targeting US and Russian satellites. China also has ship and aircraft platforms in this area, under the [[South Sea Fleet]] headquarters at [[Zhanjiang]] immediately north of the island. Targeting here seems to have an [[ELINT]] as well as [[COMINT]] flavor. There are also truck-mounted mobile ground systems, as well as ship, aircraft, and limited satellite capability. There are at least 10 intelligence-gathering [[Auxiliaries|auxiliary]] vessels.\n\nAs of the late nineties, the Chinese did not appear to be trying to monitor the [[United States Pacific Command]] to the same extent as does Russia. In future, this had depended, in part, on the status of Taiwan.\n\n==== Fourth Department ====\n{{Main|Fourth Department of the General Staff Headquarters Department}}\n\nThe Fourth Department (ECM and Radar) of the Joint Staff Headquarters Department has the [[electronic intelligence]] (ELINT) portfolio within the PLA's [[SIGINT]] apparatus. This department is responsible for [[electronic countermeasures]], requiring them to collect and maintain data bases on electronic signals. 25 ELINT receivers are the responsibility of the Southwest Institute of Electronic Equipment (SWIEE). Among the wide range of SWIEE ELINT products is a new KZ900 airborne ELINT pod. The GSD 54th Research Institute supports the ECM Department in development of digital ELINT signal processors to analyse parameters of radar pulses.\n\n=== Liaison Department ===\nThe [[Political Work Department of the Central Military Commission|Political Work Department]] maintains the [[Communist Party of China|CPC]] structure that exists at every level of the PLA. It is responsible for overseeing the political education, indoctrination and discipline that is a prerequisite for advancement within the PLA. The PWD controls the internal prison system of the PLA. The International Liaison Department of the Political Work Department is publicly known as the [[China Association for International Friendly Contact]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/a-preliminary-survey-of-ccp-influence-operations-in-japan/|title=A Preliminary Survey of CCP Influence Operations in Japan|last=Hsiao|first=Russell|date=26 June 2019|website=[[Jamestown Foundation]]|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/spying-beyond-the-facade/|title=Spying beyond the fa\u00e7ade|last=Wade|first=Geoff|date=12 November 2013|website=The Strategist|publisher=[[Australian Strategic Policy Institute]]|language=en-AU|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> The department prepares political and economic information for the reference of the Political Bureau. The department conducts ideological and political work on foreign armies, explaining China's policies, and disintegrate enemy armies by dampening their morale. It is also tasked with instigating rebellions and disloyalty within the Taiwan military and other foreign militaries.\n\nThe Liaison Office has dispatched agents to infiltrate Chinese-funded companies and private institutions in Hong Kong. Their mission is [[counter-espionage]], monitoring their own agents, and preventing and detecting foreign intelligence services buying off Chinese personnel.\n\n=== Special forces ===\n{{Main|People's Liberation Army Special Operations Forces}}\n\nChina's special ground force is called PLASF ([[People's Liberation Army Special Operations Forces]]). It includes highly trained soldiers, a team of commander, assistant commander, sniper, spotter, machine-gun supporter, bomber, and a pair of assault group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/special-forces-orbat.htm|title=Special Forces - People's Liberation Army|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=2020-01-09}}</ref> China's counterterrorist unit is drawn from the police force rather than the military.

Formed in China's Guangzhou military region and known by the nickname \"Sword of Southern China\", the force supposedly receives army, air force and naval training, including flight training, and is equipped with \"hundreds of high-tech devices\", including global-positioning satellite systems. All of the force's officers have completed military staff colleges, and 60 percent are said to have university degrees. Soldiers are reported to be cross-trained in various specialties, and training is supposed to encompass a range of operational environments. It is far from clear whether this unit is considered operational by the Chinese. It is also not clear how such a force would be employed. Among the missions mentioned were \"responding to contingencies in various regions\" and \"cooperating with other services in attacks on islands\". According to the limited reporting, the organisation appears to be in a phase of testing and development and may constitute an experimental unit. While no size for the force has been revealed, there have been Chinese media claims that \"over 4,000 soldiers of the force are all-weather and versatile fighters and parachutists who can fly airplanes and drive auto vehicles and motor boats\".{{Citation needed |date = December 2009}}\n\n=== Other branches ===\n* The Third Department and the Navy co-operate on shipborne intelligence collection platforms.\n* PLAAF Sixth Research Institute: Air Force SIGINT collection is managed by the PLAAF Sixth Research Institute in Beijing.\n\n== Weapons and equipment ==\nAccording to the [[United States Defense Department]], China is developing kinetic-energy weapons, high-powered lasers, high-powered [[microwave|microwave weapon]]s, [[Particle beam#Particle beams as weapons|particle-beam weapon]]s, and [[electromagnetic pulse]] weapons with its increase of military fundings.<ref>The Standard, 5 March 2008, Volume 1, No. 134, Major jump in military spending, Alarm raised over cyber, space advance, ''the Pentagon said in a report. ... \"The PLA is also exploring satellite jammers, kinetic-energy weapons, high-powered lasers, high-powered microwave weapons, particle-beam weapons, and electromagnetic pulse weapons for counterspace application\", it said, adding it was not clear if the cyber intrusions were backed by the military.''</ref>\n\nThe PLA has said of reports that its modernisation is dependent on sales of advanced technology from American allies \"Some people have politicized China's normal commercial cooperation with foreign countries, smearing our reputation.\" These contributions include advanced European diesel engines for Chinese warships, military helicopter designs from Eurocopter, French anti-submarine sonars and helicopters,<ref>{{cite news |url = http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/12/19/us-breakout-submarines-special-report-idINBRE9BI0PD20131219 |title = Chinese military's secret to success: European engineering |last1 = Lague |first1 = David |date = 19 December 2013 |agency = Reuters  |accessdate = 20 December 2013}}</ref> Australian technology for the [[Houbei class missile boat]],<ref>Lague, David.

China supplied major arms to 35 states in 2010\u201314. A significant percentage (just over 68 percent) of Chinese exports went to three countries: Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. China also exported major arms to 18 African states. Examples of China's increasing global presence as an arms supplier in 2010\u201314 included deals with Venezuela for armoured vehicles and transport and trainer aircraft, with Algeria for three frigates, with Indonesia for the supply of hundreds of anti-ship missiles and with Nigeria for the supply of a number of unmanned combat aerial vehicles. Following rapid advances in its arms industry, China has become less dependent on arms imports, which decreased by 42 percent between 2005\u20132009 and 2010\u201314. Russia accounted for 61 percent of Chinese arms imports, followed by France with 16 percent and Ukraine with 13 per cent. Helicopters formed a major part of Russian and French deliveries, with the French designs produced under licence in China. Over the years, China has struggled to design and produce effective engines for combat and transport vehicles. It continued to import large numbers of engines from Russia and Ukraine in 2010\u201314 for indigenously designed combat, advanced trainer and transport aircraft, and for naval ships. It also produced British-, French- and German-designed engines for combat aircraft, naval ships and armoured vehicles, mostly as part of agreements that have been in place for decades.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |title = Trends in International Arms Transfer, 2014 |url = http://books.sipri.org/product_info?c_product_id=495 |website = sipri.org |publisher = Stockholm International Peace Research Institute |accessdate = 18 March 2015 |ref = SIPRI Fact Sheet, March 2015 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150319023856/http://books.sipri.org/product_info?c_product_id=495 |archivedate = 19 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\n=== Cyberwarfare ===\n{{Main|Cyberwarfare in the People's Republic of China}}\n\nThere is a belief in the western military doctrines that the PLA have already begun engaging countries using [[cyber-warfare]].<ref>{{cite news |last = Gorman |first = Siobhan |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123914805204099085 |title = Electricity Grid in U.S. Penetrated By Spies |work = The Wall Street Journal |date = 8 April 2009 |accessdate = 1 April 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite video |url = http://www.foxnews.com/video2/video08.html?maven_referralObject=4258140&maven_referralPlaylistId=&sRevUrl=http://www.foxnews.com/ |title = Power Grid Penetrated? |publisher = Fox News Channel |date = 22 December 2009 |accessdate = 1 April 2011 }}</ref> There has been a significant increase in the number of presumed Chinese military initiated cyber events from 1999 to the present day.<ref>{{citation |first = Bryan |last = Krekel |title = Capability of the People's Republic of China to Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation |publisher = [[Northrop Grumman]] |year = 2009 |url = http://www.uscc.gov/researchpapers/2009/NorthropGrumman_PRC_Cyber_Paper_FINAL_Approved%20Report_16Oct2009.pdf |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110203052113/http://www.uscc.gov/researchpapers/2009/NorthropGrumman_PRC_Cyber_Paper_FINAL_Approved%20Report_16Oct2009.pdf |archivedate = 3 February 2011 }}</ref>\n\nCyberwarfare has gained recognition as a valuable technique because it is an asymmetric technique that is a part of [[Chinese Information Operations]].

The decision was made after the United States threatened the use of nuclear weapons against China should it take action against [[Quemoy]] and [[Matsu (islands)|Matsu]], coupled with the lack of interest of the Soviet Union for using its nuclear weapons in defence of China.\n\nAfter their first [[nuclear test]] (China claims minimal Soviet assistance before 1960) on 16 October 1964, China was the first state to pledge [[no-first-use]] of nuclear weapons. On 1 July 1966, the Second Artillery Corps, as named by Premier Zhou Enlai, was formed. In 1967, China [[Chinese nuclear test No. 6|tested]] a fully functional [[hydrogen bomb]], only 32 months after China had made its first fission device. China thus produced the shortest fission-to-fusion development known in history.\n\nChina became a major international arms exporter during the 1980s. Beijing joined the Middle East arms control talks, which began in July 1991 to establish global guidelines for conventional arms transfers, and later announced that it would no longer participate because of the US decision to sell 150 [[F-16]]A/B aircraft to Taiwan on 2 September 1992.\n\nIt joined the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) in 1984 and pledged to abstain from further atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in 1986. China acceded to the nuclear [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) in 1992 and supported its indefinite and unconditional extension in 1995. [[List of nuclear weapons tests of China|Nuclear weapons tests by China]] ceased in 1996, when it signed the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] and agreed to seek an international ban on the production of fissile nuclear weapons material.\n\nIn 1996, China committed to provide assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities. China attended the May 1997 meeting of the NPT Exporters (Zangger) Committee as an observer and became a full member in October 1997. The [[Zangger Committee]] is a group which meets to list items that should be subject to IAEA inspections if exported by countries, which have, as China has, signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty. In September 1997, China issued detailed nuclear export control regulations. China began implementing regulations establishing controls over nuclear-related [[dual-use]] items in 1998. China also has decided not to engage in new nuclear co-operation with [[Iran]] (even under safeguards), and will complete existing co-operation, which is not of proliferation concern, within a relatively short period. Based on significant, tangible progress with China on nuclear nonproliferation, President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] in 1998 took steps to bring into force the 1985 US\u2013China Agreement on Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation.\n\nBeijing has deployed a modest ballistic missile force, including land and sea-based intermediate-range and intercontinental ballistic missiles ([[ICBM]]s). It was estimated in 2007 that China has about 100\u2013160 liquid fuelled ICBMs capable of striking the United States with approximately 100\u2013150 [[IRBM]]s able to strike Russia or Eastern Europe, as well as several hundred tactical [[SRBM]]s with ranges between 300 and 600&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"2007annualreport p19\">2007 Annual Report to Congress: Military Power of the People's Republic of China. p. 19.</ref>\nCurrently, the Chinese nuclear stockpile is estimated to be between 50 and 75 land and sea based ICBMs.<ref>http://www.defense.gov/pubs/2013_China_Report_FINAL.pdf</ref>\n\nChina's nuclear program follows a doctrine of [[minimal deterrence]], which involves having the minimum force needed to deter an aggressor from launching a first strike. The current efforts of China appear to be aimed at maintaining a survivable nuclear force by, for example, using solid-fuelled ICBMs in silos rather than liquid-fuelled missiles. China's 2006 published deterrence policy states that they will \"uphold the principles of counterattack in self-defense and limited development of nuclear weapons\", but \"has never entered, and will never enter into a nuclear arms race with any country\". It goes on to describe that China will never undertake a first strike, or use nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear state or zone.<ref name=\"2007annualreport p19\" /> US strategists, however, suggest that the Chinese position may be ambiguous, and nuclear weapons may be used both to deter conventional strikes/invasions on the Chinese mainland, or as an international political tool \u2013 limiting the extent to which other nations can coerce China politically, an inherent, often inadvertent phenomenon in international relations as regards any state with nuclear capabilities.<ref>2007 Annual Report to Congress: Military Power of the People's Republic of China. p. 20.</ref>\n\n=== Space-based warfare ===\n{{Main|ASAT program of China}}\n\nThe PLA has deployed a number of space-based systems for military purposes, including the [[imagery intelligence]] satellite systems like the ZiYan series,<ref>Squadron Leader KK Nair, \"Space: The Frontiers of Modern Defence\", Knowledge World Publishers, New Delhi, Chapter 6, p. 123\u2013126.</ref> and the militarily designated JianBing series, synthetic aperture satellites (SAR) such as JianBing-5, [[BeiDou satellite navigation network]], and secured communication satellites with FENGHUO-1.<ref>Squadron Leadr KK Nair, Space:The Frontiers of Modern Defence, p. 123.</ref>\n\nThe PLA is responsible for the [[Chinese space program]]. To date, all the participants have been selected from members of the PLA Air Force. China became the third country in the world to have sent a man into space by its own means with the flight of [[Yang Liwei]] aboard the [[Shenzhou&nbsp;5]] spacecraft on 15 October 2003 and the flight of [[Fei Junlong]] and [[Nie Haisheng]] aboard [[Shenzhou&nbsp;6]] on 12 October 2005 and [[Zhai Zhigang]], [[Liu Boming (astronaut)|Liu Boming]], and [[Jing Haipeng]] aboard [[Shenzhou&nbsp;7]] on 25 September 2008.\n\nThe PLA started the development of an anti-ballistic and anti-satellite system in the 1960s, code named Project 640, including ground-based lasers and anti-satellite missiles. On 11 January 2007, China conducted a successful [[2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test|test]] of an [[anti-satellite missile]], with an SC-19 class KKV.<ref name=\"channelnewsasia.com\">[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/253580/1/.html China plays down fears after satellite shot down], [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] via [[MediaCorp Channel NewsAsia|Channelnewsasia]], 20 January 2007</ref> Its anti ballistic missile test was also successful.\n\nThe PLA has tested two types of hypersonic space vehicles, the Shenglong Spaceplane and a new one built by [[Chengdu Aircraft Corporation]].

According to [[SIPRI]], China became the world's third largest exporter of major arms in 2010\u201314, an increase of 143 per cent from the period 2005\u20132009. China supplied major arms to 35 states in 2010\u201314. A significant percentage (just over 68 per cent) of Chinese exports went to three countries: Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. China also exported major arms to 18 African states. Examples of China's increasing global presence as an arms supplier in 2010\u201314 included deals with Venezuela for armoured vehicles and transport and trainer aircraft, with Algeria for three frigates, with Indonesia for the supply of hundreds of anti-ship missiles and with Nigeria for the supply of a number of unmanned combat aerial vehicles. Following rapid advances in its domestic arms industry, China has become less dependent on arms imports, which decreased by 42 per cent between 2005\u20132009 and 2010\u201314.<ref name=\"auto\" /> China's rise in military spending come at a time when there are tensions along the South China Sea with territorial disputes involving the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan, as well as escalating tensions between China and Japan involving the disputed Diaoyu (Chinese spelling) and Senkaku (Japanese spelling) islands.

The white characters on the blue sign roughly translate to: \"Secret/Classified Area, Do Not Enter Unless Invited.\"]]\n\nUntil the mid-1990s the PLA had extensive commercial enterprise holdings in non-military areas, particularly real estate. Almost all of these holdings were supposedly spun off in the mid-1990s. In most cases, the management of the companies remained unchanged, with the PLA officers running the companies simply retiring from the PLA to run the newly formed private holding companies.<ref name=scmp1884377>{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1884377/xi-wants-pla-inc-return-its-proper-role|title=China's President Xi Jinping wants 'PLA Inc' to stop its song and dance, plans end for profit-making activities|date=28 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe history of PLA involvement in commercial enterprises began in the 1950s and 1960s. Because of the socialist [[state-owned]] system and from a desire for military self-sufficiency, the PLA created a network of enterprises such as farms, guest houses, and factories intended to financially support its own needs. One unintended side effect of the Deng-era economic reforms was that many of these enterprises became very profitable. For example, a military guest house intended for soldier recreation could be easily converted into a profitable hotel for civilian use. There were two main factors which increased PLA commercial involvement in the 1990s. One was that running profitable companies decreased the need for the state to fund the military from the [[government budget]]. The second was that in an environment where legal rules were unclear and political connections were important, PLA influence was very useful.{{Citation needed |date = October 2008}}\n\nBy the early 1990s party officials and high military officials were becoming increasingly alarmed at the military's commercial involvement for a number of reasons. The military's involvement in commerce was seen to adversely affect military readiness and spread corruption. Further, there was great concern that having an independent source of funding would lead to decreased loyalty to the party. The result of this was an effort to spin off the PLA's commercial enterprises into private companies managed by former PLA officers, and to reform military [[procurement]] from a system in which the PLA directly controls its sources of supply to a contracting system more akin to those of Western countries. The separation of the PLA from its commercial interests was largely complete by the year 2000. It was met with very little resistance, as the spinoff was arranged in such a way that few lost out.<ref name=scmp1884377/> The rapidly expanding [[CEFC China Energy]], that bought a $9 billion stake in [[Russia]]'s largest oil producer [[Rosneft]],<ref>\"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-02/why-cefc-spent-9-billion-on-rosneft-while-seeing-30-oil-risk Why an Enigmatic Chinese Company Just Spent $9 Billion on a Stake in Rosneft]\".
