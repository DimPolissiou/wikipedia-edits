[[Rail transport in India|Railway lines]] were cut, telegraph posts destroyed, government buildings burnt, and three Europeans murdered. By 13 April, the British government had decided to put most of Punjab under [[martial law]].

Reginald Dyer, the acting military commander for Amritsar and its environs, proceeded through the city with several city officials, announcing the implementation of a pass system to enter or leave Amritsar, a curfew beginning at 20:00 that night and a ban on all processions and public meetings of four or more persons. The proclamation was read and explained in English, Urdu, Hindi, and Punjabi, but few paid it any heed or appear to have learned of it later.<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 252-253</ref> Meanwhile, local police had received intelligence of the planned meeting in the Jallianwala Bagh through word of mouth and plainclothes detectives in the crowds. At 12:40, Dyer was informed of the meeting and returned to his base at around 13:30 to decide how to handle it.<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 253</ref>\n\nBy mid-afternoon, thousands of Indians had gathered in the [[Jallianwala Bagh]] (garden) near the [[Harmandir Sahib]] in Amritsar. Many who were present had earlier worshipped at the Golden Temple, and were passing through the Bagh on their way home. The Bagh was (and remains today) an open area of six to seven acres, roughly 200 yards by 200 yards in size, and surrounded on all sides by walls roughly 10 feet in height. Balconies of houses three to four stories tall overlooked the Bagh, and five narrow entrances opened onto it, several with lockable gates. During the rainy season, it was planted with crops, but served as a local meeting and recreation area for much of the year.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\">Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 254-255</ref> In the center of the Bagh was a ''samadhi'' (cremation site) and a large well partly filled with water which measured about 20 feet in diameter.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\"/>\n\nApart from pilgrims, Amritsar had filled up over the preceding days with farmers, traders, and merchants attending the annual Baisakhi horse and cattle fair. The city police closed the fair at 14:00 that afternoon, resulting in a large number of people drifting into the Jallianwala Bagh.\n\nDyer arranged for an aeroplane to overfly the Bagh and estimate the size of the crowd, that he reported was about 2000, while the [[Hunter Commission]] estimates a crowd of 1000 to 2500 had assembled by the time of Dyer's arrival.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\"/><ref name=\"Hunter\" /> Colonel Dyer and Deputy Commissioner Irving, the senior civil authority for Amritsar, took no actions to prevent the crowd assembling, or to peacefully disperse the crowds. This would later be a serious criticism levelled at both Dyer and Irving.\n \nAn hour after the meeting began as scheduled at 18:30, Colonel Dyer arrived at the Bagh with a group of ninety soldiers from the [[Gurkha| Gurkha Rifles]], the [[54th Sikhs (Frontier Force)|54th Sikhs]] and the [[59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force)|59th Sind Rifles]] .<ref name=\"archive.org\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/punjabdisturbanc01lahouoft|title=Punjab disturbances, April 1919; compiled from the Civil and military gazette|date=9 April 2018|publisher=Lahore Civil and Military Gazette Press|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Fifty of them were armed with [[.303 British|.303]] [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] bolt-action rifles. It is not clear whether Dyer had specifically chosen troops from that ethnic group due to their proven loyalty to the British or that they were simply the Sikh and non-Sikh units most readily available. He had also brought two armoured cars armed with machine guns; however, the vehicles were left outside, as they were unable to enter the Bagh through the narrow entrances. The Jallianwala Bagh was surrounded on all sides by houses and buildings and had only five narrow entrances, most kept permanently locked. The main entrance was relatively wide, but was guarded heavily by the troops backed by the armoured vehicles.\n\nDyer, without warning the crowd to disperse, blocked the main exits. He stated later that this act \"was not to disperse the meeting but to punish the Indians for disobedience.\"<ref name=\"Collett, p 255-58\">Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer'' p 255-58</ref> Dyer ordered his troops to begin shooting toward the densest sections of the crowd in front of the available narrow exits, where panicked crowds were trying to leave the Bagh. Firing continued for approximately ten minutes. Cease-fire was ordered only when ammunition supplies were almost exhausted, after approximately 1,650 rounds were spent.<ref name=\"Colletp262\"/>\n\nApart from the many deaths directly from the shooting, a number of people died of crushing in the stampedes at the narrow gates or by jumping into the solitary well on the compound to escape the shooting. A plaque, placed at the site after independence, states that 120 bodies were removed from the well. The wounded could not be moved from where they had fallen, as a curfew was declared, and more who had been injured then died during the night.<ref>Collett, Nigel (2006).

The Government of Punjab, criticised by the [[Hunter Commission]] for not gathering accurate figures, only offered an approximate figure of 200. When interviewed by the members of the committee a senior civil servant in Punjab admitted that the actual figure could be higher.<ref name=\"Hunter\" /> The Sewa Samiti society independently carried out an investigation and reported 379 deaths, and 192 seriously wounded.

Referred to as the Disorders Inquiry Committee, it was later more widely known as the Hunter Commission. It was named after the chairman, [[William Hunter, Lord Hunter|William, Lord Hunter]], former Solicitor-General for Scotland and Senator of the College of Justice in Scotland. The stated purpose of the commission was to \"investigate the recent disturbances in [[Bombay]], [[Delhi]] and Punjab, about their causes, and the measures taken to cope with them\".<ref name=\"col333-334\">{{cite book|pages=333\u2013334|title=The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer|first=Nigel |last=Collett|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn= 9781852855758|location=Amritsar (India)}}</ref> The members of the commission were:\n\n*Lord Hunter, Chairman of the Commission\n*Mr Justice George C.

Stokes, Secretary of the Commission and member of the Home Department<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAfter meeting in New Delhi on 29 October, the Commission took statements from witnesses over the following weeks. Witnesses were called in Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bombay, and Lahore. Although the Commission as such was not a formally constituted court of law, meaning witnesses were not subject to questioning under oath, its members managed to elicit detailed accounts and statements from witnesses by rigorous cross-questioning. In general, it was felt the Commission had been very thorough in its enquiries.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> After reaching Lahore in November, the Commission wound up its initial inquiries by examining the principal witnesses to the events in Amritsar.\n\nOn 19 November, Dyer was ordered to appear before the Commission. Although his military superiors had suggested he be represented by legal counsel at the inquiry, Dyer refused this suggestion and appeared alone.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> Initially questioned by Lord Hunter, Dyer stated he had come to know about the meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh at 12:40 hours that day but did not attempt to prevent it. He stated that he had gone to the Bagh with the deliberate intention of opening fire if he found a crowd assembled there. Patterson says Dyer explained his sense of honour to the Hunter Commission by saying, \"I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing, but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself.\"<ref>Steven Patterson, ''The cult of imperial honor in British India'' (2009) P. 67</ref> Dyer further reiterated his belief that the crowd in the Bagh was one of \"rebels who were trying to isolate my forces and cut me off from other supplies. Therefore, I considered it my duty to fire on them and to fire well\".<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAfter Mr. Justice Rankin had questioned Dyer, Sir Chimanlal Setalvad enquired:\n\n{{quote|Sir Chimanlal: Supposing the passage was sufficient to allow the armoured cars to go in, would you have opened fire with the machine guns?\n\nDyer: I think probably, yes.\n\nSir Chimanlal: In that case, the casualties would have been much higher?\n\nDyer: Yes.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>}}\n\nDyer further stated that his intentions had been to strike terror throughout Punjab and in doing so, reduce the moral stature of the \"rebels\". He said he did not stop the shooting when the crowd began to disperse because he thought it was his duty to keep shooting until the crowd dispersed, and that minimal shooting would not prove effective. In fact, he continued the shooting until the ammunition was almost exhausted.<ref>Nick Lloyd, ''The Amritsar Massacre: The Untold Story of One Fateful Day'' (2011) p. 157</ref> He stated that he did not make any effort to tend to the wounded after the shooting: \"Certainly not. It was not my job. Hospitals were open and they could have gone there.\"<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 337</ref>\n\nExhausted from the rigorous cross-examination questioning and unwell, Dyer was then released. Over the next several months, while the Commission wrote its final report, the British press, as well as many MPs, turned increasingly hostile towards Dyer as the full extent of the massacre and his statements at the inquiry became widely known.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> Lord Chelmsford refused to comment until the Commission had been wound up.

The common people and revolutionaries glorified the action of Udham Singh. Much of the press worldwide recalled the story of Jallianwala Bagh, and alleged O'Dwyer to have been responsible for the massacre. Singh was termed a \"fighter for freedom\" and his action was referred to in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper as \"an expression of the pent-up fury of the down-trodden Indian People\".<ref>''The Times'', London, 16 March 1940</ref> Reporter and historian [[William L.

At that time, many, including [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]], condemned the murder as senseless even if it was courageous.

[[Rail transport in India|Railway lines]] were cut, telegraph posts destroyed, government buildings burnt, and three Europeans murdered. By 13 April, the British government had decided to put most of Punjab under [[martial law]].

Reginald Dyer, the acting military commander for Amritsar and its environs, proceeded through the city with several city officials, announcing the implementation of a pass system to enter or leave Amritsar, a curfew beginning at 20:00 that night and a ban on all processions and public meetings of four or more persons. The proclamation was read and explained in English, Urdu, Hindi, and Punjabi, but few paid it any heed or appear to have learned of it later.<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 252-253</ref> Meanwhile, local police had received intelligence of the planned meeting in the Jallianwala Bagh through word of mouth and plainclothes detectives in the crowds. At 12:40, Dyer was informed of the meeting and returned to his base at around 13:30 to decide how to handle it.<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 253</ref>\n\nBy mid-afternoon, thousands of Indians had gathered in the [[Jallianwala Bagh]] (garden) near the [[Harmandir Sahib]] in Amritsar. Many who were present had earlier worshipped at the Golden Temple, and were passing through the Bagh on their way home. The Bagh was (and remains today) an open area of six to seven acres, roughly 200 yards by 200 yards in size, and surrounded on all sides by walls roughly 10 feet in height. Balconies of houses three to four stories tall overlooked the Bagh, and five narrow entrances opened onto it, several with lockable gates. During the rainy season, it was planted with crops, but served as a local meeting and recreation area for much of the year.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\">Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 254-255</ref> In the center of the Bagh was a ''samadhi'' (cremation site) and a large well partly filled with water which measured about 20 feet in diameter.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\"/>\n\nApart from pilgrims, Amritsar had filled up over the preceding days with farmers, traders, and merchants attending the annual Baisakhi horse and cattle fair. The city police closed the fair at 14:00 that afternoon, resulting in a large number of people drifting into the Jallianwala Bagh.\n\nDyer arranged for an aeroplane to overfly the Bagh and estimate the size of the crowd, that he reported was about 6,000, while the [[Hunter Commission]] estimates a crowd of 10,000 to 20,000 had assembled by the time of Dyer's arrival.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\"/><ref name=\"Hunter\" /> Colonel Dyer and Deputy Commissioner Irving, the senior civil authority for Amritsar, took no actions to prevent the crowd assembling, or to peacefully disperse the crowds. This would later be a serious criticism levelled at both Dyer and Irving.\n \nAn hour after the meeting began as scheduled at 18:30, Colonel Dyer arrived at the Bagh with a group of ninety soldiers from the [[Gurkha| Gurkha Rifles]], the [[54th Sikhs (Frontier Force)|54th Sikhs]] and the [[59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force)|59th Sind Rifles]] .<ref name=\"archive.org\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/punjabdisturbanc01lahouoft|title=Punjab disturbances, April 1919; compiled from the Civil and military gazette|date=9 April 2018|publisher=Lahore Civil and Military Gazette Press|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Fifty of them were armed with [[.303 British|.303]] [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] bolt-action rifles. It is not clear whether Dyer had specifically chosen troops from that ethnic group due to their proven loyalty to the British or that they were simply the Sikh and non-Sikh units most readily available. He had also brought two armoured cars armed with machine guns; however, the vehicles were left outside, as they were unable to enter the Bagh through the narrow entrances. The Jallianwala Bagh was surrounded on all sides by houses and buildings and had only five narrow entrances, most kept permanently locked. The main entrance was relatively wide, but was guarded heavily by the troops backed by the armoured vehicles.\n\nDyer, without warning the crowd to disperse, blocked the main exits. He stated later that this act \"was not to disperse the meeting but to punish the Indians for disobedience.\"<ref name=\"Collett, p 255-58\">Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer'' p 255-58</ref> Dyer ordered his troops to begin shooting toward the densest sections of the crowd in front of the available narrow exits, where panicked crowds were trying to leave the Bagh. Firing continued for approximately ten minutes. Cease-fire was ordered only when ammunition supplies were almost exhausted, after approximately 1,650 rounds were spent.<ref name=\"Colletp262\"/>\n\nApart from the many deaths directly from the shooting, a number of people died of crushing in the stampedes at the narrow gates or by jumping into the solitary well on the compound to escape the shooting. A plaque, placed at the site after independence, states that 120 bodies were removed from the well. The wounded could not be moved from where they had fallen, as a curfew was declared, and more who had been injured then died during the night.<ref>Collett, Nigel (2006).

The Government of Punjab, criticised by the [[Hunter Commission]] for not gathering accurate figures, only offered an approximate figure of 200. When interviewed by the members of the committee a senior civil servant in Punjab admitted that the actual figure could be higher.<ref name=\"Hunter\" /> The Sewa Samiti society independently carried out an investigation and reported 379 deaths, and 192 seriously wounded.

Referred to as the Disorders Inquiry Committee, it was later more widely known as the Hunter Commission. It was named after the chairman, [[William Hunter, Lord Hunter|William, Lord Hunter]], former Solicitor-General for Scotland and Senator of the College of Justice in Scotland. The stated purpose of the commission was to \"investigate the recent disturbances in [[Bombay]], [[Delhi]] and Punjab, about their causes, and the measures taken to cope with them\".<ref name=\"col333-334\">{{cite book|pages=333\u2013334|title=The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer|first=Nigel |last=Collett|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn= 9781852855758|location=Amritsar (India)}}</ref> The members of the commission were:\n\n*Lord Hunter, Chairman of the Commission\n*Mr Justice George C.

Stokes, Secretary of the Commission and member of the Home Department<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAfter meeting in New Delhi on 29 October, the Commission took statements from witnesses over the following weeks. Witnesses were called in Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bombay, and Lahore. Although the Commission as such was not a formally constituted court of law, meaning witnesses were not subject to questioning under oath, its members managed to elicit detailed accounts and statements from witnesses by rigorous cross-questioning. In general, it was felt the Commission had been very thorough in its enquiries.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> After reaching Lahore in November, the Commission wound up its initial inquiries by examining the principal witnesses to the events in Amritsar.\n\nOn 19 November, Dyer was ordered to appear before the Commission. Although his military superiors had suggested he be represented by legal counsel at the inquiry, Dyer refused this suggestion and appeared alone.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> Initially questioned by Lord Hunter, Dyer stated he had come to know about the meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh at 12:40 hours that day but did not attempt to prevent it. He stated that he had gone to the Bagh with the deliberate intention of opening fire if he found a crowd assembled there. Patterson says Dyer explained his sense of honour to the Hunter Commission by saying, \"I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing, but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself.\"<ref>Steven Patterson, ''The cult of imperial honor in British India'' (2009) P. 67</ref> Dyer further reiterated his belief that the crowd in the Bagh was one of \"rebels who were trying to isolate my forces and cut me off from other supplies. Therefore, I considered it my duty to fire on them and to fire well\".<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAfter Mr. Justice Rankin had questioned Dyer, Sir Chimanlal Setalvad enquired:\n\n{{quote|Sir Chimanlal: Supposing the passage was sufficient to allow the armoured cars to go in, would you have opened fire with the machine guns?\n\nDyer: I think probably, yes.\n\nSir Chimanlal: In that case, the casualties would have been much higher?\n\nDyer: Yes.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>}}\n\nDyer further stated that his intentions had been to strike terror throughout Punjab and in doing so, reduce the moral stature of the \"rebels\". He said he did not stop the shooting when the crowd began to disperse because he thought it was his duty to keep shooting until the crowd dispersed, and that minimal shooting would not prove effective. In fact, he continued the shooting until the ammunition was almost exhausted.<ref>Nick Lloyd, ''The Amritsar Massacre: The Untold Story of One Fateful Day'' (2011) p. 157</ref> He stated that he did not make any effort to tend to the wounded after the shooting: \"Certainly not. It was not my job. Hospitals were open and they could have gone there.\"<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 337</ref>\n\nExhausted from the rigorous cross-examination questioning and unwell, Dyer was then released. Over the next several months, while the Commission wrote its final report, the British press, as well as many MPs, turned increasingly hostile towards Dyer as the full extent of the massacre and his statements at the inquiry became widely known.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> Lord Chelmsford refused to comment until the Commission had been wound up. In the meanwhile, Dyer became seriously ill with [[jaundice]] and [[arteriosclerosis]], and was hospitalised.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAlthough the members of the Commission had been divided by racial tensions following Dyer's statement, and though the Indian members had written a separate, minority report, the final report, comprising six volumes of evidence and released on 8 March 1920, unanimously condemned Dyer's actions.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> In \"continuing firing as long as he did, it appears to us that General Dyer committed a grave error.\"<ref>Cyril Henry Philips, \"The evolution of India and Pakistan, 1858 to 1947: select documents\" p.214. Oxford University Press, 1962</ref> Dissenting members argued that the martial law regime's use of force was wholly unjustified. \"General Dyer thought he had crushed the rebellion and Sir [[Michael O'Dwyer]] was of the same view\", they wrote, \"(but) there was no rebellion which required to be crushed.\" The report concluded that:\n\n* Lack of notice to disperse from the Bagh, in the beginning, was an error.\n* The length of firing showed a grave error.\n* Dyer's motive of producing a sufficient moral effect was to be condemned.\n* Dyer had overstepped the bounds of his authority.\n* There had been no conspiracy to overthrow British rule in the Punjab.\n\nThe minority report of the Indian members further added that:\n\n* Proclamations banning public meetings were insufficiently distributed.\n* Innocent people were in the crowd, and there had been no violence in the Bagh beforehand.\n* Dyer should have either ordered his troops to help the wounded or instructed the civil authorities to do so.\n* Dyer's actions had been \"inhuman and un-British\" and had greatly injured the image of British rule in India.\n\nThe Hunter Commission did not impose any penal or disciplinary action because Dyer's actions were condoned by various superiors (later upheld by the Army Council).<ref name=\"churchillspeech\">{{cite web |date=8 July 1920 | title = Winston Churchill's speech in the House of Commons  | author1=Winston Churchill | url=http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/churchill/amritsar.htm |accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> The Legal and Home Members on the Viceroy's Council ultimately decided that, though Dyer had acted in a callous and brutal way, military or legal prosecution would not be possible due to political reasons. However, he was finally found guilty of a mistaken notion of duty and relieved of his command on 23 March. He had been recommended for a CBE as a result of his service in the Third Afghan War; this recommendation was cancelled on 29 March 1920.\n\n[[Reginald Dyer]] was disciplined by being removed from his appointment, was passed over for promotion and was prohibited from further employment in India.

The common people and revolutionaries glorified the action of Udham Singh. Much of the press worldwide recalled the story of Jallianwala Bagh, and alleged O'Dwyer to have been responsible for the massacre. Singh was termed a \"fighter for freedom\" and his action was referred to in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper as \"an expression of the pent-up fury of the down-trodden Indian People\".<ref>''The Times'', London, 16 March 1940</ref> Reporter and historian [[William L.

Although 1890 is generally accepted as his birth year, at various times he used four other birth years:<ref>Tran Dan Tien, Nhung mau chuyen ve doi hoat dong cua Ho Chu Tich (Hanoi:Nha Xuat Ban Van Hoc 1972) (1948).</ref> 1891,<ref>Yen Son. \"Nguyen Ai Quoc, the Brilliant Champion of the Revolution.\" Thuong Tin Hanoi. 30 August 1945.</ref> 1892,<ref>In his application to the French Colonial School \u2013 \"Nguyen Tat Thanh, born 1892 at Vinh, son of Mr. Nguyen Sinh Huy (subdoctor in literature)\"</ref> 1894<ref>He told Paris Police (Surete) he was born 15 January 1894.</ref> and 1895.<ref>Ton That Thien 18, 1890 is the most likely year of his birth.

He had three siblings: his sister B\u1ea1ch Li\u00ean (Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Thanh), a clerk in the [[French Army]]; his brother [[Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Khi\u00eam]] (Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5t \u0110\u1ea1t), a [[geomancy|geomancer]] and [[Traditional Chinese herbs|traditional herbalist]]; and another brother (Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Nhu\u1eadn), who died in infancy. As a young child, Cung (Ho) studied with his father before more formal classes with a scholar named Vuong Thuc Do.

His father was a Confucian scholar and teacher and later an imperial magistrate in the small remote district of Binh Khe ([[Qui Nh\u01a1n]]).

However, a document from the [[Archives Nationales d'Outre-mer|Centre des archives d'Outre-mer]] in France shows that he was admitted to ''Coll\u00e8ge Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ecdc'' on 8 August 1908, which was several months after the anti-''corv\u00e9e'' demonstration (9\u201313 April 1908).{{efn|name=\"HL1\"}} The exaggeration of revolutionary credentials was common among Vietnamese Communist leaders, as shown in North Vietnamese President [[T\u00f4n \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1eafng]]'s falsified participation in the 1919 Black Sea revolt.\n\nLater in life, he claimed the 1908 revolt had been the moment when his revolutionary outlook emerged,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} but his application to the French Colonial Administrative School in 1911 undermines this version of events, in which he stated that he left school to go abroad. Because his father had been dismissed, he no longer had any hope for a governmental scholarship and went southward, taking a position at D\u1ee5c Thanh school in [[Phan Thi\u1ebft]] for about six months, then traveled to [[Saigon]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nHe worked as a kitchen helper on a French steamer, the ''Amiral de Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville'', using the alias V\u0103n Ba. The steamer departed on 5 June 1911 and arrived in [[Marseille]], [[French Third Republic|France]] on 5 July 1911. The ship then left for [[Le Havre]] and [[Dunkirk]], returning to Marseille in mid-September. There, he applied for the French Colonial Administrative School, but his application was rejected. He instead decided to begin traveling the world by working on ships and visited many countries from 1911 to 1917.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n=== In the United States ===\nWhile working as the cook's helper on a ship in 1912, Th\u00e0nh (Ho) traveled to the United States.

Mus was a supporter of French colonialism in Vietnam and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh believed there was no danger of Chinese troops staying in Vietnam (although this was the time when China invaded Tibet). The Vietnamese at the time were busy spreading anti-French propaganda as evidence of French atrocities in Vietnam emerged while H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh showed no qualms about accepting Chinese aid after 1949.<ref>https://leminhkhai.wordpress.com/2012/09/01/ho-chi-minh-said-what/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203221545/https://leminhkhai.wordpress.com/2012/09/01/ho-chi-minh-said-what/ |date=3 February 2016 }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20141014090118/http://manoa.hawaii.edu/history/node/44 proof that he runs the blog]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://leminhkhai.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/chiang-kai-shek-and-vietnam-in-1945/|title=Chiang Kai-shek and Vietnam in 1945|date=25 April 2013|access-date=2 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313074939/https://leminhkhai.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/chiang-kai-shek-and-vietnam-in-1945/|archive-date=13 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Giap-Ho.jpg|thumb|upright|H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh (right) with [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] (left) in Hanoi, 1945]]\nThe Vi\u1ec7t Minh then collaborated with French colonial forces to massacre supporters of the Vietnamese nationalist movements in 1945\u20131946,<ref>{{cite book | last=Turner | first=Robert F. | title=Vietnamese Communism: Its Origins and Development | publisher=Hoover Institution Press | year=1975 | pages=57\u20139, 67\u20139, 74}} and {{cite book | chapter=Myths of the Vietnam War | title=Southeast Asian Perspectives | date=September 1972 | pages=14\u20138}}; also {{cite book | first=Arthur J. | last=Dommen | title=The Indochinese Experience of the French and the Americans | publisher=Indiana University Press | year=2001 | pages=153\u20134}}</ref> and of the Trotskyists.

In the final days of 1946, after a year of diplomatic failure and many concessions in agreements, such as the [[Da Lat|Dalat]] and [[Fontainebleau Agreements|Fontainebleau conferences]], the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] government found that war was inevitable. The [[Haiphong incident|bombardment of Haiphong]] by French forces at Hanoi only strengthened the belief that France had no intention of allowing an autonomous, independent state in Vietnam. The bombardment of Haiphong reportedly killed more than 6000 Vietnamese civilians. French forces marched into Hanoi, now the capital city of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. On 19 December 1946, after the Haiphong incident, Ho Chi Minh declared war against the [[French Union]], marking the beginning of the [[Indochina War]].<ref>[[:vi:L\u1eddi k\u00eau g\u1ecdi to\u00e0n qu\u1ed1c kh\u00e1ng chi\u1ebfn]]</ref> The [[Viet Minh|Vietnam National Army]], mostly armed with [[machete]]s and [[musket]]s immediately attacked.

In one corner of the room, a silver ice bucket contained ice and a bottle of good champagne, indicating that Ho expected the negotiations to succeed. One demand by the French was the return to French custody of a number of Japanese military officers (who had been helping the Vietnamese armed forces by training them in the use of weapons of Japanese origin) for them to stand trial for war crimes committed during World War II. H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh replied that the Japanese officers were allies and friends whom he could not betray, therefore he walked out to seven more years of war.<ref>Fall, Bernard.

During the 300 days, Di\u1ec7m and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] adviser Colonel [[Edward Lansdale]] staged a campaign to convince people to move to South Vietnam. The campaign was particularly focused on Vietnam's Catholics, who were to provide Di\u1ec7m's power base in his later years, with the use of the slogan \"God has gone south\".

The United States, with the support of Britain and the Associated States of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, suggested United Nations supervision.

First, this decree was issued in 1953 for the rent and interest reduction campaign that preceded the far more radical land redistribution and party rectification campaigns (or waves) that followed during 1954\u20131956. Second, the decree was meant to apply to free areas (under the control of the Viet Minh government), not to the areas under French control that would be liberated in 1954\u20131955 and that would experience a far more violent struggle. Thus the number of 13,500 executed people seems to be a low-end estimate of the real number. This is corroborated by Edwin Moise in his recent paper \"Land Reform in North Vietnam, 1953\u20131956\" presented at the 18th Annual Conference on SE Asian Studies, Center for SE Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley (February 2001). In this paper, Moise (7\u20139) modified his earlier estimate in his 1983 book (which was 5,000) and accepted an estimate close to 15,000 executions. Moise made the case based on Hungarian reports provided by Balazs, but the document I cited above offers more direct evidence for his revised estimate. This document also suggests that the total number should be adjusted up some more, taking into consideration the later radical phase of the campaign, the unauthorized killings at the local level, and the suicides following arrest and torture (the central government bore less direct responsibility for these cases, however).}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Szalontai|first=Balazs|title=Political and Economic Crisis in North Vietnam, 1955\u201356|url=https://6931dbf1-a-017ed1b7-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/uw.edu/vietnamstudiesgroup/discussion-networking/vsg-discussion-list-archives/vsg-discussion-2011/drv-1956-decree-law/DRV%201956%20decree%20law.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cp-R3ROUQ71qMNWrYB5PoNF4zn1AbM0d-9c6MUbPPZALpDk4hyV6rybi8TdtN5P2p0RcEVIf61wGGrE3q3U0Ygk3U_7T6BkroHF5SmJZ6PDXNmifl--nYT_pHqyHfloE0_ypCwab_ZbO9refyEGpHEyRLeKw8Jy7NhKZI1x8NJ2wbO13M8HjtaXiHEzzDP-Qzu-fiwM8GUMl932SmyYS98YsvPlvYpTRyUGWD7Dj3pLiRpibd5-V8swsU9n1F6Gr3bcVYQ58utuSNoi2H-S0kEjG4C4C0y_b_UQtj4ei3h8LAzGBAOUhCMHdf1Y1V0yCm91UdjrIKgNmXOWcLed3p8U7ORhpcqPAZJp_zttHhsiWo2D7lY%3D&attredirects=0|accessdate=30 November 2017|journal=[[Cold War History (journal)|Cold War History]]|volume=5|number=4|date=November 2005|pages=395\u2013426}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Vu |first=Tuong |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZbr9iD1HZ8C&q=15%2C000#v=snippet&q=15%2C000&f=false |title=Paths to Development in Asia: South Korea, Vietnam, China, and Indonesia |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2010 |isbn=9781139489010 |p=103 |quote=Clearly Vietnamese socialism followed a moderate path relative to China.

The offensive was executed at great cost and with heavy casualties on Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng's political branches and armed forces. The scope of the action shocked the world, which until then had been assured that the Communists were \"on the ropes\". The optimistic spin that the American military command had sustained for years was no longer credible. The bombing of Northern Vietnam and the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh trail was halted, and American and Vietnamese negotiators held discussions on how the war might be ended. From then on, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh and his government's strategy, based on the idea of avoiding conventional warfare and facing the might of the United States Army, which would wear them down eventually while merely prolonging the conflict, would lead to eventual acceptance of Hanoi's terms materialized.\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Hochiminh and Bebet.JPG|thumb|left|H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh holding his god-daughter, baby Elizabeth (Babette) Aubrac, with Elizabeth's mother, [[Lucie Aubrac|Lucie]], 1946]]\nIn addition to being a politician, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was also a writer, journalist, poet and [[polyglot]].

As in China, leading party cadres were \"most likely to be intellectuals descended [like Ho Chi Minh] from rural scholar-gentry families\" in the interior (the protectorates of Annam and Tonkin). Conversely, the pioneers of constitutional nationalism tended to be from the more \"Westernised\" coastal south (Saigon and surrounding French direct-rule [[Cochinchina]]) and to be from \"commercial families without a traditional Confucian background\".<ref>Duiker (1982), p. 25</ref>\n\n[[File:TTHCM.JPG|thumb|left|Shrine devoted to H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh]]\nIn Vietnam, as in China, Communism presented itself as a root and branch rejection of [[Confucianism]], condemned for its ritualism, inherent conservatism and resistance to change. Once in power, the Vietnamese Communists may not have fought Confucianism \"as bitterly as did their Chinese counterparts\", but its social prestige was \"essentially destroyed.\" In the political sphere, the puppet son of heaven (which had been weakly represented by the [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]]) was replaced by the people's republic. Orthodox materialism accorded no place to heaven, gods, or other supernatural forces. Socialist collectivism undermined the tradition of the Confucian family leader (''gia truong'').

Today H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh as the Jade Emperor is supposed to speak from the spirit world through Spiritualist mediums.

Although 1890 is generally accepted as his birth year, at various times he used four other birth years:<ref>Tran Dan Tien, Nhung mau chuyen ve doi hoat dong cua Ho Chu Tich (Hanoi:Nha Xuat Ban Van Hoc 1972) (1948).</ref> 1891,<ref>Yen Son. \"Nguyen Ai Quoc, the Brilliant Champion of the Revolution.\" Thuong Tin Hanoi. 30 August 1945.</ref> 1892,<ref>In his application to the French Colonial School \u2013 \"Nguyen Tat Thanh, born 1892 at Vinh, son of Mr. Nguyen Sinh Huy (subdoctor in literature)\"</ref> 1894<ref>He told Paris Police (Surete) he was born 15 January 1894.</ref> and 1895.<ref>Ton That Thien 18, 1890 is the most likely year of his birth. There is troubling conflicting evidence, however. When he was arrested in Hong Kong in 1931, he attested in court documents that he was 36.

He had three siblings: his sister B\u1ea1ch Li\u00ean (Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Thanh), a clerk in the [[French Army]]; his brother [[Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Khi\u00eam]] (Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5t \u0110\u1ea1t), a [[geomancy|geomancer]] and [[Traditional Chinese herbs|traditional herbalist]]; and another brother (Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Nhu\u1eadn), who died in infancy. As a young child, Cung (Ho) studied with his father before more formal classes with a scholar named Vuong Thuc Do.

His father was a Confucian scholar and teacher and later an imperial magistrate in the small remote district of Binh Khe ([[Qui Nh\u01a1n]]).

However, a document from the [[Archives Nationales d'Outre-mer|Centre des archives d'Outre-mer]] in France shows that he was admitted to ''Coll\u00e8ge Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ecdc'' on 8 August 1908, which was several months after the anti-''corv\u00e9e'' demonstration (9\u201313 April 1908).{{efn|name=\"HL1\"}} The exaggeration of revolutionary credentials was common among Vietnamese Communist leaders, as shown in North Vietnamese President [[T\u00f4n \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1eafng]]'s falsified participation in the 1919 Black Sea revolt.\n\nLater in life, he claimed the 1908 revolt had been the moment when his revolutionary outlook emerged,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} but his application to the French Colonial Administrative School in 1911 undermines this version of events, in which he stated that he left school to go abroad. Because his father had been dismissed, he no longer had any hope for a governmental scholarship and went southward, taking a position at D\u1ee5c Thanh school in [[Phan Thi\u1ebft]] for about six months, then traveled to [[Saigon]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nHe worked as a kitchen helper on a French steamer, the ''Amiral de Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville'', using the alias V\u0103n Ba. The steamer departed on 5 June 1911 and arrived in [[Marseille]], [[French Third Republic|France]] on 5 July 1911. The ship then left for [[Le Havre]] and [[Dunkirk]], returning to Marseille in mid-September. There, he applied for the French Colonial Administrative School, but his application was rejected.

Mus was a supporter of French colonialism in Vietnam and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh believed there was no danger of Chinese troops staying in Vietnam (although this was the time when China invaded Tibet). The Vietnamese at the time were busy spreading anti-French propaganda as evidence of French atrocities in Vietnam emerged while H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh showed no qualms about accepting Chinese aid after 1949.<ref>https://leminhkhai.wordpress.com/2012/09/01/ho-chi-minh-said-what/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203221545/https://leminhkhai.wordpress.com/2012/09/01/ho-chi-minh-said-what/ |date=3 February 2016 }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20141014090118/http://manoa.hawaii.edu/history/node/44 proof that he runs the blog]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://leminhkhai.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/chiang-kai-shek-and-vietnam-in-1945/|title=Chiang Kai-shek and Vietnam in 1945|date=25 April 2013|access-date=2 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313074939/https://leminhkhai.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/chiang-kai-shek-and-vietnam-in-1945/|archive-date=13 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Giap-Ho.jpg|thumb|upright|H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh (right) with [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] (left) in Hanoi, 1945]]\nThe Vi\u1ec7t Minh then collaborated with French colonial forces to massacre supporters of the Vietnamese nationalist movements in 1945\u20131946,<ref>{{cite book | last=Turner | first=Robert F. | title=Vietnamese Communism: Its Origins and Development | publisher=Hoover Institution Press | year=1975 | pages=57\u20139, 67\u20139, 74}} and {{cite book | chapter=Myths of the Vietnam War | title=Southeast Asian Perspectives | date=September 1972 | pages=14\u20138}}; also {{cite book | first=Arthur J. | last=Dommen | title=The Indochinese Experience of the French and the Americans | publisher=Indiana University Press | year=2001 | pages=153\u20134}}</ref> and of the Trotskyists.

In the final days of 1946, after a year of diplomatic failure and many concessions in agreements, such as the [[Da Lat|Dalat]] and [[Fontainebleau Agreements|Fontainebleau conferences]], the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] government found that war was inevitable. The bombardment of Haiphong by French forces at Hanoi only strengthened the belief that France had no intention of allowing an autonomous, independent state in Vietnam. The bombardment of Haiphong reportedly killed more than 6000 Vietnamese civilians. French forces marched into Hanoi, now the capital city of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. On 19 December 1946, after the Haiphong incident, Ho Chi Minh declared war against the [[French Union]], marking the beginning of the [[Indochina War]].<ref>[[:vi:L\u1eddi k\u00eau g\u1ecdi to\u00e0n qu\u1ed1c kh\u00e1ng chi\u1ebfn]]</ref> The [[Viet Minh|Vietnam National Army]], mostly armed with [[machete]]s and [[musket]]s immediately attacked.

When the French negotiators arrived at the meeting site, they found a mud hut with a thatched roof. Inside they found a long table with chairs. In one corner of the room, a silver ice bucket contained ice and a bottle of good champagne, indicating that Ho expected the negotiations to succeed. One demand by the French was the return to French custody of a number of Japanese military officers (who had been helping the Vietnamese armed forces by training them in the use of weapons of Japanese origin) for them to stand trial for war crimes committed during World War II. H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh replied that the Japanese officers were allies and friends whom he could not betray, therefore he walked out to seven more years of war.<ref>Fall, Bernard.

The campaign was particularly focused on Vietnam's Catholics, who were to provide Di\u1ec7m's power base in his later years, with the use of the slogan \"God has gone south\".

First, this decree was issued in 1953 for the rent and interest reduction campaign that preceded the far more radical land redistribution and party rectification campaigns (or waves) that followed during 1954\u20131956. Second, the decree was meant to apply to free areas (under the control of the Viet Minh government), not to the areas under French control that would be liberated in 1954\u20131955 and that would experience a far more violent struggle. Thus the number of 13,500 executed people seems to be a low-end estimate of the real number. This is corroborated by Edwin Moise in his recent paper \"Land Reform in North Vietnam, 1953\u20131956\" presented at the 18th Annual Conference on SE Asian Studies, Center for SE Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley (February 2001). In this paper, Moise (7\u20139) modified his earlier estimate in his 1983 book (which was 5,000) and accepted an estimate close to 15,000 executions. Moise made the case based on Hungarian reports provided by Balazs, but the document I cited above offers more direct evidence for his revised estimate. This document also suggests that the total number should be adjusted up some more, taking into consideration the later radical phase of the campaign, the unauthorized killings at the local level, and the suicides following arrest and torture (the central government bore less direct responsibility for these cases, however).}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Szalontai|first=Balazs|title=Political and Economic Crisis in North Vietnam, 1955\u201356|url=https://6931dbf1-a-017ed1b7-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/uw.edu/vietnamstudiesgroup/discussion-networking/vsg-discussion-list-archives/vsg-discussion-2011/drv-1956-decree-law/DRV%201956%20decree%20law.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cp-R3ROUQ71qMNWrYB5PoNF4zn1AbM0d-9c6MUbPPZALpDk4hyV6rybi8TdtN5P2p0RcEVIf61wGGrE3q3U0Ygk3U_7T6BkroHF5SmJZ6PDXNmifl--nYT_pHqyHfloE0_ypCwab_ZbO9refyEGpHEyRLeKw8Jy7NhKZI1x8NJ2wbO13M8HjtaXiHEzzDP-Qzu-fiwM8GUMl932SmyYS98YsvPlvYpTRyUGWD7Dj3pLiRpibd5-V8swsU9n1F6Gr3bcVYQ58utuSNoi2H-S0kEjG4C4C0y_b_UQtj4ei3h8LAzGBAOUhCMHdf1Y1V0yCm91UdjrIKgNmXOWcLed3p8U7ORhpcqPAZJp_zttHhsiWo2D7lY%3D&attredirects=0|accessdate=30 November 2017|journal=[[Cold War History (journal)|Cold War History]]|volume=5|number=4|date=November 2005|pages=395\u2013426}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Vu |first=Tuong |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZbr9iD1HZ8C&q=15%2C000#v=snippet&q=15%2C000&f=false |title=Paths to Development in Asia: South Korea, Vietnam, China, and Indonesia |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2010 |isbn=9781139489010 |p=103 |quote=Clearly Vietnamese socialism followed a moderate path relative to China.

The scope of the action shocked the world, which until then had been assured that the Communists were \"on the ropes\". The optimistic spin that the American military command had sustained for years was no longer credible. The bombing of Northern Vietnam and the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh trail was halted, and American and Vietnamese negotiators held discussions on how the war might be ended. From then on, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh and his government's strategy, based on the idea of avoiding conventional warfare and facing the might of the United States Army, which would wear them down eventually while merely prolonging the conflict, would lead to eventual acceptance of Hanoi's terms materialized.\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Hochiminh and Bebet.JPG|thumb|left|H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh holding his god-daughter, baby Elizabeth (Babette) Aubrac, with Elizabeth's mother, [[Lucie Aubrac|Lucie]], 1946]]\nIn addition to being a politician, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was also a writer, journalist, poet and [[polyglot]].

As in China, leading party cadres were \"most likely to be intellectuals descended [like Ho Chi Minh] from rural scholar-gentry families\" in the interior (the protectorates of Annam and Tonkin). Conversely, the pioneers of constitutional nationalism tended to be from the more \"Westernised\" coastal south (Saigon and surrounding French direct-rule [[Cochinchina]]) and to be from \"commercial families without a traditional Confucian background\".<ref>Duiker (1982), p. 25</ref>\n\n[[File:TTHCM.JPG|thumb|left|Shrine devoted to H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh]]\nIn Vietnam, as in China, Communism presented itself as a root and branch rejection of [[Confucianism]], condemned for its ritualism, inherent conservatism and resistance to change. Once in power, the Vietnamese Communists may not have fought Confucianism \"as bitterly as did their Chinese counterparts\", but its social prestige was \"essentially destroyed.\" In the political sphere, the puppet son of heaven (which had been weakly represented by the [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]]) was replaced by the people's republic. Orthodox materialism accorded no place to heaven, gods, or other supernatural forces. Socialist collectivism undermined the tradition of the Confucian family leader (''gia truong'').

Today H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh as the Jade Emperor is supposed to speak from the spirit world through Spiritualist mediums.

All three candidates in the Smith set are majority-preferred over D (since 60% rank each of them over D). The Smith set is not {A,B,C,D} because the definition calls for the ''smallest'' subset that meets the other conditions. The Smith set is not {B,C} because B is not majority-preferred over A; 65% rank A over B. (Etc.)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! pro\\con !! A !! B !! C !! D\n|-\n!

The term top cycle may be somewhat misleading, however, since the Smith set can contain candidates that do not cycle. For examples, when there is a Condorcet winner it doesn't cycle with any alternatives, and when the Smith set consists only of two alternatives that tie pairwise, the two do not cycle with any alternatives.\n\n==Other criteria==\n\nAny election method that complies with the Smith criterion also complies with the [[Condorcet criterion]], since if there is a Condorcet winner, then it is the only candidate in the Smith set.

Miller (1977, p.&nbsp;775) lists GOCHA as an alternate name for the Smith set, but it actually refers to the Schwartz set.  The Schwartz set is actually a subset of the Smith set (and equal to it if there are no pairwise ties between members of the Smith set).\n\n==Complying methods==\n\nThe Smith criterion is satisfied by [[Ranked Pairs]], [[Schulze method|Schulze's method]], [[Nanson's method]], the Robert's Rules method for voting on motions & amendments, and several other methods.\n\nMethods failing the Condorcet criterion also fail the Smith criterion. Some Condorcet methods, such as [[Minimax Condorcet|Minimax]], also fail the Smith criterion.\n\nVoting methods that fail the Smith criterion can be modified to satisfy it (typically at the expense of other criteria).

She became known for roles in independent films such as 1989's ''[[The Unbelievable Truth (film)|The Unbelievable Truth]]'' and 1990's ''[[Trust (1990 film)|Trust]]''. She wrote, co-starred in, and directed the 2007 posthumously-released film ''[[Waitress (film)|Waitress]]''.\n\nOn November 1, 2006, Shelly was found dead, hanging in the shower of her [[Greenwich Village]] work studio apartment. The initial examination of the scene did not reveal any suspicious circumstances, and police apparently believed it to be a suicide. Her husband insisted she would never have taken her own life, and brought about a re-examination of the bathroom that disclosed a suspect footprint.  Police arrested a 19-year-old man who confessed to killing Shelly and making it look as if she had committed suicide.\n\nShelly's husband established the Adrienne Shelly Foundation, which awards scholarships, production grants, finishing funds, and living stipends to artists. In her honor, the [[Women Film Critics Circle]] gives an annual Adrienne Shelly Award to the film that it finds \"most passionately opposes violence against women.\"\n\n==Early life==\nShelly was born Adrienne Levine in [[Queens]] to Sheldon M.
