[[Iain Armitage]] stars as young Sheldon, alongside [[Zoe Perry]], [[Lance Barber]], [[Montana Jordan]], Raegan Revord, and [[Annie Potts]]. [[Jim Parsons]], who portrays the adult Sheldon Cooper on ''The Big Bang Theory'', narrates the series and serves as an [[executive producer]].\n\nDevelopment of the prequel series began in November 2016, from an initial idea that Parsons passed along to ''The Big Bang Theory'' producers. The following March, Armitage and Perry were cast, and the series was ordered by CBS. The series premiered as a special preview on September 25, 2017, and two days later, CBS picked up the series for a full season of 22 episodes. From November 2, 2017, new episodes began airing weekly. In January 2018, CBS renewed the series for a second season which premiered on September 24, 2018, and in February 2019, for a third and fourth season, with the third season having premiered on September 26, 2019.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\nThe series takes place in the late 1980s and early 1990s; and follows [[Sheldon Cooper]] as a young boy attending high school in the fictional town of Medford, [[Texas]], aged nine in the first season<ref name=\"YoungSheldonOrdered\" /> as he tries to fit into the world around him while his family and friends attempt to deal with his unique intellectual capabilities and social challenges.<ref name=\"YoungSheldonOrdered\" /><ref name=\"PremiereDate\" />\n\nIn the series premiere, adult Sheldon states that \"nobody I knew in [[East Texas]] in 1989 cared about [[Newtonian physics]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/young-sheldon-is-the-anti-big-bang-theory-thats-why-its-great|title=\u2018Young Sheldon\u2019 Is the Anti-\u2018Big Bang Theory.\u2019 That\u2019s Why It\u2019s Great.|first=Kevin|last=Fallon|date=September 25, 2017|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|access-date=October 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130112352/https://www.thedailybeast.com/young-sheldon-is-the-anti-big-bang-theory-thats-why-its-great|archive-date=November 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>{{efn|Dr. Sturgis and Dr. Linkletter, two college physics professors who teach the classes in which Sheldon enrolls, are not introduced until Season 1 Episode 19 and Season 2 Episode 13 respectively.}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Iain Armitage]] as [[Sheldon Cooper]], a [[child prodigy]] with a \"once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science\".

The series is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] prequel to ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' and begins with the character [[Sheldon Cooper]] at the age of nine, living with his family in [[East Texas]] and going to high school. [[Iain Armitage]] stars as young Sheldon, alongside [[Zoe Perry]], [[Lance Barber]], [[Montana Jordan]], Raegan Revord, and [[Annie Potts]]. [[Jim Parsons]], who portrays the adult Sheldon Cooper on ''The Big Bang Theory'', narrates the series and serves as an [[executive producer]].\n\nDevelopment of the prequel series began in November 2016, from an initial idea that Parsons passed along to ''The Big Bang Theory'' producers. The following March, Armitage and Perry were cast, and the series was ordered by CBS. The series premiered as a special preview on September 25, 2017, and two days later, CBS picked up the series for a full season of 22 episodes. From November 2, 2017, new episodes began airing weekly. In January 2018, CBS renewed the series for a second season which premiered on September 24, 2018, and in February 2019, for a third and fourth season, with the third season having premiered on September 26, 2019.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\nThe series takes place in the late 1980s and early 1990s; and follows [[Sheldon Cooper]] as a young boy attending high school in the fictional town of Medford, [[Texas]], aged nine in the first season<ref name=\"YoungSheldonOrdered\" /> as he tries to fit into the world around him while his family and friends attempt to deal with his unique intellectual capabilities and social challenges.<ref name=\"YoungSheldonOrdered\" /><ref name=\"PremiereDate\" />\n\nIn the series premiere, adult Sheldon states that \"nobody I knew in [[East Texas]] in 1989 cared about [[Newtonian physics]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/young-sheldon-is-the-anti-big-bang-theory-thats-why-its-great|title=\u2018Young Sheldon\u2019 Is the Anti-\u2018Big Bang Theory.\u2019 That\u2019s Why It\u2019s Great.|first=Kevin|last=Fallon|date=September 25, 2017|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|access-date=October 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130112352/https://www.thedailybeast.com/young-sheldon-is-the-anti-big-bang-theory-thats-why-its-great|archive-date=November 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>{{efn|Dr. Sturgis and Dr. Linkletter, two college physics professors who teach the classes in which Sheldon enrolls, are not introduced until Season 1 Episode 19 and Season 2 Episode 13 respectively.}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Iain Armitage]] as [[Sheldon Cooper]], a [[child prodigy]] with a \"once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science\".

To do so, he again needs the help of Reggie Hammond (Murphy), who is a newly released convict. At the same time, a mastermind known only as the Iceman has hired a biker gang to kill Reggie.\n\n==Plot==\nVeteran San Francisco police inspector Jack Cates has been after drug dealer \"the Iceman\" for the past four years. At the Hunter's Point Raceway, Jack confronts Tyrone Burroughs and Arthur Brock. Jack kills Brock, while Burroughs escapes. Despite killing Brock in self-defense, Jack is now under investigation, as Brock's gun cannot be found at the scene. Blake Wilson, the head of the Internal Affairs division, becomes determined to prosecute Jack on a third-degree [[manslaughter]] charge. Jack finds a picture that proves that the Iceman has put a price on the head of Reggie Hammond, who is scheduled to be released from prison the next day.\n\nReggie has completed his prison term for robbing a payroll (a crime for which he claims complete innocence), and is scheduled to be released. Jack tries to convince Reggie to help him clear his name and find the Iceman. Reggie requests that Jack gives him the $500,000 that Jack has been holding on to for him. Jack refuses to give Reggie the money unless Reggie helps him. After the bus transporting Reggie is attacked by two bikers and Jack gets shot, Jack forces Reggie to help him by having the hospital release Reggie into his custody. Reggie recognizes one of the two bikers as Richard \"Cherry\" Ganz, the brother of Albert Ganz, the escaped convict Jack killed years earlier. Cherry and his partner Willie Hickok are the hitmen who have been hired to kill Reggie. Burroughs, who works for the Iceman, was trying to hire Brock as insurance, just in case Cherry and Hickok failed. When the Iceman murders Cherry and Hickok's primary contact man, Malcolm Price, Hickok kills Burroughs, after the latter reveals himself to be an associate for the Iceman.\n\nReggie is captured by Cherry and Hickok, and Jack confronts the two criminals at a local nightclub where Ben Kehoe\u2014Jack's friend and fellow officer\u2014is revealed to be the Iceman, with another detective, Frank Cruise, serving as an accomplice. A gunfight ensues, with Jack wounding Hickok and killing Cruise. After killing both Hickok and Cherry, Reggie is held captive by Kehoe and used as a human shield. Reggie sarcastically begs Jack to shoot him. Jack does so, firing a shot into Reggie's shoulder, wounding him and throwing him off Kehoe. Jack then shoots Kehoe, killing him. Before Reggie is transported to the hospital, he and Jack share a few parting words. As the ambulance leaves with Reggie, Jack realizes that Reggie has once again stolen his lighter.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as Reggie Hammond\n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Jack Cates\n* [[Brion James]] as Ben Kehoe/Iceman\n* [[Kevin Tighe]] as Lieutenant Blake Wilson\n* [[Ed O'Ross]] as Frank Cruise\n* David Anthony Marshall as Willie Hickok\n* [[Andrew Divoff]] as Richard \"Cherry\" Ganz\n* [[Bernie Casey]] as Kirkland Smith\n* [[Brent Jennings]] as Tyrone Burroughs\n* [[Ted Markland]] as Malcolm Price\n* [[Tisha Campbell-Martin|Tisha Campbell]] as Amy Smith\n* [[Felice Orlandi]] as the Warden\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nEddie Murphy had been paid $200,000 for his role in the original film.

[[Frank McRae]]'s reprisal of his role from the original ''48 Hrs.'' was entirely cut except for a brief, uncredited shot of him in the background of one scene in the police station. Also removed was a scene which was partially shown in the theatrical trailer in which Jack explains to Reggie that he has a deadline to track down the Iceman; as such, there is no mention of '48 hours' anywhere in the final film. [[Brion James]], also returning from the original, saw his role severely cut down as well, to create a faster-paced action-comedy. In an interview, James said this about the cuts made on the film:{{cquote|[[Total Recall (1990 film)|''Total Recall'']] came out a week before Another 48 Hrs.

My stuff was in there until one week before the film opened; that is when they cut twenty-five minutes out of that movie, a week before it opened. It went from around 140 to down around 95 minutes.

To do so, he again needs the help of Reggie Hammond (Murphy), who is a newly released convict. At the same time, a mastermind known only as the Iceman has hired a biker gang to kill Reggie.\n\n==Plot==\nVeteran San Francisco police inspector Jack Cates has been after drug dealer \"the Iceman\" for the past four years. At the Hunter's Point Raceway, Jack confronts Tyrone Burroughs and Arthur Brock. Jack kills Brock, while Burroughs escapes. Despite killing Brock in self-defense, Jack is now under investigation, as Brock's gun cannot be found at the scene. Blake Wilson, the head of the Internal Affairs division, becomes determined to prosecute Jack on a third-degree [[manslaughter]] charge. Jack finds a picture that proves that the Iceman has put a price on the head of Reggie Hammond, who is scheduled to be released from prison the next day.\n\nReggie has completed his prison term for robbing a payroll (a crime for which he claims complete innocence), and is scheduled to be released. Jack tries to convince Reggie to help him clear his name and find the Iceman. Reggie requests that Jack gives him the $500,000 that Jack has been holding on to for him. Jack refuses to give Reggie the money unless Reggie helps him. After the bus transporting Reggie is attacked by two bikers and Jack gets shot, Jack forces Reggie to help him by having the hospital release Reggie into his custody. Reggie recognizes one of the two bikers as Richard \"Cherry\" Ganz, the brother of Albert Ganz, the escaped convict Jack killed years earlier. Cherry and his partner Willie Hickok are the hitmen who have been hired to kill Reggie. Burroughs, who works for the Iceman, was trying to hire Brock as insurance, just in case Cherry and Hickok failed. When the Iceman murders Cherry and Hickok's primary contact man, Malcolm Price, Hickok kills Burroughs, after the latter reveals himself to be an associate for the Iceman.\n\nReggie is captured by Cherry and Hickok, and Jack confronts the two criminals at a local nightclub where Ben Kehoe\u2014Jack's friend and fellow officer\u2014is revealed to be the Iceman, with another detective, Frank Cruise, serving as an accomplice. A gunfight ensues, with Jack wounding Hickok and killing Cruise. After killing both Hickok and Cherry, Reggie is held captive by Kehoe and used as a human shield. Reggie sarcastically begs Jack to shoot him. Jack does so, firing a shot into Reggie's shoulder, wounding him and throwing him off Kehoe. Jack then shoots Kehoe, killing him. Before Reggie is transported to the hospital, he and Jack share a few parting words.

It is in the [[ecclesiastical province]] of [[Province of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Dublin]]. Previously the cathedral of the [[Bishop of Clonfert|Diocese of Clonfert]], it is now one of three cathedrals in the [[Diocese of Limerick and Killaloe|United Dioceses of Limerick and Killaloe]]. \n\nThe current building was erected in the 12th century at the site of an earlier 6th century church founded by [[Saint Brendan]], which was associated with a [[monastery]] he founded and at which he was buried. The Dean of the Cathedral is the Very Reverend Gary Paulsen who is also [[Dean of Killaloe]], [[Dean of Kilfenora]] and both Dean and Provost of [[Kilmacduagh]].\n\n[[Image:ClonfertCathedral Doorway.JPG|thumb|150px|left|Detail of doorway]]\n[[Image:ClonfertCathedral Nave.JPG|thumb|150px|left|Nave]]\n\n==Description of the cathedral==\nThe earliest part of the church dates back to around 1180.<ref>\"The Cathedrals of the [[Church of Ireland]]\" [[John Godfrey FitzMaurice Day|Day, J.G.F./]] [[Henry Edmund Patton|Patton, H.E.]] p149: [[London]], [[SPCK|S.P.C.K.]], [[1932]]</ref> Its doorway is the crowning achievement of [[Romanesque sculpture|Hiberno-Romanesque]] style. It is in six [[Order (mouldings)|order]]s, and has a large variety of [[motif (art)|motifs]], animal heads, [[foliage]], human heads etc. Above the doorway is a pointed hood enclosing triangles alternating with bizarre human heads, and below this is an [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]] enclosing more human heads. The early 13th century east windows in the [[chancel]] is an example of a late Romanesque windows. The chancel arch was inserted in the 15th century, and is decorated with angels, a rosette and a [[mermaid]] carrying a mirror. The supporting arches of the tower at the west end of the church are also decorated with 15th century heads, and the innermost order of the Romanesque doorway was also inserted at this time. The [[sacristy]] is also 15th century. The church had a Romanesque south [[transept]], which is now in ruins, and a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] north transept, which has been removed. In the [[Roman Catholic]] church one mile to the south is a 14th-century wooden statue of the [[Madonna and Child]], and on the roadside near this church is a 16th-century tower-house.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Clofert_door_top_2006-06-21.JPG\nImage:Clonfert_door_2006-06-21.JPG\nImage:Clonfert_mermaid_crop.jpg\nImage:Clonfert_mermaid_crop_(adjusted)_2006-06-21.jpg\nImage:Clonfert_angels-_north_2006-06-21.JPG\nImage:Clonfert_angels-north_(ajusted)_20006-06-21.jpg\nImage:Clonfert_angels-_south_(adjusted)_2006-06-21.jpg\nImage:Clonfert_angel_&_dragon.JPG\nImage:Clonfert_mermaid_&_angels_2006-06-21.JPG\nImage:Clofert Cathedral 2006-06-21.jpg \n</gallery>\n\n==Preservation==\nClonfert Cathedral was included in the [[2000 World Monuments Watch]] by the [[World Monuments Fund]]. The soft sandstone structure had weathered severely, and prior conservation efforts, which did not fully address all the building's problems, as well as substantial biological growth, had compounded the deterioration. Due to the limited resources of the dwindling congregation, [[American Express]] provided financial assistance through the organization.<ref>[http://www.wmf.org/project/saint-brendans-cathedral World Monuments Fund: Saint Brendan's Cathedral, Clonfert, Galway, Ireland]</ref>\n\n==Clonfert in the Annals==\n* 561 - ''In which the battle of C\u00fal Dreimne is what is to be recorded, and in which Ainmire, son of S\u00e9tna, and Ainnedid son of Fergus, and Domnall were victors.

In the [[Roman Catholic]] church one mile to the south is a 14th-century wooden statue of the [[Madonna and Child]], and on the roadside near this church is a 16th-century tower-house.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Clofert_door_top_2006-06-21.JPG\nImage:Clonfert_door_2006-06-21.JPG\nImage:Clonfert_mermaid_crop.jpg\nImage:Clonfert_mermaid_crop_(adjusted)_2006-06-21.jpg\nImage:Clonfert_angels-_north_2006-06-21.JPG\nImage:Clonfert_angels-north_(ajusted)_20006-06-21.jpg\nImage:Clonfert_angels-_south_(adjusted)_2006-06-21.jpg\nImage:Clonfert_angel_&_dragon.JPG\nImage:Clonfert_mermaid_&_angels_2006-06-21.JPG\nImage:Clofert Cathedral 2006-06-21.jpg \n</gallery>\n\n==Preservation==\nClonfert Cathedral was included in the [[2000 World Monuments Watch]] by the [[World Monuments Fund]]. The soft sandstone structure had weathered severely, and prior conservation efforts, which did not fully address all the building's problems, as well as substantial biological growth, had compounded the deterioration. Due to the limited resources of the dwindling congregation, [[American Express]] provided financial assistance through the organization.<ref>[http://www.wmf.org/project/saint-brendans-cathedral World Monuments Fund: Saint Brendan's Cathedral, Clonfert, Galway, Ireland]</ref>\n\n==Clonfert in the Annals==\n* 561 - ''In which the battle of C\u00fal Dreimne is what is to be recorded, and in which Ainmire, son of S\u00e9tna, and Ainnedid son of Fergus, and Domnall were victors.

O'Conor and the Sil-Murray went to Clonmacnoise on that night, and early next morning embarked in their fleet, and sailed up the Shannon until they came to Lough Ree. A violent storm arose on the lake, by which their vessels were separated from each other; and the storm so agitated the vessel in which O'Conor was, that it could not be piloted. Such was the fury of the storm, it foundered, and all the crew perished, except O'Conor himself and six others. In this vessel with O'Conor (Cathal Crovderg) were Areaghtagh O'Rodiv and Conor, son of Cathal, who were both drowned, as were also Conor and Auliffe, the two sons of Hugh Mageraghty; O'Mulrenin, and the son of O'Monahan, and many others.''\n* 1195 - ''Donnell \u00d3 Finn, Coarb of Clonfert-Brendan, died.''\n* 1202 - ''Murtough O'Carmacan, Bishop of Clonfert-Brendan, died.''\n* 1266 - ''A bishop-elect came from Rome to Clonfert-Brendan, and the dignity of bishop was conferred on him, and on Tom\u00e1s\u00d3  Mhiadhach\u00e1n, at [[Athenry]], on the Sunday before Christmas.''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04064b.htm Article on Clonfert] from the Catholic Encyclopedia\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=hBEHAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA30&dq=monastery+clonfert&hl=en&sa=X&ei=CLd2U_fPONWcqAav24K4Cw&ved=0CFcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=monastery%20clonfert&f=false ''Ecclesiastical history of Ireland, from the first introduction of Christianity to the beginning of the thirteenth century''], John Lanigan, 1829\n\n==See also==\n* [[Abbot of Clonfert]]\n* [[Bishop of Clonfert]]\n* [[Dean of Killaloe and Clonfert]]\n* [[Cormac mac Ceithearnach]]\n* [[List of abbeys and priories in the Republic of Ireland#County Galway|List of abbeys and priories in the Republic of Ireland (County Galway)]]\n* [[List of cathedrals in Ireland]]\n\n{{Cathedrals of the Church of Ireland}}\n\n[[Category:Anglican cathedrals in the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Diocese of Limerick and Killaloe]]\n[[Category:Churches in County Galway]]\n[[Category:Romanesque architecture]]\n[[Category:Pre-Reformation Roman Catholic cathedrals]]\n", "name_user": "Srnec", "label": "safe", "comment": "dab", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonfert_Cathedral"}
