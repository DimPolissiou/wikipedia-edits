Apart from a short [[Street running|street-running]] section in [[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]], the line has its own [[Right-of-way (transportation)|reservation]], with minimal interference from road traffic.\n\nThe service is free in the city centre and along the route to the [[Adelaide Entertainment Centre]] in [[Hindmarsh, South Australia|Hindmarsh]]. The service is also free along the length of [[Jetty Road, Glenelg]] to [[Moseley Square]]. Three routes in total operate on the network: Glenelg to the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]] with select peak services that continue to the [[Adelaide Entertainment Centre]]; Glenelg to the [[Adelaide Festival Centre]], which operates only on weekends and [[Adelaide Oval]] event days; and the Adelaide Entertainment Centre to the [[Adelaide Botanic Garden]].\n\nA 1.6 kilometre northern extension through the city centre opened in October 2007, extending the line from [[Victoria Square, Adelaide|Victoria Square]] along [[King William Street, Adelaide|King William Street]] and [[North Terrace]] to [[Morphett Street, Adelaide|Morphett Street]]. A further 2.8 kilometre north western extension of the line along [[Port Road, Adelaide|Port Road]] to the Adelaide Entertainment Centre opened in March 2010.

It used the tracks of the [[South Australian Railways]] (SAR) between Adelaide and [[Mile End railway station, Adelaide|Mile End]] while a depot was built at St Leonards. Whilst one line was a profitable proposition, two were not, and both lines were almost immediately in financial trouble and merged to form the Glenelg Railway Company on 11 May 1882. A connecting line was laid along Brighton Road and the South Terrace depot closed.<ref name=TW147/><ref name=TW185/>\n\nIn 1882, a horse tramway was laid along King William Street parallel to the railway. Local services between Angas Street and Goodwood were introduced by the railway using a Merryweather tram motor with an unpowered Rowan car as a trailer. In 1883 the SAR's [[Belair railway line|Belair line]] was extended towards the South Coast and crossed the Glenelg line at [[Goodwood railway station|Goodwood station]] via a [[Level junction|flat crossing]].<ref name=TW147/>\n\nThe Holdfast Bay line was the most unprofitable of the two, this being partly due to excessive charges by the SAR for use of its line. Moves were made to close the line but these met with strong opposition as closure would isolate Glenelg from the rest of the state. To overcome this it was proposed to lay in a connection at Goodwood.<ref name=TW147/>\n\nIn December 1899 the private company was acquired by the SAR, who continued to operate the line as a steam railway. The Glenelg line was duplicated from Goodwood to Brighton Road by 1910. The Holdfast Bay line was also duplicated from Mile End to St Leonards by 1914 with raised platforms being provided at most stations. To help reduce working expenses it was proposed to deviate the Holdfast Bay line to join the other at [[Morphettville]] and although a line was built, no connection was made and it was only used for race traffic. The Adelaide tramways had been electrified and to enable the line in King William Street to be duplicated, the railway was cut back to South Terrace in 1914. Railway passengers were carried by tram to [[Victoria Square, Adelaide|Victoria Square]].<ref name=TW147/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59402332 |title=Glenelg Railway |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)]] |volume=LXXIX |issue=21,078 |location=South Australia |date=2 June 1914 |accessdate=13 June 2016 |page=13 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n===Municipal Tramways Trust===\n[[File:adelaide trammap 1950s.png|thumb|The electric tram network in the late 1950s]]\nIn 1927 ownership and operation transferred from the SAR to the [[Municipal Tramways Trust]] (MTT).

These were trams specially constructed to carry race horses from stables located along the line to [[Morphettville Racecourse]].<ref name=TransAdelaide>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051217101048/http://www.transadelaide.com.au/transadelaide_info/trams.htm Trams] TransAdelaide</ref> This service was a carry-over from the days of the steam railway, which had also performed this function. Another unusual feature was operation of triple sets of H type trams in peak hours, and express trams that ran non-stop over a significant portion of the route. In 2006, only one express service remained.\n\nThe line was the only route to survive the closure of Adelaide\u2019s street tramway network during the 1950s, saved largely by its high proportion of [[reserved track]], which enables fast journey for passengers and minimal interference with road traffic.\n\nIn the mid-1970s around 3,000 trips to the city were made \"on an average day\".<ref>{{citation|last=Madigan|first=J.F.|year=1977|page=7|url=http://www.atrf.info/papers/1977/1977_Madigan.pdf |title=The Pedestrian Network in the Adelaide Core Area|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref> The depot was relocated on 19 October 1986 from the corner of [[Angas Street, Adelaide|Angas Street]] and Victoria Square in central Adelaide to a new facility at [[Glengowrie, South Australia|Glengowrie]], close to Glenelg.<ref>New Glenelg Tram Depot Opens ''Trolley Wire'' issue 227 December 1986 pages 7-9</ref>\n\n===Renaissance===\n[[File:Trams at Glenelg.jpg|thumb|Two trams wait at the [[Moseley Square]] terminus prior to the reconfiguration of the stop]]\nIn the 21st century, a series of investments were made to improve and extend the line.

[[Concrete sleeper]]s were installed and much of the track renewed in an intensive nine-week project. Most of the 21 tram stops were reconstructed with higher platforms to allow level access to the new low-floor trams. The overhead electrical supply was upgraded and some minor modifications were made to the H type trams and Glengowrie depot. Tram services were replaced with substitute bus services during this period. Services resumed on 8 August 2005.

A further 2.8 kilometre north western extension of the line along [[Port Road, Adelaide|Port Road]] to the Adelaide Entertainment Centre opened in March 2010.

It used the tracks of the [[South Australian Railways]] (SAR) between Adelaide and [[Mile End railway station, Adelaide|Mile End]] while a depot was built at St Leonards. Whilst one line was a profitable proposition, two were not, and both lines were almost immediately in financial trouble and merged to form the Glenelg Railway Company on 11 May 1882. A connecting line was laid along Brighton Road and the South Terrace depot closed.<ref name=TW147/><ref name=TW185/>\n\nIn 1882, a horse tramway was laid along King William Street parallel to the railway. Local services between Angas Street and Goodwood were introduced by the railway using a Merryweather tram motor with an unpowered Rowan car as a trailer. In 1883 the SAR's [[Belair railway line|Belair line]] was extended towards the South Coast and crossed the Glenelg line at [[Goodwood railway station|Goodwood station]] via a [[Level junction|flat crossing]].<ref name=TW147/>\n\nThe Holdfast Bay line was the most unprofitable of the two, this being partly due to excessive charges by the SAR for use of its line. Moves were made to close the line but these met with strong opposition as closure would isolate Glenelg from the rest of the state. To overcome this it was proposed to lay in a connection at Goodwood.<ref name=TW147/>\n\nIn December 1899 the private company was acquired by the SAR, who continued to operate the line as a steam railway. The Glenelg line was duplicated from Goodwood to Brighton Road by 1910. The Holdfast Bay line was also duplicated from Mile End to St Leonards by 1914 with raised platforms being provided at most stations. To help reduce working expenses it was proposed to deviate the Holdfast Bay line to join the other at [[Morphettville]] and although a line was built, no connection was made and it was only used for race traffic. The Adelaide tramways had been electrified and to enable the line in King William Street to be duplicated, the railway was cut back to South Terrace in 1914. Railway passengers were carried by tram to [[Victoria Square, Adelaide|Victoria Square]].<ref name=TW147/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59402332 |title=Glenelg Railway |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)]] |volume=LXXIX |issue=21,078 |location=South Australia |date=2 June 1914 |accessdate=13 June 2016 |page=13 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n===Municipal Tramways Trust===\n[[File:adelaide trammap 1950s.png|thumb|The electric tram network in the late 1950s]]\nIn 1927 ownership and operation transferred from the SAR to the [[Municipal Tramways Trust]] (MTT).

Another unusual feature was operation of triple sets of H type trams in peak hours, and express trams that ran non-stop over a significant portion of the route.

In 1961 he recorded and performed live one of his own compositions, \"Bluesette\", which featured him playing guitar and whistling.

He was known for his harmonica playing, as well as his guitar, [[Puccalo|whistling]] skills, and composing. According to jazz historian [[Ted Gioia]], his most important contribution was in \"championing the humble harmonica\", which Thielemans made into a \"legitimate voice in jazz\".<ref>Gioia, Ted.

He emigrated to the U.S. in 1951, becoming a citizen in 1957. From 1953 to 1959 he played with [[George Shearing]], and then led his own groups on tours in the U.S. and Europe. In 1961 he recorded and performed live one of his own compositions, \"Bluesette\", which featured him playing guitar and whistling. In the 1970s and 1980s, he continued touring and recording, appearing with musicians such as [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Bill Evans]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Kenny Werner]], [[Pat Metheny]], [[Jaco Pastorius]], [[Elis Regina]] and [[Paquito D'Rivera]].\n\nAmong the film soundtracks that Thielemans recorded are ''[[The Pawnbroker (film)|The Pawnbroker]]'' (1964), ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' (1969), ''[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]'' (1972), ''[[Cinderella Liberty]]'' (1973), ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'' (1974) and ''[[Looking for Mr. Goodbar (film)|Looking for Mr. Goodbar]]'' (1977).

However a vigil Mass may be held on the evening before a Holy Day; thus it has become customary to celebrate Mass on the evening of New Year's Eve. (New Year's Eve is a [[Silvester|feast day]] honoring [[Pope Sylvester I]] in the Roman Catholic calendar, but it is not widely recognized in the United States.){{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nMany Christian congregations have New Year's Eve [[watchnight service]]s.

In [[Caracas]], the bells of the Cathedral of Caracas ring twelve times.<ref name=\":0\" /> During these special programs, is a tradition to broadcast songs about the end of the year. It is a non-working holiday. Popular songs include \"Viejo a\u00f1o\" (\"Old year\"), by [[Gaita Zuliana|Gaita]] group [[Maracaibo 15]], and \"Cinco pa' las 12\" (\"Five minutes before twelve\"), which was versioned by several popular singers including Nestor Zavarce, Nancy Ramos and [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez El Puma]]. The unofficial hymn for the first minutes of the New Year is \"A\u00f1o Nuevo, Vida Nueva\" (\"New Year, New Life\"), by the band Billo's Caracas Boys. Many people play the national anthem in their houses.\n\nTraditions include wearing yellow underwear, eating [[Pan de jam\u00f3n]], and 12 grapes with sparkling wine.\n\nSpecial holiday programs are broadcast on Venezuelan television stations including [[Venevision]].\n\n==Asia==\n===Bangladesh===\nThe New Year celebrations take place in all around the country mostly in [[Dhaka]], [[Chittagong]], [[Sylhet]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Khulna]], [[Barishal]], [[Cox's Bazar]] etc. The celebrations mostly take place at night. On this day, people go to the parties at club or hotels, beaches, at the crowdy roadsides and bridges where firecrackers are blast out in the sky at night. The roadsides and bridges are also lighted up by colourful lights at night. People do a get-together as well as enjoy with their families.

The [[Christians]] go to the churches for a watch night service till midnight, praying for blessing in the coming new year as it is also part of the [[Christmastide]] season observances.\n\n===China===\nIn [[China]], although the celebrations of the [[Chinese New Year|Lunar New Year]] are not until a few weeks after the Gregorian New Year, celebrations of the Gregorian New Year are held in some areas, particularly in major cities. For example, celebrations with fireworks and rock concerts have taken place in [[Beijing]]'s Solana Blue Harbor Shopping Park, while cultural shows and other events are held at the city's Millennium Monument, [[Temple of Heaven]], [[Great Wall of China]], [[Olympic Green]], and the [[Summer Palace]]. Since 2011, a light and sound show has been held at [[The Bund (Shanghai)|The Bund]] in [[Shanghai]], a few minutes before midnight.\n\n====Hong Kong====\n[[File:HK NYE.jpg|thumb|Fireworks display in [[Hong Kong]].]]\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], many gather in shopping districts like [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], [[Causeway Bay]] and [[Tsim Sha Tsui]]. Beginning in 2008, a 60-second numerical countdown to New Year's, consisting of [[LED]] lights and pyrotechnic display effects, on the facade of [[Two International Finance Centre]] was launched, followed by a fireworks display, alongside an exhibition of the [[A Symphony of Lights|Symphony of Lights]]. For the arrival of 2013, the [[Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre]] initiated the countdown, while the fireworks display and A Symphony of Lights show were extended to eight minutes.\n\nShopping malls are often major celebration venues. The [[Times Square (Hong Kong)|Times Square]] shopping mall, for instance, holds their own celebration of the ball drop held at [[Times Square]], [[New York City]]. There are also various district-wide celebrations.\n\n===Central Asia===\nIn [[Central Asia]], New Year's Eve celebrations were inherited from Soviet traditions; thus they are similar to those of Russia. An example of such traditions would be the playing of the national anthem at midnight and the presidential address before it.\n\n===India===\nIn India as a land of diverse cultures and practices, apart from the Gregorian new year, there is Parsi New Year, Hindu New Year(which might differ from region to region), Muslim New Year, etc. Celebration for culture-specific new years is different from the celebrations of the Gregorian new year. Gregorian new year celebration is mostly by way of parties late night and a working holiday followed by it. Most celebrations for December 31 take place in the major metropolitan cities like [[Kochi]], [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Bangalore]], [[Pune]], [[Ahmedabad]]. New Year is also celebrated in other cities and towns around the country like [[Agra]], [[Bhubaneswar]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Cuttack]], [[Vadodara]], etc., There are lots of shows, events, awards and parties organized all over India. Big and small celebrities and personalities perform as well as enjoy in these parties. Many Discos and Pubs organize big singers, DJs or local talent to liven up the night with their music and songs.

More often people like to celebrate New Year Eve with their family. Hotels and resorts are also decked up in anticipation of tourist arrival and intense competition makes them entice the tourists with exciting New Year offers. Many people across the country also follow old traditions. The[[Christians|Christian]] community often go to church for a watch night service till midnight praying for blessing in the coming new year.\n\n===Indonesia===\nNew Year's Eve celebrations in [[Medan]] ([[Capital city|capital]] of [[North Sumatra]]), included the [[:id:Dunia Terbalik|Dunia Terbalik New Year Countdown Celebrations fireworks]] which was part of the event called \"[[Pelita Harapan University|Medan Pelita Harapan University]] Down Eve Countdown.\" The event, which celebrated the arrival of 2018, attracted 400,000 spectators along both sides of the [[CIMB Niaga]]. The [[countdown]] was televised live in [[Indonesia]] via [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] [[high-definition television|high-definition]] on [[satellite television|satellite transmission]], and aired on [[RCTI|RCTI HD]]'s [[:id:Dunia Terbalik|Dunia Terbalik]] and was sponsored by [[Charoen Pokphand Foods|Fiesta Black Tea]]. It included various national performances such as the \"Dunia Terbalik All Star\" performance, which reached more than 1.9 million viewers. Over 200 local and overseas media organizations covered the spectacular that generated a publicity value of more than [[Indonesian rupiah|RP]]1000 million.\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main|\u014cmisoka}}\n[[File:Tokyo Tower in New Year's Eve 2012.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Tokyo Tower on New Year's Eve, 2012]]\nIn [[Japan]], New Year's Eve is used to prepare for and welcome ''Toshigami'' (\u5e74\u795e), the New Year's god. People clean their home and prepare [[Kadomatsu]] or [[Shimenawa]] to welcome the god before New Year's Eve. Buddhist temples ring their bells 108 times<ref name=telegraph/> at midnight in the traditional ''Joya no Kane'' (\u9664\u591c\u306e\u9418). The rings represent the 108 elements of ''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|bon\u014d]]'' (\u7169\u60a9), mental states that lead people to take unwholesome actions.\n\nIn most cities and urban areas across Japan, New Year's Eve celebrations are usually accompanied by concerts, countdowns, fireworks and other events. In [[Tokyo]], the two most crowded celebrations are held at the Shibuya crossing in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] and the [[Z\u014dj\u014d-ji|Zojoji Temple]] in [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]]. People gather around the Zojoji Temple to release helium balloons with New Year's wishes up in the sky and watch the lighting of [[Tokyo Tower]] and [[Tokyo Skytree]] with a year number displayed on the observatory at the stroke of midnight.\n\nThree notable music-oriented television specials air near New Year's Eve. Since 1951, [[NHK]] has traditionally broadcast ''{{nihongo|[[K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen]]|\u7d05\u767d\u6b4c\u5408\u6226}}'' (''Red/White Singing Battle'') on New Year's Eve, a music competition where two teams of popular musicians (the red and white teams, which predominantly contain female and male performers respectively) perform songs, with the winning team determined by a panel of judges and televotes. The special is traditionally one of the most-watched television programs of the year in Japan. Although it did air on 31 December from 1959 to 2006, the [[Japan Record Award]]s ceremony, recognizing outstanding achievements in the [[Music of Japan|Japanese music industry]], is held annually on 30 December since 2007 and is broadcast by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]. Since 1996, [[Fuji Television]] has broadcast ''Johnny's Countdown''\u2014a live concert at the [[Tokyo Dome]] organized by the talent agency [[Johnny & Associates]].\n\n===Korea===\nThere are two New Years celebrated in both [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]], which are Lunar New Year and Solar New Year. The Solar New Year are always celebrated on the first day of January while Lunar New Year varies. Sometimes there are some traits that both North and South Korea celebrate, while some traits are celebrated differently or only on one side.\n\nIn both Koreas, they call New Year's Day \uc124\ub0a0 (Seoll-Nal). They eat a special soup called \ub5a1\uad6d (Tteok-Guk) which is a hot soup with thin, flat rice cakes and most of the times, eggs are inserted. The Koreans believe that one would get to earn one age if the soup is eaten New Year's Day. They say if one dares to not eat the soup on New Year's Day, then he or she will lose luck.\n\nMost cities and urban areas in both Koreas host New Year's Eve gatherings. In South Korea, two of the biggest celebrations take place in [[Seoul]]: the ringing of [[Bosingak]] bell 33 times at midnight and fireworks display at [[Myeong-dong]], and an LED laser light show and fireworks display at the [[Lotte World Tower]] in [[Songpa District|Songpa-gu]]. In [[Pyongyang]], North Korea, the chimes of the clock at the Grand People's Study House and the national fireworks display along [[Kim Il-sung Square]], [[Juche Tower]] and the surrounding areas signal the start of the New Year. The celebration in Pyongyang, however, also marks the beginning of the [[North Korean calendar]] or the Juche Year, which is based on 15 April 1912, [[Kim Il-sung]]'s date of birth, the celebrations are more recent in origin with the fireworks displays dating from 2013.\n\nFor 2018-2019, Kim Il-sung Square held its first large-scale public celebration, which featured a concert performance by the state [[Moranbong Band]], midnight fireworks, and a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] light show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nknews.org/2018/12/north-korea-rings-in-new-year-with-midnight-concert-drone-show/|title=North Korea rings in new year with midnight concert, drone show|date=1 January 2019|website=NK News|language=en-US|access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Malaysia===\n[[File:2018 New Year Fireworks in George Town, Penang.jpg|left|thumb|Fireworks in [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Penang]] on 1 January 2018]]\n[[File:MALAM TAHUN BARU (5309956791).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Fireworks in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia]]\n''Ambang Tahun Baru'', a celebration sponsored by the government was held at [[Dataran Merdeka|Merdeka Square]], the field opposite the [[Sultan Abdul Samad Building]] in the [[Malaysia]]n capital of [[Kuala Lumpur]] in the early days.

As a modern tradition, New Year's Eve as well as New Year's Day are public holidays, and are two of the biggest holidays of the year. They celebrate New Year's Eve with their family. It is common, just like in the former Soviet Union, that the [[National Anthem of Mongolia]] is to be played at the midnight hour on television.\n\n===Pakistan===\nNew Year's Eve is usually celebrated with fireworks in big cities (e.g. [[Lahore]], [[Karachi]] and [[Islamabad]]). Musical nights and concerts are also held.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nMany Pakistani youngsters enjoy the type of celebrations held the world over. The elite and educated classes participate in night-long activities in urban and cosmopolitan cities like Karachi, Lahore, and the capital of Islamabad.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Philippines===\nIn the [[Philippines]], New Year's Eve (''Bisperas ng Bagong Taon'') is a special non-working holiday. [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] usually celebrate New Year's Eve in the company of family or close friends. Traditionally, most households would visit the churches and attend year-end service and afterwards, would host or attend a midnight feast called the ''Media Noche''. Typical dishes included holiday fare, ''[[pancit]]'' (for long life) and ''[[Jam\u00f3n|Ham\u00f3n]]''. ''[[Lechon]]'' (roasted pig), is usually prepared, as is barbecued food. Some refrain from serving chicken, as their scratching and pecking for food is unlucky, being an idiom for a hand-to-mouth existence.\n\nMany opt to wear new, bright, or colourful clothes with circular patterns, such as [[polka dot]]s, or display sweets and twelve round fruits as the centrepiece, in the belief that circles attract money and fortune and that candies represent a sweeter year ahead. Several customs must only be done at midnight: some throw about coins to increase wealth in the coming year, or jump to increase their height, while some follow the [[Spanish influence on Filipino culture|Spanish custom]] of eating twelve grapes, one for each month of the year. People also make loud noises by blowing on cardboard or plastic horns, called ''torotot'', banging on pots and pans, playing loud music, blowing car horns, or by igniting firecrackers, in the belief that the din scares away bad luck and evil spirits. [[Bamboo cannon]]s are also fired on the night in some places.\n\nUrban areas usually host many New Year's Eve parties and countdown celebrations hosted by the private sector with the help of the local government. These parties, which include balls hosted by hotels, usually display their own fireworks and are often very well-attended. Within Metro Manila, popular locations for celebrations include the area along [[Manila Bay]] at [[Roxas Boulevard]] or [[Luneta Park]] in [[Manila]], the intersection of Ayala and Makati Avenues in [[Makati City]], [[Resorts World Manila]] and [[SM Mall of Asia]] in [[Pasay City]], [[Quezon Memorial Circle]] in Diliman and [[Eastwood City]] in Libis, [[Quezon City]], [[Bonifacio Global City]] in [[Taguig City]], [[Entertainment City]] in [[Para\u00f1aque|Para\u00f1aque City]], and the [[Philippine Arena]] at [[Ciudad de Victoria]] in [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue]] and [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]], [[Bulacan]].

It is a public holiday. In most cities and urban areas across [[Thailand]], New Year's Eve celebrations are accompanied by countdowns, fireworks, concerts and other major events, notably, the CentralWorld Square at [[CentralWorld]] and the area along [[Chao Phraya River]] at [[ICONSIAM]] and [[Asiatique]] in [[Bangkok]], and the Pattaya Beach in [[Pattaya]], while public places such as hotels, pubs, restaurants and nightclubs, also host New Year's Eve parties by offering food, entertainment and music to the guests, and they usually stay open until the next morning.\n{{-}}\n\n==Europe==\n===Albania===\nPreparations for New Year's Eve in [[Albania]] start with the Christmas tree, which in Albania is known as \"New Year's Tree\" or \"New Year's Pine\".

Many people dance to this at parties or in the street. Large crowds gather in the streets of Vienna, where the municipal government organises a series of stages where bands and orchestras play. Fireworks are set off by both municipal governments and individuals.\n\n===Belgium===\nIn [[Belgium]], New Year's Eve (''Sint Sylvester Vooravond'' (\"Saint Sylvester's Eve\") or ''Oudjaar'' (\"old year\")) is celebrated with family parties, called ''r\u00e9veillons'' in the [[Wallonia|French speaking areas]]. On television, a stand-up comedian reviews the past year after which a musical or variety show signals midnight, when everyone kisses, exchanges good luck greetings, and toasts the New Year and absent relatives and friends with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]. Many people light fireworks or go into the street to watch them. Most cities have their own fireworks display: the most famous is at [[Mont des Arts]] in Brussels. Cities, caf\u00e9s and restaurants are crowded. Free bus services and special New Year's Eve taxis (the ''Responsible Young Drivers'') bring everyone home afterwards.\n\nOn 1 January (''Nieuwjaarsdag'' in Dutch) children read their \"New Year's letter\" and give holiday greeting cards of decorated paper featuring golden cherubs and angels, colored roses and ribbon-tied garlands to parents and godparents, on decorated paper.\n\nBelgian farmers also wish their animals a happy New Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartanplace.com/newyear/newyrcustom/belgium.html|title=Belgian New Year: Sint Sylvester Vooranvond|author= Christine OKeeffe|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Bosnia and Herzegovina===\nNew Year is widely celebrated in [[Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]].

New Year's Eve is the noisiest day of the year. People generally gather with friends at parties, in pubs, clubs, in the streets, or city squares to eat, drink, and celebrate the new year. Fireworks are a popular tradition; in large cities such as [[Bratislava]], or [[Prague]], the fireworks start before noon and steadily increase until midnight. In the first minutes after midnight, people toast with champagne, wish each other a happy new year, fortune and health, and go outside for the fireworks.\n\nIn both countries all major TV stations air entertainment shows before and after the midnight countdown, which is followed by the National anthem of each country. The Presidents of the republics gave their [[New Year speech]] in the morning \u2013 the new Czech President Milo\u0161 Zeman renewed the tradition of Christmas speeches. In recent years however the Czechoslovak national anthem is played at midnight, in honor of the shared history of both nations.\n\n===Denmark===\n[[File:CopenhagenNYE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|New Year fireworks over [[Copenhagen]]]]\nPeople in [[Denmark]] may go to parties or entertain guests at home.

Meals should not be completely finished\u2014some food should be left for ancestors and spirits who visit the house on New Year's Eve.\n\nTraditional New Year food includes pork with sauerkraut or Estonian sauerkraut (''mulgikapsad''), baked potatoes and swedes with hog's head, and white and blood sausage. Vegetarians can eat potato salad with navy beet{{clarify|date=January 2012}} and p\u00e2t\u00e9. Gingerbread and marzipan are very popular for dessert. Traditional New Year drinks include beer and mead, but mulled wine and champagne have become modern favourites.\n\n===Finland===\nIn [[Finland]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with family or friends. Late supper is served, often featuring wieners, [[Janssons frestelse]], and potato salad. Some municipalities organize fireworks at midnight. Consumer fireworks are also very popular. A Finnish tradition is [[molybdomancy]] \u2013 to tell the fortunes of the New Year by melting \"tin\" (actually lead) in a tiny pan on the stove and throwing it quickly in a bucket of cold water. The resulting blob of metal is analyzed, for example by interpreting shadows it casts by candlelight. These predictions are however never taken seriously.\n\nThe Finnish Broadcasting Company broadcasts the reception of the New Year at [[Helsinki Senate Square]]. Countdown to New Year is with the [[Helsinki Cathedral]] clock. In the afternoon programme, the German comedy sketch ''[[Dinner for One]]'' is shown every year. On the radio, just before midnight, the poem ''Hymyilev\u00e4 Apollo'' (Smiling Apollo) by [[Eino Leino]] is read.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |title=Eino Leino |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305170013/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |archivedate=5 March 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n===France===\n[[File:Eiffel Tower on the New Year Eve at midnight.webm|thumb|(video) Celebrations in 2014]]\nIn [[France]], New Year's Eve (''la Saint-Sylvestre'') is usually celebrated with a feast, ''le R\u00e9veillon de la Saint-Sylvestre''<ref>\"[https://www.vibescout.com/fr/post/reveillon-du-nouvel le R\u00e9veillon de la Saint-Sylvestre]\" .Vibescout.com.

A traditional type of flat pastry cake, ''la galette des rois'', made of two sheets of puff pastry, filled with ''frangipane'' (almond paste) is eaten. The cake contains a ''f\u00e8ve'', a small china doll; whomever finds it becomes king or queen and gets to wear a gold paper crown and choose his or her partner. This tradition can last up to two weeks.\n\n===Germany===\nIn [[Germany]], parties are common on New Year's Eve. Fireworks are very popular, both with individuals and at large municipal displays. 31 December and the three days leading up to it are the only four days of the year on which fireworks may be sold in Germany. Every year [[Berlin]] hosts one of the largest New Year's Eve celebrations in all of Europe, attended by over a million people. The focal point is the [[Brandenburg Gate]], where midnight fireworks are centered. Germans toast the New Year with a glass of [[Sparkling wine#Sekt|Sekt]] (German sparkling wine) or champagne.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Molybdomancy]] {{lang|de|(Bleigie\u00dfen)}} is another German New Year's Eve tradition, which involves telling fortunes by the shapes made by molten lead dropped into cold water. Other auspicious actions are to touch a chimney sweep or rub some ash on your forehead for good luck and health. [[Berliner (doughnut)|Jam-filled doughnuts]] with or without alcoholic fillings are eaten. Finally a tiny [[marzipan pig]] is consumed for more good luck.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In some northern regions of Germany (e.g. [[East Frisia]]) the making of ''{{ill|Speckendicken|de}}'' (also {{lang|de|Speckdicken}}) is another tradition \u2013 people go door to door visiting their neighbors and partaking in this dish.

The version traditionally broadcast on German television was originally recorded in 1963, and was occasionally used as filler programming by [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] due to popular demand; in 1972, ''Dinner for One'' received its traditional New Year's Eve scheduling. The sketch, as well as its catchphrase \"the same procedure as every year\", are well known in German pop culture. ''Dinner for One'' is also broadcast on or around New Year's Eve in other European countries, although it is, ironically, relatively unknown in the United Kingdom.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/12/30/bvdinner30.xml | title = Gesundheit to an old favourite | author = Peake, Mike | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= 30 December 2006 | accessdate = 1 January 2007 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=\"slate-dinnerforone\">{{cite web|title=The Mystery of Dinner for One|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2005/12/the_mystery_of_dinner_for_one.html|website=Slate|accessdate=18 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Greece===\nA midnight fireworks display is held over the historic [[Parthenon]] temple in the capital of [[Athens]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-38477734|title=World celebrations ring in new year|work=BBC News|date=2017-01-01|access-date=2020-01-07|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nA common tradition among [[Greek Orthodox]] families is the cutting of a [[vasilopita]] (\"King's pie\" or \"St. Basil's pie\") at midnight.

The accompanying beverage is traditionally beer (commonly either Christmas beer or lager beer). Dessert will often be vanilla pudding or rice cream, and there will be cakes and coffee later in the evening \u2013 commonly accompanied by a glass of cognac. Then, at close to 12 am on New Year's Day, people will go outside to send up fireworks. Fireworks are only permitted to be sold to the general public on the days leading up to New Year's Eve, and only to be launched that night.\n\nDue to the general use of fireworks, more fires occur on New Year's Eve than on any other day of the year in Norway.

The tradition is to drink champagne and eat twelve raisins \u2013 one for each month of the year, making a wish for each. Another Portuguese tradition is a special cake called ''[[Bolo-Rei]]'' (literally: King Cake). ''Bolo-Rei'' is a round cake with a large hole in the centre, resembling a crown covered with crystallised and dried fruit. It is baked from a soft, white dough, with raisins, various nuts and crystallised fruit. Inside is hidden the characteristic ''fava'' ([[broad bean]]). Tradition dictates that whoever finds the ''fava'' has to pay for the ''Bolo-Rei'' next year. Initially, a small prize (usually a small metal toy) was also included within the cake. However, the inclusion of the prize was forbidden by the European Union for safety reasons. The Portuguese brought the recipe of the ''[[Gateau des Rois]]'' from France in the second half of the 19th century. To this day, this recipe is a very well kept secret.\n\nIn [[Lisbon]] the New Year is celebrated with a grand concert. The New Year's Concert is held at the CCB ([[Centro Cultural de Bel\u00e9m]]) on the evening of 1 January, featuring the prestigious Lisbon Metropolitan Orchestra.\n\n===Romania===\n[[File:Vanghelion.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Romexpo]] indoors during ''Vanghelion'' New Year's Eve party.]]\nTraditional celebrations of New Year's Eve (''Revelion'') are the norm in [[Romania]]. Romanians follow centuries-old customs, rituals, and conventions. Children sing \"[[Plugu\u0219orul]]\" and \"Sorcova\", traditional carols that wish goodwill, happiness and success.\n\nParties are common in the evening. Since the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], Romanians have gathered in the [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]] in [[Bucharest]]. Other significant parties occur in [[Pia\u021ba Constitu\u021biei]].

The practices date back to the early 20th century: due to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]'s stance of [[state atheism]] and a larger series of [[Soviet anti-religious legislation|anti-religious policies]], the celebration of Christmas and other religious holidays was widely discouraged. In particular, [[Christmas tree]]s were singled out for originating from [[World War I]] enemy [[Germany]], and being a symbol of the [[bourgeoisie]]. In 1935, Soviet politician [[Pavel Postyshev]] and other high-ranking officials began to promote the concept of New Year trees as a wide, secular tradition\u2014representing happiness and prosperity among youth. Even with the reinstatement of religious holidays after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Novy God has remained a popular celebration in modern Russia.<ref name=\"Father Frost and the Snow Maiden deliver Russia's winter warmer, by Helen Womack, 31 December 1996\">{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/father-frost-and-the-snow-maiden-deliver-russias-winter-warmer-1316564.html| title=Father Frost and the Snow Maiden deliver Russia's winter warmer, by Helen Womack, 31 December 1996| accessdate=12 December 2010| newspaper=The Independent| location=London| date=31 December 1996}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.calvertjournal.com/articles/show/9424/yolka-russia-new-year-tree-pagan-soviet-christmas|title=Yolka: the story of Russia's 'New Year tree', from pagan origins to Soviet celebrations|website=The Calvert Journal|language=en|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"MIG\">{{cite book|title=Echo of Islam|year=1993|publisher=MIG|quote=In the former Soviet Union, fir trees were usually put up to mark New Year's day, following a tradition established by the officially atheist state.}}</ref><ref name=\"Dice2009\">{{cite book|last=Dice|first=Elizabeth A.|title=Christmas and Hanukkah|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438119717|page=44|quote=The Christmas tree, or Yolka, is another tradition that was banned during the Soviet era.

Indoors, families celebrate New Year's Eve with an abundance of food. Serbs decorate trees, ''Novogodi\u0161nja jelka'', at New Year's Eve, rather than at Christmas Eve. Near, or after midnight, Santa Claus (''Deda Mraz'') visits houses and leaves presents under the tree, to be unpacked then or, if the family is asleep, to be discovered in the morning.\n\nSerbian New Year's celebrations take place in [[Belgrade]], and several other major cities such as [[Novi Sad]] and [[Ni\u0161]]. As of mid-December, cities are extensively decorated and lit. The decorations remain until way into January due to the influence of the [[Julian calendar]]. Throughout the region, especially amongst former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] republics, Belgrade is the most popular destination for major parties.\n\nOn 13 January, a large part of the population{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} celebrates \"[[Old New Year|Serbian New Year]]\", according to the Julian calendar. Usually, one concert is organized in front of either City Hall or the National Parliament in Belgrade, while fireworks are prepared by the Serbian Orthodox Church and fired from the [[Cathedral of Saint Sava]], where people also gather. Other cities also organize such celebrations.\n\n===Slovenia===\nIn [[Slovenia]], New Year's Eve is known as a Saint Sylvester's Day (Silvestrovo). Streets are decorated for December. In larger cities like [[Ljubljana]], [[Maribor]], [[Celje]] or [[Koper]] there are concerts, culture programmes and countdowns followed by fireworks. There is also a special programme on national TV. Tradition is that the family comes together and has dinner. At midnight, people toast with champagne, wish each other a happy new year, fortune and health. People have already decorated the Christmas tree before Christmas and children are waiting for the third \"Goodman of December \u2013 Dedek Mraz.\"\n\n===Spain===\n[[File:Nochevieja puertadelsol 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Madrid]]'s [[Puerta del Sol]] on New Year's Eve, 2005.]]\nSpanish New Year's Eve (''Nochevieja'' or ''Fin de A\u00f1o'') celebrations usually begin with a family dinner, traditionally including [[shrimp]] or [[prawns]], and [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[capon]]. The actual countdown is primarily followed from the clock on top of the [[Royal House of the Post Office]] in [[Puerta del Sol]] Square in [[Madrid]]. It is traditional to eat [[Twelve Grapes]], one on each chime of the clock. This tradition has its origins in 1909 when grape growers in [[Alicante]] thought of it as a way to cut down on the large production surplus they had had that year. Nowadays, the tradition is followed by almost every Spaniard, and the twelve grapes have become synonymous with the New Year. After the clock has finished striking twelve, people greet each other and toast with sparkling wine such as [[Cava (Spanish wine)|cava]], [[champagne (wine)|champagne]] or [[cider]]. The song \"Un a\u00f1o m\u00e1s\" by the Spanish group [[Mecano]], is frequently played. The event is broadcast live on major Spanish networks including [[Antena 3 (Spanish TV channel)|Antena 3]] and [[Radio y Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|RTVE]].\n\nEarlier in the evening at around 20:00, there is a 10k run called [[San Silvestre Vallecana]], which starts on [[Paseo de la Castellana]], next to [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium]], and ends at the [[Campo de F\u00fatbol de Vallecas|Vallecas Stadium]].  Professional runners come to Madrid for this 10k.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nAfter the family dinner and the grapes, many young people attend ''cotillones de nochevieja'' parties (named for the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''cotill\u00f3n'', which refers to party supplies like confetti, party blowers, and party hats) at pubs, clubs, and similar places. Parties usually last until the next morning and range from small, personal celebrations at local bars to huge parties with guests numbering the thousands at hotel convention rooms. Early the next morning, party attendees usually gather to have the traditional winter breakfast of hot chocolate and fried pastry (''chocolate con [[churro]]s'').\n\n===Sweden===\n[[File:New Years Eve 2008-2009 -1.jpg|thumb|[[Gothenburg]] fireworks on New Year's Eve, 2008.]]\nIn [[Sweden]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with families or with friends. A few hours before and after midnight, people usually party and eat a special dinner, often three courses. New Year's Eve is celebrated with large fireworks displays throughout the country, especially in the cities. People over the age of 18 are allowed to buy fireworks, which are sold by local stores or by private people. While watching or lighting fireworks at midnight, people usually drink champagne.\n\nThe Swedish lottery television show ''[[BingoLotto]]'' features a special New Year's Eve edition to commemorate the holiday with musical guests, four bingo games, and surprises.\n\n===Switzerland===\nIn [[Switzerland]], New Year's Eve is typically celebrated in private gatherings or public events.\n\nThe final of the [[Spengler Cup]] ice hockey tournament is traditionally held on New Year's Eve.\n\n===Turkey===\n[[File:Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Y\u0131lba\u015f\u0131.jpg|thumb|New Year's Eve decorations in [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]], Istanbul.]]\n[[File:Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131 2010-11 Y\u0131lba\u015f\u0131 S\u00fcslemeleri.jpg|thumb|New Year's Eve decorations in [[Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131]], [[\u0130stanbul]].]]\nNumerous decorations and customs traditionally associated with Christmas and [[Bayram (Turkey)|Bayrams]] are part of [[secular]] New Year's Eve celebrations in [[Turkey]]. Homes and streets are lit in glittering lights. Small gifts are exchanged, and large family dinners are organized with family and friends, featuring a special [[Stuffed turkey|turkey]] dish stuffed with a [[zante currant]], [[pine nuts]], [[pimiento]] and [[dill]] ''[[pilaf|i\u00e7 pilav]]'', [[dolma]], hot [[b\u00f6rek]], [[baklava]], and various other [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish dishes]], accompanied with [[rak\u0131]], [[Turkish wine]], or [[boza]], [[Sharbat|\u015ferbet]], [[salep]], and [[Turkish tea]] or [[Turkish coffee|coffee]]. Even though Turkish people generally do not celebrate [[Christmas]], decorating Christmas trees is a very popular tradition on New Year's Eve in Turkey, and the Turks associate [[Santa Claus]] with New Year's Eve.\n\nTelevision and radio channels are known to continuously broadcast a variety of special New Year's Eve programs, while [[Municipality|municipalities]] all around the country organize fundraising events for the poor, in addition to celebratory public shows such as concerts and family-friendly events, as well as more traditional forms of entertainment such as the [[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat]] [[shadow theatre|shadow-theater]], and even performances by the [[Mehter]]\u2014the [[Janissary]] Band that was founded during the days of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nPublic and private parties with large public attendances are organised in a number of cities and towns, particularly in the largest metropolitan areas such as [[Istanbul]], [[Ankara]], [[Izmir]], [[Adana]], [[Bursa]] and [[Antalya]], with the biggest celebrations taking place in Istanbul's [[Taksim Square|Taksim]], [[Beyo\u011flu]], [[Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131]] and [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]] districts and Ankara's [[K\u0131z\u0131lay Square]], which generally feature dancing, concerts, laser and light shows as well as the traditional countdown and fireworks display.\n\n===Ukraine===\n[[File:Christmas tree in Kyiv, 2019-2020.jpg|thumb|New Year celebration in [[Kiev]]]]\nIn the countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union, New Year's has the same cultural significance as Christmas has in the United States, but without the religious connotations. Ukrainian families traditionally install spruce trees at home, the equivalent of a Christmas tree. Families gather to eat a large feast and reflect on the past year. They have a large celebration, make toasts, and make wishes for a happy New Year. Families give presents to their friends as well as informal acquaintances. As Ukrainians are traditionally a closely-knit community, it is seen as a taboo to not give presents to those the family associates with. Children stay up until midnight, waiting for the New Year. During these celebrations, many Ukrainians tune to special New Year shows, which have become a long-standing tradition for Ukrainian TV. And just before midnight the [[President of Ukraine]] gives his New Year's message to the nation, and when the clock strikes 12, the National Anthem [[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina]] is played in all TV and radio stations as well as in Independence Square in Kiev and other cities where holiday celebrations are held.\n\nThe first New year dish in Ukraine which associates with the New year for every Ukrainian person is the Olivier salad. It has become the main \u00abcharacter\u00bb of many jokes and anecdotes. There are several versions about where the name Olivier comes from, but most people say that it appeared thanks to the French chef Olivier, who lived in the USSR in the 1960s and was the owner of a French restaurant in Moscow. He was the first one to cook this dish. Nowadays this salad is also called Russian, potato and meat salad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diolli.com/new-year-dishes-in-ukraine/|title=New year dish - Ukrainian food - Diolli.com|date=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nNew Year is often considered a \"pre-celebration\" for Greek Catholics and Eastern Orthodox living in Eastern Europe, primarily in Ukraine, since Christmas is celebrated on 7 January.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n====England====\n{{Main|New Year's Eve in London}}\n[[File:LondonTrafSQNYE.jpg|thumb|right|Thousands of people gather in [[central London]] for New Year celebrations, including fireworks at the [[London Eye]] at midnight]]\nThe most prominent New Year's Eve (Old Year's Night) celebration in England is that of [[Central London]], where the arrival of midnight is greeted with the chimes of [[Big Ben]].

The celebration is focused on a major street party along [[Princes Street]]. The cannon is fired at [[Edinburgh Castle]] at the stroke of midnight, followed by a large fireworks display. Edinburgh hosts a festival of four or five days, beginning on 28 December, and lasting until New Year's Day or 2 January, which is also a [[bank holiday]] in Scotland.\n\nOther cities across Scotland, such as [[Aberdeen]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Stirling]] have large organised celebrations too, including fireworks at midnight.\n\n[[BBC Scotland]] [[Hogmanay Live|broadcast the celebrations]] in Edinburgh to a Scottish audience, with the celebrations also screened across the world.

The race celebrates the life and achievements of Welsh runner [[Guto Nyth Br\u00e2n]].\n\nFounded in 1958 by local runner Bernard Baldwin, it is run over the 5-kilometre route of Guto's first competitive race. The main race starts with a church service at [[Llanwynno]], and then a wreath is laid on Guto's grave in [[Llanwynno]] graveyard. After lighting a torch, it is carried to the nearby town of Mountain Ash, where the main race takes place.\n\nThe race consists of a double circuit of the town centre, starting in Henry Street and ending in Oxford Street, by the commemorative statue of Guto. Traditionally, the race was timed to end at midnight, but in recent times it was rescheduled for the convenience of family entertainment, now concluding at around 9 pm.\n\nThis has resulted in a growth in size and scale, and the proceedings now start with an afternoon of street entertainment, and fun run races for children, concluding with the church service, elite runners' race, and presentations.\n\n==Middle East==\n===Israel===\nNew Year's Eve (''Sylvester'') in [[Israel]], is celebrated by parties, social get togethers, concerts, and dining out in major cities such as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Tel Aviv]].

The effigy represents things you disliked from the previous year and are made to look like famous celebrities, politicians, public servants, cartoons, etc. They are burnt right at midnight to shed the old year and represent a new beginning.

However a vigil Mass may be held on the evening before a Holy Day; thus it has become customary to celebrate Mass on the evening of New Year's Eve. (New Year's Eve is a [[Silvester|feast day]] honoring [[Pope Sylvester I]] in the Roman Catholic calendar, but it is not widely recognized in the United States.){{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nMany Christian congregations have New Year's Eve [[watchnight service]]s. Some, especially [[Lutheran]]s and [[Methodist]]s and those in the [[Black church|African American community]], have a tradition known as \"Watch Night\", in which the faithful congregate in services continuing past midnight, giving thanks for the blessings of the outgoing year and praying for divine favor during the upcoming year. In the English-speaking world, Watch Night can be traced back to [[John Wesley]], the founder of Methodism,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interpretermagazine.org/interior.asp?ptid=43&mid=11612|title=Watch Night services provide spiritual way to bring in New Year|publisher=The United Methodist Church Interpreter Magazine|date=November\u2013December 2006|last=Butler|first=Joey|accessdate=10 January 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301064835/http://www.interpretermagazine.org/interior.asp?ptid=43&mid=11612|archivedate=1 March 2012}}</ref> who learned the custom from the [[Moravian Brethren]] who came to England in the 1730s.

In [[Caracas]], the bells of the Cathedral of Caracas ring twelve times.<ref name=\":0\" /> During these special programs, is a tradition to broadcast songs about the end of the year. It is a non-working holiday. Popular songs include \"Viejo a\u00f1o\" (\"Old year\"), by [[Gaita Zuliana|Gaita]] group [[Maracaibo 15]], and \"Cinco pa' las 12\" (\"Five minutes before twelve\"), which was versioned by several popular singers including Nestor Zavarce, Nancy Ramos and [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez El Puma]]. The unofficial hymn for the first minutes of the New Year is \"A\u00f1o Nuevo, Vida Nueva\" (\"New Year, New Life\"), by the band Billo's Caracas Boys. Many people play the national anthem in their houses.\n\nTraditions include wearing yellow underwear, eating [[Pan de jam\u00f3n]], and 12 grapes with sparkling wine.\n\nSpecial holiday programs are broadcast on Venezuelan television stations including [[Venevision]].\n\n==Asia==\n===Bangladesh===\nThe New Year celebrations take place in all around the country mostly in [[Dhaka]], [[Chittagong]], [[Sylhet]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Khulna]], [[Barishal]], [[Cox's Bazar]] etc. The celebrations mostly take place at night. On this day, people go to the parties at club or hotels, beaches, at the crowdy roadsides and bridges where firecrackers are blast out in the sky at night. The roadsides and bridges are also lighted up by colourful lights at night. People do a get-together as well as enjoy with their families. That day, [[Cox's Bazar]] becomes a popular tourist destination for both [[Bangladeshi]] and foreign tourists.\n\nMusic, songs and dances are organized in the auditoriums, hotels, beaches and as well as in the grounds which are shown live concert on [[television|T.V]] where many [[Cinema of Bangladesh|Dhallywood]] celebrities along with many personalities participate in the dance, music, songs and often drama to liven up the concert more.

The [[Christians]] go to the churches for a watch night service till midnight, praying for blessing in the coming new year as it is also part of the [[Christmastide]] season observances.\n\n===China===\nIn [[China]], although the celebrations of the [[Chinese New Year|Lunar New Year]] are not until a few weeks after the Gregorian New Year, celebrations of the Gregorian New Year are held in some areas, particularly in major cities. For example, celebrations with fireworks and rock concerts have taken place in [[Beijing]]'s Solana Blue Harbor Shopping Park, while cultural shows and other events are held at the city's Millennium Monument, [[Temple of Heaven]], [[Great Wall of China]], [[Olympic Green]], and the [[Summer Palace]]. Since 2011, a light and sound show has been held at [[The Bund (Shanghai)|The Bund]] in [[Shanghai]], a few minutes before midnight.\n\n====Hong Kong====\n[[File:HK NYE.jpg|thumb|Fireworks display in [[Hong Kong]].]]\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], many gather in shopping districts like [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], [[Causeway Bay]] and [[Tsim Sha Tsui]]. Beginning in 2008, a 60-second numerical countdown to New Year's, consisting of [[LED]] lights and pyrotechnic display effects, on the facade of [[Two International Finance Centre]] was launched, followed by a fireworks display, alongside an exhibition of the [[A Symphony of Lights|Symphony of Lights]]. For the arrival of 2013, the [[Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre]] initiated the countdown, while the fireworks display and A Symphony of Lights show were extended to eight minutes.\n\nShopping malls are often major celebration venues. The [[Times Square (Hong Kong)|Times Square]] shopping mall, for instance, holds their own celebration of the ball drop held at [[Times Square]], [[New York City]]. There are also various district-wide celebrations.\n\n===Central Asia===\nIn [[Central Asia]], New Year's Eve celebrations were inherited from Soviet traditions; thus they are similar to those of Russia. An example of such traditions would be the playing of the national anthem at midnight and the presidential address before it.\n\n===India===\nIn India as a land of diverse cultures and practices, apart from the Gregorian new year, there is Parsi New Year, Hindu New Year(which might differ from region to region), Muslim New Year, etc. Celebration for culture-specific new years is different from the celebrations of the Gregorian new year. Gregorian new year celebration is mostly by way of parties late night and a working holiday followed by it. Most celebrations for December 31 take place in the major metropolitan cities like [[Kochi]], [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Bangalore]], [[Pune]], [[Ahmedabad]]. New Year is also celebrated in other cities and towns around the country like [[Agra]], [[Bhubaneswar]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Cuttack]], [[Vadodara]], etc., There are lots of shows, events, awards and parties organized all over India. Big and small celebrities and personalities perform as well as enjoy in these parties. Many Discos and Pubs organize big singers, DJs or local talent to liven up the night with their music and songs. [[Goa]] and [[Kerala]] are the most visited destination during [https://in.bookmyshow.com/activities/new-year-parties New Year's celebration] both by Indian and foreign tourists.\n\nMajor events like live concerts and dances by [[Bollywood]] stars are also organized and attended mostly by youngsters. More often people like to celebrate New Year Eve with their family. Hotels and resorts are also decked up in anticipation of tourist arrival and intense competition makes them entice the tourists with exciting New Year offers. Many people across the country also follow old traditions. The[[Christians|Christian]] community often go to church for a watch night service till midnight praying for blessing in the coming new year.\n\n===Indonesia===\nNew Year's Eve celebrations in [[Medan]] ([[Capital city|capital]] of [[North Sumatra]]), included the [[:id:Dunia Terbalik|Dunia Terbalik New Year Countdown Celebrations fireworks]] which was part of the event called \"[[Pelita Harapan University|Medan Pelita Harapan University]] Down Eve Countdown.\" The event, which celebrated the arrival of 2018, attracted 400,000 spectators along both sides of the [[CIMB Niaga]]. The [[countdown]] was televised live in [[Indonesia]] via [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] [[high-definition television|high-definition]] on [[satellite television|satellite transmission]], and aired on [[RCTI|RCTI HD]]'s [[:id:Dunia Terbalik|Dunia Terbalik]] and was sponsored by [[Charoen Pokphand Foods|Fiesta Black Tea]]. It included various national performances such as the \"Dunia Terbalik All Star\" performance, which reached more than 1.9 million viewers. Over 200 local and overseas media organizations covered the spectacular that generated a publicity value of more than [[Indonesian rupiah|RP]]1000 million.\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main|\u014cmisoka}}\n[[File:Tokyo Tower in New Year's Eve 2012.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Tokyo Tower on New Year's Eve, 2012]]\nIn [[Japan]], New Year's Eve is used to prepare for and welcome ''Toshigami'' (\u5e74\u795e), the New Year's god. People clean their home and prepare [[Kadomatsu]] or [[Shimenawa]] to welcome the god before New Year's Eve. Buddhist temples ring their bells 108 times<ref name=telegraph/> at midnight in the traditional ''Joya no Kane'' (\u9664\u591c\u306e\u9418). The rings represent the 108 elements of ''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|bon\u014d]]'' (\u7169\u60a9), mental states that lead people to take unwholesome actions.\n\nIn most cities and urban areas across Japan, New Year's Eve celebrations are usually accompanied by concerts, countdowns, fireworks and other events. In [[Tokyo]], the two most crowded celebrations are held at the Shibuya crossing in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] and the [[Z\u014dj\u014d-ji|Zojoji Temple]] in [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]]. People gather around the Zojoji Temple to release helium balloons with New Year's wishes up in the sky and watch the lighting of [[Tokyo Tower]] and [[Tokyo Skytree]] with a year number displayed on the observatory at the stroke of midnight.\n\nThree notable music-oriented television specials air near New Year's Eve. Since 1951, [[NHK]] has traditionally broadcast ''{{nihongo|[[K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen]]|\u7d05\u767d\u6b4c\u5408\u6226}}'' (''Red/White Singing Battle'') on New Year's Eve, a music competition where two teams of popular musicians (the red and white teams, which predominantly contain female and male performers respectively) perform songs, with the winning team determined by a panel of judges and televotes. The special is traditionally one of the most-watched television programs of the year in Japan. Although it did air on 31 December from 1959 to 2006, the [[Japan Record Award]]s ceremony, recognizing outstanding achievements in the [[Music of Japan|Japanese music industry]], is held annually on 30 December since 2007 and is broadcast by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]. Since 1996, [[Fuji Television]] has broadcast ''Johnny's Countdown''\u2014a live concert at the [[Tokyo Dome]] organized by the talent agency [[Johnny & Associates]].\n\n===Korea===\nThere are two New Years celebrated in both [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]], which are Lunar New Year and Solar New Year. The Solar New Year are always celebrated on the first day of January while Lunar New Year varies. Sometimes there are some traits that both North and South Korea celebrate, while some traits are celebrated differently or only on one side.\n\nIn both Koreas, they call New Year's Day \uc124\ub0a0 (Seoll-Nal). They eat a special soup called \ub5a1\uad6d (Tteok-Guk) which is a hot soup with thin, flat rice cakes and most of the times, eggs are inserted. The Koreans believe that one would get to earn one age if the soup is eaten New Year's Day. They say if one dares to not eat the soup on New Year's Day, then he or she will lose luck.\n\nMost cities and urban areas in both Koreas host New Year's Eve gatherings. In South Korea, two of the biggest celebrations take place in [[Seoul]]: the ringing of [[Bosingak]] bell 33 times at midnight and fireworks display at [[Myeong-dong]], and an LED laser light show and fireworks display at the [[Lotte World Tower]] in [[Songpa District|Songpa-gu]]. In [[Pyongyang]], North Korea, the chimes of the clock at the Grand People's Study House and the national fireworks display along [[Kim Il-sung Square]], [[Juche Tower]] and the surrounding areas signal the start of the New Year. The celebration in Pyongyang, however, also marks the beginning of the [[North Korean calendar]] or the Juche Year, which is based on 15 April 1912, [[Kim Il-sung]]'s date of birth, the celebrations are more recent in origin with the fireworks displays dating from 2013.\n\nFor 2018-2019, Kim Il-sung Square held its first large-scale public celebration, which featured a concert performance by the state [[Moranbong Band]], midnight fireworks, and a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] light show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nknews.org/2018/12/north-korea-rings-in-new-year-with-midnight-concert-drone-show/|title=North Korea rings in new year with midnight concert, drone show|date=1 January 2019|website=NK News|language=en-US|access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Malaysia===\n[[File:2018 New Year Fireworks in George Town, Penang.jpg|left|thumb|Fireworks in [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Penang]] on 1 January 2018]]\n[[File:MALAM TAHUN BARU (5309956791).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Fireworks in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia]]\n''Ambang Tahun Baru'', a celebration sponsored by the government was held at [[Dataran Merdeka|Merdeka Square]], the field opposite the [[Sultan Abdul Samad Building]] in the [[Malaysia]]n capital of [[Kuala Lumpur]] in the early days.

As a modern tradition, New Year's Eve as well as New Year's Day are public holidays, and are two of the biggest holidays of the year. They celebrate New Year's Eve with their family. It is common, just like in the former Soviet Union, that the [[National Anthem of Mongolia]] is to be played at the midnight hour on television.\n\n===Pakistan===\nNew Year's Eve is usually celebrated with fireworks in big cities (e.g. [[Lahore]], [[Karachi]] and [[Islamabad]]). Musical nights and concerts are also held.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nMany Pakistani youngsters enjoy the type of celebrations held the world over. The elite and educated classes participate in night-long activities in urban and cosmopolitan cities like Karachi, Lahore, and the capital of Islamabad.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Philippines===\nIn the [[Philippines]], New Year's Eve (''Bisperas ng Bagong Taon'') is a special non-working holiday. [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] usually celebrate New Year's Eve in the company of family or close friends. Traditionally, most households would visit the churches and attend year-end service and afterwards, would host or attend a midnight feast called the ''Media Noche''. Typical dishes included holiday fare, ''[[pancit]]'' (for long life) and ''[[Jam\u00f3n|Ham\u00f3n]]''. ''[[Lechon]]'' (roasted pig), is usually prepared, as is barbecued food. Some refrain from serving chicken, as their scratching and pecking for food is unlucky, being an idiom for a hand-to-mouth existence.\n\nMany opt to wear new, bright, or colourful clothes with circular patterns, such as [[polka dot]]s, or display sweets and twelve round fruits as the centrepiece, in the belief that circles attract money and fortune and that candies represent a sweeter year ahead. Several customs must only be done at midnight: some throw about coins to increase wealth in the coming year, or jump to increase their height, while some follow the [[Spanish influence on Filipino culture|Spanish custom]] of eating twelve grapes, one for each month of the year. People also make loud noises by blowing on cardboard or plastic horns, called ''torotot'', banging on pots and pans, playing loud music, blowing car horns, or by igniting firecrackers, in the belief that the din scares away bad luck and evil spirits. [[Bamboo cannon]]s are also fired on the night in some places.\n\nUrban areas usually host many New Year's Eve parties and countdown celebrations hosted by the private sector with the help of the local government. These parties, which include balls hosted by hotels, usually display their own fireworks and are often very well-attended. Within Metro Manila, popular locations for celebrations include the area along [[Manila Bay]] at [[Roxas Boulevard]] or [[Luneta Park]] in [[Manila]], the intersection of Ayala and Makati Avenues in [[Makati City]], [[Resorts World Manila]] and [[SM Mall of Asia]] in [[Pasay City]], [[Quezon Memorial Circle]] in Diliman and [[Eastwood City]] in Libis, [[Quezon City]], [[Bonifacio Global City]] in [[Taguig City]], [[Entertainment City]] in [[Para\u00f1aque|Para\u00f1aque City]], and the [[Philippine Arena]] at [[Ciudad de Victoria]] in [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue]] and [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]], [[Bulacan]].

In most cities and urban areas across [[Thailand]], New Year's Eve celebrations are accompanied by countdowns, fireworks, concerts and other major events, notably, the CentralWorld Square at [[CentralWorld]] and the area along [[Chao Phraya River]] at [[ICONSIAM]] and [[Asiatique]] in [[Bangkok]], and the Pattaya Beach in [[Pattaya]], while public places such as hotels, pubs, restaurants and nightclubs, also host New Year's Eve parties by offering food, entertainment and music to the guests, and they usually stay open until the next morning.\n{{-}}\n\n==Europe==\n===Albania===\nPreparations for New Year's Eve in [[Albania]] start with the Christmas tree, which in Albania is known as \"New Year's Tree\" or \"New Year's Pine\".  At midnight, everyone toasts and greets each other and fireworks are lit.\n\n===Austria===\nIn [[Austria]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with friends and family. At exactly midnight, all radio and television programmes operated by [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] broadcast the sound of the [[Pummerin]], the bell of [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]] in [[Vienna]], followed by the ''Donauwalzer'' (\"[[The Blue Danube]]\") by [[Johann Strauss II]]. Many people dance to this at parties or in the street. Large crowds gather in the streets of Vienna, where the municipal government organises a series of stages where bands and orchestras play. Fireworks are set off by both municipal governments and individuals.\n\n===Belgium===\nIn [[Belgium]], New Year's Eve (''Sint Sylvester Vooravond'' (\"Saint Sylvester's Eve\") or ''Oudjaar'' (\"old year\")) is celebrated with family parties, called ''r\u00e9veillons'' in the [[Wallonia|French speaking areas]]. On television, a stand-up comedian reviews the past year after which a musical or variety show signals midnight, when everyone kisses, exchanges good luck greetings, and toasts the New Year and absent relatives and friends with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]. Many people light fireworks or go into the street to watch them. Most cities have their own fireworks display: the most famous is at [[Mont des Arts]] in Brussels. Cities, caf\u00e9s and restaurants are crowded. Free bus services and special New Year's Eve taxis (the ''Responsible Young Drivers'') bring everyone home afterwards.\n\nOn 1 January (''Nieuwjaarsdag'' in Dutch) children read their \"New Year's letter\" and give holiday greeting cards of decorated paper featuring golden cherubs and angels, colored roses and ribbon-tied garlands to parents and godparents, on decorated paper.\n\nBelgian farmers also wish their animals a happy New Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartanplace.com/newyear/newyrcustom/belgium.html|title=Belgian New Year: Sint Sylvester Vooranvond|author= Christine OKeeffe|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Bosnia and Herzegovina===\nNew Year is widely celebrated in [[Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]].

New Year's Eve is the noisiest day of the year. People generally gather with friends at parties, in pubs, clubs, in the streets, or city squares to eat, drink, and celebrate the new year. Fireworks are a popular tradition; in large cities such as [[Bratislava]], or [[Prague]], the fireworks start before noon and steadily increase until midnight. In the first minutes after midnight, people toast with champagne, wish each other a happy new year, fortune and health, and go outside for the fireworks.\n\nIn both countries all major TV stations air entertainment shows before and after the midnight countdown, which is followed by the National anthem of each country. The Presidents of the republics gave their [[New Year speech]] in the morning \u2013 the new Czech President Milo\u0161 Zeman renewed the tradition of Christmas speeches. In recent years however the Czechoslovak national anthem is played at midnight, in honor of the shared history of both nations.\n\n===Denmark===\n[[File:CopenhagenNYE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|New Year fireworks over [[Copenhagen]]]]\nPeople in [[Denmark]] may go to parties or entertain guests at home.

These are lucky numbers in Estonia; it is believed that for each meal consumed, the person gains the strength of that many men the following year. Meals should not be completely finished\u2014some food should be left for ancestors and spirits who visit the house on New Year's Eve.\n\nTraditional New Year food includes pork with sauerkraut or Estonian sauerkraut (''mulgikapsad''), baked potatoes and swedes with hog's head, and white and blood sausage. Vegetarians can eat potato salad with navy beet{{clarify|date=January 2012}} and p\u00e2t\u00e9. Gingerbread and marzipan are very popular for dessert. Traditional New Year drinks include beer and mead, but mulled wine and champagne have become modern favourites.\n\n===Finland===\nIn [[Finland]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with family or friends. Late supper is served, often featuring wieners, [[Janssons frestelse]], and potato salad. Some municipalities organize fireworks at midnight. Consumer fireworks are also very popular. A Finnish tradition is [[molybdomancy]] \u2013 to tell the fortunes of the New Year by melting \"tin\" (actually lead) in a tiny pan on the stove and throwing it quickly in a bucket of cold water. The resulting blob of metal is analyzed, for example by interpreting shadows it casts by candlelight. These predictions are however never taken seriously.\n\nThe Finnish Broadcasting Company broadcasts the reception of the New Year at [[Helsinki Senate Square]]. Countdown to New Year is with the [[Helsinki Cathedral]] clock. In the afternoon programme, the German comedy sketch ''[[Dinner for One]]'' is shown every year. On the radio, just before midnight, the poem ''Hymyilev\u00e4 Apollo'' (Smiling Apollo) by [[Eino Leino]] is read.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |title=Eino Leino |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305170013/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |archivedate=5 March 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n===France===\n[[File:Eiffel Tower on the New Year Eve at midnight.webm|thumb|(video) Celebrations in 2014]]\nIn [[France]], New Year's Eve (''la Saint-Sylvestre'') is usually celebrated with a feast, ''le R\u00e9veillon de la Saint-Sylvestre''<ref>\"[https://www.vibescout.com/fr/post/reveillon-du-nouvel le R\u00e9veillon de la Saint-Sylvestre]\" .Vibescout.com.

Some people eat [[ice cream]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/france/new-year-day|title=New Year's Day in France}}</ref>\n\nThe holiday period ends on 6 January with the celebration of [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] (''Jour des Rois''). A traditional type of flat pastry cake, ''la galette des rois'', made of two sheets of puff pastry, filled with ''frangipane'' (almond paste) is eaten. The cake contains a ''f\u00e8ve'', a small china doll; whomever finds it becomes king or queen and gets to wear a gold paper crown and choose his or her partner. This tradition can last up to two weeks.\n\n===Germany===\nIn [[Germany]], parties are common on New Year's Eve. Fireworks are very popular, both with individuals and at large municipal displays. 31 December and the three days leading up to it are the only four days of the year on which fireworks may be sold in Germany. Every year [[Berlin]] hosts one of the largest New Year's Eve celebrations in all of Europe, attended by over a million people. The focal point is the [[Brandenburg Gate]], where midnight fireworks are centered. Germans toast the New Year with a glass of [[Sparkling wine#Sekt|Sekt]] (German sparkling wine) or champagne.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Molybdomancy]] {{lang|de|(Bleigie\u00dfen)}} is another German New Year's Eve tradition, which involves telling fortunes by the shapes made by molten lead dropped into cold water. Other auspicious actions are to touch a chimney sweep or rub some ash on your forehead for good luck and health. [[Berliner (doughnut)|Jam-filled doughnuts]] with or without alcoholic fillings are eaten. Finally a tiny [[marzipan pig]] is consumed for more good luck.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In some northern regions of Germany (e.g. [[East Frisia]]) the making of ''{{ill|Speckendicken|de}}'' (also {{lang|de|Speckdicken}}) is another tradition \u2013 people go door to door visiting their neighbors and partaking in this dish.

The version traditionally broadcast on German television was originally recorded in 1963, and was occasionally used as filler programming by [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] due to popular demand; in 1972, ''Dinner for One'' received its traditional New Year's Eve scheduling. The sketch, as well as its catchphrase \"the same procedure as every year\", are well known in German pop culture. ''Dinner for One'' is also broadcast on or around New Year's Eve in other European countries, although it is, ironically, relatively unknown in the United Kingdom.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/12/30/bvdinner30.xml | title = Gesundheit to an old favourite | author = Peake, Mike | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= 30 December 2006 | accessdate = 1 January 2007 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=\"slate-dinnerforone\">{{cite web|title=The Mystery of Dinner for One|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2005/12/the_mystery_of_dinner_for_one.html|website=Slate|accessdate=18 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Greece===\nA midnight fireworks display is held over the historic [[Parthenon]] temple in the capital of [[Athens]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-38477734|title=World celebrations ring in new year|work=BBC News|date=2017-01-01|access-date=2020-01-07|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nA common tradition among [[Greek Orthodox]] families is the cutting of a [[vasilopita]] (\"King's pie\" or \"St. Basil's pie\") at midnight.

An ancient tradition in southern regions which is rarely followed today was disposing of old or unused items by dropping them from the window.\n\nDinner is traditionally eaten with relatives and friends. It often includes [[zampone]] or [[cotechino]] (a meal made with [[pig's trotters]] or entrails), and lentils. At 20:30, the President reads a television message of greetings to Italians.\n\nAt midnight, fireworks are displayed all across the country. Rarely followed today is the tradition that consist in eating [[lentil]] stew when bell tolls midnight, one spoonful per bell. This is supposed to bring good fortune; the round lentils represent coins.\n\n===Malta===\n[[Malta]] organized its first New Year's street party in 2009 in [[Floriana]].

While Christmas Eve is a family celebration, New Year's Eve is an opportunity to celebrate with friends.\n\nTraditionally, there is first a feast, commonly consisting of stuffed, roast turkey with potatoes, sprouts, gravy and [[Waldorf salad]]. The accompanying beverage is traditionally beer (commonly either Christmas beer or lager beer). Dessert will often be vanilla pudding or rice cream, and there will be cakes and coffee later in the evening \u2013 commonly accompanied by a glass of cognac. Then, at close to 12 am on New Year's Day, people will go outside to send up fireworks. Fireworks are only permitted to be sold to the general public on the days leading up to New Year's Eve, and only to be launched that night.\n\nDue to the general use of fireworks, more fires occur on New Year's Eve than on any other day of the year in Norway. Accordingly, most Norwegian cities, and many towns, host a large, public fireworks display in order to discourage private use of fireworks in built-up areas. People will then congregate in a central square or similar to watch and celebrate.\n\n===Poland===\nIn [[Poland]] New Year's Eve (''Sylwester'') celebrations include both indoor and outdoor festivities. A large open-air concert is held in the [[Main Market Square, Krak\u00f3w|Main Square]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. 150,000 to 200,000 revelers celebrate the New Year with live music and a fireworks display over [[St. Mary's Basilica, Krak\u00f3w|St. Mary's Basilica]].<ref name=\"onet\">{{cite web|last=\u015awierczek|first=Marcin|title=Tylko w Onet.tv \u2013 sylwester z krakowskiego Rynku na \u017cywo!|publisher=[[Onet.tv]] from Polish Press Agency|location=[[Krak\u00f3w]]|year=2008|url=http://muzyka.onet.pl/10172,1888447,newsy.html|accessdate=31 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117013012/http://muzyka.onet.pl/10172,1888447,newsy.html|archivedate=17 January 2009}}</ref> Similar festivities are held in other cities around Poland.\n\nFor those who do not wish to spend the New Year in the city, the mountains are a popular destination.

The tradition is to drink champagne and eat twelve raisins \u2013 one for each month of the year, making a wish for each. Another Portuguese tradition is a special cake called ''[[Bolo-Rei]]'' (literally: King Cake). ''Bolo-Rei'' is a round cake with a large hole in the centre, resembling a crown covered with crystallised and dried fruit. It is baked from a soft, white dough, with raisins, various nuts and crystallised fruit. Inside is hidden the characteristic ''fava'' ([[broad bean]]). Tradition dictates that whoever finds the ''fava'' has to pay for the ''Bolo-Rei'' next year. Initially, a small prize (usually a small metal toy) was also included within the cake. However, the inclusion of the prize was forbidden by the European Union for safety reasons. The Portuguese brought the recipe of the ''[[Gateau des Rois]]'' from France in the second half of the 19th century. To this day, this recipe is a very well kept secret.\n\nIn [[Lisbon]] the New Year is celebrated with a grand concert. The New Year's Concert is held at the CCB ([[Centro Cultural de Bel\u00e9m]]) on the evening of 1 January, featuring the prestigious Lisbon Metropolitan Orchestra.\n\n===Romania===\n[[File:Vanghelion.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Romexpo]] indoors during ''Vanghelion'' New Year's Eve party.]]\nTraditional celebrations of New Year's Eve (''Revelion'') are the norm in [[Romania]]. Romanians follow centuries-old customs, rituals, and conventions. Children sing \"[[Plugu\u0219orul]]\" and \"Sorcova\", traditional carols that wish goodwill, happiness and success.\n\nParties are common in the evening.

The practices date back to the early 20th century: due to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]'s stance of [[state atheism]] and a larger series of [[Soviet anti-religious legislation|anti-religious policies]], the celebration of Christmas and other religious holidays was widely discouraged. In particular, [[Christmas tree]]s were singled out for originating from [[World War I]] enemy [[Germany]], and being a symbol of the [[bourgeoisie]]. In 1935, Soviet politician [[Pavel Postyshev]] and other high-ranking officials began to promote the concept of New Year trees as a wide, secular tradition\u2014representing happiness and prosperity among youth. Even with the reinstatement of religious holidays after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Novy God has remained a popular celebration in modern Russia.<ref name=\"Father Frost and the Snow Maiden deliver Russia's winter warmer, by Helen Womack, 31 December 1996\">{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/father-frost-and-the-snow-maiden-deliver-russias-winter-warmer-1316564.html| title=Father Frost and the Snow Maiden deliver Russia's winter warmer, by Helen Womack, 31 December 1996| accessdate=12 December 2010| newspaper=The Independent| location=London| date=31 December 1996}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.calvertjournal.com/articles/show/9424/yolka-russia-new-year-tree-pagan-soviet-christmas|title=Yolka: the story of Russia's 'New Year tree', from pagan origins to Soviet celebrations|website=The Calvert Journal|language=en|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"MIG\">{{cite book|title=Echo of Islam|year=1993|publisher=MIG|quote=In the former Soviet Union, fir trees were usually put up to mark New Year's day, following a tradition established by the officially atheist state.}}</ref><ref name=\"Dice2009\">{{cite book|last=Dice|first=Elizabeth A.|title=Christmas and Hanukkah|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438119717|page=44|quote=The Christmas tree, or Yolka, is another tradition that was banned during the Soviet era.

Indoors, families celebrate New Year's Eve with an abundance of food. Serbs decorate trees, ''Novogodi\u0161nja jelka'', at New Year's Eve, rather than at Christmas Eve. Near, or after midnight, Santa Claus (''Deda Mraz'') visits houses and leaves presents under the tree, to be unpacked then or, if the family is asleep, to be discovered in the morning.\n\nSerbian New Year's celebrations take place in [[Belgrade]], and several other major cities such as [[Novi Sad]] and [[Ni\u0161]]. As of mid-December, cities are extensively decorated and lit. The decorations remain until way into January due to the influence of the [[Julian calendar]]. Throughout the region, especially amongst former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] republics, Belgrade is the most popular destination for major parties.\n\nOn 13 January, a large part of the population{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} celebrates \"[[Old New Year|Serbian New Year]]\", according to the Julian calendar. Usually, one concert is organized in front of either City Hall or the National Parliament in Belgrade, while fireworks are prepared by the Serbian Orthodox Church and fired from the [[Cathedral of Saint Sava]], where people also gather. Other cities also organize such celebrations.\n\n===Slovenia===\nIn [[Slovenia]], New Year's Eve is known as a Saint Sylvester's Day (Silvestrovo). Streets are decorated for December. In larger cities like [[Ljubljana]], [[Maribor]], [[Celje]] or [[Koper]] there are concerts, culture programmes and countdowns followed by fireworks. There is also a special programme on national TV. Tradition is that the family comes together and has dinner. At midnight, people toast with champagne, wish each other a happy new year, fortune and health. People have already decorated the Christmas tree before Christmas and children are waiting for the third \"Goodman of December \u2013 Dedek Mraz.\"\n\n===Spain===\n[[File:Nochevieja puertadelsol 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Madrid]]'s [[Puerta del Sol]] on New Year's Eve, 2005.]]\nSpanish New Year's Eve (''Nochevieja'' or ''Fin de A\u00f1o'') celebrations usually begin with a family dinner, traditionally including [[shrimp]] or [[prawns]], and [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[capon]]. The actual countdown is primarily followed from the clock on top of the [[Royal House of the Post Office]] in [[Puerta del Sol]] Square in [[Madrid]]. It is traditional to eat [[Twelve Grapes]], one on each chime of the clock. This tradition has its origins in 1909 when grape growers in [[Alicante]] thought of it as a way to cut down on the large production surplus they had had that year. Nowadays, the tradition is followed by almost every Spaniard, and the twelve grapes have become synonymous with the New Year. After the clock has finished striking twelve, people greet each other and toast with sparkling wine such as [[Cava (Spanish wine)|cava]], [[champagne (wine)|champagne]] or [[cider]]. The song \"Un a\u00f1o m\u00e1s\" by the Spanish group [[Mecano]], is frequently played. The event is broadcast live on major Spanish networks including [[Antena 3 (Spanish TV channel)|Antena 3]] and [[Radio y Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|RTVE]].\n\nEarlier in the evening at around 20:00, there is a 10k run called [[San Silvestre Vallecana]], which starts on [[Paseo de la Castellana]], next to [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium]], and ends at the [[Campo de F\u00fatbol de Vallecas|Vallecas Stadium]].  Professional runners come to Madrid for this 10k.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nAfter the family dinner and the grapes, many young people attend ''cotillones de nochevieja'' parties (named for the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''cotill\u00f3n'', which refers to party supplies like confetti, party blowers, and party hats) at pubs, clubs, and similar places. Parties usually last until the next morning and range from small, personal celebrations at local bars to huge parties with guests numbering the thousands at hotel convention rooms. Early the next morning, party attendees usually gather to have the traditional winter breakfast of hot chocolate and fried pastry (''chocolate con [[churro]]s'').\n\n===Sweden===\n[[File:New Years Eve 2008-2009 -1.jpg|thumb|[[Gothenburg]] fireworks on New Year's Eve, 2008.]]\nIn [[Sweden]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with families or with friends. A few hours before and after midnight, people usually party and eat a special dinner, often three courses. New Year's Eve is celebrated with large fireworks displays throughout the country, especially in the cities. People over the age of 18 are allowed to buy fireworks, which are sold by local stores or by private people. While watching or lighting fireworks at midnight, people usually drink champagne.\n\nThe Swedish lottery television show ''[[BingoLotto]]'' features a special New Year's Eve edition to commemorate the holiday with musical guests, four bingo games, and surprises.\n\n===Switzerland===\nIn [[Switzerland]], New Year's Eve is typically celebrated in private gatherings or public events.\n\nThe final of the [[Spengler Cup]] ice hockey tournament is traditionally held on New Year's Eve.\n\n===Turkey===\n[[File:Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Y\u0131lba\u015f\u0131.jpg|thumb|New Year's Eve decorations in [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]], Istanbul.]]\n[[File:Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131 2010-11 Y\u0131lba\u015f\u0131 S\u00fcslemeleri.jpg|thumb|New Year's Eve decorations in [[Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131]], [[\u0130stanbul]].]]\nNumerous decorations and customs traditionally associated with Christmas and [[Bayram (Turkey)|Bayrams]] are part of [[secular]] New Year's Eve celebrations in [[Turkey]]. Homes and streets are lit in glittering lights. Small gifts are exchanged, and large family dinners are organized with family and friends, featuring a special [[Stuffed turkey|turkey]] dish stuffed with a [[zante currant]], [[pine nuts]], [[pimiento]] and [[dill]] ''[[pilaf|i\u00e7 pilav]]'', [[dolma]], hot [[b\u00f6rek]], [[baklava]], and various other [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish dishes]], accompanied with [[rak\u0131]], [[Turkish wine]], or [[boza]], [[Sharbat|\u015ferbet]], [[salep]], and [[Turkish tea]] or [[Turkish coffee|coffee]]. Even though Turkish people generally do not celebrate [[Christmas]], decorating Christmas trees is a very popular tradition on New Year's Eve in Turkey, and the Turks associate [[Santa Claus]] with New Year's Eve.\n\nTelevision and radio channels are known to continuously broadcast a variety of special New Year's Eve programs, while [[Municipality|municipalities]] all around the country organize fundraising events for the poor, in addition to celebratory public shows such as concerts and family-friendly events, as well as more traditional forms of entertainment such as the [[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat]] [[shadow theatre|shadow-theater]], and even performances by the [[Mehter]]\u2014the [[Janissary]] Band that was founded during the days of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nPublic and private parties with large public attendances are organised in a number of cities and towns, particularly in the largest metropolitan areas such as [[Istanbul]], [[Ankara]], [[Izmir]], [[Adana]], [[Bursa]] and [[Antalya]], with the biggest celebrations taking place in Istanbul's [[Taksim Square|Taksim]], [[Beyo\u011flu]], [[Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131]] and [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]] districts and Ankara's [[K\u0131z\u0131lay Square]], which generally feature dancing, concerts, laser and light shows as well as the traditional countdown and fireworks display.\n\n===Ukraine===\n[[File:Christmas tree in Kyiv, 2019-2020.jpg|thumb|New Year celebration in [[Kiev]]]]\nIn the countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union, New Year's has the same cultural significance as Christmas has in the United States, but without the religious connotations. Ukrainian families traditionally install spruce trees at home, the equivalent of a Christmas tree. Families gather to eat a large feast and reflect on the past year. They have a large celebration, make toasts, and make wishes for a happy New Year. Families give presents to their friends as well as informal acquaintances. As Ukrainians are traditionally a closely-knit community, it is seen as a taboo to not give presents to those the family associates with. Children stay up until midnight, waiting for the New Year. During these celebrations, many Ukrainians tune to special New Year shows, which have become a long-standing tradition for Ukrainian TV. And just before midnight the [[President of Ukraine]] gives his New Year's message to the nation, and when the clock strikes 12, the National Anthem [[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina]] is played in all TV and radio stations as well as in Independence Square in Kiev and other cities where holiday celebrations are held.\n\nThe first New year dish in Ukraine which associates with the New year for every Ukrainian person is the Olivier salad. It has become the main \u00abcharacter\u00bb of many jokes and anecdotes. There are several versions about where the name Olivier comes from, but most people say that it appeared thanks to the French chef Olivier, who lived in the USSR in the 1960s and was the owner of a French restaurant in Moscow. He was the first one to cook this dish. Nowadays this salad is also called Russian, potato and meat salad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diolli.com/new-year-dishes-in-ukraine/|title=New year dish - Ukrainian food - Diolli.com|date=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nNew Year is often considered a \"pre-celebration\" for Greek Catholics and Eastern Orthodox living in Eastern Europe, primarily in Ukraine, since Christmas is celebrated on 7 January.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n====England====\n{{Main|New Year's Eve in London}}\n[[File:LondonTrafSQNYE.jpg|thumb|right|Thousands of people gather in [[central London]] for New Year celebrations, including fireworks at the [[London Eye]] at midnight]]\nThe most prominent New Year's Eve (Old Year's Night) celebration in England is that of [[Central London]], where the arrival of midnight is greeted with the chimes of [[Big Ben]].

The celebration is focused on a major street party along [[Princes Street]]. The cannon is fired at [[Edinburgh Castle]] at the stroke of midnight, followed by a large fireworks display. Edinburgh hosts a festival of four or five days, beginning on 28 December, and lasting until New Year's Day or 2 January, which is also a [[bank holiday]] in Scotland.\n\nOther cities across Scotland, such as [[Aberdeen]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Stirling]] have large organised celebrations too, including fireworks at midnight.\n\n[[BBC Scotland]] [[Hogmanay Live|broadcast the celebrations]] in Edinburgh to a Scottish audience, with the celebrations also screened across the world.

The race celebrates the life and achievements of Welsh runner [[Guto Nyth Br\u00e2n]].\n\nFounded in 1958 by local runner Bernard Baldwin, it is run over the 5-kilometre route of Guto's first competitive race. The main race starts with a church service at [[Llanwynno]], and then a wreath is laid on Guto's grave in [[Llanwynno]] graveyard. After lighting a torch, it is carried to the nearby town of Mountain Ash, where the main race takes place.\n\nThe race consists of a double circuit of the town centre, starting in Henry Street and ending in Oxford Street, by the commemorative statue of Guto. Traditionally, the race was timed to end at midnight, but in recent times it was rescheduled for the convenience of family entertainment, now concluding at around 9 pm.\n\nThis has resulted in a growth in size and scale, and the proceedings now start with an afternoon of street entertainment, and fun run races for children, concluding with the church service, elite runners' race, and presentations.\n\n==Middle East==\n===Israel===\nNew Year's Eve (''Sylvester'') in [[Israel]], is celebrated by parties, social get togethers, concerts, and dining out in major cities such as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Tel Aviv]].

The dinner features traditional dishes such as tabouli, hummus, kibbi, and other Lebanese foods. These celebrations could also take place in restaurants and clubs. Game shows are also organized where people can try to win money. The countdown to New Year's is broadcast through the leading TV channel and the celebrations usually continue until sunrise.

To preserve his dig and advance his suit, Salazar must avoid being murdered by Bergen, bestir the civilized natives to battle the nomads, and manipulate his superior at the museum funding him in order to secretly supply Terran weapons to his allies.\n\n==Setting==\nKukulkan, a planet of the star [[Epsilon Eridani]], is inhabited by intelligent [[dinosaur]]-like creatures possessed of a civilization far older than Earth's. Due to the natives' inherent conservatism and an environment deficient in fossil fuels, its technology has not advanced beyond edged weapons and steam-driven vehicles. The Kukulkanians, or \"Kooks\" as they are known among Terrans, are honest, honor-bound, and dull in personality. Terrans have obtained land for a colony by treaty, and the colonists, consisting primarily of descendants of North American, Russian, and Chinese settlers, co-inhabit the planet in a somewhat uneasy relationship with the natives.\n\nThe cultural level of the aboriginal race places the Kukulkan stories firmly within the [[Sword and Planet]] genre, though the non-humanoid inhabitants are an unusual feature.

First, the ''Viagens Interplanetarias'' is never actually mentioned in the novels. Second, these novels portray America, Russia and China as supplying most of the Terran settlers of Kukulkan, in seeming contradiction to the series' premise that these countries have been eclipsed by Brazil in the ''Viagens'' future; no Brazilians appear in the novels. Third, the name of the planet Kukulkan violates the nomenclature previously established for the planetary system of Epsilon Eridani in the introduction and [[The Continent Makers|title story]] of ''[[The Continent Makers and Other Tales of the Viagens]]'', according to which the planets take their names from [[Norse mythology|Norse]] gods like [[Thor]], not [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n gods like [[Kukulkan]]. The first two issues are explicable. Since the novels' activities take place entirely on-planet and Kukulkan's well-established settlements are not dependent on extra-system support, there is no need for the ''Viagens'' to play a role. The ethnic make-up of the settlements presumably results from the well-known tendency of depressed economies rather than prosperous ones to supply emigrants.

His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' (1957). He began publishing nonfiction as co-author of a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly [[popular science]] books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels, while writing over 120 nonfiction books. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Prelude to Foundation |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1988 |pages=xiii\u2013xv |nopp=true }}</ref> [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Houghton Mifflin]] published about 60% of his work as of 1969, Asimov stating that \"both represent a father image\".{{r|nichols19690803}}\n\nAsimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his \"[[Three Laws of Robotics]]\" and the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]].<ref>''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' p.&nbsp;329</ref> Furthermore, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits his science fiction for introducing into the English language the words \"[[robotics]]\", \"[[positronic brain|positronic]]\" (an entirely fictional technology), and \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" (which is also used for a [[Psychohistory|different study]] on historical motivations).

Asimov notes in his introduction to the short story collection ''[[The Complete Robot]]'' (1982) that he was largely inspired by the almost relentless tendency of robots up to that time to fall consistently into a [[Frankenstein]] plot in which they destroyed their creators.\n\nThe robot series has led to film adaptations. With Asimov's collaboration, in about 1977, [[Harlan Ellison]] wrote a screenplay of ''I, Robot'' that Asimov hoped would lead to \"the first really adult, complex, worthwhile [[science fiction film]] ever made\". The screenplay has never been filmed and was eventually published in book form in 1994.

Chemists, he noted, will read the word \"unionized\" as ''un''-''ion-ized'' (pronounced \"un-EYE-en-ized\"), meaning \"(a chemical species) being in an electrically neutral state, as opposed to being an ion\", while non-chemists will read the word as ''union-ized'' (pronounced \"YOU-nien-ized\"), meaning \"(a worker or organization) belonging to or possessing a trade union\".\n\n=== Coined terms ===\nAsimov coined the term \"[[robotics]]\" in his 1941 story \"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]\",<ref>According to the ''Oxford English Dictionary,'' the term \"robotics\" was first used in the short story \"Liar!\" published in the May 1941 issue of ''Astounding Science Fiction''.</ref> though he later remarked that he believed then that he was merely using an existing word, as he stated in ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' (\"The Robot Chronicles\"). While acknowledging the Oxford Dictionary reference, he incorrectly states that the word was first printed about one-third of the way down the first column of page 100, ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'', March 1942 printing of his short story \"[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Gold |publisher=Voyager <!-- was Eos --> |date=1996 <!-- was 2003 --> |origyear=1995 |location=London |isbn=0-00-648202-3 |pages=224\u2013225 |chapter=The Robot Chronicles}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Counting the Eons |chapter=4 The Word I Invented |publisher=Doubleday |date=1983 |quote=Robotics has become a sufficiently well developed technology to warrant articles and books on its history and I have watched this in amazement, and in some disbelief, because I invented ... the word|title-link=Counting the Eons }}</ref>\n\nIn the same story, Asimov also coined the term \"positronic\" (the counterpart to \"electronic\" for [[positron]]s).<ref>[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/positronic Oxford Dictionary website] entry for \"positronic\"</ref>\n\nAsimov coined the term \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" in his [[Foundation series|''Foundation'']] stories to name a fictional branch of science which combines [[history]], [[sociology]], and [[mathematical statistics]] to make general predictions about the future behavior of very large groups of people, such as the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]]. Asimov said later that he should have called it psychosociology. It was first introduced in the five short stories (1942\u20131944) which would later be collected as the 1951 [[fix-up]] novel ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Psychohistory |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=4\u20138 |publisher=Davis Publications |date=July 1988 |issn=0162-2188}}</ref> Somewhat later, the term \"[[psychohistory]]\" was applied by others to research of the effects of psychology on history.\n\n=== Other writings ===\nIn addition to his interest in science, Asimov was interested in history. Starting in the 1960s, he wrote 14 popular history books, including ''The Greeks: A Great Adventure'' (1965),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Greeks: A Great Adventure |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1965 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Republic'' (1966),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Republic |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1966 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Empire'' (1967),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Empire |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Egyptians'' (1967)<ref>{{cite book |title=The Egyptians |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Near East: 10,000 Years of History'' (1968),\n<ref>{{cite book |title=The Near East: 10,000 Years of History |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1968 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> and ''[[Asimov's Chronology of the World]]'' (1991).<ref>{{cite book |title=Asimov's Chronology of the World |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1991 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nHe published ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'' in two volumes\u2014covering the [[Old Testament]] in 1967 and the [[New Testament]] in 1969\u2014and then combined them into one 1,300-page volume in 1981. Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters. His interest in literature manifested itself in several annotations of literary works, including ''[[Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare]]'' (1970),{{efn|Asimov, ''In Joy Still Felt'' (1980), pp. 464\u2013465: \"Of all the books I have ever worked on, I think ''Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare'' gave me the most pleasure, day in, day out. For months and months I lived and thought Shakespeare, and I don't see how there can be any greater pleasure in the world\u2014any pleasure, that is, that one can indulge in for as much as ten hours without pause, day after day indefinitely.\"}} ''Asimov's Annotated Paradise Lost'' (1974), and ''The Annotated Gulliver's Travels'' (1980).<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' chapter 112</ref>\n\nAsimov was also a noted mystery author and a frequent contributor to ''Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine''. He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing \"pure\" mysteries. He published two full-length mystery novels, and wrote 66 stories about the [[Black Widowers]], a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle. He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, who he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Puzzles of the Black Widowers |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1991 |pages=xiii |nopp=true }}</ref>\n\nToward the end of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], mostly written by himself, starting with ''[[Lecherous Limericks]]'', which appeared in 1975. ''Limericks: Too Gross'', whose title displays Asimov's love of [[pun]]s, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by [[John Ciardi]]. He even created a slim volume of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlockian]] limericks. Asimov featured [[Yiddish]] humor in ''[[Azazel (Asimov)|Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon]]''. The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of \"George\" and his friend Azazel. Asimov's ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on [[Theory of humor|humor theory]]. According to Asimov, the most essential element of humor is an abrupt change in point of view, one that suddenly shifts focus from the important to the trivial, or from the sublime to the ridiculous.<ref name=\"Asimov 1971\">{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1971 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=New York |isbn=0-395-12665-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Asimov 1992\">{{cite book|title=Asimov Laughs Again |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1992 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |isbn=0-06-016826-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/asimovlaughsagai00isaa }}</ref>\n\nParticularly in his later years, Asimov to some extent cultivated an image of himself as an amiable lecher. In 1971, as a response to the popularity of sexual guidebooks such as ''[[The Sensuous Woman]]'' (by \"J\") and ''[[The Sensuous Man]]'' (by \"M\"), Asimov published ''[[The Sensuous Dirty Old Man]]'' under the byline \"Dr. 'A{{'\"}}<ref>''In Joy Still Felt'' p. 569</ref> (although his full name was printed on the paperback edition, first published 1972). However, by 2016, some of Asimov's behavior towards women was described as [[sexual harassment]] and cited as an example of historically problematic behavior by men in science fiction communities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/dont-look-away-fighting-sexual-harassment-in-the-scifi-1785704207|title=Don't Look Away: Fighting Sexual Harassment in the Scifi/Fantasy Community|last=Hines|first=Jim C.|date=August 29, 2016|work=io9|access-date=December 18, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAsimov published [[Autobiographies of Isaac Asimov|three volumes of autobiography]].

In it they offer advice on how to maintain a positive attitude and stay productive when dealing with discouragement, distractions, rejection, and thick-headed editors.

Asimov wrote a critical essay on ''Star Trek''{{'}}s scientific accuracy for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine. Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series. Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to ''TV Guide'' claiming that despite its inaccuracies, ''Star Trek'' was a fresh and intellectually challenging [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] show. The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of ''Star Trek'' projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/getting-star-trek-on-air-was-impossible.html |title=Letters of Note: Getting Star Trek on the air was impossible |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Calendar}}\nIn 1973, Asimov published a proposal for [[calendar reform]], called the World Season Calendar. It divides the year into four seasons (named A\u2013D) of 13 weeks (91 days) each. This allows days to be named, e.g., \"D-73\" instead of December 1 (due to December 1 being the 73rd day of the 4th quarter). An extra 'year day' is added for a total of 365 days.<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |chapter=The Week Excuse |title=The Tragedy of the Moon |pages=48\u201358 |publisher=Doubleday and Co |date=1973 |isbn=0-440-18999-3|title-link=The Tragedy of the Moon }}</ref>\n\n=== Awards and recognition ===\nAsimov won more than a dozen annual awards for particular works of science fiction and a half dozen lifetime awards.<ref name=SFAwards>[http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit5.html#179 \"Asimov, Isaac\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016200502/http://locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit5.html |date=October 16, 2012 }}.

(Asimov only used an [[outline (list)|outline]] once, later describing it as \"like trying to play the piano from inside a straitjacket\".) After correcting the draft by hand, he retyped the document as the final copy and only made one revision with minor editor-requested changes; a [[word processor]] did not save him much time, Asimov said, because 95% of the first draft was unchanged.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\"/><ref name=\"fallows198207\">{{Cite magazine |last=Fallows |first=James |date=July 1982 |title=Living With a Computer |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/07/living-with-a-computer/306063/ |magazine=The Atlantic |language=en-US |access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter disliking making multiple revisions of \"[[Black Friar of the Flame]]\", Asimov refused to make major, second, or non-editorial revisions (\"like chewing used gum\"), stating that \"too large a revision, or too many revisions, indicate that the piece of writing is a failure. In the time it would take to salvage such a failure, I could write a new piece altogether and have infinitely more fun in the process\". He submitted \"failures\" to another editor.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/142/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City, NY |pages=142\u2013145}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most common impressions of Asimov's fiction work is that his writing style is extremely unornamented. In 1980, science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]], professor [[emeritus]] of [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Kansas]] wrote of ''I, Robot'':\n\n{{quote|Except for two stories\u2014\"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]\" and \"[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]\"\u2014they are not stories in which character plays a significant part. Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action. Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind. The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent. ... . The robot stories and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction\u2014play themselves on a relatively bare stage.<ref name=\"IASFM-Gunn\">{{cite magazine |last=Gunn |first=James | author-link = James Gunn (author) |title=On Variations on a Robot |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine |date=July 1980 |pages=56\u201381 }}</ref>}}\n\nAsimov addressed such criticism at the beginning of ''[[Nemesis (Isaac Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'':\n\n{{quote|I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing\u2014to be 'clear'. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics\u2014Well, they can do whatever they wish.<ref name=\"Nemesis-Authour's note\">{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Nemesis |date=October 1989 }}</ref>}}\n\nGunn cited examples of a more complex style, such as the climax of \"Liar!\". Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: [[Susan Calvin]] in \"Liar!\" and \"Evidence\", [[Arkady Darell]] in ''Second Foundation'', Elijah Baley in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', and [[Hari Seldon]] in the ''Foundation'' prequels.\n\nOther than books by Gunn and Joseph Patrouch, a relative dearth of \"literary\" criticism exists on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer's ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' (1981) gives a possible reason:\n\n{{quote|His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional [[literary criticism]] because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening. In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition. Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science Fiction Writers |last=Cowart |first=David |last2=Wymer |first2=Thomas L. |date=1981 |publisher=Gale Research |location=Detroit |pages=15\u201329}}</ref>}}\n\nGunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both state that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn's 1982 book comments in detail on each of Asimov's novels. He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but calls some passages in ''The Caves of Steel'' \"reminiscent of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]\". When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose \"need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn }}</ref>\n\nAlthough he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited [[Clifford D. Simak]] as an early influence{{r|earlyyears79_82}}<ref>''Beyond the Golden Age'' pp. 222\u2013223</ref>), and said in 1973 that his style had not changed,{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated [[narrative structure]]s, often by arranging chapters in non[[Chronology|chronological]] ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the [[Nonlinear (arts)|nonlinearity]] is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of ''The Gods Themselves'' begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book121.html |title=Review of ''The Gods Themselves'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create \"[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]\", one of the early ''Robot'' stories). Patrouch found that the interwoven and nested flashbacks of ''[[The Currents of Space]]'' did serious harm to that novel, to such an extent that only a \"dyed-in-the-[[kyrt]]<ref>Asimov, Isaac (1952), [http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/isaac-asimov/currents-of-space.htm ''The Currents of Space''], explanation of \"kyrt\"</ref> Asimov fan\" could enjoy it. In his later novel ''Nemesis'' one group of characters lives in the \"present\" and another group starts in the \"past\", beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n=== Limitations ===\n==== Sexuality ====\nAsimov attributed the lack of romance and sex in his fiction to the \"early imprinting\" from starting his writing career when he had never been on a date and \"didn't know anything about girls\".{{r|earlyyears25_28}} He was sometimes criticized for the general absence of sex (and of [[extraterrestrial life]]) in his science fiction. He claimed he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' to respond to these criticisms,<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Joy Still Felt |date=1980 |page=567}}</ref> which often came from [[New Wave science fiction]] (and often British) writers. The second part (of three) of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes, and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted.\n\n==== Alien life ====\nAsimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when ''Astounding''{{'}}s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real-world racial bias. Unwilling to write only weak alien races, and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell's friendship, he decided he would not write about aliens at all.<ref name=\"Early Asimov\" /> Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'', which contains aliens and alien sex. The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1972,<ref name=\"WWE\" /> and the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1973.<ref name=\"WWE\" /> Asimov said that of all his writings, he was most proud of the middle section of ''The Gods Themselves'', the part that deals with those themes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=250}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novelette \"[[Gold (Asimov short story)|Gold]]\", Asimov describes an author, clearly based on himself, who has one of his books (''The Gods Themselves'') adapted into a \"compu-drama\", essentially [[photo-realistic]] [[computer animation]]. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov (\"Gregory Laborian\") for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gold |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=HarperPrism |location=New York |isbn=0-06-105206-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 109\u2013138] |url=https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 }}</ref>\n\n==== Portrayal of women ====\nAsimov was criticized for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings, such as ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' (\"Women and Science Fiction\"), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early science-fiction stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. For example, the August 25, 1985 ''Washington Post''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Book World\" section reports of ''Robots and Empire'' as follows:\n\n{{quote|In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are. His robots were tin cans with speedlines like an old [[Studebaker]], and still are; the ''Robot'' tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable [[artificial intelligence]]s, and still do. In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no [[genetic engineering]], aliens, [[arcologies]], [[multiverses]], [[Clone (genetics)|clones]], sin or sex; his heroes (in this case [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], whom we first met as the robot protagonist of ''The Caves of Steel'' and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly.}}\n\nHowever, some of his robot stories, including the earliest ones, featured the character [[Susan Calvin]], a forceful and intelligent woman who regularly out-performed her male colleagues.<ref>Asimov (1983) ''The Complete Robot'', Grafton Books, p. 327</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote|There is a perennial question among readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views of the author.

During his childhood, his father and mother observed [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] traditions, though not as stringently as they had in Petrovichi; they did not, however, force their beliefs upon young Isaac. Thus, he grew up without strong religious influences, coming to believe that the ''[[Torah]]'' represented [[Jewish mythology|Hebrew mythology]] in the same way that the ''[[Iliad]]'' recorded [[Greek mythology]].<ref>{{cite book |title=I. Asimov: A Memoir |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=Bantam |location=New York |isbn=0-553-56997-X |pages=11\u201314}}</ref> When he was 13, he chose not to have a [[bar mitzvah]].<ref>''In Memory Yet Green'', p. 121</ref> As his books ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' and ''Asimov Laughs Again'' record, Asimov was willing to tell jokes involving God, [[Satan]], the [[Garden of Eden]], [[Jerusalem]], and other religious topics, expressing the viewpoint that a good joke can do more to provoke thought than hours of philosophical discussion.<ref name=\"Asimov 1971\"/><ref name=\"Asimov 1992\"/>\n\nFor a brief while, his father worked in the local synagogue to enjoy the familiar surroundings and, as Isaac put it, \"shine as a learned scholar\"<ref>Asimov, Isaac. ''In Memory Yet Green: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1920\u20131954''. Doubleday, 1979.</ref> versed in the sacred writings. This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'', an analysis of the historic foundations for both the Old and New Testaments. For many years, Asimov called himself an [[atheism|atheist]]; however, he considered the term somewhat inadequate, as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did. Eventually, he described himself as a \"[[Humanism|humanist]]\" and considered that term more practical. He did, however, continue to identify himself as a nonobservant Jew, as stated in his introduction to [[Jack Dann]]'s anthology of Jewish science fiction, ''[[Wandering Stars]]'': \"I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite, the [[bar mitzvah]]. It doesn't matter. I am Jewish.\"<ref>\"I make no secret of the fact that I am a non-observant Jew\", Asimov, Isaac. ''Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine'', Volume 15, Issues 10\u201313. p. 8. Davis Publishing, 1991.</ref>\n\nWhen asked in an interview in 1982 if he was an atheist, Asimov replied,\n\n{{quote|I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have. Somehow it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic. I finally decided that I'm a creature of emotion as well as of reason. Emotionally I am an atheist.

Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment. If an afterlife existed, he claimed, the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who \"slandered God by inventing Hell\".<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

Then too, it is impossible to write science fiction and really ignore religion.<ref>{{cite book |first=Isaac |last=Asimov |title=Gold: The Final Science Fiction Collection |year=1995 |pages=297\u2013302}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Politics ===\nAsimov became a staunch supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] during the [[New Deal]], and thereafter remained a political [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. He was a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and in a television interview during the early 1970s he publicly endorsed [[George McGovern]].<ref>Asimov, I. ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1981) p. 503</ref> He was unhappy about what he considered an \"irrationalist\" viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late 1960s and onwards. In his second volume of autobiography, ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure [[Abbie Hoffman]]. Asimov's impression was that the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s' counterculture]] heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a \"no-man's land of the spirit\" from which he wondered if they would ever return.<ref name=\"joy\">{{cite book|title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954\u20131978 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1980 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City, NY|isbn=0-385-15544-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 574] |url=https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 }}</ref>\n\nAsimov vehemently opposed [[Richard Nixon]], considering him \"a crook and a liar\". He closely followed [[Watergate]], and was pleased when the president was forced to resign. Asimov was dismayed over the pardon extended to Nixon by [[Gerald Ford|his successor]]: \"I was not impressed by the argument that it has spared the nation an ordeal. To my way of thinking, the ordeal was necessary to make certain it would never happen again.\"<ref>Asimov, I. ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Doubleday, 1980) chapter 39</ref>\n\nAfter Asimov's name appeared in the mid-1960s on a list of people the [[Communist Party USA]] \"considered amenable\" to its goals, the [[FBI]] investigated him. Because of his academic background, the bureau briefly considered Asimov as a possible candidate for known Soviet spy ROBPROF, but found nothing suspicious in his life or background.<ref name=\"skelding20131107\">{{cite web |url=https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2013/nov/07/isaac-asimov-fbi-file-ROBPROF/ |title=\"Inimical to the best interests of the United States.\" Isaac Asimov's FBI File |last=Skelding |first=Conor |website=MuckRock |date=November 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThough from a Jewish family, Asimov appeared to hold an equivocal attitude towards [[Israel]]. In his first autobiography, he indicates his support for the safety of Israel, though insisting that he was not a [[Zionist]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |quote=<!--None-->}}</ref> In his third autobiography, Asimov stated his opposition to the creation of a Jewish state, on the grounds that he was opposed to the concept of nation-states in general, and supported the notion of a single humanity. Asimov especially worried about the safety of Israel given that it had been created among hostile neighbors, and said that Jews had merely created for themselves another \"Jewish ghetto\".{{efn|{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=380 |quote=When Israel was founded in 1948 and all my Jewish friends were jubilant, I was the skeleton at the feast.

Actually, I feel that no human group deserves a \"homeland\" in the usual sense of the word. ... I am not a Zionist, then, because I don't believe in nations, and Zionism merely sets up one more nation to trouble the world.}}}}\n\n=== Social issues ===\nAsimov believed that \"''science'' fiction ... serve[s] the good of humanity\".{{r|asimov196708}} He considered himself a feminist even before [[women's liberation]] became a widespread movement; he argued that the issue of [[women's rights]] was closely connected to that of population control.<ref name=\"YIA\" /> Furthermore, he believed that [[homosexuality]] must be considered a \"moral right\" on population grounds, as must all consenting adult sexual activity that does not lead to reproduction.<ref name=\"YIA\" /> He issued many appeals for [[population control]], reflecting a perspective articulated by people from [[Thomas Malthus]] through [[Paul R. Ehrlich]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Moyer's World of Ideas, Part I |url=https://www.pbs.org/moyers/faithandreason/print/pdfs/woi%20asimov1.pdf |work=transcript page 6, 10/17/1988 show |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1988 interview by [[Bill Moyers]], Asimov proposed [[computer-aided learning]], where people would use computers to find information on subjects in which they were interested.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Moyer's World of Ideas, Part II |url=https://www.pbs.org/moyers/faithandreason/print/pdfs/woi%20asimov2.pdf |work=transcript page 3, 10/17/1988 show |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}</ref> He thought this would make learning more interesting, since people would have the freedom to choose what to learn, and would help spread knowledge around the world.

In a letter reprinted in ''Yours, Isaac Asimov'',<ref name=\"YIA\">Asimov, Isaac (1996). ''Yours, Isaac Asimov'', edited by Stanley Asimov. {{ISBN|0-385-47624-8}}.</ref> he states that although he would prefer living in \"no danger whatsoever\" than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum on [[Love Canal]] or near \"a [[Union Carbide]] plant producing [[methyl isocyanate]]\", the latter being a reference to the [[Bhopal disaster]].<ref name=\"YIA\"/>\n\nIn the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in New York City on the shrinking tax base caused by the [[white flight|middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, though he continued to support high taxes on the middle class to pay for social programs. His last nonfiction book, ''[[Our Angry Earth]]'' (1991, co-written with his long-time friend, science fiction author [[Frederik Pohl]]), deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[oil dependence]], [[war]], [[global warming]], and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Our Angry Earth |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |last2=Pohl |first2=Frederik |date=1991 |publisher=Tor |location=New York |isbn=0-312-85252-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ourangryearth0000asim }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Dan |date=December 1991 |title=Review: Our Angry Earth |magazine=Locus |location=Oakland |publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> In response to being presented by [[Bill Moyers]] with the question \"What do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate?\", Asimov responded:\n\n{{quote|It's going to destroy it all ... if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing. You have to set up, you have to set up times for each person, you have to bang at the door, aren't you through yet, and so on. And in the same way, democracy cannot survive overpopulation. Human dignity cannot survive it. Convenience and decency cannot survive it.

R. R. Tolkien]], using ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as a plot point in a [[Black Widowers]] story.<ref name=\"asimov1976\">{{Cite book|title=More Tales of the Black Widowers |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1976 |isbn=0-385-11176-2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/moretalesofblack00asim/page/62 62\u201376] |chapter=Nothing Like Murder |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/moretalesofblack00asim#page/62/mode/2up |url=https://archive.org/details/moretalesofblack00asim/page/62 }}</ref> (Tolkien said that he enjoyed Asimov's science fiction.<ref>{{ME-ref|Letters|No. 294}}</ref>) He acknowledged other writers as superior to himself in talent, saying of [[Harlan Ellison]], \"He is (in my opinion) one of the best writers in the world, far more skilled at the art than I am.\"<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' p. 246</ref> Asimov disapproved of the [[New Wave science fiction|New Wave]]'s growing influence, however, stating in 1967 \"I want science fiction. I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction\".{{r|asimov196708}}\n\nThe feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] were demonstrated by the so-called \"Clarke-Asimov Treaty of [[Park Avenue]]\", negotiated as they shared a cab in New York. This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself). Thus, the dedication in Clarke's book ''Report on Planet Three'' (1972) reads: \"In accordance with the terms of the Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer.\"\n\nAsimov became a fan of mystery stories at the same time as science fiction. He preferred to read the former to latter because \"I read every [science fiction] story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine, in which case I had no patience with it, or that it might be better, in which case I felt miserable\".{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov wrote \"I make no secret of the fact that in my mysteries I use [[Agatha Christie]] as my model. In my opinion, her mysteries are the best ever written, far better than the Sherlock Holmes stories, and [[Hercule Poirot]] is the best detective fiction has seen. Why should I not use as my model what I consider the best?\"<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' (1995, Bantam Books), p. 379</ref> He enjoyed Sherlock Holmes, but considered [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] to be \"a slapdash and sloppy writer.\"<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' (1995, Bantam Books), p. 391</ref>\n\nAsimov also enjoyed humorous stories, particularly those of [[P. G. Wodehouse]].<ref>Asimov (1979) ''In Memory Yet Green'' p. 90</ref>\n\nIn non-fiction writing, Asimov particularly admired the writing style of [[Martin Gardner]], and tried to emulate it in his own science books. On meeting Gardner for the first time in 1965, Asimov told him this, to which Gardner answered that he had based his own style on Asimov's.<ref>Asimov, ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1980) p. 369</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\n[[Paul Krugman]], holder of a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]], has stated Asimov's concept of [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]] inspired him to become an economist.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/30/who-are-you-calling-dense/ |title=The Conscience of a Liberal, 'Who Are You Calling Dense?' |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |last=Krugman |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Krugman |work=The New York Times |date=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\nJohn Jenkins, who has reviewed the vast majority of Asimov's written output, once observed, \"It has been pointed out that most science fiction writers since the 1950s have been affected by Asimov, either modeling their style on his or deliberately avoiding anything like his style.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/NonAsimov/White.html |title=Review of an Asimov biography, 'The Unauthorized Life' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> Along with such figures as [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Karl Popper]], Asimov left his mark as one of the most distinguished [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinarians]] of the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M.|title=Ten Cheers for Interdisciplinarity: The Case for Interdisciplinary Knowledge and Research|url=http://drnissani.net/mnissani/pagepub/10CHEERS.HTM|journal=Social Science Journal |date=1997 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=201\u2013216 |doi=10.1016/s0362-3319(97)90051-3}}</ref> \"Few individuals\", writes [[Philosophy: An Introduction to the Art of Wondering|James L.

The Galactic Empire novels are set in earlier history of the same fictional universe as the Foundation series. Later, with ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' (1986), he linked this distant future to the Robot stories, creating a unified \"[[future history]]\" for his stories much like those pioneered by Robert A.

Most of his popular science books explain concepts in a historical way, going as far back as possible to a time when the science in question was at its simplest stage. Examples include ''[[The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science|Guide to Science]]'', the three-volume set ''[[Understanding Physics]]'', and ''Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery''.

His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' (1957). He began publishing nonfiction as co-author of a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly [[popular science]] books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels, while writing over 120 nonfiction books. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Prelude to Foundation |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1988 |pages=xiii\u2013xv |nopp=true }}</ref> [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Houghton Mifflin]] published about 60% of his work as of 1969, Asimov stating that \"both represent a father image\".{{r|nichols19690803}}\n\nAsimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his \"[[Three Laws of Robotics]]\" and the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]].<ref>''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' p.&nbsp;329</ref> Furthermore, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits his science fiction for introducing into the English language the words \"[[robotics]]\", \"[[positronic brain|positronic]]\" (an entirely fictional technology), and \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" (which is also used for a [[Psychohistory|different study]] on historical motivations). Asimov coined the term \"robotics\" without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], but for [[robot]]s. Unlike his word \"psychohistory\", the word \"robotics\" continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov's original definition. ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' featured [[android (robot)|androids]] with \"[[positronic brain]]s\" and the first-season episode \"[[Datalore]]\" called the positronic brain \"Asimov's dream\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#series12 |title=Is Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation an Asimovian robot? |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAsimov was so prolific that his books span all major categories of the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] except for category 100, [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]].<ref name=\"AsimovFAQ-DeweyDecimal\" /> Although Asimov did write several essays about psychology,<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/oldsite/Essays/psychology.html |title=Asimov essays about psychology |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=1995 |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}</ref> and forewords for the books ''The Humanist Way'' (1988) and ''In Pursuit of Truth'' (1982),<ref name=\"Popper\" /> which were classified in the 100s category, none of his own books were classified in that category.<ref name=\"AsimovFAQ-DeweyDecimal\">{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#others11 |title=Did you know that Asimov is the only author to have published books in all ten categories of the Dewey Decimal System? |date=2014 |accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[UNESCO]]'s ''Index Translationum database'', Asimov is the world's 24th most-translated author.<ref>''[http://www.unesco.org/xtrans/bsstatexp.aspx?crit1L=5&nTyp=min&topN=50 Index Translationum database]''</ref>\n\n=== Science fiction ===\n{{quote|No matter how various the subject matter I write on, I was a science-fiction writer first and it is as a science-fiction writer that I want to be identified.|Asimov, 1980<ref>{{Cite book |title=In Joy Still Felt|last= Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Avon |year=1980 |location= New York|pages= 286-287}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:GXY5101 0000fc.jpg|thumb|right|The first installment of Asimov's ''Tyrann'' was the cover story in the fourth issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' in 1951.

In May 1937 he first thought of writing professionally, and began writing his first science fiction story, \"Cosmic Corkscrew\" (now lost), that year. On May 17, 1938, puzzled by a change in the schedule of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', Asimov visited its publisher [[Street & Smith Publications]]. Inspired by the visit, he finished the story on June 19, 1938 and personally submitted it to ''Astounding'' editor [[John W. Campbell]] two days later. Campbell met with Asimov for more than an hour and promised to read the story himself. Two days later he received a rejection letter explaining why in detail.{{r|earlyyears1_9}} This was the first of what became almost weekly meetings with the editor while Asimov lived in New York, until moving to Boston in 1949;{{r|earlyyears560_564}} Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and became a personal friend.<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford, England]] |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 12\u201313, 20] |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 }}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the month Asimov completed a second story, \"[[The Callistan Menace|Stowaway]]\".

The band and their impostors would likely be played by McCartney's group [[Wings (band)|Wings]], then at the height of their career.

While acknowledging the Oxford Dictionary reference, he incorrectly states that the word was first printed about one-third of the way down the first column of page 100, ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'', March 1942 printing of his short story \"[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Gold |publisher=Voyager <!-- was Eos --> |date=1996 <!-- was 2003 --> |origyear=1995 |location=London |isbn=0-00-648202-3 |pages=224\u2013225 |chapter=The Robot Chronicles}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Counting the Eons |chapter=4 The Word I Invented |publisher=Doubleday |date=1983 |quote=Robotics has become a sufficiently well developed technology to warrant articles and books on its history and I have watched this in amazement, and in some disbelief, because I invented ... the word|title-link=Counting the Eons }}</ref>\n\nIn the same story, Asimov also coined the term \"positronic\" (the counterpart to \"electronic\" for [[positron]]s).<ref>[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/positronic Oxford Dictionary website] entry for \"positronic\"</ref>\n\nAsimov coined the term \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" in his [[Foundation series|''Foundation'']] stories to name a fictional branch of science which combines [[history]], [[sociology]], and [[mathematical statistics]] to make general predictions about the future behavior of very large groups of people, such as the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]]. Asimov said later that he should have called it psychosociology. It was first introduced in the five short stories (1942\u20131944) which would later be collected as the 1951 [[fix-up]] novel ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Psychohistory |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=4\u20138 |publisher=Davis Publications |date=July 1988 |issn=0162-2188}}</ref> Somewhat later, the term \"[[psychohistory]]\" was applied by others to research of the effects of psychology on history.\n\n=== Other writings ===\nIn addition to his interest in science, Asimov was interested in history. Starting in the 1960s, he wrote 14 popular history books, including ''The Greeks: A Great Adventure'' (1965),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Greeks: A Great Adventure |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1965 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Republic'' (1966),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Republic |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1966 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Empire'' (1967),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Empire |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Egyptians'' (1967)<ref>{{cite book |title=The Egyptians |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Near East: 10,000 Years of History'' (1968),\n<ref>{{cite book |title=The Near East: 10,000 Years of History |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1968 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> and ''[[Asimov's Chronology of the World]]'' (1991).<ref>{{cite book |title=Asimov's Chronology of the World |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1991 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nHe published ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'' in two volumes\u2014covering the [[Old Testament]] in 1967 and the [[New Testament]] in 1969\u2014and then combined them into one 1,300-page volume in 1981. Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters. His interest in literature manifested itself in several annotations of literary works, including ''[[Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare]]'' (1970),{{efn|Asimov, ''In Joy Still Felt'' (1980), pp. 464\u2013465: \"Of all the books I have ever worked on, I think ''Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare'' gave me the most pleasure, day in, day out. For months and months I lived and thought Shakespeare, and I don't see how there can be any greater pleasure in the world\u2014any pleasure, that is, that one can indulge in for as much as ten hours without pause, day after day indefinitely.\"}} ''Asimov's Annotated Paradise Lost'' (1974), and ''The Annotated Gulliver's Travels'' (1980).<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' chapter 112</ref>\n\nAsimov was also a noted mystery author and a frequent contributor to ''Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine''. He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing \"pure\" mysteries. He published two full-length mystery novels, and wrote 66 stories about the [[Black Widowers]], a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle. He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, who he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Puzzles of the Black Widowers |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1991 |pages=xiii |nopp=true }}</ref>\n\nToward the end of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], mostly written by himself, starting with ''[[Lecherous Limericks]]'', which appeared in 1975. ''Limericks: Too Gross'', whose title displays Asimov's love of [[pun]]s, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by [[John Ciardi]]. He even created a slim volume of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlockian]] limericks. Asimov featured [[Yiddish]] humor in ''[[Azazel (Asimov)|Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon]]''. The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of \"George\" and his friend Azazel. Asimov's ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on [[Theory of humor|humor theory]]. According to Asimov, the most essential element of humor is an abrupt change in point of view, one that suddenly shifts focus from the important to the trivial, or from the sublime to the ridiculous.<ref name=\"Asimov 1971\">{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1971 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=New York |isbn=0-395-12665-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Asimov 1992\">{{cite book|title=Asimov Laughs Again |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1992 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |isbn=0-06-016826-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/asimovlaughsagai00isaa }}</ref>\n\nParticularly in his later years, Asimov to some extent cultivated an image of himself as an amiable lecher. In 1971, as a response to the popularity of sexual guidebooks such as ''[[The Sensuous Woman]]'' (by \"J\") and ''[[The Sensuous Man]]'' (by \"M\"), Asimov published ''[[The Sensuous Dirty Old Man]]'' under the byline \"Dr. 'A{{'\"}}<ref>''In Joy Still Felt'' p. 569</ref> (although his full name was printed on the paperback edition, first published 1972). However, by 2016, some of Asimov's behavior towards women was described as [[sexual harassment]] and cited as an example of historically problematic behavior by men in science fiction communities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/dont-look-away-fighting-sexual-harassment-in-the-scifi-1785704207|title=Don't Look Away: Fighting Sexual Harassment in the Scifi/Fantasy Community|last=Hines|first=Jim C.|date=August 29, 2016|work=io9|access-date=December 18, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAsimov published [[Autobiographies of Isaac Asimov|three volumes of autobiography]].

In it they offer advice on how to maintain a positive attitude and stay productive when dealing with discouragement, distractions, rejection, and thick-headed editors. The book includes many quotations, essays, anecdotes, and husband-wife dialogues about the ups and downs of being an author.<ref>{{cite book|title=How to Enjoy Writing: A Book of Aid and Comfort |last=Asimov |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Asimov |last2=Asimov |first2=Isaac |date=1987 |publisher=Walker & Co. |location=New York |isbn=0-8027-0945-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/howtoenjoywritin00asim_0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book362.html |title=How to Enjoy Writing: A Book of Aid and Comfort |publisher=John H.

Asimov wrote a critical essay on ''Star Trek''{{'}}s scientific accuracy for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine. Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series. Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to ''TV Guide'' claiming that despite its inaccuracies, ''Star Trek'' was a fresh and intellectually challenging [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] show. The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of ''Star Trek'' projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/getting-star-trek-on-air-was-impossible.html |title=Letters of Note: Getting Star Trek on the air was impossible |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Calendar}}\nIn 1973, Asimov published a proposal for [[calendar reform]], called the World Season Calendar. It divides the year into four seasons (named A\u2013D) of 13 weeks (91 days) each. This allows days to be named, e.g., \"D-73\" instead of December 1 (due to December 1 being the 73rd day of the 4th quarter). An extra 'year day' is added for a total of 365 days.<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |chapter=The Week Excuse |title=The Tragedy of the Moon |pages=48\u201358 |publisher=Doubleday and Co |date=1973 |isbn=0-440-18999-3|title-link=The Tragedy of the Moon }}</ref>\n\n=== Awards and recognition ===\nAsimov won more than a dozen annual awards for particular works of science fiction and a half dozen lifetime awards.<ref name=SFAwards>[http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit5.html#179 \"Asimov, Isaac\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016200502/http://locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit5.html |date=October 16, 2012 }}.

(Asimov only used an [[outline (list)|outline]] once, later describing it as \"like trying to play the piano from inside a straitjacket\".) After correcting the draft by hand, he retyped the document as the final copy and only made one revision with minor editor-requested changes; a [[word processor]] did not save him much time, Asimov said, because 95% of the first draft was unchanged.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\"/><ref name=\"fallows198207\">{{Cite magazine |last=Fallows |first=James |date=July 1982 |title=Living With a Computer |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/07/living-with-a-computer/306063/ |magazine=The Atlantic |language=en-US |access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter disliking making multiple revisions of \"[[Black Friar of the Flame]]\", Asimov refused to make major, second, or non-editorial revisions (\"like chewing used gum\"), stating that \"too large a revision, or too many revisions, indicate that the piece of writing is a failure. In the time it would take to salvage such a failure, I could write a new piece altogether and have infinitely more fun in the process\". He submitted \"failures\" to another editor.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/142/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City, NY |pages=142\u2013145}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most common impressions of Asimov's fiction work is that his writing style is extremely unornamented. In 1980, science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]], professor [[emeritus]] of [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Kansas]] wrote of ''I, Robot'':\n\n{{quote|Except for two stories\u2014\"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]\" and \"[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]\"\u2014they are not stories in which character plays a significant part. Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action. Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind. The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent. ... . The robot stories and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction\u2014play themselves on a relatively bare stage.<ref name=\"IASFM-Gunn\">{{cite magazine |last=Gunn |first=James | author-link = James Gunn (author) |title=On Variations on a Robot |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine |date=July 1980 |pages=56\u201381 }}</ref>}}\n\nAsimov addressed such criticism at the beginning of ''[[Nemesis (Isaac Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'':\n\n{{quote|I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing\u2014to be 'clear'. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics\u2014Well, they can do whatever they wish.<ref name=\"Nemesis-Authour's note\">{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Nemesis |date=October 1989 }}</ref>}}\n\nGunn cited examples of a more complex style, such as the climax of \"Liar!\". Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: [[Susan Calvin]] in \"Liar!\" and \"Evidence\", [[Arkady Darell]] in ''Second Foundation'', Elijah Baley in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', and [[Hari Seldon]] in the ''Foundation'' prequels.\n\nOther than books by Gunn and Joseph Patrouch, a relative dearth of \"literary\" criticism exists on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer's ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' (1981) gives a possible reason:\n\n{{quote|His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional [[literary criticism]] because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening. In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition. Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science Fiction Writers |last=Cowart |first=David |last2=Wymer |first2=Thomas L. |date=1981 |publisher=Gale Research |location=Detroit |pages=15\u201329}}</ref>}}\n\nGunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both state that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn's 1982 book comments in detail on each of Asimov's novels. He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but calls some passages in ''The Caves of Steel'' \"reminiscent of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]\". When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose \"need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn }}</ref>\n\nAlthough he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited [[Clifford D. Simak]] as an early influence{{r|earlyyears79_82}}<ref>''Beyond the Golden Age'' pp. 222\u2013223</ref>), and said in 1973 that his style had not changed,{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated [[narrative structure]]s, often by arranging chapters in non[[Chronology|chronological]] ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the [[Nonlinear (arts)|nonlinearity]] is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of ''The Gods Themselves'' begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book121.html |title=Review of ''The Gods Themselves'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create \"[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]\", one of the early ''Robot'' stories). Patrouch found that the interwoven and nested flashbacks of ''[[The Currents of Space]]'' did serious harm to that novel, to such an extent that only a \"dyed-in-the-[[kyrt]]<ref>Asimov, Isaac (1952), [http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/isaac-asimov/currents-of-space.htm ''The Currents of Space''], explanation of \"kyrt\"</ref> Asimov fan\" could enjoy it. In his later novel ''Nemesis'' one group of characters lives in the \"present\" and another group starts in the \"past\", beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n=== Limitations ===\n==== Sexuality ====\nAsimov attributed the lack of romance and sex in his fiction to the \"early imprinting\" from starting his writing career when he had never been on a date and \"didn't know anything about girls\".{{r|earlyyears25_28}} He was sometimes criticized for the general absence of sex (and of [[extraterrestrial life]]) in his science fiction. He claimed he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' to respond to these criticisms,<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Joy Still Felt |date=1980 |page=567}}</ref> which often came from [[New Wave science fiction]] (and often British) writers. The second part (of three) of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes, and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted.\n\n==== Alien life ====\nAsimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when ''Astounding''{{'}}s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real-world racial bias. Unwilling to write only weak alien races, and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell's friendship, he decided he would not write about aliens at all.<ref name=\"Early Asimov\" /> Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'', which contains aliens and alien sex. The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1972,<ref name=\"WWE\" /> and the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1973.<ref name=\"WWE\" /> Asimov said that of all his writings, he was most proud of the middle section of ''The Gods Themselves'', the part that deals with those themes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=250}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novelette \"[[Gold (Asimov short story)|Gold]]\", Asimov describes an author, clearly based on himself, who has one of his books (''The Gods Themselves'') adapted into a \"compu-drama\", essentially [[photo-realistic]] [[computer animation]]. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov (\"Gregory Laborian\") for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gold |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=HarperPrism |location=New York |isbn=0-06-105206-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 109\u2013138] |url=https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 }}</ref>\n\n==== Portrayal of women ====\nAsimov was criticized for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings, such as ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' (\"Women and Science Fiction\"), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early science-fiction stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. For example, the August 25, 1985 ''Washington Post''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Book World\" section reports of ''Robots and Empire'' as follows:\n\n{{quote|In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are. His robots were tin cans with speedlines like an old [[Studebaker]], and still are; the ''Robot'' tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable [[artificial intelligence]]s, and still do. In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no [[genetic engineering]], aliens, [[arcologies]], [[multiverses]], [[Clone (genetics)|clones]], sin or sex; his heroes (in this case [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], whom we first met as the robot protagonist of ''The Caves of Steel'' and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly.}}\n\nHowever, some of his robot stories, including the earliest ones, featured the character [[Susan Calvin]], a forceful and intelligent woman who regularly out-performed her male colleagues.<ref>Asimov (1983) ''The Complete Robot'', Grafton Books, p. 327</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote|There is a perennial question among readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views of the author.

''In Memory Yet Green: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1920\u20131954''. Doubleday, 1979.</ref> versed in the sacred writings. This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'', an analysis of the historic foundations for both the Old and New Testaments. For many years, Asimov called himself an [[atheism|atheist]]; however, he considered the term somewhat inadequate, as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did. Eventually, he described himself as a \"[[Humanism|humanist]]\" and considered that term more practical. He did, however, continue to identify himself as a nonobservant Jew, as stated in his introduction to [[Jack Dann]]'s anthology of Jewish science fiction, ''[[Wandering Stars]]'': \"I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite, the [[bar mitzvah]]. It doesn't matter. I am Jewish.\"<ref>\"I make no secret of the fact that I am a non-observant Jew\", Asimov, Isaac. ''Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine'', Volume 15, Issues 10\u201313. p. 8. Davis Publishing, 1991.</ref>\n\nWhen asked in an interview in 1982 if he was an atheist, Asimov replied,\n\n{{quote|I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have.

Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment. If an afterlife existed, he claimed, the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who \"slandered God by inventing Hell\".<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

He was a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and in a television interview during the early 1970s he publicly endorsed [[George McGovern]].<ref>Asimov, I. ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1981) p. 503</ref> He was unhappy about what he considered an \"irrationalist\" viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late 1960s and onwards. In his second volume of autobiography, ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure [[Abbie Hoffman]]. Asimov's impression was that the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s' counterculture]] heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a \"no-man's land of the spirit\" from which he wondered if they would ever return.<ref name=\"joy\">{{cite book|title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954\u20131978 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1980 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City, NY|isbn=0-385-15544-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 574] |url=https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 }}</ref>\n\nAsimov vehemently opposed [[Richard Nixon]], considering him \"a crook and a liar\". He closely followed [[Watergate]], and was pleased when the president was forced to resign.

In his first autobiography, he indicates his support for the safety of Israel, though insisting that he was not a [[Zionist]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |quote=<!--None-->}}</ref> In his third autobiography, Asimov stated his opposition to the creation of a Jewish state, on the grounds that he was opposed to the concept of nation-states in general, and supported the notion of a single humanity. Asimov especially worried about the safety of Israel given that it had been created among hostile neighbors, and said that Jews had merely created for themselves another \"Jewish ghetto\".{{efn|{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=380 |quote=When Israel was founded in 1948 and all my Jewish friends were jubilant, I was the skeleton at the feast.

His last nonfiction book, ''[[Our Angry Earth]]'' (1991, co-written with his long-time friend, science fiction author [[Frederik Pohl]]), deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[oil dependence]], [[war]], [[global warming]], and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Our Angry Earth |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |last2=Pohl |first2=Frederik |date=1991 |publisher=Tor |location=New York |isbn=0-312-85252-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ourangryearth0000asim }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Dan |date=December 1991 |title=Review: Our Angry Earth |magazine=Locus |location=Oakland |publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> In response to being presented by [[Bill Moyers]] with the question \"What do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate?\", Asimov responded:\n\n{{quote|It's going to destroy it all ... if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing.

This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself). Thus, the dedication in Clarke's book ''Report on Planet Three'' (1972) reads: \"In accordance with the terms of the Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer.\"\n\nAsimov became a fan of mystery stories at the same time as science fiction. He preferred to read the former to latter because \"I read every [science fiction] story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine, in which case I had no patience with it, or that it might be better, in which case I felt miserable\".{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov wrote \"I make no secret of the fact that in my mysteries I use [[Agatha Christie]] as my model. In my opinion, her mysteries are the best ever written, far better than the Sherlock Holmes stories, and [[Hercule Poirot]] is the best detective fiction has seen. Why should I not use as my model what I consider the best?\"<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' (1995, Bantam Books), p. 379</ref> He enjoyed Sherlock Holmes, but considered [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] to be \"a slapdash and sloppy writer.\"<ref>''I.

Wodehouse]].<ref>Asimov (1979) ''In Memory Yet Green'' p. 90</ref>\n\nIn non-fiction writing, Asimov particularly admired the writing style of [[Martin Gardner]], and tried to emulate it in his own science books.
