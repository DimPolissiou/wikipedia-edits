The first song revealed the influence of [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], who had also influenced [[Bob Dylan]]. Dylan comparisons followed for some time.<ref name=pc48>{{Gilliland|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19823/m1 |title=Show 48 \u2013 The British are Coming!

She influenced Donovan's music but refused to marry him and she moved to the United States for several years in the late 1960s. They met by chance in 1970 and married soon after. Donovan had other relationships \u2013 one of which resulted in the birth of his first two children, [[Donovan Leitch (actor)|Donovan Leitch]] and [[Ione Skye]], both of whom became actors.\n\n====Donovan and Dylan====\nDuring Bob Dylan's trip to the UK in the spring of 1965, the British music press were making comparisons of the two singer-songwriters and going so far as to stir up allegations of a rivalry, and other luminaries of the pop scene were chiming in. [[The Rolling Stones]] guitarist Brian Jones said,\n\n{{quote|We've been watching Donovan too. He isn't too bad a singer but his stuff sounds like Dylan's. His 'Catch The Wind' sounds like 'Chimes of Freedom'. He's got a song, 'Hey Tangerine Eyes' and it sounds like Dylan's 'Mr. Tambourine Man'.<ref>Rolling Stones off The Record\", Mark Paytress, p.&nbsp;90</ref>}}\n\nDonovan is the undercurrent In [[D. A. Pennebaker]]'s film ''[[Dont Look Back]]'' documenting Dylan's tour. Near the start of the film, Dylan opens a newspaper and exclaims, \"Donovan? Who is this Donovan?\" and his associates spur the rivalry on by telling Dylan that Donovan is a better guitar player, but that he had only been around for three months. Throughout the film Donovan's name is seen next to Dylan's on newspaper headlines and on posters in the background, and Dylan and his friends refer to him consistently.\n\nDonovan finally appears in the second half of the film, along with [[Derroll Adams]], in Dylan's suite at the [[Savoy Hotel]] despite Donovan's management refusing to allow journalists to be present, saying they did not want \"any stunt on the lines of the disciple meeting the messiah\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sabotage.demon.co.uk/donovan/art/1.htm#mm5/5/65 |title=Melody Maker |date=5 May 1965 |publisher=Sabotage.demon.co.uk |accessdate=18 May 2011}}</ref> According to Pennebaker, Dylan told him not to film the encounter, and Donovan played a song that sounded just like \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]\" but with different words. When confronted with lifting his tune, Donovan said that he thought it was an old folk song.<ref name=\"Marcus, 2011\">{{citation|last1=Marcus |first1=Greil |title=Greil Marcus interviews D.A. Pennebaker about filming Bob Dylan|date=2011|publisher=New Video's Docurama Films|format=Video}}</ref> Once the camera rolled, Donovan plays his song, \"To Sing For You\", and then asks Dylan to play \"[[It's All Over Now, Baby Blue|Baby Blue]]\". Dylan later told ''[[Melody Maker]]'': \"He played some songs to me.&nbsp;... I like him.&nbsp;... He's a nice guy.\" ''Melody Maker'' noted that Dylan had mentioned Donovan in his song \"[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan|Talking World War Three Blues]]\" and that the crowd had jeered, to which Dylan had responded backstage: \"I didn't mean to put the guy down in my songs. I just did it for a joke, that's all.\"\n\nIn an interview for the BBC in 2001 to mark Dylan's 60th birthday, Donovan acknowledged Dylan as an influence early in his career while distancing himself from \"Dylan clone\" allegations:\n\n{{quote|The one who really taught us to play and learn all the traditional songs was [[Martin Carthy]] \u2013 who incidentally was contacted by Dylan when Bob first came to the UK. Bob was influenced, as all American folk artists are, by the [[Celtic music]] of Ireland, Scotland and England. But in 1962 we folk Brits were also being influenced by some folk Blues and the American folk-exponents of our Celtic Heritage&nbsp;... Dylan appeared after [[Woody Guthrie|Woody]] [Guthrie], [[Pete Seeger|Pete]] [Seeger] and [[Joan Baez|Joanie]] [Baez] had conquered our hearts, and he sounded like a cowboy at first but I knew where he got his stuff \u2013 it was Woody at first, then it was [[Jack Kerouac]] and the stream-of-consciousness poetry which moved him along. But when I heard '[[Blowin' in the Wind]]' it was the clarion call to the new generation \u2013 and we artists were encouraged to be as brave in writing our thoughts in music&nbsp;... We were not captured by his influence, we were encouraged to mimic him \u2013 and remember every British band from the [[Rolling Stones|Stones]] to the [[Beatles]] were copying note for note, lick for lick, all the American pop and blues artists \u2013 this is the way young artists learn. There's no shame in mimicking a hero or two \u2013 it flexes the creative muscles and tones the quality of our composition and technique. It was not only Dylan who influenced us \u2013 for me he was a spearhead into protest, and we all had a go at his style. I sounded like him for five minutes \u2013 others made a career of his sound. Like troubadours, Bob and I can write about any facet of the human condition.

Carr's conga style and McNair's flute playing are a feature of many recordings. Cameron, McNair and Carr also accompanied Donovan on several concert tours and can be heard on his 1968 live album ''[[Donovan in Concert (1968 album)|Donovan in Concert]]''.\n\n====''Sunshine Superman''====\nBy 1966, Donovan had shed the Dylan/Guthrie influences and become one of the first British pop musicians to adopt [[flower power]]. He immersed himself in jazz, [[blues]], [[Eastern world|Eastern]] music, and the new generation of [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]-era [[West Coast of the United States|US West Coast]] bands such as [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[the Grateful Dead]]. He was entering his most creative phase as a songwriter and recording artist, working with Mickie Most and with arranger, musician, and jazz fan [[John Cameron (musician)|John Cameron]]. Their first collaboration was \"[[Sunshine Superman]]\", one of the first [[psychedelic pop]] records.<ref name=\"classicbands\"/>\n\nDonovan's rise stalled in December 1965 when ''Billboard'' broke news of the impending production deal between Klein, Most, and Donovan, and then reported that Donovan was to sign with [[Epic Records]] in the US. Despite Kozak's denials, [[Pye Records]] dropped the single and a contract dispute ensued, because Pye had a US licensing arrangement with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. As a result, the UK release of the ''Sunshine Superman'' LP was delayed for months, robbing it of the impact it would have had. Another outcome was that the UK and US versions of this and later albums differed \u2013 three of his Epic LPs were not released in the UK, and ''Sunshine Superman'' was issued in a different form in each country. Several tracks on his late 1960s Epic (US) LPs were not released in the UK for many years. The legal dispute continued into early 1966. During the hiatus, Donovan holidayed in [[Greece]], where he wrote \"Writer in the Sun\",<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hit-channel.com/interview-donovan/68376 |title=Interview: Donovan |publisher=Hit-channel.com |date=20 June 2014 |accessdate=19 August 2015}}</ref> inspired by rumours that his recording career was over. He toured the US and appeared on episode 23 of [[Pete Seeger]]'s television show ''[[Rainbow Quest]]'' in 1966 with [[Shawn Phillips]] and [[Rev. Gary Davis]]. After his return to London, he developed his friendship with [[Paul McCartney]] and contributed the line \"sky of blue and sea of green\" to \"[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldies.about.com/od/thebeatlessongs/a/yellowsubmarine.htm|title=Robert Fontenot: \"Yellow Submarine: The history of this classic Beatles song\", About.com; retrieved 2 December 2008|publisher=Oldies.about.com|accessdate=18 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nBy spring 1966, the American contract problems had been resolved, and Donovan signed a $100,000 deal with Epic Records. Donovan and Most went to [[CBS Studio Building|CBS Studios]] in Los Angeles, where they recorded tracks for an LP, much composed during the preceding year. Although folk elements were prominent, the album showed increasing influence of jazz, American west coast psychedelia and [[folk rock]] \u2013 especially [[the Byrds]]. The LP sessions were completed in May, and \"[[Sunshine Superman]]\" was released in the US as a single in June. It was a success, selling 800,000 in six weeks and reaching No. 1. It went on to sell over one million, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Murrells |year=1978 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |edition=2nd |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/204 204] |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/204 }}</ref> The LP followed in August, preceded by orders of 250,000 copies, reached No. 11 on the US [[Billboard 200|album chart]] and sold over half a million.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/>\n\nThe US version of the ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]'' album is in [[chamber music|chamber]]-style folk-jazz arrangements, and features instruments including acoustic bass, [[sitar]], saxophone, tablas and congas, harpsichord, strings and oboe. Highlights include the swinging \"[[The Fat Angel]]\", which Donovan's book confirms was written for [[Cass Elliot]] of [[the Mamas & the Papas]]. The song is notable for naming the Jefferson Airplane before they became known internationally and before [[Grace Slick]] joined. Other tracks include \"Bert's Blues\" (a tribute to [[Bert Jansch]]), \"Guinevere\", and \"Legend of a Girl Child Linda\", a track featuring voice, acoustic guitar and a small orchestra for over six minutes.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Hurdy Gurdy Man |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PVsIp2DSuQMC&pg=PA164 |accessdate=19 February 2013|isbn = 9780099487036|author1 = Donovan|last2 = Leitch|first2 = Donovan|year = 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe album also features the [[sitar]], which was played by American folk-rock singer [[Shawn Phillips]]. Donovan met Phillips in London in 1965, and he became a friend and early collaborator, playing acoustic guitar and sitar on recordings including ''Sunshine Superman'' as well as accompanying Donovan at concerts and on Pete Seeger's TV show. Creatively, Phillips served as a silent partner in the gestation of many of Donovan's songs from the era, with the singer later acknowledging that Phillips primarily composed \"[[Season of the Witch (song)|Season of the Witch]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldminemag.com/article/follow-the-ever-changing-ballad-of-singer-songwriter-shawn-phillips |title=Follow the ever-changing ballad of Shawn Phillips |date=25 July 2012|publisher=}}</ref> Several songs including the title track had a harder edge. The driving, jazzy \"The Trip\", named after a Los Angeles club name, chronicled an [[LSD]] [[Psychedelic experience|trip]] during his time in L.A. and is loaded with references to his sojourn on the West Coast, and names Dylan and Baez. The third \"heavy\" song was \"Season of the Witch\".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Recorded with American and British session players, it features Donovan's first recorded performance on electric guitar. The song was covered by [[Julie Driscoll]], [[Brian Auger]] and the Trinity on their first LP in 1967, and [[Al Kooper]] and [[Stephen Stills]] recorded an 11-minute version on the 1968 album, ''[[Super Session]]''. Donovan's version is also in the closing sequence of the [[Gus Van Sant]] film, ''[[To Die For]]''. {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nBecause of earlier contractual problems, the UK version of ''Sunshine Superman'' LP was not released for another nine months. This was a compilation of tracks from the US albums ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]'' and ''[[Mellow Yellow (album)|Mellow Yellow]]''. Donovan did not choose the tracks.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n====Mellow Yellow====\n[[File:Royal Albert Hall, London - Nov 2012.jpg|thumb|Royal Albert Hall]]\nOn 24 October 1966, Epic released the single \"[[Mellow Yellow]]\", arranged by [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] and purportedly featuring [[Paul McCartney]] on backing vocals, but not in the chorus.<ref name=\"classicbands\"/> In his autobiography Donovan explained \"electrical banana\" was a reference to a \"yellow-coloured vibrator\".<ref>Donovan, ''Donovan in Concert'', released on Atlantic July 1968, re-issued on BGO February 2002.

In January he gave a concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] accompanied by a ballerina who danced during a 12-minute performance of \"Golden Apples\". On 14 January, [[NME|New Musical Express]] reported he was to write incidental music for a [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] production of ''[[As You Like It]]'', but this did not come to fruition. His version of \"[[Under the Greenwood Tree]]\" did appear on \"[[A Gift from a Flower to a Garden]]\".\n\nIn March Epic released the ''[[Mellow Yellow (album)|Mellow Yellow]]'' LP (not released in the UK), which reached No. 14 in the US album charts, plus a non-album single, \"[[Epistle to Dippy]]\", a Top 20 hit in the US. Written as an open letter to a school friend, the song had a pacifist message as well as psychedelic imagery. The real \"Dippy\" was in the [[British Army]] in Malaysia. According to Brian Hogg, who wrote the liner notes for the Donovan boxed set ''[[Troubadour: The Definitive Collection 1964\u20131976|Troubadour]]'', Dippy heard the song, contacted Donovan and left the army. On 9 February 1967, Donovan was among guests invited by the Beatles to Abbey Road Studios for the orchestral overdub for \"[[A Day in the Life]]\", the finale to ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Day in the Life:One Family, the Beautiful People, and the End of the Sixties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OfMWwVXsl0EC&pg=PT78 |accessdate=20 February 2013|isbn = 9780786748006|last1 = Greenfield|first1 = Robert|date = 17 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Arrest====\nIn mid-1966, Donovan became the first high-profile British pop star to be arrested for possession of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].<ref name=\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\"/> Donovan's drug use was mostly restricted to cannabis, with occasional use of [[LSD]] and [[mescaline]].{{fact|date=December 2019}} His LSD use is thought to be referenced indirectly in some of his lyrics.<ref name=\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\"/> Public attention was drawn to his marijuana use by the TV documentary ''A Boy Called Donovan'' in early 1966, which showed the singer and friends smoking cannabis at a party thrown by the film crew. Donovan's arrest proved to be the first in a long series involving the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. In early 1967, Donovan was subject of an expos\u00e9 in the ''[[News of the World]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pop Music and the Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=N-ViwZnnR3oC&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=donovan+1967+news+of+the+world#v=onepage&q=donovan%201967%20news%20of%20the%20world&f=false |accessdate=19 February 2013|isbn = 9781566399661|last1 = Jones|first1 = Steve|year = 2002}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Donovan, the article was based on an interview by an ex-girlfriend of his friend Gypsy Dave. The article was the first in a three-part series, ''Drugs & Pop Stars \u2013 Facts That Will Shock You.'' It was quickly shown some claims were false. A ''News of the World'' reporter claimed to have spent an evening with [[Mick Jagger]], who allegedly discussed his drug use and offered drugs to companions. He had mistaken Brian Jones for Jagger, and Jagger sued the newspaper for libel. Among other supposed revelations were claims that Donovan and stars including members of [[the Who]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], Rolling Stones and [[the Moody Blues]] regularly smoked marijuana, used other drugs, and held parties where the recently banned hallucinogen LSD was used, specifically naming the Who's [[Pete Townshend]] and Cream's [[Ginger Baker]].\n\nIt emerged later that the ''News of the World'' reporters were passing information to the police. In the late 1990s, ''The Guardian'' said ''News of the World'' reporters had alerted police to the party at [[Keith Richards]]'s home, which was raided on 12 February 1967. Although Donovan's was not as sensational as the later arrests of Jagger and Richards, he was refused entry to the US until late 1967. He could not appear at the [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey International Pop Festival]] in June that year.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Season of \"Season of the Witch\"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/05/season-of-the-witch.html|publisher=www.newyorker.com|accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1967\u201369: International success===\nIn July 1967, Epic released \"[[There Is a Mountain]]\", which just missed the US top ten and was later used as the basis for [[the Allman Brothers Band]]'s \"[[Mountain Jam]]\". In September, Donovan toured the US, backed by a jazz group and accompanied by his father, who introduced the show. Later that month, Epic released Donovan's fifth album, a set entitled, ''[[A Gift from a Flower to a Garden]]'', the first rock music box set and only the third pop-rock double album released. It was split into halves. The first, \"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\", was for people of his generation who would one day be parents; the second, \"[[For Little Ones]]\", was songs Donovan had written for coming generations. Worried it might be a poor seller, Epic boss [[Clive Davis]] also insisted the albums be split and sold separately in the US (the \"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\" album cover was photographed at [[Bodiam Castle]]), but his fears were unfounded \u2013 although it took time, the original boxed set sold steadily, eventually peaking at 19 in the US album chart and achieving gold record status in the US in early 1970.\n\nThe psychedelic and mystical overtones were unmistakable \u2013 the front cover featured an [[infrared photography|infra-red]] photograph by [[Karl Ferris]] showing Donovan in a robe holding flowers and peacock feathers, while the back photo showed him holding hands with Indian guru [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]. The liner notes included an appeal for young people to give up drugs. His disavowal of drugs came after his time with the Maharishi in [[Rishikesh]], a topic discussed in a two-part interview for the first two issues of ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Rolling Stone|title=Donovan: The Rolling Stone Interview|first=John|last=Carpenter|volume=1|issue=1,2|date=9\u201323 November 1967}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1967 Donovan contributed two songs to the [[Ken Loach]] film ''[[Poor Cow]]''. \"Be Not Too Hard\" was a musical setting of [[Christopher Logue]]'s poem ''September Song'', and was later recorded by such artists as [[Joan Baez]] and [[Shusha Guppy]]. The title track, originally entitled \"Poor Love\", was the B-side of his next single, \"[[Jennifer Juniper]]\", which was inspired by [[Jenny Boyd]], sister of [[George Harrison]]'s wife, [[Pattie Boyd]] and was another top 40 hit in the US. Donovan developed interest in eastern mysticism and claims to have interested the Beatles in [[transcendental meditation]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn early 1968 he was part of the group that traveled to the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in [[Rishikesh]]. The visit gained worldwide attention thanks to the presence of all four Beatles as well as [[Beach Boys]] lead singer [[Mike Love]], as well as actress [[Mia Farrow]] and her sister Prudence (who inspired Lennon to write \"[[Dear Prudence]]\"). According to a 1968 [[Paul McCartney]] interview with [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmbeatles.com/interviews.php?interview=66|title=Paul McCartney Interview: Promoting the White Album (20 November 1968)|publisher=Dmbeatles.com|accessdate=18 May 2011}}</ref> it was during this time that Donovan taught Lennon and McCartney [[fingerstyle guitar|finger-picking guitar]] styles including the [[clawhammer]], which he had learned from Mac MacLeod. Lennon used this technique on songs including \"[[Dear Prudence]]\", \"[[Julia (The Beatles song)|Julia]]\", \"[[Happiness is a Warm Gun]]\" and \"[[Look at Me (John Lennon song)|Look at Me]]\", and McCartney with \"[[Blackbird (Beatles song)|Blackbird]]\" and \"[[Mother Nature's Son]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Rolling Stone \u2013 Donovan on teaching guitar technique to the Beatles |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3tWkyYXcLc |website=You Tube |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\nDonovan's next single, in May 1968, was the psychedelic \"[[Hurdy Gurdy Man]]\". The liner notes from EMI's reissues say the song was intended for Mac MacLeod, who had a heavy rock band called [[Hurdy Gurdy (band)|Hurdy Gurdy]]. After hearing MacLeod's version, Donovan considered giving it to [[Jimi Hendrix]], but when Most heard it, he convinced Donovan to record it himself. Donovan tried to get Hendrix to play, but he was on tour.

The song became one of Donovan's biggest hits, making the Top 5 in the UK and the US, and the Top 10 in Australia.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn July 1968, Epic released ''[[Donovan in Concert (1968 album)|Donovan in Concert]]'', the recording of his Anaheim concert in September 1967. The cover featured only a painting by [[Fleur Cowles]] (with neither the artist's name nor the title). The album contained two of his big hits and songs which would have been new to the audience. The expanded double CD from 2006 contained \"Epistle To Derroll\", a tribute to one of his formative influences, [[Derroll Adams]]. The album also includes extended group arrangements of \"Young Girl Blues\" and \"The Pebble and the Man\", a song later reworked and retitled as \"Happiness Runs\". In the summer of 1968, Donovan worked on a second LP of children's songs, released in 1971 as the double album, ''[[HMS Donovan (album)|HMS Donovan]]''. In September, Epic released a single, \"[[Lal\u00e9na]]\", a subdued acoustic ballad which reached the low 30s in the US. The album ''[[The Hurdy Gurdy Man]]'' followed (not released in the UK), continuing the style of the ''[[Mellow Yellow (album)|Mellow Yellow]]'' LP and reached 20 in the US, despite containing two earlier hits, the title track and \"Jennifer Juniper\".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nAfter another US tour in the autumn he collaborated with Paul McCartney, who was producing ''[[Postcard (album)|Postcard]]'', the debut LP by Welsh singer [[Mary Hopkin]]. Hopkin covered three Donovan songs: \"Lord Of The Reedy River\", \"Happiness Runs\" and \"Voyage of the Moon\". McCartney returned the favour by playing tambourine and singing backing vocals on Donovan's next single, \"[[Atlantis (Donovan song)|Atlantis]]\", which was released in the UK (with \"I Love My Shirt\" as the B-side) in late November and reached 23.<ref name=ukcharts>{{cite web|title=Donovan|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/donovan/|publisher=officialcharts.com|accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nEarly in 1969, the comedy film ''[[If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium]]'' featured music by Donovan; the title tune was written by him and sung by J. P. Rags, and he also performed \"Lord of the Reedy River\" in the film as a singer at a youth hostel. On 20 January, Epic released the single, \"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\", with \"[[Atlantis (Donovan song)|Atlantis]]\" as the B-side. The A-side, a gentle [[Calypso music|calypso]]-styled song, contained another anti-war message, and became a moderate Top 40 US hit. However, when DJs in America and Australia flipped it and began playing \"Atlantis\", that became a hit. The gentle \"Atlantis\" formed the backdrop to a violent scene in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[GoodFellas]]''. \"Atlantis\" was revived in 2000 for an episode of ''[[Futurama]]'' titled \"The Deep South\" (2ACV12) which aired on 16 April that year. For this episode Donovan recorded a satirical version of the song describing the Lost City of [[Atlanta]] which featured in the episode.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn March 1969 (too soon to include \"Atlantis\"), Epic and Pye released ''Donovan's Greatest Hits'', which included four previous singles \u2013 \"Epistle To Dippy\", \"There is a Mountain\", \"Jennifer Juniper\" and \"Lal\u00e9na\", as well as rerecorded versions of \"[[Colours (Donovan song)|Colours]]\" and \"Catch The Wind\" (which had been unavailable to Epic because of Donovan's contractual problems) and stereo versions of \"Sunshine Superman\" (previously unissued full length version) and \"Season of the Witch\". It became the most successful album of his career; it reached 4 in the US, became a million-selling gold record, and stayed on the Billboard album chart for more than a year. On 26 June 1969 the track \"[[Barabajagal (single)|Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)]]\" (recorded May 1969), which gained him a following on the rave scene decades later, was released, reaching 12 in the UK but charting less strongly in the US. This time he was backed by the original [[Jeff Beck]] Group, featuring Beck on lead guitar, [[Ronnie Wood]] on bass, [[Nicky Hopkins]] on piano, and [[Micky Waller]] on drums. The Beck group was under contract to Most and it was Most's idea to team them with Donovan to bring a heavier sound to Donovan's work, while introducing a lyrical edge to Beck's.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nOn 7 July 1969, Donovan performed at the first show in the second season of free rock concerts in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London, which also featured [[Blind Faith]], [[Richie Havens]], [[the Edgar Broughton Band]] and the [[Third Ear Band]]. In September 1969, the \"Barabajagal\" album reached 23 in the US. Only the recent \"Barabajagal\"/\"Trudi\" single and \"Superlungs My Supergirl\" were 1969 recordings, the remaining tracks {{Clarify|date=February 2013}} were from sessions in London in May 1968 and in Los Angeles in November 1968. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn the late 60s to the early 70s he lived at [[Stein, Skye|Stein]], on the Isle of Skye, where he and a group of followers formed a commune and where he was visited by [[George Harrison]].

We fell out over that.<ref name=\"Lorne Murdoch 2005\">Lorne Murdoch, liner notes to ''Barabajagal'' expanded CD reissue (EMI, 2005)</ref>}}\n\n===Open Road band===\nDonovan said he wanted to record with someone else, and he and Most did not work together again until ''[[Cosmic Wheels]]'' (1973). After the rift, Donovan spent two months writing and recording the album ''[[Open Road (Donovan album)|Open Road]]'' as a member of the rock trio Open Road. Stripping the sound of Most's heavy studio productions down to stuff that could be played by a live band, Donovan dubbed the sound, \"[[Celtic Rock]]\". The album peaked at No. 16 in the US, the third highest of any of his full-length releases to date, but as his concert appearances became less frequent and new artists and styles of popular music began to emerge, his commercial success began to decline. Donovan said:\n\n<blockquote>I was exhausted and looking for roots and new directions. I checked into Morgan Studios in London and stayed a long while creating Open Road and the ''HMS Donovan'' sessions. Downstairs was McCartney, doing his solo album. I had left Mickie after great years together. The new decade dawned and I had accomplished everything any young singer songwriter could achieve. What else was there to do but to experiment beyond the fame and into the new life, regardless of the result?<ref name=\"Lorne Murdoch 2005\"/></blockquote>\n\nDonovan's plan for Open Road was to tour the world for a year, beginning with a boat voyage around the [[Aegean Sea]], documented in the 1970 film, ''[[There is an Ocean]]''. This was partially on the advice from his management to go into [[tax exile]], during which he was not to set foot in the UK until April 1971, but after touring to France, Italy, Russia, and Japan, he cut the tour short:\n\n<blockquote>I travelled to Japan and was set to stay out of the UK for a year and earn the largest fees yet for a solo performer, and all tax-free. At the time the UK tax for us was 98%. During that Japanese tour I had a gentle breakdown, which made me decide to break the tax exile. Millions were at stake. My father, my agent they pleaded for me not to step onto the [[BOAC]] jet bound for London. I did and went back to my little cottage in the woods. Two days later a young woman came seeking a cottage to rent. It was Linda.<ref name=\"Lorne Murdoch 2005\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Reunions with Linda Lawrence and Mickie Most===\nAfter this reunion, Donovan and Linda married on 2 October 1970 at Windsor register office and honeymooned in the Caribbean. Donovan dropped out of the round of tour promotion and concentrated on writing, recording and his family. The largely self-produced children's album ''HMS Donovan'' in 1971, went unreleased in the US and did not gain a wide audience. During an 18-month tax exile in Ireland (1971\u201372), he wrote for the 1972 film ''[[The Pied Piper (1972 film)|The Pied Piper]]'' in the title role, and for ''[[Brother Sun, Sister Moon]]'' (1972). The title song from the Zeffirelli film provided Donovan with a publishing windfall in 1974 when it was covered as the B-side of the million-selling US top 5 hit \"[[The Lord's Prayer (Sister Janet Mead song)|The Lord's Prayer]]\", by Australia's singing nun, [[Sister Janet Mead]].\n\nAfter a new deal with Epic, Donovan reunited with Mickie Most in early 1973, resulting in the LP ''Cosmic Wheels'', which featured arrangements by [[Chris Spedding]].<ref name=\"Lorne Murdoch 2005\"/> It was his last chart success, reaching the top 40 in America and Britain. Late in the year he released ''Essence To Essence'', produced by [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], and a live album recorded in Japan and only released in Japan, which featured an extended version of \"Hurdy Gurdy Man\" which included an additional verse written by [[George Harrison]] in [[Rishikesh]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Beatles As Musicians:Revolver through the Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CAvwZPKTkoC&pg=PA158 |accessdate=19 February 2013|isbn = 9780199880935|last1 = Everett|first1 = Walter|date = 31 March 1999}}</ref> While recording the album, [[Alice Cooper]] invited Donovan to share lead vocals on his song \"[[Billion Dollar Babies (Alice Cooper song)|Billion Dollar Babies]]\".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n''Cosmic Wheels'' was followed up by two albums that same year: his second concert album, ''[[Live in Japan: Spring Tour 1973]]'', and the more introspective ''[[Essence to Essence]]''. His last two albums for Epic Records were ''[[7-Tease]]'' (1974) and ''[[Slow Down World]]'' (1976). In 1977, he opened for [[Yes (band)|Yes]] on their six-month tour of North America and Europe following the release of ''[[Going for the One]]'' (1977). The 1978 LP, ''[[Donovan (album)|Donovan]]'' was on Most's [[RAK Records]] in the UK and on Clive Davis' new [[Arista Records]] in the US; it reunited him for the last time with Most and Cameron, but was not well received at the height of the [[New wave music|new wave]] and did not chart.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===1980s: occasional appearances===\nThe punk era (1976\u20131980) provoked a backlash in Britain against the optimism and whimsy of the hippie era, of which Donovan was a prime example. The word \"hippie\" became pejorative, and Donovan's fortunes suffered.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} In this period he released the albums ''Neutronica'' (1980), ''Love Is Only Feeling'' (1981), and ''Lady of the Stars'' (1984), and guest-starred on ''[[Stars on Ice]]'', a half-hour variety show on ice produced by [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] in Toronto. There was a respite when he appeared alongside [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Bob Geldof]], [[Eric Clapton]] and Jeff Beck in the [[Amnesty International]] benefit show ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]''.  Accompanied by [[Danny Thompson]], Donovan performed several hits including \"Sunshine Superman\", \"Mellow Yellow\", \"Colours\", \"Universal Soldier\" and \"Catch the Wind\". He was also in the performance of Dylan's \"[[I Shall Be Released]]\" for the show's finale. Donovan also appeared at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] on 18 June 1989 with the band [[Ozric Tentacles]] accompanying him onstage.\n\n===1990s: a retrospective decade===\nIn 1990 Donovan released a live album featuring new performances of his classic songs. A [[tribute album]] to Donovan, ''[[Island of Circles]]'', was released by [[Nettwerk]] in 1991. Sony's 2-CD boxed set ''[[Troubadour: The Definitive Collection 1964-1976|Troubadour: The Definitive Collection 1964\u20131976]]'' (1992) continued the restoration of his reputation, and was followed by the 1994 release of ''Four Donovan Originals'', which saw his four classic Epic LPs on CD in their original form for the first time in the UK. He found an ally in rap producer and [[Def Jam]] label owner [[Rick Rubin]] and recorded an album called ''[[Sutras (album)|Sutras]]'' for Rubin's [[American Recordings (record label)|American Recordings]] label.<ref name=\"classicbands\"/>\n\n===2000s===\n{{BLP sources section|date=September 2011}}\n[[File: Donovan -10Aug2007.jpg|thumb|Donovan before a show in [[Washington, D.C.]], on 10 August 2007.]]\nIn 2000, Donovan narrated and played himself in the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode [[The Deep South (Futurama)|\"The Deep South\"]] on 16 April with a parody of the song \"Atlantis\".\n\nA new album, ''[[Beat Cafe]]'', on Appleseed Records in 2004, marked a return to the jazzy sound of his 1960s recordings and featured bassist [[Danny Thompson]] and drummer [[Jim Keltner]], with production by John Chelew ([[Blind Boys of Alabama]]). At a series of ''Beat Cafe'' performances in New York, [[Richard Barone]] ([[The Bongos]]) joined Donovan to sing and read passages from [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s ''[[Howl]]''.\n\nIn May 2004, Donovan played \"Sunshine Superman\" at the wedding concert for the [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|Crown Prince]] and [[Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark|Crown Princess of Denmark]]. He released his early demo tapes, ''Sixty Four'', and a re-recording of the ''Brother Sun, Sister Moon'' soundtrack on [[iTunes]]. A set of his Mickie Most albums was released on 9 May 2005. This EMI set has extra tracks including another song recorded with the Jeff Beck Group. In 2005, his autobiography ''The Hurdy Gurdy Man'' was published. In May/June 2005, Donovan toured the UK (Beat Cafe Tour) and Europe with Tom Mansi on double bass, former [[The Damned (band)|Damned]] drummer [[Rat Scabies]] and [[Flipron]] keyboard player, Joe Atkinson.\n\nIn spring/summer 2006, Donovan played British festivals and two dates at Camden's [[The Jazz Caf\u00e9]], London.\n\nIn January 2007, Donovan played at the [[Kennedy Center]], in Washington, DC, at [[Alice Tully Hall]], in New York City, and at the [[Kodak Theatre]], in Los Angeles, in conjunction with a presentation by film maker [[David Lynch]] supporting the [[David Lynch Foundation]] for [[Transcendental Meditation in education|Consciousness-Based Education]] and world peace. The concert at the [[Kodak Theatre]] was filmed by [[Raven Productions]] and broadcast on [[Public television]] as a [[pledge drive]].

Donovan had other relationships \u2013 one of which resulted in the birth of his first two children, [[Donovan Leitch (actor)|Donovan Leitch]] and [[Ione Skye]], both of whom became actors.\n\n====Donovan and Dylan====\nDuring Bob Dylan's trip to the UK in the spring of 1965, the British music press were making comparisons of the two singer-songwriters and going so far as to stir up allegations of a rivalry, and other luminaries of the pop scene were chiming in. [[The Rolling Stones]] guitarist Brian Jones said,\n\n{{quote|We've been watching Donovan too. He isn't too bad a singer but his stuff sounds like Dylan's.

Pennebaker]]'s film ''[[Dont Look Back]]'' documenting Dylan's tour. Near the start of the film, Dylan opens a newspaper and exclaims, \"Donovan? Who is this Donovan?\" and his associates spur the rivalry on by telling Dylan that Donovan is a better guitar player, but that he had only been around for three months. Throughout the film Donovan's name is seen next to Dylan's on newspaper headlines and on posters in the background, and Dylan and his friends refer to him consistently.\n\nDonovan finally appears in the second half of the film, along with [[Derroll Adams]], in Dylan's suite at the [[Savoy Hotel]] despite Donovan's management refusing to allow journalists to be present, saying they did not want \"any stunt on the lines of the disciple meeting the messiah\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sabotage.demon.co.uk/donovan/art/1.htm#mm5/5/65 |title=Melody Maker |date=5 May 1965 |publisher=Sabotage.demon.co.uk |accessdate=18 May 2011}}</ref> According to Pennebaker, Dylan told him not to film the encounter, and Donovan played a song that sounded just like \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]\" but with different words. When confronted with lifting his tune, Donovan said that he thought it was an old folk song.<ref name=\"Marcus, 2011\">{{citation|last1=Marcus |first1=Greil |title=Greil Marcus interviews D.A.

Dylan later told ''[[Melody Maker]]'': \"He played some songs to me.&nbsp;... I like him.&nbsp;... He's a nice guy.\" ''Melody Maker'' noted that Dylan had mentioned Donovan in his song \"[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan|Talking World War Three Blues]]\" and that the crowd had jeered, to which Dylan had responded backstage: \"I didn't mean to put the guy down in my songs. I just did it for a joke, that's all.\"\n\nIn an interview for the BBC in 2001 to mark Dylan's 60th birthday, Donovan acknowledged Dylan as an influence early in his career while distancing himself from \"Dylan clone\" allegations:\n\n{{quote|The one who really taught us to play and learn all the traditional songs was [[Martin Carthy]] \u2013 who incidentally was contacted by Dylan when Bob first came to the UK. Bob was influenced, as all American folk artists are, by the [[Celtic music]] of Ireland, Scotland and England. But in 1962 we folk Brits were also being influenced by some folk Blues and the American folk-exponents of our Celtic Heritage&nbsp;... Dylan appeared after [[Woody Guthrie|Woody]] [Guthrie], [[Pete Seeger|Pete]] [Seeger] and [[Joan Baez|Joanie]] [Baez] had conquered our hearts, and he sounded like a cowboy at first but I knew where he got his stuff \u2013 it was Woody at first, then it was [[Jack Kerouac]] and the stream-of-consciousness poetry which moved him along. But when I heard '[[Blowin' in the Wind]]' it was the clarion call to the new generation \u2013 and we artists were encouraged to be as brave in writing our thoughts in music&nbsp;... We were not captured by his influence, we were encouraged to mimic him \u2013 and remember every British band from the [[Rolling Stones|Stones]] to the [[Beatles]] were copying note for note, lick for lick, all the American pop and blues artists \u2013 this is the way young artists learn. There's no shame in mimicking a hero or two \u2013 it flexes the creative muscles and tones the quality of our composition and technique.

Carr's conga style and McNair's flute playing are a feature of many recordings. Cameron, McNair and Carr also accompanied Donovan on several concert tours and can be heard on his 1968 live album ''[[Donovan in Concert (1968 album)|Donovan in Concert]]''.\n\n====''Sunshine Superman''====\nBy 1966, Donovan had shed the Dylan/Guthrie influences and become one of the first British pop musicians to adopt [[flower power]]. He immersed himself in jazz, [[blues]], [[Eastern world|Eastern]] music, and the new generation of [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]-era [[West Coast of the United States|US West Coast]] bands such as [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[the Grateful Dead]]. He was entering his most creative phase as a songwriter and recording artist, working with Mickie Most and with arranger, musician, and jazz fan [[John Cameron (musician)|John Cameron]]. Their first collaboration was \"[[Sunshine Superman]]\", one of the first [[psychedelic pop]] records.<ref name=\"classicbands\"/>\n\nDonovan's rise stalled in December 1965 when ''Billboard'' broke news of the impending production deal between Klein, Most, and Donovan, and then reported that Donovan was to sign with [[Epic Records]] in the US. Despite Kozak's denials, [[Pye Records]] dropped the single and a contract dispute ensued, because Pye had a US licensing arrangement with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. As a result, the UK release of the ''Sunshine Superman'' LP was delayed for months, robbing it of the impact it would have had. Another outcome was that the UK and US versions of this and later albums differed \u2013 three of his Epic LPs were not released in the UK, and ''Sunshine Superman'' was issued in a different form in each country. Several tracks on his late 1960s Epic (US) LPs were not released in the UK for many years. The legal dispute continued into early 1966. During the hiatus, Donovan holidayed in [[Greece]], where he wrote \"Writer in the Sun\",<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hit-channel.com/interview-donovan/68376 |title=Interview: Donovan |publisher=Hit-channel.com |date=20 June 2014 |accessdate=19 August 2015}}</ref> inspired by rumours that his recording career was over. He toured the US and appeared on episode 23 of [[Pete Seeger]]'s television show ''[[Rainbow Quest]]'' in 1966 with [[Shawn Phillips]] and [[Rev. Gary Davis]]. After his return to London, he developed his friendship with [[Paul McCartney]] and contributed the line \"sky of blue and sea of green\" to \"[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldies.about.com/od/thebeatlessongs/a/yellowsubmarine.htm|title=Robert Fontenot: \"Yellow Submarine: The history of this classic Beatles song\", About.com; retrieved 2 December 2008|publisher=Oldies.about.com|accessdate=18 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nBy spring 1966, the American contract problems had been resolved, and Donovan signed a $100,000 deal with Epic Records. Donovan and Most went to [[CBS Studio Building|CBS Studios]] in Los Angeles, where they recorded tracks for an LP, much composed during the preceding year. Although folk elements were prominent, the album showed increasing influence of jazz, American west coast psychedelia and [[folk rock]] \u2013 especially [[the Byrds]]. The LP sessions were completed in May, and \"[[Sunshine Superman]]\" was released in the US as a single in June. It was a success, selling 800,000 in six weeks and reaching No. 1. It went on to sell over one million, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Murrells |year=1978 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |edition=2nd |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/204 204] |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/204 }}</ref> The LP followed in August, preceded by orders of 250,000 copies, reached No. 11 on the US [[Billboard 200|album chart]] and sold over half a million.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/>\n\nThe US version of the ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]'' album is in [[chamber music|chamber]]-style folk-jazz arrangements, and features instruments including acoustic bass, [[sitar]], saxophone, tablas and congas, harpsichord, strings and oboe. Highlights include the swinging \"[[The Fat Angel]]\", which Donovan's book confirms was written for [[Cass Elliot]] of [[the Mamas & the Papas]]. The song is notable for naming the Jefferson Airplane before they became known internationally and before [[Grace Slick]] joined. Other tracks include \"Bert's Blues\" (a tribute to [[Bert Jansch]]), \"Guinevere\", and \"Legend of a Girl Child Linda\", a track featuring voice, acoustic guitar and a small orchestra for over six minutes.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Hurdy Gurdy Man |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PVsIp2DSuQMC&pg=PA164 |accessdate=19 February 2013|isbn = 9780099487036|author1 = Donovan|last2 = Leitch|first2 = Donovan|year = 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe album also features the [[sitar]], which was played by American folk-rock singer [[Shawn Phillips]]. Donovan met Phillips in London in 1965, and he became a friend and early collaborator, playing acoustic guitar and sitar on recordings including ''Sunshine Superman'' as well as accompanying Donovan at concerts and on Pete Seeger's TV show. Creatively, Phillips served as a silent partner in the gestation of many of Donovan's songs from the era, with the singer later acknowledging that Phillips primarily composed \"[[Season of the Witch (song)|Season of the Witch]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldminemag.com/article/follow-the-ever-changing-ballad-of-singer-songwriter-shawn-phillips |title=Follow the ever-changing ballad of Shawn Phillips |date=25 July 2012|publisher=}}</ref> Several songs including the title track had a harder edge. The driving, jazzy \"The Trip\", named after a Los Angeles club name, chronicled an [[LSD]] [[Psychedelic experience|trip]] during his time in L.A. and is loaded with references to his sojourn on the West Coast, and names Dylan and Baez. The third \"heavy\" song was \"Season of the Witch\".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Recorded with American and British session players, it features Donovan's first recorded performance on electric guitar. The song was covered by [[Julie Driscoll]], [[Brian Auger]] and the Trinity on their first LP in 1967, and [[Al Kooper]] and [[Stephen Stills]] recorded an 11-minute version on the 1968 album, ''[[Super Session]]''. Donovan's version is also in the closing sequence of the [[Gus Van Sant]] film, ''[[To Die For]]''. {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nBecause of earlier contractual problems, the UK version of ''Sunshine Superman'' LP was not released for another nine months. This was a compilation of tracks from the US albums ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]'' and ''[[Mellow Yellow (album)|Mellow Yellow]]''. Donovan did not choose the tracks.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n====Mellow Yellow====\n[[File:Royal Albert Hall, London - Nov 2012.jpg|thumb|Royal Albert Hall]]\nOn 24 October 1966, Epic released the single \"[[Mellow Yellow]]\", arranged by [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] and purportedly featuring [[Paul McCartney]] on backing vocals, but not in the chorus.<ref name=\"classicbands\"/> In his autobiography Donovan explained \"electrical banana\" was a reference to a \"yellow-coloured vibrator\".<ref>Donovan, ''Donovan in Concert'', released on Atlantic July 1968, re-issued on BGO February 2002.

In January he gave a concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] accompanied by a ballerina who danced during a 12-minute performance of \"Golden Apples\". On 14 January, [[NME|New Musical Express]] reported he was to write incidental music for a [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] production of ''[[As You Like It]]'', but this did not come to fruition. His version of \"[[Under the Greenwood Tree]]\" did appear on \"[[A Gift from a Flower to a Garden]]\".\n\nIn March Epic released the ''[[Mellow Yellow (album)|Mellow Yellow]]'' LP (not released in the UK), which reached No. 14 in the US album charts, plus a non-album single, \"[[Epistle to Dippy]]\", a Top 20 hit in the US. Written as an open letter to a school friend, the song had a pacifist message as well as psychedelic imagery. The real \"Dippy\" was in the [[British Army]] in Malaysia. According to Brian Hogg, who wrote the liner notes for the Donovan boxed set ''[[Troubadour: The Definitive Collection 1964\u20131976|Troubadour]]'', Dippy heard the song, contacted Donovan and left the army. On 9 February 1967, Donovan was among guests invited by the Beatles to Abbey Road Studios for the orchestral overdub for \"[[A Day in the Life]]\", the finale to ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Day in the Life:One Family, the Beautiful People, and the End of the Sixties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OfMWwVXsl0EC&pg=PT78 |accessdate=20 February 2013|isbn = 9780786748006|last1 = Greenfield|first1 = Robert|date = 17 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Arrest====\nIn mid-1966, Donovan became the first high-profile British pop star to be arrested for possession of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].<ref name=\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\"/> Donovan's drug use was mostly restricted to cannabis, with occasional use of [[LSD]] and [[mescaline]].{{fact|date=December 2019}} His LSD use is thought to be referenced indirectly in some of his lyrics.<ref name=\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\"/> Public attention was drawn to his marijuana use by the TV documentary ''A Boy Called Donovan'' in early 1966, which showed the singer and friends smoking cannabis at a party thrown by the film crew. Donovan's arrest proved to be the first in a long series involving the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. In early 1967, Donovan was subject of an expos\u00e9 in the ''[[News of the World]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pop Music and the Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=N-ViwZnnR3oC&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=donovan+1967+news+of+the+world#v=onepage&q=donovan%201967%20news%20of%20the%20world&f=false |accessdate=19 February 2013|isbn = 9781566399661|last1 = Jones|first1 = Steve|year = 2002}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Donovan, the article was based on an interview by an ex-girlfriend of his friend Gypsy Dave. The article was the first in a three-part series, ''Drugs & Pop Stars \u2013 Facts That Will Shock You.'' It was quickly shown some claims were false. A ''News of the World'' reporter claimed to have spent an evening with [[Mick Jagger]], who allegedly discussed his drug use and offered drugs to companions. He had mistaken Brian Jones for Jagger, and Jagger sued the newspaper for libel. Among other supposed revelations were claims that Donovan and stars including members of [[the Who]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], Rolling Stones and [[the Moody Blues]] regularly smoked marijuana, used other drugs, and held parties where the recently banned hallucinogen LSD was used, specifically naming the Who's [[Pete Townshend]] and Cream's [[Ginger Baker]].\n\nIt emerged later that the ''News of the World'' reporters were passing information to the police. In the late 1990s, ''The Guardian'' said ''News of the World'' reporters had alerted police to the party at [[Keith Richards]]'s home, which was raided on 12 February 1967. Although Donovan's was not as sensational as the later arrests of Jagger and Richards, he was refused entry to the US until late 1967. He could not appear at the [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey International Pop Festival]] in June that year.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Season of \"Season of the Witch\"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/05/season-of-the-witch.html|publisher=www.newyorker.com|accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1967\u201369: International success===\nIn July 1967, Epic released \"[[There Is a Mountain]]\", which just missed the US top ten and was later used as the basis for [[the Allman Brothers Band]]'s \"[[Mountain Jam]]\". In September, Donovan toured the US, backed by a jazz group and accompanied by his father, who introduced the show. Later that month, Epic released Donovan's fifth album, a set entitled, ''[[A Gift from a Flower to a Garden]]'', the first rock music box set and only the third pop-rock double album released. It was split into halves. The first, \"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\", was for people of his generation who would one day be parents; the second, \"[[For Little Ones]]\", was songs Donovan had written for coming generations. Worried it might be a poor seller, Epic boss [[Clive Davis]] also insisted the albums be split and sold separately in the US (the \"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\" album cover was photographed at [[Bodiam Castle]]), but his fears were unfounded \u2013 although it took time, the original boxed set sold steadily, eventually peaking at 19 in the US album chart and achieving gold record status in the US in early 1970.\n\nThe psychedelic and mystical overtones were unmistakable \u2013 the front cover featured an [[infrared photography|infra-red]] photograph by [[Karl Ferris]] showing Donovan in a robe holding flowers and peacock feathers, while the back photo showed him holding hands with Indian guru [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]. The liner notes included an appeal for young people to give up drugs. His disavowal of drugs came after his time with the Maharishi in [[Rishikesh]], a topic discussed in a two-part interview for the first two issues of ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Rolling Stone|title=Donovan: The Rolling Stone Interview|first=John|last=Carpenter|volume=1|issue=1,2|date=9\u201323 November 1967}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1967 Donovan contributed two songs to the [[Ken Loach]] film ''[[Poor Cow]]''. \"Be Not Too Hard\" was a musical setting of [[Christopher Logue]]'s poem ''September Song'', and was later recorded by such artists as [[Joan Baez]] and [[Shusha Guppy]]. The title track, originally entitled \"Poor Love\", was the B-side of his next single, \"[[Jennifer Juniper]]\", which was inspired by [[Jenny Boyd]], sister of [[George Harrison]]'s wife, [[Pattie Boyd]] and was another top 40 hit in the US. Donovan developed interest in eastern mysticism and claims to have interested the Beatles in [[transcendental meditation]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn early 1968 he was part of the group that traveled to the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in [[Rishikesh]]. The visit gained worldwide attention thanks to the presence of all four Beatles as well as [[Beach Boys]] lead singer [[Mike Love]], as well as actress [[Mia Farrow]] and her sister Prudence (who inspired Lennon to write \"[[Dear Prudence]]\"). According to a 1968 [[Paul McCartney]] interview with [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmbeatles.com/interviews.php?interview=66|title=Paul McCartney Interview: Promoting the White Album (20 November 1968)|publisher=Dmbeatles.com|accessdate=18 May 2011}}</ref> it was during this time that Donovan taught Lennon and McCartney [[fingerstyle guitar|finger-picking guitar]] styles including the [[clawhammer]], which he had learned from Mac MacLeod. Lennon used this technique on songs including \"[[Dear Prudence]]\", \"[[Julia (The Beatles song)|Julia]]\", \"[[Happiness is a Warm Gun]]\" and \"[[Look at Me (John Lennon song)|Look at Me]]\", and McCartney with \"[[Blackbird (Beatles song)|Blackbird]]\" and \"[[Mother Nature's Son]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Rolling Stone \u2013 Donovan on teaching guitar technique to the Beatles |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3tWkyYXcLc |website=You Tube |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\nDonovan's next single, in May 1968, was the psychedelic \"[[Hurdy Gurdy Man]]\". The liner notes from EMI's reissues say the song was intended for Mac MacLeod, who had a heavy rock band called [[Hurdy Gurdy (band)|Hurdy Gurdy]]. After hearing MacLeod's version, Donovan considered giving it to [[Jimi Hendrix]], but when Most heard it, he convinced Donovan to record it himself. Donovan tried to get Hendrix to play, but he was on tour.

The song became one of Donovan's biggest hits, making the Top 5 in the UK and the US, and the Top 10 in Australia.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn July 1968, Epic released ''[[Donovan in Concert (1968 album)|Donovan in Concert]]'', the recording of his Anaheim concert in September 1967. The cover featured only a painting by [[Fleur Cowles]] (with neither the artist's name nor the title). The album contained two of his big hits and songs which would have been new to the audience. The expanded double CD from 2006 contained \"Epistle To Derroll\", a tribute to one of his formative influences, [[Derroll Adams]]. The album also includes extended group arrangements of \"Young Girl Blues\" and \"The Pebble and the Man\", a song later reworked and retitled as \"Happiness Runs\". In the summer of 1968, Donovan worked on a second LP of children's songs, released in 1971 as the double album, ''[[HMS Donovan (album)|HMS Donovan]]''. In September, Epic released a single, \"[[Lal\u00e9na]]\", a subdued acoustic ballad which reached the low 30s in the US. The album ''[[The Hurdy Gurdy Man]]'' followed (not released in the UK), continuing the style of the ''[[Mellow Yellow (album)|Mellow Yellow]]'' LP and reached 20 in the US, despite containing two earlier hits, the title track and \"Jennifer Juniper\".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nAfter another US tour in the autumn he collaborated with Paul McCartney, who was producing ''[[Postcard (album)|Postcard]]'', the debut LP by Welsh singer [[Mary Hopkin]]. Hopkin covered three Donovan songs: \"Lord Of The Reedy River\", \"Happiness Runs\" and \"Voyage of the Moon\". McCartney returned the favour by playing tambourine and singing backing vocals on Donovan's next single, \"[[Atlantis (Donovan song)|Atlantis]]\", which was released in the UK (with \"I Love My Shirt\" as the B-side) in late November and reached 23.<ref name=ukcharts>{{cite web|title=Donovan|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/donovan/|publisher=officialcharts.com|accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nEarly in 1969, the comedy film ''[[If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium]]'' featured music by Donovan; the title tune was written by him and sung by J. P. Rags, and he also performed \"Lord of the Reedy River\" in the film as a singer at a youth hostel. On 20 January, Epic released the single, \"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\", with \"[[Atlantis (Donovan song)|Atlantis]]\" as the B-side. The A-side, a gentle [[Calypso music|calypso]]-styled song, contained another anti-war message, and became a moderate Top 40 US hit. However, when DJs in America and Australia flipped it and began playing \"Atlantis\", that became a hit. The gentle \"Atlantis\" formed the backdrop to a violent scene in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[GoodFellas]]''. \"Atlantis\" was revived in 2000 for an episode of ''[[Futurama]]'' titled \"The Deep South\" (2ACV12) which aired on 16 April that year. For this episode Donovan recorded a satirical version of the song describing the Lost City of [[Atlanta]] which featured in the episode.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn March 1969 (too soon to include \"Atlantis\"), Epic and Pye released ''Donovan's Greatest Hits'', which included four previous singles \u2013 \"Epistle To Dippy\", \"There is a Mountain\", \"Jennifer Juniper\" and \"Lal\u00e9na\", as well as rerecorded versions of \"[[Colours (Donovan song)|Colours]]\" and \"Catch The Wind\" (which had been unavailable to Epic because of Donovan's contractual problems) and stereo versions of \"Sunshine Superman\" (previously unissued full length version) and \"Season of the Witch\". It became the most successful album of his career; it reached 4 in the US, became a million-selling gold record, and stayed on the Billboard album chart for more than a year. On 26 June 1969 the track \"[[Barabajagal (single)|Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)]]\" (recorded May 1969), which gained him a following on the rave scene decades later, was released, reaching 12 in the UK but charting less strongly in the US. This time he was backed by the original [[Jeff Beck]] Group, featuring Beck on lead guitar, [[Ronnie Wood]] on bass, [[Nicky Hopkins]] on piano, and [[Micky Waller]] on drums. The Beck group was under contract to Most and it was Most's idea to team them with Donovan to bring a heavier sound to Donovan's work, while introducing a lyrical edge to Beck's.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nOn 7 July 1969, Donovan performed at the first show in the second season of free rock concerts in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London, which also featured [[Blind Faith]], [[Richie Havens]], [[the Edgar Broughton Band]] and the [[Third Ear Band]]. In September 1969, the \"Barabajagal\" album reached 23 in the US.

After the rift, Donovan spent two months writing and recording the album ''[[Open Road (Donovan album)|Open Road]]'' as a member of the rock trio Open Road. Stripping the sound of Most's heavy studio productions down to stuff that could be played by a live band, Donovan dubbed the sound, \"[[Celtic Rock]]\". The album peaked at No. 16 in the US, the third highest of any of his full-length releases to date, but as his concert appearances became less frequent and new artists and styles of popular music began to emerge, his commercial success began to decline. Donovan said:\n\n<blockquote>I was exhausted and looking for roots and new directions. I checked into Morgan Studios in London and stayed a long while creating Open Road and the ''HMS Donovan'' sessions. Downstairs was McCartney, doing his solo album. I had left Mickie after great years together. The new decade dawned and I had accomplished everything any young singer songwriter could achieve. What else was there to do but to experiment beyond the fame and into the new life, regardless of the result?<ref name=\"Lorne Murdoch 2005\"/></blockquote>\n\nDonovan's plan for Open Road was to tour the world for a year, beginning with a boat voyage around the [[Aegean Sea]], documented in the 1970 film, ''[[There is an Ocean]]''. This was partially on the advice from his management to go into [[tax exile]], during which he was not to set foot in the UK until April 1971, but after touring to France, Italy, Russia, and Japan, he cut the tour short:\n\n<blockquote>I travelled to Japan and was set to stay out of the UK for a year and earn the largest fees yet for a solo performer, and all tax-free. At the time the UK tax for us was 98%. During that Japanese tour I had a gentle breakdown, which made me decide to break the tax exile. Millions were at stake. My father, my agent they pleaded for me not to step onto the [[BOAC]] jet bound for London. I did and went back to my little cottage in the woods. Two days later a young woman came seeking a cottage to rent. It was Linda.<ref name=\"Lorne Murdoch 2005\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Reunions with Linda Lawrence and Mickie Most===\nAfter this reunion, Donovan and Linda married on 2 October 1970 at Windsor register office and honeymooned in the Caribbean. Donovan dropped out of the round of tour promotion and concentrated on writing, recording and his family. The largely self-produced children's album ''HMS Donovan'' in 1971, went unreleased in the US and did not gain a wide audience. During an 18-month tax exile in Ireland (1971\u201372), he wrote for the 1972 film ''[[The Pied Piper (1972 film)|The Pied Piper]]'' in the title role, and for ''[[Brother Sun, Sister Moon]]'' (1972). The title song from the Zeffirelli film provided Donovan with a publishing windfall in 1974 when it was covered as the B-side of the million-selling US top 5 hit \"[[The Lord's Prayer (Sister Janet Mead song)|The Lord's Prayer]]\", by Australia's singing nun, [[Sister Janet Mead]].\n\nAfter a new deal with Epic, Donovan reunited with Mickie Most in early 1973, resulting in the LP ''Cosmic Wheels'', which featured arrangements by [[Chris Spedding]].<ref name=\"Lorne Murdoch 2005\"/> It was his last chart success, reaching the top 40 in America and Britain. Late in the year he released ''Essence To Essence'', produced by [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], and a live album recorded in Japan and only released in Japan, which featured an extended version of \"Hurdy Gurdy Man\" which included an additional verse written by [[George Harrison]] in [[Rishikesh]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Beatles As Musicians:Revolver through the Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CAvwZPKTkoC&pg=PA158 |accessdate=19 February 2013|isbn = 9780199880935|last1 = Everett|first1 = Walter|date = 31 March 1999}}</ref> While recording the album, [[Alice Cooper]] invited Donovan to share lead vocals on his song \"[[Billion Dollar Babies (Alice Cooper song)|Billion Dollar Babies]]\".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n''Cosmic Wheels'' was followed up by two albums that same year: his second concert album, ''[[Live in Japan: Spring Tour 1973]]'', and the more introspective ''[[Essence to Essence]]''. His last two albums for Epic Records were ''[[7-Tease]]'' (1974) and ''[[Slow Down World]]'' (1976). In 1977, he opened for [[Yes (band)|Yes]] on their six-month tour of North America and Europe following the release of ''[[Going for the One]]'' (1977). The 1978 LP, ''[[Donovan (album)|Donovan]]'' was on Most's [[RAK Records]] in the UK and on Clive Davis' new [[Arista Records]] in the US; it reunited him for the last time with Most and Cameron, but was not well received at the height of the [[New wave music|new wave]] and did not chart.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===1980s: occasional appearances===\nThe punk era (1976\u20131980) provoked a backlash in Britain against the optimism and whimsy of the hippie era, of which Donovan was a prime example. The word \"hippie\" became pejorative, and Donovan's fortunes suffered.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} In this period he released the albums ''Neutronica'' (1980), ''Love Is Only Feeling'' (1981), and ''Lady of the Stars'' (1984), and guest-starred on ''[[Stars on Ice]]'', a half-hour variety show on ice produced by [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] in Toronto. There was a respite when he appeared alongside [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Bob Geldof]], [[Eric Clapton]] and Jeff Beck in the [[Amnesty International]] benefit show ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]''.  Accompanied by [[Danny Thompson]], Donovan performed several hits including \"Sunshine Superman\", \"Mellow Yellow\", \"Colours\", \"Universal Soldier\" and \"Catch the Wind\". He was also in the performance of Dylan's \"[[I Shall Be Released]]\" for the show's finale. Donovan also appeared at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] on 18 June 1989 with the band [[Ozric Tentacles]] accompanying him onstage.\n\n===1990s: a retrospective decade===\nIn 1990 Donovan released a live album featuring new performances of his classic songs. A [[tribute album]] to Donovan, ''[[Island of Circles]]'', was released by [[Nettwerk]] in 1991. Sony's 2-CD boxed set ''[[Troubadour: The Definitive Collection 1964-1976|Troubadour: The Definitive Collection 1964\u20131976]]'' (1992) continued the restoration of his reputation, and was followed by the 1994 release of ''Four Donovan Originals'', which saw his four classic Epic LPs on CD in their original form for the first time in the UK. He found an ally in rap producer and [[Def Jam]] label owner [[Rick Rubin]] and recorded an album called ''[[Sutras (album)|Sutras]]'' for Rubin's [[American Recordings (record label)|American Recordings]] label.<ref name=\"classicbands\"/>\n\n===2000s===\n{{BLP sources section|date=September 2011}}\n[[File: Donovan -10Aug2007.jpg|thumb|Donovan before a show in [[Washington, D.C.]], on 10 August 2007.]]\nIn 2000, Donovan narrated and played himself in the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode [[The Deep South (Futurama)|\"The Deep South\"]] on 16 April with a parody of the song \"Atlantis\".\n\nA new album, ''[[Beat Cafe]]'', on Appleseed Records in 2004, marked a return to the jazzy sound of his 1960s recordings and featured bassist [[Danny Thompson]] and drummer [[Jim Keltner]], with production by John Chelew ([[Blind Boys of Alabama]]). At a series of ''Beat Cafe'' performances in New York, [[Richard Barone]] ([[The Bongos]]) joined Donovan to sing and read passages from [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s ''[[Howl]]''.\n\nIn May 2004, Donovan played \"Sunshine Superman\" at the wedding concert for the [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|Crown Prince]] and [[Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark|Crown Princess of Denmark]]. He released his early demo tapes, ''Sixty Four'', and a re-recording of the ''Brother Sun, Sister Moon'' soundtrack on [[iTunes]]. A set of his Mickie Most albums was released on 9 May 2005. This EMI set has extra tracks including another song recorded with the Jeff Beck Group. In 2005, his autobiography ''The Hurdy Gurdy Man'' was published. In May/June 2005, Donovan toured the UK (Beat Cafe Tour) and Europe with Tom Mansi on double bass, former [[The Damned (band)|Damned]] drummer [[Rat Scabies]] and [[Flipron]] keyboard player, Joe Atkinson.\n\nIn spring/summer 2006, Donovan played British festivals and two dates at Camden's [[The Jazz Caf\u00e9]], London.\n\nIn January 2007, Donovan played at the [[Kennedy Center]], in Washington, DC, at [[Alice Tully Hall]], in New York City, and at the [[Kodak Theatre]], in Los Angeles, in conjunction with a presentation by film maker [[David Lynch]] supporting the [[David Lynch Foundation]] for [[Transcendental Meditation in education|Consciousness-Based Education]] and world peace. The concert at the [[Kodak Theatre]] was filmed by [[Raven Productions]] and broadcast on [[Public television]] as a [[pledge drive]]. Donovan's partnership with the David Lynch Foundation saw him performing concerts through October 2007, as well as giving presentations about Transcendental meditation. He appeared at [[Maharishi University of Management]] in [[Fairfield, Iowa]], in May 2007,<ref name=GGN0507>{{cite web|title=David Lynch Weekend draws crowds to Maharishi University of Management|url=http://www.pictures.globalgoodnews.com/archive/archive-2007/lynch-wkend/index.html|accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref> and toured the UK with David Lynch in October 2007.<ref name=Independent1007>{{cite news|last=Rajan|first=Amol|title=Bring peace to schools by meditation, say Lynch and Donovan|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/bring-peace-to-schools-by-meditation-say-lynch-and-donovan-395234.html|accessdate=30 December 2013|location=London|work=The Independent|date=24 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2007, Donovan played two shows at the [[SXSW|South by Southwest]] music festival in [[Austin, Texas]].

He said was in good health but gave no reason for the cancellation. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn April 2007, Donovan presented a three-part series on [[Ravi Shankar]] for [[BBC Radio 2]].

It is part of the [[Visalia Metropolitan Area|Visalia-Porterville metropolitan statistical area]].\n\nSince its incorporation in 1902, the city's population has grown as it annexed nearby unincorporated areas. The city's July 2018 population (not including [[East Porterville]]) was estimated at 59,988.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n\nPorterville serves as a gateway to [[Sequoia National Forest]], [[Giant Sequoia National Monument]] and [[Kings Canyon National Park]].\n\n==History==\nDuring California's Spanish period, the San Joaquin Valley was considered a remote region of little value. Emigrants skirted the eastern foothills in the vicinity of Porterville as early as 1826. Swamps stretched out into the Valley floor lush with tall rushes or \"tulare\" as the Indians called them.\n\nGold discovered in 1848 brought a tremendous migration to California, and prairie schooners rolled through Porterville between 1849 and 1852. Starting in 1854, Peter Goodhue operated a stopping place on the [[Stockton - Los Angeles Road]] on the bank of the [[Tule River]]. Wagon trains of gold seekers passed through the village, but other travelers found the land rich and remained to establish farms. A store was set up in 1856 to sell goods to miners and the Indians, who lived in tribal lands along the rivers. From 1858 to 1861 it was the location of the '''Tule River Station''' of the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]].\n\nRoyal Porter Putnam came to the village in 1860 to raise cattle, horses and hogs. He bought out Goodhue the same year and turned the station into a popular stopping place and hotel called Porter Station. He bought 40 acres of land and built a two-story store and a hotel on the highest point of the swampy property, which is now the corner of Oak and Main. The town of Porterville was founded there in 1864.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AYMPR6xAj50C&pg=PA90 Mildred Brooke Hoover, Douglas E. Kyle, Historic spots in California, Stanford University Press, 2002, p.543]</ref> It took its name from the founder's given name because another Putnam family lived south of town.\n\nIn 1862 {{Convert|20.8|inch|}} of rain fell in the area, causing a change of course of the Tule River. Putnam's acres drained and he had his property surveyed, staking out lot lines and establishing streets. Settlers were offered a free lot for every one purchased. The need of a burgeoning California population for food provided the impetus that led to the permanent development of the east side of the southern San Joaquin Valley. The long, dry, hot summer prompted irrigation of the lands.\n\nIn 1888 the Southern Pacific Railway brought in the branch line from Fresno. The Pioneer Hotel and Bank were built by businessmen from San Francisco. Porterville incorporated in 1902, as miners moved into the area to extract magnetite ore, and the Chamber of Commerce was formed in 1907. A City Manager-Council form of government was adopted in 1926 and a Charter was adopted. The city has grown from a community of 5,000 in 1920. Agriculture supplemented by the Central Valley Water Project has been the major source of economic growth in the area. The city is the center of a large farming area especially noted for citrus and livestock.\n\nIndustry has become a significant factor in the development of the community. The Wal-Mart Distribution Center, National Vitamin, Beckman Instruments, Standard Register, Sierra Pacific Apparel, Royalty Carpeting and other small companies have facilities in Porterville. Several large public facilities are also located here. These include the Porterville Developmental Center, Sequoia National Forest Headquarters, the Army Corps of Engineers Lake Success Facility and the Porterville College campus of the Kern Community College District.\n\n==The Tule River Indian War of 1856==\n{{Main|Tule River War}}\n\nThe Native Americans living in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains were relatively undisturbed by early Spanish colonization. During the late 1840s and into the 1850s, once gold was discovered in California, miners began encroaching on traditional lands. Although a treaty was signed with the local tribes in 1851, defining a proposed reservation and 200 head of cattle per year, the US Senate failed to ratify it, with every member either abstaining or voting no.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tuleriver.teknet.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/unratified-treaties-1851.pdf |title=The Un-ratified treaties of 1851 |last=Frank |first=Gelya |publisher=Tule River Tribe |accessdate=October 7, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012030924/http://tuleriver.teknet.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/unratified-treaties-1851.pdf |archivedate=October 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/32-1/s128 |title=ON ADOPTION OF THE RESOLUTION TO ADVISE AND CONSENT TO THE RATIFICATION OF EACH OF THE 18 TREATIES WITH THE INDIAN TRIBES OF CALIFORNIA.

Upon further investigation, it turned out that a single yearling calf had been taken as a bridal gift.<ref name=\"HistTulare\">{{cite book |last1=Menefee |first1=Eugene L |last2=Dodge |first2=Fred A |date=1913 |title=History of Tulare and Kings Counties California |url=https://archive.org/details/historyoftularek00mene |accessdate=October 7, 2014 }}</ref> Mobs of armed settlers were organized to counter the perceived menace, despite the peaceful intentions of the Native Americans. These mobs began raiding Native camps and killing their inhabitants.\n\nOne mob, under the leadership of Capt. Foster DeMasters, failed to dislodge a numerically superior Native encampment while wearing ineffective makeshift body armor consisting of cotton-padded jackets.<ref name=\"HistTulare\" /><ref name=\"TRWar\">{{cite journal |last=Gorenfeld |first=William |date=June 1999 |title=The Tule River War |url=http://www.historynet.com/the-tule-river-war.htm |journal=Wild West |accessdate=October 7, 2014 }}</ref> Reinforcements were sent in from Keyesville and the resulting force, now under the leadership of Sheriff W.G. Poindexter, were similarly repulsed. After falling back, the mob then proceeded to wage a scorched-earth campaign by destroying Native American supply caches.<ref name=\"HistTulare\" />\n\nNews of these engagements spread throughout California, exaggerating the degree of menace and misrepresenting its causes.<ref name=\"TRWar\" /> Finally, in May 1856 army troops under the command of LaRhett Livingston assaulted the encampment and succeeded in driving off its defenders. The war's duration was approximately six weeks.\n\nIn retrospect, George Stewart wrote, \"Thus ended the Tule River war of 1856; a war that might have been prevented had there been an honest desire on the part of the white settlers to do so, and one that brought little glory to those who participated therein. The responsibility cannot now be fixed where it properly belongs. Possibly the Indians were to blame. Certainly, the whites were not blameless, and it is too seldom, indeed, that they have been in the many struggles with the aboriginal inhabitants of this continent.\"<ref name=\"HistTulare\" />\n\nHistorian Annie Mitchell later wrote in the Tulare County Historical Society bulletin (Los Tulares No. 68, March 1966): \"Over the years it has been assumed that the Tule River War was a spontaneous, comic opera affair. It was not and if the Indians had been armed with guns instead of bows and a few pistols they would have run the white men out of the valley.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tuleriver.teknet.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/tule-river-indian-war-1856.pdf |title=The Tule River Indian War of 1856 |last=Frank |first=Gelya |publisher=Tule River Tribe |accessdate=October 7, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011234557/http://tuleriver.teknet.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/tule-river-indian-war-1856.pdf |archivedate=October 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nPorterville is located at {{coord|36|4|7|N|119|1|39|W|type:city}} (36.068550, -119.027536).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|17.7|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|17.6|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} of it (0.41%) is water.\n\nPorterville is located on the [[Tule River]] at the base of the western foothills of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and easternmost section of California's Central Valley. In the foothills above Porterville is the man-made [[Lake Success (California)|Lake Success]].\n\nPorterville, lying along the foothills of the Sierras at an elevation of {{Convert|455|feet|}}, is located on [[California State Route 65|State Highway 65]], {{Convert|165|mile|}} north of [[Los Angeles]], and {{Convert|171|mile|}} east of the Pacific Coast. The city has a strategic central location to major markets and a ready access to major transportation routes.\n\n===Geology===\nPorterville is subject to earthquakes due to its location within the Pacific Ring of Fire. The geologic instability involves numerous [[Fault (geology)|faults]], which cause many earthquakes every year, but most are of low intensity and are not felt. The primary plate boundary is the [[San Andreas Fault]], which was the source of the [[1857 Fort Tejon earthquake]]. Another major event that affected the Porterville area was the [[1952 Kern County earthquake|Kern County sequence of shocks]] that occurred on the [[White Wolf Fault]] during July and August 1952. Most parts of the city are also vulnerable to floods. The San Joaquin Valley and metropolitan areas are also at risk from [[blind thrust earthquake]]s.\n\n===Climate===\nPorterville gets almost {{Convert|13|inch|}} of rain per year.

The Porterville area and the rest of the [[San Joaquin Valley]] are susceptible to [[Inversion (meteorology)|atmospheric inversion]], which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, [[locomotive]]s, [[agriculture]], manufacturing and other sources. Unlike other cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Porterville gets only {{convert|13.00|in|mm|2}} of rain each year: pollution accumulates over many consecutive days. Issues of air quality in Porterville and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]. More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating [[low-emission vehicle]]s. Smog levels are only high during summers because it is dry and warm. In the winter, storms help to clear the smog and it is not as much of a problem. Smog should continue to drop in the coming years due to aggressive steps to reduce it, electric and hybrid cars and other pollution-reducing measures taken.<ref>[http://www.driveclean.ca.gov/en/gv/driveclean/bguides.asp Driveclean from the California Government web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807180655/http://www.driveclean.ca.gov/en/gv/driveclean/bguides.asp |date=August 7, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAs a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades. The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium.

Completed in fall 2013, the $93 million courthouse \u2014 which was built by Sundt Construction Inc. and designed by CO Architects \u2014 provides the necessary space for expansion and enhanced security, enabling the court to greatly improve access and services.\n\nThe facility features chambers, courtroom holdings, jury deliberations rooms, support services, clerks offices and work areas, public walk-up windows and queuing, holding and below-grade sally port. The approximately eight-acre site includes parking and circulation and a featured courtyard scheme.\n\nThe courthouse is designed to achieve a LEED Silver certification by the U.S. Green Building Council. The building includes high-performance glass, window-shading devices to prevent direct sunlight, and better-insulated walls and roof, and a [[rain screen]] system.\n\nIt has more energy-efficient mechanical units, which incorporate the partial use of chilled beam passive cooling and radiant heat. The lighting will be high-efficient fluorescent and LED fixtures.\n\nOther sustainable features include: low-use water fixtures and landscape, green roofs, recycling construction materials, the use of regional material and renewable materials as well as [[certified wood]] and natural light.\n\nThe center was funded under the Trial Court Facilities Act of 2002, made the state of California

It is part of the [[Visalia Metropolitan Area|Visalia-Porterville metropolitan statistical area]].\n\nSince its incorporation in 1902, the city's population has grown as it annexed nearby unincorporated areas. The city's July 2018 population (not including [[East Porterville]]) was estimated at 59,988.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n\nPorterville serves as a gateway to [[Sequoia National Forest]], [[Giant Sequoia National Monument]] and [[Kings Canyon National Park]].\n\n==History==\nDuring California's Spanish period, the San Joaquin Valley was considered a remote region of little value. Emigrants skirted the eastern foothills in the vicinity of Porterville as early as 1826. Swamps stretched out into the Valley floor lush with tall rushes or \"tulare\" as the Indians called them.\n\nGold discovered in 1848 brought a tremendous migration to California, and prairie schooners rolled through Porterville between 1849 and 1852. Starting in 1854, Peter Goodhue operated a stopping place on the [[Stockton - Los Angeles Road]] on the bank of the [[Tule River]]. Wagon trains of gold seekers passed through the village, but other travelers found the land rich and remained to establish farms. A store was set up in 1856 to sell goods to miners and the Indians, who lived in tribal lands along the rivers. From 1858 to 1861 it was the location of the '''Tule River Station''' of the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]].\n\nRoyal Porter Putnam came to the village in 1860 to raise cattle, horses and hogs. He bought out Goodhue the same year and turned the station into a popular stopping place and hotel called Porter Station. He bought 40 acres of land and built a two-story store and a hotel on the highest point of the swampy property, which is now the corner of Oak and Main. The town of Porterville was founded there in 1864.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AYMPR6xAj50C&pg=PA90 Mildred Brooke Hoover, Douglas E. Kyle, Historic spots in California, Stanford University Press, 2002, p.543]</ref> It took its name from the founder's given name because another Putnam family lived south of town.\n\nIn 1862 {{Convert|20.8|inch|}} of rain fell in the area, causing a change of course of the Tule River. Putnam's acres drained and he had his property surveyed, staking out lot lines and establishing streets. Settlers were offered a free lot for every one purchased. The need of a burgeoning California population for food provided the impetus that led to the permanent development of the east side of the southern San Joaquin Valley. The long, dry, hot summer prompted irrigation of the lands.\n\nIn 1888 the Southern Pacific Railway brought in the branch line from Fresno. The Pioneer Hotel and Bank were built by businessmen from San Francisco. Porterville incorporated in 1902, as miners moved into the area to extract magnetite ore, and the Chamber of Commerce was formed in 1907. A City Manager-Council form of government was adopted in 1926 and a Charter was adopted. The city has grown from a community of 5,000 in 1920. Agriculture supplemented by the Central Valley Water Project has been the major source of economic growth in the area. The city is the center of a large farming area especially noted for citrus and livestock.\n\nIndustry has become a significant factor in the development of the community. The Wal-Mart Distribution Center, National Vitamin, Beckman Instruments, Standard Register, Sierra Pacific Apparel, Royalty Carpeting and other small companies have facilities in Porterville. Several large public facilities are also located here. These include the Porterville Developmental Center, Sequoia National Forest Headquarters, the Army Corps of Engineers Lake Success Facility and the Porterville College campus of the Kern Community College District.\n\n==The Tule River Indian War of 1856==\n{{Main|Tule River War}}\n\nThe Native Americans living in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains were relatively undisturbed by early Spanish colonization. During the late 1840s and into the 1850s, once gold was discovered in California, miners began encroaching on traditional lands. Although a treaty was signed with the local tribes in 1851, defining a proposed reservation and 200 head of cattle per year, the US Senate failed to ratify it, with every member either abstaining or voting no.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tuleriver.teknet.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/unratified-treaties-1851.pdf |title=The Un-ratified treaties of 1851 |last=Frank |first=Gelya |publisher=Tule River Tribe |accessdate=October 7, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012030924/http://tuleriver.teknet.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/unratified-treaties-1851.pdf |archivedate=October 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/32-1/s128 |title=ON ADOPTION OF THE RESOLUTION TO ADVISE AND CONSENT TO THE RATIFICATION OF EACH OF THE 18 TREATIES WITH THE INDIAN TRIBES OF CALIFORNIA.

Upon further investigation, it turned out that a single yearling calf had been taken as a bridal gift.<ref name=\"HistTulare\">{{cite book |last1=Menefee |first1=Eugene L |last2=Dodge |first2=Fred A |date=1913 |title=History of Tulare and Kings Counties California |url=https://archive.org/details/historyoftularek00mene |accessdate=October 7, 2014 }}</ref> Mobs of armed settlers were organized to counter the perceived menace, despite the peaceful intentions of the Native Americans. These mobs began raiding Native camps and killing their inhabitants.\n\nOne mob, under the leadership of Capt. Foster DeMasters, failed to dislodge a numerically superior Native encampment while wearing ineffective makeshift body armor consisting of cotton-padded jackets.<ref name=\"HistTulare\" /><ref name=\"TRWar\">{{cite journal |last=Gorenfeld |first=William |date=June 1999 |title=The Tule River War |url=http://www.historynet.com/the-tule-river-war.htm |journal=Wild West |accessdate=October 7, 2014 }}</ref> Reinforcements were sent in from Keyesville and the resulting force, now under the leadership of Sheriff W.G. Poindexter, were similarly repulsed. After falling back, the mob then proceeded to wage a scorched-earth campaign by destroying Native American supply caches.<ref name=\"HistTulare\" />\n\nNews of these engagements spread throughout California, exaggerating the degree of menace and misrepresenting its causes.<ref name=\"TRWar\" /> Finally, in May 1856 army troops under the command of LaRhett Livingston assaulted the encampment and succeeded in driving off its defenders. The war's duration was approximately six weeks.\n\nIn retrospect, George Stewart wrote, \"Thus ended the Tule River war of 1856; a war that might have been prevented had there been an honest desire on the part of the white settlers to do so, and one that brought little glory to those who participated therein. The responsibility cannot now be fixed where it properly belongs. Possibly the Indians were to blame. Certainly, the whites were not blameless, and it is too seldom, indeed, that they have been in the many struggles with the aboriginal inhabitants of this continent.\"<ref name=\"HistTulare\" />\n\nHistorian Annie Mitchell later wrote in the Tulare County Historical Society bulletin (Los Tulares No. 68, March 1966): \"Over the years it has been assumed that the Tule River War was a spontaneous, comic opera affair.

In the foothills above Porterville is the man-made [[Lake Success (California)|Lake Success]].\n\nPorterville, lying along the foothills of the Sierras at an elevation of {{Convert|455|feet|}}, is located on [[California State Route 65|State Highway 65]], {{Convert|165|mile|}} north of [[Los Angeles]], and {{Convert|171|mile|}} east of the Pacific Coast. The city has a strategic central location to major markets and a ready access to major transportation routes.\n\n===Geology===\nPorterville is subject to earthquakes due to its location within the Pacific Ring of Fire. The geologic instability involves numerous [[Fault (geology)|faults]], which cause many earthquakes every year, but most are of low intensity and are not felt. The primary plate boundary is the [[San Andreas Fault]], which was the source of the [[1857 Fort Tejon earthquake]]. Another major event that affected the Porterville area was the [[1952 Kern County earthquake|Kern County sequence of shocks]] that occurred on the [[White Wolf Fault]] during July and August 1952. Most parts of the city are also vulnerable to floods. The San Joaquin Valley and metropolitan areas are also at risk from [[blind thrust earthquake]]s.\n\n===Climate===\nPorterville gets almost {{Convert|13|inch|}} of rain per year. The US average is {{Convert|37|inch|}}. Snowfall is {{Convert|0.01|inch|}}. The average US city gets {{Convert|25|inch|}} of snow per year. The number of days with any measurable precipitation is 46.\n\nOn average there are 271 sunny days per year in Porterville. The July high is around {{Convert|100.5|F|}}, the low around  {{Convert|35.6|F|}}. The comfort index, which is based on humidity during the hot months, is 54 out of 100, where higher is more comfortable.

The Porterville area and the rest of the [[San Joaquin Valley]] are susceptible to [[Inversion (meteorology)|atmospheric inversion]], which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, [[locomotive]]s, [[agriculture]], manufacturing and other sources. Unlike other cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Porterville gets only {{convert|13.00|in|mm|2}} of rain each year: pollution accumulates over many consecutive days. Issues of air quality in Porterville and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]. More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating [[low-emission vehicle]]s. Smog levels are only high during summers because it is dry and warm. In the winter storms help to clear the smog and it is not as much of a problem. Smog should continue to drop in the coming years due to aggressive steps to reduce it, electric and hybrid cars and other pollution-reducing measures taken.<ref>[http://www.driveclean.ca.gov/en/gv/driveclean/bguides.asp Driveclean from the California Government web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807180655/http://www.driveclean.ca.gov/en/gv/driveclean/bguides.asp |date=August 7, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAs a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades. The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium. Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the [[American Lung Association]] ranked the city as the 11th most polluted in the country, with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution.<ref name=\"shortTermPollutedCities\">[http://lungaction.org/reports/sota06_table2.html People at Risk In 25 U.S. Cities Most Polluted by Short-Term Particle Pollution.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122050859/http://lungaction.org/reports/sota06_table2.html |date=January 22, 2009 }} [[American Lung Association]].

Most of the nearby unincorporated area of East Porterville has run out of its supply of groundwater, an unfortunate consequence of the entire unincorporated area relying heavily on private wells.

Llewellyn Distinguished Service Professor of Jurisprudence in the Law School and Department of Political Science.\n\nSunstein was the Samuel Rubin Visiting Professor of Law at [[Columbia Law School]] in the fall of 1986 and a [[visiting professor]] at [[Harvard Law School]] in the spring 1987, winter 2005, and spring 2007 terms. He teaches courses in [[United States constitutional law|constitutional law]], [[administrative law]], and [[environmental law]], as well as the required first-year course \"Elements of the Law\", which is an introduction to legal reasoning, [[jurisprudence|legal theory]], and the interdisciplinary study of law, including [[law and economics]]. In the fall of 2008, he joined the faculty of Harvard Law School and began serving as the director of its Program on Risk Regulation:<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/2008/02/19_sunstein.php |title=HLS: News: Sunstein to join Harvard Law School faculty |publisher=Law.harvard.edu |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Program on Risk Regulation will focus on how law and policy deal with the central hazards of the 21st century. Anticipated areas of study include terrorism, climate change, occupational safety, infectious diseases, natural disasters, and other low-probability, high-consequence events. Sunstein plans to rely on significant student involvement in the work of this new program.<ref name=autogenerated1 /></blockquote>\n\nOn January 7, 2009, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that Sunstein would be named to head the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs|White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]] (OIRA).<ref>{{cite web|last=Weisman |first=Jonathan |last2=Bravin |first2=Jess |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123138051682263203 |title=Obama's Regulatory Czar Likely to Set a New Tone |work=Wall Street Journal |date=January 8, 2009 |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref> That news generated controversy among progressive legal scholars<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progressivereform.org/SunsteinOIRA.cfm |title=Choices for OIRA: Reinvigorating Protection of Health, Safety, and the Environment |publisher=Center for Progressive Reform |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref> and environmentalists.<ref>https://thinkprogress.org/how-anti-regulation-is-obamas-new-regulatory-czar-bb113a8eaf27/</ref>Sunstein's confirmation was long blocked because of controversy over allegations about his political and academic views.

The motion passed in a 63\u201335 vote. The Senate confirmed Sunstein on September 10, 2009 in a 57\u201340 vote.\n\nIn his research on risk regulation, Sunstein is known for developing, together with [[Timur Kuran]], the concept of [[availability cascade]]s, wherein popular discussion of an idea is self-feeding and causes individuals to over weigh its importance.\n\nSunstein's books include ''After the Rights Revolution'' (1990), ''The Partial Constitution'' (1993), ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'' (1993), ''Legal Reasoning and Political Conflict'' (1996), ''Free Markets and Social Justice'' (1997), ''One Case at a Time'' (1999), ''Risk and Reason'' (2002), ''Why Societies Need Dissent'' (2003), ''Laws of Fear: Beyond the Precautionary Principle'' (2005), ''Radicals in Robes: Why Extreme Right-Wing Courts Are Wrong for America'' (2005), ''Are Judges Political?

Sunstein's 2004 book, ''The Second Bill of Rights: FDR's Unfinished Revolution and Why We Need It More than Ever'', advocates the [[Second Bill of Rights]] proposed by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Among these rights are a right to an education, a right to a home, a right to health care, and a right to protection against monopolies; Sunstein argues that the Second Bill of Rights has had a large international impact and should be revived in the United States. His 2001 book, ''Republic.com'', argued that the [[Internet]] may weaken [[democracy]] because it allows citizens to isolate themselves within groups that share their own views and experiences, and thus cut themselves off from any information that might challenge their beliefs, a phenomenon known as [[cyberbalkanization]]. He recanted many of the views expressed in the book before his confirmation as administrator of the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]] in order to receive Senate confirmation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Asked by [[Rudy Takala]] if Sunstein's views nonetheless persisted in the Obama administration, [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] Commissioner [[Michael O'Rielly]] eluded the question, answering, \"Everybody needs a nudge, right?\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/rudy-takala/fcc-commissioner-speaks-out-against-federal-regulation-internet |title=FCC Commissioner Speaks Out Against Federal Regulation of Internet |work=CNSNews.com |date=January 21, 2015 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}</ref>\n\nSunstein co-authored ''[[Nudge (book)|Nudge]]: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness'' (Yale University Press, 2008) with economist [[Richard Thaler]] of the University of Chicago. ''Nudge'' discusses how public and private organizations can help people make better choices in their daily lives. Thaler and Sunstein argue that\n\n<blockquote>People often make poor choices \u2013 and look back at them with bafflement! We do this because as human beings, we all are susceptible to a wide array of routine biases that can lead to an equally wide array of embarrassing blunders in education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, happiness, and even the planet itself.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}</blockquote>\n\nThe ideas in the book proved popular with politicians such as U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] in general.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/aug/22/davidcameron.conservatives|title=Speak 'Nudge': The 10 key phrases from David Cameron's favourite book|author=Andrew Sparrow|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2008-08-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/article4330267.ece|title=Why Barack Obama and David Cameron are keen to 'nudge' you|work=[[The Times]] |author=Carol Lewis |date=2009-07-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|title=Nudge, nudge: meet the Cameroons' new guru|work=[[The Spectator]]|author=James Forsyth|date=2009-07-16|accessdate=2009-09-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124222449/http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|archivedate=2009-01-24|df=}}</ref> The \"Nudge\" idea has also been criticised.

He played an active role in opposing the [[impeachment of Bill Clinton]] in 1998.\n\nIn recent years, Sunstein has been a guest writer on ''[[The Volokh Conspiracy]]'' [[Weblog|blog]] as well as the blogs of law professors [[Lawrence Lessig]] ([[Harvard Law School|Harvard]]) and [[Jack Balkin]] ([[Yale Law School|Yale]]). He is considered so prolific a writer that in 2007, an article in the legal publication ''[[The Green Bag (1997)|The Green Bag]]'' coined the concept of a \"Sunstein number\" reflecting [[degrees of separation]] between various legal authors and Sunstein, paralleling the [[Erd\u0151s number]]s sometimes assigned to [[mathematician]] authors.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Edelman | first1 = Paul H. | last2 = George | first2 = Tracey E. | title = Six Degrees of Cass Sunstein | journal = The Green Bag | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 19\u201336 | url = http://www.greenbag.org/v11n1/v11n1_edelman_and_george.pdf | year = 2007}}</ref>\n\nHe is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (elected 1992) and the [[American Law Institute]] (since 1990).

Jolls]], to show how the theoretical assumptions of [[law and economics]] should be modified by new empirical findings about how people actually behave. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nAccording to Sunstein, the interpretation of federal law should be made not by judges but by the beliefs and commitments of the U.S. president and those around him.\n\"There is no reason to believe that in the face of statutory ambiguity, the meaning of federal law should be settled by the inclinations and predispositions of federal judges. The outcome should instead depend on the commitments and beliefs of the President and those who operate under him,\" argued Sunstein.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sunstein |first=Cass |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Beyond+Marbury%3a+the+executive%27s+power+to+say+what+the+law+is.-a0154908627 |title=Beyond Marbury: The Executive's Power To Say What the Law Is |publisher=The Yale Law Journal www.yalelawjournal.org/ |date=September 25, 2006 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}</ref>\n\nSunstein (along with his coauthor [[Richard Thaler]]) has elaborated the theory of [[libertarian paternalism]].  In arguing for this theory, he counsels thinkers/academics/politicians to embrace the findings of behavioral economics as applied to law, maintaining freedom of choice while also steering peoples' decisions in directions that will make their lives go better. With Thaler, he coined the term \"[[choice architecture|choice architect]].\"<ref name=Nudge />\n\n===Military commissions===\nIn 2002, at the height of controversy over Bush's creation of military commissions without Congressional approval, Sunstein stepped forward to insist, \"Under existing law, President George W. Bush has the legal authority to use military commissions\" and that \"President Bush's choice stands on firm legal ground.\" Sunstein scorned as \"ludicrous\" an argument from law professor [[George P. Fletcher]], who believed that the Supreme Court would find Bush's military commissions without any legal basis.<ref name=milcom>{{cite web|url=http://prospect.org/article/military-tribunal-debate|title=The Military Tribunal Debate|work=The American Prospect}}</ref> In 2006, the Supreme Court found the tribunals illegal in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' in a 5\u20133 vote.\n\n===First Amendment===\nIn his book ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'' Sunstein says there is a need to reformulate [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment law]]. He thinks that the current formulation, based on [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Justice Holmes']] conception of free speech as a marketplace \"disserves the aspirations of those who wrote America's founding document.\"<ref>Cass R. Sunstein, ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'', The Free Press, 1995, p. 119e</ref> The purpose of this reformulation would be to \"reinvigorate processes of democratic deliberation, by ensuring greater attention to public issues and greater diversity of views.\"<ref name=\"Cass R.

[[Saxby Chambliss]] (R-Ga.) blocked his appointment to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs by Obama. Chambliss objected to the introduction of ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=e7FME0btkH0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Animal+Rights:+Current+Debates+and+New+Directions&ei=RSCpSsOWJoO0zATBwfybCg#v=onepage&q=&f=false Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions]'', a volume edited by Sunstein and his then-companion Martha Nussbaum. On [https://books.google.com/books?id=e7FME0btkH0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Animal+Rights:+Current+Debates+and+New+Directions&ei=RSCpSsOWJoO0zATBwfybCg#v=snippet&q=bring%20suit&f=false page 11] of the introduction, during a philosophical discussion about whether animals should be thought of as owned by humans, Sunstein notes that personhood need not be conferred upon an animal in order to grant it various legal protections against abuse or cruelty, even including [[Standing (law)|legal standing]] for suit. For example, under current law, if someone saw their neighbor beating a dog, they cannot sue for animal cruelty because they do not have legal standing to do so. Sunstein suggests that granting standing to animals, actionable by other parties, could decrease animal cruelty by increasing the likelihood that animal abuse will be punished.\n\n=== Taxation ===\nSunstein has argued, \"We should celebrate tax day.\"<ref name=\"home.uchicago.edu\">http://home.uchicago.edu/~csunstei/celebrate.html, Accessed July 23, 2009</ref> Sunstein argues that since government (in the form of police, fire departments, insured banks, and courts) protects and preserves property and liberty, individuals should happily finance it with their tax dollars:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn what sense is the money in our pockets and bank accounts fully 'ours'? Did we earn it by our own autonomous efforts? Could we have inherited it without the assistance of probate courts? Do we save it without the support of bank regulators? Could we spend it if there were no public officials to coordinate the efforts and pool the resources of the community in which we live? Without taxes, there would be no liberty. Without taxes there would be no property. Without taxes, few of us would have any assets worth defending. [It is] a dim fiction that some people enjoy and exercise their rights without placing any burden whatsoever on the public\u2026 There is no liberty without dependency.<ref name=\"home.uchicago.edu\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nSunstein goes on to say:\n<blockquote>If government could not intervene effectively, none of the individual rights to which Americans have become accustomed could be reliably protected. [...] This is why the overused distinction between \"negative\" and \"positive\" rights makes little sense. Rights to private property, freedom of speech, immunity from police abuse, contractual liberty and free exercise of religion \u2013 just as much as rights to Social Security, Medicare and food stamps \u2013 are taxpayer-funded and government-managed social services designed to improve collective and individual well-being.<ref name=\"home.uchicago.edu\"/></blockquote>\n\n=== Marriage ===\nIn ''Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness'', Sunstein proposes that government recognition of marriage be discontinued. \"Under our proposal, the word marriage would no longer appear in any laws, and marriage licenses would no longer be offered or recognized by any level of government,\" argues Sunstein. He continues, \"the only legal status states would confer on couples would be a civil union, which would be a domestic partnership agreement between any two people.\" He goes on further, \"Governments would not be asked to endorse any particular relationships by conferring on them the term marriage,\" and refers to state-recognized marriage as an \"official license scheme.\"<ref name=Nudge>{{cite book |title=Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness |last=Thaler |first=Richard H. |authorlink= |author2=Sunstein, Cass R. |year=2008 |publisher=Caravan Books |isbn=978-0-300-12223-7 }}</ref>\nSunstein addressed the [[Senate of the United States|Senate]] on 11 July 1996 advising against the [[Defense of Marriage Act]].<ref name=Senate>{{cite web |title=The Defense of Marriage Act: hearing before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee |url=https://archive.org/stream/defenseofmarriag00unit#page/42/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Conspiracy Theories\" and government infiltration ===\nSunstein co-authored a 2008 paper with [[Adrian Vermeule]], titled \"Conspiracy Theories,\" dealing with the risks and possible government responses to conspiracy theories resulting from \"cascades\" of faulty information within groups that may ultimately lead to violence. In this article they wrote, \"The existence of both domestic and foreign conspiracy theories, we suggest, is no trivial matter, posing real risks to the government's antiterrorism policies, whatever the latter may be.\"  They go on to propose that, \"the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups\",<ref name=conspiracy>{{cite journal|ssrn=1084585 |title=Conspiracy Theories by Cass Sunstein, Adrian Vermeule  |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1084585 |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |year=2008  |last1=Sunstein  |first1=Cass R.  |last2=Vermeule  |first2=Adrian  }}</ref> where they suggest, among other tactics, \"Government agents (and their allies) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action.\"<ref name=conspiracy /> They refer, several times, to groups that promote the view that the US Government was responsible or complicit in the [[September 11 attacks]] as \"extremist groups.\"\n\nThe authors declare that there are five hypothetical responses a government can take toward conspiracy theories: \"We can readily imagine a series of possible responses. (1) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing. (2) Government might impose some kind of tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories. (3) Government might itself engage in counterspeech, marshaling arguments to discredit conspiracy theories. (4) Government might formally hire credible private parties to engage in counterspeech. (5) Government might engage in informal communication with such parties, encouraging them to help.\" However, the authors advocate that each \"instrument has a distinctive set of potential effects, or costs and benefits, and each will have a place under imaginable conditions. However, our main policy idea is that government should engage in cognitive infiltration of the groups that produce conspiracy theories, which involves a mix of (3), (4) and (5).\" \n\nSunstein and Vermeule also analyze the practice of recruiting \"nongovernmental officials\"; they suggest that \"government can supply these independent experts with information and perhaps prod them into action from behind the scenes,\" further warning that \"too close a connection will be self-defeating if it is exposed.\"<ref name=conspiracy /> Sunstein and Vermeule argue that the practice of enlisting non-government officials, \"might ensure that credible independent experts offer the rebuttal, rather than government officials themselves. There is a tradeoff between credibility and control, however. The price of credibility is that government cannot be seen to control the independent experts.\" This position has been criticized by some commentators<ref>[http://rawstory.com/2010/01/obama-staffer-infiltration-911-groups/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129231203/http://rawstory.com/2010/01/obama-staffer-infiltration-911-groups/ |date=January 29, 2016 }}</ref><ref>[http://stossel.blogs.foxbusiness.com/2010/01/18/stealth-propaganda/?test=latestnews] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121133714/http://stossel.blogs.foxbusiness.com/2010/01/18/stealth-propaganda/?test=latestnews |date=January 21, 2010 }}</ref> who argue that it would violate prohibitions on government propaganda aimed at domestic citizens.<ref>{{cite news|last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/01/15/sunstein/index.html |title=Obama confidant's spine-chilling proposal |work=Salon.com |date=January 15, 2010 |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref> Sunstein and Vermeule's proposed infiltrations have also been met by sharply critical scholarly critiques.<ref>David Ray Griffin, ''Cognitive Infiltration, An Obama Appointee's Plan To Undermine The 9/11 Conspiracy Theory''.

On February 28, 2020, nearly a month after the [[World Health Organization]] declared a global health emergency due to the [[Coronavirus pandemic]], Sunstein wrote for [[Bloomberg Opinion]] that \u201c[a] lot of people are more scared than they have any reason to be\u201d and that they have \u201can exaggerated sense of their own personal risk.\u201d He argued that \u201cmost people in North America and Europe do not need to worry much about the risk of contracting the disease.\u201d In his view, there was \u201cno adequate reason\u201d to change travel plans or other socioeconomic behaviors, since they risk \u201cplummeting stock prices.\u201d In the face of this, Sunstein urged calm and cautioned leaders to weigh the costs of merely potentially saving lives against the actual costs of falling prices in corporate equities. He blamed this tendency to view possibly saving lives as better than actually saving money on \"probability neglect,\" a term that he invented.\n\nA few weeks later Sunstein wrote in Bloomberg Opinion that \u201con the basis of current knowledge, extensive precautions, not ending soon, are amply justified by the most hard-headed forms of analysis that we have.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-28/coronavirus-panic-caused-by-probability-neglect|title=The Cognitive Bias That Makes Us Panic About Coronavirus|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-28/coronavirus-panic-caused-by-probability-neglect|title=This Time the Numbers Show We Can\u2019t Be Too Careful|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Star Wars ===\n\nIn 2016, Sunstein wrote of the [[Disney]] film franchise [[Star Wars]] that \"Star Wars is about freedom of choice and our never-ending ability to make the right decision when the chips are down,\" comparing the importance of the films to the [[Bible]], [[Santa Claus]], and [[Mickey Mouse]]. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Sunstein|first=Cass|title=The World According to Star Wars|publisher=Dey Street Books|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The publication was reviewed in ''Time'' magazine, where it was described as \"the ultimate primer for guiding a Star Wars padawan to the level of Jedi Knight.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Alex|url=https://time.com/4352086/cass-r-sunstein-the-world-according-to-star-wars/|title=This Book Will Help You Become the Ultimate Star Wars Fan|date=|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n\"Star Wars,\" he writes, \"is a grain of sand; it contains a whole world.\" This, he argues, is evident even if one \"can't tell an Ackbar from [...] a Snoke.\" As he develops his thesis, he takes this argument further, arguing that the \"hidden message and the real magic of Star Wars\" is \"its rousing tribute to human freedom.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sunstain |first1=Cass |title=The World According to Star Wars |date=2016 |publisher=Del Rey Books |page=Preface}}</ref> In an interview with the [[AV Club]], Sunstein stated that he felt \"over the moon about ''Star Wars''.\" The film franchise, in his view, \"casts light not just on the saga of our time, but also on everything about our culture,\" and includes many \"puzzles\" for the curious. Despite his overall positive view of Lucas' oeuvre and the impact of the franchise on society, Sunstein had some criticism for the prequel films, and likened that to society at large:\n\n:The sky is always falling or the sky is always bright. In some ways, this is really morning in America and we don\u2019t see it. People are living longer, the economy is doing pretty well. On the other hand, there are some ways of thinking in the current situation that make it look not so good, including our Star Wars prequels\n\nSunstein compared ''Star Wars'' to his work for the Obama administration, saying that his approach to regulatory reform was very similar to Lucas' constrained approach to the movies as \"episodes.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=McLevy |first1=Alex |title=Cass Sunstein explains why Star Wars is like America |url=https://film.avclub.com/cass-sunstein-explains-why-star-wars-is-like-america-1798248001 |publisher=AV Club |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref> \n\n==Personal life==\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, Sunstein was married to Lisa Ruddick, whom he met when both were undergraduates at Harvard.<ref>.https://books.google.com/books?id=m_mVWRPShyYC&pg=PR15&dq=cass+%22lisa+ruddick%22&hl=lt&sig=3rj5-V8-vIkWzjHp0FBqDgRchmY#PPR15,M1</ref> She is Associate Professor of English at the [[University of Chicago]], specializing in British modernism.<ref>.http://english.uchicago.edu/faculty/lisa-ruddick</ref> Their marriage ended in divorce.

He served as a [[law clerk]] first for Justice [[Benjamin Kaplan]] of the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] (1978\u20131979) and later for [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Thurgood Marshall]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] (1979\u20131980).<ref>[http://www.law.uchicago.edu/node/3552/cv Cass R.

In 1985, Sunstein was made a full professor of both political science and law; in 1988, he was named the [[Karl N. Llewellyn]] Professor of Jurisprudence in the Law School and Department of Political Science. The university honored him in 1993 with its \"distinguished service\" accolade, permanently changing his title to Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Service Professor of Jurisprudence in the Law School and Department of Political Science.\n\nSunstein was the Samuel Rubin Visiting Professor of Law at [[Columbia Law School]] in the fall of 1986 and a [[visiting professor]] at [[Harvard Law School]] in the spring 1987, winter 2005, and spring 2007 terms. He teaches courses in [[United States constitutional law|constitutional law]], [[administrative law]], and [[environmental law]], as well as the required first-year course \"Elements of the Law\", which is an introduction to legal reasoning, [[jurisprudence|legal theory]], and the interdisciplinary study of law, including [[law and economics]]. In the fall of 2008, he joined the faculty of Harvard Law School and began serving as the director of its Program on Risk Regulation:<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/2008/02/19_sunstein.php |title=HLS: News: Sunstein to join Harvard Law School faculty |publisher=Law.harvard.edu |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Program on Risk Regulation will focus on how law and policy deal with the central hazards of the 21st century. Anticipated areas of study include terrorism, climate change, occupational safety, infectious diseases, natural disasters, and other low-probability, high-consequence events. Sunstein plans to rely on significant student involvement in the work of this new program.<ref name=autogenerated1 /></blockquote>\n\nOn January 7, 2009, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that Sunstein would be named to head the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs|White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]] (OIRA).<ref>{{cite web|last=Weisman |first=Jonathan |last2=Bravin |first2=Jess |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123138051682263203 |title=Obama's Regulatory Czar Likely to Set a New Tone |work=Wall Street Journal |date=January 8, 2009 |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref> That news generated controversy among progressive legal scholars<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progressivereform.org/SunsteinOIRA.cfm |title=Choices for OIRA: Reinvigorating Protection of Health, Safety, and the Environment |publisher=Center for Progressive Reform |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref> and environmentalists.<ref>https://thinkprogress.org/how-anti-regulation-is-obamas-new-regulatory-czar-bb113a8eaf27/</ref>Sunstein's confirmation was long blocked because of controversy over allegations about his political and academic views.

The motion passed in a 63\u201335 vote. The Senate confirmed Sunstein on September 10, 2009 in a 57\u201340 vote.\n\nIn his research on risk regulation, Sunstein is known for developing, together with [[Timur Kuran]], the concept of [[availability cascade]]s, wherein popular discussion of an idea is self-feeding and causes individuals to over weigh its importance.\n\nSunstein's books include ''After the Rights Revolution'' (1990), ''The Partial Constitution'' (1993), ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'' (1993), ''Legal Reasoning and Political Conflict'' (1996), ''Free Markets and Social Justice'' (1997), ''One Case at a Time'' (1999), ''Risk and Reason'' (2002), ''Why Societies Need Dissent'' (2003), ''Laws of Fear: Beyond the Precautionary Principle'' (2005), ''Radicals in Robes: Why Extreme Right-Wing Courts Are Wrong for America'' (2005), ''Are Judges Political? An Empirical Analysis of the Federal Judiciary'' (2005), ''Infotopia: How Many Minds Produce Knowledge'' (2006), and, co-authored with [[Richard Thaler]], ''[[Nudge (book)|Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness]]'' (2008).\n\nSunstein's 2006 book, ''Infotopia: How Many Minds Produce Knowledge'', explores methods for aggregating information; it contains discussions of [[prediction market]]s, [[open-source software]], and [[wiki]]s. Sunstein's 2004 book, ''The Second Bill of Rights: FDR's Unfinished Revolution and Why We Need It More than Ever'', advocates the [[Second Bill of Rights]] proposed by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Among these rights are a right to an education, a right to a home, a right to health care, and a right to protection against monopolies; Sunstein argues that the Second Bill of Rights has had a large international impact and should be revived in the United States. His 2001 book, ''Republic.com'', argued that the [[Internet]] may weaken [[democracy]] because it allows citizens to isolate themselves within groups that share their own views and experiences, and thus cut themselves off from any information that might challenge their beliefs, a phenomenon known as [[cyberbalkanization]]. He recanted many of the views expressed in the book before his confirmation as administrator of the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]] in order to receive Senate confirmation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Asked by [[Rudy Takala]] if Sunstein's views nonetheless persisted in the Obama administration, [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] Commissioner [[Michael O'Rielly]] eluded the question, answering, \"Everybody needs a nudge, right?\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/rudy-takala/fcc-commissioner-speaks-out-against-federal-regulation-internet |title=FCC Commissioner Speaks Out Against Federal Regulation of Internet |work=CNSNews.com |date=January 21, 2015 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}</ref>\n\nSunstein co-authored ''[[Nudge (book)|Nudge]]: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness'' (Yale University Press, 2008) with economist [[Richard Thaler]] of the University of Chicago. ''Nudge'' discusses how public and private organizations can help people make better choices in their daily lives. Thaler and Sunstein argue that\n\n<blockquote>People often make poor choices \u2013 and look back at them with bafflement! We do this because as human beings, we all are susceptible to a wide array of routine biases that can lead to an equally wide array of embarrassing blunders in education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, happiness, and even the planet itself.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}</blockquote>\n\nThe ideas in the book proved popular with politicians such as U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] in general.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/aug/22/davidcameron.conservatives|title=Speak 'Nudge': The 10 key phrases from David Cameron's favourite book|author=Andrew Sparrow|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2008-08-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/article4330267.ece|title=Why Barack Obama and David Cameron are keen to 'nudge' you|work=[[The Times]] |author=Carol Lewis |date=2009-07-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|title=Nudge, nudge: meet the Cameroons' new guru|work=[[The Spectator]]|author=James Forsyth|date=2009-07-16|accessdate=2009-09-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124222449/http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|archivedate=2009-01-24|df=}}</ref> The \"Nudge\" idea has also been criticised. Dr Tammy Boyce, from public health foundation [[The King's Fund]], has said:\n<blockquote>We need to move away from short-term, politically motivated initiatives such as the 'nudging people' idea, which are not based on any good evidence and don't help people make long-term behavior changes.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/unhealthy-lifestyles-here-to-stay-in-spite-of-costly-campaigns-1055693.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Unhealthy lifestyles here to stay, in spite of costly campaigns | first=Nina | last=Lakhani | date=December 7, 2008 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nContributing to the anthology ''Our American Story'' (2019), Sunstein addressed the possibility of a shared American narrative. He cited the concepts of self-government and equal dignity of human beings, but focused in particular on stories: \"an emphasis on what happened before and after the firing shots in Concord and the courageous response of the embattled farmers maintains continuity with the historical facts and offers us something on which we can build.\"<ref>{{cite book |editor-last1=Claybourn |editor-first1=Joshua |editor-link1=Joshua Claybourn |title=Our American Story: The Search for a Shared National Narrative |date=2019 |publisher=Potomac Books |location=Lincoln, NE |isbn=978-1640121706 |pages=151\u2013159 }}</ref>\n\nSunstein is a contributing editor to ''[[The New Republic]]'' and ''[[The American Prospect]]'' and is a frequent witness before [[United States Congressional committee|congressional committees]]. He played an active role in opposing the [[impeachment of Bill Clinton]] in 1998.\n\nIn recent years, Sunstein has been a guest writer on ''[[The Volokh Conspiracy]]'' [[Weblog|blog]] as well as the blogs of law professors [[Lawrence Lessig]] ([[Harvard Law School|Harvard]]) and [[Jack Balkin]] ([[Yale Law School|Yale]]). He is considered so prolific a writer that in 2007, an article in the legal publication ''[[The Green Bag (1997)|The Green Bag]]'' coined the concept of a \"Sunstein number\" reflecting [[degrees of separation]] between various legal authors and Sunstein, paralleling the [[Erd\u0151s number]]s sometimes assigned to [[mathematician]] authors.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Edelman | first1 = Paul H. | last2 = George | first2 = Tracey E. | title = Six Degrees of Cass Sunstein | journal = The Green Bag | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 19\u201336 | url = http://www.greenbag.org/v11n1/v11n1_edelman_and_george.pdf | year = 2007}}</ref>\n\nHe is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (elected 1992) and the [[American Law Institute]] (since 1990).

Jolls]], to show how the theoretical assumptions of [[law and economics]] should be modified by new empirical findings about how people actually behave. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nAccording to Sunstein, the interpretation of federal law should be made not by judges but by the beliefs and commitments of the U.S. president and those around him.\n\"There is no reason to believe that in the face of statutory ambiguity, the meaning of federal law should be settled by the inclinations and predispositions of federal judges. The outcome should instead depend on the commitments and beliefs of the President and those who operate under him,\" argued Sunstein.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sunstein |first=Cass |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Beyond+Marbury%3a+the+executive%27s+power+to+say+what+the+law+is.-a0154908627 |title=Beyond Marbury: The Executive's Power To Say What the Law Is |publisher=The Yale Law Journal www.yalelawjournal.org/ |date=September 25, 2006 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}</ref>\n\nSunstein (along with his coauthor [[Richard Thaler]]) has elaborated the theory of [[libertarian paternalism]].  In arguing for this theory, he counsels thinkers/academics/politicians to embrace the findings of behavioral economics as applied to law, maintaining freedom of choice while also steering peoples' decisions in directions that will make their lives go better. With Thaler, he coined the term \"[[choice architecture|choice architect]].\"<ref name=Nudge />\n\n===Military commissions===\nIn 2002, at the height of controversy over Bush's creation of military commissions without Congressional approval, Sunstein stepped forward to insist, \"Under existing law, President George W. Bush has the legal authority to use military commissions\" and that \"President Bush's choice stands on firm legal ground.\" Sunstein scorned as \"ludicrous\" an argument from law professor [[George P. Fletcher]], who believed that the Supreme Court would find Bush's military commissions without any legal basis.<ref name=milcom>{{cite web|url=http://prospect.org/article/military-tribunal-debate|title=The Military Tribunal Debate|work=The American Prospect}}</ref> In 2006, the Supreme Court found the tribunals illegal in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' in a 5\u20133 vote.\n\n===First Amendment===\nIn his book ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'' Sunstein says there is a need to reformulate [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment law]]. He thinks that the current formulation, based on [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Justice Holmes']] conception of free speech as a marketplace \"disserves the aspirations of those who wrote America's founding document.\"<ref>Cass R. Sunstein, ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'', The Free Press, 1995, p. 119e</ref> The purpose of this reformulation would be to \"reinvigorate processes of democratic deliberation, by ensuring greater attention to public issues and greater diversity of views.\"<ref name=\"Cass R.

[[Saxby Chambliss]] (R-Ga.) blocked his appointment to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs by Obama. Chambliss objected to the introduction of ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=e7FME0btkH0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Animal+Rights:+Current+Debates+and+New+Directions&ei=RSCpSsOWJoO0zATBwfybCg#v=onepage&q=&f=false Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions]'', a volume edited by Sunstein and his then-companion Martha Nussbaum.

For example, under current law, if someone saw their neighbor beating a dog, they cannot sue for animal cruelty because they do not have legal standing to do so. Sunstein suggests that granting standing to animals, actionable by other parties, could decrease animal cruelty by increasing the likelihood that animal abuse will be punished.\n\n=== Taxation ===\nSunstein has argued, \"We should celebrate tax day.\"<ref name=\"home.uchicago.edu\">http://home.uchicago.edu/~csunstei/celebrate.html, Accessed July 23, 2009</ref> Sunstein argues that since government (in the form of police, fire departments, insured banks, and courts) protects and preserves property and liberty, individuals should happily finance it with their tax dollars:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn what sense is the money in our pockets and bank accounts fully 'ours'? Did we earn it by our own autonomous efforts? Could we have inherited it without the assistance of probate courts? Do we save it without the support of bank regulators? Could we spend it if there were no public officials to coordinate the efforts and pool the resources of the community in which we live? Without taxes, there would be no liberty. Without taxes there would be no property. Without taxes, few of us would have any assets worth defending. [It is] a dim fiction that some people enjoy and exercise their rights without placing any burden whatsoever on the public\u2026 There is no liberty without dependency.<ref name=\"home.uchicago.edu\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nSunstein goes on to say:\n<blockquote>If government could not intervene effectively, none of the individual rights to which Americans have become accustomed could be reliably protected. [...] This is why the overused distinction between \"negative\" and \"positive\" rights makes little sense. Rights to private property, freedom of speech, immunity from police abuse, contractual liberty and free exercise of religion \u2013 just as much as rights to Social Security, Medicare and food stamps \u2013 are taxpayer-funded and government-managed social services designed to improve collective and individual well-being.<ref name=\"home.uchicago.edu\"/></blockquote>\n\n=== Marriage ===\nIn ''Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness'', Sunstein proposes that government recognition of marriage be discontinued. \"Under our proposal, the word marriage would no longer appear in any laws, and marriage licenses would no longer be offered or recognized by any level of government,\" argues Sunstein. He continues, \"the only legal status states would confer on couples would be a civil union, which would be a domestic partnership agreement between any two people.\" He goes on further, \"Governments would not be asked to endorse any particular relationships by conferring on them the term marriage,\" and refers to state-recognized marriage as an \"official license scheme.\"<ref name=Nudge>{{cite book |title=Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness |last=Thaler |first=Richard H. |authorlink= |author2=Sunstein, Cass R. |year=2008 |publisher=Caravan Books |isbn=978-0-300-12223-7 }}</ref>\nSunstein addressed the [[Senate of the United States|Senate]] on 11 July 1996 advising against the [[Defense of Marriage Act]].<ref name=Senate>{{cite web |title=The Defense of Marriage Act: hearing before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee |url=https://archive.org/stream/defenseofmarriag00unit#page/42/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Conspiracy Theories\" and government infiltration ===\nSunstein co-authored a 2008 paper with [[Adrian Vermeule]], titled \"Conspiracy Theories,\" dealing with the risks and possible government responses to conspiracy theories resulting from \"cascades\" of faulty information within groups that may ultimately lead to violence. In this article they wrote, \"The existence of both domestic and foreign conspiracy theories, we suggest, is no trivial matter, posing real risks to the government's antiterrorism policies, whatever the latter may be.\"  They go on to propose that, \"the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups\",<ref name=conspiracy>{{cite journal|ssrn=1084585 |title=Conspiracy Theories by Cass Sunstein, Adrian Vermeule  |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1084585 |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |year=2008  |last1=Sunstein  |first1=Cass R.  |last2=Vermeule  |first2=Adrian  }}</ref> where they suggest, among other tactics, \"Government agents (and their allies) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action.\"<ref name=conspiracy /> They refer, several times, to groups that promote the view that the US Government was responsible or complicit in the [[September 11 attacks]] as \"extremist groups.\"\n\nThe authors declare that there are five hypothetical responses a government can take toward conspiracy theories: \"We can readily imagine a series of possible responses. (1) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing. (2) Government might impose some kind of tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories. (3) Government might itself engage in counterspeech, marshaling arguments to discredit conspiracy theories. (4) Government might formally hire credible private parties to engage in counterspeech. (5) Government might engage in informal communication with such parties, encouraging them to help.\" However, the authors advocate that each \"instrument has a distinctive set of potential effects, or costs and benefits, and each will have a place under imaginable conditions. However, our main policy idea is that government should engage in cognitive infiltration of the groups that produce conspiracy theories, which involves a mix of (3), (4) and (5).\"\n\nSunstein and Vermeule also analyze the practice of recruiting \"nongovernmental officials\"; they suggest that \"government can supply these independent experts with information and perhaps prod them into action from behind the scenes,\" further warning that \"too close a connection will be self-defeating if it is exposed.\"<ref name=conspiracy /> Sunstein and Vermeule argue that the practice of enlisting non-government officials, \"might ensure that credible independent experts offer the rebuttal, rather than government officials themselves. There is a tradeoff between credibility and control, however. The price of credibility is that government cannot be seen to control the independent experts.\" This position has been criticized by some commentators<ref>[http://rawstory.com/2010/01/obama-staffer-infiltration-911-groups/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129231203/http://rawstory.com/2010/01/obama-staffer-infiltration-911-groups/ |date=January 29, 2016 }}</ref><ref>[http://stossel.blogs.foxbusiness.com/2010/01/18/stealth-propaganda/?test=latestnews] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121133714/http://stossel.blogs.foxbusiness.com/2010/01/18/stealth-propaganda/?test=latestnews |date=January 21, 2010 }}</ref> who argue that it would violate prohibitions on government propaganda aimed at domestic citizens.<ref>{{cite news|last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/01/15/sunstein/index.html |title=Obama confidant's spine-chilling proposal |work=Salon.com |date=January 15, 2010 |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref> Sunstein and Vermeule's proposed infiltrations have also been met by sharply critical scholarly critiques.<ref>David Ray Griffin, ''Cognitive Infiltration, An Obama Appointee's Plan To Undermine The 9/11 Conspiracy Theory''.

On February 28, 2020, nearly a month after the [[World Health Organization]] declared a global health emergency due to the [[Coronavirus pandemic]], Sunstein wrote for [[Bloomberg Opinion]] that \u201c[a] lot of people are more scared than they have any reason to be\u201d and that they have \u201can exaggerated sense of their own personal risk.\u201d He argued that \u201cmost people in North America and Europe do not need to worry much about the risk of contracting the disease.\u201d In his view, there was \u201cno adequate reason\u201d to change travel plans or other socioeconomic behaviors, since they risk \u201cplummeting stock prices.\u201d In the face of this, Sunstein urged calm and cautioned leaders to weigh the costs of merely potentially saving lives against the actual costs of falling prices in corporate equities. He blamed this tendency to view possibly saving lives as better than actually saving money on \"probability neglect,\" a term that he invented.\n\nA few weeks later Sunstein wrote in Bloomberg Opinion that \u201con the basis of current knowledge, extensive precautions, not ending soon, are amply justified by the most hard-headed forms of analysis that we have.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-28/coronavirus-panic-caused-by-probability-neglect|title=The Cognitive Bias That Makes Us Panic About Coronavirus|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-28/coronavirus-panic-caused-by-probability-neglect|title=This Time the Numbers Show We Can\u2019t Be Too Careful|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Star Wars ===\n\nIn 2016, Sunstein wrote of the [[Disney]] film franchise [[Star Wars]] that \"Star Wars is about freedom of choice and our never-ending ability to make the right decision when the chips are down,\" comparing the importance of the films to the [[Bible]], [[Santa Claus]], and [[Mickey Mouse]]. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Sunstein|first=Cass|title=The World According to Star Wars|publisher=Dey Street Books|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The publication was reviewed in ''Time'' magazine, where it was described as \"the ultimate primer for guiding a Star Wars padawan to the level of Jedi Knight.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Alex|url=https://time.com/4352086/cass-r-sunstein-the-world-according-to-star-wars/|title=This Book Will Help You Become the Ultimate Star Wars Fan|date=|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n\"Star Wars,\" he writes, \"is a grain of sand; it contains a whole world.\" This, he argues, is evident even if one \"can't tell an Ackbar from [...] a Snoke.\" As he develops his thesis, he takes this argument further, arguing that the \"hidden message and the real magic of Star Wars\" is \"its rousing tribute to human freedom.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sunstain |first1=Cass |title=The World According to Star Wars |date=2016 |publisher=Del Rey Books |page=Preface}}</ref> In an interview with the [[AV Club]], Sunstein stated that he felt \"over the moon about ''Star Wars''.\" The film franchise, in his view, \"casts light not just on the saga of our time, but also on everything about our culture,\" and includes many \"puzzles\" for the curious. Despite his overall positive view of Lucas' oeuvre and the impact of the franchise on society, Sunstein had some criticism for the prequel films, and likened that to society at large:\n\n:The sky is always falling or the sky is always bright. In some ways, this is really morning in America and we don\u2019t see it. People are living longer, the economy is doing pretty well. On the other hand, there are some ways of thinking in the current situation that make it look not so good, including our Star Wars prequels\n\nSunstein compared ''Star Wars'' to his work for the Obama administration, saying that his approach to regulatory reform was very similar to Lucas' constrained approach to the movies as \"episodes.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=McLevy |first1=Alex |title=Cass Sunstein explains why Star Wars is like America |url=https://film.avclub.com/cass-sunstein-explains-why-star-wars-is-like-america-1798248001 |publisher=AV Club |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, Sunstein was married to Lisa Ruddick, whom he met when both were undergraduates at Harvard.<ref>.https://books.google.com/books?id=m_mVWRPShyYC&pg=PR15&dq=cass+%22lisa+ruddick%22&hl=lt&sig=3rj5-V8-vIkWzjHp0FBqDgRchmY#PPR15,M1</ref> She is Associate Professor of English at the [[University of Chicago]], specializing in British modernism.<ref>.http://english.uchicago.edu/faculty/lisa-ruddick</ref> Their marriage ended in divorce.

It will be the 59th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. Voters will select [[United States Electoral College|presidential electors]] who in turn will vote on December 14, 2020,<ref name=\"Nu5tF\" /> to either elect a new [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] or reelect the incumbents [[Donald Trump]] and [[Mike Pence]] respectively. The series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] are being held from February to June 2020. This nominating process is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]], who then in turn elect their party's nominees for president and vice president.\n\n[[Donald Trump]], the 45th and incumbent president, has launched a reelection campaign for the Republican primaries; several state Republican Party organizations have cancelled their primaries in a show of support for his candidacy.<ref name=\"6KjVJ\" /> Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee on March 17, 2020 after securing a majority of pledged delegates.<ref name=\"EHTx4\" /> 29 major candidates launched [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|campaigns for the Democratic nomination]], which became the largest field of candidates for any political party in the post-[[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reform]] period of American politics. Former Vice President [[Joe Biden]] became the presumptive Democratic nominee when Senator [[Bernie Sanders]], his last major primary opponent, suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020. The winner of the 2020 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021.\n\nBiden, if nominated, would become the oldest major party nominees in U.S. history,{{efn|[[Ronald Reagan]], currently the oldest major party nominee to contest a presidential general election, was 73 when [[1984 United States presidential election|re-elected in 1984]], whereas on Election Day in 2020 Biden will be 77 and Trump will be 74.}} and, if elected and inaugurated, would become the oldest serving president.{{efn|On Inauguration Day in 2021 Biden will be 78 years, 62 days old which is [[List of presidents of the United States by age|79 days older]] than [[Ronald Reagan]] was when he left office in 1989. Other than inaugural President [[George Washington]], no person has ever become the oldest serving President upon assuming office.}} The [[2020 Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection|2020 Democratic Party vice presidential nominee]] is set to be the [[List of female United States presidential and vice-presidential candidates|third female major party vice presidential nominee]] in United States history, following Democrat [[Geraldine Ferraro]] in [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]] and Republican [[Sarah Palin]] in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] as presumptive Democratic nominee Biden has fully committed to selecting a female running mate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Who-will-be-Biden-VP-Here-are-the-odds-15187102.php|title=Who will be Joe Biden's VP pick? Here are the odds.|last=Chamings|first=Andrew|date=April 8, 2020|website=[[SFGate]]|language=en|access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n===Procedure===\n{{further|United States presidential election#Procedure}}\n\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states that for a person to serve as president the individual must be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen of the United States]], at least 35 years old and a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]. On March 10, following primary elections in six states, Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled planned campaign night events and further in-person campaigning and campaign rallies.<ref name=\"JAb2o\" /><ref name=\"t9U5e\" /> On March 12, President Trump also stated his intent to postpone further campaign rallies.<ref name=\"NM4Ve\" /> The 11th Democratic debate was held on March 15 without an audience at the [[CNN]] studios in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"iUhTN\" /> Several states have also postponed their primaries to a later date, including Georgia,<ref name=\"2rHUH\" /> Kentucky,<ref name=\"BOyPg\" /> Louisiana,<ref name=\"9Jz7W\" /> Ohio,<ref name=\"YrwnH\" /> and Maryland.<ref name=\"slHNd\" /> As of March 24, 2020, all major-party presidential candidates have halted in-person campaigning and campaign rallies over coronavirus concerns. Political analysts have stated that the moratorium on traditional campaigning coupled to the effects of the pandemic on the nation could have unpredictable effects on the voting populace and possibly, how the election will be conducted.<ref name=\"sXzhh\" /><ref name=\"u1jgH\" /><ref name=\"w7xk5\" />\n\nThe [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act]] included money for states to increase mail-in voting.<ref name=\"NQGai\" />\n\nGovernment response to the impact of the pandemic from the Trump administration, coupled to the differing positions taken by congressional Democrats and Republicans regarding [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act|economic stimulus]] remains a major campaign issue for both parties.<ref name=\"kLGv5\" /><ref name=\"jAPgE\" />\n\n==Nominations==\n===Republican Party nomination===\n{{main|2020 Republican Party presidential primaries}}\n====Primaries====\nIn election cycles with incumbent presidents running for re-election, the race for their party nomination are usually ''pro-forma'', with token opposition instead of any serious challengers and with their party rules being fixed in their favor.<ref name=\"B1TfP\" /><ref name=\"politico20190506\" /> The 2020 election is no exception; with Donald Trump formally seeking a second term,<ref name=\"DFAz3\" /><ref name=\"VkToz\" /> the official Republican apparatus, both state and national, have coordinated with his campaign to implement changes to make it difficult for any primary opponent to mount a serious challenge.<ref name=\"ct7mA\" /><ref name=\"Rbspl\" /> On January 25, 2019, the [[Republican National Committee]] unofficially endorsed Trump.<ref name=\"u5OTG\" />\n\nSeveral Republican state committees have scrapped their respective primaries or caucuses.<ref name=\"politico20190906\" /> They have cited the fact that Republicans canceled several state primaries when [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]] sought a second term in [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries|1992]] and [[2004 Republican Party presidential primaries|2004]], respectively; and Democrats scrapped some of their primaries when [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] were seeking reelection in [[1996 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1996]] and [[2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2012]], respectively.<ref name=\"YYpWu\" /><ref name=\"b3RX8\" /> After cancelling their races, some of those states like Hawaii and New York immediately binded their delegates to Trump,<ref name=\"DzEs1\" /><ref name=\"0zsgw\" /> while other such states like Kansas and Nevada later formally held a convention or meeting to officially award their delegates to him.<ref name=\"cw1Ms\" /><ref name=\"vHq4G\" />\n\nIn addition, the Trump campaign urged Republican state committees that used proportional methods to award delegates in 2016 (where a state's delegates are basically divided proportionally among the candidates based on the vote percentage) to switch to a \"[[Plurality voting|winner-takes-all]]\" (where the winning candidate in a state gets all its delegates) or \"winner-takes-most\" (where the winning candidate only wins all of the state's delegates if he exceeds a predetermined amount, otherwise they are divided proportionally) for 2020.<ref name=\"politico20190506\" /><ref name=\"AP20190920\" />\n\nNevertheless, reports arose beginning in August 2017 that members of the Republican Party were preparing a \"shadow campaign\" against the President, particularly from the moderate or establishment wings of the party. Then-[[Arizona]] senator [[John McCain]] said, \"Republicans see weakness in this president.\"<ref name=\"wjjR6\" /><ref name=\"yDOhp\" /> [[Maine]] senator [[Susan Collins]], [[Kentucky]] senator [[Rand Paul]], and former [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] all expressed doubts in 2017 that Trump would be the 2020 nominee, with Collins stating \"it's too difficult to say.\"<ref name=\"C9L6O\" /><ref name=\"f20FO\" /> Senator [[Jeff Flake]] claimed in 2017 that Trump was \"inviting\" a primary challenger by the way he was governing.<ref name=\"Ogmqz\" /> Longtime political strategist [[Roger Stone]], however, predicted in May 2018 that Trump might not seek a second term were he to succeed in keeping all his campaign promises and \"mak[ing] America great again\".<ref name=\"GxyXS\" />\n\nFormer Massachusetts governor [[Bill Weld]] then became Trump's first major challenger in the Republican primaries following an announcement on April 15, 2019.<ref name=\"1Ad6f\" /> Weld, who was the Libertarian Party's nominee for vice president in 2016, is considered a long shot because his [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] views on several political positions such as abortion rights, gay marriage and marijuana legalization conflict with traditionalist [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] positions.<ref name=\"oioUK\" />\n\nIn addition, businessman [[Rocky De La Fuente]] entered the race on May 16, 2019, but was not widely recognized as a major candidate.\n\nFormer Illinois [[Illinois's 8th congressional district|representative]] [[Joe Walsh (American politician)|Joe Walsh]] launched a primary challenge on August 25, 2019, saying, \"I'm going to do whatever I can. I don't want [Trump] to win. The country cannot afford to have him win. If I'm not successful, I'm not voting for him.\"<ref name=\"6L2x8\" /> Walsh ended his presidential bid on February 7, 2020, after drawing around 1% support in the Iowa caucuses. Walsh declared that \"nobody can beat Trump in a Republican primary\" because the Republican Party was now \"a cult\" of Trump. According to Walsh, Trump supporters had become \"followers\" who think that Trump \"can do no wrong\", after absorbing misinformation \"from 'conservative' media. They don't know what the truth is and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 they don't care.\"<ref name=\"iWwLJ\" />\n\nOn September 8, 2019, former South Carolina governor and representative [[Mark Sanford]] officially announced that he would be another Republican primary challenger to Trump.<ref name=\"NYTimesSanford\" /> He dropped out of the race 65 days later on November 12, 2019, after failing to gain support in Republican circles.<ref name=\"JE5vC\" />\n\nStill, [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|Donald Trump's re-election campaign]] has essentially been ongoing since his victory in 2016, leading pundits to describe his tactic of holding rallies continuously throughout his presidency as a \"never-ending campaign\".<ref name=\"kn3IR\" /> On January 20, 2017, at 5:11&nbsp;p.m., he submitted a letter as a substitute of FEC Form 2, by which he reached the legal threshold for filing, in compliance with the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]].<ref name=\"0ergM\" /> Trump has run an active campaign during the primary season, even holding rallies in the February primary states, including South Carolina and Nevada where those Republican races were canceled.<ref name=\"vckt4\" /><ref name=\"y1IrS\" />\n\nThrough Super Tuesday, March 3, Trump won every race. Including those states who have canceled their races and have awarded their delegates to him, Trump through Super Tuesday won an estimated 1,023 of the 1,276 required to officially become the presumptive Republican Party nominee.<ref name=\"RifKC\" /> After the March 10 primaries, he was a mere 11 delegates shy of clinching, which he did the following week. As of March 21, he has received 11,446,331 popular votes. \n\nOn March 17, 2020, having won every state and every delegate but one, Trump became the presumptive nominee.<ref name=\"u9rZ3\" /> Weld suspended his campaign the next day.<ref name=\"HCjk9\" />\n\n====Presumptive nominee==== \n{{Donald Trump series |expanded=Campaigns}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n\n| colspan=\"28\" style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" |\n\n[[File:Republican Disc.png|65px|center|link=Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party (United States)]]<big>'''Presumptive 2020 Republican Party ticket\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:200px;\"|{{colored link|white|Donald Trump}}\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:200px;\"|{{colored link|white|Mike Pence}}\n|- style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:#ffd0d7;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for President'''''\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for Vice President'''''\n|-\n| [[File:Official Portrait of President Donald Trump.jpg|center|200x200px|border]]<!-- DO NOT CHANGE WITHOUT PRIOR CONSENSUS.

This would require a candidate to win a majority of pledged delegates from the assorted primary elections in order to win the party's nomination. The last time this did not occur was the nomination of [[Adlai Stevenson II]] at the [[1952 Democratic National Convention]].<ref name=\"ssKcA\" /> Meanwhile, six states will use [[Ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] in the primaries: Alaska, Hawaii, Kansas, and Wyoming for all voters; and Iowa and Nevada for absentee voters.<ref name=\"7VCs8\" />\n\nAfter [[Hillary Clinton]]'s loss in the [[2016 United States presidential election|previous]] election, the Democratic Party was seen largely as leaderless<ref name=\"BGA13\" /> and fractured between the [[centrist]] Clinton wing and the more [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[Bernie Sanders|Sanders]] wing of the party, echoing the rift brought up in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 primary]] election.<ref name=\"YGlMQ\" /><ref name=\"le0En\" />\n\nThis divide between the establishment and progressive wings of the party has been reflected in several elections leading up to the 2020 primaries, most notably in 2017 with the election for [[Democratic National Committee chairmanship election, 2017|DNC chair]] between moderate-backed [[Tom Perez]] and progressive-backed [[Keith Ellison]]:<ref name=\"rrgRf\" /> Perez was elected chairman, and Ellison was appointed the [[Deputy Chair of the Democratic National Committee|deputy chair]], a largely ceremonial role. In 2018, several [[U.S. House]] districts that Democrats hoped to gain from the Republican majority had contentious primary elections. These clashes were described by ''[[Politico]]''{{'}}s Elena Schneider as a \"Democratic civil war\".<ref name=\"rlKMJ\" /> Meanwhile, there has been a general shift to the left in regards to college tuition, healthcare, and immigration among Democrats in the Senate, likely to build up credentials for the upcoming primary election.<ref name=\"gTbzW\" /><ref name=\"C7O7F\" />\n\nOverall, the 2020 primary field had 29 major candidates,<ref name=\"fkBz3\" /> breaking the record for the largest field under the modern presidential primary system previously set during the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 GOP primaries]] with 17 major candidates.<ref name=\"politifact2019\" /> Several female candidates entered the race, increasing the likelihood of the Democrats nominating a woman for the second time in a row.<ref name=\"IuwYR\" />\n\nEntering the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses|Iowa caucuses]] on February 3, 2020, however, the field had decreased to 11 major candidates. [[Pete Buttigieg]] narrowly defeated [[Bernie Sanders]] in Iowa, then Sanders edged Buttigieg in the February 11 [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire primary]]. Following [[Michael Bennet]], [[Deval Patrick]], and [[Andrew Yang]] dropping out, Sanders won the [[2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses|Nevada caucuses]] on February 22. [[Joe Biden]] then won the [[2020 South Carolina Democratic primary|South Carolina primary]], causing Buttigieg, [[Amy Klobuchar]], and [[Tom Steyer]] to abandon their campaigns (Buttigieg and Klobuchar then immediately endorsed Biden). After [[Super Tuesday]], March 3, [[Michael Bloomberg]] and [[Elizabeth Warren]] quit the race, leaving three candidates left: Biden and Sanders, the main contenders, and [[Tulsi Gabbard]], who remained in the race despite facing nigh-on insurmountable odds.<ref name=\"cw3Ne\" /> Gabbard then dropped out and endorsed Biden after the March 17 [[2020 Arizona Democratic primary|Arizona]], [[2020 Florida Democratic primary|Florida]], and [[2020 Illinois Democratic primary|Illinois]] races.<ref name=\"2vZj6\" /> On April 8, 2020, Sanders dropped out, leaving Biden as the only major

It will be the 59th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. Voters will select [[United States Electoral College|presidential electors]] who in turn will vote on December 14, 2020,<ref name=\"Nu5tF\" /> to either elect a new [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] or reelect the incumbents [[Donald Trump]] and [[Mike Pence]] respectively. The series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] are being held from February to June 2020. This nominating process is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]], who then in turn elect their party's nominees for president and vice president.\n\n[[Donald Trump]], the 45th and incumbent president, has launched a reelection campaign for the Republican primaries; several state Republican Party organizations have cancelled their primaries in a show of support for his candidacy.<ref name=\"6KjVJ\" /> Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee on March 17, 2020 after securing a majority of pledged delegates.<ref name=\"EHTx4\" /> 29 major candidates launched [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|campaigns for the Democratic nomination]], which became the largest field of candidates for any political party in the post-[[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reform]] period of American politics. Former Vice President [[Joe Biden]] became the presumptive Democratic nominee when U.S. Senator from Vermont [[Bernie Sanders]], his last major primary opponent, suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020. The winner of the 2020 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021.\n\nBiden, if nominated, would become the oldest major party nominees in U.S. history,{{efn|[[Ronald Reagan]], currently the oldest major party nominee to contest a presidential general election, was 73 when [[1984 United States presidential election|re-elected in 1984]], whereas on Election Day in 2020 Biden will be 77 and Trump will be 74.}} and, if elected and inaugurated, would become the oldest serving president.{{efn|On Inauguration Day in 2021 Biden will be 78 years, 62 days old which is [[List of presidents of the United States by age|79 days older]] than [[Ronald Reagan]] was when he left office in 1989.

Here are the odds.|last=Chamings|first=Andrew|date=April 8, 2020|website=[[SFGate]]|language=en|access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n===Procedure===\n{{further|United States presidential election#Procedure}}\n\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states that for a person to serve as president the individual must be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen of the United States]], at least 35 years old and a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]].

Bush]] sought a second term in [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries|1992]] and [[2004 Republican Party presidential primaries|2004]], respectively; and Democrats scrapped some of their primaries when [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] were seeking reelection in [[1996 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1996]] and [[2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2012]], respectively.<ref name=\"YYpWu\" /><ref name=\"b3RX8\" /> After cancelling their races, some of those states like Hawaii and New York immediately binded their delegates to Trump,<ref name=\"DzEs1\" /><ref name=\"0zsgw\" /> while other such states like Kansas and Nevada later formally held a convention or meeting to officially award their delegates to him.<ref name=\"cw1Ms\" /><ref name=\"vHq4G\" />\n\nIn addition, the Trump campaign urged Republican state committees that used proportional methods to award delegates in 2016 (where a state's delegates are basically divided proportionally among the candidates based on the vote percentage) to switch to a \"[[Plurality voting|winner-takes-all]]\" (where the winning candidate in a state gets all its delegates) or \"winner-takes-most\" (where the winning candidate only wins all of the state's delegates if he exceeds a predetermined amount, otherwise they are divided proportionally) for 2020.<ref name=\"politico20190506\" /><ref name=\"AP20190920\" />\n\nNevertheless, reports arose beginning in August 2017 that members of the Republican Party were preparing a \"shadow campaign\" against the President, particularly from the moderate or establishment wings of the party. Then-[[Arizona]] senator [[John McCain]] said, \"Republicans see weakness in this president.\"<ref name=\"wjjR6\" /><ref name=\"yDOhp\" /> [[Maine]] senator [[Susan Collins]], [[Kentucky]] senator [[Rand Paul]], and former [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] all expressed doubts in 2017 that Trump would be the 2020 nominee, with Collins stating \"it's too difficult to say.\"<ref name=\"C9L6O\" /><ref name=\"f20FO\" /> Senator [[Jeff Flake]] claimed in 2017 that Trump was \"inviting\" a primary challenger by the way he was governing.<ref name=\"Ogmqz\" /> Longtime political strategist [[Roger Stone]], however, predicted in May 2018 that Trump might not seek a second term were he to succeed in keeping all his campaign promises and \"mak[ing] America great again\".<ref name=\"GxyXS\" />\n\nFormer Massachusetts governor [[Bill Weld]] then became Trump's first major challenger in the Republican primaries following an announcement on April 15, 2019.<ref name=\"1Ad6f\" /> Weld, who was the Libertarian Party's nominee for vice president in 2016, is considered a long shot because his [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] views on several political positions such as abortion rights, gay marriage and marijuana legalization conflict with traditionalist [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] positions.<ref name=\"oioUK\" />\n\nIn addition, businessman [[Rocky De La Fuente]] entered the race on May 16, 2019, but was not widely recognized as a major candidate.\n\nFormer Illinois [[Illinois's 8th congressional district|representative]] [[Joe Walsh (American politician)|Joe Walsh]] launched a primary challenge on August 25, 2019, saying, \"I'm going to do whatever I can. I don't want [Trump] to win. The country cannot afford to have him win. If I'm not successful, I'm not voting for him.\"<ref name=\"6L2x8\" /> Walsh ended his presidential bid on February 7, 2020, after drawing around 1% support in the Iowa caucuses. Walsh declared that \"nobody can beat Trump in a Republican primary\" because the Republican Party was now \"a cult\" of Trump. According to Walsh, Trump supporters had become \"followers\" who think that Trump \"can do no wrong\", after absorbing misinformation \"from 'conservative' media. They don't know what the truth is and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 they don't care.\"<ref name=\"iWwLJ\" />\n\nOn September 8, 2019, former South Carolina governor and representative [[Mark Sanford]] officially announced that he would be another Republican primary challenger to Trump.<ref name=\"NYTimesSanford\" /> He dropped out of the race 65 days later on November 12, 2019, after failing to gain support in Republican circles.<ref name=\"JE5vC\" />\n\nStill, [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|Donald Trump's re-election campaign]] has essentially been ongoing since his victory in 2016, leading pundits to describe his tactic of holding rallies continuously throughout his presidency as a \"never-ending campaign\".<ref name=\"kn3IR\" /> On January 20, 2017, at 5:11&nbsp;p.m., he submitted a letter as a substitute of FEC Form 2, by which he reached the legal threshold for filing, in compliance with the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]].<ref name=\"0ergM\" /> Trump has run an active campaign during the primary season, even holding rallies in the February primary states, including South Carolina and Nevada where those Republican races were canceled.<ref name=\"vckt4\" /><ref name=\"y1IrS\" />\n\nThrough Super Tuesday, March 3, Trump won every race. Including those states who have canceled their races and have awarded their delegates to him, Trump through Super Tuesday won an estimated 1,023 of the 1,276 required to officially become the presumptive Republican Party nominee.<ref name=\"RifKC\" /> After the March 10 primaries, he was a mere 11 delegates shy of clinching, which he did the following week. As of March 21, he has received 11,446,331 popular votes. \n\nOn March 17, 2020, having won every state and every delegate but one, Trump became the presumptive nominee.<ref name=\"u9rZ3\" /> Weld suspended his campaign the next day.<ref name=\"HCjk9\" />\n\n====Presumptive nominee==== \n{{Donald Trump series |expanded=Campaigns}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n\n| colspan=\"28\" style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" |\n\n[[File:Republican Disc.png|65px|center|link=Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party (United States)]]<big>'''Presumptive 2020 Republican Party ticket\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:200px;\"|{{colored link|white|Donald Trump}}\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:200px;\"|{{colored link|white|Mike Pence}}\n|- style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:#ffd0d7;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for President'''''\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for Vice President'''''\n|-\n| [[File:Official Portrait of President Donald Trump.jpg|center|200x200px|border]]<!-- DO NOT CHANGE WITHOUT PRIOR CONSENSUS.

This would require a candidate to win a majority of pledged delegates from the assorted primary elections in order to win the party's nomination. The last time this did not occur was the nomination of [[Adlai Stevenson II]] at the [[1952 Democratic National Convention]].<ref name=\"ssKcA\" /> Meanwhile, six states will use [[Ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] in the primaries: Alaska, Hawaii, Kansas, and Wyoming for all voters; and Iowa and Nevada for absentee voters.<ref name=\"7VCs8\" />\n\nAfter [[Hillary Clinton]]'s loss in the [[2016 United States presidential election|previous]] election, the Democratic Party was seen largely as leaderless<ref name=\"BGA13\" /> and fractured between the [[centrist]] Clinton wing and the more [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[Bernie Sanders|Sanders]] wing of the party, echoing the rift brought up in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 primary]] election.<ref name=\"YGlMQ\" /><ref name=\"le0En\" />\n\nThis divide between the establishment and progressive wings of the party has been reflected in several elections leading up to the 2020 primaries, most notably in 2017 with the election for [[Democratic National Committee chairmanship election, 2017|DNC chair]] between moderate-backed [[Tom Perez]] and progressive-backed [[Keith Ellison]]:<ref name=\"rrgRf\" /> Perez was elected chairman, and Ellison was appointed the [[Deputy Chair of the Democratic National Committee|deputy chair]], a largely ceremonial role. In 2018, several [[U.S. House]] districts that Democrats hoped to gain from the Republican majority had contentious primary elections. These clashes were described by ''[[Politico]]''{{'}}s Elena Schneider as a \"Democratic civil war\".<ref name=\"rlKMJ\" /> Meanwhile, there has been a general shift to the left in regards to college tuition, healthcare, and immigration among Democrats in the Senate, likely to build up credentials for the upcoming primary election.<ref name=\"gTbzW\" /><ref name=\"C7O7F\" />\n\nOverall, the 2020 primary field had 29 major candidates,<ref name=\"fkBz3\" /> breaking the record for the largest field under the modern presidential primary system previously set during the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 GOP primaries]] with 17 major candidates.<ref name=\"politifact2019\" /> Several female candidates entered the race, increasing the likelihood of the Democrats nominating a woman for the second time in a row.<ref name=\"IuwYR\" />\n\nEntering the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses|Iowa caucuses]] on February 3, 2020, however, the field had decreased to 11 major candidates. [[Pete Buttigieg]] narrowly defeated [[Bernie Sanders]] in Iowa, then Sanders edged Buttigieg in the February 11 [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire primary]]. Following [[Michael Bennet]], [[Deval Patrick]], and [[Andrew Yang]] dropping out, Sanders won the [[2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses|Nevada caucuses]] on February 22. [[Joe Biden]] then won the [[2020 South Carolina Democratic primary|South Carolina primary]], causing Buttigieg, [[Amy Klobuchar]], and [[Tom Steyer]] to abandon their campaigns (Buttigieg and Klobuchar then immediately endorsed Biden).
