''Singer 2020'' is produced by Hong Tao, and its music director is Hong Kong senior musician [[Kubert Leung]]. The season premiere was first taped on January 3, 2020, and it was announced that the season will be subtitled ''Year of the Hits'' <!--PLS do not change the name-->({{zh|s=\u6b4c\u624b:\u5f53\u6253\u4e4b\u5e74|hp=G\u0113sh\u01d2u:D\u0101ngD\u01ceZh\u012bNi\u00e1n}})<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.8world.com/entertainment/music/article/jamhsiao-1015061|title=\u300a\u6b4c\u624b2020\u300b\u9635\u5bb9\u66dd\u5149\u3000\u8427\u656c\u817e\u60ca\u559c\u56de\u5f52|website=8\u4e16\u754c|date=2019-01-03|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>, and this is the second season to feature returning contestants, after [[Singer 2017|season five]]. The season premiered on February 7, 2020 after facing two postponements, one from January 10 due to some episodes clashing with [[Chinese New Year]], and one on January 31 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|ongoing Coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ent.sina.com.cn/tv/zy/2020-01-29/doc-iimxxste7519666.shtml|title=\u6e56\u5357\u536b\u89c6\u300a\u6b4c\u624b\u300b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u81f32\u67087\u65e5\u64ad\u51fa|website=Sina|date=2019-01-29|accessdate=2020-01-31}}</ref>.\n\nThis is the first season in the show's history not to feature Return performances, due to health and safety concerns over the coronavirus pandemic happening at the time of taping.\n\n==Competition rules==\nLike the previous seasons of ''I Am a Singer'' and ''Singer'', it features five rounds of two stages, Qualifier and Knockout, with seven singers performing for a 500-member audience each week. The [[electronic voting]], first appeared as a pre-voting twist in [[Singer 2018|season six]] and introduced permanently on [[Singer 2019|season seven]], where voting (up to three votes) was conducted throughout the performance and accounted for 50% of the final score. As such for past seasons, the scores from both weeks are combined to decide the eliminated singer who received the fewest votes. Unlike the last season, separate scores for paper and electronic votes are not revealed.\n\nThe competition revert to the pre-[[I Am a Singer (Chinese season 3)|season three]] format with Challenge rounds (a round which featured a new singer requiring to rank in the top four to avoid elimination) removed, but instead replaced with a variant round known as Surprise, which in-turn functions similarities to the Substituted singers as well. Three new singers were introduced at the start of the Qualifier round and along with the managers; while on backstage, the singers watched their performance while seated with a microphone stand lever. During the performance, a contestant may pull the lever to issue a challenge to the current contestant, but any current contestants are not aware from their existence until the performance ended. After the challenger performed, an electronic vote will immediately conduct with the results being revealed afterwards (previously after the episode prior to the first round). All three Surprise challenges do not need to be performed on a single episode, but challengers must challenge to a singer within the current elimination round. If at least one challenger succeed in the Surprise round, one contestant from the current lineup will be eliminated at the end of the current Knockout round; if multiple challengers succeed, a re-vote will conduct between the successful singers and the singer with a higher vote advance will replace the eliminated singer, but all successful singers, regardless if they lose the revote will be guaranteed a place in the Breakout round. If all three challengers were unsuccessful, all seven contestants are safe from elimination itself. The final round features a small change in which the Challengers were reduced to two, and no re-vote was conducted for multiple successful singers, meaning that the singers are immediately advanced to the competition and eliminations are conducted as usual.\n\nAs the season is subtitled ''Year of the Hits'', the contest is suggested for a pool of younger singing talents with an age range of 18 and 35. Contestants are no longer restricted to the songs selection, and may freely choose a song they composed on their own or on someone else. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://epaper.bbtnews.com.cn/site1/bjsb/html/2020-01/06/content_442354.htm|title=\u9996\u53d1\u9635\u5bb9\u5f15\u4e89\u8bae \u300a\u6b4c\u624b2020\u300b\u9760\u4ec0\u4e48\u201c\u5f53\u6253\u201d |publisher=\u5317\u4eac\u5546\u62a5|author1=\u5362\u626c|author2=\u4f0d\u78a7\u6021|date=2020-01-06|accessdate=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Contestants==\nThe following ''Singer 2020'' contestants are listed in alphabetical order.

The season premiered on February 7, 2020 after facing two postponements, one from January 10 due to some episodes clashing with [[Chinese New Year]], and one on January 31 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|ongoing Coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ent.sina.com.cn/tv/zy/2020-01-29/doc-iimxxste7519666.shtml|title=\u6e56\u5357\u536b\u89c6\u300a\u6b4c\u624b\u300b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u81f32\u67087\u65e5\u64ad\u51fa|website=Sina|date=2019-01-29|accessdate=2020-01-31}}</ref>.\n\nThis is the first season in the show's history not to feature Return performances, due to health and safety concerns over the coronavirus pandemic happening at the time of taping.\n\n==Competition rules==\nLike the previous seasons of ''I Am a Singer'' and ''Singer'', it features five rounds of two stages, Qualifier and Knockout, with seven singers performing for a 500-member audience each week. The [[electronic voting]], first appeared as a pre-voting twist in [[Singer 2018|season six]] and introduced permanently on [[Singer 2019|season seven]], where voting (up to three votes) was conducted throughout the performance and accounted for 50% of the final score. As such for past seasons, the scores from both weeks are combined to decide the eliminated singer who received the fewest votes. Unlike the last season, separate scores for paper and electronic votes are not revealed.\n\nThe competition revert to the pre-[[I Am a Singer (Chinese season 3)|season three]] format with Challenge rounds (a round which featured a new singer requiring to rank in the top four to avoid elimination) removed, but instead replaced with a variant round known as Surprise, which in-turn functions similarities to the Substituted singers as well. Three new singers were introduced at the start of the Qualifier round and along with the managers; while on backstage, the singers watched their performance while seated with a microphone stand lever. During the performance, a contestant may pull the lever to issue a challenge to the current contestant, but any current contestants are not aware from their existence until the performance ended. After the challenger performed, an electronic vote will immediately conduct with the results being revealed afterwards (previously after the episode prior to the first round). All three Surprise challenges do not need to be performed on a single episode, but challengers must challenge to a singer within the current elimination round. If at least one challenger succeed in the Surprise round, one contestant from the current lineup will be eliminated at the end of the current Knockout round; if multiple challengers succeed, a re-vote will conduct between the successful singers and the singer with a higher vote advance will replace the eliminated singer, but all successful singers, regardless if they lose the revote will be guaranteed a place in the Breakout round. If all three challengers were unsuccessful, all seven contestants are safe from elimination itself. The final round features a small change in which the Challengers were reduced to two, and no re-vote was conducted for multiple successful singers, meaning that the singers are immediately advanced to the competition and eliminations are conducted as usual.\n\nAs the season is subtitled ''Year of the Hits'', the contest is suggested for a pool of younger singing talents with an age range of 18 and 35. Contestants are no longer restricted to the songs selection, and may freely choose a song they composed on their own or on someone else. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://epaper.bbtnews.com.cn/site1/bjsb/html/2020-01/06/content_442354.htm|title=\u9996\u53d1\u9635\u5bb9\u5f15\u4e89\u8bae \u300a\u6b4c\u624b2020\u300b\u9760\u4ec0\u4e48\u201c\u5f53\u6253\u201d |publisher=\u5317\u4eac\u5546\u62a5|author1=\u5362\u626c|author2=\u4f0d\u78a7\u6021|date=2020-01-06|accessdate=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Contestants==\nThe following ''Singer 2020'' contestants are listed in alphabetical order.

It possessed an unusual, elongated third finger which may have supported a membranous wing, much like the related ''[[Yi (dinosaur)|Yi qi]]''.

The lower jaw contained at least twelve teeth, larger in the front of the jaws than in the back. The lower jaw bones may have been fused together, a feature otherwise known only in the [[Oviraptorosauria|oviraptorosaurs]].\n\nOne distinctive feature of ''Scansoriopteryx'' is its elongated third finger, which is the longest on the hand, nearly twice as long as the second finger. This is unlike the configuration seen in most other [[Theropoda|theropod]]s, where the second finger is longest. The long wing feathers, or remiges, appear to attach to this long digit instead of the middle digit as in birds and other maniraptorans. Shorter feathers are preserved attached to the second finger.<ref name=feduccia_czerkas2014/> A relative of ''Scansoriopteryx'', ''[[Yi (dinosaur)|Yi]]'', suggests that this elongated third finger supported a membranous wing of some kind alongside feathers.<ref name=yiqi2015>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature14423| title = A bizarre Jurassic maniraptoran theropod with preserved evidence of membranous wings| journal = Nature| year = 2015| last1 = Xu | first1 = X. | last2 = Zheng | first2 = X. | last3 = Sullivan | first3 = C. | last4 = Wang | first4 = X. | last5 = Xing | first5 = L. | last6 = Wang | first6 = Y. | last7 = Zhang | first7 = X. | last8 = o\u2019Connor | first8 = J.

They noted that, unlike all modern bird hatchlings, the forelimbs of ''Scansoriopteryx'' are longer than the hind limbs. The authors argued that this anomaly indicates the forelimbs played an important role in locomotion even at an extremely early developmental stage. ''Scansoriopteryx'' has a well-preserved foot, and the authors interpreted the hallux as reversed, the condition of a backward-pointing toe being widespread among modern tree-dwelling birds. Furthermore, the authors pointed to the short, stiffened tail of the ''Scansoriopteryx'' specimen as a tree-climbing adaptation. The tail may have been used as a prop, much like the tails of modern [[woodpecker]]s. Comparison with the hands of modern climbing species with elongated third digits, like [[iguanid]] lizards, also supports the tree-climbing hypothesis. Indeed, the hands of ''Scansoriopteryx'' are much better adapted to climbing than the modern tree-climbing hatchling of the [[hoatzin]].<ref name=\"czerkas2002\"/>\n\nThe ''Epidendrosaurus'' was also interpreted as arboreal based on the elongated hand and specializations in the foot.<ref name=\"zhang2002\"/> The describing authors stated that the long hand and strongly curved claws are adaptations for climbing and moving around among tree branches. They viewed this as an early stage in the evolution of the bird wing, stating that the forelimbs became well-developed for climbing, and that this development later lead to the evolution of a wing capable of flight. They stated that long, grasping hands are more suited to climbing than to flight, since most flying birds have relatively short hands.\n\nZhang ''et al.'' also noted that the foot of ''Epidendrosaurus'' is unique among non-avian theropods. While the ''Epidendrosaurus'' specimen does not preserve a reversed hallux, the backward-facing toe seen in modern perching birds, its foot was very similar in construction to more primitive perching birds like ''[[Cathayornis]]'' and ''[[Longipteryx]]''. These adaptations for grasping ability in all four limbs makes it likely that ''Epidendrosaurus'' spent a significant amount of time living in trees.\n\n===Feathers and scales===\n[[File:Epidendrosaurus ningchingensis.png|left|thumb|A reconstruction of ''Epidendrosaurus ningchengensis'', sometimes considered to be a junior synonym.]]\n''Scansoriopteryx'' fossils preserve impressions of wispy, down-like [[feather]]s around select parts of the body, forming V-shaped patterns similar to those seen in modern down feathers. The most prominent feather impressions trail from the left forearm and hand. The longer feathers in this region led Czerkas and Yuan to speculate that adult scansoriopterygids may have had reasonably well-developed wing feathers which could have aided in leaping or rudimentary gliding, though they ruled out the possibility that ''Scansoriopteryx'' could have achieved powered flight. Like other maniraptorans, ''Scansoriopteryx'' had a semilunate (half-moon shaped) bone in the wrist that allowed for bird-like folding motion in the hand. Even if powered flight was not possible, this motion could have aided maneuverability in leaping from branch to branch.<ref name=\"czerkas2002\"/> Reticulate [[Reptile scales|scales]] were preserved in the proximal portion of the second metatarsal,<ref name=\"feduccia_czerkas2014\"/> and the ''Epidendrosaurus'' specimen also preserved faint [[feather]] impressions at the end of the tail, similar to the pattern found in ''Microraptor''.<ref name=\"zhang2002\"/>\n\n==Paleoecology==\nThe holotype skeleton of ''Epidendrosaurus'' was recovered from the Daohugou fossil beds of northeastern China. In the past, there has been some uncertainty regarding the age of these beds. Various papers have placed the fossils here anywhere from the [[Middle Jurassic]] period (169 million years ago) to the [[Early Cretaceous]] period (122 ma).<ref name=\"ren2002\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ren | first1 = D. | display-authors = etal | year = 2002 | title = On the biostratigraphy of the Jurassic fossil beds at Daohugou near Ningcheng, Inner Mongolia | url = | journal = Geol. Bull. China | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 584\u2013591 }}</ref> The age of this formation has implications for the relationship between ''Epidendrosaurus'' and similar dinosaurs, as well as for the origin of birds in general. A Middle Jurassic age would mean that the bird-like dinosaurs in the Daohugou beds are older than the \"first bird\", ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', which was [[Late Jurassic]] in age. The provenance of ''Scansoriopteryx'' is uncertain, though Wang ''et al.'' (2006), in their study of the age of the Daohugou, suggest that it probably hails from the same beds, and thus is likely a synonym of ''Epidendrosaurus''.\n\n==History==\nThe provenance of the ''Scansoriopteryx'' type specimen is uncertain, as it was obtained from private fossil dealers who did not record exact geologic data. Czerkas and Yuan initially reported that it had likely come from the [[Yixian Formation]], though Wang ''et al.''

Czerkas and Yuan called it a \"proto-maniraptoran\", supporting the hypothesis of [[Gregory S. Paul]] that the larger, ground-dwelling maniraptorans like ''[[Velociraptor]]'' evolved from small, flying or gliding forms that lived in trees. The authors took this idea further than Paul, however, and lent support to George Olshevsky's 1992 \"birds came first\" hypothesis, that ''all'' true theropods are secondarily flightless or at least secondarily arboreal, having evolved from small, tree-dwelling, ''Scansoriopteryx''-like ancestors.

A second specimen, the [[holotype]] of ''Epidendrosaurus ninchengensis'' ([[Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology|IVPP]] V12653), also shows features indicating it was a juvenile. The specimen is partially disarticulated, and most bones are preserved as impressions in the rock slab, rather than three-dimensional structures.<ref name=\"zhang2002\">Zhang, F., Zhou, Z., Xu, X. & Wang, X.

The lower jaw contained at least twelve teeth, larger in the front of the jaws than in the back. The lower jaw bones may have been fused together, a feature otherwise known only in the [[Oviraptorosauria|oviraptorosaurs]].\n\nOne distinctive feature of ''Scansoriopteryx'' is its elongated third finger, which is the longest on the hand, nearly twice as long as the second finger. This is unlike the configuration seen in most other [[Theropoda|theropod]]s, where the second finger is longest. The long wing feathers, or remiges, appear to attach to this long digit instead of the middle digit as in birds and other maniraptorans. Shorter feathers are preserved attached to the second finger.<ref name=feduccia_czerkas2014/> A relative of ''Scansoriopteryx'', ''[[Yi (dinosaur)|Yi]]'', suggests that this elongated third finger supported a membranous wing of some kind alongside feathers.<ref name=yiqi2015>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature14423| title = A bizarre Jurassic maniraptoran theropod with preserved evidence of membranous wings| journal = Nature| year = 2015| last1 = Xu | first1 = X. | last2 = Zheng | first2 = X. | last3 = Sullivan | first3 = C. | last4 = Wang | first4 = X. | last5 = Xing | first5 = L. | last6 = Wang | first6 = Y. | last7 = Zhang | first7 = X. | last8 = o\u2019Connor | first8 = J.

It also had a pubis (hip bone) which pointed forward, a primitive trait among theropods, and unlike some maniraptorans more closely related to birds, where the pubis points downward or backward.<ref name=feduccia_czerkas2014/> The legs were short, and preserve small pebbly scales along the upper foot (metatarsus), as well as possible impressions of long feathers in the same area, possibly similar to the \"hind wings\" of ''[[Microraptor]]'' and other basal paravians.<ref name=feduccia_czerkas2014/> It also had an unusually large first toe, or [[hallux]], which was low on the foot and may have been reversed, allowing some grasping ability.<ref name=\"czerkas2002\"/>\n\nThe tail was long, six or seven times the length of the [[femur]], and ended in a fan of feathers.<ref name=\"zhang2002\"/>\n\n==Paleobiology==\nSeveral tiny fossil eggs discovered in the [[Sao Khua Formation]] of [[Phu Phok]], [[Thailand]] (one of which contained an embryo) were originally thought to have been laid by a small dinosaur similar to ''Scansoriopteryx''.<ref name=buffetautetal2005>Buffetaut, E., Grellet-Tinner, G., Suteethorn, V., Cuny, G., Tong, H., Ko\u0161ir, A., Cavin, L., Chitsing, S., Griffiths, P.J., Tabouelle, J. and Le Loeuff, J. (2005). \"Minute theropod eggs and embryo from the Lower Cretaceous of Thailand and the dinosaur-bird transition.\" ''Naturwissenschaften'', '''92'''(10): 477-482.</ref> However, further study showed that the eggs actually belonged to an [[Anguimorpha|anguimorph]] [[lizard]].<ref name=lizardeggphupjok>Fernandez, V. (2010). \"Detection and imaging of in ovo fossil embryos by synchrotron microtomography : Study of the enigmatic embryos from Phu Phok (Lower Cretaceous, Thailand).\" PhD Thesis.</ref>\n\n===Climbing===\n[[image:Scansor chick.png|thumb|Life restoration of a hatchling specimen.]]\nIn describing ''Scansoriopteryx'', Czerkas & Yuan cited evidence for an arboreal (tree-dwelling) lifestyle. They noted that, unlike all modern bird hatchlings, the forelimbs of ''Scansoriopteryx'' are longer than the hind limbs. The authors argued that this anomaly indicates the forelimbs played an important role in locomotion even at an extremely early developmental stage. ''Scansoriopteryx'' has a well-preserved foot, and the authors interpreted the hallux as reversed, the condition of a backward-pointing toe being widespread among modern tree-dwelling birds. Furthermore, the authors pointed to the short, stiffened tail of the ''Scansoriopteryx'' specimen as a tree-climbing adaptation. The tail may have been used as a prop, much like the tails of modern [[woodpecker]]s. Comparison with the hands of modern climbing species with elongated third digits, like [[iguanid]] lizards, also supports the tree-climbing hypothesis. Indeed, the hands of ''Scansoriopteryx'' are much better adapted to climbing than the modern tree-climbing hatchling of the [[hoatzin]].<ref name=\"czerkas2002\"/>\n\nThe ''Epidendrosaurus'' was also interpreted as arboreal based on the elongated hand and specializations in the foot.<ref name=\"zhang2002\"/> The describing authors stated that the long hand and strongly curved claws are adaptations for climbing and moving around among tree branches. They viewed this as an early stage in the evolution of the bird wing, stating that the forelimbs became well-developed for climbing, and that this development later lead to the evolution of a wing capable of flight. They stated that long, grasping hands are more suited to climbing than to flight, since most flying birds have relatively short hands.\n\nZhang ''et al.'' also noted that the foot of ''Epidendrosaurus'' is unique among non-avian theropods. While the ''Epidendrosaurus'' specimen does not preserve a reversed hallux, the backward-facing toe seen in modern perching birds, its foot was very similar in construction to more primitive perching birds like ''[[Cathayornis]]'' and ''[[Longipteryx]]''. These adaptations for grasping ability in all four limbs makes it likely that ''Epidendrosaurus'' spent a significant amount of time living in trees.\n\n===Feathers and scales===\n[[File:Epidendrosaurus ningchingensis.png|left|thumb|A reconstruction of ''Epidendrosaurus ningchengensis'', sometimes considered to be a junior synonym.]]\n''Scansoriopteryx'' fossils preserve impressions of wispy, down-like [[feather]]s around select parts of the body, forming V-shaped patterns similar to those seen in modern down feathers. The most prominent feather impressions trail from the left forearm and hand. The longer feathers in this region led Czerkas and Yuan to speculate that adult scansoriopterygids may have had reasonably well-developed wing feathers which could have aided in leaping or rudimentary gliding, though they ruled out the possibility that ''Scansoriopteryx'' could have achieved powered flight. Like other maniraptorans, ''Scansoriopteryx'' had a semilunate (half-moon shaped) bone in the wrist that allowed for bird-like folding motion in the hand. Even if powered flight was not possible, this motion could have aided maneuverability in leaping from branch to branch.<ref name=\"czerkas2002\"/> Reticulate [[Reptile scales|scales]] were preserved in the proximal portion of the second metatarsal<ref name=\"feduccia_czerkas2014\"/>, and the ''Epidendrosaurus'' specimen also preserved faint [[feather]] impressions at the end of the tail, similar to the pattern found in ''Microraptor''.<ref name=\"zhang2002\"/>\n\n==Paleoecology==\nThe holotype skeleton of ''Epidendrosaurus'' was recovered from the Daohugou fossil beds of northeastern China. In the past, there has been some uncertainty regarding the age of these beds. Various papers have placed the fossils here anywhere from the [[Middle Jurassic]] period (169 million years ago) to the [[Early Cretaceous]] period (122 ma).<ref name=\"ren2002\">Ren, D. ''et al.'' (2002). \"On the biostratigraphy of the Jurassic fossil beds at Daohugou near Ningcheng, Inner Mongolia.\" ''Geol. Bull. China'' '''21''', 584-591.</ref> The age of this formation has implications for the relationship between ''Epidendrosaurus'' and similar dinosaurs, as well as for the origin of birds in general. A Middle Jurassic age would mean that the bird-like dinosaurs in the Daohugou beds are older than the \"first bird\", ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', which was [[Late Jurassic]] in age. The provenance of ''Scansoriopteryx'' is uncertain, though Wang ''et al.'' (2006), in their study of the age of the Daohugou, suggest that it probably hails from the same beds, and thus is likely a synonym of ''Epidendrosaurus''.\n\n==History==\nThe provenance of the ''Scansoriopteryx'' type specimen is uncertain, as it was obtained from private fossil dealers who did not record exact geologic data. Czerkas and Yuan initially reported that it had likely come from the [[Yixian Formation]], though Wang ''et al.'' (2006), in their study of the age of the [[Daohugou Beds]], suggested that it probably hails from the same beds, and thus is likely a synonym of ''Epidendrosaurus''.

When not studying, the close friends are obsessed with their Bey tops, creating a school bey club and challenging each other to battles at their Bey Stadium. The friends eventually become friendly rivals as they compete against each other in a competition to claim the title of Japan\u2019s top Blader and to beat the undefeated Lui Shirosagi and his Beyblade, Lost Luinor.\n\n===''Beyblade Burst Evolution'' (2017\u201318)===\nIn season two of Beyblade Burst, Valt Aoi, who hails from Japan was a top competitor in the Japanese Championship. In Season Two, ''Evolution'', Valt is scouted for the prestigious Spanish team \"BC Sol\" and heads out to Spain. When he arrives in Spain, he runs into some old friends and meets some new ones who end up accompanying him along his journey. Valt\u2019s first battle in Spain leaves his bey, Valtryek, with an opportunity to evolve, making it stronger. Valt and his friends set their sights on becoming the World Champion; however, in order to qualify, they must first take the European League by winning team battles against other teams from around the globe. Valt is able to rank his way up. However, his old friend Shu has been tricked into becoming evil and has broken every bey he battles. Shu AKA Red Eye and Valt battle and Valtryek`s tip Reboot gets broken in half. He gets an evolved tip (Ultimate Reboot) and makes his way up again and then is able to stop Red Eye (Shu's Identity when controlled by Spryzen Requiem), bringing Shu back to normal. Valt is now the world champion.\n\n===''Beyblade Burst Turbo'' (2018\u201319)===\nTwo years after the International Blader's Cup, the story focuses on Aiger Akabane, a \"wild child\" that grew up in nature. After battling Valt Aoi, he became inspired to become the No.1 Blader in the world, along with his beyblade, Z Achilles. He aims to fight strong opponents in an effort to become stronger himself. To defeat Valt Aoi and become the World Champion, Aiger begins his journey. \n\n===''Beyblade Burst Rise'' (2019\u201320)===\nLegendary Blader Valt Aoi has been training the next generation of elite Bladers at Spain\u2019s BC Sol. One day, rookie Bladers Dante Koryu and Delta Zakuro witness Valt unleashing his newly-evolved Gamma Bey, Sword Valtryek. To their surprise, Valtryek radiates a golden light as it rockets around the stadium. Inspired by the limitless possibilities of this \u201cHyper-Flux\u201d state, both Dante and Delta seek the same bond with their Beys.\n\nDante and his partner, Ace Dragon, set off for Japan, the birthplace of Beyblade. But the path to glory won\u2019t be easy; plenty of tough competitors and Gamma Beys stand in their way, among them some of the best to ever let it rip.

When not studying, the close friends are obsessed with their Bey tops, creating a school bey club and challenging each other to battles at their Bey Stadium. The friends eventually become friendly rivals as they compete against each other in a competition to claim the title of Japan\u2019s top Blader and to beat the undefeated Lui Shirosagi and his Beyblade, Lost Luinor.\n\n===''Beyblade Burst Evolution'' (2017\u201318)===\nIn season two of Beyblade Burst, Valt Aoi, who hails from Japan was a top competitor in the Japanese Championship. In Season Two, ''Evolution'', Valt is scouted for the prestigious Spanish team \"BC Sol\" and heads out to Spain. When he arrives in Spain, he runs into some old friends and meets some new ones who end up accompanying him along his journey. Valt\u2019s first battle in Spain leaves his bey, Valtryek, with an opportunity to evolve, making it stronger. Valt and his friends set their sights on becoming the World Champion; however, in order to qualify, they must first take the European League by winning team battles against other teams from around the globe. Valt is able to rank his way up. However, his old friend Shu has been tricked into becoming evil and has broken every bey he battles. Shu AKA Red Eye and Valt battle and Valtryek`s tip Reboot gets broken in half. He gets an evolved tip (Ultimate Reboot) and makes his way up again and then is able to stop Red Eye (Shu's Identity when controlled by Spryzen Requiem), bringing Shu back to normal. Valt is now the world champion.\n\n===''Beyblade Burst Turbo'' (2018\u201319)===\nTwo years after the International Blader's Cup, the story focuses on Aiger Akabane, a \"wild child\" that grew up in nature. After battling Valt Aoi, he became inspired to become the No.1 Blader in the world, along with his beyblade, Z Achilles. He aims to fight strong opponents in an effort to become stronger himself. To defeat Valt Aoi and become the World Champion, Aiger begins his journey. \n\n===''Beyblade Burst Rise'' (2019\u201320)===\nLegendary Blader Valt Aoi has been training the next generation of elite Bladers at Spain\u2019s BC Sol. One day, rookie Bladers Dante Koryu and Delta Zakuro witness Valt unleashing his newly-evolved Gamma Bey, Sword Valtryek. To their surprise, Valtryek radiates a golden light as it rockets around the stadium. Inspired by the limitless possibilities of this \u201cHyper-Flux\u201d state, both Dante and Delta seek the same bond with their Beys.\n\nDante and his partner, Ace Dragon, set off for Japan, the birthplace of Beyblade. But the path to glory won\u2019t be easy; plenty of tough competitors and Gamma Beys stand in their way, among them some of the best to ever let it rip. Dante soon realizes he\u2019ll have to do whatever it takes to deepen his bond with Dragon.\n\nDo Dante and Dragon have what it takes to overcome these challenges? And will they ever achieve Hyper-Flux?. Here begins the story of Dante and Dragon's rise to the peak of the Blading world.\n\n===''Beyblade Burst Sparking'' (2020-21)===\n{{expand-section|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Official characters==\n{{section split|List of Beyblade Burst characters|date=November 2017}}\n===Main characters===\n;Valt Aoi / {{nihongo|Baruto Aoi|\u84bc\u4e95 \u30d0\u30eb\u30c8|Aoi Baruto}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Marina Inoue]]|[[Sabrina Pitre]] (seasons 1 and 2), [[Kimlinh Tran]] (season 3)}}\nValt is an energetic 11-year-old boy who dreams on being world champion.\n\n;Rantaro Kiyama / {{nihongo|\u9ec4\u5c71 \u4e71\u592a\u90ce|Kiyama Rantar\u014d}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Fumihiro Okabayashi]]|[[Matt Hill]] (seasons 1 and 2)}}\n:Also known as '''{{nihongo|Honcho|\u30af\u30df\u30c1\u30e7\u30fc|Kumicho}}'''\n\n;Ranjiro Kiyama / {{nihongo|\u9ec4\u5c71 \u4e71\u6b21\u90ce|Kiyama Ranjiro)}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Fumihiro Okabayashi]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]]}}\n:Also known as '''{{nihongo|Cap'n|\u30bd\u30fc\u30c1\u30e7\u30fc|Socho}}'''\n\n;Ken Midori / {{nihongo|Kensuke Midorikawa|\u7dd1\u5ddd \u30b1\u30f3\u30b9\u30b1|Midorikawa Kensuke}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Tsubasa Yonaga]]|[[Gabe Khouth]]}}\n\n;Daigo Kurogami / {{nihongo|Daina Kurogami|\u9ed2\u795e \u30c0\u30a4\u30ca|Kurogami Daina}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Ayahi Takagaki]]|[[Antony Kim]] (first half of season one), [[Zach LeBlanc]] (from second half of season one to season two)}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Hoji Konda|\u7d3a\u7530\u30db\u30a6\u30b8/\u7d3a\u7530\u6cd5\u4e8b|Konda Houji}}\n:{{animevoices|[[T\u014dru Nara]]|[[Brett Bauer]]}}\n\n;Wakiya Murasaki / {{nihongo|Wakiya Komurasaki|\u5c0f\u7d2b \u30ef\u30ad\u30e4|Komurasaki Wakiya}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Y\u016b Kobayashi]]|[[Cole Howard (voice actor)|Cole Howard]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Shu Kurenai|\u7d05 \u30b7\u30e5\u30a6|Kurenai Sh\u016b}}/ {{nihongo|Red Eye|\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30a2\u30a4|Reddo Ai}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Junya Enoki]]|[[Adrian Petriw]] (seasons 1 and 2), [[Alan Lee]] (season 3)}}\n\n;Toko Aoi / {{nihongo|Tokonatsu Aoi|\u84bc\u4e95\u5e38\u590f|Aoi Tokonatsu}}\n:{{animevoices|[[You Taichi]]|[[Sabrina Pitre]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Nika Aoi|\u84bc\u4e95\u65e5\u590f|Aoi Nika}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Aoi Inase]]|[[Sabrina Pitre]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Chiharu Aoi|\u84bc\u4e95\u5343\u6625|Aoi Chiharu}}\n\n;Kit Lopez / {{nihongo|Kitto Ropesu|\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30ed\u30da\u30b9|Ropesu Kitto}}\n\n;Silas Karlisle (Sisco Karlisle) / {{nihongo|Shisuko K\u0101rairu|\u30b7\u30b9\u30b3\u30ab\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30eb|K\u0101rairu Shisuko}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Takuma Terashima]]|[[Connor Parnall]]}}\n\n;Free De La Hoya / {{nihongo|Fur\u012b Derah\u014dya|\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30c7\u30e9\u30db\u30fc\u30e4|Derah\u014dya Fur\u012b}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Ryoko Shiraishi]]|Sean Thomas}}\n\n;Cuza Ackerman / {{nihongo|K\u016bza Akk\u0101man\u30af\u30fc\u30b6\u30a2\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30de\u30f3&\u30ab\u30fc\u30eb |Akk\u0101man K\u016bza}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Junko Takeuchi]]|Valin Shinyei}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Rickson Clay|\u30ea\u30af\u30bd\u30f3\u30af\u30ec\u30a4|}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Shasa Guten (Sasha Guten)|\u30b5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30fb\u30b0\u30c6\u30f3/|}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Honey Guten|\u30cf\u30cb\u30fc\u30fb\u30b0\u30c6\u30f3|}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Aoi Koga]]|[[Caitlyn Bairstow]]}}\n\n;Kristina Kuroda / {{nihongo|Kurisut\u012bna Kuroda|\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30ca \u30af\u30ed\u30c0|Kuroda Kurisut\u012bna}}\n\n;Raul Comas / {{nihongo|Zoro|\u30be\u30ed|Zoro}}\n\n;Trad Vazquez / {{nihongo|Toraddo Basukesu|\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30fb\u30d0\u30b9\u30b1\u30b9|Basukesu Toraddo}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Orochi Ginba|\u9280\u5203\u30aa\u30ed\u30c1/ \u9280\u5203\u5927\u86c7|Ginba Orochi}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Takahiro Mizushima]]|[[Daniel Bacon]]}} \n\n;Alexander 'Xander' Shakadera / {{nihongo|Kaiza Shakuenji|\u707c\u708e\u5bfa \u30ab\u30a4\u30b6|Shakuenji Kaiza}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Rikiya Koyama]]|[[Andrew Francis]]}}\n:Also known as '''Xander / {{nihongo4|Xhaka|\u30b7\u30e3\u30ab|Kshaka}}'''.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yugo Nansui|\u5357\u7fe0\u30e6\u30fc\u30b4|Nansui Yugo}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Daichi Hayashi]]|[[Nick Wolfhard]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Ukyo Ibuki|\u96ea\u5439\u53f3\u4eac|Ibuki Ukyo}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Natsumi Fujiwara]]|[[Vincent Tong]]}}\n\n;Zac Kaneguro / {{nihongo|Zenkuro Kurogane|\u9ed2\u9280\u5584\u4e5d\u90ce|Kurogane Zenkuro}}\n:Also known as '''Zac the Sunrise / Zac the Sunshine'''.\n\n;Quon Limon / {{nihongo|Quon Kimidori|\u9ec4\u7dd1\u30af\u30aa\u30f3|Kimidori Quon}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Yuka Nishigaki]]|[[Jonathan Whitesell]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Ben Azuki|\u5c0f\u8c46\u30d9\u30f3|Azuki Ben}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Mariko Higashiuchi]]|[[David A.

It has sold over six million copies and has been translated into a dozen languages. The book inspired six other sequels by Syd Hoff. \n\nThese are the other sequels:\n\n*Happy Birthday, Danny and the Dinosaur (1985)\n*Danny and the Dinosaur Go to Camp (1996)\n*Danny and the Dinosaur: Too Tall (2014)\n*Danny and the Dinosaur and the New Puppy (2015)\n*Danny and the Dinosaur and the Girl Next Door (2016)\n*Danny and the Dinosaur: School Days (2017)\n\nIt also won the distinction of \"''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' Outstanding Book of the Year\".\n\n''Danny and the Dinosaur'' is designated an [[I Can Read!]] Book.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story opens up with a young boy named Danny going to a science museum. He sees [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]]s, [[bear]]s, [[Eskimo]]s, [[gun]]s, and [[sword]]s. Finally, he immediately gets drawn to the dinosaur exhibit and would be delighted to find a living dinosaur. He thinks that the dinosaurs are not real. Really, at the museum, the dinosaurs are only models. Then he says he thinks it would be nice to play with one. One of the dinosaurs come up to Danny. And the voice belongs to one of the dinosaurs. The voice turns out to be a real dinosaur. The dinosaur says, \"And I think it would be nice to play with you\". Both agree to play with each other, and Danny rides out of the museum on the dinosaur's neck.\n\nDanny and his dinosaur friend, they embark on an adventure-filled day, including:\n\n*the dinosaur pretending to be a car (to confuse the dog that he is a vehicle)\n*the dinosaur confusing a building for a rock\n*attending a baseball game\n*pretending to be a boat on a lake\n*eating ice cream instead of grass\n*going to the zoo (All the people at the zoo came running to see Danny and the dinosaur; thinking a dinosaur is a display at the zoo. None of the people got their chance to see any of the zoo animals, such as the lions, the elephants, the monkeys, the sea lions, the giraffes, and the hippos. Although Danny and the dinosaur try to see the zoo animals, they get themselves thrown out of the zoo by a zoo man because the people are distracted and see Danny and the dinosaur rather than the zoo animals. The zoo man begs Danny and the dinosaur to leave the zoo so the zoo animals can be looked at by everyone else who are trying to see them.)\n*playing games, especially hide and seek, with other children\n\nThe dinosaur is well-intentioned throughout the story, for he helps a lady cross the street, takes Danny across a river and lets the children use him as a slide. The dinosaur is also a celebrity, as the illustrations show hundreds of people leave the zoo to play with Danny. \n\nPretty soon, Danny meets his friends (possibly maybe school friends for some of them and friends from Danny's neighborhood too). The other children get to ride the dinosaur too (when they see Danny riding on the dinosaur). Then, Danny and the children all play with the dinosaur for the rest of the day. Finally, they end with a game called [[hide and seek]]. The children and the dinosaur take turns of hiding. The dinosaur finds the children several times, but then there is no place else for him to hide in the neighborhood. In the last part of the game, Danny hatches an idea to make believe (pretend) like they can't find the dinosaur. Then the dinosaur says, \"Here I am!\". Then Danny and his friends all cheer that the dinosaur wins. \n\nAt the end of the story, all the other children, return home at sunset (with Danny and the dinosaur waving goodbye). Finally, Danny and the dinosaur were alone. The dinosaur says goodbye to Danny. But when Danny (hoping that he could keep \"his dinosaur buddy\" as a pet) asks the dinosaur if he can come and be with him (and says, \"We could have fun forever\"), the dinosaur says \"No\" to Danny and explains his reason. He says, \"The best I have had in a hundred million years. But now, I must go back to the museum. They need me there\". After telling Danny about how the museum needs him, Danny (disappointed but eventually obedient about the dinosaur's words), says goodbye to him. Danny (who knows that all good things always must come to an end) knows that he and the dinosaur can some time meet again (and play another day). He and the dinosaur can always come back and play another day. Then Danny and the dinosaur shake hands and the dinosaur leaves back for the museum. \n\nAfter watching until the long tail was out of sight, Danny went home alone. On the way home (on his own), Danny (along the way) thinks about one of the things first stated in the story. He wants a dinosaur for a pet. But he (even though he wants to keep him as a pet), realizes a dinosaur (a pet that size) is too big to live at his house. A dinosaur is too big to live at a house (even for the backyard). Danny says, \"Oh well. We don't have room for a pet that size anyway. But we did have a wonderful day\u201d.

Later that year it moved to the operation building, where it stayed until academic year of 2000/2001, when it moved to a new building, designated only to library's purposes. Over the years the number of publications grew together with increasing number of students, as well as academic and administrative staff, and has in the year of 2011 exceeded 100,000. The library collection is currently made of printed books, E-books, printed magazines, E-journals, multimedia, databases and theses. The collection has among them also many valuable books and encyclopedias, such as instance the \u201c\u0130N\u00d6N\u00dc ENCYCLOPEDIA\u201d (1946), which is the copy signed by the Prime Minister [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]], and which contains the preface written by the Ministry of National Education [[Hasan Ali Y\u00fccel]]. \nAnother valuable source in the Library Collection is the book entitled \u201cGAZ\u0130\u2019N\u0130N ESER\u0130: L\u2019oeuvre du GAZ\u0130 / [[Jean Weinberg]], 1933\u201d. The book prepared in Turkish and [[French language|French]], has been printed 2 copies and the copies have been submitted by Jean Weinberg to the related institution for the correction of the mistakes. One of 2 copies of this book has been included in the library and it has been donated by Retired Major General S\u0131tk\u0131 Ayd\u0131nel.\nPrecisely because of the library's fast growth, the requirement of new library construction has arisen, to which it moved in 2013. At the end of that academic year the library collection contained 75.305 printed books, 92.625 E-books, 3.340 printed magazines and 29.325 E-publications, with which the whole collection reached total number of 203,137 publications together. \nThe wide collection and the construction itself are one of the biggest among the libraries in [[Ankara]] to this date.\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20000920053711/http://www.atilim.edu.tr/ Atilim University website]\n*[http://library.atilim.edu.tr/ Library]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070409172715/http://www.atilim.edu.tr/images/campusmap.jpg Campus Map]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Atilim University}}\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1996]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Ankara]]\n[[Category:Private universities and colleges in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Turkey]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox university\n| name        = At\u0131l\u0131m University\n| native_name = At\u0131l\u0131m \u00dcniversitesi\n| image       = Atilim University Logo.jpg\n| motto       = Make Your Mark On The Future\n| established = 1996<ref>[http://www.edumaritime.com/europe/southern-europe/turkey/atilim-university-ankara International Trade and Logistics Education]</ref>\n| type        = [[Private university|Private]] (Foundation university)\n| rector      = Prof. Dr. Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m \u00dc\u00e7tu\u011f\n| provost     = \n| students    = 7500+\n| city        = [[Ankara]]\n| country     = [[Turkey]]\n| coordinates = {{coord|39.81351|N|32.72368|E|display=inline,title}}\n| website     = {{URL|atilim.edu.tr/}}\n}}\n\n'''At\u0131l\u0131m University''' (In [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''At\u0131l\u0131m \u00dcniversitesi'') is a private university, created in 1997.

Later that year it moved to the operation building, where it stayed until academic year of 2000/2001, when it moved to a new building, designated only to library's purposes. Over the years the number of publications grew together with increasing number of students, as well as academic and administrative staff, and has in the year of 2011 exceeded 100,000. The library collection is currently made of printed books, E-books, printed magazines, E-journals, multimedia, databases and theses. The collection has among them also many valuable books and encyclopedias, such as instance the \u201c\u0130N\u00d6N\u00dc ENCYCLOPEDIA\u201d (1946), which is the copy signed by the Prime Minister [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]], and which contains the preface written by the Ministry of National Education [[Hasan Ali Y\u00fccel]]. \nAnother valuable source in the Library Collection is the book entitled \u201cGAZ\u0130\u2019N\u0130N ESER\u0130: L\u2019oeuvre du GAZ\u0130 / [[Jean Weinberg]], 1933\u201d. The book prepared in Turkish and [[French language|French]], has been printed 2 copies and the copies have been submitted by Jean Weinberg to the related institution for the correction of the mistakes. One of 2 copies of this book has been included in the library and it has been donated by Retired Major General S\u0131tk\u0131 Ayd\u0131nel.\nPrecisely because of the library's fast growth, the requirement of new library construction has arisen, to which it moved in 2013. At the end of that academic year the library collection contained 75.305 printed books, 92.625 E-books, 3.340 printed magazines and 29.325 E-publications, with which the whole collection reached total number of 203,137 publications together. \nThe wide collection and the construction itself are one of the biggest among the libraries in [[Ankara]] to this date.\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20000920053711/http://www.atilim.edu.tr/ Atilim University website]\n*[http://library.atilim.edu.tr/ Library]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070409172715/http://www.atilim.edu.tr/images/campusmap.jpg Campus Map]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Atilim University}}\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1996]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Ankara]]\n[[Category:Private universities and colleges in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Turkey]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At%C4%B1l%C4%B1m_University"}

{"title_page": "Atma Jaya University, Yogyakarta", "text_new": "'''Universitas Atma Jaya Yogyakarta''' ({{lang-en|Atma Jaya University, Yogyakarta}}) is a [[university]] in [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]], which was affiliated with the [[Universitas Katolik Indonesia Atma Jaya]] in Jakarta.\n\nUAJY is one of the 50 most promising university and one of the best six universities in Indonesia in quality assurance according to Directorate of Higher Education, Department of National Education.\n\n==History==\nThe university was established on 27 September 1965 by the Yogyakarta branch of the Atma Jaya Catholic University Institute of Indonesia. The founders were [[Agustinus Suhardi|R.A. Soehardi]], A.J. Liem Sioe Siet A., Sutijoso, Oey Liang Lee and Leo Sukoto.\n\nOriginally an extension of the Universitas Atma Jaya in Jakarta, it became an independent university under the auspices of the Slamet Rijadi Foundation on 31 August 1973. The university borrowed classrooms from the IKIP (Teaching and Education Institute) Sanata Dharma, now the [[Universitas Sanata Dharma]], until its own campus buildings, at Mrican Baru Street, were finished in 1980.\n\nGrowing student numbers led to the Faculty of Engineering and the Administration department being moved to a new building in Babarsari Road in 1990, in conjunction with the celebrations of the silver anniversary of the founding of the university. In 1995, the Economics Faculty and the Postgraduate Program moved into a new building beside the existing building in Babarsari Road. In 2005 a new building was built adjacent to the Faculty of Engineering and the Administration department to host the Faculty of Social and Political Science. The University also acquired the former BHS Bank building to host administrative department.\n\nAn integrated four-story library was built next to the Faculty of Social and Political Science building. It will host library and Information Systems Center. The library building officially opened in a Mass led by Mgr. Ignatius Suharyo (archbishop) in October 2009.\n\nIn late 2010, a project for a new building was started. It was planned as an addition to the Faculty of Social and Political Science Building. The newer building is on the east of the current building.\n<!-- Commenting out info that is 10 years old: The rector for 2007-2011 was Prof. Dr. Dibyo Prabowo, M.Sc with three vice rectors \u2014 Dr. A.

Koesmargono was appointed as acting rector. Eventually, Dr. Koesmargono was elected as rector after defeating two other candidates (Dr. Gunarto the dean of Law Faculty and Dr Kusumadmo from the Faculty of Economics) in an election. Dr Koesmargono will serve as rector for the remainder of Prof. Dibyo Prabowo's term (until 2011). Professor Yoyong Arfiadi is appointed vice rector to fill position left vacant by Dr. Koesmargono. In December 2010, a rector election was held. There were two candidates, Dr Koesmargono (the incumbent) and Dr. R. Maryatmo, MA (former dean of Faculty of Economics).

The founders were [[Agustinus Suhardi|R.A. Soehardi]], A.J. Liem Sioe Siet A., Sutijoso, Oey Liang Lee and Leo Sukoto.\n\nOriginally an extension of the Universitas Atma Jaya in Jakarta, it became an independent university under the auspices of the Slamet Rijadi Foundation on 31 August 1973. The university borrowed classrooms from the IKIP (Teaching and Education Institute) Sanata Dharma, now the [[Universitas Sanata Dharma]], until its own campus buildings, at Mrican Baru Street, were finished in 1980.\n\nGrowing student numbers led to the Faculty of Engineering and the Administration department being moved to a new building in Babarsari Road in 1990, in conjunction with the celebrations of the silver anniversary of the founding of the university. In 1995, the Economics Faculty and the Postgraduate Program moved into a new building beside the existing building in Babarsari Road. In 2005 a new building was built adjacent to the Faculty of Engineering and the Administration department to host the Faculty of Social and Political Science. The University also acquired the former BHS Bank building to host administrative department.\n\nAn integrated four-story library was built next to the Faculty of Social and Political Science building. It will host library and Information Systems Center. The library building officially opened in a Mass led by Mgr. Ignatius Suharyo (archbishop) in October 2009.\n\nIn late 2010, a project for a new building was started. It was planned as an addition to the Faculty of Social and Political Science Building. The newer building is on the east of the current building.\n<!-- Commenting out info that is 10 years old: The rector for 2007-2011 was Prof. Dr. Dibyo Prabowo, M.Sc with three vice rectors \u2014 Dr. A. Koesmargono (Academic), Luddy Indra Purnama (Administrative and Finance), and A. Siswanto as acting (temporary) vice rector for Students, Alumni, and Cooperation. In early 2009, A. Siswanto was replaced by Hestu Cipto Handoyo, the position vice rector for Students, Alumni, and Cooperation became permanent. On 19 August 2009 Prof. Dr. Dibyo Prabowo, M.Sc. died. Dr. A. Koesmargono was appointed as acting rector. Eventually, Dr. Koesmargono was elected as rector after defeating two other candidates (Dr. Gunarto the dean of Law Faculty and Dr Kusumadmo from the Faculty of Economics) in an election. Dr Koesmargono will serve as rector for the remainder of Prof. Dibyo Prabowo's term (until 2011). Professor Yoyong Arfiadi is appointed vice rector to fill position left vacant by Dr. Koesmargono. In December 2010, a rector election was held. There were two candidates, Dr Koesmargono (the incumbent) and Dr. R. Maryatmo, MA (former dean of Faculty of Economics). The university senate voted for 2011-2015 rector on December 16, 2010. -->\n==Faculties==\n#Engineering Dean Prof. Ir.
