Warned by Theodora, Justinian escaped, murdering two Khazar officials in the process. He fled to Bulgaria, whose Khan [[Tervel]] helped him regain the throne. Upon his reinstalment, and despite Busir's treachery during his exile, he sent for Theodora; Busir complied, and she was crowned as Augusta, suggesting that both prized the alliance.{{sfn|Cameron|1984|p=212}}{{sfn|Bauer|2010|pp=341\u2013342}}\n\nDecades later, [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] (ruled 717\u2013741) made a similar alliance to co-ordinate strategy against a common enemy, the [[Muslim Arabs]].

The First Arab-Khazar War began during the first phase of [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]]. By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]]. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, [[Balanjar]], but were [[Battle of Balanjar (650s)|defeated]], suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], both sides in the battle used [[catapult]]s against the opposing troops. A number of Russian sources give the name of a Khazar khagan from this period as [[List of Khazar rulers|Irbis]] and describe him as a scion of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk royal house, the Ashina. Whether Irbis ever existed is open to debate, as is whether he can be identified with one of the many G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk rulers of the same name.\n\nDue to the outbreak of the [[First Fitna|First Muslim Civil War]] and other priorities, the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century.{{sfn|Mako|2010|p=45}} The Khazars launched a few raids into Transcaucasian principalities under Muslim dominion, including a large-scale raid in 683\u2013685 during the [[Second Fitna|Second Muslim Civil War]] that rendered much booty and many prisoners.{{sfn|Brook|2010|pp=126\u2013127}} There is evidence from the account of al-Tabari that the Khazars formed a united front with the remnants of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks in Transoxiana.\n\n[[File:Map of the Caucasus, 740 CE.svg|thumb|300px|{{center|Caucasus region, c. 740}}]]\n\nThe Second Arab-Khazar War began with a series of raids across the Caucasus in the early 8th century. The Umayyads tightened their grip on Armenia in 705 after suppressing a large-scale rebellion. In 713 or 714, Umayyad general [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik|Maslamah]] conquered Derbent and drove deeper into Khazar territory. The Khazars launched raids in response into [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] but were driven back by the Arabs under [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]].{{sfn|Brook|2010|p=127}} The conflict escalated in 722 with an invasion by 30,000 Khazars into Armenia inflicting a crushing defeat. Caliph [[Yazid II]] responded, sending 25,000 Arab troops north, swiftly driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovering Derbent, and advancing on Balanjar. The Arabs [[Battle of Balanjar (723)|broke through the Khazar defence]] and stormed the city; most of its inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north.{{sfn|Brook|2010|pp=126\u2013127}} Despite their success, the Arabs had not yet defeated the Khazar army, and they retreated south of the Caucasus.\n\nIn 724, Arab general [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Khazars in a long battle between the rivers [[Cyrus (river)|Cyrus]] and [[Araxes]], then moved on to capture [[Tiflis]], bringing [[Caucasian Iberia]] under Muslim suzerainty. The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named [[Barjik]], launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive. In 730, Barjik invaded Iranian Azerbaijan and [[Battle of Ardabil|defeated]] Arab forces at [[Ardabil]], killing the general [[al-Djarrah al-Hakami]] and briefly occupying the town. Barjik was defeated and killed the next year at [[Mosul]], where he directed Khazar forces from a throne mounted with al-Djarrah's severed head {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. In 737, Marwan Ibn Muhammad entered Khazar territory under the guise of seeking a truce. He then launched a surprise attack in which The Qaghan fled north and the Khazars surrendered.{{sfn|Golden|1980|p=64}} The Arabs did not have resources to influence affairs of Transcaucasia.{{sfn|Golden|1980|p=64}} The Qa\u011fan was forced to accept terms involving conversion to Islam, and to subject himself to the Caliphate, but the accommodation was short-lived as a combination of internal instability among the Umayyads and Byzantine support undid the agreement within three years, and the Khazars re-asserted their independence.{{sfn|Wasserstein|2007|pp=375\u2013376}} The suggestion that the Khazars adopted [[Judaism]] as early as 740 is based on the idea that, in part, it was, a re-assertion of independence with regard to both Byzantium and the Caliphate, while conforming to a general Eurasian trend to embrace a world religion.{{efn|group=note|\"The Khazars, the close allies of the Byzantines, adopted Judaism, as their official religion, apparently by 740, three years after an invasion by the Arabs under Marwan ibn Muhammad. Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan's terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty's conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (however theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.\"{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=149}}}}\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737. Arab raids continued until 741, but their control in the region was limited as maintaining a large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched army. A [[Third Fitna|third Muslim civil war]] soon broke out, leading to the Abbasid Revolution and the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750.\n\nIn 758, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] attempted to strengthen diplomatic ties with the Khazars, ordering [[Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami]], one of his nobles and the [[Ostikanate of Arminiya|military governor of Armenia]], to take a royal Khazar bride. Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan [[Baghatur]], but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, broken only by a series of raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.\n\n===Rise of the Rus' and the collapse of the Khazarian state===\n[[File:Varangian routes.png|thumb|300px|Trade routes of the Black Sea region, 8th\u201311th centuries]]\n\nBy the 9th century, groups of [[Varangians|Varangian Rus']], developing a powerful warrior-merchant system, began probing south down the waterways controlled by the Khazars and their protectorate, the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, partially in pursuit of the Arab silver that flowed north for hoarding through the Khazarian-Volga Bulgarian trading zones,{{efn|group=note|Over 520 separate hoards of such silver have been uncovered in Sweden and [[Gotland]].{{sfn|Moss|2002|p=16}}}} partially to trade in furs and ironwork.{{efn|group=note|The Volga Bulgarian state was converted to Islam in the 10th century, and wrested liberty from its Khazarian suzerains when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatislav]] razed Atil.{{sfn|Abulafia|1987|pp=419, 480\u2013483}}}} Northern mercantile fleets passing Atil were tithed, as they were at Byzantine [[Cherson (theme)|Cherson]].{{sfn|Shepard|2006|p=19}} Their presence may have prompted the formation of a Rus' state by convincing the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], [[Volga Finns|Merja]] and the [[Chud]]' to unite to protect common interests against Khazarian exactions of tribute. It is often argued that a [[Rus' Khaganate]] modelled on the Khazarian state had formed to the east, and that the Varangian chieftain of the coalition appropriated the title of qa\u011fan (''khagan'') as early as the 830s: the title survived to denote the princes of [[Kievan Rus']], whose capital, [[Kiev]], is often associated with a Khazarian foundation.{{sfn|Petrukhin|2007|p=245}}{{sfn|Noonan|2001|p=81}}{{efn|group=note|Whittow argues however that: \"The title of qaghan, with its claims to lordship over the steppe world, is likely to be no more than ideological booty from the 965 victory.\"{{sfn|Whittow|1996|pp=243\u2013252}}}}{{efn|group=note|Korobkin citing Golb & Pritsak notes that Khazars have often been connected with Kiev's foundations.{{sfn|Korobkin|1998|p=xxvii}} Pritsak and Golb state that children in [[Kiev]] were being given a mixture of [[Hebrew]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] names by c. 930.{{sfn|Golb|Pritsak|1982|p=15}} Toch on the other hand is skeptical, and argues that \"a significant Jewish presence in early medieval Kiev or indeed in Russia at large remains much in doubt\".{{sfn|Toch|2012|p=166}}}} The construction of the [[Sarkel|Sarkel fortress]], with technical assistance from Khazaria's Byzantine ally at the time, together with the minting of an autonomous Khazar coinage around the 830s, may have been a defensive measure against emerging threats from Varangians to the north and from the [[Magyars]] on the eastern steppe.{{efn|group=note|The ''[[yarmaq]]'' based on the Arab ''[[dirhem]]'' was perhaps issued in reaction to fall-off in Muslim minting in 820s, and to a felt need in the turbulent upheavals of the 830s to assert a new religious profile, with the Jewish legends stamped on them.{{sfn|Golden|2007b|p=156}}}}{{efn|group=note|Scholars are divided as to whether the fortification of Sarkel represents a defensive bulwark against a growing Magyar or Varangian threat.{{sfn|Petrukhin|2007|p=247, and n.1}}}} By 860, the Rus' had penetrated as far as Kiev and, via the [[Dnieper]], Constantinople.{{sfn|Petrukhin|2007|p=257}}\n\n[[File:Sarkel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Site of the Khazar fortress at Sarkel (aerial photo from excavations conducted by [[Mikhail Illarionovich Artamonov|Mikhail Artamonov]] in the 1950s).]]\n\nAlliances often shifted.

The purpose was to revenge the violence the Rus' [[Looting|razzias]] had inflicted on their fellow Muslim believers.{{efn|group=note|Al-Mas\u2018udi says the king secretly tipped off the Rus' of the attack but was unable to oppose the request of his guards.{{sfn|Olsson|2013|p=507}}}} The Rus' force was thoroughly routed and massacred.{{sfn|Kohen|2007|p=107}} The Khazar rulers closed the passage down the Volga to the Rus', sparking a war.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld. [[Ancestor worship]] was observed.

The First Arab-Khazar War began during the first phase of [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]]. By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]]. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, [[Balanjar]], but were [[Battle of Balanjar (650s)|defeated]], suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], both sides in the battle used [[catapult]]s against the opposing troops. A number of Russian sources give the name of a Khazar khagan from this period as [[List of Khazar rulers|Irbis]] and describe him as a scion of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk royal house, the Ashina. Whether Irbis ever existed is open to debate, as is whether he can be identified with one of the many G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk rulers of the same name.\n\nDue to the outbreak of the [[First Fitna|First Muslim Civil War]] and other priorities, the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century.{{sfn|Mako|2010|p=45}} The Khazars launched a few raids into Transcaucasian principalities under Muslim dominion, including a large-scale raid in 683\u2013685 during the [[Second Fitna|Second Muslim Civil War]] that rendered much booty and many prisoners.{{sfn|Brook|2010|pp=126\u2013127}} There is evidence from the account of al-Tabari that the Khazars formed a united front with the remnants of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks in Transoxiana.\n\n[[File:Map of the Caucasus, 740 CE.svg|thumb|300px|{{center|Caucasus region, c. 740}}]]\n\nThe Second Arab-Khazar War began with a series of raids across the Caucasus in the early 8th century. The Umayyads tightened their grip on Armenia in 705 after suppressing a large-scale rebellion. In 713 or 714, Umayyad general [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik|Maslamah]] conquered Derbent and drove deeper into Khazar territory. The Khazars launched raids in response into [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] but were driven back by the Arabs under [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]].{{sfn|Brook|2010|p=127}} The conflict escalated in 722 with an invasion by 30,000 Khazars into Armenia inflicting a crushing defeat. Caliph [[Yazid II]] responded, sending 25,000 Arab troops north, swiftly driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovering Derbent, and advancing on Balanjar. The Arabs [[Battle of Balanjar (723)|broke through the Khazar defence]] and stormed the city; most of its inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north.{{sfn|Brook|2010|pp=126\u2013127}} Despite their success, the Arabs had not yet defeated the Khazar army, and they retreated south of the Caucasus.\n\nIn 724, Arab general [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Khazars in a long battle between the rivers [[Cyrus (river)|Cyrus]] and [[Araxes]], then moved on to capture [[Tiflis]], bringing [[Caucasian Iberia]] under Muslim suzerainty. The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named [[Barjik]], launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive. In 730, Barjik invaded Iranian Azerbaijan and [[Battle of Ardabil|defeated]] Arab forces at [[Ardabil]], killing the general [[al-Djarrah al-Hakami]] and briefly occupying the town. Barjik was defeated and killed the next year at [[Mosul]], where he directed Khazar forces from a throne mounted with al-Djarrah's severed head {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. In 737, Marwan Ibn Muhammad entered Khazar territory under the guise of seeking a truce. He then launched a surprise attack in which The Qaghan fled north and the Khazars surrendered.{{sfn|Golden|1980|p=64}} The Arabs did not have resources to influence affairs of Transcaucasia.{{sfn|Golden|1980|p=64}} The Qa\u011fan was forced to accept terms involving conversion to Islam, and to subject himself to the Caliphate, but the accommodation was short-lived as a combination of internal instability among the Umayyads and Byzantine support undid the agreement within three years, and the Khazars re-asserted their independence.{{sfn|Wasserstein|2007|pp=375\u2013376}} The suggestion that the Khazars adopted [[Judaism]] as early as 740 is based on the idea that, in part, it was, a re-assertion of independence with regard to both Byzantium and the Caliphate, while conforming to a general Eurasian trend to embrace a world religion.{{efn|group=note|\"The Khazars, the close allies of the Byzantines, adopted Judaism, as their official religion, apparently by 740, three years after an invasion by the Arabs under Marwan ibn Muhammad. Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan's terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty's conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (however theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.\"{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=149}}}}\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737. Arab raids continued until 741, but their control in the region was limited as maintaining a large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched army. A [[Third Fitna|third Muslim civil war]] soon broke out, leading to the Abbasid Revolution and the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750.\n\nIn 758, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] attempted to strengthen diplomatic ties with the Khazars, ordering [[Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami]], one of his nobles and the [[Ostikanate of Arminiya|military governor of Armenia]], to take a royal Khazar bride. Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan [[Baghatur]], but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, broken only by a series of raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.\n\n===Rise of the Rus' and the collapse of the Khazarian state===\n[[File:Varangian routes.png|thumb|300px|Trade routes of the Black Sea region, 8th\u201311th centuries]]\n\nBy the 9th century, groups of [[Varangians|Varangian Rus']], developing a powerful warrior-merchant system, began probing south down the waterways controlled by the Khazars and their protectorate, the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, partially in pursuit of the Arab silver that flowed north for hoarding through the Khazarian-Volga Bulgarian trading zones,{{efn|group=note|Over 520 separate hoards of such silver have been uncovered in Sweden and [[Gotland]].{{sfn|Moss|2002|p=16}}}} partially to trade in furs and ironwork.{{efn|group=note|The Volga Bulgarian state was converted to Islam in the 10th century, and wrested liberty from its Khazarian suzerains when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatislav]] razed Atil.{{sfn|Abulafia|1987|pp=419, 480\u2013483}}}} Northern mercantile fleets passing Atil were tithed, as they were at Byzantine [[Cherson (theme)|Cherson]].{{sfn|Shepard|2006|p=19}} Their presence may have prompted the formation of a Rus' state by convincing the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], [[Volga Finns|Merja]] and the [[Chud]]' to unite to protect common interests against Khazarian exactions of tribute.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld. [[Ancestor worship]] was observed. The key religious figure appears to have been a [[shamanism|shaman]]-like ''qam'',{{sfn|Golden|2007|pp=131\u2013133}} and it was these (''qozm\u00edm'') that were, according to the Khazar Hebrew conversion stories, driven out.\n\nMany sources suggest, and a notable number of scholars have argued, that the charismatic \u0100sh\u01d0n\u00e0 clan played a germinal role in the early Khazar state, although Zuckerman dismisses the widespread notion of their pivotal role as a 'phantom'.

This was the first year that the ballots would be open to the public, which is why percentages of votes for each candidate were listed besides most categories. To celebrate the 20th award ballot, the Lifetime Non-Achievement Award was given out to [[Chevy Chase]] and a multitude of other categories, including Worst On-Screen Couple and Worst Director, were introduced. Founder Ray Wright listed ''Batman and Robin'' and ''Crash '' among his five worst movies of the 1990s, which also included ''[[It's Pat]]'', ''[[Pokemon: The First Movie]]'', and ''[[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing but Trouble]]''. While ''Batman and Robin'' was a preliminary target and took home several awards, ''Crash '' was largely ignored aside from the Founders Award because it was a low-key indie film.<ref>{{cite web |title=Q & A with the Stinkers |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010413025218/http://thestinkers.com/qanda.html |website=The Stinkers |accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Gary |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19980228&id=Ae0yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VwgGAAAAIBAJ&pg=3861,5389515 |title=Group Recognzes Stinkers |accessdate=2013-03-31 |publisher=[[The Free Lance-Star]]|date=February 28, 1998}}</ref>\n\nListed as follows are the different categories with their respective winners and nominees, including Worst Picture and its dishonourable mentions, which are films that were considered for Worst Picture but ultimately failed to make the final ballot (30 total).

This was the first year that the ballots would be open to the public, which is why percentages of votes for each candidate were listed besides most categories. To celebrate the 20th award ballot, the Lifetime Non-Achievement Award was given out to [[Chevy Chase]] and a multitude of other categories, including Worst On-Screen Couple and Worst Director, were introduced. Founder Ray Wright listed ''Batman and Robin'' and ''Crash '' among his five worst movies of the 1990s, which also included ''[[It's Pat]]'', ''[[Pokemon: The First Movie]]'', and ''[[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing but Trouble]]''. While ''Batman and Robin'' was a preliminary target and took home several awards, ''Crash '' was largely ignored aside from the Founders Award because it was a low-key indie film.<ref>{{cite web |title=Q & A with the Stinkers |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010413025218/http://thestinkers.com/qanda.html |website=The Stinkers |accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Gary |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19980228&id=Ae0yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VwgGAAAAIBAJ&pg=3861,5389515 |title=Group Recognzes Stinkers |accessdate=2013-03-31 |publisher=[[The Free Lance-Star]]|date=February 28, 1998}}</ref>\n\nListed as follows are the different categories with their respective winners and nominees, including Worst Picture and its dishonourable mentions, which are films that were considered for Worst Picture but ultimately failed to make the final ballot (30 total).
