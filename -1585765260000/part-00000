{"title_page": "Makholokoe Tribes", "text_new": "{{no footnotes|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Kholokoe Tribe ==\n\n=== Classification ===\nMakgolokoe/Makholokoe/Makgolokwe/Bakholokoe refers to the '''Bakgatla Tribe''' of Morena Khetsi/Kgetsi son for Morena Tabane. The Ba/Ma-kholokoe are found in the Easter Free State (Harrismith, Wetsieshoek, Vrede, Kestel, etc.), Kwazulu/Natal(Nqutu) and Mpumalanga (Daggakraal, Amersfoort) as their historical residence. The Ba/Ma-kholokoe are the descendants of the originally Bantu-Speaking tribes from the central Congo region who migrated Southwards around 600 AD. They are the offspring of Bakgatla Chief Tabane and Mathulare daughter of the Bafokeng Chief. Tabane fathered five sons, Diale, Kgetsi, Kgwadi (Motl\u00f4kwa), Matsibolo/Matsiboho, and Mosia (in order of their birth). Each broke away to form Bapedi, Ba/Ma-kholokwe, Batl\u00f4kwa, Maphuthing and Basia respectively. Ba/Ma-kholokoe demonstrated linguistic and cultural characteristics that distinguished them from other Bantu-speakers of southern Africa, with their language showing a merger of South Sotho and [[Nguni language]]s. Other practices included totemism (Ba/Ma-kholokoe totem is Phuthi - Duiker, some still hold on to the fowl, while others the porcupine), the preferential marriage of paternal cousins, and an architectural style characterized by a round hut with a conical thatch roof. The senior house of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe is the house of Moduli/Molupi, they are the Makholokoe a Letseba \"letseba le letsebilae ke mang, le Mokholoane a shoele a sa le tsebe\". Tabane first son from his senior wife Matlaisane remained with the Bakgatla ba Mot\u0161ha group, after Tabane concurred the Ba-Venda nation he married a Ba-Venda wife and fathered a son called Davhana who fathered Vele. \n\n=== History (Nalane) ===\n \nThe traditions of the Barolong kingdoms indicate that at some time in the past up until the leadership battles of the 14th Century they were all under the same rule of a line of kings who claimed descent from a common ancestor, Morolong. Following the death of Morolong's 4th generation great- grandson Masilo there was a leadership crisis that resulted in the formation of the Ba-Hurutshe and Ba-Kwena clans. Ba/Ma-kholokoe claim lineage from the Ba-Hurutshe clan and traced their early ancestry to Mokgatla, the founder of the BaKgatla and his 4th generation great grandson Tabane. \n\nAround 1560 Kgetsi/Khetsi(Lekholokoe) son of Tabane married Mabale and fathered Moloi, Moloi married Maleseha and fathered Hlabathe, Hlabathe fathered Sehoala/Sehoele, Sehoala married Malekoesa and fathered Tjale, Tjale fathered Tsholedi, Tsholedi married Malekunya and fathered Motsoane, Motsoane fathered Mokholoane, fathered Matsemela who married Madiale and fathered the five known houses of Kholokoe Leubane, Maphale, Tsele, Motaoane and with Matsholedi fathered Lehasa. \n\nBefore the birth of Kgetsi/Khetsi, his father Tabane with other Bakgatla lived around \"Thaba tsa Mohale\" known today as [[Magaliesberg]], during the 1600s Kgetsi/Khetsi took his group and moved eastwards and North of Lekoa (Vaal) settling near Seratoe today [[Standerton]], at a mountain which since their occupation became Thaba Kholokoe.  This is where Ba/Ma-kholokoe lived for over 200 years, about eight to nine generations until the attacks of Matiwane in 1822, Mzilikazi in 1823 and is considered the birthplace of Ba/Ma-khlokoe. Some of the Ba/Ma-kholokoe Kings/Chief that lived in Thaba Kholokoe:\n- Kgetsi\n- Moloi\n- Hlabate\n- Sehoaba/Sehoele\n- Tyale\n- Tsholedi\n- Motsoane\n- Mokholoane\n- Matsemela\nFrom Thaba Kholokoe Ba/Ma-kholokoe spread to many areas around the Free State and Natal. One group under the leadership of Morena Wetsi (Oetsi) settled in today's Wetsieshoek, where many Ba/Ma-kholokoe were killed inside a [[Witsie's Cave (Lekhalong la Witsie)|cave]] during a war against the Boers. The kinship/chieftaincy of Bakholokoe has always been marked by disagreement and internal feuds, living the legacy for this leadership still in question to this day. \n\nAlthough many consider the totem of Ba/Ma-kholokoe as a [[:nso:Phuti|Phuthi]] (duiker), it is believed that this small antelope led Bakholokoe to safety during a war, there are some that say the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe totem is a porcupine [[Porcupine]].\n\n=== Land (Naha) ===\n \nAlthough one would love to hear the anecdotal side of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe history, it is unfortunately heavily clouded by the ever-present and festering issue of land and property dispossession and subsequent brutal oppression and painful suffering of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, first from the Dutch \u2015Boer\u2016 Government (Volksraad) of the Free State, and subsequently from the British Orange River Colony Administration and even in the modern times, especially under the Bantustan (Native Homelands) system of the nineteen seventy's and the nineteen eighty's, during which period people like the late Qwaqwa Homeland Prime Minister T.K.Mopeli, ruthlessly sought to and nearly achieved destroying the BaKholokoe Tribe! Much of the history written today states that Qwaqwa formerly known as Wetsieshoek was residence to only two Basotho tribes Bakoena and Batlokoa completely ignoring the presence of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe.\n\nLike many other tribes, Bakholokoe were dispossessed of their land leading to their traditional leaders, the Batlokoa traditional leaders and the then secretary of Bakholokoe traditional council  [[Josiah_Tshangana_Gumede|JT Gumede]] going to England in 1906 to protest the Bakhlokoe and Batlokoa losing their ancestral land to the former Boer republics. \n\nAs early as 1837 the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe tribe was already resident in the northern Free State around the Maluti region, Northern Natal around the Klip River region and the Vaal River region, notably the areas of the Witsieshoek district and the Harrismith district. In 1856 the Ba-Kholokoe, under Morena Wetsi, were forcefully dispossessed of this part of their territory by the Free State Dutch Government, on wholly unjustifiable pretenses, only two years after the Convention of Bloemfontein of 1854.\n\nIn 1866 Commandant C. de Villiers, also popularly known as Masoothonyane, who was then in charge of the Thaba Nchu, i.e. Harrismith district, and a member of the Volksraad, requested the tribes to assist the Free State Government in the war against Moshoeshoe. They rendered military service as the Free Burgher Natives, and their armed contingents were known as the \u2015Witlaps\u2016 and the \u2015Ringhals\u2016. The services were rendered firstly in consideration to secure and confirm the Tribes in free possession of the lands they then occupied, and secondly after successful conclusion of that war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 head of cattle to Commandant De Villiers acting for his Government, he agreed to the enlargement of the lands occupied by the Tribes. He, De Villiers actually promised them that the land, approximately 2130 square miles (551 667 hectares) - which the tribes were already occupying, would be secured for them. This is war talk, since in a way he was indirectly saying that this land that they were occupying could at any time be expropriated, if need be by forceful declaration and action, from them. \n\nAt least up to and according to the guarantees of the Proclamation of 1848, no land occupied by these Tribes had been encroached by any Europeans, so De Villiers appeared to be acting in good faith as based on that Proclamation. After the conclusion of the war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 cattle, it was agreed that all the land occupied mainly by two tribes, BaTlokoa and Ba-Kholokoe, who assisted Commandant De Villiers and the Boers in the war against Moshoeshoe, would then be given to them, after it has also been enlarged. There were three payments which were made for the purchase of three different areas of the land: 2450 cattle paid for the Halspruit area, made by the BaTlokoa tribe, 4000 cattle paid for the Klip Rivier area, the land situated in the Vrede and Harrismith Districts, also made by the BaTlokoa tribe, and 3000 cattle paid for the Mill River Valley in the Harrismith district, made by the Ba-Kholokoe tribe. The payments for the land of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe were made by Morena Lesisa Tsotetsi, who was representing heirs of Morena Letika and Morena Lesala, both who were the late Marena (Chiefs) of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. He paid the combined 6450 cattle for both the Halspruit and Klip Rivier areas, which were largely occupied by the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. The Halspruit area was home to the Ba-Tlokoa tribe under the late Morena Lesala, and the Klip Rivier area was under the late Morena Letika, both of whom were now represented by Morena Lesisa. The payment for the Mill River Valley land, which covered both Thabantsu and Witsieshoek districts of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe was made by Morena Letlatsa Moloi, who was representing heirs of the Late Morena Hlomise, son of the late Morena Oetsi (\u2015Witsie\u2016) of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe. However, in 1888 the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, after having received notice to leave the land, were forcibly evicted without any compensation. The struggle to regain their land had begun. \n\nChief Letlatsa Moloi of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe became a thorn in the flesh for Captain John Quayle Dickson, the Advisor for Native Affairs in the British Colonial Orange Free State government. On the 5th of September 1903, Captain John Quayle Dickson wrote to Sir Harry Smith from his office in Bloemfontein indicating that he had visited Thabantsu (Harrismith) where he and the Regional Magistrate of the Thaba Nchu territory had personally met and informed Paramount Chief Letlasa of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe that from then onwards he would be granted no special privileges whatsoever, and that he was now stripped of his position as one of the well-known and respected Morena oa Ba-Kholokoe, declaring him to be \u2015just another Native\u2016, and therefore from then in his opinion Paramount Chief Letlatsa will give no further trouble. Yet more trouble from the cheated and dispossessed tribes was coming! The boundaries of these areas were well defined as verified at the inquiry held in Harrismith by Captain John Quayle Dickson, Advisor for Native affairs, and Magistrate Leary, as reported in Captain Dickson's letter of 23rd June 1906. A Mr. F Van Reenen also testified to the fact that Commander De Villiers had cheated these native Chiefs in dealing with them, and when this was brought to the knowledge of the Free State government, it forced his resignation from the Volksraad.\n\n=== Battles fought by Ba/Ma-Kholokoe ===\n\nSome of the history states that Ba/Ma-Kholokoe were not great warriors but according to the battles fought, won and lost the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe were as good warriors as any other tribe that lived in that era. Many Battles were fought at Thaba Kholokoe, with Mzilikazi have attacked Ba/Ma-Kholokoe a number of times.\n\nIn 1821 the [https://www.wdl.org/en/item/3269/view/1/231/ battle between (Mahlapo) of Chief Mofeli and Ba/Ma-Kholokoe] under Chief Polane saw Polane and his Son Selotolotsa Killed, alongside many others and their cattle were taken.\n\nIn 1856/7 the battle of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe under Chief Wetsi/Oetsi and the Boers saw many Ba/Makholokoe killed in the cave while Wetsi managed to escape to Lesotho.\n\n=== Genealogical tree of Ba/Ma-kholokoe ===\n\n[[File:New Makholokoe (2).png|thumb|Updated family tree]]\n[[File:Genealogy Bakgatla.jpg|thumb|Genealogy of Bakgatla from Morolong]]\n\n=== Some of the notable Ba/Ma-kholokoe ===\n\n* [[Precious_Moloi-Motsepe|Dr Precious Moloi Motsepe]]\n* [[Teboho Moloi]]\n* Dr Matholela Lucas Moloi\n* Pabi Moloi\n* [[Timothy Moloi]]\n* Nchakha Moloi\n* Vusi Moloi\n* Godfrey Moloi\n* Lehasa Moloi\n* [[Lerato Moloi]]\n* Onicca Moloi\n* Nana Moloi\n* [[Thabo Moloi]]\n=== Sources ===\n\n* DIE MAKHOLOKOE STAMHOOFDE, DIE GEKOSE STAMHOOF \u2013\nLETSITSA (II) \u2013 MOJALEFA OA BORENA BA MAKHOLOKOE\u2016, as\nrecorded in 1429 by the QWAQWA PRINTERS.

The Ba/Ma-kholokoe are found in the Easter Free State (Harrismith, Wetsieshoek, Vrede, Kestel, etc.), Kwazulu/Natal(Nqutu) and Mpumalanga (Daggakraal, Amersfoort) as their historical residence. The Ba/Ma-kholokoe are the descendants of the originally Bantu-Speaking tribes from the central Congo region who migrated Southwards around 600 AD. They are the offspring of Bakgatla Chief Tabane and Mathulare daughter of the Bafokeng Chief. Tabane fathered five sons, Diale, Kgetsi, Kgwadi (Motl\u00f4kwa), Matsibolo/Matsiboho, and Mosia (in order of their birth).

Tabane first son from his senior wife Matlaisane remained with the Bakgatla ba Mot\u0161ha group, after Tabane concurred the Ba-Venda nation he married a Ba-Venda wife and fathered a son called Davhana who fathered Vele. \n\n=== History (Nalane) ===\n \nThe traditions of the Barolong kingdoms indicate that at some time in the past up until the leadership battles of the 14th Century they were all under the same rule of a line of kings who claimed descent from a common ancestor, Morolong.

This is where Ba/Ma-kholokoe lived for over 200 years, about eight to nine generations until the attacks of Matiwane in 1822, Mzilikazi in 1823 and is considered the birthplace of Ba/Ma-khlokoe. Some of the Ba/Ma-kholokoe Kings/Chief that lived in Thaba Kholokoe:\n- Kgetsi\n- Moloi\n- Hlabate\n- Sehoaba/Sehoele\n- Tyale\n- Tsholedi\n- Motsoane\n- Mokholoane\n- Matsemela\nFrom Thaba Kholokoe Ba/Ma-kholokoe spread to many areas around the Free State and Natal. One group under the leadership of Morena Wetsi (Oetsi) settled in today's Wetsieshoek, where many Ba/Ma-kholokoe were killed inside a [[Witsie's Cave (Lekhalong la Witsie)|cave]] during a war against the Boers. The kinship/chieftaincy of Bakholokoe has always been marked by disagreement and internal feuds, living the legacy for this leadership still in question to this day. \n\nAlthough many consider the totem of Ba/Ma-kholokoe as a [[:nso:Phuti|Phuthi]] (duiker), it is believed that this small antelope led Bakholokoe to safety during a war, there are some that say the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe totem is a porcupine [[Porcupine]].\n\n=== Land (Naha) ===\n \nAlthough one would love to hear the anecdotal side of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe history, it is unfortunately heavily clouded by the ever-present and festering issue of land and property dispossession and subsequent brutal oppression and painful suffering of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, first from the Dutch \u2015Boer\u2016 Government (Volksraad) of the Free State, and subsequently from the British Orange River Colony Administration and even in the modern times, especially under the Bantustan (Native Homelands) system of the nineteen seventy's and the nineteen eighty's, during which period people like the late Qwaqwa Homeland Prime Minister T.K.Mopeli, ruthlessly sought to and nearly achieved destroying the BaKholokoe Tribe!

The payment for the Mill River Valley land, which covered both Thabantsu and Witsieshoek districts of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe was made by Morena Letlatsa Moloi, who was representing heirs of the Late Morena Hlomise, son of the late Morena Oetsi (\u2015Witsie\u2016) of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe. However, in 1888 the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, after having received notice to leave the land, were forcibly evicted without any compensation. The struggle to regain their land had begun. \n\nChief Letlatsa Moloi of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe became a thorn in the flesh for Captain John Quayle Dickson, the Advisor for Native Affairs in the British Colonial Orange Free State government. On the 5th of September 1903, Captain John Quayle Dickson wrote to Sir Harry Smith from his office in Bloemfontein indicating that he had visited Thabantsu (Harrismith) where he and the Regional Magistrate of the Thaba Nchu territory had personally met and informed Paramount Chief Letlasa of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe that from then onwards he would be granted no special privileges whatsoever, and that he was now stripped of his position as one of the well-known and respected Morena oa Ba-Kholokoe, declaring him to be \u2015just another Native\u2016, and therefore from then in his opinion Paramount Chief Letlatsa will give no further trouble. Yet more trouble from the cheated and dispossessed tribes was coming! The boundaries of these areas were well defined as verified at the inquiry held in Harrismith by Captain John Quayle Dickson, Advisor for Native affairs, and Magistrate Leary, as reported in Captain Dickson's letter of 23rd June 1906. A Mr. F Van Reenen also testified to the fact that Commander De Villiers had cheated these native Chiefs in dealing with them, and when this was brought to the knowledge of the Free State government, it forced his resignation from the Volksraad.\n\n=== Battles fought by Ba/Ma-Kholokoe ===\n\nSome of the history states that Ba/Ma-Kholokoe were not great warriors but according to the battles fought, won and lost the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe were as good warriors as any other tribe that lived in that era. Many Battles were fought at Thaba Kholokoe, with Mzilikazi have attacked Ba/Ma-Kholokoe a number of times.\n\nIn 1821 the battle between (Mahlapo) of Chief Mofeli and Ba/Ma-Kholokoe under Chief Polane saw Polane and his Son Selotolotsa Killed, alongside many others and their cattle were taken.\n\nIn 1856/7 the battle of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe under Chief Wetsi/Oetsi and the Boers saw many Ba/Makholokoe killed in the cave while Wetsi managed to escape to Lesotho.\n\n=== Genealogical tree of Ba/Ma-kholokoe ===\n\n[[File:New Makholokoe (2).png|thumb|Updated family tree]]\n[[File:Genealogy Bakgatla.jpg|thumb|Genealogy of Bakgatla from Morolong]]\n\n=== Some of the notable Ba/Ma-kholokoe ===\n\n* [[Precious_Moloi-Motsepe|Dr Precious Moloi Motsepe]]\n* [[Teboho Moloi]]\n* Dr Matholela Lucas Moloi\n* Pabi Moloi\n* [[Timothy Moloi]]\n* Nchakha Moloi\n* Vusi Moloi\n* Godfrey Moloi\n* Lehasa Moloi\n* [[Lerato Moloi]]\n* Onicca Moloi\n* Nana Moloi\n* [[Thabo Moloi]]\n=== Sources ===\n\n* DIE MAKHOLOKOE STAMHOOFDE, DIE GEKOSE STAMHOOF \u2013\nLETSITSA (II) \u2013 MOJALEFA OA BORENA BA MAKHOLOKOE\u2016, as\nrecorded in 1429 by the QWAQWA PRINTERS.

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man. He later on moves to developing a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt wonder and awe; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. He desired that wonder and awe in his life. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare place on his body for a tattoo is his back; even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed, and in the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon, and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one, there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it, however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks, while the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice, and that he would have recommended something different. Parker then goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door, begging for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story closes with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions. The book thats in the hands seems to be a gospel book, and it has some jewels on it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\nParker\u2019s tattoo of the Byzantine Christ helps him to see the deeper mysteries of God. When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Parker's Back\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Flannery O'Connor]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Southern Gothic]]\n| published_in  = ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]''\n| publication_type = single author anthology\n| publisher     =\n| media_type    =\n| pub_date      = 1965\n| english_pub_date =\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n\"'''Parker's Back'''\" is a short story by American author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" was published in 1965 in her final short story collection, ''Everything That Rises Must Converge''.

Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare place on his body for a tattoo is his back; even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed, and in the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon, and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one, there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it, however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks, while the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice, and that he would have recommended something different. Parker then goes to a pool hall he has frequented in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door, begging for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story closes with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions. The book thats in the hands seems to be a gospel book, and it has some jewels on it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\nParker\u2019s tattoo of the Byzantine Christ helps him to see the deeper mysteries of God. When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "name_user": "Ravenabusjit", "label": "safe", "comment": "word choice", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker%27s_Back"}

The son of [[John, King of England|King John]] and [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame]], Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the [[First Barons' War]]. [[Cardinal Guala]] declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by [[William Marshal]], defeated the rebels at the battles of [[Battle of Lincoln (1217)|Lincoln]] and [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Sandwich]] in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the [[Magna Carta#Great Charter of 1225|Great Charter of 1225]], which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons.<!--Note: the 1225 date is correct in this context, and shouldn't be confused with the 1215 charter--> His early rule was dominated first by [[Hubert de Burgh]] and then [[Peter des Roches]], who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230, the King attempted to reconquer the [[Angevin Empire|provinces of France]] that had once belonged to his father, but [[English invasion of France (1230)|the invasion]] was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, [[Richard Marshal]], broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by [[Catholic Church|the Church]].\n\nFollowing the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite [[Castles in Great Britain and Ireland#Palace-fortresses|palaces and castles]]. He married [[Eleanor of Provence]], with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his [[piety]], holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of [[Edward the Confessor]], whom he adopted as his [[patron saint]]. He extracted huge sums of money from the [[Jews in England]], ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the [[Statute of Jewry]], attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he [[Saintonge War|invaded Poitou]] in 1242, leading to the disastrous [[Battle of Taillebourg]]. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Henry supported his brother [[Richard of Cornwall]] in his bid to become [[King of the Romans]] in 1256, but was unable to place his own son [[Edmund Crouchback]] on the throne of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on [[crusade]] to the [[Levant]], but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in [[Gascony]].\n\nBy 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his [[Poitiers|Poitevin]] half-brothers, the [[Lusignans]], as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the [[Provisions of Oxford]]. Henry and the baronial government enacted a [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|peace with France]] in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for [[King Louis IX]] recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued.\n\nIn 1263, one of the more radical barons, [[Simon de Montfort]], seized power, resulting in the [[Second Barons' War]]. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The [[Battle of Lewes]] occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, [[Edward I of England|Edward]], escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the [[Battle of Evesham]] the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the [[Dictum of Kenilworth]]. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290. Some [[miracle]]s were declared after his death; however, he was not [[canonised]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background and childhood==\n{{main|Angevin Empire|First Barons' War}}\n[[File:Angevin empire in France c. 1200 (simplified).png|thumb|alt=A coloured map of medieval France, showing the Angevin territories in France|King [[John of England|John]]'s lands in France, c. 1200]]\nHenry was born in [[Winchester Castle]] on 1 October 1207.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|pp=45\u201346}}</ref> He was the eldest son of [[John, King of England|King John]] and [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=45}}</ref> Little is known of Henry's early life.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=46}}; {{harvnb|Cole|2002|p=230}}</ref> He was initially looked after by a [[wet nurse]] called Ellen in the south of England, away from John's itinerant court, and probably had close ties to his mother.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=46}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207\u20131272) |website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Henry had four legitimate younger brothers and sisters \u2013 [[Richard of Cornwall|Richard]], [[Joan of England, Queen of Scotland|Joan]], [[Isabella of England|Isabella]] and [[Eleanor of England, Countess of Leicester|Eleanor]] \u2013 and various older illegitimate siblings.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=47}}</ref> In 1212 his education was entrusted to [[Peter des Roches]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]]; under his direction, Henry was given military training by Philip D'Aubigny and taught to ride, probably by Ralph of St Samson.<ref name=ODNB>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207\u20131272) |website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nLittle is known about Henry's appearance; he was probably around {{convert|1.68|m}} tall, and accounts recorded after his death suggested that he had a strong build, with a [[Ptosis (eyelid)|drooping eyelid]].<ref name=ODNB/>{{efn|The description of Henry's eyelid, written after his death, comes from the chronicler [[Nicholas Trevet]].

[[Cardinal Guala]] declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by [[William Marshal]], defeated the rebels at the battles of [[Battle of Lincoln (1217)|Lincoln]] and [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Sandwich]] in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the [[Magna Carta#Great Charter of 1225|Great Charter of 1225]], which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons.<!--Note: the 1225 date is correct in this context, and shouldn't be confused with the 1215 charter--> His early rule was dominated first by [[Hubert de Burgh]] and then [[Peter des Roches]], who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230, the King attempted to reconquer the [[Angevin Empire|provinces of France]] that had once belonged to his father, but [[English invasion of France (1230)|the invasion]] was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, [[Richard Marshal]], broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by [[Catholic Church|the Church]].\n\nFollowing the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite [[Castles in Great Britain and Ireland#Palace-fortresses|palaces and castles]]. He married [[Eleanor of Provence]], with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his [[piety]], holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of [[Edward the Confessor]], whom he adopted as his [[patron saint]]. He extracted huge sums of money from the [[Jews in England]], ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the [[Statute of Jewry]], attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he [[Saintonge War|invaded Poitou]] in 1242, leading to the disastrous [[Battle of Taillebourg]]. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Henry supported his brother [[Richard of Cornwall]] in his bid to become [[King of the Romans]] in 1256, but was unable to place his own son [[Edmund Crouchback]] on the throne of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on [[crusade]] to the [[Levant]], but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in [[Gascony]].\n\nBy 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his [[Poitiers|Poitevin]] half-brothers, the [[Lusignans]], as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the [[Provisions of Oxford]]. Henry and the baronial government enacted a [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|peace with France]] in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for [[King Louis IX]] recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued.\n\nIn 1263, one of the more radical barons, [[Simon de Montfort]], seized power, resulting in the [[Second Barons' War]]. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The [[Battle of Lewes]] occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, [[Edward I of England|Edward]], escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the [[Battle of Evesham]] the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the [[Dictum of Kenilworth]]. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290. Some [[miracle]]s were declared after his death; however, he was not [[canonised]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background and childhood==\n{{main|Angevin Empire|First Barons' War}}\n[[File:Angevin empire in France c. 1200 (simplified).png|thumb|alt=A coloured map of medieval France, showing the Angevin territories in France|King [[John of England|John]]'s lands in France, c. 1200]]\nHenry was born in [[Winchester Castle]] on 1 October 1207.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|pp=45\u201346}}</ref> He was the eldest son of [[John, King of England|King John]] and [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=45}}</ref> Little is known of Henry's early life.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=46}}; {{harvnb|Cole|2002|p=230}}</ref> He was initially looked after by a [[wet nurse]] called Ellen in the south of England, away from John's itinerant court, and probably had close ties to his mother.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=46}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207\u20131272) |website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Henry had four legitimate younger brothers and sisters \u2013 [[Richard of Cornwall|Richard]], [[Joan of England, Queen of Scotland|Joan]], [[Isabella of England|Isabella]] and [[Eleanor of England, Countess of Leicester|Eleanor]] \u2013 and various older illegitimate siblings.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=47}}</ref> In 1212 his education was entrusted to [[Peter des Roches]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]]; under his direction, Henry was given military training by Philip D'Aubigny and taught to ride, probably by Ralph of St Samson.<ref name=ODNB>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207\u20131272) |website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nLittle is known about Henry's appearance; he was probably around {{convert|1.68|m}} tall, and accounts recorded after his death suggested that he had a strong build, with a [[Ptosis (eyelid)|drooping eyelid]].<ref name=ODNB/>{{efn|The description of Henry's eyelid, written after his death, comes from the chronicler [[Nicholas Trevet]].
