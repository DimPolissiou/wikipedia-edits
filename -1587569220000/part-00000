R. R. Tolkien]]. She is an elf, daughter of [[Thingol]] and Melian. He is a mortal man. They appear in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', the [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[The Lay of Leithian]]'', the Grey Annals section of ''[[The War of the Jewels]]'', and in other texts in [[Tolkien's legendarium]]. Their story is told to [[Frodo]] by [[Aragorn]] in  ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\nThe story of L\u00fathien and Beren, immortal elf marrying mortal man and choosing mortality for herself, is mirrored in Tolkien's ''[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]''. Their names appear on the grave of Tolkien and his wife Edith.\n\n==Context==\n\nL\u00fathien was a [[Teleri]]n ([[Sindar]]in) [[princess]], the only child of [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]], king of [[Doriath]], and his queen, Melian the [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maia]], making her half-royal, half-divine. She was born in the [[Years of the Trees]], according to the [[Grey Annals]]. At her birth, the white flower ''niphredil'' bloomed for the first time in Doriath.\nL\u00fathien's romance with the [[Man (Middle-earth)|mortal man]] [[Beren]] is considered the \"chief\" of the Silmarillion tales by Tolkien himself. [[Elrond]] was L\u00fathien's great-grandson and [[Aragorn]] was descended from her via Elros and the Royal Family of [[N\u00famenor]]. She is described as the Morning Star of the Elves and as the most beautiful daughter of the one god, [[Il\u00favatar]]. \n\nIn contrast, L\u00fathien's descendant [[Arwen]] was called ''Evenstar'', the Evening Star of the Elves, meaning that her beauty reflects that of L\u00fathien Tin\u00faviel. L\u00fathien was first cousin once removed of [[Galadriel]], whose mother, E\u00e4rwen of [[Alqualond\u00eb]], was the daughter of Thingol's brother. The story of L\u00fathien and Beren is mirrored in ''[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]''.<ref name=\"Tale\" group=T>{{cite book |last=Tolkien |first=J. R. R. |authorlink=J. R. R.

He stood in the shadows wishing to be near enough to L\u00fathien to touch her, but Daeron, her childhood friend and partner in music and dance, noticed Beren and, believing him to be a wild animal, shouted for L\u00fathien to flee. At first she stood unmoving, as she had never experienced fear or pain. Then she saw Beren's shadow and ran away. But as she hid in the foliage, Beren touched her arm. L\u00fathien ran away in shock, believing it to be an animal stalking her in the woods. He longed for her, calling her Tin\u00faviel. One day in summer when L\u00fathien was dancing on a green hill surrounded by hemlocks,<ref>{{citeweb |url=https://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2017/06/01/tolkien-hemlock/ |title=Beren and L\u00fathien and the hemlock glade |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=29 November 2018}}</ref> she sang, awakening Beren from his enchantment. He ran to her, and again she tried to escape and he cried \"Tin\u00faviel\". When L\u00fathien gazed upon him for the first time she reciprocated his love. He kissed her on the lips, but she slipped away and he fell into a deep sleep of grief and bliss. In his hour of despair, she appeared before him, and in the Hidden Kingdom set her hand in his and cradled his head against her breast. From then on they met secretly.\n\n===The quest of the Silmaril===\n\nThis joy did not last. Daeron, who also loved her, reported her meeting with Beren to her father.\nThough Melian warned her husband against it, Thingol was determined not to let Beren marry his daughter, and set a seemingly impossible task as the [[bride price]]: Beren had to bring him one of the [[Silmaril]]s from [[Morgoth]]'s Iron Crown. Thingol did not kill Beren outright as he had promised L\u00fathien that he would spare Beren's life.\n\n===Vision and imprisonment===\n\nL\u00fathien had a vision of Beren lying suffering in the hellish pits of the Lord of Wolves, and horror weighed upon her heart. She sought the counsel of her mother who told her that Beren was captive in the dungeons of [[Sauron]], the Dark Lord's evil lieutenant. L\u00fathien decided to save Beren. She asked Daeron for help, but he betrayed her to Thingol. To keep her safe, the King had her guarded in the high branches of a great beech tree. Daeron was filled with remorse. L\u00fathien forgave him, and devised a plan to escape. Using her magical power, L\u00fathien enchanted her hair into a cloak to lull her guards to sleep, and ran from her prison.\n\n{{anchor|Huan}}\nOn her way to rescue Beren, she found Huan, the Hound of [[Valinor]], and was taken to his master Celegorm. He, plotting to force her to marry him, offered to help her, asking her to follow him to [[Nargothrond]]. When she arrived, Celegorm held her hostage and forbade her to talk to anyone else. Huan took pity on her, betraying his master, and freed her. Huan was granted the power to speak, and together they escaped from Nargothrond.\n\nThey came to Sauron's Isle, and L\u00fathien sang a call to Beren. He answered, thinking it his imagination. Sauron, also hearing her song, sought to catch her, sending wolf after wolf to slay Huan, but each time the hound killed them. Finally going himself, Sauron transformed into the most powerful of all werewolves. Huan flinched, but L\u00fathien smothered Sauron's lunge in the folds of her enchanted cloak. Sauron changed into different shapes, but Huan bested him. L\u00fathien forced the defeated Sauron to surrender the keys of his tower; he fled in the shape of a vampire.\n\nL\u00fathien destroyed the Tower and freed its prisoners. Finding Beren, she thought him dead and fell down beside him in grief, but with the rising sun he awoke and they were reunited. Huan returned to his master Celegorm, and the couple walked the woods once more in joy.\n\n===Celegorm, Curufin and the dance of L\u00fathien before Morgoth===\n\nBeren pleaded with L\u00fathien to return to her father, but she refused. As they were about to embrace, Celegorm and Curufin appeared, exiled because of L\u00fathien's escape from Nargothrond. Seeking revenge, they fought Beren, and Huan again fought on L\u00fathien's side. Beren defeated them, but spared their lives at L\u00fathien's request. Beren stole one of their horses, but as the couple fled, Curufin shot at L\u00fathien. Beren jumped in front of the arrow to save her. By L\u00fathien's magic and love Beren was restored to life. As she slept he went to [[Angband (Middle-earth)|Angband]] to get the Silmaril.\n\nWhen L\u00fathien discovered Beren had left, she and Huan disguised themselves as Thuringwethil, the vampire servant of Morgoth, and Draugluin the Werewolf. She found Beren and joined his quest. At the gates of Angband they encountered the mighty werewolf Carcharoth. L\u00fathien forced him into a deep sleep. Together Beren and Luthien reached the Throne of Morgoth, but the Dark Lord saw through L\u00fathien's disguise. She declared herself and offered to sing for Morgoth. Filled with an evil lust, he accepted, and she put him and his entire court into a deep sleep, sealed with her cloak over Morgoth's eyes. She awakened Beren, and he cut a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown. However, as he tried for another Silmaril, his blade snapped, striking Morgoth's cheek and awakening him. L\u00fathien and Beren fled to the gates, where Carcharoth attacked them. Beren thrust the Silmaril into the wolf's face, but the wolf bit off Beren's hand and swallowed the Silmaril. L\u00fathien was left cradling a mortally wounded Beren in her arms, with the hosts of Angband on her heels. L\u00fathien sucked out the venom, and with her failing power tried to restore Beren. Just when all hope seemed lost, the [[Eagles of Manw\u00eb]] snatched them into the sky at the summons of Huan, carrying them to safety in Doriath.\n\n===Return to Doriath and death of Beren===\n\nL\u00fathien waited by Beren's side and healed him. Then together they entered and stood before the throne of L\u00fathien's father. Beren told Thingol that the quest was, indeed, fulfilled, and that he held a Silmaril in his hand. When Thingol demanded to see it, Beren showed him his stump. When he heard their story he was amazed and thought Beren to be above all other mortal men. They were married before Thingol's throne that day. Meanwhile, Carcharoth was ravaging all living beings on the borders of Doriath, empowered and enraged by the burning jewel in his stomach. Beren, Thingol, Huan, and other Elves went to defeat the beast. Beren was assaulted by the wolf; Huan leaped to his aid and killed the beast, but died soon afterwards of his wounds. Beren was carried to Doriath, where he died in L\u00fathien's arms.\n\n===L\u00fathien becomes mortal for Beren===\n\nIn grief, L\u00fathien lay down and died, going to the Halls of [[Mandos]], Lord of the Dead.{{efn|There the spirits of dead Elves await re-embodiment in Valinor; the spirits of dead Men await their departure from the circles of the world.}} There she sang a song of woe before the throne of Mandos, of the tribulations and suffering of both Elves and Men, the greatest ever sung, so touching that Mandos was moved to pity for the only time. He summoned Beren from the houses of the dead, and L\u00fathien's spirit met his for the last time by the shores of the sea. Mandos consulted with [[Manw\u00eb]], King of [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]]. Even Manw\u00eb could not change the fate of Men, and so he presented L\u00fathien with the only choice possible: to live in the immortal land of Valinor, where she could forget all her grief and enjoy eternal happiness along with her people and the [[Valar]], but without Beren; or to return to Middle-earth with Beren as a mortal herself, accepting the Doom of Men. She chose mortality, relinquishing everything for Beren.\n\nTogether in their new bodies, they returned to Doriath and released the winter of Thingol, who had been in grieving ever since his daughter's death. But Melian could not look at first into her daughter's eyes, since she could see the doom of mortality written in them.\n\n===Return to life, and death===\n\nL\u00fathien and [[Beren]] dwelt together in Ossiriand until after the sack of [[Menegroth]]. Their abode was known as ''Dor Firn-i-Guinar'': the \"Land of the Dead that Lived\". They had a son, Dior, called Eluch\u00edl \u2014 the heir of [[Thingol]].\n\nYears later, Thingol received the Nauglam\u00edr from [[H\u00farin]], who had recovered it from the ruins of [[Nargothrond]] after the departure of Glaurung the dragon. Thingol decided to unite the greatest works of the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] and the Elves, and recruited Dwarf smiths from Nogrod to complete his plan. Thingol was murdered by the Dwarves, who plundered Thingol's treasuries and took the Nauglam\u00edr. Beren and an army of Green Elves and [[Ent]]s waylaid the returning Dwarf army. Beren reclaimed the Nauglam\u00edr, and L\u00fathien kept the necklace and the great jewel all her life. The beauty of L\u00fathien combined with the splendour of the gem and necklace made her home of Tol Galen the fairest land east of Valinor, but the [[Silmaril]] hastened Beren's and L\u00fathien's end, since her beauty enhanced by the jewel was too bright for mortal lands to bear. \n\nThe Nauglam\u00edr was delivered to her son Dior. While L\u00fathien wore the necklace no one dared assail her, but when Dior took it the Sons of F\u00ebanor ransacked the kingdom of Doriath and slew Dior and his wife Nimloth.\n\n[[Elrond]] the Half-elven and [[Arwen]] Evenstar were descendants of L\u00fathien, as was [[Aragorn]], a descendant of Elrond's brother Elros. According to legend, her line would never be broken.\n\n===Heraldic emblem===\nTolkien's colour drawing of L\u00fathien's heraldic emblem features on the front cover of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'''s first edition.\n\n==Earlier versions==\nIn the various versions of ''The Tale of Tin\u00faviel'', Tolkien's earliest form of his tale, as published in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', her original name is ''Tin\u00faviel'' (''L\u00fathien'' was invented later). Beren is, in this earlier version, an ''Elf'' (specifically a [[Noldor|Noldo]], or ''Gnome''), and Sauron has not yet emerged. In his place, they face '''Tevildo''', the Prince of Cats, a monstrous cat who is the principal enemy of the [[Valinor]]ean hound [[Huan (Middle-earth)|Huan]]. However Tolkien initially created the character of Beren as a mortal man before this in an even earlier but erased version of the tale.\n\nThe story is also told in an epic poem in ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'', upon which most of the finer details of her life and relationship to Beren is extracted from in this article, since ''The Silmarillion'' provides only a generalization of the tale.\n\n==Inspirations==\nIn a letter to his son Christopher, dated 11 July 1972, Tolkien requested the inscription below for his wife [[Edith Tolkien|Edith]]'s grave \"for she was (and knew she was) my L\u00fathien.\"<ref>{{ME-ref|Letters|#340}}</ref> He added, \"I never called Edith ''Luthien'' &mdash; but she was the source of the story.... It was first conceived in a small woodland glade filled with hemlocks at Roos in Yorkshire where ... she was able to live with me for a while.\" In a footnote to this letter, Tolkien added \"she knew the earliest form of the legend...also the poem eventually printed as Aragorn's song.\" Particularly affecting for Tolkien was Edith's conversion to the [[Catholic Church]] from the [[Church of England]] for his sake upon their marriage; this was a difficult decision for her that caused her much hardship, paralleling the difficulties and suffering of L\u00fathien from choosing mortality.\n\nThe name may be derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''lufian'', which means ''love''. [[The Tale of Beren and L\u00fathien]] also shares an element with folktales such as the Welsh [[Culhwch and Olwen]] and others \u2014 namely, the disapproving parent who sets a seemingly impossible task (or tasks) for the suitor, which is then fulfilled.\n\n==The Tolkien grave==\n[[File:Tolkiengrab.jpg|thumb|Grave of Edith and J. R. R. Tolkien]]\n\nEdith and J.R.R. Tolkien lie in [[Wolvercote Cemetery]] in north Oxford.  Their gravestone shows the association of L\u00fathien with Edith, and Tolkien with Beren.

Beren was carried to Doriath, where he died in L\u00fathien's arms.\n\n===L\u00fathien becomes mortal for Beren===\n\nIn grief, L\u00fathien lay down and died, going to the Halls of [[Mandos]], Lord of the Dead.{{efn|There the spirits of dead Elves await re-embodiment in Valinor; the spirits of dead Men await their departure from the circles of the world.}} There she sang a song of woe before the throne of Mandos, of the tribulations and suffering of both Elves and Men, the greatest ever sung, so touching that Mandos was moved to pity for the only time. He summoned Beren from the houses of the dead, and L\u00fathien's spirit met his for the last time by the shores of the sea. Mandos consulted with [[Manw\u00eb]], King of [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]]. Even Manw\u00eb could not change the fate of Men, and so he presented L\u00fathien with the only choice possible: to live in the immortal land of Valinor, where she could forget all her grief and enjoy eternal happiness along with her people and the [[Valar]], but without Beren; or to return to Middle-earth with Beren as a mortal herself, accepting the Doom of Men. She chose mortality, relinquishing everything for Beren.\n\nTogether in their new bodies, they returned to Doriath and released the winter of Thingol, who had been in grieving ever since his daughter's death. But Melian could not look at first into her daughter's eyes, since she could see the doom of mortality written in them.\n\n===Return to life, and death===\n\nL\u00fathien and [[Beren]] dwelt together in Ossiriand until after the sack of [[Menegroth]]. Their abode was known as ''Dor Firn-i-Guinar'': the \"Land of the Dead that Lived\". They had a son, Dior, called Eluch\u00edl \u2014 the heir of [[Thingol]].\n\nYears later, Thingol received the Nauglam\u00edr from [[H\u00farin]], who had recovered it from the ruins of [[Nargothrond]] after the departure of Glaurung the dragon. Thingol decided to unite the greatest works of the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] and the Elves, and recruited Dwarf smiths from Nogrod to complete his plan. Thingol was murdered by the Dwarves, who plundered Thingol's treasuries and took the Nauglam\u00edr. Beren and an army of Green Elves and [[Ent]]s waylaid the returning Dwarf army. Beren reclaimed the Nauglam\u00edr, and L\u00fathien kept the necklace and the great jewel all her life. The beauty of L\u00fathien combined with the splendour of the gem and necklace made her home of Tol Galen the fairest land east of Valinor, but the [[Silmaril]] hastened Beren's and L\u00fathien's end, since her beauty enhanced by the jewel was too bright for mortal lands to bear. \n\nThe Nauglam\u00edr was delivered to her son Dior. While L\u00fathien wore the necklace no one dared assail her, but when Dior took it the Sons of F\u00ebanor ransacked the kingdom of Doriath and slew Dior and his wife Nimloth.\n\n[[Elrond]] the Half-elven and [[Arwen]] Evenstar were descendants of L\u00fathien, as was [[Aragorn]], a descendant of Elrond's brother Elros. According to legend, her line would never be broken.\n\n===Heraldic emblem===\nTolkien's colour drawing of L\u00fathien's heraldic emblem features on the front cover of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'''s first edition.\n\n==Earlier versions==\nIn the various versions of ''The Tale of Tin\u00faviel'', Tolkien's earliest form of his tale, as published in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', her original name is ''Tin\u00faviel'' (''L\u00fathien'' was invented later). Beren is, in this earlier version, an ''Elf'' (specifically a [[Noldor|Noldo]], or ''Gnome''), and Sauron has not yet emerged. In his place, they face '''Tevildo''', the Prince of Cats, a monstrous cat who is the principal enemy of the [[Valinor]]ean hound [[Huan (Middle-earth)|Huan]]. However Tolkien initially created the character of Beren as a mortal man before this in an even earlier but erased version of the tale.\n\nThe story is also told in an epic poem in ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'', upon which most of the finer details of her life and relationship to Beren is extracted from in this article, since ''The Silmarillion'' provides only a generalization of the tale.\n\n==Inspirations==\nIn a letter to his son Christopher, dated 11 July 1972, Tolkien requested the inscription below for his wife [[Edith Tolkien|Edith]]'s grave \"for she was (and knew she was) my L\u00fathien.\"<ref>{{ME-ref|Letters|#340}}</ref> He added, \"I never called Edith ''Luthien'' &mdash; but she was the source of the story.... It was first conceived in a small woodland glade filled with hemlocks at Roos in Yorkshire where ... she was able to live with me for a while.\" In a footnote to this letter, Tolkien added \"she knew the earliest form of the legend...also the poem eventually printed as Aragorn's song.\" Particularly affecting for Tolkien was Edith's conversion to the [[Catholic Church]] from the [[Church of England]] for his sake upon their marriage; this was a difficult decision for her that caused her much hardship, paralleling the difficulties and suffering of L\u00fathien from choosing mortality.\n\nThe name may be derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''lufian'', which means ''love''. [[The Tale of Beren and L\u00fathien]] also shares an element with folktales such as the Welsh [[Culhwch and Olwen]] and others \u2014 namely, the disapproving parent who sets a seemingly impossible task (or tasks) for the suitor, which is then fulfilled.\n\n==The Tolkien grave==\n[[File:Tolkiengrab.jpg|thumb|Grave of Edith and J. R. R. Tolkien]]\n\nEdith and J.R.R. Tolkien lie in [[Wolvercote Cemetery]] in north Oxford.  Their gravestone shows the association of L\u00fathien with Edith, and Tolkien with Beren. The stone reads: \n\n{{Quote box|width=20%|align=center|quote=<center>+<br/> Edith Mary Tolkien <br/> '''L\u00fathien''' <br/> 1889\u20131971 <br/> John Ronald <br/> Reuel Tolkien <br/> '''Beren ''' <br/> 1892\u20131973 </center>}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Primary===\n::''This list identifies each item's location in Tolkien's writings.''\n{{reflist|group=T|28em}}\n\n===Secondary===\n{{reflist|28em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110108060356/http://tednasmith.com/silmarillion/TN-Luthien.html ''L\u00fathien''] as illustrated by [[Ted Nasmith]]\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.tor.com/2016/09/14/luthien-tolkiens-badass-elf-princess/ |title=L\u00fathien: Tolkien's Badass Elf Princess |first=Jeff |last=LaSala |work=[[Tor.com]] |date=September 14, 2016 |accessdate=September 22, 2016}}\n\n{{Middle-earth}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Luthien}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1977]]\n[[Category:Fictional princesses]]\n[[Category:Grey Elves]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth Half-elven]]\n[[Category:Teleri]]\n", "name_user": "Chiswick Chap", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEtymology:it", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BAthien_and_Beren"}

Not only was the barred owl found to be a surprisingly routine predator at woodland passerine nests, but that an unexpected bulk of the acts of predation in studies from Missouri and Illinois were carried out during the daytime. Many different forest bird species (most frequently in Missouri and Illinois on [[acadian flycatcher]]s (''Empidonax virescens'') and [[indigo bunting]]s (''Passerina cyanea'')) were thusly hunted. These studies indicated that the barred owl may snatch passerines of any age, but recent fledglings are taken preferentially due to their often more conspicuous behavior and lacking ability for flighted escape. In Minnesota, about 62% of studied [[hermit thrush]] (''Catharus guttatus'') and [[ovenbird]] (''Seiurus aurocapilla'') fledglings were taken per one study, with all thrush that nested in the {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} radius of the barred owl\u2019s nests failing to produce any young.

In seldom cases, a very inexperienced person has mistaken the barred owl for these species, however.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Earley/> On the fringes of its distribution (west, north and south), however, the barred owl may overlap slightly in range with other species from the ''Strix'' genus, which all share the same general form. A close cousin, the [[fulvous owl]] (''Strix fulvescens'') may range north into [[Mexico]] where the southernmost barred owls may persist, however so far as is known, their respective distributions are entirely and considerably [[Allopatric speciation|allopatric]].

The great grey species usually appears considerably larger than the barred owl (although there is considerable overlap in body mass) and much more solidly dark gray with a much larger, fairly [[bulbous]] head and relatively small yellow eyes.<ref name= Konig/><ref name= Weidensaul/> The [[mottled owl]] (''Ciccaba virgata'') may or may not overlap with barred owls near the Mexico-Texas borderlands.

Not only was the barred owl found to be a surprisingly routine predator at woodland passerine nests, but that an unexpected bulk of the acts of predation in studies from Missouri and Illinois were carried out during the daytime. Many different forest bird species (most frequently in Missouri and Illinois on [[acadian flycatcher]]s (''Empidonax virescens'') and [[indigo bunting]]s (''Passerina cyanea'')) were thusly hunted. These studies indicated that the barred owl may snatch passerines of any age, but recent fledglings are taken preferentially due to their often more conspicuous behavior and lacking ability for flighted escape. In Minnesota, about 62% of studied [[hermit thrush]] (''Catharus guttatus'') and [[ovenbird]] (''Seiurus aurocapilla'') fledglings were taken per one study, with all thrush that nested in the {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} radius of the barred owl\u2019s nests failing to produce any young. A similarly high rate of local determent by barred owls has been found for other woodland thrushes like the [[veery]] (''Catharus fuscescens''), the [[wood thrush]] (''Hylocichla mustelina'') and the [[varied thrush]] (''Ixoreus naevius''), with the additional finding that pre-dawn singing by certain thrushes, when their escape abilities are dulled by the dim light, endangers them to barred owl ambushes.<ref name= Takats/><ref name= Gill>Gill, R.

Olympia, WA: Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.</ref> The removal program would, during its first year, result in the death of 36 times more [[Raptor (bird)|raptors]] than in all other conservation-based projects combined in the United States and its territories, and 84 times more raptors than in the largest ongoing effort worldwide, at a cost of $1 million annually; simplifying the cost to dollars per barred owl killed approximates $700 per barred owl for the first year and $2800 per barred owl for each subsequent year.<ref name= Livezey/> Many environmentalists fear increased blame on barred owls for declining spotted owl numbers will result in less attention being paid to territorial protection and resumption of logging in protected spotted owl habitat.<ref name= Livezey/><ref name= Livezey4/> Even if the barred owl is entirely eradicated from areas of sympatry, some authors have considered that the ceaseless threats of habitat loss and [[global warming]] would still quite possibly lead to the extinction of the northern spotted owl.<ref name= Evers/>\n\n==In art==\n[[John James Audubon]] illustrated the barred owl in ''[[Birds of America (book)|Birds of America]]'' (published, London 1827\u201338) as Plate 46 where it is shown threatening a [[eastern gray squirrel|grey squirrel]].
