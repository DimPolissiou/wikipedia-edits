While their ship is trapped in the ice of the [[Arctic Sea]], the crew discovers a man, Victor Frankenstein, traveling across the Arctic on his own. Victor proceeds to tell Walton and the crew his life story.\n\nVictor grows up in [[Geneva]] with his adopted sister, [[Elizabeth Lavenza]], who will become the love of his life. Before he leaves for the university at [[Ingolstadt]], Victor's mother dies giving birth to his brother William. Traumatized by grief afterward, Victor vows on his mother's grave that he will find a way to conquer death. However, he is shunned by his peers, who view him as a madman. Eventually, he and his friend Henry Clerval meet [[Doctor Waldman|Shmael Augustus Waldman]], a professor whose notes contain information on how to create life; Waldman warns Victor not to use them lest he create an \"abomination\".\n\nWhile performing vaccinations, Waldman is murdered by a stubborn patient, who is later hanged in the village square. Using the body, a leg from a fellow student named Schiller who's died from [[cholera]], and Waldman's brain, Victor builds a creature based on the professor's notes. He is so obsessed with his work that he drives Elizabeth away when she comes to take him away as Ingolstadt is being put into quarantine. Victor finally gives his creation life, but soon regrets his decision and tries to kill it with an axe; the creature steals his coat and is driven away by the townspeople when it tries to steal food.\n\nThe creature escapes, running off to the wilderness. He spends months living in a family's barn without their knowledge, gradually learning to read and speak based on observations and memories from Waldman's brain. He attempts to earn the family's trust by anonymously helping them with their failing farm, and eventually converses with the patriarch, an elderly blind man, after murdering an abusive debt collector. But when the blind man's family returns, they attack the creature and abandon their farm. The creature finds Victor's journal in his coat, and learns of the circumstances of his creation. He burns down the farm and vows revenge on his creator.\n\nVictor, who believes the creature to be dead from the cholera epidemic, returns to Geneva to marry Elizabeth. He finds his younger brother William has been murdered. Justine, a servant of the Frankenstein household, is inadvertently framed for the crime by the creature and hanged by a [[Lynching|lynch mob]] before anyone can prove her innocence. The creature abducts Victor and demands that he make a companion for him, promising to leave his creator in peace in return. Victor begins gathering the tools he used to create life, but when the creature insists he use Justine's body to make the companion, Victor breaks his promise and the creature exacts his revenge, strangling Baron Frankenstein and tearing out Elizabeth's heart.\n\nMaddened with grief beyond measure, Victor races home to bring Elizabeth back to life. He stitches Elizabeth's head onto Justine's fully intact body, and she awakes as a re-animated creature. The two are briefly and happily reunited until the creature appears, demanding Elizabeth as his bride. Victor and the monster fight for Elizabeth's affections, but Elizabeth, horrified by what she has become, commits suicide by [[self-immolation|setting herself on fire]], burning the mansion to the ground.\n\nThe story returns to the Arctic Circle. Victor tells Walton that he has been pursuing his creation for months to kill him. Soon after relating his story, Victor dies from [[pneumonia]]. Walton discovers the creature weeping over Victor's body, confessing that for all his hatred, he still considers Victor to be his \"father\". The crew prepares a funeral pyre, but the ceremony is interrupted when the ice around the ship cracks. Walton invites the creature to stay with the ship, but the creature insists on remaining with the pyre. He takes the torch and burns himself alive with Victor's body. Walton, having seen the consequences of Victor's obsession, orders the ship to return home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as [[Frankenstein's monster|The Creation]], the product of an experiment with corpses and electricity.

It's kind of like the movie I wrote, but not at all like the movie I wrote. It has no patience for subtlety. It has no patience for the quiet moments. It has no patience period. It's big and loud and blunt and rephrased by the director at every possible turn. Cumulatively, the effect was a totally different movie. I don't know why Branagh needed to make this big, loud film ... the material was subtle. Shelley's book was way out there in a lot of ways, but it's also very subtle. I don't know why it had to be this operatic attempt at filmmaking. Shelley's book is not operatic, it whispers at you a lot. The movie was a bad one. That was my Waterloo. That's where I really got my ass kicked most as a screenwriter ... [Branagh] really took the brunt of the blame for that film, which was appropriate. That movie was his vision entirely.

He displays neither the technical finesse to handle a big, visually ambitious film nor the insight to develop a stirring new version of this story. Instead, this is a bland, no-fault ''Frankenstein'' for the '90s, short on villainy but loaded with the tragically misunderstood.

Mexican driver [[Pablo S\u00e1nchez L\u00f3pez]], fielded by [[Alan Racing Team]], scored four wins and secured the third place in the championship. For the 2010 season more teams switched to the Mygale chassis. But after a disappointing season with no wins for the Mygale chassis most teams returned to the Van Diemen chassis. The height of success for Mygale in Formula 3 was achieved in 2012. [[Riccardo Agostini]] driving the only Mygale chassis won the Italian championship winning 5 races. As the European market diminished Mygale began to export cars to Australia.

After listing several euphemisms for death (\"is no more\", \"has ceased to be\", \"bereft of life, it rests in peace\", and \"this is an ex-parrot\") he is told to go to the pet shop run by the shopkeeper's brother in [[Bolton]] for a refund. That proves difficult, as the proprietor of that store (who is really the shopkeeper, save for a fake moustache) claims this is [[Ipswich]], whereas the railway station attendant ([[Terry Jones]]) claims he is actually in Bolton after all.<ref name=AllTheWords-p104/>\n\nConfronting the shopkeeper's \"brother\" for lying, the shopkeeper claims he was playing a prank on Praline by sending him to Ipswich, which was a [[palindrome]] for Bolton; Praline points out that the shopkeeper was wrong because a palindrome for Bolton would have been \"Notlob\".<ref name=\u201cMcCabe\u201d/>\n\nJust as Praline has decided that \"this is getting too silly\", Graham Chapman's no-nonsense [[The Colonel (Monty Python)|Colonel]] bursts in and orders the sketch stopped.<ref name=AllTheWords-p104/>\n== Background ==\nThe \"Dead Parrot\" sketch was inspired by a \"Car Salesman\" sketch that Palin and Chapman had done in ''[[How to Irritate People]]''. In it, Palin played a [[car salesman]] who repeatedly refused to admit that there was anything wrong with his customer's (Chapman) car, even as it fell apart in front of him. That sketch was based on an actual incident between Palin and a car salesman.<ref>{{cite book |title=The First 28<s>0</s> Years of Monty Python |last=Johnson |first=Kim \"Howard\" |year=1999 |location=New York |publisher=Thomas Dunne Books |isbn=0-312-16933-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/first28yearsofmo0000john/page/96 96] |url=https://archive.org/details/first28yearsofmo0000john/page/96 }}</ref> In ''[[Monty Python Live at Aspen]]'', Palin said that this salesman \"had an excuse for everything\". John Cleese said on the same show that he and Chapman \"believed that there was something very funny there, if we could find the right context for it\". In early drafts of what would become the Dead Parrot Sketch, the frustrated customer was trying to return a faulty [[toaster]] to a shop. Chapman realised that it needed to be \"madder\", and came up with the parrot idea.<ref name=\u201cMcCabe\u201d>McCabe, Bob (2005). ''The Life of Graham, The authorised biography of Graham Chapman''. pp. 90-91. London: Orion Books</ref>\n==Variations of the sketch==\n[[File:Dead Parrot O2 Arena.jpg|thumb|Palin and Cleese performing the Dead Parrot sketch at ''[[Monty Python Live (Mostly)]]'' in 2014]]\nIn the 1971 film ''[[And Now For Something Completely Different]]'', the sketch ends with the shopkeeper explaining that he always wanted to be a [[lumberjack]] and, ignoring Mr Praline's protests of that being irrelevant, begins singing \"[[The Lumberjack Song]]\".\n\nThe ''[[Monty Python Live at Drury Lane]]'' album features a live version of the sketch, which is slightly different from the TV version. Praline's rant about the deceased parrot includes \"He fucking snuffed it!\"  Also, the sketch ends with the shopkeeper saying that he has a slug that does talk. Cleese, after a brief pause, says, \"Right, I'll have that one, then!\" According to Michael Palin's published diary, Palin changed his response in order to throw Cleese off. During this performance something occurs on stage that does not translate into audio, but causes the audience to break into hysterics upon Cleese's follow-up line \"Now that's what I call a dead parrot\".\n\nA live performance from the 1976 [[Amnesty International]] benefit show, ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'', has Palin cracking up while Cleese declares \"Pining for the fjords? What kind of talk is that?\" The audience cheers this bit of [[breaking character]], but Palin quickly composes himself and Cleese declares \"Now, look! This is nothing to laugh at!\" before proceeding with the sketch. This version can be seen in the film ''[[Pleasure At Her Majesty's]]'', albeit with the ending removed. \n\nThe 1976 ''[[Monty Python Live at City Center]]'' performance ended with the following punchline:\n:''Shopkeeper'': (long, long pause) ... Do you want to come back to my place?\n:''Mr Praline'': I thought you'd never ask.\n\nIn his appearance on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', Cleese appears as a pirate attempting to take over a spaceship during a \"Pigs In Space\" sketch. At the end of the sketch, he demands of the smart-mouthed talking parrot on his shoulder, \"Do you want to be an ex-parrot?\"\n\nIn 1980, the sketch was performed again during The Pythons' four-night stint at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]. However, it was one of the sketches to be cut from the 1982 [[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl|film version]]. In the 1989 TV special which saw the final appearance of all six Pythons together, the sketch appeared in the title, ''[[Parrot Sketch Not Included \u2013 20 Years of Monty Python]]''. True to its title, the \u201cDead Parrot sketch\u201d is not included.<ref name=\u201cReunions\u201d/>\n\nIn 1989's Amnesty benefit show, ''[[The Secret Policeman's Biggest Ball]]'', the sketch opens similarly, but ends very differently:\n:''Mr Praline'': It's dead, that's what's wrong with it.\n:''Shopkeeper'': So it is. 'Ere's your money back and a couple of holiday [[voucher]]s.\n:''(audience goes wild)''\n:''Mr Praline'': ''(looks completely flabbergasted)'' Well, you can't say [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] hasn't changed some things.\n\nIn a 1997 ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' performance of the sketch, Cleese added a line to the rant: \"Its metabolic processes are a matter of interest only to historians!\".<ref name=\u201cReunions\u201d>{{cite news |title=Monty Python: 30 years of near reunions from the comedy troupe |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/comedy/a532589/monty-python-30-years-of-near-reunions-from-the-comedy-troupe/ |accessdate=21 August 2019 |work=Digital Spy}}</ref> In an interview on NPR's ''[[Fresh Air]]'', Palin attributed an almost dead audience to his seeing guests reverently mouthing the words of the sketch, rather than laughing at it. To end the sketch, Palin asked Cleese, \"Do you want to come back to my place?\" to which Cleese said, \"I thought you'd never ask!\"\n\nIn his published diary, [[Michael Palin]] recalls that during the filming of ''Monty Python's [[Life of Brian]]'' in [[Tunisia]], [[Spike Milligan]] (who happened to be there on holiday) regaled the Pythons with his own version of the Dead Parrot sketch, but changed \"Norwegian Blue\" to \"Arctic Grey\".\n\nIn a 2002 interview with [[Michael Parkinson]], John Cleese said that when he and Palin were performing the sketch on [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]], Palin made him laugh by saying, when asked if his slug could talk, \"It mutters a bit\" instead of \"Not really.\" When Cleese eventually stopped laughing, he couldn't remember where they were in the sketch. He turned to the audience and asked them what the next line was, and people shouted it at him, causing him to wonder, \"What is the point of this?\" He also says that when he and Palin were asked to do the sketch for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' they sat down together to try to remember the lines, and when they got stuck they considered just going out and stopping somebody on the street to ask how it went, since everybody seemed to have it memorised.\n\n[[Margaret Thatcher]] famously used the sketch in a speech at the [[Conservative Party Conference]] in 1990, referring to the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and their symbol being a dove, before ending the speech by commenting, \"[[And Now for Something Completely Different|And now for something completely different]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ6TgaPJcR0 |title=Margaret Thatcher does the Dead Parrot Sketch |publisher=YouTube |date=5 February 2010 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref> In 1998, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' ran the front-page headline \"This party is no more...it has ceased to be...this is an EX-party\" for an article about a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] conference.\n\nFor the 1999 ''[[Python Night - 30 Years of Monty Python]]'' TV special, [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] made a ''[[South Park]]'' version of the sketch depicting [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] angrily returning a dead [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] to [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s shop. Using much of the dialogue from the original sketch, it ends with [[Terry Gilliam]]'s animations playing around with Cartman before everything is crushed by the giant foot.\n\nCleese and Palin acted out the sketch during the Python's reunion in [[The O2]] in July 2014, ''[[Monty Python Live (Mostly)]]''. The sketch ended with the shopkeeper saying he has a selection of cheeses, transitioning into the [[Cheese Shop Sketch]]. The entire sketch ended like the City Center performance, with the shopkeeper offering Mr Praline to come back to his place, and Mr Praline replying \"I thought you'd never ask.\"\nIn their final performance on 20 July (which was broadcast live to many theatres all over the world), whilst listing the metaphors for the parrot's death, Cleese added the line \"it had expired and gone to meet Dr. [[Graham Chapman|Chapman]]\" after which both Cleese and Palin did a thumbs-up to the sky.\n\nIn the episode of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' from 13 November 2015, John Cleese is a guest on the show. At the end of the big furry hat segment (where Colbert and in this specific instance Cleese, create nonsensical rules), Cleese says, \"Do you want to come back to my place?\" and Stephen answers, \"I thought you'd never ask.\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwH04FeeVlQ \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d].

After listing several euphemisms for death (\"is no more\", \"has ceased to be\", \"bereft of life, it rests in peace\", and \"this is an ex-parrot\") he is told to go to the pet shop run by the shopkeeper's brother in [[Bolton]] for a refund. That proves difficult, as the proprietor of that store (who is really the shopkeeper, save for a fake moustache) claims this is [[Ipswich]], whereas the railway station attendant ([[Terry Jones]]) claims he is actually in Bolton after all.<ref name=AllTheWords-p104/>\n\nConfronting the shopkeeper's \"brother\" for lying, the shopkeeper claims he was playing a prank on Praline by sending him to Ipswich, which was a [[palindrome]] for Bolton; Praline points out that the shopkeeper was wrong because a palindrome for Bolton would have been \"Notlob\".<ref name=\u201cMcCabe\u201d/>\n\nJust as Praline has decided that \"this is getting too silly\", Graham Chapman's no-nonsense [[The Colonel (Monty Python)|Colonel]] bursts in and orders the sketch stopped.<ref name=AllTheWords-p104/>\n== Background ==\nThe \"Dead Parrot\" sketch was inspired by a \"Car Salesman\" sketch that Palin and Chapman had done in ''[[How to Irritate People]]''. In it, Palin played a [[car salesman]] who repeatedly refused to admit that there was anything wrong with his customer's (Chapman) car, even as it fell apart in front of him. That sketch was based on an actual incident between Palin and a car salesman.<ref>{{cite book |title=The First 28<s>0</s> Years of Monty Python |last=Johnson |first=Kim \"Howard\" |year=1999 |location=New York |publisher=Thomas Dunne Books |isbn=0-312-16933-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/first28yearsofmo0000john/page/96 96] |url=https://archive.org/details/first28yearsofmo0000john/page/96 }}</ref> In ''[[Monty Python Live at Aspen]]'', Palin said that this salesman \"had an excuse for everything\". John Cleese said on the same show that he and Chapman \"believed that there was something very funny there, if we could find the right context for it\". In early drafts of what would become the Dead Parrot Sketch, the frustrated customer was trying to return a faulty [[toaster]] to a shop. Chapman realised that it needed to be \"madder\", and came up with the parrot idea.<ref name=\u201cMcCabe\u201d>McCabe, Bob (2005). ''The Life of Graham, The authorised biography of Graham Chapman''. pp. 90-91. London: Orion Books</ref>\n==Variations of the sketch==\n[[File:Dead Parrot O2 Arena.jpg|thumb|Palin and Cleese performing the Dead Parrot sketch at ''[[Monty Python Live (Mostly)]]'' in 2014]]\nIn the 1971 film ''[[And Now For Something Completely Different]]'', the sketch ends with the shopkeeper explaining that he always wanted to be a [[lumberjack]] and, ignoring Mr Praline's protests of that being irrelevant, begins singing \"[[The Lumberjack Song]]\".\n\nThe ''[[Monty Python Live at Drury Lane]]'' album features a live version of the sketch, which is slightly different from the TV version. Praline's rant about the deceased parrot includes \"He fucking snuffed it!\"  Also, the sketch ends with the shopkeeper saying that he has a slug that does talk. Cleese, after a brief pause, says, \"Right, I'll have that one, then!\" According to Michael Palin's published diary, Palin changed his response in order to throw Cleese off. During this performance something occurs on stage that does not translate into audio, but causes the audience to break into hysterics upon Cleese's follow-up line \"Now that's what I call a dead parrot\".\n\nA live performance from the 1976 [[Amnesty International]] benefit show, ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'', has Palin cracking up while Cleese declares \"Pining for the fjords? What kind of talk is that?\" The audience cheers this bit of [[breaking character]], but Palin quickly composes himself and Cleese declares \"Now, look! This is nothing to laugh at!\" before proceeding with the sketch. This version can be seen in the film ''[[Pleasure At Her Majesty's]]'', albeit with the ending removed. \n\nThe 1976 ''[[Monty Python Live at City Center]]'' performance ended with the following punchline:\n:''Shopkeeper'': (long, long pause) ... Do you want to come back to my place?\n:''Mr Praline'': I thought you'd never ask.\n\nIn his appearance on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', Cleese appears as a pirate attempting to take over a spaceship during a \"Pigs In Space\" sketch. At the end of the sketch, he demands of the smart-mouthed talking parrot on his shoulder, \"Do you want to be an ex-parrot?\"\n\nIn 1980, the sketch was performed again during The Pythons' four-night stint at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]. However, it was one of the sketches to be cut from the 1982 [[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl|film version]]. In the 1989 TV special which saw the final appearance of all six Pythons together, the sketch appeared in the title, ''[[Parrot Sketch Not Included \u2013 20 Years of Monty Python]]''. True to its title, the \u201cDead Parrot sketch\u201d is not included.<ref name=\u201cReunions\u201d/>\n\nIn 1989's Amnesty benefit show, ''[[The Secret Policeman's Biggest Ball]]'', the sketch opens similarly, but ends very differently:\n:''Mr Praline'': It's dead, that's what's wrong with it.\n:''Shopkeeper'': So it is. 'Ere's your money back and a couple of holiday [[voucher]]s.\n:''(audience goes wild)''\n:''Mr Praline'': ''(looks completely flabbergasted)'' Well, you can't say [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] hasn't changed some things.\n\nIn a 1997 ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' performance of the sketch, Cleese added a line to the rant: \"Its metabolic processes are a matter of interest only to historians!\".<ref name=\u201cReunions\u201d>{{cite news |title=Monty Python: 30 years of near reunions from the comedy troupe |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/comedy/a532589/monty-python-30-years-of-near-reunions-from-the-comedy-troupe/ |accessdate=21 August 2019 |work=Digital Spy}}</ref> In an interview on NPR's ''[[Fresh Air]]'', Palin attributed an almost dead audience to his seeing guests reverently mouthing the words of the sketch, rather than laughing at it. To end the sketch, Palin asked Cleese, \"Do you want to come back to my place?\" to which Cleese said, \"I thought you'd never ask!\"\n\nIn his published diary, [[Michael Palin]] recalls that during the filming of ''Monty Python's [[Life of Brian]]'' in [[Tunisia]], [[Spike Milligan]] (who happened to be there on holiday) regaled the Pythons with his own version of the Dead Parrot sketch, but changed \"Norwegian Blue\" to \"Arctic Grey\".\n\nIn a 2002 interview with [[Michael Parkinson]], John Cleese said that when he and Palin were performing the sketch on [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]], Palin made him laugh by saying, when asked if his slug could talk, \"It mutters a bit\" instead of \"Not really.\" When Cleese eventually stopped laughing, he couldn't remember where they were in the sketch. He turned to the audience and asked them what the next line was, and people shouted it at him, causing him to wonder, \"What is the point of this?\" He also says that when he and Palin were asked to do the sketch for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' they sat down together to try to remember the lines, and when they got stuck they considered just going out and stopping somebody on the street to ask how it went, since everybody seemed to have it memorised.\n\n[[Margaret Thatcher]] famously used the sketch in a speech at the [[Conservative Party Conference]] in 1990, referring to the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and their symbol being a dove, before ending the speech by commenting, \"[[And Now for Something Completely Different|And now for something completely different]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ6TgaPJcR0 |title=Margaret Thatcher does the Dead Parrot Sketch |publisher=YouTube |date=5 February 2010 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref> In 1998, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' ran the front-page headline \"This party is no more...it has ceased to be...this is an EX-party\" for an article about a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] conference.\n\nFor the 1999 ''[[Python Night - 30 Years of Monty Python]]'' TV special, [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] made a ''[[South Park]]'' version of the sketch depicting [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] angrily returning a dead [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] to [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s shop. Using much of the dialogue from the original sketch, it ends with [[Terry Gilliam]]'s animations playing around with Cartman before everything is crushed by the giant foot.\n\nCleese and Palin acted out the sketch during the Python's reunion in [[The O2]] in July 2014, ''[[Monty Python Live (Mostly)]]''. The sketch ended with the shopkeeper saying he has a selection of cheeses, transitioning into the [[Cheese Shop Sketch]]. The entire sketch ended like the City Center performance, with the shopkeeper offering Mr Praline to come back to his place, and Mr Praline replying \"I thought you'd never ask.\"\nIn their final performance on 20 July (which was broadcast live to many theatres all over the world), whilst listing the metaphors for the parrot's death, Cleese added the line \"it had expired and gone to meet Dr. [[Graham Chapman|Chapman]]\" after which both Cleese and Palin did a thumbs-up to the sky.\n\nIn the episode of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' from 13 November 2015, John Cleese is a guest on the show. At the end of the big furry hat segment (where Colbert and in this specific instance Cleese, create nonsensical rules), Cleese says, \"Do you want to come back to my place?\" and Stephen answers, \"I thought you'd never ask.\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwH04FeeVlQ \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d].

For example, iPhone commands such as \"What is the weather going to be like?\" will generate a response such as \"The weather is to be cloudy and rainy and drop to 54&nbsp;degrees today.\" These commands can vary greatly and control almost every application of the phone. The commands given do not have to be specific and can be used with [[natural language processing|natural language]]. Siri can be accessed by holding down the home button for a short amount of time (compared to using the regular function). An impact of Siri, as shown by Apple video messages, is that it is much easier for people to use device functions while driving, exercising, or when they have their hands full.<ref name=\"vangrove\" /> It also means people with trouble reading, seeing, or typing can access the phone more easily.<ref name=\"vangrove\" />\n\nOn the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}}, [[texting]] can be aided by the voice assistant, which allows speech-to-text.<ref name=\"vangrove\" /> In addition to regular texting, messaging on the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} is supported by [[iMessage]], a specialized instant messaging program and service that allows unlimited texting to other Apple iOS 5 products. This supports the inclusion of media in text messages, integration with the device's voice-controlled software assistant, and read receipts for sent messages. Input to the computer comes from a keyboard displayed on the multi-touch screen or by voice-to-text by speaking into the microphone. Entered text is supported by predictive and suggestion software as well as a spell-checker, that includes many regional dialects like Swiss spoken French.<ref name=\"4S\" />\n\nAt the announcement, plans were in place for the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} to support many languages. Different features have different language requirements, such as keyboards compared to the word predictor and spell-checker, which needs a large dictionary of words. Language support is related to the iOS 5 operating system that the device launched with, although not always. The Siri digital assistant supported French, English, and German at launch.<ref name=\"vergejoshua\"/> Since it uses a software-based keyboard supported by the multi-touch display, it can support many different [[keyboard layout]]s without having to change physically. The {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} can display different languages and scripts at the same time.<ref name=\"chaffin\" />\n\nOn September 19, 2012, iOS 6 was released to the iPhone 4S among other compatible iOS device as an over the air (OTA) upgrade package.<ref>{{cite news |last=Tam |first=Donna |title=Apple's iOS 6 release date: Start your downloads on Sept. 19 |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=[[CNET]] |date=September 12, 2012 |url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57510600-37/apples-ios-6-release-date-start-your-downloads-on-sept-19/ |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}</ref> According to Apple the update contains 200 new features and tweaks, which includes a new maps app, dubbed [[Apple Maps]], [[Facebook]] integration and Passbook, an application that allows users to store their coupons, boarding passes and tickets digitally.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gunther |first=Cory |title=What\u2019s new in iOS 6?

Although the device has improved performance over iOS 7, some newer features that were released to newer models such as AirDrop and CarPlay were not supported. The iPhone 4S can also run iOS 8, which was released on September 17, 2014. Given that the device was supported for more than 3 years, some newer features of the software such as Apple Pay were not supported. It is also unable to work with Apple Watch due to the relatively aged hardware. In fact, some users often reported that performance on the 4S is very slow, similar to how iOS 7 ran on the iPhone 4, and suggesting that they should not upgrade due to battery draining issues and hanging up on calls. Meanwhile, Apple released iOS 8.1.1, which brought slight improvements to the phone and the [[iPad 2]], but it still did not run as fast as newer models.\n\n===iOS 9 controversy===\nOn June 8, 2015, Apple announced at the [[WWDC]] that the iPhone 4S would support [[iOS 9]]. This makes it the first iPhone to support 5 major versions of iOS, and the second iOS device to support 5 major versions (iOS 9 will support the iPad 2 as well, bringing its total up to six major versions of iOS supported). On December 22, 2015, Apple faced a class action lawsuit for crippling the iPhone 4S with the iOS 9 update with slow and buggy software or to pay hundreds of dollars on a new iPhone.\n\nOn June 13, 2016, Apple announced that the iPhone 4S will not support [[iOS 10]] due to hardware limitations.\n\nIt was briefly possible to downgrade the iPhone 4S from iOS 9 to iOS 6.1.3 following a signing window, which opened in January 2018<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2018/01/10/users-able-downgrade-from-ios-11/|title=Apple servers currently signing older iOS updates, users able to downgrade from iOS 11|last=Mayo|first=Benjamin|date=2018-01-11|website=9to5Mac|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-16}}</ref> and closed in November 2019. The option to downgrade to iOS 6.1.3 also allowed an over-the-air update to iOS 8.4.1 due to technical limitations preventing a direct update from iOS 6 to iOS 9.\n\n====2019 GPS rollover update====\n\nOn July 22, 2019, Apple released iOS 9.3.6 for the iPhone 4S to fix issues caused by the [[GPS Week Number Rollover|GPS week number rollover]]. The issues would impact the accuracy of GPS location and set the device's date and time to an incorrect value<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208010#936|title=About iOS 9 Updates|publisher=Apple}}</ref>, preventing connection to [[HTTPS]] servers and, consequently, Apple's servers for activation, iCloud and the iTunes and App stores.\nThe release of iOS 9.3.6 for the iPhone 4S makes it the longest supported iPhone to date, at eight years of support.\n\n==Hardware==\n[[File:Iphone4scameracropped.jpg|alt=The camera on the back side of the iPhone 4S.|thumb|left|The {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} features a [[Sony]] 8-megapixel camera and 1080p video recording.]]\n\n[[File:Apple A5 Chip.jpg|thumb|left|Apple A5 chip used in the iPhone 4S]]\nThe {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} uses the [[Apple A5]] [[system-on-chip]] (SoC) that incorporates an Imagination Technologies PowerVR SGX543 graphics processing unit ([[GPU]]).

On the 4S, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a [[Genius (iTunes)|Genius playlist]].<ref name=\"music4s\"/>\n\nThe {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} introduced a new automated voice control system called [[Siri]],<ref name=\"gizmodo\" /> that allows the user to give the iPhone commands, which it can execute and respond to. For example, iPhone commands such as \"What is the weather going to be like?\" will generate a response such as \"The weather is to be cloudy and rainy and drop to 54&nbsp;degrees today.\" These commands can vary greatly and control almost every application of the phone. The commands given do not have to be specific and can be used with [[natural language processing|natural language]]. Siri can be accessed by holding down the home button for a short amount of time (compared to using the regular function). An impact of Siri, as shown by Apple video messages, is that it is much easier for people to use device functions while driving, exercising, or when they have their hands full.<ref name=\"vangrove\" /> It also means people with trouble reading, seeing, or typing can access the phone more easily.<ref name=\"vangrove\" />\n\nOn the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}}, [[texting]] can be aided by the voice assistant, which allows speech-to-text.<ref name=\"vangrove\" /> In addition to regular texting, messaging on the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} is supported by [[iMessage]], a specialized instant messaging program and service that allows unlimited texting to other Apple iOS 5 products. This supports the inclusion of media in text messages, integration with the device's voice-controlled software assistant, and read receipts for sent messages. Input to the computer comes from a keyboard displayed on the multi-touch screen or by voice-to-text by speaking into the microphone. Entered text is supported by predictive and suggestion software as well as a spell-checker, that includes many regional dialects like Swiss spoken French.<ref name=\"4S\" />\n\nAt the announcement, plans were in place for the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} to support many languages. Different features have different language requirements, such as keyboards compared to the word predictor and spell-checker, which needs a large dictionary of words. Language support is related to the iOS 5 operating system that the device launched with, although not always. The Siri digital assistant supported French, English, and German at launch.<ref name=\"vergejoshua\"/> Since it uses a software-based keyboard supported by the multi-touch display, it can support many different [[keyboard layout]]s without having to change physically. The {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} can display different languages and scripts at the same time.<ref name=\"chaffin\" />\n\nOn September 19, 2012, iOS 6 was released to the iPhone 4S among other compatible iOS device as an over the air (OTA) upgrade package.<ref>{{cite news |last=Tam |first=Donna |title=Apple's iOS 6 release date: Start your downloads on Sept. 19 |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=[[CNET]] |date=September 12, 2012 |url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57510600-37/apples-ios-6-release-date-start-your-downloads-on-sept-19/ |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}</ref> According to Apple the update contains 200 new features and tweaks, which includes a new maps app, dubbed [[Apple Maps]], [[Facebook]] integration and Passbook, an application that allows users to store their coupons, boarding passes and tickets digitally.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gunther |first=Cory |title=What\u2019s new in iOS 6?

Although the device has improved performance over iOS 7, some newer features that were released to newer models such as AirDrop and CarPlay were not supported. The iPhone 4S can also run iOS 8, which was released on September 17, 2014. Given that the device was supported for more than 3 years, some newer features of the software such as Apple Pay were not supported. It is also unable to work with Apple Watch due to the relatively aged hardware. In fact, some users often reported that performance on the 4S is very slow, similar to how iOS 7 ran on the iPhone 4, and suggesting that they should not upgrade due to battery draining issues and hanging up on calls. Meanwhile, Apple released iOS 8.1.1, which brought slight improvements to the phone and the [[iPad 2]], but it still did not run as fast as newer models.\n\n===iOS 9 controversy===\nOn June 8, 2015, Apple announced at the [[WWDC]] that the iPhone 4S would support [[iOS 9]]. This makes it the first iPhone to support 5 major versions of iOS, and the second iOS device to support 5 major versions (iOS 9 will support the iPad 2 as well, bringing its total up to six major versions of iOS supported). On December 22, 2015, Apple faced a class action lawsuit for crippling the iPhone 4S with the iOS 9 update with slow and buggy software or to pay hundreds of dollars on a new iPhone.\n\nOn June 13, 2016, Apple announced that the iPhone 4S will not support [[iOS 10]] due to hardware limitations.\n\nIt was briefly possible to downgrade the iPhone 4S from iOS 9 to iOS 6.1.3 following a signing window, which opened in January 2018<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2018/01/10/users-able-downgrade-from-ios-11/|title=Apple servers currently signing older iOS updates, users able to downgrade from iOS 11|last=Mayo|first=Benjamin|date=2018-01-11|website=9to5Mac|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-16}}</ref> and closed in November 2019. The option to downgrade to iOS 6.1.3 also allowed an over-the-air update to iOS 8.4.1 due to technical limitations preventing a direct update from iOS 6 to iOS 9.\n\n====2019 GPS rollover update====\n\nOn July 22, 2019, Apple released iOS 9.3.6 for the iPhone 4S to fix issues caused by the [[GPS Week Number Rollover|GPS week number rollover]]. The issues would impact the accuracy of GPS location and set the device's date and time to an incorrect value<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208010#936|title=About iOS 9 Updates|publisher=Apple}}</ref>, preventing connection to [[HTTPS]] servers and, consequently, Apple's servers for activation, iCloud and the iTunes and App stores.\nThe release of iOS 9.3.6 for the iPhone 4S makes it the longest supported iPhone to date, at eight years of support.\n\n==Hardware==\n[[File:Iphone4scameracropped.jpg|alt=The camera on the back side of the iPhone 4S.|thumb|left|The {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} features a [[Sony]] 8-megapixel camera and 1080p video recording.]]\n\n[[File:Apple A5 Chip.jpg|thumb|left|Apple A5 chip used in the iPhone 4S]]\nThe {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} uses the [[Apple A5]] [[system-on-chip]] (SoC) that incorporates an Imagination Technologies PowerVR SGX543 graphics processing unit ([[GPU]]).

response===\n''MacGyver'' has received generally negative reviews from television critics, with many comparing it poorly to the original and some praising and criticizing CBS for making it an updated show. ''Variety'' wrote: \"Lucas Till\u2019s performance as the title character misses the mark completely; even when MacGyver explains the contraptions he builds on the fly via voiceovers, Till\u2019s delivery is wooden and clunky. The writing doesn\u2019t help \u2014 the pilot script is full of silly plot short-cuts and painfully cheesy lines \u2014 but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that the new version of the character has very little appeal.... George Eads does what he can to bring a bit of energy to the MacGyver spy crew, but it\u2019s a futile effort.

He also has history with Riley, because he was once in a relationship with her mother and had an altercation with her abusive father.

He is initially a struggling film director possessing several artistic talents. His ability to create lifelike masks and facial prosthetics gets him hired at the Phoenix Foundation.

response===\n''MacGyver'' has received generally negative reviews from television critics, with many comparing it poorly to the original and some praising and criticizing CBS for making it an updated show. ''Variety'' wrote: \"Lucas Till\u2019s performance as the title character misses the mark completely; even when MacGyver explains the contraptions he builds on the fly via voiceovers, Till\u2019s delivery is wooden and clunky. The writing doesn\u2019t help \u2014 the pilot script is full of silly plot short-cuts and painfully cheesy lines \u2014 but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that the new version of the character has very little appeal.... George Eads does what he can to bring a bit of energy to the MacGyver spy crew, but it\u2019s a futile effort.

It is based on the true story of [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Augusto and Michaela Odone]], two parents in a relentless search for a cure for their son [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Lorenzo]]'s [[adrenoleukodystrophy]] (ALD). It was filmed primarily from September 1991 to February 1992 in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite news | title= Pittsburgh - City lands good share of movies| url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=V19cAAAAIBAJ&sjid=s1YNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1397%2C300980|date= 10 December 1995|work= The Vindicator}}</ref> The film had a limited release in North America on December 30, 1992, with a nationwide release two weeks later on January 15, 1993. It was generally well received by the critics and received two nominations at the [[65th Academy Awards]] but was a [[box office bomb]], grossing only $7.2 million against its $30 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n\n[[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Lorenzo]] is a bright and vibrant young boy living in the [[Comoro Islands]], as his father [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Augusto]] works for the [[World Bank]] and is stationed there. However, when his parents relocate back to the United States, he begins to show signs of neurological problems (such as falling, loss of hearing, tantrums, etc.). The boy is diagnosed as having [[adrenoleukodystrophy]] (ALD), which is fatal within two years. Failing to find a doctor capable of treating their son's rare disease Augusto and his wife, [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Michaela]], set out on a mission to find a treatment to save their son. In their quest, the Odones clash with doctors, scientists and a support group that is skeptical that anything could be done about ALD, much less by laypeople. But they persist, setting up camp in medical libraries, reviewing animal experiments, enlisting the aid of Professor Gus Nikolais, badgering researchers, questioning top doctors all over the world and even organizing an international symposium about the disease.\n\nDespite research dead-ends, the horror of watching their son's health decline and being surrounded by skeptics (including the coordinators of the support group they attend), they persist until they finally hit upon a possible therapy. The Odone's sponsor an international meeting of scientists doing research on ALD, requiring two conditions ahead of time. First they insist that the meeting focus on potential treatments and second, they require that they be allowed to participate, despite being non-scientist laypeople. The pivotal scene in the movie portrays this meeting, in which the scientists are presenting their research. When Dr. William B. Rizzo mentions his studies in which the addition of oleic acid to cultured cells blocked accumulation of the factors which cause ALD, the Odone's jump into the conversation, asking if this oil might help their son. Although the scientists play down their hope, pointing out that it would take years of work to produce the oil and test in clinical trials, the Odone's seize the promise of this possible curative treatment. As the scene ends, Michaela Odone is shown beginning the effort to find someone able and willing to produce the same oil Dr. Rizzo gave to his cells. They contact over 100 firms around the world until they find an elderly British chemist, Don Suddaby, who is working for [[Croda International]] and is willing to take on the challenge of distilling the proper formula. \n\nThe Odone's obtain a precious vial of the oil (actually containing two specific [[long chain fatty acids]], isolated from  [[rapeseed oil]] and [[olive oil]]) and add it to their son's diet. This treatment proves successful in normalizing the accumulation of the very long chain fatty acids (which had been causing their son's steady decline), as measured in blood levels. This treatment halts the progression of his disease and is dubbed \"Lorenzo's Oil\". This oil is soon found to be successful in preventing the progression of harm in other patients with ALD. Meanwhile, however, Lorenzo has a great deal of neurological damage, and the Odone's are dismayed to see that the oil can reverse their son's symptoms only very, very slowly. The Odone's realize that more rapid improvement of his son's severe condition will require treatments to repair the [[myelin sheath]] (a [[lipid]] insulator) around the nerves, and Augusto is shown taking on the new challenge of organizing [[The Myelin Project|biomedical efforts to heal myelin damage in patients]].\n\nFinally, Lorenzo, at the age of 14, shows definite improvement (swallowing for himself and answering \"yes\" or \"no\" questions by blinking) and it is revealed that he has regained his sight, can move his head from side to side, vocalize simple sounds and is learning to use a computer. The movie ends with scenes of ALD patients who were treated with Lorenzo's Oil earlier in the course of their disease. In these patients the devastating neurological problems from which Lorenzo suffered where able to be prevented.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Nick Nolte]] as [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Augusto Odone]]\n*[[Susan Sarandon]] as [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Michaela Odone]]\n*[[Zack O'Malley Greenburg]] as [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Lorenzo Odone]]\n*[[Peter Ustinov]] as [[Hugo Moser (scientist)|Professor Gus Nikolais]]\n*[[Kathleen Wilhoite]] as Deirdre Murphy\n*[[Gerry Bamman]] as Doctor Judalon\n*[[Margo Martindale]] as Wendy Gimble\n*[[James Rebhorn]] as Ellard Muscatine\n*[[Ann Hearn]] as Loretta Muscatine\n*Maduka Steady as Omouri\n*Mary Wakio as Comorian Teacher\n*Don Suddaby as himself\n*Colin Ward as Jake Gimble\n*[[LaTanya Richardson|La Tanya Richardson]] as Nurse Ruth\n*[[Jennifer Dundas]] as Nurse Nancy Jo\n*William Cameron as Pellerman\n*[[Peter Mackenzie]] as Immunosuppression Doctor\n*[[Laura Linney]] as Young Teacher\n*[[Elizabeth Daily]] as vocal effects for [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Lorenzo]] \n{{div col end}}\n*[[Eliot Brinton]] as [[Dr. William B.

The Odone's realize that more rapid improvement of his son's severe condition will require treatments to repair the [[myelin sheath]] (a [[lipid]] insulator) around the nerves, and Augusto is shown taking on the new challenge of organizing [[The Myelin Project|biomedical efforts to heal myelin damage in patients]].\n\nFinally, Lorenzo, at the age of 14, shows definite improvement (swallowing for himself and answering \"yes\" or \"no\" questions by blinking) and it is revealed that he has regained his sight, can move his head from side to side, vocalize simple sounds and is learning to use a computer. The movie ends with scenes of ALD patients who were treated with Lorenzo's Oil earlier in the course of their disease. In these patients the devastating neurological problems from which Lorenzo suffered where able to be prevented.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Nick Nolte]] as [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Augusto Odone]]\n*[[Susan Sarandon]] as [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Michaela Odone]]\n*[[Zack O'Malley Greenburg]] as [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Lorenzo Odone]]\n*[[Peter Ustinov]] as [[Hugo Moser (scientist)|Professor Gus Nikolais]]\n*[[Kathleen Wilhoite]] as Deirdre Murphy\n*[[Gerry Bamman]] as Doctor Judalon\n*[[Margo Martindale]] as Wendy Gimble\n*[[James Rebhorn]] as Ellard Muscatine\n*[[Ann Hearn]] as Loretta Muscatine\n*Maduka Steady as Omouri\n*Mary Wakio as Comorian Teacher\n*Don Suddaby as himself\n*Colin Ward as Jake Gimble\n*[[LaTanya Richardson|La Tanya Richardson]] as Nurse Ruth\n*[[Jennifer Dundas]] as Nurse Nancy Jo\n*William Cameron as Pellerman\n*[[Peter Mackenzie]] as Immunosuppression Doctor\n*[[Laura Linney]] as Young Teacher\n*[[Elizabeth Daily]] as vocal effects for [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Lorenzo]] \n{{div col end}}\n*[[Eliot Brinton]] as [[Dr. William B.
