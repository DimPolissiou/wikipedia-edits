It was first broadcast on [[BBC2]] on 7 December 1982.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0752258/ | title = \"The Young Ones\" Interesting (1984) | accessdate = 1 May 2009 | publisher = Internet Movie Database | quote = Original Air Date: 7 December 1982 (Season 1, Episode 5)}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{In-universe|section|date=May 2010}}\nIt is an important evening ahead as the quartet host their first house party for their trendy student friends. After initial problems with Vyvyan's car-engine-powered [[vacuum cleaner]], which sweeps up a morose hippy friend of Neil's, also called Neil (who is mercilessly shoved by Rick into the [[refrigerator]]) and an unexpected visit from an eager [[Christians|Christian]] (later crushed by a giant [[sandwich]] fallen out of the sky), the party gets under way in style. (In a short but memorable bit, Vyvyan tries to impress some girls, asking \"Wanna see how many press-ups I can do?\"; Vyvyan's resulting press-ups had the BBC censors - as recalled by [[Lise Mayer]] - thinking Vyvyan was simulating sexual intercourse.)\n\nThe party soon turns riotous, with many uninvited guests arriving from the pub. Neil is beaten up, only to awaken in his bed believing the whole episode was a dream. Neil gets out of bed and busies himself as the credits play. At the end, however, party noises cause Neil to realize that \"This is the dream!\" as he wakes up back at the party.\n\n==Score==\nThe episode features a guest appearance of the band [[Rip Rig + Panic]] performing \"[[You're My Kind of Climate]]\". Some other notable music playing throughout the progression of the party include \"[[The Things That Dreams Are Made Of]]\" by [[The Human League]], \"[[Mama Told Me Not to Come]]\" by [[Three Dog Night]] and \"[[It's My Party (Lesley Gore song)#Dave Stewart and Barbara Gaskin version|It's My Party]]\" by [[Dave Stewart (keyboardist)|Dave Stewart]] and [[Barbara Gaskin]].\n\n==Characters==\n\nAs with all episodes of ''The Young Ones'', the main four characters were student flatmates Mike ([[Christopher Ryan]]); Vyvyan ([[Adrian Edmondson]]); Rick ([[Rik Mayall]]) and Neil ([[Nigel Planer]]).

After initial problems with Vyvyan's car-engine-powered [[vacuum cleaner]], which sweeps up a morose hippy friend of Neil's, also called Neil (who is mercilessly shoved by Rick into the [[refrigerator]]) and an unexpected visit from an eager [[Christians|Christian]] (later crushed by a giant [[sandwich]] fallen out of the sky), the party gets under way in style. (In a short but memorable bit, Vyvyan tries to impress some girls, asking \"Wanna see how many press-ups I can do?\"; Vyvyan's resulting press-ups had the BBC censors - as recalled by [[Lise Mayer]] - thinking Vyvyan was simulating sexual intercourse.)\n\nThe party soon turns riotous, with many uninvited guests arriving from the pub. Neil is beaten up, only to awaken in his bed believing the whole episode was a dream. Neil gets out of bed and busies himself as the credits play. At the end, however, party noises cause Neil to realize that \"This is the dream!\" as he wakes up back at the party.\n\n==Score==\nThe episode features a guest appearance of the band [[Rip Rig + Panic]] performing \"[[You're My Kind of Climate]]\". Some other notable music playing throughout the progression of the party include \"[[The Things That Dreams Are Made Of]]\" by [[The Human League]], \"[[Mama Told Me Not to Come]]\" by [[Three Dog Night]] and \"[[It's My Party (Lesley Gore song)#Dave Stewart and Barbara Gaskin version|It's My Party]]\" by [[Dave Stewart (keyboardist)|Dave Stewart]] and [[Barbara Gaskin]].\n\n==Characters==\n\nAs with all episodes of ''The Young Ones'', the main four characters were student flatmates Mike ([[Christopher Ryan]]); Vyvyan ([[Adrian Edmondson]]); Rick ([[Rik Mayall]]) and Neil ([[Nigel Planer]]).

It originally aired on April 15, 1998, in [[broadcast syndication]].\n\nIn this episode, Captain [[Benjamin Sisko]] ([[Avery Brooks]]) works with [[Elim Garak]] ([[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andrew Robinson]]) to trick the [[Romulan]]s into joining the war against the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]].\n\nThe episode received Nielsen ratings of 4.8 points corresponding to nearly 4.7 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.telenet.be/WebTrek/Ds9/Ratings/ratings6.html|title=WebTrek - Star Trek: Deep Space Nine * SEASON 6 NIELSEN RATINGS|website=users.telenet.be}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nCaptain [[Benjamin Sisko]] ([[Avery Brooks]]), conflicted over events of the last two weeks, recounts his experiences in a personal log entry, the details of which are revealed in flashbacks. The losses suffered by the Federation in the war with the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] are taking their toll, with Sisko noting that whenever a casualty list is posted at least one of his officers spots the name of a friend or loved one. A major advantage the Dominion has is their non-aggression pact with the [[Romulan]]s, who are allowing the Dominion free passage through their territory. Sisko decides that in order for the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] and its allies to win the war, he must bring the Romulans in on their side no matter what.\n\nSisko enlists the help of former [[Cardassian]] spy [[Elim Garak]] ([[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andrew Robinson]]) to obtain intelligence from Cardassia, assuming the Dominion must be considering a conquest of Romulus eventually, but all of Garak's contacts end up dead shortly after communicating with him. Garak instead suggests they forge a recording of Dominion leaders discussing a surprise attack. Hesitant, but driven forward by the Dominion's recent conquest of [[Betazed]], Sisko obtains permission from [[Starfleet]] to proceed.\n\nOn Garak's request, Sisko secures the release of a forger named Grathon Tolar ([[Howard Shangraw]]) from a [[Klingon]] prison. Then, in order to obtain an authentic Cardassian secure data rod, he is forced to trade a large quantity of bio-mimetic gel, a rare, dangerous, and highly regulated material. [[Julian Bashir|Dr. Bashir]] ([[Alexander Siddig]]) strongly objects, and relents only when Sisko orders him unequivocally; providing the doctor with the orders in writing, the doctor still vows to lodge a formal complaint. Matters are complicated when Tolar stabs [[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]] ([[Armin Shimerman]]) in an altercation while drunk. To keep Tolar out of trouble, he bribes Quark and convinces [[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]] ([[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]]) to drop the matter. At this point, Sisko recognizes the legal and ethical compromises he is making but presses on knowing it is for the greater good.\n\nTolar creates a [[holography|holographic]] record of a Dominion meeting between [[Damar (Star Trek)|Damar]] ([[Casey Biggs]]) and Weyoun ([[Jeffrey Combs]]) discussing plans involving the invasion of the Romulan Empire. Meanwhile, on Garak's advice, Sisko invites [[Vreenak]] ([[Stephen McHattie]]), an influential Romulan senator, to [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]] in secret. Sisko shows Vreenak the recording and gives him the data rod, but the senator discovers the forgery and departs, furious and vowing to expose the deception. As Sisko faces the possibility that his actions may actually force the Romulans to join with the Dominion once Vreenak returns to the Empire, he learns that Vreenak's ship was destroyed en route.\n\nSisko angrily confronts Garak, who admits he planted a bomb on Vreenak's ship in case the forgery was not accepted. Garak also admits he killed Tolar in order to keep his work secret. Garak maintains that when the Romulans scan the wreckage and find the rod, any imperfections will be attributed to damage from the explosion, and thus the recording will implicate the Dominion as planned. Garak asserts that Sisko included him in the plan to do the things that Sisko was unwilling to do. Garak also states that Sisko can ease his conscience with the knowledge that the Alpha Quadrant may have been saved at the cost of the life of one Romulan senator, one criminal and the self respect of one Starfleet officer, which he calls a bargain.\n\nSubsequently, the Romulans join with the Federation and declare war against the Dominion, quickly striking at nearby Dominion outposts. At the end of his log entry, Sisko admits that Garak was right about a guilty conscience being a small price to pay, and states, somewhat uncertainly, that he can live with his decision for the good of the Alpha Quadrant. He then orders the computer to delete the entire personal log.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\nThe episode has origins in a discussion the writing staff had about the [[Vietnam War]], which quickly moved onto the [[Watergate scandal]]. They began working on an idea in which [[Jake Sisko]] discovered some incriminating information regarding [[Shakaar]], the leader of the [[Bajoran]] Government. If revealed, it would bring down the Government, and so at a time of war, Captain Sisko would be forced to prevent his son from revealing the information. At this point, the episode was called \"Patriot\". The plot quickly evolved to become information on Sisko instead. Writer [[Michael Taylor (screenwriter)|Michael Taylor]] wrote a screenplay which saw Jake Sisko attempting to interview Garak, but following the evasiveness of the Cardassian, he realises that something is amiss. Captain Sisko tells him to back off Garak, but Jake's investigation reveals that the duo were attempting to bring the Romulans into the war against the Dominion. The Captain tells his son that he would prevent the publishing of the story, but the writing team didn't buy into the conflict between those characters.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=556}}\n\n[[Ronald D. Moore]] began working with Taylor to revise the screenplay,{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=556}} dropping Jake from the plot entirely. They were having trouble with the pacing of the story, but Moore realised while drinking late at night that it would work if it was told in flashbacks. He pitched the idea the following morning, and it was accepted by the writing team. The screenplay was entirely re-written.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=557}} Taylor called the final version \"brilliant\" but admitted that it had mostly been written by Moore.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=556}} Moore explained that the story needed something of weight in order to push Sisko along. The writing team discussed having the Dominion take one of the well known planets of the Federation. [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] was considered, but it was felt to be too important and so Betazed was chosen instead.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=557}} [[Ira Steven Behr]] added the final line of the episode, \"I can live with it\", as a reference to the 1962 film ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]''.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=558}} The title of the episode came from the line in the 1989 \"[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]\" film, \"Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?\".{{sfn | Jones|Parkin| 2003| p=253}}\n\n===Direction and casting===\nDirector [[Victor Lobl]] also planned out the mannerisms shown by Brooks as Sisko where he talks directly to the camera. He praised the actor, saying that he delivered exactly what Lobl's written direction had described.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=557}} All of those sequences were shot almost in direct continuity to ensure that the audience believed that it was a single log recording. Lobl had those filmed very tightly, and so there were not many options available in editing as only two angles were filmed for those sequences. The script had called for Sisko to get more and more drunk during those sequences as he descends into the flashbacks; Lobl had expected the studio to pull that idea before filming but they did not. Lobl also had Sisko begin to remove various parts of his uniform at the same time, which he felt demonstrated that the character was baring his soul about the story.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=558}}\n\n\"In the Pale Moonlight\" featured several recurring characters and actors, with Combs as Weyoun, Biggs as Damar and Robinson as Garak. Joining them was McHattie, portraying Ambassador Vreenak.

He said \"we're not really willing to take the consequences of our actions, and sometimes we have to do very dirty things, and we have to hurt people, and we pretend that that doesn't exist, that Americans would never do that.

The review of the [[VHS]] release in ''[[Dreamwatch]]'' magazine describe the episode as \"probably the strongest of the season\" and among the best episodes of ''Deep Space Nine''. It called the plot \"original\", \"daring\" and \"unexpected\".<ref name=dreamwatchreview/> Frank M. Robinson in his 1999 book, ''Science Fiction of the 20th Century'', describes \"In the Pale Moonlight\" as \"Captain Sisko is forced to betray his ideals to save the lives of millions on a galactic scale at the cost of one petty criminal and one ambassador of an unfriendly nation. On the surface, no contest but Brooks (Sisko) played the role with depth and feeling unusual in a science-fiction series.\" He added that the ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine had described it as one of the best dramatic episodes of the season.{{sfn | Robinson| 1999| p=240}} [[Keith DeCandido]] reviewed the episode for [[Tor Books|Tor.com]], giving it a rating of ten out of ten. He called the fall of Betazed a \"masterstroke\" because it made the viewer invested in the conflict. He praised the suffering Sisko had for doing what he did, and said that both Brooks and Robinson were \"at their best\" with two \"bravura performances\".<ref name=\"tormoonlight\" />\n\nZack Handlen, in his review for [[The A.V. Club]], suggested that the most shocking aspect of \"In the Pale Moonlight\" was that Sisko's actions were not shocking but only provided a twist. He said that the script \"never overplays Sisko's deepening sense of crisis\", and avoided presenting any choices as right or wrong.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Handlen|first1=Zack|title=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: \"In The Pale Moonlight\"|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/in-the-pale-moonlight-106610|publisher=The A.V.

It originally aired on April 15, 1998, in [[broadcast syndication]].\n\nIn this episode, Captain [[Benjamin Sisko]] ([[Avery Brooks]]) works with [[Elim Garak]] ([[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andrew Robinson]]) to trick the [[Romulan]]s into joining the war against the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]].\n\nThe episode received Nielsen ratings of 4.8 points corresponding to nearly 4.7 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.telenet.be/WebTrek/Ds9/Ratings/ratings6.html|title=WebTrek - Star Trek: Deep Space Nine * SEASON 6 NIELSEN RATINGS|website=users.telenet.be}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nCaptain [[Benjamin Sisko]] ([[Avery Brooks]]), conflicted over events of the last two weeks, recounts his experiences in a personal log entry, the details of which are revealed in flashbacks. The losses suffered by the Federation in the war with the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] are taking their toll, with Sisko noting that whenever a casualty list is posted at least one of his officers spots the name of a friend or loved one. A major advantage the Dominion has is their non-aggression pact with the [[Romulan]]s, who are allowing the Dominion free passage through their territory. Sisko decides that in order for the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] and its allies to win the war, he must bring the Romulans in on their side no matter what.\n\nSisko enlists the help of former [[Cardassian]] spy [[Elim Garak]] ([[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andrew Robinson]]) to obtain intelligence from Cardassia, assuming the Dominion must be considering a conquest of Romulus eventually, but all of Garak's contacts end up dead shortly after communicating with him. Garak instead suggests they forge a recording of Dominion leaders discussing a surprise attack. Hesitant, but driven forward by the Dominion's recent conquest of [[Betazed]], Sisko obtains permission from [[Starfleet]] to proceed.\n\nOn Garak's request, Sisko secures the release of a forger named Grathon Tolar ([[Howard Shangraw]]) from a [[Klingon]] prison. Then, in order to obtain an authentic Cardassian secure data rod, he is forced to trade a large quantity of bio-mimetic gel, a rare, dangerous, and highly regulated material. [[Julian Bashir|Dr. Bashir]] ([[Alexander Siddig]]) strongly objects, and relents only when Sisko orders him unequivocally; providing the doctor with the orders in writing, the doctor still vows to lodge a formal complaint. Matters are complicated when Tolar stabs [[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]] ([[Armin Shimerman]]) in an altercation while drunk. To keep Tolar out of trouble, he bribes Quark and convinces [[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]] ([[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]]) to drop the matter. At this point, Sisko recognizes the legal and ethical compromises he is making but presses on knowing it is for the greater good.\n\nTolar creates a [[holography|holographic]] record of a Dominion meeting between [[Damar (Star Trek)|Damar]] ([[Casey Biggs]]) and Weyoun ([[Jeffrey Combs]]) discussing plans involving the invasion of the Romulan Empire. Meanwhile, on Garak's advice, Sisko invites [[Vreenak]] ([[Stephen McHattie]]), an influential Romulan senator, to [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]] in secret. Sisko shows Vreenak the recording and gives him the data rod, but the senator discovers the forgery and departs, furious and vowing to expose the deception. As Sisko faces the possibility that his actions may actually force the Romulans to join with the Dominion once Vreenak returns to the Empire, he learns that Vreenak's ship was destroyed en route.\n\nSisko angrily confronts Garak, who admits he planted a bomb on Vreenak's ship in case the forgery was not accepted. Garak also admits he killed Tolar in order to keep his work secret. Garak maintains that when the Romulans scan the wreckage and find the rod, any imperfections will be attributed to damage from the explosion, and thus the recording will implicate the Dominion as planned. Garak asserts that Sisko included him in the plan to do the things that Sisko was unwilling to do. Garak also states that Sisko can ease his conscience with the knowledge that the Alpha Quadrant may have been saved at the cost of the life of one Romulan senator, one criminal and the self respect of one Starfleet officer, which he calls a bargain.\n\nSubsequently, the Romulans join with the Federation and declare war against the Dominion, quickly striking at nearby Dominion outposts. At the end of his log entry, Sisko admits that Garak was right about a guilty conscience being a small price to pay, and states, somewhat uncertainly, that he can live with his decision for the good of the Alpha Quadrant. He then orders the computer to delete the entire personal log.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\nThe episode has origins in a discussion the writing staff had about the [[Vietnam War]], which quickly moved onto the [[Watergate scandal]]. They began working on an idea in which [[Jake Sisko]] discovered some incriminating information regarding [[Shakaar]], the leader of the [[Bajoran]] Government. If revealed, it would bring down the Government, and so at a time of war, Captain Sisko would be forced to prevent his son from revealing the information. At this point, the episode was called \"Patriot\". The plot quickly evolved to become information on Sisko instead. Writer [[Michael Taylor (screenwriter)|Michael Taylor]] wrote a screenplay which saw Jake Sisko attempting to interview Garak, but following the evasiveness of the Cardassian, he realises that something is amiss. Captain Sisko tells him to back off Garak, but Jake's investigation reveals that the duo were attempting to bring the Romulans into the war against the Dominion. The Captain tells his son that he would prevent the publishing of the story, but the writing team didn't buy into the conflict between those characters.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=556}}\n\n[[Ronald D. Moore]] began working with Taylor to revise the screenplay,{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=556}} dropping Jake from the plot entirely. They were having trouble with the pacing of the story, but Moore realised while drinking late at night that it would work if it was told in flashbacks. He pitched the idea the following morning, and it was accepted by the writing team. The screenplay was entirely re-written.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=557}} Taylor called the final version \"brilliant\" but admitted that it had mostly been written by Moore.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=556}} Moore explained that the story needed something of weight in order to push Sisko along. The writing team discussed having the Dominion take one of the well known planets of the Federation. [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] was considered, but it was felt to be too important and so Betazed was chosen instead.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=557}} [[Ira Steven Behr]] added the final line of the episode, \"I can live with it\", as a reference to the 1962 film ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]''.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=558}} The title of the episode came from the line in the 1989 \"[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]\" film, \"Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?\".{{sfn | Jones|Parkin| 2003| p=253}}\n\n===Direction and casting===\nDirector [[Victor Lobl]] also planned out the mannerisms shown by Brooks as Sisko where he talks directly to the camera. He praised the actor, saying that he delivered exactly what Lobl's written direction had described.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=557}} All of those sequences were shot almost in direct continuity to ensure that the audience believed that it was a single log recording. Lobl had those filmed very tightly, and so there were not many options available in editing as only two angles were filmed for those sequences. The script had called for Sisko to get more and more drunk during those sequences as he descends into the flashbacks; Lobl had expected the studio to pull that idea before filming but they did not. Lobl also had Sisko begin to remove various parts of his uniform at the same time, which he felt demonstrated that the character was baring his soul about the story.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=558}}\n\n\"In the Pale Moonlight\" featured several recurring characters and actors, with Combs as Weyoun, Biggs as Damar and Robinson as Garak. Joining them was McHattie, portraying Ambassador Vreenak.

The review of the [[VHS]] release in ''[[Dreamwatch]]'' magazine describe the episode as \"probably the strongest of the season\" and among the best episodes of ''Deep Space Nine''. It called the plot \"original\", \"daring\" and \"unexpected\".<ref name=dreamwatchreview/> Frank M. Robinson in his 1999 book, ''Science Fiction of the 20th Century'', describes \"In the Pale Moonlight\" as \"Captain Sisko is forced to betray his ideals to save the lives of millions on a galactic scale at the cost of one petty criminal and one ambassador of an unfriendly nation. On the surface, no contest but Brooks (Sisko) played the role with depth and feeling unusual in a science-fiction series.\" He added that the ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine had described it as one of the best dramatic episodes of the season.{{sfn | Robinson| 1999| p=240}} [[Keith DeCandido]] reviewed the episode for [[Tor Books|Tor.com]], giving it a rating of ten out of ten.

He praised the suffering Sisko had for doing what he did, and said that both Brooks and Robinson were \"at their best\" with two \"bravura performances\".<ref name=\"tormoonlight\" />\n\nZack Handlen, in his review for [[The A.V.

He was born in the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] and died in [[Worms, Germany]].\n\n==Appointment as Archbishop==\nWilliam de Cro\u00ff was the nephew of the powerful [[William de Cro\u00ff]], one of the most important advisers to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles of Ghent]], the future Holy Roman Emperor. Thanks to this connection, he was granted the lucrative [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Osma-Soria|bishopric of Soria]].

The Archbishopric of Toledo was the richest and most powerful in Spain. The main other claimant to succeed Cisneros was [[Alonso de Arag\u00f3n]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zaragoza|Archbishop of Saragossa]] and King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]'s illegitimate son and young King Charles's half-uncle. However, the seventeen-year-old Charles's biggest influence was still [[William de Cro\u00ff]], who maneuvered his twenty-year-old nephew into the Archbishopric.  The decision was made on 9 November, although complications meant he was only appointed in the first week of 1518. Most notably, Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]]'s will had specifically prohibited the granting of ecclesiastical offices to foreigners. Charles resolved this problem by issuing a writ of naturalization on 14 November to William decreeing him a Castilian. [[Pope Leo X]] had granted an [[indult]] on 12 October freeing William from any current or future residency requirement to an office. It had been originally meant to legitimize his holding of the Bishopric of Soria, and was now used to justify the Archbishopric of Toledo.<ref name=\"seaver\"/>\n\nThis appointment was immensely scandalous in Castile. Cisneros had been universally respected, and William was an unknown foreign boy. The representatives at the Cortes of Valladolid in 1518 presented petitions protesting the act. The petitions demanded that no further foreigners be granted naturalization writs and that Cro\u00ff reside in his see.  Charles agreed, but ignored the petition anyway; Cro\u00ff never lived in Toledo.  The outrage at this act of patronage would be one of the many sparks of the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]] in 1520.<ref name=\"seaver\"/>\n\n==Death==\nWilliam was injured by a fall from his horse while in [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V']]s train on 6 January 1521.

It was the 16th episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' to be aired. It was produced for season one but aired in season two. It guest-starred [[Martin Mull]] as Mr. Harris, and [[Fred Tatasciore]] as [[Chevy Chase]].\n\n==Plot summary==\n\n[[Chris Griffin|Chris]] has been failing school recently, and [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] puts her foot down and forbids him from watching [[television]] until his grades improve. Lois suggests to [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] that he help Chris with his [[study skills]]. This prompts Peter to lie to her about studying so that he and Chris can watch their favorite television show, ''Gumbel 2 Gumbel: Beach Justice'', a crime drama starring brothers [[Bryant Gumbel|Bryant]] and [[Greg Gumbel]]. However, he is disappointed to discover that the show has been canceled. To get it back on the air, Peter decides to tell the Grant-a-Dream Foundation that Chris is suffering from a made-up terminal illness called \"tumorsyphilisitisosis\", the symptoms of which include growing extra nipples (actually [[Pepperoni|pepperoni slices]]) across one's torso, and that being able to watch the show is his dying wish.\n\nBecause of this (and because everyone thinks the name of the disease is sexy) an agreement is brokered between [[Make-A-Wish Foundation|Grant-a-Dream]] and [[NBC]] in which ''Gumbel 2 Gumbel'' will be put back on the air if NBC can get the [[film rights]] to Chris's death. Peter is overjoyed with ''Gumbel 2 Gumbel'' back on the air, and Chris uses his \"illness\" to his advantage in school. However, Peter panics upon learning that mourners are holding a candlelit vigil on their front lawn. When the network comes to claim their part of the deal, Lois finds out about the scam and tells Peter to tell the truth.

It guest-starred [[Martin Mull]] as Mr. Harris, and [[Fred Tatasciore]] as [[Chevy Chase]].\n\n==Plot summary==\n\n[[Chris Griffin|Chris]] has been failing school recently, and [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] puts her foot down and forbids him from watching [[television]] until his grades improve. Lois suggests to [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] that he help Chris with his [[study skills]]. This prompts Peter to lie to her about studying so that he and Chris can watch their favorite television show, ''Gumbel 2 Gumbel: Beach Justice'', a crime drama starring brothers [[Bryant Gumbel|Bryant]] and [[Greg Gumbel]]. However, he is disappointed to discover that the show has been canceled. To get it back on the air, Peter decides to tell the Grant-a-Dream Foundation that Chris is suffering from a made-up terminal illness called \"tumorsyphilisitisosis\", the symptoms of which include growing extra nipples (actually [[Pepperoni|pepperoni slices]]) across one's torso, and that being able to watch the show is his dying wish.\n\nBecause of this (and because everyone thinks the name of the disease is sexy) an agreement is brokered between [[Make-A-Wish Foundation|Grant-a-Dream]] and [[NBC]] in which ''Gumbel 2 Gumbel'' will be put back on the air if NBC can get the [[film rights]] to Chris's death. Peter is overjoyed with ''Gumbel 2 Gumbel'' back on the air, and Chris uses his \"illness\" to his advantage in school. However, Peter panics upon learning that mourners are holding a candlelit vigil on their front lawn. When the network comes to claim their part of the deal, Lois finds out about the scam and tells Peter to tell the truth. However, he finds out that he would face jail time for [[fraud|defrauding]] a charitable organization if he does. Acting out of desperation, he casually claims to have cured him with newfound healing powers and gets off the hook.\n\nPeter gets a reputation for being a healer, and people start worshiping him as a god, which [[God complex|he himself begins to believe]]; they even go as far as dressing like him and building a giant golden idol of him. Lois and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], however, continue to plead with Peter to admit he is not a [[god]], lest he wants divine wrath bestowed upon him by [[Yahweh|a real God]].

Just as [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia]] succeeds at opening [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] up about [[Allen Francis Doyle|Doyle]] and the events surrounding his death, she suffers a vision about an ancient Ethros demon, which turns out to have been possessing a young boy, Ryan Anderson, for years. Angel, [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce|Wesley]] and Cordelia perform an exorcism that expels the demon from the child, but it escapes the trap they set and roams free to possess once more. Even worse, they learn that the mass-murdering Ethros demon does ''not'' pose the biggest threat to the Anderson family's well-being.\n\n==Plot==\nCordelia finally gets Angel to talk about [[Allen Francis Doyle|Doyle's]] death when she suddenly has a vision. Angel and Wesley go to the envisioned house in the suburbs when a boy named Ryan from the house walks out onto the street. Angel saves him from an oncoming car, and he talks with the parents, Paige and Seth. Noticing that something is off but not sure what is going on, Angel takes advantage of Paige's overflowing gratitude and takes her up on a dinner invitation about which Seth clearly disapproves. Outside, Wesley finds glowing goo called \"plakticine\" (similar to [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]]) oozing from the foundation all around the house and they realize someone in the house is possessed by a powerful mass-murdering Ethros demon. Angel suspects the father, but the only way to be sure which family member is possessed is to have each ingest [[eucalyptus]] powder, which will force the demon to manifest. They mix the powder with brownies that Angel brings to dinner, where Angel watches Seth carefully and it isn't until the daughter Stephanie screams that he sees the demon horrifically manifesting in Ryan before the boy falls unconscious. Paige is frantic and accuses Angel of poisoning her son, but Seth supports Angel, reminding Paige that something has been truly wrong with the boy since long before Angel's advent. They agree to attempt an exorcism and take the boy and his parents back to Angel's place for preparations.\n\nCordelia establishes a magic circle of protection around the bed to bind Ryan there. Stressing that Ryan is not himself anymore, Angel warns Seth and Paige, particularly Paige, that they risk being killed if they break the barrier or go anywhere near the boy. Angel and Wesley try to make contact with the priest reputed to be professionally trained to perform exorcisms but find that he has died and they must attempt the exorcism themselves. Meanwhile, Ryan has seemingly regained consciousness and commences tormenting Paige with guilt at leaving him abandoned and alone in the dark. Her resolve breaks, and when she rushes to his side he begins strangling her; after a tense few minutes, Wesley and Angel rush into the bedroom and manage to pull Paige from Ryan's choke hold, but their efforts send the demon deeper, and the boy again lapses into unconsciousness. Upon learning from Cordelia's research that expelling the demon will send him to the nearest \"warm body\", Angel sends her to procure an Ethros box from Rick's Magick & Stuff, which is supposed to hold the Ethros demon. Rick's, however, does not have an Ethros Box, so Cordelia instead buys a box intended for another type of demon. While Cordelia shops, Wesley attempts the exorcism. He manages to raise the demon far enough to animate the boy once more, and the Ethros cruelly taunts him about his inadequacies as a youth and as a Watcher until Wesley grows visibly more distracted and vulnerable. He fails. Someone or something telekinetically uses marbles on the table to write the words, \"Save me\". The demon taunts Angel and he wraps his hand with a length of cloth, grabs the cross and Wesley's small volume of incantations, and strides into the bedroom. Holding the cross pressed to Ryan's chest, Angel ignores the pain of his hand sizzling through the protective layers and begins to chant, his voice growing louder and more commanding as he repeats the ritual phrases until, finally, he shouts, \"Now get the hell out!\" With an invisible rush, the demon is expelled from the boy, but the box Cordelia bought is unable to contain the demon's energy and shatters.\n\nSome time later, after sending the Andersons home, the AI team tries to determine the demon's current whereabouts. They realize the Ethros demon will need to take corporeal form to recharge itself after expending so much energy to escape. Leaving Cordelia behind, Wesley and Angel search the sea caves and find the Ethros demon. They are surprised when the evil being reveals that Ryan is  soulless and psychopathic. The demon had been inside the boy, but unable to manifest because of Ryan's naturally evil personality until Ryan ate Angel's brownies. They realize that the \"save me\" message was from the demon, and the boy walking in front of the car on the first night was the demon sleepwalking Ryan to kill him. Angel kills the demon swiftly, and he and Wesley realize that the Andersons are in even greater danger now that they believe themselves safe at last.\n\nThat night in the Andersons' home after everyone is asleep, Ryan, his door unlocked for the first time in a long time, steals matches from Seth's bedstand, then locks his parents' door shut with a toy block. Ignoring his now-awake parents as they struggle to open the door, the boy sloshes gasoline over his sister's toys and furniture, then lights a match and tosses it down. The room ignites with a whoosh, cutting Stephanie off from the door by a wall of flame. Seth and Paige finally burst out and find Ryan staring entranced at the roaring flames while Stephanie screams from behind them. Angel suddenly crashes through the window opposite and scoops Stephanie into his arms as Wesley hustles Ryan and his parents down the hall to safety. A little while later, Angel and Seth stand outside while firemen contain the blaze. Behind Seth, Paige and Stephanie huddle together near the front door. Detective [[Kate Lockley]] comes over to inform Seth that [[Social Services]] is taking custody of Ryan, and that they can see him in the morning, but that there won't be anything to report until after the evaluation. Angel informs Seth of what he discovered about Ryan and redirects his attention from the son he cannot save to the wife and daughter he has already protected. Almost imperceptibly nodding his thanks, Seth turns to embrace his welcoming family. Angel makes his own way out to the sidewalk.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\nThis was \"one of the very early scripts that we wrote before Doyle was killed,\" says writer [[Tim Minear]]. He struggled with the story until coming up with the idea that Angel should accidentally call Wesley \"Doyle\", which gave the script a cohesive theme about the pain of losing a family member.  At the end of the episode Seth Anderson loses his son, and at the beginning Angel has lost someone like a son; Minear says both are \"desperately trying to keep their family together, and through no fault of their own, they can't.\"<ref name=\"Minear\">{{Citation |title=ANGEL: Season One, Episode By Episode with Tim Minear - Part 3 |first=Edward |last=Gross |date=August 28, 2000 |publisher=TimMinear.net |accessdate=2007-09-17 |url=http://www.timminear.net/archives/angel/000041.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925144532/http://www.timminear.net/archives/angel/000041.html |archive-date=September 25, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Joss Whedon]] came up with the twist that Ryan Anderson was more evil than the demon who possessed him. He also cut the priest who, in the first draft of the script, performed the exorcism. Whedon questioned why Wesley couldn't perform the ritual, and Minear says, \"Suddenly it makes perfect sense, because Angel's problem at the beginning of the story is, 'I let Doyle die... because he did something that I couldn't do.' Now you have Wesley saying, 'I can perform this exorcism; you can't.'\" When Angel later saves Wesley's life, Minear says \"he's sort of atoning for the Doyle thing.\"<ref name=\"Minear\"/>\n\n===Continuity===\n* Cordelia squabbling in the kitchen with a coworker-turned-friend is so reminiscent of past episodes (e.g., \"[[Rm w/a Vu]]\"), that Angel actually calls Wesley 'Doyle.'\n* When Ethros speaks with Doyle's voice, he refers to events in \"[[Hero (Angel)|Hero]],\" also discussed earlier the previous day by Cordelia and Angel.\n* Just as he indicates to Cordelia at the end of \"[[Somnambulist (Angel)|Somnambulist]],\" Angel here tells Wesley that being prepared to kill him if he turns evil again is a good thing.\n* Angel and Wesley each seem to possess a double-bladed Bavarian fighting axe. Cordelia asks [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] about Angel's in \"[[I Will Remember You (Angel)|I Will Remember You]]\" when, believing [[Angel Investigations]] is closing its doors forever, she begins tagging items for inventory. Wesley brings his new one into the office in \"[[Expecting (Angel)|Expecting]],\" prompting Cordelia's friend Serena to remark, \"nice ax.\"\n* When Angel, Cordelia and Wesley initially suspect that the father is the possessed person, Wesley says that a father \"doesn't need to be possessed to terrorize his children,\" then quickly stops talking. This is one of the earliest hints at Wesley's issues with his own father.\n*This episode marks the second instance of a human being fully or partially soulless; the first was Buffy  in \"[[Living Conditions (Buffy episode)|Living Conditions]].\"\n\n===Cultural references===\n* [[I've Got You Under My Skin (song)|I've Got You Under My Skin]]: This episode shares its title with a song that became a signature of [[Frank Sinatra]].\n* [[Lizzie Borden]]: When Wesley mentions the famous Massachusetts woman accused of murdering her parents with an axe, Angel explains that the Ethros demon possessing her was only an adolescent.\n* [[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]: During the discussion about how to determine which Anderson family member is possessed, Cordelia asks if the demon will manifest by spinning its host's head around. Later, she asks whether Angel wants to protect his bedroom floor, in case there's \"any big vomiting.\" These phrases both refer to the film ''The Exorcist''. (Incidentally, Cordelia previously referred to ''The Exorcist'' in \"[[I Only Have Eyes for You (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|I Only Have Eyes for You]]\".)\n* [[Thighmaster]]: When Angel cites Wesley's lack of resistance even to sales suggestion, Wesley protests that his second Thighmaster was a free gift.\n* [[Fivefold kiss|Blessed be]]: Rick the Clerk's greeting to Cordelia is a common Wiccan greeting.\n* [[Nestl\u00e9|Nestl\u00e9 Bunny]]: Paige tries to coax Ryan out of his sulk by invoking this advertising mascot.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Angel (TV series)#I've Got You Under My Skin|I've Got You Under My Skin}}\n* {{IMDb episode|0512864|I've Got You Under My Skin}}\n* {{tv.com episode|angel/ive-got-you-under-my-skin-87|I've Got You Under My Skin}}\n\n{{Angel episodes}}\n\n[[Category:Angel (season 1) episodes]]\n[[Category:2000 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Television episodes about exorcism]]\n[[Category:Television episodes about psychopathy]]\n[[Category:Television episodes about families]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=May 2011}}\n{{long plot|date=March 2011}}\n{{original research|date=May 2011}}\n}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:I've Got You Under My Skin (''Angel'')}}\n\n{{Infobox television episode\n |title = I've Got You Under My Skin\n |series = [[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]\n |image = \n |caption = \n |season = 1\n |episode = 14\n |director = R.D.

Angel informs Seth of what he discovered about Ryan and redirects his attention from the son he cannot save to the wife and daughter he has already protected. Almost imperceptibly nodding his thanks, Seth turns to embrace his welcoming family. Angel makes his own way out to the sidewalk.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\nThis was \"one of the very early scripts that we wrote before Doyle was killed,\" says writer [[Tim Minear]]. He struggled with the story until coming up with the idea that Angel should accidentally call Wesley \"Doyle\", which gave the script a cohesive theme about the pain of losing a family member.  At the end of the episode Seth Anderson loses his son, and at the beginning Angel has lost someone like a son; Minear says both are \"desperately trying to keep their family together, and through no fault of their own, they can't.\"<ref name=\"Minear\">{{Citation |title=ANGEL: Season One, Episode By Episode with Tim Minear - Part 3 |first=Edward |last=Gross |date=August 28, 2000 |publisher=TimMinear.net |accessdate=2007-09-17 |url=http://www.timminear.net/archives/angel/000041.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925144532/http://www.timminear.net/archives/angel/000041.html |archive-date=September 25, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Joss Whedon]] came up with the twist that Ryan Anderson was more evil than the demon who possessed him. He also cut the priest who, in the first draft of the script, performed the exorcism. Whedon questioned why Wesley couldn't perform the ritual, and Minear says, \"Suddenly it makes perfect sense, because Angel's problem at the beginning of the story is, 'I let Doyle die... because he did something that I couldn't do.' Now you have Wesley saying, 'I can perform this exorcism; you can't.'\" When Angel later saves Wesley's life, Minear says \"he's sort of atoning for the Doyle thing.\"<ref name=\"Minear\"/>\n\n===Continuity===\n* Cordelia squabbling in the kitchen with a coworker-turned-friend is so reminiscent of past episodes (e.g., \"[[Rm w/a Vu]]\"), that Angel actually calls Wesley 'Doyle.'\n* When Ethros speaks with Doyle's voice, he refers to events in \"[[Hero (Angel)|Hero]],\" also discussed earlier the previous day by Cordelia and Angel.\n* Just as he indicates to Cordelia at the end of \"[[Somnambulist (Angel)|Somnambulist]],\" Angel here tells Wesley that being prepared to kill him if he turns evil again is a good thing.\n* Angel and Wesley each seem to possess a double-bladed Bavarian fighting axe. Cordelia asks [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] about Angel's in \"[[I Will Remember You (Angel)|I Will Remember You]]\" when, believing [[Angel Investigations]] is closing its doors forever, she begins tagging items for inventory. Wesley brings his new one into the office in \"[[Expecting (Angel)|Expecting]],\" prompting Cordelia's friend Serena to remark, \"nice ax.\"\n* When Angel, Cordelia and Wesley initially suspect that the father is the possessed person, Wesley says that a father \"doesn't need to be possessed to terrorize his children,\" then quickly stops talking. This is one of the earliest hints at Wesley's issues with his own father.\n*This episode marks the second instance of a human being fully or partially soulless; the first was Buffy  in \"[[Living Conditions (Buffy episode)|Living Conditions]].\"\n\n===Cultural references===\n* [[I've Got You Under My Skin (song)|I've Got You Under My Skin]]: This episode shares its title with a song that became a signature of [[Frank Sinatra]].\n* [[Lizzie Borden]]: When Wesley mentions the famous Massachusetts woman accused of murdering her parents with an axe, Angel explains that the Ethros demon possessing her was only an adolescent.\n* [[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]: During the discussion about how to determine which Anderson family member is possessed, Cordelia asks if the demon will manifest by spinning its host's head around. Later, she asks whether Angel wants to protect his bedroom floor, in case there's \"any big vomiting.\" These phrases both refer to the film ''The Exorcist''. (Incidentally, Cordelia previously referred to ''The Exorcist'' in \"[[I Only Have Eyes for You (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|I Only Have Eyes for You]]\".)\n* [[Thighmaster]]: When Angel cites Wesley's lack of resistance even to sales suggestion, Wesley protests that his second Thighmaster was a free gift.\n* [[Fivefold kiss|Blessed be]]: Rick the Clerk's greeting to Cordelia is a common Wiccan greeting.\n* [[Nestl\u00e9|Nestl\u00e9 Bunny]]: Paige tries to coax Ryan out of his sulk by invoking this advertising mascot.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Angel (TV series)#I've Got You Under My Skin|I've Got You Under My Skin}}\n* {{IMDb episode|0512864|I've Got You Under My Skin}}\n* {{tv.com episode|angel/ive-got-you-under-my-skin-87|I've Got You Under My Skin}}\n\n{{Angel episodes}}\n\n[[Category:Angel (season 1) episodes]]\n[[Category:2000 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Television episodes about exorcism]]\n[[Category:Television episodes about psychopathy]]\n[[Category:Television episodes about families]]\n", "name_user": "Gonnym", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27ve_Got_You_Under_My_Skin_(Angel)"}

Several place names that include the Spanish word for bear (''oso'') trace their origins back to that first overland expedition (e.g. [[Los Osos, California#Origin of name|Los Osos]]). As the settled frontier of [[New Spain]] was extended northward, settlers began to populate California and establish large cattle herds as the main industry. The ranchers\u2019 domesticated livestock were easy prey for the grizzly bears roaming freely across the state. By eating their livelihood and scaring them, the grizzlies became enemies of the [[Ranchos of California|rancheros]]. ''[[Vaquero]]s'' hunted the grizzlies, often roping and capturing them to be pitted against other animals in public battles.<ref name=\"Storer & Tevis 1955\"/>\n\nThese [[bear-baiting]] events flourished as popular spectacles in 19th century California.<ref name=SundaySport>{{cite web |title=The Brutal Bull-and-Bear Fights of 19th-Century California |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/bull-and-bear-fights-california |accessdate=2018-10-16}}</ref> Bloody fights that pitted bears against [[bull]]s<ref name=\"Storer & Tevis 1955\"/> often inspired betting as to whether [[Bear versus bull|the bear or the bull]] would win.

The incident was recalled in 1932 by Catherine E. Lovett Smith, and it was the biggest bear ever found in California. Lovett Smith witnessed the bear\u2019s killing on her family's ranch when she was six years old. (Other sources confirm her account of the bear, but differ as to its exact size.)

Later, this rebel flag became the basis for the state [[flag of California]], and then California was known as the \"Bear State.\"<ref name=\"Storer & Tevis 1955\">{{cite book |last1=Storer |first1=T.I. |last2=Tevis |first2=L.P. |title=California Grizzly |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QVZFQu01KcC&pg=PA149 |archive-url=https://archive.org/details/californiagrizzl00stor |url-access=registration |year=1996 |archive-date=1955 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley, CA]] |isbn=978-0-520-20520-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/californiagrizzl00stor/page/335 335], 42\u2013187}}</ref>\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nA 1953 researcher stated, \"The specific status of North American [[brown bear]]s (or grizzly bears) is one of the most complex problems of mammalian taxonomy.

Several place names that include the Spanish word for bear (''oso'') trace their origins back to that first overland expedition (e.g. [[Los Osos, California#Origin of name|Los Osos]]). As the settled frontier of [[New Spain]] was extended northward, settlers began to populate California and establish large cattle herds as the main industry. The ranchers\u2019 domesticated livestock were easy prey for the grizzly bears roaming freely across the state. By eating their livelihood and scaring them, the grizzlies became enemies of the [[Ranchos of California|rancheros]]. ''[[Vaquero]]s'' hunted the grizzlies, often roping and capturing them to be pitted against other animals in public battles.<ref name=\"Storer & Tevis 1955\"/>\n\n\nThese [[bear-baiting]] events flourished as popular spectacles in 19th century California.<ref name=SundaySport>{{cite web |title=The Brutal Bull-and-Bear Fights of 19th-Century California |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/bull-and-bear-fights-california |accessdate=2018-10-16}}</ref> Bloody fights that pitted bears against [[bull]]s<ref name=\"Storer & Tevis 1955\"/> often inspired betting as to whether [[Bear versus bull|the bear or the bull]] would win.

The incident was recalled in 1932 by Catherine E. Lovett Smith, and it was the biggest bear ever found in California. Lovett Smith witnessed the bear\u2019s killing on her family's ranch when she was six years old. (Other sources confirm her account of the bear, but differ as to its exact size.)

The last hunted California grizzly bear was shot in [[Tulare County, California]], in August 1922, although no body, skeleton or pelt was ever produced.
