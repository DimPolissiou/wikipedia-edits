He is said to have been descended from Prophet Mohammed's daughter [[Fatimah]]. Hence the Sheikh belonged to the [[Ashraf]] or [[Sayyid|Sada]], titles given to the descendants of the prophet. He married two local women in Somalia that left him eight sons, one of them being Abdirahman (Awal). The descendants of those eight sons are the what is known as Isaaq clan today.\n\nThe grave of Zubeyr Awal, the eponymous ancestor of the Habr Awal subclan of the [[Isaaq]], is located in Jidali in [[Sanaag]] which is about 100&nbsp;km east of the tomb of his grandfather Sheikh Ishaaq Bin Ahmed, the founding father of the [[Isaaq]] clan, whose tomb is located in the coastal town of [[Maydh]].\n\n===Medieval Period (Conquest of Abbysinia)===\n\nHistorically the Habr Awal were part of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and are mentioned in the famous \"Futuh Al-Habash\" for their major contributions in the [[Abyssinian-Adal war]] as the Habr Magaadle along with the [[Garhajis]], Arap and Ayub clans against the [[Abyssinian empire]], and also for producing a historical figure known as Ahmad Girri bin Husain who was the righthand partner of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] and a chieftain for the Habr Magaadle forces during the Abyssinian\u2013Adal war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://makhtota.ksu.edu.sa/makhtota/554/16|title=\u0645\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0637\u0627\u062a > \u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 > \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0631\u0642\u0645 16|website=makhtota.ksu.edu.sa|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Early Modern Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal have a rich mercantile history largely due to their possession of the major Somali port of [[Berbera]], which was the chief port and settlement of Habr Awal clan during the early modern period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reerahmednuux.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/piece-of-berbera-history-reer-ahmed-nuh-ismail/ |title=Piece of Berbera History: Reer Ahmed Nuh Ismail |website=wordpress.com|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Habr Awal as a whole are a rich people, mainly thanks to the trade passing though the port of Berbera which lies in the territory of the Sa\u2019ad Musa.<ref>{{cite book|title= Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Volume 5 |date=1969|pages=24|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Berbera Mosque Engraving.jpg|thumb|350px|Engraving of Berbera, including a Mosque and fort]]\nThe Habr Awal merchants had extensive trade relations with Arab and Indian merchants from Arabia and the Indian subcontinent respectively. When these foreign traders arrived in [[Berbera]] and [[Bulhar]] to conduct trade, there was a mutually beneficial arrangement based on the abban (protection) system between them and the local Ahmed Nuh and Yunis Nuh lineages of Sa\u2019ad Musa, Habr Awal:\n\n<blockquote>Before this, and prior to the British settlement at Aden in 1839, the Ayyal Yunis and Ayyal Ahmed lineages of the Habr Awal clan had held Berbera and jointly managed its trade, sharing in the profits on all commercial transactions as \u2018protectors\u2019 (abans) of foreign merchants from Arabia and India. When under the stimulus of developments at Aden the port\u2019s prosperity markedly increased, the numerically dominant Ayyal Yunis drove out their rival kinsmen and declared themselves commercial masters of Berbera. This led to a feud in which each side sought outside help; the defeated Ayyal Yunis turned to Haji Shirmarke \u2018Ali and his Habr Yunis clansmen for support. With this backing, they were then able to re-establish themselves and to expel the Ayyal Yunis who moved to the small roadstead of Bulhar, some miles to the west of Berbera.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.M.|title= The Modern History of Somaliland: from Nation to State |date=1965|publisher=Praeger|pages=35|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNot only did the Habr Awal host foreign merchants at their ports, they also conducted trade missions on their own vessels to the Arabian ports<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prichard|first1=J.

The majority of the Somali merchants who frequented Aden and other Southern Arabian ports hailed from the Habr Awal clan. They procured various raw goods from Harar and the interior in exchange for manufactured goods. During their stay, the Habr Awal rented their own houses and hired their own servants, whereas other Somali clans tended to stay with relatives already established across the Gulf. \n\n<blockquote>Merchants. \u2014 These are generally members of the Habr Awal tribe. They bring from Harrar and the Galla country, coffee, saffron (bastard), tusks (ivory), and feathers, taking away in return zinc, brass, broad cloth, and piece goods. They remain in Aden for about twenty days at a time during the trading season, which lasts about nine months,' making four trips. During their residence they hire a house, and are accompanied by their own domestics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Frederick|title=An Account of the British Settlement of Aden in Arabia|date=1877|publisher=Cengage Gale|pages=41|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the interior, Habr Awal trade caravans (khafilas) were a frequent sight according to contemporary European accounts of the Somali Peninsula:\n\n<blockquote>On leaving Hargeisa we travelled for many miles through beautiful park-like land, alive with birds and jungle fowl. We met the usual Somali khafilas [trading caravans] of Habr-Awal men, carrying their skins, gums, ghee, and coffee to our port at Bulhar, situated between Berbera and Zeila.<ref>'Twixt sirdar & Menelik: an account of a year's expedition from Zeila to Cairo, p. 18, 1901</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Somalis from the deep interior, principally those from the [[Ogaden (clan)|Ogaden]], also gained most of their resources from the Habr Awal merchants who they called \"iidoor\", an enviable pejorative meaning [[merchant]] or trader, a reference to the mercantile nature of the Habr Awal traders at the time.<ref name=\"Info\">Somali Poetry, Lewis & Adrzejewski, 1964, pp. 111\u2013115</ref>\n\n===British Protectorate Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal clan came under the [[British Protectorate]] by signing a treaty with the [[British Empire]] on 14 July 1884. The Habr Awal continued a to have a lucrative trading agreement with Arabs and Indian traders, many of whom were also under British rule in their respective nations.

Habr Awal Commanders carried out many successful operations that led to the decisive victory of the group and to the downfall of the Siad Barre regime.\n\nIn western Somaliland, this group was prominently represented in the 99 division of the [[Somali National Movement]] which was founded in [[Gabiley]] with the majority of the divisions troops consisting of militia fighters hailing from the Jibril Abokor section of the Sa'ad Muuse sub-clan of the Habr Awal that dominates the [[Gabiley]] region. The 99 division was Commanded by General [[Mohamed Hasan Abdullahi]] (Jidhif) of the Jibril Abokor who successfully conquered [[Awdal]] region and completely erased the presence of [[Somali National Army]] forces within [[Gabiley]] and [[Awdal]] and forced the local [[Gadabursi]] inhabitants of [[Awdal]] to pledge loyalty to [[Somaliland]]. As commander of the 99 division, General [[Mohamed Hasan Abdullahi]] (Jidhif) also established a [[Somali National Movement]] military base in [[Zeila]] where the [[Somali National Movement|SNM]] occupied the Awdal region for 4 years and successfully defeated attempts by USF militia forces loyal to [[Djibouti]] who tried to take advantage of the fall of Siad Barre's [[Military Junta]] in 1991 and annex the city of [[Zeila]].<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=lAyeNqKK7bQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=jibril+abokor+militia#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= Hassan Ali Jama, Who cares about Somalia |isbn= 9783899300758 |last1= Jama |first1= Hassan Ali |year= 2005 }}</ref>\n\nIn central Somaliland, [[Muse Bihi Abdi]] and his Hussein Abokor section of the Sa'ad Muuse sub-clan of the Habr Awal successfully liberated [[Hargeisa]] from the brutal communist regime and played a preeminent role for the SNM where they liberated [[Hargeisa]], and [[Faraweyne]].

He is said to have been descended from Prophet Mohammed's daughter [[Fatimah]]. Hence the Sheikh belonged to the [[Ashraf]] or [[Sayyid|Sada]], titles given to the descendants of the prophet. He married two local women in Somalia that left him eight sons, one of them being Abdirahman (Awal). The descendants of those eight sons are the what is known as Isaaq clan today.\n\nThe grave of Zubeyr Awal, the eponymous ancestor of the Habr Awal subclan of the [[Isaaq]], is located in Jidali in [[Sanaag]] which is about 100&nbsp;km east of the tomb of his grandfather Sheikh Ishaaq Bin Ahmed, the founding father of the [[Isaaq]] clan, whose tomb is located in the coastal town of [[Maydh]].\n\n===Medieval Period (Conquest of Abbysinia)===\n\nHistorically the Habr Awal were part of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and are mentioned in the famous \"Futuh Al-Habash\" for their major contributions in the [[Abyssinian-Adal war]] as the Habr Magaadle along with the [[Garhajis]], Arap and Ayub clans against the [[Abyssinian empire]], and also for producing a historical figure known as Ahmad Girri bin Husain who was the righthand partner of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] and a chieftain for the Habr Magaadle forces during the Abyssinian\u2013Adal war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://makhtota.ksu.edu.sa/makhtota/554/16|title=\u0645\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0637\u0627\u062a > \u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 > \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0631\u0642\u0645 16|website=makhtota.ksu.edu.sa|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Early Modern Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal have a rich mercantile history largely due to their possession of the major Somali port of [[Berbera]], which was the chief port and settlement of Habr Awal clan during the early modern period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reerahmednuux.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/piece-of-berbera-history-reer-ahmed-nuh-ismail/ |title=Piece of Berbera History: Reer Ahmed Nuh Ismail |website=wordpress.com|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Habr Awal as a whole are a rich people, mainly thanks to the trade passing though the port of Berbera which lies in the territory of the Sa\u2019ad Musa.<ref>{{cite book|title= Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Volume 5 |date=1969|pages=24|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Berbera Mosque Engraving.jpg|thumb|350px|Engraving of Berbera, including a Mosque and fort]]\nThe Habr Awal merchants had extensive trade relations with Arab and Indian merchants from Arabia and the Indian subcontinent respectively. When these foreign traders arrived in [[Berbera]] and [[Bulhar]] to conduct trade, there was a mutually beneficial arrangement based on the abban (protection) system between them and the local Ahmed Nuh and Yunis Nuh lineages of Sa\u2019ad Musa, Habr Awal:\n\n<blockquote>Before this, and prior to the British settlement at Aden in 1839, the Ayyal Yunis and Ayyal Ahmed lineages of the Habr Awal clan had held Berbera and jointly managed its trade, sharing in the profits on all commercial transactions as \u2018protectors\u2019 (abans) of foreign merchants from Arabia and India. When under the stimulus of developments at Aden the port\u2019s prosperity markedly increased, the numerically dominant Ayyal Yunis drove out their rival kinsmen and declared themselves commercial masters of Berbera. This led to a feud in which each side sought outside help; the defeated Ayyal Yunis turned to Haji Shirmarke \u2018Ali and his Habr Yunis clansmen for support. With this backing, they were then able to re-establish themselves and to expel the Ayyal Yunis who moved to the small roadstead of Bulhar, some miles to the west of Berbera.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.M.|title= The Modern History of Somaliland: from Nation to State |date=1965|publisher=Praeger|pages=35|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNot only did the Habr Awal host foreign merchants at their ports, they also conducted trade missions on their own vessels to the Arabian ports<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prichard|first1=J.

The majority of the Somali merchants who frequented Aden and other Southern Arabian ports hailed from the Habr Awal clan. They procured various raw goods from Harar and the interior in exchange for manufactured goods. During their stay, the Habr Awal rented their own houses and hired their own servants, whereas other Somali clans tended to stay with relatives already established across the Gulf. \n\n<blockquote>Merchants. \u2014 These are generally members of the Habr Awal tribe. They bring from Harrar and the Galla country, coffee, saffron (bastard), tusks (ivory), and feathers, taking away in return zinc, brass, broad cloth, and piece goods. They remain in Aden for about twenty days at a time during the trading season, which lasts about nine months,' making four trips. During their residence they hire a house, and are accompanied by their own domestics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Frederick|title=An Account of the British Settlement of Aden in Arabia|date=1877|publisher=Cengage Gale|pages=41|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the interior, Habr Awal trade caravans (khafilas) were a frequent sight according to contemporary European accounts of the Somali Peninsula:\n\n<blockquote>On leaving Hargeisa we travelled for many miles through beautiful park-like land, alive with birds and jungle fowl. We met the usual Somali khafilas [trading caravans] of Habr-Awal men, carrying their skins, gums, ghee, and coffee to our port at Bulhar, situated between Berbera and Zeila.<ref>'Twixt sirdar & Menelik: an account of a year's expedition from Zeila to Cairo, p. 18, 1901</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Somalis from the deep interior, principally those from the [[Ogaden (clan)|Ogaden]], also gained most of their resources from the Habr Awal merchants who they called \"iidoor\", an enviable pejorative meaning [[merchant]] or trader, a reference to the mercantile nature of the Habr Awal traders at the time.<ref name=\"Info\">Somali Poetry, Lewis & Adrzejewski, 1964, pp. 111\u2013115</ref>\n\n===British Protectorate Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal clan came under the [[British Protectorate]] by signing a treaty with the [[British Empire]] on 14 July 1884.

The first division is between those lineages descended from sons of Sheikh Isaaq by a [[Harari people|Harari]] woman \u2013 the Habr Habuusheed \u2013 and those descended from sons of Sheikh Isaaq by a [[Somali people|Somali]] woman of the Magaadle sub-clan of the [[Dir (clan)|Dir]] \u2013 the Habr Magaadle. Indeed, most of the largest clans of the clan-family are in fact uterine alliances hence the matronymic \"Habr\" which in archaic [[Somali language|Somali]] means \"mother\".<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=yoMBQCr4LysC |title = A Pastoral Democracy: A Study of Pastoralism and Politics Among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa|isbn = 9783825830847|last1 = Lewis|first1 = I.

{"title_page": "GT-Power", "text_new": "{{primary sources|date=July 2017}}\n'''GT Power''' is a bulletin board system (BBS) and dial-up telecommunications/terminal application for MS-DOS.  It was first introduced in the 1980s by '''P & M Software''', founded by Paul Meiners. GT Power can be used both to host a BBS as well as to connect to other BBS systems via its full-featured dial-up \"terminal mode.\"  GT Power was a shareware package that required a registration fee in order to access its proprietary network mail transport/handling software and, by default, the ''GT Power Network''.  The software is distributed in two \"flavors\"; a terminal-only version, nicknamed ''GTO'', and the full-featured host and terminal version.  \n\nThe source code for GT Power was sold twice during the late 1990s, again in 2008 and is currently the property of Tom Watt.\n\n.\n\n==History==\nGT Power was originally a telecommunications/terminal application, known as ''GT Powercomm'', which could be used to dial-up other BBS systems.  As time passed, a host mode was written into the application which allowed the user to accept incoming data calls.  Before the release of version 13.00 (released Autumn, 1987), the host mode portion of the application had been expanded to become a full-blown BBS host application, complete with message and file areas, file uploading and downloading, the capability to host BBS door programs, and a sysop-to-user chat mode.\n\nThe name was shortened to ''GT Power'' sometime before the release of version 14.03 in the Autumn of 1988.\n\nWith version 13.00, P & M software began offering a proprietary ''Netmail Suite''; a set of  applications which allow GT Power BBS systems to connect and exchange routed person-to-person '''netmail'''.  By the time version 14.03 was released, the suite was expanded to include the ability to also exchange '''echomail''' between systems, similar to FidoNet echomail.  Upon registering GT Power, the user obtained a special password which enabled the Netmail Suite applications, and a key code that disabled any registration reminder delays in GT Power.\n\nThe Netmail Suite consisted of a mail transfer program and two mail handling programs.  The mail transfer program, called ''MDRIVer'', was used to dial other GT Power systems, to authenticate their identity, and to transfer mail between the two systems.  The mail handling programs were used to \"bag\" mail and prepare it for transfer (''MBAGger''), and to unpack received mail and distribute it to the proper message areas (''MDIST'').\n\nP & M  Software released its last version of GT Power, version 19.00, in September, 1994.  In mid-February, 1998, it was announced that P&M Software had sold the GT Power source code to '''New Millennium Software'''.  New Millennium renamed the project '''GT 2000''' but, by the end of April,  it was announced that New Millennium would not develop the product. The source was sold again to Dennis Berry, a GT Power sysop.\n\nIn late 1999, Berry released a Y2K bug fix for the Netmail Suite. A third party Y2K fix for the Suite, as well as other third party companion software, was also released. The GT Power application itself appeared to have no Y2K issues, with 19.00 being the latest release.\n\nThe source code and rights were sold to Tom Watt in June 2008 and he has resumed development of GT-Power. For the first time since Paul stopped development, the source code has been made to compile the EXEs as they were last released in 1994.\n\n<br />\n\n==Third party software==\nMany [[third party software component|third party software packages]] were developed to support the GT Power BBS.  Early distributions of GT Power included a third party application called ''GTCTL'', written by James Davis, followed later by ''Sysop Tools'',  written by Chris Smith.  Both were later replaced by the P & M ''SYSOP'' program.  Unlike SYSOP, Sysop Tools had an ANSI-style DOS graphic user interface.  All three were used mostly for user and control file maintenance.  Other third-party software includes:\n\n* external message readers, allowing the sysop to read & enter messages locally without [[logging into]] the BBS;\n* a QWK mail application, which could be added as a door or external menu option, that pre-dates and is more configurable than the built-in version (it could also be used for QWK networking);\n* [[Command line]]/[[batch file]] applications which allow GT Power systems to participate in Fidonet, [[RIME]], and QWK networking;\n* applications which create popular door drop file formats, such as DOORINF and [[DOOR.SYS]], allowing GT Power systems access to more BBS door software;\n* an application that allowed full-screen message editing, before it was included in GT Power;\n* an interface which allowed earlier GT Power systems to run the [[PCBoard]] door ''Prodoor'';\n* applications which allow GT Power systems to add [[Usenet]] [[newsgroups]] and [[Internet]] [[e-mail]] capability;\n* an application which allowed GT Power systems to exchange mail via Internet e-mail file attachments;\n* applications which allowed GT Power users to change their passwords online (since added to GT Power), as well as to force users to change passwords after a specified time;\n* various usage reporting applications;\n* various other applications.\n\nA third-party mail transfer program, called ''Mailrun'', was developed which allows GT Power Network systems to transfer mail using the bi-directional [[HS/Link]] protocol.  In theory, the use of the bi-directional protocol (which sent and received files at the same time) will shorten the length of dial-up netmail calls, saving the sysop some long-distance phone charges.  This program can be used as a replacement for the proprietary MDRIVer program, but requires the use of the proprietary MBAGger & MDIST programs.  With proper setup, Mailrun can co-exist with MDRIVer, allowing systems to use both programs to transfer mail.  Mailrun is [[freeware]], but does require a free key code from the developer in order to connect with other systems.  Mailrun is stated to be compatible with GT Power versions 17.00 through 19.00, but can work with earlier versions.\n\nIn addition, in 1989, a third-party mail handling application, called ''JDMAL'', was released.  It was developed by James Davis, who had previously worked with Meiners in developing the proprietary suite.  It could be used as a replacement for the proprietary MBAGger & MDIST  programs, but did not replace the MDRIVer program.  The last few releases of JDMAL, versions 8.1 and later, were freeware, and were compatible with GT Power versions 13.00 through 14.03.\n\n==The GT Power Network==\nAs the GT Power software application evolved to include a BBS host mode, P & M Software developed a Netmail Suite package which allowed registered users of GT Power to participate in the GT Power Network.  With this Netmail Suite, GT Power BBS systems could exchange netmail and echomail with each other.\n\nAs use of GT Power increased, the network grew.  At various times during the late 1980s/early 1990s, the Network included hundreds of nodes in the continental [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Hawaii]], [[China]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Bermuda]], the [[Caribbean]] and much of [[Europe]].<ref>GT Power Network Historical Nodelist</ref>  The proprietary nature of the networking software, combined with the lack of easy-to-configure built-in support for other networking methods, has held the number of nodes below those found on [[Fidonet]].\n\nLike Fidonet, the GT Power Network offered both netmail and echomail. Where netmail is usually system-to-system, person-to-person mail, echomail was intended to be read & possibly replied to by users on all GT Power Network BBS systems.  Each echo had a different topic, such as politics, computer technical support, and ANSI art.  The GT Power Network's application of echomail was different from Fidonet in that echomail messages traveled back to the moderator's (or \"sponsor's\") BBS before being distributed to the rest of the network.  This had the advantage of allowing the moderator to review every message before it was allowed to echo to the rest of the network, creating the potential for a truly moderated echo conference.  On the downside, a slight disruption in network routing could cause active echos to appear quite stale.\n\nAround the beginning of 1990, there was a rift in the GT Power Network, resulting in the formation of a second network based on GT Power.  The ''Alliance of Free Sysops Network'', or ''AFSN'', was formed, with some GT Power sysops finding ways to participate in both networks.  By 1992, as AFSN sysops began migrating to other BBS software, the network had expanded to include both GT Power and QWK networking nodes, some of which had never run GT Power software.  The AFSN either folded, or merged with another QWK network, sometime in the late 1990s.\n\nLike many other BBS networks, as use of the Internet increased, the GT Power network began a decline.  Today, the GT Power Network continues on, albeit on a much smaller scale than before.  Many nodes on the network today participate in echomail via QWK networking as the former GT Power sysops have migrated to Windows and [[Linux]] native BBS applications.  These other applications do not support the GT Power proprietary mail programs.\n\n==GT Power today==\nMost GT Power sysops have either retired their BBS systems or have migrated to other applications.  Nearly all of the remaining GT Power Network BBS systems have replaced their dial-up networking with forms of mail transfer that take advantage of the Internet, by using either e-mail file attachments or some form of automated [[ftp]].\n\nAt least one dial-up GT Power BBS still exists in [[North America]].<ref>[http://www.bbsing.com/bbslists/bbslists.html The BBS Corner's US & Canada Dial-Up BBS Guide] via bbsing.com, and verified May 17, 2008</ref>  The [[Capitol City Online]] BBS, which has been online for over 20 years, currently offers both dial-up and telnet access to its callers.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[List of BBS software]]\n* [[List of bulletin board systems]]\n* ''[[BBS: The Documentary]]''\n* [[ANSI art]]\n* [[terminal emulator|Terminal software]]\n* [[QWK (file format)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Referencesbvccxxx==\n==External links==\n*GT-Power Homepage, the new home page for GT-Power.\n*Capitol City Online homepage, a bbs running GT Power.\n*''PDQWK''.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gt-Power}}\n[[Category:Bulletin board system software]]\n[[Category:DOS software]]\n", "text_old": "{{primary sources|date=July 2017}}\n{{Infobox software\n| name                   = GT-Power\n| logo                   = <!-- Image name is enough -->\n| logo alt               = \n| screenshot             = <!-- Image name is enough -->\n| caption                = \n| screenshot alt         = \n| collapsible            = \n| author                 = Paul Meiners\n| developer              = P & M Software\n| released               = 1980s<!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| discontinued           = \n| latest release version = \n| latest release date    = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| latest preview version = \n| latest preview date    = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| status                 = \n| programming language   = \n| operating system       = \n| platform               = [[MS-DOS]]\n| size                   = \n| language               = \n| language count         = <!-- Number only -->\n| language footnote      = \n| genre                  = [[bulletin board system]] (BBS), [[Plain old telephone service|dial-up telecommunications]]/terminal application\n| license                = \n| alexa                  = \n| website                = <!--{{URL|example.org}}-->\n| standard               = \n| AsOf                   = \n}}\n'''GT Power''' is a [[bulletin board system]] (BBS) and [[Plain old telephone service|dial-up telecommunications]]/terminal application for [[MS-DOS]].

When it is running under OS/2 or eComStation, GT Power can also be used as a [[telnet]] BBS host and terminal program via use of an OS/2 shareware virtual [[modem]] application called [[VMODEM]].\n\n==History==\nGT Power was originally a telecommunications/terminal application, known as ''GT Powercomm'', which could be used to dial-up other BBS systems.  As time passed, a [[bulletin board system|host mode]] was written into the application which allowed the user to accept incoming data calls.

New Millennium renamed the project '''GT 2000''' but, by the end of April,  it was announced that New Millennium would not develop the product. The source was sold again to Dennis Berry, a GT Power sysop.\n\nIn late 1999, Berry released a [[Y2K]] [[bug fix]] for the Netmail Suite. A third party Y2K fix for the Suite, as well as other [[third party software component|third party companion software]], was also released. The GT Power application itself appeared to have no Y2K issues, with 19.00 being the latest release.\n\nThe source code and rights were sold to Tom Watt in June 2008 and he has resumed development of GT-Power. For the first time since Paul stopped development, the source code has been made to compile the EXEs as they were last released in 1994.\n\n==Features==\nThe following list of features applies to the most-recent version of GT Power (19.00).<ref>GT Power 19.00 documentation</ref>\n\nFeatures of both the terminal and host modes:\n\n* [[ANSI]] and [[VT-52]] [[terminal emulation]];\n* [[ANSI art|ANSI]] color graphics and music support that does not require [[ANSI.SYS]] (introduced version 12.20);\n* [[Remote Imaging Protocol|RIP]] graphics support (ver. 19.00);\n* support for multiple dialing directories, with up to 999 entries each (terminal mode);\n* circular dialing queue, and redial-on-busy (terminal mode);\n* a script language, for creating dialing and other scripts;\n* user-assignable function key/macro support;\n* built-in [[file transfer protocol|file-transfer protocols]], including [[Xmodem]], [[WXmodem]], [[Ymodem]], [[SEAlink]], [[Telink]], & MegaLink;\n* support for up to 18 additional \"external\" file-transfer protocols, such as [[Zmodem]] and [[HS/Link]];\n* support for non-standard [[COM port]]s (3-8), & non-standard IRQs (up to [[Interrupt request|IRQ]] 15);\n* support for 300-33.6k [[baud]] [[modems]], [[16550 UART]], and locked port speeds up to 115200;\n* [[DESQview]], DoubleDos, Windows, and OS/2 aware;\n* [[caller-id]] support;\n* optional capture mode and scroll-back buffering;\n* the ability to use PC-Pursuit<ref>PC Pursuit was a semi-nationwide network pay service which allowed BBS users to dial local numbers to access BBS systems that would otherwise be a long-distance telephone call.  The system being called had to be located in a city that was \"PC-Pursuitable.\"  PC-Pursuit would complete the call and connect the systems.</ref>  to make outgoing calls, both in terminal mode and with ''MDRIVer''.\n\nIn addition, the BBS host mode has the following features:\n\n* Built-in [[QWK (file format)|QWK]] mail and QWK networking support (non-proprietary);\n* semi-configurable menus and prompts;\n* support for multiple message areas (ver. 12.10) and file areas (prior to ver. 12.00);\n* proprietary Netmail Suite with netmail and echomail support (ver. 13.00);\n* full-screen ANSI message editing;\n* [[CD-ROM]] file area support;\n* FILE.DIZ support for file uploads;\n* multinode capable, on a network or under [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] software, such as DESQview or OS/2;\n* multinode ''CB'' chat (users can chat between nodes);\n* time banking;\n* threaded reading of messages;\n* Carbon-Copy list support in messages;\n* Return Receipt message support in netmail;\n* support for up to 999 external BBS door programs (ver. 19.00; doors introduced ver. 12.20);\n* mailboxes for private user-to-user mail exchange (ver. 19.00);\n* variable substitution and ''@ macros'' for bulletin and menu files;\n* user-configurable multiple language support;\n* user-configurable questionnaire/voting booth functions (ver. 12.20);\n* user-configurable automatic [[virus scan]] of uploaded files;\n* the ability to set up \"freebie\" file downloads and file areas;\n* user-configurable access levels and controls (introduced before ver. 12.00);\n* a task scheduler, for scheduling daily maintenance, etc. (ver. 13.00);\n* two distinct varieties of ''RINGBACK'' service, one of which allows sysops to run a BBS on a voice line (ver. 13.00);\n* a user maintenance program, called ''SYSOP'' (ver. 15.00);\n* the ability to accept a \"hand-off\" from front-end programs, such as [[Binkleyterm]].\n\nOther features can be added via the use of third-party software and add-ons.\n\n===Telnet use===\n\nGT Power also has the [[undocumented feature]] of [[telnet]] compatibility, in both BBS host and terminal mode, when used with a virtual modem software package called VMODEM under the OS/2 and eComStation operating systems.\n\n==Third party software==\nMany [[third party software component|third party software packages]] were developed to support the GT Power BBS.  Early distributions of GT Power included a third party application called ''GTCTL'', written by James Davis, followed later by ''Sysop Tools'',  written by Chris Smith.

The GT Power Network's application of echomail was different from Fidonet in that echomail messages traveled back to the moderator's (or \"sponsor's\") BBS before being distributed to the rest of the network.  This had the advantage of allowing the moderator to review every message before it was allowed to echo to the rest of the network, creating the potential for a truly moderated echo conference.  On the downside, a slight disruption in network routing could cause active echos to appear quite stale.\n\nAround the beginning of 1990, there was a rift in the GT Power Network, resulting in the formation of a second network based on GT Power.  The ''Alliance of Free Sysops Network'', or ''AFSN'', was formed, with some GT Power sysops finding ways to participate in both networks.  By 1992, as AFSN sysops began migrating to other BBS software, the network had expanded to include both GT Power and QWK networking nodes, some of which had never run GT Power software.  The AFSN either folded, or merged with another QWK network, sometime in the late 1990s.\n\nLike many other BBS networks, as use of the Internet increased, the GT Power network began a decline.  Today, the GT Power Network continues on, albeit on a much smaller scale than before.  Many nodes on the network today participate in echomail via QWK networking as the former GT Power sysops have migrated to Windows and [[Linux]] native BBS applications.  These other applications do not support the GT Power proprietary mail programs.\n\n==GT Power today==\nMost GT Power sysops have either retired their BBS systems or have migrated to other applications.  Nearly all of the remaining GT Power Network BBS systems have replaced their dial-up networking with forms of mail transfer that take advantage of the Internet, by using either e-mail file attachments or some form of automated [[ftp]].\n\nAt least one dial-up GT Power BBS still exists in [[North America]].<ref>[http://www.bbsing.com/bbslists/bbslists.html The BBS Corner's US & Canada Dial-Up BBS Guide] via bbsing.com, and verified May 17, 2008</ref>  The [[Capitol City Online]] BBS, which has been online for over 20 years, currently offers both dial-up and telnet access to its callers.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[List of BBS software]]\n* [[List of bulletin board systems]]\n* ''[[BBS: The Documentary]]''\n* [[ANSI art]]\n* [[terminal emulator|Terminal software]]\n* [[QWK (file format)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gtpowerbbs.com GT-Power Homepage], the new home page for GT-Power.\n*[http://members.iglou.com/mlp/cco Capitol City Online] homepage, a bbs running GT Power.\n*[http://home.clara.net/orac/gt.htm Paul Ratcliffe's GT Utilities page], home of third party companion programs ''Mailrun'' and ''PDQWK''.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gt-Power}}\n[[Category:Bulletin board system software]]\n[[Category:DOS software]]\n", "name_user": "111.119.187.18", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GT-Power"}
{"title_page": "Independence of clones criterion", "text_new": "{{more sources|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn [[voting system]]s theory, the '''independence of clones criterion''' measures an election method's robustness to [[strategic nomination]]. [[Nicolaus Tideman]] was the first to formulate this criterion, which states that the winner must not change due to the addition of a non-winning candidate who is similar to a candidate already present.<ref>T. Nicolaus Tideman, \"Independence of clones as a criterion for voting rules\", ''Social Choice and Welfare'' Vol. 4, No. 3 (1987), pp. 185&ndash;206.</ref>\nTo be more precise, a subset of the candidates, called a set of clones, exists if no voter ranks any candidate outside the set between (or equal to) any candidates that are in the set. If a set of clones contains at least two candidates, the criterion requires that deleting one of the clones must not increase or decrease the winning chance of any candidate not in the set of clones.\n\nIn some systems (such as the [[plurality vote]]), the addition of a similar candidate divides support between similar candidates, which can cause them both to lose. In some other systems (such as the [[Borda count]]), the addition of a similar alternative increases the apparent support for one of the similar candidates, which can cause it to win. In yet other systems (such as [[ranked pairs]]), the introduction of similar alternatives does not affect the chances of the dissimilar candidates, as required by the criterion. There are further systems where the effect of the additional similar alternatives depends on the distribution of other votes.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n== Clone negative and clone positive ==\nElection methods that fail independence of clones can be clone negative (the addition of a similar candidate decreases another candidate's chance of winning) or clone positive (the addition of a similar candidate increases another candidate's chance of winning). \n\nA method can also fail the independence of clones method in a way that's neither clone positive nor negative. This happens if the method changes its decision about the winner when a non-winning candidate is cloned, but the new winner is not the candidate that was cloned. The effect is called crowding.\n\nThe [[Borda count]] is an example of a clone positive method. [[Plurality voting]] is an example of a clone negative method because of [[vote-splitting]]. [[Copeland's method]] is an example of a method that exhibits crowding.\n\n== Compliant methods ==\n\n[[Instant-runoff voting]] and some election methods that comply with the [[Condorcet criterion]] such as [[ranked pairs]] and the [[Schulze method]]<ref>M. Schulze, \"A New Monotonic and Clone-Independent Single-Winner Election Method\", ''Voting Matters'' 17 (2003), pp 9&ndash;19.</ref> also meet independence of clones.\n\nThe interpretation of the term \"set of clones\" for scored voting systems is controversial. If clones are candidates that are considered nearly identical by the voters, [[range voting]] and [[majority judgment]] satisfy the criterion. If clones also include candidates that are still similar but clearly superior to an existing candidate, that superior clone can win in range voting, even if no inferior clone of that candidate would have won. However, since range voting and majority judgment satisfy the [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]] criterion, the addition of clones never helps or harms candidates who are already present.\n\nSome of the other methods that fail the criterion are the [[Borda count]], [[Minimax Condorcet|minimax]], the [[Kemeny\u2013Young method]], [[Copeland's method]], [[Bucklin voting]], the [[plurality voting system|plurality vote]], and the [[two-round system]]. Variants of [[Instant-runoff voting]] that eliminate multiple candidates per round (e.g. the [[contingent vote]]) or forbid the voters from ranking all the candidates (e.g. the [[supplementary vote]]) also fail the criterion.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Borda count ===\n{{Main|Borda count}}\n\nConsider an election in which there are two candidates, A and B. Suppose the voters have the following preferences:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n| 66%: A>B\n| 34%: B>A\n|}\n\nCandidate A would receive 66% Borda points (66%\u00d71 + 34%\u00d70) and B would receive 34% (66%\u00d70 + 34%\u00d71). Thus candidate A would win by a 66% landslide.\n\nNow suppose supporters of B nominate an additional candidate, B<sub>2</sub>, that is very similar to B but considered inferior by all voters. For the 66% who prefer A, B continues to be their second choice. For the 34% who prefer B, A continues to be their least preferred candidate. Now the voters' preferences are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n| 66%: A>B>B<sub>2</sub>\n| 34%: B>B<sub>2</sub>>A\n|}\n\nCandidate A now has 132% Borda points (66%\u00d72 + 34%\u00d70). B has 134% (66%\u00d71 + 34%\u00d72). B<sub>2</sub> has 34% (66%\u00d70 + 34%\u00d71). The nomination of B<sub>2</sub> changes the winner from A to B, overturning the landslide, even though the additional information about voters' preferences is redundant due to the similarity of B<sub>2</sub> to B.\n\nSimilar examples can be constructed to show that ''given the Borda count, any arbitrarily large landslide can be overturned by adding enough candidates'' (assuming at least one voter prefers the landslide loser). For example, to overturn a 90% landslide preference for A over B, add 9 alternatives similar/inferior to B. Then A's score would be 900% (90%\u00d710 + 10%\u00d70) and B's score would be 910% (90%\u00d79 + 10%\u00d710).\n\nNo knowledge of the voters' preferences is needed to exploit this strategy. Factions could simply nominate as many alternatives as possible that are similar to their preferred alternative.\n\nIn typical elections, game theory suggests this manipulability of Borda can be expected to be a serious problem, particularly when a significant number of voters can be expected to vote their sincere order of preference (as in public elections, where many voters are not strategically sophisticated; cite Michael R. Alvarez of Caltech). Small minorities typically have the power to nominate additional candidates, and typically it is easy to find additional candidates that are similar.\n\nIn the context of people running for office, people can take similar positions on the issues, and in the context of voting on proposals, it is easy to construct similar proposals. Game theory suggests that all factions would seek to nominate as many similar candidates as possible since the winner would depend on the number of similar candidates, regardless of the voters' preferences.\n\n=== Copeland ===\n{{Main|Copeland's method}}\nThis examples show that Copeland's method violates the Independence of clones criterion.\n\n==== Crowding ====\nCopeland's method is vulnerable against crowding, that is the outcome of the election is changed by adding (non-winning) clones of a non-winning candidate. Assume five candidates A, B, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub> and C and 4 voters with the following preferences:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # of voters !! Preferences\n|-\n| 1           || A > B<sub>3</sub> > B > B<sub>2</sub> > C\n|-\n| 1           || B<sub>3</sub> > B > B<sub>2</sub> > C > A\n|-\n| 2           || C > A > B<sub>2</sub> > B > B<sub>3</sub>\n|}\nNote, that B, B<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>3</sub> form a clone set.\n\n===== Clones not nominated =====\nIf only one of the clones would compete, preferences would be as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # of voters !!

Thus, '''C''' is elected Copeland winner.\n\n===== Clones nominated =====\nAssume, all three clones would compete.

Thus, '''A''' is elected Copeland winner.\n\n===== Conclusion =====\nA benefits from the clones of the candidate he defeats, while C cannot benefit from the clones because C ties with all of them. Thus, by adding two clones of the non-winning candidate B, the winner has changed. Thus, Copeland's method is vulnerable against crowding and fails the independence of clones criterion.\n\n==== Teaming ====\nCopeland's method is also vulnerable against teaming, that is adding clones raises the winning chances of the set of clones. Again, assume five candidates A, B, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub> and C and 2 voters with the following preferences:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # of voters !! Preferences\n|-\n| 1           || A > C > B > B<sub>3</sub> > B<sub>2</sub>\n|-\n| 1           || B > B<sub>2</sub> > B<sub>3</sub> > A > C\n|}\nNote, that B, B<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>3</sub> form a clone set.\n\n===== Clones not nominated =====\nAssume that only one of the clones would compete.

Thus, '''B''' is elected Copeland winner.\n\n===== Conclusion =====\nB benefits from adding inferior clones, while A cannot benefit from the clones because he ties with all of them. So, by adding two clones of B, B changed from loser to winner. Thus, Copeland's method is vulnerable against Teaming and fails the Independence of clones criterion.\n\n=== Plurality voting ===\n{{Main|Plurality voting system}}\n\nSuppose there are two candidates, A and B, and 55% of the voters prefer A over B. A would win the election, 55% to 45%. But suppose the supporters of B also nominate an alternative similar to A, named A<sub>2</sub>. Assume a significant number of the voters who prefer A over B also prefer A<sub>2</sub> over A. When they vote for A<sub>2</sub>, this reduces A's total below 45%, causing B to win.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n| A 55%\n| A 30%\n|- \n| A<sub>2</sub> not present\n| A<sub>2</sub> 25%\n|-\n| B 45%\n| B 45%\n|}\n\n=== Range voting ===\n{{Main|Range voting}}\n\nRange voting satisfies the independence of clones criterion.\n\n==== Voters changing their opinion ====\nHowever, like in every voting system, if voters change their opinions about candidates if similar candidates are added, adding clone candidates can change the outcome of an election. This can be seen by some premises and a simple example:\n\nIn range voting, to raise the influence of the ballot, the voter can give the maximum possible score to their most preferred alternative and the minimum possible score to their least preferred alternative.<ref>http://www.rangevoting.org/RVstrat3.html</ref> In fact, giving the maximum possible score to all candidates that are over some threshold and giving the minimum possible score to the other candidates, will maximize the influence of a ballot on the outcome.<ref>http://scorevoting.net/RVstrat7.html</ref> However, for this example it is necessary that the voter uses the first simple rule, but not the second.\n\nBegin by supposing there are 3 alternatives: A, B and B<sub>2</sub>, where B<sub>2</sub> is similar to B but considered inferior by the supporters of A and B. The voters supporting A would have the order of preference \"A>B>B<sub>2</sub>\" so that they give A the maximum possible score, they give B<sub>2</sub> the minimum possible score, and they give B a score that's somewhere in between (greater than the minimum). The supporters of B would have the order of preference \"B>B<sub>2</sub>>A\", so they give B the maximum possible score, A the minimum score and B<sub>2</sub> a score somewhere in between. Assume B narrowly wins the election.\n\nNow suppose B<sub>2</sub> isn't nominated. The voters supporting A who would have given B a score somewhere in between would now give B the minimum score while the supporters of B will still give B the maximum score, changing the winner to A. This violates the criterion.\nNote, that if the voters that support B would prefer B<sub>2</sub> to B, this result would not hold, since removing B<sub>2</sub> would raise the score B receives from his supporters in an analogous way as the score he receives from the supporters of A would decrease.\n\nThe conclusion that can be drawn is that considering all voters voting in a certain special way, range voting creates an incentive to nominate additional alternatives that are similar to one you prefer, but considered clearly inferior by his voters and by the voters of his opponent, since this can be expected to cause the voters supporting the opponent to raise their score of the one you prefer (because it looks better by comparison to the inferior ones), but not his own voters to lower their score.\n\n==== Strictly-interpreted definition of ranked-clones ====\nThe definition of a set of clones for the Independence of clones criterion has been created for ranked voting systems. For scored voting systems, this definition is not accurate. This can be seen by the following example:\n\nAssume three candidates A, B and C with the following scores:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!             !! colspan=3|Scores\n|-\n! # of voters !! A  !! B  !! C\n|-\n| 1           || 10 || 8  || 0\n|-\n| 1           || 0  || 8  || 9\n|}\n\nThe set {A, B} is a set of clones, since there is no voter that gives C a score between the scores of A and B.\n\nAlso, the set {B, C} is a set of clones, since there is no voter that gives A a score between the scores of B and C.\n\nThe set {A, C} is not a set of clones, since both voters gives B a score between the scores of A and C.\n\nSo, A is a clone of B, and B is a clone of C, but A is not a clone C.\n\nNow, if the election is held between A and C (without B), then A will win. If B is added, B will win. B is a clone of A, the winner in the first place. But B is also a clone of C, the loser in the first place. Thus, using the definition in its strict form, B must not win, because the inferior C cannot win.\n\nHowever, even in this strict version of the definition of clones, adding a non-winning clone does not change the chances of all candidates to win.\n\nNote, that Condorcet methods would lead to a tie between all candidates in this example. Whether Independence of clones is satisfied depends on the tie-breaker. Using the Schulze method or ranked pairs, simply choosing one of the tied candidates at random would raise the chance of the clone-set {A, B} from 50% if B don't compete to 67%, if B compete and thus, violate the criterion.\n\nHow the definition of clones have to be adapted for scored voting methods is controversial.\n\n=== Kemeny\u2013Young method ===\n{{Main|Kemeny\u2013Young method}}\n\nThis example shows that the Kemeny\u2013Young method violates the Independence of clones criterion. Assume five candidates A, B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub> and C and 13 voters with the following preferences:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # of voters !!

Thus, the minimax method is vulnerable against spoilers and fails the independence of clones criterion.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Strategic nomination]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{voting systems}}\n\n[[Category:Electoral system criteria]]\n", "text_old": "In [[voting system]]s theory, the '''independence of clones criterion''' measures an election method's robustness to [[strategic nomination]]. [[Nicolaus Tideman]] was the first to formulate this criterion, which states that the winner must not change due to the addition of a non-winning candidate who is similar to a candidate already present.<ref>T. Nicolaus Tideman, \"Independence of clones as a criterion for voting rules\", ''Social Choice and Welfare'' Vol. 4, No. 3 (1987), pp. 185&ndash;206.</ref>\n\nTo be more precise, a subset of the candidates, called a set of clones, exists if no voter ranks any candidate outside the set between (or equal to) any candidates that are in the set. If a set of clones contains at least two candidates, the criterion requires that deleting one of the clones must not increase or decrease the winning chance of any candidate not in the set of clones.\n\nIn some systems (such as the [[plurality vote]]), the addition of a similar candidate divides support between similar candidates, which can cause them both to lose. In some other systems (such as the [[Borda count]]), the addition of a similar alternative increases the apparent support for one of the similar candidates, which can cause it to win. In yet other systems (such as [[ranked pairs]]), the introduction of similar alternatives does not affect the chances of the dissimilar candidates, as required by the criterion. There are further systems where the effect of the additional similar alternatives depends on the distribution of other votes.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n== Clone negative and clone positive ==\nElection methods that fail independence of clones can be clone negative (the addition of a similar candidate decreases another candidate's chance of winning) or clone positive (the addition of a similar candidate increases another candidate's chance of winning). \n\nA method can also fail the independence of clones method in a way that's neither clone positive nor negative. This happens if the method changes its decision about the winner when a non-winning candidate is cloned, but the new winner is not the candidate that was cloned. The effect is called crowding.\n\nThe [[Borda count]] is an example of a clone positive method. [[Plurality voting]] is an example of a clone negative method because of [[vote-splitting]]. [[Copeland's method]] is an example of a method that exhibits crowding.\n\n== Compliant methods ==\n\n[[Instant-runoff voting]] and some election methods that comply with the [[Condorcet criterion]] such as [[ranked pairs]] and the [[Schulze method]]<ref>M. Schulze, \"A New Monotonic and Clone-Independent Single-Winner Election Method\", ''Voting Matters'' 17 (2003), pp 9&ndash;19.</ref> also meet independence of clones.\n\nThe interpretation of the term \"set of clones\" for scored voting systems is controversial. If clones are candidates that are considered nearly identical by the voters, [[range voting]] and [[majority judgment]] satisfy the criterion. If clones also include candidates that are still similar but clearly superior to an existing candidate, that superior clone can win in range voting, even if no inferior clone of that candidate would have won. However, since range voting and majority judgment satisfy the [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]] criterion, the addition of clones never helps or harms candidates who are already present.\n\nSome of the other methods that fail the criterion are the [[Borda count]], [[Minimax Condorcet|minimax]], the [[Kemeny\u2013Young method]], [[Copeland's method]], [[Bucklin voting]], the [[plurality voting system|plurality vote]], and the [[two-round system]]. Variants of [[Instant-runoff voting]] that eliminate multiple candidates per round (e.g. the [[contingent vote]]) or forbid the voters from ranking all the candidates (e.g. the [[supplementary vote]]) also fail the criterion.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Borda count ===\n{{Main|Borda count}}\n\nConsider an election in which there are two candidates, A and B. Suppose the voters have the following preferences:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n| 66%: A>B\n| 34%: B>A\n|}\n\nCandidate A would receive 66% Borda points (66%\u00d71 + 34%\u00d70) and B would receive 34% (66%\u00d70 + 34%\u00d71). Thus candidate A would win by a 66% landslide.\n\nNow suppose supporters of B nominate an additional candidate, B<sub>2</sub>, that is very similar to B but considered inferior by all voters. For the 66% who prefer A, B continues to be their second choice. For the 34% who prefer B, A continues to be their least preferred candidate. Now the voters' preferences are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n| 66%: A>B>B<sub>2</sub>\n| 34%: B>B<sub>2</sub>>A\n|}\n\nCandidate A now has 132% Borda points (66%\u00d72 + 34%\u00d70). B has 134% (66%\u00d71 + 34%\u00d72). B<sub>2</sub> has 34% (66%\u00d70 + 34%\u00d71). The nomination of B<sub>2</sub> changes the winner from A to B, overturning the landslide, even though the additional information about voters' preferences is redundant due to the similarity of B<sub>2</sub> to B.\n\nSimilar examples can be constructed to show that ''given the Borda count, any arbitrarily large landslide can be overturned by adding enough candidates'' (assuming at least one voter prefers the landslide loser). For example, to overturn a 90% landslide preference for A over B, add 9 alternatives similar/inferior to B. Then A's score would be 900% (90%\u00d710 + 10%\u00d70) and B's score would be 910% (90%\u00d79 + 10%\u00d710).\n\nNo knowledge of the voters' preferences is needed to exploit this strategy. Factions could simply nominate as many alternatives as possible that are similar to their preferred alternative.\n\nIn typical elections, game theory suggests this manipulability of Borda can be expected to be a serious problem, particularly when a significant number of voters can be expected to vote their sincere order of preference (as in public elections, where many voters are not strategically sophisticated; cite Michael R. Alvarez of Caltech). Small minorities typically have the power to nominate additional candidates, and typically it is easy to find additional candidates that are similar.\n\nIn the context of people running for office, people can take similar positions on the issues, and in the context of voting on proposals, it is easy to construct similar proposals. Game theory suggests that all factions would seek to nominate as many similar candidates as possible since the winner would depend on the number of similar candidates, regardless of the voters' preferences.\n\n=== Copeland ===\n{{Main|Copeland's method}}\nThis examples show that Copeland's method violates the Independence of clones criterion.\n\n==== Crowding ====\nCopeland's method is vulnerable against crowding, that is the outcome of the election is changed by adding (non-winning) clones of a non-winning candidate.

Thus, '''B''' is elected Copeland winner.\n\n===== Conclusion =====\nB benefits from adding inferior clones, while A cannot benefit from the clones because he ties with all of them. So, by adding two clones of B, B changed from loser to winner. Thus, Copeland's method is vulnerable against Teaming and fails the Independence of clones criterion.\n\n=== Plurality voting ===\n{{Main|Plurality voting system}}\n\nSuppose there are two candidates, A and B, and 55% of the voters prefer A over B. A would win the election, 55% to 45%. But suppose the supporters of B also nominate an alternative similar to A, named A<sub>2</sub>. Assume a significant number of the voters who prefer A over B also prefer A<sub>2</sub> over A. When they vote for A<sub>2</sub>, this reduces A's total below 45%, causing B to win.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n| A 55%\n| A 30%\n|- \n| A<sub>2</sub> not present\n| A<sub>2</sub> 25%\n|-\n| B 45%\n| B 45%\n|}\n\n=== Range voting ===\n{{Main|Range voting}}\n\nRange voting satisfies the independence of clones criterion.\n\n==== Voters changing their opinion ====\nHowever, like in every voting system, if voters change their opinions about candidates if similar candidates are added, adding clone candidates can change the outcome of an election. This can be seen by some premises and a simple example:\n\nIn range voting, to raise the influence of the ballot, the voter can give the maximum possible score to their most preferred alternative and the minimum possible score to their least preferred alternative.<ref>http://www.rangevoting.org/RVstrat3.html</ref> In fact, giving the maximum possible score to all candidates that are over some threshold and giving the minimum possible score to the other candidates, will maximize the influence of a ballot on the outcome.<ref>http://scorevoting.net/RVstrat7.html</ref> However, for this example it is necessary that the voter uses the first simple rule, but not the second.\n\nBegin by supposing there are 3 alternatives: A, B and B<sub>2</sub>, where B<sub>2</sub> is similar to B but considered inferior by the supporters of A and B. The voters supporting A would have the order of preference \"A>B>B<sub>2</sub>\" so that they give A the maximum possible score, they give B<sub>2</sub> the minimum possible score, and they give B a score that's somewhere in between (greater than the minimum). The supporters of B would have the order of preference \"B>B<sub>2</sub>>A\", so they give B the maximum possible score, A the minimum score and B<sub>2</sub> a score somewhere in between. Assume B narrowly wins the election.\n\nNow suppose B<sub>2</sub> isn't nominated. The voters supporting A who would have given B a score somewhere in between would now give B the minimum score while the supporters of B will still give B the maximum score, changing the winner to A. This violates the criterion.\nNote, that if the voters that support B would prefer B<sub>2</sub> to B, this result would not hold, since removing B<sub>2</sub> would raise the score B receives from his supporters in an analogous way as the score he receives from the supporters of A would decrease.\n\nThe conclusion that can be drawn is that considering all voters voting in a certain special way, range voting creates an incentive to nominate additional alternatives that are similar to one you prefer, but considered clearly inferior by his voters and by the voters of his opponent, since this can be expected to cause the voters supporting the opponent to raise their score of the one you prefer (because it looks better by comparison to the inferior ones), but not his own voters to lower their score.\n\n==== Strictly-interpreted definition of ranked-clones ====\nThe definition of a set of clones for the Independence of clones criterion has been created for ranked voting systems. For scored voting systems, this definition is not accurate. This can be seen by the following example:\n\nAssume three candidates A, B and C with the following scores:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!             !! colspan=3|Scores\n|-\n! # of voters !! A  !! B  !! C\n|-\n| 1           || 10 || 8  || 0\n|-\n| 1           || 0  || 8  || 9\n|}\n\nThe set {A, B} is a set of clones, since there is no voter that gives C a score between the scores of A and B.\n\nAlso, the set {B, C} is a set of clones, since there is no voter that gives A a score between the scores of B and C.\n\nThe set {A, C} is not a set of clones, since both voters gives B a score between the scores of A and C.\n\nSo, A is a clone of B, and B is a clone of C, but A is not a clone C.\n\nNow, if the election is held between A and C (without B), then A will win. If B is added, B will win. B is a clone of A, the winner in the first place. But B is also a clone of C, the loser in the first place. Thus, using the definition in its strict form, B must not win, because the inferior C cannot win.\n\nHowever, even in this strict version of the definition of clones, adding a non-winning clone does not change the chances of all candidates to win.\n\nNote, that Condorcet methods would lead to a tie between all candidates in this example. Whether Independence of clones is satisfied depends on the tie-breaker. Using the Schulze method or ranked pairs, simply choosing one of the tied candidates at random would raise the chance of the clone-set {A, B} from 50% if B don't compete to 67%, if B compete and thus, violate the criterion.\n\nHow the definition of clones have to be adapted for scored voting methods is controversial.\n\n=== Kemeny\u2013Young method ===\n{{Main|Kemeny\u2013Young method}}\n\nThis example shows that the Kemeny\u2013Young method violates the Independence of clones criterion. Assume five candidates A, B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub> and C and 13 voters with the following preferences:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # of voters !!

Thus, '''B<sub>1</sub>''' wins ahead of C and A.\n\n==== Clones nominated ====\nAssume all three clones compete. The preferences would be:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # of voters !!

More over, the optimal ranking within the clones is unambiguous: B<sub>1</sub> > B<sub>2</sub> > B<sub>3</sub>. In fact, for computing the results, the three clones can be seen as one united candidate B, whose wins and defeats are three times as strong as of every single clone. The ranking scores of all possible rankings with respect to that are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Preferences !! 1. vs 2. !! 1. vs 3. !! 2. vs 3. !!

Thus, '''A''' wins ahead of the clones B<sub>i</sub> and C.\n\n==== Conclusion ====\nA benefits from the two clones of B<sub>1</sub> because A's win is multiplied by three. So, by adding two clones of B, B changed from winner to loser. Thus, the Kemeny\u2013Young method is vulnerable against spoilers and fails the independence of clones criterion.\n\n=== Minimax ===\n{{Main|Minimax Condorcet}}\nThis example shows that the minimax method violates the Independence of clones criterion. Assume four candidates A, B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>3</sub> and 9 voters with the following preferences:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # of voters !!

Eglington was also a [[dual Irish international footballers|dual internationalist]] and played for both Ireland teams&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Ireland national football team (FAI)|FAI XI]] and the [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|IFA XI]].\n\nEglington's playing career followed a similar path to that of [[Peter Farrell (Irish footballer)|Peter Farrell]]. As well as teaming up at international level, they also played together at three clubs. Eglington was best known as a creator of chances, for his acceleration down the wing and for his ability to deliver a precise pass at speed. He also possessed a powerful shot. He remains one of [[Everton F.C.|Everton's]] all-time [[Everton F.C. records|top goalscorers]] and has played more games in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] than any other Everton player.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Shamrock Rovers===\nBefore joining Rovers, Eglington played as a junior with both Munster Victoria and [[Distillery F.C.

In September 1946 he made his League debut for the club in a 3\u20132 home win against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. In eleven seasons at Everton he played 394 league games and scored 76 goals. He also played a further 34 games and scored a further 12 goals in the [[FA Cup]].

On 27 November 1946, he made his debut for the IFA XI in a 0\u20130 draw with [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. Together with [[Johnny Carey]], [[Con Martin]], [[Bill Gorman]], [[Peter Farrell (Irish footballer)|Peter Farrell]], [[Alex Stevenson]] and [[Davy Walsh]], he was one of seven players born in the [[Irish Free State]] to play for the IFA XI that day. The draw helped the team finish as runners-up in the [[1947 British Home Championship]]. Eglington also helped the IFA XI gain some other respectable results, including a 2\u20130 win against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] on 4 October 1947, and a 2\u20132 draw with [[England national football team|England]] at [[Goodison Park]] on 5 November 1947.<ref name=\"nifg\">{{cite web|url=http://nifootball.blogspot.co.uk/2006/11/tommy-eglington.html|title=Tommy Eglington|publisher=Northern Ireland's Footballing Greats|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=13 November 2006}}</ref>\n\n==After Football==\nEglington also ran a butcher's shop outside St. Gabriel's Church in Clontarf, Dublin for many years after his retirement.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://nifootball.blogspot.com/2006/11/tommy-eglington.html  Northern Ireland's Footballing Greats]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211513/http://www.eleven-a-side.com/offthefield/irish_soccer_detail.asp?newsid=9923  Obituary at Irish Fan Site]\n*[http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/eglington-passes-away.html Obituary at www.evertonfc.com]\n*[http://www.blue-all-over.co.uk/index.php?page=legends&player=eglington  Everton Fan Site]\n*[http://www.clontarfonline.com/ambrose_eglington.htm  Eglington at www.clontarfonline.com]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071220184933/http://www.footballpoets.org/poem.asp?Id=5645  Football Poets]\n*[http://fr.uefa.com/uefa/news/Kind=4/newsId=145849.html  UEFA Obituary]\n\n{{Gwladys Street's Hall of Fame}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Eglington, Tommy}}\n[[Category:1923 births]]\n[[Category:2004 deaths]]\n[[Category:Association football wingers]]\n[[Category:Association footballers from County Dublin]]\n[[Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers]]\n[[Category:Ireland (FAI) international footballers]]\n[[Category:Dual Irish international footballers]]\n[[Category:Pre-1950 IFA international footballers]]\n[[Category:League of Ireland players]]\n[[Category:Shamrock Rovers F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Everton F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Tranmere Rovers F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Cork Hibernians F.C. players]]\n[[Category:League of Ireland XI players]]\n[[Category:Republic of Ireland international footballers]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=March 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2019}}\n{{Infobox football biography\n| name= Tommy Eglington\n| image = Tommy Eglington.jpg\n| image_size =\n| alt =\n| caption = Eglington c. 1959\n| fullname = Thomas Joseph Eglington\n| birth_date  = {{birth date|df=y|1923|1|15}}\n| birth_place = [[Donnycarney]], [[County Dublin]], Republic of Ireland\n| death_date  = {{death date and age|df=y|2004|2|18|1923|1|15}}\n| death_place = [[Raheny]], [[County Dublin]], Republic of Ireland\n| position = [[Outside-left]]\n| youthyears1 = 19xx | youthyears2 =1942\n| youthclubs1 = Munster Victoria | youthclubs2 =[[Distillery F.C.
