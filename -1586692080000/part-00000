Although the Montenegrins were not recognized by the Albanian authorities as a distinct national minority, the Association claimed to have over 1,000 members representing the interests of a 2,500-strong minority residing mainly in the around Shkod\u00ebr. The AM challenged the official statistics issued by Tirana in the early 1990s, in which the number of Montenegrins and Serbs was placed at only 100. Some Albanian officials contended that several hundred Slavs had left the country since the onset of the democratic changes, including both Serbs and Montenegrins, that the numbers were accurate. Members of the Association advocated promoting the culture and customs of Montenegrins and urged the recognition of Montenegrin and Serbian minorities in Albania and the return of original Slavic names to members of these minorities. The AM planned to reopen elementary schools in the mother language and to form a Montenegrin-Serbian club.</ref> In 1999 the Helsinki Committee for Human rights in Albania conducted surveys of the Shkod\u00ebr region and estimated that there were some 1800-2000 Serbian-speakers in the area.<ref name=\"Steinke19\">{{harvnb|Steinke|Ylli|2013|p=19}} \"Ohne genaue Quellenangabe bringt \u0160\u0106EPANOVI\u0106 (1991: 716-717) folgende ,,aktuelle\" Zahlen: Omara 79 Haushalte, davon 68 crnogorski, 11 albanische; Grilj 85 Haushalte, davon 76 crnogorski, 9 albanische; Stari (Mali) Bori\u0107 75 Haushalte, davon 67 crnogorski, 8 albanische, Veliki (Mladi) Bori\u0107 112 Familien, davon 86 podgori\u010danski, 6 crnogorski und 20 albanische Familien.

Although the Montenegrins were not recognized by the Albanian authorities as a distinct national minority, the Association claimed to have over 1,000 members representing the interests of a 2,500-strong minority residing mainly in the around Shkod\u00ebr. The AM challenged the official statistics issued by Tirana in the early 1990s, in which the number of Montenegrins and Serbs was placed at only 100. Some Albanian officials contended that several hundred Slavs had left the country since the onset of the democratic changes, including both Serbs and Montenegrins, that the numbers were accurate. Members of the Association advocated promoting the culture and customs of Montenegrins and urged the recognition of Montenegrin and Serbian minorities in Albania and the return of original Slavic names to members of these minorities. The AM planned to reopen elementary schools in the mother language and to form a Montenegrin-Serbian club.</ref> In 1999 the Helsinki Committee for Human rights in Albania conducted surveys of the Shkod\u00ebr region and estimated that there were some 1800-2000 Serbian-speakers in the area.<ref name=\"Steinke19\">{{harvnb|Steinke|Ylli|2013|p=19}} \"Ohne genaue Quellenangabe bringt \u0160\u0106EPANOVI\u0106 (1991: 716-717) folgende ,,aktuelle\" Zahlen: Omara 79 Haushalte, davon 68 crnogorski, 11 albanische; Grilj 85 Haushalte, davon 76 crnogorski, 9 albanische; Stari (Mali) Bori\u0107 75 Haushalte, davon 67 crnogorski, 8 albanische, Veliki (Mladi) Bori\u0107 112 Familien, davon 86 podgori\u010danski, 6 crnogorski und 20 albanische Familien.
