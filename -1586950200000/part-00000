The group achieved several UK [[record chart|chart]] [[hit record|hits]] between 1977 and 1981, including top-ten hits \"Wanted\", \"Love of My Life\" and \"The Chosen Few\".\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early days===\nThe group began in the late 1960s as \"The Dooley Family\", composed of brothers Jim (vocals), John ([[guitarist|guitar]] and vocals) and Frank (guitar and vocals) with sisters Marie, Anne and Kathy (all vocals). Based in [[Ilford]], Essex, the group had work that was mostly limited to theatres and hotels because the three youngest members were still at school and therefore not allowed to perform in [[public house|pub]]s. They appeared in variety shows alongside popular entertainers such as [[Bob Monkhouse]], [[Frankie Howerd]], [[Norman Collier]] and [[Anne Shelton (singer)|Anne Shelton]].\n\nIn 1972, they were joined by friend Bob Walsh (bass guitar) who was born in [[Manchester]]. His brother Vince Miller was a club [[Master of Ceremonies|compere]] and ran a [[booking agency]] with colleague Brian Mills. The pair took the group to Manchester for some trials in north of England [[Working men's club|clubs]]. They went down well with audiences and were told that they could achieve greater success if they were to base themselves permanently in [[Northern England|the north of England]]. As a result, they moved to [[Worsley]] in Lancashire during 1973 without Marie, who was by now pregnant with her first child, and did not feel she could commit to the band.\n\nFollowing their move north, most of the gigs were booked by Jim and Bob (who spent their evenings visiting working men's clubs, selling the act). At that time, major [[Talent agent|agents]] were not interested in this kind of family group, and it took a lot of work on the band's part to convince them otherwise. In the meantime they continued polishing their act and playing clubs. Eventually, they signed a management deal with Ken Wild; he introduced them to drummer Alan Bogan, who joined the group.\n\nThey gained their first recording contract with John Schroeder who signed them to his Alaska Records company in 1974, and released two [[Single (music)|singles]]. The first of these was \"Hands Across the Sea\" (although its release was delayed by its entry into the [[Eurovision: Your Country Needs You|Song for Europe]] contest, to be sung by [[Olivia Newton-John]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/national_finals_70s_80s/UK1974.html |title=UK NATIONAL FINAL 1974 |date=26 October 2009 |accessdate=25 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026233638/http://geocities.com/national_finals_70s_80s/UK1974.html |archivedate=26 October 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Early success===\nIn 1975 they were invited to tour in Eastern Europe.

comprising most of [[Western New Guinea]]. It is bordered by the state of [[Papua New Guinea]] to the east, the province of [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] to the west, the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the north, and the [[Arafura Sea]] to the south. According to the 2010 census by [[Statistics Indonesia]], Papua had a population of 2,833,381, the majority of whom are [[Christianity|Christians]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bps.go.id/statictable/2009/02/20/1267/penduduk-indonesia-menurut-provinsi-1971-1980-1990-1995-2000-dan-2010.html|title=Badan Pusat Statistik|website=www.bps.go.id|accessdate=5 November 2018}}</ref> The 2015 Intermediate Census revealed a population of 3,143,088, while the latest official estimate (as at mid 2019) is 3,347,100.<ref>Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2019.</ref> The province is divided into twenty-eight [[Regency (Indonesia)|regencies]] and one city. Its capital and largest city is [[Jayapura]].\n\nThe province was formerly called [[Western New Guinea#Name|Irian Jaya]] and comprised the entire Western New Guinea until the inauguration of the province of West Papua (then West Irian Jaya) in 2001. In 2002, Papua adopted its current name and was granted a special [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous]] status by the [[Law of Indonesia|Indonesian legislation]]. [[Puncak Jaya]] is the province's highest mountain as well as the highest point of Indonesia.\n\n== History ==\nIndonesia [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed its independence]] in 1945 and claimed all of the territory of the former [[Dutch East Indies]], including [[Western New Guinea]]. However, the region was retained by the Netherlands until the mid-1960s, which caused Indonesia to repeatedly launch military operations there. It was agreed through the [[New York Agreement]] in 1962 that the administration of Western New Guinea would be temporarily transferred from the Netherlands to Indonesia and that by 1969 the [[United Nations]] should oversee a referendum of the [[Papuan people]], in which they would be given two options: to remain part of Indonesia or to become an independent nation. This vote was referred to as the [[Act of Free Choice]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Monbiot |first1=George |title=Slavemasters |url=https://www.monbiot.com/2018/11/23/slavemasters/ |accessdate=2018-11-24 |work=The Guardian |date=2018-11-23 |format=Opinion}}</ref> The referendum was recognised by the international community and the region became the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya.

The formality of installing a local government for Jaraka in Irian Jaya Barat (West) took place in February 2003 and a governor was appointed in November; a government for Irian Jaya Tengah (Central Irian Jaya) was delayed from August 2003 due to violent local protests. The creation of this separate Central Irian Jaya Province was blocked by Indonesian courts, who declared it to be unconstitutional and in contravention of the Papua's special autonomy agreement. The previous division into two provinces was allowed to stand as an established fact.<ref>King, 2004, p.&nbsp;91</ref>\n\n== Government ==\n[[File:Nius Kogoya.jpg|left|thumb|Nius Kogoya, Provincial Representative for Tolikara]]\nThe province of Papua is governed by a directly elected governor (currently [[Lukas Enembe]]) and a regional legislature, [[People's Representative Council]] of province of Papua (''Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Papua'').<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blades |first1=Johnny |title=Governor of Indonesia's Papua seeks connection with PNG |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/366810/governor-of-indonesia-s-papua-seeks-connection-with-png |website=Radio New Zealand |accessdate=24 January 2019 |language=en-nz |date=19 September 2018}}</ref> A government organisation that only exists in Papua is the Papuan People's Council (Majelis Rakyat Papua) Papuan People's Council), which was formed by the [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian Government]] in 2005 as a coalition of Papuan tribal chiefs, tasked with arbitration and speaking on behalf of Papuan tribal customs.\n\nThe province of Papua is one of three provinces to have obtained special autonomy status, the others being [[Aceh]] and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]]. According to Law 21/2001 on Special Autonomy Status ''(UU Nomor 21 Tahun 2001 tentang Otonomi khusus Papua),'' the provincial government of Papua is provided with authority within all sectors of administration, except for the five strategic areas of foreign affairs, security and defense,  monetary and fiscal affairs, religion and justice. The provincial government is authorised to issue local regulations to further stipulate the implementation of the special autonomy, including regulating the authority of districts and municipalities within the province. Due to its special autonomy status, Papua province is provided with significant amount of special autonomy funds, which can be used to benefit its indigenous peoples. But the province has low fiscal capacity and it is highly dependent on unconditional transfers and the above-mentioned special autonomy fund, which accounted for about 55% of total revenues in 2008.\n\nAfter obtaining its special autonomy status, in order to allow the local population access to timber production benefits, the Papuan provincial government issued a number of decrees, enabling:\n* a Timber Logging Permit for Customary Communities, which enabled local people to carry out timber extraction in small concessions (250 to 1,000 hectares) for one year through a community-based or participatory community cooperative;\n* a Permit to Manage Customary Forests, which was a timber extraction permit for larger concessions (up to 2,000 hectares) for a maximum of 20 years;\n* logging companies had to pay compensations to local communities in addition to all other fees and taxes collected by the national government.\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nAs of 2010 (following the separation of West Papua Province in 2003), the residual Papua Province consisted of 28 [[Regencies of Indonesia|regencies]] (''kabupaten'') and one autonomous city (''kota''); these regencies and the city are together subdivided as at 2018 into 560 [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''distriks''), and thence into 5,521 \"villages\" (''kelurahan'' and ''desa''). In Papua, as well as in the province of West Papua, ''kecamatan'' are commonly referred to as ''distrik''.\n\nThe regencies (''kabupaten'') and the city (''kota'') are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and thw 2015 Intermediate Census.<ref>Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2019.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

About 10\u201330% of children continue in middle school. Very few go to high school. \nThe nearest high school is in [[Merauke]] city.\nThey live primarily by hunting, fishing, and gardening short and long term crops in the lowlands. The Yei diet mainly consists of rice, vegetables, fish and roasted [[sago]].\nWith their land at an altitude of less than 100 meters above sea level, the Yei people can best be accessed by vehicle on the road from Merauke or by motorized canoe up the [[Maro River]]. There is no airstrip or airplane access other than float plane which is currently available from Merauke through MAF by about a 15-minute flight to Toray.\nThe Poo and Bupul villages have a clinic but people still use traditional medicines.\nThere is very little infrastructure in the area: no telephones or toilets. At night electricity is run from a generator. There are single side-band radios (SSBs) in Bupul, Tanas, Poo, and Erambu villages, mainly used by the police and military force. Most villages get their drinking water from the Maro River, but some get it from wells or by collecting rain.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[File:Impact of Javanese expansion on Dani tribe in Irian Jaya ABC 1995.webm|thumb|1995 [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] news report on the impact of transmigration and development on the Dani|left]]\n\n{{Historical populations\n|type=\n|footnote= Source: [[Badan Pusat Statistik]] 2010, 2014 Health Ministry Estimate<ref name=\"kemenkesehat\">http://www.depkes.go.id/downloads/Penduduk%20Kab%20Kota%20Umur%20Tunggal%202014.pdf Estimasi Penduduk Menurut Umur Tunggal Dan Jenis Kelamin 2014 Kementerian Kesehatan</ref>\n|1971 |923440\n|1980 |1173875\n|1990 |1648708\n|1995 |1942627\n|2000 |2220934\n|2010 |2833381\n|2015 |3143088\n|2019 |3347100}} \nThe population of Papua province has a fertility rate of 2.9 children per woman {{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The population grew from the 1.94&nbsp;million recorded in the [[Indonesia 2000 census|2000 Indonesia Census]], to 2.83&nbsp;million as recorded by the 2010 Census,<ref name=\"JKTPOS\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/08/23/population-growth-%E2%80%98good-papua%E2%80%99.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824053746/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/08/23/population-growth-%E2%80%98good-papua%E2%80%99.html |archivedate=24 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and is officially estimated to be at about 3,347,100 in mid 2019.<ref>Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2019.</ref> From the early 1990s until the mid 2010s, Papua had the highest population growth rate of all Indonesian provinces at over 3% annually.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} This was partly a result of birth rates, but mainly due to migration from other parts of Indonesia.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} An overwhelming percentage of these migrants came as part of [[transmigrasi|a government-sponsored transmigration program]].{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nThe densest population center, other than the large coastal cities that house Indonesian bureaucratic and commercial apparatus, is located in and around the town of [[Wamena]] in the [[Baliem Valley]] of the Central Highlands.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}{{bar box\n|title=Religion in Papua (2010 census)<ref name=\"BPS\u0320Religion\u03202010\">{{cite web| title = Population by Region and Religion in Indonesia | work = [[Badan Pusat Statistik|BPS]] | year = 2010 | url = http://sp2010.bps.go.id/index.php/site/tabel?tid=321&wid=0}}</ref> \n|titlebar=\n|left1=religion\n|right1=percent\n|float=right\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|Protestantism|Violet|65.48}}\n{{bar percent|Roman Catholicism|Purple|17.67}}\n{{bar percent|Islam|Green|15.88}}\n{{bar percent|Not Asked|Brown|0.82}}\n{{bar percent|Hinduism|Orange|0.09}}\n{{bar percent|Buddhism|Gold|0.05}}\n{{bar percent|Others|Grey|0.006}}\n{{bar percent|Confucianism|Magenta|0.003}}\n{{bar percent|Not Stated|Black|0.001}}\n}}\n\n===Religion===\nAccording to the 2010 census, 83.15% of the Papuans identified themselves as Christian with 65.48% being Protestant and 17.67% being Roman Catholic. 15.88% of the population was Muslim and less than 1% were Buddhist or Hindu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sp2010.bps.go.id/index.php/site/tabel?tid=321&wid=9400000000|title=Peringatan|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2016}}</ref> There is also substantial practice of [[animism]], the traditional religion for many Papuans, with many blending animistic beliefs with other religions such as Christianity.\n\n== Economy ==\nIn 2011, Papuan caretaker governor Syamsul Arief Rivai claimed Papua's forests cover 42 million hectares with an estimated worth of Rp.700&nbsp;trillion ($78&nbsp;billion) and that if the forests were managed properly and sustainably, they could produce over 500&nbsp;million cubic meters of logs per annum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/08/24/forests-papua-are-valued-78-billion.html |title=Forests in Papua are valued at $78&nbsp;billion |date=24 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Grasberg Mine]], the world's largest gold mine and third largest copper mine,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/27/international/asia/27gold.html?pagewanted=2 Jane Perlez and Raymond Bonner (2005): Below a Mountain of Wealth, a River of Waste.

Its capital and largest city is [[Jayapura]].\n\nThe province was formerly called [[Western New Guinea#Name|Irian Jaya]] and comprised the entire Western New Guinea until the inauguration of the province of West Papua (then West Irian Jaya) in 2001. In 2002, Papua adopted its current name and was granted a special [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous]] status by the [[Law of Indonesia|Indonesian legislation]]. [[Puncak Jaya]] is the province's highest mountain as well as the highest point of Indonesia.\n\n== History ==\nIndonesia [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed its independence]] in 1945 and claimed all of the territory of the former [[Dutch East Indies]], including [[Western New Guinea]]. However, the region was retained by the Netherlands until the mid-1960s, which caused Indonesia to repeatedly launch military operations there. It was agreed through the [[New York Agreement]] in 1962 that the administration of Western New Guinea would be temporarily transferred from the Netherlands to Indonesia and that by 1969 the [[United Nations]] should oversee a referendum of the [[Papuan people]], in which they would be given two options: to remain part of Indonesia or to become an independent nation. This vote was referred to as the [[Act of Free Choice]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Monbiot |first1=George |title=Slavemasters |url=https://www.monbiot.com/2018/11/23/slavemasters/ |accessdate=2018-11-24 |work=The Guardian |date=2018-11-23 |format=Opinion}}</ref> The referendum was recognised by the international community and the region became the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya.

The formality of installing a local government for Jaraka in Irian Jaya Barat (West) took place in February 2003 and a governor was appointed in November; a government for Irian Jaya Tengah (Central Irian Jaya) was delayed from August 2003 due to violent local protests. The creation of this separate Central Irian Jaya Province was blocked by Indonesian courts, who declared it to be unconstitutional and in contravention of the Papua's special autonomy agreement. The previous division into two provinces was allowed to stand as an established fact.<ref>King, 2004, p.&nbsp;91</ref>\n\n== Government ==\n[[File:Nius Kogoya.jpg|left|thumb|Nius Kogoya, Provincial Representative for Tolikara]]\nThe province of Papua is governed by a directly elected governor (currently [[Lukas Enembe]]) and a regional legislature, [[People's Representative Council]] of province of Papua (''Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Papua'').<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blades |first1=Johnny |title=Governor of Indonesia's Papua seeks connection with PNG |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/366810/governor-of-indonesia-s-papua-seeks-connection-with-png |website=Radio New Zealand |accessdate=24 January 2019 |language=en-nz |date=19 September 2018}}</ref> A government organisation that only exists in Papua is the Papuan People's Council (Majelis Rakyat Papua) Papuan People's Council), which was formed by the [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian Government]] in 2005 as a coalition of Papuan tribal chiefs, tasked with arbitration and speaking on behalf of Papuan tribal customs.\n\nThe province of Papua is one of three provinces to have obtained special autonomy status, the others being [[Aceh]] and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]]. According to Law 21/2001 on Special Autonomy Status ''(UU Nomor 21 Tahun 2001 tentang Otonomi khusus Papua),'' the provincial government of Papua is provided with authority within all sectors of administration, except for the five strategic areas of foreign affairs, security and defense,  monetary and fiscal affairs, religion and justice. The provincial government is authorised to issue local regulations to further stipulate the implementation of the special autonomy, including regulating the authority of districts and municipalities within the province. Due to its special autonomy status, Papua province is provided with significant amount of special autonomy funds, which can be used to benefit its indigenous peoples. But the province has low fiscal capacity and it is highly dependent on unconditional transfers and the above-mentioned special autonomy fund, which accounted for about 55% of total revenues in 2008.\n\nAfter obtaining its special autonomy status, in order to allow the local population access to timber production benefits, the Papuan provincial government issued a number of decrees, enabling:\n* a Timber Logging Permit for Customary Communities, which enabled local people to carry out timber extraction in small concessions (250 to 1,000 hectares) for one year through a community-based or participatory community cooperative;\n* a Permit to Manage Customary Forests, which was a timber extraction permit for larger concessions (up to 2,000 hectares) for a maximum of 20 years;\n* logging companies had to pay compensations to local communities in addition to all other fees and taxes collected by the national government.\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nAs of 2010 (following the separation of West Papua Province in 2003), the residual Papua Province consisted of 28 [[Regencies of Indonesia|regencies]] (''kabupaten'') and one autonomous city (''kota''); these regencies and the city are together subdivided as at 2018 into 560 [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''distriks''), and thence into 5,521 \"villages\" (''kelurahan'' and ''desa''). In Papua, as well as in the province of West Papua, ''kecamatan'' are commonly referred to as ''distrik''.\n\nThe regencies (''kabupaten'') and the city (''kota'') are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and thw 2015 Intermediate Census.<ref>Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2019.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Yei diet mainly consists of rice, vegetables, fish and roasted [[sago]].\nWith their land at an altitude of less than 100 meters above sea level, the Yei people can best be accessed by vehicle on the road from Merauke or by motorized canoe up the [[Maro River]]. There is no airstrip or airplane access other than float plane which is currently available from Merauke through MAF by about a 15-minute flight to Toray.\nThe Poo and Bupul villages have a clinic but people still use traditional medicines.\nThere is very little infrastructure in the area: no telephones or toilets. At night electricity is run from a generator. There are single side-band radios (SSBs) in Bupul, Tanas, Poo, and Erambu villages, mainly used by the police and military force.

{"title_page": "Physical attractiveness stereotype", "text_new": "{{cleanup reorganize|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe '''physical attractiveness stereotype''' is a tendency, described by [[Psychology|psychologists]], to assume that people who are [[Physical attractiveness|physically attractive]] also possess other socially desirable personality traits. In other words, \u201cwhat is beautiful is good\u201d. [[Stereotype|Stereotyping]] is the process by which we draw inferences about others based on knowledge of the categories to which they belong.<ref>Schacter, D. (2012) ''Introducing Psychology''. New York, NY: Worth Publishers</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n\n=== Physical Attractiveness ===\nIn certain instances, physical attractiveness is distinct from sexual attraction; humans may regard the young as attractive for various reasons, for example, but without sexual attraction.\n\nWomen, on average, tend to be attracted to men who are slightly taller and who have a relatively narrow waist and broad shoulders. Men, overall, tend to be attracted by women who are slightly shorter, have a youthful appearance and exhibit features such as a symmetrical face, full breasts, full lips, and a low waist-hip ratio.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2190461.stm Tall men 'top husband stakes'.

Despite universally held perceptions of beauty in both [[Sex|sexes]], males tend to place significantly higher value on physical appearance in a partner than women do.<ref name=\"BussBook2\">{{cite book|last=Buss|first=David|url=https://archive.org/details/evolutionofdesir00buss|title=The Evolution of Desire|publisher=Basic Books|year=2003|edition=second|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/evolutionofdesir00buss/page/57 57], 58, 60\u201363|type=hardcover|origyear=1994|url-access=registration}}</ref><ref name=\"tws6nov032\">{{cite news|author=Dubner, Stephen J.|url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/09/the-science-of-large-breasts-and-other-evolutionary-verities/?apage=3|title=The Science of Large Breasts, and Other Evolutionary Verities|date=July 9, 2007|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-11-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation ===\nPerception of attractiveness has also been shown to occur liberally or unconsciously with the [[Encoding (memory)|initial encoding of sensory data]], and that physical attractiveness has been shown to implicate [[Gender stereotype|gender-stereotype]] memory frames at the perceptual end of the social information-processing spectrum<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Locher|first=Paul|last2=Unger|first2=Rhoda|last3=Sociedade|first3=Paula|last4=Wahl|first4=Janet|date=1993-06|title=At first glance: Accessibility of the physical attractiveness stereotype|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00289990|journal=Sex Roles|volume=28|issue=11-12|pages=729\u2013743|doi=10.1007/bf00289990|issn=0360-0025}}</ref>. Locher et al. (1993) conducted a research to investigate whether stereotyped attribute judgments emerge based on attractiveness information presented under severely restricted viewing time, and that similar biased judgments would be obtained when participants are under permitted unrestricted viewing time. Experiment found that male and female college students were able to differentiate between levels of attractiveness of both males and females on the basis of cue information contained in a single brief glance (100 ms) and made stereotyped attribute judgments of \u00a0femininity/masculinity, job suitability, and cooperativeness based on this information under restricted and unrestricted time. The researchers concluded that perception of differential attractiveness occurred unconsciously with the initial encoding of sensory data.\n\n=== Culture ===\nStudies<ref name=\"Dionetal19722\">{{cite journal|last1=Dion|first1=K.|last2=Berscheid|first2=E.|authorlink2=Ellen S.

But they did not share the North American university students' bias towards perceiving beautiful people as more self-assertive and dominant than less attractive people. This can be seen in myths and fairy tales as well as films throughout history: the 'goodies' are young and beautiful, whereas the 'baddies' are ugly.\n\n=== Health Professionals ===\nPhysical attractiveness stereotype has also shown to exist among health professionals. Nordholm (1980) conducted a research with 289 health professionals reacting to pre-scaled stimulus photographs varying in age (young and mature), sex (male and female) and physical attractiveness (high and low). Each participant rated a single stimulus photo on fifteen 7-point bipolar personality characteristics. The results showed that attractive stimulus persons were rated more favourably than unattractive persons on 12 of the 15 characteristics<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nordholm|first=Lena A.|date=1980-01|title=Beautiful patients are good patients: Evidence for the physical attractiveness stereotype in first impressions of patients|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0160-7979(80)90013-2|journal=Social Science & Medicine.

Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by imagined or slight defects in one\u2019s appearance. Buhlmann et al. (2009) conducted a research to evaluate physical attractiveness stereotype among individuals diagnosed with BDD, individuals with subclinical BDD symptoms, and healthy participants (control group). Implicit association test (IAT) was used which examined associations between attractive and competent (physical attractiveness stereotype). Research showed that BDD participants had significantly stronger implicit associations between attractive and competent (physical attractiveness stereotype) than the other groups. The researchers concluded that Attractive Competent IAT was a significant predictor of BDD symptom severity, and distress and avoidance.\n\n=== Research ===\nPrevious studies have found a recognition bias for information consistent with the [[physical attractiveness]] stereotype<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rohner|first1=Jean-Christophe|last2=Rasmussen|first2=Anders|date=2012|title=Recognition bias and the physical attractiveness stereotype|journal=[[Scandinavian Journal of Psychology]]|volume=53|issue=3|pages=239\u2013246|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9450.2012.00939.x|pmid=22416805}}</ref>\n\nThe stereotype acts as a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] where the perception of attractive people as more valuable members of society leads to their receiving preferential treatment, positive [[feedback]] and tangible benefit.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hamermesh|first1=Daniel S.|last2=Biddle|first2=Jeff E.|year=1994|title=Beauty and the Labor Market|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w4518|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=84|issue=5|pages=1174\u20131194|doi=10.3386/w4518|jstor=2117767|doi-access=free}}</ref> Studies<ref>Berscheid, E.; Walster, E.

This [[cognitive bias]] could be considered to be a specific kind of [[halo effect]].\n\nBrand et al. (2012) conducted an experiment with 50 female psychology students from a university<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brand|first=Rebecca J.|last2=Bonatsos|first2=Abigail|last3=D\u2019Orazio|first3=Rebecca|last4=DeShong|first4=Hilary|date=2012-01|title=What is beautiful is good, even online: Correlations between photo attractiveness and text attractiveness in men\u2019s online dating profiles|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2011.08.023|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=28|issue=1|pages=166\u2013170|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2011.08.023|issn=0747-5632}}</ref>. Women were asked to rate the photos and texts of male profiles on a popular dating website. Data showed that photos rated as physically attractive had profile texts that were rated as more attractive. The researchers concluded that perceived confidence appeared to play a mediating role, pointing that attractive men write appealing texts as they are mindful of their high mate value. The fact that confidence mediated the relationship between physical attractiveness and positive personal characteristics is in agreement in the self-fulling prophecy. This confidence would then allow attractive men to write satisfactorily about themselves in way that women find sexually attractive.\n\n== Effects ==\nPhysical attractiveness can have a significant effect on how people are judged in terms of employment or social opportunities, friendship, sexual behavior, and marriage.<ref>Lorenz, Kate. (2005). \"[http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/Careers/07/08/looks/ Do Pretty People Earn More?]\" http://www.CNN.com.</ref> In many cases, humans attribute positive characteristics, such as intelligence and honesty, to attractive people without consciously realizing it.<ref name=\"Dionetal19722\" /> Physically attractive individuals are regarded more positively and accurately in first impressions, however the physical attractiveness stereotype will have bias opinions and decisions when comparing people of different attractiveness levels.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lorenzo|first1=G.

More attractive people are, on average, more likely to be employed and have a higher wage than their normal counterpart. According to this study, the estimated effects of the interviewer rating, generally, have a larger impact on men than for on women, while self-ratings (of attractiveness) have a larger effect on women than on men. However, in this study, the rating from others (in this case, the interviewer) have a larger effect than self-rating. \"The wage effects of attractiveness are nonlinear for men, which implies that wage punishment for unattractiveness is larger than wage premium for attractiveness, and linear for women.\"\n\n=== Students ===\nStudies show that teachers perceive attractive children as more intellectual, more engaged in school and more likely to succeed academically than unattractive children. This is because teachers have been shown to have more positive interactions with attractive children.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Byrnes|first1=D.

Vermeir and Van de Sompel (2014) conducted two experimental studies with respectively aged-8-9 and aged-12-13 girls and boys. Results showed that the presence of a moderately attractive (contrast to less attractive) model had a negative influence on general self-worth for aged-8-9 boys, but not girls, nor aged-12-13 children. Exposure to moderately attractive (contrast to less attractive) model also had a positive influence on perceived physical appearance of aged-8-9 girls, but this effect did not occur for boys, nor for aged-12-13 girls. The studies also showed that moderately attractive (contrast to less attractive) models increased attitudes and buying intentions for aged-8-9, but not for aged-12-13 boys and girls.\n\n=== Personal Selling ===\nIn a personal selling context, physical attractiveness of a salesperson has also been shown to have its greatest effect on buyers\u2019 initial impression of him or her and that appearance is only one among a large group of determinants that might ultimately affect selling effectiveness<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reingen|first=Peter H.|last2=Kernan|first2=Jerome B.|date=1993-01|title=Social perception and interpersonal influence: Some consequences of the physical attractiveness stereotype in a personal selling setting|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1057-7408(08)80073-3|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|volume=2|issue=1|pages=25\u201338|doi=10.1016/s1057-7408(08)80073-3|issn=1057-7408}}</ref>.

Attractive females commonly face a hostile work environment with female supervisors and female coworkers - unless the attractive female is employed in a low-status position.  Initially, both males and females (of average attractiveness) suspect attractive females of being intellectually inferior, but not so of attractive males. Attractive females are placed in a social position in which they must demonstrate above average competence.  Attractive males are not challenged in this manner.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Psychology}}\n* [[List of cognitive biases]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==References==\n*Brand, R.

More attractive people are, on average, more likely to be employed and have a higher wage than their normal counterpart. According to this study, the estimated effects of the interviewer rating, generally, have a larger impact on men than for on women, while self-ratings (of attractiveness) have a larger effect on women than on men. However, in this study, the rating from others (in this case, the interviewer) have a larger effect than self-rating. \"The wage effects of attractiveness are nonlinear for men, which implies that wage punishment for unattractiveness is larger than wage premium for attractiveness, and linear for women.\"\n\nStudies show that teachers perceive attractive children as more intellectual, more engaged in school and more likely to succeed academically than unattractive children.

Attractive females commonly face a hostile work environment with female supervisors and female coworkers - unless the attractive female is employed in a low-status position.  Initially, both males and females (of average attractiveness) suspect attractive females of being intellectually inferior, but not so of attractive males. Attractive females are placed in a social position in which they must demonstrate above average competence.  Attractive males are not challenged in this manner.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Psychology}}\n* [[List of cognitive biases]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal|last1=Eagly|first1=Alice H.|last2=Ashmore|first2=Richard D.|last3=Makhijani|first3=Mona G.|last4=Longo|first4=Laura C.|title=What is beautiful is good, but... : A meta-analytic review of research on the physical attractiveness stereotype|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1991|volume=110|issue=1|pages=109\u2013128|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.110.1.109|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/75134f5c90ec8f0399beac412d1d694e250be17b}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Rhode|first1=Deborah L.|authorlink1=Deborah Rhode|title=The Beauty Bias: the Injustice of Appearance in Life and Law |date=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, N.Y. |isbn=978-0195372878}}\n*{{cite journal|last1=Dion|first1=K.

She spoke the language of [[Occitan]], which was spoken by the local population of the [[Pyrenees]] region at that time and to a lesser degree today (which is similar to Catalan spoken in eastern Spain).\n\n== Visions ==\n{{Main|Lourdes apparitions}}\nBy the time of the events at the grotto, the Soubirous family's financial and social status had declined to the point where they lived in a one-room basement, formerly used as a jail, called ''le cachot'', \"the dungeon\", where they were housed for free by her mother's cousin, Andr\u00e9 Sajoux.<ref>Taylor 42.</ref>\n\nOn 11 February 1858, Soubirous, then aged 14, was out gathering firewood with her sister Toinette and a friend near the [[grotto]] of Massabielle (Tuta de Massavielha) when she experienced her first vision. While the other girls crossed the little stream in front of the grotto and walked on, Soubirous stayed behind, looking for a place to cross where she wouldn't get her stockings wet. She finally sat down to take her shoes off in order to cross the water and was lowering her stocking when she heard the sound of rushing wind, but nothing moved. A wild rose in a natural niche in the grotto, however, did move. From the niche, or rather the dark alcove behind it, \"came a dazzling light, and a white figure\".  This was the first of 18 visions of what she referred to as ''aquero'' (pronounced {{IPA|[a\u02c8k(e)\u027e\u0254]}}), [[Gascon language|Gascon]] [[Occitan]] for \"that\". In later testimony, she called it \"a small young lady\" (''uo petito damizelo''). Her sister and her friend stated that they had seen nothing.<ref>Taylor 59\u201360.</ref>\n\nOn 14 February, after Sunday Mass, Soubirous, with her sister Marie and some other girls, returned to the grotto. Soubirous knelt down immediately, saying she saw the apparition again and falling into a [[trance]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} When one of the girls threw [[holy water]] at the niche and another threw a rock from above that shattered on the ground, the apparition disappeared.<ref>Taylor 62\u201363.</ref> On her next visit, 18 February, Soubirous said that \"the vision\" asked her to return to the grotto every day for a fortnight.<ref>Taylor 68\u201369.</ref>\n\nThis period of almost daily visions came to be known as ''la Quinzaine sacr\u00e9e'', \"holy fortnight.\" Initially, Soubirous's parents, especially her mother, were embarrassed and tried to forbid her to go. The supposed apparition did not identify herself until the seventeenth vision. Although the townspeople who believed she was telling the truth assumed she saw the Virgin Mary, Soubirous never claimed it to be Mary, consistently using the word ''aquero''. She described the lady as wearing a white veil, a blue girdle and with a yellow rose on each foot&nbsp;\u2013 compatible with \"a description of any statue of the Virgin in a village church\".<ref>Taylor 84.</ref>\n\nSoubirous's story caused a sensation with the townspeople, who were divided in their opinions on whether or not she was telling the truth. Some believed her to have a mental illness and demanded she be put in an asylum.<ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\nThe other contents of Soubirous's reported visions were simple and focused on the need for prayer and penance. On 25 February she explained that the vision had told her \"to drink of the water of the spring, to wash in it and to eat the herb that grew there,\" as an act of penance. To everyone's surprise, the next day the grotto was no longer muddy but clear water flowed.<ref>Taylor 88\u201390.</ref> On 2 March, at the thirteenth of the alleged apparitions, Soubirous told her family that the lady said that \"a chapel should be built and a procession formed\".<ref name=crawley/>\n\nSoubirous's 16th claimed vision, which she stated went on for over an hour, was on 25 March. According to her account, during that visitation, she again asked the woman for her name but the lady just smiled back. She repeated the question three more times and finally heard the lady say, in [[Gascon language|Gascon]] [[Occitan]], \"I am the [[Immaculate Conception]]\" (''Qu\u00e9 so\u00ef era immaculado councepcio\u0169'', a phonetic transcription of ''Que soi era immaculada concepcion'').<ref name=crawley/>\n\nSome of the people who interviewed Soubirous after her revelation of the visions thought her simple-minded.{{who|date=April 2016}} However, despite being rigorously interviewed by officials of both the Catholic Church and the French government, she stuck consistently to her story.<ref name=crawley/>\n\n== Results of her visions ==\nAfter investigation, Catholic Church authorities confirmed the authenticity of the apparitions in 1862.<ref name=foley/> In the 150 years since Soubirous dug up the spring, 69<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.lourdes-france.org/deepen/cures-and-miracles/miraculous-cures-in-lourdes|title=Miraculous cures in Lourdes|publisher=}}</ref> cures have been verified by the [[Lourdes Medical Bureau]] as \"inexplicable\" \u2013 after what the Catholic Church claims are \"extremely rigorous scientific and medical examinations\" that failed to find any other explanation. The Lourdes Commission that examined Bernadette after the visions ran an intensive analysis on the water and found that, while it had a high mineral content, it contained nothing out of the ordinary that would account for the cures attributed to it. Bernadette said that it was faith and prayer that cured the sick: \"One must have faith and pray; the water will have no virtue without faith\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wordonfire.org/resources/blog/10-things-to-know-about-our-lady-of-lourdes-and-st-bernadette/2209/|title=10 Things to Know About Our Lady of Lourdes and St Bernadette|last=von Huben|first=Ellyn|date=11 February 2015|website=Word on Fire|access-date=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nSoubirous's request to the local priest to build a chapel at the site of her visions eventually gave rise to a number of chapels and churches at Lourdes. The [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes]] is now one of the major Catholic pilgrimage sites in the world. One of the churches built at the site, the [[Basilica of St. Pius X]], can accommodate 25,000 people and was dedicated by the future [[Pope John XXIII]] when he was the [[Papal Nuncio]] to France. Close to 5&nbsp;million pilgrims from all over the world visit Lourdes (population of about 15,000) every year to pray and to drink the miraculous water, believing that they obtain from the Lord healing of the body and of the spirit.\n\n== Later years ==\n[[File:Bernadette soubirous 2 publicdomain.gif|thumb|150px|Bernadette in 1866, after having took the religious habit and joining the Sisters of Charity]]\nDisliking the attention she was attracting, Bernadette went to the [[hospice]] school run by the [[Sisters of Charity of Nevers]] where she had learned to read and write. Although she considered joining the Carmelites, her health precluded her entering any of the strict contemplative orders. On 29 July 1866, with 42 other candidates, she took the religious habit of a [[postulant]] and joined the Sisters of Charity at their motherhouse at [[Nevers]]. Her Mistress of Novices was Sister [[Marie Therese Vauzou]].<ref name=snddl>{{cite web|url=http://en.lourdes-france.org/deepen/bernadette-soubirous/religious-life|title=Religious life|publisher=}}</ref> The Mother Superior at the time gave her the name Marie-Bernarde<ref name=bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.biographyonline.net/spiritual/bernadette-soubirious.html|title=Biography of Bernadette Soubirous|work=Biography Online}}</ref> in honor of her godmother who was named \"Bernarde\". As Patricia A. McEachern observes, \"Bernadette was devoted to Saint Bernard, her patron saint; she copied long texts related to him in notebooks and on bits of paper. The experience of becoming 'Sister Marie-Bernard' marked a turning point for Bernadette as she realized more than ever that the great grace she received from the Queen of Heaven brought with it great responsibilities.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A Holy Life\": The Writings of St. Bernadette|last=McEachern|first=Patricia|publisher=Ignatius Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}</ref>\n\nSoubirous spent the rest of her brief life at the motherhouse, working as an assistant in the infirmary<ref name=snddl/> and later as a [[Sacristy|sacristan]], creating beautiful [[embroidery]] for altar cloths and [[vestments]].

On her deathbed, as she suffered from severe pain and in keeping with the Virgin Mary's admonition of \"Penance, Penance, Penance,\" Bernadette proclaimed that \"all this is good for Heaven!\" Her final words were, \"Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for me, a poor sinner, a poor sinner\". Soubirous's body was laid to rest in the [[Saint Gildard Convent]].\n\n== Sainthood ==\nSoubirous was declared blessed on 14 June 1925<ref name=bio/> by Pope Pius XI.

The saint died 46 years before the photo]]\nBishop Gauthey of Nevers and the Catholic Church [[exhumation|exhumed]] the body of Soubirous on 22 September 1909, in the presence of representatives appointed by the postulators of the cause, two doctors and a sister of the community. They claimed that although the [[crucifix]] in her hand and her [[rosary]] had both [[redox|oxidized]], her body appeared [[Incorruptibility|incorrupt]] \u2013 preserved from [[decomposition]]. This was cited as one of the miracles to support her canonization. They washed and reclothed her body before burial in a new double casket.\n\nThe church exhumed the corpse a second time on 3 April 1919. A doctor who examined the body noted, \"The body is practically mummified, covered with patches of [[mildew]] and quite a notable layer of salts, which appear to be calcium salts. ...&nbsp;The skin has disappeared in some places, but it is still present on most parts of the body.\"\n\n[[File:Relic of bernadette.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Relic]] of St. Bernadette and stone from the [[Our Lady of Lourdes|Grotto of Lourdes]], where the Marian apparition of Our Lady of Lourdes is said to have appeared]]\nIn 1925, the church exhumed the body for a third time. They took [[relic]]s, which were sent to Rome. A precise imprint of the face was molded so that the firm of [[Pierre Imans]] in Paris could make a wax mask based on the imprints and on some genuine photos to be placed on her body. This was common practice for relics in France as it was feared that the blackish tinge to the face and the sunken eyes and nose would be viewed as corruption by the public. Imprints of the hands were also taken for the presentation of the body and the making of wax casts. The remains were then placed in a gold and [[crystal]] reliquary in the Chapel of Saint Bernadette at the motherhouse in [[Nevers]].\n\nThree years later in 1928, Doctor Comte published a report on the exhumation of Soubirous in the second issue of the ''Bulletin de I'Association medicale de Notre-Dame de Lourdes''.\n\n\"I would have liked to open the left side of the [[thorax]] to take the ribs as relics and then remove the heart which I am certain must have survived. However, as the trunk was slightly supported on the left arm, it would have been rather difficult to try and get at the heart without doing too much noticeable damage. As the Mother Superior had expressed a desire for the Saint's heart to be kept together with the whole body, and as Monsignor the Bishop did not insist, I gave up the idea of opening the left-hand side of the thorax and contented myself with removing the two right ribs which were more accessible. ... What struck me during this examination, of course, was the state of perfect preservation of the skeleton, the fibrous tissues of the muscles (still supple and firm), of the ligaments, and of the skin, and above all the totally unexpected state of the liver after 46 years. One would have thought that this organ, which is basically soft and inclined to crumble, would have decomposed very rapidly or would have hardened to a chalky consistency. Yet, when it was cut it was soft and almost normal in consistency. I pointed this out to those present, remarking that this did not seem to be a natural phenomenon.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncregister.com/blog/tmcdonald/the-marvelous-preservation-of-st.-bernadette|title=The Marvelous Preservation of St. Bernadette|website=National Catholic Register|accessdate=24 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n== In media ==\n* In 1909 the French short movie ''Bernadette Soubirous et les Apparitions de Lourdes'', directed by Honor\u00e9 Le Sablais,<ref name=lasemainedespyrenees>{{cite news|title=Cin\u00e9ma: Un festival \"Lourdes au cin\u00e9ma\"|url=http://www.lasemainedespyrenees.fr/article/08/10/2008/cinema--un-festival-lourdes-au-cinema/704|first=Christophe|last=Ruiz|journal=La Semaine des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es|date=8 October 2008|accessdate=3 July 2013|language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} See [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Bernadette+Soubirous+et+les+Apparitions+de+Lourdes%22%22Honor\u00e9+Le+Sablais%22+film+1909+-wikipedia&num=100&safe=off&filter=0&biw=1440&bih=695 occurrences] on Google.</ref> is the first attempt to tell with the new cinematographic art the story of Bernadette, according to [[RAI 3]] documentary ''Lourdes.

These apparitions are said to have occurred between 11 February and 16 July 1858, and the woman who appeared to her identified herself as the \"[[Immaculate Conception]].\"\n\nDespite initial skepticism from some Catholic Church authorities, Soubirous's claims were eventually declared \"worthy of belief\" after a canonical investigation, and the Marian apparition became known as [[Our Lady of Lourdes]]. Since her death, Soubirous's body has apparently remained internally [[Incorruptibility#Causes|incorrupt]].\nThe [[Marian shrine]] at Lourdes ([[Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]], from 2016 part of [[Occitanie]]) went on to become a major [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] site, attracting over five million pilgrims of all denominations each year.\n\nOn 8 December 1933, [[Pope Pius XI]], [[Canonization|declared]] Soubirous a saint of the Catholic Church.

Her godmother was Bernarde Casterot, her mother's sister, a moderately wealthy widow who owned a tavern. Hard times had fallen on France and the family lived in extreme poverty. Soubirous was a sickly child and possibly due to this only measured 4&nbsp;ft. 7in. tall. She contracted [[cholera]] as a toddler and suffered severe [[asthma]] for the rest of her life. Soubirous attended the day school conducted by the [[Sisters of Charity of Nevers|Sisters of Charity and Christian Instruction]] from [[Nevers]].<ref name=crawley>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/BERNADET.HTM|title=\"Saint Bernadette Soubirous\", ''Lives of Saints'', John J. Crawley & Co., Inc.|accessdate=24 October 2019}}</ref> Contrary to a belief popularized by Hollywood movies, Soubirous learned very little French, only studying French in school after age 13. She could read and write very little due to her frequent illness. She spoke the language of [[Occitan]], which was spoken by the local population of the [[Pyrenees]] region at that time and to a lesser degree today (which is similar to Catalan spoken in eastern Spain).\n\n== Visions ==\n{{Main|Lourdes apparitions}}\nBy the time of the events at the grotto, the Soubirous family's financial and social status had declined to the point where they lived in a one-room basement, formerly used as a jail, called ''le cachot'', \"the dungeon\", where they were housed for free by her mother's cousin, Andr\u00e9 Sajoux.<ref>Taylor 42.</ref>\n\nOn 11 February 1858, Soubirous, then aged 14, was out gathering firewood with her sister Toinette and a friend near the [[grotto]] of Massabielle (Tuta de Massavielha) when she experienced her first vision. While the other girls crossed the little stream in front of the grotto and walked on, Soubirous stayed behind, looking for a place to cross where she wouldn't get her stockings wet. She finally sat down to take her shoes off in order to cross the water and was lowering her stocking when she heard the sound of rushing wind, but nothing moved. A wild rose in a natural niche in the grotto, however, did move. From the niche, or rather the dark alcove behind it, \"came a dazzling light, and a white figure\".  This was the first of 18 visions of what she referred to as ''aquero'' (pronounced {{IPA|[a\u02c8k(e)\u027e\u0254]}}), [[Gascon language|Gascon]] [[Occitan]] for \"that\". In later testimony, she called it \"a small young lady\" (''uo petito damizelo''). Her sister and her friend stated that they had seen nothing.<ref>Taylor 59\u201360.</ref>\n\nOn 14 February, after Sunday Mass, Soubirous, with her sister Marie and some other girls, returned to the grotto. Soubirous knelt down immediately, saying she saw the apparition again and falling into a [[trance]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} When one of the girls threw [[holy water]] at the niche and another threw a rock from above that shattered on the ground, the apparition disappeared.<ref>Taylor 62\u201363.</ref> On her next visit, 18 February, Soubirous said that \"the vision\" asked her to return to the grotto every day for a fortnight.<ref>Taylor 68\u201369.</ref>\n\nThis period of almost daily visions came to be known as ''la Quinzaine sacr\u00e9e'', \"holy fortnight.\" Initially, Soubirous's parents, especially her mother, were embarrassed and tried to forbid her to go. The supposed apparition did not identify herself until the seventeenth vision. Although the townspeople who believed she was telling the truth assumed she saw the Virgin Mary, Soubirous never claimed it to be Mary, consistently using the word ''aquero''. She described the lady as wearing a white veil, a blue girdle and with a yellow rose on each foot&nbsp;\u2013 compatible with \"a description of any statue of the Virgin in a village church\".<ref>Taylor 84.</ref>\n\nSoubirous's story caused a sensation with the townspeople, who were divided in their opinions on whether or not she was telling the truth. Some believed her to have a mental illness and demanded she be put in an asylum.<ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\nThe other contents of Soubirous's reported visions were simple and focused on the need for prayer and penance. On 25 February she explained that the vision had told her \"to drink of the water of the spring, to wash in it and to eat the herb that grew there,\" as an act of penance. To everyone's surprise, the next day the grotto was no longer muddy but clear water flowed.<ref>Taylor 88\u201390.</ref> On 2 March, at the thirteenth of the alleged apparitions, Soubirous told her family that the lady said that \"a chapel should be built and a procession formed\".<ref name=crawley/>\n\nSoubirous's 16th claimed vision, which she stated went on for over an hour, was on 25 March. According to her account, during that visitation, she again asked the woman for her name but the lady just smiled back. She repeated the question three more times and finally heard the lady say, in [[Gascon language|Gascon]] [[Occitan]], \"I am the [[Immaculate Conception]]\" (''Qu\u00e9 so\u00ef era immaculado councepcio\u0169'', a phonetic transcription of ''Que soi era immaculada concepcion'').<ref name=crawley/>\n\nSome of the people who interviewed Soubirous after her revelation of the visions thought her simple-minded.{{who|date=April 2016}} However, despite being rigorously interviewed by officials of both the Catholic Church and the French government, she stuck consistently to her story.<ref name=crawley/>\n\n== Results of her visions ==\nAfter investigation, Catholic Church authorities confirmed the authenticity of the apparitions in 1862.<ref name=foley/> In the 150 years since Soubirous dug up the spring, 69<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.lourdes-france.org/deepen/cures-and-miracles/miraculous-cures-in-lourdes|title=Miraculous cures in Lourdes|publisher=}}</ref> cures have been verified by the [[Lourdes Medical Bureau]] as \"inexplicable\" \u2013 after what the Catholic Church claims are \"extremely rigorous scientific and medical examinations\" that failed to find any other explanation. The Lourdes Commission that examined Bernadette after the visions ran an intensive analysis on the water and found that, while it had a high mineral content, it contained nothing out of the ordinary that would account for the cures attributed to it. Bernadette said that it was faith and prayer that cured the sick: \"One must have faith and pray; the water will have no virtue without faith\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wordonfire.org/resources/blog/10-things-to-know-about-our-lady-of-lourdes-and-st-bernadette/2209/|title=10 Things to Know About Our Lady of Lourdes and St Bernadette|last=von Huben|first=Ellyn|date=11 February 2015|website=Word on Fire|access-date=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nSoubirous's request to the local priest to build a chapel at the site of her visions eventually gave rise to a number of chapels and churches at Lourdes. The [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes]] is now one of the major Catholic pilgrimage sites in the world. One of the churches built at the site, the [[Basilica of St. Pius X]], can accommodate 25,000 people and was dedicated by the future [[Pope John XXIII]] when he was the [[Papal Nuncio]] to France. Close to 5 million pilgrims from all over the world visit Lourdes (population of about 15,000) every year to pray and to drink the miraculous water, believing that they obtain from the Lord healing of the body and of the spirit.\n\n== Later years ==\n[[File:Bernadette soubirous 2 publicdomain.gif|thumb|150px|Bernadette in 1866, after having took the religious habit and joining the Sisters of Charity]]\nDisliking the attention she was attracting, Bernadette went to the [[hospice]] school run by the [[Sisters of Charity of Nevers]] where she had learned to read and write. Although she considered joining the Carmelites, her health precluded her entering any of the strict contemplative orders. On 29 July 1866, with 42 other candidates, she took the religious habit of a [[postulant]] and joined the Sisters of Charity at their motherhouse at [[Nevers]]. Her Mistress of Novices was Sister [[Marie Therese Vauzou]].<ref name=snddl>{{cite web|url=http://en.lourdes-france.org/deepen/bernadette-soubirous/religious-life|title=Religious life|publisher=}}</ref> The Mother Superior at the time gave her the name Marie-Bernarde<ref name=bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.biographyonline.net/spiritual/bernadette-soubirious.html|title=Biography of Bernadette Soubirous|work=Biography Online}}</ref> in honor of her godmother who was named \"Bernarde\". As Patricia A. McEachern observes, \"Bernadette was devoted to Saint Bernard, her patron saint; she copied long texts related to him in notebooks and on bits of paper. The experience of becoming 'Sister Marie-Bernard' marked a turning point for Bernadette as she realized more than ever that the great grace she received from the Queen of Heaven brought with it great responsibilities.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A Holy Life\": The Writings of St. Bernadette|last=McEachern|first=Patricia|publisher=Ignatius Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}</ref>\n\nSoubirous spent the rest of her brief life at the motherhouse, working as an assistant in the infirmary<ref name=snddl/> and later as a [[Sacristy|sacristan]], creating beautiful [[embroidery]] for altar cloths and [[vestments]].

On her deathbed, as she suffered from severe pain and in keeping with the Virgin Mary's admonition of \"Penance, Penance, Penance,\" Bernadette proclaimed that \"all this is good for Heaven!\" Her final words were, \"Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for me, a poor sinner, a poor sinner\". Soubirous's body was laid to rest in the [[Saint Gildard Convent]].\n\n== Sainthood ==\nSoubirous was declared blessed on 14 June 1925<ref name=bio/> by Pope Pius XI.

The saint died 46 years before the photo]]\nBishop Gauthey of Nevers and the Catholic Church [[exhumation|exhumed]] the body of Soubirous on 22 September 1909, in the presence of representatives appointed by the postulators of the cause, two doctors and a sister of the community. They claimed that although the [[crucifix]] in her hand and her [[rosary]] had both [[redox|oxidized]], her body appeared [[Incorruptibility|incorrupt]] \u2013 preserved from [[decomposition]]. This was cited as one of the miracles to support her canonization. They washed and reclothed her body before burial in a new double casket.\n\nThe church exhumed the corpse a second time on 3 April 1919. A doctor who examined the body noted, \"The body is practically mummified, covered with patches of [[mildew]] and quite a notable layer of salts, which appear to be calcium salts. ...&nbsp;The skin has disappeared in some places, but it is still present on most parts of the body.\"\n\n[[File:Relic of bernadette.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Relic]] of St. Bernadette and stone from the [[Our Lady of Lourdes|Grotto of Lourdes]], where the Marian apparition of Our Lady of Lourdes is said to have appeared]]\nIn 1925, the church exhumed the body for a third time. They took [[relic]]s, which were sent to Rome. A precise imprint of the face was molded so that the firm of [[Pierre Imans]] in Paris could make a wax mask based on the imprints and on some genuine photos to be placed on her body. This was common practice for relics in France as it was feared that the blackish tinge to the face and the sunken eyes and nose would be viewed as corruption by the public. Imprints of the hands were also taken for the presentation of the body and the making of wax casts. The remains were then placed in a gold and [[crystal]] reliquary in the Chapel of Saint Bernadette at the motherhouse in [[Nevers]].\n\nThree years later in 1928, Doctor Comte published a report on the exhumation of Soubirous in the second issue of the ''Bulletin de I'Association medicale de Notre-Dame de Lourdes''.\n\n\"I would have liked to open the left side of the [[thorax]] to take the ribs as relics and then remove the heart which I am certain must have survived. However, as the trunk was slightly supported on the left arm, it would have been rather difficult to try and get at the heart without doing too much noticeable damage. As the Mother Superior had expressed a desire for the Saint's heart to be kept together with the whole body, and as Monsignor the Bishop did not insist, I gave up the idea of opening the left-hand side of the thorax and contented myself with removing the two right ribs which were more accessible. ... What struck me during this examination, of course, was the state of perfect preservation of the skeleton, the fibrous tissues of the muscles (still supple and firm), of the ligaments, and of the skin, and above all the totally unexpected state of the liver after 46 years. One would have thought that this organ, which is basically soft and inclined to crumble, would have decomposed very rapidly or would have hardened to a chalky consistency. Yet, when it was cut it was soft and almost normal in consistency. I pointed this out to those present, remarking that this did not seem to be a natural phenomenon.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncregister.com/blog/tmcdonald/the-marvelous-preservation-of-st.-bernadette|title=The Marvelous Preservation of St. Bernadette|website=National Catholic Register|accessdate=24 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n== In media ==\n* In 1909 the French short movie ''Bernadette Soubirous et les Apparitions de Lourdes'', directed by Honor\u00e9 Le Sablais,<ref name=lasemainedespyrenees>{{cite news|title=Cin\u00e9ma: Un festival \"Lourdes au cin\u00e9ma\"|url=http://www.lasemainedespyrenees.fr/article/08/10/2008/cinema--un-festival-lourdes-au-cinema/704|first=Christophe|last=Ruiz|journal=La Semaine des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es|date=8 October 2008|accessdate=3 July 2013|language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} See [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Bernadette+Soubirous+et+les+Apparitions+de+Lourdes%22%22Honor\u00e9+Le+Sablais%22+film+1909+-wikipedia&num=100&safe=off&filter=0&biw=1440&bih=695 occurrences] on Google.</ref> is the first attempt to tell with the new cinematographic art the story of Bernadette, according to [[RAI 3]] documentary ''Lourdes.

Aviation operations were carried out by the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service]] and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] ([[K\u014dk\u016btai]]). Following [[World War II]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]] were disbanded in 1945. [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|Article 9]] of the United States\u2013written [[Constitution of Japan|1947 constitution]] prevented Japan from having a regular [[military]].\n\nOn 1 July 1954, the National Security Board was reorganized as the Defense Agency, and the National Security Force was reorganized afterwards as the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]] (''de facto'' post-war Japanese [[Army]]), the Coastal Safety Force was reorganized as the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] (''de facto'' post-war Japanese [[Navy]]) and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (''de facto'' post-war Japanese [[Air Force]]) was established as a new branch of JSDF. General [[Keiz\u014d Hayashi]] was appointed as the first Chairman of Joint Staff Council\u2014professional head of the three branches.

of military aircraft of Japan}}\nThe JASDF maintains an integrated network of [[radar]] installations and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defense]] direction centers throughout the country known as the Basic Air Defense Ground Environment. In the late 1980s, the system was modernized and augmented with [[E-2 Hawkeye|E-2C Hawkeye]] airborne early warning aircraft. The nation relies on fighter-[[interceptor aircraft]] and [[surface-to-air missile]]s to intercept hostile aircraft. Both of these systems were improved from the beginning of the late 1980s. Outmoded aircraft were replaced in the early 1990s with more sophisticated models, and [[Nike-J]] missiles have been replaced with the modern [[MIM-104 Patriot#PAC-2|Patriot PAC-2]] and [[MIM-104 Patriot#PAC-3|PAC-3]] system. The JASDF also provides air support for ground and sea operations of the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force|JGSDF]] and the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force|JMSDF]] and air defense for bases of all the forces.

Aviation operations were carried out by the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service]] and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] ([[K\u014dk\u016btai]]). Following [[World War II]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]] were disbanded in 1945. [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|Article 9]] of the United States\u2013written [[Constitution of Japan|1947 constitution]] prevented Japan from having a regular [[military]].\n\nOn 1 July 1954, the National Security Board was reorganized as the Defense Agency, and the National Security Force was reorganized afterwards as the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]] (''de facto'' post-war Japanese [[Army]]), the Coastal Safety Force was reorganized as the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] (''de facto'' post-war Japanese [[Navy]]) and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (''de facto'' post-war Japanese [[Air Force]]) was established as a new branch of JSDF. General [[Keiz\u014d Hayashi]] was appointed as the first Chairman of Joint Staff Council\u2014professional head of the three branches. The enabling legislation for this was the 1954 Self-Defense Forces Act (Act No. 165 of 1954).<ref name=\"Defendingjapan.wordpress.com-2\">{{cite web|url=http://defendingjapan.wordpress.com/tag/japan-self-defense-force/ |title=Japan Self-Defense Force &#124; Defending Japan |publisher=Defendingjapan.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-03}}</ref> <ref name=\"Takei\">{{Cite journal |title=Japan Maritime Self Defense Force in the New Maritime Era |last=Takei |first=Tomohisa |authorlink=Tomohisa Takei |volume=34 |date=2008 |url=http://www.mod.go.jp/msdf/navcol/SSG/topics-column/images/c-030/c-030_eng.pdf |format=pdf |journal=Hatou |publisher=Hatou |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215184046/http://www.mod.go.jp/msdf/navcol/SSG/topics-column/images/c-030/c-030_eng.pdf |archivedate=15 December 2018 |page=3 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Takei ja\">{{cite journal  |script-title= ja:\u6d77\u6d0b\u65b0\u6642\u4ee3\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u6d77\u4e0a\u81ea\u885b\u968a |trans-title=Japan Maritime Self Defense Force in the New Maritime Era |author=\u6b66\u5c45\u667a\u4e45 |authorlink=Tomohisa Takei |volume=34 |date=2008 |url=http://www.mod.go.jp/msdf/navcol/SSG/topics-column/images/c-030/c-030.pdf |format=pdf |journal=\u6ce2\u6d9b |publisher=\u6ce2\u6d9b\u7de8\u96c6\u59d4\u54e1\u4f1a |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215184134/http://www.mod.go.jp/msdf/navcol/SSG/topics-column/images/c-030/c-030.pdf |archivedate=15 December 2018 |page=5  |df=dmy-all |language=ja}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Far East Air Force (United States)|Far East Air Force]], U.S. Air Force, announced on 6 January 1955, that 85 aircraft would be turned over to the fledgling Japanese air force on about 15 January, the first equipment of the new force.<ref>Associated Press, \"Jap Air Force Will Get 85 U.

of military aircraft of Japan}}\nThe JASDF maintains an integrated network of [[radar]] installations and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defense]] direction centers throughout the country known as the Basic Air Defense Ground Environment. In the late 1980s, the system was modernized and augmented with [[E-2 Hawkeye|E-2C Hawkeye]] airborne early warning aircraft. The nation relies on fighter-[[interceptor aircraft]] and [[surface-to-air missile]]s to intercept hostile aircraft. Both of these systems were improved from the beginning of the late 1980s. Outmoded aircraft were replaced in the early 1990s with more sophisticated models, and [[Nike-J]] missiles have been replaced with the modern [[MIM-104 Patriot#PAC-2|Patriot PAC-2]] and [[MIM-104 Patriot#PAC-3|PAC-3]] system. The JASDF also provides air support for ground and sea operations of the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force|JGSDF]] and the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force|JMSDF]] and air defense for bases of all the forces. Base defenses were upgraded in the late 1980s with new surface-to-air missiles, modern antiaircraft artillery and new fixed and mobile aircraft shelters.\n\n===Aircraft===\n[[File:F-35A_from_the_Japan_Air_Force.jpg|thumb|A JASDF F-35]]\n[[File:E-2C (13724985533).jpg|thumb|An E-2C Hawkeye landing at [[Misawa Air Base]] ]]\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas RF-4EJ Kai Phantom II, Japan - Air Force AN1983493.jpg|thumb|An RF-4E Phantom II]]\n[[File:67-4495 CH-47J from Iruma AB (5215150649).jpg|thumb|A CH-47J from [[Iruma Air Base]]]]\n[[File:Kawasaki T-4, Japan - Air Force AN2240189.jpg|thumb|A [[Kawasaki T-4]] ]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n\n!

But the history is vocally transferred from ancient. There are lots of stories which tells about the birth of Sudalaimadan.\n\nBorn in Kailash by penance of Parvathi is first birth.\n\nAnother story about Sudalai Madaswamy tells of his birth on Kailasa, the mountain home of Siva and Parvathi. It is said that Devi Parvathi wanted a child, but Lord Siva had sworn celibacy. He had promised to be chaste at the request of the gods since they had feared that his union with Parvathy would be so powerful it would shatter the universe. Siva suggests another way to have a child. He tells Parvathy to go and do penance in Ayiramkal Mandapam (Place having 1000 pillars in Kailash). Parvathi did penance. Shiva was happy about that. Then he plucked his hair, it started to burn as soon as he plucked and threw in that place. The fire spread on her mundanai (a part of saree). From the fire, Sudalai Madan is born.\n\nParvathi initially feeds the child on Amrita (the nectar of immortality), instead of on breast milk. So it is said that the child became immortal. However, the child also became desirous of solid food. He went to the cremation grounds (\"sudalai\") on Kailasa and began to eat the burning corpses.\nsince he had such a fondness for meat, it was decided that he ought not to remain in Kailash. Siva instructed him to go to Earth and to care for its people. Siva proclaimed that Sudalai Madan's protection and kindness would be re-paid with offerings of cooked food and drink, and thus he would always have a meal, as well as people who would pray to him. So Sudalai Madan came to earth, accompanied by a number of singers and dancers who were sent by Siva to see to his worship.\n\n==Worship==\n\nOften Sudalai Madan statues are triangular pillar-like structure and figured statues are stone carved. He is either in open or under a simple roof. The devotees serve non-vegetarian foods to him. Goats, chickens, and pigs are sacrificed and served to him. Fridays are optimum for Sudalai Madan. Special poojas are conducted every last Fridays of Tamil months and yearly once or twice main festivals are conducted for Sudalai Madan. These festivals are called \"Kodai\". Kodai is celebrated for one day to many days according to the devotees need. Some famous temples celebrate it for 10 days.\n[[File:Sudalai madan 2019.jpg|alt=|thumb|Shiva Sudali Madan , pattom , Trivandrum]]\n[[File:Shiavarathri padap 2020.jpg|alt=|thumb|Shiva Sudali Madan sammy , valliya padukka ]]\nOn these occasions, the deities are fully decorated with flowers. Some people get possessed on God and devotees talk to God through them. God goes for hunting in the cemetery through this spiritually possessed person. Art forms of Thappattai beats, Kaniyan Koothu (Maguda Kacheri) and Villupattu are main performances of Sudalai Maadan Kodai festival.\n[[File:SudalaiMadan return from hunting.jpg|thumb|Mystics return with osseous matter from winnowing at a ''[[Shmashana|Smashana]]''.]]\n\nThere is a famous Sudalai Madam deity or a person who perceived the spiritual power of Lord Sudalai Madan in K. K. Nagar, [[Chennai]] who would directly speak to Sudalai Madan and convey it back to the devotees. When there is theft Sudalai Madan will let this deity know and help to find the lost objects.\n\nSudalai Madan Temple function (Kovil Kodai) is very famously celebrated every year in Avudaiyanoor Near Pavoorchatram, Tenkasi Taluk, Tirunelveli District.\n\n==Outside India==\nMadan is also popular amongst certain segments of the [[Tamil diaspora]] in [[Sri Lanka]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[R\u00e9union]] and the [[France|French]] overseas territories in the [[Caribbean]] sea.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe 1992 Tamil movie [[Chinna Thayee]] has a character which is spiritually possessed by this god.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080320050247/http://www.iccsus.org/IstConf/111.html Sudalai Madan amongst Indian origin Tamils]\n* [http://www.cmi.ac.in/gift/Surveys/surv_deities.htm South Indian Deities And Their Relative Following in Tamil Nadu]\n* [http://www.epw.org.in/showArticles.php?root=2005&leaf=05&filename=8711&filetype=html Secularism and Religious Violence in Contemporary India]\n\n{{HinduMythology}}Oosikadu Sudalai madaswamy kovil vadaku anchukudirupu\n\n[[Category:Tamil deities]]\n[[Category:Regional Hindu gods]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Shivarathri 2020 Sudali Madan Sammy.jpg|alt=|thumb|Sree Shiva Sudalai Madan Sammy, Pattom, Trivandrum]]\n[File:Sudalai madan.jpg.jpg|alt=|center|thumb|293x293px|Arulmigu, Shri.

But the history is vocally transferred from ancient. There are lots of stories which tells about the birth of Sudalaimadan.\n\nBorn in Kailash by penance of Parvathi is first birth.\n\nAnother story about Sudalai Madaswamy tells of his birth on Kailasa, the mountain home of Siva and Parvathi. It is said that Devi Parvathi wanted a child, but Lord Siva had sworn celibacy. He had promised to be chaste at the request of the gods since they had feared that his union with Parvathy would be so powerful it would shatter the universe. Siva suggests another way to have a child. He tells Parvathy to go and do penance in Ayiramkal Mandapam (Place having 1000 pillars in Kailash). Parvathi did penance. Shiva was happy about that. Then he plucked his hair, it started to burn as soon as he plucked and threw in that place. The fire spread on her mundanai (a part of saree). From the fire, Sudalai Madan is born.\n\nParvathi initially feeds the child on Amrita (the nectar of immortality), instead of on breast milk. So it is said that the child became immortal. However, the child also became desirous of solid food. He went to the cremation grounds (\"sudalai\") on Kailasa and began to eat the burning corpses.\nsince he had such a fondness for meat, it was decided that he ought not to remain in Kailash. Siva instructed him to go to Earth and to care for its people. Siva proclaimed that Sudalai Madan's protection and kindness would be re-paid with offerings of cooked food and drink, and thus he would always have a meal, as well as people who would pray to him. So Sudalai Madan came to earth, accompanied by a number of singers and dancers who were sent by Siva to see to his worship.\n\n==Worship==\n\nOften Sudalai Madan statues are triangular pillar-like structure and figured statues are stone carved. He is either in open or under a simple roof. The devotees serve non-vegetarian foods to him. Goats, chickens, and pigs are sacrificed and served to him. Fridays are optimum for Sudalai Madan. Special poojas are conducted every last Fridays of Tamil months and yearly once or twice main festivals are conducted for Sudalai Madan. These festivals are called \"Kodai\". Kodai is celebrated for one day to many days according to the devotees need. Some famous temples celebrate it for 10 days.\n[[File:Sudalai madan 2019.jpg|alt=|thumb|Shiva Sudali Madan , pattom , Trivandrum]]\n[[File:Shiavarathri padap 2020.jpg|alt=|thumb|Shiva Sudali Madan sammy , valliya padukka ]]\nOn these occasions, the deities are fully decorated with flowers. Some people get possessed on God and devotees talk to God through them. God goes for hunting in the cemetery through this spiritually possessed person. Art forms of Thappattai beats, Kaniyan Koothu (Maguda Kacheri) and Villupattu are main performances of Sudalai Maadan Kodai festival.\n[[File:SudalaiMadan return from hunting.jpg|thumb|Mystics return with osseous matter from winnowing at a ''[[Shmashana|Smashana]]''.]]\n\nThere is a famous Sudalai Madam deity or a person who perceived the spiritual power of Lord Sudalai Madan in K. K. Nagar, [[Chennai]] who would directly speak to Sudalai Madan and convey it back to the devotees. When there is theft Sudalai Madan will let this deity know and help to find the lost objects.\n\nSudalai Madan Temple function (Kovil Kodai) is very famously celebrated every year in Avudaiyanoor Near Pavoorchatram, Tenkasi Taluk, Tirunelveli District.\n\n==Outside India==\nMadan is also popular amongst certain segments of the [[Tamil diaspora]] in [[Sri Lanka]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[R\u00e9union]] and the [[France|French]] overseas territories in the [[Caribbean]] sea.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe 1992 Tamil movie [[Chinna Thayee]] has a character which is spiritually possessed by this god.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080320050247/http://www.iccsus.org/IstConf/111.html Sudalai Madan amongst Indian origin Tamils]\n* [http://www.cmi.ac.in/gift/Surveys/surv_deities.htm South Indian Deities And Their Relative Following in Tamil Nadu]\n* [http://www.epw.org.in/showArticles.php?root=2005&leaf=05&filename=8711&filetype=html Secularism and Religious Violence in Contemporary India]\n\n{{HinduMythology}}Oosikadu Sudalai madaswamy kovil vadaku anchukudirupu\n\n[[Category:Tamil deities]]\n[[Category:Regional Hindu gods]]\n", "name_user": "Thianeswaran", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudalai_Madan"}
