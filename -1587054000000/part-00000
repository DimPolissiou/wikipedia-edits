Clearing missions in an area and collecting key intel unlocks missions where players can target a ''buchon'' and eliminate him or her by killing or capturing the target (with some exceptions). Eliminating enough ''buchones'' in an operations division allows players to target that division's underboss, and eliminating that underboss and all of the ''buchones'' in an operations division leaves the division head vulnerable. Capturing this division head cripples and destabilizes the division and makes the cartel boss more vulnerable.<ref>[https://www.redbull.com/gb-en/ghost-recon-wildlands-tips-guide ''Ghost Recon: Wildlands'' Tips & Guide] Red Bull</ref>\n\nIt features [[cooperative multiplayer]] mode, in which players can be joined by up to three other players to explore the game's world and to complete campaign missions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-06-16-ubisoft-reveals-open-world-ghost-recon-wildlands|title=Ubisoft reveals open-world Ghost Recon: Wildlands|first=Jon|last=Hicks|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=June 17, 2015|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"GRadar\"/> The game can also be played solo, in which the player will be accompanied by three AI teammates, which the player can give orders to, if a player wants a more \"lone wolf\" playstyle they can be disabled via the settings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/ghost_recon_wildlands/b/playstation4/archive/2015/06/18/is-ghost-recon-wildlands-the-next-blockbuster-shooter.aspx|title=Is Ghost Recon Wildlands The Next Blockbuster Shooter?|first=Matt|last=Bertz|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=June 18, 2015|accessdate=June 25, 2015}}</ref> A [[player versus player|competitive multiplayer]] mode has been released as part of a free update on October 10, 2017.

The country has become increasingly unstable as a Mexican [[drug cartel]] known as the Santa Blanca Cartel gains control of several regions through the country. Led by the brutal and religious cartel boss El Sue\u00f1o, the cartel gains more power and influence within and outside the country and turns Bolivia into the world's largest producer of cocaine. In an attempt to fight off Santa Blanca\u2019s armed occupation in their country, the government of Bolivia establishes La Unidad, an elite special forces group tasked with fighting the Cartel. Both factions eventually establish a truce to prevent more bloodshed after months of brutal fighting, with of some Unidad\u2019s personnel secretly working for Santa Blanca. DEA Agent Ricky \u201cRicardo\u201d Sandoval is sent undercover in Santa Blanca in a joint operation with the CIA to gather intelligence on the Cartel, eventually working for El Sue\u00f1o himself. The United States is finally compelled to act when a bomb targets the US embassy in [[La Paz]] and Sandoval is executed by the cartel after his cover is blown.\n\n===Campaign===\n\nA Ghost Recon fireteam is deployed to Bolivia as part of Operation Kingslayer, a joint operation between the [[CIA]], [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]], and [[JSOC]].<ref name=\"Ubi\"/> The team consists of team leader and support gunner \"Nomad\", vehicle and assault specialist \"Midas\", hacker and tactical engineer \"Holt\", and sniper \"Weaver\". The Ghosts enter Bolivia with their CIA contact, Karen Bowman, who was also a close friend to Sandoval. They meet Pac Katari, leader of the Kataris 26, the only resistance against Santa Blanca. Pac Katari requests they rescue Amaru, whose ideologies inspired the Kataris 26, from Santa Blanca. The Ghosts are then free to tackle the cartel in any way and order they see fit.\n\nThe Ghosts dismantle the cartel piece by piece, targeting their four main operations by attacking cocaine production facilities and stockpiles, disrupting smuggling operations, discrediting the cartel in the eyes of corrupt politicians and supporters, and inciting conflict between the cartel's senior figures. The team are eventually contacted by El Sue\u00f1o, who lures them to a meeting. The Ghosts hesitantly agree, but do not find El Sue\u00f1o at the agreed location. El Sue\u00f1o instead contacts them via phone to bribe the Ghosts into working for him. The Ghosts refuse his offer and instead threaten him.\n\nWhile dismantling the cartel, the team finds and collects audio tapes of agent Sandoval's reports to Bowman of his time working undercover for El Sue\u00f1o. Sandoval's reports reveal that he had become deeply troubled by his mission, not only by the crimes he had committed to keep his cover but also by his superiors' reluctance to take action against the cartel. After recovering Sandoval's body from the cartel, Sueno contacts them again to offer them a tape of \u201cSandoval's confession\u201d. Upon listening to it, they are disturbed to learn that Sandoval was responsible for the embassy bombing and framed Santa Blanca for the crime so that the United States government would be forced intervene in Bolivia. Though Bowman and the team are angered by Sandoval's deception, they decide to continue with the mission as the cartel still poses a threat.\n\nAfter dismantling half of the cartel, Pac Katari claims his men have located El Sue\u00f1o, but the Ghosts grow suspicious when they instead find the body of Amaru. Unable to contact Bowman, they find her captured by the Katari 26 and Pac Katari breaks their alliance, claiming that the rebels must kill El Sue\u00f1o themselves to avoid being seen as puppets of the United States. The Ghosts rescue Bowman and race to El Sue\u00f1o's mausoleum to capture him before Pac Katari kills him. After fighting their way through both rebel and cartel opposition, the Ghosts and Bowman surround El Sue\u00f1o, who has beheaded Katari. Despite his surrendering, Bowman receives a call from her superiors, informing that El Sue\u00f1o had made a deal with the Department of Justice to give up the heads of other drug cartels in exchange for immunity.\n\nHow the story ends depends on whether the Ghosts fully dismantled the cartel. If remnants of the cartel remain, Bowman will execute El Sue\u00f1o, leading to her dismissal from the CIA and her arrest for murdering El Sue\u00f1o. She expresses no regrets in doing so, fearing that El Sue\u00f1o would become a dictator with the United States' backing. If the Ghosts have fully dismantled the cartel, Bowman takes El Sue\u00f1o into protective custody. El Sue\u00f1o provides further intelligence on other drug cartels, terrorist groups, and arms smugglers. Bowman predicts that when the intelligence runs out, El Sue\u00f1o will either be extradited by Mexico or cut loose and start a new drug cartel, starting the cycle over again. She and the Ghosts resolve to prepare themselves for the next fight.\n\n===Downloadable Content===\nShortly after the game's release, Ubisoft announced plans to release two episodes of [[downloadable content]], each with their own narrative set in Bolivia.\n\n====''Narco Road''====\n\nThis episode sees the player take on the role of an unnamed Ghost sent undercover into Bolivia by the CIA to identify \"El Invisible\", the elusive head of Santa Blanca's smuggling network. The Ghost poses as a mercenary for hire and befriends the leaders of the gangs carrying out smuggling operations. Each gang leader provides clues to El Invisible's identity before the Ghost assassinates them. Eventually the Ghost's notoriety grows to the point where El Invisible recruits them into Santa Blanca, erasing the Ghost's identity and staging their death. However, El Invisible is aware that the Ghost is a CIA agent and has them imprisoned. The Ghost escapes and with the help of an informant using the alias Se\u00f1or Sonrisa, recovers the handheld device El Invisible uses to run Santa Blanca's smuggling network anonymously and seemingly kills El Invisible. When the device is decrypted, it unleashes a virus that compromises the CIA. The Ghost deduces that Sonrisa is El Invisible, and that he orchestrated the operation to escape Santa Blanca, attack the CIA and disappear for good. Unable to explain Sonrisa's motive for attacking them, the CIA spend the next two years tracking him. He is eventually found in Arizona and the Ghost is assigned a mission to kill him.\n\n====''Fallen Ghosts''====\n\nThe second episode follows the Ghost Recon fireteam on their return to Bolivia. The cocaine trade has collapsed in the aftermath of Operation Kingslayer and with Pac Katari's death, the Kataris 26 have descended into in-fighting. In a bid to restore order, the Bolivian government has tried to rebuild the tactical police unit Unidad with special forces from across Latin America. Now known as \"Los Extranjeros\", these remnants of Unidad prove to be corrupt and seize control of cocaine production. When a data breach in the CIA compromises the identities of every active agent in Bolivia, the Ghosts return to extract the compromised agents. Their mission goes awry when their helicopter is shot down moments after they enter Bolivian airspace. They regroup and rescue a CIA field officer code-named Socrates. As Los Extranjeros are better-armed, trained and organised than Unidad, extracting the compromised agents proves impossible. Socrates instead proposes that the Ghosts target Los Extranjeros' commanders and rebuild the Kataris 26. Their actions prompt Los Extranjeros' commanding officer, Colonel Merlo, to personally take charge of the remaining forces. When Merlo is killed, Los Extranjeros tears itself apart, and evidence of their crimes causes a political scandal that upends the Bolivian government. The Ghosts and Socrates depart, questioning whether this will be enough to change the course of Bolivia's future.\n\n===Special Operations===\n\nAs part of the ongoing effort to support the game, Ubisoft has also released short-term Special Operations DLC.\n\n====Predator====\n\nThe first pack, released in December 2017, features a mission to hunt the [[Predator (alien)|Predator]]. In the expansion, the team investigate several brutal killings in the forested areas of Bolivia, finding several skinned corpses and a crashed alien vessel until encountering the deadly Predator. After a lengthy battle, the team manage to defeat the Predator before it activates its self destruct, killing itself in a massive explosion. The squad debate informing Bowman of the encounter, but ultimately choose to keep it to themselves.\n\n====''Operation Watchman''====\nThe next pack, ''Operation Watchman'', features a tie-in with ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell]]'', with actor [[Michael Ironside]] reprising the role of Sam Fisher. Fisher is deployed to Bolivia in order to recover sensitive intelligence data from a rogue CIA officer. Fisher has Fourth Echelon contact Bowman and borrow the Ghost team to assist in his mission. Fisher's deployment takes him to a Unidad base in La Cruz, where he infiltrates the base ahead of the Ghost team and assassinates the rogue agent prior to their arrival. Upon greeting Nomad, Fisher hacks into the Unidad servers in order to erase all traces of the sensitive information from Skell Technology while Nomad's team provides backup. While ex-filtrating from the base, Fisher reveals that the intelligence is data on sensitive research and development that could \"change the future of warfare\". Fisher has a debriefing with Bowman before deploying for his next mission to recover missing nuclear devices.\n\n====''Operation Archangel''====\nThe summer 2018 DLC, ''Operation Archangel'', features characters from ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege]]''. The team intercepts a distress signal outside the city of Frontera and find a crashed truck surrounded by piles of cash and several dead cartel members. The team reports the massacre to Bowman, who informs them that Rainbow operative [[Caveira (Rainbow Six Siege)|Taina \"Caveira\" Pereira]] has recently gone AWOL from Team Rainbow and is suspected of killing several Santa Blanca gang members. Bowman then introduces the team to fellow Rainbow operative Meghan J. \"Valkyrie\" Castellano, who requests the team's assistance in locating Caveira. Hoping to stop the rogue operative from potentially starting an international incident, Bowman and the team agree to help bring in Caveira. The team soon meet Rainbow operative and Caveira's girlfriend Emmanuelle \"Twitch\" Pichon, who requests the team bring her to the crash site. Their investigation leads them to a cartel outpost where they interrogate a Sanata Blanca lieutenant, who reveals that Caveira is after someone named Dengoso. Twitch briefly parts ways with before rendezvousing with them at Dengoso's apartment in the hopes of finding any hints as to why Caveira's after him. A message on Dengoso's answering machine reveals that he is Caveira's younger brother Jo\u00e3o, and an undercover officer for the Federal Police of Brazil. Sent by his superiors to infiltrate Santa Blanca, Dengoso's cover had recently been blown and he is now being held captive by the cartel at a chemical institute. With Caveira already on her way to Dengoso's location, Twitch and the team catch up to her at the front gates and agree to assist her in rescuing Dengoso from Santa Blanca. The rescue is a success, though tensions rise between Team Rainbow and the Ghosts when Bowman demands Dengoso's cooperation in sharing anything he knows about El Sueno and his operations in Bolivia. Despite Caveira's insistence on leaving immediately with Dengoso, the later agrees to cooperate with Bowman only with permission from his superiors. Nomad soon breaks the tension between both sides by allowing Dengoso to leave with Team Rainbow, much to Bowman's chagrin.\n\n====''Operation Silent Spade''====\nThe winter 2018 DLC, ''Operation Silent Spade'', released in December 2018 features characters from ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier]]''. Lieutenant Colonel Scott Mitchell, the team's commanding officer, temporarily reassigns them from Operation Kingslayer for an internal Ghost operation. Having found evidence of Russian Ultranationalist Forces working with Santa Blanca to mine deposits of weapons-grade uranium in Bolivia, Mitchell orders the team to rendezvous with the newest member of the Ghosts, John Kozak at a Unidad base to prevent the Russians from leaving Bolivia with the uranium. The mission is a success, but they soon discover that significant amounts of uranium are still unaccounted for. Nomad contacts Bowman, who leads them to a trainyard where the uranium was transported to. They learn that Santa Blanca plans to detonate a dirty bomb in Barvechos, a city that openly supports the rebels. With Kozak's help, the team attempts to disarm the bomb but is ultimately unable to, forcing them to drive it off a cliff into a mining area. With the bomb dealt with and the uranium accounted for, Mitchell and Kozak depart Bolivia.\n\n====''Operation Oracle''====\nUbisoft announced another update on April 30, 2019, known as \"Operation Oracle\" featuring [[Jon Bernthal]] as Major Cole D. Walker, a Ghost Recon operative who becomes the antagonist of ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint]]''. The update was released on May 2, 2019.<ref>https://mobile.twitter.com/GhostRecon/status/1123281223214931969</ref> Bowman gives Nomad's team a mission to infiltrate a Unidad facility in a railway tunnel on the Bolivian border. Upon entering the facility, the team find dead Unidad soldiers. Investigating further, they learn that the facility is being used to test drones reverse-engineered from classified Skell-Tech models that the Ghosts use. Nomad's team eventually encounter Cole D. Walker, a fellow Ghost, who has already infiltrated the facility and informs the team that a Skell-Tech engineer named Daniel Rodriguez Arellano has been selling classified information to Unidad and that Bowman is involved. They are attacked by Unidad soldiers and are forced to fight their way out of the facility. Though Walker insists Bowman cannot be trusted, Nomad persuades him to return Daniel to a safehouse to investigate Bowman's activities further. Upon dropping Daniel at the safehouse, Nomad and the team decide to tail Daniel. Eavesdropping on his phone calls, the team learn that Daniel is actually is a CIA asset that has been compromised and that Unidad is threatening his family. Walker soon sets up a meet at an airfield where he shows Nomad the bodies of his team, who were killed by drones Daniel gave to Unidad and that Bowman is responsible for their deaths. Walker and Nomad go to a meeting between Bowman and Daniel, but find Unidad have captured Bowman and detained Daniel. Nomad interrogates Daniel who reveals that he sold out Bowman to Unidad to protect his family and Walker executes him. They regroup and infiltrate a nearby Unidad base to rescue Bowman. Escorting her to a safehouse, she claims that Daniel was part of a long-running CIA operation and she was his handler, but never knew the full extent of the mission. Despite their conflicting views on how to handle the situation, Nomad ultimately persuades Walker to trust their judgment on Bowman, as she has never given him a reason to doubt her.\n\n==Development==\nThe development of ''Wildlands'' began in 2012,<ref name=\"Guardian gameplay\"/> and was revealed in the end of Ubisoft's [[E3 2015]] press conference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/ghost_recon_wildlands/news/ubisoft_announces_ghost_recon_wildlands_a_third-person_open-world_shooter_for_ps4_xbox_one_and_pc.html|title=Ubisoft announces Ghost Recon Wildlands, a third-person open-world shooter for PS4, Xbox One & PC|first=David|last=Scammell|work=VideoGamer.com|date=June 16, 2015|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}</ref> Ubisoft also claimed that ''Wildlands'' will feature the largest open-world environment the company has ever created.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-recon-open-world-game-revealed-at-e3-2015/1100-6428078/|title=Ghost Recon Open-World Game Revealed at E3 2015|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=June 15, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}</ref> In order to create a realistic Bolivian environment, the developers visited Bolivia for two weeks and asked for consultation from local Bolivians.<ref name=\"Guardian gameplay\"/> A modified version of the [[Anvil (game engine)|AnvilNext]] engine for supporting the large open world environments was used for the game.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/>\n\n== Controversy==\nIn March 2017, the Bolivian government expressed their dissatisfaction over the game's portrayal of their country as a violent [[narco-state]], and filed a formal complaint to the French embassy in [[La Paz]].

Like all ''Tom Clancy's'' games from Ubisoft, the game takes place in a modern universe inspired by reality, but the characters, locations and stories are all fantasies created solely for entertainment purposes. Bolivia was chosen as the background of this game based on its magnificent landscapes and rich culture.

In an attempt to fight off Santa Blanca\u2019s armed occupation in their country, the government of Bolivia establishes La Unidad, an elite special forces group tasked with fighting the Cartel. Both factions eventually establish a truce to prevent more bloodshed after months of brutal fighting, with of some Unidad\u2019s personnel secretly working for Santa Blanca. DEA Agent Ricky \u201cRicardo\u201d Sandoval is sent undercover in Santa Blanca in a joint operation with the CIA to gather intelligence on the Cartel, eventually working for El Sue\u00f1o himself. The United States is finally compelled to act when a bomb targets the US embassy in [[La Paz]] and Sandoval is executed by the cartel after his cover is blown.\n\n===Campaign===\n\nA Ghost Recon fireteam is deployed to Bolivia as part of Operation Kingslayer, a joint operation between the [[CIA]], [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]], and [[JSOC]].<ref name=\"Ubi\"/> The team consists of team leader and support gunner \"Nomad\", vehicle and assault specialist \"Midas\", hacker and tactical engineer \"Holt\", and sniper \"Weaver\". The Ghosts enter Bolivia with their CIA contact, Karen Bowman, who was also a close friend to Sandoval. They meet Pac Katari, leader of the Kataris 26, the only resistance against Santa Blanca. Pac Katari requests they rescue Amaru, whose ideologies inspired the Kataris 26, from Santa Blanca. The Ghosts are then free to tackle the cartel in any way and order they see fit.\n\nThe Ghosts dismantle the cartel piece by piece, targeting their four main operations by attacking cocaine production facilities and stockpiles, disrupting smuggling operations, discrediting the cartel in the eyes of corrupt politicians and supporters, and inciting conflict between the cartel's senior figures. The team are eventually contacted by El Sue\u00f1o, who lures them to a meeting. The Ghosts hesitantly agree, but do not find El Sue\u00f1o at the agreed location. El Sue\u00f1o instead contacts them via phone to bribe the Ghosts into working for him. The Ghosts refuse his offer and instead threaten him.\n\nWhile dismantling the cartel, the team finds and collects audio tapes of agent Sandoval's reports to Bowman of his time working undercover for El Sue\u00f1o. Sandoval's reports reveal that he had become deeply troubled by his mission, not only by the crimes he had committed to keep his cover but also by his superiors' reluctance to take action against the cartel. After recovering Sandoval's body from the cartel, Sueno contacts them again to offer them a tape of \u201cSandoval's confession\u201d. Upon listening to it, they are disturbed to learn that Sandoval was responsible for the embassy bombing and framed Santa Blanca for the crime so that the United States government would be forced intervene in Bolivia. Though Bowman and the team are angered by Sandoval's deception, they decide to continue with the mission as the cartel still poses a threat.\n\nAfter dismantling half of the cartel, Pac Katari claims his men have located El Sue\u00f1o, but the Ghosts grow suspicious when they instead find the body of Amaru. Unable to contact Bowman, they find her captured by the Katari 26 and Pac Katari breaks their alliance, claiming that the rebels must kill El Sue\u00f1o themselves to avoid being seen as puppets of the United States. The Ghosts rescue Bowman and race to El Sue\u00f1o's mausoleum to capture him before Pac Katari kills him. After fighting their way through both rebel and cartel opposition, the Ghosts and Bowman surround El Sue\u00f1o, who has beheaded Katari. Despite his surrendering, Bowman receives a call from her superiors, informing that El Sue\u00f1o had made a deal with the Department of Justice to give up the heads of other drug cartels in exchange for immunity.\n\nHow the story ends depends on whether the Ghosts fully dismantled the cartel. If remnants of the cartel remain, Bowman will execute El Sue\u00f1o, leading to her dismissal from the CIA and her arrest for murdering El Sue\u00f1o. She expresses no regrets in doing so, fearing that El Sue\u00f1o would become a dictator with the United States' backing. If the Ghosts have fully dismantled the cartel, Bowman takes El Sue\u00f1o into protective custody. El Sue\u00f1o provides further intelligence on other drug cartels, terrorist groups, and arms smugglers. Bowman predicts that when the intelligence runs out, El Sue\u00f1o will either be extradited by Mexico or cut loose and start a new drug cartel, starting the cycle over again. She and the Ghosts resolve to prepare themselves for the next fight.\n\n===Downloadable Content===\nShortly after the game's release, Ubisoft announced plans to release two episodes of [[downloadable content]], each with their own narrative set in Bolivia.\n\n====''Narco Road''====\n\nThis episode sees the player take on the role of an unnamed Ghost sent undercover into Bolivia by the CIA to identify \"El Invisible\", the elusive head of Santa Blanca's smuggling network. The Ghost poses as a mercenary for hire and befriends the leaders of the gangs carrying out smuggling operations. Each gang leader provides clues to El Invisible's identity before the Ghost assassinates them. Eventually the Ghost's notoriety grows to the point where El Invisible recruits them into Santa Blanca, erasing the Ghost's identity and staging their death. However, El Invisible is aware that the Ghost is a CIA agent and has them imprisoned. The Ghost escapes and with the help of an informant using the alias Se\u00f1or Sonrisa, recovers the handheld device El Invisible uses to run Santa Blanca's smuggling network anonymously and seemingly kills El Invisible. When the device is decrypted, it unleashes a virus that compromises the CIA. The Ghost deduces that Sonrisa is El Invisible, and that he orchestrated the operation to escape Santa Blanca, attack the CIA and disappear for good. Unable to explain Sonrisa's motive for attacking them, the CIA spend the next two years tracking him. He is eventually found in Arizona and the Ghost is assigned a mission to kill him.\n\n====''Fallen Ghosts''====\n\nThe second episode follows the Ghost Recon fireteam on their return to Bolivia. The cocaine trade has collapsed in the aftermath of Operation Kingslayer and with Pac Katari's death, the Kataris 26 have descended into in-fighting. In a bid to restore order, the Bolivian government has tried to rebuild the tactical police unit Unidad with special forces from across Latin America. Now known as \"Los Extranjeros\", these remnants of Unidad prove to be corrupt and seize control of cocaine production. When a data breach in the CIA compromises the identities of every active agent in Bolivia, the Ghosts return to extract the compromised agents. Their mission goes awry when their helicopter is shot down moments after they enter Bolivian airspace. They regroup and rescue a CIA field officer code-named Socrates. As Los Extranjeros are better-armed, trained and organised than Unidad, extracting the compromised agents proves impossible. Socrates instead proposes that the Ghosts target Los Extranjeros' commanders and rebuild the Kataris 26. Their actions prompt Los Extranjeros' commanding officer, Colonel Merlo, to personally take charge of the remaining forces. When Merlo is killed, Los Extranjeros tears itself apart, and evidence of their crimes causes a political scandal that upends the Bolivian government. The Ghosts and Socrates depart, questioning whether this will be enough to change the course of Bolivia's future.\n\n===Special Operations===\n\nAs part of the ongoing effort to support the game, Ubisoft has also released short-term Special Operations DLC.\n\n====Predator====\n\nThe first pack, released in December 2017, features a mission to hunt the [[Predator (alien)|Predator]]. In the expansion, the team investigate several brutal killings in the forested areas of Bolivia, finding several skinned corpses and a crashed alien vessel until encountering the deadly Predator. After a lengthy battle, the team manage to defeat the Predator before it activates its self destruct, killing itself in a massive explosion. The squad debate informing Bowman of the encounter, but ultimately choose to keep it to themselves.\n\n====''Operation Watchman''====\nThe next pack, ''Operation Watchman'', features a tie-in with ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell]]'', with actor [[Michael Ironside]] reprising the role of Sam Fisher. Fisher is deployed to Bolivia in order to recover sensitive intelligence data from a rogue CIA officer. Fisher has Fourth Echelon contact Bowman and borrow the Ghost team to assist in his mission. Fisher's deployment takes him to a Unidad base in La Cruz, where he infiltrates the base ahead of the Ghost team and assassinates the rogue agent prior to their arrival. Upon greeting Nomad, Fisher hacks into the Unidad servers in order to erase all traces of the sensitive information from Skell Technology while Nomad's team provides backup. While ex-filtrating from the base, Fisher reveals that the intelligence is data on sensitive research and development that could \"change the future of warfare\". Fisher has a debriefing with Bowman before deploying for his next mission to recover missing nuclear devices.\n\n====''Operation Archangel''====\nThe summer 2018 DLC, ''Operation Archangel'', features characters from ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege]]''. The team intercepts a distress signal outside the city of Frontera and find a crashed truck surrounded by piles of cash and several dead cartel members. The team reports the massacre to Bowman, who informs them that Rainbow operative [[Caveira (Rainbow Six Siege)|Taina \"Caveira\" Pereira]] has recently gone AWOL from Team Rainbow and is suspected of killing several Santa Blanca gang members. Bowman then introduces the team to fellow Rainbow operative Meghan J. \"Valkyrie\" Castellano, who requests the team's assistance in locating Caveira. Hoping to stop the rogue operative from potentially starting an international incident, Bowman and the team agree to help bring in Caveira. The team soon meet Rainbow operative and Caveira's girlfriend Emmanuelle \"Twitch\" Pichon, who requests the team bring her to the crash site. Their investigation leads them to a cartel outpost where they interrogate a Sanata Blanca lieutenant, who reveals that Caveira is after someone named Dengoso. Twitch briefly parts ways with before rendezvousing with them at Dengoso's apartment in the hopes of finding any hints as to why Caveira's after him. A message on Dengoso's answering machine reveals that he is Caveira's younger brother Jo\u00e3o, and an undercover officer for the Federal Police of Brazil. Sent by his superiors to infiltrate Santa Blanca, Dengoso's cover had recently been blown and he is now being held captive by the cartel at a chemical institute. With Caveira already on her way to Dengoso's location, Twitch and the team catch up to her at the front gates and agree to assist her in rescuing Dengoso from Santa Blanca. The rescue is a success, though tensions rise between Team Rainbow and the Ghosts when Bowman demands Dengoso's cooperation in sharing anything he knows about El Sueno and his operations in Bolivia. Despite Caveira's insistence on leaving immediately with Dengoso, the later agrees to cooperate with Bowman only with permission from his superiors. Nomad soon breaks the tension between both sides by allowing Dengoso to leave with Team Rainbow, much to Bowman's chagrin.\n\n====''Operation Silent Spade''====\nThe winter 2018 DLC, ''Operation Silent Spade'', released in December 2018 features characters from ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier]]''. Lieutenant Colonel Scott Mitchell, the team's commanding officer, temporarily reassigns them from Operation Kingslayer for an internal Ghost operation. Having found evidence of Russian Ultranationalist Forces working with Santa Blanca to mine deposits of weapons-grade uranium in Bolivia, Mitchell orders the team to rendezvous with the newest member of the Ghosts, John Kozak at a Unidad base to prevent the Russians from leaving Bolivia with the uranium. The mission is a success, but they soon discover that significant amounts of uranium are still unaccounted for. Nomad contacts Bowman, who leads them to a trainyard where the uranium was transported to. They learn that Santa Blanca plans to detonate a dirty bomb in Barvechos, a city that openly supports the rebels. With Kozak's help, the team attempts to disarm the bomb but is ultimately unable to, forcing them to drive it off a cliff into a mining area. With the bomb dealt with and the uranium accounted for, Mitchell and Kozak depart Bolivia.\n\n====''Operation Oracle''====\nUbisoft announced another update on April 30, 2019, known as \"Operation Oracle\" featuring [[Jon Bernthal]] as Major Cole D. Walker, a Ghost Recon operative who becomes the antagonist of ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint]]''. The update was released on May 2, 2019.<ref>https://mobile.twitter.com/GhostRecon/status/1123281223214931969</ref> Bowman gives Nomad's team a mission to infiltrate a Unidad facility in a railway tunnel on the Bolivian border. Upon entering the facility, the team find dead Unidad soldiers. Investigating further, they learn that the facility is being used to test drones reverse-engineered from classified Skell-Tech models that the Ghosts use. Nomad's team eventually encounter Cole D. Walker, a fellow Ghost, who has already infiltrated the facility and informs the team that a Skell-Tech engineer named Daniel Rodriguez Arellano has been selling classified information to Unidad and that Bowman is involved. They are attacked by Unidad soldiers and are forced to fight their way out of the facility. Though Walker insists Bowman cannot be trusted, Nomad persuades him to return Daniel to a safehouse to investigate Bowman's activities further. Upon dropping Daniel at the safehouse, Nomad and the team decide to tail Daniel. Eavesdropping on his phone calls, the team learn that Daniel is actually is a CIA asset that has been compromised and that Unidad is threatening his family. Walker soon sets up a meet at an airfield where he shows Nomad the bodies of his team, who were killed by drones Daniel gave to Unidad and that Bowman is responsible for their deaths. Walker and Nomad go to a meeting between Bowman and Daniel, but find Unidad have captured Bowman and detained Daniel. Nomad interrogates Daniel who reveals that he sold out Bowman to Unidad to protect his family and Walker executes him. They regroup and infiltrate a nearby Unidad base to rescue Bowman. Escorting her to a safehouse, she claims that Daniel was part of a long-running CIA operation and she was his handler, but never knew the full extent of the mission. Despite their conflicting views on how to handle the situation, Nomad ultimately persuades Walker to trust their judgment on Bowman, as she has never given him a reason to doubt her.\n\n==Development==\nThe development of ''Wildlands'' began in 2012,<ref name=\"Guardian gameplay\"/> and was revealed in the end of Ubisoft's [[E3 2015]] press conference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/ghost_recon_wildlands/news/ubisoft_announces_ghost_recon_wildlands_a_third-person_open-world_shooter_for_ps4_xbox_one_and_pc.html|title=Ubisoft announces Ghost Recon Wildlands, a third-person open-world shooter for PS4, Xbox One & PC|first=David|last=Scammell|work=VideoGamer.com|date=June 16, 2015|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}</ref> Ubisoft also claimed that ''Wildlands'' will feature the largest open-world environment the company has ever created.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-recon-open-world-game-revealed-at-e3-2015/1100-6428078/|title=Ghost Recon Open-World Game Revealed at E3 2015|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=June 15, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}</ref> In order to create a realistic Bolivian environment, the developers visited Bolivia for two weeks and asked for consultation from local Bolivians.<ref name=\"Guardian gameplay\"/> A modified version of the [[Anvil (game engine)|AnvilNext]] engine for supporting the large open world environments was used for the game.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/>\n\n== Controversy==\nIn March 2017, the Bolivian government expressed their dissatisfaction over the game's portrayal of their country as a violent [[narco-state]], and filed a formal complaint to the French embassy in [[La Paz]]. Bolivia's Interior Minister [[Carlos Romero (Bolivian politician)|Carlos Romero]] stated that the country has the standing to take legal action.\n\nUbisoft responded with the following statement; \"''Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands'' is a work of fiction, similar to movies or TV shows. Like all ''Tom Clancy's'' games from Ubisoft, the game takes place in a modern universe inspired by reality, but the characters, locations and stories are all fantasies created solely for entertainment purposes. Bolivia was chosen as the background of this game based on its magnificent landscapes and rich culture. While the game's premise imagines a different reality than the one that exists in Bolivia today, we do hope that the in-game world comes close to representing the country's beautiful topography, and that players enjoy exploring the diverse and open landscapes it moved us to create.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/bolivia-files-a-formal-complaint-with-france-over-ghost-recon-wildlands|title=Bolivia files a formal complaint with France over Ghost Recon Wildlands|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/03/bolivia-files-formal-complaint-to-france-over-ghost-recon-wildlands|title=Bolivia Files Formal Complaint to France Over Ghost Recon Wildlands|first=Luke|last=Reilly|date=2 March 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/03/new-ghost-recon-causes-actual-diplomatic-incident/|title=New Ghost Recon Causes Actual Diplomatic Incident|first=Luke|last=Plunkett|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Related media==\nUbisoft released a 30-minute short film titled ''Ghost Recon Wildlands: War Within the Cartel'' on February 16, 2017 on their Twitch channel and later on Amazon Prime.

The waltzes are a collection of love songs in [[L\u00e4ndler]] style for voices and [[piano four hands]].  The lyrics for the ''Liebeslieder'' come from [[Georg Friedrich Daumer]]'s ''Polydora'', a collection of folk songs and love poems.  While there is no concrete record indicating the exact inspiration for the Waltzes, there is speculation that Brahms' motivation for the songs was his frustrated love for pianist [[Clara Schumann]], composer Robert Schumann's wife.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Background==\n===External influences===\nThe discussion of influence as it pertains to Brahms and the Liebeslieder Walzer Op.&nbsp;52 refers to the inspiration that a composer draws from an admired predecessor, which was commonplace among writers, artists, and composers of the 19th century.<ref name=\":2\">Rosen, Charles. \"Influence: Plagiarism And Inspiration.\" 19th-century music 4.2 (1980): 87\u2013100. Print.\n</ref> To contextualize influence, many relevant theorists will cite [[Harold Bloom]], author of ''[[The Anxiety of Influence]]''. According to Hussey, Bloom asserts, \"all poets must deal with the anxiety that they feel toward their most admired predecessors. The predecessor, whose work inspired the later poet to pursue literary composition, is now the object of both envy and admiration from the later poet, who fears the precursor has left nothing else to be said\".<ref name=\":1\">Hussey, William Gregory. Compositional Modeling, Quotation, and Multiple Influence Analysis in the Works of Johannes Brahms: An Application of Harold Bloom's Theory of Influence to Music. Ph.D. diss. University of Texas at Austin, 1997.</ref> In other words, composers feel a more urgent need to create original work that equals the merit of those of the preceding tradition. Rosen refers to Brahms as a \"master of allusion\" to other composers, further arguing that one cannot begin to understand Brahms's work without an awareness of the contributing influences, which were a \"necessary fact of creative life\" for the composer.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOne composer in particular who influenced Brahms, specifically within the Liebeslieder Walzer Op.&nbsp;52 was [[Franz Schubert]]. Brahms's admiration of Schubert becomes apparent when looking at early performances of Schubert's pieces and the tendency to study, at length, the composer's works.<ref name=\":1\" /> According to Brodbeck, Schubert influenced Brahms's Liebeslieder Walzer Op.&nbsp;52 through similarities to the [[Twenty L\u00e4ndler]]. First, Brahms sought to have his waltzes performed in informal musical evening settings similar to those intended for Schubert's dances.<ref name=\":3\">Brodbeck, David Lee. Brahms as Editor and Composer: His Two Editions of L\u00e4ndler by Schubert and His First Two Cycles of Waltzes, Opera 39 and 52. Ph.D. diss. University of Pennsylvania, 1984.</ref> Another reference to Schubert is the \"Im l\u00e4ndler tempo\" marking in Op.&nbsp;52, alluding to the Twenty L\u00e4ndler directly.<ref name=\":3\" /> Furthermore, the date of composition of the Liebeslieder Walzer's composition suggests that Brahms had completed the editing of the Twenty L\u00e4ndler before starting his work on his own waltzes.<ref name=\":3\" /> Also, a specific request by Brahms to have each of his movements copied onto a separate sheet of paper demonstrates, to an extent, his uncertainty of how to order such seemingly unrelated pieces. This suggestion reflects a struggle similar to that which he faced in establishing an order for Schubert's dances.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nBrahms's experience in editing Schubert's Twenty L\u00e4ndler is important in understanding the ideas of influence relevant to 19th century composers. This experience was merely editorial, as Brahms used his own \"compositional and aesthetic preferences\" to organize pieces that \"Schubert never intended to be performed together\" into a coherent order.<ref name=\":3\" /> Due to the initial, unrelated nature of these dances, Brahms was able to extend the work of an admired predecessor by, in a sense, making original work out of those pieces which already existed, therefore reverting the direction of influence from successor back to predecessor. However, as Brahms shifts from editor of the Twenty L\u00e4ndler  to composer of the Liebeslieder Walzer Op.&nbsp;52, he replicates his editorial behavior by composing eighteen movements that seemed to function autonomously. Brahms ordered them into a whole piece that is a sum of what were, initially, unrelated parts. This behavior, as it relates to the Twenty L\u00e4ndler and the Liebeslieder Walzer Op.&nbsp;52, allows Brahms to give what theorist Bloom would believe to be \"deeper meaning\" to his editorial and compositional work through establishing a clear, influential relationship between the two works through their similarity.<ref name=\":1\" /> In addition, this accomplishes the challenges of originality and creativity that composers faced from their talented predecessors, relieving Bloom's so-called \"anxiety of influence\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Overall, external influence from the Twenty L\u00e4ndler not only shaped the Liebeslieder Walzer from a compositional perspective, but also added a sense of depth, significance, and credibility to Brahms's repertoire.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Historical===\nIn his lifetime, Brahms was well respected, which is particularly due to his works composed between 1863 and 1871, or his \"unsettled years,\" before he established his residence in Vienna.<ref name=\":0\">Avins, Styra. \"Brahms, Johannes.\" The Oxford Companion to Music: Oxford University Press.

The waltzes are a collection of love songs in [[L\u00e4ndler]] style for voices and [[piano four hands]].  The lyrics for the ''Liebeslieder'' come from [[Georg Friedrich Daumer]]'s ''Polydora'', a collection of folk songs and love poems.  While there is no concrete record indicating the exact inspiration for the Waltzes, there is speculation that Brahms' motivation for the songs was his frustrated love for pianist [[Clara Schumann]], composer Robert Schumann's wife.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Background==\n===External influences===\nThe discussion of influence as it pertains to Brahms and the Liebeslieder Walzer Op.&nbsp;52 refers to the inspiration that a composer draws from an admired predecessor, which was commonplace among writers, artists, and composers of the 19th century.<ref name=\":2\">Rosen, Charles. \"Influence: Plagiarism And Inspiration.\" 19th-century music 4.2 (1980): 87\u2013100. Print.\n</ref> To contextualize influence, many relevant theorists will cite [[Harold Bloom]], author of ''[[The Anxiety of Influence]]''. According to Hussey, Bloom asserts, \"all poets must deal with the anxiety that they feel toward their most admired predecessors. The predecessor, whose work inspired the later poet to pursue literary composition, is now the object of both envy and admiration from the later poet, who fears the precursor has left nothing else to be said\".<ref name=\":1\">Hussey, William Gregory. Compositional Modeling, Quotation, and Multiple Influence Analysis in the Works of Johannes Brahms: An Application of Harold Bloom's Theory of Influence to Music. Ph.D. diss. University of Texas at Austin, 1997.</ref> In other words, composers feel a more urgent need to create original work that equals the merit of those of the preceding tradition. Rosen refers to Brahms as a \"master of allusion\" to other composers, further arguing that one cannot begin to understand Brahms's work without an awareness of the contributing influences, which were a \"necessary fact of creative life\" for the composer.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOne composer in particular who influenced Brahms, specifically within the Liebeslieder Walzer Op.&nbsp;52 was [[Franz Schubert]]. Brahms's admiration of Schubert becomes apparent when looking at early performances of Schubert's pieces and the tendency to study, at length, the composer's works.<ref name=\":1\" /> According to Brodbeck, Schubert influenced Brahms's Liebeslieder Walzer Op.&nbsp;52 through similarities to the [[Twenty L\u00e4ndler]]. First, Brahms sought to have his waltzes performed in informal musical evening settings similar to those intended for Schubert's dances.<ref name=\":3\">Brodbeck, David Lee. Brahms as Editor and Composer: His Two Editions of L\u00e4ndler by Schubert and His First Two Cycles of Waltzes, Opera 39 and 52. Ph.D. diss. University of Pennsylvania, 1984.</ref> Another reference to Schubert is the \"Im l\u00e4ndler tempo\" marking in Op.&nbsp;52, alluding to the Twenty L\u00e4ndler directly.<ref name=\":3\" /> Furthermore, the date of composition of the Liebeslieder Walzer's composition suggests that Brahms had completed the editing of the Twenty L\u00e4ndler before starting his work on his own waltzes.<ref name=\":3\" /> Also, a specific request by Brahms to have each of his movements copied onto a separate sheet of paper demonstrates, to an extent, his uncertainty of how to order such seemingly unrelated pieces. This suggestion reflects a struggle similar to that which he faced in establishing an order for Schubert's dances.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nBrahms's experience in editing Schubert's Twenty L\u00e4ndler is important in understanding the ideas of influence relevant to 19th century composers. This experience was merely editorial, as Brahms used his own \"compositional and aesthetic preferences\" to organize pieces that \"Schubert never intended to be performed together\" into a coherent order.<ref name=\":3\" /> Due to the initial, unrelated nature of these dances, Brahms was able to extend the work of an admired predecessor by, in a sense, making original work out of those pieces which already existed, therefore reverting the direction of influence from successor back to predecessor. However, as Brahms shifts from editor of the Twenty L\u00e4ndler  to composer of the Liebeslieder Walzer Op.&nbsp;52, he replicates his editorial behavior by composing eighteen movements that seemed to function autonomously. Brahms ordered them into a whole piece that is a sum of what were, initially, unrelated parts. This behavior, as it relates to the Twenty L\u00e4ndler and the Liebeslieder Walzer Op.&nbsp;52, allows Brahms to give what theorist Bloom would believe to be \"deeper meaning\" to his editorial and compositional work through establishing a clear, influential relationship between the two works through their similarity.<ref name=\":1\" /> In addition, this accomplishes the challenges of originality and creativity that composers faced from their talented predecessors, relieving Bloom's so-called \"anxiety of influence\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Overall, external influence from the Twenty L\u00e4ndler not only shaped the Liebeslieder Walzer from a compositional perspective, but also added a sense of depth, significance, and credibility to Brahms's repertoire.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Historical===\nIn his lifetime, Brahms was well respected, which is particularly due to his works composed between 1863 and 1871, or his \"unsettled years,\" before he established his residence in Vienna.<ref name=\":0\">Avins, Styra. \"Brahms, Johannes.\" The Oxford Companion to Music: Oxford University Press.

Opus 52a, for piano duet without voices was published in 1874, with minor additions and intricacies added to the original piano lines.<ref name=\"stark\"/> Brahms also published a version for voices with piano solo in 1875.<ref name=\"stark\"/> Conductor [[Ernst Rudorff]] convinced Brahms to create an arrangement of the waltzes for voice and small orchestra for a performance in 1870, although this version was not published until 1938.<ref name=\"stark\"/> The orchestral version does not contain the complete set of waltzes, but instead numbers 1, 2, 4, 6, 5, a song that would later become waltz 9 in his [[Neue Liebeslieder|Neue Liebeslieder Waltze]]<nowiki/>s, 11, 8, and 9.<ref name=\"stark\"/> Friedrich Hermann also created a transcription of the Liebeslieder Waltzes for strings alone in 1889.<ref>Godell, Tom.\"Dances from the heart of Europe.\" American Record Guide 67.1 (Jan/Feb 2004): 196\u2013197.</ref> In 2019, the Liebeslieder Waltzes, op. 52, received a new orchestration of the 4-hand accompaniment.  This version is for choir and 10 instrumentalists.  Composed by J. A. Kawarsky, it is published by GIA press.\n\nRef. Bibl. Marina Caracciolo, \"Brahms e il Walzer. Storia e lettura critica\".

The station, which opened in May 1865, was a stop on the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) line between [[Llangollen]] and [[Corwen]]. It was closed by [[British Rail]] in January 1965.\n\nIn 1986 the station was reopened as part of the heritage [[Llangollen Railway]]. It is now reportedly one of the best 10 stations to visit in Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/oct/01/10-of-the-best-railway-stations-in-britain-uk-simon-jenkins|title=10 of the best railway stations in Britain |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Llangollen to Corwen railway was opened in 1865. The route was constructed by [[Thomas Brassey]] under the direction of the prolific Scottish engineer, [[Henry Robertson]].\nBerwyn was the first stop for westbound trains after Llangollen. Although today's station is located within a wooded gorge with only few houses and a riverside hotel nearby, it was at the centre of a vibrant community including a post office and Methodist chapel in the Victorian period. However, it was the local gentry who were the main reason for the station\u2019s existence. The chairman of the [[Llangollen and Corwen Railway]] lived just up the road at Plas Berwyn and an 1861 agreement announced:\n\n:''A station to be called The Berwyn Station shall be built in ornamental style and contain a first class waiting room in addition to the general waiting room. All passenger trains shall stop at Berwyn if and when required by the owner or occupier of, or visitors to, Plas Berwyn mansion.''\n\nBerwyn station was built with a single right-handed curved [[side platform]], station master's house, waiting room and booking office. As the station was too remote to be supplied by [[coal gas]], its interiors were decorated with elaborate oil and paraffin lamps. \n\nAs milk was an important part of the local economy, it was regularly put on to trains at Berwyn. Local farms would bring milk to the station in tall, heavy conical metal [[Milk churn|churns]] (generally with a capacity of {{convert|17|impgal|abbr=on}}). Two side handles allowed two men to lift the churns into a [[goods van]]. They could be rolled along on their bottom rims by one man, making a distinctive rattling noise. Milk churns would arrive at Berwyn every day from the nearby farms at [[Llantysilio]] for transport to the creamery at [[Corwen]]. \n\nBerwyn originally had a relatively short platform but with an increase in summer services in the early [[Edwardian period]], the platform was extended across the viaduct with timber decking on wrought iron frames. This unusual cantilevered platform at the western end of the station was dismantled in the late 1950s due to its deterioration and a lack of passengers. \n\nDuring the [[First World War]], local teenage conscripts wrote their names and messages in indelible pencil on the wall of a pedestrian tunnel beneath Berwyn station in 1915. They did this shortly before boarding trains that would take them to their battalions. In 2007, research was undertaken to find out who they were. At least one young man is known to have died on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], and his name is now on the Llangollen War memorial.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/6269586.stm|title=WWI tunnel 'messages' exhibition |publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=4 July 2007}}</ref> Work is now underway to protect the surviving messages from water damage.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-45163110|title=WW1 soldiers' farewell notes on Llangollen bridge being lost to damp|date=   13 August 2018|publisher=BBC NEWS}}</ref>\n[[File:Berwyn railway station 1863370 cbdae269.jpg|thumb|left|Berwyn station on the abandoned [[Ruabon\u2013Barmouth line]] in September 1967]]\nBy the 1950s, the waiting room and booking office had both been closed as Berwyn had become an unstaffed halt. The final scheduled passenger service between Llangollen and {{rws|Bala Junction}} ran on 12 December 1964. Goods traffic continued on the eastbound section of line between {{rws|Ruabon}} to Llangollen goods yard until 1968. After closure, the whole line was lifted. In the early 1970s, the Langollen Railway Society was formed with the intention of reopening part of the line as a heritage railway. \n\nBy the 1980s, the newly relaid heritage line approached the former GWR station. Restoration work then began on the station dilapidated buildings. The first passenger train from Llangollen to return to Berwyn was a [[Diesel multiple unit|DMU]] on 19 October 1985. Steam hauled services began operating to Berwyn in December the same year. The station received a full passenger service in March 1986, with a formal opening ceremony being performed by the [[Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster|Duke of Westminster]] on 13 June 1986. As the station had become the western terminus of the new line, a run-round loop was installed just past the station.\n\nAlmost twenty years later, the Llangollen Railway decided to restore the platform at Berwyn to its original extended length across the viaduct at the western of the station. The work, which cost \u00a3353,000, was completed in March 2004. The platform restoration received a civil engineering award from the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]].\n\n==Preservation==\n[[File:Berwyn Porter.jpg|thumb|The volunteer station staff in heritage clothing]]\n=== Booking office ===\nThe term booking office \u2013 still used today \u2013 is adopted from the old coaching practice of issuing tickets from a book. Originally these tickets on the early railways were handwritten and the process was very laborious. In 1837 a [[station master]] and trained cabinet maker named [[Thomas Edmondson]] introduced the Edmondson railway ticket. These pre-printed tickets were all individually numbered and date-stamped by a machine upon issue.  Special souvenir Edmondson tickets are still issued to passengers from Berwyn's booking office in the traditional way.\n\n=== Waiting room ===\nThe station's tea room is located within the former first class [[waiting room]]. During the Victorian period, the station boasted a separate waiting room for men and women travelling first class, with comfortable seats and a fire in winter. Those in the general waiting room had bench seats.\n\n=== Station master's house ===\n[[File:Berwyn Victorian Weekend.jpg|thumb|Victorian re-enactors inside the station's waiting room during the Llangollen Railway's Victorian Weekend]]\nFrom 1865 until the mid-1950s, the station master was the key authority figure at Berwyn railway station, well-respected with significant local social standing. He sold tickets, handled parcels, tended to the station\u2019s coal fires and ensured passengers were safe. In his spare time, the station master also looked after the station\u2019s floral and vegetable gardens.\n\nThe station master's house is the mock-Tudor part of the Berwyn station building. Although the house came with the job, the station master had to pay rent to the GWR; in 1924 this cost 7 shillings and sixpence a week. The house has been restored and is now available to rent as a self-catered holiday cottage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://llangollen-railway.co.uk/holiday-let/|title=Holiday Let - Llangollen Railway|website=llangollen-railway.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-05}}</ref>\n\n===Platform===\nThe platform has been extended back to its original length. This means that Berwyn can now accommodate 5-coach trains. However, due to the curve of the platform, a \u201cRight Away\u201d indicator has been installed at the western end of the station to enable a train guard to safely manage the train. \n\n== Locale ==\n=== Chain bridge ===\n[[File:(Chain Bridge Hotel, Berwyn Valley, Llangollen, Wales) (LOC) (3751632199).jpg|thumb|The second Chain Bridge across the River Dee]]\nAt the time of the railway's opening in 1865, the only way of crossing the River Dee at Berwyn was by using a [[chain bridge]]. There have been three such bridges. The first was built by mine owner Exuperius Pickering who needed to get his coal across the river to deliver it to [[Corwen]] and [[Bala, Gwynedd|Bala]]. Permission for the bridge was granted in 1814 and it opened in 1817 or very soon afterwards.\n\nIn the 1870s, a replacement bridge was built by [[Henry Robertson]] (the railway's engineer) and this lasted until February 1928, when an exceptionally heavy flood washed it away. The surviving [[Chain Bridge (Berwyn)|Chain Bridge]] was built in the summer of 1929, with six metal chains supporting the bridge deck from above and two chains supporting from below.\n\nThe bridge links two communities and is jointly owned by Llangollen Town Council and Llantysilio Community Council. A pathway from Berwyn station leads under a subway and down to the bridge and to the Chainbridge Hotel on the other side.

The station, which opened in May 1865, was a stop on the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) line between [[Llangollen]] and [[Corwen]]. It was closed by [[British Rail]] in January 1965.\n\nIn 1986 the station was reopened as part of the heritage [[Llangollen Railway]]. It is now reportedly among one of the best 10 stations to visit in Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/oct/01/10-of-the-best-railway-stations-in-britain-uk-simon-jenkins|title=10 of the best railway stations in Britain |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Llangollen to Corwen railway was opened in 1865. The route was constructed by [[Thomas Brassey]] under the direction of the prolific Scottish engineer, [[Henry Robertson]].\nBerwyn was the first stop for westbound trains after Llangollen. Although today's station is located within a wooded gorge with only few houses and a riverside hotel nearby, it was at the centre of a vibrant community including a post office and Methodist chapel in the Victorian period. However, it was the local gentry who were the main reason for the station\u2019s existence. The chairman of the [[Llangollen and Corwen Railway]] lived just up the road at Plas Berwyn and an 1861 agreement announced:\n\n:''A station to be called The Berwyn Station shall be built in ornamental style and contain a first class waiting room in addition to the general waiting room. All passenger trains shall stop at Berwyn if and when required by the owner or occupier of, or visitors to, Plas Berwyn mansion.''\n\nBerwyn station was built with a single right-handed curved [[side platform]], station master's house, waiting room and booking office. As the station was too remote to be supplied by [[coal gas]], its interiors were decorated with elaborate oil and paraffin lamps. \n\nAs milk was an important part of the local economy, it was regularly put on to trains at Berwyn. Local farms would bring milk to the station in tall, heavy conical metal [[Milk churn|churns]] (generally with a capacity of {{convert|17|impgal|abbr=on}}). Two side handles allowed two men to lift the churns into a [[goods van]]. They could be rolled along on their bottom rims by one man, making a distinctive rattling noise. Milk churns would arrive at Berwyn every day from the nearby farms at [[Llantysilio]] for transport to the creamery at [[Corwen]]. \n\nBerwyn originally had a relatively short platform but with an increase in summer services in the early [[Edwardian period]], the platform was extended across the viaduct with timber decking on wrought iron frames. This unusual cantilevered platform at the western end of the station was dismantled in the late 1950s due to its deterioration and a lack of passengers. \n\nDuring the [[First World War]], local teenage conscripts wrote their names and messages in indelible pencil on the wall of a pedestrian tunnel beneath Berwyn station in 1915. They did this shortly before boarding trains that would take them to their battalions. In 2007, research was undertaken to find out who they were. At least one young man is known to have died on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], and his name is now on the Llangollen War memorial.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/6269586.stm|title=WWI tunnel 'messages' exhibition |publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=4 July 2007}}</ref> Work is now underway to protect the surviving messages from water damage.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-45163110|title=WW1 soldiers' farewell notes on Llangollen bridge being lost to damp|date=   13 August 2018|publisher=BBC NEWS}}</ref>\n[[File:Berwyn railway station 1863370 cbdae269.jpg|thumb|left|Berwyn station on the abandoned [[Ruabon\u2013Barmouth line]] in September 1967]]\nBy the 1950s, the waiting room and booking office had both been closed as Berwyn had become an unstaffed halt. The final scheduled passenger service between Llangollen and {{rws|Bala Junction}} ran on 12 December 1964. Goods traffic continued on the eastbound section of line between {{rws|Ruabon}} to Llangollen goods yard until 1968. After closure, the whole line was lifted. In the early 1970s, the Langollen Railway Society was formed with the intention of reopening part of the line as a heritage railway. \n\nBy the 1980s, the newly relaid heritage line approached the former GWR station. Restoration work then began on the station dilapidated buildings. The first passenger train from Llangollen to return to Berwyn was a [[Diesel multiple unit|DMU]] on 19 October 1985. Steam hauled services began operating to Berwyn in December the same year. The station received a full passenger service in March 1986, with a formal opening ceremony being performed by the [[Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster|Duke of Westminster]] on 13 June 1986. As the station had become the western terminus of the new line, a run-round loop was installed just past the station.\n\nAlmost twenty years later, the Llangollen Railway decided to restore the platform at Berwyn to its original extended length across the viaduct at the western of the station. The work, which cost \u00a3353,000, was completed in March 2004. The platform restoration received a civil engineering award from the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]].\n\n==Preservation==\n[[File:Berwyn Porter.jpg|thumb|The volunteer station staff in heritage clothing]]\n=== Booking office ===\nThe term booking office \u2013 still used today \u2013 is adopted from the old coaching practice of issuing tickets from a book. Originally these tickets on the early railways were handwritten and the process was very laborious. In 1837 a [[station master]] and trained cabinet maker named [[Thomas Edmondson]] introduced the Edmondson railway ticket. These pre-printed tickets were all individually numbered and date-stamped by a machine upon issue.  Special souvenir Edmondson tickets are still issued to passengers from Berwyn's booking office in the traditional way.\n\n=== Waiting room ===\nThe station's tea room is located within the former first class [[waiting room]]. During the Victorian period, the station boasted a separate waiting room for men and women travelling first class, with comfortable seats and a fire in winter. Those in the general waiting room had bench seats.\n\n=== Station master's house ===\n[[File:Berwyn Victorian Weekend.jpg|thumb|Victorian re-enactors inside the station's waiting room during the Llangollen Railway's Victorian Weekend]]\nFrom 1865 until the mid-1950s, the station master was the key authority figure at Berwyn railway station, well-respected with significant local social standing. He sold tickets, handled parcels, tended to the station\u2019s coal fires and ensured passengers were safe. In his spare time, the station master also looked after the station\u2019s floral and vegetable gardens.\n\nThe station master's house is the mock-Tudor part of the Berwyn station building. Although the house came with the job, the station master had to pay rent to the GWR; in 1924 this cost 7 shillings and sixpence a week. The house has been restored and is now available to rent as a self-catered holiday cottage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://llangollen-railway.co.uk/holiday-let/|title=Holiday Let - Llangollen Railway|website=llangollen-railway.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-05}}</ref>\n\n===Platform===\nThe platform has been extended back to its original length. This means that Berwyn can now accommodate 5-coach trains. However, due to the curve of the platform, a \u201cRight Away\u201d indicator has been installed at the western end of the station to enable a train guard to safely manage the train. \n\n== Locale ==\n=== Chain bridge ===\n[[File:(Chain Bridge Hotel, Berwyn Valley, Llangollen, Wales) (LOC) (3751632199).jpg|thumb|The second Chain Bridge across the River Dee]]\nAt the time of the railway's opening in 1865, the only way of crossing the River Dee at Berwyn was by using a [[chain bridge]]. There have been three such bridges. The first was built by mine owner Exuperius Pickering who needed to get his coal across the river to deliver it to [[Corwen]] and [[Bala, Gwynedd|Bala]]. Permission for the bridge was granted in 1814 and it opened in 1817 or very soon afterwards.\n\nIn the 1870s, a replacement bridge was built by [[Henry Robertson]] (the railway's engineer) and this lasted until February 1928, when an exceptionally heavy flood washed it away. The surviving [[Chain Bridge (Berwyn)|Chain Bridge]] was built in the summer of 1929, with six metal chains supporting the bridge deck from above and two chains supporting from below.\n\nThe bridge links two communities and is jointly owned by Llangollen Town Council and Llantysilio Community Council. A pathway from Berwyn station leads under a subway and down to the bridge and to the Chainbridge Hotel on the other side. After a lengthy period out of use and an extensive restoration, the bridge reopened in 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ramboll.co.uk/projects/ruk/chain-bridge|title=Llantysilio Chainbridge restoration|work=United Kingdom|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Llangollen Canal and the Horseshoe Falls ===\n[[File:Victoria & Horseshoe Falls.jpg|thumb|The tranquil Horseshoe Falls]]\nThe [[Llangollen Canal]] is located on the opposite side of the River Dee and accessible over the Chain Bridge (step-free access from the station platform).

Mechanisms used include:\n*[[electric battery|Batteries]] can retain a significant electrical charge, although their weight still limits the range achievable.\n*[[Power cable]]s connect to a ground-based supply.\n*[[Solar cell]]s convert sunlight directly into electricity.\n*[[Ultracapacitor]]s can store a limited amount of energy for short bursts of high-power use\n*[[Fuel cell]]s are similar to batteries but draw their reactants from an external source.\n*[[Microwave]] energy has been [[Power beaming|beamed]] from a ground-based source.\n\n===Batteries===\n[[Electric battery|Batteries]] are the most common [[energy carrier]] component of electric aircraft, due to their relatively high capacity. Batteries were the earliest source of electricity, first powering airships in the nineteenth century. These early batteries were very heavy and it was not until the arrival of technologies such as nickel-cadmium (NiCd) rechargeable types in the second half of the twentieth century, that batteries became a practicable power source. Modern battery types include lithium-based and a number of other less widely used technologies.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://mdolab.engin.umich.edu/content/26-lithium-ion-batteries-thermo-mechanics-performance-and-design-optimization|title=Lithium-Ion Batteries: Thermo-Mechanics, Performance, and Design Optimization|volume=5 : Energy Storage|publisher= John Wiley & Sons, Ltd |date=2015}}</ref> Such batteries remain a popular power source today, although they still have limited endurance between charges and hence limited range.\n\nBatteries are also often used for temporary storage of electricity generated by another source.\n\n===Power cables===\nAn electrical [[power cable]] may be connected to a ground-based supply, such as an electric generator. At low altitudes this can avoid carrying heavy batteries and was used by the experimental [[Petr\u00f3czy-K\u00e1rm\u00e1n-\u017durovec|Petr\u00f3czy-K\u00e1rm\u00e1n-\u017durovec PKZ-1]] observation helicopter of 1917. However such a craft must remain tethered to a ground facility, and the higher and or farther it flies, the heavier the weight of cable it must lift with it.\n\n===Solar cells===\nA [[solar cell]] converts sunlight directly into electricity, either for direct power or temporary storage. The power output of solar cells is small, even when many are connected together, which limits their use and is also expensive. However their use of freely available sunlight makes them attractive for high-altitude, long-endurance applications.\n\nFor endurance flights, keeping the craft in the air all night typically requires a backup storage system, which supplies power during the hours of darkness and recharges during the day.\n\n===Ultracapacitors===\nAn [[ultracapacitor]] can store a limited amount of energy for short bursts of high-power use, such as when taking off, but due to its relatively small storage ability it is not suitable as a primary power source. Its advantage over a small battery is the ability to charge and discharge much faster with higher peak currents.\n\n===Fuel cells===\nA [[fuel cell]] uses the reaction between two fluids such as [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] to create electricity. Unlike a battery, the fluids are not stored in the battery but are drawn in from outside. This offers the prospect of much greater range than batteries and experimental examples have flown, but the technology has yet to reach production.\n\n===Microwaves===\n[[Power beaming]] of electromagnetic energy such as [[microwave]]s, like a power cable, requires a ground-based power source. However, compared to a power cable, power beaming carries much less weight penalty as altitude increases. The technology has been demonstrated on small models but awaits practical development.<ref name=\"Power Beaming\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Pioneers===\nThe use of electricity for aircraft propulsion was first experimented with during the development of the [[airship]] which took place in the latter part of the nineteenth century. On 8 October 1883, [[Gaston Tissandier]] flew the first electrically-powered airship.<ref name=Tissandier1886/>{{rp|292}} The following year, [[Charles Renard]] and [[Arthur Krebs]] flew [[La France (airship)|La France]] with a more powerful motor.<ref name=Tissandier1886>{{cite book |url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2155076 |title= La Navigation a\u00e9rienne |at= L'aviation et la direction des a\u00e9rostats |author= Gaston Tissandier |year= 1886 |language= French |publisher= Hachette}}</ref>{{rp|306}} Even with the lifting capacity of an airship, the heavy accumulators needed to store the electricity severely limited the speed and range of such early airships.\n\nFor a tethered device such as an air observation platform, it is possible to run the power up the tether. In an attempt to create a more practical solution than the clumsy balloons then in use, the Austro-Hungarian [[Petr\u00f3czy-K\u00e1rm\u00e1n-\u017durovec]] PKZ-1 electric-powered helicopter was flown in 1917. It had a specially-designed {{cvt|190|hp|kW}} continuous-rated electric motor made by [[Austro-Daimler]] and received its power up a cable from a ground-based DC generator. However electric motors were not yet powerful enough for such applications and the motor burned out after only a few flights.<ref>{{cite magazine |author= Grosz, P. |title= Helicopter pioneers of World War I |magazine= [[Air Enthusiast]] |issue= 6 |year= 1978 |pages= 154\u2013159}}</ref>\n\nIn 1909, an electric [[Free flight (model aircraft)|free flight]] model was claimed to have been flown eight minutes, but this claim was disputed by the builder of the first recorded electric [[Radio-Controlled model aircraft]] flight in 1957.<ref>{{cite book |author= Dave Day |title= Electric Flight |chapter= History of Electric Flight |publisher= Argus Books |year= 1983 |chapter-url= http://www.windyurtnowski.com/DaveDay/hist.htm}}</ref>\nPower density for electric flight is problematic even for small models.\n\nIn 1964, [[William C.

The [[Mauro Solar Riser]] used photovoltaic cells to deliver 350 watts at 30 volts. These charged a small battery, which in turn powered the motor.

Mechanisms used include:\n*[[electric battery|Batteries]] can retain a significant electrical charge, although their weight still limits the range achievable.\n*[[Power cable]]s connect to a ground-based supply.\n*[[Solar cell]]s convert sunlight directly into electricity.\n*[[Ultracapacitor]]s can store a limited amount of energy for short bursts of high-power use\n*[[Fuel cell]]s are similar to batteries but draw their reactants from an external source.\n*[[Microwave]] energy has been [[Power beaming|beamed]] from a ground-based source.\n\n===Batteries===\n[[Electric battery|Batteries]] are the most common [[energy carrier]] component of electric aircraft, due to their relatively high capacity. Batteries were the earliest source of electricity, first powering airships in the nineteenth century. These early batteries were very heavy and it was not until the arrival of technologies such as nickel-cadmium (NiCd) rechargeable types in the second half of the twentieth century, that batteries became a practicable power source. Modern battery types include lithium-based and a number of other less widely used technologies.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://mdolab.engin.umich.edu/content/26-lithium-ion-batteries-thermo-mechanics-performance-and-design-optimization|title=Lithium-Ion Batteries: Thermo-Mechanics, Performance, and Design Optimization|volume=5 : Energy Storage|publisher= John Wiley & Sons, Ltd |date=2015}}</ref> Such batteries remain a popular power source today, although they still have limited endurance between charges and hence limited range.\n\nBatteries are also often used for temporary storage of electricity generated by another source.\n\n===Power cables===\nAn electrical [[power cable]] may be connected to a ground-based supply, such as an electric generator. At low altitudes this can avoid carrying heavy batteries and was used by the experimental [[Petr\u00f3czy-K\u00e1rm\u00e1n-\u017durovec|Petr\u00f3czy-K\u00e1rm\u00e1n-\u017durovec PKZ-1]] observation helicopter of 1917. However such a craft must remain tethered to a ground facility, and the higher and or farther it flies, the heavier the weight of cable it must lift with it.\n\n===Solar cells===\nA [[solar cell]] converts sunlight directly into electricity, either for direct power or temporary storage. The power output of solar cells is small, even when many are connected together, which limits their use and is also expensive. However their use of freely available sunlight makes them attractive for high-altitude, long-endurance applications.\n\nFor endurance flights, keeping the craft in the air all night typically requires a backup storage system, which supplies power during the hours of darkness and recharges during the day.\n\n===Ultracapacitors===\nAn [[ultracapacitor]] can store a limited amount of energy for short bursts of high-power use, such as when taking off, but due to its relatively small storage ability it is not suitable as a primary power source. Its advantage over a small battery is the ability to charge and discharge much faster with higher peak currents.\n\n===Fuel cells===\nA [[fuel cell]] uses the reaction between two fluids such as [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] to create electricity. Unlike a battery, the fluids are not stored in the battery but are drawn in from outside. This offers the prospect of much greater range than batteries and experimental examples have flown, but the technology has yet to reach production.\n\n===Microwaves===\n[[Power beaming]] of electromagnetic energy such as [[microwave]]s, like a power cable, requires a ground-based power source. However, compared to a power cable, power beaming carries much less weight penalty as altitude increases. The technology has been demonstrated on small models but awaits practical development.<ref name=\"Power Beaming\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Pioneers===\nThe use of electricity for aircraft propulsion was first experimented with during the development of the [[airship]] which took place in the latter part of the nineteenth century. On 8 October 1883, [[Gaston Tissandier]] flew the first electrically-powered airship.<ref name=Tissandier1886/>{{rp|292}} The following year, [[Charles Renard]] and [[Arthur Krebs]] flew [[La France (airship)|La France]] with a more powerful motor.<ref name=Tissandier1886>{{cite book |url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2155076 |title= La Navigation a\u00e9rienne |at= L'aviation et la direction des a\u00e9rostats |author= Gaston Tissandier |year= 1886 |language= French |publisher= Hachette}}</ref>{{rp|306}} Even with the lifting capacity of an airship, the heavy accumulators needed to store the electricity severely limited the speed and range of such early airships.\n\nFor a tethered device such as an air observation platform, it is possible to run the power up the tether. In an attempt to create a more practical solution than the clumsy balloons then in use, the Austro-Hungarian [[Petr\u00f3czy-K\u00e1rm\u00e1n-\u017durovec]] PKZ-1 electric-powered helicopter was flown in 1917. It had a specially-designed {{cvt|190|hp|kW}} continuous-rated electric motor made by [[Austro-Daimler]] and received its power up a cable from a ground-based DC generator. However electric motors were not yet powerful enough for such applications and the motor burned out after only a few flights.<ref>{{cite magazine |author= Grosz, P. |title= Helicopter pioneers of World War I |magazine= [[Air Enthusiast]] |issue= 6 |year= 1978 |pages= 154\u2013159}}</ref>\n\nIn 1909, an electric [[Free flight (model aircraft)|free flight]] model was claimed to have been flown eight minutes, but this claim was disputed by the builder of the first recorded electric [[Radio-Controlled model aircraft]] flight in 1957.<ref>{{cite book |author= Dave Day |title= Electric Flight |chapter= History of Electric Flight |publisher= Argus Books |year= 1983 |chapter-url= http://www.windyurtnowski.com/DaveDay/hist.htm}}</ref>\nPower density for electric flight is problematic even for small models.\n\nIn 1964, [[William C.
