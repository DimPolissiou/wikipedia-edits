Kellum  returned to portray the character in the [[Arrow (season 8)|final season]].\n\n==Publication history==\nMichael Holt was created by [[John Ostrander]] and [[Tom Mandrake]] and first appeared in ''[[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]'' (vol. 3) #54 (June 1997).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=207}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nAt a very young age, Michael Holt shows remarkable intelligence, reading and assimilating the works of [[Aage Bohr]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Max Planck]] and [[Richard Feynman]], the pantheon of theoretical physics.<ref name=\"JSA #13, pg.1\">''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' #13, pg.1</ref> Michael grows up with his mentally challenged older brother, Jeffrey, whom he loves dearly. When Jeffrey dies at the age of 12, Michael is devastated.<ref>''52'' #39, pg.22</ref>\n\nHolt displays \"a natural aptitude for having natural aptitudes\", as he calls it, easily picking up and retaining complex skills and abilities that others spend their entire lives perfecting. Before he begins his career as a superhero, he already possesses 14 [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]]s (two in [[engineering]] and [[physics]]\u2014including doctorates and master's degrees in [[law]], [[psychology]], [[chemistry]], [[political science]], and [[mathematics]]<ref name=\"JSA #28, pg. 11\">''JSA'' #28, pg. 11</ref><ref name=\"JSA #53, pg. 8\">''JSA'' #53, pg. 8</ref>)\u2014is a self-made multi-millionaire<ref name=\"JSA #13, pg.1\"/> with a high tech firm called Cyberwear (subsequently sold to [[Waynetech]]<ref name=\"JSA #28, pg. 11\">''JSA'' #28, pg. 11</ref>), and is a [[gold medal]]-winning [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[Decathlon|decathlete]].\n\nThe accidental deaths of his wife and unborn child are a devastating blow to Holt. He considers himself responsible for the accident as he made his wife late for church by arguing with her about the value of religion. While contemplating [[suicide]], he is met by the Spectre, who tells him about [[Mister Terrific (Terry Sloane)|Terry Sloane]], the Golden Age superhero known as Mister Terrific. Inspired by Sloane's life story, he takes the name Mister Terrific<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1990s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 279 |quote = ''The Spectre'' ongoing series was nearing its end, but that didn't stop writer John Ostrander and artist Tom Mandrake from pooling their creative forces to create one of the DCU's newest shining stars...An inspired and reborn [Michael] Holt then picked up the mantle of Mr. Terrific.}}</ref> and later joins the current [[Justice Society of America]] (JSA), eventually serving as its chairman.\n\nInitially, he wears ordinary clothes and a leather jacket with Sloane's \"Fair Play\" emblem on the back. Later, he switches to a T-shaped mask composed of electronic [[nanorobotics|nanite]]s, a black and white costume with red trim, and a collarless jacket in the same colors (the black sections of tunic and jacket forming a \"'''T'''\") with \"Fair Play\" written on the sleeves and \"Terrific\" across the back.\n\nFor a time, he acts as spokesperson for [[Hourman|Tylerco]] and consults for the company on [[industrial espionage]] and security matters in exchange for it helping fund a youth center Terrific has started.<ref>''JSA'' #5, pg.6</ref>\n\nHolt has a friendly rivalry with [[Batman]], his opposite number in the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] (in his identity as Bruce Wayne, Batman owns Holt's business). Holt has encountered Sloane twice through [[time travel]], with Sloane expressing pride in having so worthy a successor. Holt has been noted as the most intelligent member of the JSA in its history, surpassing his predecessor. He is also known as the third-smartest person in the world,<ref name=\"Infinite Crisis # 5, pg. 1\">''Infinite Crisis'' # 5, pg. 1</ref> and this notion now appears to be widespread within the DC Universe.<ref>''Justice Society of America (vol. 3)'' # 2, pg. 3</ref>\n\n===Justice Society of America chairmanship===\nDuring a conflict over leadership of the Justice Society between former chairman [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] and then-current chairman [[Sandy Hawkins|Sand]], Terrific is elected as the JSA's new chairman by his teammates, despite not actively seeking the office.<ref>''JSA'' #27, pg.17-18</ref> He serves in this capacity until the team disbands following the [[Infinite Crisis]].\n\nMr. Terrific currently remains a member of the reformed Justice Society of America. He resumed his chairmanship from the last incarnation of the team,<ref>''52'' #39, pg. 22, Backup Origin</ref> but his leadership responsibilities in Checkmate eventually prompt him to relinquish the position to [[Power Girl]].<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) # 4</ref>\n\n===Infinite Crisis===\n{{main|Infinite Crisis}}\nMr. Terrific is part of the team assembled by Batman for an attack on the [[OMAC (comics)|Brother Eye]] satellite responsible for controlling the OMACs. He plays a critical role as his invisibility to technology allows him to reach the satellite's propulsion system, sending it crashing to Earth. During this time, he meets and befriends another African American superhero\u2014[[Black Lightning]].\n\n===One Year Later===\n{{main|One Year Later}}\nIn the \"[[One Year Later]]\" storyline, Holt is still a member of the JSA, and he has also become part of the [[United Nations Security Council]]'s intelligence agency, [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]. He holds the position of White King's Bishop initially, but when the previous White King (Alan Scott) is forced to resign, he becomes Checkmate's new White King, complicating his relationship with [[Sasha Bordeaux]], Checkmate's Black Queen. He has also given up his chairman position, which has been taken over by [[Power Girl]]. Mr. Terrific has also established an ill-defined mentorship with [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] over the missing year; the specifics of their meeting are yet to be documented.\n\nHolt is forced to face his issues with faith once again when the JSA confront [[Gog (DC Comics)#Thy Kingdom Come|Gog]], a God of the Second World. Not only is Gog incapable of hearing Terrific due to his lack of faith, but during a trip to the Earth-Two of the new multiverse, Holt encounters his Earth-Two counterpart, who is now a devout believer after having a religious experience on the day his wife survived her accident.\n\n===Final Crisis===\n{{main|Final Crisis}}\nDuring the ''Final Crisis of Humanity'', the war between [[Darkseid]] and the human world, Mister Terrific, along with [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] and [[Snapper Carr]], are left trapped in the ruins of Checkmate headquarters, unable to get past the brainwashed [[metahuman]], and caring for Sasha, who prefers using her [[OMAC (comics)|OMAC]] programming to shut down her bodily functions rather than falling prey to the [[Anti-Life Equation]]. Forcefully waking up Sasha, thus condemning her, Michael Holt has no choice but to activate a new OMAC population, programmed to obey him rather than Brother Eye, and to protect the last few humans against the new [[Justifiers]].\n\n===Death and return===\nIn ''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 series, Mr. Terrific takes over the research, just as the low-level villain Tapeworm appears on the news, taking hostages and demanding that Wildcat show himself. [[Jeremy Karne|All-American Kid]] and [[King Chimera]] must remain in the brownstone, Mister Terrific retreats to his lab, and the rest of the team leaves to help Wildcat. All-American Kid goes into the lab and stabs Mister Terrific in the back, pretending to have been mind controlled.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #29 (July 2009)</ref> Justice Society members arrive back at headquarters to discover Mr. Terrific has been attacked, and [[Dr. Mid-Nite (Pieter Cross)|Dr. Mid-Nite]] tends to his wounds.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #30 (August 2009)</ref> In the end, Mister Terrific succumbs to his injuries and Alan Scott reports that he has died.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #31 (September 2009)</ref> However, Scott is able to use the power of the Green Flame to slow down time around Mister Terrific's body in the hopes that he can be healed before brain death occurs.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #32 (October 2009)</ref> Michael is restored to life by the magic of the new [[Doctor Fate]], and attacks All-American Kid, revealing that he is actually the teenage psychopath known as [[Jeremy Karne|Kid Karnevil]], and subdues him.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #33 (November 2009)</ref> For a short time during his recovery, Michael is forced to use a wheelchair, although he still finds time to upgrade [[Mister America (Jeffrey Graves)|Mister America]]'s whip.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #34 (December 2009)</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nOn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity.

While trying to get Simon Stagg to close the portal with the help of Plastic Man, Mister Terrific is sucked in to the portal with Plastic Man and Metamorpho as Plastic Man shields them from the Dark Multiverse energy. Upon arriving on a lifeless world, they encounter [[Phantom Girl]] who has been trapped in her intangible form and had no knowledge of sending a signal. When the four of them find a computer in the gut of a dead giant creature, they are greeted by a hologram of [[Tom Strong]] who states that they are needed to save the universe.<ref>''The Terrifics'' #1. DC Comics.</ref> Mister Terrific, Plastic Man, and Metamorpho learn from Phantom Girl that she was stuck in intangible form since she was a child. After the four of them made it back to their world, Mister Terrific tries to leave the three of them at Simon Stagg's compound only to be drawn back to them.<ref>''The Terrifics'' #2. DC Comics.</ref> Due to the effects of the Dark Multiverse energy, Mister Terrific concludes that they can't go their separate ways due to this bond. Though Mister Terrific was able to come up with a compromise with Simon Stagg by investigating the bond at his facility. This leads to Mister Terrific to find the Tom Strong that sent left the message and find out how to get untethered by the dark energy.<ref>''The Terrifics'' #3. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Religious beliefs==\nWhile being held captive by [[Onimar Synn]] on an adventure with the Justice Society on [[Thanagar]], Holt first expresses his disbelief in souls and that he is uncomfortable with the notion of [[reincarnation]] after witnessing the return of teammate [[Hawkman]]. Holt states, \"when my wife, Paula, was killed in a car accident ... she was gone. I didn't feel her 'soul' around me. Didn't feel anything\".<ref>''JSA'' # 26, pg. 8-9</ref> He later elaborates on this by explaining that his lack of faith extends back prior to his wife's death, and states that he blames himself for her death as he delayed her going to church because the two of them argued about the merits of faith. Holt believes that she would have avoided the accident if she had not been arguing with him. He acknowledges the irony of this given such factors as the Spectre's role in his origin, and his encounter with the likes of the [[Spirit King]], but he still maintains his skepticism about faith and religion.\n\nAfter a [[near-death experience]] where he sees his wife and unborn child (whom he decides to name 'Terry' after the original Mister Terrific), Holt's atheism is shaken and he agrees to attend a church service with teammate [[Doctor Mid-Nite]].<ref>''JSA'' # 62, pg. 17-21</ref>\n\nHowever, this attempt to find religion apparently is not satisfying as Holt is also seen getting into a theological discussion with [[Ragman (comics)|Ragman]] during the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' (Ragman is [[Judaism|Jewish]] while Mr. Terrific describes himself as an [[atheism|atheist]]). When asked if he has faith in anything, Terrific answered, \"Sure I do. I've got faith in my team.\"<ref name=\"Infinite Crisis # 5, pg. 1\"/>\n\nDuring ''Thy Kingdom Come'', when Power Girl is sent back to the Earth-2 pre-Crisis universe, she meets her world's Michael Holt, who is ironically a priest after he has a religious experience. During the same storyline, 'our' Holt told Doctor Mid-Nite that he feels that his issues with faith actually stem from his own inability to understand it, confessing that he ''wants'' to believe but something inside him will not let him.\n\n==Powers, abilities, and equipment==\n*Holt is described as having \"a natural aptitude for having natural aptitudes\"; picking up complicated skills quickly and retaining them, such as performing emergency surgery on teammate [[Alan Scott]] after reading about the procedure in a medical textbook and subsequently becoming Dr. Mid-Nite's assistant. As Holt himself put it, \"everyone has a talent... Mine is learning.\"<ref>''JSA'' # 17, pg. 1</ref><ref name=\"JSA #53, pg. 8\" />\n*Holt is also known as the third-smartest man on Earth.<ref name=\"Infinite Crisis # 5, pg. 1\"/>\n*He is aided by his \"T-Spheres\", floating robotic spheres with multiple functions, [[holograph]]ic projection,<ref>''JSA All-Stars'' # 7, pg.4</ref> projecting [[laser]] grids,<ref>''JSA'' # 61, pg.6</ref> and recording, communication, linking with and manipulating other electronic devices, from satellites to electronic locks.<ref>''JSA: Classified'' # 29, pg.11</ref> They allow Terrific to fly by bearing his weight,<ref>''JSA'' # 78, pg.3</ref> and can be used as weapons, both by exploding with enough force to send [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] flying back,<ref>''JSA'' # 41, pg.19</ref> generating powerful electric charges,<ref>''JSA'' # 31, pg.16</ref> and strike as flying, projectile weapons.<ref>''JSA'' # 71, pg.4</ref> They respond to his mental and vocal commands.\n*He is [[invisibility|invisible]] to all forms of electronic detection. Despite a claim to Black Lightning in ''Infinite Crisis'' that \"I've got one superpower: I'm invisible to technology,\" in all other instances this ability is tied to nanotechnology woven into his specially designed \"T-Mask\" (which is molecularly bonded to his face and can appear and disappear at will) and costume. Mr. Terrific was apparently the only superhero whom the [[OMAC (comics)|OMACs]] could not detect. The only exception to his invisibility, however, is that of the [[Red Tornado]], who, for reasons yet unknown, is capable of seeing Terrific despite being an android. Red Tornado's status as a sentient wind elemental merely occupying an android body likely explains his ability to see Holt.\n*Through his mask, Holt can change instantaneously into costume and back again.<ref>''JSA'' # 84, pg. 8</ref> His mask also protects his face from chemicals.<ref>''JSA All-Stars'' # 7, pg.6</ref> The mask works in conjunction with an earpiece to act as a communications system, and also doubles as an encephalic broadcaster, picking up aggregate thought waves, allowing him to communicate with his T-Spheres, and even project a speaking hologram of himself, even if he is injured or too weak to speak.<ref>''JSA'' # 49, pg. 5-6</ref> The mask can also form and transmit images on low- or high-band light frequencies visible to his teammate Doctor Mid-Nite.\n*He is a black belt in 6 different [[martial arts]] disciplines and an Olympic Gold Medalist in the [[decathlon]].<ref name=\"JSA #28, pg. 11\"/><ref>''JSA'' # 12, pg.6</ref>\n*Holt is also a [[polymath]] who has specialized in multiple fields of medicine, engineering, and science. He possesses fourteen Ph.Ds (two of which are in engineering and physics).<ref name=\"JSA #28, pg. 11\"/>\n* Along with teammate and friend [[Doctor Mid-Nite]] and Batman, Mister Terrific is one of the three main superheroes with medical training in the [[DC Universe]]. Although it is not known if he has an M.D., he did participate in the autopsy of [[Sue Dibny]] in ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]''.<ref>''JSA'' # 67, pg.2-6</ref>\n*Holt is also [[Polyglotism|polyglot]], though the extent of this hasn't been revealed. He has been shown to speak the languages of the fictional nations of [[Kahndaq]] and Bialya. Given Holt's propensity for learning, it is likely that he speaks several other languages as well.<ref>''Hawkman'' (vol. 3) # 24, pg. 10</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Earth-2===\nIn 2008, an alternate version of Michael Holt from a [[The 52|new]] [[Earth-Two|Earth-2]] appeared in DC stories. This version is a college professor, who has a religious experience after his wife is nearly killed in an accident. This version of Paula Holt is merely left in a coma rather than dying immediately. While contemplating suicide after spending three months trying unsuccessfully to find a cure, he saves another man who is preparing to jump off the same bridge, takes him to a church that was the nearest illuminated building, and the man he saves prays for him. After his wife regains consciousness the following day, this Michael Holt went on to become a devout Christian. He helps the Power Girl of [[List of DC Multiverse worlds#New Earth|New Earth]] to return home.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #19</ref> When the Justice Society arrives on Earth-2, Professor Holt confronts his counterpart Michael Holt from New-Earth. Professor Holt introduces the Justice Society to his wife, Paula, although New-Earth Michael just introduces himself as Mister Terrific rather than reveal his true name.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #20</ref>\n\n===Flashpoint===\nIn the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Mister and Missus Terrific are framed for unknown crimes when they discover [[Outsider (comics)|Outsider]]'s illicit schemes, and are attempting to assassinate him. Mister and Missus Terrific are both killed by Outsider's guardian statue.<ref>''Flashpoint: The Outsider'' #1 (June 2011)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n\n====Live action====\n* Michael Holt is mentioned in the ''[[Smallville]]'' episode \"[[Absolute Justice]]\" (which featured the Justice Society) in the second half by Lois Lane, who mentions that she skipped an interview with him. He is described as a Nobel-winning scientist and tech guru. \n* A character named '''[[Curtis Holt (Arrowverse)|Curtis Holt]]''' appears in [[the CW]] series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', played by [[Echo Kellum]]. When he is first introduced in [[Arrow (season 4)|season four]], Curtis works with [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]] at Palmer Technology.<ref>{{cite web|last=Abrams |first=Natalie |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/16/arrow-echo-kellum-mr-terrific-season-4 |title='Arrow' casts Mr. Terrific for season 4 |publisher=EW.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-04}}</ref> Like his comic book incarnation, he has created the T-spheres and occasionally wears the Fair Play jacket. Curtis is a big fan of [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Green Arrow]], and after learning that Felicity has a connection with him, he is determined to figure out his identity. In the episode \"Beacon of Hope\", Curtis joins Team Arrow temporarily and learns the members' identities, helping them to defeat the latest attack of [[Bug-Eyed Bandit|Brie Larvan]]. In [[Arrow (season 5)|season five]], Curtis officially joins Team Arrow and begins training to become a vigilante.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mitovich |first=Matt |url=http://tvline.com/2016/04/04/arrow-season-5-echo-kellum-series-regular-curtis/ |title='Arrow Season 5: Echo Kellum Promoted to Series Regular as Curtis |publisher=tvline.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-05}}</ref> As a vigilante, Curtis uses the name \"Mr. Terrific\", which is a homage to his favorite wrestling champion [[Terry Sloane]], who went by the same name in the ring. Curtis leaves Team Arrow and Star City during [[Arrow (season 7)|season seven]], returning to take part in the season finale where he helps the team against the [[Ninth Circle]]. He is confirmed to be [[gay]] and is revealed to have a boyfriend named Paul (perhaps a gender-swapped version of his wife in the comics who was named Paula) who he plans to propose to.\n\n====Animation====\n[[File:MrTerrific.jpg|thumb|right|Mr. Terrific on ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' in the episode \"Destroyer\".]]\n* Michael Holt has made several [[cameo appearance]]s in the animated TV series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. He moves into a more prominent role in the series' final season, becoming the League's Coordinator and responsible for assigning tasks to the various heroes after [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]] resigns from active duty. The animated Mr. Terrific is voiced by former ''[[Third Watch]]'' star [[Michael Beach]].  It is unknown whether Mr. Terrific retains his invisibility to technology, as throughout the show the image of his face appears on several computer screens. His status as one of the world's smartest men is referred to in his full introductory appearance, and the T-Spheres are used in a subsequent episode.\n* Michael Holt appears in \"Hunted\", the premiere episode of ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', where he is voiced by [[Gary Anthony Williams]]. He is depicted as a businessman who is kidnapped along with [[Simon Stagg]] and [[Alfred Pennyworth]] by [[Professor Pyg]] and [[Mister Toad (comics)|Mr. Toad]]. The three of them are rescued by Batman.\n* Mister Terrific appears in ''[[Justice League Action]]'' episode \"The Cube Root\", voiced by [[Hannibal Buress]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Lucas Siegel |url=http://comicbook.com/dc/2016/06/06/new-justice-league-action-characters-officially-revealed/ |title=New Justice League Action Characters Officially Revealed |publisher=Comicbook.com |date=2016-06-05 |accessdate=2016-09-10}}</ref> This version is a former child prodigy who was the college roommate of Martin Stein (who claimed that Mister Terrific based his T-Spheres off his S-Cubes). Mister Terrific was establishing the science center dedicated to him which [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] attends until it is crashed by [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]] who hacks into Mister Terrific's T-Spheres. During Mister Terrific and Firestorm's fight with Calculator upon him causing a blackout, Calculator uses the hacked T-Spheres to split Firestorm back into Ronnie Raymond and Martin Stein where the hacked T-Spheres make off with Ronnie Raymond. This causes Mister Terrific and Martin Stein to work together to rescue Ronnie Raymond using the S-Cubes as a diversion so that Martin Stein can combine with Ronnie Raymond in order to form Firestorm. Mister Terrific and Firestorm reclaim control over the T-Spheres, defeat Calculator, and hand him over to the police. In \u201cThe Brain Buster\u201d, he is kidnapped along with other highly intelligent heroes and villains to participate in an initially unknown figure's series of contests to determine who is most intelligent. It is mentioned several times that he is \u201conly\u201d the third-smartest person in the world. In the end, he reveals that he prefers not to call too much attention to himself; he is the one who made the list, and gave himself third place.\n\n===Film===\n* In ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'', a picture of a Parallel Earth version of Mister Terrific, named '''Mister Horrific''', can be seen in [[Joker (character)|the Joker]]'s counterpart computer, as one of [[Superwoman]]'s made men.\n* An alternate universe version of Michael Holt appears in ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'', voiced by [[Arif S. Kinchen]]. He was a scientist who was part of [[Lex Luthor]]'s \"Project Fair Play\". While meeting with the other scientists (consisting of [[Will Magnus]], [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|John Henry Irons]], [[Bumblebee (comics)|Karen Beecher]], [[Pat Dugan]], [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Kimiyo Hoshi]], [[Professor Hamilton|Emil Hamilton]], [[T. O. Morrow|Thomas Morrow]], and [[Stephen Shin]]), Michael Holt is killed with the other scientists by the [[Metal Men]] where he was impaled by the Wonderdroid. Will Magnus survived as he secretly orchestrated the attack on his fellow scientists.\n* Mr. Terrific appears in the 2019 [[DC Universe Original Movie]] ''[[Justice League vs. the Fatal Five]]'', voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/justice-league-fatal-five-voice-cast-set-1173352|title='Justice League vs. The Fatal Five' Sets Voice Cast (Exclusive) |last=Couch|first=Aaron|date=January 7, 2019|website=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> In this film, he serves as a foil to Tharok of the Fatal Five, often having to come up with ways to outwit his future know-how.\n\n===Video games===\n* Mr. Terrific makes a background cameo in the video game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''.

He considers himself responsible for the accident as he made his wife late for church by arguing with her about the value of religion. While contemplating [[suicide]], he is met by the Spectre, who tells him about [[Mister Terrific (Terry Sloane)|Terry Sloane]], the Golden Age superhero known as Mister Terrific.

Forcefully waking up Sasha, thus condemning her, Michael Holt has no choice but to activate a new OMAC population, programmed to obey him rather than Brother Eye, and to protect the last few humans against the new [[Justifiers]].\n\n===Death and return===\nIn ''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 series, Mr. Terrific takes over the research, just as the low-level villain Tapeworm appears on the news, taking hostages and demanding that Wildcat show himself.

While trying to get Simon Stagg to close the portal with the help of Plastic Man, Mister Terrific is sucked in to the portal with Plastic Man and Metamorpho as Plastic Man shields them from the Dark Multiverse energy. Upon arriving on a lifeless world, they encounter [[Phantom Girl]] who has been trapped in her intangible form and had no knowledge of sending a signal. When the four of them find a computer in the gut of a dead giant creature, they are greeted by a hologram of [[Tom Strong]] who states that they are needed to save the universe.<ref>''The Terrifics'' #1. DC Comics.</ref> Mister Terrific, Plastic Man, and Metamorpho learn from Phantom Girl that she was stuck in intangible form since she was a child. After the four of them made it back to their world, Mister Terrific tries to leave the three of them at Simon Stagg's compound only to be drawn back to them.<ref>''The Terrifics'' #2. DC Comics.</ref> Due to the effects of the Dark Multiverse energy, Mister Terrific concludes that they can't go their separate ways due to this bond. Though Mister Terrific was able to come up with a compromise with Simon Stagg by investigating the bond at his facility. This leads to Mister Terrific to find the Tom Strong that sent left the message and find out how to get untethered by the dark energy.<ref>''The Terrifics'' #3. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Religious beliefs==\nWhile being held captive by [[Onimar Synn]] on an adventure with the Justice Society on [[Thanagar]], Holt first expresses his disbelief in souls and that he is uncomfortable with the notion of [[reincarnation]] after witnessing the return of teammate [[Hawkman]]. Holt states, \"when my wife, Paula, was killed in a car accident ... she was gone. I didn't feel her 'soul' around me. Didn't feel anything\".<ref>''JSA'' # 26, pg. 8-9</ref> He later elaborates on this by explaining that his lack of faith extends back prior to his wife's death, and states that he blames himself for her death as he delayed her going to church because the two of them argued about the merits of faith. Holt believes that she would have avoided the accident if she had not been arguing with him. He acknowledges the irony of this given such factors as the Spectre's role in his origin, and his encounter with the likes of the [[Spirit King]], but he still maintains his skepticism about faith and religion.\n\nAfter a [[near-death experience]] where he sees his wife and unborn child (whom he decides to name 'Terry' after the original Mister Terrific), Holt's atheism is shaken and he agrees to attend a church service with teammate [[Doctor Mid-Nite]].<ref>''JSA'' # 62, pg. 17-21</ref>\n\nHowever, this attempt to find religion apparently is not satisfying as Holt is also seen getting into a theological discussion with [[Ragman (comics)|Ragman]] during the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' (Ragman is [[Judaism|Jewish]] while Mr. Terrific describes himself as an [[atheism|atheist]]). When asked if he has faith in anything, Terrific answered, \"Sure I do. I've got faith in my team.\"<ref name=\"Infinite Crisis # 5, pg. 1\"/>\n\nDuring ''Thy Kingdom Come'', when Power Girl is sent back to the Earth-2 pre-Crisis universe, she meets her world's Michael Holt, who is ironically a priest after he has a religious experience. During the same storyline, 'our' Holt told Doctor Mid-Nite that he feels that his issues with faith actually stem from his own inability to understand it, confessing that he ''wants'' to believe but something inside him will not let him.\n\n==Powers, abilities, and equipment==\n*Holt is described as having \"a natural aptitude for having natural aptitudes\"; picking up complicated skills quickly and retaining them, such as performing emergency surgery on teammate [[Alan Scott]] after reading about the procedure in a medical textbook and subsequently becoming Dr. Mid-Nite's assistant. As Holt himself put it, \"everyone has a talent... Mine is learning.\"<ref>''JSA'' # 17, pg. 1</ref><ref name=\"JSA #53, pg. 8\" />\n*Holt is also known as the third-smartest man on Earth.<ref name=\"Infinite Crisis # 5, pg. 1\"/>\n*He is aided by his \"T-Spheres\", floating robotic spheres with multiple functions, [[holograph]]ic projection,<ref>''JSA All-Stars'' # 7, pg.4</ref> projecting [[laser]] grids,<ref>''JSA'' # 61, pg.6</ref> and recording, communication, linking with and manipulating other electronic devices, from satellites to electronic locks.<ref>''JSA: Classified'' # 29, pg.11</ref> They allow Terrific to fly by bearing his weight,<ref>''JSA'' # 78, pg.3</ref> and can be used as weapons, both by exploding with enough force to send [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] flying back,<ref>''JSA'' # 41, pg.19</ref> generating powerful electric charges,<ref>''JSA'' # 31, pg.16</ref> and strike as flying, projectile weapons.<ref>''JSA'' # 71, pg.4</ref> They respond to his mental and vocal commands.\n*He is [[invisibility|invisible]] to all forms of electronic detection. Despite a claim to Black Lightning in ''Infinite Crisis'' that \"I've got one superpower: I'm invisible to technology,\" in all other instances this ability is tied to nanotechnology woven into his specially designed \"T-Mask\" (which is molecularly bonded to his face and can appear and disappear at will) and costume. Mr. Terrific was apparently the only superhero whom the [[OMAC (comics)|OMACs]] could not detect. The only exception to his invisibility, however, is that of the [[Red Tornado]], who, for reasons yet unknown, is capable of seeing Terrific despite being an android. Red Tornado's status as a sentient wind elemental merely occupying an android body likely explains his ability to see Holt.\n*Through his mask, Holt can change instantaneously into costume and back again.<ref>''JSA'' # 84, pg. 8</ref> His mask also protects his face from chemicals.<ref>''JSA All-Stars'' # 7, pg.6</ref> The mask works in conjunction with an earpiece to act as a communications system, and also doubles as an encephalic broadcaster, picking up aggregate thought waves, allowing him to communicate with his T-Spheres, and even project a speaking hologram of himself, even if he is injured or too weak to speak.<ref>''JSA'' # 49, pg. 5-6</ref> The mask can also form and transmit images on low- or high-band light frequencies visible to his teammate Doctor Mid-Nite.\n*He is a black belt in 6 different [[martial arts]] disciplines and an Olympic Gold Medalist in the [[decathlon]].<ref name=\"JSA #28, pg. 11\"/><ref>''JSA'' # 12, pg.6</ref>\n*Holt is also a [[polymath]] who has specialized in multiple fields of medicine, engineering, and science. He possesses fourteen Ph.Ds (two of which are in engineering and physics).<ref name=\"JSA #28, pg. 11\"/>\n* Along with teammate and friend [[Doctor Mid-Nite]] and Batman, Mister Terrific is one of the three main superheroes with medical training in the [[DC Universe]]. Although it is not known if he has an M.D., he did participate in the autopsy of [[Sue Dibny]] in ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]''.<ref>''JSA'' # 67, pg.2-6</ref>\n*Holt is also [[Polyglotism|polyglot]], though the extent of this hasn't been revealed. He has been shown to speak the languages of the fictional nations of [[Kahndaq]] and Bialya. Given Holt's propensity for learning, it is likely that he speaks several other languages as well.<ref>''Hawkman'' (vol. 3) # 24, pg. 10</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Earth-2===\nIn 2008, an alternate version of Michael Holt from a [[The 52|new]] [[Earth-Two|Earth-2]] appeared in DC stories. This version is a college professor, who has a religious experience after his wife is nearly killed in an accident. This version of Paula Holt is merely left in a coma rather than dying immediately. While contemplating suicide after spending three months trying unsuccessfully to find a cure, he saves another man who is preparing to jump off the same bridge, takes him to a church that was the nearest illuminated building, and the man he saves prays for him. After his wife regains consciousness the following day, this Michael Holt went on to become a devout Christian. He helps the Power Girl of [[List of DC Multiverse worlds#New Earth|New Earth]] to return home.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #19</ref> When the Justice Society arrives on Earth-2, Professor Holt confronts his counterpart Michael Holt from New-Earth. Professor Holt introduces the Justice Society to his wife, Paula, although New-Earth Michael just introduces himself as Mister Terrific rather than reveal his true name.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #20</ref>\n\n===Flashpoint===\nIn the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Mister and Missus Terrific are framed for unknown crimes when they discover [[Outsider (comics)|Outsider]]'s illicit schemes, and are attempting to assassinate him. Mister and Missus Terrific are both killed by Outsider's guardian statue.<ref>''Flashpoint: The Outsider'' #1 (June 2011)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n\n====Live action====\n* Michael Holt is mentioned in the ''[[Smallville]]'' episode \"[[Absolute Justice]]\" (which featured the Justice Society) in the second half by Lois Lane, who mentions that she skipped an interview with him. He is described as a Nobel-winning scientist and tech guru. \n* A character named '''[[Curtis Holt (Arrowverse)|Curtis Holt]]''' appears in [[the CW]] series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', played by [[Echo Kellum]]. When he is first introduced in [[Arrow (season 4)|season four]], Curtis works with [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]] at Palmer Technology.<ref>{{cite web|last=Abrams |first=Natalie |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/16/arrow-echo-kellum-mr-terrific-season-4 |title='Arrow' casts Mr. Terrific for season 4 |publisher=EW.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-04}}</ref> Like his comic book incarnation, he has created the T-spheres and occasionally wears the Fair Play jacket. Curtis is a big fan of [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Green Arrow]], and after learning that Felicity has a connection with him, he is determined to figure out his identity. In the episode \"Beacon of Hope\", Curtis joins Team Arrow temporarily and learns the members' identities, helping them to defeat the latest attack of [[Bug-Eyed Bandit|Brie Larvan]]. In [[Arrow (season 5)|season five]], Curtis officially joins Team Arrow and begins training to become a vigilante.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mitovich |first=Matt |url=http://tvline.com/2016/04/04/arrow-season-5-echo-kellum-series-regular-curtis/ |title='Arrow Season 5: Echo Kellum Promoted to Series Regular as Curtis |publisher=tvline.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-05}}</ref> As a vigilante, Curtis uses the name \"Mr. Terrific\", which is a homage to his favorite wrestling champion [[Terry Sloane]], who went by the same name in the ring. Curtis leaves Team Arrow and Star City during [[Arrow (season 7)|season seven]], returning to take part in the season finale where he helps the team against the [[Ninth Circle]]. He is confirmed to be [[gay]] and is revealed to have a boyfriend named Paul (perhaps a gender-swapped version of his wife in the comics who was named Paula) who he plans to propose to.\n\n====Animation====\n[[File:MrTerrific.jpg|thumb|right|Mr. Terrific on ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' in the episode \"Destroyer\".]]\n* Michael Holt has made several [[cameo appearance]]s in the animated TV series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. He moves into a more prominent role in the series' final season, becoming the League's Coordinator and responsible for assigning tasks to the various heroes after [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]] resigns from active duty. The animated Mr. Terrific is voiced by former ''[[Third Watch]]'' star [[Michael Beach]].  It is unknown whether Mr. Terrific retains his invisibility to technology, as throughout the show the image of his face appears on several computer screens. His status as one of the world's smartest men is referred to in his full introductory appearance, and the T-Spheres are used in a subsequent episode.\n* Michael Holt appears in \"Hunted\", the premiere episode of ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', where he is voiced by [[Gary Anthony Williams]]. He is depicted as a businessman who is kidnapped along with [[Simon Stagg]] and [[Alfred Pennyworth]] by [[Professor Pyg]] and [[Mister Toad (comics)|Mr. Toad]]. The three of them are rescued by Batman.\n* Mister Terrific appears in ''[[Justice League Action]]'' episode \"The Cube Root\", voiced by [[Hannibal Buress]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Lucas Siegel |url=http://comicbook.com/dc/2016/06/06/new-justice-league-action-characters-officially-revealed/ |title=New Justice League Action Characters Officially Revealed |publisher=Comicbook.com |date=2016-06-05 |accessdate=2016-09-10}}</ref> This version is a former child prodigy who was the college roommate of Martin Stein (who claimed that Mister Terrific based his T-Spheres off his S-Cubes). Mister Terrific was establishing the science center dedicated to him which [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] attends until it is crashed by [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]] who hacks into Mister Terrific's T-Spheres. During Mister Terrific and Firestorm's fight with Calculator upon him causing a blackout, Calculator uses the hacked T-Spheres to split Firestorm back into Ronnie Raymond and Martin Stein where the hacked T-Spheres make off with Ronnie Raymond. This causes Mister Terrific and Martin Stein to work together to rescue Ronnie Raymond using the S-Cubes as a diversion so that Martin Stein can combine with Ronnie Raymond in order to form Firestorm. Mister Terrific and Firestorm reclaim control over the T-Spheres, defeat Calculator, and hand him over to the police. In \u201cThe Brain Buster\u201d, he is kidnapped along with other highly intelligent heroes and villains to participate in an initially unknown figure\u2019s series of contests to determine who is most intelligent. It is mentioned several times that he is \u201conly\u201d the third-smartest person in the world. In the end, he reveals that he prefers not to call too much attention to himself; he is the one who made the list, and gave himself third place.\n\n===Film===\n* In ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'', a picture of a Parallel Earth version of Mister Terrific, named '''Mister Horrific''', can be seen in [[Joker (character)|the Joker]]'s counterpart computer, as one of [[Superwoman]]'s made men.\n* An alternate universe version of Michael Holt appears in ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'', voiced by [[Arif S.

O. Morrow|Thomas Morrow]], and [[Stephen Shin]]), Michael Holt is killed with the other scientists by the [[Metal Men]] where he was impaled by the Wonderdroid. Will Magnus survived as he secretly orchestrated the attack on his fellow scientists.\n* Mr. Terrific appears in the 2019 [[DC Universe Original Movie]] ''[[Justice League vs. the Fatal Five]]'', voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/justice-league-fatal-five-voice-cast-set-1173352|title='Justice League vs. The Fatal Five' Sets Voice Cast (Exclusive) |last=Couch|first=Aaron|date=January 7, 2019|website=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> In this film, he serves as a foil to Tharok of the Fatal Five, often having to come up with ways to outwit his future know-how.\n\n===Video games===\n* Mr. Terrific makes a background cameo in the video game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''.

Its population {{as of|2006|lc=y}} is estimated to be 3,104 people living in a total area of 89.382&nbsp;km\u00b2. The city belongs to the [[Mesoregion (Brazil)|mesoregion]] of Sul and Sudoeste de Minas and to the [[microregion]] of [[Andrel\u00e2ndia]].\n\nThe municipality has an average annual median temperature of 21.2\u00b0C and the vegetation is predominantly that of the South American [[Atlantic Forest]]. With 98% of the population living withing the urban area, the city had two health facilities in 2009. The [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) of the municipality is 0.736, considered average in relation to the state.\n\nThe settlement of the municipality first began in the second half of the 19th century, with the construction of a stretch of the [[Estrada de Ferro Oeste de Minas]] railway. Notable features of the municipality include the handcrafts it produces and annual events such as the [[Carnival]] of Arantina.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Arantina.JPG|thumb|[[Level crossing]] in Arantina]]\nThe area of the current municipality first began to be settled during the 19th century, when the [[Estrada de Ferro Oeste de Minas]] (EFOM) railroad was being constructed. The railroad was intended to link the south of [[Goi\u00e1s]] state with the [[Angra dos Reis]] municipality in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] state, passing through [[Barra Mansa]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|RJ]] and operating both passenger and cargo trains. In Arantina there was a junction between the EFOM line and the Barra Line (the name is derived from [[Barra do Pira\u00ed]] municipality), connecting [[Bom Jardim de Minas]] municipality to the Barra Mansa line, now defunct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.estacoesferroviarias.com.br/rmv_linha_barra/bomjardim.htm|title=Bom Jardim de Minas|last=|first=|date=|website=Railway Stations of Brazil|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2 October 2010|language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Arantina (antina Arantes) |url=http://www.estacoesferroviarias.com.br/rmv_tronco/arantina.htm |website=Railway Stations of Brazil |accessdate=2 October 2010|language=pt}}</ref>\n\nA small town emerged around the Arantes railway station, then situated in the municipality of Mantiqueira (today [[Bom Jardim de Minas]]). For several years the town that is today Arantina belonged to Bom Jardim de Minas. The town was known as V\u00e1rzea do Paiol.

The railroad was intended to link the south of [[Goi\u00e1s]] state with the [[Angra dos Reis]] municipality in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] state, passing through [[Barra Mansa]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|RJ]] and operating both passenger and cargo trains. In Arantina there was a junction between the EFOM line and the Barra Line (the name is derived from [[Barra do Pira\u00ed]] municipality), connecting [[Bom Jardim de Minas]] municipality to the Barra Mansa line, now defunct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.estacoesferroviarias.com.br/rmv_linha_barra/bomjardim.htm|title=Bom Jardim de Minas|last=|first=|date=|website=Railway Stations of Brazil|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2 October 2010|language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Arantina (antina Arantes) |url=http://www.estacoesferroviarias.com.br/rmv_tronco/arantina.htm |website=Railway Stations of Brazil |accessdate=2 October 2010|language=pt}}</ref>\n\nA small town emerged around the Arantes railway station, then situated in the municipality of Mantiqueira (today [[Bom Jardim de Minas]]).

It was the first major battle fought between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces during the initial stages of the [[First Balkan War]], and revolved around the Sarandaporo pass, which connected [[Thessaly]] with central [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nDespite being perceived as impregnable by its defenders, the main body of the Greek forces managed to advance deep inside the pass, while auxiliary units broke through the Ottoman flanks. The Ottomans abandoned their defensive line during the night, fearing encirclement. The Greek victory at Sarandaporo opened the way for the capture of [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Kozani]].\n\n==Background==\nThe disastrous Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 exposed major flaws in the [[Greek Army]]'s organization, training and logistics. [[Georgios Theotokis]] was the first post-war Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new [[table of organization]] was introduced for the country's [[Greek Navy|navy]] and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited Cretan politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by re-arming and re-training the military, including extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchase of new weapons, and the recall of [[Military reserve force|reserve classes]] for training. The climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} \n\nAfter being informed of a Serbo-Bulgarian alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912, fearing that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bulgaria]]. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans declared mobilization on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October, with the latter declaring [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nGreece dispatched the [[Army of Epirus]] and the [[Army of Thessaly]] to its frontiers in [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] respectively. The latter numbered 100,000 men, and was divided into seven divisions: namely the [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st Infantry Division]], the [[2nd Infantry Division (Greece)|2nd Infantry Division]], the [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd Infantry Division]], the [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th Infantry Division]], the [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th Infantry Division]], the [[6th Infantry Division (Greece)|6th Infantry Division]] and the [[7th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|7th Infantry Division]], as well as a cavalry brigade and four independent [[Evzones]] battalions. The Army of Thessaly was commanded by Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=289\u2013290}} Facing the Greeks in Thessaly was the Ottoman [[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VIII Corps]] under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] which included three divisions: the regular (''nizamiye'') [[22nd Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|22nd Division]] and the reserve (''redif'') Nasli\u00e7 and Ayd\u0131n Divisions{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=170}} which, combined with the Ottoman garrisons in western Macedonia, totaled 35-40,000 men.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nThe Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned, with the garrisons at Melouna Pass, Profitis Ilias and Tsouka resisting for several hours before retreating. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked the hastily organized defenses north of [[Elassona]]. Elassona was defended by three infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and half a squadron of cavalry.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} The battle lasted for three hours, with the Ottomans retreating to avoid encirclement, thus giving the troops manning the main defensive line at Sarandaporo additional time to reinforce their positions.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=44\u201345}} The Greeks went on to advance {{convert|20|km|miles}} into the Elassona plateau without encountering any resistance.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=47}} Between 7 and 8 October, Greek troops regrouped in front of Sarandaporo and dispatched cavalry reconnaissance patrols towards the Ottoman positions locating the headquarters of the Ottoman VIII Provisional Corps at Hania Viglas and those of a reserve division at Glikovo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nSituated between the Vigla and Amorves mountains, Sarandaporo was a narrow mountain pass spanning some {{convert|7-8|km|miles|sigfig=1}}, the only one connecting Thessaly with central Macedonia. Having ceded Thessaly to Greece in the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)]], the Ottomans began methodically reinforcing their positions around Sarandaporo in anticipation of a future war.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=48}} The Ottomans had organized their defenses under the guidance of German military advisors, placing their artillery batteries and infantry in sheltered, camouflaged trenches on the ravine's steep slopes, allowing them to accurately fire along its entire length. Considered to be nearly impenetrable it was dubbed \"the graveyard of the Greek Army\" by Field Marshal [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=42}}\n\n==Battle==\n\nAt 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarandaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally, their advance hampered by accurate Ottoman rifle and artillery fire and the ruggedness of the terrain. In the meantime, the 4th Division conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of occupying the Porta Pass, and striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The 5th Division advanced further to the west towards the village of Zampourda which was situated on the other bank of the [[Haliacmon]], with the intention of protecting the left flank of the Greek forces emerging from the Sarandaporo pass. The cavalry brigade moved on the extreme west along the road towards [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], planning to block the bridge across the Haliacmon.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=51}} Attacking from the east of the pass the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment overcame stiff resistance at Vlacholeivado and captured the village, but failing to advance further due to heavy fog.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=207\u2013209}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} At 2 p.m., the main bulk of the Greek artillery was brought to the main line, joining the engagement. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the three divisions had halted some {{convert|500-700|m|miles}} from the Ottoman trenches intending to launch a final assault the following morning.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}\n\nThe 4th Division fought its way through the Metaxas and Rachovo villages. Upon reaching Porta Pass it engaged in a sanguine clash with the defenders, securing its objective at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=53}} The 5th Division and the Gennadis Evzone detachment were confronted by four Ottoman reserve battalions at Lazarades which held their ground until sunset.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The commander of the cavalry brigade ordered his unit to encamp at Loudani, refusing to advance further because of the resistance offered by the Ottomans at Lazarades. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Before retreating they fired a 20-minute artillery barrage on Greek positions along the entire frontline. Unaware of the Ottoman retreat the Greeks failed to use the opportunity and cut their access to the bridge across the Haliacmon. Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Divisions' seizure of Porta Pass, panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers began fleeing and abandoning their equipment.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=203\u2013205}} On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who abandoned over twenty [[Krupp gun]]s and engaged in a disorganized retreat.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}} The Greek cavalry's indecision once again enabled the fleeing Ottomans to safely reach Servia and [[Kozani]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division entered Servia, witnessing 75 to 90 severed human heads lined up on either side of one of its streets.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} Following the declaration of war local authorities had detained all the Christian dignitaries from Servia and the surrounding villages with the intention of massacring them, a plan that was thwarted by Ottoman officer Omer Bey. However, upon realizing the imminent defeat of the Ottoman troops at Sarandaporo, the town's Muslim population massacred 117 local Christians.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=58\u201359}} By 11 October, the entirety of the Army of Thessaly had reached the banks of the Haliacmon, while the Greek cavalry entered Kozani unopposed,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} opening the way for the Greeks to advance towards the Greek majority city of [[Thessaloniki]] and assist the Serbs at [[Bitola|Monastir]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=46}} On 13 October, the Greek army transferred its general headquarters to Kozani; the following day King [[George I of Greece|George I]] arrived in the city, ordering the army to march towards Thessaloniki and [[Veroia]].{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=241\u2013243}} Greek casualties in the battle of Sarandaporo numbered 182 killed and over 1,000 wounded,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} while the Ottomans lost 500 killed, 1,000 wounded, around 22 to 25 field artillery pieces captured and other significant material losses.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}\n\nBy May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts. The League had captured most of the Ottoman Empire's European territories and was rapidly approaching [[Constantinople]]. On 30 May, the two sides signed the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] which solidified the League's territorial ambitions, granting its members all Ottoman lands west of [[Enos, Turkey|Enos]] on the [[Aegean Sea]] and north of [[K\u0131y\u0131k\u00f6y|Midia]] on the [[Black Sea]], as well as [[Crete]]. The fate of [[Albania]] and the Ottoman-held Aegean islands was to be determined by the [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|Great

\n{{Campaignbox First Balkan War}}\n\nThe '''Battle of Sarantaporo''', also variously transliterated as '''Sarantaporon''' or '''Sarandaporon''' ({{lang-el|\u039c\u03ac\u03c7\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5

It was the first major battle fought between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces during the initial stages of the [[First Balkan War]], and revolved around the Sarandaporo pass, which connected [[Thessaly]] with central [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nDespite being perceived as impregnable by its defenders, the main body of the Greek forces managed to advance deep inside the pass, while auxiliary units broke through the Ottoman flanks. The Ottomans abandoned their defensive line during the night, fearing encirclement. The Greek victory at Sarandaporo opened the way for the capture of [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Kozani]].\n\n==Background==\nThe disastrous Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 exposed major flaws in the [[Greek Army]]'s organization, training and logistics. [[Georgios Theotokis]] was the first post-war Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new [[table of organization]] was introduced for the country's [[Greek Navy|navy]] and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited Cretan politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by re-arming and re-training the military, including extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchase of new weapons, and the recall of [[Military reserve force|reserve classes]] for training. The climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} \n\nAfter being informed of a Serbo-Bulgarian alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912, fearing that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bulgaria]]. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans declared mobilization on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October, with the latter declaring [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nGreece dispatched the [[Army of Epirus]] and the [[Army of Thessaly]] to its frontiers in [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] respectively. The latter numbered 100,000 men, and was divided into seven divisions: namely the [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st Infantry Division]], the [[2nd Infantry Division (Greece)|2nd Infantry Division]], the [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd Infantry Division]], the [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th Infantry Division]], the [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th Infantry Division]], the [[6th Infantry Division (Greece)|6th Infantry Division]] and the [[7th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|7th Infantry Division]], as well as a cavalry brigade and four independent [[Evzones]] battalions. The Army of Thessaly was commanded by Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=289\u2013290}} Facing the Greeks in Thessaly was the Ottoman [[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VIII Corps]] under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] which included three divisions: the regular (''nizamiye'') [[22nd Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|22nd Division]] and the reserve (''redif'') Nasli\u00e7 and Ayd\u0131n Divisions{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=170}} which, combined with the Ottoman garrisons in western Macedonia, totaled 35-40,000 men.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nThe Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned, with the garrisons at Melouna Pass, Profitis Ilias and Tsouka resisting for several hours before retreating. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked the hastily organized defenses north of [[Elassona]]. Elassona was defended by three infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and half a squadron of cavalry.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} The battle lasted for three hours, with the Ottomans retreating to avoid encirclement, thus giving the troops manning the main defensive line at Sarandaporo additional time to reinforce their positions.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=44\u201345}} The Greeks went on to advance {{convert|20|km|miles}} into the Elassona plateau without encountering any resistance.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=47}} Between 7 and 8 October, Greek troops regrouped in front of Sarandaporo and dispatched cavalry reconnaissance patrols towards the Ottoman positions locating the headquarters of the Ottoman VIII Provisional Corps at Hania Viglas and those of a reserve division at Glikovo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nSituated between the Vigla and Amorves mountains, Sarandaporo was a narrow mountain pass spanning some {{convert|7-8|km|miles|sigfig=1}}, the only one connecting Thessaly with central Macedonia. Having ceded Thessaly to Greece in the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)]], the Ottomans began methodically reinforcing their positions around Sarandaporo in anticipation of a future war.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=48}} The Ottomans had organized their defenses under the guidance of German military advisors, placing their artillery batteries and infantry in sheltered, camouflaged trenches on the ravine's steep slopes, allowing them to accurately fire along its entire length. Considered to be nearly impenetrable it was dubbed \"the graveyard of the Greek Army\" by Field Marshal [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=42}}\n\n==Battle==\n\nAt 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarandaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally, their advance hampered by accurate Ottoman rifle and artillery fire and the ruggedness of the terrain. In the meantime, the 4th Division conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of occupying the Porta Pass, and striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The 5th Division advanced further to the west towards the village of Zampourda which was situated on the other bank of the [[Haliacmon]], with the intention of protecting the left flank of the Greek forces emerging from the Sarandaporo pass. The cavalry brigade moved on the extreme west along the road towards [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], planning to block the bridge across the Haliacmon.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=51}} Attacking from the east of the pass the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment overcame stiff resistance at Vlacholeivado and captured the village, but failing to advance further due to heavy fog.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=207\u2013209}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} At 2 p.m., the main bulk of the Greek artillery was brought to the main line, joining the engagement. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the three divisions had halted some {{convert|500-700|m|miles}} from the Ottoman trenches intending to launch a final assault the following morning.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}\n\nThe 4th Division fought its way through the Metaxas and Rachovo villages. Upon reaching Porta Pass it engaged in a sanguine clash with the defenders, securing its objective at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=53}} The 5th Division and the Gennadis Evzone detachment were confronted by four Ottoman reserve battalions at Lazarades which held their ground until sunset.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The commander of the cavalry brigade ordered his unit to encamp at Loudani, refusing to advance further because of the resistance offered by the Ottomans at Lazarades. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Before retreating they fired a 20-minute artillery barrage on Greek positions along the entire frontline. Unaware of the Ottoman retreat the Greeks failed to use the opportunity and cut their access to the bridge across the Haliacmon. Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Divisions' seizure of Porta Pass, panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers began fleeing and abandoning their equipment.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=203\u2013205}} On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who abandoned over twenty [[Krupp gun]]s and engaged in a disorganized retreat.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}} The Greek cavalry's indecision once again enabled the fleeing Ottomans to safely reach Servia and [[Kozani]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division entered Servia, witnessing 75 to 90 severed human heads lined up on either side of one of its streets.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} Following the declaration of war local authorities had detained all the Christian dignitaries from Servia and the surrounding villages with the intention of massacring them, a plan that was thwarted by Ottoman officer Omer Bey. However, upon realizing the imminent defeat of the Ottoman troops at Sarandaporo, the town's Muslim population massacred 117 local Christians.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=58\u201359}} By 11 October, the entirety of the Army of Thessaly had reached the banks of the Haliacmon, while the Greek cavalry entered Kozani unopposed,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} opening the way for the Greeks to advance towards the Greek majority city of [[Thessaloniki]] and assist the Serbs at [[Bitola|Monastir]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=46}} On 13 October, the Greek army transferred its general headquarters to Kozani; the following day King [[George I of Greece|George I]] arrived in the city, ordering the army to march towards Thessaloniki and [[Veroia]].{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=241\u2013243}} Greek casualties in the battle of Sarandaporo numbered 182 killed and over 1,000 wounded,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} while the Ottomans lost 500 killed, 1,000 wounded, around 22 to 25 field artillery pieces captured and other significant material losses.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}\n\nBy May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts. The League had captured most of the Ottoman Empire's European territories and was rapidly approaching [[Constantinople]]. On 30 May, the two sides signed the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] which solidified the League's territorial ambitions, granting its members all Ottoman lands west of [[Enos, Turkey|Enos]] on the [[Aegean Sea]] and north of [[K\u0131y\u0131k\u00f6y|Midia]] on the [[Black Sea]], as well as [[Crete]].

After 1945, Koml\u00f3 was among those settlements whose expansion into a city was a somewhat forced affair directed by political decisions. A determining factor of its development was the role in coal mining. After more than 100 years of operation mining in the area ceased on 1 January 2000.\n\n== Sightseeing ==\n\n[[File:Komlo.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Remains of medieval chapel in Koml\u00f3]]\n\nThe ruin of Gothic medieval chapel is situated (dates from 13-14th) behind the church of Koml\u00f3.

After 1945, Koml\u00f3 was among those settlements whose expansion into a city was a somewhat forced affair directed by political decisions. A determining factor of its development was the role in coal mining. After more than 100 years of operation mining in the area ceased on 1 January 2000.\n\n== Sightseeing ==\n\n[[File:Komlo.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Remains of medieval chapel in Koml\u00f3]]\n\nThe ruin of Gothic medieval chapel is situated (dates from 13-14th) behind the church of Koml\u00f3.

Upon analyzing the security footage of the leak, Superior Spider-Man finds small spiders and figures out that Spiders-Man of Earth-11580 was responsible. Spiders-Man of Earth-11580 attacks them as Superior Spider-Man uses a Wave Disruption Field to trap the main spider. Getting a confession from him, Superior Spider-Man reveals to Modell about the Norman Osborn of Earth-44145 who operates as the Spider-Man of his reality.

Syed initially marries girlfriend [[Amira Shah]] ([[Preeya Kalidas]]) but later [[coming out|comes out]], and enters a relationship with Christian, despite the pressures of his family and his [[Muslim]] faith.\n\nIn 2009, it was announced actor Marc Elliott would be joining the ''[[EastEnders]]'' cast. In an interview with Digital Spy, Elliott described his arrival: \"It is so exciting to join the cast of EastEnders and to be working with actors such as Nina Wadia and Nitin Ganatra who I have admired for many years. \"The Masood family have really made a name for themselves in the Square and it will be interesting see how Syed plans to stir things up!\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Fletcher|first=Alex|title=Marc Elliott cast as 'Enders Syed Masood|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a147354/marc-elliott-cast-as-enders-syed-masood.html|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=2 July 2011|date=2009-02-20}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2012, it was announced that Elliott would be leaving ''EastEnders'' alongside John Partridge.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19520822 | work=BBC News | title=EastEnders' gay couple Syed and Christian to leave show | date=7 September 2012}}</ref> He departed on 15 November 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/information/a130011/soaplands-joiners-movers-and-leavers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DqI36WcC?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/information/a130011/soaplands-joiners-movers-and-leavers.html |archivedate=21 January 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===Backstory===\nSyed is a [[British Pakistani]] and is the eldest son of [[Masood Ahmed]] ([[Nitin Ganatra]]) and [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]), and brother of [[Tamwar Masood|Tamwar]] ([[Himesh Patel]]) and [[Shabnam Masood|Shabnam]] ([[Zahra Ahmadi]]). Prior to the Masoods' arrival in [[Walford]], Syed was estranged from his family for four years. He stole from the family business, almost bankrupting them. His father took the blame, but exiled Syed from the family. Syed moved to the north of England and worked in the property industry.<ref name=\"DS\"/>\n\n===2009\u20132012===\nSyed resumes contact with his family when he experiences financial difficulties. Although Masood reveals his previous theft, Zainab forgives her son, and invites him to move into the family home when he is evicted for failing to pay his rent. Syed introduces his family to his girlfriend, [[Amira Masood|Amira Shah]] ([[Preeya Kalidas]]), who soon moves to Walford to be near him. He begins working for his parents' catering company, and develops an attraction to his colleague, [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (performer)|John Partridge]]). The two have sex, and Syed admits that he has had [[one-night stand]]s with men before. Conflicted by his Muslim faith, Syed proposes to Amira. He continues to see Christian, whose niece [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Melissa Suffield]]) sees them kissing and blackmails him. Christian and Syed declare their love for one another, but when Masood is involved in a car accident, Syed believes he is being punished and terminates their relationship. A hurt Christian tries to move away from Walford, but is unable to forget about Syed, and returns in an attempt to deter him from marriage. On his wedding day, Syed admits to Christian that he is gay and in love with him, but feels unable to come out because of his family and faith. Zainab discovers the truth, but implores Syed to go through with his marriage. He does so, but is initially unable to consummate it. He tells his mother that the thought of sex with Amira makes him feel physically sick. He wishes to confess his sexuality, but Zainab warns him against shaming the family and threatens to disown him. Syed attempts to commit to his marriage; he has sex with Amira, and suggests starting a family.\n\nDespite his intentions, Syed resumes his relationship with Christian. Amira becomes pregnant but it was her misunderstanding and not real (but finally she will at the time she leaves, although she will not tell it to Syed). Syed intends to continue the affair, to Christian's displeasure. Syed accidentally ends up revealing to Amira that he is gay. Amira's father [[Qadim Shah]] ([[Ramon Tikaram]]) becomes very mad at him. Amira terminates their relationship and leaves Walford. Christian is attacked by Qadim, and rejects Syed when he visits him. He calls him a coward for trying to appease his family. Syed is later told to find a new mosque to attend, and implored to leave Walford by Christian's best friend [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]). He takes an overdose, and regains consciousness to hear Zainab telling him it would be better if he was dead. She burns his belongings and attempts to evict him from the family home, but is stopped by Masood. Syed begins attending therapy which he believes will cure him of his homosexuality, though it proves unsuccessful. Syed knows Christian still has feelings for him, but when he visits Christian, he rejects Syed again. The following day, Syed tells Christian he chooses him and needs his help, and that he is both gay and Muslim. The two move in together, and Syed is disowned by his parents.\n\nSyed becomes Christian's personal assistant and finds a new mosque. His parents help him escape from [[Queen Vic Fire Week|a fire]], but they return to ignoring him in the aftermath. Trying to move on with his life, Syed starts his own massage business. He discovers that his father almost had an affair, and threatens to tell his mother, but decides against it. He is hurt when Christian kisses another man at a party, but is able to forgive him. They decide to have a child, although Syed is at first against the idea. A drunken Roxy offers to be the [[surrogate mother]] and although Syed tells Christian that it is happening too quickly, Roxy has already impregnated herself with Christian's sperm. The insemination is unsuccessful however. Syed rents a room at Roxy's salon for his massage therapy business, but steals her client list and plans to go into business with Roxy's manager, [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]). He and Christian attend Tamwar's engagement party together, much to the disgust of his parents. The roof of their restaurant collapses and knocks Syed unconscious, Christian and [[Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]) come to his aid. Zainab is led to believe his condition is critical and visits him in hospital, but rejects him once he is discharged. Zainab visits Syed after being urged to by Yusef, but she leaves after a while admitting it was a mistake. However, when Masood lets Zainab down, she contacts Syed and they meet in a caf\u00e9. Masood discovers them but Syed says he cannot stop them seeing each other. Syed confronts Zainab and Masood in The Queen Victoria, telling them that if they do not accept Christian as Syed's lover then there is nothing more to say. Syed calls Masood a hypocrite for gambling and tells Zainab that they are in no position to judge him. He then tells them to live their lives and he will live his. Eventually, Syed and Zainab make amends. Christian and Syed try to pursue an adoption and Christian finds a new flat for them. However, Syed almost changes his mind and the couple split up until Syed realises that he does want a child. Syed tells his family he and Christian are engaged at a family meal, but they do not take the news well.\n\nSyed decides to find Amira so he can get a divorce, but has trouble finding her and Christian worries about Qadim getting involved in their lives again. It is revealed Amira is practically being held hostage by her father and that she had Syed's baby, a girl called [[Yasmin Masood|Yasmin]]. Eventually Amira comes to Walford and wants Syed to be part of Yasmin's life as long as Christian is not part of it. Syed and Christian agree that their relationship comes first and they will go through the courts to gain access. However, when Christian is asleep, Syed sneaks out to meet Yasmin. Syed continues to secretly see Yasmin and Amira, but when Christian learns of this, he confronts Syed and declares that Syed has to choose between him and the baby. However, he relents and gives Syed his blessing to see his child. Once Zainab knows about Yasmin, she and Amira both try to manipulate Syed into spending more time with his daughter, at the expense of Christian. Christian reveals that he had a paternity test performed, which proves that Syed is not the father of Yasmin. Syed is devastated, but Amira continues to claim that he is the father. It later emerges that it was Yusef who falsified the paternity test. Syed and Christian then let Amira and Yasmin stay with them, as they have nowhere else to go. When Christian is falsely accused of touching 15-year-old [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Joshua Pascoe), Syed and Christian argue, which leads to Christian breaking up with Syed and leaving Walford. Amira tells Syed that she has a business opportunity in Pakistan, and invites Syed to join her and Yasmin there. Syed is initially reluctant, but after Christian's sister [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) says that Christian is unlikely to reunite with him, Syed considers the move. Christian returns to Walford at Christmas, and when he sees Syed and Amira, he mocks them for behaving like a couple. However, Syed is determined to win Christian back and insists on a divorce, though Amira refuses, so he brings Qadim back to convince her. Christian and Syed then reunite, and Amira agrees to a divorce, but tells Syed that she will not leave Walford with Qadim. Amira then starts a brief relationship with [[Anthony Moon]] ([[Matt Lapinskas]]), and Syed and Amira start their business. However, Amira soon tires of Walford without a husband, and leaves her daughter Yasmin in the care of Syed and Christian. Syed is relieved when Christian finally reconciles with the Masood family, and Zainab invites Christian to a family dinner and to the mosque.\n\nSyed's business ventures fail and he is in debt to a supplier. When Zainab puts Syed in charge of Tamwar's restaurant, he forges Tamwar's signature on a cheque to pay off his debt, but leaves the restaurant in debt with the mortgage unpaid. Syed meets [[Danny Pennant]] ([[Gary Lucy]]), and they are attracted to each other. Syed invests money with Danny and borrows \u00a3500 back, but eventually the investment falls through, and Zainab also lends Syed money, taken from Kamil and Tamwar's trust funds. Syed and Danny kiss, but Syed regrets it and goes on to marry Christian in a civil ceremony after confessing the kiss. However, after the wedding, which takes place in the restaurant, bailiffs arrive as four months' mortgage is overdue. Syed tries to leave but eventually decides to stay, revealing that the debt is his fault and the money taken from the accounts was for him. Christian stays with him, saying they can sort the debts together. Syed is, however, under pressure from Danny to return the \u00a3500. Christian sees texts from Danny on Syed's phone and meets Danny, and Danny tells Christian he had sex with Syed. Christian punches Danny. Syed later sees Christian covered in blood and bruises. Christian lies that it was a homophobic attack, and Syed calls the police without Christian's knowledge. However, Christian is arrested for the assault on Danny. Danny tells Syed he will only retract his police statement if Syed returns \u00a3500 he owes. However, Masood threatens to tell the police about Danny's dodgy investments, so Danny withdraws the allegations. Christian asks Syed for his reassurance of their love and marriage or he will end their relationship. Syed cannot give it, so Christian moves out. Amira returns, wanting to take Yasmin to live with her and her new fianc\u00e9 in Birmingham. Syed allows Amira to take her, not telling Christian, who is angry when he finds out. Christian plans to move to America to live with Jane. Syed discovers this through Masood, and brands Christian a hypocrite. Zainab and Lucy lock the pair in the Masoods' restaurant where they reunite. Refusing to leave without Syed, Christian has Jane book them both tickets and they leave together to go to America, planning to live closer to Amira and Yasmin once they return to the UK.\n\n==Creation==\nSyed had been mentioned regularly since the Masoods arrived in Walford in 2007, but was not introduced on-screen until April 2009. Elliott was cast in the role after a successful reading with Ganatra and Wadia. Eliott was told he had been successfully cast just before Christmas 2008.<ref name=\"DS\">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a152545/marc-elliott-syed-masood-eastenders.html|title=Marc Elliott (Syed Masood, 'EastEnders')|publisher=Digital Spy|first=Kris|last=Green|date=14 April 2009|accessdate=14 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with entertainment and media website [[Digital Spy]], Elliott commented on his casting, and the \"responsibility\" with regard to playing a character that viewers already had preconceived images about: \"I hope I'm what everyone expects! I was given a biography when I got the part [...]. It's a process all characters go through to decide what they'd do in certain situations, given certain choices and basic things, for example who they'd like or dislike on [[Albert Square|[Albert] Square]]. That helped to cement the character in my head [...]. He's such a complex character. It's such a collaborative experience. I'm discovering things about Syed at the same time as the rest of the team.\"<ref name=\"DS\"/> To prepare for the role, Elliott watched documentaries such as ''[[A Jihad for Love]]'' which focus on the ways in which gay Muslims reconcile their faith with their sexuality.<ref name=\"bbc17sep\"/>\n\n===Characterisation===\nElliott's character is apparently a smooth-talking natural charmer who knows how to get ahead in business. He is also described as \"handsome, suave and sophisticated\". Executive Producer [[Diederick Santer]] described Syed as \"Entrepreneurial, reckless, dashing and complicated, [he's] set to bring surprises and chaos to the Masood family.\"<ref name=\"new masood\"/> Elliott revealed that the character is driven by money: \"It's all about the cash. His drive is to be successful and there's nothing really Machiavellian about him \u2014 well, there potentially is \u2014 but he just wants the money because he believes he can use it to make more. [Syed]'s very cocksure and confident about himself but the absurd thing is that he hasn't learned from his past mistakes.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a152549/elliott-syed-hasnt-learned-from-his-mistakes.html|title=Elliott: 'Syed hasn't learned from his mistakes'|first=Kris|last=Green|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=14 April 2009|accessdate=14 April 2009}}</ref> He also says that \"Syed manipulates people to his own ends. He's charming, confident and reckless.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/interviews/eastenders-syed-masood-arrives/5585|title=EastEnders: Syed Masood arrives!|work=[[What's On TV]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=21 April 2009|accessdate=28 April 2009}}</ref> Wadia described the character as a \"dark horse\", saying, \"What I like about the way they've introduced him is that you get to see the gentle side of him first \u2014 the repentant side. Then you see what he's really like over the subsequent weeks.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a152829/wadia-syeds-a-dark-horse.html|title=Wadia: 'Syed's a dark horse'|first=Kris|last=Green|publisher=Digital Spy|date=15 April 2009|accessdate=24 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nShortly after his arrival, Syed's girlfriend, [[Amira Shah]], was introduced played by [[Preeya Kalidas]]. Elliott has described the relationship between the characters and Syed's motivation: \"Well, she's a rich daddy's girl and it's hard not to make the association between Syed and money. There's certainly an honest attraction there and I think he does love her. But the money that her father has might be an additional aspect of their relationship.

To all intents and purposes, Syed is a 'good' Muslim man: he doesn't drink, smoke or engage in sex before marriage. But he struggles with his sexuality when he finds himself drawn to Christian and he believes this goes against his faith.

In an interview with Digital Spy, Elliott described his arrival: \"It is so exciting to join the cast of EastEnders and to be working with actors such as Nina Wadia and Nitin Ganatra who I have admired for many years. \"The Masood family have really made a name for themselves in the Square and it will be interesting see how Syed plans to stir things up!\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Fletcher|first=Alex|title=Marc Elliott cast as 'Enders Syed Masood|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a147354/marc-elliott-cast-as-enders-syed-masood.html|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=2 July 2011|date=2009-02-20}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2012, it was announced that Elliott would be leaving ''EastEnders'' alongside John Partridge.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19520822 | work=BBC News | title=EastEnders' gay couple Syed and Christian to leave show | date=7 September 2012}}</ref> He departed on 15 November 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/information/a130011/soaplands-joiners-movers-and-leavers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DqI36WcC?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/information/a130011/soaplands-joiners-movers-and-leavers.html |archivedate=21 January 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===Backstory===\nSyed is a [[British Pakistani]] and is the eldest son of [[Masood Ahmed]] ([[Nitin Ganatra]]) and [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]), and brother of [[Tamwar Masood|Tamwar]] ([[Himesh Patel]]) and [[Shabnam Masood|Shabnam]] ([[Zahra Ahmadi]]). Prior to the Masoods' arrival in [[Walford]], Syed was estranged from his family for four years. He stole from the family business, almost bankrupting them. His father took the blame, but exiled Syed from the family. Syed moved to the north of England and worked in the property industry.<ref name=\"DS\"/>\n\n===2009\u20132012===\nSyed resumes contact with his family when he experiences financial difficulties. Although Masood reveals his previous theft, Zainab forgives her son, and invites him to move into the family home when he is evicted for failing to pay his rent. Syed introduces his family to his girlfriend, [[Amira Masood|Amira Shah]] ([[Preeya Kalidas]]), who soon moves to Walford to be near him. He begins working for his parents' catering company, and develops an attraction to his colleague, [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (performer)|John Partridge]]). The two have sex, and Syed admits that he has had [[one-night stand]]s with men before. Conflicted by his Muslim faith, Syed proposes to Amira. He continues to see Christian, whose niece [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Melissa Suffield]]) sees them kissing and blackmails him. Christian and Syed declare their love for one another, but when Masood is involved in a car accident, Syed believes he is being punished and terminates their relationship. A hurt Christian tries to move away from Walford, but is unable to forget about Syed, and returns in an attempt to deter him from marriage. On his wedding day, Syed admits to Christian that he is gay and in love with him, but feels unable to come out because of his family and faith. Zainab discovers the truth, but implores Syed to go through with his marriage. He does so, but is initially unable to consummate it. He tells his mother that the thought of sex with Amira makes him feel physically sick. He wishes to confess his sexuality, but Zainab warns him against shaming the family and threatens to disown him. Syed attempts to commit to his marriage; he has sex with Amira, and suggests starting a family.\n\nDespite his intentions, Syed resumes his relationship with Christian. Amira becomes pregnant but it was her misunderstanding and not real (but finally she will at the time she leaves, although she will not tell it to Syed). Syed intends to continue the affair, to Christian's displeasure. Syed accidentally ends up revealing to Amira that he is gay. Amira's father [[Qadim Shah]] ([[Ramon Tikaram]]) becomes very mad at him. Amira terminates their relationship and leaves Walford. Christian is attacked by Qadim, and rejects Syed when he visits him. He calls him a coward for trying to appease his family. Syed is later told to find a new mosque to attend, and implored to leave Walford by Christian's best friend [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]). He takes an overdose, and regains consciousness to hear Zainab telling him it would be better if he was dead. She burns his belongings and attempts to evict him from the family home, but is stopped by Masood. Syed begins attending therapy which he believes will cure him of his homosexuality, though it proves unsuccessful. Syed knows Christian still has feelings for him, but when he visits Christian, he rejects Syed again. The following day, Syed tells Christian he chooses him and needs his help, and that he is both gay and Muslim. The two move in together, and Syed is disowned by his parents.\n\nSyed becomes Christian's personal assistant and finds a new mosque. His parents help him escape from [[Queen Vic Fire Week|a fire]], but they return to ignoring him in the aftermath. Trying to move on with his life, Syed starts his own massage business. He discovers that his father almost had an affair, and threatens to tell his mother, but decides against it. He is hurt when Christian kisses another man at a party, but is able to forgive him. They decide to have a child, although Syed is at first against the idea. A drunken Roxy offers to be the [[surrogate mother]] and although Syed tells Christian that it is happening too quickly, Roxy has already impregnated herself with Christian's sperm. The insemination is unsuccessful however. Syed rents a room at Roxy's salon for his massage therapy business, but steals her client list and plans to go into business with Roxy's manager, [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]). He and Christian attend Tamwar's engagement party together, much to the disgust of his parents. The roof of their restaurant collapses and knocks Syed unconscious, Christian and [[Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]) come to his aid. Zainab is led to believe his condition is critical and visits him in hospital, but rejects him once he is discharged. Zainab visits Syed after being urged to by Yusef, but she leaves after a while admitting it was a mistake. However, when Masood lets Zainab down, she contacts Syed and they meet in a caf\u00e9. Masood discovers them but Syed says he cannot stop them seeing each other. Syed confronts Zainab and Masood in The Queen Victoria, telling them that if they do not accept Christian as Syed's lover then there is nothing more to say. Syed calls Masood a hypocrite for gambling and tells Zainab that they are in no position to judge him. He then tells them to live their lives and he will live his. Eventually, Syed and Zainab make amends. Christian and Syed try to pursue an adoption and Christian finds a new flat for them. However, Syed almost changes his mind and the couple split up until Syed realises that he does want a child. Syed tells his family he and Christian are engaged at a family meal, but they do not take the news well.\n\nSyed decides to find Amira so he can get a divorce, but has trouble finding her and Christian worries about Qadim getting involved in their lives again. It is revealed Amira is practically being held hostage by her father and that she had Syed's baby, a girl called [[Yasmin Masood|Yasmin]]. Eventually Amira comes to Walford and wants Syed to be part of Yasmin's life as long as Christian is not part of it. Syed and Christian agree that their relationship comes first and they will go through the courts to gain access. However, when Christian is asleep, Syed sneaks out to meet Yasmin. Syed continues to secretly see Yasmin and Amira, but when Christian learns of this, he confronts Syed and declares that Syed has to choose between him and the baby. However, he relents and gives Syed his blessing to see his child. Once Zainab knows about Yasmin, she and Amira both try to manipulate Syed into spending more time with his daughter, at the expense of Christian. Christian reveals that he had a paternity test performed, which proves that Syed is not the father of Yasmin. Syed is devastated, but Amira continues to claim that he is the father. It later emerges that it was Yusef who falsified the paternity test. Syed and Christian then let Amira and Yasmin stay with them, as they have nowhere else to go. When Christian is falsely accused of touching 15-year-old [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Joshua Pascoe), Syed and Christian argue, which leads to Christian breaking up with Syed and leaving Walford. Amira tells Syed that she has a business opportunity in Pakistan, and invites Syed to join her and Yasmin there. Syed is initially reluctant, but after Christian's sister [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) says that Christian is unlikely to reunite with him, Syed considers the move. Christian returns to Walford at Christmas, and when he sees Syed and Amira, he mocks them for behaving like a couple. However, Syed is determined to win Christian back and insists on a divorce, though Amira refuses, so he brings Qadim back to convince her. Christian and Syed then reunite, and Amira agrees to a divorce, but tells Syed that she will not leave Walford with Qadim. Amira then starts a brief relationship with [[Anthony Moon]] ([[Matt Lapinskas]]), and Syed and Amira start their business. However, Amira soon tires of Walford without a husband, and leaves her daughter Yasmin in the care of Syed and Christian. Syed is relieved when Christian finally reconciles with the Masood family, and Zainab invites Christian to a family dinner and to the mosque.\n\nSyed's business ventures fail and he is in debt to a supplier. When Zainab puts Syed in charge of Tamwar's restaurant, he forges Tamwar's signature on a cheque to pay off his debt, but leaves the restaurant in debt with the mortgage unpaid. Syed meets [[Danny Pennant]] ([[Gary Lucy]]), and they are attracted to each other. Syed invests money with Danny and borrows \u00a3500 back, but eventually the investment falls through, and Zainab also lends Syed money, taken from Kamil and Tamwar's trust funds. Syed and Danny kiss, but Syed regrets it and goes on to marry Christian in a civil ceremony after confessing the kiss. However, after the wedding, which takes place in the restaurant, bailiffs arrive as four months' mortgage is overdue. Syed tries to leave but eventually decides to stay, revealing that the debt is his fault and the money taken from the accounts was for him. Christian stays with him, saying they can sort the debts together. Syed is, however, under pressure from Danny to return the \u00a3500. Christian sees texts from Danny on Syed's phone and meets Danny, and Danny tells Christian he had sex with Syed. Christian punches Danny. Syed later sees Christian covered in blood and bruises. Christian lies that it was a homophobic attack, and Syed calls the police without Christian's knowledge. However, Christian is arrested for the assault on Danny. Danny tells Syed he will only retract his police statement if Syed returns \u00a3500 he owes. However, Masood threatens to tell the police about Danny's dodgy investments, so Danny withdraws the allegations. Christian asks Syed for his reassurance of their love and marriage or he will end their relationship. Syed cannot give it, so Christian moves out. Amira returns, wanting to take Yasmin to live with her and her new fianc\u00e9 in Birmingham. Syed allows Amira to take her, not telling Christian, who is angry when he finds out. Christian plans to move to America to live with Jane. Syed discovers this through Masood, and brands Christian a hypocrite. Zainab and Lucy lock the pair in the Masoods' restaurant where they reunite. Refusing to leave without Syed, Christian has Jane book them both tickets and they leave together to go to America, planning to live closer to Amira and Yasmin once they return to the UK.\n\n==Creation==\nSyed had been mentioned regularly since the Masoods arrived in Walford in 2007, but was not introduced on-screen until April 2009. Elliott was cast in the role after a successful reading with Ganatra and Wadia. Eliott was told he had been successfully cast just before Christmas 2008.<ref name=\"DS\">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a152545/marc-elliott-syed-masood-eastenders.html|title=Marc Elliott (Syed Masood, 'EastEnders')|publisher=Digital Spy|first=Kris|last=Green|date=14 April 2009|accessdate=14 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with entertainment and media website [[Digital Spy]], Elliott commented on his casting, and the \"responsibility\" with regard to playing a character that viewers already had preconceived images about: \"I hope I'm what everyone expects! I was given a biography when I got the part [...]. It's a process all characters go through to decide what they'd do in certain situations, given certain choices and basic things, for example who they'd like or dislike on [[Albert Square|[Albert] Square]]. That helped to cement the character in my head [...]. He's such a complex character. It's such a collaborative experience. I'm discovering things about Syed at the same time as the rest of the team.\"<ref name=\"DS\"/> To prepare for the role, Elliott watched documentaries such as ''[[A Jihad for Love]]'' which focus on the ways in which gay Muslims reconcile their faith with their sexuality.<ref name=\"bbc17sep\"/>\n\n===Characterisation===\nElliott's character is apparently a smooth-talking natural charmer who knows how to get ahead in business. He is also described as \"handsome, suave and sophisticated\". Executive Producer [[Diederick Santer]] described Syed as \"Entrepreneurial, reckless, dashing and complicated, [he's] set to bring surprises and chaos to the Masood family.\"<ref name=\"new masood\"/> Elliott revealed that the character is driven by money: \"It's all about the cash. His drive is to be successful and there's nothing really Machiavellian about him \u2014 well, there potentially is \u2014 but he just wants the money because he believes he can use it to make more. [Syed]'s very cocksure and confident about himself but the absurd thing is that he hasn't learned from his past mistakes.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a152549/elliott-syed-hasnt-learned-from-his-mistakes.html|title=Elliott: 'Syed hasn't learned from his mistakes'|first=Kris|last=Green|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=14 April 2009|accessdate=14 April 2009}}</ref> He also says that \"Syed manipulates people to his own ends.

Then you see what he's really like over the subsequent weeks.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a152829/wadia-syeds-a-dark-horse.html|title=Wadia: 'Syed's a dark horse'|first=Kris|last=Green|publisher=Digital Spy|date=15 April 2009|accessdate=24 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nShortly after his arrival, Syed's girlfriend, [[Amira Shah]], was introduced played by [[Preeya Kalidas]]. Elliott has described the relationship between the characters and Syed's motivation: \"Well, she's a rich daddy's girl and it's hard not to make the association between Syed and money. There's certainly an honest attraction there and I think he does love her. But the money that her father has might be an additional aspect of their relationship. Amira comes in and ruffles a few feathers, especially Zainab's. Obviously with Syed being a mummy's boy, she has to have her say. I don't think Zainab would be happy with anyone that Syed's with \u2014 they'd have to be absolutely perfect. Mummy Masood will be doing a lot of meddling and locking horns with Amira.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a152548/syed-masood-on-nina-preeya-and-the-apprentice.html|title=Syed Masood on Nina, Preeya and 'The Apprentice'|first=Kris|last=Green|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=14 April 2009|accessdate=14 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2009, Syed begins an affair with gay character [[Christian Clarke]], played by [[John Partridge (performer)|John Partridge]], a storyline that will see Syed \"torn between his feelings and [his] faith\".<ref name=\"gay\">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a157415/enders-syed-for-gay-love-plot.html|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|title='Enders Syed for gay love plot|first=Kris|last=Green|date=28 May 2009|accessdate=28 May 2009}}</ref> The storyline is said to be controversial, as [[Homosexuality and Islam|homosexuality is strictly forbidden in Islam]].<ref name=\"alarabiya\"/> However, Santer explained that the storyline will not be a moral tale, but one of human interest, adding: \"In this regard, it's not dissimilar to the story we told when [[Dot Cotton]]'s deeply-held Christian beliefs came into conflict with her desire to alleviate [[Ethel Skinner|Ethel]]'s suffering [in a [[euthanasia]] plotline]. To all intents and purposes, Syed is a 'good' Muslim man: he doesn't drink, smoke or engage in sex before marriage. But he struggles with his sexuality when he finds himself drawn to Christian and he believes this goes against his faith. This is not a story about Syed and Christian's physical relationship \u2014 we don't see anything beyond one kiss. It's more about the inner turmoil and conflict Syed endures trying to remain true to his faith while questioning his sexuality. Syed has already been ostracised from his family and community once and if he's true to his heart he risks losing his family again.\"<ref name=\"gay\"/> Santer also said that ''EastEnders'' always tries to \"reflect modern life in multicultural Britain and [tell] social issue stories relevant to [its] diverse audience.\"<ref name=\"gay\"/> Elliott commented on the storyline, saying: \"I think ''EastEnders'' would be doing the programme a disservice if they didn't give a voice to various communities. I think that's really important because I think London is a very ethnically diverse multicultural place, and ''EastEnders'' has a job to reflect that in the story lines it gives people and the characters they have on board.\"<ref name=\"gaybbc\"/> This plot was researched with help from academics, gay Muslim support groups and members of the [[Muslim Council of Great Britain]], and will contain a \"balance of opinions\" from various other characters, including Syed's mother Zainab.<ref name=\"gayguardian\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/may/28/eastenders-gay-love-affair|title=EastEnders: Muslim character to have gay love affair|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|first=Leigh|last=Holmwood|author2=McLean, Gareth |date=28 May 2009|accessdate=28 May 2009|location=London}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked in a BBC interview in September 2009 if Syed is gay or bisexual, Elliott answered: \"I think at this stage there's confusion about his sexuality. He knows he likes Christian but it hasn't really been stipulated. He wants to settle down and have children with Amira because that's what's expected of him, but he finds himself unavoidably attracted to Christian so that's what's going on in his head.\"<ref name=\"bbc17sep\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters_cast/interviews/interview_marc_e_n1.shtml|title=Marc Elliott 17.09.2009|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|date=17 September 2009|accessdate=28 September 2009}}</ref> He went on to say that Syed is still attracted to Amira but only because \"that's what he\u2019s meant to do\", adding that \"he's probably conning himself.\"<ref name=\"bbc17sep\"/> Christian's friend [[James Mackie (EastEnders)|James Mackie]], played by [[Paul Keating (actor)|Paul Keating]] arrives and when Syed refuses to break up with Amira, Christian starts a relationship with James to forget Syed. Elliott says that this is the moment when Syed realises his feelings for Christian go beyond sexual attraction.<ref name=\"bbc17sep\"/> Elliot explains that Syed and Amira have never been intimate, in theory because of their religion, but adds that Syed is probably scared to get intimate with her and is merely hiding behind his religion.<ref name=\"bbc17sep\"/>\n\nIn December 2009, Santer was asked what his favourite story line of the year had been. He replied \"I'm really pleased with the Christian/Syed story line. It's bold and we thought long and hard before we did it to make sure we got it right and I'm really proud with what we've done. Marc [Elliott] and John [Partridge] have absolutely stepped up to the plate and like all good ''EastEnders'' stories, we're not even half done with it yet.

They have a traditional Pakistani wedding featuring horses, drummers and dancers. Scriptwriters researched by watching videos of a real British Pakistani wedding. [[BBC Asian Network]] reporter Shabnam Mahmood also advised on the wedding. The wedding and its build-up were filmed over a two-week period and Elliott required three two-hour riding lessons before he could film the horseback scenes. He revealed: \"I was quite proud of myself, though, as I managed to canter although I don't do that around the Square as it's not that big. During rehearsals the horse, Storm, was really well behaved and it all went fairly smoothly. But as soon as it came to the actual filming and all the drums and banners came out, it wasn't so easy. I think she walks sideways for quite a bit of the time. But I'm just pleased that I didn't end up impaled on the railings in Albert Square.

Preeya kept getting occasional glimpses of me practising in the hallways and she didn't look too impressed with what she saw.
