According to [[Cyril of Scythopolis]], during this time the monks of the East, who had chosen the desert for a severer mode of life, returned to their monasteries.<ref name=Mershman/>\n\nIn certain countries, such as Brazil and Italy, it is seen as the beginning of the [[Holy Week]] observances. The ''Viernes de Dolores'' (Friday of Sorrows).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quanaxhuato.com/fiestas-y-tradiciones/viernes-de-dolores/|title=Viernes de Dolores|author=Grupo LEXED|work=Quanaxhuato.com}}</ref> is a solemn pious remembrance of the sorrowful [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] on the Friday before [[Palm Sunday]] held in the fifth week of Lent.\n\nIn the Orthodox Church, the Fifth Saturday of Great Lent is known as the [[Akathist#Akathist to the Theotokos|Saturday of the Akathist]], when the \"Akathist to the Theotokos\" is sung at Compline. \n \n==Observance==\nIn the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Western Rite Orthodoxy]], [[Lutheranism]], and in [[Anglo-Catholic]] churches, all [[crucifix]]es and images may be covered in veils (usually violet, the [[Liturgical color|color]] of vestments in Lent) starting on Passion Sunday: \"The practice of covering crosses and images in the church may be observed, if the episcopal conference decides. The crosses are to be covered until the end of the celebration of the Lord's passion on [[Good Friday]]. Statues and images are to remain covered until the beginning of the [[Easter Vigil]].\"<ref>Note at the end of the Mass of Saturday of the Fourth Week of Lent in the Roman Missal</ref><ref name=\"Petersen2015\">{{cite web |last1=Petersen |first1=David H. |title=The Ceremonies of Passiontide Described |url=https://gottesdienstonline.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-ceremonies-of-passiontide-described.html |publisher=Gottesdienst Online |accessdate=4 October 2019 |language=English |date=26 February 2015}}</ref> (Specifically, those veils are removed during the singing of the ''[[Gloria in excelsis deo|Gloria]]''.)  The veiling was associated with Passion Sunday's Gospel ({{bibleverse||John|8:46-59}}), in which Jesus \"hid himself\" from the people.<ref name=Mershman>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Passiontide}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Tridentine Mass]], Psalm 42 (43) is omitted at ferial [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]] until [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]] inclusive, as is the short doxology (''[[Gloria Patri]]'') at the Introit and the Psalm ''Lavabo'' at Mass. It is likewise omitted in Psalm 94 at [[Matins]], and the responds at [[Matins]], [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]], [[Terce]], [[Sext]], [[None (liturgy)|None]], and [[Compline]]. Also in the ferial Mass, the Preface for Lent gives way to the Preface of the Cross.\n\nIn the 1955 Holy Week revisions, Passion Sunday was formally renamed from ''Dominica Passionis'' or ''Dominica de Passione'' (\"Sunday of the Passion\") to ''Dominica I Passionis'', \"First Sunday of the Passion\" or \"First Sunday of Passiontide\". Palm Sunday, formerly ''Dominica in Palmis'' (\"Sunday in Palms\") became ''Dominica II Passionis seu in Palmis'' (\"II Sunday of the Passion or in Palms\").\n\nSince the revision of the [[General Roman Calendar]] in 1969, the name \"Passiontide\" is no longer used for the last two weeks of Lent, although the former usage is somewhat preserved in the formal name for the Sunday before Easter, \"Palm Sunday of the Lord's Passion\". However, the Preface called that of the Passion of the Lord I (The Power of the Cross) is used in the fifth week of Lent and the Preface of the Passion of the Lord II (The Victory of the Passion) is used on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of Holy Week.\n\nPassiontide is observed in many provinces of the [[Anglican Communion]], for example in the [[Church of England]]. In the ''[[Common Worship]]'' liturgy, material proper to Passiontide is used from [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] on the Eve of the Fifth Sunday of Lent to the evening of Easter Eve. Such \"proper material\" includes prefaces to the [[Eucharistic Prayer]], special orders for [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]] and Evening Prayer, and seasonal material for [[Compline|Night Prayer]] and [[Prayer During the Day]]. Although the [[Sarum Use]] used crimson as the [[liturgical colour]] for the whole of Passiontide, ''Common Worship'' recommends continuing in purple (or Lenten array) throughout the fifth week of Lent, changing to red for [[Holy Week]].\n\n===Passion week===\nPassion Week is a name for the week beginning on [[Passion Sunday]], as the Fifth Sunday of Lent was once called in the [[Roman Rite]].\n\nHowever, even before [[Pope John XXIII]]'s [[Code of Rubrics]] (1960) changed the name of this Sunday from \"Passion Sunday\" (Dominica de Passione)<ref>[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/missale-romanum-pdf.html Missale Romanum, 1920 typical edition], p. 156</ref>  to \"First Sunday of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]\" (Dominica I Passionis),<ref>[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/books-1962/missale-romanum-1962.pdf Missale Romanum 1962], p. 118</ref> the liturgical books gave no special name to this week, referring to the days in it simply as \"Monday (etc.) after Passion Sunday\", which in Pope John XXIII's edition of the [[Roman Missal]] became \"Monday (etc.) after the First Sunday of the Passion\".\n\nIn Pope John XXIII's revision, not only the Sunday that had previously had the exclusive name of Passion Sunday but also the following Sunday referred in their names to the Passion. The latter became the \"Second Sunday of the Passion or [[Palm Sunday]]\" (Dominica II Passionis seu in Palmis).<ref>[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/books-1962/missale-romanum-1962.pdf Missale Romanum 1962], p. 130</ref> The week beginning on that Sunday continued to have a distinctive name, \"[[Holy Week]]\" (\"Hebdomada sancta\") (previously, \"Great Week\", \"Hebdomada major\", but referred to in English as Holy Week), and the first days in it were called \"Monday (etc.) of Holy Week\", not \"Monday (etc.) after the Second Sunday of the Passion or Palm Sunday\".\n\nIn the 1969 revision, Passiontide ceased to be a separate liturgical season and became the Fifth Week of Lent, followed by Holy Week.\n\nUntil the introduction of the new Harmony of the Gospel ''Readings for Holy Week'' in 1969, English-speaking members of the [[Moravian Church]] used the name \"Passion Week\" for Holy Week, a week much more closely associated with the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]].\n\n==Music for Passiontide==\nMuch music has been written for Passiontide.  The [[Gregorian chant]] composed for the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqwiWJtJbeA First Sunday of Passiontide] expresses two main themes: the expectation of Easter and the suffering that will be endured on Good Friday.  The Inroit \"Iudica Me Domine\" (Ps. 42 [43]), the Graduel \"Eripe Me Domine\" (Ps. 139), and the Tract \"Saepe Expugnaverunt\" (Ps. 128) all express the theme of the persecution of the just man.  The Offertory on the other hand \"Confitebor\" (from Ps. 137 [138]) concentrates on the hope of ultimate victory and vindication.  The Communion antiphon \"Hoc Corpus\" is taken directly from the Gospels and has a eucharist theme fittingly adapted to the liturgical moment that it accompanies, but it also calls to mind the impending Passover meal, which will serve as the setting for the Last Supper.\n\n[[Passion cantata]]s have been composed to texts in a variety of languages, taking as their theme the hours or days before the [[Death and resurrection of Jesus|Crucifixion of Christ]]. Many settings have been made of the [[Latin language|Latin]] [[poem]] ''[[Stabat Mater]]'', which describes [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] standing in front of the Cross watching her son die (the Feast of the Seven Dolours of the Blessed Virgin is observed on Friday in Passion Week), and the lessons from the [[Tenebrae (service)|Tenebrae]] service have been set by a variety of composers.\n\nSeveral composers have set to music the seven [[sayings of Jesus on the cross]]. [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] composed a cantata, ''[[Die sieben Worte Jesu Christi am Kreuz]]'', c. 1645. [[Joseph Haydn]] wrote seven string quartets, ''[[The Seven Last Words of Christ (Haydn)|Die sieben letzten Worte unseres Erl\u00f6sers am Kreuze]]'' (The seven last wods of our Redeemer on the cross) which was also appeared in other arrangements. ''The Seven Last Words from the Cross'', a cantata for choir and strings was composed in 1993) by [[James MacMillan]].\n<!--\nNotice that there are special hymns for [[Palm Sunday]], thus hymns for Passiontide may be squeezed out on that day (which is the last Sunday of Lent). -->\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n{{Commons category|Passiontide}}\n\n{{Liturgical year of the Catholic Church}}\n\n[[Category:Catholic liturgy]]\n[[Category:Lent]]\n[[Category:Holy Week]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox holiday|holiday_name = Passiontide\n|type = [[Christianity|Christian]]\n|image = StMartin43-53.JPG\n|caption = Cross veiled during Passiontide in Lent (Pfarrkirche St. Martin in [[Tannheim]], [[Baden W\u00fcrttemberg]], Germany).\n|observedby = [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]]<br>[[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]]<br> [[Eastern Orthodox Church | Eastern Orthodox]] <br> [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] <br>[[Moravian Church|Moravians]] <br>[[Oriental Orthodox]]<br>[[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]<br>[[Methodists]]\n|date = \n|celebrations = \n|observances = \n|relatedto = \n}}\n{{Lent_calendar.svg}}\n'''Passiontide''' (in the Christian [[liturgical year]]) is a name for the last two weeks of [[Lent]], beginning on the Fifth Sunday of Lent, long celebrated as [[Passion Sunday]], and ending on [[Holy Saturday]].\n\n[[File:Lenten shrouds.jpeg|thumb|left|Statues and icons veiled in violet shrouds for Passiontide in [[St Pancras Church, Ipswich]] (in Catholic churches in England, paintings are also veiled)]]\n\n==History==\n\"Passiontide\" refers to the last two weeks of Lent.

Palm Sunday, formerly ''Dominica in Palmis'' (\"Sunday in Palms\") became ''Dominica II Passionis seu in Palmis'' (\"II Sunday of the Passion or in Palms\").\n\nSince the revision of the [[General Roman Calendar]] in 1969, the name \"Passiontide\" is no longer used for the last two weeks of Lent, although the former usage is somewhat preserved in the formal name for the Sunday before Easter, \"Palm Sunday of the Lord's Passion\". However, the Preface called that of the Passion of the Lord I (The Power of the Cross) is used in the fifth week of Lent and the Preface of the Passion of the Lord II (The Victory of the Passion) is used on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of Holy Week.\n\nPassiontide is observed in many provinces of the [[Anglican Communion]], for example in the [[Church of England]].
